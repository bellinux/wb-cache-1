40|$|Active metal <b>braze</b> <b>alloys</b> {{reduce the}} number of {{processes}} required for the joining of metal to ceramic components by eliminating the need for metallization and/or Ni plating of the ceramic surfaces. Titanium (Ti), V, and Zr are examples of active element additions which have been used successfully in such <b>braze</b> <b>alloys.</b> Since the <b>braze</b> <b>alloy</b> is expected to accommodate thermal expansion mismatch strains between the metal and ceramic materials, a knowledge of its elevated temperature mechanical properties is important. In particular, the {{issue of whether or not}} the creep strength of an active metal <b>braze</b> <b>alloy</b> is increased or decreased relative to its non-activated counterpart is important when designing new <b>brazing</b> processes and <b>alloy</b> systems. This paper presents a survey of high temperature mechanical properties for two pairs of conventional <b>braze</b> <b>alloys</b> and their active metal counterparts: (a) the conventional 72 Ag- 28 Cu (Cusil) alloy, and the active <b>braze</b> <b>alloy</b> 62. 2 Ag- 36. 2 Cu- 1. 6 Ti (Cusil ABA), and (b) the 82 Au- 18 Ni (Nioro) alloy and the active <b>braze</b> <b>alloy</b> Mu- 15. 5 M- 0. 75 Mo- 1. 75 V (Nioro ABA). For the case of the Cusil/Cusil ABA pair, the active metal addition contributes to solid solution strengthening of the <b>braze</b> <b>alloy,</b> resulting in a higher creep strength as compared to the non-active alloy. In the case of the Nioro/Nioro ABA pair, the Mo and V additions cause the active <b>braze</b> <b>alloy</b> to have a two-phase microstructure, which results in a reduced creep strength than the conventional <b>braze</b> <b>alloy.</b> The Garofalo sinh equation has been used to quantitatively describe the stress and temperature dependence of the deformation behavior. It will be observed that the effective stress exponent in the Garofalo sinh equation is a function of the instantaneous value of the stress argument...|$|R
40|$|Components made of {{high-performance}} ceramics or superalloys {{are subject}} to strict requirements {{with regard to their}} geometric and dimensional accuracy. The surface finish and edge zone characteristics have a large effect on the component's performance. These requirements can not be met directly by the sintering process used in the manufacture of ceramic materials or traditional casting of superalloys. Grinding is both technically and economically the number one choice when one has to consider machining these materials. Metal Single Layer (MSL) grinding technology provides an alternative way {{to make use of the}} superabrasives, diamond and CBN, in grinding these materials. One of the primary challenges in MSL grinding technology is to develop suitable active <b>braze</b> <b>alloy(s)</b> which can bond the superabrasive grits. Ticusil (Ag-Cu eutectic+ 4. 5 wt% Ti) and 70 Cu- 21 Sn- 9 Ti (wt%) are two of the currently used active <b>braze</b> <b>alloys.</b> The primary failure mode of these two MSL wheels in the grinding test is transverse fracture and debonding of the diamond grits. The high applied load is responsible for transverse fracture of the diamond grit, and the intermetallic phase existing at the interface between the diamond and the <b>braze</b> <b>alloy</b> is one of the causes of the debonding of the diamond grits. Also, a finite element analysis shows that most of the residual thermal stresses and the thermal mismatch strains are localized at the diamond/braze alloy interface. This results in potential weakness of this area. Moreover, the inherent defects, such as voids, and the brittle intermetallics in the interface can cause crack initiation and propagation. Both deteriorate the life of the grinding wheel. The failure of the <b>braze</b> <b>alloy</b> can be divided into two categories. If the grinding process is very abrasive, such as green concrete grinding, the wear resistance of the braze dominates the fracture of the <b>braze</b> <b>alloy.</b> On the other hand, failure of the <b>braze</b> <b>alloy</b> can also result from cracks at the interface. In such a case, the fatigue resistance of the <b>braze</b> <b>alloy</b> plays an important role in determining the wheel's life. The wear resistance of the <b>braze</b> <b>alloy</b> can be improved by introducing suitable hard particles. It was found that a <b>braze</b> <b>alloy</b> of 77 Cu- 23 Sn- 12. 5 Ti- 7. 5 Zr- 10 TiC- 0. 2 C (by weight) exhibits excellent performance in a wear test (a ten fold improvement), which is further confirmed in the grinding test (a two fold increase in life). The fatigue resistance of the active <b>braze</b> <b>alloy</b> can be modified by either reducing the volume fraction of the brittle intermetallic phase in the braze and/or enhancing the ductility of the <b>braze</b> <b>alloy</b> matrix. A ductile active <b>braze</b> <b>alloy</b> can be achieved by combining the two-layer structure and two step brazing process. To aid dissolution and diffusion of the Cu atoms into the Cu/Sn/Ti <b>braze</b> <b>alloy,</b> a lower volume fraction of the intermetallic phase and higher ductile matrix of the braze can be achieved. Both have beneficial effects in modifying the ductility of the active <b>braze</b> <b>alloy,</b> and make removal of the <b>braze</b> <b>alloy</b> from the substrate by acid etching easier. by Ren-Kae Shiue.

50|$|For {{successful}} wetting, {{the base}} metal {{must be at}} least partially soluble in at least one component of the <b>brazing</b> <b>alloy.</b> The molten alloy therefore tends to attack the base metal and dissolve it, slightly changing its composition in the process. The composition change is reflected in the change of the alloy's melting point and the corresponding change of fluidity. For example, some alloys dissolve both silver and copper; dissolved silver lowers their melting point and increases fluidity, copper has the opposite effect.|$|E

The alloys blends and error analysis were done by experimental design software (Design Expert 8. 0. 7. 1). Design of experiments was done by Scheffe quadratic mixture method. The liquidus temperatures were predicted by calculation of phase diagrams of the <b>alloying</b> metals. The <b>brazing</b> <b>alloys</b> were produced by gravity technique and melted using silicon carbide graphite crucible. The quality of the <b>brazing</b> <b>alloys</b> was analyzed by optical microscopy (OM), atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) and {{fourier transform infrared spectroscopy}} (FT-IR). Brazed joints were produced by torch method with a commercial flux. Brazing temperatures (liquidus) were tracked by a digital infrared/laser pyrometer. Some mechanical properties studied were tensile strength and hardness. Finally, brazed joints produced from the developed <b>brazing</b> <b>alloys</b> were compared to that produced from muntz brass. Six (6) <b>brazing</b> <b>alloys</b> were successfully developed. Zinc and manganese were the main components, to which were added; 3 to 4 %wt silver and 11 to 15 %wt modifying element. The microstructure showed a typical eutectic structure with zinc-rich phase distributed uniformly in the matrix with a combination of different sizes of dendrite, rounded blocks of compounds and hypoeutectic structures. AAS results indicated minimal out-gassing of zinc and FT-IR results indicated very low presence of atmospheric gas. The range of brazing temperature for best results was recorded from 690. 90 to 735. 10 0 C.

40|$|AbstractBrazing {{of ceramic}} and metal {{components}} is an emerging manufacturing technology {{in which a}} furnace or a heat source is used to join the substrates using a brazing filler material. Brazing of ceramic and metal has received considerable attention {{in the field of}} nuclear reactor, aerospace, automobile, medical and electrical engineering. A <b>brazing</b> <b>alloy</b> can either be a conventional <b>brazing</b> <b>alloy</b> which requires the ceramic surface to be metalized or an active <b>brazing</b> <b>alloy</b> which does not require metallization. A sound interfacial adhesive bond is formed during the process. Vacuum brazing of alumina and steel (SS 304) with Cusil active <b>brazing</b> <b>alloy</b> has been carried out for the analysis of behavior of joint in different loading condition. Uniformity and presence of defects of the joints is confirmed by observing the Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images.

40|$|Through the {{application}} of solution thermodynamic principles, brazing alloys based on the Ni/Cr ratio of AWS BNi- 5 (Ni- 18 Cr- 19 Si (atom%); Ni/Cr = 3. 46) were designed for brazing SiC to itself and Nb. The optimum alloy composition for SiC-SiC joints was computed to be Ni- 14. 5 Cr- 35 Si (atom%). Brazing experiments were conducted to assess the effect of changing the Si content of the <b>brazing</b> <b>alloy</b> away from the calculated optimum on the joint microstructures and strengths. For alloys containing less than 37 atom% Si excessive reaction was observed, resulting {{in the formation of}} a porous reaction zone at the brazing alloy/SiC interface and poor joint strengths, the thickness of the porous zone decreasing and the joint strength increasing as the <b>brazing</b> <b>alloy</b> composition approached 37 atom% Si. The most favourable joint microstructures and highest joint strengths ($ approx$ 100 MPa) were observed for the 37 atom% Si <b>brazing</b> <b>alloy,</b> in excellent agreement with the thermodynamic model. For alloys containing greater than 37 atom% Si, the microstructures exhibited localized debonding of the brazing alloys from the SiC and poorer joint strengths, also in good agreement with the thermodynamic model. For the SiC-Nb brazing study, the thermodynamic modelling procedure determined that a series of Ni-Cr-Si-Nb alloys were suitable for forming bonds. Brazing experiments were performed using two of the "optimum" <b>brazing</b> <b>alloy</b> compositions (i. e. Ni- 11. 6 Cr- 29 Si- 19 Nb and Ni- 11. 2 Cr- 20 Si- 30 Nb (atom%)) and two alloys of lower Si and Nb contents in order to assess the predictions of the thermodynamic model through evaluation of the joint microstructures. All of the joints exhibited porous reaction zones, with the thickness of the reaction zone decreasing as the Si and Nb content of the brazing alloys approached the computed optima. However, due to cracking and solidification porosity in the <b>brazing</b> <b>alloy,</b> these joints were found to be unsuitable for engineering applications. It was concluded that the solution thermodynamic method developed in this thesis was very useful for selecting Ni-based (Ni/Cr = 3. 46) <b>brazing</b> <b>alloy</b> compositions suitable for forming SiC-SiC-Nb bonds...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In this study, {{vacuum brazing}} of diamond grit was {{performed}} using an Ni- 10 Sn- 28 Cr alloy {{in order to}} examine the interfacial behaviors. In order to study the wettability between diamond grit and the <b>brazing</b> <b>alloy,</b> a graphite was used instead of diamond grit. The contact angle of Ni- 10 Sn- 28 Cr alloy and graphite decreased with increasing holding time and temperature. The shear strength between graphite and Ni- 10 Sn- 28 Cr filler alloy showed the best value of 29. 8 MPa at 1100 ℃ brazing temperature. It was shown that the shear strength was decreased significantly due to the increase of the thickness of brittle reaction layer and interface residual stress, as the brazing temperature increased up to 1200 ℃.
