Since the short-circuit periods are very short, the short-circuit forces in single conductor overhead lines are usually low {{because of the large}} phase spacing. However these forces may have considerable impact on distribution lines due to the change in phase spacing during short-circuit occurrences. For <b>bundle</b> <b>conductor</b> lines, the short-circuit forces between subconductors are significantly higher due to the small distance between them. Methods for estimating the compressive forces on <b>bundle</b> <b>conductor</b> spacers or spacer dampers are discussed...|$|E

Aeroelastic models of single and <b>bundled</b> <b>conductors</b> with a typical ice-coating section forms (crescent section) were set up.

The wind attack angles have seriously affected the aerodynamic force of the iced conductor. The wake of vortex shedding for the iced single conductor was analyzed. As for the iced <b>bundled</b> <b>conductors,</b> sub-conductors at the downstream were seriously influenced by the ones at the upstream locations and the aerodynamic force of the sub-conductors at the downstream was lower than of those at the upstream.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an improved leader progression model (LPM). The model uses the proposed leader inception criterion {{for the analysis}} of lightning shielding performance of UHVAC transmission lines. It focuses on the discussion of the leader inception voltage of bundle conductors. The improved LPM is validated on 500 kV EHV transmission lines. The shielding performance of a UHVAC transmission line to be constructed in a Chinese Test Line Project is then evaluated. The results indicate that the power frequency operating voltage and the <b>bundle</b> <b>conductor</b> configuration have a greater influence on the shielding failure flashover rate (SFFOR) of 1000 kV UHV lines than that of 500 kV EHV lines. It is found that the UHVAC line to be built will not cause trip accidents due to shielding failure in flat terrain.

40|$|As Eskom {{continues}} its drive for Electricity-for-All and the electrification of rural areas, there is continuing pressure {{to reduce costs}} {{by the use of}} appropriate technologies and designs. Single Wire Earth Return (SWER) and dual phase LV technologies have been introduced for rural areas supply. Savings have also been made by the selection of appropriate design loads on which to base the network design. In addition to load and household density, overall cost per connection is also affected by the extent of voltage regulation allowed for in feeder design and operation. Rural electrification projects are typically supplied by 11 kV or 22 kV 3 wire overhead distribution systems. The LV (230 V single phase or 400 V three phase) supplies are distributed to individual homes using Aerial <b>Bundle</b> <b>Conductor</b> (ABC) and Airdac service connections. The design of the distribution infrastructure is based on the requirement that the voltages at all LV customer installations stay within ± 10 % of the nominal voltage, in accordance with the regulations of the National Electricity Regulator and NRS 048. The maximum allowable voltage drop in the LV feeders is effectively dictated by the local MV supply voltage and level of boosting that is being performed by the local distribution MV/LV supply transformer, which is equipped with an Off Circuit Tap Switch (OCTS).

40|$|Government of Sri Lanka spends {{large amounts}} of money to {{implement}} Rural Electrification (RE) schemes with the support of concessionary loans from various funding agencies such as Asian Development Bank, Japanese Bank of International Corporation and Kuwait Fund. The expectation of the government is to develop rural areas by providing electricity to those areas and enhance the living standards of rural people. The aim {{of this study is to}} investigate the implemented RE schemes and to examine whether the desired targets have been achieved as planned in the initial stage and the reasons for failures if expected results have not been achieved, and to propose corrective actions to overcome those problems. Nine RE schemes were selected from Kalutara, Monaragala and Badulla districts which are implemented in the period of year 1998 to year 2000 by CEB under Project - RE 3 funded by Asian Development Bank for investigation. 1. Social and Economical development achieved by these schemes 2. Technical problems related to these schemes and reliability of electricity supply. The present situations of these schemes were investigated through a structured survey and compared the results with expectation of the planning stage. At the occasions of present results are deviated from the expected targets, corrective actions are proposed for implementation in existing RE schemes and also in future RE schemes. The development in social and economic benefits in the villages due to rural electrification schemes can be summarized as, Achievement on economic benefits, poverty alleviation, household benefits, education level, community benefits and incentive to build houses are found to be satisfactory. Improvements on employment opportunities, small industries, commercial and agricultural activities and health services are found to be not satisfactory. Migration of villagers to urban areas was reduced and no harmful environmental effects are observed. It is further revealed that reliability of electricity supply provided for rural villages are not satisfactory, Energy losses are considerably high, Load factor, Power factor and All-day efficiency of RE substations are at acceptable levels, Safety levels provided by the RE schemes are fairly low, The effectiveness of RE schemes were considerably reduced due to above technical reasons.

40|$|Under {{the certain}} rain-wind conditions, <b>bundled</b> <b>conductors</b> exhibit a rain-wind induced large-amplitude {{vibration}}. This type of vibration {{can cause the}} fatigue fractures of conductors and fatigue failures of spacers, which threaten the safety operation and serviceability of high-voltage transmission line. To reveal the mechanism of rain-wind induced vibration of <b>bundled</b> <b>conductors,</b> a series of 2 -dimensional CFD models about the twin <b>bundled</b> <b>conductors</b> with rivulets are developed to obtain the curves of aerodynamic coefficients with the upper rivulet angle. The influences of the forward conductor’s aerodynamic shielding and the upper rivulet’s aerodynamic characteristics on the leeward conductor are discussed. Furthermore, a 2 -dimensional 3 DOF model for the rain-wind induced vibration of the leeward conductor is established. The model is solved by finite element method and Newmark method, {{and the effects of}} the wind velocity and the upper rivulet’s motion on vibration amplitude of the leeward conductor are analyzed. By contrast with the wake-induced vibration, it can easily find that the characteristics of rain-wind vibration are obviously {{different from those of the}} wake-induced vibration, and the main reason of the rain-induced vibration may be due to the upper rivulet’s motion...|$|R

50|$|For {{transmission}} of power across long distances, high voltage transmission is employed.

50|$|<b>Bundled</b> <b>conductors</b> {{reduce the}} voltage {{gradient}} {{in the vicinity}} of the line. This reduces the possibility of corona discharge. At extra high voltage, the electric field gradient at the surface of a single conductor is high enough to ionize air, which wastes power, generates unwanted audible noise and interferes with communication systems. The field surrounding a <b>bundle</b> of <b>conductors</b> is similar to the field that would surround a single, very large conductor—this produces lower gradients which mitigates issues associated with high field strength. The transmission efficiency is improved as loss due to corona effect is countered.|$|R

50|$|High-voltage {{overhead}} conductors are {{not covered}} by insulation. The conductor material is nearly always an aluminum alloy, made into several strands and possibly reinforced with steel strands. Copper was sometimes used for overhead transmission, but aluminum is lighter, yields only marginally reduced performance and costs much less. Overhead conductors are a commodity supplied by several companies worldwide. Improved conductor material and shapes are regularly used to allow increased capacity and modernize transmission circuits. Conductor sizes range from 12 mm2 (#6 American wire gauge) to 750 mm2 (1,590,000 circular mils area), with varying resistance and current-carrying capacity. Thicker wires would lead to a relatively small increase in capacity due to the skin effect (which causes most of the current to flow close {{to the surface of the}} wire). Because of this current limitation, multiple parallel cables (called <b>bundle</b> <b>conductors)</b> are used when higher capacity is needed. <b>Bundle</b> <b>conductors</b> are also used at high voltages to reduce energy loss caused by corona discharge.|$|R
