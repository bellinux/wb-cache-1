5|$|When {{used in the}} {{production}} or handling of chlorine, titanium should not be exposed to dry chlorine gas <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> result in a titanium–chlorine fire. Even wet chlorine presents a fire hazard when extreme weather conditions cause unexpected drying.|$|E
5|$|Despite heavy fishing {{pressure}} {{within its}} range, the cloudy catshark remains common, perhaps <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> be more biologically productive {{than most other}} sharks. As a result, it has been assessed as Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Cloudy catsharks {{from a number of}} locations off Japan {{have been found to be}} contaminated with polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDEs), which they acquire from their food. One likely source of these pollutants is the use of the pesticide DDT by developing nations in southern Asia.|$|E
50|$|SpEL - Spring Expression Language, an {{open source}} EL {{that is part}} of the Spring Framework. It's mainly used in Spring {{portfolio}} projects but <b>because</b> <b>it's</b> technology-agnostic <b>it</b> <b>may</b> be used in other projects.|$|R
30|$|Impact on {{segmentation}} speed. The {{usage of}} the abridging parameter reduces the time demand of the mode seeking procedure, <b>because</b> although <b>it</b> <b>may</b> {{increase the number of}} resampling operations, it drastically cuts back the number of required mean shift iterations. Sect. 5.2 gives a complete overview.|$|R

5|$|As a term, neo {{soul was}} coined by Kedar Massenburg of Motown Records {{in the late}} 1990s as a {{marketing}} category following the commercial breakthroughs of artists such as D'Angelo, Erykah Badu, Lauryn Hill, and Maxwell. The success of D'Angelo's 1995 debut album Brown Sugar has been regarded by several writers and music critics as inspiration behind the term's origin. While some artists have ignored the label, others have received the designation with controversy <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> seem contrived to music audiences and imply that soul music had ended {{at some point in}} time. In a 2002 interview for Billboard, Massenburg said that genre classifications are often unpopular because they may be suggestive of a short-lived trend. However, although he said neo soul is still essentially soul music, Massenburg felt there was a need to market artists of the genre for listeners to have an understanding of what they were buying.|$|E
25|$|The MSR {{test has}} been criticised for several reasons, in particular, <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> result in {{findings}} that are false negatives.|$|E

50|$|A pointer {{which does}} not have any address {{assigned}} to it is called a wild pointer. Any attempt to use such uninitialized pointers can cause unexpected behavior, either because the initial value is not a valid address, or <b>because</b> using <b>it</b> <b>may</b> damage other parts of the program. The result is often a segmentation fault, storage violation or wild branch (if used as a function pointer or branch address).|$|R

5000|$|He {{became so}} obsessed with Euclid's {{parallel}} postulate that his father wrote to him: [...] "For God's sake, I beseech you, give it up. Fear it no less than sensual passions <b>because</b> <b>it</b> too <b>may</b> take all your time and deprive you of your health, peace of mind and happiness in life". János, however, persisted in his quest and eventually {{came to the conclusion}} that the postulate is independent of the other axioms of geometry and that different consistent geometries can be constructed on its negation.|$|R

25|$|Digoxin {{has fallen}} out of favor in people with heart failure <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> {{increase}} the risk of death. Because other therapies have shown a mortality benefit in congestive heart failure, maximizing other therapies (e.g., beta blockers) first is recommended before using digoxin.|$|E
25|$|The {{political}} {{dead zone}} near {{the centre of}} the sea is also the focus of a mounting dispute between the United States, Russia, Canada, Norway, and Denmark.

40|$|Abstract We {{extend the}} {{literature}} on exclusive dealing by allowing the incumbent and the potential entrant to merge. This uncovers new effects. First, exclusive dealing {{can be used to}} improve the incumbent's bargaining position in the merger negotiation. Second, the incumbent finds it easier to elicit the buyer's acceptance of exclusivity. Third, despite allowing the more efficient technology to find its way into the industry, exclusive dealing reduces welfare <b>because</b> (i) <b>it</b> <b>may</b> trigger entry through merger whereas independent entry would be socially optimal and (ii) <b>it</b> <b>may</b> deter entry altogether.

25|$|Unlike other B {{vitamins}} {{which are}} not stored in the body, B12 is stored in the liver. <b>Because</b> of this, <b>it</b> <b>may</b> take 5–10 years before a sudden dietary B12 deficiency will become apparent in a previously healthy adult. B12 deficiency, also known as hypocobalaminemia, often results from complications involving absorption into the body.|$|R
25|$|This {{discussion}} of the dental amalgam controversy outlines {{the debate over whether}} dental amalgam (the silver alloy in dental fillings) should be used. Supporters claim that it is safe, effective and long-lasting while critics argue that claims have been made since the 1840s that amalgam is unsafe <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> cause mercury poisoning and other toxicity.|$|E
25|$|It may be {{difficult}} in this early stage of the ISPL process to thoroughly identify the service domain though, <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> be that external suppliers will be attracted to deliver some of the deliverables. External suppliers are, at this point unknown. This is why, {{during the course of}} the acquisition, the situation & risk analysis must be repeated for re-evaluation.|$|E
25|$|<b>Because</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> be {{considered}} commodity platinum {{rather than a}} rare coin, the American Platinum Eagle may be placed in an Individual Retirement Account in the United States. Collectibles such as rare coins and dolls are forbidden from being held in such an account. Thus, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission believes that the Platinum Eagle will not appreciate beyond its metal value.|$|E

25|$|Mainstream medical bodies {{state that}} {{conversion}} therapy can be harmful <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> exploit guilt and anxiety, thereby damaging self-esteem and leading to depression and even suicide. There is also {{concern in the}} mental health community that the advancement of conversion therapy can cause social harm by disseminating inaccurate views about sexual orientation and the ability of gay and bisexual people to lead happy, healthy lives.|$|E
25|$|Salvage divers from Halliburton first {{detached}} the bow {{from the}} rest of the vessel <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> have contained unexploded torpedo warheads and because it could break off and destabilise the lifting. The divers installed two large hydraulic suction anchors into the seabed and attached a high-strength tungsten carbide abrasive saw that was pulled back and forth over the bow between the anchors. It took ten days to detach the bow.|$|E
25|$|For example, {{the popular}} {{recursive}} quicksort algorithm provides quite reasonable performance with adequate RAM, {{but due to}} the recursive way that it copies portions of the array it becomes much less practical when the array does not fit in RAM, <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> cause a number of slow copy or move operations to and from disk. In that scenario, another algorithm may be preferable even if it requires more total comparisons.|$|E

And let you, Stephen, make a novena to your holy patron saint, the first martyr, {{who is very}} powerful with God, that God may enlighten your mind. But you must be quite sure, Stephen, {{that you have a}} vocation <b>because</b> <b>it</b> would be terrible if you found afterwards that you had none. Once a priest always a priest, remember. Your catechism tells you that the sacrament of Holy Orders is one of those which can be received only once <b>because</b> <b>it</b> imprints on the soul an indelible spiritual mark which can never be effaced. It is before you must weigh well, not after. It is a solemn question, Stephen, <b>because</b> on <b>it</b> <b>may</b> depend the salvation of your eternal soul. But we will pray to God together.|$|R
30|$|The recent approaches, which {{addressed}} full periodicity, partial periodicity, {{perfect and}} imperfect periodicity [7], and asynchronous periodicity [18] are {{all based on}} fixed size and adjacent time units and fixed length of discovered patterns. In our case, the cycles are pretty well determined by the real-world events and <b>because</b> of that <b>it</b> <b>may</b> have variable size and non-contiguous structure.|$|R
50|$|Modern MDCT {{scanners}} {{are able}} to overcome this interdependence, and are capable of imaging at full resolution yet retain very fast coverage - images can then be reconstructed retrospectively from the volumetric raw data. <b>Because</b> of this, <b>it</b> <b>may</b> be possible to reconstruct inspiratory HRCT-like images from the data taken from a 'normal' chest CT scan.|$|R
