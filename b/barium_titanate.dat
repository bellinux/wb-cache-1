5|$|The term titanates usually {{refers to}} titanium(IV) compounds, as {{represented}} by <b>barium</b> <b>titanate</b> (BaTiO3). With a perovskite structure, this material exhibits piezoelectric properties and {{is used as a}} transducer in the interconversion of sound and electricity. Many minerals are titanates, e.g. ilmenite (FeTiO3). Star sapphires and rubies get their asterism (star-forming shine) from the presence of titanium dioxide impurities.|$|E

40|$|<b>Barium</b> {{strontium}} <b>titanate</b> {{thin film}} varactors {{have been widely}} investigated {{for the purpose of}} creating tunable front-ends for RF and microwave systems. There is an abundance of literature observing the capacitance-voltage behavior and methods on improving tunability. However, {{there is a lack of}} thorough investigations on the nonlinear behavior, specifically the third order intermodulation distortion, and the parameters that impact it. There is also a research void that needs to be filled for nanoscale <b>barium</b> strontium <b>titanate</b> varactors as nanotechnology becomes increasingly prevalent in the design of RF and microwave components. This work aims to advance the understanding of nonlinear properties of <b>barium</b> strontium <b>titanate</b> varactors. Temperature and voltage impacts on the third order intermodulation distortion products of BST varactors are observed by two-tone measurements. The material properties of the films are correlated with the nonlinear behavior of the varactors. Additionally, size reduction capabilities are shown by fabricating planar <b>barium</b> strontium <b>titanate</b> interdigital varactors with nanoscale size gaps between the electrodes.

40|$|Abstract. <b>Barium</b> {{zirconate}} <b>titanate</b> ceramics {{were prepared}} by microwave sintering. Effects of microwave sintering time at 2. 5 kW on microstructure, dielectric and ferroelectric properties of <b>barium</b> zirconate <b>titanate</b> ceramics have been investigated. The result {{shows that the}} ceramic samples sintered at 2. 5 kW for 15 ~ 30 min are single phase perovskite structure {{and there is no}} secondary phase observed. The degree of crystallinity increases with the increase of microwave sintering time. As the microwave sintering time increases, <b>barium</b> zirconate <b>titanate</b> ceramics become more uniform and the grain size increases. The Curie temperature of the samples sintered at 2. 5 kW for 15 min, 20 min and 30 min is- 20 oC,- 10 oC and- 15 oC, respectively. As the microwave sintering time increases, the dielectric constant of <b>barium</b> zirconate <b>titanate</b> ceramics decreases initially and then increases, and the dielectric loss decreases. Moreover, the remnant polarization of the sample increases initially and then decreases, and the coercive electric field decreases as the microwave sintering time increases...|$|R

25|$|Together with MIT's Radiation Lab, von Hippel and his {{collaborators}} helped to develop radar technology during the war. He was awarded the President's Certificate of Merit in 1948 by U.S. President Harry Truman.

25|$|During World War II, {{independent}} research {{groups in the}} United States, Russia, and Japan discovered {{a new class of}} synthetic materials, called ferroelectrics, which exhibited piezoelectric constants many times higher than natural materials.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the processing, modelling and {{results of a}} resonant element made from ultra high permittivity dielectric material shaped into a helix. The ceramic helix was made from bulk <b>barium</b> strontium <b>titanate</b> and was produced by viscous plastic processing (VPP). A 1. 2 turn and 1. 75 turn helix was produced and measured to validate the electromagnetic modelling results. Some of the helices studied in this work are very compact. An optimised device may possess moderate Q factors, due to the low filling factors. The dielectric loss and permittivity of the bulk <b>barium</b> strontium <b>titanate</b> were also measured at microwave frequencies.

25|$|Zinc oxide (ZnO)–Wurtzite structure. While single {{crystals}} of ZnO are piezoelectric and pyroelectric, polycrystalline (ceramic) ZnO with randomly oriented grains exhibits neither piezoelectric nor pyroelectric effect. Not being ferroelectric, polycrystalline ZnO {{cannot be}} poled like <b>barium</b> <b>titanate</b> or PZT.

40|$|In {{this article}} a new {{acceleration}} sensor using flexoelectric <b>barium</b> strontium <b>titanate</b> cantilever was designed, fabricated, and tested for vibration monitoring. The flexoelectric sensors were configured as a trapezoidal unimorph with a <b>barium</b> strontium <b>titanate</b> layer bonded onto a steel substrate. Seismic mass {{was attached to}} the unimorph tip to amplify the transverse flexoelectric response of the <b>barium</b> strontium <b>titanate</b> layer. The theoretical model was developed and validated by vibration tests using the prototyped flexoelectric unimorph. The prototyped accelerometer with thickness of 0. 1 mm and length and width in millimeters showed a stable sensitivity of 0. 84 pC/g over the frequency range of 100 Hz- 1. 6 kHz. The aging property of the flexoelectric material was demonstrated to be much better than that of the reported piezoelectric materials right after poling. Scaling effect analysis was also performed for flexoelectric unimorphs.

500|$|A {{piezoelectric}} {{material is}} one which changes shape when an electric field is applied. In reverse, it produces an electric field {{when it is}} distorted. A piezoelectric transducer, in essence, is made simply by plating electrodes on to the piezoelectric material. Early piezoelectric materials used in transducers such as <b>barium</b> <b>titanate</b> had poor temperature stability. [...] This precluded the transducer from functioning {{as one of the}} resonators; {{it had to be a}} separate component. [...] This problem was solved with the introduction of lead zirconate titanate (abbreviated PZT) which is stable enough to be used as a resonator. Another common piezoelectric material is quartz, which has also been used in mechanical filters. [...] However, ceramic materials such as PZT are preferred for their greater electromechanical coupling coefficient.|$|E
2500|$|Most PTC {{thermistors}} {{are made}} from doped polycrystalline ceramic (containing <b>barium</b> <b>titanate</b> (BaTiO3) and other compounds) which have the property that their resistance rises suddenly at a certain critical temperature. <b>Barium</b> <b>titanate</b> is ferroelectric and its dielectric constant varies with temperature. [...] Below the Curie point temperature, the high dielectric constant prevents the formation of potential barriers between the crystal grains, leading to a low resistance. [...] In this region the device has a small negative temperature coefficient. [...] At the Curie point temperature, the dielectric constant drops sufficiently to allow the formation of potential barriers at the grain boundaries, and the resistance increases sharply with temperature. [...] At even higher temperatures, the material reverts to NTC behaviour.|$|E
2500|$|Ferroelectric phase {{transitions}} {{are often}} characterized as either displacive (such as BaTiO3) or order-disorder (such as NaNO2), though often phase transitions will demonstrate {{elements of both}} behaviors. In <b>barium</b> <b>titanate,</b> a typical ferroelectric of the displacive type, the transition can {{be understood in terms}} of a polarization catastrophe, in which, if an ion is displaced from equilibrium slightly, the force from the local electric fields due to the ions in the crystal increases faster than the elastic-restoring forces. This leads to an asymmetrical shift in the equilibrium ion positions and hence to a permanent dipole moment. The ionic displacement in <b>barium</b> <b>titanate</b> concerns the relative position of the titanium ion within the oxygen octahedral cage. [...] In lead titanate, another key ferroelectric material, although the structure is rather similar to <b>barium</b> <b>titanate</b> the driving force for ferroelectricity is more complex with interactions between the lead and oxygen ions also playing an important role. In an order-disorder ferroelectric, there is a dipole moment in each unit cell, but at high temperatures they are pointing in random directions. Upon lowering the temperature and going through the phase transition, the dipoles order, all pointing in the same direction within a domain.|$|E

2500|$|Barrier layer ceramic {{capacitors}} {{are made}} of doped ferroelectric materials such as <b>barium</b> <b>titanate</b> (...)

2500|$|Class 2 {{capacitors}} {{are made}} of ferroelectric materials such as <b>barium</b> <b>titanate</b> (...) and suitable additives such as aluminium silicate, magnesium silicate and aluminium oxide.

It depends on temperature and voltage applied. Additionally class 2 capacitors age over time.|$|E
2500|$|The {{standard}} US Navy scanning sonar {{at the end}} of the World War II operated at 18kHz, {{using an}} array of ADP crystals. Desired longer range, however, required use of lower frequencies. The required dimensions were too big for ADP crystals, so in the early 1950s magnetostrictive and <b>barium</b> <b>titanate</b> piezoelectric systems were developed, but these had problems achieving uniform impedance characteristics, and the beam pattern suffered. <b>Barium</b> <b>titanate</b> was then replaced with more stable lead zirconate titanate (PZT), and the frequency was lowered to 5kHz. The US fleet used this material in the AN/SQS-23 sonar for several decades. The SQS-23 sonar first used magnetostrictive nickel transducers, but these weighed several tons, and nickel was expensive and considered a critical material; piezoelectric transducers were therefore substituted. The sonar was a large array of 432 individual transducers. At first, the transducers were unreliable, showing mechanical and electrical failures and deteriorating soon after installation; they were also produced by several vendors, had different designs, and their characteristics were different enough to impair the array's performance. The policy to allow repair of individual transducers was then sacrificed, and [...] "expendable modular design", sealed non-repairable modules, was chosen instead, eliminating the problem with seals and other extraneous mechanical parts.|$|E

2500|$|Higher {{capacitance}} {{values for}} ceramic capacitors can be attained by using mixtures of ferroelectric materials like <b>barium</b> <b>titanate</b> together with specific oxides.
