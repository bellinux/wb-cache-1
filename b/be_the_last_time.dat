5|$|A Jo Tessem {{equaliser}} for Southampton {{earned the}} visitors a point against Arsenal on 2 February 2002; in hindsight this proved to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>time</b> they dropped {{points in the}} league season. Wiltord scored the winning goal against Everton and Arsenal moved back to second place, which was obtained by Liverpool, following a 4–1 win at home to Fulham.|$|E

5|$|In 1958, the British Empire and Commonwealth Games {{were held}} in Cardiff. The event was (to date) the biggest {{sporting}} event ever held in Wales; however, {{it would not have}} been possible without the financial support given by the WRU and the Cardiff Athletic Club. Both the opening and closing ceremonies took place at Cardiff Arms Park, plus all the track and field events, on what had been the greyhound track. It would turn out to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>time</b> that South Africa would participate in the Games until 1994. South Africa withdrew from the Commonwealth Games in 1961.|$|E
5|$|Portland had {{strongly}} desired Washington, {{and their}} general manager Stu Inman, {{was a close}} friend of Pete Newell's. Inman had worked hard through Newell to let Washington know that they intended this to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>time</b> he was traded. This was important as the media coverage and re-locations had been hard on Pat and the children. To his great relief, the city of Portland welcomed Washington with open arms. Portland had one of the more rabid fan bases in the league, and everywhere Washington went he was treated like a beloved celebrity.|$|E

5|$|On 21 July 2007 Fowler {{signed a}} two-year {{contract}} {{to play for}} Cardiff City. He missed the season's opening fixtures {{due to a lack}} of fitness, making his debut in a League Cup tie on 28 August. He scored his first two Cardiff goals on 22 September against Preston North End, scoring with two headers. Fowler scored twice in his next game, a third round League Cup tie against West Brom, which Cardiff won 4–2. This led to a fourth round tie against Fowler's former club Liverpool, at Anfield, to which even the Liverpool faithful crowd urged Fowler to score seeing that it may <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>time</b> he would play in Anfield but Cardiff were knocked out in a 2–1 defeat.|$|E
5|$|The Doctor {{finds his}} changes to Kazran's past have locked him {{out from the}} spire's controls, but the Doctor devises a solution: by having Abigail sing through {{one half of the}} broken sonic screwdriver, the other half, still in the shark, will {{resonate}} in the atmosphere and disrupt the storm to allow the ship to land safely. Kazran releases Abigail knowing this will <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>time,</b> but Abigail understands and believes it is time for them to share a Christmas Day. The plan works successfully, and the resulting cloud break-out creates snowfall that falls around the city. As the Doctor rejoins Amy and Rory and prepares to take young Kazran back to the past, old Kazran and Abigail enjoy one last shark-led carriage-ride together.|$|E
5|$|The French and American armies {{marched through}} Philadelphia from September 2 to the 4th, where the American {{soldiers}} announced {{they would not}} leave Maryland until they received one month's pay in coin, {{rather than in the}} worthless Continental paper currency. General Rochambeau generously loaned Washington half of his supply of gold Spanish coins. This would <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>time</b> the men would be paid. It significantly strengthened French and American relations On September 5, Washington learned of the arrival of de Grasse's fleet off the Virginia Capes. De Grasse debarked his French troops to join Lafayette, and then sent his empty transports to pick up the American troops. Washington made a visit to his home, Mount Vernon, on his way to Yorktown.|$|E

5|$|The latter {{years of}} the 19th century was East Stirlingshire's most {{successful}} era in the Scottish Cup. In the 1888–89 and 1890–91 tournaments, the club reached the quarter-finals in what was to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>time</b> for 91 years, losing to Celtic and Hearts respectively. In the 1888–89 tournament, the club recorded its highest win and equalled it in successive rounds with a 10–1 victory against local rivals Stenhousemuir {{in the first round}} and an 11–2 win over Vale of Bannock in the second round. It was during this period that four East Stirlingshire players earned international caps for their countries. The first was the Wales national team captain, Humphrey Jones, who earned five caps whilst with the club. Three other players, David Alexander, Archibald Ritchie, and James McKie made appearances for the Scotland national team from 1891 to 1898.|$|E
5|$|The two cruisers {{ordered in}} the 1905–1906 program {{represented}} a continuation in the slow, upward trend in displacement, {{though the two}} ships had the same top speed as the earlier Königsberg-class ships. Like the preceding classes, one ship was equipped with turbine engines, and one with reciprocating machinery; this was to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>time</b> a German cruiser utilized the older triple-expansion engines. All subsequent designs adopted steam turbines universally. Dresden and Emden had very active and short careers. Both vessels served on foreign stations {{for the majority of}} their careers; Emden was assigned to the East Asia Squadron after she entered service, and Dresden spent much time off the North American Atlantic coast.|$|E
5|$|After {{completing}} the reconstruction, Kaiser Friedrich III {{was assigned to}} the Reserve Formation of the Baltic, spending most of the year out of service. She was reactivated for the annual fleet maneuvers in August and September 1910 with what had since been reorganized as the Hochseeflotte (High Seas Fleet). The ship was recommissioned on 2 August and assigned to the III Battle Squadron, serving as the flagship of Vizeadmiral Max Rollmann, who came aboard four days later. The squadron was disbanded after the maneuvers on 8 September, and Kaiser Friedrich III was decommissioned again on 15 September. The ship spent most of 1911 in reserve as well, being activated only for the annual fleet maneuvers. After recommissioning on 31 July, she briefly served as the flagship of the deputy commander of the III Squadron, Konteradmiral Heinrich Saß. The ships initially trained individually before joining the rest of the fleet on 17 August. The maneuvers lasted until 11 September, after which Kaiser Friedrich III was decommissioned yet again. This proved to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>time</b> the ship would be activated before the outbreak of World War I in July 1914. She and her sister ships were removed from the Reserve Formation in May 1912, having been replaced by the Wittelsbach-class vessels.|$|E

5|$|After embarking from Tynemouth, Harald and Tostig {{probably}} {{landed at}} the River Tees. They then entered Cleveland, and started plundering the coast. They encountered the first resistance at Scarborough, where Harald's demand for surrender was opposed. In the end, Harald resorted to burning down {{the town and}} this action led to other Northumbrian towns surrendering to him. After further raiding, Harald and Tostig sailed down the Humber, disembarking at Riccall. News of the invasion soon reached the earls Morcar of Northumbria and Edwin of Mercia, and they fought against Harald's invading army two miles (3km) south of York at the Battle of Fulford on 20 September. The battle was a decisive victory for Harald and Tostig, and led York to surrender to their forces on 24 September. This would <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>time</b> a Scandinavian army defeated English forces. The same day as York surrendered to Harald and Tostig, Harold Godwinson arrived with his army in Tadcaster, just seven miles from the anchored Norwegian fleet at Riccall. From there, he probably scouted the Norwegian fleet, preparing a surprise attack. As Harald had left no forces in York, Harold Godwinson marched right through the town to Stamford Bridge.|$|E
5|$|Early in {{the second}} quarter, McCarron threw a 67-yard {{touchdown}} pass to DeAndrew White for a 17–14 lead. However, this would <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>time</b> the Crimson Tide led in the game {{as a pair of}} turnovers by the Crimson Tide later in the quarter directly resulted in a pair of Oklahoma touchdowns. After the Sooners tied the game with a 47-yard Michael Hunnicutt field goal, Geneo Grissom recovered a Yeldon fumble at their eight-yard line and returned it to the 34. Seven plays later Knight threw a 43-yard touchdown pass to Saunders for a 24–17 Oklahoma lead. On the next offensive series, McCarron threw his second interception of the game to Zack Sanchez who returned it to the Alabama 13-yard line. On the next play, Sterling Shepard extended the Sooners' lead to 31–17 with his 13-yard touchdown run. The Crimson Tide was able to get into field goal range late, but Foster missed an attempt from 32-yards as time expired for the first half.|$|E
5|$|Five {{days after}} {{the closing of the}} Montreal Forum, the Canadiens played its first game at the Molson Centre (since renamed the Bell Centre). With a {{capacity}} of 22,500, the Bell Centre claims to be the largest indoor arena in North America. In the inaugural game, Montreal defeated the Rangers 4–2, with the first goal scored by Vincent Damphousse. The Canadiens qualified for the playoffs but struggled to achieve playoff success in the new arena during the arena's first three seasons. The Habs were eliminated {{in the first round of}} the playoffs by the Rangers in six games in 1996 and by the New Jersey Devils in 1997, respectively. In 1998, they won their first playoff series since their 1993 championship by defeating the Pittsburgh Penguins in six games; however, they would get swept by the Buffalo Sabres in the second round of the playoffs. It would <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>time</b> the Canadiens would win a playoff series until 2002.|$|E

However, {{on his way to}} school, Pinocchio is led astray by Honest John the Fox and his companion, Gideon the Cat, who {{convince}} him to join Stromboli's puppet show, despite Jiminy's objections. Pinocchio becomes Stromboli's star attraction as a marionette who can sing and dance without strings. However, when Pinocchio wants to go home for the night, Stromboli locks him in a birdcage. Jiminy arrives to see Pinocchio, and is unable to free him. The Blue Fairy appears, and asks Pinocchio why he was not at school. Jiminy urges Pinocchio to tell the truth, but instead he starts telling lies, which causes his nose to grow longer and longer. Pinocchio vows to be good from now on, and the Blue Fairy returns his nose to its original form and sets him free, while warning him that this will <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>time</b> she can help him.|$|E
5|$|Myrmecia {{has been}} {{classified}} into numerous families and subfamilies; in 1858 British entomologist Frederick Smith {{placed it in}} the family Poneridae, subfamily Myrmicidae. It {{was placed in the}} subfamily Ponerinae by Austrian entomologist Gustav Mayr in 1862. This classification was short-lived, as Mayr reclassified the genus into the subfamily Myrmicinae three years later. In 1877, Italian entomologist Carlo Emery classified the genus into the newly established subfamily Myrmeciidae, family Myrmicidae. Smith, who had originally established Myrmicidae as a family in 1851, reclassified it as a subfamily in 1858. He would again treat it as a family in 1871. Swiss myrmecologist Auguste Forel initially treated Poneridae as a subfamily and classified Myrmecia as one of its constituent genera, but later placed it in Ponerinae. William H. Ashemad placed the genus in the subfamily Myrmeciinae in 1905, but it was later placed back in Ponerinae in 1910 by American entomologist William Morton Wheeler. In 1954, Myrmecia was placed into Myrmeciinae; this would <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>time</b> the genus would be placed into a different ant subfamily.|$|E
5|$|Pierce {{tied for}} the league lead in {{complete}} games each year from 1956 to 1958, and was again selected for the All-Star team each year from 1957 to 1959 and again in 1961, although he only appeared in the 1957 game in which he retired his first five batters before allowing three runs. On June 11, 1959 he pitched his fourth and final one-hitter, a 3–1 victory at Washington in which he allowed only a third-inning double by Ron Samford, who scored after three two-out walks, the last to Harmon Killebrew; the White Sox won on a two-run double {{in the ninth inning}} by Jim Landis off Senators starter Camilo Pascual. Pierce had the longest outing of his career on August 6 in a road game against the Orioles, pitching 16 innings in a contest that ended in a 1–1 tie after 18 frames; it proved to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>time</b> in his career that he pitched into extra innings. After losing his next two starts, pulling a back muscle and straining the ligaments in his right hip against the Kansas City Athletics in the third inning on August 15, he was out of action until a 2–1 win over Kansas City on September 7.|$|E
