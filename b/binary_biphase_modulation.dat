C. <b>Binary</b> {{antipodal}} direct-sequence <b>biphase</b> <b>modulation</b> {{is employed}} (for {{the purpose of}} interference reduction) over a channel disturbed by white noise and an "external" coherent sinusoidal interference. Before these are added, the signal suffers distortion {{in the form of}} linear filtering whose effects are to be determined. The receiver is a coherent "rematched filter" (matched to the distorted signal). The mean and variance of the detection variable are expressed as an output SNR (signal to noise ratio). The variance is the sum of three components: due to noise, external interference, and self interference. Concise formulas for the first two contributions are developed. The third is approximated and found to be quite small in many cases of interest. Results are applied in the case in which the filter has a bandpass characteristic and external interference is dominant. With fixed signal power entering the filter, there is an optimal chip rate above which filter distortion effects increase faster than process gain; the optimal chip rate is approximately equal to the filter noise bandwidth B (Hertz). For an ideal bandpass filter and a single pole bandpass filter, the optimal chip rates are 1. 0 B and 0. 95 B, respectively...|$|R

40|$|A low {{probability}} of intercept (LPI), or low {{probability of}} detection (LPD) communication technique known as cyclic code shift keying (CCSK) is described. We discuss the basic concepts of CCSK and describe a system based {{on the use of}} random or pseudorandom codes for <b>biphase</b> <b>modulation.</b> We use simulation to show that the bit error rate (BER) for CCSK can be closely estimated by using existing equations that apply to M-ary orthogonal signaling (MOS). Also, we show that significantly fewer computations are required for CCSK than for MOS when the number of bits per symbol is the same. We show that using <b>biphase</b> <b>modulation</b> results in waveforms that have a large time-bandwidth product and very low input signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and thus inherently have an LPI by a radiometer. We evaluate detection by a radiometer and show that LPI can be achieved by using codes of lengths greater than about 2 12 (i. e. ...|$|R
40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 13 - 15, 1981 / Bahia Hotel, San Diego, CaliforniaThe {{polarity}} {{uncertainty in}} coherent demodulation of biphase signal raises a new {{question to the}} application of error-correcting codes. In this paper the real capability of errorcorrecting codes used with differential <b>biphase</b> <b>modulation</b> is analysed and, with the special cases of cyclic Hamming codes and two BCH codes, the degree of performance deterioration is estimated. Three methods for solving polarity inversion with preserving the error-correcting capability {{at the cost of}} one information bit lost are proposed. Practical implementation of these methods is briefly discussed...|$|R
40|$|Abstract â€” The {{information}} theoretic {{capacity of}} a single-user ultra-wideband (UWB) communications is investigated for various modulations under specific UWB regimes: low power spectral density, large spreading ratio, and a highly dispersive channel. We demonstrate that <b>biphase</b> <b>modulation</b> provides the best performance among several studied formats. The performance loss due to a fixed low coding rate is negligible in the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime. It is shown that capacity {{can be obtained by}} fixing the spreading ratio and allowing the coding rate to vary. However, little is lost by employing a distancedependent spreading ratio {{in the presence of a}} fixed coding rate. I...|$|R

One such opportunity includes the augmentation {{of the communication}} ADS-B signal with a random <b>biphase</b> <b>modulation</b> for concurrent use as a radar signal. This paper addresses the formulation and analysis of a suitable noncooperative multitarget tracking method for the ADS-B radar system using radar ranging techniques and particle filter algorithms. In addition, the low-update-rate measurement due to the ADS-B system specification is discussed {{in order to provide}} acceptable estimation results.

An investigation is conducted concerning the possibility to obtain a similar performance improvement for an unbalanced quadriphase-shift-keying (QPSK) modulation. It is found that the biphase Costas loop {{can be used as}} an efficient demodulator of QPSK in cases in which the ratio of data rates is of the same order of magnitude as the inverse of the power ratio. These cases involve approximately equal signal energies in the two channels...|$|R
40|$|<b>Biphase</b> <b>modulation</b> in an embedded-servo {{format for}} hard-disk drives is investigated. It is shown that for biphase, {{at the low}} linear densities typical of servo information, near-maximum-likelihood {{performance}} can be attained by a simple bit detector consisting of a full-response linear equalizer and a binary slicer. Compared to the commonly used method of dibit coding, a signal-to-noise ratio gain of some 4 dB is achieved. The same equalizer {{may be used as}} the basis for near-maximum-likelihood position error signal amplitude estimation and timing recovery. Simulations of a practical servo demodulator based on a fifth-order analog filter show that at typical linear densities, this ideal performance is closely approached. The equalizer has a band-pass character and yields excellent suppression of the effects of thermal asperities and magneto-resistive head asymmetr...|$|R

The basic constraints and capabilities of a low-noise ground receiving system are covered in detail, including antenna temperature contributions from galactic noise, tropospheric and ionospheric attenuation, and earth radiation through antenna side lobes. Low-noise preamplifiers, large high-gain antennas, and narrow-band phase-lock receivers are also considered. Digital <b>biphase</b> <b>modulation,</b> used in Pioneer V, is compared with more sophisticated bi-orthogonal coding systems. Both types of coding systems are compared with error rate as a parameter, with the ideal error-free Shannon limit. The design of Pioneer V and its record of achievement are described. Included are explanations of the coherent transponder within the spacecraft, and of the command transmitter and telemetry reception equipment at the ground stations. 1...|$|R

These pulses have to follow strict regulations concerning power and spectrum restrictions defined by local authorities, like the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) [2] in the USA. Because of power and spectral properties of the transmitted IR-UWB pulses, different types of orthogonal pulse shapes are used to provide a higher spectral efficiency [3, 4]. Derivation of the Gaussian pulse and modified Hermite pulses (MHPs), usually called Hermites [5], provides {{a wide range of}} various pulse combinations for IR-UWB transmission and for that reason they are most commonly used as pulse shapes. The state of art in IR-UWB systems is presented by many applicable modulation techniques like Pulse Amplitude Modulation (PAM), PPM, Pulse Shape Modulation (PSM), on-off-keying (OOK), and <b>biphase</b> <b>modulation</b> (BPM). A combination of the exposed modulation techniques (hybrid techniques) can provide system improvements in terms of the error probability, a higher data rate, a less complex receiver, or less power consumption. Many hybrid techniques for IR-UWB communication systems have been applied recently, such as Pulse Position Amplitude Modulation (PPAM) [6], Biorthogonal Pulse Position Modulation (BPPM) [7], OOK-PSM [8], PPM-PSM [9], and hybrid Shape-Amplitude Modulation [10, 11]. Regarding pulse amplitudes, positions, and shapes, three types of modulations can be distinguished. In PAM and OOK modulation information is contained in the amplitude of the signal, PPM uses the position of the pulse to convey information, whereas in PSM, information is conveyed {{in the shape of the}} pulse.|$|R
40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 22 - 25, 1984 / Riviera Hotel, Las Vegas, NevadaIn a phase-locked PM demodulator, {{the input}} signal is {{modulated}} by a periodic waveform, {{particularly when the}} loop bandwidth {{is less than the}} sideband to carrier spacing, and thus discrete sidebands are apt to appear about the carrier frequency. This frequently results in a sideband locking instead of phase-locking to a selected carrier and aided-acquisition is then required. Conventional techniques such as discriminator-aided-acquisition have been implemented by MostromÂ¹ and Victor et al. Â² to correct this problem, however, this approach necessitates a large carrier to noise ratio (CNR) in the bandwidth of the discriminator. The current study describes a novel approach to extend the threshold for a phase-locked loop designed for Hartman Systemsâ€™ telemetry receiver. By phase remodulating the error signal, the network reduces the phase swing of the signal and restores the carrier power so as to provide anti-sideband properties for <b>biphase</b> and PM <b>modulation</b> up to 1. 3 radians deviation at all modulation frequencies and at a signal level where CNR is greater than 5 dB above PM threshold...|$|R

New methods of generating non linear chirp waveforms and of improving their Doppler tolerance has been investigated by Doerry Further studies of Hyperbolic chirps have been carried out by Kiss, Readhead, Nagajyothi and Rajarajeswari and Yang and Sarkar. Convolution windows have been investigated by Sahoo and Panda who show that they can result in very low sidelobes yet be Doppler tolerant, but may suffer from some pulse broadening. [...] Wen and his co-workers have also discussed convolution windows. Some new window functions have been proposed by Samad and Sinha and Ferreira, which claim improved performance over the familiar functions. Several techniques to lower the sidelobe levels of the compressed pulses for non-linear FM chirps are compared by Varshney and Thomas.In a paper by Vizitui, sidelobe reduction is considered where phase pre-distortion is applied to non-linear FM chirps, rather than to linear chirps. Lower sidelobes and some improvement in Doppler tolerance is claimed.There have been extensive investigations of phase modulation for pulse compression schemes, such as <b>biphase</b> (<b>binary</b> Phase shift keying) and polyphase coding methods, but this work is not considered here.|$|R
