50|$|In sewing, bar tack, {{also written}} bar-tack or <b>bartack,</b> {{refers to a}} series of {{stitches}} used to reinforce areas of a garment that may be subject to stress or additional wear. Typical areas for bar tack stitches include pocket openings, buttonholes, belt loops, the bottom of a fly opening, tucks, pleats and the corners of collars. Bar tacks may be sewn by hand, using whip stitches, or by machine, using zigzag stitches. The process for sewing a bar tack is essentially to sew several long, narrowly-spaced stitches along the line of the bar that will be formed, followed by short stitches made perpendicular to the long stitches, through the fabric and over the bar. The bar commonly varies between 1/16 to 1/8 in in width and 1/4 to 3/8 in in length. In some garments, such as jeans, the bar tack will be sewn in a contrasting color.|$|E
50|$|Thread weight {{conversion}} tableFor example: 40 weight = 225 denier = Tex 25. A common Tex {{number for}} general sewing thread is Tex 25 or Tex 30. A slightly heavier silk buttonhole thread suitable for <b>bartacking,</b> small leather items, and decorative seams might be Tex 40. A strong, durable upholstery thread, Tex 75. A heavy duty topstitching thread for coats, bags, and shoes, Tex 100. A very strong topstitching thread suitable for luggage and tarpaulins, Tex 265-Tex 290. But a fine serging thread, only Tex 13. For blindstitching and felling machines, an even finer Tex 8.|$|R
40|$|This {{cooperative}} research work {{is concerned with}} the development of fall arrest equipment constructed from textile materials for use in mountaineering, caving and industrial safety applications. The range of webbings available for use in fall arrest equipment is examined, and some basic experiments to determine the effect of severe abrasion are described. The methods of stitching slings (loops of webbing) are examined, and the effects of external abrasion on conventional lap joints and <b>bartacked</b> joints are compared. The development of harnesses is examined and the factors affecting their future design are considered. The major part of the work {{is concerned with the}} way in which the energy of a falling body is absorbed in a fall arrest system and with the peak impact loads imposed on the system's components. To measure these loads, apparatus was developed at the cooperating company's premises, together with appropriate instrumentation. A series of tests were carried out to determine loads in falls of increasing severity. The ensuing development work concerned textile shock absorbers, which are designed to limit the impact force in a fall to a predetermined maximum. Using the drop test apparatus, it was shown that such shock absorbers have very little practical effect in a climbing situation. However, the principles embodied in these devices were used to develop an industrial safety lanyard with an integral shock absorber which conforms to British Standard 1397. This device is lighter and more compact than others currently on the market and represents a step forward in the field. ...|$|R
