A number of studies have indicated that as birth order increases IQ decreases with first <b>borns</b> having especially superior intelligence.

40|$|The {{influence}} of birth order on personality {{has been studied}} for several decades, but {{little research has been}} conducted on the association between sibling position and risk tolerance. The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine the relationship between being an only child and risk-taking attitudes. Data from the 2010 National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, 1979 sample was used to test the hypotheses that only children and first <b>borns</b> are similar, only children exhibit a lower risk tolerance when compared to those with siblings, and only children exhibit a lower risk tolerance when compared to those with siblings when first <b>borns</b> are removed and only <b>borns</b> are compared with later <b>borns.</b> Results did show that only children are similar to first <b>borns</b> in nearly every domain of risk tolerance considered. Furthermore, they do not exhibit dramatically different risk attitudes than those with siblings when the variables of sex, locus of control, and net worth are controlled...|$|R
