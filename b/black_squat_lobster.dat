50|$|Allogalathea elegans (known as {{the feather}} star <b>squat</b> <b>lobster,</b> crinoid <b>squat</b> <b>lobster</b> or elegant <b>squat</b> <b>lobster)</b> is {{a species of}} <b>squat</b> <b>lobster</b> that is {{sometimes}} kept in marine aquariums.|$|R
2500|$|In early classifications, <b>squat</b> <b>lobsters</b> {{were placed}} {{together}} in the superfamily Galatheoidea alongside the porcelain crabs of the family Porcellanidae. In the early 21st century, however, {{the assumption that the}} various families of <b>squat</b> <b>lobster</b> were closely related began to be questioned. Although superficially similar, there were few morphological characteristics that united the <b>squat</b> <b>lobsters</b> to the exclusion of other families in the Anomura. With extensive DNA sequence data, it is now accepted that <b>squat</b> <b>lobsters</b> do not make up a single, monophyletic group. Rather, the Chirostylidae and Kiwaidae are only relatively distantly related to the other <b>squat</b> <b>lobsters,</b> and are closer to hermit crabs and king crabs (Paguroidea), the mole crabs in the superfamily Hippoidea, and the small families Lomisidae and Aeglidae. <b>Squat</b> <b>lobsters</b> are therefore divided among two superfamilies: ...|$|R

50|$|Pleuroncodes monodon, {{sometimes}} called the red <b>squat</b> <b>lobster,</b> is a species of <b>squat</b> <b>lobster</b> from the south-eastern Pacific Ocean, where it {{is the subject of}} commercial fishery alongside the species Cervimunida johni.|$|R
2500|$|In Central America, {{the primary}} species of <b>squat</b> <b>lobster</b> {{targeted}} by fisheries is {{a species of}} Pleuroncodes. There {{is a great deal}} of confusion over both scientific names and common names, and the exact species is often unknown. In El Salvador, the commercial catch is generally referred to as [...] "P.planipes", but is in fact P.monodon, for instance. Commercial fishing for <b>squat</b> <b>lobsters</b> in El Salvador began in the early 1980s; production increased markedly in the 2001 season, and has continued to grow, now making up 98% of the demersal resources landed in El Salvador, with annual catches peaking at 13,708t in 2005. In Costa Rica, aggregations of <b>squat</b> <b>lobsters</b> are avoided, as the fishermen fear the <b>squat</b> <b>lobsters</b> will clog their nets. In Nicaragua, <b>squat</b> <b>lobsters</b> are heavily exploited, especially following a large increase in fishing effort in the 2007 season. In Panama, production reached 492t in 2008. Chilean <b>squat</b> <b>lobster</b> fisheries initially targeted Cervimunida johni, beginning in 1953. By the mid-1960s, effort had largely switched to P.monodon. In an effort to conserve stocks, the Chilean government instituted quotas for <b>squat</b> <b>lobsters,</b> and the fishery is closely monitored. In New Zealand, Munida gregaria has been considered as a potential fisheries resource, particularly to feed farmed Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha).|$|R

40|$|The topographically complex deep seabed on the Mauritanian slope, from 990 to 1460 m water depth, was imaged {{with video}} in an {{extensive}} quantitative survey of 17, 199 m 2 of seafloor using a Remote Operated Vehicle (ROV). This {{study investigated the}} influence of habitat heterogeneity at two scales on the megafaunal assemblages observed by ROV. Changes in megafaunal assemblages on the Mauritanian slope were assessed at a broad scale, within depth zones, and at a finer scale, in response to changes in local geomorphology associated with submarine landslides. Geomorphology was determined by classification of habitat parameters (slope, aspect, bathymetric position, curvature, fractal dimension and ruggedness) derived from an autonomous underwater vehicle-based multibeam bathymetry survey. Habitat parameters were classified by Iterative Self Organizing Clustering into six major geomorphological groups, four of which were assessed in the ROV video survey. A total of 29 megafaunal taxa were observed along the entire survey, with an overall average faunal density of 0. 344 ind m− 2. Megafaunal assemblage density, species richness and evenness varied significantly across the depth range of the survey in the most common geomorphological zone (sedimentary plains of low slope and complexity). Characteristic species inhabited the shallow areas (asteroid, ophiuroid, anemone, small macrourid), intermediate areas (Benthothuria funabris, <b>black</b> cerianthid, <b>squat</b> <b>lobster)</b> and deeper areas (the holothurians Enypniastes eximia and Elipidia echinata). Megafaunal density, species richness and evenness {{were not significantly different}} between geomorphogical groups within one depth zone (1300 – 1400 m). However, the steepest zone, {{on the edge of a}} major headwall feature, had four unique taxa (Parapagurus pilosimanus, a comatulid crinoid, a gorgonian and its associated ophiuroid) ...|$|R
