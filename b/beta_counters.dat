40|$|The most {{traditional}} method {{used to measure}} the lytic activity of cytotoxic T lymphocytes or natural killer (NK) cells is the chromium release assay (CRA). No study has been reported that systematically compares the traditional gamma counting method with various benchtop microplate scintillation formats to measure chromium release. Here we investigated the utilization of microplate <b>beta</b> <b>counters</b> in comparison with the traditional gamma counting method to quantitate antigen-specific cytolysis, lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) activity, and NK activity in the CRA. Supernatants from standard CRA (n = 7) were directly transferred to a 96 -well microplate containing either a solid scintillant (Lumaplate) or a liquid scintillant (flexible beta plate). Samples were quantified by using two benchtop microplate <b>beta</b> <b>counters,</b> Wallac Microbeta Trilux (Lumalux and Trilux methods, respectively) and Packard TopCount instruments (TopCount method). These results were then compared with data from an identical assay run in parallel using the traditional gamma counting method (LKB). The lytic activity for influenza virus-stimulated effectors measured in the benchtop microplate <b>beta</b> <b>counters</b> using Lumalux and Trilux methods exhibited excellent correlations with the one measured in the traditional LKB (r = 0. 967 and 0. 968, respectively). The TopCount method demonstrated a similar correlation (r = 0. 966). Similar findings were observed for LAK and NK activity. The 96 -well microplate format, specifically the dry-scintillant Lumaplates, offers several advantages over the traditional gamma counting format. Most notable are the reductions in sample volume needed and in the total sample preparation and counting time. Furthermore, this system reduces the amount of dry and mixed radioactive waste generated while using the same instrument for gamma- and beta-emitting isotopes...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. For the {{measurement}} of induced activity in the activation foils, various methods and instruments are used. When the activity is measured by using a <b>beta</b> <b>counter</b> {{it is very important}} to know the beta attenuation in the activation foils. The beta attenuation in the foil depends on the beta spectrum of the activation product, the material and the thickness of the material. The beta attenuation has been evaluated theoretically as well as experimentally. The detailed investigations of beta attenuation in the foils are presented in this paper. The experimental study was conducted using an absolute system, the 4 πβ-γ coincidence system. For the various foils like Au, Mn, Co, Al and Mg used in this study, it is found that both theoretical and experimental values for the beta attenuation are matching. The attenuation of betas in the foils varies with beta energy spectrum and the materials and it varies from 7 % to 92 %. The foil activation method is very accurate for the neutron fluence rate measurement. In foil activation method the induced activity is correlated to the neutron fluence rate. This activity is measured using different counters. 4 πβ-ϒ coincidence system is the primary standard for the activity measurement. If the activity is very low this system cannot be used for {{the measurement}}. 4 πβ flow type proportional counters are used for {{the measurement of}} activity. For this the efficiency of the foil should be known accurately. Evaluation of the beta efficiency of different activation foils is discussed in this paper.

50|$|Beta {{blockers}} {{are known}} primarily for their reductive effect on heart rate, {{although this is}} not the only mechanism of action of importance in congestive heart failure. Beta blockers, in addition to their sympatholytic β1 activity in the heart, influence the renin-angiotensin system at the kidneys. Beta blockers cause a decrease in renin secretion, which in turn reduces the heart oxygen demand by lowering extracellular volume and increasing the oxygen-carrying capacity of blood. Heart failure characteristically involves increased catecholamine activity on the heart, which is responsible for a number of deleterious effects, including increased oxygen demand, propagation of inflammatory mediators, and abnormal cardiac tissue remodeling, all of which decrease the efficiency of cardiac contraction and contribute to the low ejection fraction. <b>Beta</b> blockers <b>counter</b> this inappropriately high sympathetic activity, eventually leading to an improved ejection fraction, despite an initial reduction in ejection fraction.|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE 	The {{purpose of}} this thesis was to {{evaluate}} the interaction of a novel glycoprotein, known as proteoglycan 4 (PRG 4), with various commercial contact lenses. METHODS 	 PRG 4 was investigated for its effects on commercial contact lenses. Both bovine PRG 4 and recombinant human PRG 4 (rhPRG 4) were examined on six silicone hydrogels (balafilcon A, senofilcon A, lotrafilcon B, comfilcon A, delefilcon A, narafilcon A) and one conventional hydrogel (etafilcon A). Lens parameters, such as material wettability, bacterial adhesion and viability, and location of sorbed PRG 4, were investigated in the following: •	The effect of PRG 4 on the wettability of both commercially available silicone and conventional hydrogel lens materials was investigated in vitro. Additionally, the substantivity of PRG 4 onto the lens surface was also examined (Chapter 3) •	Using a novel labeling technique, rhPRG 4 was fluorescently tagged and visualized, using confocal microscopy, to elucidate the sorption profile within various commercial lens materials (Chapter 4) •	The antibacterial effect of bovine PRG 4 - and rhPRG 4 -treated lenses was investigated. Staphylococcus aureus was radiolabeled with 3 H-uridine and the bacterial suspension was exposed to various lenses. The total bacterial adhesion was measured by using a <b>Beta</b> <b>counter</b> to detect the 3 H isotope, and viability was determined using an agar plate counting method for each lens type (Chapter 5) RESULTS 	The lens material largely influences how PRG 4 interacts with the contact lens. The presence of a surface treatment and/or ionically charged monomers has {{a significant impact on}} the wettability and sorption of PRG 4. Generally, the incorporation of PRG 4 onto relatively hydrophobic surfaces appears to enhance the surface wettability, though PRG 4 exhibited greater substantivity on relatively hydrophilic surfaces. 	PRG 4 did not demonstrate significant antibacterial properties against S. aureus. However, PRG 4 did not significantly increase bacterial adhesion, even though proteins on lens surfaces are known to attract more bacteria. In addition, it is possible that PRG 4 is denatured to a certain extent within the lens, which may ultimately serve as a source of nutrients for the bacteria to thrive on. Future work is required to investigate this supposition. CONCLUSIONS 	The results from this thesis have demonstrated that PRG 4 can have a significant positive impact on lens material wettability and perhaps other metrics as well, which can possibly translate to enhanced lens wear comfort and lower drop-out rates. Since the lens composition is the major contributing factor in how PRG 4 interacts with the material, lens manufacturers can potentially use this information to develop lenses to better incorporate PRG 4 for various wear modalities. The unique combination of contact lens and PRG 4 is a fairly novel area of research and has the potential for future additional studies...|$|R

Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. 21 -hydroxylase deficiency is the commonest enzyme defect in congenital adrenal hyperplasia resulting in low circulating cortisol and, in severe cases, low aldosterone which may lead to cardiac arrest in the neonate. As the low levels of coitisol· lead to raised levels of adrenocorticotrophic hormone large concentrations of androgens are formed in utero which may lead to cliteromegaly and consequent confusion of the sexes at birth. High concentrations of the androgens give rise to rapid growth in early childhood and early fusion of the epiphyses results in short stature of the adult. 17 -alphahydroxyprogesterone (170 HP) is raised in the blood and saliva of children with 21 -hydroxylase deficiency. 170 HP is commonly measured by radioimmunoassay which limits the assay to being performed by laboratories equipped with <b>beta</b> or gamma <b>counters.</b> The aim of this project was to develop an enzymeimmunoassay which could be carried out using the minimum amount of equipment. Horseradish peroxidase was conjugated to 170 HP-O-carboxymethyloxime using a mixed anhydride reaction. Separation of free and bound label was achieved using a second antibody linked to magnetisable particle solid phase. Measurement of the bound enzyme activity yielded colours which could be compared by eye, with known standards, to give a semi-quantitative assay. Alternatively the absorbance could be measured using a spectrophotometer for full quantitative results. The developed assays were evaluated, comparing the results with radioimmunoassay, and then used for measuring 170 HP in blood and saliva in various clinical situations...|$|R

During exercise, epinephrine, norepinephrine, dopamine and plasma renin activity increased exponentially with the work load, peak values being attained at the highest load or immediately after cessation of exercise. The respective maximal values for plasma renin activity and epinephrine and norepinephrine levels were approximately 3, 6 and 10 fold higher than basal values in the adults, and rose as high as 4, 10 and 20 fold in the boys. Peak dopamine values were only 2 — 3 times higher than the basal values in both adults and boys. It is concluded that the method described provides a suitable tool for a quantitative assessment of adreno-sympathetic tone during physiological and pathophysiological conditions...|$|R
40|$|Aim:Our {{study has}} been {{concerned}} with investigation {{of the effect of}} Calcitonin treatment upon 45 Ca, 32 P and 3 H Colesterol uptake by the rat skeletal, vascular and cardiac muscle. Material and method: Animals: 30 white Wistar rats (150 - 180 g) aged between 6 - 24 months old divided into two groups of 15 rats each have been taken in our study: 15 young and 15 old. Method: Both, young and old rats have received Calcitonin treatment (vials with 0. 5 mg/ml = 0. 25 mg) 0. 025 mg have been injected in each animal. Controls have received injections with physiological saline solution. Rats have been killed by cervical dislocation. Muscle fragments have been collected on ice bath,then weighted and preincubated for one hour at 37 oC in Hanks medium pH 7. After one hour, the muscle fragments have been incubated with 45 Ca(90 Pl/ml). In each sample 10 Pl/sample has been used. Samples have been incubated for 2 hours at 370 C. Nonspecificaly bound radiomarkers have been extracted with 1 N Hcl for 24 hours and then a determination of specific bound radioactivity as well as the extracted one using a beta scintillator in liquid phase. 32 P has been used with a specific activity of 7 mCi/ml, 0. 5 PCi/sample. 3 H Cholesterol has been used also for our experimental studies, with a total activity of 1 mCi. 0. 1 mCi/mlhas been used for working solution using 8 Pl from dilution. The radioactivity has been evaluated with a <b>Beta</b> Betrhold Scintilation <b>Counter.</b> Results: Calcitonin experimentaly administrated has a clear influence upon 45 Ca uptake in muscle tissue. Calcitonin treatment has an influence upon 3 H Cholesterol uptake in skeletal muscle from treated rats versus controls. Conclusions: Our data have an important clinical value in monitoring calcium level in patients in order to avoid cardiac arithmias and vascular perturbations...|$|R
40|$|The Kori No. 1, {{which began}} {{operation}} in 1978, replaced its cask handling crane in 2000. To prove {{the safety of}} recycling and reuse of crane scrap, a particular calculation method for surface contamination was used. Because surface radioactive contamination of steel {{is limited to a}} few-microns-thick layer, we can calculate the total(removable and fixed contamination) activity of the sample conservatively by this surface removal sampling means. If we multiply the ratio of total surface and the area of the selected surface by its activity, total activity of the scrap can be estimated. Conservatively, the sampled portion {{can be used as a}} representative sample of the scrap. Both the inner and outer part of the scrap was sampled separately, and gamma spectra were analyzed to check whether activation had occurred. Before sampling, the entire surface of the steel is scan surveyed by several kinds of GM and GP detectors. Contaminated parts were segregated, or decontaminated to the background. Almost one sample per one ton of steel was collected. Gamma spectra of 62 samples were analyzed by 100 % efficiency HP Ge detector. Only 60 Co was detected, and its highest activity was 0. 01 Bq/g,. This level of activity is much lower than the ''clearance levels'' outlined in IAEA TecDoc- 855. (4). The total alpha and total beta for 6 samples were measured in the laboratory by low background alpha, using a <b>beta</b> gas proportional <b>counter.</b> Activities were much lower than 0. 005 Bq/g. A representative sample was taken from the complete mixture of 62 samples. Gamma activities of nuclides were measured to estimate the dose to the public. This study revealed that activities of nuclides were lower than 'clearance levels' if decontaminated until the lower limit of detection level of the portable field instrument. New surface removal sampling method was tested. This method allows us to easily calculate the specific activity for the solid material...|$|R
