50|$|The {{structure}} of a <b>boiling</b> <b>chip</b> traps liquid while in use, meaning that they cannot be re-used in laboratory setups. They also don't work well under vacuum; if a solution is boiling under vacuum, it's best to constantly stir it instead.|$|R
50|$|Pasteur {{pipettes}} {{can also}} be used for microscale distillation. The liquid to be distilled is placed into a small reaction tube along with a <b>boiling</b> <b>chip</b> and heated to reflux one-half to two-thirds of the way up the inside of the tube. After squeezing the bulb to expel air, a pasteur pipette is inserted into the tube just below the level of the ring of refluxing liquid (into the vapor). The vapor is then drawn into the relatively cold pipette tip, causing it to condense and accumulate inside of the pipette.|$|R

50|$|A boiling chip, boiling stone, or anti-bumping granule is a tiny, {{unevenly}} shaped {{piece of}} substance added to liquids {{to make them}} boil more calmly. <b>Boiling</b> <b>chips</b> are frequently employed in distillation and heating. When a liquid becomes superheated, a particle of dust or a stirring rod can cause flash boiling. This very rapid boiling can be extremely violent and cause reagents to splatter, possibly causing severe burns, ruining experiments, and damaging equipment. <b>Boiling</b> <b>chips</b> work by providing nucleation sites so the liquid boils smoothly without becoming superheated or bumping.|$|E

The heartwood is used to produce dye for wool and cotton cloth and a pink colouring used in pharmaceuticals and toothpaste. The pigments hematoxylin and hematein can be extracted and are complex phenols similar to bioflavonoids. Extracts of hardwood chips are used as remedies by the Tarahumara Indians. Ethnobotanical uses mentioned in [...] "Duke's Phytochemical and Ethnobotanical Databases" [...] includes use as an astringent, a dentifrice, a refrigerant, for treating condyloma, erysipelas, fever, jaundice, inflammation and stomach pain.

50|$|The {{most common}} way of {{preventing}} bumping is by adding {{one or two}} <b>boiling</b> <b>chips</b> to the reaction vessel. However, these alone may not prevent bumping {{and for this reason}} it is advisable to boil liquids in a boiling tube, a boiling flask, or an Erlenmeyer flask. In addition, heating test tubes should never be pointed towards any person, just in case bumping does occur. Whenever a liquid is cooled below its boiling point and re-heated to a boil, a new boiling chip will be needed, as the pores in the old boiling chip tend to fill with solvent, rendering it ineffective.|$|E
50|$|The {{reaction}} flask is heated. <b>Boiling</b> <b>chips</b> within it {{assist with the}} calm formation of bubbles of vapor containing the reaction solvent and the component to be removed. This vapor travels out of {{reaction flask}} up into the condenser where water being circulated around it causes it to cool and drip into the distilling trap. Here, the immiscible liquids separate into layers (water below and solvent above it). When their combined volume reaches {{the level of the}} side-arm, the upper, less-dense layer will begin to flow back to the reactor while the water layer will remain in the trap. The trap will eventually reach capacity when the level of the water in it reaches the level of the side-arm. At this point, the trap must be drained into the receiving flask. The process of evaporation/ condensation/ collection may be continued until it ceases to produce additional amounts of water.|$|E

40|$|International audienceA {{deterministic}} {{exposure assessment}} using the Nusser method that adjusts for within-subject variation and for nuisance effects among Finnish {{children and adults}} was carried out. The food consumption data covered 2, 038 adults (25 - 74 years old) and 1, 514 children of one, three, and six years of age, with the data on foods' acrylamide content obtained from published Finnish studies. We found that acrylamide exposure was highest among the three-year-old children (median: 1. 01 µg / kg bw / day, 97. 5 th percentile: 1. 95 µg / kg bw/ day) and lowest among 65 - 74 -year-old women (median: 0. 31 µg / kg bw/ day, 97. 5 th percentile: 0. 69 µg / kg bw/day). Among adults, the most important source of acrylamide exposure was coffee, followed by casseroles rich in starch, then rye bread. Among children, the most important sources were casseroles rich in starch and, then, biscuits and, finally, chips and other fried potatoes. Replacing lightly roasted coffee with dark roasted, swapping sweet wheat buns for biscuits, and decreasing the acrylamide content of starch-based casseroles and rye bread by 50 % {{would result in a}} 50 % decrease in acrylamide exposure in adults. Among children, substituting <b>boiled</b> potatoes for <b>chips</b> and other friend potatoes and replacing biscuits with sweet wheat buns while lowering the acrylamide content of starch-based casseroles by 50 % would lead to acrylamide exposure that is only half of the original exposure.

50|$|A key {{disadvantage}} in rotary evaporations, besides its single sample nature, {{is the potential}} of some sample types to bump, e.g. ethanol and water, which can result in loss of {{a portion of the}} material intended to be retained. Even professionals experience periodic mishaps during evaporation, especially bumping, though experienced users become aware of the propensity of some mixtures to bump or foam, and apply precautions that help to avoid most such events. In particular, bumping can often be prevented by taking homogeneous phases into the evaporation, by carefully regulating the strength of the vacuum (or the bath temperature) to provide for an even rate of evaporation, or, in rare cases, through use of added agents such as <b>boiling</b> <b>chips</b> (to make the nucleation step of evaporation more uniform). Rotary evaporators can also be equipped with further special traps and condenser arrays that are best suited to particular difficult sample types, including those with the tendency to foam or bump.|$|E

40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the 9 th International Conference on Heat Transfer, Fluid Mechanics and Thermodynamics, Malta, 16 - 18 July, 2012. Cooling technology becomes more important because {{of the increase in}} heat generation density of semiconductor <b>chips.</b> <b>Boiling</b> and two-phase flow is expected {{as one of the most}} effective methods to cool the electronic devices because of its superior heat transfer characteristics. Because the boiling heat transfer depends on the selection of coolant, the development of liquid mixtures and their components optimized for the individual cooling systems becomes very important. Most of the existing researches on nucleate boiling of binary mixtures clarify the heat transfer characteristics peculiar to the miscible ones, while the studies for immiscible mixtures were very limited. Pool boiling experiments on nucleate boiling of immiscible mixture FC 72 /Water are performed in a closed vessel at 0. 1 MPa. The experimental data is acquired under the steady-state conditions at heat flux ranging from those for the boiling incipience to CHF or to the highest possible value under the restriction of the available cooling. Before the experiments, the height of liquid layers on the horizontal heating surface is kept at a constant value of 100 mm, and the thickness of FC 72 layer above the heating surface is varied at three different values of 5 mm, 10 mm and 50 mm. A new phenomena of “intermediate burnout” due to the evaporation of FC 72 is observed provided that the layer thickness of FC 72 is not large. At heat flux higher than that for intermediate burnout, the immiscible mixture decreases the surface temperature from that for pure water and simultaneously increases CHF. The immiscible mixture has a potential to realize high performance heat exchange systems by the self-sustaining subcooling of components under the constant system pressure. dc 201...|$|R
30|$|Comparing results (Table 2), {{obtained}} by the QUENCHER method and the results from extracts, {{it can be seen}} that the yellow tea and the green tea had higher antioxidant activity {{obtained by}} the direct application of free radicals, while for the black tea, higher antioxidant activity was obtained when the extraction was used prior determination of the antioxidant activity. Evaluating extracts, higher antioxidant activity was obtained by application of the ABTS˙+ free radicals. Results of the QUENCHER method had a different tendency. Only antioxidant activity of the black tea was higher when the ABTS˙+ free radicals were used, while the green tea had almost the same values, and the yellow tea leaves had higher antioxidant activity when the DPPH˙ free radicals were used. Pastoriza et al. [26] evaluated antioxidant activity in different foods using the ABTS˙+ free radicals and obtained higher antioxidant values for the most evaluated foods when the QUENCHER method was used in comparison to the extracts. Some exceptions (like fresh carrots, apples, potato <b>chips,</b> <b>boiled</b> ham and salami-type sausage) were noted, and in those samples, higher antioxidant activity was evaluated in extracts. Delgado-Andrade et al. [27] also determined much higher antioxidant activity in the wheat bread and the wheat bran bread by the QUENCHER method for ABTS˙+ and DPPH˙ free radicals than in extracts. Also, they determined that values {{obtained by the}} ABTS˙+ were higher than with the DPPH˙ free radicals. In some cases (like lentil, strawberry, apples, almond, pistachio nut, hazelnut or insoluble fractions of lettuce, orange, lemon, cocoa, biscuits, snacks and bread crust), antioxidant activity determined by the DPPH˙ was similar or higher than with the ABTS˙+, when the QUENCHER method was used [4, 5]. The DPPH˙ has higher solubility in less polar solvents; thus, more reactivity towards lipid-rich containing structures can be expected. The lipid globules in samples could not act as a molecular barrier for DPPH˙ that can reach both the lipophilic and hydrophilic antioxidant compounds presented in the core of the solid particles. The diffusivity phenomenon could be one of the primary explanations for the higher antioxidant activity when using the DPPH˙ compared to the ABTS˙+ [5].|$|R
40|$|The {{not only}} lower but also uniform MEMS chip {{temperatures}} can he reached by selecting suitable boiling number range that ensures the nucleate {{boiling heat transfer}}. In this article, boiling heat transfer experiments in 10 silicon triangular microchannels with the hydraulic diameter of 55. 4 mu m were performed using acetone as the working fluid, having the inlet liquid temperatures of 24 - 40 degrees C, mass fluxes of 96 - 360 kg/m(2) s, heat fluxes of 140 - 420 kW/m(2), and exit vapor mass qualities of 0. 28 - 0. 70. The above data range correspond to the boiling number from 1. 574 x 10 (- 3) to 3. 219 x 10 (- 3) and ensure the perfect nucleate boiling heat transfer region, providing a very uniform chip temperature distribution in both streamline and transverse directions. The boiling heat transfer coefficients determined by the infrared radiator image system were found to he dependent on the heat Axes only, not dependent on the mass Axes and the vapor mass qualities covering the above data range. The high-speed flow visualization shows that the periodic flow patterns take place inside the microchannel in the time scale of milliseconds, consisting of liquid refilling stage, bubble nucleation, growth and coalescence stage, and transient liquid film evaporation stage in a full cycle. The paired or triplet bubble nucleation sites can occur in the microchannel corners anywhere along the flow direction, accounting for the nucleate boiling heat transfer mode. The periodic boiling process {{is similar to a}} series of bubble nucleation, growth, and departure followed by the liquid refilling in a single cavity for the pool <b>boiling</b> situation. The <b>chip</b> temperature difference across the whole two-phase area is found to he small in a couple of degrees, providing a better thermal management scheme for the high heat flux electronic components.

40|$|Temporary {{superheating}} {{and sustained}} nucleation-limited “superboiling” of unstirred liquids above the normal {{atmospheric boiling point}} have been documented during microwave heating. These phenomena are reliably observed under prescribed conditions, although the duration (of superheating) and magnitude (of superheating and superboiling) vary according to system parameters such as volume of the liquid and {{the size and shape}} of the vessel. Both phenomena are mitigated by rapid stirring with an appropriate stir bar and/or with the addition of <b>boiling</b> <b>chips,</b> which provide nucleation sites to support the phase-change from liquid to gas. With proper experimental design and especially proper stirring, the measured temperature of typical organic reaction mixtures heated at reflux will be close to the normal boiling point temperature of the solvent, whether heated using microwave radiation or conventional convective heat transfer.
