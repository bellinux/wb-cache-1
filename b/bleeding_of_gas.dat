40|$|Pneumatic {{instrument}} systems powered by high-pressure natural gas {{are often used}} across the natural gas and petroleum industries for process control. Typical process control applications include pressure, temperature, liquid level, and flow rate regulation. The constant <b>bleed</b> <b>of</b> natural <b>gas</b> from these controllers is collectively {{one of the largest}} sources of methane emissions in the natural gas industry, estimated at approximately 51 billion cubic feet (Bcf) per year in the production sector, 14 Bcf per year in the transmission sector, and < 1 Bcf from processing. Companies can achieve significant cost savings and methane emission reductions by converting natural gaspowered pneumatic control systems to compressed instrument air systems.

40|$|With {{increasing}} turbine inlet temperature, {{the cooling}} <b>of</b> <b>gas</b> turbine components {{exposed to the}} hot gas flow will be of great importance. The improvement of the efficiency demands higher performance from the blade cooling systems with minimized coolant flow rates {{to cope with the}} increase in heat load as well as to meet the obligatory safety requirements. This calls for very accurate knowledge <b>of</b> the <b>gas</b> and coolant side flow and heat transfer, which both affect the blade temperature field, in order to obtain an efficient cooling design. This paper provides information about rotational effects on fluid motion and heat transfer within a rotating coolant duct of circular cross section with <b>bleeding</b> <b>of</b> cooling air through a row of film cooling holes for the purpose of film cooling <b>of</b> the hot <b>gas</b> side <b>of</b> the blade. Experimental data were obtained from a model mounted to the rotating duct facility at DLR. Flow development were measured by a non-intrusive optical Laser velocimeter. Wall temperature distributions around the duct wall and the generated heat were measured to provide data for local heat transfer analysis. The direction <b>of</b> <b>bleeding</b> is varied against the direction of rotation to study its effect on the development of secondary vortex structures which are generally caused within the flow by the rotational forces. Depending on the direction <b>of</b> <b>bleeding,</b> secondary vortex motion as well as heat transfer variation around the duct circumference are enhanced with pressure side ejection or weakened with suction side ejection...|$|R

Linear finite- and small-strain analytical solutions <b>of</b> <b>bleeding</b> as a consolidation process that account {{for the effects of}} hydration are presented and then validated by comparison with laboratory data for cement pastes {{and concrete}}s. Contrary to earlier assertions that a finite-strain model is required to model bleeding, the new finite- and small-strain solutions model the <b>bleeding</b> <b>of</b> the relatively shallow specimens analysed equally well. However, further research is necessary to establish whether small-strain solutions can model adequately the <b>bleeding</b> <b>of</b> comparatively deep concrete layers, and methods of determining the values of input parameters for the new solutions are also required.

40|$|Introduction: The aim of {{the study}} was {{determination}} of the rate <b>of</b> <b>bleeding,</b> abortion, and ectopic pregnancy in three methods of treatment of infertility in patients with different ages and realization of the predictive value <b>of</b> <b>bleeding</b> result. Methods: This study was done prospectively on 252 female patients who had become pregnant through infertility treatment at the IVF ward of Imam Khomeini Hospital (Ahwaz). They were followed {{until the end of the}} 20 th week of pregnancy. Three groups of patients included 100 patients who had become pregnant through induction ovulation, 122 patients who had become pregnant through IUI and 30 patients who had become pregnant through IVF. Results: Group I(Pregnant women via induction Ovulation) : 37 % had <b>bleeding</b> <b>of</b> which 35 % were aborted. 63 % did not have <b>bleeding</b> <b>of</b> which 11 % were aborted and one EP was detected as well. 40 % <b>of</b> the <b>bleeding</b> cases were younger than 30 years old and 29 % of them were older then 30 years. The rate of abortion in this group was 20 % and EP was 1 %. The highest abortion rate was detected inpatients older than 36 years. Group II: Pregnant women via IUI: 37 % had <b>bleeding</b> <b>of</b> which 31 % had abortion. 63 % didn’t have <b>bleeding</b> <b>of</b> which 10 % had abortion and 3 cases had EP. The rate of abortion was 18 % and EP 3 % The rate of abortion increased with age but the rate <b>of</b> <b>bleeding</b> stayed constant. Group III: Pregnant women via IVF: 36 % had <b>bleeding</b> <b>of</b> which 27 % had abortion. 64 % didn’t have <b>bleeding</b> <b>of</b> which 10. 5 % had abortion. The rate of abortion was 17 % and EP 6. 6 %. All of them were greater than 30 years old. The rate <b>of</b> abortion and <b>bleeding</b> was not different in three groups and did not disagree with world’s statistics. Conclusion: The rate of EP in IVF group was higher than other groups but similar to world’s data (2 - 8 %). The rate <b>of</b> <b>bleeding</b> didn’t increase with age. However, bleeding in all ages and groups could predict a 2. 5 - 3 fold increase in the rate of abortion (PV = 0. 008, 0. 014 and 0. 05 in three groups). Also, 11 % of all abortions were without bleeding...|$|R

In addition, the much larger in the specific surface area of red mud than that of Portland cement might also be another reason explained for a decrease in <b>bleeding</b> <b>of</b> mixtures.

40|$|SummaryBackgroundPalpation of the {{indwelling}} angiographic catheter inserted before {{operation to}} localize obscure gastrointestinal <b>bleeding</b> <b>of</b> small intestinal origin during laparotomy {{has rarely been}} reported in the literature. PurposeThe purpose of the study is to investigate the role of palpable indwelling angiocatheter inserted before operation in localizing obscure gastrointestinal <b>bleeding</b> <b>of</b> small intestinal origin during laparotomy. MethodsBetween January 2003 and December 2010, seven patients who had a clinical impression <b>of</b> obscure gastrointestinal <b>bleeding</b> <b>of</b> small intestinal origin and angiographic extravasation from the mesenteric artery had an angiocatheter inserted into the distal mesenteric branch. During laparotomy the catheter was palpated to guide subsequent resection of the intestine. The clinical outcomes of these patients were retrospectively reviewed. ResultsDuring laparotomy the retained catheter failed to be palpated in one patient. Six patients underwent segmental resection of intestine under guidance of the palpated catheter. All six patients had positive identification <b>of</b> small bowel <b>bleeding.</b> The yield rate of intraoperative localization was 86 % (6 out of 7). Two of the six patients ceased bleeding after operation, but died of underlying disease progression. Four of the six patients had an uneventful postoperative clinical course without recurrent bleeding after a median follow-up period of 25 months. ConclusionPalpation of the indwelling angiographic catheter selectively left before operation is effective for precisely locating obscure gastrointestinal <b>bleeding</b> <b>of</b> small intestinal origin during laparotomy...|$|R

40|$|Background The {{high costs}} of factor VIII {{examination}} cause the delay in the diagnosis of hemophilia A; consequently many pa- tients do not receive adequate therapy which results in failure to survive into adulthood or survive with creeple.

Methods We perform retrospective analysis of hemophilia patients at the Integrated Service Center of Hemophilia, Cipto Mangun- kusumo Hospital, Jakarta.
