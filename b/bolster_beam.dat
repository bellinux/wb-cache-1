40|$|Many {{structural}} elements {{are exposed to}} load conditions {{that are difficult to}} model during the design stage, such as environmental uncertainties, random impacts and overloading amongst others, thus, increasing un programmed maintenance and reducing confidence in the reliability of the structure in question [...] One way to deal with this problem is to monitor the structural condition of the element [...] This approach requires supervising several signals coming from critical locations and then, performing an accurate condition estimation of the element based on the data collected [...] Herein, this paper implements a method to diagnosis and evaluate the reliability of the <b>bolster</b> <b>beam</b> structure of the railway-vehicle during a fatigue test [...] The results show that multidimensional monitoring not only provides an accurate diagnosis of the element, but also that this technique allows to estimate reliability correctl...|$|E
40|$|Locomotives are {{the back}} bone of the {{transportation}} system in any country. Locomotive mainly consists of engine and control assembly placed on the under-frame which in turn rests on two bogies. Cracks are reported {{to occur in the}} <b>bolster</b> <b>beam</b> of the bogie frames in one of the designs of locomotives in service. Cracks are treated by welding and locomotive is resent in operation but cracks appeared again on some other locations beside the welded portion. In order to investigate the reasons for crack initiation; data regarding rail track and its quality, routes and severity of operation and drawings of the locomotive is collected. Finite element analysis is then performed first for the existing design of the locomotive in use to find the reason for the crack. Curvature and small radii are concluded the main reason of crack initiation and propagation under continuous oscillatory lateral movement on straight track and lateral forces during turning. In addition, removal of stiffeners from certain locations concluded ease of manufacturing. Use of friction modifiers is recommended to reduce forces generating cracks. Design optimization is performed using detailed finite element analysis for minimum weight and safe stress against fatigue...|$|E
50|$|A major {{deviation}} from Town's design are the additional diagonals at the ends, which distribute the load over a smaller area and {{eliminates the need}} for long abutment seats of <b>bolster</b> <b>beams.</b> A patent was granted in 1863 for a similar variation on Town's design, so it is quite likely that this technique was not developed by the builder of the Beaverkill bridge. It is, however, unusual for New York. Davidson's three are the only ones known to have been built in the state.|$|R
