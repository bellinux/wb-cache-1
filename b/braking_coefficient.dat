Currently, these information are based on a description of the type and the depth of contaminants on the runway surface.

40|$|The brake {{architecture}} of hybrid and full electric vehicle includes the distinctive function of brake blending. Known approaches {{draw upon the}} maximum energy recuperation strategy and neglect the operation mode of friction brakes. Within this framework, an efficient control of the blending functions is demanded to compensate external disturbances induced by unpredictable variations of the pad disc friction coefficient. In addition, the control demand distribution between the conventional frictional brake system and the electric motors can incur failures that compromise the frictional braking performance and safety. However, deviation of friction coefficient value given in controller from actual one can induce undesirable deterioration of brake control functions. The main objective of the presented study is to propose a method to compensate disturbances induced by variations of <b>brake</b> linings friction <b>coefficient</b> through modifications of the brake torque demand for the enhancement of both brake performance and active safety.

Numerical simulations confirmed the equivalence between the full and small scale disc thermal performance using the proposed scaling methodology and also provide a good agreement with the experimental results. The coated 6082 alloy rotor was shown to give good thermal and friction performance up to relatively high rubbing surface temperatures of around 500 oC. This rotor failed at a surface temperature of about 550 oC due to brittle fracture of the wrought aluminium substrate. The proposed scaling methodology was shown to be a valid method of investigating a rotor design concept in the laboratory at low cost and reduced operating time. The PEO coating on aluminium alloy was denser and more uniform compared to the PEO coating on aluminium MMC. In addition, the PEO coating improved the hardness and thermal resistance of both the aluminium alloy and aluminium MMC. A sensitivity analysis based on the Taguchi approach was carried out on the PEO coated aluminium alloy rotor to investigate the effect of various parameters on thermal performance. Optimisation of the structure was carried out using a genetic algorithm to design coated aluminium alloy discs that are potentially technically viable on small-medium passenger cars...|$|R
