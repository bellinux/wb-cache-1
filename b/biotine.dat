40|$|Selenite {{reduction}} in Rhodobacter sphaeroides f. sp. denitrificans was observed under photosynthetic conditions, following a 100 -h lag period. This adaptation period was suppressed if the medium was inoculated with a culture previously {{grown in the}} presence of selenite, suggesting that selenite {{reduction in}}volves an inducible enzymatic pathway. A transposon library was screened to isolate mutants affected in selenite reduction. Of the eight mutants isolated, two were affected in molybdenum cofactor synthesis. These moaA and mogA mutants showed an increased duration of the lag phase and a decreased rate of selenite reduction. When grown {{in the presence of}} tungstate, a well-known molybdenum-dependent enzyme (molybdoenzyme) inhibitor, the wild-type strain displayed the same phenotype. The addition of tungstate in the medium or the inactivation of the molybdocofactor synthesis induced a decrease of 40 % in the rate of selenite reduction. These results suggest that several pathways are involved and that one of them involves a molybdoenzyme. Although addition of nitrate or dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to the medium increased the selenite reduction activity of the culture, neither the periplasmic nitrate reductase NAP nor the DMSO reductase is the implicated molybdoenzyme, since the napA and dmsA mutants, with expression of nitrate reductase and DMSO reductase, respectively, eliminated, were not affected by selenite reduction. A role for the <b>biotine</b> sulfoxide reductase, another characterized molybdoenzyme, is unlikely, since its overexpression in a defective strain did not restore the selenite reduction activity...|$|E
40|$|Over {{millions}} of years the structure {{and complexity of the}} transcriptional regulatory network (TRN) in bacteria has changed, reorganized and enabled them to adapt to almost every environmental niche on earth. In order to understand the plasticity of TRNs in bacteria, we studied the conservation of currently known TRNs of the two model organisms Escherichia coli K 12 and Bacillus subtilis across complete genomes including Bacteria, Archaea and Eukarya at three different levels: individual components of the TRN, pairs of interactions and regulons. We found that transcription factors (TFs) evolve much faster than the target genes (TGs) across phyla. We show that global regulators are poorly conserved across the phylogenetic spectrum and hence TFs could be the major players responsible for the plasticity and evolvability of the TRNs. We also found that there is {{only a small fraction of}} significantly conserved transcriptional regulatory interactions among different phyla of bacteria and that there is no constraint on the elements of the interaction to co-evolve. Finally our results suggest that majority of the regulons in bacteria are rapidly lost implying a high-order flexibility in the TRNs. We hypothesize that during the divergence of bacteria certain essential cellular processes like the synthesis of arginine, <b>biotine</b> and ribose, transport of amino acids and iron, availability of phosphate, replication process and the SOS response are well conserved in evolution. From our comparative analysis, it is possible to infer that transcriptional regulation is more flexible than the genetic component of the organisms and its complexity and structure plays an important role in the phenotypic adaptation...|$|E

The {{purpose of the}} work: {{the creation of the}} non-radioactive high-sensitive hybridization method of detection of the tick encephalitis virus in the clinic samples. The lavsane membranes with the covalently bound oligonucleotides have been obtained for use in the hybridization analysis. The affined membranes possessed the high capacity (10 * 99 -* 991 * 990 mol/cm* 992) and the efficiency of hybridization with the complementary consequence (at least 50 %). The reverse transcription of the tick encephalitis virus (TEV) RNA with use of the Klenov's fragment as the revertase has been realized. The forming fragment kDNA has been amplificated, using the marked primers with <b>biotine.</b> The high specificity and universality of the selected set of the primers have been established. For biotinilating the oligonucleatides, the water-soluble reganets (2 -nitro- 4 -sulphophenyl and n-sulphotetrafluorphenyl ethers of biotin) have been used, allowing to receive the products with the high outputs during one h in the water-alkali medium. The method of revealation of streptavidine with the high output and biotin-connecting activity, fir for use in the gene-engineering works and in the IFA, has been offered. The non-radioactive method of the TEV RNA in the biological samples, based on the reverse dot-hybridization in combination with the OT and PCR reactions, has been developed.

40|$|Le récepteur alpha des œstrogènes (ERa) est une cible privilégiée dans le {{traitement}} du cancer du sein. En effet, 70 % des tumeurs sont hormono-dépendantes, c est-à-dire qu elles expriment ERa et que les œstrogènes contrôlent leur prolifération. Par ailleurs, les agonistes du récepteur nucléaire Peroxisome Proliferator Activated Receptor gamma (PPAR?? inhibent la prolifération des cellules cancéreuses mammaires in vivo et in vitro. L objectif de la thèse visait à déterminer si ces composés, en particulier ceux de la famille des thiazolidinediones, interféraient avec la voie de signalisation des œstrogènes. Les travaux ont porté sur 2 lignées cancéreuses mammaires hormono-dépendantes : MCF- 7 et ZR- 75 - 1. La troglitazone (TGZ), la ciglitazone et la 15 déoxy-Prostaglandine J 2 (15 d-PGJ 2) altèrent la signalisation œstrogénique en induisant la dégradation de l ERa. ?Cette protéolyse fait appel au protéasome 26 S et {{elle est}} plus accentuée pour la lignée ZR- 75 - 1. Les composés qui altèrent la signalisation œstrogénique inhibent aussi fortement la prolifération cellulaire. La dégradation de ERa ne semble pas dépendre de l activation des ligands de PPAR? puisqu un agoniste puissant comme la rosiglitazone n induit pas cet effet. L utilisation d antagonistes de PPAR?, de la ? 2 -TGZ, dérivé de la troglitazone qui n active pas PPAR? ainsi qu une approche par interférence ARN ont permis de démontrer que la protéolyse de l ERa est bien liée à mécanisme indépendant de PPAR?. La littérature indiquait que la 15 d-PGJ 2 se liait de façon covalente à ERa, ?mais pas à l isoforme ERß. Nous avons observé que la 15 d-PGJ 2 n induisait pas la protéolyse de ERß. Une dégradation différentielle a aussi été observée avec les thiazolidinediones. En outre, l activité transcriptionnelle de ERa est affectée précocement après l exposition des cellules aux différents ligands, suggérant une modification du récepteur. Afin de savoir si une liaison covalente pouvait être à l origine de la protéolyse, un groupement <b>biotine</b> a été greffé sur la ? 2 -TGZ afin de réaliser des expériences de pull-down. Ce composé n a pas permis de démontrer l hypothèse mais cette molécule induit plus efficacement que la molécule d origine la protéolyse non seulement de l ERa, ?mais aussi de la cycline D 1. Des modifications des ligands de PPAR? ?pourraient donc avantageusement diminuer les doses efficaces. Ces mécanismes PPAR?-indépendants, qui aboutissent à la dégradation de la cycline D 1 et de ERa mais pas de ERß pourraient être intéressants dans l optique d une application à la thérapeutique des cancers mammaires. Estrogen receptor alpha (ERa) {{is a major}} target in breast cancer treatment. About 70 % of breast cancers are estrogen-sensitive meaning that estrogens stimulate their growth. Ligands of PPAR? (Peroxisome Proliferator Activated Receptor gamma) inhibit breast cancer cell proliferation both in vivo and in vitro. The aim of this work {{was to determine whether}} PPAR? ligands could interfere with estrogen signalling pathway. The effects of Rosiglitazone (RGZ), Ciglitazone (CGZ), Troglitazone (TGZ) and the natural PPAR? agonist 15 d-PGJ 2 were investigated in two hormone-dependent breast cancer cell lines, MCF- 7 and ZR- 75 - 1. In both of them, TGZ, CGZ and 15 d-PGJ 2 induced an inhibition of ERa signalling associated with the proteasomal degradation of ERa. ZR- 75 - 1 cells were more sensitive than MCF- 7 to these compounds. Treatments that induced ERa degradation also inhibited cell proliferation after 24 h. In contrast, 24 h exposure to RGZ, the most potent activator of PPAR? disrupted neither ERa signalling nor cell proliferation. 9 -cis retinoic acid never potentiated the proteasomal degradation of ERa. PPAR? antagonists did not block the proteolysis of ERa in MCF- 7 and ZR- 75 - 1 cells treated with TGZ. ERa proteolysis still occurred in case of PPAR? silencing as well as in case of treatment with the PPAR?-inactive compound ? 2 -TGZ, demonstrating a PPAR?-independent mechanism. A previous study indicated that 15 d-PGJ 2 was able to covalently modify ERa, ?but did not bind to ERß. First, we observed that in contrast to ERa, ERß proteolysis did not occur in MCF- 7 cells exposed to 15 d-PGJ 2. A differential proteolysis was also observed in case of exposure to thiazolidinediones. Moreover, transfection experiments using pEREtkLuc showed that ERa functionality was affected early after exposure of MCF- 7 cells to thiazolidinediones. In order to determine if a covalent binding of PPAR? ligands to ERa ?could lead to its proteolysis, a biotinylated derivative of ? 2 -TGZ was synthesized. However, pull-down assays performed using neutravidin beads did not allow to demonstrate a covalent interaction between ERa and biotinylated ? 2 -TGZ. When we verified the efficiency of biotinylated ? 2 -TGZ on ERa ?proteolysis induction, we observed that the substitution by <b>biotine</b> potentiated the TGZ-induced proteasomal degradation not only of ERa but also of cyclin D 1. In conclusion, the design of new thiazolidinedione derivatives could lead to more efficient molecules able to affect differentially ER in a PPAR?-independent way and could be an interesting tool for breast cancer therapy.

40|$|Hydrofunctionalization of {{terminal}} {{double or}} triple bonds have become classical ligation tools for facile assembly of building blocks into larger molecules especially because comply Sharpless’ prerequisite to be considered “click-chemistry” reactions. In particular the free-metal photoinduced radical thiol-ene (TEC) and thiol-yne (TYC) couplings are well-known to be atom economy, high-efficient, catalyzed only by light and completely regioselective. If both TEC and TYC have already been studied on simple substrates as linear terminal alkenes or alkynes, only few researches {{have been carried out}} about particular molecules as protein, peptides and endo-glycals. Hydrothiolation of protein, peptides and aminoacids has been studied to obtain a double different substitution of the peptidic scaffold with one carbohydrate and one marker (fluoresceine or <b>biotine)</b> using TYC. A new technique to synthesize S-disaccharides has been developed starting from different glycals and thio-glucose, demonstrating the efficiency of TEC on internal internal double bonds. The successful work about hydrothiolation of different substrates has pushed us to study both hydrophosphonylation of alkenes and alkynes starting from the same conditions of TEC and TYC reactions. The different reactivity of the functionalization agent (thiol or H-phosphonate) has resulted in different conditions for the addition to double bonds, but not in a loss of efficiency o regioselectivity. On the other hand the addition on a triple bond has resulted to be ineffective and to stop at the internal double bond intermediate. A thiol-ene coupling on this intermediate, formally a vinyl phosphonate, gives equilibration to E form of the alkene without traces of hydrothiolation adducts. It is well known that multivalent effect is a key factor in supramolecular chemistry and it governs many biological interactions, in particular in the relationship between pathogenic microorganisms and their host that involves protein–glycan recognition. The affinity of a multivalent cluster is highly dependent on the combination of the carbohydrate head with the cluster core and the spacer between them; several families of multivalent bioactive molecules have been developed by a large numbers of groups all around the world using disparate synthetic techniques. Thiol-Ene (TEC) and Thiol-Yne (TYC) couplings have been chosen as ligation tool for the synthesis of a variety of multivalent biomolecules containing carbohydrates or peptidic termini supported on different bio-inactive clusters as dendrimers and the rigid silica cube known as POSS (polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane). Both TEC and TYC are highly efficient, regioselective and atom economy reactions that, moreover, permit us to avoid purification problems due to metal catalysis or to use large excess of reagents to have a complete substitution on the central core. In fact all the reactions have been carried out with success, high yield and without by-products of any kind. Affinity toward specific target of this large library of compounds has been tested by Enzyme-Linked Lectin Assay (ELLA) and results from good to excellent have been found in all classes of compounds...|$|E
