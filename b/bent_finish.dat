She had previously {{made a great}} point of their spending this last evening alone together, but her mood was silent.

500|$|Bent scored Sunderland's only goal against Burnley at Turf Moor, {{making the}} score 1–1, before losing 3–1. He scored {{again in a}} 5–2 win against Wolverhampton Wanderers, {{although}} after the match, Sunderland manager Steve Bruce was left angry at Bent's decision to give Sunderland's second penalty kick to teammate Kenwyne Jones, after the latter [...] "pleaded" [...] with Bent to take the penalty {{so that he could}} get on the score sheet. Bent scored in a 1–0 victory against Liverpool on 17 October 2009 when his shot hit a beach ball thrown onto the field by a Liverpool fan and past confused goalkeeper Pepe Reina into the net. He scored his first hat-trick for Sunderland in a 4–0 victory over Bolton on 9 March 2010. He scored two goals, one a penalty, but missed two other penalties as they were saved by Heurelho Gomes in a 3–1 victory against former club Tottenham on 3 April. <b>Bent</b> <b>finished</b> the 2009–10 season with 25 goals in 40 appearances in all competitions, 24 of which came in the Premier League, amounting to 50% of Sunderland's 48 goals in the league that season. He was named as Sunderland's Player of the Year.|$|R
5|$|Bent {{completed}} a transfer to Charlton Athletic on 1 June 2005, which was worth an initial fee of £2.5million, {{but would have}} risen to £3million if he made an agreed number of appearances for Charlton and for England. On {{the opening day of}} the 2005–06 Premier League season, Bent scored two goals on his Charlton debut against Sunderland, and was named Premier League Player of the Month for August. He scored in his first four appearances for the club, one of only six players to perform this feat in the Premier League. Bent was the highest scoring Englishman in the Premier League in 2005–06, with 18 goals (22 overall), which made him third highest scorer and was given Charlton's Player of the Year award. He signed an extension to his contract at Charlton in July, which contracted him until June 2010. <b>Bent</b> <b>finished</b> 2006–07 with 13 goals in the Premier League, again finishing as Charlton's top goalscorer, but was unable to prevent them from being relegated into the Championship after seven successive seasons of Premier League football. Charlton accepted a bid from West Ham United for him in June 2007, but Bent was not interested in a move to Upton Park.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the applicability of}} magnetic abrasive finishing to the internal <b>finishing</b> of large–sized <b>bent</b> tubes produced by high frequency induction bending. Finishing equipment was developed for large–sized <b>bent</b> tubes. The <b>finishing</b> experiments using austenitic stainless steel tubes bent by both cold–drawing and high frequency induction bending demonstrate the finishing characteristics and reveal {{the differences in the}} finishing mechanism between the two types of elbows. The elbow made by cold–drawing required only one finishing process to achieve a 0. 03 µm Ra surface. In contrast, high frequency bent elbow, which is covered with an oxide film, required two–stage finishing using two different sizes of ferrous particles for a smoothly finished surface, 0. 05 ~ 0. 13 µm Ra...|$|R

In 1950, Unzicker shared the prize for best top-board score (+9 −1 =4) with Miguel Najdorf for his performance on first board for the West German team at the Dubrovnik Chess Olympiad. At the Tel Aviv 1964 Chess Olympiad Unzicker scored 13.5 points playing first board for the West German team that won the bronze medal {{on the strength of}} a 3:1 team victory over the Soviet Union. Unzicker also shared fourth place (+2 −1 =14) with Lajos Portisch in the 1966 Piatigorsky Cup in Santa Monica, California. Only Boris Spassky, Bobby Fischer, and <b>Bent</b> Larsen <b>finished</b> ahead of Unzicker. Unzicker placed ahead of world champion Tigran Petrosian, Samuel Reshevsky, Miguel Najdorf, Borislav Ivkov, and Hein Donner. At Hastings 1969-70, Unzicker finished second (+4 −0 =5) after Lajos Portisch and ahead of Svetozar Gligorić and former world champion Vasily Smyslov.

5|$|On 25 February 2012, in a {{match against}} Wigan Athletic, Bent landed awkwardly on his ankle after {{tangling}} with Antolín Alcaraz. He was stretchered off the pitch {{with what was}} thought to be a serious injury. This was later confirmed two days later, after Bent had a scan on his ankle that revealed he had ruptured ligaments. He was out for three months which effectively ended his season with Villa and most likely his chance to play at UEFA Euro 2012. Bent had recovered from his injury by mid-May and was in contention for Villa's final match of 2011–12 against Norwich City but was ultimately left out. This also gave him the possibility of making new England manager Roy Hodgson's Euro 2012 England squad. Bent vowed to prove his fitness to Hodgson, in the hope he would be selected to play in the tournament. <b>Bent</b> once again <b>finished</b> as Villa's top scorer with 10 goals in 25 appearances and vowed to stay on at the club.|$|R
60|$|In {{the midst}} of this I could see that Jonathan {{on one side of the}} ring of men, and Quincey on the other, were forcing a way to the cart. It was evident that they were <b>bent</b> on <b>finishing</b> their task before the sun should set. Nothing seemed to stop or even to hinder them. Neither the {{levelled}} weapons nor the flashing knives of the gypsies in front, nor the howling of the wolves behind, appeared to even attract their attention. Jonathan's impetuosity, and the manifest singleness of his purpose, seemed to overawe those in front of him. Instinctively they cowered aside and let him pass. In an instant he had jumped upon the cart, and with a strength which seemed incredible, raised the great box, and flung it over the wheel to the ground. In the meantime, Mr. Morris had had to use force to pass through his side of the ring of Szgany. All the time I had been breathlessly watching Jonathan I had, with the tail of my eye, seen him pressing desperately forward, and had seen the knives of the gypsies flash as he won a way through them, and they cut at him. He had parried with his great bowie knife, and at first I thought that he too had come through in safety. But as he sprang beside Jonathan, who had by now jumped from the cart, I could see that with his left hand he was clutching at his side, and that the blood was spurting through his fingers. He did not delay notwithstanding this, for as Jonathan, with desperate energy, attacked one end of the chest, attempting to prize off the lid with his great Kukri knife, he attacked the other frantically with his bowie. Under the efforts of both men the lid began to yield. The nails drew with a screeching sound, and the top of the box was thrown back.|$|R
2500|$|Ian Meckiff: [...] The biggest culprit in English {{eyes was}} the [...] "jerky erratic Meckiff". who took 17 wickets (17.17) in the series, but dragged {{his foot and}} his [...] "action was {{generally}} conceded to constitute a throw". Several former English and Australian Test players stated that his action was illegal; Jack Fingleton, Keith Miller, Alf Gover, Ernie McCormick, Ian Peebles and Johnny Wardle, as did many in the England team; [...] Trevor Bailey, Jim Laker, Peter Richardson and Fred Trueman. Meckiff was defended by his captain Richie Benaud said he was [...] "completely satisfied that his delivery was fair and legitimate". and Jack Pollard, who wrote [...] "Meckiff, in fact, went to the crease with a beautifully relaxed approach, paused momentarily with his arm absolutely straight, and then let the ball go with a blurred swing of the arm that was impossible to follow from 60 yards away, even {{with the aid of}} good binoculars". The England manager Freddie Brown wanted to make an official complaint about Meckiff's bowling after the First Test, but captain Peter May declined as it would look like sour grapes. Instead they talked unofficially to the Australian chairman of selectors Sir Donald Bradman who retorted [...] "And what of the action of the England bowlers Tony Lock and Peter Loader?" [...] and that they should [...] "first of all put their own house in order". May never did make an official complaint, but [...] "Englishmen who fell to Meckiff's speed and lively lift were hardly happy at being victims of deliveries that began with a <b>bent</b> arm and <b>finished</b> with a pronounced wrist-whip". He was subsequently no balled for throwing twice in the Sheffield Shield, but his career was ended when Australian umpire Colin Egar no balled him four times in his first over against South Africa in the First Test at Brisbane in 1963-64. Some thought this was arranged for the benefit of sporting relations, but Meckiff never played cricket again.|$|R
