40|$|The {{generation}} of trust between business partners is a strategic issue for firms in competitive agri-food markets. It is asserted that <b>business</b> <b>associations</b> can be important facilitators of trust between firms. Cross-national comparative {{research on the}} UK and Dutch potato industries is conducted {{to find out how}} and to what extent <b>business</b> <b>associations</b> perform functions that can facilitate trust. The results show that there are considerable national differences in the intensity and range of such functions performed by <b>business</b> <b>associations.</b> The findings indicate that, in spite of globalization trends, nationally distinct ways of generating trust via <b>business</b> <b>associations</b> continue to exist.

40|$|International {{lessons from}} {{emerging}} economies suggest that <b>business</b> <b>associations</b> may provide an effective channel {{of communication between}} the government and the private sector. This function of <b>business</b> <b>associations</b> may become still more important in transition economies, where old mechanisms for coordinating enterprise activities have been destroyed, while the new ones have not been established yet. In this context, Russian experience is a matter of interest, because for a long time, Russia was regarded as a striking example of state failures and market failures. Consequently, the key point of our study was a description of the role and place of <b>business</b> <b>associations</b> in the presentday Russian economy and their interaction with member companies and bodies of state administration. Relying on the survey data of 957 manufacturing firms conducted in 2009, we found that <b>business</b> <b>associations</b> are more frequently joined by larger companies, firms located in regional capital cities, and firms active in investment and innovation. By contrast, <b>business</b> <b>associations</b> tend to be less frequently joined by business groups’ subsidiaries and firms that were non-responsive about their respective ownership structures. Our regression analysis has also confirmed that <b>business</b> <b>associations</b> are a component of what Frye (2002) calls an “elite exchange”– although only on regional and local levels. These “exchanges” imply that members of <b>business</b> <b>associations,</b> on the one hand, more actively assist regional and local authorities in social development of their regions, and on the other hand more often receive support from authorities. However, this effect is insignificant in terms of support from the federal government. In general, our results allow us to believe that at present, <b>business</b> <b>associations</b> (especially the industry-wide and “leading” ones) consolidate the most active, advanced companies and act as collective representatives of their interests. For this reason, <b>business</b> <b>associations</b> can be regarded as interface units between the authorities and businesses and as a possible instrument for promotion of economic development. <b>business</b> <b>associations,</b> economic growth, state-business relations, collective actions...|$|R

5|$|At Oregon's request, the U.S. Congress {{stripped}} the slough of its navigable status in 1978. This ended channel dredging on the slough, which {{could then be}} used for recreation. Other laws affecting the slough in the 1970s and beyond were the federal Clean Water Act and the Oregon Comprehensive Land Use Planning Act. In 1986, a <b>business</b> <b>association</b> began promoting commercial development along the upper slough, and the city later used urban renewal funds to support industrial projects near the airport. In 1996 the city acquired the Whitaker Ponds Natural Area, where it began a slough watershed education program for children.|$|E
40|$|This article tests two {{hypotheses}} about post-communist <b>business</b> <b>associations.</b> The first predicts weak <b>business</b> <b>associations</b> which {{are presented with}} insurmountable collective action problems by the flattened civil society inherited from totalitarianism. According to this hypothesis, no <b>business</b> <b>associations</b> are inherited from the previous regime, and associations are confronted with difficult-to-organize latent groups {{of large numbers of}} new small enterprises. The second hypothesis, as proposed by Mancur Olson, predicts strong <b>business</b> <b>associations</b> benefiting from the collective action advantages of the communist economic structure which was composed of small numbers of large enterprises. The hypotheses are tested with case studies of Poland 2 ̆ 7 s five most influential <b>business</b> <b>associations.</b> The conclusion is that the flattened civil society hypothesis is best borne out by the evidence. This suggests that, in other countries, political factors, rather than the standard communist economic structure, are more likely to explain the persistence of industrial super lobbies...|$|R

The {{purpose of this study is}} to examine factors related to members 2 ̆ 7 involvement in <b>business</b> <b>associations.</b> As two distinct approaches of social capital, the rational choice and embeddedness perspectives provide different explanations.

30|$|Third, small- and {{medium-sized}} private enterprises lack political advantages {{and are more}} likely to rely on <b>business</b> <b>associations</b> and informal networks. This denotes that a kind of associational activism is emerging among some private entrepreneurs in contemporary China. However, the active involvement of associations and informal networks do not contradict each other. In China, <b>business</b> <b>associations</b> are institutional arrangements that usually also serve as important platforms to nurture social networks among officials and private entrepreneurs (Wank 1999). Thus, <b>business</b> <b>associations</b> in contemporary China have the dual function of serving as institutional conduits and producing clientelist networks.|$|R
