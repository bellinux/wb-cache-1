Costas, {{a former}} <b>bond</b> <b>trader</b> and co-head of Fixed income at Credit Suisse First Boston {{and head of}} Fixed Income Trading at Union Bank of Switzerland in 1998, was {{appointed}} CEO of UBS's investment banking division, which originated in SBC's Warburg Dillon Read division and was renamed UBS Warburg in December 2001. In an attempt {{to break into the}} elite bulge bracket of investment banks, in which UBS then had little success while rival Credit Suisse was establishing itself as a major player on Wall Street with the acquisition of Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette in 2000, Costas shifted the growth strategy from acquiring entire firms to hiring individual investment bankers or teams of bankers from rival firms. Costas had followed a similar approach in building out the UBS fixed income business, hiring over 500 sales and trading personnel and increasing revenues from US$300million in 1998 to over US$3billion by 2001.|$|E

25|$|Ivan Boesky was a Wall Street {{arbitrageur}} who had {{amassed a}} fortune of about $200 million by betting on corporate takeovers. He was {{investigated by the}} U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for making investments based on tips received from corporate insiders. These stock and options acquisitions were sometimes brazen, with massive purchases occurring {{only a few days}} before a corporation announced a takeover. Although insider trading of this kind was illegal, laws prohibiting it were rarely enforced until Boesky was prosecuted. Boesky cooperated with the SEC and informed on several others, including junk <b>bond</b> <b>trader</b> Michael Milken. Per agreement with Giuliani, Boesky received a -year prison sentence along with a $100 million fine. In 1989, Giuliani charged Milken under the RICO Act with 98 counts of racketeering and fraud. In a highly publicized case, Milken was indicted by a grand jury on these charges.|$|E
25|$|Eventually, Faulkner {{found his}} niche within NLP {{when he began}} {{developing}} decision-making strategy models based on the thought-patterns and behaviors of highly successful people. He mapped strategies for physicians, international negotiators and accelerated learners. He began to take a particular interest in studying the behavior of top traders in 1987 when a <b>bond</b> <b>trader</b> asked him if NLP {{could be used in}} the stock market. In 1990 after years of observing the decision-making strategies of successful traders such as Richard Dennis, Pete Steidlmayer, Jim Rogers, Paul Tudor Jones and Tom Baldwin, Faulkner decided to become a trader, himself. His first trade in 1992 was a failure; however, he did succeed in closing the year at a profit. Within three years, Faulkner's trading skills had improved enough that, author, Jack D. Schwager included his profile in The New Market Wizards: Conversations with America's Top Traders.|$|E

Simon was known to awaken his children on weekend mornings by dousing their heads with buckets of cold water. Mr. Simon came away from the experience of Watergate with a disgust for the partisan character of the affair.

Although he had come out to his family, Staley remained closeted at work, working as a <b>bond</b> <b>trader</b> by day and chairing ACT UP's fundraising operations by night, before coming out at work and going on disability leave.

40|$|A {{feature of}} credit markets {{is the large}} {{difference}} between probabilities of default calculated from historical data and probabilities of default implied from bond prices (or from credit default swaps). Consider, for example, a seven-year A-rated bond. As we will see the average probability of default backed out from the bond’s price is almost ten times as great as that calculated from historical data. Why are the two estimates of the probability of default so different? The answer is that <b>bond</b> <b>traders</b> do not base their prices for bonds only on the actuarial probability of default. They build in an extra return {{to compensate for the}} risks they are bearing. The default probabilities calculated from historical data are referred to as real-world (or physical) default probabilities; those backed out from bond prices are known as risk-neutral default probabilities. Real-world default probabilities are usually less than risk-neutral default probabilities. This means that <b>bond</b> <b>traders</b> earn more than the risk-free rate on average from holding corporate bonds. Risk-neutral default probabilities are used when credit dependent instruments are valued. Real-world default probabilities are used in scenario analysis and in the calculation of bank capital under Basel II...|$|R

25|$|Floating {{exchange}} rates made life more complicated for <b>bond</b> <b>traders,</b> including those at Salomon Brothers in New York City. By {{the middle of}} the 1970s, encouraged by the head of bond research at Salomon, Marty Liebowitz, traders began thinking about bond yields in new ways. Rather than think of each maturity (a ten-year bond, a five-year, etc.) as a separate marketplace, they began drawing a curve through all their yields. The bit nearest the present time became known as the short end—yields of bonds further out became, naturally, the long end.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Forecasts by {{rational}} agents contain embedded {{initial and}} terminal boundary conditions. Standard time series models generate {{two types of}} long-run “endpoints”—fixed endpoints and moving average endpoints. Neither can explain the shifting endpoints implied by postwar movements in the cross-section of forward rate forecasts in the term structure or by post- 1979 changes in survey estimates of expected inflation.
