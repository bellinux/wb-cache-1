The main shortcoming of this system is the fact that its role is restricted solely to attaining a fiscal goal of taxation. Economic and social goals, as well as other non-fiscal functions are either omitted or they play an insignificant role. The authors discuss in the article the basic relations of taxes and charges (taxes and charges from incomes of collective labour organizations and wages of employees, turnover tax,. taxes and charges from the population’s personal incomes, taxes paid by foreign nationals, taxes on property and property rights). There are also presented the main trends of the discussion in the need for and directions of changes in the fiscal policy in Yugoslavia.

We also find that more fiscal decentralization and stronger fiscal incentives — the latter measured in terms of higher (ex ante) marginal local <b>budgetary</b> <b>revenue</b> retention rate — implies faster development of non-state enterprises and more reform in state-owned enterprises, while the Party's control over appointment has opposite effects.
