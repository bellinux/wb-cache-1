5|$|Heart tissue, {{like all}} {{cells in the}} <b>body,</b> <b>needs</b> to be {{supplied}} with oxygen, nutrients {{and a way of}} removing metabolic wastes. This is achieved by the coronary circulation, which includes arteries, veins, and lymphatic vessels. Blood flow through the coronary vessels occurs in peaks and troughs relating to the heart muscle's relaxation or contraction.|$|E

25|$|The {{benefits}} of UV can outweigh manageable risks. UV light causes {{the body to}} produce vitamin D, which is essential for life. The human <b>body</b> <b>needs</b> some UV radiation in order for one to maintain adequate vitamin D levels.|$|E
25|$|The human <b>body</b> <b>needs</b> iron for oxygen transport. Oxygen (O2) is {{required}} for the functioning and survival of nearly all cell types. Oxygen is transported from the lungs {{to the rest of the}} body bound to the heme group of hemoglobin in erythrocytes. In muscles cells, iron binds myoglobin, which regulates its release.|$|E
25|$|The {{profound}} {{weight loss}} which occurs after bariatric surgery {{is due to}} taking in much less energy (calories) than the <b>body</b> <b>needs</b> to use every day. Fat tissue must be burned to offset the deficit, and weight loss results. Eventually, as the body becomes smaller, its energy requirements are decreased, while the patient simultaneously finds it possible to eat somewhat more food. When the energy consumed {{is equal to the}} calories eaten, weight loss will stop. Proximal GBP typically results in loss of 6080% of excess body weight, and very rarely leads to excessive weight loss. The risk of excessive weight loss is slightly greater with distal GBP.|$|E

25|$|According to Timothy Robinson, it {{is unclear}} whether Aristotle {{identifies}} the soul with the body's structure. According to one interpretation of Aristotle, a properly organized body is already alive simply by virtue of its structure. However, according to another interpretation, the property of life—that is, the soul—is something in addition to the body's structure. Robinson uses the analogy of a car to explain this second interpretation. A running car is running not only because of its structure but also because of the activity in its engine. Likewise, according to this second interpretation, a living body is alive not only because of its structure but also because of an additional property: the soul is this additional property, which a properly organized <b>body</b> <b>needs</b> in order to be alive. John Vella uses Frankenstein's monster to illustrate the second interpretation: the corpse lying on Frankenstein's table is already a fully organized human body, but it is not yet alive; when Frankenstein activates his machine, the corpse gains a new property, the property of life, which Aristotle would call the soul.|$|E
500|$|Memory and naïve B cells {{normally}} {{exist in}} relatively small numbers. [...] As the <b>body</b> <b>needs</b> {{to be able}} to respond to a large number of potential pathogens, it maintains a pool of B cells {{with a wide range of}} specificities. Consequently, while there is almost always at least one B (naive or memory) cell capable of responding to any given epitope (of all that the immune system can react against), there are very few exact duplicates. However, when a single B cell encounters an antigen to which it can bind, it can proliferate very rapidly. Such a group of cells with identical specificity towards the epitope is known as a clone, and is derived from a common [...] "mother" [...] cell. [...] All the [...] "daughter" [...] B cells match the original [...] "mother" [...] cell in their epitope specificity, and they secrete antibodies with identical paratopes. These antibodies are monoclonal antibodies, since they derive from clones of the same parent cell. A polyclonal response is one in which clones of multiple B cells react to the same antigen.|$|E
2500|$|When the <b>body</b> <b>needs</b> glucose for energy, {{glycogen}} phosphorylase, {{with the}} help of an orthophosphate, can cleave away a molecule from the glycogen chain. [...] The cleaved molecule is in the form of glucose-1-phosphate, which can be converted into G6P by phosphoglucomutase. [...] Next, the phosphoryl group on G6P can be cleaved by glucose-6-phosphatase so that a free glucose can be formed. [...] This free glucose can pass through membranes and can enter the bloodstream to travel to other places in the body.|$|E

2500|$|When {{the ratio}} of NADP+ : NADPH increases, the body realizes it needs to produce more NADPH (a {{reducing}} agent for several reactions like fatty acid synthesis and glutathione reduction in erythrocytes). [...] This will cause the G6P to be dehydrogenated by glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase. [...] This irreversible reaction is the initial step of the pentose phosphate pathway, which generates the useful cofactor NADPH as well as ribulose-5-phosphate, a carbon source for the synthesis of other molecules. [...] Also, if the <b>body</b> <b>needs</b> nucleotide precursors of DNA for growth and synthesis, G6P will also be dehydrogenated and enter the pentose phosphate pathway.|$|E
2500|$|If {{blood glucose}} levels are high, the <b>body</b> <b>needs</b> {{a way to}} store the excess glucose. [...] After being {{converted}} to G6P, the molecule {{can be turned into}} glucose-1-phosphate by phosphoglucomutase. [...] Glucose-1-phosphate can then be combined with uridine triphosphate (UTP) to form UDP-glucose, driven by the hydrolysis [...] of UTP, releasing phosphate. [...] Now, the activated UDP-glucose can add to a growing glycogen molecule with the help of glycogen synthase. [...] This is a very efficient storage mechanism for glucose since it costs the body only 1 ATP to store the 1 glucose molecule and virtually no energy to remove it from storage. [...] It {{is important to note that}} glucose-6-phosphate is an allosteric activator of glycogen synthase, which makes sense because when the level of glucose is high the body should store the excess glucose as glycogen. [...] On the other hand, glycogen synthase is inhibited when it is phosphorylated by protein kinase during times of high stress or low levels of blood glucose, via hormone induction by glucagon or adrenaline.|$|E

And the doctor, indignant with Charles Gould's blindness, hastened to change the conversation.|$|E

He ate it, and the brown baby crawled away. Moti Guj dozed, and thought of Deesa. One of many mysteries connected with the elephant is that his huge <b>body</b> <b>needs</b> less sleep than anything else that lives. Four or five hours in the night suffice--two just before midnight, lying down on one side; two just after one o'clock, lying down on the other. The rest of the silent hours are filled with eating and fidgeting and long grumbling soliloquies.|$|E

I know that I have reasoned in my sleep as lucidly as I have ever done awake; and though, when awake, I have forgotten what has passed through my mind, the work of my brain has not been lost: the same ideas have recurred to me again, and though in the recurrence, I cannot remember when I have before employed myself with arranging them, still they come to me as old friends, with whom I am well acquainted. The mind will seldom complain of too much labour, if the body be not injured by indulgence or disease." ...|$|E

6000|$|In {{this age}} a word cannot be said {{in praise of}} Laud, or even in {{compassion}} for his fate, without incurring a charge of bigotry; but fearless of such imputation, I concur with Hume, 'that it is sufficient for his vindication to observe that his errors were the most excusable of all those which prevailed during that zealous period.' A key to the right understanding of those parts of his conduct that brought the most odium upon him in his own time, {{may be found in}} the following passage of his speech before the bar of the House of Peers:--'Ever since I came in place, I have laboured nothing more than that the external publick worship of God, so much slighted in divers parts of this kingdom, might be preserved, and that with as much decency and uniformity as might be. For I evidently saw that the publick neglect of God's service in the outward face of it, and the nasty lying of many places dedicated to that service, had almost cast a damp upon the true and inward worship of God, which while we live in the <b>body,</b> <b>needs</b> external helps, and all little enough to keep it in any vigour.' ...|$|E
