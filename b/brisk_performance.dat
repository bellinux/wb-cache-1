Miss Segal presides over the sordid affairs of an astringent tale with humor, reserve, and charm. It would be hard to improve upon Harold Lang's performance as the heel.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a {{development of a}} psychological positive health scale for healthy people. A personality properties such as lively, positive, active, and <b>brisk</b> <b>performances</b> are one of an indicator for personal psychological positive health. We have developed a psychological positive health inventory, the Psychological Lively Scale(PLS). The PLS consisted of 20 -item positive health scale and 10 -item negative health scale. Later negative scale involved pathological items in order to clarify the meaning of positive scale. A total of 538 subjects (160 men and 378 women) participated in this study. Results of statistical analysis indicated that there were four subscales in the items of positive health, such as positiveness, stability of mood, self-acceptance and life satisfaction. In positive health scale, mean total score of all subjects was 53. 34 and mean total score of men was 54. 25 and of women was 54. 42. In negative health scale, mean total score of all subjects was 20. 61 and of men was 20. 47, of women was 20. 68. Total score of positive health increased with aging of subjects...|$|R

[...] "The writing in this episode leaves a number of {{opportunities}} for nitpicking, but the <b>brisk</b> pace, the <b>performances,</b> and the overall execution more than compensate for any script shortcomings. Much of the episode left me breathless, squealing [...] "Oh my god!" [...] like a 13-year-old at a slumber party." ...|$|R
5000|$|In {{spite of}} the {{existence}} of a magnificent recording of his Violin Concerto by Albert Sammons, whose authority and interpretation of this greatest English work for violin will never be bettered, I had a great ambition to have Sir Edward himself conduct the work. As a youthful and pliant performer without prejudice, who would respond best to his instruction, I selected Yehudi Menuhin as the most promising soloist Fred Gaisberg [...] The first complete recording was made in 1929 for Columbia by Albert Sammons with the New Queen's Hall Orchestra conducted by Sir Henry Wood. HMV hoped to record the work with Kreisler, but he proved elusive (believing Elgar to be a poor conductor) and HMV's producer, Fred Gaisberg, turned instead to the young Yehudi Menuhin. The recording was made at EMI's Abbey Road Studio 1 in June 1932 and has remained in print on 78, LP and CD ever since. These two recordings typify the two contrasting approaches to the work that have existed ever since: Sammons and Wood, in a <b>brisk</b> <b>performance,</b> take just over 43 minutes to play the work; Menuhin and Elgar, in a more overtly expressive reading take almost 50 minutes. Other recordings of the monaural era include those by Jascha Heifetz (1949) and Alfredo Campoli (1954). Both these performances are in the Sammons/Wood tradition, taking, respectively, approximately 42 and 45 minutes.|$|E
50|$|A Motor (UK) {{road test}} in May 1967 reported: It seems somehow insolent to apply medium price {{standards}} to a saloon {{that for a}} combination of speed, comfort and safety {{is as good as}} any in the world, regardless of cost. A North American perspective was provided by Road & Track, whose December 1967 report concluded: Jaguar's big seller in the U.S. remains the E-type sports cars, but the 420 sedan offers just as unique a combination of qualities in its own field. For a reasonable basic price of $5900, Jaguar offers <b>brisk</b> <b>performance,</b> outstanding braking, excellent handling and ride, quality finish, and luxury in abundance, all in an automobile that's easy to maneuver in today's maddening traffic. A road test by Wheels (Australia) in August 1967 enthused: While they can continue to build and sell cars as good as this, there is hope for the man who cares about his motoring. In terms of performance measured under test conditions, 0-60 mph in under 10 seconds and a top speed of more than 125 mi/h km/h were typical. Such performance figures were superior to those of many of the 4.2-litre XJ6 models that followed. Among the few exceptions the testers took was to its 15-16mpg average fuel consumption, which even for the late 1960s was rather high. Combined with the modest size of its two 7 Imperial gallon (31.75 litre) fuel tanks, such fuel consumption gave the model a touring range of only around 250 miles (403 km).|$|E
40|$|Several {{studies have}} shown that oil {{recovery}} significantly increases by low salinity water flooding (LSWF) in sandstones. However, the mechanism of oil recovery improvement is still controversial. CO 2 that develops buffer in the presence of water is expected as a deterrent factor in LSWF efficiency based on the mechanism of interfacial tension reduction due to pH uprising. No bright evidence in literature supports this idea. Herein, a set of core floods including a pair of CO 2 water alternating gas (WAG) and a pair of water injection tests were conducted and the efficiency of LSWF and high salinity water flooding (HSWF) was compared for each pair. HSWF was followed by LSWF in tertiary mode. The results showed that not only did not CO 2 deteriorate LSWF recovery efficiency, it improved recovery, because CO 2 -low salinity WAG showed the best performance among the other types at a constant pore volume injected. The positive results in both secondary and tertiary modes with Kaolinite free samples used herein showed that Kaolinite release was not the critical phenomenon in LSWF <b>brisk</b> <b>performance.</b> In addition, different pressure behaviors of CO 2 WAG processes in comparison with the reported behavior of LSWF proves that LSWF performance may not depend on how pressure changes through flooding...|$|E
40|$|In 2007 the Austrian {{economy has}} {{expanded}} by 3. 4 percent. This {{was the second}} year in a row of GDP growing by more than 3 percent. The impetus came from exports again with goods as well as services showing vivid growth rates. Investment demand accelerated in 2007 but lagged behind the dynamism usually seen during phases of economic upswing. Gross capital formation advanced by 4. 8 percent in real terms. Contrary to 2006, this time investment growth of equipments (machines and vehicles) outperformed those of constructions. Private household consumption again developed untypically weak for this phase of business cycle. Subdue wage development and heading up inflation eroded personal income which allowed private consumption to expand only by a mere 1. 4 percent. Annual inflation rate reached just 2. 2 percent in 2007, but considerably gained momentum towards the end of the year. Soaring prices for agricultural products and fuel were the main driver of this development. Labour market variables again profited substantially from the <b>brisk</b> economic <b>performance</b> with unemployment falling further and employment expanding swiftly.
