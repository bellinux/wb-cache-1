40|$|Abstract: This paper {{compares the}} {{wastewater}} treatment technologies at Blantyre and Soche {{wastewater treatment works}} (WWTW) in Malawi with technologies of a similar case according to the ED-WAVE tool to determine if existing cases in the tool can be invoked and appropriately modified {{to arrive at a}} particular design alternative. The ED-WAVE tool is a shareware PC based package for imparting training on wastewater treatment technologies. The system consists of four modules viz. Reference Library, Process Builder, Case Study Manager, and Treatment Adviser. The paper also compares the reduction in the levels of BOD 5, COD, and TSS at the three respective treatment works. The study established that there is a similarity in the sequencing of treatment units of Municipal Case 6 in the ED-WAVE tool and the sequencing of treatment units at Blantyre and Soche WWTW, respectively. All the three plants incorporate screening, grit removal, aerobic biological treatment, and sedimentation. Soche and Blantyre WWTW use hand-raked inclined <b>bar</b> <b>screens</b> and constant velocity grit channels, where longitudinal flow velocity is hydraulically controlled. Rotary mechanically-raked <b>bar</b> <b>screens</b> and mechanically stirred grit chambers are used in the ED-WAVE tool. In addition, Municipal Case 6 uses oxidation ditches for aerobic biological treatment while Blantyre and Soche WWTW use trickling filters. BOD 5 removal efficiency at Soche WWTW at 95 % and 96 % for dry season and wet season, respectively, is comparable to the removal efficiency at Municipal Case 6 (95 %). The dry season BOD 5 removal efficiency at Blantyre WWTW at 87 % is slightly lower than the removal efficiency at Municipal Case 6. TSS removal efficiency at Soche WWTW is at 80 % in the we...|$|R

The technical difficulties faced whilst performing experimental tests made CFD almost the only possible way to study the flow field in detail. In the present work the flow of sand-water mixtures through a sudden expansion in a rectangular horizontal duct is investigated by means of a two-fluid model. Due to the lack of experimental data available, a sensitivity analysis is performed to quantify the influence of the terms of the two-fluid model which proved negligible in the horizontal pipe case, topic of previous investigations. Computations were performed for either dilute or dense mixtures, in order to study the effect of the mean solids concentration on the flow field. Moreover, the effect of channel width is investigated to assess the validity of the hypothesis of two-dimensionality of the flow...|$|R

We found that juvenile Pacific lamprey were highly nocturnal with> 90 % of their swimming activity restricted to hours of darkness. They also had a strong preference for substrate and remained near the bottom of test aquaria during daylight hours. This behavior is consistent with lack of buoyancy compensation (i. e., they have no swim bladder and slightly negative specific gravity). That lamprey are mainly demersal and nocturnal would be advantageous for predator avoidance, but this same behavior increases the possibility that they will pass dams via turbines and underneath the screen or surfac...|$|E
40|$|In older communities, where {{combined}} sewer systems are still common, storm water flows often exceed the sewer system’s hydraulic capacity. Redevelopment of urban areas can also increase the impervious area in the sewershed, which, in turn, increases storm water flows to {{combined sewer}}s. Storage is often the best measure for attenuating peak combined sewer flows. Storage facilities have been used extensively for Combined Sewer Overflow (CSO) mitigation (Urbonas and Stahre, 1993; Field, 1997). Specific CSO retention methods include underground storage (e. g., tunnels), in-receiving water storage, and retention basins (RBs). RBs may be built in-line or off-line. This fact sheet describes near-surface, off-line RBs. CSO RBs capture and store some of the excess combined sewer flow {{that would otherwise be}} bypassed to receiving waters. Stored flows are subsequently returned to the sewer system during dry weather periods, when in-line flows are reduced and capacity is available at the treatment facility. RBs can be designed to control both flow rate and water quality. Figure 1 shows an example of a multi-stage CSO RB with treatment capabilities. This facility handles peak flows by routing them through a mechanical <b>bar</b> <b>screen</b> and then pumping them into the first compartment.

40|$|ABSTRACT. A {{study was}} {{performed}} in Viçosa, Minas Gerais, Brazil, to determine the feasibility of using solar radiation to disinfect treated domestic wastewater (TDWW). The effluent from a residential development, after passing through a pre-treatment unit (<b>bar</b> <b>screen</b> and grit channel) and a septic tank, was used as supply. After the septic tank, the TDWW had mean values of 286 mg L− 1 COD, 54 mg L− 1 TSS, and 65 NTU turbidity. A square cement block reactor was constructed (located at 20 ° 45 14 S, 42 ° 52 53 W) and used to disinfect the reclaimed TDWW. Fixed depths of water (0. 05, 0. 10, 0. 15, and 0. 20 m) were tested at different exposure times from November 2004 to May 2005. Solar UV disinfection (SODIS) was effective in reducing mean concentration of indicator microorganisms, i. e., total coliform (TC) and Escherichia coli (E. coli), after 8 h of exposure to direct sunlight. Statistical analysis showed that the inactivation rates of E. coli did not significantly vary due to turbidity or dissolved oxygen. A model was developed to estimate the surviving E. coli population after SODIS from its initial population, depth of water treated, and solar energy received. The model indicated that, for a fluence accumulated of 32. 91 MJ m− 2, a 4 log reduction of E. coli population was achieved with a wastewater depth of 0. 05 m in the SODIS reactor...|$|E

40|$|An {{oxidation}} ditch is a modified activated sludge biological treatment process that utilizes long solids retention times (SRTs) to remove biodegradable organics. Oxidation ditches are typically complete mix systems, {{but they can}} be modified to approach plug flow conditions.

Typical oxidation ditch treatment systems consist of a single or multichannel configuration within a ring, oval, or horseshoe-shaped basin.
