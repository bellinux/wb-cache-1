5|$|The {{choice of}} de Castries {{as the local}} {{commander}} at Điện Biên Phủ was, in retrospect, a <b>bad</b> <b>one.</b> Navarre had picked de Castries, a cavalryman in the 18th-century tradition, because Navarre envisioned Điện Biên Phủ as a mobile battle. Điện Biên Phủ required someone adept at World War I-style trench warfare, something for which de Castries was not suited.|$|E
5|$|All Hands on the <b>Bad</b> <b>One</b> is {{the fifth}} studio album by the American rock band Sleater-Kinney, {{released}} on May 2, 2000, by Kill Rock Stars. The album was produced by John Goodmanson and recorded from December 1999 to January 2000 at Jackpot! Studio in Portland, Oregon and John & Stu's Place in Seattle, Washington. The music on the record ranges from soft melodies to fast punk rock guitar work, while the lyrics address multiple media issues, such as the image of women in rock, music journalism, and violence as entertainment, among others.|$|E

5|$|In his Commentary on Isaiah (1529), Zwingli {{noted that}} there were three kinds of governments: monarchy, aristocracy, and democracy. He {{expressed}} his preference for aristocracy which is not surprising given his experience with the Zürich council. In the publication, rather than comparing the three forms of government, he gave a defence of aristocracy against a monarchy. He argued that a monarchy would invariably descend to tyranny. A monarchy had inherent weaknesses in that a good ruler could be easily replaced by a <b>bad</b> <b>one</b> or a single ruler could be easily corrupted. An aristocracy with more people involved did not have these disadvantages.|$|E
5|$|Unlike the {{majority}} of Trollope's triangles, Mary is not called upon to judge between a good suitor and a <b>bad</b> <b>one,</b> but between two good men. Gilmore {{is presented as a}} sympathetic and admirable character; the reader learns far less about Captain Marrable's character, and is given no reason why Mary should prefer him to his rival. To Trollope, a woman does not necessarily fall in love because of a man's merits; and it is very wrong for a woman to marry where she does not love, regardless of her suitor's worthy qualities.|$|E
25|$|The {{unabridged}} version {{contains many}} illustrations with drawings, photogravures, and coloured maps. It also contains vivid narratives of personal adventures of the author, {{his views on}} British expansionism, passages of deep reflection about the requirements of a civilised government, criticism of military and political leaders and religion. The first edition was reviewed by The Times, which described it as containing material sufficient for two good books and one <b>bad</b> <b>one,</b> with the <b>bad</b> <b>one</b> being the more interesting.|$|E

25|$|The majlis is {{also the}} means to elect a new caliph.

Al-Mawardi also said in emergencies when there is no caliphate and no majlis, the people themselves should create a majlis, select a list of candidates for caliph, then the majlis should select from the list of candidates.|$|E
25|$|Symonds and Gilchrist added {{a steady}} 70 runs before Symonds saw his stumps tumble to a superb Panesar ball. Warne then joined Gilchrist at the crease and put England's bowling to the sword, with a 58 run {{partnership}} in only seven overs, including a four and six {{off the first}} two balls Warne faced. Gilchrist was given out caught behind, although replays indicated the decision was a <b>bad</b> <b>one.</b> Lee joined Warne at 7/317 but departed quickly, and Clark then delivered a sparkling tail-ender innings of 35. Warne's fairy-tale dream of a maiden Test century in his final match ended when he was easily stumped after swinging wildly at a Panesar ball, but he had earned the top-scorer mantle with 71, and England found themselves with a deficit of 102.|$|E

25|$|Oral tales, not {{recorded}} until much later, include the widely reported and possibly mythical one that Livingstone used to beat corpses at funerals with his walking stick {{to make sure}} they were dead and not simply shamming. His wife defended him passionately, claiming he was charitable to the hungry and sick. Her defence is quite plausible: Livingstone was quick-tempered and may have been violent and kind at different times. However, his distribution of food may have been limited to the headmen appointed by him to control the estate workforce rather than general. Her defence was that Livingstone was good master, not a <b>bad</b> <b>one</b> as the commission claimed. The concept of the master-servant relationship was at the heart of colonial society, but this concept was precisely what Chilembwe was fighting with his schools and self-help schemes, and ultimately why Livingstone was killed.|$|E
25|$|While {{the four}} armored cruisers turned to {{starboard}} to run westward, Furor and Pluton turned inside them {{and made their}} run closer to the coast. The blockading American battleships and armored cruisers opened fire on the two destroyers as they emerged from the channel, hitting both destroyers several times, but then {{turned their attention to}} pursuing the Spanish cruisers. The two damaged destroyers put on speed, pursued only by the armed yacht , a ship less well armed than the destroyers, but larger, faster, and undamaged. Gloucester hit both destroyers repeatedly. In short order, casualties aboard Furor began to climb, and her stern flooded and became submerged; all her boilers were destroyed and her engine damaged; fires broke out in several places, including a particularly <b>bad</b> <b>one</b> in the engine room, which lay over the shell room, causing a danger of explosion; a hole was punched in her side; and finally her steering failed.|$|E
25|$|In {{advance of}} {{becoming}} {{president of the}} Society of Authors in August 2013, Pullman led a call for authors to be fairly paid for ebook library loans. Under arrangements in force at the time, authors were paid 6p per library loan by the government for physical books, but nothing for ebook loans. In addition, the Society found that publishers had possibly been inadvertently underpaying authors for ebook loans. Altogether, this may have resulted in authors losing up to two-thirds of the income they would have received on the sale and loan of a physical book. Addressing this issue, Pullman said: New media and new forms of buying and lending are all very interesting, {{for all kinds of}} reasons, but one principle remains unchanged: authors must be paid fairly for their work. Any arrangement that doesn't acknowledge that principle is a <b>bad</b> <b>one,</b> and needs to be changed. That is our whole argument.|$|E

25|$|At a later {{election}} Hackett {{was opposed to}} John Madden, and this time lost by only a small margin. In 1882 he resigned his positions at Trinity College and went to Western Australia to become a squatter in the Gascoyne district. His first season was a <b>bad</b> <b>one</b> {{and he decided to}} give up the land. He joined forces with Charles Harper, the proprietor of The West Australian, and very soon his influence on this paper began to be felt. The Western Mail was established in 1885 and both papers became prosperous. In 1887 Hackett became editor of The West Australian and was a strong advocate of responsible government. Western Australia received its constitution in 1890, and Alexander Forrest selected Hackett as the first man to be asked to join the nominee Western Australian Legislative Council. The population of the colony was still under 50,000 but was beginning to rise, and the discovery of gold accelerated this. The newspapers grew with the population and became very valuable properties. Hackett, as editor, was writing a daily leading article, and was also the business manager.|$|E

500|$|All Hands on the <b>Bad</b> <b>One</b> was {{released}} on May 2, 2000, by the independent record label Kill Rock Stars, which also released the band's previous two albums. The album cover features a photo of Brownstein being hauled off a dance floor. According to Weiss, [...] "She worked herself into a frenzy and passed out. People are laughing in the background because she's wearing a bunny suit." [...] All Hands on the <b>Bad</b> <b>One</b> reached number 177 on the US Billboard Top 200 chart, #12 on the Heatseekers Albums chart, and #5 on the KEXP Top 90.3 Album Chart for 2000. The band promoted the album with a tour across North America and England, featuring old and new songs. The band also did the set-up and sold merchandise themselves. As of August 2002, the album has sold 73,000 copies in the U.S. according to Nielsen SoundScan. As of February 2015, All Hands on the <b>Bad</b> <b>One</b> has sold 98,000 copies.|$|E

50|$|Furthermore, the {{usefulness}} of alpha-beta pruning is heavily dependent on {{the order in which}} moves are considered. Good moves must be considered before <b>bad</b> <b>ones</b> in order for the <b>bad</b> <b>ones</b> to be neglected. In particular, checking and capturing moves are key for pruning, because they are often much better than other moves. In Arimaa software the speedup provided by alpha-beta pruning is less, because captures are rarer. In rated games played on arimaa.com, only 3% of steps result in capture, compared to about 19% of chess moves that result in capture.|$|R
