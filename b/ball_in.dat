Fifteen minutes {{from the end of the}} match QPR equalised, Marsh's shot with his right foot went in off the post. A corner followed for QPR who were now dominating Albion with their style of play. Allen crossed it in to Lazarus, but the Albion goalkeeper saved the shot with his legs. With eight minutes to go, one of Albion defenders mis-kicked the <b>ball</b> <b>in</b> their own penalty area. Hunt rushed in for the chance but Sheppard once again saved the game for Albion. The ball ran free to Mike Lazarus who tapped the ball into the back of an empty net to increase the scoreline to 3–2 in QPR's favour. A final attack from QPR came in the closing moments of the game as Lazarus took the ball past two defenders and into the box, his subsequent shot hit the outside of the post and went wide.|$|E
40|$|The {{classical}} Apollonius' {{problem is}} to construct circles that are tangent to three given circles in a plane. This problem was posed by Apollonius of Perga in his work "Tangencies". The Sylvester problem, which was introduced by the English mathematician J. J. Sylvester, asks for the smallest circle that encloses a finite collection of points in the plane. In this paper, we study the following generalized version of the Sylvester problem and its connection {{to the problem of}} Apollonius: given two finite collections of Euclidean <b>balls</b> <b>in</b> R^n, find the smallest Euclidean ball that encloses all of the <b>balls</b> <b>in</b> the first collection and intersects all of the <b>balls</b> <b>in</b> the second collection. We also study a generalized version of the Fermat-Torricelli problem stated as follows: given two finite collections composed of three Euclidean <b>balls</b> <b>in</b> R^n, find a point that minimizes the sum of the farthest distances to the <b>balls</b> <b>in</b> the first collection and shortest distances to the <b>balls</b> <b>in</b> the second collection...|$|R
