25|$|While still {{considered}} one of the most polluted places on the planet, the valley's air pollution problems are not as <b>bad</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> were several decades ago. One major problem that was brought under control was the lead contamination in the air with the introduction of unleaded gasoline. Two other contaminants that have been brought under control are carbon monoxide and sulfur dioxide. The contamination problems that remain are primarily with ozone and fine particles (soot) (between 2.5micrometers and 10micrometers). Thirty to fifty percent of the time, Mexico City's levels of fine particles of ten micrometers, the most dangerous, exceed levels recommended by the World Health Organization.|$|E
25|$|In 1966, due to uneven {{scheduling}} {{that left}} out new AAWU members Oregon and Oregon State, UCLA was 3–1 in conference games and 8-1 overall. The Bruins lost only one game, at Washington 16–3. USC was 5–0, but lost out of conference to Miami (Florida). It was widely {{assumed that the}} winner of the 1966 game between 8th ranked UCLA and 7th ranked USC would go to the 1967 Rose Bowl. UCLA star QB Gary Beban was out with a broken ankle, but backup Norman Dow, making his first and only start at QB, led UCLA to a 14–7 win. A vote the next Monday among the AAWU conference athletic directors put USC in the Rose Bowl. It was speculated that this was to make up for 1964 when Oregon State (8-2 overall, 4-1 in conference) was voted in ahead of USC (7-3 overall, 4-1 in conference) despite USC's 20-17 upset of #1 Notre Dame in the season's final game; the Oregon State coach at the time was Tommy Prothro, who became UCLA's coach in 1965. In addition, the directors believed Beban could not play for UCLA in the Rose Bowl due to the broken ankle, thereby giving the Big 10 representative (Purdue) a better chance to win. UCLA students protested by blocking the Northbound lanes of I-405 at Wilshire Boulevard. A week after the vote, USC made the voters look really <b>bad</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> lost to Notre Dame 51–0. This still stands as the worst defeat in USC Trojan football history. USC entered the Rose Bowl unranked and lost to Purdue, 14–13. Ironically, Beban's ankle had healed and he could have played. UCLA finished fifth in both polls.|$|E
500|$|Several reviewers re-watched {{the episode}} {{after the end}} of the series. Zack Handlen {{reviewed}} the episode for The A.V. Club in April, 2010. He thought that the Ferengi were a [...] "one note" [...] opponent for the crew, but that in this episode they weren't as <b>bad</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> were in [...] "". He thought that the plot made the crew look a little silly, saying [...] "Put it this way: if somebody showed up at your door and said, [...] "Hey, we want to give you this weapon you used to murder a bunch of guys we knew years ago," [...] wouldn't you be a little suspicious?" [...] He gave the episode an overall mark of C+. James Hunt reviewed the episode for the website [...] "Den of Geek" [...] in November 2012, and said that it was the best episode of the series up until that point. He thought that little touches such as the Stargazer using the movie-era effect for warp drive was a cute touch as it was meant to be an older ship than the Enterprise but also pointed out that [...] "it also means that the Picard Manoeuvre is completely invalidated, because you literally see the ship move from point A to B before the original disappears". He felt that the conflict between Picard and Bok was well realised, and that the characterisation was good.|$|E

I don't {{think now that}} people {{can be divided into}} the good and the <b>bad</b> <b>as</b> though <b>they</b> were two {{separate}} races or creations. What are called good women may have terrible things in them, mad moods of recklessness, assertion, jealousy, sin. <b>Bad</b> women, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> are termed, may have in them sorrow, repentance, pity, sacrifice. And I don't think Mrs. Erlynne a bad woman--I know she's not.|$|R
2500|$|Sachs also {{described}} Naomi as a layered character whose nature would be explored as the series progressed. With regard to playing such roles, McCord stated, [...] "I tend {{to reach out}} to people like Clark because I can see they are putting on a facade and are not as <b>bad</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> seem. They will eventually let their guard down and become nice people." [...] The actress opted not to review the original series before beginning her role in the spin-off, expressing a desire for Naomi to have her own identity.|$|E
2500|$|The Economist at {{the time}} alleged that these signs were [...] "not as <b>bad</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> look," [...] since Mexico is more democratic, it enjoys a {{competitive}} export market, has a well-run economy despite the crisis, and there are tentative signs that {{the violence in the}} country may be plummeting. But if voters want the PRI back, it is because [...] "the alternatives [...] weak." [...] The newspaper also alleges that Mexico's preferences should have gone left-wing, but the candidate that represented that movement – Andrés Manuel López Obrador – was seen with [...] "disgraceful behavior." [...] The conservative candidate, Josefina Vázquez Mota, was deemed worthy, but was considered by The Economist to have carried out a [...] "shambolic campaign." [...] Thus, Peña Nieto wins by default and was considered by the newspaper as the [...] "least bad choice" [...] for reform in Mexico.|$|E
2500|$|Netanyahu defines {{capitalism}} as [...] "the {{ability to}} have individual initiative and competition to produce goods and services with profit, but not to shut out somebody else from {{trying to do the}} same." [...] He says that his views developed while he was working as an economic consult for Boston Consulting Group: [...] "It {{was the first time that}} the Boston Consulting Group looked at governments and worked for governments. They wanted to do a strategic plan for the government of Sweden. I was on that case and looked at other governments. So I went around to other governments in Europe in 1976 and I was looking at Britain. I was looking at France. I was looking at other countries, and I could see that they were stymied by concentrations of power that prevented competition. And I thought, hmm, as <b>bad</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> are, ours was worse because we had very little room for private sector competition to the extent that we had government-controlled or union-controlled companies, and so you really didn't get the competition or the growth... And I said, well, if I ever have a chance, I'll change that." ...|$|E
