500|$|Andrew Hampp {{felt that}} [...] "for an album [...] {{inspired}} by performance art, {{it was the}} one moment where music and shock value merged indelibly and credibly." [...] The performance also received criticism for the vomiting act. Recovered bulimic Demi Lovato complained that the show [...] "glamorized" [...] eating disorders. In response to the controversy, Brown told MTV News, [...] "I can understand why people would make that association, but my performance is really not a statement about eating disorders themselves." [...] Gaga confessed on Today, [...] "Millie and I know that not everybody's going to love that performance, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>both</b> really believe in artistic expression and strong identities, and I support her and what she does. Artpop, my new album, is about bringing art and music together in the spirit of creative rebellion, and for us, that performance was art in its purest form." ...|$|E
500|$|Gaga {{also held}} a one-off concert for ArtRave: The Artpop Ball inside a six-storey vending machine at Doritos' annual South by Southwest (SXSW) music festival at Austin, Texas. The city's Music and Entertainment {{division}} had initially denied permission to Gaga for playing inside the venue citing {{that it was}} for [...] "public safety concerns". Don Pitts from the division said that the venue being in close proximity with a parking lot was the reason they had to cancel Gaga's application. On March 6, 2014, {{it was announced that}} Gaga would indeed play at the venue. Tickets were sold to the fans through different competitions and challenges. Randal Lane from Forbes reported that the concert would support Gaga's Born This Way Foundation and charity events, but nevertheless opined that [...] "the way they're doling out the tickets is still crass". The concert was criticized when artist Millie Brown vomited a green liquid over Gaga during the performance of [...] "Swine" [...] from Artpop. The performance received complaints about [...] "glamorizing" [...] eating disorders. In response to the controversy, Brown told MTV News: [...] "I can understand why people would make that association, but my performance is really not a statement about eating disorders themselves."

2500|$|In {{a letter}} to Churchill written that night, Robert Boothby {{asserted}} that parliamentary opinion was hardening against Halifax, claiming in a postscript that according to Clement Davies, [...] "Attlee & Greenwood are unable {{to distinguish between the}} PM & Halifax and are not prepared to serve under the latter." [...] Davies (who thought Chamberlain should go, and be replaced by Churchill) had lunched with Attlee and Greenwood (and argued his case) shortly before they saw Chamberlain. However, Hugh Dalton noted in his diary entry for 9 May that he had talked to Attlee, who [...] "agrees with my preference for Halifax over Churchill, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>both</b> think either would be tolerable." ...|$|E

2500|$|In late 2011 Stone {{began working}} on his second solo album, Broken Brights. He told Surfing World Magazine, “ecording with Julia is cool <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>both</b> have our hands on the wheel. This was an {{opportunity}} to grab the wheel and do some burn-outs". It was released in Australia on 13 July 2012 which peaked at No.2. The title track from the album was released as the lead single in March that year as a free download on Triple J’s Home and Hosed. The second single, [...] "Bird on the Buffalo", is a metaphor for a musing relationship between lovers. and the video features the actress Isabel Lucas. According to Indie Londons Jack Foley, the third single, [...] "Wooden Chair" [...] is [...] "mesmerising in a low-key, effortlessly brilliant manner that also manages to include an intoxicating background whistle. It’s breezy and romantic without really even trying to be". It was featured in the US TV show, Private Practice, in Season 6, Episode 3 [...] "Good Grief". The fourth single, [...] "Monsters", had its video premiered on The Huffington Post.|$|E
2500|$|Creator Elizabeth Meriwether sees Nick, Schmidt and Winston [...] "on the weirder side of things". The {{producers}} stated {{learning more}} about the characters by seeing the actors' work and that [...] "We probably rely on them more than we should" [...] to define the characters. For example, the producers found more variety in Nick's character in season 1 and enjoyed Johnson's improvisations, so they relayed Coach's attributed rage issues to Nick. Nick is a childhood friend of Winston, has been best friends with Schmidt since his college days and becomes close to Jess, so his character connects the most with the other loftmates and is often part of their stories. Jake Johnson (Nick) noted the contrast to the original plans for his character, as season 1 turned Nick into [...] "an idiot, he's not keeping anyone together", and that he did not fully understand his character in season 1, partly because the character might not have figured himself out at the age of 30. Johnson felt that initially it seemed like Nick hated Schmidt for being a douchebag, but the show later teamed them up like The Odd Couple, showing their genuine friendship and simultaneous idiocy as they get into trouble. According to Johnson, he and Max Greenfield (Schmidt) [...] "couldn't be more different [...] and it's very much like Nick and Schmidt, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>both</b> really {{get a kick out of}} the other guy" [...] on set.|$|E
2500|$|Bene Gesserit {{are trained}} in what they call [...] "the Voice" [...] a means [...] "to control others merely by {{selected}} tone shadings of the voice." [...] By modulating the subtleties of her voice, a Bene Gesserit can issue commands on a subconscious level, compelling obedience in others that they cannot resist, whether they are consciously aware of the attempt or not. This control can be as subtle as influencing thoughts and motivations, or as strong as forcing physical actions and even temporary paralysis in the subject. To effect this, the Bene Gesserit must [...] "register" [...] the intended target by analyzing his or her personality and vocal patterns through observation or seemingly innocuous direct questions. Training in the Voice is independent of the Reverend Mother ritual, so individuals outside the order may even be instructed in its use. Prior to Dune, Jessica has begun teaching it to Paul; after the Reverend Mother Mohiam tests him in the novel, she urges Jessica to [...] "ignore the regular order of training. His own safety requires the Voice. He already has a good start in it, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>both</b> know how much more he needs ... and that desperately." [...] Jessica herself later notes of Paul's novice attempt: [...] "The tone, the timbre excellent – imperative, very sharp. A slightly lower pitch would have been better, but it could still fall within this man's spectrum." [...] The Voice may also be subtly employed in any manner of conversation, public speaking, or debate to help soothe, convince, persuade, influence, or otherwise enhance {{the effect of the}} words being spoken.|$|E

60|$|Neither of us {{spoke of}} the boat, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>both</b> thought of it. That was made {{apparent}} by our avoidance of the subject, and by our agreeing--without agreement--to make my recovery {{of the use of}} my hands a question of so many hours, not of so many weeks.|$|E
