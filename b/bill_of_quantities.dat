In spite of that age long history, the <b>bills</b> <b>of</b> <b>quantities</b> (BOQ) seems to be the most misinterpreted aspects of building documentation today. The pros and cons <b>of</b> the <b>bills</b> <b>of</b> <b>quantities</b> have been deliberated on for many years and have generated strongly held and differing views. Whilst this is recognised, the essence {{of this study is to}} evaluate the reliability <b>of</b> <b>bills</b> <b>of</b> <b>quantities</b> in building project procurement. The study was carried out using secondary data from some recently completed building projects within the Northern Ireland construction industry. Using secondary data from completed projects, the budgetary reliability <b>of</b> the <b>bills</b> <b>of</b> <b>quantities</b> in building project procurement was investigated. Data analysis was carried out using percentage deviation of final account figures from the <b>bills</b> <b>of</b> <b>quantities.</b> Further analyses were carried out using root mean square deviation and relative mean absolute deviation methods of analyses. Results showed that the budgetary reliability <b>of</b> the <b>bills</b> <b>of</b> <b>quantities</b> seems to vary depending on project types. Whilst a deviation of - 3 to 4 % was obtained on housing projects analysed, the deviation on educational projects was between - 4 and 17 % whist on commercial project, it came out to be between - 20 and 20 % and in the case of refurbishment projects, a deviation of between - 11 and 37 % was obtained. This seems to suggest that the more complex a project is, the less reliable it is to use the BOQ to guarantee cost certainty...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Under {{the current}} {{construction}} cost management system, <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>quantity</b> {{is only applicable}} to project transaction period and project implementation period, while the earlier stage of project which is decisive for construction cost control still adopts estimation and budget estimate under quota mode. However, hysteresis quality of quota cannot timely reflect the current situations of market, causing the interface failure between the two modes, and even the failure of investment control. The paper, in light of foreign advanced experience and China’s national condition characteristics, puts forward the design philosophy of information data base of construction cost which is more suitable for valuation with bill quantity, which provides completed construction cost data as basis for the construction cost overall-process management based on <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>quantity...</b>|$|R
40|$|Producing a <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>quantity</b> is a knowledge-based, {{dynamic and}} {{collaborative}} process, and evolves with variances and current evidence. However, {{within the context}} of information system practice in BIM, knowledge of cost estimation has not been represented, nor has it been integrated into the processes based on BIM. This paper intends to establish an innovative means of taking data from the BIM linked to a project, and using it to create the necessary items for a <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>quantity</b> that will enable cost estimation to be undertaken for the project. Our framework is founded upon the belief that three components are necessary to gain a full awareness of the domain which is being computerised; the information type which is to be assessed for compatibility (syntax), the definition for the pricing domain (semantics), and the precise implementation environment for the standards being taken into account (pragmatics). In order to achieve this, a prototype is created that allows a cost item for the <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>quantity</b> to be spontaneously generated, by means of the semantic web ontology and a forward chain algorithm. Within this paper, ‘cost items’ signify the elements included in a <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>quantity,</b> including details <b>of</b> their description, <b>quantity</b> and price. As a means of authenticating the process being developed, the authors of this work effectively implemented it in the production of cost items. In addition, the items created were contrasted with those produced by specialists. For this reason, this innovative framework introduces the possibility of a new means of applying semantic web ontology and forward chain algorithm to construction professional practice resulting in automatic cost estimation. These key outcomes demonstrate that, decoupling the professional practice into three key components of syntax, semantics and pragmatics can provide tangible benefits to domain use...|$|R

5000|$|In 1949 {{the newly}} elected {{national}} government, which ideologically favoured private enterprise, appointed [...] "Stan Goosman" [...] as both Minister of Works and Minister of the State Hydro-electric Department. By 1951 the projected project delays were serious enough to draw criticism from the Electrical Supply Authority. By now aware of the projected energy shortfalls and the shortage of government resources to complete six other hydroelectric projects that were underway as well as complete Roxburgh, Goosman's response was to announce on 25 September 1951 that tenders would be called from interested parties to undertake the civil aspects of the project. This required the rapid production of tender documents and specifications by a short staffed government design staff. Bidders had the choice of offering on either a <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>quantities</b> basis or by nominating a 'target estimate' plus a 4% fee. In this type of contract the Government met all costs and the contractor received a fee of 4% of the total cost up to the target estimate. If the cost varied from the estimate, then 25% of the change was added to or subtracted from the fee. A 'no loss clause' meant that if the cost overruns where high enough the contractor could lose their entire fee but would not suffer any further loss, other than those for not meeting agree completion dates. Eight tenders were received. Three were fixed price with a <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>quantities</b> and the remainder were target estimates. The Ministry of Works had estimated that the work would cost £10,198,000 and the average for seven of the bidders was £10,068,838. [...] The lowest bid was £7,4412,419 from Holland, Hannen & Cubitts of England. The government engaged Sir Alexander Gibb & Partners of London to assess {{the ability of the}} bidders to undertake the work.|$|E

5000|$|A {{definitive}} {{estimate is}} prepared from fully designed {{plans and specifications}} (or nearly so), preferably what are called contract documents (CD). The contract documents also establish the Scope of Work (SOW). The standard method is to review and understand the design package and take off (or perform a quantity survey of) the project scope by itemizing it into line items with measured quantities. RSMeans refers to this as, [...] "Scope out the project," [...] and, [...] "Quantify." [...] Some jurisdictions or areas of practice define the itemization and measuration in certain terms, such as RICS and may have specific rules for development of a <b>Bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>quantities,</b> or BOQ.

50|$|In {{the modern}} industrialized world, {{construction}} usually involves {{the translation of}} designs into reality. A formal design team may be assembled to plan the physical proceedings, and to integrate those proceedings with the other parts. The design usually consists of drawings and specifications, usually prepared by a design team including Architect, civil engineers, mechanical engineers, electrical engineers, structural engineers, fire protection engineers, planning consultants, architectural consultants, and archaeological consultants. The design team is most commonly employed by (i.e. in contract with) the property owner. Under this system, once the design is completed by the design team, a number of construction companies or construction management companies may then be asked {{to make a bid}} for the work, either based directly on the design, or on the basis of drawings and a <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>quantities</b> provided by a quantity surveyor. Following evaluation of bids, the owner typically awards a contract to the most cost efficient bidder.|$|E
5000|$|For instance, a <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>quantities</b> {{is a list}} of all the {{materials}} (and other work such as amount of excavation) of a project which have sufficient detail to obtain a realistic cost, or rate per described item of work/material. The tenders should not only show the unit cost per material/work, but should also if possible, break it down to labour, plant and material costs. In this way the individual who is selecting the tender will be quite confident that the tender is feasible. Bids are not only chosen on cost alone. Sometimes contractors submit lower tenders to win the contract and win the work. Either the costs that the contractor incurs are greater than the price he is charging the client (as a consequence of a lower tender determining the contract sum), and thus is likely to go insolvent, or he will claim for [...] "loss and/or expense" [...] due to discrepancies in the contract documents (this can be done deliberately). The lowest tender is not always a feasible tender. The lowest tender is the most likely to increase the contract sum the most throughout the course of the project.|$|E
