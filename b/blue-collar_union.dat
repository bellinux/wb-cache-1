Wallace's appeal to blue-collar workers and union members (who usually voted Democratic) hurt Hubert Humphrey in Northern states like Ohio, Illinois, New Jersey, Michigan, and Wisconsin. A mid-September AFL-CIO internal poll showed that one in three union members supported Wallace, and a Chicago Sun-Times poll showed that Wallace had a plurality of 44% of white steelworkers in Chicago. Both Humphrey and Richard Nixon were able to peel back some Wallace support by November; the unions highlighted the flow of Northern union jobs to Wallace's Alabama, a right-to-work state (although Wallace publicly opposed right-to-work laws), and Nixon persuaded enough Southerners that a [...] "divided vote" [...] would give the election to Humphrey.

Several individual characteristics such as level of full-time work experience, and an individual emphasis on job security were identified as important determinants of union membership amongst this group of salaried professionals; however, institutional characteristics such as industry and public versus private sector employment tended to dominate as predictors of union membership.

The {{considerably}} raised fees to union unemployment funds made by the centre-right government in January 2007 have caused a fall of union density of a magnitude quite unique in modern Swedish history: from 77 % in 2006 to 71 % in 2008 (annual averages; full-time students working part-time excluded). In private sector union density declined from 71 % in 2006 to 65 % in 2008.

40|$|Stefan Svallfors takes Sweden as {{an example}} of how {{politics}} as organized combat has changed quite dramatically in the last couple of decades. Sweden is often cited as an opposite to the US among the rich capitalist countries, but it has experienced a number of rather deep policy changes which have not received the attention they deserve. He argues that there are a number of aspects that have recently changed Swedish organized politics in rather fundamental ways including the dismantling of corporatist arrangements, changes in the economic policy decision-making framework, increased income inequality, weakened political parties and changes in their social bases, decline of <b>blue-collar</b> <b>union</b> strength, growth of the policy professionals category, increased impact of multi-level politics, and the mediatization of politics. What this amounts to, he claims, is a very different form of elite-driven policy-making than the old corporatist structures. An amorphous and quite invisible but still highly elite-driven process has emerged, in which inequality has increased dramatically, and the impact of money on politics has become stronger even in Sweden. In his lecture, he discusses the implications of these developments for current politics and policy-making in Sweden...|$|E

A blood pressure screening booth was set up at the Convention Center in Los Angeles where union officials and guests attending the convention could be screened. Minimal data were collected on each person screened while more extensive data were collected on those with elevated blood pressures. Those taking the program were encouraged to seek care once they returned home, and follow-up letters, including a stamped post card to be returned to the High Blood Pressure Council of Los Angeles were sent to them following the convention to determine whether or not they sought medical care. The study indicated that high blood pressure continues to be a significant public health problem; there was a high percentage of individuals with undetected high blood pressure, and among those who knew they had high blood pressure a large number were not under the care of a physician and a large number under care did not have blood pressures in the normal range.

40|$|Important {{throughout}} the 20 th century, trade unions are an influential social actor {{that can affect}} and influence various policies, public opinion, and working standards through collective agreements, social activism, and political partnerships. Both within and extending beyond the workplace, unions have at times {{played a role in}} determining solutions to environmental issues, from health and safety standards all the way to national and international policy and solidarity activity, though this subject is rarely studied or analyzed. In particular, trade union stances and action on climate and energy issues represents an under-researched, yet important topic of analysis. Using the United States and Sweden as case studies, with analysis of two <b>blue-collar</b> <b>unions</b> in each, the research analyzes the important factors affecting choices and action regarding climate and energy matters. Within the case study approach, using a neo-institutional theoretical approach, I employed qualitative methods including semi-structured interviews, complemented with primary source documentary analysis. The analysis demonstrates that two unions (one in each country) can be described as active and two as defensive on environmental issues, respectively. The United Steelworkers in the United States and Kommunal in Sweden, both affected and acting within a particular structure, have been active at combating and seeking solutions to climate change, while linking work and environmental issues at multiple levels. Key factors such as working within a social unionism paradigm; instrumental leadership combined with multilevel work; and important mergers converge to influence and define behaviour. The United Autoworkers (U. S.) and IF Metall (Sweden), both defensive, though in their own ways, are influenced by factors including historical institutional power; regional concentration of employment; and the types of employment they represent...|$|R

30|$|The {{effectiveness}} of trend-setting arrangements {{depends on whether}} the negotiators of the pattern setting agreement are {{able and willing to}} ‘internalize’ the pressures of international competitiveness and changing labour markets. This might be the case if the internationally exposed sector takes the lead. The stability of pattern setting, including wage moderation if need be, depends on a degree of centralisation and authority that is perhaps less than central wage bargaining but still formidable. This is nowhere clearer than in Austria where both the union and employers’ side hold an absolute monopoly of representation, backed by the law, and can therefore not be challenged from without. In Germany it is the sheer might of the IG Metall in combination with the size, success and prestige of the car industry. In Norway and Denmark it is possible to end disputes over the renewal of agreements by means of a single mediation procedure for the entire private sector, empowering the mediator to treat several settlements as one entity in the ballot (Elvander 2003). This is a strong centralising element in an otherwise decentralised system of wage setting like the Danish one and a method to gag independent unions and out-of-step employers, for instance in the Norwegian oil industry. Mediation institutions were set up in all four Nordic countries in the early 20 th century (Elvander 1990), but these institutions have been weaker in Sweden, where a strong doctrine of freedom from state interference in these matters had prevailed (Elvander 2002 : 210). This was addressed in the 1997 Industry Agreement between the industrial engineering employers and a cartel of ten unions. The agreement established a private-law mediation institute, a permanent joint structure with impartial chairpersons for negotiations and a sectoral Economic Council with four independent academic economists. Elvander and Holmlund (1997) judge these institutions as prerequisite for decentralized wage formation in a highly organized economy with powerful unions. In 2009 the employers in industrial engineering Employers Federation gave notice to the 1997 agreement, but it was renewed in 2011 with more power for impartial mediators, stricter negotiation rules and stronger incentives to maintain the manufacturing industry’s wage leadership role. This came after a challenge during the recession, when some unions pushed hard for the norm to be set by the commercial services sector rather than by a manufacturing sector which was experiencing tremendous difficulties in exports and sales, and was rapidly losing jobs (Kjellberg 2012). In the 2011 bargaining rounds, following some recovery, the industry sector prevailed however, though with the salaried employees rather than the <b>blue-collar</b> <b>unions,</b> settling first and thus establish the pattern.|$|R

40|$|This article {{describes}} and explains {{the movement of}} female relative wages in Sweden from 1920 to 1995. During this period the aggregate gender wage gap shrunk from 41 to 15 %. The bulk of the change took place in two periods: 1920 to 1940 and 1960 to 1980. With regard to determining factors, the analysis distinguishes between the period before 1960, when {{the rise in the}} female relative wage was the result of employment shafts, and after 1960, when wage structure change was the prime determinant. In the interwar period, women moved from low-paid to better-paid jobs, notably in trade and commerce and public services, as legal and administrative reforms opened up the public sector to women and educational reforms raised the educational level of the female labor force. The most rapid change in the gender wage gap occurred {{at a time when the}} solidaristic wage policy doctrine was embraced by the <b>blue-collar</b> trade <b>unions</b> and formed the basis of claims in wage negotiations. This study suggests, however, that excess demand for female labor rather than egalitarian ambitions of strong trade unions was the decisive factor behind the rapid reduction of the gender gap. Likewise, supply and demand shifts may well explain why the female relative wage stagnated from the late 1970 s. These observations add up to the somewhat unorthodox conclusion that institutions were Of primary importance for female relative wage development in the interwar period, while market forces played the leading role after 1960...|$|R

40|$|Master of EducationVictorian teachers' {{unions have}} a {{continuous}} history going; {{back to the}} 1880 s although their influence prior to the Second World War was erratic. Teachers tended to be divided amongst themselves with the primary teachers dominating their post-primary colleagues. The 1946 - 1975 period saw dramatic changes in teacher. unionism and a growth {{in the field of}} white-collar unionism'. To start with Victorian state school teachers were unified within a confident V. T. U., which in 1945 had helped to. defeat the State Government and had subsequently seen, the establishment of the Teachers' Tribunal, but disunity. followed. The period became dominated: by the relationship between primary and post-primary teachers and the ensuing conflict led to the fragmentation of the V. T. U. and the establishment of separate unions for secondary and technical teachers v the V. S. T. A. and the T. T. A. V. The conflict was aggravated by the expansion in post-primary education and the fact that schools were ill-prepared' to cope with it. Thus the growing numbers of secondary and technical teachers became disillusioned with the conservatism of the V. T. U. and supported the establishment of new unions which catered specifically for their needs. These events led to a reassessment of the nature of teachers' unions and their methods of exerting influence. The V. S. T. A. and', to a lesser extent, the T. T. A. V., applied industrial tactics more commonly used by <b>blue-collar</b> <b>unions</b> in their attempts to initiate changes and. to make teaching a profession. The successes included abolition of some outmoded practices, control of entry to teaching, abolition of inspection, the development of a conditions policy and changes to the Teachers' Tribunal. Towards the end of the period in question a combination of internal and external factors-saw the V. T. U. lose some of its conservative image: and move closer to the other two unions, making a future federation of all state school teachers' unions a possibility. The three unions that evolved adopted a democratic structure, with large membership involvement and with policies decided by annual conferences and then implemented by all other levels - from council and executive down to, individual school branches. All three unions saw their function as developing industrial,, educational, pressure group, and social and "Friendly Society" policies and tactics. Teachers' unions continued to share many of the preoccupations and features of the white-collar movement. There was an uncertainty as to whether they should have allied themselves with the professions or with the blue collar unions. The uncertainty affected their methods of campaigning and their relationship with other bodies.

The direction of the unions was influenced by two further factors: a change in the passive/conservative role of the dominant women members, and the difficulty of communicating policies. to the: public through the media [...] Finally, there was more awareness; of the need of teachers to act in unity in the face of common problems, to develop links with other. employee organizations, and to look at new methods of strengthening their unions and planning for the future.

50|$|Meidner {{and another}} Swedish economist, Gösta Rehn, were {{responsible}} for the Rehn-Meidner model for economic growth as promulgated by the Swedish Social Democratic Party and the <b>blue-collar</b> trade <b>union,</b> the LO. The Rehn-Meidner model was first proposed in 1951, and for over the next 25 years was the basis for the low-inequality, high-tech oriented, rapid-innovation Swedish economy, which also was exposed to international trade and became export oriented. In response to the increasing demand on the part of workers, communities, and women for a share of the excess profits (permitted by a capital-labor-state wage suppression agreement) accumulated in an increasingly powerful capitalist sector, Rudulf Meidner created a proposal in 1976, published by the LO, that called for requiring all companies above a certain size to issue new stock shares to workers, so that within 20 years the workers would control 52% of the companies they worked in. This policy followed in Meidner's career-long efforts to build a step-wise, peaceful, institutionally supported transition to a socialist society whose carefully crafted incentive structure and culture would allow each member of society to work and contribute according to her or his capacity, and receive social support according to her or his needs. Supported by important Swedish policy designer Walter Korpi, Meidner's work was opposed by pro-capitalist Social Democrats, including the aggressively conservative Finance Minister Kjell-Olof Feldt, as well as Gosta Rehn (proponent of Active labour market policies) and Olof Palme. The increasing ambitions and occasional militancy of the Swedish working class in conjunction with Meidner's careful, progressive socialist institutional planning politicized the Swedish capitalist class, via the Swedish Employers Association (SAF), who joined other countries' capitalist classes ramping up their political efforts to destroy working class organizational bases and to promote the capital deregulation and mobility that began to come to obvious crisis in the 2000s. The SAF's response was to model their political and policy strategies after the New Zealand capitalist class' campaign, which had successfully destroyed a labor movement of similar strength to the Swedish labor movement.|$|R
