40|$|The <b>block</b> <b>shear</b> {{strength}} of Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) glulam joints was tested under low temperature. Glulam samples were glued {{with the three}} of the most common outdoor structural adhesives. The cold temperatures tested were 20, − 20, − 30, − 40, - 50 and − 60 °C. Within the temperature test range, the <b>block</b> <b>shear</b> {{strength of}} the glulam joints was resistant to the effect of temperature. As the temperature decreased, the joints’ <b>block</b> <b>shear</b> strength did not show any significant change. In most cases, phenol-resorcinol-formaldehyde (PRF) adhesive yielded the strongest <b>block</b> <b>shear</b> strength, while melamine-formaldehyde (MF) adhesive yielded the weakest <b>block</b> <b>shear</b> strength. Melamine-urea-formaldehyde (MUF) adhesive yielded similar results to those of MF adhesives for all temperatures tested. The <b>block</b> <b>shear</b> strengths of the glulam joints with PRF, MUF and MF adhesives were not sensitive to temperature change. The results indicated that PRF, MUF and MF adhesives are stable for outdoor structural engineered wood construction in cold climate. The results also suggest that the SS-EN 14080 (2013) standard for the <b>block</b> <b>shear</b> method may not be the proper standard for testing differences in shear strength at different temperatures. The EN 302 - 1 (2011) standard could be more suitable for this purpose...|$|E

40|$|In the AISI Specification for the Design of Cold-formed Steel Structural Members 2007, {{there are}} two types of shear planes used to {{determine}} the resistance of a bolted connection to <b>block</b> <b>shear</b> failure.

Conversely, when the <b>block</b> <b>shear</b> failure is deemed to occur by simultaneous shear and tensile ruptures, the shear failure plane is assumed to be the net shear plane. Such an approach is not logical since the shear failure planes should be unique irrespective of the <b>block</b> <b>shear</b> failure mechanism. Through finite element analysis presented in this paper, the shear failure plane is shown to be neither the gross nor the net shear plane, and to be midway between the two shear planes assumed in design specifications.

40|$|Stability {{analysis}} of rock masses composed of small, discrete rock blocks that are in-place and interlocked should consider four components of failure: (1) Sliding between <b>blocks.</b> (2) <b>Shearing</b> through rock <b>blocks.</b> (3) Rolling <b>blocks</b> in a <b>shear</b> zone. (4) Crushing of rock blocks. Statistical rock mass description {{is used to}} define {{the characteristics of the}} rock blocks and the block assemblage. Clastic mechanics is one method of predicting stresses produced by the arrangement of rock blocks and the loading conditions. Failure begins at a point of maximum stress behind the slope. Progression of the failure is assumed if the first block fails because adjacent blocks will become overstressed. The location of the point of maximum stress is determined from the shape and arrangement of the constituent rock blocks. Because strength is mobilized block-by-block rather than instantaneously along a continuous shear surface, sliding between blocks shows less stability than a soil rotational shear analysis or a rigid <b>block</b> sliding analysis. <b>Shearing</b> through rock <b>blocks</b> occurs when maximum shear stress exceeds rock shear strength. Crushing of rock blocks is predicted if the normal stress exceeds the compressive strength of the rock block. A size-strength relationship is combined with the rock block size distribution curve to estimate crushing strength. Rotating <b>blocks</b> in a <b>shear</b> zone have been observed in model studies and as a mechanism in landslides. Stability analysis assumes that the rock mass is sufficiently loosened by blasting and excavation to allow blocks to rotate. The shear strength of rolling <b>blocks</b> is dynamic <b>shear</b> strength that is less than static sliding shear strength. This rolling mechanism can explain release of slope failures where there are no other obvious structural controls. Stability of each component of rock mass failure is calculated separately using capacity-demand reliability. These results are combined as a series-connected system to give the overall stability of the rock mass. This probability of failure for the rock mass system explicitly accounts for the four components of rock mass failure. Criteria for recognizing rock mass failure potential and examples applying the proposed method are presented...|$|R

40|$|<b>Block</b> <b>shear</b> {{is one of}} {{the major}} failure modes for coped steel I-beams. While focus of {{previous}} studies on the <b>block</b> <b>shear</b> capacity of coped steel I-beam was mainly given to the connections with double clip angles, single-sided connections, which induce out-of-plane loading eccentricity, have not been adequately considered. Ten full-scale coped steel I-beam tests were conducted to examine the effects of two main test parameters, namely, out-of-plane loading eccentricity and web block aspect ratio (ratio of shear area to tension area). It was found that nine test specimens failed with tension fracture along the bottom bolt row of the web, and the remaining one failed in a whole block tear-out manner. Twisting of the web near the cope was observed for specimens with single-sided connection. More importantly, the test results showed that the out-of-plane loading eccentricity due to the single-sided connection did not have a detrimental effect on the <b>block</b> <b>shear</b> capacity of the specimens. Moreover, increasing the connection rotational stiffness could increase the <b>block</b> <b>shear</b> capacity.

40|$|The {{ends of a}} coped beam are {{commonly}} connected to the web of a girder by double clip angles. The clip angles may either be bolted or welded to the web of the beam.

To investigate the strength and the behavior of the <b>block</b> <b>shear</b> of coped beams with welded end connections, ten full-scale coped beam tests were conducted. The test parameters included the aspect ratio of the clip angles, the web shear and tension area around the clip angles, the web thickness, beam section depth, cope length, and connection position. The test results indicated that the specimens failed, developing either tension fractures of the web {{near the bottom of the}} clip angles or local web buckling near the end of the cope.

The finite-element (FE) method was employed to predict the structural behavior and <b>block</b> <b>shear</b> capacity of specimens tested during a previous experimental {{study conducted by the}} writers. In general, the finite-element analysis results compared well with the test results, and the validated finite-element models were used subsequently to further investigate the structural behavior of the connections through a parametric study. The results show that the <b>block</b> <b>shear</b> capacity of coped beams with welded end connections, in general, increases with increasing connection rotational stiffness and increasing web block aspect ratio (depth/width). It was found that, for design purposes, connections with a large web block aspect ratio (large depth and narrow width) should be used to reduce the effects of loading eccentricity between the centroid of the weld group of the connection and the support. The finite-element analysis results also show that, for the coped beams with small connection rotational stiffness, shear yielding only occurs over {{a small portion of the}} shear area. Based on the test and the finite-element analysis results, a design equation previously proposed by the first writer for evaluating the <b>block</b> <b>shear</b> capacity of a coped beam with a welded clip angle connection was modified to account for the effects of the connection rotational stiffness.

Previous research study demonstrated that vertical loading arrangement greatly influences the interface <b>shear</b> capacity of <b>block</b> systems and fixed vertical actuator with flexible airbag shows better loading arrangement for the blocks which have dilatant behavior. However, airbag arrangement is strenuous and time-consuming loading assembly compared to fixed vertical actuator which increases normal load with shear displacement due to bending of vertical actuator locked with the top <b>block</b> during <b>shear</b> loading. For the drawbacks of fixed vertical loading arrangement, the apparatus used in this study was fully redesigned and modified in terms of normal loading arrangement specially. A moveable vertical loading assembly is used in the modified apparatus which allows the piston movement with the top <b>blocks</b> during <b>shear</b> testing. The results outlined in this paper report that normal load remains constant over the period of shear testing {{for a wide range of}} surcharge loading. It could easily be concluded that the modified apparatus might be a better alternative to the existing apparatus used in the test protocols. ...|$|R
40|$|Closely jointed {{greywacke}} rock masses are widespread throughout {{both the}} North and South Islands of New Zealand {{and much of}} New Zealand's infrastructure is constructed upon greywacke rock masses. This thesis deals with determining the rock mass strength of unweathered closely jointed New Zealand greywacke rock masses. Currently, the estimation of rock mass strength and deformability is reasonably well predicted {{through the use of}} such empirical failure criteria as the Hoek-Brown failure criterion and empirical expressions to predict deformability. However, previous studies upon predicting the strength and deformability of unweathered closely jointed New Zealand greywacke rock masses has shown that existing empirical methods of determining strength and deformability are unsatisfactory. The problem with predicting rock mass strength and deformability moduli of New Zealand greywacke and the lack of adequate data to calibrate a failure criterion was the starting point for this work. The objective of this thesis was to increase the knowledge of intact and defect properties of closely jointed greywacke, develop reliable rock mass data with which to calibrate a failure criterion and improve the ability to estimate the rock mass strength of greywacke rock masses. A review of existing failure criteria for rock masses was conducted and of these criteria, the Hoek-Brown rock mass failure criteria was selected to calibrate to both the intact rock and rock mass failure data, because of its broad acceptance in the rock mechanics community. A database of greywacke properties was developed based on previous studies upon unweathered greywacke around New Zealand and is attached to the thesis as an Appendix. The database included descriptions of greywacke defect properties and mechanical properties of the intact rock and joints. From this database, inputs could be justified for numerical modelling and later analyses of failure criteria. Records from the construction archives of the Benmore and Aviemore hydroelectric power projects in the South Island of New Zealand were reviewed to obtain information and results from a series of shear tests carried out on unweathered closely jointed greywacke in the 1960 s. Data on rock mass strength at failure and rock mass deformability were extracted from these records to assess the predictability of the failure criterion and deformability expressions. Problems experienced during the shear tests at the Aviemore dam site created doubt as to the actual rock mass strengths achieved at failure. The behaviour of these tests was studied using the finite difference code FLAC. The work was aimed at investigating the potential for transfer of shear force between the two concrete <b>blocks</b> <b>sheared</b> in each test and the impact shear force transfer had upon the likely normal stresses beneath each block at failure. The numerical modelling results indicated that a combination of preferential failure occurring in one direction, and doubt in the actual normal load applied to the concrete blocks during testing lead to premature failure in the <b>blocks</b> <b>sheared</b> upstream. The <b>blocks</b> <b>sheared</b> in the opposite direction failed at normal stresses that are reflective of the strength of an unweathered greywacke rock mass, but these results could be explained by failure occurring along defects therefore not satisfying the assumptions of homogeneity typically required of a rock mass failure criterion. The Hoek-Brown failure criterion for intact rock was investigated by fitting it to the largest intact greywacke datasets. For a full set of test data (i. e. including tensile data), the Mostyn & Douglas (2000) variant of the Hoek-Brown failure criterion gave the best fit for a full set of rock mass data. A multiple regression method was developed which improved the fitted curve to intact data in the tensile region and gave the best estimate of tensile strength if no existing lab results for tensile strength were available. These results suggest that the Hoek-Brown failure criterion is significantly limited in its applicability to intact NZ greywacke rock. Hoek-Brown input parameters different to those suggested by Hoek et al (2002) are recommended for using the Hoek-Brown failure criterion for intact NZ greywacke. For closely jointed NZ greywacke rock masses, the results from the shear tests at Aviemore and Benmore were separated into different GSI classes and Hoek-Brown envelopes fitted to the datasets by multiple regression. Revised expressions were proposed for each Hoek-Brown input parameter (mb, s, ab) {{as a function of the}} GSI. The resulting revised Hoek-Brown failure envelopes for NZ greywacke offer a significant improvement on the existing criterion used to predict the strength of NZ greywacke intact rock and rock masses. The differences in the behaviour of the reaction blocks that failed before the test blocks and the reduction in rock strength due to sliding along defects from that predicted could be reasoned from recorded observations and the behaviour of the concrete <b>blocks</b> during the <b>shear</b> tests. This study has clearly illustrated the need for continued research in this area. This includes (1) a means of assessing the role of defects upon the shear strength of closely jointed greywacke rock mass into a failure criterion, (2) further modelling of the in-situ shear tests by a discrete element procedure to expressly determine the role of the defect on failure, (3) more testing on rock masses to obtain more data to calibrate a rock mass failure criterion, and (4) more studies on predicting the strength of extremely disturbed rock masses...|$|R
40|$|As part of {{a project}} to {{automate}} coal extraction, computer control of a continuous mining machine test bed has been developed and tested by the Bureau of Mines. A computer system and control software were developed for accurate positioning of the conveyor elevation and swing, stabilizer jack, gathering head, and shear elevation. Tramming actions are also controlled by the computer. The computer system was designed to access data from sensors installed on a continuous miner and to interface with the existing control circuits of the miner. Testing in free space was used to characterize {{the operation of the}} machine. From this information, control algorithms were written and stored in the computer. The ability to control each function of the continuous miner {{with a high degree of}} accuracy and stability was successfully demonstrated in a series of tests in free space and in mining a block of simulated coal. In the mining of simulated coal, the cutting drum was instructed to position the shearer at the top of the <b>block</b> and <b>shear</b> down to the bottom under closed loop control. The cutting drum came within 0. 27 in of the top and within 0. 49 in of the bottom of the <b>block</b> for this <b>shearing</b> test...|$|R
