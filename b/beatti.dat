Catholic capitalists have been disturbed {{by some of}} the left-leaning themes and the call for a stronger world political authority. Writing for the Irish Times, Dr. Tina <b>Beatti</b> praised the encyclical for its insightful comments on the economic crises. But she went on to suggest the Catholic idealisation of sexuality hinted at in the encyclical may be part of the cause of child abuse scandals that have recently rocked Ireland. Dr. <b>Beatti</b> points out that the Church's high ideals [...] "fail to distinguish between the good, the not so good and the downright bad, so that everything short of perfection stands equally condemned". She also deplores the encyclical's [...] "apparent indifference to the suffering of sexual bodies..... it makes no mention of HIV/AIDS and it is silent on questions of maternal mortality and women's reproductive health, despite the fact that an estimated 536,000 women die every year from causes relating to pregnancy and childbirth, 99 per cent of them in developing countries. These are startling omissions".|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} new {{approach}} for directly organizing single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) onto silicon surface. The ordered assembly of SWCNTs {{was made by the}} surface condensation reaction with hydroxyl terminated silicon. X-ray photoelectron spectra, Raman spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy show that the shortened SWCNTs have been organized successfully on silicon. The electrochemistry of SWCNT array exhibits good electrochemical reversibility and enhanced conductivity. Jingxian Yu, Joe Shapter, Jamie Quinton, Martin Johnston, and David <b>Beatti...</b>|$|E

Therefore, the multiple osteomas, which {{we were in a}} position to study in an adult female of the lizard Lacerta viridis, is probably the first case of this tumour found in a reptile.

40|$|A new {{approach}} for the attachment of vertically-aligned shortened carbon nanotube architectures to a silicon (100) substrate by chemical anchoring {{directly to the}} surface has been demonstrated for the first time. The ordered assembly of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) was accomplished by hydroxylating the silicon surface followed by a condensation reaction with carboxylic acid functionalised SWCNTs. This new nanostructure has been characterised by X-ray photoelectron, Raman and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy as well as scanning electron and atomic force microscopy. The assembly behaviour of SWCNTs onto the silicon surface shows a fast initial step producing isolated functionalised carbon nanotubes or nanotube bundles anchored to the silicon surface followed by a slower step where the adsorbed nanotubes grow into larger aggregates via van der Waals interactions between adsorbed and solvated nanotubes. The electrochemical and optical properties of the SWCNTs directly attached to silicon have also been investigated. These new nanostructures are excellent electrochemical electrodes. They also fluoresce in the wavelength range 650 - 800 nm. The successful attachment of the SWCNTs directly to silicon provides a simple, new avenue for fabrication and development of silicon-based nanoelectronic, nano-optoelectronic and sensing devices. Compared to existing techniques, this {{new approach}} has several advantages including low operating temperature, low cost {{and the possibility of}} further modification. Jingxian Yu, Joseph G.

40|$|The {{adsorption}} of carboxymethylcellulose (CMC), and {{the subsequent}} effect on bubble-surface interactions, has been studied for a graphite surface. CMC adsorbs on highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) in specific patterns: when adsorbed from a solution of low concentration it forms stretched, isolated and sparsely distributed chains, while upon adsorption from a solution of higher concentration, it forms an interconnected network of multilayer features. The amount and topography of the adsorbed CMC affect the electrical properties {{as well as the}} wettability of the polymer-modified HOPG surface. Adsorption of CMC onto the HOPG surface causes the zeta potential to be more negative and the modified surface becomes more hydrophilic. This increase in both the absolute value of zeta potential and the surface hydrophilicity originates from the carboxymethyl groups of the CMC polymer. The effect of the adsorbed polymer layer on wetting film drainage and bubble-surface/particle attachment was determined using high speed video microscopy to monitor single bubble-surface collision, and single bubble Hallimond tube flotation experiments. The time of wetting film drainage and the time of three-phase contact line spreading gets significantly longer for polymer-modified HOPG surfaces, indicating that the film rupture and three-phase contact line expansion were inhibited by the presence of polymer. The effect of longer drainage times and slower dewetting correlated with reduced flotation recovery. The molecular kinetic (MK) model was used to quantify the effect of the polymer on dewetting dynamics, and showed an increase in the jump frequency for the polymer adsorbed at the higher concentration.

40|$|Published: September 18, 2014 The {{adsorption}} of carboxymethylcellulose polymers on molybdenite was studied using spectroscopic ellipsometry and {{atomic force microscopy}} imaging {{with two}} polymers of differing degrees of carboxyl group substitution and at three different electrolyte conditions: 1 × 10 (- 2) M KCl, 2. 76 × 10 (- 2) M KCl, and simulated flotation process water of multicomponent electrolyte content, with an ionic strength close to 2. 76 × 10 (- 2) M. A higher degree of carboxyl substitution in the adsorbing polymer resulted in adsorbed layers that were thinner and with more patchy coverage; increasing the ionic strength of the electrolyte resulted in increased polymer layer thickness and coverage. The use of simulated process water resulted in the largest layer thickness and coverage for both polymers. The effect of the adsorbed polymer layer on bubble-particle attachment was studied with single bubble-surface collision experiments recorded with high-speed video capture and image processing and also with single mineral molybdenite flotation tests. The carboxymethylcellulose polymer with a lower degree of substitution resulted in almost complete prevention of wetting film rupture at the molybdenite surface under all electrolyte conditions. The polymer with {{a higher degree of}} substitution prevented rupture only when adsorbed from simulated process water. Molecular kinetic theory was used to quantify the effect of the polymer on the dewetting dynamics for collisions that resulted in wetting film rupture. Flotation experiments confirmed that adsorbed polymer layer properties, through their effect on the dynamics of bubble-particle attachment, are critical to predicting the effectiveness of polymers used to prevent mineral recovery in flotation.
