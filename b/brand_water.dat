5000|$|Prior to the launch, {{an article}} in The Grocer trade {{magazine}} had mentioned {{that the source of}} the Dasani <b>brand</b> <b>water</b> was in fact treated tap water from Sidcup, a suburban town on the outskirts of Greater London. By early March 2004, the mainstream press had picked up the story and it became widely reported that Sidcup tap water, after being processed by reverse osmosis, had been remineralized, bottled and sold under the Dasani brand name in the UK. Although Coca-Cola never implied that the water was being sourced from a spring or other natural source, they marketed it as being especially [...] "pure". This led the Food Standards Agency to request Hillingdon trading standards officers to launch an investigation into whether the claim was accurate.|$|E

5000|$|The Great Flood of 1862 largely {{destroyed}} the earlier settlement of Agua Mansa, {{settled in the}} 1830s by New Mexicans in present-day Colton. The Catholic Church there was rebuilt in downtown San Bernardino in 1865. That wooden church burnt down in 1878 and another was built. The present church, {{at the corner of}} Fifth Street and [...] "F" [...] was built in 1910. The flood caused severe damage along the Santa Ana River's tributaries, particularly Lytle Creek. Topsoil was washed away.In 1864, [...] "Dr." [...] David Noble Smith established a [...] "treatment house" [...] at the Arrowhead hot springs. By 1868, it had been enlarged to create a hotel. In 1885, he leased the property to Darby and Lyman of Los Angeles. Three days after Smith's death on March 17, 1885, the hotel burnt down. Darby and Lyman incorporated the Arrowhead Hot Springs Company, and rebuilt a new hotel in 1886 for $150,000. After it was expanded to 120 rooms it was the largest hotel in the San Bernardino area until it, too, burnt down on July 4, 1895. The third hotel was built by Seth Marshall in 1905. In 1930, it was purchased by a consortium of Hollywood types. In the days before air travel, it was marketed to Hollywood stars like Loretta Young, Mary Pickford, Spencer Tracy, and Humphrey Bogart. A forest fire {{destroyed the}} third hotel in November 1938. The present structure (the fourth hotel) opened in December 1939 at a cost of $1.5 million. This time, the hotel was six stories, and the grand opening featured Judy Garland, Al Jolson, and Rudy Vallee. However, World War II caused the hotel to be taken over as naval hospital in 1944. After the war, Elizabeth Taylor spent her honeymoon with Conrad Hilton on the sixth floor. The hotel was purchased by Campus Crusade for Christ in 1962. It was used as world headquarters until 1991. It was operated as a Christian Conference Center in 1999. The City of San Bernardino is trying to annex the property into the City as part of a private development and redevelopment of Arrowhead Springs. In 1894, Arrowhead Brand Mountain Spring Water began to be pumped from near the site, as it is today.

40|$|The thesis {{attempts}} {{to answer the}} question which is commonly asked by retailers and manufacturers - what's the best way to deliver a product to the store? Specifically the thesis tries to understand and evaluate the impact on transportation and safety stock when a manufacturer transitions from a 100 % DC delivery method to 100 % Direct-To-Store (DTS) method. Drawing on the results of a case study on Niagara bottling, a leading private <b>brand</b> <b>water</b> bottle manufacturer in US, the thesis recommends strategies to minimize the cost impacts on safety stock and transportation. We developed the inventory and transportation models using one key product and two customers. Using sensitivity analysis and simulation technique, we tried to find the behavior of the transportation costs and safety stock at incremental phases during 100 % DC to 100 % DTS transition. The findings showed that transportation costs increase by 40 % or more and dominate the cost structure as compared to safety stock cost changes. Secondly, we found that increasing order sizes or combining two customers on the route can lower the transportation costs by 4 %. From an inventory standpoint, a shorter lead time reduced the safety stock in the total supply chain by as much as 26 %. Since a shorter lead time increases the manufacturer's safety stock, he needs to develop a benefit-sharing contract with the retailer so as to create a winwin situation for both. Beyond a certain point (typically below lead time of 3 days), the transportation costs can rise and offset any safety stock savings. Finally, we observed that a collaborative forecasting process will benefit the supply chain in reducing safety stock by as much as 72 %. Amit Panditrao by and Kishore Adiraju. Thesis: M.

40|$|A survey {{has been}} done and a {{detailed}} account has been given of the sources {{and quality of the}} drinking and household water in Al Qurayyat City, Al Jouf Region, northern KSA. Seven local drinking and six household <b>water</b> <b>brands</b> were collected and subjected to bacteriological and chemical analysis at the laboratory of Al Qurayyat Water Treatment Plant. Each drinking <b>water</b> <b>brand</b> exhibited a characteristic taste depending on its chemical composition. There was a marked variability of the total dissolved solids (TDS), electrical conductivity (EC), total hardness and mineral nutrients among the studied <b>water</b> <b>brands.</b> A household <b>water</b> <b>brand</b> was invalid and showed high levels of TDS, EC, calcium and magnesium. Similarly, a local drinking <b>water</b> <b>brand</b> was invalid and recorded high levels of TDS, EC, calcium and magnesium. The vast majority of the drinking <b>water</b> <b>brands</b> adopted the standards of SASO, GCS and WHO. Hydrogen ion concentration (pH) of the drinking and household <b>water</b> <b>brands</b> was slightly alkaline. The health concerns related to the drinking and household water and the contribution of the beneficial nutrients found in the drinking water to human activities, their daily requirements, permissible concentrations and health impacts are discussed in detail. The authority of the Water and Electricity in Al Qurayyat should conduct an intensive monitoring of the drinking water facilities and implement a comprehensive education program to control over the quality and safety of the drinking water and to raise the awareness about the health concerns of the poor household and drinking <b>water</b> <b>brands...</b>|$|R
