5|$|Although it had {{abandoned}} the cause of Poniatowski's reforms, the Familia did not receive the support it expected from the Russians, who continued to press for the dissidents' rights. Meanwhile, some factions now rallied {{under the banner of}} the <b>Bar</b> Confederation, aimed against the dissidents, Poniatowski and the Russians. After an unsuccessful attempt to find allies in Western Europe (France, England and Austria), Poniatowski and the Familia {{had no choice but to}} rely more heavily on the Russian Empire, which treated Poland as a protectorate. In the War of the <b>Bar</b> Confederation (1768–1772), Poniatowski supported the Russian army's repression of the <b>Bar</b> Confederation. In 1770, the Council of the <b>Bar</b> Confederation proclaimed him dethroned. The following year, he was kidnapped by <b>Bar</b> Confederate sympathizers and briefly held prisoner outside of Warsaw, but managed to escape. Faced with the weakness of Poland and continuing chaos, Austria, Russia and Prussia decided to intervene militarily, in exchange for significant territorial concessions from the Commonwealth – a decision they made without consulting Poniatowski or other Polish parties.|$|E

40|$|In Korea, smoke-free {{regulations}} have been gradually implemented in <b>bars</b> based on venue size. Smoking bans were implemented in 2013 for <b>bars</b> ≥ 150 m 2, in 2014 for <b>bars</b> ≥ 100 m 2, and in 2015 for <b>bars</b> of all sizes. The {{purpose of this}} study was to determine indoor fine particle (PM 2. 5) concentrations in <b>bars</b> before and after implementation of the smoke-free policies based on venue size. Indoor PM 2. 5 concentrations were measured with real-time aerosol monitors at four time points: (1) pre-regulation (n = 75); (2) after implementing the ban in <b>bars</b> ≥ 150 m 2 (n = 75); (3) after implementing the ban in <b>bars</b> ≥ 100 m 2 (n = 107); and (4) when all <b>bars</b> were smoke-free (n = 79). Our results showed that the geometric mean of the indoor PM 2. 5 concentrations of all <b>bars</b> decreased from 98. 4 μg/m 3 pre-regulation to 79. 5, 42. 9, and 26. 6 μg/m 3 after the ban on smoking in <b>bars</b> ≥ 150 m 2, ≥ 100 m 2, and all <b>bars,</b> respectively. Indoor PM 2. 5 concentrations in <b>bars</b> of each size decreased only after the corresponding regulations were implemented. Although smoking was not observed in Seoul <b>bars</b> after smoking was banned in all <b>bars,</b> smoking was observed in 4 of 21 <b>bars</b> in Changwon. Our study concludes that the greatest decrease in PM 2. 5 concentrations in <b>bars</b> was observed after the regulation covering all <b>bars</b> was implemented. However, despite the comprehensive ban, smoking was observed in <b>bars</b> in Changwon. Strict compliance with the regulations is needed to improve indoor air quality further...|$|R
