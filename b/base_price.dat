50|$|Market <b>based</b> <b>pricing</b> gives {{companies}} a {{means to}} align themselves to the market at large and gives companies price thresholds to be working in. In highly competitive markets, market <b>based</b> <b>pricing</b> becomes almost essential. Additionally, OEMs segregate their competitive parts from their captive ones and apply market <b>based</b> <b>pricing</b> only on the competitive parts. There may also be instances where companies take a strategic decision to lose money on the competitive parts and cover up on their captive and critical parts. This is usually done to retain market share and customer share of mind.|$|R

5|$|At its U.S. debut, the {{redesigned}} LS 400 {{retained a}} pricing advantage over European competitors in its largest market, launching with a <b>base</b> <b>price</b> of US$51,000. However, cost differences had narrowed following more aggressive pricing and added feature content from rival manufacturers. To promote their new flagship, Lexus launched a US$50 million advertising campaign, {{the most expensive}} marketing effort since {{the launch of the}} division. In mid-1995, sales slowed as the U.S. government threatened tariffs on Japanese luxury cars over the widening U.S.-Japan trade deficit, potentially raising the price of a fully optioned LS 400 to over US$100,000. Subsequent negotiations averted the sanctions by the second quarter of that year, and sales recovered in the following months. Ultimately, second-generation LS 400 sales were not as voluminous as the original model; production totaled approximately 114,000 units.|$|E
5|$|In 1990, {{during its}} first full year of sales, Lexus sold 63,594 LS 400 and ES 250 sedans in the U.S., the {{majority}} being the LS model. That year, Lexus also began limited exports to the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Canada and Australia. In 1991, Lexus launched its first sports coupe, the SC 400, which shared the LS 400’s V8 engine and rear-wheel drive design. This {{was followed by the}} second generation ES 300 sedan, which succeeded the ES 250 and became Lexus' top seller. At the conclusion of 1991, Lexus had become the top-selling premium car import in the U.S., with sales reaching 71,206 vehicles. That year, Lexus ranked highest in J.D. Power and Associates' studies on initial vehicle quality, customer satisfaction and sales satisfaction for the first time. The marque also began increasing U.S. model prices past those of comparable American premium makes, but still below high-end European models. By 1992, the LS 400's <b>base</b> <b>price</b> had risen 18 percent.|$|E

50|$|Cost <b>based</b> <b>pricing,</b> however, {{suffers from}} some {{fundamental}} flaws. Firstly, costs are not fixed but fluctuate with raw material prices, purchased volumes, supplier contracts etc. Pure cost <b>based</b> <b>pricing</b> thus causes fluctuating prices which {{can result in}} customer confusion, dissatisfaction and demand fluctuations. Although, service parts are less price elastic than their manufacturing counterparts, continued reliance on cost <b>based</b> <b>pricing</b> can ultimately make customers sensitive to price fluctuations - if not to the actual prices then to the frequency of price changes. This can cause demand to start being affected by the frequent price changes, and can even push the company into a death spiral. Secondly, cost <b>based</b> <b>pricing</b> does not take competition into account and may result in severe under or over pricing of service parts relative to the market. This may also result in under pricing of strong products and over pricing of weak ones.|$|R
5|$|The Comet 4 first flew on 27 April 1958 and {{received}} its Certificate of Airworthiness on 24 September 1958; {{the first was}} delivered to BOAC the next day. The <b>base</b> <b>price</b> of a new Comet 4 was around £1,140,000, equivalent to £ in today's pounds. The Comet 4 enabled BOAC to inaugurate the first regular jet-powered transatlantic services on 4 October 1958 between London and New York (albeit still requiring a fuel stop at Gander International Airport, Newfoundland, on westward North Atlantic crossings). While BOAC gained publicity as the first to provide transatlantic jet service, {{by the end of}} the month rival Pan American World Airways was flying the Boeing 707 on the same route, and in 1960 the Douglas DC-8 as well. The American jets were larger, faster, longer-ranged, and more cost-effective than the Comet. After analysing route structures for the Comet, BOAC reluctantly cast about for a successor, and in 1956 entered into an agreement with Boeing to purchase the 707.|$|E
5|$|The LS 430 {{first went}} on sale in the U.S. with an initial <b>base</b> <b>price</b> of US$55,000, ranging up to US$70,000 when fully equipped. At the high end, the LS 430's pricing encroached on European rivals as Lexus became {{increasingly}} able to command higher price premiums for its vehicles. Sales for the LS 430 surpassed the previous generation, and production exceeded 140,000 units. The LS 430 was produced until July 2006, marking the last occasion the Lexus flagship was produced in a single body style. In Japan, the equivalent Toyota Celsior was also sold from August 2000 until March 2006, when the long-awaited introduction of Lexus Japan saw the arrival of new generation Lexus models. XF30 design patents were filed by Toyota in domestic Japan, on 8 March 1999 at the Japan Patent Office under patent number 1080448.|$|E

40|$|In {{the recent}} past, {{there have been}} several {{initiatives}} by major network providers such as Turk Telekom lead the industry towards network capacity distribution in Turkey. In this study, we use a monopoly pricing model to examine the optimal pricing strategies for “pay-per-volume” and “pay-per-time” based leasing of data networks. Traditionally, network capacity distribution includes short/long term bandwidth and/or usage time leasing. Each consumer has a choice to select volume <b>based</b> <b>pricing</b> or connection time <b>based</b> <b>pricing.</b> When customers choose connection time <b>based</b> <b>pricing,</b> their optimal behavior would be utilizing the bandwidth capacity fully therefore it can cause network to burst. Also, offering pay-per-volume scheme to the consumer provides the advantage of leasing the excess capacity for other potential customers for network provider. We examine the following issues in this study: (i) What are the extra benefits to the network provider for providing the volume <b>based</b> <b>pricing</b> scheme? and (ii) Does the amount of demand (number of customers enter the market) change? The contribution {{of this paper is to}} show that pay-per-volume is a viable alternative for a large number of customers, and that judicious pricing for pay-per-volume is profitable for the network provider. ...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{application}} of marginal cost <b>based</b> spot <b>pricing</b> techniques to the short run coordination of decentralised, and potentially competitive, electricity markets. A Dispatch <b>Based</b> <b>Pricing</b> philosophy is proposed which requires that the dispatcher of a power system determine spot prices which are consistent with both the observed power system dispatch and the offers and bids issued by market participants. Whereas previous research has involved determining prices corresponding to an optimised power system dispatch, Dispatch <b>Based</b> <b>Pricing</b> is more flexible, requiring no such optimality assumption while generating incentives which encourage efficient dispatch. Pricing relationships are formed, and the resulting incentives analysed, by applying duality theory to mathematical programming formulations of the dispatch problem. A detailed theoretical description of a dispatch <b>based</b> <b>pricing</b> model, <b>based</b> on an Optimal Power Flow formulation, is presented. This model {{is an extension of}} the ex post pricing model of Hogan (1991). As well as presenting a more general representation of dispatch variable relationships, we demonstrate the underlying mathematical relationships which drive the economic interpretation of this model. In addition, we explore the behaviour of transmission flow constraints in cyclic networks, and describe the modifications needed to price for security requirements consistent with current operational practices in New Zealand. We explore the extension of Dispatch <b>Based</b> <b>Pricing</b> to situations beyond the scope of the Optimal Power Flow problem, and even to situations which are strictly incompatible with a pure marginal cost based analysis. We develop a "best compromise" pricing approach which, for (seemingly) economically inconsistent dispatches, minimises the side payments required to account for the difference between the market clearing spot prices and the offers and bids of the market participants. We develop and discuss methods for determining dispatch <b>based</b> <b>prices</b> which are consistent with primal inter-temporal constraints, uncertainty, and integer variables...|$|R
