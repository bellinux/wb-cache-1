5000|$|In the 2017 film Kong: Skull Island, Kong is scaled to be 104 ft tall, {{making it}} the biggest {{incarnation}} in the series. Director Jordan Vogt-Roberts stated in regards to Kong's immense stature, [...] The thing that most interested me was, how big {{do you need to}} make Kong, so that when someone lands on this island and doesn’t believe in the idea of myth, the idea of wonder - when {{we live in a world}} of social and civil unrest, and everything is crumbling around us, and technology and facts are taking over - how big does this creature need to be, so that when you stand on the ground and you look up at it, the only thing that can go through your mind is: [...] "That's a god!" [...] He also stated that the original 1933 look was the inspiration for the design saying, [...] We sort of went back to the 1933 version in the sense that he’s a bipedal creature that walks in an upright position, as opposed to the anthropomorphic, anatomically correct silverback gorilla that walks on all fours. Our Kong was intended to say, like, this isn’t just a <b>big</b> <b>gorilla</b> or a big monkey. This is something that is its own species. It has its own set of rules, so we can do what we want and we really wanted to pay homage to what came before…and yet do something completely different, and If anything, our Kong is meant to be a throwback to the ’33 version. I don’t think there’s much similarity at all between our version and Peter Jackson’s Kong. That version is very much a scaled-up silverback gorilla, and ours is something that is slightly more exaggerated. A big mandate for us was, How do we make this feel like a classic movie monster? [...] Co-Producer Mary Parent also stated that Kong is still young and not fully grown as she explains, [...] "Kong is an adolescent when we meet him in the film; he's still growing into his role as alpha.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis study {{investigated}} whether in speech production object properties flow in a cascaded manner or whether cascaded processing {{is restricted to}} the object's identity. In Experiments 1 and 2, participants saw pictured objects and had to state either their size (GRAND or PETIT-meaning big and small) or their name. The size of the objects varied {{as a function of}} the way they were presented on the computer screen (Experiment 1) or their real size in the world (Experiment 2). In Experiment 3, faces of young and old men were coloured in yellow or in green. The task was to name either the colour (JAUNE or VERT, meaning yellow and green, respectively) or the age (JEUNE or VIEUX, meaning young and old, respectively) of the face. In Experiments 1 and 2, no reliable effects of phonological relatedness ("GORILLE-grand"-a <b>big</b> <b>gorilla)</b> were found on the object-naming latencies. However, size-naming latencies were shorter when the adjective shared the initial phoneme of the picture name (i. e., "GRAND-gorille") than when it did not (i. e., "GRAND-dinosaure"-saying "big" in response to a big dinosaur). In Experiment 3, phonological overlap did not affect colour naming latencies, or age naming latencies. Overall, these findings strongly suggest that cascaded processing is restricted to the object's identity in conceptually driven naming tasks...|$|E
2500|$|Lincoln Park is {{well known}} for the Lincoln Park Zoo, a free zoo that is open year-round. Lincoln Park Zoo is home {{to a wide variety of}} animals. The zoo {{includes}} <b>big</b> cats, penguins, <b>gorillas,</b> reptiles, monkeys, and other species totalling nearly 1,250 animals. [...] Two sections of Lincoln Park Zoo have been set aside for children. The partially indoor Pritzker Family Children's Zoo includes habitats of various North American wildlife, and the Farm-in-the-Zoo is a working reproduction of a Midwestern farm containing horses and livestock such as pigs, cows, and sheep. At the Farm-in-the-Zoo, children can feed and interact with the animals and view live demonstrations of farm work such as the milking of cows. [...] In 2010, the Zoo transformed the South Pond, to create a wildlife marsh habitat, with a Nature Boardwalk.|$|R
30|$|In {{the gorilla}} experiment, radiologists {{were looking for}} small, round, white lung nodules and missed a <b>big,</b> irregular, black <b>gorilla.</b> In other SoS experiments, the found and missed targets are of the same kind. Observers fail to report the second nodule or the second letter “T” {{in a search for}} “T” among “L”s (Fleck et al., 2010). As Cain et al. (2013) point out, SoS (or SSM) errors most likely arise from {{multiple}} causes. In some cases, finding the first target may deplete resources that would otherwise help find subsequent targets (Adamo et al., 2013; Cain & Mitroff, 2013). In some cases (like the gorilla case), properties of the first target guide attention away from a second target. Thus, finding a light-colored T makes it less likely that an observer will find a dark T (Fleck et al., 2010). In some cases, the original idea—that observers simply abandon search too quickly—appears to contribute to SoS errors (Cain, Vul, Clark, & Mitroff, 2012).|$|R
5000|$|Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times {{gave the}} film 3 stars out of 4, saying, [...] "Mighty Joe Young is an energetic, robust {{adventure}} tale: not too cynical, violent or fragmented for kids, not too tame for adults. After all the calculation behind [...] "Godzilla" [...] or [...] "Armageddon," [...] {{it has a}} kind of innocence. It's not about a monster but about a very <b>big,</b> well-meaning <b>gorilla</b> that just wants to be left in peace." [...] Despite giving the film positive reviews, he also pointed out that the romance scenes and villains were only average and by no means exceptional. Common Sense Media gave the film 4 stars and said, [...] "The 1949 RKO version of Mighty Joe Young is a tired monster film of the ape-runs-amuck variety that tried (unsuccessfully) {{to cash in on the}} popularity of King Kong. This Disney version has plenty more to offer a young audience. As Jill follows in her mom's footsteps, this environmentally-friendly story provides serious food for thought. It also provides plenty of comic relief. Joe is a feat of technical wizardry; he's so life-like that it's hard to believe he's a composite of animatronic and digital effects. Children will warm to him, especially since Joe is particularly sweet to kids. They will also enjoy Theron's and Paxton's engaging performances, and applaud (as an 8 year-old viewer did) when this couple inevitably gets together. If the climactic sequence is too intense for small children, it certainly ends happily. Mighty Joe Young turns out to be a heart-warming experience with an environmental message." [...] Reelviews Movie Reviews gave the film 3 stars out of 4, and generally positive reviews: [...] "Although Joe's size makes him a monster, his disposition makes him cuddly. Despite not being daring in style or story, Mighty Joe Young is nevertheless a charming and enjoyable adventure, and a rare remake that's better than the original. It may not have the box office punch to exceed the $100 million mark, but it's good enough to entertain an audience." [...] Colin Fraser of eFilm Critic gave it 3 stars, saying, [...] "Strictly for ten-year-olds, Mighty Joe Young has its ample heart in exactly the right place. After an opening sequence that will have kiddies reaching for Kleenex, the action soon picks up with many a thrill on the way. This is not Jurassic Park however and doesn't really deserve its Academy nomination for effects." ...|$|R
