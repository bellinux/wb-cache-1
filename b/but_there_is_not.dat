5|$|As a child William {{was educated}} in Jerusalem, at the cathedral {{school in the}} Church of the Holy Sepulchre. The scholaster, or school-master, John the Pisan, taught William to read and write, and first {{introduced}} him to Latin. From the Historia {{it is clear that}} he also knew French and possibly Italian, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> enough evidence to determine whether he learned Greek, Persian, and Arabic, as is sometimes claimed.|$|E
5|$|Regarding the {{relations}} of early Philippine polities with the various state-level polities of Indonesia and Malaysia, legendary accounts often mention the interaction of early Philippine polities with the Srivijaya empire, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> much archeological evidence to definitively support such a relationship. Considerable evidence exists, on the other hand, for extensive trade with the Majapahit empire.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 10th century and early 9th century BC, {{the site was}} reoccupied but its name during that time is unknown; three human head sculptures made of basalt were {{discovered}} in the site; they probably date to the mid-9th century BC. At this time, the region was probably {{under the control of}} Palistin, with Qatna under the rule of Hamath, which was probably part of Palistin. The basalt heads bear similarities to a statue discovered in Palistin's capital, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> enough information to allow a general conclusion over the borders of Palistin and its extent into Qatna. The settlement was a small one; it included large buildings that were used both as residences and manufacturing facilities.|$|E

5|$|While {{there are}} earlier {{examples}} in the Republican period and early Imperial period, the growth of domed construction increased under Emperor Nero and the Flavians in the 1st century AD, and during the 2nd century. Centrally planned halls become increasingly important parts of palace and palace villa layouts beginning in the 1st century, serving as state banqueting halls, audience rooms, or throne rooms. Formwork was arranged either horizontally or radially, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> enough surviving evidence from the 1st and 2nd centuries to say what was typical.|$|E
5|$|Initial {{management}} with non–medication based treatments is recommended. NSAIDs {{are recommended}} {{if these are}} not sufficiently effective. Normal activity should be continued {{as much as the}} pain allows. Medications are recommended for the duration that they are helpful. A number of other options are available {{for those who do not}} improve with usual treatment. Opioids may be useful if simple pain medications are not enough, but they are not generally recommended due to side effects. Surgery may be beneficial for those with disc-related chronic pain and disability or spinal stenosis. No clear benefit has been found for other cases of non-specific low back pain. Low back pain often affects mood, which may be improved by counseling or antidepressants. Additionally, there are many alternative medicine therapies, including the Alexander technique and herbal remedies, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> enough evidence to recommend them confidently. The evidence for chiropractic care and spinal manipulation is mixed.|$|E
25|$|However, an {{even more}} {{extensive}} and sustainable coastal resource is forage fish, such as anchovies and herring. This fishery {{is an integral part}} of the pole and line tuna fishery, since tuna feed on the forage fish. Future development of the traditional pole and line tuna fishery depends on the availability of this bait fishery. Catch rate for forage fish have increased greatly in recent years, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> enough data to really know what the current status of the forage fish stocks are.|$|E

25|$|UF {{launched}} a new program {{in the fall of}} 2015 called PaCE, or Pathway to Campus Enrollment. PaCE was designed to provide an alternative way to enroll students who would have been accepted through regular admissions, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> enough space in dorms or classrooms. To be accepted into the PaCE program, you would have been accepted to UF initially. PaCE was randomly given to admitted students based on major. Through PaCE, students are admitted to UF, but are required to complete 60 credit hours and all of their prerequisite courses through UF online before transitioning to on-campus learning. The University of Florida admitted 2420 students for PaCE for the class of 2021.|$|E
25|$|When push-points are absent, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> {{enough space}} to use sidewinding because of lateral constraints, {{such as in}} tunnels, snakes rely on {{concertina}} locomotion. In this mode, the snake braces the posterior portion of its body against the tunnel wall while {{the front of the}} snake extends and straightens. The front portion then flexes and forms an anchor point, and the posterior is straightened and pulled forwards. This mode of locomotion is slow and very demanding, up to seven times the cost of laterally undulating over the same distance. This high cost is due to the repeated stops and starts of portions of the body as well as the necessity of using active muscular effort to brace against the tunnel walls.|$|E
500|$|Two correctors {{worked on}} the manuscript, one (B2) {{contemporary}} with the scribes, the other (B3) in about the 10th or 11th century, although the theory of a first corrector, B1, proposed by Tischendorf was rejected by later scholars. According to Tischendorf, one of the scribes is identical to (and may have been) one of the scribes of the Codex Sinaiticus (scribe D), but there is insufficient evidence for his assertion. Skeat agreed that the writing style {{is very similar to}} that of Sinaiticus, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> enough evidence to accept identity of scribes; [...] "the identity of the scribal tradition stands beyond dispute".|$|E

500|$|Stach and Brod {{state that}} {{during the time that}} Kafka knew Felice Bauer, he had an affair with a friend of hers, Margarethe [...] "Grete" [...] Bloch, a Jewish woman from Berlin. Brod says that Bloch gave birth to Kafka's son, {{although}} Kafka never knew about the child. The boy, whose name is not known, was born in 1914 or 1915 and died in Munich in 1921. However, Kafka's biographer Peter-André Alt claims that, while Bloch had a son, Kafka was not the father as the pair were never intimate. Stach states that Bloch had a son, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> solid proof and moreover contradictory evidence that Kafka was the father.|$|E
500|$|The {{day after}} the fire the Office of Woods and Forests issued a report {{outlining}} the damage, stating that [...] "the strictest enquiry is in progress as {{to the cause of}} this calamity, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> the slightest reason to suppose that it has arisen from any other than accidental causes." [...] The Times reported on some of the possible causes of the fire, but indicated that it was likely that the burning of the Exchequer tallies was to blame. The same day the cabinet ministers who were in London met for an emergency cabinet meeting; they ordered a list of witnesses to be drawn up, and on 22 October a committee of the Privy Council sat to investigate the fire.|$|E
500|$|Some reviewers {{still felt}} that Lightning Bolt was {{not up to}} the {{standards}} set by the band's previous work. Blue Sullivan of Slant Magazine gave the album three out of five stars, saying that the album had a [...] "familiar spark" [...] and was dragged down by [...] "Pearl Jam's antiseptic '70s-album-rock-radio conservatism, along with frontman Eddie Vedder's ham-fisted lyrics", ultimately concluding that [...] "Lightning Bolt is no masterwork. Years removed from the raw emotion and desperate appetites of youth, Pearl Jam has slipped into alt-rock elder statesmanship as one would a comfortable old sweater." [...] Rob Harvilla of Spin gave the album a six out of ten, describing it as [...] "far from an implosion, far from spectacular", criticizing the focus on calm songs and considering that Backspacer [...] "barked louder and bit harder overall." [...] In his 5.0 out of 10 review for Pitchfork, Stuart Berman also had a negative reaction to what he described as [...] "centerpiece ballads [...] tread on odious Lite-FM territory and forcefully tip the scales from poignant to maudlin". Philip Cosores of Paste gave the album a 4.0 out of 10, saying [...] "The album does grow on the listener, as Vedder's voice and the band's seeming ambivalence to all musical trends and developments outside of them is strangely comforting. And maybe some of these songs will come alive when performed, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> a single one to love in the set. Essentially, the cruise control is running onward with disregard for all the maintenance and repairs that an engine needs, and the result is the worst album of their career." ...|$|E

Various other bronze artifacts have been described as money (e.g. [...] "bridge money"); these are now believed to be various types of ornaments, not related to currency.|$|E
