5|$|During 2001 Seventh Avenue were finalists for the Brisbane Rock Award, {{which earned}} {{them the right}} to play at Queen Street Mall Basement. This {{performance}} attracted Shawthing Entertainment's Greg Shaw, who <b>became</b> <b>their</b> manager. The band worked with Stuart Stuart (The Veronicas), Dave Nicholas (INXS, Sting), Trey Bruce (Faith Hill) and Randy Staub (Nickelback, Metallica) on song writing or recordings. They met John Woodruff (Savage Garden, Evermore), after he had heard their early demos, who <b>became</b> <b>their</b> next manager in 2001. He recommended them to Sony BMG.|$|E
5|$|Beecham's {{repertoire}} was eclectic, sometimes favouring lesser-known composers over famous ones. His specialities included composers {{whose works}} were neglected in Britain before he <b>became</b> <b>their</b> advocate, such as Delius and Berlioz. Other composers with whose music he was frequently associated were Haydn, Schubert, Sibelius and the composer he revered above all others, Mozart.|$|E
5|$|Fowler {{signed with}} the North Queensland Fury on 4 February 2009 and <b>became</b> <b>their</b> inaugural marquee player; with his family {{relocating}} to Townsville for the 2009–10 season of the Australian A-League. It was an important signing for the new franchise who struggled to sign a marquee player, while some questioned whether Fowler {{would be able to}} cope with the heat and humidity of North Queensland.|$|E

5|$|Paramore was a {{commercial}} success, debuting at {{number one on}} the US Billboard 200 with first-week sales of 106,000 copies. The album also topped the charts in Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Ireland, and New Zealand, where it <b>became</b> <b>their</b> first album to reach the summit. It also <b>became</b> <b>their</b> second chart topper in the United Kingdom. In March 2016, Paramore was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), for sales exceeding 1,000,000. The group followed the record release with The Self-Titled Tour in promotion, with European, North American, Asian, Latin American, and Oceania legs announced. In 2014, Fall Out Boy and Paramore co-headlined Monumentour. A deluxe edition of the album was released on November 24, 2014.|$|E
5|$|Released {{after a long}} hiatus, The Strokes' fourth album Angles (2011) <b>became</b> <b>their</b> third {{consecutive}} LP to chart at number four on the Billboard 200.

5|$|AC/DC {{underwent}} several line-up changes before releasing {{their first}} album, High Voltage, in 1975. Membership subsequently stabilised until bassist Mark Evans {{was replaced by}} Cliff Williams in 1977 for the album Powerage. Within months of recording the album Highway to Hell, lead singer and co-songwriter Bon Scott died on 19 February 1980 {{after a night of}} heavy alcohol consumption. The group considered disbanding, but buoyed by support from Scott's parents, decided to continue and set about finding a new vocalist. Ex-Geordie singer Brian Johnson was auditioned and selected to replace Scott. Later that year, the band released the new album, Back in Black, which was made as a tribute to Bon Scott. The album launched them to new heights of success and <b>became</b> <b>their</b> all-time best-seller.|$|E
5|$|After a {{subsequent}} tour, Iron Maiden {{started working on}} their next studio effort, Seventh Son of a Seventh Son, which featured more progressive rock elements than the band's previous records. Although it <b>became</b> <b>their</b> second release to top the UK charts, it was also Dickinson's first album with the band that did not achieve platinum status in the US. Unlike Somewhere in Time, Dickinson was much more enthusiastic about this album due to its concept and has several song-writing credits. After the following tour in 1988, the band {{decided to take a}} year off.|$|E
5|$|After renovation, {{owing to}} du Maurier's sponsorship, the {{facility}} {{was named the}} Stanley Theatre du Maurier Stage, {{taken over by the}} Arts Club Theatre Company and later <b>became</b> <b>their</b> main stage. This venue has allowed the Arts Club to put on new kinds of shows, such as large musicals, classics and productions from around the world. The first production was Swing!, which opened on October 28, 1998 and had a successful run, followed by Hamlet. In addition to showing Arts Club productions, the theatre is rented out for other purposes, including business and educational presentations, and has been used for comedy acts and concerts, such as Lorne Elliott, Francis Cabrel, and RyanDan.|$|E

5|$|At {{the time}} of his death, Agnew's legacy was {{perceived}} largely in negative terms. The circumstances of his fall, particularly in the light of his declared dedication to law and order, did much to engender cynicism and distrust towards politicians of every stripe. His disgrace led to a greater degree of care in the selection of potential vice presidents; had Nixon researched Agnew's background before choosing him, a national crisis might have been averted. Most of the running mates selected by the major parties after 1972 were seasoned politicians – Walter Mondale, George H. W. Bush, Lloyd Bentsen, Al Gore, Dick Cheney – some of whom themselves <b>became</b> <b>their</b> party's nominee for president.|$|E
5|$|Countdown to Extinction {{received}} {{positive reaction}} from music critics, who noted its politically oriented lyrics and simplified sound {{in comparison to}} their previous record. The album entered the Billboard 200 at number two, the band's highest position ever. It eventually achieved double platinum status and <b>became</b> <b>their</b> most commercially successful album. The record was nominated for Best Metal Performance at the 1993 Grammy Awards, while the album's title track won the Humane Society's Genesis Award for raising awareness for animal rights issues.|$|E
5|$|In February 2007, Durant {{received}} {{an invitation to}} the United States national team training camp. Despite a strong performance, he was cut from the team when its roster was trimmed to its twelve-player limit. Coach Mike Krzyzewski cited the experience of the remaining players as the deciding factor in making the cut. Durant was finally selected to the national team at the 2010 FIBA World Championship and <b>became</b> <b>their</b> leader as other All-Stars were unavailable, a role he downplayed. At the tournament, he led Team USA to its first FIBA World Championship since 1994, earning MVP honors in the process. His final averages for the competition were 22.8 points, 6.1 rebounds, 3.1 assists, and 1.4 steals per game in nine games.|$|E

5|$|In May 1923 {{he visited}} {{continental}} Europe, journeying to the museums in Lausanne, Bern and Zürich to study their prehistoric artefact collections; that year {{he became a}} member of the Royal Anthropological Institute. In 1925, the Institute offered him one of the only archaeological jobs then available in Britain, and he <b>became</b> <b>their</b> librarian, in doing so cementing connections with scholars across Europe. This job meant that he came into contact with many of Britain's archaeologists, of whom there were relatively few during the 1920s; he developed a great friendship with O. G. S. Crawford, the Archaeological Officer to the Ordnance Survey, influencing the latter's move toward socialism and Marxism.|$|E
5|$|In September 1988, {{the band}} were {{promoting}} their second album, Fingertips, when Paul's infant daughter died of SIDS. Although devastated, the group continued {{with a lower}} profile, and Anthony left to resume his university studies yet returned periodically to record their later studio albums. Early in 1991 Anthony and Fatt founded a children's music group, The Wiggles. The Cockroaches alumni served as musical and performing support for the new group; John wrote much of their music, Paul <b>became</b> <b>their</b> manager, and Henry performed with them. The Wiggles used many of The Cockroaches' business practices and reworked some of their songs into the children's music genre.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} give the strike teeth and to protect himself from harm, Verro {{became a member of}} a Mafia group in Corleone, the Fratuzzi (Little Brothers). However, during the great strike of the Fasci in September 1893, the Fratuzzi mobilized to boycott it, {{providing}} the necessary manpower to work on the lands that the peasants refused to cultivate. After that, Verro broke away from the mafiosi, and – according to police reports – <b>became</b> <b>their</b> most bitter enemy. He was killed by the Mafia in 1915 when he was the mayor of Corleone.|$|E

Paul Oscar <b>became</b> <b>their</b> groupie, and {{about the same time}} {{released}} his first album, Stuð (Groove). In October 1993, Paul Oscar started singing with a band called Milljónamæringarnir (The Millionaires), which released the albums Milljón á mann (A Million for Each, 1994), Allur pakkinn (The Whole Lot, 1999) and Þetta er nú meiri vitleysan (This is Completely Foolish, 2001).|$|E
5|$|Mírzá Yahyá's {{leadership}} was controversial. He generally absented {{himself from the}} Bábí community, spending his time in Baghdad in hiding and disguise; on several occasions he {{went so far as}} to publicly disavow allegiance to the Báb. Mírzá Yahyá gradually alienated himself from a large number of the Bábís, who started giving their allegiance to other claimants. During the time that Mírzá Yahyá remained in hiding, Bahá'u'lláh performed much of the daily administration of Bábí affairs. In contrast to Mírzá Yahyá, Bahá'u'lláh was outgoing and accessible and he was seen by an increasing number of Bábís as a religious leader, rather than just an organizer, and <b>became</b> <b>their</b> center of devotion.|$|E
5|$|On {{the eve of}} World War II in 1939, SBC, {{like other}} Swiss banks, was the {{recipient}} of large influxes of foreign funds for safekeeping.

The office, located in the Equitable Building, was able to begin operations {{a few weeks after the}} outbreak of the war and was intended as a safe place to store assets in the case of an invasion. During the war, the banks' traditional business fell off and the Swiss government <b>became</b> <b>their</b> largest client.|$|E
