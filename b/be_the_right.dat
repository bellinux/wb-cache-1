5|$|Bill Fulcher supplanted Bud Carson. Fulcher {{appeared}} to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> choice but quit after two seasons, {{overwhelmed by the}} Tech fan base. Fulcher's tenure included a terrible feud with Eddie McAshan, which peaked before the 1972 UGA game. McAshan had requested additional tickets for the game so that his family could attend. Fulcher refused the ticket request and McAshan sat out of practice in protest. Fulcher responded by suspending the quarterback for the UGA game and the upcoming Liberty Bowl. The story exploded {{on the national scene}} when Jesse Jackson attended the UGA game, allowing McAshan to sit with him outside of the stadium in protest.|$|E
5|$|There was {{rivalry between}} the lords of the manor and borough. The {{lord of the}} manor complained in 1328 that the burgesses were holding private markets, from which he gained no revenue. The rivalry {{continued}} in the 16th century, with Bishop Stanley unsuccessfully challenging {{the right of the}} burgesses to hold markets, believing it should <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> of the lord of the manor. In 1583 the corporation of the borough attempted to usurp the lord of the manor by laying claim to the lordship. They did so because they felt they were fulfilling the duties of the lord: to improve waste and common land and allowing construction on this land, running courts, and mining coal. A compromise was reached, dividing some power between the two parties.|$|E
5|$|Zombi 2 {{serves as}} a sequel to Zombi, a re-edited Italian release of George A. Romero's 1978 film Dawn of the Dead; Zombi had been edited by Dario Argento and given a new score by the Italian band Goblin, and proved {{successful}} upon its release in Italy. As Italian copyright law allows any film to be marketed as a sequel to another work, the film was quickly greenlit and financed by producer Fabrizio De Angelis. Enzo G. Castellari was offered to direct Zombi 2, but turned it down as {{he did not feel}} he would <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> director for a horror film. Director Lucio Fulci was De Angelis' second choice for the project, and was hired based on his handling of violent scenes in his previous films Sette note in nero and Non si sevizia un paperino.|$|E

5|$|In 1804, Clarkson {{resumed his}} work and the Society for Effecting the Abolition of the Slave Trade began meeting again, {{strengthened}} with prominent new members such as Zachary Macaulay, Henry Brougham and James Stephen. In June 1804, Wilberforce's bill to abolish the slave trade successfully passed all its stages through the House of Commons. However, {{it was too late}} in the parliamentary session for it to complete its passage through the House of Lords. On its reintroduction during the 1805 session, it was defeated, with even the usually sympathetic Pitt failing to support it. On this occasion and throughout the campaign, abolition was held back by Wilberforce's trusting, even credulous nature, and his deferential attitude towards those in power. He found it difficult to believe that men of rank would not do what he perceived to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> thing, and was reluctant to confront them when they did not.|$|E
5|$|The {{system of}} noble {{democracy}} became more firmly rooted {{during the first}} interregnum, {{after the death of}} Sigismund II Augustus, who following the Union of Lublin wanted to reassert his personal power, rather than become an executor of szlachta's will. A lack of agreement concerning the method and timing of the election of his successor was one of the casualties of the situation, and the conflict strengthened the Senate-magnate camp. After the monarch's 1572 death, to protect its common interests, szlachta moved to establish territorial confederations (kapturs) as provincial governments, through which public order was protected and basic court system provided. The magnates were able to push through their candidacy for the interrex or regent to hold the office until a new king is sworn, in the person of the primate, Jakub Uchański. The Senate took over the election preparations. The establishment's proposition of universal szlachta participation (rather than election by the Sejm) appeared at that time to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> idea to most szlachta factions; in reality, during this first as well as subsequent elections, the magnates subordinated and directed, especially the poorer of szlachta.|$|E

The Japanese ambassador, Oshima Hiroshi, kept Tokyo informed of these developments.

25|$|The third {{regional}} final matched up the top seeded North Carolina Tar Heels and {{the sixth}} seeded Badgers from Wisconsin. The Tar Heels started off hot {{in this one}} as Sean May and Rashad McCants scored at will. When point guard Raymond Felton garnered his second foul, head coach Roy Williams decided to pull him to prevent further foul trouble. Up 11 at the time, it seemed to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> move. Wisconsin would prove Williams wrong as they finished the half on an 11-0 run, tying the game at 44 heading into the half. The Tar Heels struggled to start the second half as hot as the first and trailed {{for the first time}} since the opening minutes of the game. Sparked by May's 29 points and 11 boards and Felton's clutch free throws, they outlasted the Badgers and won the game by six in regulation.|$|E

After a sub-par {{performance in}} the tournament opener, Lang proved to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> import for Red Bull.

The Beermen later tied the series at 2–2 in a physically intense battle that saw several suspensions on the Red Bull side. But in Game five, Red Bull won 79–77 after a potential game-tying basket by San Miguel import Nate Johnson was blocked from behind by Miller with no time left. In Game six, Lang recovered from a four-point outing in Game five to lead Red Bull to their first PBA championship. Lang was also named as Best Import of the Commissioners Cup.|$|E

When Alison goes into labor and is unable to contact her doctor, she calls Ben, as Debbie and Pete are at Legoland. Ben discovers that the gynecologist they had been seeing (Loudon Wainwright) is out of town, despite having assured them that he never took vacations. Ben calls him and leaves a furious voicemail, threatening murder. During labor, Alison apologizes for doubting Ben's commitment and admits that she never thought the man who got her pregnant would <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> one for her. When Debbie and Pete arrive at the hospital, Ben adamantly refuses {{to allow her to}} be at Alison's side, insisting that it's his place. Debbie is both furious and impressed that Ben took charge of the situation and begins to change her formerly negative opinion about him. The couple welcomes a baby girl (a boy in the alternate ending) and settle down happily together in a new apartment in Los Angeles.|$|E
