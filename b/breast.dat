5|$|Brachytherapy for <b>breast</b> or {{skin cancer}} may cause scar tissue to form around the {{treatment}} area. In {{the case of}} <b>breast</b> brachytherapy, fat necrosis may occur {{as a result of}} fatty acids entering the <b>breast</b> tissues. This can cause the <b>breast</b> tissue to become swollen and tender. Fat necrosis is a benign condition and typically occurs 4–12 months after treatment and affects about 2% of patients.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the fact}} that the Russos' studies found similar risk rates between virgin and {{pregnancy}} interrupted rats, their research would be used to support the contention that abortion created a greater risk of <b>breast</b> cancer for the next twenty years. However, because rats do not exhibit naturally occurring <b>breast</b> cancer, the extrapolation of these results to human abortion and <b>breast</b> cancer is viewed as dubious.|$|E
25|$|Along {{with their}} major {{function}} in providing nutrition for infants, female <b>breasts</b> have social and sexual characteristics. <b>Breasts</b> have {{been featured in}} notable ancient and modern sculpture, art, and photography. Female <b>breasts</b> can figure prominently in a woman's perception of her body image and sexual attractiveness. A number of Western cultures associate <b>breasts</b> with sexuality and tend to regard bare <b>breasts</b> in public as immodest or indecent. <b>Breasts</b> and especially the nipples are an erogenous zone on women.|$|R

5|$|In general, {{strongly}} inherited gene mutations (including {{mutations in}} BRCA2) {{account for only}} 5-10% of <b>breast</b> cancer cases; the specific risk of getting <b>breast</b> or other cancer for anyone carrying a BRCA2 mutation depends on many factors.|$|E
5|$|Some anti-abortion {{activists have}} {{continued}} to advance a discredited causal link between abortion and <b>breast</b> cancer. In the United States, they have advanced state legislation that in several states requires health care providers to present abortion {{as a cause of}} <b>breast</b> cancer when counseling women who are seeking abortion. This political intervention culminated when the George W. Bush administration altered the National Cancer Institute website to suggest that abortion might cause <b>breast</b> cancer. In response to public concern over this intervention, the NCI convened a 2003 workshop bringing together over 100 experts on the issue. This workshop concluded that while some studies reported a statistical correlation between <b>breast</b> cancer and abortion, the strongest scientific evidence from large prospective cohort studies demonstrates that abortion is not associated with an increase in <b>breast</b> cancer risk, and that the positive findings were likely due to response bias.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>breasts</b> of a {{beautiful}} woman {{were supposed to be}} [...] "unobtrusive." [...] Idealized <b>breasts</b> in the tradition of Hellenistic poetry were compared to apples; Martial makes fun of large <b>breasts.</b> Old women who were stereotypically ugly and undesirable in every way had [...] "pendulous" [...] <b>breasts.</b> On the Roman stage, exaggerated <b>breasts</b> were part of the costuming for comically unattractive female characters, since in classic Roman comedy women's roles were played by male actors in drag.|$|R
5000|$|Many {{women also}} believe that wearing a {{brassiere}} will prevent their <b>breasts</b> from sagging later in life and that <b>breasts</b> cannot anatomically support themselves.

25|$|In the 14th century, necklines were lowered, {{clothes were}} {{tightened}} and <b>breasts</b> {{were once again}} flaunted. It was during the Renaissance period that the corset was born. <b>Breasts</b> were pushed up, pushed together and molded into firm protruding decorations that emphasized <b>breasts</b> to the maximum. In 1450, Agnès Sorel, mistress to Charles VII of France, is credited with starting a fashion when she wore deep low square décolleté gowns with fully bared <b>breasts</b> in the French court. Other aristocratic women of the time who were painted with <b>breasts</b> exposed included Simonetta Vespucci, whose portrait with exposed <b>breasts</b> was painted by Piero di Cosimo in c.1480.|$|R

5|$|The abortion–breast cancer {{hypothesis}} {{posits that}} having an induced abortion {{can increase the}} risk of getting <b>breast</b> cancer. This hypothesis is at odds with mainstream scientific opinion and is contradicted by major medical professional organizations. In early pregnancy, hormone levels increase, leading to <b>breast</b> growth. The hypothesis proposes that if this process is interrupted by an abortion then more immature cells could be left behind, resulting in a greater potential risk of <b>breast</b> cancer over time.|$|E
5|$|Underwire bras, {{like other}} constrictive garments, may {{contribute}} to clogged milk ducts in lactating women. Fluctuating <b>breast</b> size during pregnancy poses another problem. Because underwire bras are rigid, they do not easily accommodate changes in <b>breast</b> size, and an ill-fitting bra that {{does not support the}} breasts correctly can cause discomfort and pain. For several days after a mastectomy, or as long as the <b>breast</b> is tender, a woman is advised not to use an underwire bra.|$|E
50|$|Sports bras {{can either}} {{encapsulate}} or compress <b>breasts.</b> Bras that encapsulate <b>breasts</b> have molded cups, while compression-type bras restrict movement by flattening the <b>breasts.</b> Encapsulation-type bras generally {{are more effective}} at reducing discomfort, but some women prefer compression designs.|$|R

25|$|The <b>breast</b> implant has no {{clinical}} bearing upon lumpectomy breast-conservation {{surgery for}} women who developed <b>breast</b> cancer after the implantation procedure, nor does the <b>breast</b> implant interfere with external beam radiation treatments (XRT); moreover, the post-treatment incidence of breast-tissue fibrosis is common, and thus a consequent increased rate of capsular contracture. The study <b>Breast</b> Cancer Detection and Survival among Women with Cosmetic <b>Breast</b> Implants: Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Observational Studies, reported a significant delay in the diagnoses of women who developed <b>breast</b> cancer after undergoing <b>breast</b> augmentation, when compared to <b>breast</b> cancer patients who had not undergone <b>breast</b> augmentation. The metadata study <b>Breast</b> Implants following Mastectomy in Women with Early-stage <b>Breast</b> Cancer: Prevalence and Impact on Survival (2005) reported that <b>breast</b> augmentation patients were statistically likelier to die from <b>breast</b> cancer. Although the use of implants for <b>breast</b> reconstruction after <b>breast</b> cancer mastectomy appears to have no negative effect upon the incidence of cancer-related death, women who underwent a mastectomy procedure tend to die earlier than women who underwent a lumpectomy procedure, with like diagnoses.|$|E
25|$|A <b>breast</b> implant is a {{prosthesis}} used {{to change}} the size, shape, and contour of a woman’s <b>breast.</b> In reconstructive plastic surgery, <b>breast</b> implants can be placed to restore a natural looking <b>breast</b> mound for post–mastectomy <b>breast</b> reconstruction patients or to correct congenital defects and deformities of the chest wall. They are also used cosmetically to enhance or enlarge {{the appearance of the}} <b>breast</b> through <b>breast</b> augmentation surgery.|$|E
25|$|A {{contemporary}} woman's life-time {{probability of}} developing <b>breast</b> cancer is approximately one in seven; {{yet there is}} no causal evidence that fat grafting to the <b>breast</b> might be more conducive to <b>breast</b> cancer than are other <b>breast</b> procedures; because incidences of fat tissue necrosis and calcification occur in every such procedure: <b>breast</b> biopsy, implantation, radiation therapy, <b>breast</b> reduction, <b>breast</b> reconstruction, and liposuction of the <b>breast.</b> Nonetheless, detecting <b>breast</b> cancer is primary, and calcification incidence is secondary; thus, the patient is counselled to learn self-palpation of the <b>breast</b> and to undergo periodic mammographic examinations. Although the mammogram is the superior diagnostic technique for distinguishing among cancerous and benign lesions to the <b>breast,</b> any questionable lesion can be visualized ultrasonically and magnetically (MRI); biopsy follows any clinically suspicious lesion or indeterminate abnormality appeared in a radiograph.|$|E

5000|$|Baring the <b>breasts</b> {{is one of}} the {{gestures}} made by women, particularly mothers or nurses, {{to express}} mourning or as an appeal for mercy. The baring and beating of <b>breasts</b> ritually in grief was interpreted by Servius as producing milk to feed the dead. In Greek and Latin literature, mythological mothers sometimes expose their <b>breasts</b> in moments of extreme emotional duress to demand that their nurturing role be respected. <b>Breasts</b> exposed with such intensity held apotropaic power. Julius Caesar indicates that the gesture had a similar significance in Celtic culture: during the siege of Avaricum, the female heads of household (matres familiae) expose their <b>breasts</b> and extend their hands to ask that the women and children be spared. Tacitus notes Germanic women who exhorted their reluctant men to valorous battle by aggressively baring their <b>breasts.</b> Although in general [...] "the gesture is meant to arouse pity rather than sexual desire," [...] the beauty of the <b>breasts</b> so exposed is sometimes in evidence and remarked upon.|$|R

25|$|When the patient's {{body has}} {{insufficient}} adipocyte tissue to harvest as injectable <b>breast</b> filler, {{a combination of}} fat grafting and <b>breast</b> implants might provide the desired outcome. Although non-surgical <b>breast</b> augmentation with fat graft injections is not associated with implant-related medical complications (filler leakage, deflation, visibility, palpability, capsular contracture), the achievable <b>breast</b> volumes are physically limited; the large-volume, global bust augmentations realised with <b>breast</b> implants are not possible with the method of structural fat grafting. Global <b>breast</b> augmentation contrasts with the controlled <b>breast</b> augmentation of fat-graft injection, {{in the degree of}} control that the plastic surgeon has in achieving the desired <b>breast</b> contour and volume. The controlled augmentation is realised by infiltrating and diffusing the fat grafts throughout the breast; and it is feather-layered into the adjacent pectoral areas until achieving the desired outcome of <b>breast</b> volume and contour. Nonetheless, the physical fullness-of-breast achieved with injected fat-grafts does not visually translate into the type of buxom fullness achieved with <b>breast</b> implants; hence, patients who had plentiful fat-tissue to harvest attained a maximum <b>breast</b> augmentation of one brassiėre cup-size in one session of fat grafting to the <b>breast.</b>|$|E
25|$|The breast-volume data {{reported}} in <b>Breast</b> Augmentation with Autologous Fat Grafting: A Clinical Radiological Study (2010) indicated a mean increase of 1.2 times the initial <b>breast</b> volume, at six months post-procedure.

The breast-filler fat was harvested by liposuction (abdomen, buttocks, thighs), and yielded fat-graft volumes of 220–650cm3 per <b>breast.</b> At six months post-procedure, the follow-up treatment included photographs, intravenous contrast MRI or 3-D volumetric imaging, or both. Each woman had an increased <b>breast</b> volume of 250cm3 per <b>breast,</b> a mean volume increase confirmed by quantitative MRI analysis. The mean increase in <b>breast</b> volume was 1.2 times the initial <b>breast</b> volume measurements; the statistical difference between the pre-procedure and the six-month post-procedure <b>breast</b> volumes was (P< 00.0000007); the percentage increase basis of the <b>breast</b> volume was 60–80% of the initial, pre-procedure <b>breast</b> volume.|$|E
