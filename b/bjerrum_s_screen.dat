A working group of screen media and parenting researchers convened at the preconference workshop to the 2012 International Society for Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity (ISBNPA) annual meeting, “Parenting Measurement: Current Status and Consensus Reports,” to identify and prioritize issues in assessing screen media parenting practices. The group identified that screen media use can pose different risks for children, depending on their age and developmental stage, across physiologic, psychosocial, and development outcomes. With that in mind, a conceptual framework of how parents may influence their child 2 ̆ 7 s screen-viewing behaviors was proposed to include the screen media content, context of viewing, and amount viewed.

40|$|There {{have been}} reports of {{increasing}} numbers of cases of malaria among migrants and travelers. Although microscopic examination of blood smears remains the “gold standard” in diagnosis, this method suffers from insufficient sensitivity and requires considerable expertise. To improve diagnosis, a multiplex real-time PCR was developed. One set of generic primers targeting a highly conserved region of the 18 S rRNA gene of the genus Plasmodium was designed; the primer set was polymorphic enough internally to design four species-specific probes for P. falciparum, P. vivax, P. malarie, and P. ovale. Real-time PCR with species-specific probes detected one plasmid copy of P. falciparum, P. vivax, P. malariae, and P. ovale specifically. The same sensitivity was achieved for all species with real-time PCR with the 18 <b>S</b> <b>screening</b> probe. Ninety-seven blood samples were investigated. For 66 of them (60 patients), microscopy and real-time PCR results were compared and had a crude agreement of 86 % {{for the detection of}} plasmodia. Discordant results were reevaluated with clinical, molecular, and sequencing data to resolve them. All nine discordances between 18 <b>S</b> <b>screening</b> PCR and microscopy were resolved in favor of the molecular method, as were eight of nine discordances at the species level for the species-specific PCR among the 31 samples positive by both methods.

40|$|Screened {{electronic}} devices are quite effective at capturing children 2 ̆ 7 s and parents 2 ̆ 7 attention. Now {{an integral part}} of the daily lives of Americans, screened {{electronic devices}} such as computers, entertainment centers, gaming devices, laptops, smartphones, and tablets serve as portable offices, entertainment centers, and a means to stay connected with others. Research focusing on television viewing, the older and more traditional type of screen time, has suggested that television is positively correlated with aggression, attention problems, obesity, and poor academic performance. It is suspected that screen time, which includes all screened devices, may have potentially significant child developmental, educational, parent-child relational, and social consequences. The exposure to electronic devices has increased exponentially in the past decade, suggesting some urgency to investigate, measure, and understand this phenomenon and its potential impact, particularly on children. ^ This study examines both children 2 ̆ 7 s and parents 2 ̆ 7 time with screened electronic devices and to what extent screen time may be correlated with children 2 ̆ 7 s behavior. The parent development theory (PDT; Mowder, 2005) was used as the overarching theoretical model for defining parents and parenting. The sample consisted of 96 parents and caregivers who provided information on one 2 ̆ 2 target 2 ̆ 2 child under their care. Participants responded to two questionnaires, the Behavior Assessment System for Children, Second Edition (BASC- 2) and the screen time questionnaire (STQ). ^ Major findings of this study were: With regard to a parent engaging in screen time that distracts their attention away from their child, or parent distracting screen time, (1) a positive relationship with children 2 ̆ 7 s aggressive behavior was found, and (2) the relationship between parents 2 ̆ 7 distracting screen time and children 2 ̆ 7 s degree of somatization behaviors were determined to be moderated by parents 2 ̆ 7 educational level. With reference to children 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>screen</b> time: (1) A significant interaction was found between children 2 ̆ 7 s general use of screen time and parent employment, (2) children 2 ̆ 7 s gender was found to moderate the relationship between children 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>screen</b> time use for entertainment and withdrawal behaviors, with contrasting relationships for male and female children, and (3) parents 2 ̆ 7 employment status was found to moderate the relationship between children 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>screen</b> time for entertainment purposes and adaptive skills, particularly in the areas of activities of daily living and functional communication. Thus, the findings of this study highlight the need to take into account the particular context of screen time use (e. g., for entertainment purposes, distracting screen time), by both parents and children, when considering the relationship with children 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> behavior. As <b>screened</b> electronic devices become increasingly embedded in the parent-child dyad, further investigation is warranted to fully understand the positive and negative influences screen time may have on children 2 ̆ 7 s behavior. ...|$|R

Photorefraction consists of delivering a light beam into the eyes where it bends in the ocular media, hits the retina, and then reflects as an image back to a camera. A series of refinements and formal clinical studies followed their highly successful initial tests in the 1980 s. Evaluating over 5, 000 subjects in field tests, Kerr and Richardson used a camera system prototype with a specifically angled telephoto lens and flash to photograph a subject s eye.
