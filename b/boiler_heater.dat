50|$|A {{manufacturing}} company may have its manufacturing facilities spread over different locations. Suppose it decides {{to undertake a}} revaluation of its plant & machinery. Selective revaluation will mean revaluing specific assets (such as <b>boiler,</b> <b>heater,</b> central air-conditioning system) at all locations, or revaluing all items of Plant & Machinery at a particular location only. Such revaluation will lead to unrepresentative amounts being shown in the Fixed Assets Register (FAR). In case of revaluation of specific assets of a class, while some assets will be shown at a revalued amount others will be shown at historic cost. The same will happen in case of revaluation of all assets of plant & machinery at a particular location only.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} is {{reported}} the design and implementation of an electronic system capable of communicating over a standard ZigBee network in order to let a residential gateway collector, named agent, {{gain access to the}} parameters of a Combined Photovoltaic and Solar thermal (CPS) plant, thus realizing a networked energy production appliance. The system is made of three parts: a PV metering device, a boiler metering device also capable of controlling a heating resistor embedded within the boiler tank, and a data collector acting as a ZigBee node. The data collector device periodically retrieves the following parameters from the metering devices: instantaneous photovoltaic power production, accumulated photovoltaic energy, instantaneous <b>boiler</b> <b>heater</b> power consumption, accumulated energy consumed by the boiler resistor, water temperatures in three distinct points of the boiler. Since solar thermal and photovoltaic panels are located out of the ZigBee communication range, an RS 485 wired link between the three devices has been implemented, while the collector, usually located not far from the agent, has wireless visibility. Some of the parameters listed above are already monitored by proprietary CPS digital systems. However the implemented ZigBee nodes make these parameters accessible through an open and interoperable standard. Various IC manufacturers including Texas Instruments and Freescale provide ZigBee enabled solution. The development of the system is based on the Texas Instruments solution is described and their advantage and limitations have been experimentally studied in order to explore the possible application area...|$|E

The dimensions of a commercially available heat exchanger of a combi boiler apparatus are taken as basic dimensions and various parameters about plate fin and three different protrusions, namely balcony, winglet and imprint, are examined step by step. The study is realized within the geometrical dimension range used in actual applications. The numerical analyses of several heat exchangers are performed using Fluent CFD software. The boundary conditions used in the numerical investigation are taken from the actual operating conditions of the combi <b>boiler</b> <b>heater</b> apparatus. Firstly, the best plate fin geometry is determined. Secondly, the best protrusion dimensions are obtained. Finally, the effects of three protrusion placement on plate fin surface are examined. The fin I 5 B 2 W 3 is determined as the best among the investigated fins. The use of actual operating conditions as boundary conditions and {{the investigation of the}} individual and cumulative effects of three different protrusions are the novelties of the study. In order to validate the numerical models, a comparison with a computational and experimental study performed by Wu and Tao is also made. The results of the models created for comparison purpose show good agreement with the results given by Wu and Tao. It is also observed that results obtained from the two alternatives for the modeling, one with symmetrical and the other with periodic boundary condition, are very close. According to these results, it is concluded that the numerical outcomes obtained in the present study are reliable...|$|E
40|$|This study {{proposes a}} general {{methodology}} for assessing and estimating the potential reuse of small waste {{electrical and electronic equipment}} (sWEEE), focusing on devices classified as domestic appliances. Specific tests for visual inspection, function and safety have been defined for ten {{different types of}} household appliances (vacuum cleaner, iron, microwave, toaster, sandwich maker, hand blender, juicer, <b>boiler,</b> <b>heater</b> and hair dryer). After applying the tests, reuse protocols have been defined in the form of easy-to-apply checklists for each of the ten types of appliance evaluated. This methodology could be useful for reuse enterprises, since {{there is a lack of}} specific protocols, adapted to each type of appliance, to test its potential of reuse. After applying the methodology, electrical and electronic appliances (used or waste) can be segregated into three categories: the appliance works properly and can be classified as direct reuse (items can be used by a second consumer without prior repair operations), the appliance requires a later evaluation of its potential refurbishment and repair (restoration of products to working order, although with possible loss of quality) or the appliance needs to be finally discarded from the reuse process and goes directly to a recycling process. Results after applying the methodology to a sample of 87. 7 kg (96 units) show that 30. 2 % of the appliances have no potential for reuse and should be diverted for recycling, while 67. 7 % require a subsequent evaluation of their potential refurbishment and repair, and only 2. 1 % of them could be directly reused with minor cleaning operations. This study represents a first approach to the “preparation for reuse” strategy that the European Directive related to Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment encourages to be applied. However, more research needs to be done as an extension of this study, mainly related to the identification of the feasibility of repair or refurbishment operationsDPI 2013 - 40815 -R: INCORPORACIÓN DE LA PREPARACIÓN PARA REUTILIZACIÓN EN EL DISEÑO DE PEQUEÑO APARATO ELÉCTRICO Y ELECTRÓNICO PARA IMPULSAR EFICIENCIA EN USO DE RECURO...|$|E

40|$|The present paper {{deals with}} the {{improved}} performances and thermal comfort of individual forced hot water heating systems equipped with a gas fired wall boiler, for homes. The problems of such systems are due to the high power of the burner which causes cyclic running. Furthermore, the installation of a room thermostat is imposed by the French thermal regulations. Developed independently from the boiler, the thermostat does not fit its environment. The manual aquastat set point adjustment at the boiler {{can lead to a}} set point conflicting with that of the thermostat. Hence, the authors have developed a new room thermostat, based on a fuzzy logic function, which takes into account the system reactions. This thermostat assimilates the characteristics of the different parts of the system: <b>boiler,</b> <b>heaters,</b> building, climate, etc. The new thermostat was tested in simulation and good results were obtained.
