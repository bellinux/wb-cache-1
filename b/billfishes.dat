5|$|Virtually {{every type}} of medium to large-sized oceanic animal sharing the habitat of the cookiecutter shark is open to attack: bite scars have been found on {{cetaceans}} (including porpoises, dolphins, beaked whales, sperm whales, and baleen whales), pinnipeds (including fur seals, leopard seals, and elephant seals), dugongs, sharks (including blue sharks, goblin sharks, basking sharks, great white sharks, megamouth sharks and smalltooth sand tiger sharks), stingrays (including deepwater stingrays, pelagic stingrays and sixgill stingrays), and bony fishes (including <b>billfishes,</b> tunas, dolphinfishes, jacks, escolars, opahs, and pomfrets). The cookiecutter shark also regularly hunts and eats entire squid with a mantle length of , comparable in size to the shark itself, as well as bristlemouths, copepods, and other prey of more modest dimensions.|$|E
25|$|The beak, bill, or rostrum is an {{external}} anatomical structure of birds {{that is used}} for eating and for preening, manipulating objects, killing prey, fighting, probing for food, courtship and feeding young.

40|$|A {{mail survey}} of 1, 984 U. S. <b>billfish</b> tournament anglers was {{completed}} {{to examine their}} fishing activity, attitudes, trip expenditures, consumer's surplus, catch levels, and management preferences. A sample of 1, 984 anglers was drawn from <b>billfish</b> tournaments in the western Atlantic Ocean (from Maine to Texas, including Puerto Rico and the U. S. Virgin Islands) during 1989. A response rate of 61 % was obtained (excluding nondeliverables). Anglers averaged 13 <b>billfish</b> trips per year, catching a <b>billfish</b> 40 % of the time while 89 % of <b>billfish</b> caught were released with < 1 <b>billfish</b> per year per angler retained. Catch and retention rates varied by region. Expenditures averaged $ 1, 600 per trip, but varied by region. The annual consumer's surplus was $ 262 per angler, but increased to $ 448 per angler if <b>billfish</b> populations were to increase. An estimated 7, 915 tournament anglers in the U. S. western Atlantic spent $ 179, 425, 000 in pursuit of <b>billfish</b> in 1989. Anglers opposed management options that would diminish their ability to catch a <b>billfish,</b> but supported options {{limiting the number of}} <b>billfish</b> landed...|$|R
50|$|<b>Billfish</b> {{normally}} {{use their}} bills to slash at schooling fish. They swim through the fish school at high speed, slashing left and right, and then circle back {{to eat the}} fish they stunned. Adult swordfish have no teeth, and other <b>billfish</b> have only small file-like teeth. They swallow their catch whole, head-first. <b>Billfish</b> don't normally spear with their bills, though occasionally a marlin will flip a fish {{into the air and}} bayonet it. Given the speed and power of these fish, when they do spear things the results can be dramatic. Predators of <b>billfish,</b> such as great white and mako sharks, have been found with <b>billfish</b> spears embedded in them. Pelagic fish generally are fascinated by floating objects, and congregate about them. <b>Billfish</b> can accidentally impale boats and other floating objects when they pursue the small fish that aggregate around them. Care is needed when attempting to land a hooked <b>billfish.</b> Many fisherman have been injured, some seriously, by a <b>billfish</b> thrashing its bill about.|$|R

25|$|Other than {{possibly}} damaging <b>billfishes</b> {{or other}} valued species, the largetooth cookiecutter shark {{is of no}} import to commercial fisheries. All {{but one of the}} known specimens have been caught as bycatch in commercial trawls or longlines. However, given the infrequency of these catches and this species' probable wide distribution, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed it as of Least Concern.|$|E
25|$|Much of {{the catch}} is shrimp and sardines, with about three {{quarters}} exported to the United States. In 2002, the catch totaled 456,805 tons of seafood with a value of about 2,031 million pesos. In addition to what is caught at sea, there is active fish farming which raises mostly oysters and shrimp. Much of the commercial and sports fishing is essentially unregulated and has had a very pronounced impact on the Gulf of California, with commercially important species such as shrimp, groupers, snappers, corvinas, yellowtail, <b>billfishes</b> have been harvested well above sustainability. Two species which have been particularly hard hit are sharks and manta rays. In addition, shrimp trawling catches {{a large amount of}} non target species, which are discarded, and have destroyed large areas of the Gulf’s seafloor. All this has led to rapidly declining harvests.|$|E
500|$|Certain {{species of}} fish {{maintain}} elevated body temperatures. Endothermic teleosts (bony fish) {{are all in the}} suborder Scombroidei and include the <b>billfishes,</b> tunas, and one species of [...] "primitive" [...] mackerel (Gasterochisma melampus). All sharks in the family Lamnidae – shortfin mako, long fin mako, white, porbeagle, and salmon shark – are endothermic, and evidence suggests the trait exists in family Alopiidae (thresher sharks). The degree of endothermy varies from the billfish, which warm only their eyes and brain, to bluefin tuna and porbeagle sharks who maintain body temperatures elevated in excess of 20°C above ambient water temperatures. See also gigantothermy. Endothermy, though metabolically costly, is thought to provide advantages such as increased muscle strength, higher rates of central nervous system processing, and higher rates of digestion.|$|E
40|$|<b>Billfish</b> {{have greater}} value as living targets for non-consumptive, or {{minimally}} consumptive, recreational fisheries {{than they do}} as either directed catch or by-catch species in commercial fleets. The pilot projects seek a Coasian {{solution to this problem}} through private funding mechanisms. The angler sector has a high willingness to pay for access to the <b>billfish</b> resource and the plan is to develop a mechanism to generate self-sustaining private investment in the sustainable management of highly migratory <b>billfish</b> stocks in the areas within and beyond national jurisdictions. These investments will include improved monitoring, control and surveillance as well as investments in education and gear modifications for the small scale fleets that harvest <b>billfish.</b> It is hoped that these investments in <b>billfish</b> friendly gear modifications will pay livelihood dividends through improved catch rates for <b>billfish</b> in the recreational fishery, improved commercial fish quality and access to high value supply chains for harvest other than <b>billfish</b> and reduced congestion and conflict between sectors. It is also hoped that the project will address the increase in fishing capacity brought by an explosion anchored FADs in the region and their use in a new and growing fishery that targets <b>billfish.</b> As the MCS and governance capacity in the region grows, it is hoped that the same types of policies can be expanded to the distant water longline fleets that have substantial <b>billfish</b> bycatch...|$|R
50|$|Most {{recreational}} fishermen now tag {{and release}} <b>billfish.</b> A 2003 study surveyed 317,000 <b>billfish</b> {{known to have}} been tagged and released since 1954. Of these, 4122 were recovered. The study concluded that, while tag and release programs have limitations, they provided important information about <b>billfish</b> that cannot currently be obtained by other methods.|$|R
5000|$|A {{number of}} other fishes have {{pronounced}} bills or beaks, and are {{sometimes referred to as}} <b>billfish.</b> However, they are not true <b>billfish.</b> Halfbeaks look somewhat like miniature <b>billfish,</b> and the sawfish and sawshark, which are cartilaginous fishes with spectacular rostrums shaped like a chain saw. Needlefish are sometimes confused with <b>billfish,</b> but they are [...] "easily distinguished from the true <b>billfish</b> by having both jaws prolonged, the dorsal and anal fins both single and similar in size and shape, and the pelvic fins inserted far behind the pectorals." [...] Paddlefish have elongated rostrums containing electroreceptors that can detect weak electrical fields. Paddlefish are filter feeders and may use their rostrum to detect zooplankton.|$|R
500|$|Fast and energetic, the {{porbeagle}} can {{be found}} singly or in groups. Its fusiform body, narrow caudal peduncle with lateral keels, and crescent-shaped tail are adaptations for efficiently sustaining speed, which have also been independently evolved by tunas, <b>billfishes,</b> and several other groups of active fishes. It and the salmon shark are the thickest-bodied members of their family (length-depth ratio approaching 4.5), and consequently have the stiffest swimming style: they oscillate their tails while holding their bodies mostly rigid, which confers propulsive power with high energy efficiency, but {{at the cost of}} maneuverability. The large gill surface area of the porbeagle allows more oxygen to be delivered to its tissues. It also has a short band of aerobic [...] "red muscle" [...] along each side, which can contract independently of the regular [...] "white muscle" [...] at a lower energy cost, enhancing the shark's stamina.|$|E

50|$|Studies {{have shown}} that circle hooks do less damage to <b>billfish</b> than the {{traditional}} J-hooks, yet they are at just as effective for catching <b>billfish.</b> This is good for conservation, since it improves survival rates after release.|$|R
50|$|<b>Billfish</b> have {{prominent}} dorsal fins. Like tuna, mackerel {{and other}} scombroids, <b>billfish</b> streamline themselves by retracting their dorsal fins into a groove in their body when they swim. The shape, size, position and colour of the dorsal fin {{varies with the}} type of <b>billfish,</b> and can be a simple way to identify a <b>billfish</b> species. For example, the white marlin has a dorsal fin with a curved front edge and is covered with black spots. The huge dorsal fin, or sail of the sailfish is kept retracted most of the time. Sailfish raise them if they want to herd a school of small fish, and also after periods of high activity, presumably to cool down.|$|R

40|$|The long {{historical}} data on sport fishing activities at Playa Grande Yachting Club (PGYC), lo-cated {{in the central}} Venezuelan coast near La Guaira, has served as an index to identify mayor trends in <b>billfish</b> abundance within the North Atlantic Ocean. In 1990, the Venezuelan Govern-ment issued a regulation restricting the landing and commercialization of <b>billfish</b> in a 50 -mile zone around La Guaira, {{in an effort to}} protect <b>billfish</b> populations in this area where sport fishing is particularly intense. The regulation induced misreporting of <b>billfish</b> catches by the sport fishers in PGYC, which lowered the quality of information in the {{historical data}}base after 1990.
