5|$|The <b>Barry</b> <b>Goldwater</b> presidential {{campaign}} of 1964 began when United States Senator <b>Barry</b> <b>Goldwater</b> of Arizona elected {{to seek the}} Republican Party nomination for President of the United States to challenge incumbent Democratic President Lyndon B. Johnson. Early on, before officially announcing his candidacy for the presidency, Goldwater was accused by Governor of New York Nelson Rockefeller of attempting to galvanize Southern and Western Republican support while neglecting the industrial northern states, eventually becoming one of Goldwater's primary opponents {{in the race for}} the Republican Party's nomination in 1964.|$|E
5|$|McCain's Senate {{career began}} in January 1987, after he {{defeated}} his Democratic opponent, former state legislator Richard Kimball, by 20percentage {{points in the}} 1986 election.

5|$|On August 20, Ford {{nominated}} former New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller to {{fill the}} vice presidency he had vacated. Rockefeller's top competitor had been George H. W. Bush. Rockefeller underwent extended hearings before Congress, which caused embarrassment when it was revealed he made large gifts to senior aides, such as Henry Kissinger. Although conservative Republicans were not pleased that Rockefeller was picked, most of them voted for his confirmation, and his nomination passed both the House and Senate. Some, including <b>Barry</b> <b>Goldwater,</b> voted against him.|$|E
5|$|The {{legislation}} {{in its original}} form {{was sponsored by the}} Democratic Party, but after it ran into opposition, it was rescued by the conservative Republican Senator <b>Barry</b> <b>Goldwater.</b> Under Goldwater's sponsorship, a version of the legislation without the commitment provisions that were the target of intense opposition from a variety of far-right, anti-Communist and fringe religious groups was passed by the United States Senate. The controversy still plays a prominent role in the Church of Scientology's account of its campaign against psychiatry.|$|E

5|$|Humphrey {{first entered}} presidential {{politics}} in 1952 {{running as a}} favorite son candidate in Minnesota. In 1960, he mounted a full-scale run, winning primaries in South Dakota and Washington D.C., but ultimately lost the Democratic nomination to future President John F. Kennedy. In 1964, Humphrey was tapped as the running mate of President Lyndon Johnson, {{who went on to}} win in a landslide victory over Republican <b>Barry</b> <b>Goldwater.</b> As Vice President, Humphrey oversaw turbulent times in America, including race riots and growing frustration and anger over the large number of casualties in the Vietnam War. President Johnson's popularity had plummeted as the election grew closer.|$|E
5|$|Editorially, the {{newspaper}} {{remained in the}} liberal Republican camp, both strongly anti-communist and supportive of civil rights. In April, 1963, the Tribune published Martin Luther King's Letter from Birmingham Jail on its front page. The Tribune became a target of <b>Barry</b> <b>Goldwater</b> partisans in the 1964 presidential campaign. The leadership of the Tribune, while agreeing with Goldwater's approach to national defense, believed he pushed it to an extreme, and strongly opposed Goldwater's voting record on civil rights. After some internal debate, the Tribune endorsed Democrat Lyndon Johnson for the presidency that fall. The newspaper also {{played a major role}} in the election of New York City Mayor John Lindsay, a liberal Republican, in 1965.|$|E
5|$|Rodham's {{mother wanted}} her to have an independent, {{professional}} career, and her father, who was otherwise a traditionalist, felt that his daughter's abilities and opportunities should not be limited by gender. Raised in a politically conservative household, Rodham helped canvass Chicago's South Side at age 13 following the very close 1960 U.S. presidential election, where she saw evidence of electoral fraud (such as voting list entries showing addresses that were empty lots) against Republican candidate Richard Nixon. She then volunteered to campaign for Republican candidate <b>Barry</b> <b>Goldwater</b> in the U.S. presidential election of 1964. Rodham's early political development was shaped most by her high school history teacher (like her father, a fervent anti-communist), who introduced her to Goldwater's The Conscience of a Conservative and by her Methodist youth minister (like her mother, concerned with issues of social justice), with whom she saw and afterwards briefly met, civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. at a 1962 speech in Chicago's Orchestra Hall.|$|E
50|$|Hedgecock {{first became}} active in {{politics}} {{at an early}} age, having volunteered to work in US Senator <b>Barry</b> <b>Goldwater's</b> 1964 presidential campaign. In 1976, {{he was elected to}} the San Diego County Board of Supervisors and served until 1983.|$|R

5|$|The Nixon family {{traveled}} to Europe in 1963, where Nixon gave press conferences {{and met with}} leaders of the countries he visited. The family moved to New York City, where Nixon became a senior partner in the leading law firm Nixon, Mudge, Rose, Guthrie & Alexander. Nixon had pledged, when announcing his California campaign, not {{to run for president}} in 1964; even if he had not, he believed {{it would be difficult to}} defeat Kennedy, or after his assassination, Kennedy's successor, Lyndon Johnson. In 1964, he supported Arizona Senator <b>Barry</b> <b>Goldwater</b> for the Republican nomination for president; when Goldwater was successful in gaining the nomination, Nixon was selected to introduce the candidate to the convention. Although he thought Goldwater unlikely to win, Nixon campaigned for him loyally. The election was a disaster for the Republicans; Goldwater's landslide loss to Johnson was matched by heavy losses for the party in Congress and among state governors.|$|E
