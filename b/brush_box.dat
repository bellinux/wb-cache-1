25|$|The flora of Fraser Island is diverse. More than 865 {{species of}} plants thrive on the island. It {{is the only place}} on earth where tall {{rainforest}} grows in sand. The island contains the largest extent of wallum heath remnants in Queensland. In Pile Valley, 1,000-year-old rough-barked satinays are found. Despite being logged the kauri pines dominate in some areas. Scribbly gums, red gums, piccabeen palms, blue quandong, <b>brush</b> <b>box</b> and pandanus all grow on Fraser Island. Along the coast, the foredunes are dominated by salt-tolerant species which includes pigface, goats foot vine and beach spinifex. Spinifex sericeus is an important foundation species. Decayed matter from this dune grass breaks down in the sand, providing vital nutrients for other plant species, such as the beach oak. The rare Angiopteris evecta, a species of fern that has the largest fronds in the world, grows on Fraser Island. The southwest coast is dominated by mangroves. Persoonia prostrata was a shrub native to the island which is now extinct.|$|E

30|$|Experiments {{have shown}} that if proper prior input is provided, most of the {{existing}} interactive methods can yield satisfactory results for natural images. But, providing the proper input is not straightforward (Yang et al. 2010). Quite often, the user, especially a non-expert, has to struggle with a carefully patient editing among all possibly ‘desired’ locations in the image (Rother et al. 2004; Li et al. 2004). If the user fails to provide effective priors, more interactions are required to correct the segmentation. This is a tedious task, and especially difficult when the object and its background have low contrast (Ning et al. 2010), or the object is camouflaged, or there is clutter in the image (Rother et al. 2004). In such cases, despite the interactive input, the segmentation may not always yield the desired output (see Fig. 1). This can be remedied partly by a second tier editing of the initial segmentation results (Li et al. 2004). Another option is to employ multiple types of prior user input, including object and background strokes, soft boundary <b>brushes</b> or <b>boxes,</b> hard edge scribbles, and any combination of these (Rother et al. 2004).|$|R

40|$|The work {{concerns}} the constructive characteristics optimization of brushless D. C. (direct current) motors used in electromechanical spacecraft drives. The spacecraft electromechanical drives and units use rather widely the brushless D. C. motors {{in which a}} motor commutator is replaced with more reliable semiconductor commutator controlled by the rotor position sensors. However, these motors are of low power. Electrohydraulic actuators (EHA) use simple permanent-magnet motors (PMM) of rather high power and commutator motors with graphite brush variable contacts. High reliability of brush motors, and, therefore a reliability of EHA in general, substantially depends {{on the quality of}} motor commutator operation. There are different reasons for a possible impact on the normal motor commutator operation. One of them is brush wear. Sparking brushes and burning commutator bars are possible in case brushes are poorly grinded to fit, brushes cannot freely move true in the <b>brush</b> holder <b>box,</b> and in case an incorrect force to clamp brushes to the commutator is chosen. It is established that drive wear resistance and operability depends on the gas environment composition being under sealed motor housing. In dry nitrogen environment brush wear suddenly raises because of the changing tribological performances of the commutator thus leading to essentially falling isolation resistance and no motor start. It is recommended to fill a space under sealed motor housing with air. Positive experience of operating spacecraft device containers with mobile electromechanical couples allowed us to find that in this case a dew point of filled air must be minus 20 ˚C. The paper offers an electromechanical alternative of design to the electrohydraulic actuators, with a ball-screw gear of the actuation mechanism, possessing a number of advantages. </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{wind power}} {{generation}} is rapidly becoming competitive with {{conventional fossil fuel}} sources and already today is at par with new coal or gas fired power stations. The wind turbine design objectives have changed {{over the past decade}} from being convention-driven to being optimized driven within the operating regime and market environment. The wind turbines are growing in size, designs are progressing from fixedspeed, stall-controlled having drive trains with gearboxes, to become pitch controlled, variable speed and with or without gearboxes. The advancement in power electronics devices further supports the trend toward variable speed turbines. Today, the wind turbines in the market have a variety of innovative concepts, with proven technology for both generators and power electronics interface. However, the increasing penetration of large wind farms into electrical power systems also poses different kind of challenges due to their intermittent nature. This inspires the designers to develop both custom generators and power electronics devices with sophisticated modern control system strategies. Recently, variable-speed permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG) based wind energy conversion systems (WECS) are becoming more attractive in comparison to fixed-speed WECS. In the variable-speed generation system, the wind turbine can be operated at maximum power operating points over a wide speed range by adjusting the shaft speed optimally. Moreover, the use of Permanent Magnet reduces size, and weight of overall WECS, as there is no need of field winding and its excitation system. The absence of rotor winding also reduces heat dissipation in the rotor and hence improves the overall efficiency. This kind of configuration also find special favor for off-shore wind application, where the geared doubly fed induction generator requires regular maintenance due to tearing-wearing in <b>brushes</b> and gear <b>box.</b> To perform maximum power point tracking at different wind speeds, the variable speed operation of PMSG is required. For the variable speed operation of PMSG, generally vector control is preferred as it allows the independent torque and field control just like a simple DC motor control. The vector control of PMSG essentially requires the rotor position and speed information. For this purpose, usually shaft mounted speed and position sensors are used, resulting into additional cost and complexity of the system. In order to eliminate the sensors and their associated problems, a novel adaptive networkbased fuzzy-inference system (ANFIS) architecture is proposed for rotor position and speed estimation over wide range of speed operation. The ANFIS architecture has well known advantages of modeling a highly non-linear system, as it combines the capability of fuzzy reasoning in handling the uncertainties and capability of artificial neural network (ANN) in learning from processes. Thus, the ANFIS is used to develop an adaptive model of variable speed PMSG under highly uncertain operating conditions, which also automatically compensates any variation in parameters such as inductance, resistance etc. An error gradient based dynamic back propagation method has been used for the on-line tuning of ANFIS architecture. In the proposed work a PMSG based WECS is modeled for both isolated and grid connected system. In the isolated WECS operation, a wind-battery hybrid system is presented. The battery energy storage system (BESS) in the isolated system is used to absorb the wind power fluctuations and varying load demand. In grid connected system, the fault ride through capability of WECS is demonstrated under grid voltage sag/swell conditions. Another objective is to develop an advance controller for grid side inverter. Since the inverter works under highly fluctuating operating conditions, {{it is not possible to}} set the optimal value of gains for the conventional proportional-integral (PI) regulator. This may lead to false operation of inverter. To alleviate this problem an adaptive neurofuzzy controller is developed, which has well known advantages in modeling and control of a highly non-linear system. The main objective is to achieve smooth operation of grid side inverter, where the conventional PI controller may fail due to the rapid change in the dynamics of the overall system. The combined capability of neuro-fuzzy controller in handling the uncertainties and learning from the processes is proved to be advantageous while controlling the inverter under fluctuating operating conditions. Moreover, in the proposed work, the grid side inverter rating is also optimally utilized by incorporating the power quality improvement features. Normally, the grid interfacing inverter has very low utilization factor 20 - 30...|$|R
