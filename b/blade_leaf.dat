50|$|Aracha (荒茶), {{also known}} as Unrefined or Crude Tea, {{is a type of}} green tea {{produced}} in Japan. Unlike most other teas, aracha green tea is produced using the entire leaf of the tea plant, including the leaf <b>blade,</b> <b>leaf</b> stem, broken particles of the leaf, and the fine leaf hair. This often gives the tea a deep green colour and a bold taste though variations are greatly affected by the cultivation and production processes.|$|E
50|$|The {{plant is}} a low-growing, tufted, hairless grass, with a {{bunching}} (or tillering) growth habit. The leaves are dark green, smooth and glossy {{on the lower}} surface, with untoothed parallel sides and prominent parallel veins on the upper surface. The leaves are folded lengthwise in bud (unlike the rolled leaves of Italian ryegrass, Lolium multiflorum) with a strong central keel, giving a flattened appearance. The ligule is very short and truncate, often difficult to see, and small white auricles grip the stem {{at the base of}} the leaf <b>blade.</b> <b>Leaf</b> sheaths at the base are usually tinged pink and hairless.

A brief {{review of}} the {{literature}} on the effects of nitrate and ammonium nitrogen sources on plant growth, and the assimilation of those nitrogen sources, has been presented. A water culture technique for the growth of maize was developed. The use of a gravel rooting medium with nutrients recycling through the rooting medium, and an iron supplement in the form of ferric citrate, resulted in superior growth of nitrate-fed plants in comparison to that observed with a hydroponic growth technique and a standard Long Ashton nutrient solution. The effects of nitrogen source on plant growth, organic nitrogen and inorganic nitrogen contents, and the rates of incorporation into nitrogenous compounds were studied. The observed differences were explained with reference to the effects of the various nitrogen sources on the physiology of the plants. The experimental techniques included assays of the enzymes nitrate reductase and glutamine synthetase, whole plant growth studies, and the analysis of nitrogenous compounds of xylem exudate and those extracted from the leaf <b>blade,</b> <b>leaf</b> base, and root regions of maize plants after feeding with a nutrient solution containing nitrogen as 15 N...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to evaluate qualitative and quantitative leaf anatomical traits of Palicourea rigida Kunth. (Rubiaceae) species occurring in the Brazilian Cerrado and Campo Rupestre ecosystems. Anatomical analysis was performed in fresh or fixed leaves processed with usual plant microtechnique. Leaves showed uniseriate epidermis in petiole and leaf blade which contains uniseriate nonglandular tricomes (tector type) occurring only over the vascular bundles. Likewise, paracytic stomata were found only in abaxial side of the leaf surface. The mesophyll contains uniseriate palisade parenchyma and multiseriate spongy parenchyma (nine layers) which showed cells with different morphology and size. Crystal idoblasts of different types were observed in both the petiole and leaf blade. Collateral vascular bundles were found both in the petiole and leaf <b>blade.</b> <b>Leaf</b> venation type was pinnate, campylodromous or brochydodromous.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the chemical composition and ruminal degradability of corn stover in three maize-planting regions in Qiqihaer, Heilongjiang Province, China. The whole stover was separated into seven morphological fractions, i. e., leaf <b>blade,</b> <b>leaf</b> sheath, stem rind, stem pith, stem node, ear husk, and corn tassel. The assessment of nutritive value of corn stover and its fractions was performed based on laboratory assays of the morphological proportions, chemical composition, and in situ degradability of dry matter (DM), neutral detergent fiber (NDF), and acid detergent fiber (ADF). The chemical composition of corn stover was significantly different from plant top to bottom (p< 0. 05). Among the whole corn stover and seven morphological fractions, leaf blade had the highest crude protein (CP) content and the lowest NDF and ADF contents (p< 0. 05), whereas stem rind had the lowest CP content and the highest ADF and acid detergent lignin (ADL) contents (p< 0. 05). Ear husk had significantly higher NDF content and relatively lower ADL content than other corn stover fractions. Overall, the effective degradability of DM, NDF, and ADF in rumen was the highest in leaf blade and stem pith, followed by ear husk. The results indicate that leaf blade, ear husk, and stem pith potentially have higher nutritive values than the other fractions of corn stover.

Bibliography: leaves [71]- 80. vii, 80 l graphs, tablesPeroxidase {{isoenzyme}} polymorphism in maize {{was investigated}} using horizontal starch gel electrophoresis at pH 8. 1. Crude preparations of tissues {{were subjected to}} electrophoresis and the resulting gels were stained with a suitable hydrogen peroxide - hydrogen donor solution to indicate the zones of peroxidase activity. Three hydrogen donors - guaiacol, benzidine, and o-dianisidine were examined. Certain peroxidase isoenzymes did not stain with guaiacol, while all isoenzymes reacted similarly with benzidine or o-dianisidine. O-dianisidine provided stable reaction products and was selected in preference to benzidine for further studies. Thirteen tissues from over 300 different inbred lines, tropical races, and genetic stocks were surveyed to assess the total peroxidase isoenzyme variation within the species. At least 21 different peroxidase isoenzymes, 12 anodal and 9 cathodal, were observed in anyone maize plant. Tissues varied greatly in isoenzyme complement, and certain isoenzymes were tissue specific. The peroxidase isoenzyme patterns of root, leaf <b>blade,</b> <b>leaf</b> sheath, internode, and anther were analyzed at several different stages of growth, and were found to change with growth {{and development of the}} tissue. Roots showed a decrease in peroxidase isoenzymes during maturation while leaf <b>blade,</b> <b>leaf</b> sheath, and internode increased in isoenzyme complexity. This increase in number of isoenzymes in leaf and internode material appeared to be correlated with the cessation of elongation of these tissues. The role of peroxidase with regard to auxin metabolism was discussed. Immature anthers showed more isoenzymes than did mature pollen which possessed a highly unique peroxidase isoenzyme pattern. Five of the peroxidase isoenzyme systems were subjected to genetic analysis and were found to be under control of S different loci designated Px 1, Px 2, Px 3, Px 4, and Px 5. The Pxl peroxidase migrated cathodally and was found in roots and some leafy tissues. Four electrophoretic variants including a null were observed for this system, and genetic analyses carried out on seedling root extracts indicated that each variant was conditioned by one allele of a single locus. The four alleles were designated Px^(1) l, Px^(2) l, Px^(3) l, Px^(null) l. The Pxl locus was determined not to be located on the long arm of Chromosomes III, IV, or X or on the short arm of Chromosomes VII or IX. The Px 2 peroxidase system moved anodally and was found exclusively in pollen following anthesis. It was found to be a product of one locus with 2 alleles, Px^(1) 2 and Px^(2) 2, each conditioning an electrophoretic variant. No null was observed. The Px 3 peroxidase was an anodal multiple band complex found in mature leaf, internode, husk, and root tissue, but stained most intensely in fully elongated tissues. Two isoenzyme patterns were observed, and genetic data from both leaf blade and root tissues indicated that each pattern was under the control of an allele at a single locus. Px 4 and Px 5 peroxidases both migrated cathodally and were found in leaf material. Each comprised a monogenic system with presence - absence alleles. The absence allele was dominant for locus Px 4 while the presence allele was dominant for locus Px 5. There was no evidence of linkage for Px 3, Px 4, and Px 5...|$|E

Transcript of OsNCX 2 was predominantly high in all the tissues, which possibly indicates its important role throughout the plant. OsNCX 12 has uniformly intermediate level of expression in all the plant tissues. Previously, the transcript levels of rice CAX genes i.e. OsCAX 1 a (OsNCX 2), OsCAX 1 b (OsNCX 10), OsCAX 1 c (OsNCX 5), OsCAX 2 (OsNCX 7) and OsCAX 3 (OsNCX 9), were analyzed in several tissues like, embryo, endosperm, shoot, root, flower, leaf <b>blade,</b> <b>leaf</b> sheath, node, internode, root and callus (Kamiya et al. 2005). Expression profile of these genes reported earlier corresponds to our MPSS expression profile. For example, expression of OsNCX 2 (OsCAX 1 a) {{was found to be}} high in all the tissues analyzed by Kamiya et al. (2005), which corresponds to the MPSS data presented in our study. Expression of OsNCX 10 (OsCAX 1 b) was high in case of root (NDR) in MPSS data, which also corresponds to the observations by Kamiya et al. (2005). Expression of OsNCX 5 (OsCAX 1 c) was observed only in case of leaf blade (Kamiya et al. 2005), similarly in MPSS data, its expression was observed in case of leaf only. These observations indicate towards possible function of various NCX genes in different tissues and developmental stages.

40|$|Abstract Background Plant growth {{depends on}} {{synergistic}} interactions between {{internal and external}} signals, and yield potential of crops is a manifestation of how these complex factors interact, particularly at critical stages of development. As an initial step towards developing a systems-level understanding of the biological processes underlying the expression of overall agronomic potential in cereal crops, a high-resolution transcriptome analysis of rice was conducted throughout life cycle of rice grown under natural field conditions. Results A wide range of gene expression profiles based on 48 organs and tissues at various developmental stages identified 731 organ/tissue specific genes as well as 215 growth stage-specific expressed genes universally in leaf <b>blade,</b> <b>leaf</b> sheath, and root. Continuous transcriptome profiling of leaf from transplanting until harvesting further elucidated the growth-stage specificity of gene expression and uncovered two major drastic changes in the leaf transcriptional program. The first major change occurred before the panicle differentiation, accompanied by the expression of RFT 1, a putative florigen gene in long day conditions, and the downregulation of the precursors of two microRNAs. This transcriptome change was also associated with physiological alterations including phosphate-homeostasis state as evident from the behavior of several key regulators such as miR 399. The second major transcriptome change occurred just after flowering, and based on analysis of sterile mutant lines, we further revealed that the formation of strong sink, i. e., a developing grain, is not the major cause but is rather a promoter of this change.

40|$|The {{greening}} of etiolated first <b>leaf</b> <b>blades</b> {{of wheat}} (Triticium aestivum Mercia) seedlings (referred {{to in the}} text as leaf tissue) was studied in relation to tissue age and water stress. Use was made of whole seedlings, excised <b>leaf</b> <b>blades</b> and <b>leaf</b> <b>blade</b> segments. Responses to photoperiodic illumination were measured as changes in the levels of chlorophyll, total soluble protein and nucleic acids (both total and specific fractions). The pattern of greening in the whole seedlings, excised <b>leaf</b> <b>blades</b> and <b>leaf</b> <b>blade</b> segments was essentially the same in 6 and 10 day-old dark-grown tissues, where chlorophyll accumulation followed the age sequence along the leaf. Least chlorophyll accumulated in the tip of leaves of both ages but the older leaves contained less overall pigment than the younger leaves. Patterns of total soluble protein and total nucleic acid accumulation did not reflect the pattern shown by the chlorophyll. Protein accumulated most in the tip region, with nucleic acids being highest in the middle region. Water stress treatment reduced chlorophyll accumulation in <b>leaf</b> <b>blade</b> tissue, particularly in the intact seedlings. Protein levels, however, were more variable and appeared to reflect {{the ability of the}} younger tissue to accumulate this compound as a stress metabolite. Total nucleic acid levels were also elevated under water stress. Again, these effects were most marked on the intact seedlings, implying that an effect on the roots was also involved. The data from polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of RNA fractions showed that the level of chloroplast RNA components was maintained up to 17 days for tissue incubated in the dark {{as well as in the}} light. Severe water stress treatments applied to the roots of whole seedlings resulted in the loss of ribosomal fraction in the leaves. However, this effect was not seen with mild water stress. Kinetin treatments during water stress did not appear to alter the pattern of cell component accumulation although in unstressed material, treatment with this compound enhanced chlorophyll accumulation slightly, especially in the young tissue. This indicates that, at the concentration used, the growth regulator was not able to alleviate the stress condition. The <b>leaf</b> <b>blades</b> of intact seedlings responded in a specific way which was much more pronounced than for excised <b>leaf</b> <b>blades</b> or <b>leaf</b> <b>blade</b> segments. It was concluded that some signalling was involved between the root and shoot tissues during water stress treatments...|$|R

40|$|Ocotea gardneri (Meisn.) Mez é uma espécie arbórea, encontrada no nordeste brasileiro, principalmente nos estados da Paraíba e Pernambuco, conhecida por "louro-branco" e "louro-babão". Neste trabalho realizou-se morfodiagnoses (macroscópica e microscópica) de folhas de O. gardneri, com o objetivo de fornecer subsídios à sua caracterização e identificação. Para a morfologia externa, analisaram-se amostras frescas e conservadas em álcool (70 º), com auxílio de estereomicroscópio, e observações de campo. Realizaram-se secções transversais em lâminas foliares e pecíolos, e seções paradérmicas nas duas faces de lâminas foliares. Ocotea gardneri possui folhas elípticas a oval-elípticas, margem inteira, levemente ondeada, ápice agudo e base arredondada. A lâmina foliar é hipoestomática com estômatos do tipo paracítico; a epiderme é uniestratificada, com células de paredes retas e espessadas; o mesofilo é isobilateral, aqui referido pela primeira vez para uma espécie de Lauraceae, com células e ductos secretores evidentes e feixes vasculares colaterais envolvidos pela bainha esclerenquimática. Este conjunto de caracteres aliado à morfologia foliar, permitiram o estabelecimento de parâmetros que possibilitarão a caracterização de folhas de Ocotea gardneri em testes de autenticidade, bem como auxiliarão em estudos da taxonomia da espécie estudada. Ocotea gardneri (Meisn.) Mez is a tree {{growing in}} the Northeast of Brazil and mainly found in the States of Paraiba and Pernambuco. It is known {{in the region as}} "louro-branco" and "louro-babão". This work was carried out with morphodiagnosis of leaves of O. gardneri for their {{characterization}} and identification. The study of external morphology was carried out with fresh and conserved (alcohol, 70 º) samples with stereomicroscope complemented by field observations. Anatomical studies were done by transversal sections of leaves (blade and petiole), and paradermic sections in two surfaces of blades. The sections were clarified and stained with astrablue and basic fuchsine. The leaves of O. gardneri are elliptic to oval-elliptic, margin entire, slightly wavy, acute at the apex and rounded at the base. The <b>blade</b> <b>leaf</b> is hypostomatic with stomata of the paracytic type; the epidermis is unisseriate with cells of straight and thickened walls; the mesophyll is isobifacial, which is being related {{here for the first time}} for Lauraceae, with secretories cells and ducts and collateral vascular bundles involved by sclerenchymatic shealth. These features allowed the establishment of parameters for characterization of the leaves of Ocotea gardneri, as well as to the taxonomic studies on this species...|$|E
40|$|Cereal {{seeds are}} {{important}} source for food, feed and also provide an industrial raw material. A sound understanding of seed initiation {{and the control}} of early endosperm development will be important for increasing cereal crop yield and improving grain quality using biotechnology. The approach taken in this project {{was to investigate the}} potential application of candidate genes and pathways for manipulating endosperm initiation and development. The candidate system chosen was the FIS class Polycomb group complex since there has been considerable work on the role of this complex in the transcriptional regulation of seed initiation and endosperm cellularization in Arabidopsis. The aims of the work described in this thesis were, first to identify and characterize novel proteins which directly interact with the known PcG members FIE and SWN. These two proteins {{play a key role in}} the regulation of endosperm proliferation in Arabidopsis. The second aim was to identify homologs from rice and Arabidopsis which potentially regulate grain size, weight and composition and to investigate the expression profiles and possible functions of these genes and isolate endosperm-specific promoters. Several novel plant PcG complex proteins from Arabidopsis were identified via yeast two-hybrid (Y 2 H) screens. Several other interacting transcription factors of FIE were identified, including SWN (a. k. a. EZA 1 /SWINGER), AREB 2 (ABA-responsive element binding factor 2), VPL (Viviparous-like) and ICE 2 (Inducer of CBF Expression 2). Interacting partners of SWN were also isolated. These included AtRING-H 2, an E 3 type protein ubiquitin ligase, v-SNARE, and BrD (Bromodomain-containing protein), and a plant PHD finger-containing factor. The expression profile of these genes was studied using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) in a series of Arabidopsis tissues prepared from wild type (WT) plants. Expression of these genes was also studied by using the predicted 5 ’-regulatory sequences of SWN, AtRING-H 2, AREB 2, VPL and ICE 2 fused to GUS reporter gene and stably transformed into Arabidopsis. The expression pattern of each candidate was revealed by GUS assays. Results showed that the VPL promoter was specific to the male gamete, while the AtRING-H 2 promoter was found to be male gametophyte- and seed-specific. In order to elucidate the functions of the key PcG partner SWN and its possible role in the regulation of seed initiation, T-DNA insertion lines were analyzed and gene knockdown constructs were developed. Seed development was disrupted by 50 % in one SWN silencing line via dsRNAi. A preliminary study of the SWN silencing plant was carried out but further characterization is needed to uncover the role of SWN in seed development. Manipulation of endosperm development will be dependent on access to promoters specific to early endosperm development. Arabidopsis END 1, a homolog of a barley endosperm marker gene was characterized in this project. AtEND 1 was identified as a member from Arabidopsis lipid transfer protein family. This gene was specifically expressed in gametophytes and developing seeds during free nuclear division and endosperm cellularization. A number of seed-specific cis-acting elements were identified in the 5 ’-regulatory region of AtEND 1. The promoter-GUS construct was also transformed into canola. A less specific expression pattern was observed in transgenic canola plants. Analyses of the transgenic plants in Arabidopsis and canola are presented. Three rice orthologs at END 1 (OsPR 602, OsPR 9 a and OsPRPI) were identified from database searches. The expression of these genes in rice was analyzed by qRT-PCR. Transcriptional GUS fusion constructs of the predicted promoter regions were transformed into rice and barley. Analyses of transgenic barley and rice plants were performed by using PCR screening, Southern blot hybridization and histological GUS assay. These genes were predominantly expressed in the developing rice endosperm. OsPR 602 and OsPR 9 a showed similar spatial and temporal expression patterns in barley compared to their expressions in rice. Expression analysis found that OsPRPI directed gene expression in the vascular bundles of anthers, hulls and micropylar and chalazal poles of pistil shortly before and after anthesis and the vascular bundles of developing caryopses until 19 days after pollination in rice. There was no GUS expression in barley under the control of OsPRPI. The studies also revealed wounding-induced expression of this gene in the vascular traces of leaf <b>blade,</b> <b>leaf</b> sheath, stem and grains. The induction and expression level of OsPRPI was studied by northern blot analysis and qRT-PCR. These gene promoters will be useful tools in transgene research and in the manipulation of cereal grain yield, quality and tolerance to biotic and abiotic stresses. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|Nitrate reductase (NR) {{activity}} in the flag <b>leaf</b> <b>blade,</b> flag <b>leaf</b> sheath and the shoots below first <b>leaf</b> <b>blade</b> of three cultivars of bean seeds (Lablab purureus L.) limiting the N assimilation was investigated during the grain filling (post anthesis) period. After anthesis NR activities in the flag <b>leaf</b> <b>blade,</b> flag <b>leaf</b> sheath and the shoots below first <b>leaf</b> <b>blade</b> in vitro assayed twice in a week. Activity declined during the period in apparent associating with the senescence of tissues. In contrast, when NR estimates were made by a modified assay in which no exogenous nitrate was supplied, activity was consistently low. This suggested that relatively little nitrate was available for reduction in these tissues although NR enzyme appeared to be there. The cultivars accumulated approximately 85 % of their total reduced N before anthesis. Nitrogen accumulation, when nitrate was induced was substantially greater than the accumulation actually observed. So the results suggested that the minimal accumulation of reductase N after anthesis by the cultivars in this study should not {{be attributed to the}} level of NR enzyme. It might be more a function of a limitation in a process responsible for supplying nitrate to the enzyme...|$|R
