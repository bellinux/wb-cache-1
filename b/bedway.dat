50|$|In 2003, during Ramadan when Gomaa {{was playing}} {{football}} with his friends, Abou Bedway's manager, Ibrahim Abou Sita, {{offered him a}} trial at the club; Gomaa didn't like the idea to join a football club and wanted to play football only as a 'hobby', but {{his family and friends}} convinced him that joining the club may be the start of a great football career. Gomma joined Abou <b>Bedway</b> at the age of 15 and played for the reserve team for only one year, before he moved to Ghazl El Mahalla.|$|E
40|$|This study {{compared}} the personality characteristics of 104 adults diagnosed with atten-tion {{deficit hyperactivity disorder}} (ADHD). Personality features were assessed with the MCMI–II (Millon, 1987). Participants were divided into 4 groups based {{on the presence of}} persisting oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) or other comorbid diagnoses (ADHD only, ADHD–comorbid, ADHD–ODD, ADHD–ODD–comorbid). Significant differ-ences between these groups were present for 9 of the 13 MCMI–II personality scales, resulting in 4 modal personality styles. ADHD-only adults evidenced mild histrionic traits, whereas the ADHD–comorbid group was more often avoidant and dependent in personality style. ADHD–ODD adults showed histrionic, narcissistic, aggressive–sa-distic, and negativistic traits whereas the ADHD–ODD–comorbid group had a combi-nation of avoidant, narcissistic, antisocial, aggressive–sadistic, negativistic, and self-defeating personality features. Implications for treatment are discussed. Many clinical investigators have called for a better understanding of adult symptomology of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and its comorbid disorders (Barkley, 1998; Biederman, Newcorn, & Sprich, 1991; Nadeau, 1995; Robin, Tzelepis, <b>Bedway,</b> Gilroy, & Sparague, 1998). These au-thors and others have documented ADHD as having frequent comorbid diagnoses including mood, anxiety, oppositional defiant, and conduct disorders (Holdnack...|$|E
