5|$|A solar chimney (or thermal chimney, in this context) is {{a passive}} solar {{ventilation}} system {{composed of a}} vertical shaft connecting the interior and exterior of a building. As the chimney warms, the air inside is heated causing an updraft that pulls air through the building. Performance can <b>be</b> <b>improved</b> <b>by</b> using glazing and thermal mass materials {{in a way that}} mimics greenhouses.|$|E
5|$|In 1859, a new {{cultivar}} called 'Student' {{was developed}} by James Buckman at the Royal Agricultural College in England. He back-crossed cultivated plants to wild stock, aiming to demonstrate how native plants could <b>be</b> <b>improved</b> <b>by</b> selective breeding. This experiment was so successful, 'Student' became the major variety in cultivation in the late 19th century.|$|E
5|$|Another {{portion of}} modern VT 14, between East Brookfield and Williamstown center, was to <b>be</b> <b>improved</b> <b>by</b> another turnpike corporation, the Williamstown Center Turnpike, which was {{chartered}} on November 14, 1803. The charter {{provided that the}} road {{be turned over to}} the state after having been in operation for 25 years (later amended to 40 years). The company, however, did not do anything in its first two years of existence and only began laying out the road in 1805.|$|E

5|$|Banksia acanthopoda {{is little}} known in cultivation, {{although}} it has been successfully grown and propagated at The Banksia Farm in Mount Barker, Western Australia, and at the Royal Botanic Gardens in Cranbourne, Melbourne. It is a sprawling and untidy shrub, but its habit can <b>be</b> <b>improved</b> <b>by</b> pruning. Its prominent yellow flower heads appear from July to October in cultivation, and have potential for use in the cut flower industry. It prefers a well-drained soil in full sun or light shade, and will tolerate dry conditions once established. Propagation is by seed; seeds take three to five weeks to germinate, and have a germination rate of 80 to 90 percent.|$|E
5|$|Bradman {{decided that}} his chances for Test {{selection}} would <b>be</b> <b>improved</b> <b>by</b> moving to Sydney for the 1928–29 season, when England were to tour in defence of the Ashes. Initially, he continued working in real estate, but later took a promotions {{job with the}} sporting goods retailer Mick Simmons Ltd. In the first match of the Sheffield Shield season, he scored a century in each innings against Queensland. He followed this with scores of 87 and 132 not out against the England touring team, and was rewarded with selection for the first Test, to be played at Brisbane.|$|E
5|$|Education of {{families}} {{is critical in}} developing strategies for understanding strengths and weaknesses; helping the family to cope improves outcomes in children. Prognosis may <b>be</b> <b>improved</b> <b>by</b> diagnosis {{at a younger age}} that allows for early interventions, while interventions in adulthood are valuable but less beneficial. There are legal implications for individuals with AS as they run the risk of exploitation by others and may be unable to comprehend the societal implications of their actions.|$|E

5|$|In 1902, the {{commission}} submitted a threefold plan of {{proposal to the}} government. First, the immediate dangers should be avoided by resetting the corners, removing stones that endangered the adjacent parts, strengthening the first balustrades and restoring several niches, archways, stupas and the main dome. Second, after fencing off the courtyards, proper maintenance should be provided and drainage should <b>be</b> <b>improved</b> <b>by</b> restoring floors and spouts. Third, all loose stones should be removed, the monument cleared {{up to the first}} balustrades, disfigured stones removed and the main dome restored. The total cost was estimated at that time around 48,800 Dutch guilders.|$|E
5|$|Obesity {{is mostly}} {{preventable}} {{through a combination}} of social changes and personal choices. Changes to diet and exercising are the main treatments. Diet quality can <b>be</b> <b>improved</b> <b>by</b> reducing the consumption of energy-dense foods, such as those high in fat and sugars, and by increasing the intake of dietary fiber. Medications may be used, along with a suitable diet, to reduce appetite or decrease fat absorption. If diet, exercise, and medication are not effective, a gastric balloon or surgery may be performed to reduce stomach volume or length of the intestines, leading to feeling full earlier or a reduced ability to absorb nutrients from food.|$|E
5|$|Initial {{management}} with non–medication based treatments is recommended. NSAIDs {{are recommended}} {{if these are}} not sufficiently effective. Normal activity should be continued {{as much as the}} pain allows. Medications are recommended for the duration that they are helpful. A number of other options are available {{for those who do not}} improve with usual treatment. Opioids may be useful if simple pain medications are not enough, but they are not generally recommended due to side effects. Surgery may be beneficial for those with disc-related chronic pain and disability or spinal stenosis. No clear benefit has been found for other cases of non-specific low back pain. Low back pain often affects mood, which may <b>be</b> <b>improved</b> <b>by</b> counseling or antidepressants. Additionally, there are many alternative medicine therapies, including the Alexander technique and herbal remedies, but there is not enough evidence to recommend them confidently. The evidence for chiropractic care and spinal manipulation is mixed.|$|E

5|$|Though {{breeding}} can <b>be</b> <b>improved</b> <b>by</b> supplementary feeding, {{the survival}} of young kakapo is hampered {{by the presence of}} Polynesian rats. Of 21 chicks that hatched between 1981 and 1994, nine were either killed by rats or died and were subsequently eaten by rats. Nest protection has been intensified since 1995 by using traps and poison stations as soon as a nest had been detected. A small video camera and infra-red light source watch the nest continuously, and will scare approaching rats with flashing lights and loud popping sounds. To increase the success rate of nesting, a nest watcher places a small thermostatically controlled electric blanket over the eggs or chicks, whenever the female leaves the nest for food. The survival rate of chicks has increased from 29% in unprotected nests to 75% in protected ones.|$|E
5|$|With this {{contribution}} of von Neumann, the axiomatic {{system of the}} theory of sets avoided the contradictions of earlier systems, and became usable as a foundation for mathematics, despite the lack of a proof of its consistency. The next question was whether it provided definitive answers to all mathematical questions that could be posed in it, or whether it might <b>be</b> <b>improved</b> <b>by</b> adding stronger axioms {{that could be used to}} prove a broader class of theorems. A strongly negative answer to whether it was definitive arrived in September 1930 at the historic mathematical Congress of Königsberg, in which Kurt Gödel announced his first theorem of incompleteness: the usual axiomatic systems are incomplete, in the sense that they cannot prove every truth which is expressible in their language. Moreover, every consistent extension of these systems would necessarily remain incomplete.|$|E

50|$|Different {{methods have}} {{different}} location errors and advantages. Accuracy of microseismic event mapping {{is dependent on}} the signal-to-noise ratio and the distribution of sensors. Accuracy of events located <b>by</b> seismic inversion <b>is</b> <b>improved</b> <b>by</b> sensors placed in multiple azimuths from the monitored borehole. In a downhole array location, accuracy of events <b>is</b> <b>improved</b> <b>by</b> being close to the monitored borehole (high signal-to-noise ratio).|$|R

40|$|Proteins {{extracted}} from defatted oats were chemically modified by acylation (succinylation and acetylation), potassium linoleate treatment or partial hydrolysis with trypsin. Total {{essential amino acid}} content was slightly lowered by acetylation, but unaffected by succinylation. Gel filtration chromatography showed some dissociation of oat polypeptides by succinylation, while trypsin hydrolysis caused considerable breakdown of the protein. Solubility and emulsifying properties <b>were</b> significantly <b>improved</b> <b>by</b> all the modifications. Fat binding capacity <b>was</b> <b>improved</b> <b>by</b> acylation and linoleate treatment, while water hydration capacity and foaming properties <b>were</b> <b>improved</b> <b>by</b> trypsin and linoleate modifications. The gelling property <b>was</b> <b>improved</b> <b>by</b> acylation. When meat protein was substituted with oat protein in model wieners, there was a decrease in cook yield, cohesiveness and firmness. However, {{when compared to the}} unmodified oat protein, succinylation led to an improvement in performance in an emulsified meat system. © 1987 AOCS Press. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
