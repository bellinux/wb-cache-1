500|$|The senior {{officers}} attempt to plead with Picard {{to undergo a}} medical examination and to step down from command, but he refuses. When they return to the cloud, Picard announces that they had picked up an entity previously when they passed the cloud, and now Picard and the entity are one. Under its influence, Picard plans to transport himself back into the cloud, and he shoots energy at the bridge crew {{when they try to}} stop him. The crew are unable to prevent Picard from <b>beaming</b> <b>off</b> the ship. The crew spend hours trying to locate Picard to no avail, so they are forced to accept he is beyond recovery and prepare to leave. [...] However, Troi senses the Captain's essence nearby, and Picard manages to signal the crew through the ship's computers. Data is able to reverse the transport, reconstituting Picard without the entity. After determining that Picard is himself again, lacking the memories since he was taken over by the entity, the Enterprise continues on to Parliament.|$|E

40|$|In gated radiotherapy, the {{accuracy}} of treatment delivery is determined by {{the accuracy}} with which both the imaging and treatment beams are gated. Time delays are of four types: (1) beam on imaging time delay is the time between the target entering the gated region and the first gated image acquisition; (2) <b>beam</b> <b>off</b> imaging time delay is the time between the target exiting a gated region and the last image acquisition; (3) beam on treatment time delay is the time between the target entering the gated region and the treatment beam on; and (4) <b>beam</b> <b>off</b> treatment time delay is the time between the target exiting the gated region and treatment <b>beam</b> <b>off.</b> Asynchronous time delays for the imaging and treatment systems may increase the required internal target volume (ITV) margin. We measured time delay on three fluoroscopy systems, and three linear accelerator treatment beams, varying gating type (amplitude vs. phase), beam energy, dose rate, and period. The average beam on imaging time delays were- 0. 04 ± 0. 05 sec (amplitude, 1 SD),- 0. 11 ± 0. 04 sec (phase); while the average <b>beam</b> <b>off</b> imaging time delays were- 0. 18 ± 0. 08 sec (amplitude) and- 0. 15 ± 0. 04 sec (phase). The average beam on treatment time delays were + 0. 09 ± 0. 02 sec (amplitude, 1 SD), + 0. 10 ± 0. 03 sec (phase); while the average <b>beam</b> <b>off</b> time delays for treatment beams were + 0. 08 ± 0. 02 sec (amplitude) and + 0. 07 ± 0. 02 sec (phase). The negative value indicates the images were acquired early, and the positive values show the treatment beam was triggered late. We present a technique for calculating the margin necessary to account for time delays. We found that the difference between these imaging and treatment time delays required {{a significant increase in the}} ITV margin in the direction of tumor motion at the gated level.
