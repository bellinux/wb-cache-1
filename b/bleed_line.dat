When the fuel tank fill point is reached, a <b>bleed</b> <b>line</b> signal is closed and back pressure is applied to a diaphragm valve at the fuel entry point. Due to differential pressure and an internal spring, the diaphragm is forced closed and cannot be overfilled.

We {{have noted that}} staple <b>line</b> <b>bleeding</b> is a contributory factor to postoperative morbidity. MethodsThis was a retrospective analysis of the clinical records of consecutive stapled haemorrhoidectomy procedures performed in patients over a 1 -year period. The outpatient, operative and inpatient records were reviewed. We assessed the incidence of intraoperative staple <b>line</b> <b>bleeding,</b> its management and early postoperative outcomes in our patients undergoing stapled haemorrhoidectomy. ResultsFrom March 2000 to March 2001, 39 stapled haemorrhoidectomy procedures were performed. Intraoperative staple <b>line</b> <b>bleeding</b> was recorded in 17 patients (44 %) and suture reinforcement of this staple line was required in 12 (31 %).

The MARVIN mission is {{designed}} to collect samples of the Martian environment; to produce fuel from local Martian resources; {{and to use the}} fuel produced to return the samples to earth. It uses only existing technologies. Exploratory Technologies' mission-design efforts have focused on methods of orbit determination, sample collection, fuel production, power, communications, control, and structural design. Lambert Targeting provided Delta-V's, launch dates, and travel times. The landing site is the Tharsis Plateau, to the southeast of Olympus Mons, chosen for its substantial scientific value. Samples of soil, dust, and atmosphere are collected with lander-based collection devices: the soil sample, with a robotic arm similar to those used in the Viking missions; the atmospheric sample, from a <b>bleed</b> <b>line</b> to the compressor in the fuel-production facility; a dust sample, from the dust-collection container in the fuel-production facility; and a redundant dust sample, with a with a passive filter system, which relies upon neither a power source nor other collection methods. The sample-return capsule (SRC) houses these samples, which are triply contained to prevent contamination. Proven technology can be used to produce methane and oxygen for fuel with relative ease at the landing site: the Sabatier reactor produces methane and water by combining carbon dioxide and hydrogen (brought from earth); the Reverse Water-Gas Shift unit combines carbon dioxide and hydrogen to form carbon monoxide and water; a water-electrolysis unit splits the water into hydrogen and oxygen. The Mars-lander vehicle (MLV) transports the equipment from earth to Mars. The Mars-ascent vehicle (MAV) contains the SRC and the engine, which is the same for both the MLV and the MAV. All equipment that is unnecessary for the Mars-Earth trajectory remains on Mars. This report presents detailed sizing information, for which a spreadsheet has been developed.

40|$|This paper shows {{experimental}} results {{obtained from a}} T 100 microturbine connected with different volume sizes. The activity was carried out with the test rig developed at the University of Genoa for hybrid system emulation. However, these results apply to all the advanced cycles where a microturbine is connected with an additional external component responsible for volume size increase. Even if the tests were performed with a microturbine (for laboratory scale and for the related research interest in innovative cycles), similar analyses can be extended to on large size turbines. The main power systems including the effect of an additional volume connected with a turbine are: fuel cell based hybrid plants, humid cycles, externally fired layouts and innovative systems including high temperature thermal storage devices. Since {{in this case a}} 100 kW turbine was used, the volume was located between the recuperator outlet and the combustor inlet as in the typical cases related to small size plants. A modular vessel was used to perform and to compare the tests with different volume sizes. To highlight the volume size effect, preliminary {{experimental results}} were carried out considering the transient response due to an on/off bleed valve operation. So, the main differences between system parameters obtained for a <b>bleed</b> <b>line</b> closing operation are compared considering three different volume sizes. The main results reported in this paper are related to surge operations. This analysis was carried out to extend the knowledge about this risk condition: the systems equipped with large volume size connected with the machine present critical issues related to surge prevention especially during transient operations. For instance, if the T 100 machine is operating with large volume components, the standard shutdown procedure can produce surge condition. This behavior is due to a slow depressurization rate in comparison with a standard microturbine. So, to produce surge conditions in this test rig, a valve operating in the main air path was closed to generate unstable behavior. It was possible to compare the effect of different volume sizes on main properties of the system using a modular vessel. Particular focus was devoted to the operational curve plotted on the compressor map. The system was equipped with different dynamic probes to measure the vibrations during normal and surge operations. The frequency analysis showed significant vibration increase not only during surge events but also close to the unstable condition. In details, possible surge precursor indicators were obtained to be used for the detection of risky machine operations. Since these surge precursors are considered important parameters for the control system point of view, an extensive experimental analysis was carried out considering the influence of volume size. These precursors were defined to produce control data (e. g. an on/off signal for a bleed valve) for surge prevention. The experimental data collected during these tests are analyzed with the objective of designing control systems to prevent surge conditions...|$|E

40|$|Background The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to assess whether the use of staple line reinforcement (SLR) reduces staple line complications (SLC). Mechanical staple lines are essential for gastrointestinal surgery such as bariatric surgery. However, SLC, such as bleeding and leakage, still occur. The purposes of this study were to provide quantitative evidence on the relative efficacy of gastric SLR and to compare the rates of effectiveness of three commonly used methods. Methods A search of the medical literature in English lan-guage journals identified studies from Jan 1, 2000, to Dec 31, 2013, using the following reinforcement types: (1) no reinforcement, (2) oversewing, (3) a biocompatible glycolide copolymer, and (4) bovine pericardium after gastric bypasses and sleeve gastrectomies. Types of reinforcement were compared using a random-effects model. Results This meta-analysis reviewed 16, 967 articles, extracting data on 56, 309 patients concerning leak and 41, 864 patients concerning bleeding. Over 40 % of patients had no reinforcement, resulting in the highest leak rate (2. 75 %) and bleed rate (3. 45 %). Overall, reinforcing with bovine peri-cardium had the lowest leak (1. 28 %) and bleed (1. 23 %) rates. Suture oversewing was better than no reinforcement but not as effective as bovine pericardium for leak (2. 45 %) and bleed (2. 69 %) rates. Buttressing with a biocompatible glycolide copolymer resulted in the second highest leak rate (2. 61 %) and a bleed rate of 2. 48 % but had significantly lower bleed rates than no reinforcement. Conclusions SLR provided superior results for patients com-pared to no reinforcement for reducing SLC. Buttressing with bovine pericardium resulted in the most favorable outcomes. The effectiveness of different methods used to reinforce the staple line in gastric surgery does not appear to be equal. Keywords Staple lines. Staple line leak.

30|$|ECMO lines (i.e. cannulas and {{associated}} tubing) are {{key components of}} the extracorporeal circuit but {{are associated with a}} large number of the causes of morbidity. Effective securement of these lines to a surface, such as the patient’s limb, is necessary to prevent line movement, malposition or kinking that can precipitate obstruction, low circuit flow and poor venous return, all of which compromise the effectiveness of support [14]. Additionally, incorrectly positioned cannulas lead to turbulent blood flow and cannula ‘kicking’, thereby increasing the risk of haemolysis and renal dysfunction [15]. More serious complications involve partial or complete cannula dislodgement with resultant rapid loss of ECMO support, air entrainment or catastrophic <b>bleeding</b> [16]. <b>Line</b> movement may also lead to local infection and bloodstream infection by facilitating cannula micromotion with the entry of skin-borne organisms through the insertion site or along the cannula into the bloodstream, as occurs with smaller intravascular catheters [17, 18]. Routine removal or re-siting of contaminated ECMO lines is not feasible and may be dangerous to the patient [19], and the clinician is sometimes forced into the scenario of premature termination of ECMO support due to cannula site infection. Therefore, adequate securement is paramount in preventing line complications and maintaining ECMO support for its intended duration.|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: This {{prospective}} {{study was conducted}} to compare the clinical outcomes of a 6 -row 3 -D linear cutter with the standard 4 -row linear cutter in patients who underwent elective gastrointestinal surgery anastomosis. METHOD: Patients who underwent elective open gastrointestinal surgery that included stapled anastomosis using a linear cutter (Proximate®, Ethicon Endo-Surgery, Cincinnati, OH) between January 2011 and May 2011 were included in the study. The patients were randomly assigned to two groups according to the linear cutter that was used in the surgery: the standard 4 -row cutter (the S group) or the new 6 -row cutter (the N group). The groups were compared based on the patient demographic data, the laboratory parameters, the preoperative diagnosis, the surgery performed, the operation time, intra-or postoperative complications, the time to oral tolerance and the length of the hospital stay. RESULTS: The S group included 11 male and nine female patients {{with a mean age of}} 65 ± 12 (35 - 84) years, while the N group included 13 male and eight female patients with a mean age of 62 ± 11 (46 - 79) years (p = 0. 448, p = 0. 443, respectively). Anastomotic <b>line</b> <b>bleeding</b> was observed in eight (40 %) patients in the S group and in one (4. 7 %) patient in the N group (p = 0. 006). Dehiscence of the anastomosis line was observed in two (10 %) patients in the S group and none in the N group (p = 0. 131). Anastomotic leakage developed in three (15 %) patients in the S group and in one (4. 7 %) patient in the N group (p = 0. 269).

40|$|Gastrointestinal resections and anastomoses are {{commonly}} performed using stapling devices {{in a wide}} range of open and laparoscopic procedures. Whether they are hand-sewn or stapled, anastomoses have an associated leak rate that can impart significant morbidity or mortality to a procedure. In addition, <b>bleeding</b> from staple <b>lines</b> can cause additional complications. Staple line reinforcement is one intervention that has been postulated to reduce both the leak rate and associated bleeding risk. This can be accomplished with either material applied exogenously to the staple line, as in an engineered absorbable biomaterial, or it may use a material - either absorbable or nonabsorbable - that is incorporated into the staple line. A number of reinforcements are currently available but all add time and cost to the procedures in which they are used.

Agents available for clinical use are: the physiologic tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) and urokinase-type plasminogen activator (u-PA) [...] either in a single chain (scu-PA, prourokinase) or a two-chain (tcu-PA, urokinase) form, and the bacterial activator plasminogen streptokinase or its anisoylated complex with plasminogen (APSAC). Despite their widespread use, mainly in patients with acute myocardial infarction, all these agents suffer {{from a number of}} significant limitations, including resistance to reperfusion, the occurrence of acute coronary reocclusion and <b>bleeding</b> complications. Several <b>lines</b> of research towards improvement of thrombolytic agents are being explored, including the construction of mutants and variants of plasminogen activators, chimeric plasminogen activators, or plasminogen activators from animal (e. g. vampire bat) or bacterial (e. g. staphylokinase) origin. Pilot studies in patients with acute myocardial infarction have been performed with a few selected agents. Definition of their relative therapeutic benefit, or lack thereof, will require more detailed dose-finding studies, followed by randomized clinical trials against presently available thrombolytic agents. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Objectives:To {{determine}} whether topical fibrin sealant reduced suture <b>line</b> <b>bleeding</b> during carotid endarterectomy with polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) patch closure. Design:Prospective randomised non-blinded control trial. Setting:Regional vascular surgery unit. Materials:Seventeen patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy were randomised either to receive fibrin sealant as a topical haemostatic agent at the arteriotomy suture line or {{to act as}} control. Outcome measures:Time taken to achieve haemostasis at the suture line. Intraoperative blood loss. Total operative time. Results:The median time to achieve haemostasis was 5. 5 min (range 4 – 31 min) in the treatment group and 19 min (range 10 – 47 min) {{in the control group}}. This difference was statistically significant p < 0. 005 by Mann-Whitney test. There was no statistical difference in total operative time. Operative blood loss was lower in the treatment group (median 420 ml, range 300 – 500 ml) than in the control group (median 550 ml, range 350 – 1200 ml) but this difference was not statistically significant. One patient in the control group suffered a perioperative thrombo-embolic event. Conclusion:Fibrin sealant is an effective topical haemostatic agent for arteriotomy suture lines involving PTFE material...|$|R
