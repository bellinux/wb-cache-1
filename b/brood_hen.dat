40|$|Feather pecking and {{cannibalism}} {{are major}} welfare problems in commercial laying hen husbandry. Breed differences in feather pecking indicate a genetic component. Further, early-life conditions {{play an important}} role in the development of these behaviors. A selection experiment was initiated selecting on low mortality in group housing for four generations. This resulted in a low mortality line (LML) and an unselected control line (CTL). Previous studies have shown that chickens from the low mortality line show a number of behavioral and physiological differences compared with their control counterparts, including altered whole-blood serotonin levels, plasma corticosterone levels and open field behavior. Here, behavioral differences between selection lines were investigated further and it was tested whether interactions between genetic selection and maternal care determined on mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) levels, which could have implications for sociality, fearfulness and thus welfare. Brains from the second generation of LML and CTL, reared either with or without maternal care, were collected at 40 weeks of age and immunocytochemically stained for MR. No differences were seen between selection lines in MR receptor expression. <b>Brooding</b> <b>hen</b> presence lead to MR lateralization in the nidopallium caudolaterale + posteriosis amydalopallii, and tended to increased MR levels in the left hemisphere in the nidopallium caudolaterale + posteriosis amydalopallii. No differences were seen in the hippocampus. At 1 - 4 weeks of age, behavior of fourth generation LML birds and CTL birds was studied in an open-field test, T-maze test, holeboard test and in a voluntary approach test. No line differences in sociality and fearfulness were found in the open-field test. The holeboard tests revealed no line differences in working memory and reference memory. T-maze results showed increased sociality at 12 - 16 days of age: the LML spent more time with conspecifics (LML: 181 ± 38 s; CTL: 0 ± 0 s) in the T-maze and showed a learning curve in time needed to find conspecifics in the T-maze (p< 0. 001 for cubic trend), whereas the control line did not show any learning. At 26 days the LML were less fearful as they had a shorter latency to approach a familiar human in the voluntary approach test [LML: (mean ± standard error of the mean) 17 ± 6 s CTR: 84 ± 14 s].

40|$|Survival of breeding-age hens {{has been}} {{identified}} as the demographic rate with the greatest potential to influence population growth of Greater Sage-Grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus (Bonaparte, 1827); hereafter “Sage-Grouse”). During 2008 – 2011, we collected summer survival data from 427 Sage-Grouse hens in southern Wyoming, USA. We assessed the effects of raptor densities, anthropogenic features, landscape features, and Sage-Grouse hen behavior on Sage-Grouse hen survival. Survival of Sage-Grouse hens was positively associated with the proportion of big sagebrush (genus Artemisia L.) habitat within 0. 27 km radius and road density and negatively associated with power-line density, proximity to forested habitat, and topographic ruggedness index within 0. 27 km radius (TRI 0. 27). Raptor densities did not have individual effects on Sage-Grouse survival; however, an interaction between site-specific exposure to Golden Eagle (Aquila chrysaetos (L., 1758)) density (GOEA) and TRI 0. 27 indicated that negative effects of GOEA and TRI 0. 27 were dampened in areas with both high TRI 0. 27 and high GOEA. Survival of nonreproductive hens was greater than <b>brooding</b> or nesting <b>hens.</b> Hens that stayed in intermediate-size flocks and yearling hens had higher survival than hens in small or large flocks and hens 3 ̆e 2 years old. Results indicated that risk of death for Sage-Grouse hens was greater relative to potential raptor perches but not anthropogenic and landscape variables that could provide food subsidies for predators...|$|R
5000|$|One {{poor man}} whom I visited, had before his door a small pit of water, about three yards long and one yard broad: at two corners of this pit are places of {{shelter for the}} ducks, {{thatched}} with straw: at night the ducks are taken into a house. In one room belonging to this man (the only room he had to live in), were ducks of three growths, on the 14th of January, 1808, fattening for London market: at one corner about seventeen or eighteen four weeks old; at another corner a brood a fortnight old; and at a third corner a brood a week old. In the bed-room were <b>hens</b> <b>brooding</b> ducks' eggs in boxes, to be bought off at different periods. The Rev. Richard Parkinson St. John Priest, Secretary to the Norfolk Agricultural Society, reporting on Aylesbury to the Board of Agriculture and Internal Improvement, 1813 The Duck End {{was one of the}} poorer districts of Aylesbury. Until the end of the 19th century it had no sewers or refuse collections. The area had a number of open ditches filled with stagnant water, and outbreaks of malaria and cholera were common. The cottages had inadequate ventilation and lighting, and no running water. Faeces from the duck ponds permeated the local soil and seeped into the cottages through cracks in the floors.|$|R

An {{understanding of how}} species responds to urbanization is important for conservation and management of possible human-wildlife conflicts. Wild turkeys (Meleagris gallopavo) have recently successfully entered many urban landscapes, however their apparent success remain poorly understood. Most studies of wild turkeys have occurred in forested or agricultural landscapes. I estimated several important demographic, home range, and habitat use behaviors for wild turkey in areas of varying degrees of urbanization in the Minneapolis-St. Paul, Minnesota, USA, metropolitan area. My research objectives centered on providing the first information on urban wild turkey ecology, including: 1) assessing urban wild turkey nesting behavior and possible changes to reproductive measures, 2) investigation of urban wild turkey survival {{and the influence of}} local mortality agents, and 3) assessing urban wild turkey home range characteristics and habitat use. I captured and equipped 60 female wild turkeys with back-pack style VHF radio transmitters during 2010 - 2013. Monitored female wild turkey reproductive measures and nest survival were remarkably similar both among my study areas and previous rural wild turkey research. For all monitored females across all study areas and years, first nesting rate was 73. 7 % (n = 57), average date of onset of incubation was 2 May (n = 42), and hatch rate was 84 % (n = 26). For all monitored females across all study areas and years mean clutch size was 10. 2 (n = 42), and differed by study area (÷ 2 = 8. 30, DF = 2, P = 0. 02). For all monitored females across all study areas and years nest survival rate was 0. 56 (n = 42). Monitored nests tended to have high visual concealment at the nest bowl, with a strong trend for habitat variables related to vegetative density and height at the nest bowl scale, and distance to open water on the greater landscape. Across all study areas and all female wild turkeys in 2010 - 2013 the annual survival rate was 0. 43 (CI = 0. 32 - 0. 58; n = 55). Across all study areas and all female wild turkeys in 2010 - 2013, seasonal survival rates were as follows: 1) spring survival rate was 0. 61 (CI = 0. 50 - 0. 75; n = 55); 2) summer survival rate was 0. 83 (CI = 0. 71 - 0. 96; n = 34); 3) autumn survival rate was 0. 89 (CI = 0. 75 - 0. 99; n = 28); and 4) winter survival rate of 0. 96 (CI = 0. 89 - 1. 0; n = 25). During the brooding seasons of 2010 through 2012, an estimated 216 poults successfully hatched. Combined poult survival rate to 2 weeks post-hatch was 0. 35, declining to 0. 26 4 -weeks post-hatch. Overall, mammalian and avian predation accounted for 63. 3 % of all observed female mortalities, followed by vehicle strikes (23. 3 %), harvest (3. 3 %), and unknown causes (10. 0 %). Predation remained the leading cause of mortality regardless of age-class, although predation tended to be higher in female adults (61. 5 %) than juveniles (47. 1 %). Across all study areas and all female wild turkeys, average annual home range size was 41. 3 ha (n = 28). Annual home range size for suburban females (64. 5 ha, n = 9) was larger than rural (38. 0 ha, n = 11) or urban females (19. 6 ha, n = 8), with home range size differing between study areas (÷ 2 = 12. 26, DF = 2, P = 0. 002). Spring/summer home ranges included both females that attempted to nest, <b>brooding</b> <b>hens,</b> and non-reproductively active females. Across all study areas and all female wild turkeys, average spring/summer home range size was 26. 4 ha (n = 37). Spring/summer home range size for suburban (44. 8 ha, n = 11), rural (23. 0 ha, n = 17), and urban females (10. 3 ha, n = 9) did not differ. Across all study areas and all female wild turkeys average autumn/winter home range size was 25. 1 ha (n = 28). Autumn/winter home range size for suburban (30. 9 ha, n = 9), rural (28. 6 ha, n = 11), and urban females (13. 8 ha, n = 8) did not differ. Habitat use by wild turkey populations in urban settings relied heavily on `natural-like' habitat, as well as on developed, human-dominated areas. For this study `natural-like' habitat (i. e., parkland, conifer tree) was predictive of spring/summer habitat use and developed habitat (i. e., residential areas, agricultural) was predictive of autumn/winter habitat use. These range shifts are likely linked to resource availability and specific habitat availability (i. e., nesting and brood habitats) ...|$|R
