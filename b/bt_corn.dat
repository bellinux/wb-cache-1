The wise use of crop genetic diversity in plant breeding and genetic modification can also {{contribute significantly to}} protecting the biodiversity in crops. Crop varieties can be genetically modified to resist specific pests and diseases. For example, a gene from the soil bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) produces a natural insecticide toxin. Genes from Bt can be inserted into crop plants to make them capable of producing an insecticidal toxin and therefore a resistance to certain pests. <b>Bt</b> <b>corn</b> (maize) can however adversely affect non-target insects {{closely related to the}} target pest, as with the monarch butterfly.|$|E

In response to salinity stress, a group of polypeptide (76. 96, 59. 38, 41. 56, 33. 5 and 31. 26 KDa) were newly synthesized in both non-transformed and Bt transgenic plants.

The primary insect pest in all locations during the trial years was Heliocoverpa zea (Boddie), which is becoming the most serious insect pest of sweet corn in the United States. At harvest, the ears were measured for marketability according to fresh market and processing standards. For fresh market and processing, least squares regression showed significant effects of protein expression, state, and insecticide frequency. There was a significant effect of year for fresh market but not for processing. The model also showed significant effects of H. zea per ear by protein expression. Sweet corn containing two genes (Cry 1 A. 105 + Cry 2 Ab 2) and a single gene (Cry 1 Ab) provided high marketability, and both Bt varieties significantly outperformed the traditional non-Bt isolines in nearly all cases regardless of insecticide application frequency. For pest suppression of H. zea, plants expressing Bt proteins consistently performed better than non-Bt isoline plants, even those sprayed at conventional insecticide frequencies. Where comparisons in the same state were made between Cry 1 A. 105 + Cry 2 Ab 2 and Cry 1 Ab plants for fresh market, the product expressing Cry 1 A. 105 + Cry 2 Ab 2 provided better protection and resulted in less variability in control. Overall, these results indicate Cry 1 A. 105 + Cry 2 Ab 2 and Cry 1 Ab plants are suitable for fresh market and processing corn production across a diversity of growing regions and years.

Field studies {{were conducted to}} assess tritrophic level effects of insecticide treated and untreated Bt and non-Bt sweet corn hybrids on the abundances, species diversity and functional processes of foliage-dwelling, aerial and soil surface arthropods. The diversity and abundance of decomposers, predators and parasitoids were determined by plant inspections, sticky card, and pitfall trap sampling for two years at two Maryland locations. Functional processes including predation, parasitism, reproduction and colonization were evaluated at one location over three years. Predation rates were estimated from sentinel egg masses of a lepidopteran; levels of parasitism were measured from naturally-occurring chrysopid eggs; emergence traps determined the recruitment rates of arthropods emerging from soil-litter; and litterbags measured arthropod colonization and litter degradation rates. Beneficial arthropod communities and functional processes were not significantly affected by exposure to <b>Bt</b> sweet <b>corn.</b> Insecticides significantly reduced arthropod diversity and abundance {{as well as the}} rate of predation, parasitism, colonization and recruitment of organisms. Less disruption occurred in Bt plots treated once than compared with non-Bt plots treated five times.

A second aspect of the ecological risk assessment focused on laboratory and field studies to evaluate the effects of Bt pollen on honey bee survival, brood development and foraging behavior.

Laboratory tests showed no effects of feeding on Bt pollen on survival or hypopharyngeal gland development measured indirectly by head weight gain of newly-emerged bees. In field studies conducted for two years at three locations, colonies foraging in sweet corn plots and fed Bt pollen cakes for 28 days showed no adverse effects on bee weight, hive strength, brood development and foraging behavior.
