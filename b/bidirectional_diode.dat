Setup a <b>bidirectional</b> <b>diode</b> circuit model as a stochastic system to perform the analysis method. The work done here is very useful for the related subjects such as material analysis, signal processing and system analysis, or linear system design...|$|E
40|$|International audienceHigh {{reliability}} {{electronic devices}} need to sustain thousands of electrostatic discharge (ESD) stresses during their lifetime. In this paper, it is demonstrated that repetitive ESD stresses on a protection device {{such as a}} <b>bidirectional</b> <b>diode</b> induce progressive defects into the silicon bulk. With ''Sirtl etch" failure analysis technique, the defects could be localized quite precisely at the peripheral in/out junctions. The degradation mechanisms during repetitive IEC 61000 - 4 - 2 pulses have been investigated on a protection diode {{with the objective of}} improving the design for sustaining 1000 pulses at 10 kV level...|$|E

While this representation is schematically accurate, physically the devices are now manufactured as a single component.|$|R

The addition of an integrated image sensor significantly boosts the range of applications. This paper describes the base-building block for these systems: the <b>bidirectional</b> organic light-emitting <b>diode</b> microdisplay. A small and lightweight optic design, an eye-tracking algorithm, and interaction concepts are also presented...|$|R

In strained Si 1 -xGex alloy, the phosphorus doping profile is more stable {{because it has}} higher incorporation rate of phosphorus compared with the unstrained silicon. Thus, we obtained the N+/P/N+ junction doping profile with N+ doping (> 1 Ã— 1...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{advances}} in micro/nano- technologies have shown high potentials {{in the field}} of quantitative biology, biomedical science, and analytical chemistry. However, micro/nano fluidics still requires multi-layered structures, complex plumbing/tubing, and external equipments for large-scale applications and nanotechnology-based sensors demand high cost. Interestingly, nature has much simpler and more effective solutions. The goal of this dissertation is to develop novel microfluidic platforms and nanobiosensors inspired by biological systems. In this dissertation, I report the development of a biologically inspired <b>bidirectional</b> fluidic <b>diode</b> motivated by the xylem pores, which allows designing a functional large-scale microfluidic circuit and autonomous fluidic controls without any delegate efforts on fluid regulation. The biologically inspired <b>bidirectional</b> fluidic <b>diode</b> requires only a single-layered structure and a single pressure source to regulate flow in both directions through the entire platform. The operational conditions are precisely estimated based on the fully developed analytical model, which considers the hysteresis of contact angles and effects of fabrication limitations. To demonstrate its many possible applications, I show large-scale, spontaneous droplet-patterning and colonized cell-patterning programmed with the uni- and bi-directional fluidic diodes in the microfludic platform. In addition, inspired by target recognition in nature, an aptamer-based nanoplasmonic sensor, `aptasensor' is presented by detecting a coagulation protein, human &# 945;-thrombin. Also, I present an aptasensor targeting vascular endothelial growth factor- 165 (VEGF 165), a predominant and effective cancer biomarker for the diagnostics of various solid cancers. The integration of an aptasensor into a microfluidic platform is demonstrated by applying the VEGF 165 aptasensor to detect secreted VEGF 165 from breast cancer cells cultured in a microfluidic platform. I envision that elucidation of mechanisms underlying in biological systems will inspire to create new technologies for the application to precision biology, biotechnology, and medicine. Furthermore, the developed biologically inspired engineering will provide physical insights, analytical models, and useful tools for the better understanding of biological systems...|$|R
40|$|A barrier width {{modulated}} GaN based resonant {{tunnel diode}} is theoretically proposed which exhibits a giant {{peak to valley}} current ratio as high as 60 and a high negative differential conductance (NDC) of 1. 77 x 10 (6) S/cm(2) with very low valley current density of 3 mA/cm(2). This is achieved by the unique characteristic of the device current which monotonically decreases for applied voltages greater than the valley voltage in our simulation window. This {{is in contrast to}} all the other negative differential conductance based devices which experience an immediate exponential increase in current after the NDC region. The proposed device is also the first <b>bidirectional</b> tunneling <b>diode</b> which shows negative differential conductance for both polarity of the applied bias which is normally not observed with the conventional GaN/AIGaN double barrier structures due to the strong asymmetry arising from the internal electric fields due to polarization. The unique characteristics of the device {{can be attributed to the}} use of a modulated barrier width which is made possible by a polarization modulating InGaN layer and efficient utilization of internal electric fields in III-nitrides.

40|$|A novel self-aligned <b>bidirectional</b> Metal-Insulator-Metal (MIM) <b>diode</b> with {{transparent}} junctions {{is proposed}} and fabricated. The MIR?I diode is formed {{by a combination}} of Ta/TaOx/ITO/TaOx/Ta. In this structure, both symmetrical and shift-free I-V characteristics are obtained. The symmetrical I-V characteristics are attributed to the excellent symmetry in the diode structure. The significant reduction of the shift in the I-V characteristics {{is a result of the}} removal of the charges captured by the traps in the TaOx layers and at the interfaces between the TaOx and the electrodes during electrical stress, Only three masks are needed for the fabrication of the MIM diode pixel, which is as simple as the conventional approach. Moreover, the adoption of the lateral junction approach in the structure makes it possible to be used for high density MIM matrix implementation over large area substrates without the need of high-resolution patterning techniques...|$|R
