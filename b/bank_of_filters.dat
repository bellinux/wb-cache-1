A key advantage of this approach is that no information about the coded aperture pattern is required.

One of the main advantages of neural networks is the lack of a dependence on prior knowledge to set up the <b>banks</b> <b>of</b> <b>filters</b> at each layer. However, this entails that the network must learn the optimal value for these filters through processing numerous training inputs.

30|$|In [9], the {{inference}} of general state-space models characterized by nonlinear process and observation equations is addressed via {{the concept of}} Gaussian sum particle filter (GSPF) which approximates the filtering and predictive distributions by weighted Gaussian mixtures, that is, <b>banks</b> <b>of</b> Gaussian particle <b>filters</b> (GPFs). With non-Gaussian noise approximated by Gaussian mixtures, the non-Gaussian noise models are approximated by <b>banks</b> <b>of</b> Gaussian noise models. However, in wireless sensor networks, the process and observation equations are linear functions. Therefore, we extend the use <b>of</b> a new <b>filter,</b> the composite particle filter (CPF), to encompass linear and additive non-Gaussian noise models. For a linear state-space model with additive non-Gaussian noise, CPF approximates the posterior distributions as Gaussian mixtures using <b>banks</b> <b>of</b> parallel Kalman <b>filters</b> (KFs). The main contribution {{of this paper is}} a novel clock offset estimation method, called the composite particle filter (CPF), which is shown to be robust to the unknown distribution of network delays.
