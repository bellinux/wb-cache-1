Due to the complicated formation of {{residual stress}}, it's difficult to calculate theoretically. In present study, measurement method is generally used.

There were 6 stages in cold rolling deep groove <b>ball</b> <b>bearing</b> <b>race.</b> Electric wire discharge machine was used to cut the rings after rolling in each stage. The radius of rings would change after cutting. According to the derived analytic calculation theory of residual stress, the residual stress could be calculated in different rolling stage. The residual stresses were in the range of 110 - 200 MPa. Compared the measurement results from finite element simulation results, the greatest difference was 20 %, which was in accepted rang. Through calculation results of six stages in cold ring rolling, it could found that the residual stress increased with the increase of deformation, the straightening stage was benefit to decrease residual stress...|$|E

40|$|The Z- 2 is a {{candidate}} for NASA's next generation spacesuit, designed for a range of possible missions with enhanced mobility for spacewalks both on planetary surfaces and in microgravity. Increased mobility was accomplished through innovations in shoulder and hip joints, using a number of new bearings to allow spacesuit wearers to dip, walk, and bend with ease; all important tasks for a planetary explorer collecting samples or traveling over rough terrain. The Advanced Spacesuit Development Team of NASA Johnson Space Center requested that the NASA White Sands Test Facility (WSTF) perform a series failure simulation tests on three titanium bearing assemblies, an elemental part of the joint construction used in new spacesuit designs. This testing simulated two undetected failures within the bearings and as a result the objective of this test program was to evaluate whether a failed or failing bearing could result in ignition of the titanium race material due to friction. The first failure was an inner seal leak sufficient to pressurize the race with + 99 percent oxygen. The second failure was an improperly installed or mismatched ball port that created a protrusion in the <b>ball</b> <b>bearing</b> <b>race,</b> partially obstructing the nominal rolling path of each ball bearing. When the spacesuit bearings are assembled, bearing balls are loaded into the assembly via a ball port. The ball port is specific and unique to each bearing assembly (matched pair). The simulated mismatched ball port is a significant source of friction, which would be caused by an assembly error. To evaluate this risk, the bearings were cycled in a simulated worst-case scenario environment, with operational loads, and potential flaw conditions. During test the amount of actuation torque required and heat generated through continuous operation were measured and the bearings were observed for sparks or burning events.
