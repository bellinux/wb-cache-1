40|$|The {{present study}} {{involves}} {{the analysis of}} various possible valuations of rural <b>Biomethanisation</b> applied to the bovine manure. The diagnosis concerned gas productivity and some pollution parameters, plant growth and fertigation in a vegetable nursery. The preliminary {{results of the study}} showed that the conditioning of the produced rural biogas has improved its energy efficiency. The use of peat mixed with bovine methacompost as a nursery substrate has shown encouraging results as measured through height growth of pepper plants. In addition, the juice of bovin process, diluted with 75 % of water, has showed an interesting fertilizing capacity; with the absence of plant wilting. However, in terms of environmental protection, the process of <b>Biomethanisation</b> does not allow a satisfactorily reduction of pollution load of suspended solids and BOD 5...|$|E
40|$|This work {{consists}} in studying various possible valorizations {{of the rural}} <b>biomethanisation</b> applied to the bovine dejections. The follow-up of the adopted digester related to: the estimate of the qualitative productivity (% CH 4, % CO 2, % H 2 S and % H 2; LCV and HCV) before and after conditioning. For {{the analysis of the}} gas composition and the estimation of the calorific values, we had recourse to the technique of chromatography in gaseous phase (CGP); analysis of certain environmental parameters (SM and BDO 5), in order to establish the corresponding assessments of depollution; possibilities of agronomic valorization except ground of the residues of the <b>biométhanisation</b> (the methacompost as full or partial substitute for peat and / or compost and juice process plants gardeners as fertilizer). The significant preliminary results rising from this work are the following: the conditioning of rural biogas product made it possible to improve the energy performances; the process of rural <b>biomethanisation</b> allowed an insufficient reduction of the polluting load as for SM as for BDO 5; the use of the methacompost as a partial substrate of culture gives encouraging results for the growth in height of the pepper seedlings; the juice of process diluted at a rate of 75 % showed an interesting power fertilizing. Ultimately, the current trend towards the agrobiologic practices encourages the agronomic use of these digestats, because of the importante depollution generated...|$|E

Three various preparation were studied. The fermentexibility of the plant is shown with productivites comparable to and even often higher than other biomasses. The best yield obtained in mesophilic condition with the ground plant 0. 375 l/l/day) are only very slightly modified in moderate thermophilic condition (0. 385 l/l/day). On the other hand with the coarse chopped plant, the yield is trebled with the temperature increase (0. 238 l/l/day at 0. 784 l/l/day) ...|$|E
40|$|This work {{consists}} {{in evaluating the}} Co-products of the <b>biomethanisation</b> applied to the animal biomass {{on the level of}} various types of digesters (experimental I, II, III and IV, rural and industrial). This work made it possible to arise certain number of observations: The energy performances are more interesting {{in the case of the}} digesters powered with the avicolous droppings; the reduction of the polluting load as of SM is more important in the case of the industrial digester, whereas for the BDO 5, it is in favor of the experimental digester II; The agronomic use of the secondary by-products proves very encouraging and powerful. ...|$|E
40|$|A rising {{demand for}} {{substrates}} for {{the increasing number}} of biogas plants in Germany and a growing percentage of extensively used grassland sites mean that landscape management grass is increasingly considered for use as a substrate for <b>biomethanisation.</b> Harvesting periods from mid-June until February lead to a highly inhomogeneous material with extremely variable substrate characteristics. In order to obtain seasonal patterns of biogas and methane yields from landscape management grass, samples were taken each month from the first cut of a Meadow Foxtail fen grassland over three years from 2001 to 2004 and anaerobically digested in laboratory-scale batch experiments. Substrate-specific biogas yields decrease linearly throughout the season from 547 lN/kg VS in June to 299 lN/kg VS in February. Methane contents stay largely constant over the year with a mean value of 52 Vol. -%. The seasonal pattern of substrate-specific methane yields runs parallel to the biogas yields and declines from 298 lN/kg VS in June to 155 lN/kg VS in February. Area-specific methane yields show a maximum of 1604 m 3 ha- 1 a- 1 in September. Biogas and methane yields from landscape management grass are relatively low in comparison to those of other crop substrates...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{anaerobic}} digestion offers an advantageous alternative to landfilling, incineration and composting {{since it is}} considered as the most appropriate treatment solution. Indeed, the biogas naturally produced by the fermentation of organic waste into anaerobic digesters, contains between 40 and 60 % of methane, which gives it fuel character and its valorisation allows energy conservation while protecting the environment by reducing the greenhouse gases emission. This process corresponds perfectly to the policy of sustainable development. The objective {{of this paper is}} to popularize the technique of organic waste <b>biomethanisation</b> or {{anaerobic digestion}} in order to produce renewable energy and cleaner environment through the exploitation of research results. In this work, we used as support the experimental results obtained in the laboratory. The mesophilic anaerobic digestion of cowdung, into an experimental digester of 800 liters capacity, has produced 26. 478 m 3 of biogas for 77 days with an average optimal composition of 61 % in methane and energy equivalent to 592. 8 MJ (164. 5 kWh). These results are hopeful for the use of cattle wastes mass available in Algeria, or even household wastes...|$|E
40|$|Poultry {{industry}} wastes, namely {{feathers and}} poultry litter, {{are an interesting}} source of substrate for biogas production. The aim of this work {{was to assess the}} biomethane potential of raw poultry wastes, as well as the possibility of enhancing this potential by favouring the hydrolysis of cellulolytic and proteinaceous material in the wastes by using bioaugmentation and thermochemical pre-treatments. Biomethane production from poultry litter and chicken feathers was assessed in batch assays. Pre-treatment with lime and sodium hydroxide was performed at different temperatures and pressures. Clostridium cellulolyticum, C. saccharolyticum and C. thermocellum were used as bioaugmentation strains in the anaerobic digestion of poultry litter. Fervidobacterium pennivorans was used to aid the hydrolysis of poultry feather. Anaerobic digestion of the raw wastes allowed a methanisation percentage (MP) of 17 ± 2 and 33 ± 5 %, respectively from poultry litter and chicken feathers, with 2. 5 % total solids. The major increase in <b>biomethanisation</b> of poultry litter was reached after the thermochemical pre-treatment with Ca(OH) 2 (90 °C, 1. 27 bar, 120 minutes), with an increase of 15 % in the MP comparatively with the raw wastes MP. For the poultry feathers waste, none of the implemented strategies contributed to the optimization of methane production. However, it was observed that all treatments have contributed to {{a significant increase in the}} wastes solubilisation. Therefore, the conversion of soluble organic matter to methane was the limiting step of the anaerobic digestion process of poultry wastes...|$|E
40|$|The growing {{interest}} in environmental protection {{has led to the}} development of emerging biotechnologies for environmental remediation also introducing the biorefinery concept. This work mainly aimed to evaluate the applicability of innovative biotechnologies for environmental remediation and bioenergy production, throught fermentative processes. The investigated biotechnologies for waste and wastewater treatment and for the valorisation of specific feedstocks and energy recovery, were mainly focused on four research lines. 1. Biotechnology for textile wastewater treatment and water reuse that involving anaerobic and aerobic processes in combination with membrane technologies. Combinations of different treatments were also implemented for water reuse in a textile company. 2. Biotechnology for the treatment of solid waste and leachate in landfill and for biogas production. Landfill operated as Bioreactor with recirculation of the generated leachate was proposed for organic matter biostabilisation and for ammonia removal from leachate by favouring the Anammox process. 3. An innovative two-stage anaerobic process for effective codigestion of waste from the dairy industry, as cheese whey and dairy manure, was studied by combining conventional fermentative processes with a simplified system design for enhancing <b>biomethanisation.</b> 4) The valorisation of the glycerol waste as surplus by-product of the biodiesel industry was investigated via microbial conversion to value-added chemicals, as 1, 3 -propanediol. The investigated fermentative processes have been successfully implemented and reached high yields of the produced bio-chemical. The studied biotechnological systems proved to be feasible for environmental remediation and bioenergy and chemicals production. ...|$|E
