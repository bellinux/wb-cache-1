5|$|The CNR {{adopted the}} inquiry recommendations, {{installing}} <b>block</b> <b>signalling</b> {{in the area}} of the accident. In 1953, it modernised its passenger fleet, ordering 302new cars. In later years, the line was rerouted to eliminate the sharp curve on which the disaster took place.|$|E

50|$|At crowded {{stations}} on high-traffic lines, {{a platform}} track may {{be divided into}} two block sections so a following train can enter the track soon after the preceding train has departed. This signal is known as a No. 0 <b>block</b> <b>signal.</b> JR East treats this signal as a part of its home signals. At non-interlocking stations of JR West and other operators, the last <b>block</b> <b>signal</b> before the station is treated as a No. 0 <b>block</b> <b>signal</b> and known as the home <b>signal</b> equivalent <b>block</b> <b>signal.</b> This signal is not absolute, since (unlike home signals) non-blocking operation is permitted. On ATOS (Automated Transport Operating System) lines <b>block</b> <b>signals</b> are numbered serially, regardless of non-interlocking stations. In this case, some <b>block</b> <b>signals</b> are defined as home-signal equivalent or starting-signal equivalent.|$|R
5|$|Today little {{mechanical}} signalling remains, with local signal boxes controlling signals abolished from many areas {{as part of}} the Regional Fast Rail project. The suburban network and busier regional lines use variants of Automatic <b>Block</b> <b>Signalling,</b> while quieter lines use the Train Staff and Ticket or Train Order systems of safeworking. Train protection has also progressed, with the Train Protection & Warning System also introduced on major passenger lines {{as part of the}} Regional Fast Rail project.|$|E

50|$|A {{home signal}} (場内信号機, jōnai shingōki) permits trains {{to enter the}} station. A home signal is {{absolute}} (絶対信号機, zettai shingōki); therefore, non-blocking operation is always prohibited. Some stations have multiple home signals, due to station layout. In these cases, each home signal has an identification number which is counted from {{the outside of the}} station. In high-traffic areas, some operators install home signals {{in the center of a}} platform track to divide the block section. Some operators treat such <b>signals</b> as <b>block</b> <b>signals.</b> In non-interlocking stations, there may be a No.0 <b>block</b> <b>signal</b> (in some operations, a No.1 <b>block</b> <b>signal</b> or home-signal equivalent <b>block</b> <b>signal)</b> which alternates with the home signal.|$|R
25|$|The line is {{double track}} throughout, and {{controlled}} by automatic <b>block</b> <b>signalling.</b> Intermediate terminating facilities are provided only at Darling, {{although it is not}} normally used. Stabling facilities are provided at the junction (Burnley) and the terminus (Glen Waverley).|$|E
25|$|The system {{currently}} uses <b>block</b> <b>signalling,</b> {{which is}} used in other systems such as the Toronto subway and RT. The block signals that the New York City Subway currently uses is identical to those on the RT's signaling system.|$|E
25|$|Fixed <b>block</b> <b>signalling</b> {{has been}} used {{throughout}} the subway system since the opening of Toronto's first subway in 1954. Along with automatic signalling, used to prevent rear-end train collision, interlocking signals are used to prevent collisions from conflicting movements on track crossovers.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>block</b> <b>signal</b> (閉塞信号機, heisoku shingōki) {{begins a}} block section in an automatic-block system. In {{non-blocking}} operation a train can proceed past a <b>block</b> <b>signal</b> after stopping {{for one minute}} at the signal, even if the signal is [...] "stop".|$|R
5000|$|<b>Block</b> <b>signals</b> are {{the most}} {{commonly}} used signals on the Toronto subway. They are used to keep trains properly spaced, and are controlled by the trains themselves, based on their distance relative to other trains. The following <b>block</b> <b>signals</b> are used by the TTC.|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} identifying {{the support of the}} <b>block</b> <b>signal</b> in a sequence when both the length and the location of the <b>block</b> <b>signal</b> are unknown. The multivariate version of this problem is also considered, in which we try to identify the support of the rectangular signal in the hyper- rectangle. We allow the length of the <b>block</b> <b>signal</b> to grow polynomially with the length of the sequence, which greatly generalizes the previous results in [16]. A statistical boundary above which the identification is possible is presented and an asymptotically optimal and computationally efficient procedure is proposed under Gaussian white noise in both the univariate and multivariate settings. The problem of <b>block</b> <b>signal</b> identification is shown to have the same statistical difficulty as the corresponding problem of detection in both the univariate and multivariate cases, in the sense that whenever we can detect the signal, we can identify the support of the signal. Some generalizations are also considered here: (1) We ex- tend our theory to the case of multiple <b>block</b> <b>signals.</b> (2) We also discuss about the robust identification problem when the noise distribution is un- specified and the <b>block</b> <b>signal</b> identification problem under the exponential family setting...|$|R
25|$|Elements of the {{operation}} were used by British Rail to cut costs on remote lines. What became known as Radio Electronic Token <b>Block</b> <b>signalling</b> shared features with the Ratty, such as centralised control, automatic points at loops, and on-train equipment rather than fixed equipment at remote locations.|$|E
25|$|The {{rules of}} {{operation}} of the Sheffield Supertram {{are similar to those}} of a traditional railway. Unlike normal trains, tramways can be operated without signalling, although <b>block</b> <b>signalling</b> is sometimes necessary on single-line sections. The trams are driven on a line-of-sight basis, so that the tram can be stopped if an obstruction is spotted ahead.|$|E

25|$|The New York City Subway system has, for {{the most}} part, used <b>block</b> <b>signalling</b> since its 1904 opening. , the system {{consists}} of about 14,850 signal blocks, 3,538 mainline switches, 183 major track junctions, 10,104 automatic train stops, and 339,191 signal relays. Trains used {{to be controlled by}} signal towers at interlockings, but this was eventually phased out in favor of master towers. Eventually, these master towers were replaced by a single rail control center: the New York City Transit Power Control Center in Midtown Manhattan.|$|E
25|$|The West Coast Main Line upgrade was a {{long-term}} project covering {{a series of}} technical aspects. Improvements included the four-tracking (from three) of the Trent Valley (a bypass of the West Midlands), redesigning the layout of several junction/stations e.g. Rugby and other associated work to increase line speed. This culminated in tilting trains at 125mph being extended to Glasgow in 2005. The cost overruns of the programme are infamous - attributed to wide scope of programme (the promise to Virgin to build a 140mph railway which would require moving <b>block</b> <b>signalling)</b> and poor project management by the defunct Railtrack.|$|E
25|$|The {{requirement}} of road signals that a stop light should be visible over a queue of traffic {{and as far}} back as possible (thus demanding an order with red above) does not apply to railways with a <b>block</b> <b>signalling</b> system as there is no traffic queuing within a block, there being only one train in a block at a time. With railway signals, red need not be at the top for maximum visibility over distance as the driver of a train will already be expecting a red signal, having passed a yellow one in the previous block. This advance warning is missing with road signals.|$|E
