40|$|A Sensor network {{generally}} {{has a large}} number of sensor nodes that are deployed at some audited site. In most sensor networks the nodes are static. Nevertheless, node connectivity is subject to changes because of disruptions in wireless communication, transmission power changes, or loss of synchronization <b>between</b> <b>neighbouring</b> nodes, so {{there is a need to}} maintain synchronization <b>between</b> the <b>neighbouring</b> nodes in order to have efficient communication. Hence even after a sensor is aware of its immediate neighbours, it must continuously maintain its view a process we call continuous neighbour discovery. In this proposed work we are maintaining synchronization <b>between</b> <b>neighbouring</b> nodes so that the sensor network will be always active...|$|R

30|$|Fast {{prediction}} mode decision: The fast mode decision {{proposed by}} Gao [9] employed the spatial correlation <b>between</b> <b>neighbouring</b> blocks. In [10], a computational complexity reduction scheme for intra-coding was proposed by Jamali, where the edge property, spatial correlation <b>between</b> <b>neighbouring</b> PUs, and {{the classification of}} SATD costs were used. In [11], the edge direction information was exploited to define a reduced set of coding modes from which the best prediction mode is finally determined. In [12], a scheme was suggested to reduce the encoding time for lossless intra-coding in HEVC. Sanchez et al. employed differential pulse coding {{to reduce the number}} of modes to be evaluated.|$|R
