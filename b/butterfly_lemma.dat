50|$|In mathematics, the <b>butterfly</b> <b>lemma</b> or Zassenhaus lemma, {{named after}} Hans Zassenhaus, is a {{technical}} result on the lattice of subgroups {{of a group}} or the lattice of submodules of a module, or more generally for any modular lattice.|$|E

50|$|Hiltgunt Zassenhaus {{was born}} in Hamburg to Julius H. and Margret Ziegler Zassenhaus. Her father was a {{historian}} and school principal who lost his job when the Nazi regime {{came to power in}} 1933. Her brothers were the mathematician Hans (known for the <b>butterfly</b> <b>lemma</b> and the Zassenhaus group), and physicians Günther and Willfried.|$|E
50|$|When just 21, Zassenhaus was {{studying}} composition series in group theory. He proved his <b>butterfly</b> <b>lemma</b> {{that provides a}} refinement of two normal chains to isomorphic central chains. Inspired by Artin, Zassenhaus wrote a textbook Lehrbuch der Gruppentheorie that was later translated as Theory of Groups.His thesis was on doubly transitive permutation groups with Frobenius groups as stabilizers. These groups are now called Zassenhaus groups. They have had a deep impact on the classification of finite simple groups.He obtained his doctorate in June 1934, and took the teachers’ exam the next May. He became a scientific assistant at University of Rostock. In 1936 he became assistant to Artin back in Hamburg, but Artin departed for the USA the following year. Zassenhaus gave his Habilitation in 1938.|$|E
40|$|We {{show that}} a Jordan-Hölder theorem holds for {{appropriately}} defined composition series of finite dimensional Hopf algebras. This answers an open question of N. Andruskiewitsch. In {{the course of our}} proof we establish analogues of the Noether isomorphism theorems of group theory for arbitrary Hopf algebras under certain faithful (co) flatness assumptions. As an application, we prove an analogue of Zassenhaus' <b>butterfly</b> <b>lemma</b> for finite dimensional Hopf algebras. We then use these results to {{show that a}} Jordan-Hölder theorem holds as well for lower and upper composition series, even though the factors of such series may be not simple as Hopf algebras.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} indispensable technical {{results of}} a general theory that will allow to systematically derive from a given reduction system a behavioral congruence that respects concurrency. The theory is developed {{in the setting of}} adhesive categories and is based on the work by Ehrig and König on borrowed contexts; the latter are an instance of relative pushouts, which have been proposed by Leifer and Milner. In order to lift the concurrency theory of dpo rewriting to borrowed contexts we will study the special case of dpo rewriting with monic matches in adhesive categories: more specifically we provide a generalized <b>Butterfly</b> <b>Lemma</b> together with a Local Church Rosser and Parallelism theorem...|$|E
40|$|The lattice of {{subgroups of}} a group {{is the subject of}} {{numerous}} results revolving around the central theme of decomposing the group into "chunks" (subquotients) that can then be compared to one another in various ways. Examples of results in this class would be the Noether isomorphism theorems, Zassenhaus' <b>butterfly</b> <b>lemma,</b> the Schreier refinement theorem for subnormal series of subgroups, the Dedekind modularity law, and last but not least the Jordan-Hölder theorem. We discuss analogues of the above-mentioned results in the context of locally compact quantum groups and linearly reductive quantum groups. The nature of the two cases is different: the former is operator algebraic and the latter Hopf algebraic, hence the corresponding two-part organization of our study. Our intention is that the analytic portion be accessible to the algebraist and vice versa. The upshot is that in the locally compact case one often needs further assumptions (integrability, compactness, discreteness). In the linearly reductive case on the other hand, the quantum versions of the results hold without further assumptions. Moreover the case of compact / discrete quantum groups is usually covered by both the linearly reductive and the locally compact framework, thus providing a bridge between the two.
