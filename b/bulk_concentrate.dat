5000|$|The {{increasing}} {{difficulty of}} separating {{the lead and}} zinc minerals meant that MIM began producing a mixed lead and zinc concentrate (known in the industry as a [...] "bulk concentrate") {{at the beginning of}} 1986 and continued its production until late 1996. Payments by smelters to mining companies are lower for <b>bulk</b> <b>concentrate</b> due to the higher cost of running processes that can treat them.

50|$|At {{the same}} time, the mineral grain {{size of the}} lead-zinc ore mined and {{processed}} at Mount Isa was decreasing, making it harder to separate the lead and zinc minerals. The liberation of sphalerite (zinc sulfide) grains dropped from over 70% to just over 50% between 1984 and 1991. As a result, the Mount Isa lead-zinc concentrator was forced to produce a <b>bulk</b> <b>concentrate</b> {{from the beginning of}} 1986 until late 1996. Bulk concentrates cannot be treated in electrolytic zinc smelters, due to their lead content, and are typically treated in blast furnaces using the Imperial Smelting Process. The Imperial Smelting Process has higher operating costs than the more common electrolytic zinc process, and therefore the payment received by producers of <b>bulk</b> <b>concentrate</b> is lower than that received for separate lead and zinc concentrates. The zinc in the Mount Isa <b>bulk</b> <b>concentrate</b> was eventually worth less than half that of the zinc in the zinc concentrate.|$|E

It is worthwhile to stress that such an energy density component cannot do the same job on the normal Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati branch (without Gauss-Bonnet modifications) nor in a standard 4 -dimensional relativistic model. The acceleration on the brane is also presented as being induced through an effective dark energy which corresponds to a balance between the holographic one and geometrical effects encoded through the Hubble parameter.

40|$|Arsenic {{contained}} in sulphides such as enargite, tennantite and arsenopyrite can represent a significant penalty element in base metals production. There are significant economic advantages to achieving {{a separation of}} arsenic bearing minerals {{at an early stage}} in processing, but to date no feasible widely applicable commercial method of separation at the flotation stage has been developed. This review focuses on the current state of knowledge in the selective flotation of enargite, commonly found in association with non-arsenic copper sulphide mineralisation. Due to its similar flotation properties with many other copper sulphides, enargite is typically recovered together with the copper minerals, producing a high arsenic <b>bulk</b> <b>concentrate</b> which is costly and problematic to process.
