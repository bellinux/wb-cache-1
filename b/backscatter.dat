An opposite conclusion of absent <b>backscattering</b> was reached in a recent work [H. -Y. Xie et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 116, 086603 (2016) ] for the "local" model of the <b>backscattering</b> field and interactions. Motivated to resolve this potential controversy, in the present work, we study <b>backscattering</b> effects employing fermionic perturbation theory and considering quite general forms of the <b>backscattering</b> field and electron interactions. We discover that <b>backscattering</b> effects are crucially sensitive to the locality properties of the <b>backscattering</b> field and electron interactions, to the symmetry of the latter, {{as well as to the}} presence or absence of the cutoff of the electron spectrum. We find that <b>backscattering</b> is indeed absent under the following assumptions: (i) local <b>backscattering</b> field; (ii. a) local or (ii. b) SU(2) -symmetric interactions; (iii) absent cutoff of the edge-state spectrum. However, violation of any of these conditions leads to <b>backscattering.</b> This also reconciles with the results based on the bosonization technique. We calculate the associated <b>backscattering</b> current, establish its low-bias scaling behavior, and predict a crossover between two different scaling regimes. The main implication of our findings is that <b>backscattering</b> of some magnitude is inevitable in a real system, although could be quite suppressed for nearly local <b>backscattering</b> field and interactions.

40|$|Graduation date: 2009 The {{inherent}} {{and apparent}} optical properties of different ocean regimes {{are the basis}} for all optical remote sensing of the ocean. Ecological information derived from remote sensors therefore relies on having a detailed understanding of how particulate <b>backscattering</b> and absorption contribute to the bulk optical signal. The absorption characteristics of oceanic particles, e. g. phytoplankton and marine bacteria, organic detritus, and minerogenic particles, have been well characterized, {{and there are several}} ways to determine their contribution to bulk signals. In contrast, the <b>backscattering</b> properties of marine particles are not well understood, and indeed there is still some uncertainty regarding the dominant sources of <b>backscattering</b> in the ocean. Recent advances in optical instrumentation now permit laboratory and in situ examination of the spectral <b>backscattering</b> properties of marine particles, and we use these new tools to improve the characterization of <b>backscattering</b> in the ocean. We first investigated the ratio of <b>backscattering</b> to total scattering across a wide range of oceanic environments and particle types. The spectral dependency of the particulate <b>backscattering</b> ratio (backscattering/scattering in all directions) is relevant in the fields of ocean color inversion, light field modeling, and inferring particle properties from optical measurements. Aside from theoretical predictions for spherical, homogeneous particles, we have had very limited data showing the actual in situ spectral variability of the particulate <b>backscattering</b> ratio. Our analysis of five data sets from different ocean regimes revealed no spectral dependence of the particulate <b>backscattering</b> ratio within our measurement certainty. We did find however, that different particle populations demonstrated qualitative differences in the <b>backscattering</b> ratio. In an effort to better understand the variability that we observed in in situ <b>backscattering,</b> we investigated the spectral <b>backscattering</b> properties of thirteen species of marine phytoplankton using laboratory cultures. Theoretical analysis has shown that the <b>backscattering</b> coefficient and <b>backscattering</b> ratio may be influenced by particle size, shape, composition, and internal structure. We found species-specific relationships between <b>backscattering</b> and photosynthetic pigment concentration, and distinct differences between species in the <b>backscattering</b> ratio. These differences were related to cell size and were likely influenced by internal cell structure and composition. Of particular importance is our finding that <b>backscattering</b> by phytoplankton cells is higher than predicted by model studies. Finally, we used the <b>backscattering</b> coefficient and the <b>backscattering</b> ratio to aid in the discrimination of non-algal particle populations and major phytoplankton taxonomic groups in a complex coastal environment. We combined information from multiple in situ measurements, including chlorophyll concentration, hyperspectral absorption and attenuation, as well as <b>backscattering,</b> to discriminate and track phytoplankton groups and colored detrital matter in an optically complex, nearshore environment.

The radio-auroras are observed mostly at high latitudes and rarely extend down to middle latitudes. The occurrence of radio-auroras depends on solar activity (flares, coronal holes, CMEs) and annually the events are more numerous during solar cycle maxima. Radio aurora includes the so-called afternoon radio aurora which produces stronger but more distorted signals and after the Harang-minima, the late-night radio aurora (sub-storming phase) returns with variable signal strength and lesser doppler spread. The propagation range for this predominantly back-scatter mode extends up to about 2000km in east-west plane, but strongest signals are observed most frequently from the north at nearby sites on same latitudes.|$|E

40|$|M. Ing. (Electrical and Electronic Engineering) A {{distributed}} temperature {{fiber sensor}} {{based on the}} ratio of the Raman anti-Stokes to Rayleigh <b>backscattered</b> light components is studied. The aim of the study is to propose a method of quantifying the noise exhibited in the Rayleigh <b>backscattered</b> signal and further propose correlation coding techniques to reduce the noise in the Rayleigh and Raman <b>backscattered</b> signals. The noise in the Rayleigh <b>backscattered</b> signal is referred to as “interferometric noise”. When Rayleigh scattering along the length of an optical fiber occurs, some of the scattered light travels in a direction opposite to the direction of propagation, and is called <b>backscattered</b> light. When the coherence length of the optical source permits interactions between the Rayleigh <b>backscattered</b> light, there is a possibility for the interacting <b>backscattered</b> light, within a distance that is half the coherence length, to interfere with each other. Furthermore, when the sensing optical fiber is greater than the coherence length of the optical source, there will be several interference sections {{along the length of the}} sensing fiber causing the intensity of the Rayleigh <b>backscattered</b> light at the photo-detectors to vary randomly. The intensity variation gives the Rayleigh <b>backscattered</b> signal a jagged appearance indicating the presence of interferometric noise. The longer the coherence length of the optical sources, the larger the intensity variations in the <b>backscattered</b> light, that is, the more the interferometric noise exhibited. The more the interferometric noise in the Rayleigh <b>backscattered</b> signal, the poorer the temperature accuracy of the distributed temperature sensor based on {{the ratio of the}} Raman anti Stokes to Rayleigh <b>backscattered</b> components. To quantify the interferometric noise affecting the Rayleigh <b>backscattered</b> signal, a mathematical model based on well-known scattering and interferometry theories is developed.

25|$|There is {{a diverse}} range and {{combination}} of methodologies employed {{to understand the}} hydrological dynamics in salt marshes {{and their ability to}} trap and accrete sediment. Sediment traps are often used to measure rates of marsh surface accretion when short term deployments (e.g. less than one month) are required. These circular traps consist of pre-weighed filters that are anchored to the marsh surface, then dried in a laboratory and re-weighed to determine the total deposited sediment. For longer term studies (e.g. more than one year) researchers may prefer to measure sediment accretion with marker horizon plots. Marker horizons consist of a mineral such as feldspar that is buried at a known depth within wetland substrates to record the increase in overlying substrate over long time periods. In order to gauge the amount of sediment suspended in the water column, manual or automated samples of tidal water can be poured through pre-weighed filters in a laboratory then dried to determine the amount of sediment per volume of water. Another method for estimating suspended sediment concentrations is by measuring the turbidity of the water using optical <b>backscatter</b> probes, which can be calibrated against water samples containing a known suspended sediment concentration to establish a regression relationship between the two. Marsh surface elevations may be measured with a stadia rod and transit, electronic theodolite, Real-Time Kinematic Global Positioning System, laser level or electronic distance meter (total station). Hydrological dynamics include water depth, measured automatically with a pressure transducer, or with a marked wooden stake, and water velocity, often using electromagnetic current meters.|$|E
