The next bridge {{along the river}} is Kingsland Bridge, a privately owned toll bridge, and the subsequent <b>bridge</b> <b>is</b> the Greyfriars Bridge, a pedestrian bridge between Coleham and the town centre. Following the Greyfriars <b>Bridge</b> <b>is</b> the English Bridge, historically called Stone Bridge, which was rebuilt in the 1930s. Beyond it is the railway station, which is partly built over the river. After the station is Castle Walk Footbridge, another modern pedestrian footbridge.|$|E

50|$|In 1806, a {{pontoon bridge}} named Grenadersky <b>bridge</b> <b>was</b> {{built over the}} river. In 1847, a wooden <b>bridge</b> <b>was</b> built, and the <b>bridge</b> <b>was</b> rebuilt several times before metal beam spans were laid in 1937. Present-day <b>bridge</b> <b>was</b> built by V.V. Demchenko, B.B. Levin and L.A. Noskov between 1955 and 1958. In year 2000, the <b>bridge</b> <b>was</b> fully renovated.|$|R
50|$|The <b>bridges</b> {{themselves}} <b>were</b> {{built as}} 10 metre high steel trusses. Their total length was about 270 metres, the railway <b>bridge</b> <b>was</b> 7.5 metres wide {{and the road}} <b>bridge</b> <b>was</b> 6.5 metres wide. On each side there was a 1.8 metre-wide footpaths. By 1906 the <b>bridge</b> <b>was</b> found to be too narrow. It took until 1928 to begin planning an upgrade of the bridge. A new railway <b>bridge</b> <b>was</b> built directly beside the existing bridge in 1931 and 1932. The old railway <b>bridge</b> <b>was</b> converted for road traffic. The new <b>bridge</b> <b>was</b> also built with a steel framework, but without arches. In 1936 the <b>bridge</b> <b>was</b> named by the Nazis after Albert Leo Schlageter. At the end of World War II on 20 March 1945 the <b>bridge</b> <b>was</b> blown up by the German army. After the war, temporary <b>bridges</b> <b>were</b> built over the Rhine River connecting the railway in July 1946 and for the road in December 1948.|$|R
25|$|Additionally, {{a number}} of other <b>bridges</b> have <b>been</b> built across Raven Creek. A {{concrete}} tee beam <b>bridge</b> <b>was</b> built across the creek in 1928. Another <b>bridge</b> <b>was</b> built across it in 1950 and three more were built between 1958 and 1963. A prestressed box beam <b>bridge</b> <b>was</b> built in 1968. A steel culvert bridge and a concrete culvert <b>bridge</b> <b>were</b> built across the creek in 1974 and 1976, respectively and another <b>bridge</b> <b>was</b> built in 2011.|$|R
5|$|The <b>bridge</b> <b>is</b> {{monitored}} by 132 sensors, including sensors on hatches to the pontoons, on {{doors to the}} steel box girder, for corrosion, strain gauges on the girder and on flexible elements, and weather information. On the cable-stayed section, the <b>bridge</b> <b>is</b> marked with navigation lights, {{as well as the}} center of the sailing area having a racon. The <b>bridge</b> <b>is</b> the second-longest bridge in Norway, behind the Drammen Bridge.|$|E
5|$|The ferry, and {{subsequently}} the <b>bridge,</b> <b>is</b> {{located at the}} narrowest section of Skarnsundet, between the villages of Kjerringvik and Vangshylla.

50|$|Between 1985 and 1990 the <b>bridge</b> <b>was</b> being renovated, therefore, {{soldiers}} built {{a substitute}} bridge ca. 700 m {{to the north}} of the Poniatowski Bridge. The new <b>bridge</b> <b>was</b> named Mermaid <b>Bridge</b> (Most Syreny). Despite the fact that it was only a temporary <b>bridge,</b> it <b>was</b> not dismantled when in 1990 the overhaul of the Poniatowski <b>Bridge</b> <b>was</b> completed - traffic had become so heavy that both <b>bridges</b> <b>were</b> necessary. Mermaid <b>Bridge</b> <b>was</b> dismantled only in 2000, when the Świętokrzyski <b>Bridge</b> had <b>been</b> built a few metres to the north.|$|R
50|$|In June, 1938, a new {{reinforced}} concrete <b>bridge</b> <b>was</b> opened {{where the old}} Isabella II <b>bridge</b> <b>was</b> located. The new <b>bridge</b> <b>was</b> called Puente de la Victoria (Victory Bridge).|$|R

50|$|A wooden draw <b>bridge</b> <b>was</b> {{built in}} 1838. In 1916 the <b>bridge</b> <b>was</b> {{accommodated}} to two-way vehicular traffic. In 1947 the <b>bridge</b> <b>was</b> upgraded, with the spans replaced by metal beams; it now measured 297 m long and 18 m wide. In December 1993, ice destroyed {{part of the}} bridge structure. After that, the <b>bridge</b> <b>was</b> closed to vehicular traffic; it was narrowed to 2.2 m and was used only by pedestrians. The {{construction of a new}} <b>bridge</b> <b>was</b> started in 2009, and this opened in 2010. In the latter year, the old wooden <b>bridge</b> <b>was</b> dismantled.|$|R
50|$|The <b>bridge</b> <b>was</b> {{designed}} by Parsons Brinckerhoff in 1995. It {{was built in}} 1998 replacing the old Main Street <b>Bridge</b> that <b>was</b> built in 1923.

5|$|Named {{for energy}} firm BP, which donated $5million toward its construction, {{it is the}} first Gehry-designed bridge to have been completed. BP <b>Bridge</b> <b>is</b> {{described}} as snakelike because of its curving form. Designed to bear a heavy load without structural problems caused by its own weight, it has won awards for its use of sheet metal. The <b>bridge</b> <b>is</b> known for its aesthetics, and Gehry's style is seen in its biomorphic allusions and extensive sculptural use of stainless steel plates to express abstraction.|$|E
5|$|Richmond <b>Bridge</b> <b>is</b> an 18th-century stone {{arch bridge}} that crosses the River Thames at Richmond, {{connecting}} {{the two halves}} of the present-day London Borough of Richmond upon Thames. It was designed by James Paine and Kenton Couse.|$|E
5|$|The Albert <b>Bridge</b> <b>is</b> a {{road bridge}} over the River Thames in West London, {{connecting}} Chelsea on the north bank to Battersea on the south bank. Designed and built by Rowland Mason Ordish in 1873 as an Ordish–Lefeuvre system modified cable-stayed bridge, {{it proved to be}} structurally unsound, so between 1884 and 1887 Sir Joseph Bazalgette incorporated some of the design elements of a suspension bridge. In 1973 the Greater London Council added two concrete piers, which transformed the central span into a simple beam bridge. As a result, today the <b>bridge</b> <b>is</b> an unusual hybrid of three different design styles. It is an English Heritage Grade II* listed building.|$|E
50|$|The present <b>bridge</b> <b>was</b> {{designed}} by William Etty under an Act of 1725 and completed in 1727.The <b>bridge</b> <b>was</b> strengthened in the 1960s {{and at the}} same time the adjacent pedestrian <b>bridge</b> <b>was</b> erected.|$|R

On 21 May 2010, the Jubilee <b>Bridge</b> <b>was</b> closed on 21 May 2010 after a review found the <b>bridge</b> to <b>be</b> unsafe.
