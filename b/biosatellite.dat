5|$|The use of {{guinea pigs}} in {{scientific}} experimentation dates {{back at least}} to the 17th century, when the Italian biologists Marcello Malpighi and Carlo Fracassati conducted vivisections of guinea pigs in their examinations of anatomic structures. In 1780, Antoine Lavoisier used a guinea pig in his experiments with the calorimeter, a device used to measure heat production. The heat from the guinea pig's respiration melted snow surrounding the calorimeter, showing that respiratory gas exchange is a combustion, similar to a candle burning. Guinea pigs {{played a major role in}} the establishment of germ theory in the late 19th century, through the experiments of Louis Pasteur, Émile Roux, and Robert Koch. Guinea pigs have been launched into orbital space flight several times, first by the USSR on the Sputnik 9 <b>biosatellite</b> of March 9, 1961 – with a successful recovery. China also launched and recovered a <b>biosatellite</b> in 1990 which included guinea pigs as passengers.|$|E
5|$|Rodents {{are used}} widely as model organisms in animal testing. Albino mutant rats were first used for {{research}} in 1828 and later became the first animal domesticated for purely scientific purposes. Nowadays, the house mouse is {{the most commonly used}} laboratory rodent, and in 1979 it was estimated that fifty million were used annually worldwide. They are favored because of their small size, fertility, short gestation period and ease of handling and because they are susceptible to many of the conditions and infections that afflict humans. They are used in research into genetics, developmental biology, cell biology, oncology and immunology. Guinea pigs were popular laboratory animals until the late 20th century; about 2.5 million guinea pigs were used annually in the United States {{for research in}} the 1960s, but that total decreased to about 375,000 by the mid-1990s. In 2007, they constituted about 2% of all laboratory animals. Guinea pigs {{played a major role in}} the establishment of germ theory in the late 19th century, through the experiments of Louis Pasteur, Émile Roux, and Robert Koch. They have been launched into orbital space flight several times—first by the USSR on the Sputnik 9 <b>biosatellite</b> of March 9, 1961, with a successful recovery. The naked mole rat is the only known mammal that is poikilothermic; it is used in studies on thermoregulation. It is also unusual in not producing the neurotransmitter substance P, a fact which researchers find useful in studies on pain.|$|E

40|$|Skeletal {{alteration}} {{in experimental}} animals induced by actual and simulated spaceflight are discussed, {{noting that the}} main factor contributing to bone loss in growing rats placed in orbit aboard Soviet Cosmos <b>biosatellites</b> appears to be diminished bone formation. Mechanical unloading {{is seen as the}} most obvious cause of bone loss in a state of weightlessness. Reference is made to a study by Roberts et al. (1981), which showed that osteoblast differentiation in the periodontal ligament of the maxilla was suppressed in rats flown in space. Since the maxilla lacks a weight-bearing function, this finding indicates that the skeletal alterations associated with orbital flight may be systemic rather than confined to weight-bearing bones. In addition, the skeletal response to simulated weightlessness may also be systemic (wronski and Morey, 1982). In suspended rats, the hindlimbs lost all weight-bearing functions, while the forelimbs maintained contact with the floor of the hypokinetic model. On this basis, it was to be expected that there would be different responses at the two skeletal sites if the observed abnormalities were due to mechanical unloading alone. The changes induced by simulated weightlessness in the proximal tibia and humerus, however, were generally comparable. This evidence for systemic skeletal responses has drawn attention to endocrine factors...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1990 Space flight {{results in}} loss of mass and {{function}} in skeletal muscle. Data from manned flights and animal <b>biosatellites</b> give evidence of possible changes in neuromuscular interactions. Components at the neuromuscular junction are a potential {{site of action}} for this space-induced muscle atrophy. We examined the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor population (Bmax) and affinity (Kd), the activity of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE), and the endogenous levels of acetylcholine (ACh) and choline (Ch). We assayed the hindlimb soleus, gastrocnemius and tibialis, and the forelimb triceps brachii muscles after 1, 3 or 8 weeks of supsension. Bmax was greater than controls in the triceps brachii and in the gastrocnemius after 3 and 8 weeks of suspension respectively. Receptor Kd was decreased in the soleus muscles of rats suspended for 3 weeks. Enzyme activity decreased from control animals' levels in all 4 muscles, with the time to effect varying depending on the muscle and the enzyme. No difference was found in endogenous ACh levels in the soleus, but levels were increased in the gastrocnemius (3 weeks), and decreased in the tibialis (3 weeks) and triceps brachii (1 week). Ch levels were decreased in the soleus (1 and 3 weeks) and gastrocnemius (3 weeks) with no change from control levels in the tibialis and triceps brachii. Testosterone, as an anabolic hormone to skeletal muscle, was assayed in suspended and control rats. We found no difference from control animals in total testes tissue levels.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that humans exposed to long term spaceflight {{experience}} undesirable progressive muscle weakness and increased fatigability. This problem has prompted the implementation of inflight exercise programs because most investigators believe that the major cause of diminished muscle performance is a combination of disuse and decreased workload. Inflight exercise has improved muscle health, but deficits have persisted, indicating that either the regimens utilized were suboptimal or there existed additional debilitating factors which were not remedied by exercise. Clarification of this question requires an improved understanding of the cellular and molecular basis of spaceflight-induced muscle deterioration. To this end, multiple investigations have been performed on the muscles from rats orbited 5 to 22 days in Cosmos <b>biosatellites</b> and Spacelab- 3 (2, 4, 5, 8, 10 to 14, 16, 18, 19, 21 to 23, 25, 27, 28). The eight Cosmos 1887 investigations examined the structural and biochemical changes in skeletal and cardiac muscles of rats exposed to microgravity for 12. 5 days and returned to terrestrial gravity 2. 3 days before tissues were collected. Even though interpretation of these results was complicated by the combination of inflight and postflight induced alterations, the consensus is that there is marked heterogeneity in both degree and type of responses from the whole muscle level down to the molecular level. Collectively, the muscle investigations of Cosmos 1887 clearly illustrate the wide diversity of muscle tissue responses to spaceflight. Judging from the summary report of this mission, heterogeneity of responses is not unique to muscle tissue. Elucidating the mechanism underlying this heterogeneity holds the key to explaining adaptation of the organism to prolonged spaceflight...|$|R

40|$|Since {{more than}} 20 years ago, when the National Academy of Sciences and the National Research Council of the U. S. A. {{released}} their report on 'HZE particle effects in manned spaced flight', {{it has been}} emphasized how difficult - if not even impossible - it is to assess their radiobiological impact on man from conventional studies where biological test organisms are stochastically exposed to 'large' fluences of heavy ions. An alternative, competing approach had been realized in the BIOSTACK experiments, where the effects of single cosmic as well as accelerator - heavy ions on individual biological test organisms could be investigated. Although presented from the beginning as the preferable approach for terrestrial investigations with accelerator heavy ions too ('The BIOSTACK as an approach to high LET radiation research'), only recently this insight is gaining more widespread recognition. In space flight experiments, additional constraints imposed by the infrastructure of the vehicle or satellite further impede such investigations. Restrictions concern the physical detector systems needed for the registration of the cosmic heavy ions' trajectories {{as well as the}} biological systems eligible as test organisms. Such optimized procedures and techniques were developed for the investigations on chromosome aberrations induced by cosmic heavy ions in cells of the stem meristem of lettuce seeds (Lactuca sativa) and for the investigation of the radiobiological response of Wolffia arriza, which is the smallest flowering (water) plant. The biological effects were studied by the coworkers of the Russian Institute of Biomedical Problems (IBMP) which in cooperation with the European Space Agency ESA organized the exposure in the <b>Biosatellites</b> of the Cosmos series. Since biological investigations and physical measurements of particle tracks had to be performed in laboratories widely separated, the preferred fixed contact between biological test objects and the particle detectors until the geometrical correlation between tracks and organisms has been established could not be maintained. This gave rise to half a dozen of coordinate systems for different measurements which finally had to be related to a single stack reference system...|$|R
