40|$|A {{comparison}} {{has been}} made of the in-use bacterial load of two <b>bar</b> <b>soaps</b> with and without antibacterials and two liquid soaps in five different locations over a 1 -week period. Of the 25 samples taken from each soap, 92 to 96 % of samples from <b>bar</b> <b>soaps</b> were culture positive as compared to 8 % of those from liquid soaps. Bacterial populations ranged from 0 to 3. 8 log CFU per sample for <b>bar</b> <b>soaps</b> and from 0 to 2. 0 log CFU per sample for liquid soaps. The mean bacterial populations per sample were 1. 96 and 2. 47 log CFU for the two <b>bar</b> <b>soaps,</b> and 0. 08 and 0. 12 log CFU for the two liquid soaps. The difference in bacterial population between <b>bar</b> <b>soaps</b> and liquid soaps was statistically significant (P = 0. 005). Staphylococcus aureus was isolated on three occasions from <b>bar</b> <b>soaps</b> but not from liquid soaps. S. aureus was isolated twice from the exterior of the plastic dispensers of liquid soap but not from the soap itself. Gram-negative bacteria were cultured only from soaps containing antibacterials. Bacterial populations on <b>bar</b> <b>soaps</b> were not high compared with bacterial populations on hands, and the flora was continually changing without evidence of a carrier state...|$|R

60|$|By {{the door}} of the station-keeper's den, outside, was a tin wash-basin, on the ground. Near it was a pail of water and a piece of yellow <b>bar</b> <b>soap,</b> and from the eaves hung a hoary blue woolen shirt, {{significantly}} --but this latter was the station-keeper's private towel, and only two persons in all the party might venture to use it--the stage-driver and the conductor. The latter would not, from a sense of decency; the former would not, because did not choose to encourage the advances of a station-keeper. We had towels--in the valise; they {{might as well have been}} in Sodom and Gomorrah. We (and the conductor) used our handkerchiefs, and the driver his pantaloons and sleeves. By the door, inside, was fastened a small old-fashioned looking-glass frame, with two little fragments of the original mirror lodged down in one corner of it. This arrangement afforded a pleasant double-barreled portrait of you when you looked into it, with one half of your head set up a couple of inches above the other half. From the glass frame hung the half of a comb by a string--but if I had to describe that patriarch or die, I believe I would order some sample coffins.|$|E

40|$|Abstract In {{this paper}} using quality {{management}} tools we track root causes and principal {{causes of the}} rising manufacturing cost of the <b>bar</b> <b>soaps</b> and propose solution to solve the problem. First we identify and analyze the roots causes of problem with the Fishbone Diagram. We use multivoting approach to reduce roots causes to main causes from which we identify classify and analyze principal causes using the Pareto Diagram. We then perform a deep analysis of these principal causes using the 5 whys analysis technique. Three principal causes were found amp 61480 high level of overtime poor machine performance and poor employees performanceamp 61481 and were weighing 55 of the problem. For that reason working on these areas was necessary {{to address the problem}} of the rising manufacturing cost of the <b>bar</b> <b>soaps.</b> With the result we then use the PDCA 7 steps of TQM method to solve the problem of the rising manufacturing cost by testing whether expanding production capacity leads to performance improvements of these areas. We decide to expand production capacity by adding two more machine groups. Six months after implementation of the proposed solution the result shows an enhanced workload and schedule an increased production capacity an elimination of the overtime issue an increased machines performance and an improved workers performance. Two main savings were achieved as wage costs and maintenance costs. As a result while competitors <b>bar</b> <b>soaps</b> prices increased the company <b>bar</b> <b>soaps</b> price decreased by 50 making the company <b>bar</b> <b>soaps</b> more attractive on market as this performance permitted the company to apply price reduction at the retailer level...|$|R
