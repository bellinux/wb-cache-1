5|$|Seven of the calendrical crescents (red) are {{accompanied}} by other glyphs (green). Guy suggests syllabic readings for some of these, based on possible rebuses and correspondences {{with the names of}} the nights in the old calendar. The two sequences of six and five nights without such accompanying glyphs (<b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>line</b> 7, and transition of lines 7–8) correspond to the two groups of six and five numbered kokore nights, which do not have individual names.|$|E
25|$|An initial {{reversal}} is {{also found}} in line 8, while a mid-line reversal occurs in line 4. Due to the flexibility of emphasis in monosyllables, the <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>line</b> 11 may be scanned as regular, an initial reversal, or a minor ionic.|$|E
25|$|Although the {{direction}} of reading has been determined, {{the point where the}} text starts has not. Philippi's line numbers were arbitrary, but kept by Barthel. The main asymmetry is that line 12 (Fischer's line 1) is 90cm long, running three quarters the length of the Staff. The space occupied by lines 12 and 13 is 30mm wide at the thick end of the staff (at the end of line 12 and <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>line</b> 13), but only 17mm wide at the tapered end (at the end of line 13). Past the cut-off point (the <b>beginning)</b> <b>of</b> <b>line</b> 12, the baseline of line 13 shifts upward, and the glyphs widen to fill in the gap. From that point on, 13 is parallel with line 11 rather than antiparallel as is normally the case for adjacent lines.|$|E

It is difficult to distinguish internal fault and external fault only based on existing protection principle.

2500|$|This is {{followed}} (in line 2, scanned above) {{with a common}} metrical variation, the initial reversal. An initial reversal is potentially present in line 8, and mid-line reversals occur in lines 4 and 12, and potentially in line 3. The <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>line</b> 5 is open to interpretation: it may be regular or an instance of initial reversal; however, it is most naturally scanned with the rightward movement of the first ictus (resulting in a four-position figure, ××//, {{sometimes referred to as}} a minor ionic): ...|$|E

2500|$|Beyond the {{frequent}} feminine endings, the meter is quite regular, {{but there are}} several significant cases in which, rather than {{the rhythm of the}} words determining the meter, the meter determines the rhythm of the words. This occurs especially in stretches of monosyllabic function words (like prepositions, conjunctions, and especially pronouns). The words at the <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>line</b> 5 could be emphasized in almost any combination and still deliver some sense; but when emphasized in accord with a regular meter, the reading [...] "For how do I hold thee" [...] underscores the antithetical rhetoric Shakespeare is known for. A similar effect can be heard in line 9's [...] "thy own worth", and likely in line 13's [...] "Thus have I had thee", emphasizing both the speaker's possession and its being past.|$|E
