2500|$|Eukaryotic DNA is {{bidirectional}}. Here {{the meaning}} of the word bidirectional is different. Eukaryotic linear DNA has many origins (called O) and termini (called T). [...] "T" [...] is present to the right of [...] "O". One [...] "O" [...] and one [...] "T" [...] together form one replicon. After the formation of pre-initiation complex, when one replicon starts elongation, initiation starts in second replicon. Now, if the first replicon moves in clockwise direction, the second replicon moves in anticlockwise direction, until [...] "T" [...] of first replicon is reached. At [...] "T", both the replicons merge to complete the process of replication. Meanwhile, the second replicon is moving in forward direction also, to meet with the third replicon. This clockwise and counter-clockwise movement of two replicons is termed as <b>bidirectional</b> <b>replication.</b> On the other hand, in prokaryotes, replication is unidirection; and occurs only in clockwise direction.|$|E

25|$|Eukaryotic {{origins of}} {{replication}} control {{the formation of}} a number of protein complexes that lead to the assembly of two <b>bidirectional</b> DNA <b>replication</b> forks. These events are initiated by the formation of the pre-replication complex (pre-RC) at the origins of replication. This process takes place in the G1 stage of the cell cycle. The pre-RC formation involves the ordered assembly of many replication factors including the origin recognition complex (ORC), Cdc6 protein, Cdt1 protein, and minichromosome maintenance proteins (Mcm2-7). Once the pre-RC is formed, activation of the complex is triggered by two kinases, cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK) and Dbf4-dependent kinase (DDK) that help transition the pre-RC to the initiation complex prior to the initiation of DNA replication. This transition involves the ordered assembly of additional replication factors to unwind the DNA and accumulate the multiple eukaryotic DNA polymerases around the unwound DNA.|$|R

40|$|Bacteria {{that have}} a {{circular}} chromosome with a <b>bidirectional</b> DNA <b>replication</b> origin are thought to utilize a 'replication fork trap' to control termination of replication. The fork trap is an arrangement of replication pause sites that ensures that the two replication forks fuse within the terminus region of the chromosome, approximately opposite the origin on the circular map. However, the biological significance of the replication fork trap has been mysterious, as its inactivation has no obvious consequence. Here we review the research {{that led to the}} replication fork trap theory, and we aim to integrate several recent findings that contribute towards an understanding of the physiological roles of the replication fork trap. Likely roles include the prevention of over-replication, and the optimization of post-replicative mechanisms of chromosome segregation, such as that involving FtsK in Escherichia coli...|$|R
40|$|In Escherichia coli, <b>bidirectional</b> {{chromosomal}} <b>replication</b> {{is accompanied}} by the colocalization of sister replication forks. However, the biological significance of this mechanism and the key factors involved are still largely unknown. In this study, we found that a protein, termed CrfC, helps sustain the colocalization of nascent DNA regions of sister replisomes and promote chromosome equipartitioning. CrfC formed homomultimers that bound to multiple molecules of the clamp, a replisome subunit that encircles DNA, and colocalized with nascent DNA regions in a clamp-binding-dependent manner in living cells. CrfC is a dynamin homolog; however, it lacks the typical membrane-binding moiety and instead possesses a clamp-binding motif. Given that clamps remain bound to DNA after Okazaki fragment synthesis, we suggest that CrfC sustains the colocalization of sister replication forks in a unique manner by linking together the clamp-loaded nascent DNA strands, thereby laying the basis for subsequent chromosome equipartitioning...|$|R
40|$|A general {{method for}} {{determining}} the physical location of an origin of <b>bidirectional</b> DNA <b>replication</b> has been developed recently and shown {{to be capable of}} correctly identifying the simian virus 40 origin of replication (L. Vassilev and E. M. Johnson, Nucleic Acids Res. 17 : 7693 - 7705, 1989). The advantage of this method over others previously reported is that it avoids the use of metabolic inhibitors, the requirement for cell synchronization, and the need for multiple copies of the origin sequence. Application of this method to exponentially growing Chinese hamster ovary cells containing the nonamplified, single-copy dihydrofolate reductase gene locus revealed that DNA replication begins bidirectionally in an initiation zone approximately 2. 5 kilobases long centered about 17 kilobases downstream of the DHFR gene, coinciding with previously described early replicating sequences.

40|$|We {{investigated}} the binding regions of {{components of the}} origin recognition complex (ORC) in the human genome. For this purpose, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation assays with antibodies against human Orc 1 and Orc 2 proteins. We identified a binding region for human Orc proteins 1 and 2 in a < 1 -kbp segment between two divergently transcribed human genes. The region is characterized by CpG tracts and a central sequence rich in AT base pairs. Both, Orc 1 and Orc 2 proteins are found at the intergenic region in the G 1 phase, but S-phase chromatin contains only Orc 2 protein, supporting the notion that Orc 1 p dissociates from its binding site in the S phase. Sequences corresponding to the intergenic region are highly abundant in a fraction of nascent DNA strands, strongly suggesting that this region not only harbors the binding sites for Orc 1 protein and Orc 2 protein but also serves as an origin of <b>bidirectional</b> DNA <b>replication...</b>|$|R
40|$|Chinese hamster genomic DNA {{sequences}} {{from the}} region downstream of the dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) gene reported to contain a chromosomal origin of <b>bidirectional</b> DNA <b>replication</b> (OBR- 1) were tested {{for their ability to}} support autonomous DNA replication in human cells. A 13. 3 kilobase fragment containing OBR- 1 and surrounding sequences supported replication in short-term and long-term replication assays, while a 4. 5 kb fragment containing OBR- 1 did not support substantial replication in either assay. These results are consistent with our previous observations that large fragments of human DNA support replication, while smaller fragments are less efficient. The replication activities of plasmids containing OBR- 1 were no greater than those of randomly chosen human fragments of similar size. Furthermore, two-dimensional gel analysis of plasmids containing OBR- 1 indicated that initiation does not preferentially occur within the OBR- 1 region. These results suggest that in the context of autonomous replication, the DHFR sequences tested do not contain genetic information specifying site-specific replication initiation. Possible implications of these results for chromosomal replication are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{nucleotide}} {{locations of}} RNA-p-DNA covalent linkages in polyoma virus (PyV) replicating DNA were mapped {{in the region}} containing the genetically required origin of DNA replication (ori). These linkages mark the initiation sites for RNA-primed DNA synthesis. A clear transition was identified between {{the presence of these}} linkages (discontinuous DNA synthesis) and their absence (continuous DNA synthesis) on each strand of ori. This demonstrated that PyV DNA replication, like simian virus 40 (SV 40), is semi-discontinuous, and thus revealed the location of the origin of <b>bidirectional</b> DNA <b>replication</b> (OBR). The transition site on the template encoding PyV late mRNA occurred at the junction of ori-core and T-antigen binding site A. This was essentially the same site as previously observed in SV 40 (Hay and DePamphilis, 1982). However, in contrast to SV 40, the transition site on the template encoding PyV early mRNA was displaced towards the late gene side of ori. This resulted in a 16 nucleotide gap within ori in which no RNA-p-DNA linkages were observed on either strand. A model for the initiation of PyV DNA replication is presented...|$|R

Fluorescent in situ hybridization experiments using probes derived from both ends of the 3. 79 AS 1 sequence showed a widespread signal over all sheep chromosomes, except the Y chromosome.

40|$|Two {{complementary}} experimental {{approaches have}} been used to identify a chromosomal origin of <b>bidirectional</b> DNA <b>replication</b> within or immediately downstream of the Chinese hamster ribosomal protein S 14 gene (RPS 14). The replication origin, designated oriS 14, maps within a 1. 6 - to 2. 0 -kbp region of RPS 14 that includes the gene's third and fourth introns, exons IV plus V, and approximately 500 bp of proximal downstream flanking DNA. The nucleic acid sequence encoding oriS 14 closely resembles the other mammalian chromosomal replication origins whose primary structures are known. It contains DNA binding sites for a large number of transcription factors, replication proteins, and mammalian oncogenes as well as several dinucleotide repeat motifs, an AT-rich region, and a sequence that is likely to bend the DNA. In contrast to the other well-characterized mammalian replication origins, which are autosomal and therefore carried as two copies per somatic cell, oriS 14 is encoded by single-copy DNA within a hemizygous segment of chromosome 2 q in CHO-K 1 cells. Also, other known mammalian replication origins are situated in nontranscribed, intergenic DNA, whereas the DNA sequence encoding oriS 14 substantially overlaps the transcribed portion of a constitutively expressed housekeeping gene...|$|R
40|$|Replication factors A and C (RF-A and RF-C) and the {{proliferating cell}} nuclear antigen (PCNA) {{differentially}} augment {{the activities of}} DNA polymerases alpha and delta. The mechanism of stimulation by these replication factors was investigated using a limiting concentration of primed, single-stranded template DNA. RF-A stimulated polymerase alpha activity in a concentration-dependent manner, but also suppressed nonspecific initiation of DNA synthesis by both polymerases alpha and delta. The primer recognition complex, RF-C. PCNA. ATP, stimulated pol delta activity in cooperation with RF-A, but also functioned to prevent abnormal initiation of DNA synthesis by polymerase alpha. Reconstitution of DNA replication with purified factors and a plasmid containing the SV 40 origin sequences directly demonstrated DNA polymerase alpha dependent synthesis of lagging strands and DNA polymerase delta/PCNA/RF-C dependent synthesis of leading strands. RF-A and the primer recognition complex both affected the relative levels of leading and lagging strands. These results, in addition to results in an accompanying paper (Tsurimoto, T., and Stillman, B. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 1950 - 1960), suggest that an exchange of DNA polymerase complexes occurs during initiation of <b>bidirectional</b> DNA <b>replication</b> at the SV 40 origin...|$|R

40|$|In the {{presence}} of emetine, an inhibitor of protein synthesis, nascent DNA on forward arms of replication forks in hamster cell lines containing either single or amplified copies of the DHFR gene region was enriched 5 - to 7 -fold over nascent DNA on retrograde arms. This forward arm bias was observed {{on both sides of}} the specific origin of <b>bidirectional</b> DNA <b>replication</b> located 17 kb downstream of the hamster DHFR gene (OBR- 1), consistent with at least 85 % of replication forks within this region emanating from OBR- 1. However, the replication fork asymmetry induced by emetine does not result from conservative nucleosome segregation, as previously believed, but from preferentially inhibiting Okazaki fragment synthesis on retrograde arms of forks to produce 'imbalanced DNA synthesis'. Three lines of evidence support this conclusion. First, the bias existed in long nascent DNA strands prior to nuclease digestion of non-nucleosomal DNA. Second, the fraction of RNA-primed Okazaki fragments was rapidly diminished. Third, electron microscopic analysis of SV 40 DNA replicating in {{the presence}} of emetine revealed forks with single-stranded DNA on one arm, and nucleosomes randomly distributed to both arms.

Recombinant plasmids containing a 251 -base-pair fragment of noncoding viral DNA replicate efficiently in MOP cells. Mutational analyses of these viral sequences revealed {{that they can be}} physically separated into two genetic elements. One of these elements, termed the core, contains an adenine-thymine-rich area, a 32 -base-pair guanine-cytosine-rich palindrome, and a large T antigen binding site, and likely includes the site from which <b>bidirectional</b> DNA <b>replication</b> initiates. The other, termed beta, is located adjacent to the core near the late region and is devoid of outstanding sequence features. Surprisingly, another sequence element named alpha, located adjacent to beta but outside the borders of the 251 -base-pair fragment, can functionally substitute for beta. This sequence too contains no readily recognized sequence features and possesses no obvious homology to the beta element. The three elements together occupy a contiguous noncoding stretch of DNA no more than 345 base pairs in length in the order alpha, beta, and core. These results indicate that the polyomavirus origin for DNA replication comprises multiple genetic elements...|$|R
40|$|SummaryChromosome ends are {{maintained}} by telomere-repeat-binding factors (TRFs) that coordinate DNA end protection with telomere replication [1, 2]. The origin recognition complex (ORC) coordinates <b>bidirectional</b> DNA <b>replication</b> at most chromosomal sites, {{but it is}} also known to function in transcriptional silencing, heterochromatin formation, and sister-chromatid cohesion [3, 4]. We now show that ORC localizes to telomere repeats and contributes to telomere maintenance. We found that ORC subunits can be affinity purified with telomere-repeat DNA along with other components of the known âshelterinâ complex. ORC subunits colocalized with telomere-repeat foci and coimmunoprecipitated with TRF 2 but not TRF 2 lacking its amino-terminal basic domain (TRF 2 ÎB). ORC 2 depletion or hypomorphic cell lines caused a loss of telomere-repeat signal intensity and the appearance of dysfunctional telomeres, including telomere-signal-free ends and telomere-repeat-containing double minutes. Two-dimensional agarose gel electrophoresis revealed that ORC 2 depletion increased telomere circle formation, comparable to the overexpression of TRF 2 ÎB. A similar increase in telomere circle formation was induced by hydroxyurea treatment, providing evidence that replication stress produces telomere circles. These findings suggest that ORC recruitment by TRF 2 contributes to telomere integrity by facilitating efficient telomere DNA replication and preventing the generation of telomere-repeat-containing circles...|$|R
