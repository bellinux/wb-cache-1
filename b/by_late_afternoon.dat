5|$|<b>By</b> <b>late</b> <b>afternoon</b> of 19 August, Canadian and Polish {{forces had}} {{linked with the}} US 80th Division and 90th Division already {{stationed}} in the town. The Falaise Gap had been closed, trapping Model′s forces. As the linkup occurred, Model′s II SS Panzer Corps had begun its counterattack against Polish forces on Hill 262, hoping to reopen the pocket. With American and Canadian forces facing German counterattacks in their sectors, the Polish forces would have to defend against two veteran Panzer divisions to keep the gap closed.|$|E
5|$|In early afternoon, Beauregard {{launched}} {{a series of}} counterattacks from the Shiloh Church area, aiming to control the Corinth Road. The Union right was temporarily driven back by these assaults at Water Oaks Pond. Crittenden, reinforced by Tuttle, seized the junction of the Hamburg-Purdy and East Corinth roads, driving the Confederates into Prentiss's old camps. Nelson resumed his attack and seized the heights overlooking Locust Grove Branch <b>by</b> <b>late</b> <b>afternoon.</b> Beauregard's final counterattack was flanked and repulsed when Grant moved Col. James C. Veatch's brigade forward.|$|E
5|$|At 10:00a.m., Coast Guard {{stations}} and United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Weather Bureau offices at Lake Superior ports raised white pennants above square red flags with black centers, indicating a storm warning with northwesterly winds. <b>By</b> <b>late</b> <b>afternoon,</b> the storm signal flags were {{replaced with a}} vertical sequence of red, white, and red lanterns, indicating that a hurricane with winds over 74mph (119km/h) was coming. (The word hurricane here does not refer to a tropical cyclone, but to Force 12 winds on the Beaufort scale.) The winds on Lake Superior had already reached 50mph (80km/h), and an accompanying blizzard was moving toward Lake Huron.|$|E
60|$|We {{left the}} city <b>by</b> a <b>late</b> <b>afternoon</b> train, and already {{twilight}} had ceased to linger. As we stepped blindly into the early winter darkness {{at the end of}} our short journey, the voice of Sidney Sanderson sounded pleasant and assuring.|$|R
50|$|As of 09:00 pm on September 17, Typhoon Man-yi had {{weakened}} to an extratropical cyclone off Hokkaido, where up to 150 mm of {{rain was}} projected {{to have fallen}} <b>by</b> <b>late</b> Tuesday <b>afternoon,</b> the agency said. The total damage loss were unknown, but {{it is said that}} the damage total was minimal.|$|R
2500|$|By 9 February, the Churchill fire complex {{was still}} burning out of control, with fronts through the Latrobe Valley and the Strzelecki Ranges. <b>By</b> <b>late</b> that <b>afternoon,</b> the complex had burnt out [...] and had killed eleven people. Wind changes that evening {{exacerbated}} {{parts of the}} Churchill complex, causing the CFA to issue further warnings to residents at Won Wron and surrounding areas.|$|R
5|$|At around 10:00am, the Israelis renewed the attack, {{moving toward}} Jebel Mariam, Abu 'Atwa and Nefisha. The paratroopers at Jebel Mariam became engaged in intense {{fighting}} but, with their advantageous position, {{were able to}} repel the attack <b>by</b> <b>late</b> <b>afternoon.</b> Meanwhile, the Israelis concentrated artillery and mortar fire against the Sa'iqa positions at Abu 'Atwa and Nefisha. At noon, advance Israeli elements engaged with a Sa'iqa reconnaissance unit, and the Israelis lost two tanks and a half-track. At 1:00pm, an Israeli paratrooper company attacked Abu 'Atwa without first scouting ahead, and was ambushed and annihilated. The attack ended after paratroopers suffered over fifty casualties and lost four tanks.|$|E
5|$|<b>By</b> <b>late</b> <b>afternoon</b> Béxar was {{occupied}} by about 1,500 Mexican soldiers. When the Mexican troops raised a blood-red flag signifying no quarter, Travis responded with a blast from the Alamo's largest cannon. Believing that Travis had acted hastily, Bowie sent Jameson to meet with Santa Anna. Travis was angered that Bowie had acted unilaterally and sent his own representative, Captain Albert Martin. Both emissaries met with Colonel Juan Almonte and José Bartres. According to Almonte, the Texians asked for an honorable surrender but were informed that any surrender must be unconditional. On learning this, Bowie and Travis mutually agreed to fire the cannon again.|$|E
5|$|On D-Day, II./JG 1 {{received}} {{orders to}} transfer west from their base near Störmede. 32 Fw 190A-8s took off {{under the command}} of Oberleutnant Eder, and headed for Essay. <b>By</b> <b>late</b> <b>afternoon</b> all the aircraft landed at Montdidier. News that their original destination had been bombed meant a diversion to Le Mans. The newly added Staffel 7./JG 51 (later 8./JG 1) was attacked by Mustangs near Le Mans, Lt. Johann Brünnler being shot down and killed. I./JG 1 and II./JG 1, along with II./JG 53, were based at Le Mans with a complement of 100 Fw 190s and Bf 109s.|$|E
50|$|<b>By</b> <b>late</b> Sunday <b>afternoon,</b> {{the police}} already {{suspected}} Rainey Bethea after several residents of Owensboro {{stated that they}} had previously seen Bethea wearing the ring. Since Bethea had a criminal record, the police {{were able to use}} what was then a new identification technique - fingerprints - to establish that Bethea had recently touched items inside the bedroom. Throughout the next four days, the police searched for the murderer.|$|R
50|$|By 1:30 pm, the State Emergency Service {{had responded}} to 140 calls for help, this {{increased}} to 200 calls by 3:45 pm. <b>By</b> the <b>late</b> <b>afternoon,</b> over 1,000 calls for help had been received, with just over 800 originating from the Melbourne metro area. By 7:00 pm, around 2,500 calls had been received, mostly from residents whose roofs had collapsed and houses that had flooded. Throughout the entire weekend of 6 and 7 March, over 3,500 calls for help were received.|$|R
50|$|Supported by {{artillery}} and air strikes, India Company enveloped the PAVN's flank, and the Marines soon gained the upper hand. <b>By</b> the <b>late</b> <b>afternoon</b> the Marines had overrun the last PAVN positions, counting PAVN 118 dead for a Marine loss of 38 killed and 82 wounded. The Marine and ARVN forces swept {{the area for}} the next three days but contacts declined as the PAVN withdrew from the area. Concluding that the enemy had been routed, the ARVN ended their part of the operation.|$|R
5|$|Unaware of {{the exact}} {{location}} of the blockading squadron, Decatur set a course to avoid them and seek a safe port, but approximately two hours later the squadron's sails were spotted on the horizon. President changed course to outrun them, but the damage she suffered the night before had significantly reduced her speed. Attempting to gain speed, Decatur ordered expendable cargo thrown overboard; <b>by</b> <b>late</b> <b>afternoon</b> of 15January, HMS Endymion under Captain Henry Hope came alongside and proceeded to fire broadsides. Decatur planned to bring President in close to Endymion, whereby Presidents crew could board and capture the opposing ship and sail her to New York. (President would be scuttled to prevent her capture).|$|E
5|$|At 09:50 on 23 August, a U.S. PBY Catalina {{flying boat}} (based at Ndeni in the Santa Cruz Islands) {{initially}} sighted Tanaka's convoy. <b>By</b> <b>late</b> <b>afternoon,</b> with no further sightings of Japanese ships, two aircraft strike forces from Saratoga and Henderson Field took off {{to attack the}} convoy. However, Tanaka, knowing that an attack would be forthcoming following the PBY sighting, reversed course once he had departed the area, and eluded the strike aircraft. After Tanaka reported to his superiors his loss of time by turning north to avoid the expected Allied airstrike, the landings of his troops on Guadalcanal was pushed back to 25 August. By 18:23 on 23 August, with no Japanese carriers sighted and no new intelligence reporting of {{their presence in the}} area, Fletcher detached Wasp (which was getting low on fuel) and the rest of TF18 for the two-day trip south toward Efate Island to refuel. Thus, Wasp and her escorting warships missed the upcoming battle.|$|E
5|$|The Germans {{attacked}} at dawn {{under the}} cover of fog, but other than one small penetration by a German company in the early morning which was quickly resolved, partly due to the gallantry of Sergeant Stanley McDougall of the Australian 47th Battalion, the Germans failed to break through the Allied defences. McDougall was later awarded the Victoria Cross for his actions during the battle, the highest award that could be received by an Australian soldier for gallantry {{in the face of the}} enemy. <b>By</b> <b>late</b> <b>afternoon,</b> rain was setting in, making early renewal of the assault less likely. The Germans suffered about 550 casualties during the battle, with the Australians losing around 137 killed or wounded. In the following week, the Germans renewed attempts to advance in the sector, culminating in the Second Battle of Dernancourt on 5 April, in which the Germans were defeated in desperate fighting.|$|E
25|$|The final go-ahead {{was given}} <b>by</b> Reagan <b>late</b> that <b>afternoon</b> while {{returning}} to Washington on Air Force One. McFarlane contacted Poindexter who alerted the Pentagon. Orders were sent across the Atlantic to {{the aircraft carrier}} USS Saratoga and her aircraft made ready for the intercept.|$|R
25|$|Portable pumps {{were used}} to remove water from the city. The {{estimated}} area of flooding was reduced to 60%. <b>By</b> <b>late</b> Tuesday <b>afternoon,</b> 3 of the 148 permanent pumps had been restored to operation. Important steps in returning more pumps to operation include repairing breaches in the London Avenue and Industrial canals. Repair of the London Avenue breach was estimated to require two weeks. Steps in repairing the Industrial canal breach include removal of two damaged barges and one that had sunk.|$|R
50|$|In March 13, the Adil Khan {{ordered a}} decisive assault across the river, {{under the command}} of a Turk, Suleimão Agá. 9,000 men waded across the river either by foot or on small crafts and many reached the {{opposite}} banks, but came under heavy fire from Portuguese ships, artillery batteries and arquebuses, until they were finally shattered by a Portuguese counter-attack {{under the command of}} Luís de Melo and Dom Fernando de Monroy, who landed a force of 300 men in the opposite shore, killing about 3,000 enemies. <b>By</b> the <b>late</b> <b>afternoon,</b> a strong storm spelled the end of the assault.|$|R
5|$|The {{assistant}} US divisional commander, Brigadier General William A. McCulloch, {{arrived in}} the afternoon to begin directing the battle on Hill 206, and afterwards reinforcements {{in the form of}} flamethrower teams from the 132nd Infantry Regiment also arrived. In the afternoon American forces attempted to regain the South Knob. While this effort was initially successful and led to the extraction of several American soldiers who had been isolated on the position, <b>by</b> <b>late</b> <b>afternoon</b> the US units had been forced to withdraw to the North Knob. The fighting on Hill 206 died down in the evening of 11March as neither the Japanese nor US forces attempted any offensive action, although Muda took the opportunity to concentrate his forces completely in occupation of the South Knob and established several pillboxes overnight.|$|E
5|$|Reconstructions of the {{eruption}} {{and its effects}} vary considerably in the details but have the same overall features. The eruption lasted two days. The morning {{of the first day}} was perceived as normal by the only eyewitness to leave a surviving document, Pliny the Younger. In {{the middle of the day}} an explosion threw up a high-altitude column from which ash and pumice began to fall, blanketing the area. Rescues and escapes occurred during this time. At some time in the night or early the next day pyroclastic surges in the close vicinity of the volcano began. Lights were seen on the peak interpreted as fires. People as far away as Misenum fled for their lives. The flows were rapid-moving, dense and very hot, knocking down wholly or partly all structures in their path, incinerating or suffocating all population remaining there and altering the landscape, including the coastline. These were accompanied by additional light tremors and a mild tsunami in the Bay of Naples. <b>By</b> <b>late</b> <b>afternoon</b> of the second day, {{the eruption}} was over, leaving only haze in the atmosphere through which the sun shone weakly.|$|E
5|$|At 08:20 on {{the morning}} of 25 July the Chinese again {{assaulted}} the US Marines on Hill 119 in company strength but were soon halted by American artillery and mortar fire which inflicted heavy losses; skirmishing continued {{for the remainder of the}} day. While no major assaults against Hill 111 occurred, a heavy barrage by the Chinese targeted the position at 11:00. F9F Panthers provided air support to the Marines throughout the day, while American tanks continued to engage Chinese targets in support of the defenders on Hill 111 and Boulder City. Finally, at 13:35 the last of the Chinese infantry were forced off the forward slopes of Boulder City by the US Marines. Chinese casualties were estimated by the Americans to have included another 75 killed and 425 wounded. The Chinese continued to heavily shell the American positions, and <b>by</b> <b>late</b> <b>afternoon</b> 13,500 mortar and artillery rounds had fallen on the sector held by US 7th Marine Regiment. The Americans fired many counter-battery missions in response, firing 36,794 rounds. The ongoing relief of the US 7th Marine Regiment continued throughout the day. Meanwhile, the Australian positions on The Hook were also heavily shelled throughout the day, forcing many of the defenders underground into the network of tunnels then being extended by a team of New Zealand sappers.|$|E
50|$|In 2005, Patterson {{rejoined the}} Yankees {{and worked as}} {{pitching}} coach for Triple-A Columbus Clippers, being reassigned to the GCL Yankees from 2006 to 2007. Patterson had asked for the assignment {{to work in the}} Gulf Coast minor league farm team, where there are no overnight trips and the schedule allowed him to be home <b>by</b> the <b>late</b> <b>afternoon.</b> At that time, Patterson decided he had to stay home to be close to his 7-year-old son, who had been diagnosed with Tourette syndrome, a condition of the nervous system characterized by involuntary, uncontrolled movements and vocalizations called tics.|$|R
50|$|May 27: Battle of Shanhai Pass. At dawn Dorgon's main army {{reaches the}} gates of Shanhaiguan, where Dorgon {{receives}} Wu Sangui's formal surrender. The armies deploy for battle: placed in the vanguard, Wu's troops are ordered to charge the Shun army, but {{they are unable to}} break the rebels' line and suffer heavy casualties. <b>By</b> the <b>late</b> <b>afternoon,</b> they {{are on the verge of}} defeat when a sandstorm starts blowing on the battlefield. Dorgon chooses this moment to intervene: galloping around Wu's right flank, Qing bannermen destroys Li's left wing. The Shun army is defeated and retreats chaotically toward Yongping; thousands are massacred.|$|R
5000|$|Tanner's Sand Dunes at Sunset, Atlantic City (c. 1885 oil on canvas) {{hangs in}} the Green Room at the White House; {{it is the first}} {{painting}} by an African-American artist to be purchased for the permanent collection of the White House. The painting is a landscape with a [...] "view across the cool gray of a shadowed beach to dunes made pink <b>by</b> the <b>late</b> <b>afternoon</b> sunlight.

[...] It was purchased for $100,000 by the White House Endowment Fund during the Bill Clinton administration from Dr. Rae Alexander-Minter, grandniece of the artist.|$|R
5|$|Night {{was welcomed}} by the German and Polish forces {{surrounding}} Mont Ormel. Fighting was sporadic, as both sides avoided contact with one another. Frequent Polish artillery barrages interrupted German attempts {{to retreat from}} the sector. In the morning, German attacks on the position resumed. Although not as coordinated as on the day before, the attack still managed to reach {{the last of the}} Polish defenders on Mont Ormel. As the remaining Polish forces repelled the assault, their tanks were forced to use the last of their ammunition. At approximately 12:00, the last SS remnants launched a final assault on the positions of the 9th Battalion. Polish forces defeated them at point-blank range. There would be no further attacks; the two battlegroups of the Polish 1st Armoured Division had survived the onslaught, despite being surrounded by German forces for three days. Both Reynolds and McGilvray place the Polish losses on the Maczuga at 351 killed and wounded and 11 tanks lost, although Jarymowycz gives higher figures of 325 killed, 1,002 wounded, and 114 missing — approximately 20% of the division's combat strength. Within an hour, The Canadian Grenadier Guards managed to link up with what remained of Stefanowicz's men. <b>By</b> <b>late</b> <b>afternoon,</b> the remainder of the 2nd and 9th SS Panzer Divisions had begun their retreat to the Seine River. The Falaise Gap had been permanently closed, with a large number of German forces still trapped in the pocket.|$|E
5|$|That night, the Japanese made a minor {{attack against}} 'C' Company, {{but this was}} turned back with {{artillery}} and small arms. The following day the Australians resumed their attack. In doing so, McKinna ordered 'D' Company to renew the assault, aiming for Pear Hill, on the right hand side of the Australian line. Although it required a more physically draining approach march over Artillery Hill and through dense scrub, the tactic {{proved to be more}} successful than the previous day's efforts. Pear Hill was joined by a narrow razorback ridge that limited the Australian frontage to just three men side-by-side, who had to cut their way through the thick bamboo with machetes. Weighed down with full marching order and heavy weapons, including Vickers machine guns, the Australians found it heavy going. It took the majority of the afternoon to reach {{the crest of the hill}} where they were to form up for the final assault. A thirty-minute pause followed, after which an artillery barrage was called down upon the Japanese defenders. On their right, 'A' Company, began to draw the Japanese fire and at 15:30 hours 'D' Company attacked the ridge, across a thin saddle. <b>By</b> <b>late</b> <b>afternoon,</b> the Japanese defenders had pulled back from the ridge, leaving the Australians in possession of it after heavy fighting with 'D' Company securing the main position, while 'B' Company skirted north of Barton's Knoll and secured a secondary position below the ridge, which the Australians dubbed Baker's Brow. Meanwhile, on the Australian left—the western side of the battlefield—a Juki heavy machine and snipers held up 'C' Company's advance.|$|E
25|$|The area {{experiences}} {{a sunny day}} until the second storm arrives, dropping temperatures to the 20s, which causes the ground to briefly freeze on the surface during the morning and thaw <b>by</b> <b>late</b> <b>afternoon.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The fire {{resulted}} in temporary closures {{of several of}} the San Fernando Valley's major freeways, including the Golden State Freeway (Interstate 5) at the Newhall Pass, the Foothill Freeway (Interstate 210) from I-5 through Sylmar, the Simi Valley-San Fernando Valley Freeway (California State Route 118), the San Diego Freeway (Interstate 405) at Route 118 and the Antelope Valley Freeway (California State Route 14) from south Santa Clarita to the Newhall Pass. [...] <b>By</b> the <b>late</b> <b>afternoon</b> on November 15, 2008, the California Highway Patrol announced the re-opening of the freeways closed due to the Sayre fire.|$|R
5000|$|Although {{the hotel}} survived the initial {{damage from the}} early morning April 18, 1906, San Francisco earthquake, <b>by</b> <b>late</b> that <b>afternoon</b> it had been {{consumed}} by the subsequent fires. Notably, tenor Enrico Caruso (who had sung the role of Don José in Carmen the night before) was staying in the hotel {{at the time of}} the quake, and swore never to return to the city. The urban legend is Caruso, [...] "stood in his nightshirt holding a personally autographed photograph of President Theodore Roosevelt and demanded special treatment." ...|$|R
25|$|The Syrian army killed 28 people <b>by</b> the <b>late</b> <b>afternoon,</b> {{including}} 9 in Hama. At {{the same}} time, the conflict has started {{moving into the}} two largest cities (Damascus and Aleppo) that the government claimed was being dominated by the silent majority, which wanted stability, not government change. In both places {{there has been a}} revival of the protest movement in its peaceful dimension. Shopkeepers across the capital staged a general strike and in several Aleppo commercial districts mounted a similar but smaller protest. This has been interpreted by some as indicating that the historical alliance {{between the government and the}} business establishment in the large cities has become weak.|$|R
25|$|<b>By</b> <b>late</b> <b>afternoon,</b> Freikorps {{ammunition}} {{was running}} low. Calling truce, Berthold negotiated a safe passage {{for those of}} his men who would disarm. At about 18:00 hours, the Freikorps filed out of the schoolhouse to disarm. A crowd of onlookers had not {{been part of the}} negotiations. They were outraged by the civilian casualties, and they mobbed the Freikorps.|$|E
25|$|More tornadoes {{occurred}} on June 23. A volatile setup for severe thunderstorms was realized in far southeast Saskatchewan <b>by</b> <b>late</b> <b>afternoon</b> {{and resulted in}} two long lived supercells that moved southeast into southwest Manitoba and eventually far northeast North Dakota by nightfall. At least five tornadoes were reported, including a significant wedge tornado near Pipestone, MB that was rated F3 on the Fujita scale after inflicting substantial damage to some rural homes.|$|E
25|$|As {{troops of}} the 92nd Division {{streamed}} back, they were ordered to take up positions on the left flank of the Indian positions.
