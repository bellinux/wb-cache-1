25|$|In {{addition}} to enabling professional advancement, what he encountered in Chicago changed Blount's personal outlook. The city was {{a center of}} African-American political activism and fringe movements, with <b>Black</b> <b>Muslims,</b> Black Hebrews, and others proselytizing, debating, and printing leaflets or books. Blount absorbed it all and was fascinated with the city's many ancient Egyptian-styled buildings and monuments. He read books such as George G.M. James's Stolen Legacy (which argued that classical Greek philosophy had its roots in ancient Egypt). Blount concluded that the accomplishments and history of Africans had been systematically suppressed and denied by European cultures.|$|E

However, after he won the championship from Liston in 1964, the Nation of Islam was more receptive and agreed to publicize his membership. Shortly afterwards, Elijah Muhammad recorded a statement that Clay would be renamed Muhammad (one who is worthy of praise) Ali (most high). Around that time Ali moved to {{the south side of}} Chicago and lived in a series of houses, always near the Nation of Islam's Mosque Maryam or Elijah Muhammad's residence.

25|$|The {{second largest}} is the {{community}} {{under the leadership}} of W.Deen Mohammed or the American Society of Muslims with 19% of mosques, mostly African-Americans having an affiliation with it. It was the successor organization to the Nation of Islam, once better-known as the <b>Black</b> <b>Muslims.</b> The association recognizes the leadership of Warith Deen Mohammed. This group evolved from the Black separatist Nation of Islam (1930–1975). The majority of its members are African Americans. This has been a 23-year process of religious reorientation and organizational decentralization, in the course of which the group was known by other names, such as the American Muslim Mission, W.Deen Mohammed guided its members to the practice of mainstream Islam such as salat or fasting, and teaching the basic creed of Islam the shahadah.|$|E
25|$|According to George Johnson, LaRouche sees {{history as}} a battle between Platonists, who believe in {{absolute}} truth, and Aristotelians, who rely on empirical data. Johnson characterizes LaRouche's views as follows: the Platonists include figures such as Beethoven, Mozart, Shakespeare, Leonardo da Vinci, and Leibniz. He believes {{that many of the}} world's ills result from the dominance of Aristotelianism as embraced by the empirical philosophers (such as Hobbes, Locke, Berkeley, and Hume), leading to a culture that favors the empirical over the metaphysical, embraces moral relativism, and seeks to keep the general population uninformed. Industry, technology, and classical music should be used to enlighten the world, LaRouche argues, whereas the Aristotelians use psychotherapy, drugs, rock music, jazz, environmentalism, and quantum theory to bring about a new dark age in which the world will be ruled by the oligarchs. Left and right are false distinctions for LaRouche; what matters is the Platonic versus Aristotelian outlook, a position that has led him to form relationships with groups as disparate as farmers, nuclear engineers, <b>Black</b> <b>Muslims,</b> Teamsters and pro-life advocates.|$|E

25|$|According to Pew Forum {{estimate}} in 2016 {{there are}} 3.3 million Muslims, comprising about 1% {{of the total}} U.S. population. A Pew Forum report on American religion found that Muslims accounted for 0.9% of American adults in 2014, up from 0.4% in 2007, due largely to immigration. Retention rates were high, at 77%, similar to Hindus (80%) and Jews (75%); most people who leave these religions become unaffiliated, although ex-Muslims {{were more likely to}} be Christians than ex-Hindus or ex-Jews were. Conversely, 23% of American Muslims were converts, including 8% from historically black Protestant traditions, 6% from being unaffiliated, 4% from Catholicism, and 3% from mainline or evangelical Protestantism. By race, in 2014, 38% were non-Hispanic white (including Arabs and Iranians, up from 32% in 2007), 28% were Asian (mostly Indians, Pakistanis, and Bangladeshis, up from 20% in 2007), 28% were black (down from 32%), 4% Hispanic (down from 7%), and 3% of mixed or other race (down from 7%). Since 2007, the black proportion had shrunk, while the white and Asian proportions had grown, mainly due to immigration as most <b>black</b> <b>Muslims</b> were native U.S. blacks.|$|E

2500|$|Prior to his {{pilgrimage to}} Mecca, Malcolm X {{believed}} that African Americans must {{develop their own}} society and ethical values, including the self-help, community-based enterprises, that the <b>black</b> <b>Muslims</b> supported.

He prophetically believed that there [...] "would be bloodshed" [...] if the racism problem in America remained ignored, and he renounced [...] "compromise" [...] with whites. In April 1964, Malcolm X participated in a Hajj (pilgrimage to Mecca); Malcolm found himself restructuring his views and recanted several extremist opinions during his shift to mainstream Islam.|$|E

On November 22, 1965, in yet another attempt {{to be the first}} to win the world heavyweight title three times, Patterson lost by technical knockout at the end of the 12th round, going into the fight with an injured sacro-iliac joint in a bout in which Ali was clearly dominant. Ali called Patterson an [...] "Uncle Tom" [...] for refusing to call him Muhammad Ali (Patterson continued to call him Cassius Clay) and for this outspokenness against <b>black</b> <b>Muslims.</b> Instead of scoring a quick knockout, Ali mocked, humiliated and punished Patterson throughout the fight before knocking him out in the 12th round.|$|E
2500|$|After World War I, white {{veterans}} {{trying to}} return to their civilian jobs found African-American and Eastern European immigrants in their former positions. Their resentment led to several violent strikes in the South Omaha meat packing industry as groups tried to control access to jobs. During this period, Earl Little was a Baptist minister in North Omaha. After his son, Malcolm, was born in Omaha in 1925, the family moved away because of threats by the Ku Klux Klan in 1926.

2500|$|Often the {{minister}} reads passages from well-known historical, sociological, or anthropological works, and finds in them inconspicuous {{references to the}} Blackman’s true history in the world.... Occasionally {{the minister}} chides the audience for its scepticism: “I know you don't believe me because I {{happen to be a}} Black man. Well, you can look it up in a book I’m {{going to tell you about}} that was written by a white man.” He then reads off references that his hearers are challenged to check for themselves. A single documented statement, however, may become the basis of a wide range of generalized non-sequiturs. The fact that a North Carolina slaveholder had an Arabic-speaking Muslim slave of unusual mathematical ability may be offered as evidence that all slaves brought to America were Moslem, Arabic-speaking, and learned. Similarly, historical facts may be indiscriminately mingled with myths and countermyths. (The <b>Black</b> <b>Muslims</b> in America, pp. 120–121) ...|$|E

40|$|By using {{clothing}} practices, {{the thesis}} illustrates how we become <b>Black</b> <b>Muslim</b> women {{in relation to}} a multitude of objects, bodies, gazes and spaces. This contributes to research within critical race studies on the performance and production of racialised bodies across different spaces. Specifically, the thesis asks what analytical tools can be developed to understand how <b>Black</b> <b>Muslim</b> women negotiate presentations beyond a fixed categorisation of our beings and how clothing practices highlight different experiences of being <b>Black</b> <b>Muslim</b> women across a multitude of spaces. This extends work on the territorialisation of the body, emotional and affective geographies, performativity and material culture, as well as visual studies through phenomenological readings of race. Building these fields through the lens of <b>Black</b> <b>Muslim</b> stylisation illustrates how centring <b>Black</b> <b>Muslim</b> women in Britain provides the opportunity to develop new and critical knowledges on the co-production of different bodies, gazes and spaces within Social Geography. I explore how we perform our beings through the use of clothes journals and semi-structured interviews (based on Black feminist dialogue) with 21 <b>Black</b> <b>Muslim</b> women in Manchester and Sheffield. These methods (along with the research design and analysis) speak from and build upon a wider ethical commitment to reflexively build knowledge with <b>Black</b> <b>Muslim</b> women, and to challenge spaces of knowledge production and legitimisation that have excluded and/or objectified this diversity of beings across different spaces. To highlight these experiences of being, there are three analytical tools that come in and out of focus throughout the project; comfort, layering and visibility are developed within the interludes running between the empirical chapters. Meanwhile, the empirical chapters expand on our beings as shifting in relation to our presentations across three spaces (home, prayer and work). Home clothing illustrates how boundaries around the body shifts as we interact with different bodies (and boundaries) in and around the home. The clothes used for prayer speaks to the relationship between layering and prayer’s brief (and racialised) temporality: even after the material layer used for prayer is removed, the performance of prayer remains part of our overarching beings. Finally, I use work outfits to think through the clothing practices used to ‘fit’ into (i. e. negotiate visibility within) different spaces. By framing this thesis through the geographies of <b>Black</b> <b>Muslim</b> women, I extend research on how bodies are produced and shift across different spaces. This highlights different experiences of being across a multitude of spaces, and challenges a homogeneous and static reading of <b>Black</b> (and) <b>Muslim</b> women as Other to a white Self...|$|R
