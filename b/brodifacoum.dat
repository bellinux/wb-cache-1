25|$|Mouse and rat poison* {{ingestion}} {{is common}} in dogs. Most rodenticides in the United States are anticoagulant by depleting Vitamin K. This type is the most frequent cause of poisoning in pets. Third generation products contain <b>brodifacoum</b> or bromadiolone and are toxic after a single ingestion. Signs include spontaneous and excessive bleeding internally and externally. Treatment is with Vitamin K supplementation. Other rodenticides may contain cholecalciferol which causes hypercalcemia and leads to heart and kidney problems. Newer rodenticides may contain bromethalin which causes central nervous system signs such as seizures, muscle tremors, and depression.|$|E
500|$|The black rats were a major {{disruption}} to {{the local}} wildlife on Anacapa Island and are still a problem on San Miguel Island. [...] The black rats were successfully eradicated from Anacapa Island by 2003, with a controversial program that involved an aerial application of the rodenticide <b>brodifacoum,</b> the first such eradication in the United States. [...] The program cost nearly $1 million.|$|E
500|$|The use of {{warfarin}} {{itself as}} a rat poison is now declining, because many rat populations have developed resistance to it, and poisons of considerably greater potency are now available. Other 4-hydroxycoumarins used as rodenticides include coumatetralyl and <b>brodifacoum,</b> which is {{sometimes referred to as}} [...] "super-warfarin", because it is more potent, longer-acting, and effective even in rat and mouse populations that are resistant to warfarin. Unlike warfarin, which is readily excreted, newer anticoagulant poisons also accumulate in the liver and kidneys after ingestion. [...] However, such rodenticides may also accumulate in birds of prey and other animals that eat the poisoned rodents or baits.|$|E
500|$|The [...] "three now {{cosmopolitan}} commensal rodent pest species" [...] (the brown rat, {{the black}} rat {{and the house}} mouse) have been dispersed in association with humans, partly on sailing ships in the Age of Exploration, and with a fourth species in the Pacific, the Polynesian rat (Rattus exulans), have severely damaged island biotas around the world. For example, when the black rat reached Lord Howe Island in 1918, over 40 percent of the terrestrial bird species of the island, including the Lord Howe fantail, became extinct within ten years. Similar destruction has been seen on Midway Island (1943) and Big South Cape Island (1962). Conservation projects can with careful planning completely eradicate these pest rodents from islands using an anticoagulant rodenticide such as <b>brodifacoum.</b> This approach has been successful {{on the island of}} Lundy in the United Kingdom, where the eradication of an estimated 40,000 brown rats is giving populations of Manx shearwater and Atlantic puffin a chance to recover from near-extinction.|$|E
2500|$|The United States Department of Agriculture’s Animal and Plant Inspection Service {{announced}} it will {{use a combination of}} two poisons, diphacinone and <b>brodifacoum,</b> to kill off the rodents on [...] Cocos Island (Guam). They will also attempt to lower the mangrove monitor population on Cocos Island by 80%, using several trapping methods proposed by herpetologist Seamus Ehrhard, as the lizard is believed to prey upon the endangered Guam rail (Gallirallus owstoni). Most locals, however, do not see the monitor as an invasive species and a few activists are opposed to the attempt to lower the population there.|$|E
2500|$|Rats, {{brought to}} the island as stowaways on sealing and whaling ships in the late 18th century, have caused much damage to native wildlife, {{destroying}} {{tens of millions of}} ground-nesting birds’ eggs and chicks. While previously the island's glaciers formed a natural barrier to the spread of rats, these glaciers are now slowly melting as the climate warms. In 2011, scientists instituted a four-year programme to entirely eradicate the rats and mice, in what would be by far the largest rodent eradication attempt in the world to date. The project was led by zoologist Anthony Martin of The University of Dundee who stated, [...] "This is a man-induced problem and it's about time that man put right earlier errors." [...] In July 2013, the success of the main phase of the extermination of the rats, which took place in May that year, was announced. 180 tonnes of rat poison, <b>brodifacoum,</b> were dropped over 70% of the island, in what was the world's largest ever operation of this kind. Another 95t of rat poison was planned to be dropped by three helicopters in January 2015. In June 2015 the eradication programme concluded, apparently successfully, with the island believed [...] "very likely" [...] to be rat free. Monitoring will continue for a further two or three years.|$|E

5000|$|Following are acute [...] {{values for}} a variety of animals:Given these {{extremely}} high toxicities in various mammals, <b>brodifacoum</b> is classified as [...] "extremely toxic" [...] (LD50 < 1.0 mg/kg b.w.) and [...] "very toxic" [...] (T+; LD50 < 25 mg/kg b.w.), respectively. Because of its persistency, cumulative potential and high toxicities for various wildlife species, it is also considered an environmental pollutant (N; noxious to the environment).The readiness of <b>brodifacoum</b> to penetrate intact skin should be noted, and <b>brodifacoum</b> and commercial preparations containing it should be handled with respective care and precaution because of its skin resorptivity.|$|E

50|$|A 48-year-old {{businessman}} {{was admitted}} {{with a severe}} nosebleed as well as abnormal coagulation parameters. Standard treatment of Vitamin K and fresh plasma was administered to stem the nosebleed. Two weeks later he presented again with bleeding into the calf. Continual doses of Vitamin K were necessary to counteract the <b>Brodifacoum.</b> He denied taking any of the <b>Brodifacoum</b> found in his home contained within packages of Contrac.|$|E
50|$|<b>Brodifacoum</b> {{inhibits}} {{the enzyme}} vitamin K epoxide reductase. This enzyme {{is needed for}} the reconstitution of the vitamin K in its cycle from vitamin K-epoxide, and so <b>brodifacoum</b> steadily decreases the level of active vitamin K in the blood. Vitamin K {{is required for the}} synthesis of important substances including prothrombin, which is involved in blood clotting. This disruption becomes increasingly severe until the blood effectively loses any ability to clot. In addition, <b>brodifacoum</b> (as with other anticoagulants in toxic doses) increases permeability of blood capillaries; the blood plasma and blood itself begins to leak from the smallest blood vessels. A poisoned animal will suffer progressively worsening internal bleeding, leading to shock, loss of consciousness, and eventually death.|$|E
50|$|<b>Brodifacoum</b> {{is highly}} lethal to mammals and birds, and {{extremely}} lethal to fish. It {{is a highly}} cumulative poison, due to its high lipophilicity and extremely slow elimination.|$|E
50|$|In one report, a woman {{deliberately}} consumed over 1.5 {{kilograms of}} rat bait, constituting about 75 mg <b>brodifacoum,</b> but made {{a full recovery}} after receiving conventional medical treatment.|$|E
5000|$|Prior to 2015, d-CON {{primarily}} {{used two}} active {{ingredients in the}} bait products. In the rat bait pellets, mouse bait pellets, place packs, and wedge baits, the active ingredient was <b>brodifacoum,</b> typically at 0.005% concentration. [...] In contrast, earlier d-CON products that used warfarin had 0.5% concentration. [...] In the refillable and disposable bait stations, the active ingredient was (and still is) diphacinone. [...] The use of <b>brodifacoum</b> was discontinued {{at the end of}} 2014 following an agreement with the EPA, and was replaced with less potent first-generation vitamin K anticoagulants such as diphacinone.|$|E
50|$|<b>Brodifacoum</b> is a {{derivative}} of the 4-hydroxy-coumarin group. Compound 1 {{is the starting}} ester needed to synthesize <b>brodifacoum.</b> To obtain this starting compound a simple Wittig condensation of ethyl chloroacetate with 4’-bromobiphenylcarboxaldehyde was accomplished. Compound 1 was transformed into 2 by consecutive hydrolysis, halogenation to form an acid chloride, and then reacted with the required lithium anion. This was done using KOH and EtOH for hydrolysis, and then adding SOCl2 for chlorination to form the acid chloride which reacted {{with the addition of}} lithium anion. Compound 2 was then transformed using organocopper chemistry to yield compound 3 with good regioselectivity of about 98%. Typically a Friedel-Crafts type cyclization would be utilized to obtain the two ring system portion of compound 4, but there were issues of low yield. Instead trifluoromethanesulfonic acid in dry benzene catalyzed the cyclization in good yield. The ketone was then reduced with sodium borohydride yielding a benzyl alcohol. Condensation with 4-hydroxycoumarin under HCl yielded compound 5, <b>brodifacoum.</b>|$|E

50|$|Conturbatia crenata is {{possibly}} extinct. The last record {{of this species}} alive was in 2000. It is thought, that the population of Conturbatia crenata has been poisoned with rodenticide <b>Brodifacoum</b> in 2000.|$|E
5000|$|The primary {{antidote}} to <b>brodifacoum</b> poisoning is immediate administration of vitamin K1 (dosage for humans: initially slow intravenous injections of 10-25 mg repeated all 3-6 hours until normalisation of the prothrombin time; then 10 mg orally four times daily as a [...] "maintenance dose"). It {{is an extremely}} effective antidote, provided the poisoning is caught before excessive bleeding ensues. As high doses of <b>brodifacoum</b> can affect the body for many months, the antidote must be administered regularly {{for a long period}} (several months, in keeping with the substance's half-life) with frequent monitoring of the prothrombin time.|$|E
50|$|<b>Brodifacoum</b> has an {{especially}} long half-life in the body, which ranges to several months, requiring prolonged treatment with antidotal vitamin K for {{both human and}} pet poisonings. It {{has one of the}} highest risks of secondary poisoning to both mammals and birds.|$|E
50|$|<b>Brodifacoum</b> is {{a highly}} lethal 4-hydroxycoumarin vitamin K {{antagonist}} anticoagulant poison. In recent years, it {{has become one of}} the world's most widely used pesticides. It is typically used as a rodenticide but is also used to control larger pests such as possum.|$|E
50|$|In another report, a 17-year-old boy {{presented}} {{to the hospital with}} a severe bleeding disorder. It was discovered that he habitually smoked a mixture of <b>brodifacoum</b> and marijuana. Despite treatment with vitamin K, the bleeding disorder persisted for several months. He eventually recovered.|$|E
50|$|<b>Brodifacoum</b> is a second-generation anticoagulant. It is {{licensed}} {{for killing}} possums and rats. Like 1080, it will kill stoats that feed on poisoned animals. It {{has been successfully}} used in aerial operations to completely eradicate possums, rats, and stoats on several offshore islands and fenced ‘mainland islands’ that are now sanctuaries for endangered animals, {{but it is not}} currently registered in New Zealand for general aerial use on the mainland. <b>Brodifacoum</b> takes a very long time to break down in soil and water and accumulates in the tissue of exposed animals for years. Consequently, there is a very high risk of by-kill - it is known to have killed at least 21 species of native birds, including kiwi, kākā, kākāriki and tūī. It is also widely considered a very inhumane poison.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Brodifacoum</b> is a 4-hydroxycoumarin anticoagulant, with {{a similar}} mode of action to its {{historical}} predecessors dicoumarol and warfarin. However, due to very high potency and long duration of action (elimination half-life of 20 - 130 days), it is characterised as a [...] "second generation" [...] or [...] "superwarfarin" [...] anticoagulant.|$|E
50|$|After the {{identification}} of dicoumarol and its anticoagulant activity, it became the prototype for a class of drugs. 4-Hydroxycoumarin forms {{the core of the}} chemical structure of anticoagulants known collectively as 4-hydroxycoumarins. They include, for example, warfarin, a pharmaceutical drug used to prevent formation of blood clots, and <b>brodifacoum,</b> a widely used rodenticide.|$|E

50|$|Pest {{eradication}} commenced in August 2007 with {{shooting of}} goats and 800possums by ground-based teams. This was immediately {{followed by the}} scattering from aircraft of bait poisoned with <b>brodifacoum</b> into the fenced area.The trust's consent application states that when the valley is free of pests, {{the health of the}} forest will improve, leading to an increase in seedlings, flowers, seeds, invertebrates and thus increased food supply to birds (p4).|$|E
5000|$|In the mid-1970s, {{warfarin}} resistance {{began to}} appear in mice, which prompted a need for alternative rodenticides. [...] This led to the introduction of <b>brodifacoum</b> in 1975, followed by d-CON's introduction of it in the commercial market in the 1980s. [...] The compound works similarly to warfarin, but requires fewer doses. Additionally, it causes an unquenchable thirst, causing rats to leave the home in search of water before dying.|$|E
5000|$|In June 2009, {{the island}} was {{declared}} rat-free {{for the first time}} in 229 years, although the site will be continually monitored for another two years for confirmation. In the preceding autumn, helicopters dropped <b>brodifacoum</b> poison onto the island from buckets for a week, which eliminated the rat population. Signs show that several species of birds, including Aleutian cackling geese, ptarmigan, peregrine falcons, and black oystercatchers, are starting to nest again on the island. [...] However, the associated nontarget mortality, i.e., the deaths of animals other than the rats, was significant. [...] Some non-target mortality was expected, but the actual quantity greatly exceeded what was predicted. The Ornithological Council reported that more than 420 birds were killed as a result of the rat eradication program. Forty-six bald eagles died (exceeding the known population of 22 bald eagles on the island); toxicological analysis revealed lethal levels of <b>brodifacoum</b> in 12 of the 16 carcasses tested. Of the 320 glaucous-winged gull carcasses collected, toxicology tests implicated <b>brodifacoum</b> in 24 of the 34 tested. Fifty-four carcasses of another 25 bird species were found. The report found that the lead contractor which the FWS used, Island Conservation, had dropped more poisonous bait than they had proposed, including bait which was intended to be saved as a backup. The FWS asked the Ornithological Council to determine if Island Conservation had exceeded the limit of their poison quantities, but the council decided not to resolve any [...] "legal questions". , FWS law enforcement is still investigating. Steve Delehanty, the manager of the Alaska Maritime National Wildlife Refuge (which includes the island) said that, [...] "It was a learning experience, and we made mistakes together." [...] However, he also stated, [...] "...if you do the math this was a rip-roaring conservation success." ...|$|E
50|$|A 20-year-old female {{college student}} {{presented}} with abdominal pain and blood in urine. She was tested for warfarin, a common anticoagulant {{also used in}} some rodenticides, which returned a negative result. Vitamin K and fresh plasma was administered to treat symptoms. 3 weeks later she returned with bleeding into her calf, and was subsequently tested for superwarfarin chemicals. The test showed that <b>Brodifacoum</b> was in her bloodstream. She later admitted to consuming seven packets of rodenticide.|$|E
50|$|In some countries, fixed three-component rodenticides, i.e., {{anticoagulant}} + antibiotic + vitamin D, are used. Associations of a second-generation anticoagulant with {{an antibiotic}} and/or vitamin D {{are considered to}} be effective even against most resistant strains of rodents, though some second generation anticoagulants (namely <b>brodifacoum</b> and difethialone), in bait concentrations of 0.0025% to 0.005% are so toxic that resistance is unknown, and even rodents resistant to other rodenticides are reliably exterminated by application of these most toxic anticoagulants.|$|E
5000|$|In June 2014, Reckitt Benckiser and the EPA {{came to an}} {{agreement}} to end legal action.

5000|$|In 2011, RB {{initiated}} a legal {{challenge to the}} EPA ruling, saying alternatives were either less effective or more dangerous than <b>brodifacoum</b> [...] In 2013, the EPA passed a separate rule requiring rodent control products sold to consumers be in tamper-resistant bait stations, threatening to ban 12 d-CON products. [...] Early in 2014, California State Department of Pesticide Regulation ruled that anticoagulant rat poison sales would be restricted beginning on July 1, 2014. A suit was also filed to by RB to block the decision.|$|E
50|$|The {{pioneering}} {{eradication of}} brown rats, using <b>brodifacoum</b> in poison baits, {{was carried out}} by the New Zealand Department of Conservation (DOC) in May and June 1988 following the success of a pilot campaign on the adjacent, and much smaller (9 ha), Hāwea Island in 1986. Breaksea is six {{times the size of the}} previous largest island on which rat eradication had been successful.
