An SVR after 24 weeks off therapy of 75% was achieved in the group treated for 48 weeks with four weeks of lead-in therapy with peginterferon alfa-2b plus ribavirin followed by the addition of boceprivir.

Methods: In the UK context, we performed a budget impact analysis to estimate the average per patient cost of adding <b>boceprevir</b> or telaprevir to PEGylated interferon plus ribavirin therapy.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Genotype- 6 (gt 6) {{hepatitis}} C virus (HCV) {{is common}} amongst HCV-positive {{populations of the}} Asia Pacific region but cell culture models for this genotype have only recently been developed. <b>Boceprevir</b> (SCH 503034) is a clinically available inhibitor of the HCV NS 3 protein. We investigated the efficacy of <b>boceprevir</b> for inhibiting replication of a chimeric gt 1 b replicon encoding a gt 6 a NS 3 protease and defined the development of mutations in the protease when <b>boceprevir</b> treatment was applied. METHODS: We constructed a chimeric gt 1 b subgenomic replicon encoding a gt 6 NS 3 protease (NS 3 p) sequence (gt 6 NS 3 p_gt 1 b). The <b>boceprevir</b> EC 50 value against replication of this replicon was determined using quantitative reverse-transcriptase PCR. Next-generation sequencing was used to identify nucleotide changes associated with boceprevir-resistance. The replication capacities of chimeric replicons containing mutations associated with boceprevir-resistance were determined by colony formation efficiency assays. RESULTS: The <b>boceprevir</b> EC 50 value for the gt 6 NS 3 p_gt 1 b replicon was 535 nM± 79 nM. Boceprevir-resistant gt 6 NS 3 p_gt 1 b replicon cell lines could be selected and they demonstrated drug-associated amino acid changes that have previously been reported in other HCV genotypes. Interestingly, no mutations were observed at A 156, a position defined for <b>boceprevir</b> resistance in gt 1 NS 3 p, while mutation at N 122, which is rarely reported in boceprevir-resistant gt 1 proteases, was frequently observed. Re-introduction of these mutations into the chimeric replicon altered their replication capacity, ranging from complete abolishment of replication (A 156 T) to increasing replication capacity (V 36 A, N 122 S). This report provides the first characterisation of gt 6 HCV resistance to <b>boceprevir.</b> CONCLUSIONS: A chimeric HCV replicon encoding gt 6 NS 3 protease is sensitive to <b>boceprevir</b> and develops drug resistant mutations at amino acids sites previously reported for other genotypes.

40|$|Chronic {{hepatitis}} C {{infection is}} {{a leading cause of}} morbidity and mortality worldwide, with hepatitis C related cirrhosis being the most common indication for transplant and a major cause for the increase in hepatocellular carcinoma worldwide. Treatment for hepatitis C has consisted of nonspecific immunomodulatory therapies that stimulate the immune system and inhibit hepatitis C replication. Pegylated (peg-) interferon and ribavirin have been the standard of care with an overall sustained response rate of 40 – 50 % in patients with genotype 1 infection, and 80 % in genotype 2 or 3. Recently, direct-acting antiviral agents, including <b>boceprevir,</b> have demonstrated improved sustained response rates in patients with genotype 1 infection when given in combination with interferon and ribavirin. <b>Boceprevir</b> is a structurally novel hepatitis C virus (HCV) nonstructural 3 (NS 3) protease inhibitor that has demonstrated robust antiviral activity in HCV replicons. Clinically, in phase II and III trials, <b>boceprevir</b> 800 mg three times daily with peginterferon and ribavirin has led to improved sustained response rates in genotype 1 infection treatment-naive patients, relapsers, partial responders, and null responders.

Method: All patients who started treatment with triple therapy between March and September 2012 were included. Compliance the initiation criteria were assessed and whether the rules of discontinuation due to ineffectiveness were made. Results: 76 patients, 24 treated with <b>boceprevir</b> and 52 with telaprevir were included. In 11 patients (14. 5...|$|E
40|$|AbstractBackgroundWe {{investigated}} {{the frequency of}} RAVs among patients failing to achieve SVR in two clinical trials. We also {{investigated the}} impact of interferon responsiveness on RAVs and specific baseline RAVs relationship with <b>boceprevir</b> treatment failure. MethodsData are from 1020 patients enrolled into either SPRINT- 2 or RESPOND- 2; patients received a 4 -week PR lead-in prior to receiving <b>boceprevir</b> or placebo. RAVs were analyzed via population-based sequence analysis of the NS 3 protease gene (success rate of > 90 % at a virus level of ≥ 10, 000 IU/mL) ResultsThe high SVR rate in patients who received <b>boceprevir</b> resulted in a low rate of RAVs; 7 % was detected at baseline in all patients, which rose to 15 % after treatment. However, RAVs were detected in 53 % of patients that failed to achieve SVR, which declined to 22. 8 % 6 – 14 months following cessation of <b>boceprevir</b> therapy. Baseline RAVs alone were not predictive of virologic outcome; poor interferon responsiveness was highly predictive of non-SVR. RAVs were more frequently detected in poor interferon responders. ConclusionsWe detected no association between the presence of baseline amino acid variants at <b>boceprevir</b> resistance-associated loci and outcome {{in the context of}} good IFN response...|$|E
40|$|Canine {{distemper}} virus (CDV) {{is a major}} {{infectious disease}} of dogs. Although vaccines were successful to control CDV spread in canine population, the disease is still common and may {{pose a threat to}} unvaccinated dogs. In the attempt to develop specific anti-viral therapeutic tools, the efficacy of several molecules against CDV has been investigated in vitro. In this study the antiviral efficacy in vitro against CDV of ribavirin and <b>boceprevir</b> alone or in combination was evaluated. CDV growth in VERO cells was inhibited by ribavirin, by <b>boceprevir</b> and by {{a combination of the two}} molecules at non-cytotoxic concentrations, as evaluated by end-point viral titration in cell monolayers and by quantification of viral RNA using quantitative RT-PCR. By end-point titration, a statistically significant reduction in CDV replication was observed only using ribavirin and <b>boceprevir</b> in combination. By quantitative RT-PCR, a significant reduction of viral growth was observed either in cells treated with ribavirin or <b>boceprevir</b> or with both the two molecules. The association of ribavirin or <b>boceprevir</b> was able to decrease CDV growth by up to 3. 4458 logs with respect to untreated infected cells, chiefly at the highest virus dilutions. The results obtained in this study may constitute an important basis for the development of CDV therapies...|$|E
40|$|HCV- 796 is a nonnucleoside {{inhibitor}} of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) nonstructural protein 5 B (NS 5 B) polymerase, and <b>boceprevir</b> is an inhibitor of the NS 3 serine protease. The {{emergence of}} replicon variants {{resistant to the}} combination of HCV- 796 and <b>boceprevir</b> was evaluated. Combining the inhibitors greatly reduced {{the frequency with which}} resistant colonies arose; however, some resistant replicon cells could be isolated by the use of low inhibitor concentrations. These replicons were approximately 1, 000 -fold less susceptible to HCV- 796 and 9 -fold less susceptible to <b>boceprevir.</b> They also exhibited resistance to anthranilate nonnucleoside inhibitors of NS 5 B but were fully sensitive to inhibitors of different mechanisms: a pyranoindole, Hsp 90 inhibitors, an NS 5 B nucleoside inhibitor, and pegylated interferon (Peg-IFN). The replicon was cleared from the combination-resistant cells by extended treatment with Peg-IFN. Mutations known to confer resistance to HCV- 796 (NS 5 B C 316 Y) and <b>boceprevir</b> (NS 3 V 170 A) were present in the combination-resistant replicons. These changes could be selected together and coexist in the same genome. The replicon bearing both changes exhibited reduced sensitivity to inhibition by HCV- 796 and <b>boceprevir</b> but had a reduced replicative capacity...|$|E
