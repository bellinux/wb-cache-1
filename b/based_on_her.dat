5|$|Attachments between {{infants and}} {{caregivers}} form {{even if this}} caregiver is not sensitive and responsive in social interactions with them. This has important implications.

Early patterns of attachment, in turn, shape — but do not determine — the individual's expectations in later relationships.|$|E
40|$|AbstractDiscovery and {{classification}} of overlap nodes in communities {{is an important}} topic in data mining.

We allow each player to select multiple communities, which naturally captures the concept of “overlapping communities”. We conduct experiments on this method, and {{the results show that}} our algorithm is effective in discovering overlapping communities, the value in practice and academic study is demonstrated...|$|R
