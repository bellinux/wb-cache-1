5|$|What's So Amazing About Grace? sold well at {{secular and}} Christian stores. Its {{popularity}} in the United Kingdom grew in 2003, when the impending Iraq War boosted sales of religious literature in the country. That March, it was the seventh-bestselling religious book in the UK, behind Rick Warren's The Purpose Driven Life, John Ortberg's If You Want to Walk on Water, You've Got to Get Out of the Boat and Eugene H. Peterson's The Message. What's So Amazing About Grace? is Yancey's best-known book, having sold more than 15million copies by 2006. Initially, the book was especially popular among <b>baby</b> <b>boomers.</b> Its popularity helped increase sales of Yancey's 2000 book Reaching for the Invisible God, which appeared on religion bestseller lists immediately after publication. What's So Amazing About Grace? {{is one of several}} books by Yancey that have become international bestsellers.|$|E
5|$|For {{many years}} Fonda took ballet class to keep fit, but after {{fracturing}} her foot while filming The China Syndrome, {{she was no}} longer able to participate. To compensate, she began participating in aerobics and strengthening exercises under the direction of Leni Cazden. The Leni Workout became the Jane Fonda Workout, which began a second career for her, continuing for many years. This was considered one of the influences that started the fitness craze among <b>baby</b> <b>boomers,</b> then approaching middle age. In 1982, Fonda released her first exercise video, titled Jane Fonda's Workout, inspired by her best-selling book, Jane Fonda's Workout Book. Jane Fonda's Workout became the highest selling home video of the next few years, selling over a million copies. The video's release led many people to buy the then-new VCR in order to watch and perform the workout at home. The exercise videos were produced and directed by Sidney Galanty, who helped to put the deal together with video distributor Stuart Karl, of Karl Home Video. Galanty produced the first video and 11 more after that. She would subsequently release 23 workout videos with the series selling a total of 17 million copies combined, more than any other exercise series. She released five workout books and thirteen audio programs, through 1995. After a fifteen-year hiatus, she released two new fitness videos on DVD in 2010, aiming at an older audience.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study {{conducted}} is to examine the saving habits of the <b>baby</b> <b>boomer</b> generation as compared to other generations. The first section of the study looks at retirement planning in general to give an understanding of how an individual can effectively save for retirement. Next, the study deals specifically with the saving habits of the <b>baby</b> <b>boomer</b> generation. This section discusses the relevant statistics concerning the <b>baby</b> <b>boomer</b> generation and their lack of retirement saving. The last half of the study deals with a survey conducted about saving habits of individuals. This section looks at the generational differences in five factors of retirement savings: Social Security, aversion to technology, expected age of retirement, self-leadership, and perception of risk. Conclusions were then drawn from the findings of the study to give reasons why the <b>baby</b> <b>boomer</b> generation is not saving adequately for retirement. Honors CollegeThesis (B. ?. ...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{represents}} an exploratory attempt at studying the purchasing behaviour {{of both the}} <b>Baby</b> <b>Boomer</b> and Generation Y cohorts {{in relation to the}} five stages of the consumer decision making (CDM) model. The {{purpose of this study is}} to (1) analyse and compare the attitudes and behaviours of both the <b>Baby</b> <b>Boomer</b> and Generation Y cohorts in their purchasing behaviour in high ticket purchases, and (2) examine in greater depth the information search stage of the CDM model adopted by these two mentioned cohorts in relation to the purchase of a motor vehicle. Interviewer-administered questionnaires were conducted and information was gathered from 50 respondents between the ages of 18 - 32 and 45 - 63. Results from the Independent samples T-test, One sample T-test and the Pearson correlation test found that both the <b>Baby</b> <b>Boomer</b> and Generation Y cohorts were equally involved in their search for information on motor vehicles, particularly searching for information on the Internet. Results from further tests also revealed that Generation Y is more likely to seek advice from friends and family members, and also recommending the same model of motor vehicle and/or brand to friends and family members. Additionally, findings showed that Generation Y consumers favoured brands more than the <b>Baby</b> <b>Boomer</b> consumers, particularly when choosing motor vehicle brands. Further findings revealed that the more involved the <b>Baby</b> <b>Boomer</b> and Generation Y cohorts positioned themselves towards the purchase of the motor vehicle, the more information they searched. Finally, findings from the study revealed that internal information search is initially used by both the <b>Baby</b> <b>Boomer</b> and Generation Y cohorts, however there needs to be more research carried out for the usage of external information in the consumer decision making process. Recommendations made to marketing practitioners within this thesis can be summarised as follows. Firstly, more information should be made readily available and easily accessible to the <b>Baby</b> <b>Boomer</b> and Generation Y cohorts through print and other forms of media such as the Internet, televisions and radios. Secondly, marketing practitioners should attract <b>Baby</b> <b>Boomer</b> and retain Generation Y consumers through loyalty programs and building communications based on the needs, wants and perceived relevance as depicted by these consumers. Accordingly, this will produce favourable word-of-mouth promotions and recommendations by <b>Baby</b> <b>Boomer</b> and Generation Y consumers...|$|R
