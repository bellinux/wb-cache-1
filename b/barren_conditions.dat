5000|$|Pioneer {{species are}} hardy species {{which are the}} first to colonize {{previously}} disrupted or damaged ecosystems, beginning a chain of ecological succession that ultimately leads to a more biodiverse steady-state ecosystem. Some lichens grow on rocks without soil, so may be among the first of life forms, and break down the rock into soil for other plants. Since some uncolonized land may have thin, poor quality soils with few nutrients, pioneer species are often hardy plants with adaptations such as long roots, root nodes containing nitrogen-fixing bacteria, and leaves that employ transpiration. Note that they are often photosynthetic plants, as no other source of energy (such as other species) except light energy is often available {{in the early stages of}} succession, thus making it less likely for a pioneer species to be non-photosynthetic. The plants that are often pioneer species also tend to be wind-pollinated rather than insect-pollinated, as insects are unlikely to be present in the usually <b>barren</b> <b>conditions</b> in which pioneer species grow; however, pioneer species tend to reproduce asexually altogether, as the extreme or <b>barren</b> <b>conditions</b> present make it more favourable to reproduce asexually in order to increase reproductive success rather than invest energy into sexual reproduction. Pioneer species will die creating plant litter, and break down as [...] "leaf mold" [...] after some time, making new soil for secondary succession (see below), and nutrients for small fish and aquatic plants in adjacent bodies of water.|$|E

40|$|Recently, {{non-destructive}} method such as {{the electrical}} resistivity technique has become increasingly popular in engineering, environmental, mining and archeological studies nowadays. This method was popular in subsurface profiling due to its ability to replicate {{the images of the}} subsurface indirectly. The soil slope found in Batu Pahat, specifically in Ayer Hitam, is known to be problematic due to its <b>barren</b> <b>condition.</b> This location is believed to contain futile soil due to its difficulty in supporting the growth of vegetations. In the past, acidic barren slope assessment using non-destructive method was rarely being used due to several reasons related to the equipment and knowledge constraints. Hence, this study performed an electrical resistivity imaging using ABEM Terrameter LS in order to investigate the acidic <b>barren</b> slope <b>conditions.</b> Field data acquisition was based on Schlumberger and Wenner arrays while RES 2 DINV software was used to analyze and generate a 2 -D model of the problematic subsurface profile. Based on electrical resistivity results, {{it was found that the}} acidic barren slope studied consists of two main zones representing residual soil (electrical resistivity value = 10 – 600 Ωm) and shale (electrical resistivity value = 20 – 2000 Ωm). The results of resistivity value were correlated with the physical mapping and the in situ mackintosh probe test for verification purposes. It was found that the maximum depth of the mackintosh probe test was 1. 8 m due to its ground penetration limitation. However, the results of the resistivity section managed to achieve greater depth up to 40 m. Hence, the correlation between electrical resistivity and mackintosh probe results can only be performed at certain depth of the acidic barren slope profile in contrast with the physical mapping which able to define the whole section of the barren soil slope structure. Finally, a good match of electrical resistivity results calibrated with mackintosh and physical mapping data showed that this technique was appropriate to be applied in near-surface acidic barren slope assessment which can further compliment borehole data and other physical mapping data at a lower cost, higher speed, large data coverage and better environmental sustainability...|$|R

Therefore, this study explored if zebrafish displayed preferences for a range of enrichments, including substrates, artificial plants, combinations thereof and airstones. Tanks divided into two compartments containing different enrichment cues were used to determine the preferences of zebrafish housed in pairs and groups of eight. When comparing time spent in enriched versus barren compartments, dominant individuals in a pair displayed a preference for substrate and behaviourally excluded the subordinate (p[*]<[*] 0. 05).

40|$|Abstract:-Spatial {{variability}} of N, P, and K using a systematic soil sampling were {{studied in the}} UiTM Perlis Branch Campus Research Station field at Arau, Perlis. A total of 54 surface soil samples at 0 - 15 cm depth were collected at 80 m x 80 m grid pattern and analyzed to determine total N, available P and K in the plots. A GeoExplorer II Global Positioning System (GPS) was used to record the coordinates of the soil sampling points. All the samples were then analysed in the Soil Science Laboratory, Universiti Putra Malaysia, Serdang to determine soil selected elements of nitrogen, phosphorous and potassium (N, P, K). Soil mapping variability was later analyzed using the Geostatistics software. Kriging {{analysis was used to}} determine the value of each point in the area of study. A semi variogram was developed to describe the spatial relationship between the locations where the value of a soil property was estimated and characterized. It was found that the presence of N, P, and K varied from 0. 098 - 0. 147 %, 10. 0 – 24. 2 ppm and 62 - 129 ppm, respectively.

40|$|Previously {{we showed}} that pigs reared in an enriched {{environment}} had higher baseline salivary cortisol concentrations during the light period than pigs reared under <b>barren</b> <b>conditions.</b> In the present experiment, it was investigated whether these higher baseline salivary cortisol concentrations were a real difference in cortisol concentration or merely represented a phase difference in circadian rhythm. The effects of different cortisol concentrations on the behavioral responses to novelty and learning and long-term memory in a maze test were also studied in enriched and barren housed pigs. At 9 weeks of age enriched and barren housed pigs {{did not differ in}} baseline salivary cortisol concentrations nor in circadian rhythm, but at 22 weeks of age barren housed pigs had a blunted circadian rhythm in salivary cortisol as compared to enriched housed pigs. The differences in baseline salivary cortisol concentrations between enriched- and barren-housed pigs are age-dependent, and become visible after 15 weeks of age. Enriched- and barren-housed piglets did not differ in time spent on exploration in the novel environment test. Barren-housed pigs had an impaired long-term memory in the maze test compared to enriched-housed pigs; however, no differences in learning abilities between enriched- and barren-housed pigs were found. Because blunted circadian cortisol rhythms are often recorded during states of chronic stress in pigs and rats or during depression in humans, it is suggested that the blunted circadian rhythm in cortisol in barren-housed pigs similarily may reflect decreased welfare.

40|$|A {{number of}} mutilating procedures, such as {{dehorning}} in cattle and goats and beak trimming in laying hens, {{are common in}} farm animal husbandry systems {{in an attempt to}} prevent or solve problems, such as injuries from horns or feather pecking. These procedures and other practices, such as early maternal separation, overcrowding, and <b>barren</b> housing <b>conditions,</b> raise concerns about animal welfare.

We propose adapting the environment to the animals by improving management practices and housing conditions, and by abandoning mutilating procedures. This approach requires the active involvement of all stakeholders: veterinarians and animal scientists, the industrial farming sector, the food processing and supply chain, and consumers of animal-derived products. Although scientific evidence about the welfare effects of current practices in farming such as mutilating procedures, management practices, and housing conditions is steadily growing, the gain in knowledge needs a boost through more scientific research.

40|$|The EC Directive {{on animal}} {{experimentation}} suggests that all protected animals should have enrichment to improve welfare yet relatively {{little research has}} been conducted on the impact of enrichment in fish. Studies employing enrichment in zebrafish have been contradictory and other fish species may require species-specific enrichments relevant to their ecology. Salmonids are important experimental models in studies within aquaculture, toxicology and natural ecosystems. This study therefore sought to establish whether an enriched environment in an experimental aquarium may promote improved welfare in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) by enhancing their recovery from invasive procedures. Trout were held individually in either barren (no tank ornamentation) or enriched (gravel, plants and an area of cover) conditions and recovery rates after a noxious stimulus and a standard stressor were investigated by monitoring behaviour, opercular beat rate and plasma cortisol concentrations. Fish were {{randomly assigned to one of}} four treatment groups: Control (undisturbed), Sham (handled but not manipulated), Stress (air emersion) and Pain (subcutaneous injection of acetic acid). The results suggest that for rainbow trout environmental enrichment may not be an important factor when the fish is responding to a painful stimulus. However, it does appear to promote recovery and ameliorate adverse effects following a stressor. Fish held in <b>barren</b> <b>conditions</b> were potentially more stressed as seen by increased activity following imposition of the stressor. These results have important implications for the husbandry and welfare of captive rainbow trout and suggest that enriched environments may be preferable to barren environments in experimental studies...|$|E

This study was designed to investigate the effect of social and environmental enrichment on the impact of disease, referred to as "disease susceptibility", in pigs using a co-infection model of PRRSV and A. pleuropneumoniae. Twenty-eight pigs were raised in four pens under <b>barren</b> <b>conditions</b> and twenty-eight other pigs were raised in four pens under enriched conditions. In the enriched pens a combination of established social and environmental enrichment factors were introduced. Two pens of the barren (BH) and two pens of the enriched housed (EH) pigs were infected with PRRSV followed by A. pleuropneumoniae, the other two pens in each housing treatment served as control groups. We tested if differences in disease susceptibility in terms of pathological and clinical outcome were related to the different housing regimes and if this was reflected in differences in behavioural and immunological states of the animals. Enriched housed pigs showed a faster clearance of viral PRRSV RNA in blood serum (p = 0. 014) and histologically 2. 8 fold less interstitial pneumonia signs in the lungs (p = 0. 014). More barren housed than enriched housed pigs developed lesions in the lungs (OR = 19. 2, p = 0. 048) and the lesions in the barren housed pigs showed a higher total pathologic tissue damage score (p< 0. 001) than those in enriched housed pigs. EH pigs showed less stress-related behaviour and differed immunologically and clinically from BH pigs.

40|$|Characterization of piglets {{based on}} the degree of {{resistance}} they display in a so-called Backtest is, to a certain extent, predictive of their coping responses to several challenges in later life. It is unknown, however, whether these individual coping characteristics of pigs are also reflected in their behavioural development in different environments. The present study investigated the behavioural development of pigs with diverging Backtest responses, high-resisting (HR) and low-resisting (LR) pigs, in both barren housing and housing enriched with straw bedding. During the suckling period, pigs were subjected to the Backtest. Pigs classified as HR (n = 30) or LR (n = 30) were selected and after weaning housed in groups of six (three LR and three HR) in either barren or enriched pens. Home pen behaviour was recorded at 5, 9, 15 and 19 weeks of age for 8 h per week using 2 -min instantaneous scan sampling. Housing environment markedly influenced behaviour of pigs. Barren housed pigs were less active, showed less explorative and play behaviour, and spent more time on oral activities directed at pen mates than pigs from enriched housing. HR pigs showed more aggressive behaviour than LR pigs and they tended to be less active in both environments. LR pigs spent more time on manipulating pen mates, in particular in barren housing. In addition, they played more than HR pigs in enriched pens. In conclusion, an enriched housing environment, i. e. availability of straw bedding, appeared to improve welfare as it increased play behaviour and decreased manipulative oral behaviour directed at pen mates in comparison with <b>barren</b> housing <b>conditions.</b> Individual coping characteristics of pigs, as assessed in the Backtest, were also reflected in their home pen behaviour.

40|$|There are {{indications}} that pigs may have difficulty in adapting to the constraints of intensive housing conditions. Pigs show a wide variation in adaptive responses when exposed to the same stressful situation. Aim of this thesis was to investigate whether the behavioural coping responses of young piglets reflect and predict more general profiles of reactivity to challenges, {{often referred to as}} coping styles, under different rearing and housing conditions. For this purpose, pigs were characterized early in life as `high-resisting` (HR) or `low-resisting` (LR) {{on the basis of their}} resistance response in a so-called Backtest, in which they were manually restrained in supine position. The major part of the thesis focused on the interaction between these individual coping characteristics of pigs and their housing environment, which was either barren or enriched with straw bedding. The experiments described in this thesis show that HR pigs are more aggressive than LR pigs and less flexible in adapting their behaviour to environmental changes. As the two types of pig differed in response to the dopamine-agonist apomorphine, some initial evidence is provided for a neurochemical background of these behavioural differences. In addition, individual coping or personality characteristics of pigs were reflected in immune reactivity and in their home pen behaviour in barren and enriched environments. HR and LR pigs adapted differently to <b>barren</b> housing <b>conditions.</b> Moreover, individual characteristics modulated the effects of rearing and housing conditions on the behavioural response to novelty, immune reactivity, prevalence of gastric lesions and behavioural development. Remarkably, for almost all of the variables that were affected by housing environment, the impact was much larger for LR than for HR pigs. Thus, individual characteristics of pigs affect their performance in different environments and should be taken into account when studying the impact of housing on their behaviour and welfare. The knowledge of individual coping or personality characteristics could be extended and used for finding the optimal match between pigs and their social and physical environment in pig husbandry...|$|R
40|$|In general, three {{approaches}} towards {{animal welfare}} exist: animal bodies, natures and minds. These concepts respectively emphasise physical health, natural behaviour and mental health. Each approach {{has its own}} corresponding welfare indicators. Knowledge {{in the area of}} especially the more persistent emotional states (mental health) of animals is lagging behind. This has to be improved, since the assessment of the emotional states of animals is a crucial step in improving their welfare. This study investigated the welfare of gilts before and after a switch in housing conditions (pens with concrete floor and pens with a wood shavings bedding) was made with a specific focus on their mental welfare. The first aim of this thesis was to investigate if the welfare of pigs housed under particular housing conditions (barren or on wood shavings) is influenced by their previous experience of housing conditions. The short and longer term effects of the switch in housing conditions on the pigs’ welfare were investigated. This was done by physical, behavioural and mental welfare indicators. The second aim of this thesis was to investigate whether the results of all three welfare indicators (animal body, nature and mind) lead to the same conclusions about animal welfare. For this purpose, 212 purchased gilts were used. The animals were kept from an age of four weeks (weaning age) until slaughter at ± 24 - 25 weeks at the experimental farm Carus of Wageningen University. The experiment was set up using a 2 x 2 factorial arrangement, with housing conditions from weaning until 10 weeks of age (barren vs. enriched with wood shavings) and housing conditions after 10 weeks of age (barren vs. enriched with wood shavings) as factors. This resulted in the following groups: pigs housed for the complete experimental period on wood shavings (EE) or in barren pens (BB), pigs switched from barren pens to pens with wood shavings (BE) and pigs which were switched the other way around (EB). The switch in housing conditions was set at 10 weeks of age since the pigs were also used for a study that investigated the prevalence of Osteochondrosis which required this specific timing of the switch. However, for the present study, this timing was also very interesting since for fattening pigs, the switch from nursery to the growing-finishing phase includes a change in environment and normally also takes place at an age of approximately 10 weeks. With regard to the physical welfare (body approach), ulceration of the pars oesophageal region of the stomach was investigated post mortem, since stress is one of the causes of gastric ulceration. The behaviour of the pigs (nature approach) was investigated by continuous live observations for 4 * 10 min per pen per week when the animals were eight weeks old (before the switch), 10 weeks old (2 - 3 days after the switch) and 17 weeks old. The frequency of play (indicative of a more positive emotional state), manipulative and aggressive behaviours (indicative of a more negative emotional state) were scored. A startle response test, a gain of reward and a relative contrast test were used to investigate the emotional states of the animals in a more direct way (mind approach) compared to the nature approach. In the relative contrast test, for four consecutive days, the animals were given twice daily a reward with high incentive value (mix of yoghurt and chocolate raisins) followed by four consecutive days in which a reward with lower incentive value (their normal feed) was provided. Thereafter, for four consecutive days, the reward with high incentive value was again provided. This resulted in a total of 24 trials. A cue indicated that the treats were about to be provided to the pig in each trial. After a 15 -sec time-interval in which the anticipatory response was investigated, the food reward was thrown into the pen. This was the start of the test phase, which lasted for 45 seconds, during which the response of the pigs to the reward was investigated. This test was conducted once, after the switch in housing conditions. With regard to the stomach scores, it was shown that post switch B (i. e. EB and BB) pigs had higher stomach scores, i. e. more stomach wall damage than post switch E (i. e. BE and EE) pigs F(1, 28) = 5. 28, p= 0. 0292. Also the interaction of pre*post switch housing conditions tended to affect stomach scores F(1, 28) = 3. 25, p= 0. 0823. Post hoc analysis revealed that EB pigs had a higher score than EE pigs with levels of BB and BE in between. Therefore, from the body approach, actual housing conditions seemed to be most important with enriched housed pigs experiencing a higher physical welfare compared to barren housed pigs. Experience of a different housing condition tended to be important, but only for pigs that were switched from an enriched to a barren environment (negative switch). The behavioural observations revealed that pigs housed in barren pens showed more negative (manipulative) and less positive (play) behaviour compared to pigs housed on wood shavings (all P< 0. 05). Also a slight effect of experience was present in some behaviours (pre*post or pre*post*week effects). However, no straightforward results were obtained in this regard, only minor indications of the importance of experience existed with regard to both a positive (steep decline in manipulative behaviour and delay of decrease of play behaviour) and negative (steep decline in play behaviour) switch. By means of behavioural observations, it was shown that from the nature point of view, indications existed that experience of either a barren or enriched housings system is important, but only for the short term. Actual housing seemed {{to be the most important}} determinant of the welfare of pigs with pigs housed on wood shavings experiencing a higher welfare compared to pigs housed in barren pens. With regard to the startle, gain and relative contrast test, it was shown that the relative contrast test gave the best indication of the mental welfare of the pigs. Enriched housed pigs showed more play behaviour in the test compared to barren housed pigs. They also seemed to be better in accepting the loss of reward and seemed to be less reactive and therefore less bored. Barren housed pigs seemed to be more bored, indicated by their high reactivity towards the presence of the observers, indicative of a less positive emotional state. They also seemed less capable of accepting the situation since they kept searching for the reward when their normal pellet feed was provided (all P< 0. 10). It was also shown that pigs that were switched from enriched to barren housing (i. e. EB pigs) were in a more apathetic state compared to pigs that were always housed barren (i. e. BB pigs). Based on the animal mind approach it could be concluded that actual housing seemed most important with pigs housed on wood shavings experiencing a better mental welfare compared to pigs housed under <b>barren</b> <b>conditions.</b> Also the importance of experience of housing conditions was shown, but only for a negative switch in housing system. Based on the results, it can be concluded that experience of housing systems does matter for the welfare of pigs. This was indicated by all three welfare indicators. It was shown that the results of the three different welfare indicators lead to the same conclusions. However, with regard to the body (stomachs) and mind (relative contrast test) approach: experience seemed to be mainly important when a negative switch was made, while the nature (behaviour) approach indicated that experience seemed to be important in both a positive and negative switch. Also, the time effect of the experience differed between the welfare indicators. The nature approach indicated that mainly a short term effect was present, while the body and mind approach indicated that also a longer term effect of experience was present. Therefore, it is recommended that all three welfare indicators are used to obtain a complete view of the welfare of an animal...|$|E
40|$|When {{applied to}} a bare slope, {{vegetation}} and mulch will prevent further erosion and enhance the aesthetic appeal of the area, ultimately {{improving the quality of}} the soil. If nothing is done to this <b>barren</b> slope, its <b>condition</b> will continue to deteriorate. Core samples were taken at six different sites located on a highly degraded and barren slope on the Cal Poly campus. Bulk density, porosity, soil temperature, and nitrogen and phosphorous levels were measured prior to vegetating the slope. Thirty-three groundcover rose bushes were planted and drip irrigation was installed. Mulch was laid down and two un-official coarse-sand walking trails were constructed to direct foot traffic. After a period of three months, core samples were taken again at each of the six sites, and the measurements were repeated. We expected the condition of the slope to be much improved, with minimal erosion and increased aesthetic value. The bulk density decreased and porosity increased. Decomposition of the mulch and vegetative growth added organic matter to the soil. The benefits of such improvement to the soil will be enhanced water quality of the runoff that flows into the sewer drains and an educational opportunity for all who participate in the project and observe the site as they walk to class...|$|R
40|$|International audienceAbstractHousing of pigs in <b>barren,</b> stimulus-poor housing <b>conditions</b> may {{influence}} their immune status, including antibody responses to (auto-) antigens, and thus affect immune protection, which will influence the onset and outcome of infection. In the present study, we investigated {{the effects of}} environmental enrichment versus barren housing {{on the level of}} natural (auto-) antibodies (NA(A) b) and their isotypes (IgM and IgG) binding keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH), myelin basic protein (MBP), and phosphorycholine conjugated to bovine serum albumin (PC-BSA) in pigs co-infected with porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) and Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae (A. pleuropneumoniae). Pigs (n =  56) were housed in either barren or enriched pens from birth to 54  days of age. They were infected with PRRSV on 44  days of age, and with A. pleuropneumoniae 8  days later. Blood samples were taken on 7 different sampling days. Housing significantly affected the overall serum levels of NA(A) b binding KLH, MBP and PC-BSA, and before infection barren housed pigs had significantly higher levels of NA(A) b than enriched housed pigs, except for KLH-IgM and PC-BSA-IgG. Infection only affected the IgM, but not the IgG isotype. Moreover, changes in MBP-IgM and PC-BSA-IgM following infection were different for enriched and barren housed pigs. These results suggest that the effect of infection on NA(A) b is influenced by housing conditions and that NA(A) b, especially IgM may be affected by infection...|$|R
40|$|In organic farming, the {{production}} of pork from entire male pigs {{seems to be the}} mostpromising alternative to castration, as organic animal husbandry aims at high standards ofanimal welfare and elimination of mutilations. However, previous research on behaviourof entire male pigs was mostly carried out under <b>barren</b> housing <b>conditions</b> and is thus notentirely transferrable to enriched housing conditions. In the present study, we investigatedsingle-sex and mixed-sex groups of entire male pigs and compared them with mixed-sexgroups of castrated male pigs under organic housing conditions. On a commercial farm, 362 pigs (average weight 22. 7 kg, average age 80 days) were assigned to pens with groups of 20 (+ 1) pigs according to three treatments: single-sex groups with entire males (EE), mixed-sex groups with entire males and females (EF) and mixed-sex groups with castrated malesand females (CF). Skin and tail lesions, lameness and the behaviours ‘head knocking/biting’,‘fighting’ and ‘mounting’ were assessed on five days during the fattening period. Averagecarcass weight for all sexes was 92 kg. After slaughter, female reproductive organs wereinspected for signs of pregnancy. Fat samples of entire male pigs were analysed for concen-trations of androstenone and skatole. Entire males showed more aggressive and mountingbehaviours than castrated males (p < 0. 001), and no difference was found between entiremales from the EE and EF treatments. Welfare of female pigs was not impaired when pennedtogether with entire males compared to when penned together with castrates, neither interms of skin lesions nor in terms of received aggressive behaviour. Pigs in the EE treatment had higher lesion scores than those in the EF and CF treatments (p < 0. 05 and p < 0. 01,respectively), while the two latter treatments did not differ. In the inspected female repro-ductive organs, no pregnancy could be detected. The concentration of androstenone in fatindicated that {{the presence or absence of}} females in a group did not have an effect on themale pigs. Of the 177 slaughtered entire male pigs, only one carcass was classified as containing boar taint by a human nose test. Our findings suggest that under enriched housingconditions, entire males can be kept in single–sex groups as well as in mixed-sex groupswith females without compromise in animal welfare...|$|R
30|$|Erosion and {{sedimentation}} {{is a major}} secondary hazard {{associated with}} GLOF and can have severe and prolonged socio-ecological impact (Vilímek et al. 2015; Higaki and Sato 2012). The GLOF {{in the past have}} converted fertile grazing/agricultural land into a field of sand and boulders, adversely affecting the livelihoods of the local people. The extent of erosion and sedimentation in this event was limited and was confined up to 25  km downstream from the lake (Fig. 7). As the outburst dislodges and washes away moraine materials a debris {{in the form of a}} fan in front of the end moraine is clearly visible in the satellite image (Fig. 4 and 5). Similarly, sand and boulder debris were found deposited further downstream (Point No. 2 in Fig. 9) where loss of gradient has decreased carrying capacity of the flood. As usual there were scouring at places along the river bank up to 25  km downstream. Since the river runs through a deep gorge beyond 25  km between Kohina and Gasa (25  km– 39  km), the 14  km stretch is inaccessible. There was no impact noticed further down at Tashithang (about 50  km downstream). Given the terrain is steep and <b>barren,</b> and climatic <b>condition</b> harsh, it will be a while before the erosion process ceases and stability regained. This will have prolonged impact in the downstream due to increased sediment transport sourced from such erosional sites. Thus the impact could be long drawn out process.|$|R
40|$|AbstractDevelopmental {{exposure}} to manganese (Mn) or stress can each {{be detrimental to}} brain development. Here, Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to two housing conditions and Mn from postnatal day (P) 4 – 28. Within each litter two males and two females {{were assigned to the}} following groups: 0 (vehicle), 50, or 100 mg/kg Mn by gavage every other day. Half the litters were reared in cages with standard bedding and half with no bedding. One pair/group in each litter had an acute shallow water stressor before tissue collection (i. e., standing in shallow water). Separate litters were assessed at P 11, 19, or 29. Mn-treated rats raised in standard cages showed no change in baseline corticosterone but following acute stress increased more than controls on P 19; no Mn effects were seen on P 11 or P 29. Mn increased neostriatal dopamine in females at P 19 and norepinephrine at P 11 and P 29. Mn increased hippocampal dopamine at P 11 and P 29 and 5 -HT at P 29 regardless of housing or sex. Mn had no effect on hypothalamic dopamine, but increased norepinephrine in males at P 29 and 5 -HT in males at all ages irrespective of rearing <b>condition.</b> <b>Barren</b> reared rats showed no or opposite effects of Mn, i. e., barren rearing + Mn attenuated corticosterone increases to acute stress. Barren rearing also altered the Mn-induced changes in dopamine and norepinephrine in the neostriatum, but not in the hippocampus. Barren rearing caused a Mn-associated increase in hypothalamic dopamine at P 19 and P 29 not seen in standard reared Mn-treated groups. Developmental Mn alters monoamines and corticosterone as a function of age, stress (acute and chronic), and sex...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the yielding performance of maize under stress conditions involving mixing of different genotypes, plant density and low water/fertilizer inputs. The impact on yield from competition and genetic differences was analysed. Two F 1 hybrids (Prisma and Funo) were used, their F 2 s, the mixture of the F 2 s and the F 1 +F 2 mixture of the first hybrid, in a high and in a low-inputs experiment. The two F 1 hybrids increased field yield until 133300 plants ha - 1 and at 190000 plants ha - 1 there was a decrease due to increased rate of declining individual plant yield. The rate of decrease of individual plant yield is a parameter that determines the final field yield realised under increasing plant densities. In full-inputs experiment, there was a significant interaction between genetic materials and plant densities, meaning that different materials respond in a different way under the stress of density. F 2 generations were affected lesser than F 1 hybrids. Genetic purity proved to be a greater stress condition than density effects. This was more apparent in the low-inputs experiment where differences between genetic materials were much more significant and plant density was a limited stress, almost eliminated by the stronger stress of lower inputs. The low-inputs condition is a major stress masking the effects of plant density. F 1 yield in the low-inputs experiment was close to the F 2 yielding performance in the full-inputs experiment. Higher plant densities showed lower inbreeding depression values for both hybrids in both experiments. This was due to F 2 s buffering, resulting in increased relative yield in comparison to the F 1 s. The increasing plant density resulted in increasing CV values and number of <b>barren</b> plants. Extreme <b>conditions,</b> such as plant density and low inputs, showed that the F 1 s are affected more than multigenotypic materials, exhibiting greater increase in CV values. F 1 hybrid Funo, showed increased numbers of barren plants and this may be an indication of low seed purity, but indications from F 1 Funo and Prisma yield comparisons and from F 1 /F 2 comparisons, showed that even if there was a quantity of impure seed partition for hybrid Funo this was small. Low inputs resulted in significant soil heterogeneity, maybe stronger as a stress condition than plant density effects and allocompetition. Ranking stress conditions, low inputs is the most severe stress because of the increased needs of modern maize hybrids, followed by seed purity and soil heterogeneity. Plant density is a problem only under extremely high or low populations...|$|R
40|$|The Five Freedoms {{have had}} {{major impact on}} animal welfare {{thinking}} internationally. However, despite clear initial statements that the words ‘freedom from’ should indicate ‘as free as possible from’, the Freedoms {{have come to be}} represented as absolute or fundamental freedoms, even rights, by some animal advocate and other groups. Moreover, a marked increase in scientific understanding {{over the last two decades}} shows that the Freedoms do not capture the more nuanced knowledge of the biological processes that is germane to understanding animal welfare and which is now available to guide its management. For example, the named negative experiences of thirst, hunger, discomfort and pain, and others identified subsequently, including breathlessness, nausea, dizziness, debility, weakness and sickness, can never be eliminated, merely temporarily neutralised. Each one is a genetically embedded element that motivates animals to behave in particular ways to obtain specific life-sustaining resources, avoid or reduce physical harm or facilitate recovery from infection or injury. Their undoubted negativity creates a necessary sense of urgency to respond, without which animals would not survive. Also, the temporary neutralisation of these survival-critical affects does not in and of itself generate positive experience. This questions the commonly held assumption that good animal welfare will result when these internally generated negative affects are minimised. Animals may also experience other negative affects that include anxiety, fear, panic, frustration, anger, helplessness, loneliness, boredom and depression. These situation-related affects reflect animals’ perceptions of their external circumstances. Although they are elicited by threatening, cramped, <b>barren</b> and/or isolated <b>conditions,</b> they can often be replaced by positive affects when animals are kept with congenial others in spacious, stimulus-rich and safe environments which provide opportunities for them to engage in behaviours they find rewarding. These behaviours may include environment-focused exploration and food acquisition activities as well as animal-to-animal interactive activities, all of which can generate various forms of comfort, pleasure, interest, confidence and a sense of control. Animal welfare management should aim to reduce the intensity of survival-critical negative affects to tolerable levels that nevertheless still elicit the required behaviours, and should also provide opportunities for animals to behave in ways they find rewarding, noting that poor management of survival-critical affects reduces animals’ motivation to utilize such rewarding opportunities. This biologically more accurate understanding provides support for reviewing the adequacy of provisions in current codes of welfare or practice in order to ensure that animals are given greater opportunities to experience positive welfare states. The purpose is to help animals to have lives worth living, which is not possible when the predominant focus of such codes is on survival-critical measures. Finally, an updated characterisation of animal welfare that incorporates this more accurate understanding is presented...|$|R
5000|$|Mr. Deniehy {{seconded}} {{the resolution}} this meeting pledges itself to resist, by every constitutional means in its power, {{the formation of}} a second chamber which is not based on popular suffrage. Why he had been selected to speak to the present resolution he knew not, save that as a native of the colony he might naturally be expected to feel something like real interest, and to speak with something like real feeling on a question connected with the political institutions of the country. He would do his best to respond to that invitation 'Speak up,' and would perhaps balance deficiencies flowing from a small volume of voice by in all cases calling things by their right names.He protested against the present daring and unheard-of attempt to tamper with a fundamental popular right - that of having a voice in the nomination of men who were to make, or control the making of, laws binding on the community - laws perpetually shifting and changing the nature of the whole social economy of a given state, and frequently operating in the subtlest forms on the very dearest interests of the citizen - on his domestic, his moral, perhaps his religious relations.The name of Mr. Wentworth had frequently been mentioned there that day, and that on one or two occasions with an unwise tenderness, a squeamish reluctance to speak plain, English, and call certain nasty doings of Mr. Wentworth by the usual homely appellatives, simply because they were Mr. Wentworth's. He for one was nowise disposed, as preceding speakers had seemed, in tapping the vast shoulder of Mr. Wentworth's political recreancies, to 'damn him with faint praise and mistimed eulogy.He had listened from boyhood upwards to grey tradition, Mr. Wentworth's demagogic Areopagitas - his speeches for the liberty of unlicensed printing regime of Darling; and for these and divers other deeds of a time when the honourable member for Sydney had to the full his share of the chivalrous pugnacities of five-and-twenty, he was as much disposed to give Mr Wentworth credit as any man. But with these perpetual fantasies, these everlasting variations on the 'Light of the other Days,' continually ringing in his ears, he Deniehy was fain to enquire by what rule of moral and political appraisal, it was sought to throw in a scale opposite to that containing the flagrant and shameless political dishonesty of years, the democratic escapades, sins long since repented of in early youth.The subsequent political conduct-rather the systemic political principles of Mr. Wentworth - had been such as would have been sufficient to cancel the value of even a century of action. The British Constitution had been frequently spoken of that afternoon in terms of unbounded laudation. That Constitution certainly deserved to be spoken of with respect; he Deniehy respected it, no doubt they all respected it.But his was a qualified respect at best, and in all presumed assimilations of the political hypotheses of our colonial Constitution-makers with the Constitution of Great Britain, he warned them not be seduced by mere words and phrases-sheer 'talkee talkee.' Relatively, it was not only an admirable example of slowly growing and gradually elaborated political experience, applied, set in action, but it was also eminent and exemplary as a long history, still evolving, of political philosophy. But it was after all but relatively good for its wonderfully successful fusion of principles the most antagonistic.Circumstances entirely alter cases, and he would warn them to be seduced by no mere vague association exhaled from the use of venerable phrases, that had, what phrases now-a-days seldom could boast, genuine meanings attached to them. The patrician element existed in the British Constitution as did the regal, for good reasons-it had stood in the way of all late legislatorial thought and operation as a great fact; as such it was handled, and in a deep and prudential spirit of conservatism allowed to stand-but as affecting the basis and foundation of the architecture of a Constitution-the elective principle neutralised for all detrimental influence, by conversion, practically, into a mere check upon the deliberations of the initiative section of the Legislature.And having the right to frame, to embody, to shape it as we would, with no great stubborn facts to work upon as in England, there was nothing but the elective principle and the inalienable freedom of every colonist upon which to work out the whole organisation and body of our political institution.But because it was the good pleasure of Mr. Wentworth and the respectable tail of that puissant Legislative body, whose serpentine movements were so ridiculous, we were not to form our own Constitution, but instead of this we were to have an Upper House and a Constitution cast upon us, upon a pattern which should suit the taste and propriety of political oligarchs who treated the people at large as if they were cattle to be bought and sold in the market; or as they indeed were in American slave States, and now in Australian markets, where we might find bamboozled coolies and kidnapped Chinamen.And being in a figurative humour, he might endeavour to make some of the proposed nobility to pass before the stage of our imagination, as the ghost of Banquo walked along in the vision of Macbeth, so that we might have a fair view of these Harlequin aristocrats, these Botany Bay magnificos (laughter), these Australian mandarins.Let them walk across the stage in all the pomp and circumstances of hereditary titles. First, then, in the procession stalks the hoary Wentworth. But he could not imagine that to such a head the strawberry leaves reference to the decoration on a Duke's coronet would add any honour.Next came the native aristocrat Mr. James Macarthur, he would he supposed, aspire to the coronet of an earl, he would call him the Earl of Camden, and he suggests for his coat of arms a field vert, the heraldic term for green- (great cheers and laughter) -and emblazoned on this field should be a rum keg of a New South Wales order of chivalry. There was also the colonial starred Terence Aubrey Murray, with more crosses and orders-not perhaps orders of merit-than a state of mandarinhood.Another friend who claimed a colonial title was George Robert Nichols, the hereditary Grand Chancellor of all the Australias. Behold him in the serene and moody dignity of that portrait of Rodius' that smiled on us in all the public - house parlours - the gentleman who took Mr. Lowe to task for altering his opinions; this conqueror in the lists of jaw, and the victor in the realms of gab. It might be well to ridicule the doings of such a clique, but their doings merited burning indignation-yet, to speak seriously of such a project would too much resemble the Irishman's kicking at nothing, it wrenched one horribly.But, though their weakness was ridiculous, he could assure them that these pygmies might do a great deal of mischief. They would bring contempt on a country whose interest he was sure they all had at heart, until even the poor Irishman in the streets of Dublin would fling his jibe at the Botany Bay aristocrats. In fact, he was puzzled how to classify them. They could not aspire to the miserable and effete dignity of the grandees of Spain.They had antiquity of birth, but these he would defy any naturalist properly to classify them. But perhaps it was only a specimen of the remarkable contrariety that existed at the Antipodes. Here they all know the common water mole was transferred into the duck-billed platypus, and in some distant emulations of this degeneration, he supposed they were to be favoured with a bunyip aristocracy.He trusted that this was only the beginning of a more extended movement, and from its auspicious commencement he augured the happiest results. A more orderly, united, and consolidated movement he had never witnessed. He must say that he was proud to belong to Botany Bay.He took it as no term of reproach, when he saw that there was such a keen sensibility on the subject of their political sights - that the instant the liberties of their country were threatened, they could assemble, and with one voice, declare their determined and undying opposition.But he would remind them {{that this was not a}} selfish consideration, there were wider interests at stake. In the present disturbed state of Europe, they must calculate on having to receive the poor Russian flying from the knout of his oppressor.And also, looking at the gradually increasing pressure of political parties at home, they must prepare to open their arms and receive the fugitives from England, Scotland, and Ireland, who would hasten to gain a security and a competence, that appeared to be denied them in their own country.The interests of these countless thousands were involved in their decision on this occasion, and they looked, and were entitled to look, for a heritage befitting the dignity of free men. Bring them not here with delusive hopes-let them not find a new-fangled aristocracy haunting these free shores.But it is to yours to offer them a land, where man is rewarded for his labour, and where the law no more recognises the supremacy of a class, than it recognises the predominance of a religion. But there is an aristocracy worthy of our ambition. Wherever man's skill is eminent, wherever glorious manhood asserts its elevation, there is an aristocracy that confers honour on the land that possesses it. That is God's aristocracy.That is an aristocracy that will grow and expand under free institutions, and bless the land where it flourishes. He hoped they would take into consideration the hitherto <b>barren</b> <b>condition</b> of the country they were legislating for. He was a native of this young but glorious continent. Its past was not hallowed in history by the achievements of men whose names reflected a light on the times in which they lived. They had no long line of poets, of statesmen, and warriors; in this country art had done nothing, but nature everything. It was theirs to inaugurate the future.In no country had the attempt been successfully made to manufacture an aristocracy pro re nata. It could not be done. They might as well expect honour to be paid to the nobles of King Kamehameha, or the ebony earls of the Emperor Soulouque of Hayti.The aristocracy of England was founded on the sword. The men that came over with William the Conqueror were the masters of the Saxons, and so were the aristocracy. The soldiers of Cromwell were the masters of the Irish, and so became their aristocracy. But he should like to know how Wentworth and his clique had conquered the inhabitants of New South Wales - except in the artful dodgery of doctoring up a Franchise Bill.If we were to be blessed with an aristocracy he would rather it should not resemble that of William the Bastard but of Jack the Strapper.But he trespassed too long on their time and would only seek in conclusion, but to record two things. First, his indignant denunciation of any tampering with the purity of the elective principle, the only basis upon which good government could be placed; and, secondly, he wished them to regard the future destinies of their country.Let them, with prophetic eye, behold the troops of weary pilgrims, from foreign despotism, which would, ere long, be floating to their shores, and let them now - give the most earnest assurance, that such men as composed the Wentworth clique, were not the representations of the spirit, the intelligence, of the freemen of New South Wales.|$|R
