Hypothetically, sudden acceleration of the head due {{to the impact of}} the <b>blow</b> during the <b>boxing</b> fight might result in diffuse axonal injury or contusion. We wanted to determine whether cerebral microhemorrhages occur more often in amateur boxers than in nonboxers. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In 42 male, classical amateur boxers and in 37 healthy, nonboxing male volunteers we performed cranial MR imaging at 3 T. The study protocol included a transverse dual spin-echo MR imaging sequence, a 3 D sagittal magnetization-prepared rapid acquisition of gradient echo sequence, a coronal T 2 *-weighted sequence, and an axial time-of-flight MR angiography se-quence. MR imaging data were made anonymous before 2 neuroradiologists independently evaluated the images. In addition, the following risk factors were assessed: total numbers of fights and knockouts, weight division, and duration of boxing. We compared the group proportions of microhe-morrhages with Fisher test of exact probability. RESULTS: There was a statistically higher prevalence of cerebral microhemorrhages in the group of boxers (3 of 42; 7. 1 %) than in nonboxing persons (0 of 37; 0 %).

The Tolstoy truism holds that &# 039;every happy family is alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way&# 039;. Franchised &# 039;family restaurants&# 039; are premised on and perhaps defined by being recognisable alike. Yet as Massey argues, seemingly aspatial phenomena are always mediated by local context. This paper argues that local statutory planning has been central {{to the expansion of}} fast food chains, with globalisation tending to be accompanied by increasingly defensive legal boundaries. To demonstrate this, the paper explores a group of fast food outlets that experienced some form of local &# 039;unhappiness&# 039; - 37 planning appeals involving opposition to fast food outlets in Victoria over 1969 - 2012.
