5|$|The {{abundance}} of barium is 0.0425% in the Earth's crust and 13µg/L in sea water. The primary commercial source of barium is barite (also called <b>barytes</b> or heavy spar), a barium sulfate mineral. with deposits {{in many parts}} of the world. Another commercial source, far less important than barite, is witherite, a barium carbonate mineral. The main deposits are located in England, Romania, and the former USSR.|$|E

Minerals found in the state include limestone, reserves of oil and natural gas, manganese, asbestos, iron ore, ball clay, fire clay, gold diamonds, graphite, dolomite, quartz, tungsten, steatitic, feldspar, silica sand. It has about one third of India's limestone reserves and is known for large exclusive deposits of <b>barytes</b> and galaxy granite in the international market.|$|E
500|$|These {{areas were}} {{the centre of}} a major mining industry; this is {{reflected}} in areas of contaminated rough ground known locally as [...] "gruffy"; the word [...] "gruffy" [...] is thought to derive from the closely packed shafts that were sunk to extract lead ore from veins near the surface. Calamine, manganese, iron, copper and <b>barytes</b> were also mined.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Baryte</b> or barite (BaSO4) is {{a mineral}} {{consisting}} of barium sulfate. [...] The <b>baryte</b> group consists of <b>baryte,</b> celestine, anglesite and anhydrite. <b>Baryte</b> is generally white or colorless, {{and is the}} main source of barium. <b>Baryte</b> and celestine form a solid solution (Ba,Sr)SO4.|$|R
50|$|<b>Baryte,</b> BaS04, is an {{extremely}} stable mineral. Under surface and near surface conditions it is far less soluble in aqueous solutions than are the barium carbonate minerals witherite BaC03, barytocalcite BaCa(C03)2 and alstonite BaCa(C03)2, so <b>baryte</b> replaces the more soluble minerals. This is demonstrated by the numerous pseudomorphs and partial pseudomorphs of <b>baryte</b> after these carbonates. The sharp pointed crystals of <b>baryte</b> that occur, particularly where witherite is also present, are secondary in nature, forming from witherite. The change from witherite to <b>baryte,</b> however, can also go the other way, with barium carbonates, particularly witherite, replacing <b>baryte.</b> Replacement of <b>baryte</b> by both barytocalcite and witherite has occurred on a significant scale at Rampgill mine.|$|R
25|$|The barium {{source was}} either {{witherite}} (BaCO3) or <b>baryte</b> (BaSO4). The rarity of witherite may favor <b>baryte</b> {{as the most}} likely source. <b>Baryte</b> has a slower decomposition rate and so favors Han blue production. Witherite conversely favors Han purple. In the use of <b>baryte,</b> lead salts (lead carbonate or lead oxide) would have been needed to increase yield. Lead has been detected in association with Han purple and Han blue.|$|R
500|$|Sedimentary rocks {{dominate}} the southern {{half of the}} island, especially Old and New Red Sandstone. Some of these sandstones contain fulgurites - pitted marks {{that may have been}} created by Permian lightning strikes. Large aeolian sand dunes are preserved in Permian sandstones near Brodick, showing the presence of an ancient desert. Within the central complex are subsided blocks of Triassic sandstone and marl, Jurassic shale, and even a rare example of Cretaceous chalk. [...] During the 19th century <b>barytes</b> was mined near Sannox. First discovered in 1840, nearly 5,000 tons were produced between 1853 and 1862.

50|$|Dereenalomane <b>Barytes</b> Mine was {{originally}} {{worked as a}} copper mine Traill and Thomas in 1840, producing 19 tons of copper, before shifting to barium sulphate, a heavy white mineral, (used for paint, papermaking, etc.) Josiah Wedgwood used it for making pottery. Geologist T. D. Triphook, was involved in 1854 when it {{was known as the}} Bandon <b>Barytes</b> Mines. From 1860 the mine was managed by Charles Thomas, a Cornish Mining Captain, followed by George Ellis in the 1870s. From 1820 to 1920 intermittently when 2,500 tons were raised in 1851 compared to only 800 tons in three other centres in the former United Kingdom. The material was washed, dried, crushed and milled. It was packed into bags and sent to an island jetty in Dunmanus Bay by a 1.23 mi aerial ropeway. In 1917 a major fire caused extensive damage including the underground workings. Although repairs were carried out the mine never reached its former output. Mining historian Grenville AJ Cole regarded it as the first in Ireland and one of the earliest in the world. The companies listed as having worked the mine were, Marty Dennis and Co., British <b>Barytes</b> Co., Durrus <b>Barytes</b> Co., Mount Gabriel <b>Barytes</b> and Umber Co., Irish <b>Barytes</b> and Umber Co., Dereenlomane, <b>Barytes</b> Mines Ltd., Dunmanus <b>Barytes</b> Mines Ltd.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Barytes</b> The {{carboniferous}} uplands of the Dartry {{mountain range}} {{have been associated}} with the mining of <b>Barytes</b> ore for more than 120 years. <b>Barytes</b> ore is a very heavy inert mineral which makes it ideal for a number of different products such as paits and pottery and its inertness the fact it blocks radiation makes it ideal for use in nuclear power stations. The first recorded <b>Barytes</b> mining operation in Ballintrillick was in 1858 between then and 1979 six separate companies worked the ore. While there are considerable deposits remaining they are currently viewed as uneconomical to mine The <b>Barytes</b> ore was transported by the use of a narrow gauge railway to the nearby fishing village of Mullaghmore from where much of the ore was exported ...|$|E

5000|$|... 69-77% of <b>baryte</b> {{worldwide}} {{is used as}} a {{weighting agent}} for drilling fluids in oil and gas exploration to suppress high formation pressures and prevent blowouts. As a well is drilled, the bit passes through various formations, each with different characteristics. The deeper the hole, the more <b>baryte</b> is needed {{as a percentage of the}} total mud mix. An additional benefit of <b>baryte</b> is that it is non-magnetic and thus does not interfere with magnetic measurements taken in the borehole, either during logging-while-drilling or in separate drill hole logging. <b>Baryte</b> used for drilling petroleum wells can be black, blue, brown or gray depending on the ore body. The <b>baryte</b> is finely ground so that at least 97% of the material, by weight, can pass through a 200-mesh (75 μm) screen, and no more than 30%, by weight, can be less than 6 μm diameter. The ground <b>baryte</b> also must be dense enough so that its specific gravity is 4.2 or greater, soft enough to not damage the bearings of a tricone drill bit, chemically inert, and containing no more than 250 milligrams per kilogram of soluble alkaline salts. In August 2010 API (American Petroleum Institute) published specifications to modify the 4.2 drilling grade standards for <b>baryte</b> to include 4.1 SG materials.|$|R
