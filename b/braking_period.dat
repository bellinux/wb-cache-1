During the <b>braking</b> <b>period,</b> the proposed method only changes the switching sequence of the inverter to control the inverse torque so that the braking energy {{will return to the}} battery. Compared with the presented methods, the proposed solution simultaneously achieves dual goals of the electric brake and the energy regeneration without using additional converter, ultra capacitor, or complex winding-changeover technique. Since the braking kinetic energy is converted into the electrical energy and then returns to the battery, the energy regeneration could increase the efficiency of BLDCM drive.

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the use of onboard supercapacitors for metro trains. The {{practical}} utilization of supercapacitors requires suitable power converters for the regulation of power flows between the catenary and the electrical drives of the power-train. These converters operate in dc current and have to be bi-directional in order to allow the charge and discharge of supercapacitors. The mathematical model of the whole electrical drive has been developed and the main features of the control strategy have been presented. The control is capable of limiting the peak currents of the contact line and recovering partially the kinetic energy of the train during the <b>braking</b> <b>periods.</b> Simulations prove that the suggested control strategy is very effective for both purposes.

To verify the validity of the hydraulic system, by using AMESim software, the simulation model of the hydraulic system was built and the performance analyzed.

40|$|Abstract. The {{process of}} braking is {{important}} in automotive performance, which impacts the safety of traffic. Several parameters of braking can be determined on stationary test stands, however, more accurate data {{that can be used}} in a more simple way in practise are gained by doing tests on the road. Based on EU legal documents on determining parameters of braking, a research methodology has been elaborated and approbated for determining parameters of braking for automobiles in road tests. To determine the parameters of braking, scientific radar Stalker ATS transferring data to a computer were used. Road tests were done for automobiles of various age groups and constructions, determining the period, distance, and deceleration rate of braking. According to the research data, the parameters of braking of the used automobiles comply with the standard for parameters of braking set by the EU. The effectiveness of parameters of braking does not mostly depend on the age of automobiles, but on the technical condition of the brake system.

40|$|A parallel-hybrid {{electric}} vehicle usually employs two power sources, an engine and an electric motor/generator, {{to drive a}} vehicle. Typically, the electric motor receives power stored in batteries to drive the vehicle at low vehicle speeds. Both the electric motor and the engine provide power to the vehicle for maximal acceleration and/or hill climbing. The engine alone drives the vehicle and, at the same time, charges the batteries via the electric motor/generator during highway cruising. And during <b>braking</b> <b>periods,</b> the kinetic energy of the vehicle is used to recharge the batteries. For such a parallel hybrid {{electric vehicle}} to function properly, an electro-mechanical system that manages the power flow among the two power sources and the vehicle i necessary.

The proposed mechanism can provide a vehicle with six different operating modes including a continuous variable transmission capability to optimize the performance, improve the fuel economy, and reduce the hazardous emissions. To illustrate the capability of the gearbox, kinematics, statics, and power flow analysis are performed {{for each of the}} six operation modes...|$|R
40|$|In {{the paper}} the {{possibility}} of improving the energy recovered during the braking of railway vehicles and reduction of power peaks during accelerating are discussed. The energy available from the regenerative braking of the motor is stored into supercapacitor sets placed on board and reused subsequently for the acceleration of the train. This auxiliary storage system allows {{the reduction of the}} losses on the line, because the power peaks are shaved by supercapacitors and, hence, the rms power supplied is reduced. In addition, also the energy consumption of the train can be reduced respect to traditional convoys, especially if the characteristic duty cycle presents many accelerations and <b>braking</b> <b>periods</b> as the case of subways trains. The set of supercapacitors needs the use of an intermediate dc/dc converter in order to harmonize the voltage with that of the dc-link of the drive and control the power flows of the supercapacitors. The mathematical model of the whole system and the control strategy of energy management are presented. The actual possibilities of the energy recovery are shown by means of numeric simulations and expressed in percentage respect to the energy drawn during accelerations. The control strategy has been experimentally validated on a scale system made of an asynchronous drive supplied by a dc source and a set of supercapacitors as auxiliary storage device...|$|R

40|$|Automobile {{braking system}} is {{considered}} {{as one of the}} most important safety systems in modern vehicles as its main intention is to stop or decelerate the vehicle. The frictional heat generated between the pads and disc during the braking application can cause various negative impacts, such as brake fade, thermal cracks, disc thickness variation and wear. This project studied the transient thermal behavior of a disc brake system during the braking phase and the followed releasing period. A three-dimensional finite element model with a moving heat source was developed with COMSOL Multiphysics to predict the temperature distribution in the disc braking system, including two pads, a rotor disc, bolts, and a section of the shaft. The maximum surface temperature on the contact surface has been found to increase in the <b>braking</b> <b>period</b> and then decrease as the rotor slows down and further decrease during the releasing period. The maximum temperature on the contact surface depends on both the car velocity and deceleration rate. The effects of convective and radiative heat transfer are also studied. It is found that heat is mainly dissipated through convective heat transfer at the disc surfaces...|$|E
40|$|Regenerative braking {{provides}} {{an effective way}} of extending the driving range of battery powered electric vehicles (EVs). This paper analyzes the equivalent power circuit and operation principles of an EV using regenerative braking control technology. During the <b>braking</b> <b>period,</b> the switching sequence of the power converter is controlled to inverse the output torque of the three-phase brushless direct-current (DC) motor, so that the braking energy can {{be returned to the}} battery. Compared with the presented methods, this technology can achieve several goals: energy recovery, electric braking, ultra-quiet braking and extending the driving range. Merits and drawbacks of different braking control strategy are further elaborated. State-space model of the EVs under energy-regenerative braking operation is established, considering that parameter variations are unavoidable due to temperature change, measured error, un-modeled dynamics, external disturbance and time-varying system parameters, a sliding mode robust controller (SMRC) is designed and implemented. Phase current and DC-link voltage are selected as the state variables, respectively. The corresponding control law is also provided. The proposed control scheme is compared with a conventional proportional-integral (PI) controller. A laboratory EV for experiment is setup to verify the proposed scheme. Experimental results show that the drive range of EVs can be improved about 17 % using the proposed controller with energy-regeneration control...|$|E
40|$|Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEVs) utilize energy {{both from}} {{internal}} combustion engine and an electric drive system. For an efficient energy management between two different power sources, an effective control strategy is needed. A governing algorithm is required which is developed and verified by using a lab scale plant model that is verified by sample plant simulations. An effective energy management can minimize fuel consumption and reduce emissions. The algorithm that is developed in this study consists of a finite state machine and a charge depleting control, which are mainly based on some rules and an optimal control strategy. The work involves integration of a secondary power source on an existing karting vehicle. The goal is to efficiently capture the released energy during the <b>braking</b> <b>period</b> and utilize this energy to supplement power need during acceleration. A full model of the system has been constructed using the commercially available code MATLAB/Simulink. In addition, an experimental test system has been constructed to validate modeling and simulation work.

Lead acid batteries provided low cost and robustness {{at the expense of}} extra weight. Ultracapacitor storage elements have been also studied to determine level of system efficiency gains due to light weight and rapid charge/discharge characteristics at the expense of extra cost.

40|$|International audienceTruck drivers {{typically}} display different behaviors when facing various driving events, e. g., {{approaching a}} roundabout, and thereby {{have a major}} impact both on the fuel consumption and the vehicle speed. Within the context where fuel is increasingly a major cost center for merchandise transport companies, {{it is important to recognize}} different driver behaviors in order to be able to simulate them as closely to the real data as possible during the truck development process. In this paper, we introduce, instead of economic driving, the notion of rational driving which seeks to decrease the average fuel consumption while respecting the transport companies’ constraint, i. e., the delivery delay. Moreover, we also propose an indicator, namely rational driving index (RDI), which enables to quantify how good a driver behavior is with respect to the rational driving. We then investigate various driving features contributing to characterize a rational driver behavior, using real driving data collected from 34 different truck drivers on an extra-urban road section particularly representative of travel paths of trucks ensuring regional merchandise distribution. Given the fact that real driving data collected on an open road can differ in terms of environment, e. g.,weather, trafﬁc, we further study, through simulations on a digital representation of a roundabout, the impact of two major driving features, i. e., the use of coasting and crossing speed at roundabouts, with respect to rational driving. The experimental results from both real driving data and simulations show high correlations of these two driving features with respect to RDI and demonstrate that a good rational driver tends to decelerate slowly during <b>braking</b> <b>periods</b> (use of coasting) and have high crossing speed in roundabouts...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} a novel {{regenerative}} dual braking strategy is proposed for utility/goods delivery unmanned vehicles in public roads, which improves the regenerative energy capturing ability and consequently improves the fuel use of parallel hybrid power train configurations for land unmanned vehicles where the priority is not comfort but extending the range. Furthermore, the analysis {{takes into account}} the power handling ability of the electric motor and the power converters. In previous research a plethora of regenerative braking strategies is shown, for this paper the key contribution is that the vehicle electric regeneration is related to a fixed braking distance in relation to the energy storage capabilities specifically for unmanned utility type land vehicles where passenger comfort is not a concern but pedestrian safety is of critical importance. Furthermore, the vehicle’s power converter capabilities facilitate the process of extending the braking time via introducing a variable deceleration profile. The proposed approach has therefore resulted in a regenerative algorithm which improves the vehicle’s energy storage capability without considering comfort since this analysis is applicable to unmanned vehicles. The algorithm considers the distance as the key parameter, which is associated to safety, therefore it allows the <b>braking</b> time <b>period</b> to be extended thus favouring the electric motor generation process while sustaining safety. This method allows the vehicle to <b>brake</b> for longer <b>periods</b> rather than short bursts hence resulting in a more effective regeneration with reduced use of the dual (i. e. caliper/stepper motor brake system). The regeneration method and analysis is addressed in the following paper sections. The simulation results show that the proposed regenerative braking strategy has improved significantly the energy recapturing ability of the hybrid power train configuration. The paper is also supported with experimental data that verify the theoretical development and the simulation results. The two strategies developed and implemented are Constant Braking Torque (CBT) and Constant Braking Power (CBP). Both methods were limited to a fixed safety-based distance. Overall the results demonstrate that the CBT method results in better energy-based savings...|$|R

40|$|An {{electric}} traction motor drive for an electric karting application was modeled for efficiency studies and simulated using the Matlab®/Simulink® software. In this thesis, the {{electric traction}} motor drive model includes models of battery, power electronic converter, and electric motor losses {{related to a}} typical 48 seconds track driving schedule. The important losses within a typical electric motor such as stator copper, rotor copper, and core losses were modeled and simulated over the entire speed range. A power electronic converter was modeled; including the switching and conduction losses for both MOSFETs and the anti parallel power diodes. The energy storage was modeled as a generic model capable of representing losses {{and the state of}} charge (SOC) of the battery over the driving cycles. The energy captured during regenerative braking was also considered in the simulation. Finally, the overall electric traction motor drive system efficiency was estimated based on the individual model based efficiency analysis. The battery and induction motor parameters, which were used in the simulation, were calculated using the measurement data obtained through laboratory tests. The complete electric traction drive system was simulated and observed using the drive cycle of the ICE karting at the race day for 48 seconds (one lap). The total average efficiency of the electric drive system is 66. 7 %. The average power of the electric motor was 5. 4 kW and the total energy consumed by this electric traction drive system was 920 Wh for one whole race.

In this design a separate turbine and power take-off shaft was bolted onto the exhaust of the engine core, the hot gases of the engine powering the turbine, and thus the tank. Since the engine core was entirely separate from the power take-off, torque was available immediately because the core could be left running at full speed while generating small amounts of power, the unneeded gases being [...] "dumped". This design had a serious problem, however; when the load was removed, during gear shifts for instance, the power turbine was unloaded and could race out of control. Either the power turbine had to be <b>braked</b> during these <b>periods,</b> or the gas flow from the engine core had to be dumped.|$|R
40|$|New CCD {{photometric}} {{observations of}} UZ Leo were obtained between February 2012 and April 2013, and on February 2017. Its physical properties {{were derived from}} detailed analyses of our light curves and existing radial velocities. The results indicate that this system is a totally-eclipsing A-subtype overcontact binary with both a high fill-out factor of 76 % and a third light source contributing 12 % light in the B bandpass, 10 % in V, and 7 % in R. The light residuals between observations and theoretical models are satisfactorily fitted by adopting a magnetic cool spot on the more massive primary star. Including our 12 measurements, a total of 172 eclipse times were used for ephemeris computations. We found that the orbital period of UZ Leo has varied due to a periodic oscillation superposed on an upward parabolic variation. The observed period increase {{at a rate of}} + 3. 49 × 10 ^- 7 d yr^- 1 can be plausibly explained by some combination of non-conservative mass transfer from the secondary to the primary component and angular momentum loss due to magnetic <b>braking.</b> The <b>period</b> and semi-amplitude of the oscillation are about 139 yrs and 0. 0225 d, respectively, which is interpreted as a light-time effect due to a third component with a mass of M_ 3 sin i_ 3 = 0. 30 M_. Because the third lights of 7 - 12 % indicate that the circumbinary object is very overluminous for its mass, it would possibly match a white dwarf, rather than an M-type main sequence.

40|$|International audienceThe {{purpose of}} this study is to {{evaluate}} an impact of convective mode of heat transfer on the thermal behaviour of a disc brake system during repetitive braking process with the constant velocity using fully three-dimensional finite element model. The transient thermal analysis to determine the temperature distributions on the contact surface of a disc brake is performed. The issue of non-uniform frictional heating effects of mutual slipping of a disc over fixed pads is tested using FE models with the several possible to occur in automotive application heat transfer coefficients. To have a possibility of comparison of the temperature distributions of a disc during cyclic brake application, the energy transformed during time of every analyzed case of braking process and the subsequent release periods was equal. The time-stepping procedure is employed to develop moving heat source as the boundary heat flux acting interchangeably with the convective cooling terms. The difficulties accounted for the accurate simulation of heating during spin of the rotor is omitted by the use of the code, which enable shaping curves responsible for the thermal flux entering the disc at subsequent moments of time. The resulting evolution of temperature on the friction surface reveals a wide range of variations, distinguishing periods of heating and cooling states. It has been established, that during single braking the convective cooling has insignificant influence on the temperature distributions of a disc brake, consequently is not able to prevent overheat problem. However the <b>brake</b> release <b>period</b> after the <b>braking</b> operation, when the velocity of the vehicle remains on the same level, results in considerable decrease of temperature...|$|R
40|$|AM Her {{variables}} [...] synchronised magnetic cataclysmic variables (CVs) [...] {{exhibit a}} different period distribution from other CVs across the period gap. We show that non-AM Her systems may infiltrate the longer-period {{end of the}} period gap if they are metal-deficient, but that the position and width of the gap in orbital period is otherwise insensitive to other binary parameters (excepting the normalisation of the braking rate). In AM Her binaries, magnetic braking is reduced as the wind from the secondary star may be trapped within the magnetosphere of the white dwarf primary. This reduced <b>braking</b> fills the <b>period</b> gap from its short-period end as the dipole magnetic moment of the white dwarf increases. The consistency of these models with the observed distribution of CVs, both AM Her and non-AM Her type, provides compelling evidence supporting magnetic braking as the agent of angular momentum loss among long-period CVs, and its disruption as the explanation of the 2 - 3 hour period gap among nonmagnetic CVs.
