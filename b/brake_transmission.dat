40|$|The use of {{positioning}} systems {{in a vehicle}} is a research intensive field. In {{the first part of}} this thesis an increase in new applications is disclosed through a mapping of patent documents on how {{positioning systems}} can support adaptive cruise control, gear changing systems and engine control. Many ideas are presented and explained and the ideas are valued. Furthermore, a new method for selective catalytic reduction (SCR) control using a positioning system is introduced. It is concluded that look-ahead control, where the vehicle position in relation to the upcoming road section is utilized could give better fuel efficiency, lower emissions and less <b>brake,</b> <b>transmission</b> and engine wear. In the second part of this thesis a real time test platform for predictive speed control algorithms has been developed and tested in a real truck. Previously such algorithms could only be simulated. In this thesis an algorithm which utilizes model predictive control (MPC) and dynamic programming (DP) been implemented and evaluated. An initial comparative fuel test shows a reduction in fuel consumption when the MPC algorithm is used...|$|E

50|$|A small {{aluminum}} two-seater coupe {{was developed}} by Intermeccanica, based on the Steyr-Daimler-Puch 500 cc car. The Puch was a hybrid, with part Fiat 500 chassis and body and part Puch mechanicals, namely a 500 cc air-cooled opposed twin engine, special <b>brakes,</b> <b>transmission</b> etc. After a presentation of the prototype car to Steyr-Daimler-Puch AG in Graz, Austria, a series of these small coupes were built, 21 in number. Some were touring cars, and some lightened for racing. The IMP won the 500cc class one year at Nurburgring.|$|R

50|$|Swapping {{the engine}} may have {{implications}} on the cars safety, performance, handling and reliability. The new engine may be lighter or {{heavier than the}} existing one which affects the amount of weight over the nearest axle and the overall weight of the car - this can adversely affect the car's ride, handling and braking ability. Existing <b>brakes,</b> <b>transmission</b> and suspension components may be inadequate to handle the increased weight and/or power of the new engine with either upgrades being required or premature wear and failure being likely.|$|R

50|$|The 2.15 liter engine (bore {{and stroke}} of 80 x 107 mm) of the 134 and 134N was a four-cylinder {{version of the}} 3.2 litre, four-bearing {{overhead}} valve inline-six from the 135, itself based on a lorry engine. Power was 50 hp at 3800 rpm. Like the 135, the 134s featured independent, leaf-sprung front suspension, a live rear axle, and cable operated Bendix <b>brakes.</b> <b>Transmission</b> was either a four-speed manual or a four-speed Cotal pre-selector. A total of 340 134N were built, of which about 100 post war (these are almost entirely identical to 1939 models), mainly for the domestic market.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to the narrow V engine, another first for Lancia were brakes on all four wheels. The first examples produced left the factory with rear wheel brakes only and were upgraded later. The brake pedal acted on the front <b>brakes</b> and <b>transmission</b> <b>brake,</b> while the rears were actuated via a hand lever.The rest of the mechanicals were as on other coeval Lancia models: ladder frame, solid axles front and rear with semi-elliptic leaf springs and Hartford dampers.|$|R

50|$|The <b>transmission</b> <b>brake</b> is {{provided}} solely as a parking brake or handbrake. Normal wheel brakes are still provided for use when driving, drum brakes originally, now almost always disc brakes. Driver's manuals usually caution against using the <b>transmission</b> <b>brake</b> when driving, {{as it is}} neither powerful enough nor robust enough and so will not work effectively and may even be damaged by trying to stop a moving vehicle.|$|R

50|$|Historically, {{some early}} cars used <b>transmission</b> <b>brakes</b> as the normal driving brake and often had wheel brakes {{on only one}} axle, if that. In current vehicles, these brakes are now rare. They are found in some makes, notably Land Rover, usually for light {{off-road}} vehicles. Simple <b>transmission</b> <b>brakes</b> {{could be found in}} large vehicles too, such as the 16 inch single disc parking brake used in the M19 Tank Transporter of World War II.|$|R
50|$|As the <b>transmission</b> <b>brake</b> {{is mounted}} inboard {{of the final}} drive and its {{reduction}} gearing, the brake rotates relatively faster, but with less torque, than a wheel brake. The apparently undersized <b>transmission</b> <b>brake</b> thus has more holding ability than its small size might suggest, but is less suitable for driving loads. The braking forces would also be passed through the final drive and axle drive shafts, with possible risk of overloading them.|$|R

50|$|The Palmerston had a 6-9 hp Coventry-Victor water cooled, flat {{twin engine}} driving {{the rear wheels}} through a cone clutch, {{separately}} mounted three speed gearbox and bevel geared rear axle. The brakes acted on the rear wheels using a hand lever with the foot <b>brake</b> operating a <b>transmission</b> <b>brake</b> on the drive shaft behind the gearbox. The steel section chassis had quarter elliptic leaf springs front and rear. The early cars had wire spoked wheels later replaced by steel disc type.|$|R

While generally such hack demonstrations like remote activation of the horn or windshield wipers/washers fall into the [...] "annoying or amusing" [...] category, other hacks involving the accelerator, <b>brakes,</b> and <b>transmission</b> have much more serious security and safety implications.|$|R
50|$|The player {{views the}} race from a {{top-down}} perspective, {{and the screen}} scrolls from right to left. The player's car maneuvers only on a vertical axis, and loses a little speed when it does so. The joystick's button is the throttle: Depressing it accelerates, and releasing it decelerates. Pressing the joystick leftward applies the <b>brake.</b> The <b>transmission</b> audibly shifts as the player's car accelerates and decelerates.|$|R

The Car of Tomorrow has also been setting pole speeds slower than the Xfinity Series cars at companion races.|$|R

50|$|There is {{essentially}} {{no difference in}} efficiency between the technique of bypassing the throttle butterfly and operating the butterfly itself. The IAC allows the ECU to maintain minimum RPM irrespective of changes in engine load, {{sometimes referred to as}} anti-stall feature.
