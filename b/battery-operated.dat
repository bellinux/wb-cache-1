5|$|The {{police found}} five {{passports}} on Martin {{in addition to}} his own—two British passports issued to Simon Davis, two Canadian passports issued to Sheila and Darin Damude, and a South African passport issued to Gerard Lowe—each with Martin's photograph affixed. They also found credit cards belonging to Sheila Damude and Gerard Lowe. In addition, police found Simon Davis' birth certificate, and items that Martin had used to immobilise and kill: a hammer weighing 1.5kilogrammes (3.3lb), a <b>battery-operated</b> Z-Force III electroshock weapon, a can of mace, two pairs of handcuffs, a pair of thumbcuffs, two Police brand foldable knives, an oilstone and two Swiss army knives. Importation of some of these into Singapore is illegal.|$|E
5|$|The primary {{types of}} visual {{signalling}} were Semaphore flags, lamps and flags, lamps and lights, and the heliograph. In open warfare, visual signalling (employing signal flags and the heliograph) was the norm. A competent signaller could transmit 12 {{words a minute}} with signal flags (during daylight) and signal lights (at night). Signal lights, which were secured in a wooden case, employed a <b>battery-operated</b> Morse code key. These signalling techniques had certain disadvantages, however. In trench warfare, operators using these methods were forced to expose themselves to enemy fire; while messages sent to the rear by signal lights could not be seen by enemy forces, replies to such messages were readily spotted, and operators were, once again, exposed to enemy fire.|$|E

25|$|The Government of Tamil Nadu {{provides}} {{funds for}} paying the zoo staff {{and maintenance of}} zoo vehicles. Other expenditures, such as maintenance of animal enclosures, feed for animals, animal health care, maintenance of zoo, drainage, water, electricity and maintenance of <b>battery-operated</b> vehicles, are met from the income generated by the zoo, chiefly {{by means of the}} entry fee. Income is also generated from <b>battery-operated</b> vehicle (BOV) charges, elephant rides, toilets lease, bicycle charges from TI cycles, the leased parking area and food and beverages outlets such as Hotel Tamil Nadu, Aavin, and TANTEA. The yearly budget of the park for its developmental and maintenance work is approved by the governing board.|$|E

Specification include an electronic tachometer, <b>battery-operated</b> turn signals and heavy-duty suspension front and rear. This model, which has the overall dimensions of a full-sized motorcycle was the biggest machine sold by Batavus.|$|E
25|$|When toys {{have been}} outgrown or {{are no longer}} wanted, reuse is {{sometimes}} considered. They can be donated via many charities such as Goodwill Industries and the Salvation Army, sold at garage sales, auctioned, sometimes even donated to museums. However, when toys are broken, worn out or otherwise unfit for use, care should be taken when disposing of them. Donated or resold toys should be gently used, clean and have all parts. Before disposal of any <b>battery-operated</b> toy, batteries should be removed and recycled; some communities demand this be done. Some manufacturers, such as Little Tikes, will take back and recycle their products.|$|E
25|$|Commercial smoke {{detectors}} are either conventional or addressable, and {{are connected to}} security alarm or fire alarm systems controlled by fire alarm control panels (FACP). These {{are the most common}} type of detector, and are usually significantly more expensive than single-station <b>battery-operated</b> residential smoke alarms. They are used in most commercial and industrial facilities and other places such as ships and trains, but are also part of some security alarm systems in homes. These detectors don't need to have built in alarms, as alarm systems can be controlled by the connected FACP, which will set off relevant alarms, and can also implement complex functions such as a staged evacuation.|$|E
25|$|During {{beta testing}} of Yahoo! Answers in 2005, the Director of Product Management {{would use a}} Gemmy Kung Fu Hamster to summon {{employees}} to meetings.

25|$|Recently, {{researchers}} have added medical sensors into these toilets, which can measure the blood sugar {{based on the}} urine, and also measure the pulse, blood pressure, and the body fat content of the user. Talking toilets that greet the user have also started being made. Other measurements are currently being researched. The data may automatically be sent to a doctor through a built-in internet-capable cellular telephone. However, these devices are still very rare in Japan, and their future commercial success is difficult to predict. A voice-operated toilet that understands verbal commands is under development. TOTO, NAiS (a division of Panasonic), and other companies also produce portable, <b>battery-operated</b> travel washlets, which must be filled with warm water before use.|$|E
25|$|Tube heaters {{may also}} fail without warning, {{especially}} if exposed to over voltage or {{as a result}} of manufacturing defects. Tube heaters do not normally fail by evaporation like lamp filaments, since they operate at much lower temperature. The surge of inrush current when the heater is first energized causes stress in the heater, and can be avoided by slowly warming the heaters, gradually increasing current with a NTC thermistor included in the circuit. Tubes intended for series-string operation of the heaters across the supply have a specified controlled warm-up time to avoid excess voltage on some heaters as others warm up. Directly heated filament-type cathodes as used in <b>battery-operated</b> tubes or some rectifiers may fail if the filament sags, causing internal arcing. Excess heater-to-cathode voltage in indirectly heated cathodes can break down the insulation between elements and destroy the heater.|$|E
25|$|In January 2005, P {{announced}} {{the acquisition of}} Gillette, forming the largest consumer goods company and placing Unilever into second place. This added brands such as Gillette razors, Duracell, Braun, and Oral-B to their stable. The acquisition {{was approved by the}} European Union and the Federal Trade Commission, with conditions to a spinoff of certain overlapping brands. P agreed to sell its SpinBrush <b>battery-operated</b> electric toothbrush business to Church & Dwight, and Gillette's Rembrandt toothpaste line to Johnson & Johnson. The deodorant brands Right Guard, Soft and Dri, and Dry Idea were sold to Dial Corporation. The companies officially merged on October 1, 2005. Liquid Paper and Gillette's stationery division, Paper Mate, were sold to Newell Rubbermaid. In 2008, P branched into the record business with its sponsorship of Tag Records, as an endorsement for TAG Body Spray.|$|E
25|$|After {{capsizing}} {{the main}} engines of Finn-Baltic immediately {{went out and}} the emergency diesel generator started automatically. However, it ran only {{for a short time}} and after a while even <b>battery-operated</b> lights dimmed and died out. The chief engineer heard someone yelling in the darkness and found the chief officer from the corridor outside the control room in a shock-like state. After getting a case of soft drinks from the ship's stores and dry clothes for the chief officer they waited several hours in the switchboard room, until the rising water forced them to move to the aftmost part of the engine room next to the propeller shaft. Even before the accident the chief engineer had planned to find his way to this location in case the vessel capsized because there was no double bottom and, once free of its cargo, the combination would stay afloat upside-down. After 20 minutes they heard someone banging the hull outside the ship.|$|E
25|$|Around 1966 AMT {{obtained}} the plastic model rights to Star Trek {{and developed a}} model kit of the Starship Enterprise, beginning a long association between AMT, science fiction and television. The original model of the Enterprise was equipped with <b>battery-operated</b> lights, but even after the lights were deleted, a number of features from the lighted model persisted in the kit, including a removable main deflector assembly which had covered the battery compartment and served as an on-off switch for the lighted model. There were also little indentations in the saucer section where the light bulbs were to be placed. By the 1980s an ongoing series of revisions to the tooling to correct various inaccuracies, which unfortunately created a few new inaccuracies, such as a deflector dish that is far too small and nacelle caps which are shaped incorrectly. There was also a kit of the Klingon D-7 Battlecruiser ship seen on the TV show. It too was lighted in its first couple of issues.|$|E
500|$|In {{the twentieth}} century, some {{manufacturers}} have designed storage <b>battery-operated,</b> self-propelled models, which they claim are a better, cleaner and greener alternative to gasoline and diesel fuel fire trucks. These {{are said to}} be better suited for particular types of environments, e.g., hotels and resorts, manufacturing facilities. Harnessing battery power is an old idea, going back to the nineteen hundreds. [...] It joins an increasingly longer list of production <b>battery-operated</b> vehicles.|$|E
500|$|The {{electric}} {{fire engine}} was proposed [...] {{to replace the}} steam pumper fire engines used for fighting and extinguishing [...] fires in the 19th century. The fire engine's water pump, used to distribute water {{to put out a}} fire, would be operated by an electric motor instead of steam. The electric motor was claimed to be simpler, cleaner, and faster in operation, and would save money, and require less maintenance than the steam fire engine. There are a few modern <b>battery-operated</b> models, although the environs in which they are used are limited.|$|E
500|$|Igloo White {{consisted}} of three interrelated parts. The <b>battery-operated</b> sensors would be monitored by an airborne command and control center (ABCCC), which would relay the information to an infiltration surveillance center (ISC), located at Nakhon Phanom Air Base, Thailand. Computers at the ISC would collate and analyze the data and then relay target coordinates to the ABCCC which would, in turn, direct strike aircraft to the targets. The hand emplacement of sensors and bomb damage assessment missions were {{to be carried out}} by the reconnaissance teams of the highly classified Military Assistance Command, Vietnam Studies and Observations Group (SOG), which already operated [...] "over the fence" [...] in Laos. Construction began on the ISC on 6 July 1967 and was completed within three months.|$|E
500|$|Authentic 1960s {{associated}} {{media for}} Joe 90 included a Century 21 Toys range comprising friction-drive and <b>battery-operated</b> versions of Professor McClaine's Jet Air Car and Sam Loover's futuristic saloon.

Joe 90 was also given its own weekly comic, Joe 90 Top Secret, which ran for 34 issues and narrated the TV episodes in strip form, while also including strips {{based on the}} TV series The Champions and Land of the Giants. In September 1969, Joe 90 Top Secret merged with the established Anderson tie-in TV21 (previously titled TV Century 21), which then {{came to be known}} as TV21 and Joe 90. After a further 36 issues, Joe 90 strips were dropped from the comic and the new title discontinued in favour of the original TV21.|$|E

2500|$|Many Japanese {{women are}} embarrassed {{at the thought}} of being heard by others during {{urination}} (see paruresis). To cover the sound of bodily functions, many women used to flush public toilets continuously while using them, wasting a large amount of water in the process. As education campaigns did not stop this practice, a device was introduced in the 1980s that, after activation, produces the sound of flushing water without the need for actual flushing. A Toto brand name commonly found is the [...] This device is now routinely placed in most new public women's rooms, and many older public women's rooms have been upgraded. The Otohime may be either a separate <b>battery-operated</b> device attached to the wall of the toilet, or included in an existing washlet. The device is activated by pressing a button, or by the wave of a hand in front of a motion sensor. When activated, the device creates a loud flushing sound similar to a toilet being flushed. This sound either stops after a preset time or can be halted through a second press on the button. It is estimated that this saves up to 20 liters of water per use. However, some women believe that the Otohime sounds artificial and prefer to use a continuous flushing of the toilet instead of the recorded flush of the Otohime.|$|E
2500|$|Electronic Stratego was {{introduced}} by Milton Bradley in 1982. It has features that make {{many aspects of the}} game strikingly different from those of classic Stratego. Each type of playing piece in Electronic Stratego has a unique series of bumps on its bottom that are read by the game's <b>battery-operated</b> touch-sensitive [...] "board". When attacking another piece a player hits their Strike button, presses their piece and then the targeted piece: the game either rewards a successful attack or punishes a failed strike with an appropriate bit of music. In this way the players never know for certain the rank of the piece that wins the attack, only whether the attack wins, fails, or ties (similar {{to the role of the}} referee in the Chinese game of Luzhanqi). Instead of choosing to move a piece, a player can opt to [...] "probe" [...] an opposing piece by hitting the Probe button and pressing down on the enemy piece: the game then beeps out a rough approximation of the strength of that piece. There are no Bomb pieces: Bombs are set using pegs placed on a touch-sensitive [...] "peg board" [...] that is closed from view prior to the start of the game. Hence, it is possible for a player to have their piece occupying a square with a bomb on it. If an opposing piece lands on the seemingly-empty square, the game plays the sound of an explosion and that piece is removed from play. As in classic Stratego, only a Miner can remove a Bomb from play. A player who successfully captures the opposing Flag is rewarded with a triumphant bit of music from the 1812 Overture.|$|E
