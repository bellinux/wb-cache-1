25|$|A {{suppressor}} or silencer is {{a device}} either attached to {{or part of}} the <b>barrel</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> firearm {{to reduce the amount of}} noise and flash generated by firing the weapon. It generally takes the form of a cylindrically shaped metal tube with various internal mechanisms to reduce the sound of firing by slowing the escaping propellant gas, and sometimes by reducing the velocity of the bullet. Hiram Percy Maxim, the son of famous machine gun inventor Hiram Stevens Maxim, is credited with inventing the suppressor in 1909.|$|E
25|$|Spring-loaded flex hinge temples: These flex hinges are {{equipped}} with a small spring that affords the arms a greater range of movement and does not limit them to the traditional, 90 degree angle. Repairs {{can be made by}} using Self Aligning Spring Hinge Screws. Use screw insertion pliers to push the tip beyond the first <b>barrel</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> spring hinge at a 45 degree angle and use a standard screwdriver to tighten. As the screw moves down the barrel, it will move to a 90 degree angle. When finished, use a plier to break off the excess.|$|E
25|$|The {{inefficiency}} {{was caused}} by the speed with which the uncompressed fissioning uranium expanded and became sub-critical by virtue of decreased density. Despite its inefficiency, this design, because of its shape, was adapted for use in small-diameter, cylindrical artillery shells (a gun-type warhead fired from the <b>barrel</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> much larger gun). Such warheads were deployed by the United States until 1992, accounting for a significant fraction of the U-235 in the arsenal, and were some of the first weapons dismantled to comply with treaties limiting warhead numbers. The rationale for this decision was undoubtedly a combination of the lower yield and grave safety issues associated with the gun-type design.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{the peace}} process {{launched}} in 2003, sexual assault by soldiers from armed groups and the national army continues in the eastern provinces of the country. Evidence of war rape emerged when United Nations troops move into areas previously ravaged by war after {{the peace process}} started. Gang rape and rape with objects has been reported. The victims of war rape may suffer from incontinence and vaginal fistula {{as a result of}} particularly violent rape. Witness accounts include an instance of a woman who had the <b>barrel</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> gun inserted into her vagina, after which the soldier opened fire. Incontinence and vaginal fistula leads to the isolation of war rape victims from her community and access to reconstructive surgery is limited in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.|$|E
25|$|Pacino {{was injured}} during rehearsals for a gunfight after {{he grabbed the}} <b>barrel</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> prop gun which had just been used to fire several dummy bullets. His hand stuck to the hot barrel and {{he was unable to}} remove it immediately; the injury sidelined him for two weeks. The gunfight scene also {{includes}} a single camera shot directed by Steven Spielberg, who was visiting the set at the time. During filming, some Cuban-Americans objected to the film's Cuban-American characters being portrayed as criminals by non-Cuban-American actors. To counter this, the film features a disclaimer during its credits stating that the film characters were not representative of the Cuban-American community. The entertainment industry initially hated the film, with actress Liza Minnelli asking Pacino what he had done to leave the insiders subdued at a post-screening meal. (Minnelli had not seen the film at the time.) However, during the meal, actor Eddie Murphy told Pacino that he loved the film.|$|E
25|$|The {{investigation}} into the illegal agents' payments was concluded in the summer, and the club was handed a ten-point deduction for the 2008–09 season on 3 June 2008, along with a £50,000 fine. The club's recent history of administrations meant that the Football League only offered to return the Football League Share to Luton {{on the condition that}} they play with a further twenty-point deduction. Staring down the <b>barrel</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> gun, Luton were forced to start the season with a 30-point penalty, the biggest points deduction ever handed to a club in the top four tiers of English football. Luton beat Scunthorpe United 3–2 in the Football League Trophy final in front of 40,000 of their own supporters at Wembley Stadium, but lost their League status eight days later. On 13 April 2009, Luton Town were finally relegated from the Football League after a spell of 89 years, as Chesterfield held Luton to a draw. Coupled with a victory for Mike Newell's Grimsby Town, this meant Luton's survival in the league became mathematically impossible to achieve.|$|E

25|$|As {{a result}} of the First Liberian Civil War, 80,000 {{refugees}} fled neighboring Liberia for the Sierra Leone – Liberian border. This displaced population, composed almost entirely of children, would prove to be an invaluable asset to the invading rebel armies because the refugee and detention centers, populated first by displaced Liberians and later by Sierra Leoneans, helped provide the manpower for the RUF’s insurgency. The RUF took advantage of the refugees, who were abandoned, starving, and in dire need of medical attention, by promising food, shelter, medical care, and looting and mining profits in return for their support. When this method of recruitment failed, as it often did for the RUF, youths were often coerced at the <b>barrel</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> gun to join the ranks of the RUF. After being forced to join, many child soldiers learned that the complete lack of law – as {{a result of}} the civil war – provided a unique opportunity for self-empowerment through violence and thus continued to support the rebel cause.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} wave of raids across Northern Ireland, 342 people were arrested.

There were claims of soldiers smashing their way into houses without warning and firing baton rounds through doors and windows. Many of those arrested also reported being ill-treated during their three-day detention at the holding centres. They complained of being beaten, verbally abused, threatened, harassed by dogs, denied sleep, and starved. Some reported being forced to run a gauntlet of baton-wielding soldiers, being forced to run an 'obstacle course', having their heads forcefully shaved, being kept naked, being burnt with cigarettes, having a sack placed over their heads for long periods, having a rope kept around their necks, having the <b>barrel</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> gun pressed against their heads, being dragged by the hair, being trailed behind armoured vehicles while barefoot, and being tied to armoured trucks as a human shield. Some were hooded, beaten and then thrown from a helicopter. They were told they were hundreds of feet in the air, but were actually only {{a few feet from the}} ground.|$|E

500|$|All of the Eon Bond films {{feature the}} unique gun barrel sequence, created by graphic artist Maurice Binder, {{which has been}} called by British media {{historian}} James Chapman [...] "the trademark motif of the series". As Bond walks across the screen, he is viewed by the audience through the <b>barrel</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> gun trained on him by an unknown assailant. Bond wheels around and shoots directly at the gun/viewer, followed by the assassin's blood spilling down the barrel/screen. It was originally filmed in sepia by putting a pinhole camera inside an actual [...]38 calibre gun barrel, with stunt man Bob Simmons playing the part of Bond. The remake of the sequence for the wide-screen Thunderball featured Connery as Bond. This is accompanied by the opening bars of the [...] "James Bond Theme", composed by Monty Norman, orchestrated by trumpeter and composer John Barry and Burt Rhodes.|$|E
500|$|Ballistic {{evidence}} indicates that the 10-member gang took at least six guns {{with them on the}} attack. An independent panel of inquiry commissioned by the Pat Finucane Centre has established that among the weapons actually used in the killings were two Sterling 9mm submachine guns and a 9mm Luger pistol serial no. U 4. The submachine guns, which had been stolen years earlier from {{a former member of the}} B Specials, were linked to prior and later sectarian killings, whereas the Luger had been used to kill leading IRA member, John Francis Green, the previous January. In a letter to the Independent Commission of Inquiry into the Bombing of Kay's Tavern dated 22 February 2004, the Northern Ireland Office stated that: [...] "The PSNI [...] have confirmed that a 9mm Luger pistol was ballistically traced both to the murder of John Francis Green and to the Miami Showband murders." [...] In May 1976, Robin Jackson's fingerprints were discovered on the metal <b>barrel</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> home-made silencer constructed for a Luger. Both the silencer and pistol– which was later established to have been the same one used in the Miami Showband killings– were found by the security forces at the home of Edward Sinclair. Jackson was charged with possession of the silencer but not convicted, the trial judge having reportedly said: [...] "At the end of the day I find that the accused somehow touched the silencer, but the Crown evidence has left me completely in the dark as to whether he did that wittingly or unwittingly, willingly or unwillingly". The Luger was destroyed by the RUC on 28 August 1978.|$|E
