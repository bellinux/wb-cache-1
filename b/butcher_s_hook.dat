40|$|Rock {{climbing}} {{has become}} increasingly more popular in the USA {{over the past two}} decades. Accordingly, with increased participation comes an increase in climbing-related injuries. Rooks et al noted that three-quarters of elite and recreational climbers will suffer upper extremity injuries, approximately 60 % involving the hand or wrist and 40 % divided evenly between the shoulder and elbow. Most of these injures will be strains, microtrauma, and tendonitis; however, 30 – 50 % represent trauma to the proximal interphalangeal region. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the biomechanical properties of the A 2 and A 4 pulley and compare biomechanical properties among gender and digit. A specially designed materials testing machine, shown in the included figure, measured maximum breaking load, displacement and stiffness of the A 2 and A 4 pulleys of ten cadaveric hands using an <b>S</b> <b>hook</b> to apply a steady force until complete pulley rupture. The A 2 and A 4 biomechanical properties of breaking load, displacement, and stiffness did not significantly differ among the index, middle, ring, and little fingers.

Tendril-less regulates tendril {{formation}} in pea leaves. Plant Cell, 21 (2), 420 - 428. Tendrils are contact-sensitive, filamentous organs that permit climbing plants to tether to their taller neighbors. Tendrilled legume species are grown as field crops, where the tendrils {{contribute to the}} physical support of the crop prior to harvest. The homeotic tendril-less (tl) mutation in garden pea (Pisum sativum), identified almost a century ago, transforms tendrils into leaflets. In this study, we used a systematic marker screen of fast neutron?generated tl deletion mutants to identify Tl as a Class I homeodomain leucine zipper (HDZIP) transcription factor. We confirmed the tendril-less phenotype as loss of function by targeting induced local lesions in genomes (TILLING) in garden pea and by analysis of the tendril-less phenotype of the t mutant in sweet pea (Lathyrus odoratus). The conversion of tendrils into leaflets in both mutants demonstrates that the pea tendril is a modified leaflet, inhibited from completing laminar development by Tl. We provide {{evidence to show that}} lamina inhibition requires Unifoliata/LEAFY-mediated Tl expression in organs emerging in the distal region of the leaf primordium. Phylogenetic analyses show that Tl is an unusual Class I HDZIP protein and that tendrils evolved either once or twice in Papilionoid legumes. We suggest that tendrils arose in the Fabeae clade of Papilionoid legumes through acquisition of the Tl gene. publishersversionPeer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|Copyright © 2001 Academic Press. All rights reserved. A mutant form of {{the common}} beta-subunit of the GM-CSF, interleukin- 3 (IL 3) and IL 5 receptors is {{activated}} by a 37 residue duplicated segment which includes the WSXWS motif and an adjacent, highly conserved, aliphatic/basic element. Haemopoietic expression of this mutant, hbeta(c) FIDelta, in mice leads to myeloproliferative disease. To examine the mechanism of activation of this mutant we targetted the two conserved motifs in each repeat for mutagenesis. Here we show that this mutant exhibits constitutive activity in BaF-B 03 cells {{in the presence of}} mouse or human GM-CSF receptor alpha-subunit (GMRalpha) and this activity is disrupted by mutations of the conserved motifs in the first repeat. In the presence of these mutations the receptor reverts to an alternative conformation which retains responsiveness to human IL 3 in a CTLL cell line co-expressing the human IL 3 receptor alpha-subunit (hIL 3 Ralpha). Remarkably, the activated conformation is maintained in the presence of substitutions, deletions or replacement of the second repeat. This suggests that activation occurs due to insertion of extra sequence after the WSXWS motif and is not dependent on the length or specific sequence of the insertion. Thus hbeta(c) displays an ability to fold into functional receptor conformations given insertion of up to 37 residues in the membrane-proximal region. Constitutive activation most likely results from a specific conformational change which alters a dormant, inactive receptor complex, permitting functional association with GMRalpha and ligand-independent mitogenic signalling.

50|$|Of {{particular}} architectural significance are Blair Pavilion and {{the administration}} building. Blair Pavilion is an extremely {{good example of the}} federation Arts and Crafts style. It has typical features of the style including dark brickwork, with roughcast upper walls. The external aspects of the ventilation system have been skilfully incorporated into the roof design in the form of large fleches. The administration building was designed by A <b>S</b> <b>Hook,</b> a young English architect, who after a brief period of employment with the Queensland Department of Works, had a successful and important architectural career in New South Wales. The building and its circular driveway, is an imposing entrance to the asylum. It is the front piece of the administration and service buildings. The Georgian style of the building was a speciality of the government architects office in Queensland. This building is one of the finest examples of this style in Queensland and one of the earliest. Challinor Centre is significant for its landmark qualities within the Ipswich townscape. Challinor centre occupies one of the highest ridges in Ipswich and is a landmark within Ipswich. While the showgrounds and vegetation conceals the Centre from immediate view, it is readily recognisable from more distant vantage points. From the southern side of Denmark Hill, the Centre is prominent on the southern skyline. Similarly the Challinor buildings, particularly the chimney, dominate the skyline eastwards from Lobb Street. Approaching Ipswich from the south along the Warwick Road, Blair Pavilion is prominent on the horizon. These vistas are given prominence by the openness of the site due to the minimal development of most of site and the open landscape of the golf course. This contributes to the institutional nature of the site and its landmark qualities.|$|R

40|$|Project (M. A., Education (Behavioral Sciences Gender Equity Studies)) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2014. The {{community}} {{discourse of}} education repeatedly contemplates the question: {{why does a}} majority of black children dislike or struggle in school? Educators {{across the country are}} asking that very same question in the classrooms of America. Taking a deep dive through African American history might uncover the answer. During the time of slavery, around 1831, it was against the law for blacks to read and write; that is where many scholars believe the disconnection of education first took root with black students and the ???Achievement Gap??? was born. In a research study by Greenberg, Kalogrides, Shores, and Valentino (2011), review the cause of gaps in student achievement between low-income minority students (mainly black students) and low- to middle-income white students. "Equality of Educational Opportunity" (more widely known as the Coleman Report), commissioned by the U. S. Department of Education in 1966, suggested both in-school factors and home/community factors impact the academic achievement of students and contribute to the gap. Scholars believe the reason for this phenomenon lies in black history in the US and desegregation in the 1960 <b>s</b> (<b>hooks,</b> 2003, p. 34). The purpose of this project was to create an anthology for 9 th grade that addressed the absence of African American literature from the standards curriculum. The study of African American literature indicates that the American ethnic populations were deliberately divided for exploitation and specifically for economic gain. In addition, the teaching methodologies of African American Women Literature in secondary Grade 9 are inequitable and teachers need a different strategy to empower students. African American students feel alienated because their culture is underrepresented in school curriculum. A student learning about his or her culture not only improves individual self-esteem and provides a sense of identity but raises their grades and increases interest in school (hooks, 1999). Thus, proponents of African American Women Literature being included in mainstream curricula believe that increasing its usage in schools will promote cultural identity, improved self-esteem, and correct many of the myths supported by the Eurocentric curriculum.

40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{screen the}} {{anti-cancer}} spike-mosses {{for the presence}} of various bioactivities and to identify the important bioactive chemicals present in Selaginella inaequalifolia (<b>S.</b> inaequalifolia) (<b>Hook.</b> & Grev.) Spring. MethodsPreliminary phytochemical screening was done by following the method of Brindha et al. Antimicrobial study was carried out by disc diffusion method. ResultsResults of preliminary phytochemical screening on five different extracts (petroleum ether, benzene, chloroform, ethanol and distilled water) of the spike-moss S. inaequalifolia show the presence steroids, triterpenes, phenolic group, tannin, sugars and catechin. Alkaloids, amino acids, anthraquinone and reducing sugar did not show any positive result. Among the five different extracts, ethanol and chloroform extracts show the presence of maximum number (4 each) of compounds. The results on antimicrobial studies show that all the three microbes [Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Candida albicans (C. albicans) ] tested are resistant to the ethanol extract and susceptible to petroleum ether extract. The petroleum ether extract shows maximum inhibition with 45 mm of inhibition zone in C. albicans. The inhibition zone in S. aureus and E. coli are 26 mm and 22 mm respectively. ConclusionsThe present study shows S. inaequalifolia having potent antibacterial and anticandidal activities...|$|R
