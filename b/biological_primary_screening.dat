40|$|Abstract: Autophagy {{plays an}} {{important}} role in cancer and it has been suggested that it functions not only as a tumor suppressor pathway to prevent tumor initiation, but also as a pro-survival pathway that helps tumor cells endure metabolic stress and resist death triggered by chemotherapeutic agents, including acquired resistance. We aimed to identify small-molecule autophagy inhibitors using a HTS/HCA approach through a phenotypic, cell image-based assay, in order to screen multiple biological targets simultaneously and to screen compounds in a physiologically relevant environment. LC 3 is a component of the autophagosome, which undergoes a cytoplasmic redistribution from diffuse to punctate dots during autophagy. We employed HeLa cells stably expressing EGFP-LC 3 in a <b>primary</b> phenotypic <b>screen.</b> As a first step, a “Validation Library ” of about 8, 000 pre-selected compounds, about 25 % of which had known biological activity and the others representing a range of chemical structures, was run in duplicate both to assess screening suitability and likely hit rate, and to give a valuable preview of possible active structures or <b>biological</b> targets. The <b>primary</b> <b>screen</b> of about 0. 25 million compounds yielded around 10, 500 positive compounds. These were tested in a suite of further cellular assays de-signed to eliminate unwanted positives, together with the application of chemi- and bioinformatics to pick out compounds with known biological activity. These processes enabled the selection of compounds that were the most promisingly ac-tive and specific. The screening “tree ” identified, amongst others with as yet unidentified targets, chemical series active against autophagy-relevant biological targets ULK or Vsp 34, validating the phenotypic screening methods selected.

40|$|Abstract Background There {{are three}} main {{problems}} associated with the virtual screening of bioassay data. The first is access to freely-available curated data, the second is the number of false positives that occur in the physical <b>primary</b> <b>screening</b> process, and finally the data is highly-imbalanced with a low ratio of Active compounds to Inactive compounds. This paper first discusses these three problems and then a selection of Weka cost-sensitive classifiers (Naive Bayes, SVM, C 4. 5 and Random Forest) are applied to a variety of bioassay datasets. Results Pharmaceutical bioassay data is not readily available to the academic community. The data held at PubChem is not curated and {{there is a lack of}} detailed cross-referencing between <b>Primary</b> and Confirmatory <b>screening</b> assays. With regard to the number of false positives that occur in the <b>primary</b> <b>screening</b> process, the analysis carried out has been shallow due to the lack of cross-referencing mentioned above. In six cases found, the average percentage of false positives from the High-Throughput <b>Primary</b> <b>screen</b> is quite high at 64 %. For the cost-sensitive classification, Weka's implementations of the Support Vector Machine and C 4. 5 decision tree learner have performed relatively well. It was also found, that the setting of the Weka cost matrix is dependent on the base classifier used and not solely on the ratio of class imbalance. Conclusions Understandably, pharmaceutical data is hard to obtain. However, it would be beneficial to both the pharmaceutical industry and to academics for curated <b>primary</b> <b>screening</b> and corresponding confirmatory data to be provided. Two benefits could be gained by employing virtual screening techniques to bioassay data. First, by reducing the search space of compounds to be screened and secondly, by analysing the false positives that occur in the <b>primary</b> <b>screening</b> process, the technology may be improved. The number of false positives arising from <b>primary</b> <b>screening</b> leads to the issue of whether this type of data should be used for virtual screening. Care when using Weka's cost-sensitive classifiers is needed - across the board misclassification costs based on class ratios should not be used when comparing differing classifiers for the same dataset. </p...|$|R

Our primary objective was to build a predictive model based on a few simple variables {{that could be used}} as a guide for identifying average risk adults more suitable for examination with colonoscopy as a <b>primary</b> <b>screening</b> test. METHODS: The prevalence of advanced adenomas was assessed by <b>primary</b> <b>screening</b> colonoscopy in 2210 consecutive adults at least 40 yr old, without known risk factors for CRC. Age, gender, and clinical and biochemical data were compared among people without adenomas, those with non-advanced adenomas, and those with any advanced neoplasm. A combined score to assess the risk of advanced adenomas was built with the variables selected by multiple logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: Neoplastic lesions were found in 617 subjects (27. 9 %), including 259 with at least one neoplasm that was 10 mm or larger, villous, or with moderate-to-severe dysplasia, and 11 with invasive cancers. Advanced lesions were more frequent among men, older people, and those with a higher body mass index (BMI). These three variables were independent predictors of advanced adenomas in multivariate analysis. A score combining age, sex, and BMI was developed as a guide for identifying individuals more suitable for screening colonoscopy.

So far, only a few studies discuss mass spectrometry as a screening technology for fragments. Here, we applied native electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) for screening defined sets of fragments against four different target proteins. Fragments were selected from a <b>primary</b> <b>screen</b> conducted by thermal shift assay (TSA) and represent different binding categories. Our data show that beside specific complex formation, many fragments show extensive multiple binding as well as charge-state shifts. Both of these factors complicate automated data analysis and lower the attractiveness of native MS as a <b>primary</b> <b>screening</b> tool for fragments. A comparison of hits identified by native MS and TSA shows good agreement for two proteins.

A study was undertaken {{to determine its}} sensitivity and specificity as a <b>primary</b> <b>screening</b> tool {{for the detection of}} culture positive tuberculosis.  METHODS—The study was conducted on 2420 clinical specimens (sputum, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, pleural fluid, urine) submitted for <b>primary</b> <b>screening</b> for Mycobacterium tuberculosis to a regional medical microbiology laboratory. Specimens were tested in parallel with smear, ligase chain reaction, and culture.  RESULTS—Thirty nine patients had specimens testing positive by the ligase chain reaction assay. Thirty two patients had newly diagnosed tuberculosis, one had a tuberculosis relapse, three had tuberculosis (on antituberculous therapy when tested), and three had healed tuberculosis. In the newly diagnosed group specimens were smear positive in 21 cases (66 %), ligase chain reaction positive in 30 cases (94 %), and culture positive in 32 cases (100 %). Using a positive culture to diagnose active tuberculosis, the ligase chain reaction assay had a sensitivity of 93. 9 %, a specificity of 99. 8 %, a positive predictive value of 83. 8 %, and a negative predictive value of 99. 9 %.  CONCLUSIONS—This study is the largest clinical trial to date to report the efficacy of the ligase chain reaction as a <b>primary</b> <b>screening</b> tool to detect Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection.

40|$|The modern {{pharmaceutical}} industry has achieved remarkable successes in medicinal chemistry. However, many diseases are incurable {{due to the}} difficulty of finding new drugs. De novo drug discovery contains two steps: the <b>primary</b> <b>screening</b> focuses on selecting protein (target) binding drug (ligand); the secondary screening concentrates on calculating kinetic binding parameters of target-ligand complex. Conventional methods for the <b>primary</b> <b>screening</b> are typically surface-based, which suffer intensely from nonspecific interactions; the existing methods for secondary screening are either affinity-based or require surface immobilization, both cannot accurately calculate kinetic binding parameters. Hence, this research focuses {{on the development of the}} solution-based kinetic platform that facilitates both primary and secondary screenings. We combined kinetic capillary electrophoresis (KCE) with DNA-encoded ligand (DEL) technology to build a solution-based platform for <b>primary</b> <b>screening</b> of ligands. KCE offers high partitioning efficiency but requires the knowledge of electrophoretic mobility of target-ligand complex, and thus, we developed a mathematical model to predict electrophoretic mobility of target-DEL complex. This model was tested by using the targets interacted with 18 artificial DELs that contain various combinations of dsDNA and ssDNA regions, together with 2 DELs manufactured by GlaxoSmithKline. The results confirmed the precision, accuracy, and ruggedness of our model. This model will facilitate the reliable use of KCE-DEL based <b>primary</b> <b>screening.</b> Next, we developed a kinetic size-exclusion chromatography-mass spectrometry (KSEC-MS) as the label-free solution-based platform for calculating kinetic binding parameters of target-ligand interactions in secondary screening. KSEC-MS employs size-exclusion chromatography to separate small molecule ligand from protein target-ligand complex without immobilization and mass spectrometry to detect small molecule without a label. The rate constants of complex formation and dissociation are calculated from the temporal ligand concentration profile. Methods of KSEC-MS have been developed by using 2 proteins with the corresponding drugs. The resulted kinetic and affinity binding parameters were validated, which confirmed the precision and accuracy of KSEC-MS. We foresee that the KSEC-MS will become a universal approach for the kinetic analysis of target-ligand interactions in secondary screening...|$|R
