5|$|Numerous {{other birds}} can be seen, {{especially}} during the spring and autumn migration. Sand martins (Riparia riparia) arrive early and can usually be seen hawking over the water for insects in {{the second or third}} week of March.

Waders, such as lapwings (Vanellus vanellus), dunlin (Calidris alpina) and common snipe (Gallinago gallinago), are attracted to the muddy shores if the water level drops in autumn. By midwinter up to 55,000 gulls, mostly <b>black-headed</b> <b>gull</b> (Chroicocephalus ridibundus) and common gull (Larus canus), may be roosting.

Proportionately fewer second-year and first-year birds returned than adults. These percentages are considerably lower than the estimated annual survival rate for <b>Black-headed</b> <b>Gulls,</b> showing {{that some of the}} birds probably spent subsequent winters outside the study area. Some of the birds which did not return to the study area were recovered or seen elsewhere, mainly in eastern parts of Britain: few moved to the west coast.

[...] et al. [Introduction]: <b>Black-headed</b> <b>gulls</b> (Chroicocephalus ridibundus) are a {{suitable}} model {{to unravel the}} epidemiology of low pathogenic avian influenza virus (LPAIV) infection in wild waterbirds because they are a common colony-breeding species in which LPAIV infection is limited mainly to the H 13 and H 16 subtypes. However, the sites of virus replication and associated lesions are poorly understood. [Material and methods]: We performed virological and pathological analyses on tissues of <b>black-headed</b> <b>gulls</b> naturally infected with LPAIV. [Results]: We found that 24 of 111 <b>black-headed</b> <b>gulls</b> collected from breeding colonies were infected with LPAIV (10 X H 16 N 3, 1 X H 13 N 8, 13 X undetermined), based on virus and viral genome detection in pharyngeal and cloacal swabs. Of these 24 gulls, 15 expressed virus antigen in their tissues. Virus antigen expression was limited to epithelial cells of intestine and cloacal bursa. No histological lesions were detected in association with virus antigen expression. [Discussion & Conclusion]: Our findings show that LPAIV in <b>black-headed</b> <b>gulls</b> is mainly a superficial intestinal tract infection in absence of detectable lesions. These findings imply that LPAIV in <b>black-headed</b> <b>gulls</b> has adapted to fecal-oral transmission with minimal pathogenicity to its host. Peer Reviewe...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis study {{analyzes}} data in {{the first}} half of 1990 (May, 1989 - April, 1993) and mid- 2000 (May, 2002 - April, 2006) to understand long-term status of <b>black-headed</b> <b>gulls</b> (Larus ridibundus) in the estuary of the Nakdong River under rapid changes. During the period (May, 1989 - April, 1993 and May, 2002 - April, 2003 for a total of 8 years), a total of 201, 519 individuals of Laridae were discovered at the estuary and the number of the <b>black-headed</b> <b>gulls</b> (Larus ridibundus) was 32, 538 (16. 15 %). Monthly average of the <b>black-headed</b> <b>gulls</b> showed that there were just a small number of individuals arrived in July and August, but the number increased from September, reached the highest in April for the first term (1989 - 1993). The second term showed that some individuals were discovered in summer (June - August), then the number increased from October and reached the peak in April. Monthly average in the latter period marked 5. 7 times higher than that of the former. In the aspect of individuals, there is a significant difference between the two period (P< 0. 05) and it is discovered that the number of individuals in 2000 s (Mean= 6923. 50) was higher than that of 1990 s (Mean= 1211. 00). Comparing individuals of gulls, herring gulls (Larus argentatus) and <b>black-headed</b> <b>gulls</b> for 8 years, it was found out that the herring gulls (Larus argentatus) showed the largest number (average= 5313. 13), followed by the <b>black-headed</b> <b>gulls</b> (average= 4067. 25) and gulls (average= 1207. 63). The fluctuation on individuals of <b>black-headed</b> <b>gulls</b> in the mid- 2000 s (May, 2005 - April, 2006) recorded the average number of 472. 75, then 113. 50 in DMD, 244. 00 in JJ and SJD, 635. 25 in SJ and DY, 727. 50 in LUD and 643. 50 in USD, showing significant differences among regions (P< 0. 05) ...|$|R
25|$|Besides {{experimental}} research, {{the comparative}} method {{can also be}} employed to investigate hypotheses such as those given by Curio above. For example, closely related species such as the kittiwake do not show mobbing behavior. The kittiwake's cliff nests are almost completely inaccessible to possible predators due to gusty winds and sheer cliffs, meaning its young are not at risk to predation like the <b>black-headed</b> <b>gull.</b> This {{is an example of}} an evolutionary pattern known as divergent evolution.|$|E
25|$|Mobbing {{can also}} be used to obtain food, by driving larger birds and mammals away from a food source, or by harassing a bird with food. One bird might {{distract}} while others quickly steal food. Scavenging birds such as gulls frequently use this technique to steal food from humans nearby. A flock of birds might drive a powerful animal away from food. Costs of mobbing behavior include the risk of engaging with predators, as well as energy expended in the process. The <b>black-headed</b> <b>gull</b> is a species which aggressively engages intruding predators, such as carrion crows. Classic experiments on this species by Hans Kruuk involved placing hen eggs at intervals from a nesting colony, and recording the percentage of successful predation events as well as the probability of the crow being subjected to mobbing. The results showed decreasing mobbing with increased distance from the nest, which was correlated with increased predation success. Mobbing may function by reducing the predator's ability to locate nests (as a distraction) since predators cannot focus on locating eggs while they are under attack.|$|E

40|$|During {{a period}} of 3 years, 1998 – 2000, 1047 faecal swabs from <b>Black-headed</b> <b>gulls</b> were sampled at one {{location}} in Southern Sweden.

Twenty-five per cent of the Salmonella-infected gulls were later recaptured and re-sampled. We found that Salmonella infection in <b>Black-headed</b> <b>gulls</b> was of short duration, and that infection in this bird species was predominantly expressed as carriage without disease manifestations. All S. Typhimurium isolates were subjected to antibiotic resistance profiling and molecular characterization by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and IS 200 polymerase chain reaction. The S. Typhimurium gull isolates were compared to human and domestic animal isolates of the same serotype and phage type. We found genetic relatedness of S.

2500|$|The reserve {{has been}} {{declared}} a Ramsar site and a Special Protection Area (SPA). In summer the salt marsh supports large numbers of breeding birds including <b>black-headed</b> <b>gull,</b> European herring gull, lesser black-backed gull, common tern and common redshank. Skylark, meadow pipit and linnet nest in significant numbers on the grazing marsh. [...] Management of the site involves grazing the salt marsh with cattle to maintain the short sward on which wintering wildfowl (especially Eurasian wigeon and the pink-footed goose) depend. The main area of salt marsh is grazed by approximately 800 cattle from May to October, forming {{one of the largest}} single herds of cattle in the UK. Wildfowling takes place on much of the reserve and improved management has contributed to {{the increase in the number}} of birds visiting the site.

2500|$|Every year {{approximately}} 15,000 greater flamingos {{are reported}} to visit the lake along with pelicans, kingfishers, herons, painted storks, spoonbills and ducks. The highest concentrations of flamingo {{are found in the}} periphery of the lagoon where the water level is below. The concentrations of flamingos are also associated with high algal, fish and benthic diversity. Other water birds in the area include spot-billed pelican, seven species of herons and egrets, painted stork, greater flamingos, ducks, [...] 20 species of shorebirds, gulls, terns, little grebe, Indian cormorant, little cormorant, Asian openbill stork, black-headed ibis, Eurasian spoonbill, lesser whistling teal, spotbill duck, great thick-knee and stone curlew.

Birds of prey which appear in winter are the: white-bellied sea eagle, harriers and peregrine falcons. The largest concentrations of flamingos occur in the Andhra Pradesh part of the sanctuary, around the islands of Vendadu and Irukkam.|$|E
40|$|<b>Black-headed</b> <b>gulls</b> (Chroicocephalus ridibundus) are a {{suitable}} host species {{to study the}} epidemiology of low-pathogenic avian influenza virus (LPAIV) infection in wild waterbirds because they are a common colony-breeding species in which LPAIV infection is detected frequently, limited mainly to the H 13 and H 16 subtypes. However, the sites of virus replication and associated lesions are poorly understood. We therefore performed virological and pathological analyses on tissues of <b>black-headed</b> <b>gulls</b> naturally infected with LPAIV. We found that 24 of 111 <b>black-headed</b> <b>gulls</b> collected from breeding colonies were infected with LPAIV (10 birds with H 16 N 3, one bird with H 13 N 8, 13 birds undetermined), based on virus and viral genome detection in pharyngeal and cloacal swabs. Of these 24 gulls, 15 expressed virus antigen in their tissues. Virus antigen expression was limited to epithelial cells of intestine and cloacal bursa. No histological lesions were detected in association with virus antigen expression. Our findings show that LPAIV replication in the intestinal tract of <b>black-headed</b> <b>gulls</b> is mainly a superficial infection in absence of detectable lesions, as determined recently for natural LPAIV infection in free-living mallards (Anas platyrhynchos). These findings imply that LPAIV in <b>black-headed</b> <b>gulls</b> has adapted to minimal pathogenicity to its host and that potentially the primary transmission route is faecal-oral. J. H.

This may include more than 50 species of shorebird (from quite small sandpipers to the largest species of gull), more than 30 species of waterfowl, at least 10 species each of herons, 8 species of rails and any grebes or cormorants that are available. [...] The most regularly reported water bird prey in Europe were, roughly in this order, the [...] common moorhens (Gallinula chloropus), the [...] Eurasian coot (Fulica atra), [...] mallards (Anas platyrhynchos), [...] <b>black-headed</b> <b>gull</b> (Chroicocephalus ridibundus), and the [...] Eurasian teal (Anas crecca). The diet of a handful of eagle-owl pairs in the Riau Islands Province of France were found to be dominated by water birds, especially the [...] yellow-legged gull (Larus michahellis), the colonial abundance of which allowed the eagle-owls to atypically occupy these small islands. The diet of eagle-owls in Norway was dominated in coastal areas by water birds, overall for the nation 53% of the food was made of birds, the species most commonly identified as caught being the [...] mew gull (Larus canus), [...] Atlantic puffin (Fratercula arctica) and [...] common eider (Somateria mollissima). Despite access to large seabird breeding colonies, almost all large bird species hunted in Norway, including large forest grouse in more inland areas, were apparently fully-grown adults and most water birds were caught while resting on open coastal waters. Eagle-owls in northwestern Poland, an area heavily dotted with lakes, relied on birds for about 64% of the diet, more than half of which were water birds. The main prey species there was the Eurasian coot, at nearly 15% of the prey numbers. [...] In Primorsky Krai in Russia, 53.2% of the food for the eagle-owls were made up of birds, predominantly water birds with the primary prey species being the [...] crested auklet (Aethia cristatella [...] ) (26.9%). In the Russian Far East, similarly, birds occupy up to 57.6% of the diet, a lion’s share of which are water birds. In this study, the grey red-backed vole and reed vole (Microtus fortis) were the most numerous identified individual species but in some years the extremely large Japanese cormorant (Phalacrocorax capillatus), at , were more numerous as prey than either vole. Water birds were found to be even more important in the diet in Korea, as in wetland habitat, with birds in general comprising 68.9% by number and 85.3% by biomass there, but in adjacent upland areas birds were slightly secondary to mammals, which made up 38.7% by number and 64.7% by biomass, led by the brown rat. [...] In Korea, the mallard and the similar spot-billed duck (Anas poecilorhyncha) made up 38.1% of the biomass. Other recorded bird species in the Eurasian eagle-owl’s diet includes most type of birds found in their range, including bustards, sandgrouse, parrots, cuckoos, swifts, the [...] hoopoe (Upupa epops), the [...] European bee-eater (Merops apiaster), the [...] common kingfisher (Alcedo atthis), the [...] European roller (Coracias garrulus), at least seven species of woodpecker (from the smallest to the largest European species) and more than 80 species of passerine. Among passerines, the only family reported widely as prey besides corvids are thrushes. In the Italian Alps, Turdus species were the fourth most frequently recorded type of prey. In particular, the abundant [...] Eurasian blackbird (Turdus merula) [...] is widely reported to be taken by eagle-owls. As thrushes are relatively small, at [...] among the species known to be predated, pairs in the Italian Alps who depended more so on thrushes usually showed lower productivity during nesting attempts.|$|E
