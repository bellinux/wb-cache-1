40|$|The {{future of}} {{cellular}} radio ICs {{lies in the}} integration of an ever-increasing number of <b>bands</b> <b>and</b> channel bandwidths. This paper presents a transceiver together with the associated discrete front-end components. The transceiver supports 4 EDGE <b>bands</b> <b>and</b> 9 WCDMA <b>bands</b> (l-VI <b>and</b> Vlll-X), while the radio can be configured to simultaneously support the 4 EDGE <b>bands</b> <b>and</b> up to 5 WCDMA bands: 3 high <b>bands</b> (HB) <b>and</b> 2 low <b>bands</b> (LB). The RX is a SAW-less homodyne composed of a main RX and a diversity RX. To reduce package complexity with so many bands, we chose to minimize the number of ports by using single-ended RF interfaces for both RX and TX. This saves seve ral package pins, but requires careful attention to grounding. The main RX has 8 LNA ports and the diversity RX has 5, with some LNAs supporting multiple bands. On the TX side, 2 ports are used for all EDGE <b>bands</b> <b>and</b> 4 for the WCDMA bands...|$|R
