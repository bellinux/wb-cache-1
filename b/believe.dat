Over £84 million of sales were made {{on the first day}} of release alone, the highest-grossing opening sale of an entertainment product at the time. <b>Believe</b> received dozens of awards from the advertising community, including eight Clio Awards, Best in Show at the ANDY Awards, and two Grand Prix (for Film and Integrated campaigns) at the Cannes Lions International Advertising Festival, the most prestigious awards ceremony in the advertising industry. According to the Gunn Report, <b>Believe</b> was the second-most-awarded integrated advertising campaign of 2008, behind Earth Hour for the World Wide Fund for Nature.|$|E

5|$|One poll {{reported}} in the journal Nature showed that among American scientists (across various disciplines), about 40 percent <b>believe</b> in both evolution and an active deity (theistic evolution).

While about 55% of scientists surveyed were atheists, agnostics, or nonreligious theists, atheism is far from universal among scientists who support evolution, or among the general public that supports evolution. Very similar results were reported from a 1997 Gallup Poll of the American public and scientists.|$|E

5|$|We <b>believe</b> {{that it is}} the {{inalienable}} right of the Indian people, as of any other people, to have freedom and to enjoy the fruits of their toil and have the necessities of life, so that they may have full opportunities of growth.

The British government in India has not only deprived the Indian people of their freedom but has based itself on the exploitation of the masses, and has ruined India economically, politically, culturally and spiritually. We <b>believe</b> therefore, that India must sever the British connection and attain Purna Swaraji or complete sovereignty and self-rule.|$|E
