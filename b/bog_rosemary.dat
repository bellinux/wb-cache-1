50|$|Around {{the shores}} the {{formation}} of transitional bogs and raised bogs is taking place. It places there is a quagmire vegetation. Here, peat moss, cottongrasses, bog-bean, cranberries and <b>bog</b> <b>rosemary</b> occur.|$|E
25|$|In {{the zones}} most subject to inundations, {{conifers}} are more rare, {{since they do}} not like in general the wetter zones. In these forests, one can find broadleaf trees such as the aspen, very common in the Lower Dalälven, but rare {{in the rest of the}} country. These forests also have English oaks and small-leaved lindens and the wetter forests are mostly made up of alders, birch trees and willows. The richness of these forests and in particular their undergrowth depends above all on the nature of the soil. The poorer soils grow blueberries, <b>bog</b> bilberries, wild <b>rosemary</b> and cloudberry, whereas the richer soils are home in particular to Lily of the valley, woodland strawberries, purple small-reed and yellow loosestrife.|$|R
50|$|Part is {{maintained}} as wet meadow by annual mowing or grazing and devil's-bit scabious, knapweed, meadowsweet and wild angelica are abundant. Small remnants of raised mire vegetation including sphagnum moss, <b>bog</b> <b>rosemary</b> and royal fern.|$|E
50|$|Cranberry bogs harbor species {{typical of}} {{ecoregions}} found to the north. These species include cranberry and blueberry (Vaccinium spp.), <b>bog</b> <b>rosemary</b> (Andromeda glaucophylla), and buckbean (Menyanthes trifoliata). These bogs are relicts that have survived {{since the last}} glacial period.|$|E

50|$|The {{cuckoo flower}} (Cardamine pratensis), a {{herbaceous}} perennial, {{can be found}} throughout Wales. <b>Bog</b> <b>rosemary</b> (Andromeda polifolia), a small flowering shrub, {{can be found in}} central Wales. Within the British Isles, the Snowdon lily (Gagea serotina) is found only on the slopes of Snowdon.|$|E
50|$|Pinhook Bog and Cowles Bog {{are both}} acidic and {{calcareous}} with poor drainage. There is a mats of Sphagnum over {{parts of the}} bogs. Typical plants include pitcher plants, sundew, cotton grass, and poison sumac. Shrubby areas, called heaths include leatherleaf, blueberries, <b>bog</b> <b>rosemary,</b> and cranberries. The perimeter is dominated by tamarack.|$|E
50|$|In {{northern}} Greenland, {{the ground}} {{is covered with a}} carpet of mosses and low-lying shrubs such as dwarf willows and crowberries. Common flowering plants in the north include <b>bog</b> <b>rosemary,</b> yellow poppy, Pedicularis, and Pyrola. Plant life in southern Greenland is more abundant, and certain plants, such as the dwarf birch and willow, may grow several feet high.|$|E
50|$|The {{wet surface}} of bog {{supports}} growth of bog mosses (Sphagnum spp.). Rare plants include the <b>bog</b> <b>rosemary</b> (Andromeda polifolia), royal fern (Osmunda regalis), and cranberry (Vaccinium oxycoccus). The petty whin (Genista anglica) grows on the drier western margin and purple moor-grass (Molinia caerulea) dominates the drier {{edges of the}} site. The rare weevil (Bagous frit) has been recorded at the site in the past.|$|E
50|$|Wildlife in {{the nature}} reserve {{includes}} kingfisher, mute swans, watervoles, damselfly and dragonfly species such as the white-faced darter, various species of duck, and even the rare bird of prey the hobby. Plants include cotton sedge, bog moss (Sphagnum), great hairy willowherb, bog myrtle, water figwort, flag iris, cross-leaved heath, <b>bog</b> <b>rosemary,</b> cranberry and sundew; common alder trees, alder buckthorn, grey sallow and crack willow predominate.|$|E
50|$|The Mer Bleue Conservation Area is a 33.43 km2 {{protected}} area east of Ottawa in Eastern Ontario, Canada. Its main feature is a sphagnum bog that {{is situated in}} an ancient channel of the Ottawa River and is a remarkable boreal-like ecosystem normally not found this far south. Stunted black spruce, tamarack, <b>bog</b> <b>rosemary,</b> blueberry, and cottongrass {{are some of the}} unusual species that have adapted to the acidic waters of the bog.|$|E
5000|$|Mer Bleue Conservation Area - 33 km² {{sphagnum}} peat bog. There are some 20 km of walking trails, including a 1.2 km boardwalk, through a remarkable boreal-like ecosystem normally not found this far south. Stunted black spruce, tamarack, together with <b>bog</b> <b>rosemary,</b> blueberry, and cottongrass, {{are some of}} the unusual species that have adapted to the acidic waters of the bog. The Mer Bleue bog (French for Blue Sea) got its name from the autumn morning fogs that make it appear as a blue sea.|$|E
50|$|Black Tern Bog State Natural Area is a Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources-designated State Natural Area {{featuring}} 20 acres (8 ha) of quaking sphagnum bog surrounding {{two small}} seepage lakes {{situated in a}} pitted outwash plain. The bog is rich in plant species, such as sundews, pitcher plant, bogbean, and <b>bog</b> <b>rosemary,</b> as well as three species of bog orchids: swamp pink, grass pink, and rose pogonia. The state-endangered bog rush (Juncus stygius) also grows here. Birds known to nest here include black tern, American bittern, killdeer, and mallards.|$|E
50|$|The {{preserve}} {{includes the}} transition zone from boreal forest to tundra near {{the southern edge}} of the preserve. The Noatak Basin is a transition zone for plants and animals between Arctic and subarctic environments. The lower portion of the Noatak valley has areas of boreal forest, but most vegetation is low-growing tundra species. Alpine tundra occurs at high elevation, and moist tundra, the most common condition, supports cottongrass, willows, Labrador tea, mountain alder, dwarf birch and other tundra species at lower elevations. Boggy areas support cranberry, <b>bog</b> <b>rosemary</b> and salmonberry.|$|E
5000|$|The motto {{translates}} as [...] "friendship through partnership." [...] The fretted design represents Mountmellick Work, an embroidery craft {{unique to the}} town. The bend wavy represents the Owenass river, which embraces much of the town. The crosses reflect {{the foundation of the}} town by the Society of Friends or Quakers. These heraldic elements are crosses moline, and derive from the mill-rind, the iron centre of a millstone. They reflect an important Mountmellick industry. The sprigs of andromeda portifolia, or <b>bog</b> <b>rosemary,</b> remind us of the name place, Mointech Milic. Mointeach means [...] "mooreland," [...] reclaimed bogland, and Milic means wetland.|$|E
50|$|On the unenclosed moorland, {{there are}} {{extensive}} areas of blanket bog on deep peat soils. Although much modified by grazing, burning and drainage, and in places dominated by purple moor-grass, characteristic {{species such as}} cotton-grass, heather, cross-leaved heath, cranberry and many species of sphagnum moss are well represented along with restricted plants such as <b>bog</b> <b>rosemary.</b> Elsewhere on the moorland there are areas of upland heath, acid grassland and upland flushes. Moorland birds include peregrine falcon, merlin, dunlin, wheatear, short-eared owl and golden plover. The moorlands of the West Pennine Moors have largely escaped the extensive planting of conifers suffered in some {{other parts of the}} northern uplands.|$|E
50|$|Pinhook Bog is {{a typical}} bog and used in the last study of mammals. Two areas were study; one was {{atypical}} for a bog and the other more typical. In the atypical plot, the dominant plant in the canopy was willow. The shrub layer included buttonbush, winterberry, poison ivy, wild rose. The dominant grasses were blue joint grass and smartweed --- water heartsease (Polygonurn coccineum). The typical plot had a canopy of tamarack and some pines and willows. In the shrub layer were <b>bog</b> <b>rosemary,</b> leatherleaf, blueberry, and huckleberry. The lowest layer, the herb layer was dominated by contained sphagnum, sedges, and pitcher plant.|$|E
50|$|Vegetation {{within the}} {{recreation}} area is dominated on drier sites by white spruce and paper birch, with some aspen interspersed. Large {{parts of the}} area have been burned by fires in the past 100 years, which have resulted in thick stands of birch, which precede the older forests of white spruce. Wildflowers abound, from the earliest violets and bluebells, through the last flower {{on the tip of}} the tall fireweed. Water-loving plants, such as <b>bog</b> <b>rosemary</b> and wild iris, are found in wet areas throughout the park. Water lilies decorate many of the lake surfaces. By early July wild berries begin to ripen and highbush and lowbush cranberries, and blueberries frequently provide a bountiful harvest. Varieties of raspberry, crowberry and other berries can also be found.|$|E
5000|$|One of {{the plant}} {{features}} of this bog are the carnivorous plants. These plants counteract the lack of nutrients in the soil by entrapping and consuming small insects, such as the round-leafed sundew, pitcher plants, and bladderworts. This bog is predominantly {{taken over by the}} [...] "flowering plants" [...] heath shrubs, including Labrador tea, <b>bog</b> <b>rosemary,</b> western bog laurel, bog blueberry and bog cranberry. As a result of the drainage impact and the drying of the bog, the Lulu Island Bog is also dominated by a few invasive species, including the European birch, highbush blueberry, American cranberry, and Scotch heather. The Shore Pine tree is a tree characteristic of the bog-forest park, having the ability to tolerate the poor soils and distinguished by its [...] "stunted or spindly appearance".|$|E
50|$|Bogs are wetland areas, {{characterized}} by acid hydric soils composed of peat. Bogs can occur at any elevation in this ecoregion. They are often sphagnum heath areas dominated by shrubs {{in the family}} Ericaceae including: leather leaf (Chamaedaphne calyculata), <b>bog</b> <b>rosemary</b> (Andromeda polifolia), Labrador tea (Ledum groenlandicum), bog laurel (Kalmia polifolia), and American cranberry bushes (Vaccinium macrocarpon). Throughout New England these areas are often artificially made for cranberry monocultures by commercial farms. Common components of the herb layer in bogs includes the carnivorous plants: round-leaved sundew (Drosera rotundifolia), and pitcher plant (Sarracenia purpurea). Other common herbs of the poor soils of bogs include false mayflower (Maianthemum trifolium), and some orchids, particularly, bog candles (Platanthera dilatata). The most common trees that invade bogs as they fill in are black spruce (Picea mariana), northern white cedar (Thuja occidentalis), larch (Larix laricina) and black ash (Fraxinus nigra).|$|E
50|$|Many of {{the plants}} found in the Glades {{resemble}} those in the northern region of North America. They are descendants of seeds that took root over ten thousand years ago before the last glacial retreat. Among these are two unusual species of carnivorous plants that thrive in the area — the purple pitcher plant and native sundew. They evolved carnivorous habits because of the scarce root food in the spongy soil. Two very rare boreal plants — <b>bog</b> <b>rosemary</b> and buckbean — also live in the 59 acre Big Glade. Much of the area provides a home for many species of mosses. These include a cover of sphagnum moss, bird-wheat moss, bog moss and reindeer lichen. Hummocks of these plants reach a height of 3 ft. Over top of these grow prostrate cranberry vines that bloom nice pink flowers {{in the summer and}} a bunch of fruits in late September.|$|E
50|$|Vaccinium oxycoccos is a {{widespread}} and common species. It is an indicator of moist to wet soils which are low in nitrogen and have a high water table. It is an indicator of coniferous swamps. It grows in bogs and fens in moist forest habitat. It grows on peat which may be saturated most of the time. The soil in bogs is acidic and low in nutrients. The plant's mycorrhizae help it obtain nutrients in this situation. Fens have somewhat less acidic soil, which is also higher in nutrients. The plant can often be found growing on hummocks of Sphagnum mosses. In North America, other species found in this forest understory habitat include leatherleaf (Chamaedaphne calyculata), <b>bog</b> <b>rosemary</b> (Andromeda glaucophylla), bog laurel (Kalmia polifolia), pitcher plant (Sarracenia purpurea), Labrador tea (Rhododendron groenlandicum), cloudberry (Rubus chamaemorus), rhodora (Rhododendron canadense), glossy buckthorn (Rhamnus frangula), sundew (Drosera spp.), cottonsedge (Eriophorum virginatum and E. angustifolium), and species of sedge and lichen. The plant easily colonizes bog habitat that has recently burned. It survives fire with its underground rhizomes.|$|E
5000|$|The Glades' shrub layer, {{unlike the}} tree layer, is {{relatively}} species-rich. This {{is a consequence}} of the widespread presence of low- to medium-height woody plants throughout shrub swamps, forest habitats, and open glades. In the fringes of open glades and along streams, the dominant species is usually speckled alder. Also common are willow, pipestem, glade St. Johns-wort, great rhododendron, hobblebush, smooth arrowwood, wild raisin, ninebark, alternate-leaved dogwood, bunchberry, winterberry holly, mountain holly, swamp rose, the Appalachian endemic longstalked holly and many more. Most of these shrubs have markedly northern distributions, and <b>bog</b> <b>rosemary</b> and oblongfruited serviceberry are at their southernmost limits of distribution. The Canada yew is an uncommon evergreen shrub that was historically reported as abundant in the area. [...] Nearby Yew Creek is presumably named for this species, as may be the broader Yew Mountains region in which the Glades are located. Browsing deer have reduced the number of Canada yew {{to such an extent that}} it is found only in scattered locations throughout its Central Appalachian range, including here.|$|E
50|$|This low-lying area is {{dominated}} by Bloak, Lissens, Sidehead, Kennox, Auchentiber, Over Auchentiber, Auchentiber South, Auchentiber West, Dykeneuk, Dykeneuk South, South Auchenmade and Cockinhead mosses. These are more correctly called 'raised bogs' or 'mires' and are a very rare habitat in lowland Scotland; around 90% having been drained or otherwise degraded beyond any possible restoration. Auchentiber Moss is partly wooded with mainly birch trees {{and the remains of}} pheasant rearing cages are noticeable. Hummocks or 'heads' of moss are an unusual feature of the wooded part of this moss. Moorgrips or ditches are frequent on the moss and the walker had better beware. Cockinhead is unusually well preserved and is a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI), protected by the Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) organisation. Burns from some of these (Auchentiber, Sidehead and Brummel) run through the hamlet on their way to join the Lugton Water.Typical plants of these mosses are cottongrasses, ling heather, bell heather, cranberry, blaeberry, <b>bog</b> <b>rosemary,</b> sundews, deer grass, crowberry, etc. Mr. Kerr, the Montgreenan Estate forester in 1915 described to the Kilmarnock Glenfield Ramblers how afforestation was being tried on Auchentiber Moss by his employer, Sir James Bell. During WW1 many woods were cut to provide timber for the war effort and plantings took place to provide for future needs.|$|E
