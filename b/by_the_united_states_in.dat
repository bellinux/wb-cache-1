5|$|Until the 1970s, Australia's {{military}} strategy centred {{on the concept}} of Forward Defence, in which the role of Australian military and naval forces were to co-operate with Allied forces to counter threats in Australia's region. Following the adoption of the Guam Doctrine <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>in</b> 1969, and the British withdrawal 'east of Suez' in the early 1970s, Australia developed a defence policy emphasising self-reliance and the defence of the Australian continent.

5|$|Butler {{participated in}} a series of occupations, police actions, and {{interventions}} <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>in</b> Central America and the Caribbean, commonly called the Banana Wars because their goal was to protect American commercial interests in the region, particularly those of the United Fruit Company. This company had significant financial stakes in the production of bananas, tobacco, sugar cane, and other products throughout the Caribbean, Central America and the northern portions of South America. The U.S. was also trying to advance its own political interests by maintaining its influence in the region and especially its control of the Panama Canal. These interventions started with the Spanish–American War in 1898 and ended with the withdrawal of troops from Haiti and President Franklin D. Roosevelt's Good Neighbor Policy in 1934. After his retirement, Butler became an outspoken critic of the business interests in the Caribbean, criticizing the ways in which U.S. businesses and Wall Street bankers imposed their agenda on United States foreign policy during this period.|$|E
5|$|Following the Act of 1819, in 1820 the Court {{began to}} {{distinguish}} Palmer. In United States v.

Furlong (1820), sometimes referred to as United States v. Pirates, authored by Justice Johnson (a dissenter in Palmer), the Court distinguished Palmer again, primarily on the ground that the pirate vessel had no nationality (it was an American ship prior to being hijacked). United States v. Holmes (1820) distinguished Palmer on the same ground, further holding that the burden was on the defendant to prove that his vessel flew a lawful flag.|$|E

5|$|In 1921, Mitchell first {{demonstrated}} {{to the world}} that battleships and other gun dependent vessels could be sunk by aircraft loaded with heavy bombs. In one of his most famous demonstrations, Mitchell convinced the Navy to allow bomb loaded aircraft to attack the German dreadnought , a battleship taken as a prize of war <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>in</b> 1918. Although the Navy had placed strict rules on the bombing exercise, Mitchell and his men violated the rules and attacked the battleship head on, which caused the vessel to sink in a mere 22 minutes. Although downplayed at the time this would have a dramatic effect on U.S. policy, leading to increased research and development for aircraft.|$|E
5|$|In 1945, the Pacific War {{between the}} Empire of Japan and the Allies entered its fourth year. The Japanese fought fiercely, {{ensuring}} that the Allied victory would come at an enormous cost. The 1.25million battle casualties that were incurred <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>in</b> World War II included both military personnel killed in action and wounded in action. Nearly one million of the casualties occurred {{during the last year}} of the war, from June 1944 to June 1945. In December 1944, American battle casualties hit an all-time monthly high of 88,000 {{as a result of the}} German Ardennes Offensive. In the Pacific, the Allies returned to the Philippines, recaptured Burma, and invaded Borneo. Offensives were undertaken to reduce the Japanese forces remaining in Bougainville, New Guinea and the Philippines. In April 1945, American forces landed on Okinawa, where heavy fighting continued until June. Along the way, the ratio of Japanese to American casualties dropped from 5:1 in the Philippines to 2:1 on Okinawa.|$|E

Smith and Strong subsequently negotiated for the Allies with Castellano in Sicily over the terms over Italian surrender. On 3 September 1943, Smith and Castellano signed the agreed text on behalf of Eisenhower and Pietro Badoglio respectively at Cassibile, Sicily.

5|$|The same {{treatment}} {{was given to}} Ndrilo and Koruniat on 1April but the 1stSquadron, 12thCavalry found them unoccupied. This was notable for being the only amphibious operation of the war carried out <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>in</b> dugout canoes. The final landing was on Rambutyo on 3 April by the 2ndSquadron, 12thCavalry. This time, six LCMs and six LCVPs were used instead of the LVTs. As a result, the first waves grounded on a reef and troopers had to wade ashore through the surf. Fortunately for them, there was no opposition. The Japanese, hiding in the interior, were eventually located by ANGAU and 30Japanese were killed and five captured. Patrols continued hunting for Japanese throughout the islands. Increasingly, the cavalry followed up sightings reported by the natives. On LosNegros, the 302ndCavalry Reconnaissance Troop killed 48and captured 15Japanese during May. On Manus, some 586Japanese dead were counted and 47prisoners taken. General Krueger officially declared the campaign over on 18May.|$|E
