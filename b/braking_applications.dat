40|$|In the past, wear at {{the disc}} and pads {{interface}} of disc brakes {{has rarely been}} accounted for in a 3 -dimensional finite element (FE) model for studying brake squeal. Thus, its effect on disc brake squeal is only possible to investigate through experimental methods. In the present paper, wear over time at the pads interface is simulated using a modified wear rate formula. Confirmation of the proposed wear formula is made against experimental results. The surface topographies of two brand new pairs of brake pads are measured. The contact tests using pressure-indicating films are carried out in order to capture static pressure distributions. The same brake pads are tested under several <b>braking</b> <b>applications.</b> For each braking application, the static contact pressure distribution is measured. The results are used to compare with the simulated results predicted by the FE model. To do so, the detailed 3 - dimensional finite element model of a real disc brake is developed and validated through appropriate analyses. The paper also investigates squeal generation in the above <b>braking</b> <b>applications</b> using complex eigenvalue analysis that is available in a commercial software package. The predicted results are then compared to the squeal events observed in the experiments...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Traditionally, {{automotive}} {{brake rotors}} {{are made with}} cast iron. Besides having economical advantage, cast iron rotor provides many disadvantages due to its weight, such as reduction in fuel efficiency, increase in green house gas emission, and increase in noise, vibration and hardness. With the development of commercial aluminum composites, composite brake rotors are now manufactured. However, the present commercial composite materials are not specifically made for <b>brake</b> <b>application</b> and there are drawbacks. A major drawback is their poor elevated temperature property. In this paper, the unique properties offered by an aluminum composite for <b>brake</b> <b>application</b> is addressed, and an approach to compensate its properties for <b>brake</b> <b>application</b> is highlighted...|$|R

A modular two-dimensional wind tunnel model was constructed and evaluated during extensive wind tunnel testing.

To further interpret their potential performance, the controls were evaluated numerically using a generic wind turbine geometry and a performance analysis computer program.

40|$|Modem {{aircraft}} use Carbon-Carbon Composite (CCC) {{materials for}} the heat-pack elements of the brake (Tarter, 1991). The elevated wear-rate mechanism of CCC brakes at low operating temperatures (< 100 °C) is well understood (Abbott, 1995). Oxidation of these friction materials increases between temperatures of 400 °C - 600 °C (Cullinan et al, 1989), which also increases the level of heat-pack wear. The current method for monitoring the life of CCC brakes is by visual inspection of the wear pin indicator. The limitation of this method {{is that there is}} no means of determining the causes of elevated heat-pack wear. This executive summary presents two innovative solutions to this wear-rate problem.

In the macroscopic model, the law of conservation of energy or First Law of Thermodynamics is taken into account.

40|$|Vehicle {{braking system}} is {{considered}} {{as one of the}} most fundamental safety-critical systems in modern vehicles as its main purpose is to stop or decelerate the vehicle. The frictional heat generated during braking application can cause numerous negative effects on the brake assembly such as brake fade, premature wear, thermal cracks and disc thickness variation (DTV). In the past, surface roughness and wear at the pad interface have rarely been considered in studies of thermal analysis of a disc brake assembly using finite element method. This paper attempts to consider these two aspects to predict temperature distributions in a reduced disc brake model. First, two different brake pad interface models, i. e., smooth and rough surfaces are modelled and simulated. Temperature distributions in these two models are then compared.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the effects of}} brake lining thickness due to wear on drum brake squeal. Brake lining will be worn out and subsequently its thickness will be reduced after a few number of <b>braking</b> <b>applications.</b> Hence dynamic properties of the lining, such as its natural frequency, might be changed. In this work, two different sets of brake lining, i. e., new and worn lining are used to investigate its effect on squeal generation. First, modal testing is performed to determine natural frequencies of those brake linings at free-free boundary condition. Later, squeal tests are carried out using brake dynamometer and squeal frequency is measured up to 10 kHz. Several squeal results are plotted over brake operating conditions to observe the influence of different lining thickness. In addition to these, squeal mechanisms, i. e., modal coupling due to closeness of the natural frequency between drum brake components and negative damping due to negative friction-velocity slope {{that contribute to the}} squeal generation are also investigated and discussed...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis article {{presents}} {{an investigation of}} the temperature changes in dry sliding contact for <b>braking</b> <b>applications.</b> An original metrology method was developed using a special pad with a calcium fluoride 'window' in its centre. As calcium fluoride is transparent to infrared radiation (up to 92 % in 1 - 5 μm spectra), it allows access to the disc surface during friction for estimating its temperature using a two-colour pyrometer. Using this set-up, the surface temperature of the disc was successfully determined during friction. In addition, the temperature in the contact area was compared to that measured immediately outside the contact area; the difference between them proved to be very minimal (< 5 %). The effect of introducing a calcium fluoride 'window' on friction was also studied, and the results show that its use does not affect the friction coefficient. Finally, the wear mechanisms of the calcium fluoride were studied through the characterisation of the worn surfaces using several techniques...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{manufacturing}} process of organic friction material used for <b>braking</b> <b>applications</b> is of importance {{with regard to}} their properties and performance. This article deals with a friction material manufactured according to two different hot molding conditions. An original analysis of polymerization of the phenolic resin matrix led to the choice of temperature and duration of the hot molding process. Two materials were developed, changing the hot molding process according to these two dependent parameters, and their friction and wear behaviors were investigated for various thermal severities of sliding conditions. The thermal conductivity was also analyzed and found to be higher when the hot molding temperature was low and the hot molding duration was long. Wear test results showed that friction was not significantly affected by the process change. On the contrary, wear appeared to be sensitive to hot molding temperature and duration. Hot molding at elevated temperature for a short duration led to higher wear resistance because the rubbing conditions were not severe. On the contrary, hot molding at low temperature for a long duration was in favor of the wear resistance for higher severities of the rubbing conditions...|$|E
