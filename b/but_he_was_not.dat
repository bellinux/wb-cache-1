On Martinuzzi's proposal, the Diet of Hungary elected John Sigismund king on 13September 1540, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> crowned with the Holy Crown of Hungary. The Diet proclaimed Queen Isabella and George Martinuzzi, {{along with two}} {{powerful}} lords, Péter Petrovics and Bálint Török, the guardians of the infant monarch.|$|E

5|$|Ashmole {{became one}} of the {{founding}} Fellows of the Royal Society in 1661, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> very active in the society. His most significant appointment was to the College of Arms as Windsor Herald of Arms in Ordinary in June 1660. In this position he devoted himself {{to the study of the}} history of the Order of the Garter, which had been a special interest of his since the 1650s, and he proposed a design for the Royal Society's coat of arms.|$|E
5|$|Before {{becoming}} a draper, Pick's father {{had had an}} ambition to become a lawyer and he encouraged his son to follow this career. Pick attended St Peter's School in York on a scholarship, but failed to get a scholarship to Magdalen College, Oxford. Instead, he was articled to a York solicitor, George Crombie, in March 1897. He qualified in January 1902 and completed a law degree at the University of London in the same year, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> sufficiently interested in a legal career to apply to practice.|$|E
5|$|Bryan {{had hoped}} to sweep the rural vote and make inroads on urban labor, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> successful. McKinley became the first Republican {{candidate}} to win in New York City, and won in its rival city of Brooklyn as well. He lost only one city {{with a population of}} over 45,000 in the Midwest, and won many rural counties in crucial states. Although Bryan won all states south of Kentucky and from Texas east, McKinley won most urban centers there.|$|E

5|$|Ermac fights {{alongside}} the Earthrealm heroes {{in the opening}} cinematic sequence of the 2006 compilation game , in which a battle royal commences among the combatants at the Pyramid of Argus in the fictional realm of Edenia. He and Nightwolf are overpowered by Sheeva until Kenshi intervenes, and after Quan Chi attacks Kenshi, Ermac hurls Quan Chi off the pyramid but stomps on Kenshi before revealing himself as Shang Tsung in disguise. Midway created a computer-animated concept biography showing Ermac performing a kata routine over the soundtrack of a voiceover of his Deception biography, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> among the seventeen characters who received an official biography for Armageddon and he therefore played no part in the storyline.|$|E
5|$|Galeazzo Marescotti, {{a member}} of the zelanti, was the first serious {{candidate}} proposed two weeks in to the conclave. He was acceptable to the Spanish, but was opposed by the French because they wanted the new pope who was not strong. Bandino Panciatici was suggested by Pietro Ottoboni, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> supported by secular monarchs because he had supported giving benefices to nominees who were independent of the secular authorities. Giacomo Antonio Morigia was acceptable to the secular rulers, but was opposed by the zelanti for lacking governing experience in addition to not being firm or having the energy required. Following the proposal of these candidates, others came up as well, but were quickly rejected.|$|E
5|$|Harvey was an attacking and {{free-flowing}} batsman <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> {{a prolific}} scorer, which was attributed by observers {{to a lack}} of single-mindedness required to succeed at the top level. Neil said that Ray's footwork was suspect and that the stronger bowlers in domestic cricket were able to exploit this. Neil said that if Ray had been able to rectify his weakness, then he could have become a Test player for Australia. Australian captain Bill Lawry said that Harvey was one of the two best district cricketers he had faced. Aside from his batting, Harvey was an occasional leg spinner, and was known for his fielding ability.|$|E

5|$|He {{had always}} been a heavy drinker, and there were times in those seasons of discontent when he drank more than ever. <b>But</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> always drunk. He went on the wagon (for him this meant beer instead of whiskey) for days and weeks at a time. The {{difficulty}} toward the end was that he couldn't hold the stuff. He went to pieces on his second or third drink. And he did not snap back quickly.|$|E
5|$|Hudner begged {{superiors}} {{to allow}} him to return to the wreck to help extract Brown, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> allowed, as other officers feared an ambush of the vulnerable helicopters resulting in casualties. To prevent the body and the aircraft from falling into Chinese or North Korean hands, the U.S. Navy bombed the aircraft with napalm two days later, with pilots reportedly reciting the Lord's Prayer over the radio as they watched Brown's body be consumed by flames. The pilots observed that Brown's body was still stuck in the aircraft, but his clothes were gone. The remains of both Brown and the aircraft were never recovered. Brown was the first African-American U.S. Navy officer killed in the war.|$|E
5|$|In 596, Pope Gregory the Great sent Augustine, prior of {{the monastery}} of St. Andrew in Rome, to England as a missionary, and in 597, a group of nearly forty monks, led by Augustine, landed on the Isle of Thanet in Kent. According to Bede, Æthelberht was {{sufficiently}} distrustful of the newcomers to insist on meeting them under the open sky, {{to prevent them from}} performing sorcery. The monks impressed Æthelberht, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> converted immediately. He agreed to allow the mission to settle in Canterbury and permitted them to preach.|$|E

5|$|In ODI cricket, Chanderpaul's debut came {{seven months}} after his first Test appearance, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> {{required}} to bat as the West Indies reached the target to beat India. He scored his maiden ODI century shortly after his first Test century, in May 1997 against India, scoring 109 runs. He reached his highest ODI score in 1999, making 150 runs during a West Indian record partnership of 226 with Carl Hooper, against South Africa. That innings, along with his score of 149 not out against India in 2007 are the only times he has finished a century innings with a strike rate of quicker than a-run-a-ball in ODI cricket.|$|E
5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1060, Giáp Đồng natives under the {{frontier}} prefectural leader Thàn Thiệu Thái—an imperial in-law to the Lý court through marriage alliance—raided the Song frontier for cattle and militia recruits. He succeeded in taking the Song military leader Yang Baocai hostage, and in autumn of 1060 Song troops were sent into the frontier to rescue the general <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> found. The Song court appointed Yu Jing (余靖; 1000–1064) as a new military commissioner of the Guangnan region and charged him {{with the task of}} quelling the unrest caused by Thàn Thiệu Thái. Yu Jing also sent an agent to Champa to enlist Cham aid against the Song's enemies in Guangnan.|$|E
5|$|It {{is unclear}} who, if anyone, {{was in charge}} of the ship at this point, as Luke Collingwood had been gravely ill for some time. The man who would {{normally}} have replaced him, first mate James Kelsall, had been previously suspended from duty following an argument on 14November. Robert Stubbs had captained a slave ship several decades earlier and he temporarily commanded Zong during Collingwood's incapacitation, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> a registered member of the vessel's crew. According to historian James Walvin, the breakdown of the command structure on the ship might explain the subsequent navigational errors and the absence of checks on supplies of drinking water.|$|E

5|$|Of the 234 {{members of}} the House, Breckinridge was among the 80 that were {{returned}} to their seats for the Thirty-third Congress. Due to his increased seniority, {{he was assigned to}} the more prestigious Ways and Means Committee, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> given a committee chairmanship as many had expected. Although he supported Pierce's pro-slavery agenda on the principle of states' rights and believed that secession was legal, he opposed secession as a remedy to the country's immediate problems. This, coupled with his earlier support of manumission and African colonization, balanced his support for slavery; most still considered him a moderate legislator.|$|E

During a rehab start with the Toledo Mud Hens on April 22, Nathan re-injured his elbow after throwing only 10 pitches. The same night, Nathan underwent MRIs, which tested positive revealing tears in his ulnar collateral ligament of the elbow and his pronator teres muscle, and would undergo Tommy John surgery, ending Nathan's 2015 season. Sources projected that this surgery could end Nathan's career, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> planning to retire yet.|$|E
