25|$|Osterley almost {{immediately}} encountered , Captain Grey, who examined {{the papers of}} M. La Forée, the French officer accompanying Osterely. Nonsuch escorted her to Saugor Roads, where Osterely anchored on 1 March. <b>Because</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> quickly recaptured, the EIC sustained no loss on her cargo.|$|E
25|$|She became {{well-known}} {{outside of}} Italy and in 1559 King Phillip II of Spain {{asked her to}} be lady-in-waiting and art teacher to Queen Elisabeth of Valois, who was only 14 at the time. Queen Elisabeth of Valois and Sofonisba became good friends, and when the Queen died ten years later, Sofonisba left the court <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> sad. She had painted the entire royal family and even the Pope commissioned Anguissola to do {{a portrait of the}} Queen.|$|E
25|$|Engel and {{the other}} {{producers}} {{did not want to}} lose Berkley, however, as she was the strongest actress they'd seen during casting. Berkley originally auditioned for the role of Karen, a love-interest of Zack's on Good Morning, Miss Bliss, but lost the role <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> much taller than Gosselaar at the time. Engel believed that, now that her height was more even {{with the rest of the}} cast, she could be perfect. They were not having much luck in casting the third new character, Jessie Spano, who was conceived as a strong, feminist activist and a straight-A student, so Engel suggested offering the role to Berkley, who gladly accepted it.|$|E
50|$|Naoki's {{homeroom}} teacher. The students {{love her}} in part <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> short. Yui, like Mikoto, {{is from the}} future.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes: <b>she</b> <b>is</b> very clever; {{very popular}} at Paris. But I like Eugenie, <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> good-natured. Her laugh <b>is</b> <b>so</b> hearty.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps <b>she</b> {{does this}} <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> beautiful, Hans, that she fears {{the hearts of}} men who look upon her would melt." ...|$|R
25|$|Psychologists Jack Block and Jeanne Block {{evaluated}} Genie in February 1971 and put {{her language}} below the two-year-old level on the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale. During the next month her vocabulary acquisition began to accelerate at a progressively more rapid pace, with observers putting her active vocabulary at over 100 words. Doctors noted that she seemed to know far more words than she would spontaneously say, but {{could not be sure}} about the extent of either her receptive or expressive vocabulary <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> responsive to nonverbal stimuli. After another month, Genie began spontaneously producing one-word utterances and began to understand increasingly complex sentences. Soon after she appeared to understand some basic elements of the give-and-take nature of conversation, and without prompting could provide non-imitative one-word responses to statements or questions.|$|E
500|$|At the 2015 New York Comic Con, Muto {{revealed}} that the miniseries originated with ideas that were initially developed during the show's second season. He remarked, [...] "There was this idea from season two about Marceline and ... how she got her powers to begin with. We kind of rolled with that and expanded that into eight episodes." [...] Olson was not aware that the producers and writers were working on a Marceline-centric miniseries until the series' head writer, Kent Osborne, casually mentioned it {{to her in a}} conversation; when she learned of this, she reportedly cried <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> excited. Due to the Marceline-centric nature of the miniseries, a new opening was created that features Olson singing the theme song over a bass guitar. This intro was storyboarded by Tom Herpich and was animated by Masaaki Yuasa's company Science SARU.|$|E
500|$|As a toddler, little Maria once {{escaped from}} her bath and ran naked {{up and down}} the palace {{corridor}} while her distracted Irish nurse, Margaretta Eagar, who loved politics, discussed the Dreyfus Affair with a friend. [...] "Fortunately, I arrived just at that moment, picked her up and carried her back to Miss Eagar, who was still talking about Dreyfus," [...] recalled her aunt Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna of Russia. Her older sisters objected to including Maria in their games and once referred to Maria as their [...] "stepsister" [...] <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> good and never got into trouble, recalled Margaretta Eagar in her own memoirs. However, on occasion the sweet-natured Maria could be mischievous. Once, as a little girl, she stole some biscuits from her mother's tea table. As a punishment for her surprising behavior, the governess and Alexandra suggested she be sent to bed; however Nicholas objected, stating, [...] "I was always afraid of the wings growing. I am glad to see she is only a human child." [...] Eagar noted that Maria's love for her father was [...] "marked" [...] and she often tried to escape from the nursery to [...] "go to Papa." [...] When the Tsar was ill with typhoid, the little girl covered a miniature portrait of him with kisses every night.|$|E
60|$|Emmy Lou <b>is</b> irresistibly lovable, <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> {{absolutely}} real. <b>She</b> <b>is</b> just a bewitchingly innocent, huggable little Maid. The book is wonderfully human.|$|R
6000|$|... "Norman {{said he did}} {{not want}} Flora to hear, <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> much with the Hoxton's, and he said they would all watch him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'She {{lives here}} {{to attend to}} the {{pheasants}} and poultry, <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> clever in managing them. They are brought here from the keeper's over the hill. Her father was a fancier.' ...|$|R
500|$|The episode {{opens with}} Rex (Dylan Minnette) {{and his best}} friend Cole (Logan Miller) {{fighting}} over a tennis racquet, which Cole broke, which was Hannah's before the car accident. Rex's tennis coach Tara (Michaela McManus) tries to stop the fight, but Rex had accidentally {{hit her in the}} face. Michael (Jason Isaacs), Rex's father, is called to the school, when Rex tells Michael and Tara that he quit. He is very emotional due to Hannah's (Laura Allen) death, according to Dr. Judith Evans (Cherry Jones). Later in the [...] "red reality", Efrem Vega (Wilmer Valderrama), Michael's partner in the reality, and Michael are called on a new case at a hotel room, where a woman falls into a lake from the hotel. They speak to Cameron Fuller (Eddie Matos) and Darin Knox (Eric Lange) about the case. Fuller and Knox noted that they Fuller dumped the lady, and she was [...] "making a fool of herself", <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> drunk. Fuller thought that he [...] "shouldn't have left her alone". Soon after, as they walking away, Michael sees Rex's former babysitter Kate Porter (Brianna Brown). Michael doesn't introduce Vega to her. Later in his [...] "green reality", Bird (Steve Harris), Michael's partner in this reality, works on a case where a man named Charlie Simmons, who is known to party and take drugs, was murdered. They speak to Dora (Angela Elayne Gibbs) about the case, she leads them to Kate Porter's house in the [...] "green reality". Rather than a successful investment banker, she is a drug addict. She gets some papers and inhales cocaine up her nose in front of the detectives.|$|E
2500|$|After {{her return}} to Plymouth the Lords of the Admiralty wished {{immediately}} to recommission her as a guardship, but then she was put into ordinary instead <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> in need of repair. In 1805 she was ordered repaired. The subsequent major refit lasted for 18 months and cost £35,000. This turned her into a prison hulk, and by 1807 {{she was used to}} hold French prisoners-of-war. [...] She was reduced to a sheer hulk at Plymouth in October 1810, and spent another 32 years in service. Sans Pareil was finally broken up in October 1842.|$|E
2500|$|In one story, {{she fell}} in love with a hunter who had wandered into her kingdom. Soon the two became lovers, with the hunter coming up the {{mountain}} every day. [...] They promised to love each other forever. [...] When Maria discovered that he had met, fell in love with, and married a mortal woman, she was deeply hurt. Realizing that she could not trust townspeople <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> different from them, and that they were just using her, she became angry and refused to give fruits to the trees, let animals and birds roam the forests for hunters to catch, and let fish abound in the lake. People seldom saw her, and those times when she could be seen were often only during pale moonlit nights.|$|E
6000|$|His name is George, {{generally}} speaking. [...] "Call me George!" [...] {{he says to}} the heroine. She {{calls him}} George (in a very low voice, <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> young and timid). Then he is happy.|$|R
50|$|Much {{later on}} Darren and Hannah get married on a drunken road trip. Hannah arrives home {{and refuses to}} divorce <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> young. They later move in {{together}} and begin {{to look out for}} each other.|$|R
6000|$|... "Terence says {{we must go}} to {{tea with}} Mrs. Thornbury <b>because</b> <b>she's</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> kind, but I don't see it; in fact, I'd rather have my right hand sawn in pieces--just imagine! the eyes of all those women!" ...|$|R
2500|$|Parks {{rendered}} crucial {{assistance in}} the first campaign for Congress by John Conyers. She persuaded Martin Luther King (who was generally reluctant to endorse local candidates) to appear with Conyers, thereby boosting the novice candidate's profile. When Conyers was elected, he hired her as a secretary and receptionist for his congressional office in Detroit. She held this position until she retired in 1988. In a telephone interview with CNN on October 24, 2005, Conyers recalled, [...] "You treated her with deference <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> quiet, so serene— just a very special person... There was only one Rosa Parks." [...] Doing much of the daily constituent work for Conyers, Parks often focused on socio-economic issues including welfare, education, job discrimination, and affordable housing. She visited schools, hospitals, senior citizen facilities, and other community meetings and kept Conyers grounded in community concerns and activism.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the close}} of 1985, she portrayed legendary country singer Patsy Cline in Karel Reisz's biopic, Sweet Dreams, {{opposite}} Ed Harris, Ann Wedgeworth, and John Goodman. She was nominated a fourth time for an Oscar and came in second place for both the National Board of Review Award for Best Actress and the National Society of Film Critics Award for Best Actress. In several interviews, Meryl Streep has stated that she [...] "begged" [...] Reisz, who directed her in 1981's The French Lieutenant's Woman, {{for the role of}} Cline, but that his first choice had always been Lange. Streep has also been quite vocal and adamant in her praise for Lange's performance, calling her [...] "beyond wonderful" [...] in the film and stating, [...] "I couldn't imagine doing it as well or even coming close to what Jessica did <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> amazing in it." ...|$|E
2500|$|During the episode, Ziva tells {{a witness}} {{that she and}} Tony shared a hotel room, and that she took the couch so she wouldn't have to hear Tony whine about his back. Tony in turn tells McGee that he took the couch. Ziva asks him why he lied and he returns the question. There was much {{speculation}} {{on the part of}} fans about whether the characters might have shared more than was divulged, but Weatherly said in response, [...] "The truth of what happened is probably something that can be discovered inside the episode itself. If you really listen to what they say, I think it is pretty clear what happened: Nothing." [...] He clarified that Tony and Ziva had [...] "a tremendous amount of fun" [...] in Paris and that, [...] "Ziva had more fun with Tony than she {{thought she was going to}} have, which maybe shocked her a little bit, <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> angry at him after he killed her boyfriend last year." [...] Cote de Pablo added, [...] "Michael has his views of what happened in Paris. I have mine. We haven't discussed it. But all I can say is it was good." [...] Shortly afterwards, Glenn Diaz from BuddyTV reported that the cast was divided on whether or not the characters should be allowed to progress beyond [...] "unfulfilled sexual tension".|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps {{it will be}} {{the first}} time that your sister ever saw me with satisfaction," [...] remarked Lady Montfort, [...] "but I think she will love me now! I always loved her; perhaps <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> like you." ...|$|R
60|$|GEORGE. I {{do think}} it <b>is</b> <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> loyal, and good and {{straight}} that I saw so clearly what a cad I was. I think I found courage to do the only possible thing in her frankness and honesty.|$|R
6000|$|... "No;--that is just it. And {{therefore}} {{she might}} come round without accounting for it. At any rate, you might try. You might {{tell her that}} it is ruining me;--that I shall have to go about wandering over all the world <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> hard-hearted." ...|$|R
2500|$|Willa Holland portrays Kaitlin Cooper (season 4, {{recurring}} season 1, 3). The {{role was}} originally played by Shailene Woodley in a recurring role during Season 1. Kaitlin {{spends much of}} the series at boarding school before returning on a recurring basis in season 3 (now played by Holland) and finally becoming a regular character in season 4. The daughter of Jimmy Cooper and Julie Cooper-Nichol and sister to Marissa Cooper, her personality is more similar to her mother's rather than her father's, and she is portrayed as a regular pot smoker and occasional dealer. Holland observed that [...] "no one can control her" [...] but that her arc in Season 4 finds the character maturing. When asked about any disappointment over the recast, Shailene Woodley responded that, [...] "I was 11 and I was on as a guest, recurring character, or whatever. My character went to boarding school and {{when they decided to}} bring her back, they actually re-auditioned me to bring her back. But I didn't go through puberty until late (...) So, there was no weirdness when Willa Holland got it <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> obviously right for the role... and I was so obviously not [...]" [...] In the series, Willa Holland's character dates a character played by the popular music star Chris Brown in the 4th season of the show.|$|E
60|$|Just {{then they}} heard a shrill scream, and at once the woman rushed toward the house, running in a very comical manner <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> short and fat.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, no, no, no!" [...] she cried, and {{ran from}} {{him up the}} jetty, back to the path.... She was not afraid of him, <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> much more afraid of herself.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes; and it {{is through}} her being of that curious {{undefined}} character which interprets itself to each admirer as whatever {{he would like to}} have it. Old men like her <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> girlish; youths <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> womanly; wicked men <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> good in their eyes; good men <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> wicked in theirs.' ...|$|R
500|$|Uma (performed by Stephanie D'Abruzzo) <b>is</b> Oobi's sister. <b>She</b> loves singing, pretending, and chickens. Her catchphrases are [...] "Nice!" [...] and [...] "Pretty."

5000|$|Ramona Quimby: Ramona is Beezus's younger sister.

60|$|I {{explained}} that I {{did not know}} her, and though I wished I did <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> pretty, it would not perhaps be quite right {{to go to her}} house to see her.|$|E
60|$|The other frequenters of the lair on Saturday nights (when {{alone the}} {{rebellion}} was active) were the proud Lady Grizel and Widow Elspeth. It had been thought {{best to make}} Elspeth a widow, <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> religious.|$|E

6000|$|At times Lady Cicely's {{animation}} breaks. She {{falls into}} a fit of coughing and presses {{her hand to her}} side. Mr. Harding looks at her apprehensively.

50|$|Travis and Parker come {{together}} to apologize, and Travis confesses that he <b>is</b> <b>so</b> afraid <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> individual from everyone he's met, Parker agrees, and says to him that she really likes him, but that she just gets nervous.
