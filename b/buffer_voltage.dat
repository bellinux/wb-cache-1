The analysis is performed by evaluating the <b>buffer</b> <b>voltage</b> gain {{with respect to the}} fin width and channel length as well as the total harmonic distortion. It is demonstrated that {{the application of}} strained material in narrow FinFETs, when the devices are operating in double-gate mode, can be beneficial for the performance of buffers in any channel length. On the other hand, for triple-gate FinFETs or quasi-planar ones the degradation of the output conductance overcomes the transconductance improvements from strained material and the performance of standard buffers is better than of strained ones. Narrow strained buffers also offer better harmonic distortion...|$|E

40|$|Switch-mode voltage {{regulators}} are considered {{as the dominant}} choice for low-power integrated power supplies. Employing the advantages of a switch-mode voltage regulator in 0. 18 µm CMOS technology, a power supply has been designed for a complete System-on-Chip (SoC). While offering enough drive capability for the entire system, the supply provides an extra highly-regulated output for noise-sensitive analog blocks. At first, a front-end buck regulator converts the time-variant unregulated input voltage to an initially-regulated general voltage. To further regulate this voltage for noise-sensitive blocks, a new continuous-time <b>buffered</b> <b>voltage</b> source {{has been added to}} the circuit. To maximize power efficiency and to benefit from an initially-regulated input, this source is connected to the front-end switch-mode regulator output. For proper operation, the minimum input voltage to the supply is 1. 3 V. With this minimum input voltage, the 1. 1 V switching regulator sources up to 1 A output current. The continuous-time 0. 9 V- buffered source provides up to 100 mA for noise-sensitive units. It converts the 1. 1 V regulated voltage to a 0. 9 V smooth output.
