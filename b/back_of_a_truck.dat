5|$|In {{accordance}} with normal repatriation procedures, Wilder-Neligan's commission in the AIF was terminated following {{his return to}} Australia in October 1919. He {{was involved in the}} formation of a soldiers' political party in Queensland, travelling the country and delivering speeches from the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>truck.</b> On 1 January 1920 he was appointed as a lieutenant colonel in the part-time army, the Citizens' Forces. In late March the following year he transferred to the Australian Naval and Military Expeditionary Force, which was then occupying German New Guinea. This appointment was at the rank of lieutenant. He did not immediately travel to New Guinea, living on the north coast of Queensland for two months, and visiting Brisbane in early May to receive his French Croix de guerre from the former AIF commander Field Marshal Sir William Birdwood during the latter's first visit to Australia. Wilder-Neligan travelled to New Guinea later that year to take up his appointment.|$|E

25|$|A {{turntable}} ladder (TL) {{is perhaps the}} best-known form of special purpose aerial apparatus, and is used {{to gain access to}} fires occurring at height using a large telescopic ladder, where conventional ladders carried on conventional appliances might not reach. The name is derived {{from the fact that the}} large ladder is mounted on a turntable on the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>truck</b> chassis, allowing it to pivot around a stable base. To increase its length, the ladder is telescopic. Modern telescopic ladders are either hydraulic or pneumatic. These mechanical features allow the use of ladders which are longer, sturdier, and more stable. They may also have pre-attached hoses or other equipment.|$|E

25|$|This first Arājs {{action was}} later {{described}} by Georg Rosenstock, {{the commander of}} the second company of the 13th Police Reserve battalion. Rosenstock testified after the war that when he and his unit had arrived in Liepāja in July, 1941, they had heard from some passing marines that Jews were being continuously executed in the town, and these marines were going out to watch the executions. A few days later, on Saturday, July 24, 1941, Rosenstock saw Jews (whom he identified by the yellow stars on their clothing) crouching down in the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>truck,</b> being guarded by armed Latvians. Rosenstock, who was himself in a vehicle, followed the truck {{to the north of the}} city to the beach near the naval base, where he saw Kügler, some SD men, and a number of Jews.|$|E
25|$|Although for the reactor's backup {{systems were}} available, the power loss proved {{that that was}} not the case for the spent fuel pools. No {{measures}} had been taken to prevent small animals entering this important equipment located at the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>truck</b> in open air. On 21 March, TEPCO apologized for the delay in reporting the power loss, and for not contacting the media, and promised to improve on this. The NRA decided, that it would speed up the installment of back-up power supply systems, and more durable and reliable systems. A meeting of experts was announced for 29 March 2013 to discuss the TEPCO report on the subject. Serious criticism came from the Japanese government; TEPCO was instructed to install multiple power supplies, and to do more to restore public confidence in the safety of the plant. Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said at a press conference, that TEPCO was ordered to improve its risk management, that TEPCO had not promptly informed the authorities, and that TEPCO's handling of the power failure had greatly damaged public trust in the company.|$|E
25|$|Kane then rekindled his {{feud with}} Edge, who, on the October 28 episode of SmackDown, {{was named the}} new {{challenger}} to Kane's World Heavyweight Championship at Survivor Series. On the November 12 episode of SmackDown, Edge kidnapped Bearer and started to play mind games with Kane, trying to psychologically wear him down before their title match. At Survivor Series, Kane retained his title after the referee determined the match a draw due to both men pinning {{each other at the}} same time. As Edge still had Bearer in his captivity, Kane agreed to a rematch at the next pay-per-view. On December 3, Edge defeated Kane in a non-title match to win the right to determine the stipulation for the title match; Edge chose a Tables, Ladders and Chairs match before leaving Kane with a Paul Bearer lookalike and driving away with the genuine Bearer strapped to the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>truck.</b> The following week, Kane accidentally injured Bearer, believing it to be another hoax by Edge, and Bearer was written out of the storyline. The week after, Kane rampaged into the stadium to hunt down Edge hoping to get back at him but the two were nearly restrained by the entire Smackdown roster.|$|E

500|$|The race {{marked the}} first Brazilian Grand Prix to be held {{since the death of}} three-time {{champion}} Ayrton Senna the previous year in a racing accident at the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix.

[...] The São Paulo city authorities had planned to rename the circuit after Senna, but the family of Carlos Pace, the existing dedicatee, objected. Barrichello also sported a special helmet design as a personal tribute to his compatriot. As a result of Senna's death, the event was lower-key than in recent years: fewer spectators turned out to watch practice and qualifying, but the race itself was watched by a capacity crowd.|$|E
