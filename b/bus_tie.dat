40|$|Abstract- This paper {{analyzed}} {{the selection of}} practical impedance of Superconducting fault current limiter (SFCL) on <b>bus</b> <b>tie</b> in a power distribution system. Generally, the parallel operation of main transformer offers a number of advantages. However, when a fault occurred in the parallel operation of main transformer, the fault currents could exceed the capacity of conventional protective device and might generate protective coordination problems. To solve these problems, the SFCL has been studied as the attractive device. Especially, in power distribution system on <b>bus</b> <b>tie</b> with SFCL, {{the effect of the}} resistance of SFCL could decrease the increased fault currents and could meet the capacity of conventional protective devices by them.

40|$|Due to {{an urgent}} need for an {{international}} protocol for power protection and substation automation, the International Electrotechnical Committee (IEC) and Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE) agreed to collaborate together to advance the existing communication protocols for substation automation system (SAS). The objectives were to achieve interoperability and free configuration in a multi-vendor environment substation. The outcome of this agreement was to announce {{the first edition of}} the IEC 61850 Standard as an international standard in 2004. The standard incorporates the use of logical nodes to resolve problems related to interoperability and interchangeability in multi-vendor zone substation systems. The standard also initiated a cost-effective Generic Object Oriented Substation Event (GOOSE) messaging technology to replace the traditional copper wiring. The second edition of the IEC 61850 Standard was published in 2014 which is encapsulated in a series of 20 documents spanning over ten sections. The last few years has seen numerous studies pointing to the IEC 61850 as a worthwhile international standard for substation automation system. There is still, nevertheless, resistance from utilities to welcoming the IEC 61850 implementation. This may perhaps be {{due to the lack of}} knowledge that engineers have about the standard and/or because of several ambiguous topics that still are not addressed in detail in the context of IEC 61850. Furthermore, it should go without saying that, the GOOSE technology has brought several benefits to the power protection and communication systems in the field of substation automation. However, the lack of tools and knowledge to take advantage of the GOOSE messaging technology in IEC 61850 -based zone substations is tangible. For instance, in order to test an Intelligent Electronic Device (IED), isolating a GOOSE message from substation is a main industrial challenge for engineers. When an IED is isolated from live substation for test purposes, its GOOSE message is not isolated yet, and the IED under test is still publishing the GOOSE trip signal to other IEDs. In order to isolate the GOOSE trip signal for IED test purposes, each vendor implements its own method and they use their proprietary configurator tools. This means that, engineers are desperately dealing with a lack of comprehensive tool or method to isolate the GOOSE trip signal in a multi-vendor zone substation. These challenges led to the slow migration of the standard into substations. Having acknowledged these difficulties and challenges the spotlight is seemingly in the path of developing a tool or program to be utilised for GOOSE isolation and GOOSE management in a multi-vendor relay environment. In doing that, a 66 / 22 kV Distribution Terminal Zone Substation is implemented accompanied with a SCADA centre as a model of an IEC 61850 -based Substation. Two bays with separate 66 kV sub-transmission lines, 66 / 22 kV step down transformers, 22 kV Bus 1 with <b>Bus</b> <b>Tie</b> Circuit Breaker and three 22 kV feeders per bay have been considered for the simulation. In the construction of the Substation Simulator, the aim is to take advantage of the IEC 61850 GOOSE messaging technology for protection, control, monitoring and communication purposes. Hence, the hardwire connections are replaced by GOOSE signals through optic cables as much as possible. This thesis will not only provide the design and configuration procedures of this substation, but also will cover the difficulties that engineers may encounter in IEC 61850 -based substations systems in terms of device configuration, testing and maintenance. In order to fully understand the concept of the 66 / 22 kV Distribution Terminal Zone Substation, it is very essential to be familiar with the structure of communication protocols and the IEC 61850 Standard. This thesis starts by exploring a synopsis of communication protocols and their development over the time. It elucidates core elements of telemetry communications, structures of protocols and the significance of standards for communication protocols within substation automation systems. This is followed by a comprehensive exploration of the fundamentals of the IEC 61850 -based substations. In particular, it will cover the GOOSE messaging technology and interoperability in a multi-vendor substation environment. The author also addresses the difficulties that engineers may encounter in IEC 61850 -based substations systems in terms of device configuration, testing and maintenance...|$|E

40|$|A photo-voltaic system {{consists}} of solar cells, power converters, battery and the load. The power converter interfaces the solar cells, battery and the load. The battery serves to equalise the energy demand (load) {{and the energy}} supply (solar cell). Currently the solar cells and the battery cost nearly 90 % of the system cost. A typical photo-voltaic system can adopt various power <b>bus</b> configurations. Battery <b>tied</b> <b>bus</b> is the simplest of the power bus configurations. In this topology, the battery is always attached to the bus. This system is extremely simple in terms of power circuit configuration as well as control. Such systems weigh less and are more reliable. However, the battery <b>tied</b> <b>bus</b> suffers certain disadvantages. The first {{among them is the}} poor utilisation of solar panels. The load has to tolerate the full swing of the battery voltage variation. On account of the constraint on the solar panel voltage, the solar panels may not be loaded to the maximum power capacity. Such operating conditions lead to gross under-utilisation of the expensive solar panels. The battery <b>tied</b> <b>bus</b> configuration is designed, built and evaluated experimentally with 4 solar panels rated at 35 W each and a lead acid battery of 12 V 42 AH rating. This thesis explores alternate power architecture to overcome the above limitations. Load regulation and maximum power harvesting from the solar panels are the objectives. In the proposed configuration, a bidirectional power converter is inserted between the bus and the battery. The bidirectional power converter operates in boost mode and charges the battery when the sunlight is available. During eclipse period, it operates in buck mode and meets the load demand. The maximum power is extracted from the panels by controlling the voltage across the solar panels. The bus voltage reference is computed by MPPT block and the bus voltage is regulated to the reference voltage through closed loop control. So the maximum power is extracted from the panels at the expense of extra bidirectional power converter. Even though there is an additional power loss due to the introduction of power converter, this power bus configuration is superior because it increases the output power from the panel itself. The entire control logic implementation is done digitally using dspic 30 F 6010 A. The simulation is done by writing script files in C language. The proposed bus configuration is designed, built and evaluated experimentally with the same setup and the results are then compared...|$|R
