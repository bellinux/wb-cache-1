5|$|Harmless to humans, the cloudy {{catshark}} adapts well to captivity and has {{reproduced in}} the aquarium. It {{is often used}} as a model organism in physiology research. On September 25, 1995, Masuda Motoyashi and colleagues used this species to perform the first successful artificial insemination of a shark or ray. The cloudy catshark is caught incidentally by commercial fisheries with <b>bottom</b> <b>fishing</b> nets including trawls and gillnets, {{as well as on}} bottom longlines. Captured individuals are typically discarded, possibly with a high survival rate due to their hardiness. Some 40% of the fish discarded in Yamaguchi Prefecture fisheries are of this species. The bottom trawl fishery operating off Fukushima Prefecture may catch over a ton of cloudy catsharks annually, which are also discarded.|$|E
25|$|While <b>bottom</b> <b>fishing</b> or jigging can be {{done from}} small boats, it was long thought that {{effective}} trolling required speeds of five to ten knots, a speed well out {{of the range of}} someone paddling. However, the discovery that fish could be taken at much lesser speeds has increased the popularity of kayak fishing.|$|E
25|$|<b>Bottom</b> <b>fishing</b> has {{operated}} {{for over a}} century on heavily fished grounds such as the North Sea and Grand Banks. While overfishing has long been recognised as causing major ecological changes to the fish community on the Grand Banks, concern has been raised more recently about the damage which benthic trawling inflicts upon seabed communities. A species of particular concern is the slow growing, deep water coral Lophelia pertusa. This species is home to a diverse community of deep sea organisms, but is easily damaged by fishing gear. On 17 November 2004, the United Nations General Assembly urged nations to consider temporary bans on high seas bottom trawling.|$|E

500|$|The {{book is a}} travelogue and {{biological}} record, but also reveals the two men's philosophies: it dwells on the place of humans in the environment, the interconnection between single organisms and the larger ecosystem, and the themes of leaving and returning home. A number of ecological concerns, rare in 1940, are voiced, such as an imagined but horrific vision of the long term damage that the Japanese <b>bottom</b> <b>fishing</b> trawlers are doing to the sea bed. Although written {{as if it were}} the journal kept by Steinbeck during the voyage, the book is to some extent a work of fiction: the journals are not Steinbeck's, and his wife, who had accompanied him on the trip, is not mentioned (though at one point Steinbeck slips and mentions the matter of food for seven people). Since returning home is a theme throughout the narrative, the inclusion of his wife, a symbol of home, would have dissipated the effect. Steinbeck and Ricketts are never mentioned by name but are amalgamated into the first person [...] "we" [...] who narrate the log.|$|E

40|$|Comparative fishing {{experiments}} {{to study the}} relative utility of different methods for increased vertical spread of bottom trawl {{and the availability of}} off <b>bottom</b> <b>fishes</b> in the region were made using gussets, kite, separate float line and side panels on a two seam net. The catch rates as well as composition of fish were studied. The opening of the trawl mouth, both horizontally and vertically, under different operating gears and towing tension on warps were measured and estimated for comparison purposes. Better catch rate with good quality fishes was obtained with the gear operated with separate float line. With kite, the vertical spread was increased with less catch indicating poor concentration of off <b>bottom</b> <b>fishes...</b>|$|R

40|$|Experimental {{trawling}} {{operations for}} <b>bottom</b> <b>fish</b> were first begun in 1920 {{and consisted of}} surveys of the continental shelf around Ceylon and the west and east coasts of India. These preliminary surveys showed that the continental shelf of Ceylon was either very poor in <b>bottom</b> <b>fish</b> or that the ground was so rough that trawling {{has proved to be}} economically not sustainable (Malpas, 1926). Although a considerable amount of trawling has been carried out using small-meshed trawls, there is no record of the details of the gear used or any account of the relative efficiency of the different designs of trawls used in the operations. Experimental operations were, therefore, carried out off 80 h. p. boats such as m. f. v. Canadian and North Star, to select the most effective gear for these boats. In more recent times experiments were also conducted to select the most effective trawling gear for the 11 -Ton boats of the Ceylon Fisheries Corporation. The results are reported in this publication...|$|R
