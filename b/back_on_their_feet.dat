She sold off her millinery shop to cover her late husband's gambling debts, which totaled $2,000. Once the debt was settled, Hanson was left with $89 in total. Hanson's brother-in-law, Albert Leach, who had visited her while in prison, mortgaged his horse and carriage to get Hanson and her three children <b>back</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>feet</b> financially.|$|E
25|$|Clara Barton of the American Red Cross {{purchased}} 1.5 million {{strawberry plants}} {{and sent them}} to Pasadena to help victims of the flood get <b>back</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>feet.</b> By the 1930s those crops had flourished so much that Pasadena was claiming the title of Strawberry Capital of the World. At its height, the city's strawberry growers shipped as many as 28 train carloads of strawberries each day. To honor that history, the city still holds an annual Pasadena Strawberry Festival. Strawberry Road stretches through much of the city near where the old strawberry crops grew. Attendance at the annual Strawberry Festival was 56,000 in 2008.|$|E

If your hip opens up, you have gone too far." [...] A gentle but noticeable resistance is maintained during the rock step. Then both partners replace weight on {{the second part of}} the first beat. On the next beat, the lead takes a step to the left and the follow to the right. Then both partners repeat, but on opposite feet (the lead rocks <b>back</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> right <b>foot</b> and moves to the right).|$|R

500|$|No major federal {{financial}} assistance was {{made available to}} the survivors of the Oklahoma City bombing, but the Murrah Fund set up {{in the wake of the}} bombing attracted over $300,000 in federal grants. Over $40million was donated to the city to aid disaster relief and to compensate the victims. Funds were initially distributed to families who needed it to get <b>back</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>feet,</b> and the rest was held in trust for longer-term medical and psychological needs. By 2005, $18million of the donations remained, some of which was earmarked to provide a college education for each of the 219children who lost one or both parents in the bombing. [...] A committee chaired by Daniel Kurtenbach of Goodwill Industries provided {{financial assistance}} to the survivors.|$|E
500|$|Trauma or illness {{may also}} {{result in a}} cow unable to rise to its feet. [...] Such animals are {{sometimes}} called [...] "downers." [...] Sometimes this {{occurs as a result}} of muscle and nerve damage from calving or a disease such as mastitis. [...] Leg injuries, muscle tears, or a massive infection of some sort may also be causes. Downer cows are encouraged to get to their feet and have a much greater chance of recovery if they do. If unable to rise, some have survived—with medical care—as long as 14 days and were ultimately able to get <b>back</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>feet.</b> Appropriate medical treatment for a downer cow to prevent further injury includes rolling {{from one side to the}} other every three hours, careful and frequent feeding of small amounts of fodder, and access to clean water.|$|E

5000|$|Lyrics in {{the song}} [...] "Undivided" [...] were {{influenced}} by the September 11 attacks. It simply states that No Man Is an Island and that all people {{are part of the}} greater world, that is humanity, that all people are stronger together, than being apart. Song [...] "Everyday" [...] was inspired also by September 11 attacks. It reinforces the need to live each day to its fullest and the lyrics acknowledge the harshness of life, but encourage listeners to [...] "brush themselves off", get <b>back</b> up <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>feet</b> and get <b>on</b> with life. [...] "The Distance" [...] is written in a cinematic style. The music serves as a score to the lyrics, which begins as an establishing shot and the [...] "camera" [...] draws closer into the story as the song progresses. The lyrics talk about the passion that person feels when there is a goal in sight and the determination shown when person is striving to reach that goal. Song [...] "Joey" [...] is influenced and inspired by Elton John's song Levon (1971) and talks about a character who befriends a simple-minded young man. [...] "Misunderstood" [...] is a song about every guy who's said the wrong thing or failed to say the right thing and had to face with the consequences. The song was written after Jon Bon Jovi came home after long period of time and when he realised there were portions of his personal life he had neglected and wrote this song to admit his guiltiness. Song [...] "All About Lovin' You" [...] is a love song that talks about appreciating the love of another. It was also influenced by September 11 events and how many people after that tragedy rediscovered that love is most important thing in life.|$|R
6000|$|Comus {{stood looking}} at the {{portrait}} of his mother with the feeling of one who comes suddenly across a once-familiar half-forgotten acquaintance in unfamiliar surroundings. The likeness was undoubtedly a good one, but the artist had caught an expression in Francesca's eyes which few people had ever seen there. It was {{the expression of a}} woman who had forgotten for one short moment to be absorbed in the small cares and excitements of her life, the money worries and little social plannings, and had found time to send a look of half-wistful friendliness to some sympathetic companion. Comus could recall that look, fitful and fleeting, in his mother's eyes when she had been a few years younger, before her world had grown to be such a committee-room of ways and means. Almost as a re-discovery he remembered that she had once figured in his boyish mind as a [...] "rather good sort," [...] more ready to see the laughable side of a piece of mischief than to labour forth a reproof. That the bygone feeling of good fellowship had been stamped out was, he knew, probably in great part his own doing, and it was possible that the old friendliness was still there under the surface of things, ready to show itself again if he willed it, and friends were becoming scarcer with him than enemies in these days. Looking at the picture with its wistful hint of a long ago comradeship, Comus made up his mind that he very much wanted things to be <b>back</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> earlier <b>footing,</b> and to see again on his mother's face the look that the artist had caught and perpetuated in its momentary flitting. If the projected Elaine-marriage came off, and in spite of recent maladroit behaviour on his part he still counted it an assured thing, much of the immediate cause for estrangement between himself and his mother would be removed, or at any rate, easily removable. With the influence of Elaine's money behind him he promised himself that he would find some occupation that would remove from himself the reproach of being a waster and idler. There were lots of careers, he told himself, that were open to a man with solid financial backing and good connections. There might yet be jolly times ahead, in which his mother would have her share of the good things that were going, and carking thin-lipped Henry Greech and other of Comus's detractors could take their sour looks and words out of sight and hearing. Thus, staring at the picture as though he were studying its every detail, and seeing really only that wistful friendly smile, Comus made his plans and dispositions for a battle that was already fought and lost.|$|R

2500|$|The {{homeless}} shelters {{across the country}} act merely as emergency shelter systems that can only hold {{a fraction of the}} rapidly increasing homeless population. The Housing First practice provides an alternative to the current network of {{homeless shelters}}. The program targets the large problem within the United States which is a lack of affordable housing. [...] This methodology attempts to place homeless families back into independent living situations as quickly as possible. The Housing First practice has achieved success from the fact that homeless families are more responsive to social services support once when they are in their own housing. It provides crisis intervention, affordable rental housing, and gives each family a grace period of {{six months to a year}} of social service to allow the family to get <b>back</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>feet.</b> [...] The effectiveness of this concept is that it assists homeless families in identifying their needs and recognizing the choices they must make. From this point families can create better options for them and plan strategies for living on their own.|$|E
