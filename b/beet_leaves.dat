2500|$|In Italy, {{broad beans}} are {{traditionally}} sown on November 2, All Souls Day. Small cakes {{made in the}} shape of broad beans (though not out of them) are known as fave dei morti or [...] "beans of the dead". According to tradition, Sicily once experienced a failure of all crops other than the beans; the beans kept the population from starvation, and thanks were given to Saint Joseph. Broad beans subsequently became traditional on Saint Joseph's Day altars in many Italian communities. Some people carry a broad bean for good luck; some believe that if one carries a broad bean, one will never be without the essentials of life. In Rome, on the first of May, Roman families traditionally eat fresh fava beans with Pecorino Romano cheese during a daily excursion in the Campagna. In northern Italy, on the contrary, fava beans are traditionally fed to animals and some people, especially the elderly, might frown on human consumption. But in Liguria, a maritime region near northern Italy, fava beans are loved raw, and consumed fresh in early spring as the first product of the garden, alone or with fresh Pecorino Sardo or with local salami from Sant'Olcese. In some Central Italian regions, a once-popular and recently rediscovered fancy food is the bagiana, a soup of fresh or dried fava beans seasoned with onions and <b>beet</b> <b>leaves</b> stir-fried, before being added to the soup, in olive oil and lard (or bacon or cured ham fat).|$|E

40|$|The {{relative}} {{contributions of}} invertase and sucrose synthase to initial cleavage of phloem-imported sucrose {{was calculated for}} sink leaves of soybean (Glycine max L. Merr cv Wye) and sugar beet (Beta vulgaris L. monohybrid). Invertase from yeast hydrolyzed sucrose 4200 times faster than 1 ′-deoxy- 1 ′-fluorosucrose (FS) while sucrose cleavage by sucrose synthase from developing soybean leaves proceeded only 3. 6 times faster than cleavage of FS. [14 C]Sucrose and [14 C]FS, used as tracers of sucrose, were transported at identical rates to developing leaves through the phloem. The rate of label incorporation into insoluble products varied with leaf age from 3. 4 to 8. 0 times faster when [14 C]sucrose was supplied than when [14 C]FS was supplied. The discrimination in metabolism was related to enzymatic discriminations against FS to calculate the relative contributions of invertase and sucrose synthase to sucrose cleavage. In the youngest soybean leaves measured, 4 % of final laminar length (FLL), all cleavage was by sucrose synthase. Invertase contribution to sucrose metabolism was 47 % by 7. 6 % FLL, increased to 54 % by 11 % FLL, then declined to 42 % {{for the remainder of}} the import phase.

The quality of work depends on type of soil, working speed, depth of tillage, and on direction of wheels rotation.

The same is, with suger <b>beet</b> in five <b>leaves</b> stage of growth, and with winter wheat in the period of early spring harrowing. The crust breaking is more efficient at higher speeds, and deeper tillage. But, at the same speed and depth the crust,breaking with rotary hoe will be more efficient if the soil is lighter. The best performance in killing weeds is achieved when they are in the earliest stage of growth (small seedlings).

40|$|The {{potential}} of measurements of chlorophyll fluorescence in vivo to detect cellular responses to salinity and degrees of salt stress in leaves was investigated for three crop plants. Sugar beet (Beta vulgaris L.) (salt tolerant), sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) (moderately salt tolerant), and bean (Phaseolus Vulgaris L. cv Canadian Wonder) (salt intolerant) were grown in pots and watered with mineral nutrient solution containing 100 millimolar NaCl. The fast rise in variable chlorophyll fluorescence yield that is correlated with photoreduction of photosystem II acceptors increased in <b>leaves</b> of sugar <b>beet</b> plants treated with salt suggesting stimulation of photosystem II activity relative to photosystem I. In sunflower, this fast rise was depressed by approximately 25 % {{and the subsequent}} slow rate of quenching of the chlorophyll fluorescence was stimulated. These differences were more marked in the older mature leaves indicating an increasing gradient of salt response down the plant. The salt effect in vivo was reversible since chloroplasts isolated from mature leaves of salt-treated and control sunflower plants gave similar photosystem II activities. Unlike in sugar <b>beet</b> and sunflower, <b>leaves</b> of salt-treated bean progressively lost chlorophyll. The rate of slow quenching of chlorophyll fluorescence decreased indicating development of a partial block after photosystem II and possible initial stimulation of photosystem II activity.
