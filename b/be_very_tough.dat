500|$|In February 2005, Lost {{producers}} {{began looking}} for a Latina woman in her mid-thirties {{who would be the}} leader of the tail section, and a romantic interest for Jack. The agent of Michelle Rodriguez (who was 26 at the time) called the producers, informing them Rodriguez was interested in the role, but only for a year. Rodriguez, producers Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse, and Lost creator J. J. Abrams met, and Rodriguez explained she would only be interested in one season because she was a [...] "nomadic spirit", but would like to do one [...] "kickass arc" [...] as she called it. The producers liked her energy, so agreed, with the plan to kill Ana Lucia {{at the end of the}} season. Rodriguez felt she had been typecast in tough female roles, so wanted this role to be different. Ana Lucia was planned to start as a tough character, because that is what the audience would expect, then the layers of the character would be gradually peeled back. Rodriguez described Ana Lucia as an [...] "animalistic type creature... tamed by the Island." [...] They reconstructed the character slightly to fit what they liked about Rodriguez, such as making her more [...] "street smart" [...] with a [...] "speak-her-mind quality." [...] Ana Lucia made her first appearance in the penultimate episode of season one, in order to set up her character becoming part of the cast in the next season. All Rodriguez was told about her character was both she and her mother were in the police force. Ana Lucia's style of leadership deliberately contrasts Jack's; Jack is a reluctant leader, whereas Ana Lucia quickly takes charge on her own. In her early appearances, Ana Lucia is shown to <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>tough,</b> so the flashbacks in [...] "Collision", where it is revealed [...] she lost her baby, were used to show a softer side to her.|$|E
2500|$|The {{clutches}} on drift cars tend to <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>tough</b> ceramic brass button or multiple-plate varieties for durability, {{as well as}} {{to allow}} rapid [...] "clutch kick" [...] techniques to upset the balance of the car. Gearbox and engine mounts are often replaced with urethane or aluminum mounts, and dampers added to control the violent motion of the engine and gearbox under these conditions. The driveshafts are often replaced with carbon fiber drive shafts as they offer the highest rotational mass savings as well as being stronger than other alternative metals, and flexible enough to absorb and dissipate vibrations, so easing the load on the gear box as well {{as the rest of the}} drivetrain.|$|E
2500|$|Meanwhile, the British Eighth Army—held on Route 9 at Forlì—continued a {{subsidiary}} {{drive up the}} Adriatic coast and captured Ravenna on 5 November. In early November, the push up Route 9 resumed, and the river Montone, just beyond Forlì, was crossed on 9 November. However, the going continued to <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>tough</b> with the river Cosina, some [...] further along Route 9 being crossed only on 23 November. By 17 December, the river Lamone had been assaulted and Faenza cleared. The German 10th Army established itself on the raised banks of the river Senio (rising at least [...] above the surrounding plain) which ran across {{the line of the}} Eighth Army advance just beyond Faenza down to the Adriatic north of Ravenna. With snows falling and winter firmly established, any attempt to cross the Senio {{was out of the question}} and the Eighth Army's 1944 campaign came to an end.|$|E

2500|$|Camels are the {{ultimate}} pillars that support national economies of many developing countries, because they are useful for transport, and provide food {{in the form of}} meat and milk (Tariq et al.,2010). A camel carcass can provide a substantial amount of meat. The male dromedary carcass can weigh , while the carcass of a male Bactrian can weigh up to [...] The carcass of a female dromedary weighs less than the male, ranging between [...] The brisket, ribs and loin are among the preferred parts, and the hump is considered a delicacy. The hump contains [...] "white and sickly fat", which {{can be used to make}} the khli (preserved meat) of mutton, beef, or camel. On the other hand, camel milk and meat are rich in protein, vitamins, glycogen, and other nutrients making them essential in the diet of many people. From chemical composition to meat quality, the dromedary camel is the preferred breed for meat production. It does well even in arid areas due to its unusual physiological behaviors and characteristics, which include tolerance to extreme temperatures, radiation from the sun, water paucity, rugged landscape and low vegetation (Aleme, 2013). Camel meat is reported to taste like coarse beef, but older camels can prove to <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>tough,</b> although camel meat becomes more tender the more it is cooked. The Abu Dhabi Officers' Club serves a camel burger mixed with beef or lamb fat in order to improve the texture and taste. In Karachi, Pakistan, some restaurants prepare nihari from camel meat. In Syria and Egypt, there are specialist camel butchers.|$|E
