500|$|The 2008 Beijing Olympics caused {{traditional}} Hutong {{neighborhoods to}} be cleared {{for the construction of}} modern Olympic stadiums. In an effort to ensure success for the games, the government invested billions in <b>building</b> <b>new</b> <b>infrastructure,</b> although clearance to tiny, outdated neighborhoods in Beijing called hutongs resulted (Petrun). Jim Yardley, a New York Times reporter interviews Pan Jinyu, a 64-year-old local resident: [...] "They [...] don’t want foreigners to see this scarred old face". Feng Shuqin and her husband, Zheng Zhanlin have lived in their house for 50 years and the family has owned the property before the Communists took control in 1949. The government, trying to clear the area, has offered them to move with a compensatory sum of $175,000 USD, but the family insists the land is worth $1.4 million USD (Yardley). Michael Meyer, an American who lives in the hutongs reported that a total of 500,000 residents were relocated from their homes before the Olympics began (Meyer).|$|E

2500|$|The Cycle Super Highways are {{a series}} of bike paths that connect Copenhagen to nearby suburbs. This {{initiative}} began in 2009 when both Copenhagen and the neighboring cities realized that <b>building</b> <b>new</b> <b>infrastructure</b> would allow commuters to bike into the city and create more sustainable transportation options. Since traffic planners believe {{it will be very difficult}} to raise the modal share substantially beyond the current 50% for its own residents, the city has begun targeting commuters entering the city from surrounding municipalities on trips in the [...] range, aiming to increase the number of bicycle commuters by 30% throughout the capital region. The project involves a [...] network of 26 named and signposted routes following a uniform standard with high maintenance and good services such as automatic air-pumps and prioritized snow removal. While international media has created some hyperbole around the concept, labelling the network as bicycle superhighways, they are largely not grade separated. Rather the routes are regular cycle tracks receiving smaller targeted upgrades.|$|E

The scheme had some similarities to the 'Milford Dart' scheme, but apparently did not go forward apparently due to the high difficulties faced with <b>building</b> <b>new</b> <b>infrastructure</b> in the two national parks.|$|E

50|$|The main {{objectives}} of the Keita Project are to increase food security and reverse desertification in the Ader, Doutchi and Maggia valleys of Keita Department, an area which faced environmental collapse from the 1970s; a secondary objective is to thereby to reduce {{the high rate of}} migration from this region to Italy. The methods used have included reforestation and land reclamation, <b>building</b> <b>new</b> <b>infrastructure,</b> setting up peasants' associations, and providing technical and financial assistance. The results have been to stop and reverse falls in crop yields and livestock numbers, to cover large areas of marginal land with forest and productive farmland, and to provide new sources of income from the land. However, desertification has continued to some degree and food security has not been fully achieved due to very high population growth.|$|E
50|$|The Transport Ministry’s {{working group}} {{reported}} in December 2013 that a tax proportional to road use would implement transport and environment policies better than current fixed taxes on motoring, although collection {{costs would be}} many times higher. The focus of transport policy should be on solving capacity problems by managing demand rather than by <b>building</b> <b>new</b> <b>infrastructure.</b> However, it argued that buses and lorries should be exempted from road use charges {{on the grounds that}} the rise in costs could not be offset by cutting other heavy vehicle road taxes, which were already close to the minimum set in the EU’s vignette directive. For private cars the report looked at the implications of fixed and regional kilometre charges but did not consider market or other methods for responding to varying local congestion. Before the adoption of any system, it proposed broad trials to establish the technical viability of taxing road use, its enforceability and the protection of privacy.|$|E
50|$|An {{analysis}} in The Times {{says that the}} study concludes that the UK's transport network is broadly adequate, connecting the right places, so {{the government does not}} need to worry about <b>building</b> <b>new</b> <b>infrastructure</b> such as high-speed rail links and cross-country motorways, but should instead concentrate on improving existing road and rail networks. That there are key points in the existing network at which pressure has to be eased. That parts of the network that are vital to economic success should receive investment and that congested and growing cities should be prioritised, as should inter-urban corridors and ports and airports. Their full cost to the environment, including their contribution to climate change, should be paid by all modes of transport. It states also that Sir Rod supports the gradual introduction of road pricing when there is political support for it, and that reformation of the planning system is required to speed up the building of infrastructure projects.|$|E
40|$|Intelligent Transportation Systems aim at facilitating {{transportation}} by utilizing {{technological advances}} in communications, computing and electronic sensors technologies. The increasing demand for mobility of persons and freights {{has led to}} severe problems related to transportations, such as traffic congestions. Traffic congestions are the cause of environmental problems, economical damages, accidents and also they affect negatively our everyday life. However, <b>building</b> <b>new</b> <b>infrastructures</b> in order to match {{the increasing number of}} vehicles and transportation demands is highly costly. Therefore, traffic management applications of Intelligent Transportation Systems, which can utilize more efficiently the existing infrastructures, have attracted attention from the research community. Most of the existing traffic management systems use a network of fixed sensors for monitoring vehicles. One major drawback, preventing their expansion throughout the road network, is their high cost of deployment and maintenance. ...|$|R

30|$|For <b>building</b> <b>new</b> <b>infrastructure,</b> Germany has rather strict {{regulations}} regarding environmental protection. Furthermore, a {{participation of}} the citizens {{as well as of}} many Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in the planning process is required [17].

The counterfactual exercise shows that forced unbundling regulation leads to a 24 % decrease {{in the incidence of}} new infrastructure builders. This suggests, therefore, that when a new technology is being diffused, regulation to remove a natural monopoly conversely involves risks that regulated monopolists' shares will increase...|$|E

In Spain transport is by road in 90 % of private travel and 80 % of merchandise. The question to be asked is why should roads be free when other means of transport are not.

40|$|Maintaining and <b>building</b> <b>new</b> <b>infrastructure</b> that {{delivers}} agglomerative benefits {{is crucial for}} promoting sustainable economic growth. Capital needs for infrastructure investment are massive. This capital could be sourced especially from pension funds and other institutional investors for whom infrastructure funds are attractive investment vehicles. But in order to mobilise such private capital, the public sector needs to provide the right framework, e. g. by promoting a “Regulated Asset Base” model to improve capital expenditure, by avoiding undue solvency rules and other regulatory obstacles to long-term investment, and by closing the knowledge gap with regard to infrastructure investments. Governments should also avoid crowding out private sector investment, confining interventions to projects where public risk sharing is necessary, and refrain from making frequent short-term changes to the regulatory framework. ...|$|E

40|$|Along {{the last}} century, the casting in the {{transport}} sector was apparently clear between private actors and the public sector. For instance, public authorities were generally in charge of financing and <b>building</b> <b>new</b> <b>infrastructures.</b> Nevertheless, an inflexion was observed during the nineties with a significant development of public-private partnership (PPP). This paper deals with the new {{issues raised by the}} PPP system or, more generally, by any system in which the <b>new</b> <b>infrastructure</b> is partially financed by its users. Is there, in this case, a new economic rationality of public authorities? Particularly, is there an optimal way to rank projects? Before proposing some answers to these questions, we briefly present a historical perspective of this new trend, showing that there is a paradox. After this, we calculate the amount of subsidies needed to transform any project into a profitable project. We then show that, when public subsidies are reduced, the priority of a given project is not adequately given by its Socio Economic Internal Rate of Return (IRRse), but by a combination of its Socio Economic Net Present Value and the amount of subsidies it needs to become profitable. We demonstrate the relevance of our criterion by optimization algorithms previously developed for physical systems...|$|R
