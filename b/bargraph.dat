40|$|<b>Bargraphs</b> are {{a special}} class of convex polyominoes. They can be {{identified}} with lattice paths with unit steps north, east, and south that start at the origin, end on the x-axis, and stay strictly above the x-axis everywhere except at the endpoints. <b>Bargraphs,</b> which are used to represent histograms and to model polymers in statistical physics, have been enumerated in the literature by semiperimeter and by several other statistics, using different methods such as the wasp-waist decomposition of Bousquet-Mélou and Rechnitzer, and a bijection with certain Motzkin paths. In this paper we describe an unusual bijection between <b>bargraphs</b> and Dyck paths, and study how some statistics are mapped by the bijection. As a consequence, we obtain a new interpretation of Catalan numbers, as counting <b>bargraphs</b> where the semiperimeter minus the number of peaks is fixed...|$|R

40|$|Modern {{automotive}} {{instrument panels}} are often equipped with numeric readout and digital <b>bargraph</b> displays instead of traditional analog displays. An informal survey of 1990 model cars revealed wide disparity in automotive displays. Three major classes of displays were in use: (1) traditional analog, (2) binary indicators, and (3) readout displays. The present work reports results from four experiments of display monitorability. Twelve computer-simulated displays {{were designed for}} evaluation by dual-task methodology. Subjects were required to maintain performance on a demanding tracking task while monitoring configurations of four-displays for "critical readings. " Subjects' latencies to respond to such readings and their tracking error scores were collected. Experiment 1 examined displays in homogeneous clusters. Orientation, configuration and class were studied. Experiment 2 compared displays in heterogeneous configurations. Experiment 3 studied the addition of color to the displays to facilitate the detection of a critical reading. Static color (i. e., a "red zone") {{was added to the}} analog displays while dynamic color was added to the <b>bargraph</b> displays. Finally, Experiment 4 examined the effect of check-readable layouts for analog and <b>bargraph</b> displays. Older subjects were slower to respond to all displays and exhibited poorer tracking performance. They also had more variability than younger subjects on both of these measures. This result was likely due to age-related slowing rather than changes in cognitive processes. No class of displays studied emerged as superior, but the binary indicator (a modified warning lamp) generated the fastest responses. Although no evidence was found for effects of orientation, configuration or check-readability, support was found for color facilitation. Male subjects tended to respond faster when static color was present, and age-related facilitation was found for dynamic color. The addition of dynamic color to displays monitored by subjects in the middle and older age groups approximately compensated for age-related RT decrements. It is likely that displays which incorporate dynamic color elements will be most useful for presenting rate information as well as calling attention to off-normal readings. Pending further study, it is recommended that designers use new display technology with caution...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we report the first {{application}} of the Steady State Probe Topography (SSPT) neuroimaging technique (Silberstein, 1992) {{to the design of}} configural displays for continuous monitoring tasks. Two studies replicated and extended the performance results of Buttigieg and Sanderson (1991) in which high-level system constraints that subjects had to monitor were either well-mapped or poorly mapped to visual emergent features of digital, <b>bargraph,</b> or shape displays. SSPT results for poorly-mapped displays all showed prefrontal excitation indicative of high mental workload and lateralization of excitation, regardless of the kind of display. However, SSPT results for well-mapped displays showed less prefrontal involvement the more directly the constraint being monitored was represented in the display. The display supporting best performance showed no prefrontal involvement at all, but instead involvement of areas associated with form perception and visual attention, indicating a low-workload perceptual strategy. We interpret these results in the context of recent work on ecological display design and indicate future directions for neuroimaging studies of human interaction with dynamic systems...|$|E
