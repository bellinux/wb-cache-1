May, however, regards Bertie as very much of a joke, and {{is in love with}} Jack Mace, who is her ideal of manly beauty. May's father has no objection to Jack personally, but he does not propose that the daughter he idolizes shall wed a weakling or a ne'er do well. Therefore, he tells May in a letter that if 'that young man wants to marry you, he must show his ability by earning his own living during vacation.' Unfortunately for Bertie, he sees the letter, and egotistically jumps to the conclusion that he is the person referred to. He starts out to make his own living, but soon finds that it is not as easy as it sounds. He is successfully a writer, a <b>billposter,</b> a village constable, and a living target in the baseball show, but fails to shine in any one sphere. And then to cap the climax, when he returns to claim his bride, he finds that May is married to Jack." ...|$|E

The poster was intended as a jibe to the infamous cost overruns and alleged overly elaborate design of the Parliament building, which the Conservatives opposed.|$|E
5000|$|The Emperor seeks a bride {{who will}} marry him [...] "for himself alone," [...] so he despatches an English skipper, {{who has been}} {{promoted}} to the post of Lord High Admiral of the Chinese fleet, in search of such a woman. But the conditions are rather hard, for the high position of the Emperor is withheld, and the unlucky admiral has to pretend that he represents a <b>billposter.</b> The admiral returns from his quest without success. As a lingering death is the penalty of his failure it need hardly be said that he resorts {{to all sorts of}} expedients to avert the punishment. Some comical effects are obtained by making the abnormally tall Emperor think that he is betrothed to a diminutive [...] "slavey" [...] maid-of-all-work. To these ingredients add a cockney tradesman married to a jealous wife who insists upon her four bridesmaids travelling with her for detective and protective purposes, a pair of young lovers, and quaint (even if imaginary) Chinese customs.|$|E

A surviving film still appears to show Russell in the role of Jack at the climax of the film in which Bertie encounters the newly married couple. The other cast credits are unknown, but many Thanhouser productions are fragmentary. In late 1910, the Thanhouser company released a list of the important personalities in their films. The list includes G.W. Abbe, Justus D. Barnes, Frank H. Crane, Irene Crane, Marie Eline, Violet Heming, Martin J. Faust, Thomas Fortune, George Middleton, Grace Moore, John W. Noble, Anna Rosemond, Mrs. George Walters. The scenario was written by Lloyd F. Lonergan and the character of Bertie may have been based on Edwin Thanhouser's role of Bertie Nizril from Thoroughbred. The play was a three-act comedy by Ralph Lumley and was first produced on February 13, 1895. The play would come to the Garrick Theatre in New York City on August 17, 1896 and Edwin Thanhouser took over the role on August 29, 1896. A series of Bertie films was projected, but only this work was produced. Two other announced works included Bertie's Bride and Bertie's Baby.|$|E

However, it wasn’t just actors and actresses {{that came out in}} support of the AEA. Five million trade unionists around the country officially supported the strike. The Teamster Union of Chauffeurs, Stable Men and Helpers refused to deliver to managers that opposed the AEA. The International Alliance of <b>Billposters</b> and Billers of the United States and Canada refused to post bills for theaters with anti-Equity managers. [...] On September 2, 1919, the New York Times announced that the “Stagehands Now Run the Strike”, after stagehands and musicians in Boston and New York walked out to support the strike. Their absence forced six Boston theaters to shut their doors.|$|R
