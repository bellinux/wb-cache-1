40|$|Background: Nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB), proinflammatory cytokines and {{intercellular}} {{adhesion molecule}} 1 (ICAM- 1) are frequently upregulated in the <b>injured</b> <b>brain</b> after {{traumatic brain injury}} (TBI). However, the temporal pattern of upregulation is not well defined. Aims: The current study was undertaken to investigate the temporal profile of the expression of NF-kB, proinflammatory cytokines and ICAM- 1 in the <b>injured</b> <b>brain</b> after cortical contusion trauma of the rat brain. Settings and Design: A rat model of cortical contusion was produced by a free-falling weight on the exposed dura of right parietal lobe. The rats were randomly divided into control group and TBI groups at hours 3, 12, 24 and 72, and on day 7. Material and Methods: NF-kB binding activity in the surrounding <b>brain</b> of <b>injured</b> area was studied by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). The levels of TNF-a and IL- 6 were detected using ELISA and ICAM- 1 expression studied by immunohistochemistry. Statistical analysis: The data were analyzed by one-way ANOVA followed by Student-Newman-Keuls post hoc test. Relation between variables was analyzed using bivariate correlation with two-tailed test. Results: Compared with that of control group, NF-kB binding activity in the <b>injured</b> <b>brain</b> was significantly increased through 12 h and 7 days postinjury, with the maximum at 72 h. The concentrations of TNF-a and IL- 6 in the <b>injured</b> <b>brain</b> were significantly increased from 3 h to 7 days and maximal at 24 h postinjury. The number of ICAM- 1 immunostained microvessels was significantly increased in the <b>injured</b> <b>brain</b> from 24 h to 7 days postinjury, with its peak at 72 h. Concomitant upregulation of TNF-a, IL- 6, ICAM- 1 and the cytokine mediators NF-kB in the <b>injured</b> <b>brain</b> was observed in the <b>injured</b> <b>brain</b> after cortical contusion, {{and there was a}} highly positive relation among these variables. Conclusions: Cortical contusion trauma could induce a concomitant and persistent upregulation of NF-kB binding activity, TNF-a, IL- 6 and ICAM- 1 in the <b>injured</b> rat <b>brain</b> which might {{play a central role in}} the injury-induced immune response of brain. </u...|$|R

Various other theories regarding gestural deficits of aphasics have been put forward since then, including intellectual degradation, and the inability to carry out pretended actions.

2500|$|Age {{influences}} {{the risk for}} PTS. [...] As age increases, risk of early and late seizures decreases; {{one study found that}} early PTS occurred in 30.8% of children age 7 or under, 20% of children between ages 8 and 16, and 8.4% of people who were over 16 at the time they were injured (graph at right). Early seizures occur up to twice as frequently in <b>brain</b> <b>injured</b> children as they do in their adult counterparts. [...] In one study, children under five with trivial brain injuries (those with no LOC, no PTA, no depressed skull fracture, and no hemorrhage) suffered an early seizure 17% of the time, while people over age5 did so only 2% of the time. Children under age five also have seizures within one hour of injury more often than adults do. [...] One study found the incidence of early seizures to be highest among infants younger than oneyear and particularly high among those who suffered perinatal injury. However, adults are at higher risk than children are for late seizures. People over age65 are also at greater risk for developing PTS after an injury, with a PTS risk that is 2.5 times higher than that of their younger counterparts.|$|E
2500|$|Priming {{effects can}} be found {{with many of the}} tests of {{implicit}} memory. Tests such as the word-stem completion task, and the word fragment completion task measure perceptual priming. In the word-stem completion task, participants are given a list of study words, and then asked to complete word [...] "stems" [...] consisting of 3 letters with the first word that comes to mind. A priming effect is observed when participants complete stems with words on the study list more often than with novel words. The word fragment completion task is similar, but instead of being given the stem of a word, participants are given a word with some letters missing. The lexical decision task can be used to demonstrate conceptual priming. In this task, participants are asked to determine if a given string is a word or a nonword. Priming is demonstrated when participants are quicker to respond to words that have been primed with semantically-related words, e.g., faster to confirm [...] "nurse" [...] as a word when it is preceded by [...] "doctor" [...] than when it is preceded by [...] "butter". Other evidence has been found through brain imaging and studies from <b>brain</b> <b>injured</b> patients. Another example of priming in healthcare research was studying if safety behaviors of nurses could be primed by structuring change of shift report. A pilot simulation study found that there is early evidence to show that safety behaviors can be primed by including safety language into report.|$|E

40|$|With over 50, 000 {{deaths and}} 80, 000 {{disorders}} {{annually in the}} United States resulting from traumatic brain injury (TBI), there is a demand for improved therapeutic strategies. Cell transplantation offers the potential to treat TBI by targeting multiple mechanisms in a sustained fashion. However, efforts are needed to improve survival and integration of transplanted cells, and ultimately enhance functional recovery. Using tissue engineering strategies, we aimed to mimic key aspects of fetal tissue grafts by combining neural stem cells with a fibronectin or laminin based scaffold that could be delivered to the <b>injured</b> <b>brain</b> in a minimally invasive fashion. We found that the incorporation of extracellular matrix proteins into a cell transplantation paradigm led to improved donor cell survival and restored cognitive ability for treated animals. To begin to examine how fibronectin and laminin mediate these improvements, we first examined the endogenous role of these two proteins in the <b>injured</b> <b>brain.</b> Using a clinically-relevant model of TBI, we found both proteins are increased in the <b>injured</b> <b>brain</b> at acute time points. The spatial localization of fibronectin and laminin with specific support cells in the brain suggests a role for these proteins in repair, warranting further investigation. Using conditional plasma fibronectin knockout animals, we found that fibronectin is neuroprotective to the traumatically <b>injured</b> <b>brain.</b> Specifically, <b>injured</b> fibronectin knockout animals had more severe motor and cognitive deficits, increased cell death, and decreased retention of phagocytic cells compared to injured wild type animals. Thus, we have identified novel therapeutic treatments for TBI which utilize tissue engineered transplants and/or exploit endogenous repair mechanisms for fibronectin. Ph. D.

40|$|Background: Traumatic {{injury to}} {{the central nervous system}} (CNS) {{triggers}} a robust inflammatory response that leads to axonal damage and secondary degeneration of spared tissue. In contrast, some immune responses have neuroprotective effects. However, detailed information regarding the dynamics of immune responses after traumatic CNS injury is still unavailable. Methods: In the present study, changes in the immune cells present in the <b>injured</b> <b>brain,</b> spleen, and cervical lymph nodes (CLNs), which are draining lymphatic organs from the CNS, were analyzed after controlled cortical impact (CCI) by flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry. Results: The number of neutrophils and macrophages that infiltrated the <b>injured</b> <b>brain</b> immediately increased 1 d post-injury and declined rapidly thereafter. In the <b>injured</b> <b>brain,</b> resident microglia showed a bimodal increase during the first week and in the chronic phase ($ 3 weeks) after injury.

Furthermore, CD 86 +/CD 11 b+ M 1 -like microglia increased at 4 weeks after CCI, whereas CD 206 +/CD 11 b+ M 2 -like microglia increased at 1 week.

40|$|Traumatic {{brain injury}} (TBI) or brain surgery may cause {{extensive}} loss of cerebral parenchyma. However, no strategy for reconstruction has been clinically effective. Our previous study {{had shown that}} self-assembling peptide nanofiber scaffold (SAPNS) can bridge the injured spinal cord, elicit axon regeneration, and eventually promote locomotor functional recovery. In the present study we investigated the effect of SAPNS for the reconstruction of acutely <b>injured</b> <b>brain.</b> The lesion cavity of the injured cortex was filled with SAPNS or saline immediately after surgically induced TBI, and the rats were killed 2 days, 2 weeks, or 6 weeks after the surgery for histology, immunohistochemistry, and TUNEL studies. Saline treatment in the control animals resulted in a large cavity in the <b>injured</b> <b>brain,</b> whereas no cavity of any significant size {{was found in the}} SAPNS-treated animals. Around the lesion site in control animals were many macrophages (ED 1 positive) but few TUNEL-positive cells, indicating that the TBI caused secondary tissue loss mainly by means of necrosis, not apoptosis. In the SAPNS-treated animals the graft of SAPNS integrated well with the host tissue with no obvious gaps. Moreover, there were fewer astrocytes (GFAP positive) and macrophages (ED 1 positive) around the lesion site in the SAPNS-treated animals than were found in the controls. Thus, SAPNS may help to reconstruct the acutely <b>injured</b> <b>brain</b> and reduce the glial reaction and inflammation in the surrounding brain tissue. From the Clinical Editor: Self-assembling peptide nanofiber scaffold (SAPNS) was reported earlier to bridge the injured spinal cord, elicit axon regeneration, and promote locomotor recovery.

40|$|ObjectiveTo {{explore the}} role and {{function}} of stromal cell-derived factor- 1 (SDF- 1) in stem cells migrating into <b>injured</b> <b>brain</b> area. MethodsRat-derived nerve stem cells (NSCs) were isolated and cultured routinely. Transwell system was used to observe the migration ability of NSCs into injured nerve cells. Immunocytochemistry was used to explore the expression of chemotactic factor receptor- 4 (CXCR- 4) in NSCs. In vivo, we applied immunofluorescence technique to observe the migration of NSCs into <b>injured</b> <b>brain</b> area. Immunofluo-rescence technique and Western blotting were used to test expression level of SDF- 1. After AMD 3100 (a special chemical blocker) blocking CXCR- 4, the migration ability of NSCs was tested in vivo and in vitro, respectively. ResultsNSCs displayed specific tropism for injured nerve cells or traumatic brain area in vivo and in vitro. The expression level of SDF- 1 in traumatic brain area increased remarkably and the expression level of CXCR- 4 in the NSCs increased simultaneously. After AMD 3100 blocking the expression of CXCR- 4, the migration ability of NSCs decreased significantly both in vivo and in vitro.

40|$|Here, {{we report}} that a unique {{mechanism}} of action exerted by stem cells in the repair of the traumatically <b>injured</b> <b>brain</b> involves their ability to harness a biobridge between neurogenic niche and <b>injured</b> <b>brain</b> site. This biobridge, visualized immunohistochemically and laser captured, corresponded to an area between the neurogenic subventricular zone and the injured cortex. That the biobridge expressed high levels of extracellular matrix metalloproteinases characterized initially by a stream of transplanted stem cells, but subsequently contained only few to non-detectable grafts and overgrown by newly formed host cells, implicates a novel property of stem cells. The transplanted stem cells manifest themselves as pathways for trafficking the migration of host neurogenic cells, but once this biobridge is formed between the neurogenic site and the <b>injured</b> <b>brain</b> site, the grafted cells disappear and relinquish their task to the host neurogenic cells. Our findings reveal that long-distance migration of host cells from the neurogenic niche to the <b>injured</b> <b>brain</b> site can be achieved through transplanted stem cells serving as biobridges for initiation of endogenous repair mechanisms. This is the first report of a stem cell-paved "biobridge". Indeed, to date the two major schools of discipline in stem cell repair mechanism primarily support the concept of "cell replacement" and bystander effects of "trophic factor secretion". The present novel observations of a stem cell seducing a host cell to engage in brain repair advances basic science concepts on stem cell biology and extracellular matrix, as well as provokes translational research on propagating this stem cell-paved biobridge beyond cell replacement and trophic factor secretion {{for the treatment of}} traumatic brain injury and other neurological disorders...|$|R
