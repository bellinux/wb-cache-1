25|$|A {{great number}} of proverbs and sayings have {{developed}} around the activity of eating. From the innocent child's thank you: Săru-mâna pentru masă, c-a fost bună şi gustoasă, şi bucătăreasa frumoasa ("Thank you for the meal, it was good and tasty, and the cook was beautiful"), to the more philosophical Mulţumescu-ţi ţie Doamne, c-am mâncat şi iar mi-e foame ("Thank you Lord, for I have eaten, but I am hungry again"), Dragostea trece prin stomac ("Love passes through the stomach"), the simple Pofta vine mâncănd ("Appetite comes while eating"), the sarcastic Porcul mănâncă orice, dar se-ngraşă pentru alţii ("The pig would eat anything <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>gets</b> fat for others"), or the expression of total fulfillment, Mâncat bine, băut bine, dimineaţa sculat mort ("Ate well, drank well, in the morning woke up dead").|$|E
25|$|By simply {{observing the}} stem of one H. physophora individual, we see the complex {{interactions}} between four different species: an ant, a plant, a fungus, and an assassin bug, {{as well as all}} of the prey that lands on the plant. The plant gives a little of its own resources to the predators, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>gets</b> two forms of defense against herbivores and parasitic plants. To the plant, this defense is worth much more than the loss of some food. The plant has maximized its own fitness by establishing two separate and independent relationships that are not very costly but very rewarding. The insects both benefit as well, given a safe habitat and a steady food supply of other insects that land on the prey. In the perspective of A. decemarticulatus, they do not actively give any of their own resources to the plant or to the assassin bug. They simply live among them, use their resources, and hunt.|$|E

500|$|Thom Jerek of Allmusic {{said the}} song had [...] "a clever, if {{somewhat}} cloying, tune, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>gets</b> the feeling across in spades." [...] The A.V. Club reviewer Steven Hyden claims that Church [...] "is {{just as effective}} on slower, more thoughtful songs like [...] "Springsteen" [...] and that the song [...] " [...] reflecting on music’s power to revive forgotten emotions from the past." [...] Bruce Springsteen himself took note of Church's music, specifically the song [...] "Springsteen", and wrote Church {{a note on the}} back of a setlist. Church received the letter from Springsteen's after a show on August 19, 2012. In the note, Springsteen explained his and his family's love of the song and that he hoped to have their paths cross at some point. Church was surprised when receiving the note and said that [...] "it’s a long note, takes up the entire back page of this setlist for a show that lasted three hours and 47 minutes." ...|$|E
500|$|James Poniewozik of Time observed, [...] "NBC's public {{troubles}} {{have been}} 30 Rocks greatest blessing this season, providing it with satiric fodder from The Jay Leno Show to the Comcast acquisition. The show {{may not be}} the best sitcom on TV now, but it's definitely the best work of NBC-criticism." [...] In regards to the main plot, he said it [...] "could have done even more with the premise of the Jaypocalypse re-enacted with janitors, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>gets</b> a lot of credit for the inspired idea." [...] IGN contributor Robert Canning gave the episode an 8.3 out of 10 rating, writing that the janitor plot [...] "came at a perfect time" [...] in regards to the Leno and O'Brien controversy. He, however, did not like the other two plots, noting they were [...] "less impressive". Meredith Blake from the Los Angeles Times said that the Khonani and Subhas plot was [...] "supremely clever and self-referential", and that the show's take on it was [...] "decidedly neutral, albeit very funny".|$|E
500|$|Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club {{awarded the}} episode a [...] "C". He {{called it a}} [...] "hodge-podge of various {{elements}} that have {{worked in the past}} but feel beyond tired now". He was largely critical of the episode's story, which he felt was a rip-off of The Insider, as well as the make-up effects for the episode, which he called [...] "fairly fake" [...] looking. VanDerWerff, however, was complimentary towards Tobin Bell's performance, calling him [...] "charismatic and interesting", as well as the fact that he plays [...] "a great schemer". Rich Rosell from DigitallyObsessed.com awarded the episode 3 out of 5 stars and wrote [...] "Tobacco beetles, dismembered noses and some really bad second-hand smoke permeate this installment, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>gets</b> snuffed out with a lazy payoff." [...] Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode two-and-a-half stars out of five. Despite praising the plot, writing [...] "it's a great premise, with lots of gore and larvae", the two lament its loss in direction: [...] "halfway through, once the episode reveals what its concept is, the story is left with nowhere to go." ...|$|E

500|$|Like most Disney heroines, Meg sings {{about the}} {{experience}} of {{falling in love with}} the film's hero. Recognized as Meg's signature song, [...] "I Won't Say (I'm in Love)" [...] has been identified as the character's [...] "big moment of romantic realization" [...] in Hercules. Prior to [...] "I Won't Say (I'm in Love)", the audience has only been exposed to Meg's cynicism; the song finally reveals that Meg's cynicism is actually a reaction to her romantic side, uncovering the [...] "misunderstood nature" [...] of the character. [...] "I Won't Say (I'm in Love)" [...] reveals that the Meg has fallen in love too fast before, and explains that she is afraid of repeating the same mistake once more with Hercules. Despite her best efforts, the character realizes that she has in fact begun to develop feelings for Hercules much to her chagrin, but at first refuses to admit this; the song allows Meg to [...] "work through her denial", by [...] "alternating between fantasizing about how delightful it would be to be loved by Herc, and stomping her foot in anger at the very thought." [...] Resembling an [...] "admonishing" [...] exchange between Meg and the Muses, [...] "I Won't Say (I'm in Love)" [...] is Meg's attempt to avoid the clichéd storylines of her predecessors. Finally, after strolling a Greek courtyard while performing the song accompanied by the Muses who insist she is in denial, the character's resistance eventually proves futile and she ultimately relents. According to Taylor Weatherby of Billboard, the character [...] "finally comes to a conclusion to which many a girl (or guy) can relate". Tracy Dye of Bustle described the scene: [...] "Joined by The Muses, Meg attempts to vehemently deny her amour for Hercules". Writing for film critic Eric D. Snider's website, Kimber Kay joked that Meg [...] "tries her best to give a top 40 rendition of her solo song, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>gets</b> stolen by the magnificent Muses." [...] Additionally, the musical number predicts that one of Hercules' most difficult challenges will be trying to change Meg's opinion of him. Writing for The Daily Dot, Aja Romano cited the song as Meg's [...] "I Want" [...] song.|$|E
