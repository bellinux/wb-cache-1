5|$|Dietrich's other {{argument}} {{was that the}} trial judge should have used discretionary powers and granted an adjournment until Dietrich was able to provide counsel himself, and that the {{failure to do so}} caused a miscarriage of justice. Dietrich had asked the trial judge for an adjournment during the trial, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>judge</b> said that since more than a year had passed since the offence occurred, it was {{in the interests of the}} community that the matter be dealt with promptly.|$|E
5|$|Forensic {{evidence}} on the package eventually leads to Bardale, and then to The Judge. The Judge is arrested for questioning, and knowing {{that there is not}} enough evidence to warrant sentencing him, he offers Black a job with him. Black refuses, <b>but</b> <b>The</b> <b>Judge</b> is released. Bardale is incensed that The Judge has manipulated the law to his own ends, and passes sentence on him for hypocrisy. Finding Bardale alone in a farmhouse, Black discovers that the convict had fed The Judge to his pigs.|$|E
5|$|O'Neal {{played in}} two more games before the NBA's case was {{brought before the}} U.S. District Court in Brooklyn, New York on December 30. The NBA argued that {{under the terms of}} the Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA), Stern had {{absolute}} authority to hand out suspensions and hear appeals for all on-court incidents. <b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>judge</b> ruled that because O'Neal's behavior was an off-court incident, arbitration was allowed under the CBA, and thus the arbitrator was within his rights to reduce the suspension. Despite O'Neal's successful appeal, no further appeals were made to reduce Artest's and Jackson's suspensions.|$|E

5|$|Under {{the terms}} of its {{contract}} with the city, the company could not cease operations. A lawsuit was brought by a pro-union citizen of the city, A. C. Pearson, against the company to revoke its contract or to force it into receivership so a receiver could negotiate with the strikers. The first court hearing was held on November 4, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>judge</b> put the case on hold until the strike could be resolved. The case was later annulled on November 7 when the same judge ruled that Pearson had no standing to bring such a suit before the court.|$|E
5|$|Without {{leaving the}} jury box, the jurors found Berkman guilty on all charges. The judge gave Berkman the maximum {{sentence}} for each count: {{a total of}} 21years in prison and one year in the workhouse, to be served consecutively. Berkman argued that he should only be sentenced for the attempt on Frick's life, that the other charges were elements of the main crime of assault {{with the intent to}} kill, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>judge</b> overruled his objection. In four hours, Berkman had been tried, convicted, and sentenced. He was brought to serve his sentence at Pennsylvania's Western Penitentiary.|$|E
5|$|Evidence against Croitoru and Gravelle was {{presented}} {{over the course}} of eight weeks in 2006, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>judge</b> stated that the case against the two accused was not strong. Ontario Attorney General Michael Bryant withdrew the charges on June 12, 2006. Following this action by the attorney general, both Croitoru and Andre Gravelle announced plans to file lawsuits against people involved with the prosecution. Gravelle is suing for $25 million, and Croitoru is seeking $15 million for wrongful imprisonment and malicious prosecution. Hamilton Police Services was ordered to pay Gravelle $10,000 for court costs. In June 2006, Croitoru also pleaded guilty to the charges of extortion and violating the terms of his bail. As a result, he was forced to forfeit $10,000 of the bail money.|$|E

5|$|On April 1, {{the defense}} {{asked for the}} new trial to be moved outside Brownsville, {{claiming}} their client had received unfair treatment {{in the media and}} there was no chance for her to have a fair trial and an unbiased jury. The request included large numbers of magazines and newspaper articles published since 1993. It did not cite any specific passages where the alleged media bias was demonstrated. The defense also filed a motion to throw out the new indictment {{on the grounds that it}} was double jeopardy. On April 27, the judge decided to postpone his decision about where to hold the trial. He also rejected the defense motion stating that the new indictment was a case of double jeopardy. The defense argued that the prosecution had illegally used Brownsville and Houston grand juries to work on the case, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>judge</b> countered that claim saying only the Houston grand jury had handled the case. On May 4, the trial was moved from Brownsville to Houston, Texas, because of the earlier extensive media coverage.|$|E

25|$|In 1919, Luisa Capetillo {{challenged}} mainstream {{society by}} {{becoming the first}} woman in Puerto Rico to wear trousers in public. Capetillo was sent to jail for what was then {{considered to be a}} crime, <b>but,</b> <b>the</b> <b>judge</b> later dropped the charges against her.|$|E

25|$|The {{suspected}} shooters {{were later}} identified as Phin Clanton, Ike Clanton, Johnny Barnes, Johnny Ringo, Hank Swilling and Pete Spence. On Tuesday, January 31, 1882 Ike and Phin were brought before Judge William H. Stilwell {{on suspicion of}} shooting Virgil. The district attorney asked that bail be set at $5,000, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>judge</b> released both men on $1,500 bond, indicating he thought the prosecution's case was weak.|$|E
25|$|The {{case was}} first {{returned}} to the lower court and the judge allowed a change of venue, moving the retrials to Decatur, Alabama. Judge Horton was appointed. During the retrials, one of the alleged victims admitted fabricating the rape story and asserted {{that none of the}} Scottsboro Boys touched either of the white women. The jury found the defendants guilty, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>judge</b> set aside the verdict and granted a new trial.|$|E
25|$|The {{use of the}} National Symbols (Coat of Arms, Anthem, and National Flag) in Mexico is {{protected}} by law. In Mexico the desecration of the flag is illegal. Although punishment is not sought often and are usually not harsh, {{there are a few}} instances; for example, in 2008 a federal judge convicted an individual for 'desecrating the flag' in a poem. The ministry that oversees the use of national symbols requested four years in jail, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>judge</b> only issued a small fine and a public warning.|$|E

25|$|When Straffen's {{murder trial}} opened on 21 July, he pleaded not guilty, and the defence opted {{to leave the}} {{question}} of his sanity as an issue {{to be determined by}} the jury. After the prosecution case (led by the Solicitor-General, Sir Reginald Manningham-Buller) had opened and called the first witnesses to establish the facts about the murder of Linda Bowyer, they applied to call additional evidence about the two murders in Bath. This application was resisted by Straffen's defence as prejudicial, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>judge</b> ruled the evidence admissible.|$|E
25|$|Chamlee moved for new {{trials for}} all defendants. Private {{investigations}} took place, revealing that Price and Bates had been prostitutes in Tennessee, who regularly serviced {{both black and}} white clientele. Chamlee offered judge Hawkins affidavits to that effect, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>judge</b> forbade him to read them out loud. The defense argued that this evidence proved that the two women had likely lied at trial. Chamlee pointed to the uproar in Scottsboro that occurred when the verdicts were reported as further evidence that the change of venue should have been granted.|$|E
25|$|During the Almohad persecution, the Jewish philosopher Maimonides {{wrote his}} Epistle on Apostasy, {{in which he}} {{permitted}} Jews to feign apostasy under duress, though strongly recommending leaving the country instead. There is dispute amongst scholars as to whether Maimonides himself converted to Islam in order to freely escape from Almohad territory, and then reconverted back to Judaism in either the Levant or in Egypt. He was later denounced as an apostate and tried in an Islamic court, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>judge</b> ruled that his conversion had been forced and therefore invalid.|$|E
