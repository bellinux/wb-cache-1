5|$|In 1996, Dodson raised two {{objections}} to Horner's hypothesis. Firstly, {{the possession of}} just one pair of main spikes seemed more basal than the presence of three pairs, as with Styracosaurus albertensis. This suggested {{to him that the}} Einiosaurus-Achelousaurus lineage was a separate branch within the Centrosaurinae. Secondly, he was concerned that Einiosaurus and Achelousaurus were a case of sexual dimorphism, one type being the males, the other the females. This would <b>be</b> <b>suggested</b> by the short geological time interval between the layers their fossils had been found in, which was estimated by him at about 250,000 years. But if the hypothesis were true, it would be perhaps the best example of fast evolution in the Dinosauria.|$|E
5|$|The Iron Age {{tribes of}} later Somerset were the Dobunni in north Somerset, Durotriges in south Somerset and Dumnonii in west Somerset. The {{first and second}} {{produced}} coins, the finds of which allows their tribal areas to <b>be</b> <b>suggested,</b> but the latter did not. All three had a Celtic culture and language. However, Ptolemy stated that Bath was in {{the territory of the}} Belgae, but this may be a mistake. The Celtic gods were worshipped at the temple of Sulis at Bath and possibly the temple on Brean Down. Iron Age sites on the Quantock Hills, include major hill forts at Dowsborough and Ruborough, as well as smaller earthwork enclosures, such as Trendle Ring, Elworthy Barrows and Plainsfield Camp.|$|E

25|$|The Higgs boson validates the Standard Model {{through the}} {{mechanism}} of mass generation. As more precise measurements of its properties are made, more advanced extensions may <b>be</b> <b>suggested</b> or excluded. As experimental means to measure the field's behaviours and interactions are developed, this fundamental field may be better understood. If the Higgs field had not been discovered, the Standard Model would have needed to be modified or superseded.|$|E

A 24-hour urine collection can be used to quantify daily protein loss (see proteinuria), urine output, creatinine clearance or electrolyte handling by the renal tubules.|$|E
25|$|In some of {{the larger}} Tudor style houses the Tudor great hall would <b>be</b> <b>suggested</b> by the {{reception}} hall, often furnished as a sitting or dining room. Large wooden staircases of several flights were often prominently positioned, based on Jacobean prototypes.

25|$|Since Leptictidium young {{were very}} {{vulnerable}} to attacks of predators, {{it is probable}} that they were born quite developed and that they became independent when they were still quite young. From the behavior of today's elephant shrew, the possibility can <b>be</b> <b>suggested</b> that Leptictidium young went out to hunt with their mother, and that they learned to distinguish prey by licking their mother's mouth when she had just caught an animal, in order to know the flavor of food.|$|E
25|$|Active {{surveillance}} is {{observation and}} regular monitoring without invasive treatment. In {{the context of}} prostate disease this usually comprises regular PSA blood tests and prostate biopsies. Active surveillance is often used when an early stage, slow-growing prostate cancer is suspected. However, watchful waiting may also <b>be</b> <b>suggested</b> when the risks of surgery, radiation therapy, or hormonal therapy outweigh the possible benefits. Other treatments can be started if symptoms develop, or if {{there are signs that}} the cancer growth is accelerating (e.g., rapidly rising PSA, increase in Gleason score on repeat biopsy, etc.).|$|E
25|$|The {{idea of an}} {{indigenous}} origin such as {{a connection to the}} Indus script is supported by some Western and Indian scholars and writers. The theory that there are similarities to the Indus script was suggested by early European scholars such as the Cambridge University archaeologist John Marshall and the Oxford University professor Stephen Langdon, and it continues to <b>be</b> <b>suggested</b> by scholars and writers such as (among others) the computer scientist Subhash Kak, the German Indologist Georg Feuerstein, the American teacher David Frawley, the British archaeologist Raymond Allchin, and the Cambridge University professor Jack Goody.|$|E

25|$|Electroconvulsive {{therapy is}} a {{controversial}} form of treatment which cannot be involuntarily applied in psychiatric emergency service settings. Instances wherein {{a patient is}} depressed to such a severe degree that the patient cannot be stopped from hurting himself or herself or when a patient refuses to swallow, eat or drink medication, electroconvulsive therapy could <b>be</b> <b>suggested</b> as a therapeutic alternative. While preliminary research suggests that electroconvulsive therapy may be an effective treatment for depression, it usually requires a course of six to twelve sessions of convulsions lasting at least 20 seconds for those antidepressant effects to occur.|$|E
25|$|It is {{generally}} agreed that {{the three types of}} material interspersed through the book – poetic, narrative, and biographical – come from different sources or circles. Authentic oracles of Jeremiah are probably {{to be found in the}} poetic sections of chapters 1–25, but the book as a whole has been heavily edited and added to by followers (including perhaps the prophet's companion, the scribe Baruch) and later generations of Deuteronomists. The date of the final versions of the book (Greek and Hebrew) can <b>be</b> <b>suggested</b> by the fact that the Greek shows concerns typical of the early Persian period, while the Masoretic (i.e., Hebrew) shows perspectives which, although known in the Persian period, did not reach their realisation until the 2nd century BCE.|$|E
25|$|The {{island state}} of Aegina was mainly {{active in the}} trade with Egypt, where its major {{competitor}} was Samos. Samos was allied with Chalcis, which suggests that Aegina took the side of Eretria. Corinth and Megara were at war for practically all of the Archaic period, {{primarily because of the}} Corinthian conquest of the Perachora peninsula which had originally belonged to Megara. The actions of Chalcis and Corinth in the context of western colonisation suggest that the two cities were allied, or at least friendly; Chalcis had prevented Megarian settlers from establishing themselves at Leontinoi, while Corinth had driven Eretrian settlers from Kerkyra. In analogy, a friendship between Megara and Eretria is assumed. Herodotus reports that Chios supported Miletus in the Ionian Revolt, because Miletus had previously assisted the Chiotes against Erythrai. Thus, based on the allegiance of Miletus, an alliance between Chios and Eretria, as well as one between Erythrai and Chalcis can <b>be</b> <b>suggested.</b>|$|E

25|$|Another {{version of}} {{formalism}} is often known as deductivism. In deductivism, the Pythagorean theorem {{is not an}} absolute truth, but a relative one: if one assigns meaning to the strings {{in such a way}} that the rules of the game become true (i.e., true statements are assigned to the axioms and the rules of inference are truth-preserving), then one must accept the theorem, or, rather, the interpretation one has given it must be a true statement. The same is held to be true for all other mathematical statements. Thus, formalism need not mean that mathematics is nothing more than a meaningless symbolic game. It is usually hoped that there exists some interpretation in which the rules of the game hold. (Compare this position to structuralism.) But it does allow the working mathematician to continue in his or her work and leave such problems to the philosopher or scientist. Many formalists would say that in practice, the axiom systems to be studied will <b>be</b> <b>suggested</b> by the demands of science or other areas of mathematics.|$|E
25|$|For some time, {{especially}} {{through the}} work of D. A. Binchy, the laws were held to be conservative and useful primarily for reconstructing the laws and customs of the Proto-Indo-Europeans just as linguists had reconstructed the Proto-Indo-European language. For instance, historians have seen similarities between Irish and Indian customs of fasting {{as a method of}} shaming a wrongdoer to recover a debt, or to demand the righting of a wrong. Other legal institutions prominent in early Irish law but foreign to most contemporary legal systems, {{such as the use of}} sureties, have been considered as survivals from earlier periods. More recently historians have come to doubt such attributions. While few historians argue that all Irish law comes from church influence, they are today much more wary as to what material is a survival and what has changed. A past may still <b>be</b> <b>suggested</b> for a certain legal concept based on Irish legal terms' being cognate with terms in other Celtic languages, although that information does not prove that the practice described by the legal term has not changed.|$|E
25|$|The {{depiction}} of the Earth conceived by Homer, which was accepted by the early Greeks, represents a circular flat disk surrounded by a constantly moving stream of Ocean, an idea which would <b>be</b> <b>suggested</b> {{by the appearance of}} the horizon as it is seen from a mountaintop or from a seacoast. Homer's knowledge of the Earth was very limited. He and his Greek contemporaries knew very little of the Earth beyond Egypt as far south as the Libyan desert, the south-west coast of Asia Minor, and the northern boundary of the Greek homeland. Furthermore, the coast of the Black Sea was only known through myths and legends that circulated during his time. In his poems {{there is no mention of}} Europe and Asia as geographical concepts. That is why the big part of Homer's world that is portrayed on this interpretive map represents lands that border on the Aegean Sea. It is worth noting that even though Greeks believed that they were in the middle of the earth, they also thought that the edges of the world's disk were inhabited by savage, monstrous barbarians and strange animals and monsters; Homer's Odyssey mentions a great many of them.|$|E
