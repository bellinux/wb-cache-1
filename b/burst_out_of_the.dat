25|$|Sometime after 1:00 pm on 26 June, Gambin {{organized}} and led a last-gasp charge which <b>burst</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> encirclement. The French managed {{to save their}} eagles and their one remaining cannon. As they withdrew, they met Marmont's relief column which was marching toward the sound of battle. Immediately, the XI Corps stormed into Graz, smashing down Austrian resistance and ejecting Gyulai's corps from the town. The attackers then ran amok, killing numbers of Austrian wounded and prisoners.|$|E
25|$|Tinamous have {{established}} {{themselves in the}} folklore and histories of the indigenous people of South America and Central America. Forest tribes of Brazil and Colombia believe the jaguar imitates {{the call of the}} great tinamou in order to track and eat it. A tale from the Guahibo Indians tells of a young man traveling by canoe who tried to locate a calling tinamou. As he approached the bank he became suspicious at the harshness of the call and backed away just as a jaguar <b>burst</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vegetation.|$|E
25|$|After some {{preliminary}} engagements at Campo Baccano and at Trevi, the Saracens were driven to their stronghold on the Garigliano. There, at the Battle of Garigliano, the allies proceeded to lay siege {{to them for}} three months, {{at the end of}} which the Saracens burnt their houses and attempted to <b>burst</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> encirclement. With John leading the way, all were eventually caught and killed, achieving a great victory and removing the ongoing Saracen threat on the Italian mainland. John then confirmed the granting of Traetto to the Duke of Gaeta, as a reward for abandoning his Saracen allies.|$|E

25|$|Liu Xiu {{carried out}} his action, {{and when he}} {{returned}} to Kunyang, he began harassing the sieging Xin forces from the outside. Wang Yi and Wang Xun, annoyed, led 10,000 men to attack Liu Xiu and ordered the rest of their troops not to move from their siege locations. Once they engaged in battle, however, after minor losses, the other units were hesitant to assist them, and Liu Xiu killed Wang Xun in battle. Once that happened, the Han forces inside Kunyang <b>burst</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city and attacked the other Xin units, and the much larger Xin forces suffered a total collapse. The soldiers largely deserted and went home, unable to be gathered again. Wang Yi had to withdraw with only several thousand men back to Luoyang. This was a major blow to Xin, psychologically; after this point on, there would be no hope for it.|$|E
25|$|The Doctor and Stark {{run down}} to the room where Rivesh and Seruba are, but find that Seruba is cradling Rivesh. She reveals that Azlok has mortally injured him and he is dying. However, Surbua says there was {{something}} in the ship that could revive him, but Stark says that anything found in the ship was stored in the Area 51 vault, which hasn't been entered for some time as something got loose in there. The Doctor, Cassie, Jimmy, Seruba and Stark arrive at the vault, and the Doctor asks Jimmy and Cassie to find the TARDIS back at Dry Springs. Inside the vault, the Doctor and Seruba go and look for the device they need. Meanwhile, in the Viperox lair Azlok gets the Viperox Queen to release her newly hatched brood, so that they will destroy the whole town. Back in the vault, the Doctor comes across a swarm of Skorpius Flies, a carnivorous alien species that form a group mind. Seruba tells the Doctor she has found the device that could revive Rivesh, but the Skorpius Flies chase after them until the Doctor finds a crate and hides inside. He helps Seruba escape inside the crate by working out how many steps he took on the way in. At the Area 51 base Stark is informed that they are getting reports of Viperox attacks. He orders a row of tanks to block the Viperox off. The Doctor and Seruba shuffle out of the vault inside the crate so the flies won't notice. Meanwhile, Cassie and Jimmy are driving along with the TARDIS on the back of Jimmy's pickup truck when the Viperox <b>burst</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ground into their path.|$|E
500|$|The first Saracen attack did {{not come}} until all the crusaders had left their camp and were moving towards Arsuf. [...] The Ayyubid army then <b>burst</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> woodland. The front of the army was {{composed}} of dense swarms of skirmishers, both horse and foot, Bedouin, Sudanese archers and the lighter types of Turkish horse archers. Behind these were the ordered squadrons of armoured heavy cavalry: Saladin's mamluks (also termed ghulams), Kurdish troops, and the contingents of the emirs and princes of Egypt, Syria and Mesopotamia. The army was divided into three parts, left and right wings and centre. Saladin directed his army from beneath his banners, surrounded by his bodyguard and accompanied by his kettle-drummers.|$|E

2500|$|Peter de Lamotte formed his {{division}} into square {{formation and}} began to retreat, followed by Bordesoulle. At {{some point during the}} withdrawal, the two Austrian mounted regiments were attacked by a large force of French cavalry and suffered 200 casualties in the melee. After Lamotte marched about [...] toward Donnemarie, Gérard's infantry <b>burst</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> woods and nearly broke up Lamotte's division. However, the French cavalry was absent this time, allowing the Bavarians to reform their battalions and resume their retreat. That evening, Wrede got the V Corps across the Seine at Bray, except for a rearguard at Mouy-sur-Seine.|$|E
2500|$|The {{archaeologist}} Marija Gimbutas {{based at}} least part of her Kurgan Hypothesis and Old European culture theories on these Cucuteni-Trypillia clay figurines. Her conclusions, which were always controversial, today are discredited by many scholars, but still there are some scholars who support her theories about how neolithic societies were matriarchal, non-warlike, and worshipped an [...] "earthy" [...] mother goddess, but were subsequently wiped out by invasions of patriarchal Indo-European tribes who <b>burst</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> steppes of Russia and Kazakhstan beginning around 2500 BC, and who worshipped a warlike Sky God. However, Gimbutas' theories have been partially discredited by more recent discoveries and analyses. Today there are many scholars who disagree with Gimbutas, pointing to new evidence that suggests a much more complex society during the Neolithic era than she had been accounting for.|$|E
2500|$|With {{less than}} a minute left in the third quarter, it {{appeared}} that this would become the first Super Bowl ever to go three quarters without either team scoring a touchdown. [...] But on the ensuing kickoff, Stanford Jennings received the ball at the 7-yard line, ran straight up the middle behind a wedge of blockers, and <b>burst</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pack into the open field. [...] 49ers receiver Terry Greer managed to chase him down and trip him up at the 1, but he still fell into the end zone for a 93-yard touchdown return, giving the Bengals a 13–6 lead. Jennings joined Fulton Walker as the only other player at that time to return a kickoff for a touchdown in the Super Bowl. In the next three Super Bowls played in what is now Hard Rock Stadium, players duplicated Jennings' feat: Andre Coleman returned a kickoff against the 49ers in Super Bowl XXIX for the San Diego Chargers, Tim Dwight did so for the Atlanta Falcons against the Denver Broncos in Super Bowl XXXIII, and Devin Hester did so for the Chicago Bears against the Indianapolis Colts in Super Bowl XLI.|$|E

6000|$|... "That is all nonsense," [...] said Mrs Brodrick, {{getting up}} and <b>bursting</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> room in anger. [...] "There is a man ready to marry you, {{and there is the}} money. Anybody can see with half an eye what is your duty." ...|$|R
