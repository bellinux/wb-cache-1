40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. July 2009. Major: Education, Curriculum and Instruction. Advisors: Joan E. Hughes, David R. O’Brien. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); vi, 181 pages, appendices A-F. Ill. (some col.) This dissertation examined online <b>book</b> <b>clubs</b> for youth offered {{during the summer}} by a metropolitan public library system. Voluntary reading rates for {{both boys and girls}} plummet as they move through adolescence (NEA, 2007, NAEP, 2005). <b>Book</b> <b>clubs</b> are one way to support youth in pleasure reading (Appleman, 2006). Although many <b>book</b> <b>clubs</b> geared for youth are school-based, researchers are beginning to take notice of the possibilities that exist for literacy and learning outside the classroom (Hull & Schultz, 2001). These online <b>book</b> <b>clubs</b> were viewed as sites of possibility [...] lenses through which both schools and libraries can more readily understand the possibilities that exist in encouraging "old" and "new" literate practices (Lankshear & Knobel, 2005). This case study utilized Computer-Mediated Discourse Analysis (Herring, 2006) and Critical Discourse Analysis (Fairclough, 1995) to understand more deeply the practices and discourses employed within these online <b>book</b> <b>clubs.</b> Three <b>book</b> <b>clubs</b> (one all-boy, one all-girl, and one mixed-gender) were investigated to understand (1) who participated in these clubs, (2) how both preteens and facilitators participated and (3) {{the ways in which the}} online context and gendered separation of the clubs shaped the clubs' discourse. Analysis of these clubs indicated the promise of online <b>book</b> <b>clubs</b> in (1) providing support for continued voluntary reading, (2) engaging non- and/or struggling readers, and (3) offering a safe scaffold for youth to experience and broaden their new literacies skills and practices. In addition, a model that identifies the elements necessary for engaging youth in online <b>book</b> <b>clubs</b> was proposed...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} idea of <b>book</b> <b>clubs</b> as {{treatment}} for individuals with aphasia. Before that discussion can begin, explanations {{of the field of}} speech-language pathology, evidence based practice, and the background of aphasia must be given. The speech pathologist is the main professional working with individuals with aphasia to help them regain communication and learn compensatory strategies for lost skills. Evidence based practice, researching in order to find support for treatment methods, is a crucial aspect of many health care related professions. Aphasia is a language disorder resulting from damage to the left hemisphere of the brain that can affect numerous language skills. Several programs are currently using aphasia <b>book</b> <b>clubs</b> including the Aphasia Center of California, the Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago, and speech pathologist Jennifer Triandafilou's private practice. By analyzing these programs, it can be found that <b>book</b> <b>clubs</b> have many advantages for the individuals with aphasia. Improvements and suggestions are also given {{at the end of the}} paper in order to strengthen future aphasia <b>book</b> <b>clubs.</b> Overall, this paper is meant to inform the audience about aphasia and support the treatment method of <b>book</b> <b>clubs</b> for individuals with aphasia.

5|$|Entertainment Weekly, the Los Angeles Times, and The New York Times Book Review {{considered}} Middlesex one of {{the best}} books of 2002, and some scholars believed the novel should be considered for the title of Great American Novel.

Reviewers from the medical, gay, and intersex communities mostly praised Middlesex, though some intersex commentators have been more critical.
