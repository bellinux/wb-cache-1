40|$|The {{theme for}} this study is {{organisational}} learning and strategy, and more specifically {{about the relationship between}} learning <b>behaviour,</b> <b>strategy</b> and performance. There were to research questions. The first is regarding the relationship between learning behaviour and performance, with the research question being: Does increased use of learning behaviour in a business simulation {{have an impact on the}} overall performance in the business simulation? The second research question is regarding the relationship between learning <b>behaviour,</b> <b>strategy</b> and performance, with strategy divided in two variables, quality factors and implementation factors. The research question is: Does increased use of learning behaviour increase the use of both implementation factors and quality factors? And will an increased level of implementation factors and quality factors lead to improved performance? Based on theory and research from among others Argyris and Schön (1996), Amy Edmondson (1999), Hanne Iversen (2006) and Henri Mintzberg (2000, 2007), two theoretical models was developed. The models was tested empirically using Structural Equation Modelling, on a sample of mid level managers participating in a strategy simulation. After modifying the second model, the empirical findings are in accordance with the hypothesised models, and the relationship between learning behaviour and performance, as well as learning <b>behaviour,</b> <b>strategy</b> and performance is confirmed in the simulation...|$|E

30|$|Figure 4 {{reveals that}} trust propensities {{of the bank}} and the small {{business}} evolve differently. For the bank, its reciprocity propensity (βB) exhibits an upward spiral during the time interval of [0,[*]td], when the bank trusts the small business and the small business rewards the endowed trust by honouring the loan contracts. Meanwhile, after td, βB starts to decrease along with time and follows a fast-downward spiral. This indicates that once the small business starts to default, the level of trust built through repeated lending interactions drops dramatically from the bank’s side. This results in the decreasing reciprocity propensity of the bank (βB). At the same time, the bank’s altruism propensity (γB) experiences a similar evolution. During the first stage ([0,[*]td]), γBincreases along with the repeated interactions and approximates 1. Meanwhile, it gradually decreases during the second stage ([td,[*]t]) due to {{the change in the}} small business’s <b>behaviour</b> <b>strategy.</b>|$|E
40|$|My thesis aims {{to prove}} the {{hypothesis}} {{that there is an}} influence of an attachment organization on the development of an emotionally stable personality. According to the model of development psychopathology a secure attachment organization constitutes a protective factor and is associated with a desirable development of an individual. It has positive connections with competence in peer relationships, effective self-regulation and better social adaption in early adolescence. An insecure attachement represents a specific vulnerability for further development of a child and it shows links with lower social competence, less effective emotional regulation and social adaption or with psychic disorders. The practical part of this thesis focuses on findings of correlations between an attachement organization to parents in early childhood and the extent of social adaption (determined by the extent of the occurence of behaviour disorders). From among demographic factors, the effect of age on connections between indicators of emotional attachment, parents representation, <b>behaviour</b> <b>strategy</b> and mental defects is investigated.

40|$|Problem {{definition}} The {{world is}} becoming more global, leading to supply chains becoming complicated, and companies struggling to address social and environmental issues within the garment industry. Sustainability activities undertaken by clothing brands have shown marginal results, {{and the need for}} alternative solutions has been realised. Therefore, a movement towards inter-firm collaborations have been established and the challenge faced by clothing brands today is how to scale up these collaborations in order to reach permanent change. Purpose The purpose of this research is to interpret and understand the current actions of clothing brands’ sustainability practices {{in order to understand the}} important aspects influencing their decisions regarding scaled up collaborations. Methodology This is a qualitative study based on interviews in order to achieve an in-depth analysis regarding the process of scaling up collaborations within the garment industry. The empirical findings were connected with existing literature regarding organisational <b>behaviour,</b> <b>strategy</b> and corporate sustainability, opening up for more general conclusions. Conclusions The two main factors affecting clothing brands’ decisions to scale up their collaborations are those that yield legitimacy and a competitive advantage. To adjust to a future of collaborations, clothing brands need to develop competencies and strategies accordingly. If these collaborations do not manage to be scaled up, clothing brands’ ability to make a positive sustainable change within the garment industry will be critiqued...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{evaluate}} the kind and importance of factors influencing the choice of vegetables and fruit consumed by the youth. The research was carried out on youth group aged 15 — 16. The group consisted of 966 pupils, including 483 girls and 483 boys, living in Szczecin. They were selected for the research in two steps, in groups. Fourteen choice factors of raw vegetables and fruit, without separating their assortment, were examined, with the use of a test based on a 3 -point hedonic scale. Between girls and boys no differentiation in the choice factors ranking according to their importance was stated, both in the vegetables and fruit choice. Factors to a great degree taken into account by the youth included: freshness, taste, stability, influence on health, external appearance and nutritional value. In girls group, in comparison to boys, the vegetables choice was significantly more strongly determined by such factors as influence on health, external appearance, nutritional value and habit, and the fruit choice by external appearance and influence on health. Sex of pupils influenced some factors importance degree, independently from their parents education. Significant correlation between the mean vegetables and fruit choice factors importance indicates that there may be elaborated a common <b>behaviour</b> <b>strategy</b> aiming at the youth nutrition rationalization...|$|E
40|$|Purpose – This paper aims {{to address}} the gap that, to date, no {{systematic}} review {{has been carried out}} on the role that structural social capital (SC) plays for knowledge transfer and innovation at the interpersonal, inter-unit and inter-firm levels. Individuals and organisations are becoming increasingly involved in collaboration networks to share knowledge and generate innovation. SC theory has been adopted in several areas of study to explain how individuals, groups and organisations manage relationships to generate innovation. Design/methodology/approach – This review covers studies of SC in organisational <b>behaviour,</b> <b>strategy</b> and management over a period of 20 years. Findings – The literature review shows that knowledge types and knowledge transfer processes are the missing links in the relationship between structural SC and innovation. Moreover, the paper demonstrates that seemingly opposite configurations of SC are complementary to each other (structural holes vs dense networks; strong vs weak ties) and that contextual factors should be considered when discussing the effects of SC on knowledge transfer and innovation. In addition, it is the balance of different configurations of SC which enables an individual or a company to explore, access, assimilate and combine different knowledge types, which will lead to improved innovation outcomes. Originality/value – This review facilitates understanding of the role of SC for knowledge transfer processes and the mediating role of knowledge transfer processes and knowledge types in the relationship between structural SC and innovation...|$|E
40|$|This chapter {{introduces}} a model which connects {{representations of the}} space surrounding a virtual humanoid's body with the space it shares with several interaction partners. This work intends to support virtual humans (or humanoid robots) in near space interaction and is inspired by studies from cognitive neurosciences {{on the one hand}} and social interaction studies on the other hand. We present our work on learning the body structure of an articulated virtual human by using data from virtual touch and proprioception sensors. The results are utilized for a representation of its reaching space, the so-called peripersonal space. In interpersonal interaction involving several partners, their peripersonal spaces may overlap and establish a shared reaching space. We define it as their interaction space, where cooperation takes place and where actions to claim or release spatial areas have to be adapted, to avoid obstructions of the other's movements. Our model of interaction space is developed as an extension of Kendon's F-formation system, a foundational theory of how humans orient themselves in space when communicating. Thus, interaction space allows for measuring not only the spatial arrangement (i. e., body posture and orientation) between multiple interaction partners, but also the extent of space they share. Peripersonal and interaction space are modeled as potential fields to control the virtual human's <b>behaviour</b> <b>strategy.</b> As an example we show how the virtual human can relocate object positions toward or away from locations reachable for all partners, and thus facilitating cooperation in an interaction task. ...|$|E

40|$|Master of EducationThis study {{investigated}} the communicative <b>behaviour</b> <b>strategies</b> exhibited by two preschool children with profound hearing loss during outdoor free play sessions at their integrated and segregated educational settings. The participants were investigated {{in terms of the}} particular play and non-play behaviours they engaged in; along with the communicative behaviours and communicative mode they exhibited during each interaction. The data collection process involved video taped footage analysed over 15 - second intervals for a total of 60 minutes for each participant. The study was designed to give a description of the communicative <b>behaviour</b> <b>strategies</b> and communicative interaction mode used during play and non-play behaviours across the integrated and the segregated preschools. The results of the study suggested that more sophisticated forms of play behaviour; such as cooperative play are observed more often in the integrated setting. In the integrated setting join in communicative strategies were used more often, whereas greeting and inviting communicative behaviours were more frequently observed in the segregated setting. The visual communicative mode was the most often recorded communicative mode in the integrated setting. The main differences were in the amount of solitary play produced in the integrated setting, familiarity with hearing peers may have been a contributing factor to this result. Associative play was greater in the segregated setting and this may have been related to the activities the participants engaged in. Much of the play was based around the sandpit and riding tricycles. In addition, communicative behaviours differed mainly in the level of sharing and joining in behaviours that were demonstrated. The results suggest that sharing may have occurred more in the segregated setting due to the children being more familiar with each other. Join in <b>behaviour</b> <b>strategies</b> were greater in the integrated setting due to the participants gaining access by mainly using the visual interaction mode. Finally, the communicative interaction mode was slightly different across the two settings in the verbal, vocal and sound making mode. The setting also impacted upon the number of instances in which no interaction occurred at all. These results have implications for the management of the preschool outdoor environment in both integrated and segregated settings for children with hearing loss. The outcomes of this study also highlight important areas for further research. Restricted Access: Metadata Onl...|$|R

40|$|Globalization, {{deregulation}} and {{new information}} and communication technologies (ICT) are having enormous effects on all types of business. Indeed, ICT are now adding two new sources of entrepreneurial business alongside start-ups and management buy-ins and buy-outs—rejuvenated established firms and downsized, out-sourced former larger businesses. Schumpeter"s five key areas of innovation (drivers of competitive advantage and entrepreneurial strategy) have taken on a new resonance as ICT have added others such as supply chain management, market information, financing and distribution. Outsourcing and ICT have made economies of scale quicker and easier to achieve for SMEs, but deeper and more extensive knowledge is required of the capabilities of ICT and of potential partners. Economies of scope also require increased knowledge of internal organizational capabilities and of potential external partners. Various studies in the UK highlight the increased importance to entrepreneurial small firms of ICT-supported networking with other firms and of the organizational knowledge that lies behind successful strategies in these areas. Thus, the ability of individual owners and managers to learn and the capacity for organizational learning within an SME become crucial determinants of success in the new knowledge economy. This paper is based on an intensive study of organizational learning among the smaller members of the UK"s Institute of Directors (IoD). It identifies different levels of organizational learning and the characteristics of SMEs at different levels, with particular attention to differences in business strategies. The findings of the IoD study are augmented by findings from the independent non-profit Small Business Research Trust (SBRT). SBRT has collaborated with the Open University Business School in studies on the determinants of management development in SMEs and has longitudinal data for analysing whether there is a connection between growth-oriented, innovative, entrepreneurial SMEs and their propensity to network, to use ICT and to support learning in their organizations. Exploring the linkages between organizational learning and SME <b>behaviour,</b> <b>strategy</b> and performance, the paper concludes with a typology of SME strategies related to organizational learning and suggestions for future research in this area...|$|E
40|$|Background: Obesity {{is mainly}} {{attributed}} to environmental factors. In developed countries, {{the time spent}} on physical activity tasks is decreasing, whereas sedentary behaviour patterns are increasing. The purpose of the intervention is {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} of an intensive family-based behavioural multicomponent intervention (Nereu programme) and compared it to counselling intervention such as a health centre intervention programme for the management of children"s obesity. Methods/Design: The study design is a randomized controlled multicenter clinical trial using two types of interventions: Nereu and Counselling. The Nereu programme is an 8 -month intensive family-based multi-component behavioural intervention. This programme is based on a multidisciplinary intervention consisting of 4 components: physical activity sessions for children, family theoretical and practical sessions for parents, <b>behaviour</b> <b>strategy</b> sessions involving both, parents and children, and lastly, weekend extra activities for all. Counselling is offered to the family in the form of a monthly physical health and eating habits session. Participants will be recruited according the following criteria: 6 to 12 year-old-children, referred from their paediatricians due to overweight or obesity according the International Obesity Task Force criteria and with a sedentary profile (less than 2 hours per week of physical activity), they must live in or near the municipality of Lleida (Spain) and their healthcare paediatric unit must have previously accepted to cooperate with this study. The following variables will be evaluated: a) cardiovascular risk factors (anthropometric parameters, blood test and blood pressure), b) sedentary and physical activity behaviour and dietary intake, c) psychological aspects d) health related quality of life (HRQOL), e) cost-effectiveness of the intervention in relation to HRQOL. These variables will be then be evaluated 4 times longitudinally: at baseline, at the end of the intervention (8 months later), 6 and 12 months after the intervention. We have considered necessary to recruit 100 children and divide them in 2 groups of 50 to detect the differences between the groups. Discussion: This trial will provide new evidence for the long-term effects of childhood obesity management, as well as help to know the impact of the present intervention as a health intervention tool for healthcare centres.

40|$|The {{current state}} of {{contemporary}} higher education institutions reveals challenges such as changing enrolment patterns (Association of American Colleges and Universities [AACU], 2002; Association of Universities and Colleges of Canada [AUCC], 2007; Levac 2 ̆ 6 Newman, 2009), greater calls for accountability (AACU, 2002; Usher, 2015) and decreased public funding (AACU, 2002; Charbonneau, 2013; Ontario Confederation of University Faculty Associations [OCUFA], 2016). In addition to the external challenges of the higher education landscape, institutions are confronted with intersecting organizational {{issues such as the}} need for increasing productivity, improving communication processes, and motivating workforces (Jackson, 2010). These challenges require action, which often make change a constant in organizational life (Kogetsidis, 2012). Organizational culture encompasses those beliefs, values and meanings of the organization’s members (Kezar, 2014; Shultz, 1995) and, therefore, should be considered whenever trying to understand the change in an organization. However, due to the implicit nature of an organization’s culture, leaders tend to overlook the role of culture in the change process. In addressing the often neglected understandings of organizational change and culture, this qualitative, interpretivist intrinsic case study in one university department in Canada explored staff members’ understanding of organizational change initiatives and cultural shifts through semi-structured interviews. Using the framework of interpretive communities (Yanow, 2000), the intent was to explore staff members’ perspectives of change initiatives and their understandings of culture changes in the department. The findings of this exploration revealed that participants identified the practices of leaders, including <b>behaviour,</b> <b>strategy</b> and purpose, and unity, and departmental arrangements, including staffing, structure, and role as the change initiatives that had been the most significant. The participants understood the changes through three interpretive communities including a community of frustration, a community of apprehension, and a community of willingness. The findings from the cultural analysis of the department portrayed a past culture of division and conflict, toxicity, and disrespect. A cultural shift was perceived by participants through their description of a more optimistic culture, although they still questioned a culture of “us” {{as a result of the}} artifact of locale which perpetuated the lingering feelings of separation among staff members, and a lack of department-wide traditions. In response to the study’s findings, three recommendations can be made to build on the already identified improvements to the department. The first recommendation is for leaders to thoroughly consider the implementation and communication plans for future change initiatives in the department as a community of staff members was found to need more information to help them become more accepting of change initiatives. The second recommendation would be for leaders to build on the perceived culture of optimism by emphasizing the identified need to establish department-wide traditions. The last recommendation is for leaders to explore staff members’ understanding of the re-location of the department’s units to one centralized building. The participants provided initial understandings of this change initiative, so once the re-location takes place, it may be in the leaders’ interests to follow-up to see if the initial understandings of the change initiative have shifted in any way. As change initiatives have been perceived to result in cultural shifts, another cultural analysis department may also be informative. The goal of this study was to provide insight for educational leaders about the importance of recognizing organizational cultures when implementing change initiatives as well as to inform educational leaders of the potential impact of staff members’ understanding of organizational change and cultural shifts...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Can {{specific}} <b>behaviour</b> <b>strategies</b> {{be induced}} from low-level observa-tions of two adversary groups of agents with limited domain knowledge? This paper presents a domain-independent Multi-Agent Strategy Discovering Algorithm (MASDA), which discovers strategic behaviour patterns {{of a group}} of agents un-der the described conditions. The algorithm represents the observed multi-agent activity as a graph, where graph connections correspond to performed actions and graph nodes correspond to environment states at action starts. Based on such data representation, the algorithm applies hierarchical clustering and rule induction to extract and describe strategic behaviour. The discovered strategic behaviour is represented visually as graph paths and symbolically as rules. MASDA was evalu-ated on RoboCup. Both soccer experts and quantitative evaluation confirmed the relevance of the discovered behaviour patterns...|$|R
