5|$|More than 1,000 {{unmanned}} missions {{have been}} designed to explore the Earth and the solar system. Besides exploration, communication satellites have also been launched <b>by</b> <b>NASA.</b> The missions have been launched directly from Earth or from orbiting space shuttles, which could either deploy the satellite itself, or with a rocket stage to take it farther.|$|E
5|$|Numerous other {{facilities}} are operated <b>by</b> <b>NASA,</b> including the Wallops Flight Facility in Wallops Island, Virginia; the Michoud Assembly Facility in New Orleans, Louisiana; the White Sands Test Facility in Las Cruces, New Mexico; and Deep Space Network stations in Barstow, California; Madrid, Spain; and Canberra, Australia.|$|E

5|$|Advanced Gemini is {{a number}} of {{proposals}} that would have extended the Gemini program {{by the addition of}} various missions, including manned low Earth orbit, circumlunar and lunar landing missions. Gemini was the second manned spaceflight program operated <b>by</b> <b>NASA,</b> and consisted of a two-seat spacecraft capable of maneuvering in orbit, docking with unmanned spacecraft such as Agena Target Vehicles, and allowing the crew to perform tethered extra-vehicular activities.|$|E
5|$|Ellington Airport, {{the other}} {{branch of the}} Houston Airport System (HAS), is a mixed-use airport. It acts as a {{reliever}} airport for Hobby, in addition to use <b>by</b> <b>NASA,</b> the military, and public aviation. The system has performed significant expansion of the airport in recent years expecting significant growth in its usage in coming years. La Porte Municipal Airport in Pasadena and Chambers County Airport near Anahuac provide public air access to their respective communities.|$|E

5|$|He {{was one of}} the Mercury Seven, {{military}} test pilots {{selected in}} 1959 <b>by</b> <b>NASA</b> as the United States' first astronauts. On February 20, 1962, Glenn flew the Friendship 7 mission, becoming the first American to orbit the Earth, and the fifth person and third American in space. He received the NASA Distinguished Service Medal in 1962 and the Congressional Space Medal of Honor in 1978, was inducted into the U.S. Astronaut Hall of Fame in 1990, and was the last surviving member of the Mercury Seven.|$|E
5|$|In 1995, Rockwell {{joined forces}} with its {{competitor}} Lockheed Martin to form the United Space Alliance, a jointly owned organization created to provide operations support for NASA, {{as well as to}} take over some of the functions previously performed <b>by</b> <b>NASA</b> employees. At this point, Lunney became Vice President and Program Manager of the United Space Alliance's spaceflight operations in Houston; he stayed in this position until his retirement in 1999.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 2000s, Jupiter Europa Orbiter led <b>by</b> <b>NASA</b> and the Jupiter Ganymede Orbiter {{led by the}} ESA were {{proposed}} together as an Outer Planet Flagship Mission to Jupiter's icy moons called Europa Jupiter System Mission, with a planned launch in 2020. In 2009 it was given priority over Titan Saturn System Mission. At that time, there was competition from other proposals. Japan proposed Jupiter Magnetospheric Orbiter.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Howard is summoned for {{astronaut}} training <b>by</b> <b>NASA.</b> After {{his first}} day of training, he talks to Bernadette (Melissa Rauch) via webcam; he vomited while experiencing microgravity. Next, he is forced to go on overnight survival training, where he is spooned by an armadillo during a sandstorm. Bernadette goes to visit Howard in Houston, but finds his mother already there, taking care of him.|$|E
5|$|NASA {{started an}} annual {{competition}} in 2014 named Cubes in Space. It is jointly organized <b>by</b> <b>NASA</b> {{and the global}} education company I Doodle Learning, {{with the objective of}} teaching school students aged 11—18 to design and build scientific experiments to be launched into space on a NASA rocket or balloon. On June 21, 2017 the world's smallest satellite, Kalam SAT, built by an Indian team, was launched.|$|E
5|$|New {{concepts}} for {{missions to}} the Neptune {{system to be}} conducted in the 2010s have been brought forward <b>by</b> <b>NASA</b> scientists on numerous occasions over the last decades. All of them identified Triton as being a prime target and a separate Triton lander comparable to the Huygens probe for Titan was frequently included in those plans. No efforts aimed at Neptune and Triton went beyond the proposal phase and NASA's funding on missions to the outer Solar System is currently focused on the Jupiter and Saturn systems.|$|E
