Nevertheless, his estrangement from Zeke and Moya, coupled with the {{responsibilities}} of heroism, lead him to realize that he will always be alone. If Cole is Infamous, he allows Empire City to slip further into chaos, and disregards Kessler's warning about the Beast, believing himself to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>strongest</b> to ever exist.|$|E
5|$|In 1825, Clifford's Tower and the Waud {{house were}} {{purchased}} by the county of Yorkshire {{at the cost of}} £8,800 (£665,000 at 2009 prices). The new prison buildings, designed by architects P. F. Robinson and G. T. Andrews, were constructed in a Tudor Gothic style, including a gatehouse 35 feet (11 metres) high and a radial prison block, protected by a long, high stone wall. The prison, considered to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>strongest</b> such building in England, was built entirely of stone to be both secure and fireproof. Dark grey gritstone was used in the construction to produce a forbidding appearance, although the prison itself was considered healthy and well ventilated.|$|E

5|$|Band Hero has {{received}} mixed to positive reviews from gaming critics. Most recognized {{the game as}} having the same feature sets as Guitar Hero 5, including any benefits or flaws that may come from that. Reviewers praised the reuse of the Guitar Hero 5 features such as the Party Play mode that allows for players to jump in and out, the improved Career mode, and the improved GHTunes. Some identified that the target market of the game appears to be towards teenage girls, such as the featuring of Taylor Swift, the color schemes used in the game, {{and other parts of}} the song selection. Reviewers noted that setlist would <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>strongest</b> measure of whether players should purchase the game. The reviewers also commented on the smaller setlist, which contains only 65 songs compared to Guitar Hero 5s 85.|$|E
5|$|Coddington {{and several}} others left the colony, {{establishing}} the settlement of Newport {{at the south end}} of the island. The freemen of Pocasset changed the name of their town to Portsmouth. They adopted a new government which provided for trial by jury and separation of church and state. The men who accompanied Coddington to Newport tended to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>strongest</b> leaders; several became presidents or governors of the entire united colony after 1646, such as Coggeshall, Nicholas Easton, William Brenton, Jeremy Clarke, and Henry Bull. On 12 March 1640, the towns of Portsmouth and Newport agreed to re-unite peacefully. Coddington became governor of the island, and William Hutchinson was chosen as one of his assistants. The towns were to remain autonomous with laws made by the citizens.|$|E

5|$|South Vietnamese {{military}} forces in Huế and Da Nang belonged to the ARVN 1st Brigade, I Corps Tactical Zone. Commanded by Lieutenant General Ngô Quang Trưởng, the South Vietnamese I Corps was considered to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>strongest</b> amongst all the military formations of South Vietnam. It had three infantry divisions (1st, 2nd and 3rd Infantry Divisions), the Airborne Division (led by Major General Le Quang Luong), the Marine Corps Division (led by Major General Bui The Lan), and four ranger groups (11th, 12th, 14th and 15th Ranger Groups). The Airborne and Marine Corps Division each had an assigned strength of four brigades. In addition to the infantry units, there were also the 5th Armoured Brigade, five squadrons of armored vehicles (4th, 7th, 11th, 17th and 20th Armored Squadrons), 13 armored companies, and 21 artillery battalions.|$|E
5|$|The product {{claimed to}} <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>strongest</b> beer made is Schorschbräu's 2011 Schorschbock 57 with 57,5%. It {{was preceded by}} The End of History, a 55% Belgian ale, made by BrewDog in 2010. The same company had {{previously}} made Sink The Bismarck!, a 41% abv IPA, and Tactical Nuclear Penguin, a 32% abv Imperial stout. Each of these beers are made using the eisbock method of fractional freezing, in which a strong ale is partially frozen and the ice is repeatedly removed, until the desired strength is reached, a process that may class the product as spirits rather than beer. The German brewery Schorschbräu's Schorschbock, a 31% abv eisbock, and Hair of the Dog's Dave, a 29% abv barley wine made in 1994, used the same fractional freezing method. A 60% abv blend of beer with whiskey was jokingly claimed as the strongest beer by a Dutch brewery in July 2010.|$|E
5|$|Between the Humber and Forth the English {{had formed}} into two main kingdoms, Deira and Bernicia, often united as the Kingdom of Northumbria. A number of Celtic kingdoms also existed in this region, {{including}} Craven, Elmet, Rheged, and Gododdin. A native British kingdom, later called the Kingdom of Strathclyde, survived {{as an independent}} power into the 10th century in the area which became modern-day Dunbartonshire and Clydesdale. To the north-west of Strathclyde lay the Gaelic kingdom of Dál Riata, and to the north-east {{a small number of}} Pictish kingdoms. Further north still lay the great Pictish kingdom of Fortriu, which after the Battle of Dun Nechtain in 685 came to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>strongest</b> power in the northern half of Britain. The Irish had always had contacts {{with the rest of the}} British Isles, and during the early 6th century they immigrated from the island of Ireland to form the kingdom of Dál Riata, although exactly how much conquest took place is a matter of dispute with historians. It also appears likely that the Irish settled in parts of Wales, and even after the period of Irish settlement, Irish missionaries were active in Britain.|$|E

5|$|On October 23, an open trough was {{centered}} north of Hispaniola near the Turks and Caicos islands. At 0000 UTC the following day, {{the area of}} disturbed weather became organized and was analyzed to have become a tropical storm southeast of Inagua, based on nearby vessel reports. Initially, the storm drifted northward, but later began to accelerate towards the northeast after a roughly 12-hour period. At 0600 UTC on September 25, the disturbance slightly gained in intensity to attain maximum wind speeds of 45 mph (75 km/h); these would <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>strongest</b> winds associated with the storm as a fully tropical cyclone. A reanalysis of the system indicated that {{due to a lack}} of definite tropical features, the storm may have had been a subtropical cyclone. On October 26, the system became increasingly asymmetric and had developed frontal boundaries, allowing for it to be classified as an extratropical cyclone at 0600 UTC that day. Once transitioning into an extratropical system, the storm continued to intensified as it moved northward. On October 27, the system was analyzed to have a minimum pressure of at least 985 mbar (hPa; 29.09 inHg) after passing to the southeast of Bermuda. At 1200 UTC later that day, the cyclone reached an extratropical peak intensity with winds of 80 mph (130 km/h) just east of Newfoundland. Had the storm been tropical at the time, it would have been classified as a modern-day Category 1 hurricane. Subsequently, the extratropical storm curved eastward, where it persisted before dissipating by 1800 UTC on September 29.|$|E

It is notoriously difficult to break down with a frontal assault, though it is weaker from the side. It is typically used against Static Rook openings that involve advancing the rook's pawn. However, one's opponent may just as easily adopt this defense, giving neither side an advantage.|$|E
