40|$|Previous {{investigations}} into fatigue under multiaxial stress, and also cumulative damage under uniaxial stress, {{are discussed in}} conjunction with the parameters relevant to the present experimental investigation. A biaxial fatigue machine is described which can subject thin wall tubes to combinations of fluctuating internal pressure and either fluctuating longitudinal tension or compression covering the complete ++ and +- stress quadrants. The machine is also provided with independent eight stage programmers in both pressure circuits. Constant amplitude fatigue tests have been carried out on thin wall aluminium alloy (2 L 65) tubular specimens over the complete,++ and +- stress quadrants. V, 4 new equation for predicting the fatigue failure of ductile metals under multiaxial stress is proposed based on the maximum range of shear stress modified for the effects of the normal stress acting on the maximum shear stress plane and of anisotropy. ý' This equation is shown to give excellent agreement with all published data on fatigue under uniaxial stress and multiaxial stress viz. combined bending and twisting and thin and thick wall cylinder data. A simplified equation, neglecting the effect of the range of normal stress, is suggested for design purposes. Two level biaxial <b>block</b> <b>programme</b> tests, at constant and two step principal stress ratio, have also been carried out on the same aluminium alloy.

40|$|Introduction: Primary {{health care}} is the nucleus of country's health care {{delivery}} system. Bottlenecks in delivery of services at PHC level leads to decreased efficiency of health system and indirectly affects health {{of the citizens of}} a country. Keeping these issues in mind a study was carried out with the objectives i) To identify constraints/bottlenecks in implementation of elements of primary health care ii) To find out solutions to address these bottlenecks. Materials and Methods: This cross-sectional study was carried out in Cuttack district during Dec 2010 and January 2011 using a semi-structured pre-tested questionnaire. Data regarding various difficulties faced while delivering health care services at PHC was collected from participants attending district level IMNCI (Integrated Management of Neonatal and Childhood Illness) training after getting verbal consent. All 72 respondents who had attended the training during the above mentioned period were included in this study (Medical officer, AYUSH medical officer, Maternal Child Health co-coordinators and <b>Block</b> <b>Programme</b> Officers). Data were analyzed manually using content analysis. Results: Difficulty in vaccine delivery, inadequate infrastructure and lack of sufficient manpower for smooth functioning of JSY, difficulty in card updation and difficulty in retrieval of defaulter of alcoholic TB patients for Directly Observed Treatment Shortcourse (DOTS) are some of the problems identified in general. Conclusion: The study identified the need for strengthening infrastructure and manpower to provide quality care for institutional delivery. It also emphasized the need for construction of more number of sub centre buildings which forms the backbone of rural health care delivery system. Identification of loop holes and bridging the gap by corrective action will make the journey towards Millenium Development Goal (MDG) easier...|$|E

50|$|Proposals {{to create}} a single digital market for European Union (EU) member states include rules for net neutrality. These rules require that all {{internet}} traffic has to be treated equally, without blocking or slowing down certain data. Net neutrality guidelines were announced in August 2016 by the Body of European Regulators of Electronic Communications. It is thought that the rules may restrict the legality of ISP filtering after 2016. In May 2014 the government suggested it would veto European net neutrality legislation due to its conflict with web <b>blocking</b> <b>programmes.</b> In May 2015, a leaked Council of the European Union document {{on the topic of}} net neutrality suggested users would have to opt into blocks, rather than opt out as per the current UK government's plans.

However, the requirement that a UK government adheres to EU rules on net neutrality may disappear at some point in future when the United Kingdom leaves the European Union.|$|R

40|$|Over recent decades, a {{wide range}} of rivers and lakes {{draining}} peat-dominated catchments across the UK have exhibited statistically-significant increases in water colour and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration. This has implications for the carbon budget of those peatlands, and for the long-term viability of water treatment works which must remove the colour in the treatment process. Suggested causes for such increases include lower water tables in the peat, and changes in the peat chemistry through decreasing atmospheric acid deposition. One factor potentially affecting the peat water tables, and therefore possibly related to the increases in DOC, is the practice of peatland drainage, which may affect both the production of DOC and the hydrological behaviour of the peat. Drainage is no longer believed to be beneficial in increasing the amenity value of peat and so {{there is a need to}} understand whether blocking the drains will be an effective strategy in decreasing DOC export and mitigating the observed increases at water treatment works. This thesis presents the results of monitoring individual blocked drain, unblocked drain, and stream catchments. The results are used to construct detailed DOC export budgets and to compare the behaviour of the catchments. This enables identification of the extent to which drainage increases DOC export; of differences in behaviour between blocked and unblocked drains, and of whether drain blocking is likely to reverse any such increase in DOC export. Results from these individual small catchments are considered in the context of the overall DOC export across the larger scale catchment of a large water treatment works. DOC sources across the larger catchment were also monitored and, using novel statistical techniques, catchment export is related to catchment properties including the presence of drainage. These results are used to assess the likely benefits of a large scale drain <b>blocking</b> <b>programme</b> with respect to the DOC concentration observed at the water treatment works. Results are presented showing that drainage does substantially increase the DOC export from peat, with DOC export being highest from flat, extensively drained peat areas. Blocking does decrease the export from individual drain catchments, but not to pre-drainage levels, even a decade after blocking. The decreases due to blocking are shown to be due primarily to changes in the hydrological behaviour of the drains rather than changes in the production of DOC. Therefore a catchment-wide drain <b>blocking</b> <b>programme</b> is recommended as a strategy for reduction, but not total amelioration, of the increasing DOC trend that is observed at water treatment works. However, before this is implemented further understanding of the large scale changes in peatland hydrology that may follow blocking will be required, as the results do not indicate a reduction in DOC production.
