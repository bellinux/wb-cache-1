500|$|By issuing bail-out aid {{guaranteed}} by prudent eurozone taxpayers to rule-breaking eurozone {{countries such as}} Greece, the EU and eurozone countries also encourage moral hazard in the future.

500|$|Starship Troopers is {{narrated by}} the main protagonist Juan [...] "Johnny" [...] Rico, {{a member of the}} [...] "Mobile Infantry". It {{is one of the few}} Heinlein novels which intersperses his typical linear {{narrative}} structure with a series of flashbacks. These flashbacks are frequently to Rico's History and Moral Philosophy course in school, in which the teacher discusses the history of the structure of their society. Rico is depicted as a man of Filipino ancestry, although there has been disagreement on this matter among fans. He is from a wealthy family, whose members had never served in the army. Rico's ancestry is depicted to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>of</b> no consequence; the society he lives in appears to have abandoned racial and gender-based prejudice.|$|E
500|$|The Welsh Language Act 1993 and the Government of Wales Act 1998 {{provide that}} the English and Welsh {{languages}} be treated on {{a basis of}} equality, and both are used as working languages within the National Assembly. Both English and Welsh are considered official languages of Wales, with Welsh further recognised in law as having [...] "official status". English is spoken by almost all people in Wales and is the main language {{in most of the}} country. Code-switching is common in all parts of Wales and is known by various terms, though none is recognised by professional linguists. [...] "Wenglish" [...] is the Welsh English language dialect. It has been influenced significantly by Welsh grammar and includes words derived from Welsh. According to John Davies, Wenglish has [...] "been the object of far greater prejudice than anything suffered by Welsh". Northern and western Wales retain many areas where Welsh is spoken as a first language by the majority of the population, and English learnt as a second language. The 2011 Census showed 562,016 people, 19.0% of the Welsh population, were able to speak Welsh, a decrease from the 20.8% returned in the 2001 census. Although monoglotism in young children continues, life-long monoglotism in Welsh is recognised to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>of</b> the past.|$|E

2500|$|In {{subsequent}} years, {{according to}} Berlioz biographer David Cairns, {{the work was}} thought of as [...] "a noble white elephant [...] something with beautiful things in it, but too long and supposedly full of dead wood.

2500|$|With modern Chinese governments advocating smaller {{families}} through {{family planning}} campaigns and policy-making, large extended families may <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>of</b> the past.

Contrasted with the large extended families created during the pre-war and baby-boom years, average modern Chinese families now have many fewer children.|$|E

60|$|One day {{a number}} of Eastern capitalists visited Benton. The fame of the town drew crowds of the curious and greedy.
