40|$|Abstract. Quality-of-Service (QoS) {{performance}} and connection admission control (CAC) for heterogeneous services in wireless multiple access networks are investigated. The heterogeneous services include {{constant bit rate}} (CBR), variable bit rate (VBR) and available bit rate (ABR) services. Multiple access control is handled by a polling-based scheme with non-preemptive priority. Tight delay variation (jitter) bounds for CBR connections and delay bounds for VBR connections are derived. A CAC scheme based on the derived bounds is developed. The CAC makes use of user mobility information to reserve an appropriate amount of system resources for potential handoff connections to achieve low handoff connection dropping rate (HCDR). Simulation {{results show that the}} proposed CAC scheme can achieve both low HCDR and high resource utilization.

A demonstration plant using extraction steam from a waste incineration plant to charge the storage with 130 °C hot air and an industrial drying process as customer 7 km {{far away from the}} charging station was built, operated and monitored over one year. The storage contains 14 tons of Zeolite and uses at the discharging station exhaust air from the dryer with 60 °C and 0. 09 kg/kg humidity to realize a storage capacity of 2. 3 MWh, saves 616 kg carbon dioxide per cycle and shows no degradation within accuracy of the measuring equipment.

It occurs through a two-level self-assembly involving two dynamic processes: reversible covalent <b>bound</b> <b>connection</b> and reversible metal ion coordination. Thus, mixing the aminophenol 3, the dialdehyde 4, and zinc acetate generates the grid complex 1 a(Zn) via the assembly of the ligand 2 a by imine formation and of the grid by zinc(II) binding. When the same process is conducted in a solution containing a mixture of different aminophenol and carbonyl components, the generation of the grid 1 a(Zn) drives {{the selection of the}} correct components in a virtual dynamic library of ligands, displaying an amplification factor of > 100 and a selectivity of > 99 %. Component exchange as well as reversible protonic modulation of the assembly/disassembly process display the dynamic character of the system and its ability to respond/adapt to changes in environmental conditions. The processes described demonstrate the implementation of a two-level self-organization by selection operating on the dynamic diversity generated by a set of reversibly connected components and driven by the formation of a specific product in a “self-design” fashion...|$|E

In other words, {{the size of the}} system of equations used to solve a non-reinforced medium {{is the same as the}} one used to solve the reinforced counterpart. Another important characteristic of the formulation is the reduced work required by the user to introduce reinforcements, avoiding ""rebar"" elements, node by node geometrical definitions or even complex mesh generation. <b>Bounded</b> <b>connection</b> between long fibers and continuum is considered, for short fibers a simplified approach is proposed to consider splitting.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to assess genetic {{engineering}} (GE) through the values that the Confederation of Te Ati Awa, Ngati Raukawa ki te tonga and Ngati Toarangatira (the ART Confederation) associates with ngarara. The Korowai Framework was developed to conduct this assessment. Interviews were conducted with 14 participants from across the ART Confederation on the values they associate with ngarara and their interpretations of GE. The values associated with ngarara that were identified in the interviews, were used constitute the kaupapa of the Korowai Framework. The key values identified are: mauri, whakapapa, tohu, tapu, and kaitiakitanga. It emerged from the interviews that ngarara appeal to us to be conscious of our intricately <b>bound</b> <b>connection</b> to and dependency on living systems. The assessment through the Korowai Framework found that the outcomes of GE do not uphold the values associated with ngarara.

The function τ(T) = 12 maxi,j= 1, [...] .,n{||(ei − ej) >T || 1 } {{is known as}} a coefficient of ergodicity for T, and measures {{the rate at which the}} iterates of a Markov chain with transition matrix T converge to the stationary distribution vector. Many Markov chains are equipped with an underlying combinatorial structure that is described by a directed graph, and in view of that fact, we consider the following problem: given a directed graph D, find τmin(D) ≡ min τ(T), where the minimum is taken over all stochastic matrices T such that D(T) is a spanning subgraph of D. In this paper, we characterise τmin(D) as the solution to a linear program-ming problem. We then go on to provide an upper bound on τmin(D) in terms of the maximum outdegree of D, and a lower bound on τmin(D) in terms of the maximum indegree of D, characterising the equality cases in both <b>bounds.</b> <b>Connections</b> are established between the equality case in the lower bound and certain balanced incomplete block designs...|$|R
40|$|Flows {{traversing}} a buffer-limited network {{can suffer}} rapid throughput deterioration with increasing path length. This paper introduces a distributed transmission scheduling scheme that supports strong bandwidth guarantees for flows routed {{over a large}} number of hops, without compromising network utilization. The scheme is defined within a reservation-based transmission control framework. Through randomization at the ingress routers and batch scheduling of transmission requests at the links, it ensures that a fraction of transmissions from each ingress–egress connection consistently experience low blocking probability at every hop. These requests are therefore likely to survive long paths. The scheme supports provable bounds on the expected blocking rate and its tail probability. We compare the bounds achieved under this scheme to those obtained when the blocking probability of each request at a link is equal to the link’s blocking rate. We find that the proposed scheme improves the <b>bounds</b> for <b>connections</b> experiencing blocking at multiple hops without weakening the <b>bounds</b> for other <b>connections...</b>|$|R
40|$|This {{communication}} {{proposes a}} simple way to introduce fibers into finite element modelling. This is a promising formulation to deal with fiber-reinforced composites by the finite element method (FEM), as it allows the consideration of short or long fibers placed arbitrarily inside a continuum domain (matrix). The most important feature of the formulation is that no additional degree of freedom is introduced into the pre-existent finite element numerical system to consider any distribution of fiber inclusions. In other words, the size of the system of equations used to solve a non-reinforced medium {{is the same as the}} one used to solve the reinforced counterpart. Another important characteristic is the reduced work required by the user to introduce fibers, avoiding `rebar` elements, node-by-node geometrical definitions or even complex mesh generation. An additional characteristic of the technique is the possibility of representing unbounded stresses at the end of fibers using a finite number of degrees of freedom. Further studies are required for non-linear applications in which localization may occur. Along the text the linear formulation is presented and the <b>bounded</b> <b>connection</b> between fibers and continuum is considered. Four examples are presented, including non-linear analysis, to validate and show the capabilities of the formulation. Copyright (c) 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} the video-on-demand (VoD) streaming {{problem in a}} Peer-to-Peer (P 2 P) network in a decentralized model, in which peers have no global information about the network. Assuming that only one server has all the chunks, {{the objective is to}} stream M chunks to N peers in the network such that small latency and good fluency are achieved by all peers. We design a simple and decentralized protocol in which each peer maintains a constant number of neighbors and only need to communicate with one of them chosen uniformly at random every time. Moreover, the maximum number of communications established on each peer every time is also bounded by a constant. Our theoretical analysis for the model guarantees that the latency of each peer in our protocol is at most O(〖log〗^ 2 N), which is an O(logN) approximation of any optimal protocol. Moreover, we provide non-trivial upper and lower bounds related to the communication details, which give key insights as to why our simple protocol achieves almost-optimal performance. We also show by experiment that even under the setting of <b>bounded</b> <b>connection,</b> <b>bounded</b> transmission and decentralization, our protocol ensures that almost all peers in the dynamic P 2 P VoD network can achieve low latency and good fluency in different kinds of network topologies. In our protocol, peers' benefits are not compromised too much when they behave unselfishly by disseminating their neighbors' downloading requests, which is very important in real world application. Experiment shows that our protocol is robust against selfish peers who block their up-streams: similar performance can be maintained under the existence of (a small fraction of) selfish peers. In the Big Trajectory Data Join problem, we develop a novel bounding technique, which enables trajectories to be pruned significantly. We further design a fast sweep line algorithm with rectangle bound for each trajectory as the heuristic information, which can be used to improve the query efficiency. published_or_final_versionComputer ScienceMasterMaster of Philosoph...|$|R

40|$|The {{key idea}} of our {{construction}} {{is that each}} node is assigned a level and chooses one neighbor from a level above it and its other neighbors from its own level. This assignment of levels is done through a random process which helps ensure {{that the degree of}} each node is bounded in expectation no matter what the positions of the points. For the special case where the locations of the points are generated by a Poisson point process we show that even when all nodes have equal battery power, the probability of the edges formed being long is very small. Encouraged by this we define a edge-length bounded version of our structure in which all edges above a certain length, determined by the battery power of the node, are deleted. We demonstrate that for a Poisson point process of sufficiently high density, this more practical structure is still connected. Paper organization and our contributions. In Section 2 we define hierarchical neighbor graphs. We also describe proactive and reactive routing protocols for this architecture and discuss how it can be easily adapted when nodes join or leave or when battery power changes. Additionally: • We show analytically that hierarchical neighbor graphs have bounded degree in expectation (Section 3. 1). • When the location of the points are determined by a Poisson point process, the probability of long-range connections being formed is very low. We also define a <b>bounded</b> <b>connection</b> length version of our structure and show through simulation that it is connected for Poisson point processes of sufficiently high densit...|$|R

Consolidation {{has been}} {{implemented}} in two ways: as straight rehearsal of patterns or as pseudorehearsal, in which pseudoitems {{are created by}} sampling attractors or input–output combinations from the network. Although both implementations have been investigated by several authors, few have explored how it is decided which pattern or pseudoitem is consolidated. Controlling consolidation is not trivial, as it is susceptible to a corruption. In runaway consolidation, one or two patterns monopolize all consolidation resources and come to dominate the entire network. Runaway consolidation is analysed, and three solutions are explored. Suppressing transmission in the connections in which consolidation takes place is shown to work best.
