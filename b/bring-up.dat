60|$|It {{was not at}} all late {{when the}} Wallingford was slowly {{approaching}} the wharf where it was intended to <b>bring-up.</b> There was a sloop ahead of us, which we had been gradually approaching for the last two hours, but which was enabled to keep in advance in consequence of the lightness of the wind. This dying away of the breeze rendered the approaching noon-tide calm and pleasant; and everybody in-board, even to Grace, came on deck, as we moved slowly past the dwellings on the eastern bank, {{in order to get a}} view of the town. I proposed that the Clawbonny party should land, contrary to our original intention, and profit by the opportunity to see the political capital of the State at our leisure. Both Grace and Lucy were inclined to listen favourably; and the Drewetts, Andrew and his sisters, were delighted at this prospect of our remaining together a little longer. Just at this moment, the Wallingford, true to her character, was coming up with the sloop ahead, and was already doubling on her quarter. I was giving some orders, when Lucy and Chloe, supporting Grace, passed me on their way to the cabin. My poor sister was pale as death, and I could see that she trembled so much she could hardly walk. A significant glance from Lucy bade me not to interfere, and I hid sufficient self-command to obey. I turned to look at the neighbouring sloop, and found at once an explanation of my sister's agitation. The Mertons and Rupert were on her quarter-deck, and so near as to render it impossible to avoid speaking, at least to the former. At this embarrassing instant Lucy returned to my side, with a view, as I afterwards learned, to urge me to carry the Wallingford to some place so distant, as to remove the danger of any intercourse. This accident rendered the precaution useless, the whole party in the other vessel catching sight of my companion at the same moment.|$|E

40|$|Nowadays, Visible Light Communication (VLC) has {{attracted}} the attention of the scientific community due to its great potential in creating smart communication links. Exploiting visible light modulations, could in time enable Internet connectivity via light lamps. Recent research studies have shown that modern smartphones have the ability to capture high frequency light patterns and increase the applicability of VLC links, enabling smart applications. However, creating flexible camera-based VLC links <b>brings-up</b> several challenges that are introduced by the diversity of the available devices. Firstly, existing VLC systems offer inflexible setups that are designed to operate at fixed distances. This fact causes problems when it comes to varying the distance between the transmitter and the receiver. This thesis introduces DynaLight: an adaptive line-of-sight VLC system for smartphones that dynamically adjusts and maximizes its channel capacity by estimating the distance between the transmitter and the receiver. Secondly, the wide diversity in smartphones’ hardware introduces problems when it comes to implementing a generic VLC link for market smartphones. In order to increase the applicability of our system, we chose to utilize inexpensive hardware, that introduce performance limitations, such as limited camera control. We present an image processing pipeline that identifies and overcomes effects that are caused by off-the-shelf hardware, and we further increase the amount of information, that can be extracted, by 40 %. Last but not least, we develop a smartphone application that implements our enhancements and draws attention to synchronization challenges. Our conclusions indicate that the applicability of smartphone VLC links will be further extended due to the rapid evolution of modern smartphones.

These instruments are accessed at post-silicon validation, debugging, wafer sort, package test, burn-in, printed circuit board <b>bring-up,</b> {{printed circuit board assembly}} manufacturing test, power-on self-test, and operator-driven in-field test. At any of these scenarios, it is of interest to access some but not all of the instruments. IEEE 1149. 1 - 2013 and IEEE 1687 propose Test Access Port based (TAP-based) mechanisms to design flexible scan networks such that any combination of instruments can be accessed from outside of the IC. Previous works optimize TAP-based scan networks for one scenario with a known number of accesses. However, at design time, it is difficult to foresee all needed scenarios and the exact number of accesses to instruments. Moreover, the number of accesses might change due to late design changes, addition/exclusion of tests, and changes of constraints.

However, ob-taining processor and system {{power consumption}} informa-tion can be non-trivial. Simulators are time consuming and prone to error.

Our technique exploits the PDS, which is an existing distributed resource in all ICs, and provides a means of characterizing metal resistance {{in the context of an}} actual circuit design. By applying a sequence of tests using small on-chip support circuits attached to the PDS, the resistance of components of the PDS can be obtained from the solution to a set of simultaneous equations. The results from hardware experiments involving two sets of test chips fabricated in an IBM 65 nm technology show significant changes in the resistance variation of some components of the PDS as the process evolved. This process variation data can be applied to hardware security by forming a PUF from the various resistance components of the PDS. We demonstrate that this PUF signature can then be used to uniquely identify each IC, even in the more evolved set of test chips. Based on a population of 24 ICs, we have determined that the PUF is capable of distinguishing all but 47 out of 10, 000 ICs. The signature may require only 46 bytes per IC...|$|E

The PCAL 9555 A is a pin-to-pin replacement to the PCA 9555, however, the PCAL 9555 A powers up with all I/O interrupts masked. This mask default allows for a board <b>bring-up</b> free of spurious interrupts at power-up.

The present work gives a biological study of the Curimatus elegans Steind., a small fish without any economical importance, {{which is to be}} found along the whole brazilian coast, down till Paraguay. The specimens utilized for the present study come from Fortaleza (Ceará, north-eastern Brazil). The C. elegans is « ilyophagus », that means, it feeds itself exclusively with those organic materials to be found in mud, specially with microscopical algae. The intestines are very extent, some of them measuring about 9 to 11 times body's length. Studies have been made about growth and age of the C. elegans; the biggest sizes found were of 153 mm. for females and 88 mm. for males. The C. elegans shows developed sexual glands during a long period (April to September). The movements of the spermatozoa, in contact with water is of 40 to 50 seconds of intense movements, ceasing after 70 to 100 seconds. In contact with 0. 5 % NaCl-solution spermatozoa show a big increase in movements-time, that can last till about 25 minutes. The eggs' diameter measures 0. 70 to 0. 73 mm., mature and hydrated it attains 0. 93 to 1, 00 mm. There is a certain correlation between the size of the body and the quantity of eggs. Big specimens can produce a total of 200. 000 eggs. The average quantity contained in 1 gr. and 1 cc. is 6018 and 6229 eggs, respectively. Maturity and spawning in laboratory has been obtained due to injections of suspension of fish-hypophysis. Three or four hours after the injection, fishes show more movement and evident signs of excitation, proceeding spawning after 5 to 6 hours. Males, persecuting females, describe successive circles (merry-go-round) - carroussel), swimming side by side with females up to water's surface, where sexual products are start beating dry, for there is no blood yet. Circulation-scheme is to be found on fig. 4 and 5. The swim-bladder and the stomach are but delineated; the intestine is formed by a cylindric tube, all closed. At the place, where later on there will open the mouth, we find a group of ciliary hairs that produce a liquid current, very evident by the semi-circle formed by attached solid particles. After 36 hours, opening of the mouth and formation of the gill slits begin. At the age of 90 hours (4 mm.) the larvas swim well and start to feed themselves; the digestive tube is now all open and the swimbladder works already. During the first days of life, larvas have an adhesive organ situated at their frontal region (fig. 7) in form of a crescent, by means of which they hang to surrounding vegetation (fig. 6). When the larva begins to swim and to feed itself and its yolk are having been absorbed. the adhesive organ retracts and disappears. While larvas and alevins feed themselves with plancton, they have small eye-teeth, which disappear,. when fishes become « ilyophagus ». There exist too, during their life as larvas, pharyngeal-teeth. The lateral line appears in the larva after 16 to 18 days; more or less at the same time all fins are completely developed. Shortly after, first scales appear (20 to 23 days). Evolution of intestines twisting followed (fig. 9). Larvas show at different parts of their bodies small of organs excretory functions, that are constituted by bottons in serial disposition, every one with an excretory canal that opens towards the outside. These formations disappear suddenly when larvas attain their phase of alevin. The existence of a great number of said formations at the caudal fin (fig. 12) is of great interest. In our experiences of breeding we have employed several thousands of C. elegans larvas in different environs and we made conditions of surrounding change (illumination), depth of water, temperature, presence of sand at bottom of aquariums and without sand, food).
