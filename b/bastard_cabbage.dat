50|$|Andira inermis is a nitrogen-fixing tree {{native to}} the area from {{southern}} Mexico through Central America to northern South America (Peru, Bolivia, and Brazil); it has been introduced to the Caribbean, the Antilles, Florida, and Africa. The tree has many names due to its wide distribution and multiple uses: it {{is also known as}} the cabbage bark (in Belize), almendro macho (in El Salvador), almendro de río or river almond (Honduras), <b>bastard</b> <b>cabbage</b> tree, cabbage angelin (United States), cabbage bark (United States), cabbage tree, carne asada (Costa Rica), guacamayo (Honduras), Jamaica cabbage tree, moca (Puerto Rico), partridge wood (United States), worm bark, or yellow cabbage tree.|$|E

A factorial experiment {{based on a}} complete randomized blocks design with four replications was conducted in 2009. Treatments consisted of three planting date (April 4 th, May 5 th and Juns 5 th) and five weed control methods, Trifluralin (2 Lit/ha) + Fokus (1. 5 Lit/ha), Trifluralin+Nabu-s (3 Lit/ha), Trifluralin, Hand weeding and without control. Results indicated that planting dates and weed control methods significantly affected head diameter, 100 grain weight, seed number per head and grain yield. Harvest index and oil percent was affected only by planting dates. The highest grain yield (630. 1 g/m 2), was produced in the second planting date (May 5) by using Trifluralin+Fokus. Delaying sowing date (after May 5) significantly decreased grain yield. The most important weeds in the experimental site were common lambsquarter (Chenopodium album), field bind weed (Convolvulus arvensis), <b>bastard</b> <b>cabbage</b> (Rapistrum rugosum), flower-of-an-hour (Hibiscus trionum), cockspur grass (Echinochloa colorum) and green bristle grass (Setaria verticillata). It was observed that the dry matter weight sharply varied in all weed species in different planting dates, that is, in the 4 th April the dry matter production of common lambsquarter and <b>bastard</b> <b>cabbage,</b> in June 5 th planting date were maximum. Dry matter of broad leaf and narrow leaf weeds in the date of May 5 th was lower {{than the other two}} planting dates. The interaction {{of planting}} date ×control methods on head diameter, seed number per head, grain yield and weeds dry matter was significant...|$|E
