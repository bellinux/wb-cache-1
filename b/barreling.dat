25|$|Barrel {{burnishing}} {{is a type}} of <b>barreling</b> {{where no}} cutting action is desired. The goal is to reduce minute irregularities and produce a clean, smooth surface. The parts are usually tumbled against themselves or with steel balls, shot, rounded-end pins, or ballcones to achieve this. It is also usually a wet process that uses water and a lubricant or cleaning agent, such as soap or cream of tartar. The barrel is not loaded more than half full and if media is used then a 2:1 ratio of media to parts is maintained to keep the parts from rubbing.|$|E

500|$|Matt Fowler of IGN {{wrote in}} his review of the episode, [...] "Some {{sluggish}} stories took better turns this week – albeit sometimes by just ending things for now – while a book character many thought would never appear on the series made a notable splash, answering a big mystery that the novels hadn’t even revealed yet in the process. There were some great moments in [...] "Blood of My Blood", but mostly the big returns {{made it possible to}} salivate for the payoffs (and possible characters) to come." [...] He also continued by noting, [...] "this installment probably speaks, more than any other episode so far this season, to the accelerated rate of payoffs we're now getting that the show isn't directly following the books." [...] Fowler gave the episode an 8.6 out of 10. Laura Prudom of Variety also praised the pacing of the episode as well as the season's payoffs, writing [...] "There's a clarity of purpose in Season 6 that certainly gives the impression that we're <b>barreling</b> towards a conclusion instead of just meandering through Dorne or killing time in Qarth." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{individual}} character arcs {{were laid out}} by the series' creative team, with Marvel's only initial guidelines being to work around Captain America: The Winter Soldier, which sees the organization S.H.I.E.L.D. destroyed. Jed Whedon said on this, [...] "if someone told you that concept, you'd {{think it was a}} great thing to have happen {{at the beginning of the}} show or the end of Season 3. To have it happen in the middle of your first season is an interesting kind of riddle". The writers worked to establish a [...] "regular day at S.H.I.E.L.D." [...] and the existing hierarchy, and then [...] "to blow that up, we knew the way to best illustrate that was by putting it on a personal level with our main man Coulson". Tancharoen elaborated that [...] "We see what it actually looks like for S.H.I.E.L.D. to crumble in Captain America 2, we see the Helicarriers literally <b>barreling</b> through the Triskelion, we see the massive destruction throughout the city, but the benefit of our show is we get to dive into the emotional toll of that." [...] Therefore, it was decided at the beginning of the series that one of the main characters would be a traitor, with Jed Whedon saying [...] "since this is an infiltration based on betrayal on a massive scale, we wanted to have it on the small scale, and have it be a really personal dagger to the heart." ...|$|E

50|$|The MG 3 has a quick-change, chrome-lined <b>barrel</b> {{with four}} {{right-hand}} grooves and a rifling twist rate of 1 in 305 mm (1:12 in). Alternatively, MG 3 <b>barrels</b> {{can also have}} polygonal rifling. The <b>barrel</b> is integrated with the <b>barrel</b> breech. During sustained firing, {{there is a need}} for the <b>barrel</b> to be changed and this is how they are swapped: The gun is cocked and the <b>barrel</b> catch on the right of the <b>barrel</b> shroud is swung forward. Then, the breech end of the hot <b>barrel</b> swings out and can be removed by elevating or twisting the gun. A fresh <b>barrel</b> would be inserted through the <b>barrel</b> catch and the muzzle bearing. When the catch is rotated back, the <b>barrel</b> is locked and the machine gun can resume firing.

5000|$|Another, less {{commonly}} encountered type of break-action shotgun is {{the combination}} gun, which is an over and under design with one shotgun <b>barrel</b> and one rifle <b>barrel</b> (more often rifle on top, but rifle on bottom was not uncommon).

Rick accuses Axel and Oscar of the treachery, but an alarm begins sounding due to activation of a backup generator, potentially drawing more walkers. Rick realizes the prisoners cannot be at fault and lets them lead him to the generator room. There they find Andrew (Markice Moore), whom Rick had left for dead, as the instigator. Andrew is about to kill Rick when Oscar shoots him, and then turns the gun over to Rick. They stop the generator and disable the alarm.|$|E
60|$|The {{arrangements}} described {{were completed}} {{by the end of}} the first fortnight, during which period the business of sealing was also carried on with great industry and success. So very tame were the victims, and so totally unconscious of the danger they incurred from the presence of man, that the crew moved round among them, seemingly but very little observed, and not at all molested. The utmost care was taken to give no unnecessary alarm; and when an animal was lanced, it was done in such a quiet way as to produce as little commotion as possible. By the end of the time named, however, the sealing had got so advanced as to require the aid of all hands in securing the spoils. To work, then, everybody went, with a hearty good-will: and the shelf of rock just below the house was soon well garnished with casks and skins. Had the labour been limited to the mere killing, and skinning, and curing, and <b>barreling</b> of oil, it would have been comparatively quite light; but the necessity of transporting the fruits of all this skill and luck considerable distances, in some cases several miles, and this over broken rocks, formed the great obstacle to immediate success. It was the opinion of Roswell Gardiner, that he could have filled his schooner in a month, were it possible to place her directly alongside of the rocks frequented by the seals, and prevent all this toil in transporting. This, however, was impossible, the waves and the ice rendering it certain destruction to lay a craft anywhere along the northern shore of the island. The boats might be, and occasionally they were used, bringing loads of skin and oil round the cape, quite into the cove. These little cargoes were immediately transferred to the hold of the schooner, a ground-tier of large casks having been left in her purposely to receive the oil, which was emptied into them by means of a hose. By the end of the third week, this ground-tier was filled, and the craft became stiff, and was in good ballast trim, although the spare water was now entirely pumped out of her.|$|E

50|$|Rarer {{were the}} {{drillings}} that used two rifle <b>barrels</b> {{and a single}} shotgun <b>barrel.</b> These were harder to make, since, like a double rifle, the rifle <b>barrels</b> must be very carefully regulated, that is, aligned during manufacture to shoot to the same point of aim at a given distance. This requires more precision than regulation of double-barreled shotgun <b>barrels,</b> which are used at shorter ranges with wide patterns of shot where a small misalignment won't be significant. If the rifle <b>barrels</b> were the same caliber, then the three <b>barrels</b> were generally arranged in a triangle, both rifle <b>barrels</b> on top, or one rifle and the shotgun <b>barrel</b> on top (this being known as a cross-eyed drilling). If the rifle <b>barrels</b> differed in caliber, generally the layout would be an over/under using the shotgun and a centerfire rifle <b>barrel,</b> with a rimfire rifle <b>barrel</b> mounted between and to one side. These configuration, with shotgun/centerfire/rimfire <b>barrels,</b> are the most desirable configuration for modern collectors.|$|R
