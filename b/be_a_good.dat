5|$|Active duty {{officers}} in the rank of captain or major serve as Company Tactical Officers (TAC Officers). The role of the TAC is to mentor, train, and teach the cadets proper standards of good order and discipline and <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> role model. There is one TAC for every cadet company. There is also one senior Non-Commissioned Officer to assist each TAC, known as TAC-NCOs.|$|E
5|$|At an {{unscheduled}} session, Albert expresses {{his frustration}} that while his speech has improved when talking to most people, he still stammers when talking to David and reveals {{the extent of}} Edward VIII's folly with Simpson. When Lionel insists that Bertie could <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> king, Bertie accuses Lionel of speaking treason and quits Lionel. Bertie must face the Ascension Council without any assistance from Lionel.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} the palace was destroyed, {{separation}} of crown and state had become important, with Parliament being necessary to control military requirements and pass laws.

5|$|David Jenkins, who was {{a student}} and {{assistant}} to Parry at Aberystwyth, described him as impulsive and unable to criticise his own works, too erratic to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> conductor and too impatient for all but advanced students, but with a boyish enthusiasm, especially for music. Sir Alexander Mackenzie, who also worked with Parry, also noted his great enthusiasm and described {{him as a man}} of great musical ability.|$|E
5|$|His earlier {{insistence on}} not filming with live {{ammunition}} proved to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> decision. Having been told while filming Angels with Dirty Faces {{that he would}} be doing a scene with real machine gun bullets (a common practice in the Hollywood of the time), Cagney refused and insisted the shots be added afterwards. As it turned out, a ricocheting bullet passed through exactly where his head would have been.|$|E
5|$|In the 1850s, Stonehenge {{recommended}} {{a cross between}} a Beagle and a Scottish Terrier as a retriever. He found the crossbreed to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> worker, silent and obedient, but it had the drawback that it was small and could barely carry a hare.|$|E

5|$|A {{team from}} the Keck Observatory in Hawaii {{announced}} in 2006 that it had measured {{the density of the}} binary Jupiter trojan 617 Patroclus as being less than that of water ice (0.8g/cm3), suggesting that the pair, and possibly many other Trojan objects, more closely resemble comets or Kuiper belt objects in composition—water ice with a layer of dust—than they do the main-belt asteroids. Countering this argument, the density of Hektor as determined from its rotational lightcurve (2.480g/cm3) is significantly higher than that of 617 Patroclus. Such a difference in densities suggests that density may not <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> indicator of asteroid origin.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{marriage}} had been strained from the beginning, Teresa Cristina continued striving to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> wife. Her constancy toward fulfilling her duty, {{along with the}} birth of children, softened PedroII's attitude. The two discovered shared interests, and their concern for and delight in their children created a sense of family happiness. That they were sexually active and compatible is witnessed by the series of pregnancies which ensued. After the birth of their first son in February 1845, the Empress bore children in July 1846, July 1847, and July 1848—named Afonso, Isabel, Leopoldina and Pedro, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Brown entered Massillon Washington High School in 1922. Although {{he played}} {{football}} as a child, Brown was undersized {{for the game}} at less than 150 pounds and at first focused his athletic energies on the pole vault. Harry Stuhldreher, {{who went on to}} be one of Notre Dame's legendary Four Horsemen, was then the high school quarterback. But Massillon coach Dave Stewart saw Brown's determination to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> vaulter despite his small size and brought him onto the football team; as a junior in 1924, he took over as the starting quarterback. Massillon posted a win-loss record of 15–3 in Brown's junior and senior years as the starter.|$|E

5|$|Brown {{had also}} speculated that Persephone, {{the wife of}} the god Pluto, would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> name for the object. The name had been used several times in science fiction, and was popular with the public, having handily won a poll {{conducted}} by New Scientist magazine ("Xena", despite only being a nickname, came fourth). This was not possible once the object was classified as a dwarf planet, because there is already an asteroid with that name, 399 Persephone.|$|E
5|$|During a {{visit to}} Pompeii, he lost his passport, {{and went back to}} the amphitheatre he had visited earlier in the day in order to find it. Walking around the deserted ruins, he thought the silence and natural ambient sounds present would make a good {{backdrop}} for the music. He also felt that filming the band without an audience would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> reaction to earlier films such as Woodstock and Gimme Shelter, where the films paid equal attention to performers and spectators. One of Maben's contacts at the University of Naples, a professor who was a Pink Floyd fan, managed to persuade the local authorities to close the amphitheatre for six days that October for filming.|$|E
5|$|Goldilocks's fate {{varies in}} the many retellings: in some versions, she runs into the forest, in some she is almost eaten by the bears but her mother rescues her, in some she vows to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> child, and in some she returns home. Whatever her fate, Goldilocks fares better than Southey's vagrant old woman who, in his opinion, {{deserved}} {{a stint in the}} House of Correction, and far better than Miss Mure's old woman who is impaled upon a steeple in St Paul's church-yard.|$|E

5|$|Governor David Paterson's {{selection}} process {{began with a}} number of prominent names and high-ranking New York Democrats, including Andrew Cuomo, Fran Drescher and Caroline Kennedy, vying for the spot. Gillibrand quietly campaigned for the position, meeting secretly with Paterson on at least one occasion. She said that she made an effort to underscore her successful House elections in a largely conservative district, adding that she could <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> complement to Chuck Schumer.

5|$|In the Enchanted Forest, a young pickpocket named Jiminy desires {{the chance}} to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> person, but is forced by his father (Harry Groener) and mother (Carolyn Hennesy) to {{participate}} in their cons. After he finishes collecting some stolen goods, Jiminy tells them that he desires to leave the family business. Unfortunately, as years go by, the now-adult Jiminy (Raphael Sbarge) is still aiding his parents, who come up with excuses {{to keep him from}} leaving. He runs into a young boy who tells him to follow his conscience. One night, Jiminy pays a visit to see Rumpelstiltskin (Robert Carlyle) and is given a tonic that will set him free from his parents and is told to either have them drink it or throw it over them.|$|E
