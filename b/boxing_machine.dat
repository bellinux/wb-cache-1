40|$|Explaining the {{behavior}} of a black <b>box</b> <b>machine</b> learning model at the instance level is useful for building trust. However, what is also important is understanding how the model behaves globally. Such an understanding provides insight into both the data on which the model was trained and the generalization power of the rules it learned. We present here an approach that learns rules to explain globally {{the behavior}} of black <b>box</b> <b>machine</b> learning models. Collectively these rules represent the logic learned by the model and are hence useful for gaining insight into its behavior. We demonstrate the power of the approach on three publicly available data sets...|$|R

40|$|We apply {{methods of}} {{multiple}} kernel learning {{to the problem}} of system identification for multi-dimensional temporal data. Rather than building a full probabilistic model, we take a computationally simple approach that uses out of the <b>box</b> <b>machine</b> learning methods. We attempt to learn the covariance function of a stochastic process via multiple kernel learning. We achieve promising preliminary results and the work suggests an abundance of future theoretical work. We hope to draw on the theory of SVM methods to give a principled learning theory style description of system identification in stochastic processes. ...|$|R
5000|$|A {{closely related}} design is a coin {{snatching}} black <b>box</b> <b>machine</b> called [...] "The Thing". It activates when a conductive metal coin {{is placed in}} a holder. The box begins to whir and vibrate, then a small plastic hand slowly emerges from under a trapdoor. The hand snatches the coin, pulls it in, and slams the door shut, ending the performance. It {{can be argued that}} this machine is not strictly useless, acting as a type of piggy bank, in a way that acts like a Rube Goldberg machine.|$|R

40|$|Automatic post-editors (APEs) {{enable the}} re-use of black <b>box</b> <b>machine</b> {{translation}} (MT) systems {{for a variety}} of tasks where different aspects of translation are impor-tant. In this paper, we describe APEs that target adequacy errors, a critical problem for tasks such as cross-lingual question-answering, and compare different approaches for post-editing: a rule-based system and a feedback approach that uses a computer in the loop to suggest improve-ments to the MT system. We test the APEs on two different MT systems and across two different genres. Human evaluation shows that the APEs significantly improve adequacy, regardless of approach, MT sys-tem or genre: 30 - 56 % of the post-edited sentences have improved adequacy com-pared to the original MT. ...|$|R
50|$|The rapidly {{expanding}} citrus industry also stimulated the capital market for real estate. As the industry grew, land {{which had been}} regarded as worthless dramatically increased value. Not only did orange culture feed the land boom of the 1880s in Southern California; it allowed Riverside to survive when the land boom collapsed in 1888. (See also: Panic of 1893.) The success of Tibbets' orange stimulated related industries. Citrus built {{the foundations of the}} region's economic modernization before the great flood of defense funds began in World War II. Tibbets' introduction of the Washington navel orange was largely responsible for the fruit packing houses, inventions in <b>boxing</b> <b>machines,</b> fruit wraps and the iced railroad car.|$|R
50|$|Following {{the defeat}} of the German Empire in World War I, {{military}} commanders from the Reichswehr began to consider how mobile armored artillery units could provide support to advancing infantry units. Colonel Erich von Manstein recommended the concept of infantry Begleitbatterien (escort batteries) to General Beck, chief of the general staff in 1935. Manstein theorized the vehicle would not be used as one uses a tank, but rather as an infantry support vehicle to destroy fortified objectives through direct fire. Its mission was to destroy prepared defensive works, pill <b>boxes,</b> <b>machine</b> gun emplacements and tanks. It was not intended to be used to exploit breakthroughs and drive into the enemy rear areas, as the Panzertruppen units were intended to do.|$|R

40|$|Mapping {{resolution}} {{has recently}} {{been identified as a}} key limitation in successfully locating the drivers of atrial fibrillation. Using a simple cellular automata model of atrial fibrillation, we demonstrate a method by which re-entrant drivers can be located quickly and accurately using a collection of indirect electrogram measurements. The method proposed employs simple, out of the <b>box</b> <b>machine</b> learning algorithms to correlate characteristic electrogram gradients with the displacement of an electrogram recording from a re-entrant driver. Such a method is less sensitive to local fluctuations in electrical activity. As a result, the method successfully locates 95. 4 % of drivers in tissues containing a single driver, and 94. 8 % (92. 5 %) for the first (second) driver in tissues containing two drivers of atrial fibrillation. Additionally, we demonstrate how the technique can be applied to tissues with an arbitrary number of drivers. Extending the technique for use in clinical practice could alleviate the limitations in current ablation techniques that arise from limited mapping resolution...|$|R
50|$|Introduced in August 1981, the IBM Personal Computer would {{eventually}} supplant CP/M {{as the standard}} platform used in business. This was {{largely due to the}} IBM name and the system's 16 bit open architecture, which expanded maximum memory tenfold, and also encouraged production of third-party clones. In the late 1970s, the 6502-based Apple II series had carved out a niche for itself in business, thanks to the industry's first killer app, VisiCalc, released in 1979. However the Apple II would quickly be displaced for office use by IBM PC compatibles running Lotus 1-2-3. Apple Computer's 1980 Apple III was underwhelming, and although the 1984 release of the Apple Macintosh introduced the modern GUI to the market, it wasn't common until IBM-compatible computers adopted it. Throughout the 1980s, businesses large and small adopted the PC platform, leading, {{by the end of the}} decade, to sub-US$1000 IBM PC XT-class white <b>box</b> <b>machines,</b> usually built in Asia and sold by US companies like PCs Limited.|$|R

40|$|A 100 m high {{gravity dam}} (Castrovido dam, Burgos, Spain) {{is founded on}} a soft Weald red {{siltstone}} with interbedded sandstone strata. Dam stability is essentially controlled by the available shear strength of sedimentation planes. Block samples were recovered for {{the different types of}} contact identified.

40|$|We {{report on}} the first-ever {{demonstration}} of grinding and polishing full-size, off-axis aspheric, mirror segments as prototypes for an extremely large telescope, processed entirely in the final hexagonal shape. We first describe the overall strategy for controlling form and mid spatial frequencies, at levels {{in the vicinity of}} < 10 nm RMS surface. This relies first on direct CNC grinding of the base-form of these 1. 4 m segments, using the Cranfield <b>Box</b> <b>machine.</b> The segments are then mounted on a custom designed (Optic Glyndwr Optoelectronic Engineering Group) three segment hydraulic support, and CNC polished on a Zeeko IRP 1600 machine using a variety of custom tooling. We overview the fullaperture and sub-aperture metrology techniques used to close the process-loop and certify quality, all of which operate with the segment in-situ on the IRP 1600. We then focus on the pristine edge-definition achieved by the combination of tool-lift and smoothing operations; results never previously demonstrated on full-size pre-cut hexagonal segments. Finally, the paper discusses the feasibility of scaling the process to deliver 931 segments in seven years, as required for the E-ELT project...|$|R
