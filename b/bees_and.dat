50|$|The National History <b>Bee</b> <b>and</b> Bowl (NHBB) are {{nationwide}} history quiz competitions {{for high}} school, middle school, and elementary {{students in the}} United States. Both the National History <b>Bee</b> <b>and</b> the National History Bowl were contested {{for the first time}} in the 2010-2011 academic year. Students first compete at regional qualifying tournaments, from which the top students advance to the National Championships for the History <b>Bee</b> <b>and</b> History Bowl, which are held each spring. The competitions were founded in June 2010 by David Madden, a former 19-day champion on Jeopardy!, who serves as Executive Director for both The National History <b>Bee</b> <b>and</b> The National History Bowl. At high school level tournaments of the National History <b>Bee</b> <b>and</b> Bowl, students also have the opportunity to compete in the National Qualifying Exam of the United States Geography Olympiad. Beginning in the fall of 2013, NHBB also introduced the United States History Bee, a competition for high school students focusing solely on American history.|$|R

5|$|A wasp is any insect of {{the order}} Hymenoptera and {{suborder}} Apocrita that is neither a bee nor an ant. The Apocrita have a common evolutionary ancestor and form a clade; wasps as a group do not form a clade, but are paraphyletic with respect to <b>bees</b> <b>and</b> ants.|$|E

5|$|According to the USDA, {{pesticides}} may {{be contributing}} to CCD. A 2013 peer-reviewed literature review concluded neonicotinoids in the amounts typically used harm <b>bees</b> <b>and</b> safer alternatives are urgently needed.

5|$|Another {{proposed}} {{remedy for}} farmers of pollinated crops {{is simply to}} switch from using beekeepers {{to the use of}} native bees, such as bumble <b>bees</b> <b>and</b> mason bees. Native bees can be helped to establish themselves by providing suitable nesting locations and some additional crops the bees could use to feed from (e.g. when the pollination season of the commercial crops on the farm has ended).|$|E
5|$|As {{their name}} suggests, bee-eaters {{predominantly}} eat flying insects, especially <b>bees</b> <b>and</b> wasps, which {{are caught in}} the air by flights from an open perch. The stinger is removed by repeatedly hitting and rubbing the insect on a hard surface. During this process, pressure is applied to the insect, thereby extracting most of the venom.|$|E
5|$|During {{the spring}} of 2015, President Barack Obama {{unveiled}} the very first national strategy for improving the health of <b>bees</b> <b>and</b> other key pollinators. The plan calls for restoring 7 million acres of bee habitat {{with a variety of}} different flowering plants for bees to gather nectar from. The administration is also proposing spending $82.5 million for honey bee research.|$|E
50|$|In 2016, Madden {{founded the}} United States Academic <b>Bee</b> <b>and</b> Bowl, the National Science <b>Bee,</b> <b>and</b> the National Humanities Bee, {{all of which}} are {{currently}} directed at students in eighth grade and younger.

5|$|Foreign {{animals are}} also found, {{in common with}} much of Adelaide. While red foxes, cats, European rabbits, black rats, house mice and European hares are seen, {{there has been no}} {{systemic}} recording of alien fauna species. Exotic birds, including rock pigeons, European goldfinch, house sparrow, starlings and blackbirds are common. Introduced <b>bees</b> <b>and</b> European wasps are present, with the aggressive wasps an issue for the park's visitors.|$|E
5|$|Most other bees, {{including}} familiar insects such as carpenter bees, leafcutter <b>bees</b> <b>and</b> mason {{bees are}} solitary {{in the sense}} that every female is fertile, and typically inhabits a nest she constructs herself. There is no division of labor so these nests lack queens and worker bees for these species. Solitary bees typically produce neither honey nor beeswax.|$|E
5|$|Records {{of visits}} by pollinators exist {{for only a}} few species, but most of these suggest that the species are pollinated by insects. Flowers of A.chiribogensis produce small {{quantities}} of nectar, but lack a scent. Fruit flies (Drosophilidae), fungus gnats (Mycetophilidae, Sciaridae), midges (Cecidomyiidae, Ceratopogonidae) and micromoths (Lepidoptera) were recorded visiting these flowers, but <b>bees</b> <b>and</b> hover flies were not. Aiphanes eggersii was thought to be pollinated by <b>bees</b> <b>and</b> possibly by wind. Fruit flies (Drosophilidae), hover flies (Syrphidae), biting midges (Ceratopogonidae) and leaf beetles (Chrysomelidae) were recorded visiting the flowers of A.erinacea, but bees were not. Aiphanes horrida was reportedly pollinated by wind, bees (Meliponidae), weevils (Curculionidae) and bugs (Hemiptera). Flies and weevils were observed on the flowers of A.simplex.|$|E

5|$|Some {{substances}} {{which are}} toxic to humans {{have no effect}} on bees. If bees obtain their nectar from certain flowers, the resulting honey can be psychoactive, or even toxic to humans, but innocuous to <b>bees</b> <b>and</b> their larvae. Poisoning from this honey is called mad honey disease.|$|E
5|$|The brightly {{coloured}} bracts act as petals {{to attract}} insects such as hoverflies, native <b>bees,</b> <b>and</b> small beetles that pollinate the florets. Grasshoppers also visit the flower heads. The caterpillars of Tebenna micalis {{have been recorded}} on this species, as have those of the Australian painted lady (Vanessa kershawi). The tiny fruits are dispersed by wind, and germinate and grow after fire or on disturbed ground.|$|E
5|$|A 1988 {{field study}} found that most flowers of B.serrata opened at night, and {{recorded}} the brown antechinus (Antechinus stuartii), sugar glider (Petaurus breviceps), eastern pygmy possum (Cercartetus nanus), and bush rat (Rattus fuscipes) as nocturnal mammalian visitors and pollinators. Other mammals recorded eating the flowers include the grey-headed flying fox (Pteropus poliocephalus), little red flying fox (P. scapulatus) and common blossom bat (Syconycteris australis). Banksia serrata is a host plant for the larval and adult stages of the banksia jewel beetle (Cyrioides imperialis). Native <b>bees</b> <b>and</b> European honey bees visit the flowers.|$|E
