2500|$|On August 22, 1960, the Cardinals traded Lane to the Detroit Lions in {{exchange}} for lineman Gerry Perry. Lions great Joe Schmidt later called it [...] "one of the greatest trades that will ever be made in any sport." [...] At {{the time of the}} trade, Lions head coach George Wilson noted: [...] "He has a reputation as a gambler. We are aware of that <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>still</b> <b>has</b> speed and experience." ...|$|E
2500|$|While at Mainz, Voronin {{was called}} up {{initially}} to Ukraine's Under-21 team and in January 2002 {{to the national}} team, {{at the age of}} 22. He made his international debut in a 4–1 friendly defeat to Romania in March 2002. However, he was dropped after that match, with coach Leonid Buriak explaining, [...] "I've been to Germany twice to watch him and made a conclusion that Andriy cannot compete with [...] Shevchenko, [...] Rebrov, and [...] Vorobei as a forward. He can play in midfield as well, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>still</b> <b>has</b> to improve some aspects of his game. Anyway, we count on Voronin, especially considering his young age." ...|$|E
2500|$|Milhouse and Bart loosen every bolt {{and screw}} in Springfield Elementary, leading to mass chaos when the {{building}} and its contents fall apart. Milhouse is apprehended by Principal Skinner, is suspended from school for a week (and subsequently grounded). Bart, whose involvement with the prank was not discovered, promises to visit Milhouse every day. Homer drops Bart off at Springfield Retirement Castle to visit Grandpa. There, Bart is immediately smitten with a kind and charitable girl named Jenny. Bart makes {{a concerted effort to}} appear [...] "good" [...] to Jenny, demonstrating his newfound good nature by defending ducklings and eventually inviting Jenny over for dinner. However, Milhouse shows up on the Simpsons' doorstep and threatens to reveal Bart's true, dark nature because Bart forgot to visit him during his suspension. Milhouse begins appearing on Bart and Jenny's outings, each time hinting at Bart's misdeeds. Eventually, Bart confesses to Jenny that he was actually bad before he met her and only pretended to be good to start a relationship. He continues to say that he is changed completely because of being with her. Jenny, though momentarily pleased by Bart's honesty, realizes she cannot forgive or trust Bart, and angrily dumps him. At home, Bart cries, and Homer & Marge console and reassure him that girls come and go, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>still</b> <b>has</b> his family, only for him to cry even harder, and for Homer to shed tears too.|$|E
50|$|In {{his sophomore}} season, his {{production}} increased slightly <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>still</b> <b>had</b> a similar bench role to his freshman season. In 27 games, he averaged 2.4 points 2.3 rebounds and 1.0 blocks in 10.6 minutes per game.|$|R
50|$|Henry recompensed his allies, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>still</b> <b>had</b> {{to defend}} his {{interests}} {{in the kingdom of}} Castile and León. Consequently, he denied the King of Aragon the territories that he had promised him in the difficult times.|$|R
25|$|Gresham's {{production}} was reduced in 2013 as {{he found himself}} sharing the starting spot with rookie tight end Tyler Eifert, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>still</b> <b>had</b> a solid year, catching 46 passes for 461 yards and 4 touchdowns in 15 games.|$|R
2500|$|Edna Gundersen of USA Today said, Eminem [...] "recaptures [...] the {{original}} release's wild, clever, emotional brilliance {{in a flurry}} of caustic, brazenly honest, rapid-fire rhymes and aggressive beats". Sarah Rodman of The Boston Globe gave the album a positive review saying, [...] "If anything, the sequel is more intense than {{the original}}, as the Detroit rapper explodes like an M-80..... many memorable ones to be heard here, as Eminem doubles down on his manic flow, bursting with analogies, jokes, illusions, and ingenious wordplay with dizzying speed and skill". Dan Rys of XXL gave the album a rating of XL saying, [...] "the thing that carries Em through is the diversity of his flows, and his ability to rap over anything ..... you're getting one with more perspective, a version which has seen 13 more years and has a different outlook on some of the same topics that he first visited in 2000". Evan Rytlewski of The A.V. Club gave the album a B rating, saying [...] "after years of stagnancy and tedious anger, he shows real growth on The Marshall Mathers LP. Eminem has always rapped with forceful determination out of compulsive drives to prove himself to doubters, cut down his enemies, and retain his commercial foothold. For the first time in far too long, he sounds like he's rapping because he enjoys it, too." [...] Jon Carmanica of The New York Times gave the album a positive review saying, [...] "His lyrics are best viewed under a microscope..... to see how he gets from one rhyme to the next in unexpected ways..... he'll dominate almost any sound..... <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>still</b> <b>has</b> some old habits, still heavy-handed with homophobic slurs..... Eminem is still rapping from deep inside his cave, as if he's had no new experiences to draw from." [...] David Jeffries of AllMusic spoke of the album saying, it is a [...] "vicious, infectious, hilarious triumph..... a super villain so familiar with hate and depression, he's powered by all shades of anger ..... most of the best moments on MMLP2 are just as angry and just as irresponsible..... Eminem at his very best." [...] Luke Fox of Exclaim! gave the album an eight out ten rating praising the albums [...] "astounding wordplay and creative beat choices".|$|E
60|$|Through {{all this}} chaos, then {{we come back}} once more to our main conclusion. The true task of culture to-day is not a task of expansion, but very decidedly of selection--and rejection. The educationist must find a creed and teach it. Even if it be not a {{theological}} creed, it must still be as fastidious and as firm as theology. In short, it must be orthodox. The teacher may think it antiquated to have to decide precisely between the faith of Calvin and of Laud, the faith of Aquinas and of Swedenborg; <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>still</b> <b>has</b> {{to choose between the}} faith of Kipling and of Shaw, between the world of Blatchford and of General Booth. Call it, if you will, a narrow question whether your child shall be brought up by the vicar or the minister or the popish priest. You have still to face that larger, more liberal, more highly civilized question, of whether he shall be brought up by Harmsworth or by Pearson, by Mr. Eustace Miles with his Simple Life or Mr. Peter Keary with his Strenuous Life; whether he shall most eagerly read Miss Annie S. Swan or Mr. Bart Kennedy; in short, whether he shall end up in the mere violence of the S. D. F., or in the mere vulgarity of the Primrose League. They say that nowadays the creeds are crumbling; I doubt it, but at least the sects are increasing; and education must now be sectarian education, merely for practical purposes. Out of all this throng of theories it must somehow select a theory; out of all these thundering voices it must manage to hear a voice; out of all this awful and aching battle of blinding lights, without one shadow to give shape to them, it must manage somehow to trace and to track a star.|$|E
60|$|With the {{acceptance}} by England of the German Insurance Act, I bring this {{sketch of the}} past relations {{of the two countries}} to an end. I have written this book because I wish, once and for all, to be done with my friend Professor Whirlwind of Prussia, who has long despaired of really defending his own country, and has fallen back upon abusing mine. He has dropped, amid general derision, his attempt to call a thing right when even the Chancellor who did it called it wrong. But he has an idea that if he can show that somebody from England somewhere did another wrong, the two wrongs may make a right. Against the cry of the Roman Catholic Poles the Prussian has never done, or even pretended to do, anything but harden his heart; but he has (such are the lovable inconsistencies of human nature) a warm corner in his heart for the Roman Catholic Irish. He has not a word to say for himself about the campaign in Belgium, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>still</b> <b>has</b> many wise, reproachful words to utter about the campaign in South Africa. I propose to take those words out of his mouth. I will {{have nothing to do with}} the fatuous front-bench pretensions that our governors always govern well, that our statesmen are never whitewashed and never in need of whitewash. The only moral superiority I claim is that of not defending the indefensible. I most earnestly urge my countrymen not to hide behind thin official excuses, which the sister kingdoms and the subject races can easily see through. We can confess that our crimes have been as mountains, and still not be afraid of the present comparison. There may be, in the eyes of some, a risk in dwelling in this dark hour on our failures in the past: I believe profoundly that the risk is all the other way. I believe that the most deadly danger to our arms to-day lies in any whiff of that self-praise, any flavour of that moral cowardice, any glimpse of that impudent and ultimate impenitence, that may make one Boer or Scot or Welshman or Irishman or Indian feel that he is only smoothing the path for a second Prussia. I have passed the great part of my life in criticising and condemning the existing rulers and institutions of my country: I think it is infinitely the most patriotic thing that a man can do. I have no illusions either about our past or our present. I think our whole history in Ireland has been a vulgar and ignorant hatred of the crucifix, expressed by a crucifixion. I think the South African War was a dirty work which we did under the whips of moneylenders. I think Mitchelstown was a disgrace; I think Denshawi was a devilry.|$|E
50|$|Mieszko II {{regained the}} full power, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>still</b> <b>had</b> {{to fight against}} the nobility and his own subjects. It should be noted that in Poland his {{renunciation}} to the Royal crown wasn't counted, and after 1032, in the chronicles, <b>he</b> was <b>still</b> called King.|$|R
60|$|No, Hoodoo, {{it was not}} {{precisely}} adventures. It was a small family Bible. Hoodoo had now seen all his presents, and he arose and dressed. <b>But</b> <b>he</b> <b>still</b> <b>had</b> the fun of playing with his toys. That is always the chief delight of Christmas morning.|$|R
50|$|As the Second World War {{came to an}} end, Frankfurter {{applied for}} a pardon on 27 February 1945, which was granted on 1 June, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>still</b> <b>had</b> {{to leave the country}} and pay {{restitution}} and court costs. In 1969, the cantonal parliament of Graubünden revoked the expulsion.|$|R
50|$|In January 2011, {{he joined}} Serie A club Cesena {{for a trial}} period, but {{transferred}} to Girona FC in the Segunda División instead, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>still</b> <b>has</b> a valid contract with 1860.|$|E
50|$|In March 2011, Charlie starts {{an affair}} with Echo DiSavoy. He knows it is wrong, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>still</b> <b>has</b> sex with her because he feels {{something}} more powerful than his and Viki's marriage.|$|E
50|$|Puzzle: Orange Popple {{who is more}} or {{less the}} bookworm of the bunch. He enjoys reading and is quite intelligent, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>still</b> <b>has</b> a great sense of humor. Puzzle is also shown to be a good swimmer. Puzzle {{appeared}} in 15 episodes.|$|E
50|$|Jeffers new {{contract}} {{made him the}} highest paid wide receiver on the Carolina Panthers roster, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>still</b> <b>had</b> to work {{his way into the}} starting lineup. He played in 15 games (10 starts) and had a breakout season, registering 63 receptions for 1,082 yards (17.2 yards avg.) and 12 touchdowns.|$|R
50|$|Bobby {{finds the}} bunny form embarrassing. Furthermore {{the longer he}} stays in that form, the more {{difficult}} it is to form the essential mental image of his original form to change back. This combination of concerns makes him most reluctant to use his superhero identity, <b>but</b> <b>he's</b> <b>still</b> <b>had</b> adventures as Thunderbunny.|$|R
50|$|In {{the year}} of 1910, Eaves put the {{faithful}} old horse, Maude, out to pasture and bought his first automobile, a Maxwell. He could make his house calls quicker, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>still</b> <b>had</b> the red mud and dust to contend with. He wore out many cars in his life as he rode over dirt roads.|$|R
50|$|Joseph {{settles down}} {{to wait for}} Budu to re-activate, and tells his {{recovering}} corpse his story.

It's a whole 'nother side of Cookie, where he's just kinda, you know, laid back and intellectual, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>still</b> <b>has</b> that 'Me Alistair Cookie,' and it's {{just such a}} funny contrast." ...|$|E
2500|$|As a young graduate, Henslow had geologised on the Isle of Wight and the Isle of Man, and he too had {{longed to}} visit Africa. Marriage and his {{position}} at the university now made the prospect remote, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>still</b> <b>had</b> an unfulfilled ambition to [...] "explore regions but little known, and enrich science with new species." ...|$|R
50|$|Following {{the move}} to the new cottage, Fowler was allowed more freedom of movement, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>still</b> <b>had</b> to hide {{whenever}} the Germans approached, and at night. Fowler was eventually reunited with the 11th Hussars who evacuated Bertry on 10 October 1918. Fowler was then able to explain to his regiment why he was absent for four years without being charged for desertion.|$|R
50|$|In March 1962, Carson {{was asked}} to take over from Jack Paar on The Tonight Show, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>still</b> <b>had</b> six months {{remaining}} on his contract with ABC.

The series continued until December 27, 1963.|$|R
50|$|Because of his naïvety and unfaithfulness, he and Xia Xiong's {{marriage}} ended years ago, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>still</b> <b>has</b> {{feelings for}} her as demonstrated by his interference with Xia Xiong's dates.

Damon presents Stefan with his diaries to jog his memory with, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>still</b> <b>has</b> no recollection of his past.|$|E
5000|$|Morella tells Londo {{that his}} destiny {{to become an}} Emperor is unavoidable, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>still</b> <b>has</b> a chance to save himself from damnation.

50|$|In under a year, Rosenberger {{developed}} {{a quick and}} inexpensive test {{for the presence of}} linen in a garment, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>still</b> <b>had</b> to overcome the hurdle of convincing the Orthodox Jewish community of the importance of checking for shatnes. Rosenberger was often booted out of synagogues and assembly halls with derision by the public who did not believe him to be genuine.|$|R
50|$|In 1831, Dunn was {{appointed}} viewer by the Hetton Coal Company, Durham, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>still</b> <b>had</b> freelance work, {{which led to}} tensions with management.

5000|$|Music critic Mark Deming of Allmusic {{praised the}} album and wrote [...] "Tooth of Crime is a smart, absorbing, and beautifully disquieting {{collection}} of songs {{that could have}} come from no one else but T Bone Burnett, and it shows that one of America's best songwriters may be working at a very deliberate pace <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>still</b> <b>has</b> some remarkable things left to tell us." ...|$|E

50|$|In 1837 Elliott's {{business}} {{suffered from}} the trade recession that year and he lost {{a great deal of}} money. <b>But</b> <b>he</b> <b>still</b> <b>had</b> enough to retire in 1841 and settle on land he had bought at Great Houghton, near Barnsley.

5000|$|In Spring {{training}} 1991, the Dodgers {{experimented with}} Javier at third base, {{but the idea}} was abandoned {{by the time the}} season started.

50|$|He {{may be one}} of {{the early}} evicted {{competitors}} in the said competition, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>still</b> <b>had</b> a chance to be more active on television compared to some of his contemporaries.
