40|$|In this cadaver study, we {{compared}} 2 different acetabular cement pressurizers (Exeter and Bernoski type) in paired human acetabula with simulated intraosseous <b>bleeding.</b> <b>Pressure</b> transducers {{were used to}} record intra-acetabular pressures during pressurization. Anteroposterior radiographs of the entire specimens were taken. Subsequently, standardized 3 -mm-thick sections were cut through the acetabula, which were then microradiographed to evaluate cement penetration. Adequate pressurization was obtained with either pressurizer. The peak and sustained pressures obtained with the Exeter pressurizer (peak, 80 kPa; sustained, 38 kPa) tended {{to be higher than}} the pressures obtained with the Bernoski pressurizer (73 kPa; 24 kPa; P > 0. 05).

40|$|Background There are {{few studies}} {{on the effect of}} {{acetabular}} cup design on cement penetration. Material and methods We evaluated the effects of an acetabular flange on cement pressurization and cement penetration in 12 cadavers. Flanged or unflanged cups were implanted in paired human acetabula with simulated intraosseous <b>bleeding</b> <b>pressure</b> but without cement pressurization before insertion of the cup. Three pressure transducers were used to record intra-acetabular peak and average pressures during cup insertion. Following implantation, the whole specimens were AP-radiographed and standardized sections through the acetabula were microradiographed to evaluate cement penetration. Results Flanged cups produced greater intra-acetabular peak pressures than unflanged cups, but did not increase the average intra-acetabular pressure. Cement penetration did not differ significantly between the two groups. Interpretation Our findings do not support the use of flanged cups as the sole means of cement pressurization in the acetabulum...|$|E

40|$|AbstractUterine fibroids (also called leiomyomas or myomas) are {{the most}} common {{disorder}} among women of reproductive age, with an incidence of between 20 % and 80 %; they are often detected incidentally in routine healthy examinations, through bimanual pelvic and/or ultrasound examination, because uterine fibroids are rarely associated with symptoms. Sometimes, uterine fibroids may be complicated by a variety of symptoms, including menstrual disturbance (e. g., menorrhagia, dysmenorrhea, intermenstrual <b>bleeding),</b> <b>pressure</b> symptoms, bloated sensation, increased urinary frequency, bowel disturbance, or pelvic pain; therefore definite treatment is requested. Hysterectomy may be the first choice for women who have completed their child-birth; however, many women may prefer to keep the uterus if the uterine fibroids-related symptoms can be appropriately controlled. Among these conservative therapies, myomectomy {{may be one of the}} most popular methods for the woman who would like to preserve her future fertility, as the majority of symptoms can be relieved by myomectomy; this contributes to the value of this review. This review addresses the use of myomectomy in the management of symptomatic uterine fibroids...|$|E
40|$|Background : The {{function}} of the coronary arteries is to transport oxygenated blood to the heart muscle and if these arteries have been clogged due to fat plaque, patient has to undergo coronary angiography to determine the narrowing rate of coronary arteries and for this purpose, the left femoral artery is used. The aim {{of this research is}} to study the effect of pressure bandaging in reducing bleeding, bruising, back pain and groin pain in the patients undergoing coronary angiography. Materials and Methods: This quasi-experimental study was carried out on 100 patients undergoing coronary angiography in surgical and CCUwards of Shahid Rajaee hospital of Tehran and Khorramabad Shahid Madani hospital. Subjects were randomized to receive a pressure bandage(no= 50) or sand bag(no= 50) after manual compression of the femoral artery puncture site. Results: The patients without pressure bandages had a higher incidence of bleeding and bled earlier(p< 0 / 05) after catheter removal than the patients with bandages. The incidence and extent of bruising was the same in both groups of patients with sandbags experienced a higher incidence of back and groin pain. Conclusion: Thus, regarding the associated increase in patients, comfort, and delay in time of onset of <b>bleeding,</b> <b>pressure</b> bandages could be used routinely in the management of patients after coronary angiography...|$|E

40|$|Various control-volume models used {{to analyze}} the shock {{boundary}} layer bleed interaction were investigated. The bleed assumptions of the models and their influence on the analytical solutions are discussed.

The experimental Mach number upstream of the interaction was 1. 66, and the oblique-shock pressure ratio was 1. 33. The boundary layer data included bleed flow rates up to approximately 0. 6 of the upstream boundary layer mass flow rate. The first model assumed the bleed was removed from the control volume with a momentum that was characterized by a pressure intermediate between the upstream and downstream pressures. The second model assumed the control volume was bounded by a streamline dividing the bleed and residual flows and eliminated the need to specify the momentum of the bleed flow. Comparison of the results using the models showed that specifying the <b>bleed</b> <b>pressure</b> in one model was equivalent to specifying the pressure along the dividing streamline in the other...|$|R

40|$|An {{analytical}} bleed {{system design}} procedure {{is applied to}} a Mach 3. 5, axisymmetric, translating centerbody inlet. The design features a traveling centerbody bleed system with a ducting arrangement separating low-, medium-, and high-pressure bleed. Three forward plenums and nine throat plenums are installed on the centerbody to meet the bleed requirements in the started Mach range between 1. 6 and 3. 5. The cowl contains four stationary plenums, three for forward and one for throat bleed. To achieve maximum <b>bleed</b> plenum <b>pressure</b> and thereby minimize bleed drag all bleed holes are inclined 20 deg to the surface except in the cowl throat region. Here the requirement of high stability margin with minimum total pressure recovery penalty resulted in 90 deg bleed holes. The bleed hole diameter varies from bleed plenum to bleed plenum to achieve the most efficient boundary layer control, while the bleed exits are sized to operate at the highest possible plenum pressure without unchoking the bleed holes. Bleed flow rates, <b>bleed</b> plenum <b>pressures,</b> and boundary layer development along the cowl and centerbody are predicted over the entire started Mach range...|$|R

40|$|A new diffuser/permeator {{design has}} been {{proposed}} for a new Savannah River Site tritium project. The use of a single heater well {{in the center of}} the shell had raised concerns that the Pd/Ag coils may be shielding radiative heat transfer to the walls thus reducing Pd/Ag tube temperatures near the shell below the recommended minimum operating temperature. The diffuser was fitted with thermocouples to measure shell temperatures during testing. Tests were run with the shell evacuated, helium feed flows of 0, 1000, and 2000 sccm; <b>bleed</b> <b>pressures</b> ranging from 0 to 203 kPa, and heater temperatures of 650, 675, and 700 degrees C. Hydrogen permeation tests were run with two hydrogen/helium mixtures and feed rates to simulate 1 st and 2 nd stage diffuser operations. Approximately 20 hours were required to bring the diffuser from ambient temperature to steady-state conditions. For tests with a heater temperature of 675 degrees C and no hydrogen flow, helium flow rate and pressure had little impact on the measured shell temperatures, the thermowell temperature, roughly 415 degrees C, and altered heater output by only 11 watts. Conversely, controlling the thermowell temperature to 415 degrees C during hydrogen permeation tests increased heater power output, lowered heater temperature, and increased shell temperatures. The tests showed the diffuser can perform its intended function with reasonable assurance that the Pd/Ag tubes were within the recommended temperature range...|$|R
