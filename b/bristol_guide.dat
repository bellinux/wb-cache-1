40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{investigate}} the social adjustment in childhood {{of people who}} as adults have psychiatric disorders. DESIGN [...] Subjects in a prospectively followed up cohort (the national child development study) who had been admitted as adults to psychiatric hospitals were compared {{with the rest of}} the cohort on ratings of social behaviour made by teachers at the ages of 7 and 11 years. SUBJECTS [...] 40 adult patients with schizophrenic illnesses, 35 with affective psychoses, and 79 with neurotic illness who had been admitted for psychiatric reasons by the age of 28. 1914 randomly selected members of the cohort who had never been admitted for psychiatric treatment. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Overall scores and scores for overreaction (externalising behaviour) and underreaction (internalising behaviour) with the <b>Bristol</b> social adjustment <b>guide</b> at ages 7 and 11. RESULTS [...] At the age of 7 children who developed schizophrenia were rated by their teachers as manifesting more social maladjustment than controls (overall score 4. 3 (SD 2. 4) v 3. 1 (2. 0); P < 0. 01). This was more apparent in the boys (5 (2. 6)) than the girls (3. 4 (1. 8)) and related to overreactive rather than underreactive behaviour. At both ages prepsychotic (affective) children differed little from normal controls. By the age of 11 preneurotic children, particularly the girls, had an increased rating of maladjustment (including overreactions and underreactions). CONCLUSION [...] Abnormalities of social adjustment are detectable in childhood in some people who develop psychotic illness. Sex and the rate of development of different components of the capacity for social interaction are important determinants of the risk of psychosis and other psychiatric disorders in adulthood...|$|R
40|$|Background It {{is known}} that {{behavior}} in childhood is associated with certain {{physical and mental health}} problems in midlife. However, there is limited evidence on the role of childhood behavior problems in the development of hypertension in adulthood. The present study aimed to examine whether behavior problems in childhood influenced the risk of hypertension in midlife in the United Kingdom 1958 birth cohort. Methods The 1958 British birth cohort comprised 17, 638 individuals born {{in the first week of}} March 1958 in the United Kingdom. Behavior problems were assessed at 7, 11, and 16 years of age by parents and teachers. At age 45, blood pressure was measured and hypertension was recorded if blood pressure was ≥ 140 / 90 mm Hg or if the participants were informed by their health professionals that they had high blood pressure. Behavioral information was reported according to the Rutter Children's Behaviour Questionnaire (RCBQ) and the <b>Bristol</b> Social Adjustment <b>Guide</b> (BSAG). Odds ratios (ORs) and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated to examine behavior problems in childhood in relation to hypertension at 45 years of age according to logistic regression analysis, with adjustment for sex, social class in childhood and adulthood, childhood cognition, birth weight, gestational age at birth, body mass index (BMI), smoking, alcohol consumption, and physical activity. Results Behavior problems reported by parents at 7, 11, and 16 years were not associated with hypertension in midlife (OR, 0. 93; 95 % CI, 0. 81, 1. 07; OR, 0. 95; 95 % CI, 0. 81, 1. 11; OR, 0. 98; 95 % CI, 0. 85, 1. 12, respectively).

40|$|Factor-analytic methods {{founded on}} the multivariate linear model are often {{employed}} to scale behavior rating instruments. When items are scored as dichotomies and endorsements are skewed, the data violate the assumption of a multivariate normal distribution (MND). While the mathematical ramifications of such have been widely characterized, an empirical evaluation of MND- and non MND-based latent variable solution concordance has not been reported. This research investigated whether MND-based latent variable models employing previously-reported latent dimension extraction and item retention restrictions yielded a solution which was supported by two methods which do not assume a MND: (a) bi-factor analysis, and (b) latent class analysis. Standardization data of the <b>Bristol</b> Social Adjustment <b>Guides,</b> an instrument which evaluates social adjustment in school, were randomly divided into scaling (N = 1, 505) and confirmatory (N = 1, 000) samples. Scaling methods included: (a) first-order principal component analysis (PCA) and common factor analysis (CFA), (b) second-order CFA, and (c) confirmatory, oblique, principal-component cluster analysis. Bi-factor and latent class models evaluated the goodness-of-fit of confirmatory sample data to the item structure and behavior styles indicated via MND-based linear scaling. One solution comprising four first-order and two second-order latent dimensions, overactivity (OVER) and underactivity (UNDER), was derived and supported by both confirmatory methods. The bi-factor model was superior to simple structure for OVER and UNDER items, X 2 difference: OVER (39, N = 1, 000) = 67, p 3 ̆c. 005; and UNDER (33, N = 1, 000) = 100, p 3 ̆c. 005.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{identify}} {{health and}} socioeconomic factors in childhood that are precursors of unemployment in early adult {{life and to}} examine the hypothesis that young men who become unemployed {{are more likely to}} have accumulated risks to health during childhood. DESIGN: Longitudinal birth cohort study. The amount of unemployment experienced in early adult life up to age 32 years was the outcome measure used. Exposure measures to indicate vulnerability to future ill health were: height at age 7 years and the <b>Bristol</b> social adjustment <b>guide</b> (BSAG) at age 11 years, a measure of behavioural maladjustment. Socioeconomic measures were: social class at birth, crowding at age 7, qualifications attained before labour market entry, and region of residence. SETTING: Great Britain. SUBJECTS: Altogether 2256 men with complete data from the national child development study (NCDS). The NCDS has collected data on all men and women born in one week in 1958 and has followed them up using interviews, self completion questionnaires, and medical examinations at birth and at ages 7, 11, 16, 23 and 33 years. RESULTS: A total of 269 men (11. 9 %) experienced more than one year of unemployment between ages 22 and 32 years. Poor socioeconomic conditions in childhood and a lack of qualifications were associated with an increased risk of unemployment. Geographical region was also significant in determining the risk of unemployment. Men with short stature and poor social adjustment in childhood were more likely to experience unemployment in adult life, even after controlling for socioeconomic background, education, and parental height. These differences remained when those with chronic childhood illnesses were excluded from the analysis. The adjusted relative odds for experiencing more than one year of unemployment between ages 22 and 32 years for men who were in the top fifth of the BSAG distribution (most maladjusted) compared with those in the bottom fifth were 2. 36 (95 % CI 1. 49, 3. 73). The adjusted relative odds for experiencing more than one year of unemployment between ages 22 and 32 years for men who were in the bottom fifth of the distribution of height at age 7 years (indicating slowest growth) compared with those in the top fifth, were 2. 41 (95 % CI 1. 43, 4. 04). Adult height was not significantly associated with unemployment. CONCLUSION: The relationship between unemployment and poor health arises, in part, because men who become unemployed {{are more likely to have}} accumulated risks to health during childhood, reflected by slower growth and a greater tendency to behavioural maladjustment. Short stature in childhood is a significant indicator of poor socioeconomic circumstances in childhood and reflects earlier poor development...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of the}} Narrabundah Companionship {{programme}} was {{to provide}} young children ("Kids") from deprived cultural backgrounds with opportunities to learn appropriate social behaviours by pairing them with older students ("Companions") for activities involving social interactions. Unlike the typical work of the School Counsellor, which tends to be problem centered and crisis oriented, the Companionship programme {{is seen as a}} preventive activity which uses "peer helpers" as a means of extending the outreach services of the School Counsellor. The effects of this programme on the Companions, rather than on the Kids, was the focus of this study. The purposes of the present investigation were: a) to identify characteristics of A. C. T. secondary college students who volunteered to be Companions; b) to identify appropriate Companion selection procedures; c) to assess the effects of communications skills training on an initial group of Companions in comparison to late-entering Companions who did not receive such training; d) to assess the drives and sentiments which motivated college students to volunteer for the programme and to ascertain any changes in those drives and sentiments which might occur during the programme; e) to determine whether the Companionship experience influenced a change in vocational preference toward a career in social service; and, although not the major thrust of the study, f) to assess the effects of the Companionship experience on the Kids' social adjustment. After pilot programmes in 1978 and 1979, the present study was undertaken during Terms One and Two, 1980. Thirteen A. C. T. secondary college students volunteered to become Companions. Eleven A. C. T. primary school students and one junior secondary school student were selected to participate as Kids in the programme. Prior to active participation, volunteers completed the Kuder Preference Record - Vocational (Kuder) and the Motivation Analysis Test (MAT). The teachers of the Kids assessed them using the <b>Bristol</b> Social Adjustment <b>Guide</b> (BSAG) and completed a brief questionnaire to aid the Researcher in his pairing of Kids with Companions. The Companions attended six (1 1 / 2 hour) sessions of a communications skills training programme adapted from the Peer Counselling Student Training Course (Varenhorst & Hamburg, 1972). Based on perceptions formed during the training period, the Companions then rated each other using the Group Assessment of Interpersonal Traits (GAIT) developed by Goodman (1972). The Researcher also made a subjective ranking of each participant in relation to his perception of the individual's potential to be an effective Companion. Contrary to expectation, only two new Companions joined the programme at the beginning of Second Term. The Companionship activities terminated after two school terms, at which time all Kids were reassessed by their teachers on the BSAG and post-measures on the Kuder and MAT were completed for those Companions remaining in the programme. Four Companions who had left the programme before the termination of activities had completed these measures {{at the time of their}} withdrawal. The results of the present investigation included: a) Significantly more females than males volunteered to become Companions, and their family birth-order position as last-born was highly significant. b) The results of the ratings for potential effectiveness as a Companion on the GAIT and on subjective ranking by the Researcher produced a highly significant correlation (. 01 level), indicating that either method of selection is appropriate. c) Because only two new Companions joined the programme at the start of Term Two, it was not possible to adequately compare the effects of training versus no training. d) As a group, there were two significant changes in the motivations of the older students. There were increases in MAT scores measuring the drive "Narcism-Comfort" and the sentiment "Sweetheart- Spouse," significant at the. 05 level. e) The results of the initial administration of the Kuder revealed that volunteers already had a high preference for careers in social service areas. There was no significant change in this orientation following participation in the Companionship programme. f) The second administration of the B 3 AG revealed no significant changes in the teachers' perceptions of the Kids' social adjustment. The Companionship programme is considered to have been beneficial to both Kids and Companions. Although there were no statistically significant changes in the Kids in the short term of this study, it appears likely that there is potential for long term benefits. Several of the relationships are continuing on an informal basis. Companions spontaneously expressd the enjoyment and personal growth they had derived and their willingness to participate in the next programme. Some parents of Kids were enthusiastic in their evaluations and have sought to keep in touch with the Companion. The Companionship programme is seen to have been a valuable preventive programme in community mental health...|$|R
40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} UK Data Service {{and data}} collection copyright owner. The National Child Development Study (NCDS) originated in the Perinatal Mortality Survey (see SN 5565), which examined social and obstetric factors associated with still birth and infant mortality among over 17, 000 babies born in Britain in one week in March 1958. Surviving members of this birth cohort have been surveyed on eight further occasions in order to monitor their changing health, education, social and economic circumstances - in 1965 at age 7, 1969 at age 11, 1974 at age 16 (the first three sweeps are also held under SN 5565), 1981 (age 23 - SN 5566), 1991 (age 33 - SN 5567), 1999 / 2000 (age 41 / 2 - SN 5578), 2004 - 2005 (age 46 / 47 - SN 5579), 2008 - 2009 (age 50 - SN 6137) and 2013 (age 55 - SN 7669). There have also been surveys of sub-samples of the cohort, the most recent occurring in 1995 (age 37), when a 10 % representative sub-sample was assessed for difficulties with basic skills (SN 4992). Finally, during 2002 - 2004, 9, 340 NCDS cohort members participated in a bio-medical survey, carried out by qualified nurses (SN 5594, available under more restrictive Special Licence access conditions; see catalogue record for details). The bio-medical survey did not cover any of the topics included in the 2004 / 2005 survey. Further NCDS data separate to the main surveys include a response and deaths dataset, parent migration studies, employment, activity and partnership histories, behavioural studies and essays - see the NCDS series page for details. Further information about the NCDS {{can be found on}} the Centre for Longitudinal Studies website. NCDS 0 - 3 : SN 5565 includes selected data from the Perinatal Mortality Survey (PMS), conducted in 1958. Only those cases which were used in the NCDS, thus forming NCDS Sweep 0, are included here (although the full PMS dataset is held at the UKDA under SN 2137). SN 5565 also includes NCDS Sweeps 1, 2 and 3, conducted in 1965, 1969 and 1974 respectively. For the birth survey, information was obtained from the mother and from medical records by the midwife. For the purposes of the first three NCDS surveys, information was obtained from parents (who were interviewed by health visitors), head teachers and class teachers (who completed questionnaires), the schools' health service (who carried out medical examinations) and the subjects themselves (who completed tests of ability and, latterly, questionnaires). In addition, the birth cohort was augmented by including immigrants born in the relevant week in the target sample for the first three follow-ups (NCDS 1 - 3). The latter group was identified from the school registers during tracing. Since 1974 no attempt has been made to include new immigrants in the survey. The Centre for Longitudinal Studies updated the first six waves of NCDS in late 2006. Improvements made include further data cleaning and the addition of new documentation. For the third edition (July 2014), a file containing additional variables was deposited and the documentation updated accordingly. Main Topics : NCDS 0 (selected data from PMS 1958) : These data provide a comprehensive investigation into the circumstances relating to the mother and child, the pregnancy and birth, including: background information on mother; previous pregnancy history; details of present pregnancy; and birth data. NCDS 1 : This sweep assessed the NCDS children at age seven.
