5|$|Although Virginia Tech's {{selection}} via automatic bid {{was relatively}} quiet, Kansas' selection caused {{a great deal}} of controversy. Kansas had lost to Big12 runner-up Missouri and had a lower Bowl Championship Poll ranking than the Tigers. Some believed that Missouri should have been selected ahead of Kansas <b>because</b> <b>they</b> had defeated Kansas and <b>because</b> <b>they</b> had played in the Big12 Championship Game. According to BCS officials, however, Missouri's two losses were more of a detriment than Kansas's one loss and subsequent championship game absence.|$|E

5|$|Although condoms {{effectively}} {{prevent the}} sexual transmission of HIV, several factors have limited widespread condom distribution and uptake in Malawi. People living in non-urban areas often have difficulty accessing condoms, and condoms are not typically available at bars {{and other social}} locations where {{they could have a}} significant impact on HIV prevention. Many people oppose condoms <b>because</b> <b>they</b> believe that condoms make sex less enjoyable or <b>because</b> <b>they</b> question their ability to prevent the transmission of HIV. However, despite these factors, many unmarried couples have started using condoms more consistently as concern and fear about the HIV/AIDS epidemic have increased.|$|E

5|$|Large female Murray cod in the 15– to 35-kg (35– to 80-lb) range are {{the most}} {{important}} breeders <b>because</b> <b>they</b> produce the most eggs and for other reasons; large females in most fish species are also important <b>because</b> <b>they</b> produce larger larvae with larger yolk sacs, and are also more experienced breeders that display optimal breeding behaviours. Such large females may also have valuable, successful genes to pass on. All of these factors mean the spawnings of large female fish have far higher larval survival rates and make far greater reproductive contributions than the spawnings of small female fish.|$|E

5|$|Nearly all {{octopuses}} are predatory; bottom-dwelling octopuses eat mainly crustaceans, polychaete worms, {{and other}} molluscs such as whelks and clams; open-ocean octopuses eat mainly prawns, {{fish and other}} cephalopods.

Prey that {{it is likely to}} reject include moon snails, <b>because</b> <b>they</b> are too large, and limpets, rock scallops, chitons and abalone, <b>because</b> <b>they</b> are too securely fixed to the rock.|$|E
5|$|Octopuses bring {{captured}} prey {{back to the}} den {{where they}} can eat it safely. Sometimes the octopus catches more prey than it can eat, and the den is often surrounded by a midden of dead and uneaten food items.
