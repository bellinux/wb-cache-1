The brushless generation using Induction generator with excitation capacitor known as self-excited induction generators driven by constant speed prime movers are becoming more popular because of its low cost, ruggedness, low maintenance and no need of DC excitation system since last two decades. Moreover, these generators can also be operate as stand-alone system to provide electricity to isolated rural areas where transmission of power through grid is difficult and uneconomical. However the fundamental problem associated with such generation scheme are poor voltage regulation under varying load. In order to regulate its terminal voltage with varying load the active and reactive power levels at PCC (point of common coupling) have to be maintained constant. The active and reactive power level are regulated by using modern power electronic converters. But survey shows that existing controllers are either difficult to implement or uneconomical or designed for particular load only.

50|$|The {{voltage divider}} is formed using {{external}} resistors R1 and R2. The voltage across R2 forward biases the emitter junction. By proper selection of resistors R1 and R2, the operating {{point of the}} transistor can be made independent of β. In this circuit, the voltage divider holds the <b>base</b> <b>voltage</b> fixed independent of base current provided the divider current is large compared to the base current. However, even with a fixed <b>base</b> <b>voltage,</b> collector current varies with temperature (for example) so an emitter resistor is added to stabilize the Q-point, similar to the above circuits with emitter resistor. The voltage divider configuration achieves the correct voltages {{by the use of}} resistors in certain patterns.

Typically, the collector voltage will be higher than the <b>base</b> <b>voltage,</b> and Schottky diode will be reverse biased. If the input current is increased, then the collector voltage falls below the <b>base</b> <b>voltage,</b> and the Shottky diode starts to conduct and shunt some of the base drive current into the collector.

When the input voltage (Q1 <b>base</b> <b>voltage)</b> rises {{slightly}} above the voltage across the emitter resistor RE (the high threshold), Q1 begins conducting.

50|$|Generally base {{values of}} power and voltage are chosen. The base power may be the rating of {{a single piece of}} {{apparatus}} such as a motor or generator. If a system is being studied, the base power is usually chosen as a convenient round number such as 10 MVA or 100 MVA. The <b>base</b> <b>voltage</b> is chosen as the nominal rated voltage of the system. All other base quantities are derived from these two base quantities. Once the base power and the <b>base</b> <b>voltage</b> are chosen, the base current and the base impedance are determined by the natural laws of electrical circuits. Note the base value should only be magnitudes, while the per-unit values are phasors. The phase angles of complex power, voltage, current, impedance etc. are not affected by the conversion to per unit values.As we have already known, the purpose of introducing per-unit system is to simplify our conversion between different transformers. Hence, it is appropriate to illustrate the steps for finding per-unit values for voltage and impedance. First, let the base power (S_base) of each end of a transformer become the same. Once we set every S on the same base, we can get <b>base</b> <b>voltage</b> and base impedance for every transformer easily. The numbers we have until now are all based on the same unit. Next, substitute the real numbers of impedances and voltages into the per-unit calculation definition. We can get the answers for the per-unit system. In other case, if we have known the per-unit values at first, we can get the real values by multiplying by the base values.|$|E
40|$|As CMOS {{technology}} is scaling down, {{the effect of}} voltage drop in power distribution network is becoming more prominent. Such voltage drops on power lines in a clock network introduces significant amount of skew, thereby degrading the signal integrity. With rising power consumption and decreasing supply voltages, the upply current will increase in future devices. The IR drops can be reduced by using large wires which negatively impacts the global routing. Thus to provide proper supply voltages, on chip DC-DC converters are designed. The purpose of this project is to design an on-chip DC-DC converter targeted for System on Chip (SOC).

50|$|When {{the circuit}} is first powered up, neither {{transistor}} will be switched on.

50|$|Intuitively, this {{behavior}} can be also understood by realizing that the base-emitter voltage in the bipolar transistor is very insensitive to bias changes, so any change in <b>base</b> <b>voltage</b> is transmitted (to good approximation) directly to the emitter. It depends slightly on various disturbances (transistor tolerances, temperature variations, load resistance, collector resistor if it is added, etc.) since the transistor reacts to these disturbances and restores the equilibrium.

50|$|In a grounded-emitter {{transistor}} circuit, {{such as the}} light-switch circuit shown, as the <b>base</b> <b>voltage</b> rises, the emitter and collector currents rise exponentially. The {{collector voltage}} drops because of reduced resistance from collector to emitter.

The output voltage is about 0.65V less than the <b>base</b> <b>voltage,</b> {{which in turn is}} about 2 - 3 V less than VS (when loaded). Larger values of R1 (and C1) reduce the output ripple to almost negligible levels.

Consequently, the <b>base</b> <b>voltage</b> of Q2 is decreased, and VBE of Q2 decreases, counteracting the increase in output current.|$|E
