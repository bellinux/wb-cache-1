50|$|The {{crown of}} {{relevance}} {{is made by}} a circle of gold, pure, cloudy, guilloche, <b>burnished</b> <b>edges,</b> supporting eight large pearls around, of which five are visible, placed on the rim. The blazon is the reading of {{and in the case}} of the family C. appears to be the palette of red and gold, the wave band of azure on everything. The badges simple age and older with a limited number of figures, are more complicated then, with divisions and greater variety of shapes, colors and ornaments. In this case, the prevalence of red represents the modesty, chastity, true God and the ardent love of neighbor, justice as well as the nobility conspicuous, domination, revenge, audacity, courage, value, shedding blood in the war, fortitude, generosity, a burning desire. The largest of the colors of arms and is the symbol of fire.|$|E
60|$|The {{whole of}} this war gear bore {{evidence}} of being cherished with the utmost care and solicitude. Every ring on the tunic was polished as highly as the metal would admit of, so that the light appeared to trickle over it as its wearer moved. The helmet shone like a globe of quicksilver, and lines of light gleamed on the <b>burnished</b> <b>edge</b> of the shield, or sparkled on the ornamental points of the more precious metals with which the various parts of his armour were decorated. Above all hung a loose mantle or cloak of dark-blue cloth, which was fastened on the right shoulder with a large circular brooch of silver.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{concerns}} to specific {{conditions of the}} two-dimensional local state of strain at burnishing. First time a photograph is represented which testifies {{to the absence of}} an excessive wave of metal belt in front of the <b>burnishing</b> tool deforming <b>edge</b> at such a regime. The methods of determining rates of stain across the wall thickness of a tube object are offered. Also microphotographs of a structure of the metal at the nearest neighborhood to the burnishing tool are presented...|$|R
50|$|CMC powder {{is widely}} used in the ice cream industry. It is used to make ice creams without {{churning}} mechanism or extreme low temperatures thereby eliminating the need of the conventional churners or salt ice mixes. CMC is used in bakery products like breads and cake preparation. The use of CMC gives loaf a much improved quality at a reduced cost to the baker economizing on the fat component. CMC is also used as an emulsifier in producing high quality biscuits. Due to CMC, fat disperses uniformly in the dough and hence CMC improves {{the release of the}} dough from the moulds and cutters to achieve well-shaped biscuits without any distorted edges. It can help to reduce consumption of egg yolk or fat used in making biscuits, thus achieving economy. Use of CMC in candy preparation ensures smooth dispersion in flavour oils, improves texture & quality. They are used in chewing gums, margarines and peanut butter as emulsifier, also it is used in leather crafting to <b>burnish</b> the <b>edges.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{traditional}} shoemaker would {{measure the}} feet {{and cut out}} upper leathers according to the required size. These parts were fitted and stitched together. The sole was next assembled, consisting {{of a pair of}} inner soles of soft leather, a pair of outer soles of firmer texture, a pair of welts or bands about one inch broad, of flexible leather, and lifts and top-pieces for the heels. The insole was then attached to a last made of wood, which was used to form the shoe. Some lasts were straight, while curved lasts came in pairs: one for left shoes, the other for right shoes. The 'lasting' procedure then secured the leather upper to the sole with tacks. The soles were then hammered into shape; the heel lifts were then attached with wooden pegs and the worn out-sole was nailed down to the lifts. The finishing operation included paring, rasping, scraping, smoothing, blacking, and <b>burnishing</b> the <b>edges</b> of soles and heels, scraping, sand-papering, and burnishing the soles, withdrawing the lasts, and cleaning out any pegs which may have pierced through the inner sole.|$|R
50|$|Burnish setting, also {{sometimes}} referred to as flush setting, shot setting, or gypsy setting (The term gypsy setting is used less often today because the word gypsy is seen as derogatory) is similar to bead setting, but after the stone is inserted into the space, instead of using a graver to lift beads, a burnishing tool is used to push the metal all around the stone. The stone will be roughly flush with the surface, with a <b>burnished</b> or rubbed <b>edge</b> around it. This type of setting has a long history but is gaining a resurgence in contemporary jewelry. Sometimes the metal is finished using sandblasting, as it shows off the work very well.|$|R
40|$|This is {{the first}} piece that has been created {{as part of a}} wider on going {{practice}} based research project entitled “Can an artefact be created to store the memory of lost love”. The study hypothetically defines what love is in the context of differing relationships, such as familial, platonic and romantic the explanation of ‘lost love’ is to be explored as this changes the status and emotion felt. Lost love {{for the purpose of this}} study is defined as love felt for a person who is estranged from another, no longer in contact with or passed away from the participant. The reasoning behind using lost love as the starting point is considered here. “Lost or dead loves, enshrined in an aura of imaginary perfection, seem to hover over all our loves…within the imagination, they take on a magical and healing power. We idealise their attributes, make them the bearers of all our good and wholeness, the healers of our wounds” (Appignanesi, 2011, p. 36). The study will capture a number of participants lost love narratives, which will then be translated in to the design of storage artefacts. These narratives of lost love portray heightened emotion; therefore creating the belief that this lost love can be transubstantiated and harnessed within an object. The chest is an area of the body synonymous with love. Our heart, being the symbol of love is encased here, our neck being a sensual area on display or waiting to be kissed. The N-exlace is an accessory or the means to ‘store’ the love of a lost relationship. The natural veg tanned leather is moulded tightly to the curves and undulations of the body to allow a seamless fit as if the leather was the skin from earlier years. Imprinted on the leather are memories of the relationship, both good and bad. Images from happier times in photo booths, playfully pulling faces, letters and postcards received talking about the future and that pain of being apart and diary excerpts as the relationship broke down, knowing it was nearly over, but not sure where to turn or what to do. In the centre of piece is a bubble. The ghost of an object symbolizing the embodiment of the lost love. A locket once given as a gift. Like the love, the locket no longer remains, but the imprint on the person is still present, leaving memories that shape our character, lifestyle and fashion choices and in certain aspects our future relationships. The Design Process This is a personal piece, rather than creating from collected narratives. Therefore the locket, letters, photographs and diary entries are all my own. The design process started with collecting these souvenirs from a previous relationship or ‘lost love’ and experimenting with how the objects could be applied to create a new fashion artefact. Casting with translucent silicone is a predominant part of my work as it allows the detail of objects to be captured clearly and viewed as if they were still present. I like to re-imagine objects as being absent from their original location, but leaving a lasting impression in the space they once possessed. The locket here felt as if it should still be part of the skin and so I chose to embed it into the leather. Like tattoos, the memories from the relationship are captured on the leather/skin and remind the wearer about the relationship, both happy and sad times. The design and making process allowed me to rethink the ending of the relationship and acted as a therapeutic cathartic exercise remembering why choices were made, but how they have shaped who I have become. Making Process The leather was decorated with old photographs and excerpts by using acetone printing, where by a reverse image is placed face down on the leather, then acetone is painted on and rubbed through to create the print. This gives a distressed finish depending on how hard or regular the paper is rubbed. Traditional leather craft technique of wet moulding natural vegetable tanned leather to form the shape of the piece. It is then left to dry and set into place. The leather is finished using traditional <b>edge</b> <b>burnishing</b> techniques and carnauba crème wax finishing. The locket was cast using a platinum cure silicone and a spherical mould. The locket was suspended just on the surface of the silicone to give the front half impression. The bezel of the locket remains as an idea of what once was there. The silicone mould was then secured in place by sandwiching between the leather and secured using silicone glue. Using rivets and a buckle and strap to keep the piece in place around the neck finishes the piece...|$|R
