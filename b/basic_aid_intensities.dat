40|$|From 1972 to 2013, California {{school districts}} {{received}} general purpose funds {{known as a}} “revenue limit” through a mix of local property taxes and state aid. Some districts, known as “basic aid ” or “excess tax” districts, fund their revenue limit entirely through property taxes and receive no general purpose state aid. They also retain any excess property taxes within their district. Starting in 2013 – 14, a district’s general purpose funds will be calculated through a new Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF). As under the revenue limit system, the LCFF entitlement will be financed through a mix of property taxes and state aid. Although the LCFF entitlement will be greater than the revenue limit entitlement for most districts, {{a majority of the}} current <b>basic</b> <b>aid</b> districts will retain their status. This report focuses on <b>basic</b> <b>aid</b> districts. It describes how districts attain <b>basic</b> <b>aid</b> status and examines how <b>basic</b> <b>aid</b> districts differ from other school districts in their demographic characteristics. <b>Basic</b> <b>aid</b> districts are generally more advantaged than other districts. Their residents have higher average salaries and home values. However, they are not a homogenous group of districts. They are concentrated in the San Francisco Bay Area and along California’s eastern border with Nevada; and as one might expect, when <b>basic</b> <b>aid</b> districts are categorized by their geographic location, differences emerge. Coastal <b>basic</b> <b>aid</b> districts have more educated and wealthy residents and very high home prices, while inland <b>basic</b> <b>aid</b> districts tend to b...|$|R

40|$|PhD, Educational Psychology, North-West University, Vaal Triangle Campus, 2012 According to {{the policy}} on Inclusive Education, {{teachers}} are increasingly expected to play a community and pastoral role in order to, in this way, be able to measure up {{to the needs of}} learners who are experiencing barriers to learning (such as, for example, self-mutilation). This study was undertaken to determine what knowledge and skills teachers have at their disposal to identify self-mutilators in inclusive classrooms and to provide <b>basic</b> <b>aid</b> to these learners. By means of a literature study, self-mutilation was elucidated, and attention was paid to an explanation of what exactly self-mutilation involved, the forms of self-mutilation, the causes of self-mutilation, self-mutilation and related conditions, and the characteristics of the self-mutilator. Linked to this, the focus was {{on the extent to which}} the teacher is capable of identifying self-mutilators in inclusive classrooms and providing <b>basic</b> <b>aid</b> to them. Focus was also placed on the community and pastoral role of the teacher, the teacher’s experience of inclusive education, and the National Strategy with regard to the Screening, Identification, Assessment, and Support of learners who experience barriers to learning. A full description of various therapeutic approaches and aid programmes that can be undertaken with self-mutilators concluded the literature review. This literature review indicated a gap regarding the availability of training programmes for South-African teachers without training or background knowledge of Psychology, to assist them in identifying self-mutilators and providing <b>basic</b> <b>aid</b> to self-mutilators. Quantitative descriptive research was used to gather data from teachers by means of a questionnaire with open and closed items. In this particular study, 319 teachers were purposively and randomly chosen from 16 secondary schools (eight Ex Model C schools and eight Township schools) from Districts D 2 and D 12 in the Krugersdorp/Roodepoort area of the Gauteng Department of Education. On the one hand, the questionnaire determined teachers‟ knowledge and skills with regard to the nature of, reasons for and characteristics of self-mutilation in inclusive classrooms, and whether they possessed skills to provide <b>basic</b> <b>aid</b> to self-mutilators. On the other hand, it was also determined by means of open questions how the teachers become aware of self-mutilators, the type of training they received to provide <b>basic</b> <b>aid</b> to self-mutilators, what they viewed being the influence of self-mutilation on teaching and learning and on emotional and social development, their views of the pastoral role of the teacher as well as what their attitude/view was with regard to the possible implementation of a training programme to identify self-mutilators in inclusive classrooms and to provide <b>basic</b> <b>aid</b> to them. Furthermore, the open questions explored the availability of support structures to teachers to assist them in identifying self-mutilators and providing <b>basic</b> <b>aid</b> to these learners, as well as the opportunities that teachers create for learners to talk about their problems. Results indicated that the teachers who took part in the study did not have adequate knowledge and skills at their disposal regarding the identification of, and provision of <b>basic</b> <b>aid</b> to self-mutilators. They were however in favour of the implementation of a training programme that would enable them to identify self-mutilators and provide <b>basic</b> <b>aid</b> to them. On the basis of the data obtained through the questionnaire, and in accordance with the literature, a training programme was developed. In the absence of training programmes for the support of teachers in the identification of, and aid to self-mutilators in South African schools, this study makes a distinct contribution.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{relationship}} between Home School Enrollment and Virginia Public School Finances. Enrollment trends were examined from Fall 2001 through Fall 2010 to determine if there was an increase in Home School Enrollment over the ten year examination period. Also, two sets of Virginia Standards of Quality Variables (SOQs), Expenditures (Instructional Salaries, Administrative Salaries, Per Pupil Expenditures) and Revenues (State Portion of <b>Basic</b> <b>Aid,</b> State Portion of ADM funds and Enumerated Funds) were examined in relation with Home School Enrollment to determine if Home School Enrollment influenced Virginia Public School Finances at all. Superintendents’ Region I, one of Virginia’s eight superintendents’ regions, served as the sample population. The study revealed that Instructional and Administrative Salaries were correlated to an increase in Home School Enrollment while Per Pupil Expenditures correlations revealed no relationship. Strong correlations were revealed between an increase in Home School Enrollment and State Portion of <b>Basic</b> <b>Aid</b> while correlations between State Portion of ADM funds and Enumerated revealed no relationship. The study results revealed that Home School Enrollment does not cost or save Virginia Public Schools. Significant relationships were found but whether Home School Enrollment presents a savings or an expense to Virginia Public School Finances was not concluded.

40|$|Is {{there an}} effect of aid on {{democracy}} conditional on instability from trade ? This paper reinvestigate the debated effect of aid on democracy with a new specification. We take advantage of previous empirical findings explaining the role of aid in mitigating the adverse effects of external shocks, and argue {{that in the long}} term, aggregate aid flows can potentially dampen the effects of terms-of-trade instability on the quality of democracy. An empirical investigation with data from 70 developing countries (28 of them african countries) over the period 1980 - 2003 (pooled in two twelve-years periods) provides supportive results. Moreover, the data suggest that terms-of-trade instability affects democracy through income instability. These results are robust to alternative specifications and to the use of different measures of <b>aid</b> <b>intensity</b> and democracy. ...|$|R
