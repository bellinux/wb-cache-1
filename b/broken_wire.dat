They advanced on a series of posts held by the 2nd and 3rd Battalions of the Italian 115th Infantry Regiment. Posts 49 and 47 were rapidly overrun, as was Post 46 in the second line beyond. Within half an hour Post 48 had also fallen and another company had taken Posts 45 and 44. The two remaining companies now advanced beyond these positions towards a low stone wall as artillery fire began to fall along the <b>broken</b> <b>wire.</b> The Italians fought from behind the wall until the Australians were inside it, attacking with hand grenades and bayonets. The two companies succeeded in taking 400 prisoners.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{prestressing}} wires of {{prestressed concrete}} cylinder pipe (PCCP) provide core concrete with compressive stress to resist internal pressure. <b>Broken</b> <b>wires</b> resulting from corrosion and embrittlement may cause cracking in pipe wall {{and increase the}} risk of failure with time. In order to reveal the mechanism of longitudinal cracking in PCCP with <b>broken</b> <b>wires,</b> a simplified model is developed and the maximum number of <b>broken</b> <b>wires</b> to preclude onset of longitudinal cracking can be determined conveniently by the equations derived in this paper. Verification against results of finite element analysis shows that the presented method has decent accuracy for appropriate effective pipe length and wall thickness. By comparing the calculated maximum number of <b>broken</b> <b>wires</b> with the actual number of <b>broken</b> <b>wires</b> detected by inspection and monitoring technologies, longitudinal cracking in prestress loss zone can be predicted, thus aiding condition assessment of PCCP...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Cables {{are used}} as {{critical}} structure components for suspended and cable-stayed bridges. It has been recently increased the need for inspection methods to assess {{the conditions of the}} cables due to owners concern about the operability and safety of such aging structures. An alternative technique is being developed in this paper. The magnetostrictive guided wave technology is used to test <b>broken</b> <b>wires.</b> The suitability of this method is studied through application tests on experimental setups, lab-made cables with simulated <b>broken</b> <b>wires</b> and field test. Test Results indicate that this technique can detect two <b>broken</b> <b>wires</b> away exceeding two meters and propagating over one hundred meters. It is a promising method for nondestructive testing of bridge cables...|$|R
60|$|Orme {{pointed to}} them as he hurried on, and {{suddenly}} a man leapt {{out of the darkness}} as a buck leaps from a bush, and ran past us, holding his hands to his side, where evidently he had some grievous hurt. Now we entered the corridor leading to the private apartments of the Child of Kings, and found ourselves walking on the bodies of dead and dying men. One of the former I observed, as one does notice little things at such a moment, held in his hand the <b>broken</b> <b>wire</b> of the field telephone.

He dropped over the edge, but the wagon, lurching violently, went on, {{and for a few}} moments Harding, running fast, clung to the near horse's head. Then he let go; but instead of jumping clear, as the watchers had expected, he grasped the side of the wagon as it passed and swung himself up. They saw him seize the reins, standing upright behind the driving-seat; and then the wagon plunged out of sight among the trees.|$|E
60|$|The rope made itself unpopular {{long before}} the crowd had fully {{realised}} his advent over the trees. An elderly and apparently intoxicated peasant in a shiny black hat, and carrying a large crimson umbrella, caught sight of it first as it trailed past him, and was seized with a discreditable ambition to kill it. He pursued it, briskly with unpleasant cries. It crossed the road obliquely, splashed into a pail of milk upon a stall, and slapped its milky tail athwart a motor-car load of factory girls halted outside the town gates. They screamed loudly. People {{looked up and saw}} Bert making what he meant to be genial salutations, but what they considered, in view of the feminine outcry, to be insulting gestures. Then the car hit the roof of the gatehouse smartly, snapped a flag staff, played a tune upon some telegraph wires, and sent a <b>broken</b> <b>wire</b> like a whip-lash to do its share in accumulating unpopularity. Bert, by clutching convulsively, just escaped being pitched headlong. Two young soldiers and several peasants shouted things up to him and shook fists at him and began to run in pursuit as he disappeared over the wall into the town.|$|E

Ice does not sink down from the surface, and even if a floating iceberg should turn over, as they sometimes do in the more open sea, the Dipsey will keep low enough to avoid such danger. In fact, I feel almost sure that if she should meet with any obstacle which would prevent her from keeping on her course to the pole, all she would have to do would be to turn around and come back. As to the possibility of receiving no messages, I should conclude in that case that the wire had broken, and should wait a few days before allowing myself to be seriously alarmed. We have provided against such an accident. The Dipsey is equipped as a cable-laying vessel, and if her <b>broken</b> <b>wire</b> is not at too great a depth, she could recover it; but I have given orders that should such an accident occur, and they cannot reestablish communication, they must return." ...|$|E

40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. The Humber Bridge officially opened in 1981 and carries 4 lanes of traffic across the Humber Estuary between Barton and Hessle {{to the west}} of Kingston-upon-Hull in East Yorkshire, England. When opened, it was the longest span {{suspension}} bridge in the world with a main span of 1410 m but it currently ranks as the fifth longest span in the world. Humber Bridge Board (HBB) commissioned an internal inspection of the main cables following the discovery of extensive corrosion and <b>broken</b> <b>wires</b> in the main cables of two older suspension bridges in the UK. The main cable inspections revealed widespread, if generally light corrosion with localised pitting and {{a very small number of}} <b>broken</b> <b>wires.</b> Dehumidification of suspension bridge main cables is becoming standard practice not only in the UK but worldwide. This paper examines the installation of the Humber Bridge system, discusses the mechanics of atmospheric steel corrosion and explains how the cable dehumidification system will suppress future corrosion...|$|R

40|$|Current {{methods of}} {{inspecting}} <b>wire</b> rope for <b>broken</b> <b>wires</b> or excessive wear include visual inspection, physical measurements of rope diameter, and electromagnetic nondestructive testing (NDT).

One means of achieving this goal {{is to use a}} computer to analyze the test data and determine the condition of the wire rope, including the presence of <b>broken</b> <b>wires</b> and corrosion, and the amount of wear. An off-the-shelf data acquisition and analysis system was tested in a U. S. Bureau of Mines laboratory using a continuous loop of wire rope containing fabricated flaws. The test rope was run through a commercially available NDT instrument.

These initial tests were successful in showing that the use of a computer can improve current methods of NDT waveform collection and analysis...|$|R

Firstly 5000 N axial tension was placed on the rope, the stress distribution was simulated and analysed, and the steel wire with the largest stress distribution was found out. Then one steel wire was truncated with the load unchanged, and the finite element simulation was carried out again, and repeated the steps several times.
