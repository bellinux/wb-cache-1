6000|$|... "Sure, I'll try some. Say--Say, it's funny; I've <b>been</b> <b>coming</b> <b>here</b> {{ever since}} the shop opened and--" [...] With arch surprise. [...] "--I don't believe I know your name!" ...|$|E
6000|$|Miss Garnett: [...] "Yes, distinctly. I {{knew you}} couldn't know, and I thought you ought to." [...] She {{speaks in a}} deep conviction-bearing and conviction-carrying voice. [...] "If he has <b>been</b> <b>coming</b> <b>here</b> so much." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Worse {{than any}} of us know," [...] Mr. Foley agreed. [...] "If you hadn't <b>been</b> <b>coming</b> <b>here,</b> I should have sent for you last night. The French Ambassador was with me for an hour after dinner." ...|$|E
60|$|MRS. BARLOW. No, not now. I believe father <b>is</b> <b>coming</b> <b>here</b> with Gerald.|$|R
60|$|LADY BRITOMART. Be quiet, Charles. Now {{listen to}} me, children. Your father <b>is</b> <b>coming</b> <b>here</b> this evening. [General stupefaction].|$|R
60|$|MAGGIE. I didn't see him, but I heard him. SHE is with him. I {{think they}} <b>are</b> <b>coming</b> <b>here.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{is lucky}} that I carried out your suggestion, Mike, and posted a sentry at the door. Of course, these men the sentry saw {{may not have}} <b>been</b> <b>coming</b> <b>here,</b> but at any rate their conduct was suspicious." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{seemed to}} be a friend of the Marchesa's nephew," [...] {{continued}} Houston;--"one Colonel Stubbs. We used to see him at Rome, and a most curious man he is. His name is Jonathan, and I don't suppose that any man was ever seen so red before. He is shooting somewhere, and Hamel seems to be going to join him. I thought he might have <b>been</b> <b>coming</b> <b>here</b> afterwards, as you all were in Rome together." ...|$|E
6000|$|Miss Ramsey: [...] "And {{have some}} more tea. There is nothing like fresh tea for {{clearing}} the brain, and we certainly need clear brains for this." [...] She pushes a button in the wall beside her, and is silent till the maid appears. [...] "More tea, Nora." [...] She is silent again while the maid reappears with the tea and disappears. [...] "I don't {{know that he has}} <b>been</b> <b>coming</b> <b>here</b> so very much. But he has no right to be coming at all, if he is engaged. That is, in that way." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But, Lucy, dear,"--and now Mrs. Roberts {{put her arm}} {{round her}} sister-in-law's waist--"he <b>is</b> <b>coming</b> <b>here</b> {{especially}} to see you." ...|$|R
6000|$|STEPHEN [in utter consternation] Do {{you mean}} to say that my father <b>is</b> <b>coming</b> <b>here</b> to-night--that he may be here at any moment? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{brought it}} on yourselves," [...] said Fraser, calmly. [...] "You wouldn’t go away, you know. You can’t always <b>be</b> <b>coming</b> <b>here</b> worrying." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'They are {{all very}} well. James has <b>been</b> <b>coming</b> <b>here</b> twice a-week since I have been at home, and has been very {{attentive}} and pleasant; but I have not been at the Terrace much. There never was such a houseful of children. Oliver's room {{is the only place}} where one is safe from falling over two or three. However, they seem to like it, and to think, the more the better. James came over here the morning after the boy was born, as much delighted as if he had had any prospects.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It was wrong, mother," [...] Ned said quietly, [...] "and I {{have come}} to tell you I am sorry; but you see the news was very sudden, and I wasn't {{prepared}} for it. I {{did not know that}} he had <b>been</b> <b>coming</b> <b>here,</b> and the news took me quite by surprise. I suppose fellows never do like their mothers marrying again. It stands to reason they wouldn't; but, now I have thought it over, I am sorry I spoke as I did, and I do hope, mother, you will be happy with him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, no," [...] Frida cried, sobbing. [...] "It's all Robert, Robert! As soon as ever {{you were}} gone, {{he called me}} into the library--which always means he's going to talk over some dreadful {{business}} with me--and he said to me, 'Frida, I've just heard from Phil that this man Ingledew, who's chosen to foist himself upon us, holds opinions and sentiments which entirely unfit him from being proper company for any lady. Now, he's <b>been</b> <b>coming</b> <b>here</b> a great deal too often of late. Next time he calls, I wish you to tell Martha you're not at home to him.'" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Major Fitz-David {{brings you}} some news, my dear," [...] he said. [...] "Your mother-in-law, Mrs. Macallan, <b>is</b> <b>coming</b> <b>here</b> {{to see you}} to-day." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Something {{is going}} to happen—is happening, for that matter. I feel it. Something <b>is</b> <b>coming</b> <b>here,</b> to us. It <b>is</b> <b>coming</b> now. I don’t know what, but it is coming.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But," [...] said Paul, [...] "you {{are expecting}} company this afternoon. Don Caesar--I mean Miss Briones {{and her brother}} <b>are</b> <b>coming</b> <b>here</b> to say good-by." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{seems as}} if I HAD. I don't know what's come over me. I wasn't afraid of the woman before, but now I don't seem {{to feel as if}} I could look her in the face. He's <b>been</b> <b>coming</b> <b>here</b> of his own accord, and I fought against his coming long enough, {{goodness}} knows. I didn't want him to come. And as far forth as that goes, we're as respectable as they are; and your father's got twice their money, any day. We've no need to go begging for their favour. I guess they were glad enough to get him in with your father." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Fred Arnold {{was here}} last night. He was {{eighteen}} in November {{and is going}} to enlist just as soon as his mother is over an operation she has to have. He has <b>been</b> <b>coming</b> <b>here</b> very often lately and though I like him so much it makes me uncomfortable, because I am afraid he is thinking that perhaps I could care something for him. I can't tell him about Ken--because, after all, what is there to tell? And yet I don't like to behave coldly and distantly when he will be going away so soon. It is very perplexing. I remember I used to think it would be such fun to have dozens of beaux--and now I'm worried to death because two are too many.|$|E
6000|$|... "And here's {{her brother}} engaged to Marion Fay," [...] said Clara. Crocker {{declared}} that as to this {{he was by}} no means so well assured. Lord Hampstead in spite of their intimacy had told him nothing about it. [...] "But it is so, Mr. Crocker, as sure as ever you are sitting there. He has <b>been</b> <b>coming</b> <b>here</b> after her over and over again, and was closeted with her only last Friday for hours. It was a holiday, but that sly old Quaker went out of the way, so as to leave them together. That Mrs. Roden, though she's as stiff as buckram, knows all about it. To the best of my belief she got it all up. Marion Fay is with her every day. It's my belief there's something we don't understand yet. She's got a hold of them young people, and means to do just what she likes with 'em." [...] Crocker, however, could not agree to this. He had heard of Lord Hampstead's peculiar politics, and was assured that the young lord was only carrying out his peculiar principles in selecting Marion Fay for himself and devoting his sister to George Roden.|$|E
6000|$|... "Even {{under those}} {{circumstances}} I must refuse, though I would give a guinea to be with you. John Eames <b>is</b> <b>coming</b> <b>here</b> to say good-by." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Won't Miss Bygrave {{write to}} me?" [...] inquired Noel Vanstone, piteously. [...] "Did she know you <b>were</b> <b>coming</b> <b>here?</b> Did she send me no message?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Mark, [...] "he {{has told}} me all, and he <b>is</b> <b>coming</b> <b>here</b> to-morrow morning that he may receive an answer from yourself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I believe, Dias, {{that the}} boat was dashed to pieces against that line of rocks outside the {{entrance}} to the passage. We have {{reason to believe that the}} people here were expecting the treasure to arrive, and had {{the entrance to the}} cave in readiness to receive it. Certainly no better place could have been chosen for concealment. The boat may have <b>been</b> <b>coming</b> <b>here</b> when the storm broke and drove them towards the shore. They probably attempted to gain the mouth of the cove, but missed it, and were dashed to pieces against the rocks. The Indians on guard here no doubt saw it, and would be sure that the heavy sacks or boxes containing the gold would sink to the bottom. They would lie perfectly secure there, even more secure than if they had been removed and placed in the cave, and could always be recovered when the Spaniards left, so they were content to leave them there. Still, they obeyed the orders they had received to keep watch for ever over the treasure, and to do so knocked that strange hole through the wall and always kept two men on guard there.|$|E
6000|$|... "Dear no--do come in. You've {{just missed}} Nick; {{he has gone}} to the country--half an hour ago." [...] She had on a large apron and in her hand carried a small stick, besmeared, as his quick eye saw, with modelling-clay. She dropped the door and fled back before him into the studio, where, when he {{followed}} her, she was in the act of flinging a damp cloth over a rough head, in clay, which, {{in the middle of the}} room, was supported on a high wooden stand. The effort to hide what she had been doing before he caught a glimpse of it made her redder still and led to her smiling more, to her laughing with a confusion of shyness and gladness that charmed him. She rubbed her hands on her apron, she pulled it off, she looked delightfully awkward, not meeting Peter's eye, and she said: [...] "I'm just scraping here a little--you mustn't mind me. What I do is awful, you know. Please, Peter, don't look, I've <b>been</b> <b>coming</b> <b>here</b> lately to make my little mess, because mamma doesn't particularly like it at home. I've had a lesson or two from a lady who exhibits, but you wouldn't suppose it to see what I do. Nick's so kind; he lets me come here; he uses the studio so little; I do what I want, or rather what I can. What a pity he's gone--he'd have been so glad. I'm really alone--I hope you don't mind. Peter, please don't look." ...|$|E
50|$|Today, the {{hospital}} is recognized by the National Board of Examinations, New Delhi. Medical students from the U.K. and Germany have <b>been</b> <b>coming</b> <b>here</b> for their elective postings.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh! No; {{she showed}} me over the {{greatest}} part on Saturday--and we <b>were</b> <b>coming</b> <b>here</b> to these rooms--but only"--dropping her voice--"your father was with us." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I see, I see," [...] Elmore replied, with {{scarcely}} abated seriousness. [...] "Perhaps, if she <b>is</b> <b>coming</b> <b>here</b> for her health, she won't {{need much}} matronizing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I'll tell you," [...] said Bathsheba, with {{a mischievous}} smile in her bright eyes. [...] "Farmer Oak <b>is</b> <b>coming</b> <b>here</b> to dine with me to-day!" ...|$|R
50|$|Because Emperor Gotoba (1180-1239; r. 1183-1198) {{made the}} pilgrimage to Kumano 31 times and his {{successor}} Emperor Go-Shirakawa (1127 - 1192; reigned 1155 - 1158) made it 34 times, the pilgrimage became popular during this era. However, members of court had <b>been</b> <b>coming</b> <b>here</b> for about 400 years prior to this, believing it was near to Kannon’s paradise island located {{to the south of}} Japan called Fudaraku (Potala in Sanskrit).|$|E
5000|$|Greek food {{includes}} pork, chicken, {{and beef}} souvlaki, spanakopita, loukoumades, gyros, and roast quail. Attendees can also enjoy seated dining within the many restaurants throughout Danforth Avenue and enjoy such Greek favourites as saganaki (the [...] "flaming" [...] cheese), and delicious fresh Greek salads. Thousands have <b>been</b> <b>coming</b> <b>here</b> {{in recent years}} and they are planning to continue to go strong. Existing stores and restaurants are also open during the festival, usually opening up their stores to the streets for customers.|$|E
5000|$|General Ma Zhongying's {{retreating}} army often hijacked lorries {{to assist}} in their retreat. Volgin noted that Ma Zhongying often destroyed Russian lorries during battle. A White Russian informed Sven Hedin that [...] "We have <b>been</b> <b>coming</b> <b>here</b> from Qara-shahr all day, troop after troop. Two thousand Russians arrived to-day, half White, half Red. There are a thousand Torguts here; and two thousand troops of all arms have gone straight on to Kucha to attack Ma Chung-ying without touching Korla. Most of the two thousand who are in Korla now will continue westward to-morrow. We were five thousand strong when we started from Urumchi." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If that is true," [...] she demanded, [...] "how {{is it that}} he is {{received}} everywhere--at your house and by Mrs. Nairn? He <b>is</b> <b>coming</b> <b>here</b> to-night." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's {{my turn to}} play," [...] she said. [...] "And Blanche <b>is</b> <b>coming</b> <b>here</b> to {{look for}} me. Wait there, and I'll stop her on the steps." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The Duchess," [...] he repeated. [...] "I did {{not know}} that she <b>was</b> <b>coming</b> <b>here.</b> She <b>was</b> kind enough to ask me to go to Scotland later on." ...|$|R
