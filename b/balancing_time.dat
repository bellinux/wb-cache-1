40|$|Introduction: A {{positive}} {{focus on}} the present, the only time zone which we experience directly and permanently, {{is at least as}} relevant as perspectives on the past and future in a <b>balanced</b> <b>time</b> perspective and its relation to wellbeing. Yet, few instruments examining a positive present time perspective exist. Two present-directed concepts, mindfulness and flow, that are intrinsically linked to mental wellbeing were analyzed and used to formulate a present-eudaimonic scale that complements the past and future scales of the <b>balanced</b> <b>time</b> perspective scale. The present study addresses the psychometric properties of the present-eudaimonic scale and the modified <b>balanced</b> <b>time</b> perspective scale. Method: 131 participants filled out the present-eudaimonic scale, the <b>balanced</b> <b>time</b> perspective scale, the Zimbardo time perspective inventory, the five facet mindfulness questionnaire – short form, the Swedish flow proneness questionnaire and the mental health continuum – short form. <b>Balanced</b> <b>time</b> perspective was operationalized using the deviation from a <b>balanced</b> <b>time</b> perspective coefficient. Results: The present-eudaimonic scale showed good psychometric properties including internal consistency, factor structure, and convergent validity. The present-eudaimonic scale explained an additional eleven percent of variance in mental health beyond the other <b>time</b> perspective scales. <b>Balanced</b> <b>time</b> perspective as measured with the modified <b>balanced</b> <b>time</b> perspective scale correlated significantly stronger with mental health than <b>balanced</b> <b>time</b> perspective measured with the Zimbardo time perspective inventory. Conclusions: The present-eudaimonic scale fills a gap in the assessment of time perspective and the modified <b>balanced</b> <b>time</b> perspective scale is a promising way to study <b>balanced</b> <b>time</b> perspective...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: Despite the {{centrality}} of time to the aging process, the well-being consequences of different temporal orientations for optimal aging are poorly understood. We investigate one underexamined area of temporal orientation, namely a <b>balanced</b> <b>time</b> perspective, in a large, lifespan sample from the Netherlands. Method: Participants consisted of 512 Dutch adults {{ranging in age from}} 17 to 92 years (Mage = 46. 46, SD = 21. 37), including 186 male and 326 females. Participants completed a measure of <b>balanced</b> <b>time</b> perspective, mental health, and wisdom. Results: Results indicated that a <b>balanced</b> <b>time</b> perspective uniquely predicted both mental health and wisdom even after controlling for demographic, physical health, and personality variables. Younger adults tended to be more future-oriented relative to older adults while older adults tended to be more past-oriented relative to younger adults. Further, both midlife and younger adults {{were more likely to have}} a <b>balanced</b> <b>time</b> perspective relative to older adults. Conclusion: A <b>balanced</b> <b>time</b> perspective is associated with higher well-being and wisdom across the adult age span...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The paper {{deals with}} {{analysis}} of dynamic stability {{and behavior of}} automatic dynamic balance (ADB) by applying theoretical approach. Differential equations of the considered system were established using Lagrange equation. Numerical analysis of the dynamic equations was performed and influence of dynamic viscosity coefficient on self-balancing process was estimated.

40|$|The {{notion of}} whether people {{focus on the}} past, present or future, and how it shapes their {{behavior}} is known as Time Perspective. Fundamental {{to the work of}} two of its earliest proponents, Zimbardo and Boyd (2008), was the concept of <b>balanced</b> <b>time</b> perspective and its relationship to wellness. A person with <b>balanced</b> <b>time</b> perspective can be expected to have a flexible temporal focus of mostly positive orientations (past-positive, present-hedonistic, and future) and much less negative orientations (past-negative and present-fatalistic). This study measured deviation from <b>balanced</b> <b>time</b> perspective (DBTP: Zhang et al., 2013) in a sample of 243 mature adults aged 45 to 91 years and explored relationships to Retirement Planning, Depression, Anxiety, Stress, Positive Mood, and Negative Mood. Results indicate that DBTP accounts for unexplained variance in the outcome measures even after controlling for demographic variables. DBTP was negatively related to Retirement Planning and Positive Mood and positively related to Depression, Anxiety, Stress, and Negative Mood. Theoretical and practical implications regarding <b>balanced</b> <b>time</b> perspective are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{our study}} was to {{research}} the connection of the six time perspective dimensions and of <b>balanced</b> <b>time</b> perspective with personality traits and subjective well-being. Our starting point was the assumption that time perspective is closely connected to personality traits and subjective well-being. It has been theorized that so called <b>balanced</b> <b>time</b> perspective is optimal in the Western cultures. It is defined by moderately high scores on present-hedonistic and future, high scores on past-positive and low scores on past-negative and present-fatalistic, {{with an emphasis on}} individual&# 39;s ability of flexible adjusting in given situations. People with <b>balanced</b> <b>time</b> perspective profile have many positive memories of the past, find enough opportunity for relaxation and pleasure in the present, and seek new challenges in the future, which gives them motivation for hard work. They are supposed to handle daily life more efficiently and to be happier than people with other time perspective profiles. Therefore we have hypothesized positive connection of <b>balanced</b> <b>time</b> perspective with positive personality traits and high scores on subjective well-being. 279 students studying different subjects at the Faculty of arts, University in Ljubljana, whose mean age was 21. 2 years, participated in the study. The results reveal connections of positive time perspective dimensions (including transcendental-future) and of <b>balanced</b> <b>time</b> perspective with extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness and higher level of subjective well-being, and connections of negative time perspective dimensions with neuroticism, lower level of subjective well-being and higher level of depression. It turned out that <b>balance</b> of <b>time</b> perspective is an important predictor of individual&# 39;s level of satisfaction with life, and it also explains some variance in positive emotionality and depression...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} use of group {{communication}} to improve the efficiency of load balancing in interconnected LANs. Conventional load balancing techniques usually assume point-to-point connections among the computers and typically work on a single LAN only. This may waste network bandwidth and lengthen the load <b>balancing</b> <b>time</b> in LANs that support group communication such as the Ethernet. To tackle this problem a two-level algorithm is proposed in this paper. At the LAN level, all computers in a LAN maintain loading information in the entire LAN using a globally ordered group channel. The workload in the different LANs is balanced by moving load from the overloaded LANs to the underloaded ones. It is proved that the proposed algorithm converges {{to the state of}} global balance geometrically. Experimental results show that the algorithm reduces load <b>balancing</b> <b>time</b> and network utilization significantly compared to the single level algorithm without group communication...|$|E

Eighty-four undergraduate psychology students completed the ZTPI, Satisfaction with Life Scale, Subjective Happiness Scale, Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, and Coping Self-Efficacy Scale. Bivariate correlations and simultaneous regressions were calculated to determine the relationship between the five time perspectives of the ZTPI and the other four constructs being measured: satisfaction with life, happiness, self-esteem, and coping efficacy. Significant relationships were revealed between several of the TP subfactors and well-being variables. In addition, participant scores on the ZTPI were recoded to create two new groups: <b>Balanced</b> <b>Time</b> Perspective (BTP) and Unbalnced Time Perspective to determine if a BTP is associated with improved functioning. Independent sample t-tests were inconclusive due to the large discrepancy between the size of the balanced and unbalanced groups. The results were not able to be reliably interpreted with any confidence. Further research is needed to verify the apparent psychological benefits associated with having a <b>balanced</b> <b>time</b> perspective...|$|R

40|$|We study threshold-based load {{balancing}} protocols for weighted tasks. We are given an arbitrary graph G with n nodes (resources, bins) and m > n tasks (balls). Initially the tasks are distributed arbitrarily over the n nodes. The resources have a threshold {{and we are}} interested in the <b>balancing</b> <b>time,</b> i. e., the time it takes until the load of all resources is below the threshold. We distinguish between resource-based and user based protocols. In the case of resource-based protocols resources with a load larger than the threshold are allowed to send tasks to neighbouring resources. In the case of user-based protocols tasks allocated to resources with a load above the threshold decide on their own whether to migrate to a neighbouring resource or not. For resource-controlled protocols we present results for arbitrary graphs. Our bounds are in terms of the mixing time (for above-average thresholds) and the hitting time (for tight thresholds) of the graph. We relate the <b>balancing</b> <b>time</b> of resource-controlled protocols for above-average thresholds in arbitrary graphs to the mixing time of the graph and to the hitting time for tight thresholds. Our bounds are tight and, surprisingly, they are independent of the weights of the tasks. For the user-controlled migration we consider complete graphs and derive bounds for both above-average and tight thresholds...|$|E
