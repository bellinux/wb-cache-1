The South South Temperate Region is harder to discern even than the NNTR; its detail is subtle and can only be studied well by large telescopes or spacecraft. Many zones and belts are more transient in nature and are not always visible. These include the Equatorial band (EB), North Equatorial <b>belt</b> <b>zone</b> (NEBZ, a white zone within the belt) and South Equatorial <b>belt</b> <b>zone</b> (SEBZ). Belts are also occasionally split by a sudden disturbance. When a disturbance divides a normally singular belt or zone, an N or an S is added to indicate whether the component is the northern or southern one; e.g., NEB(N) and NEB(S).|$|E

Subsequently, Danbaba and his followers migrated from the present Dala Kano to safeguard their faith and gods. As a result, they were nicknamed “GWANDARAWA DA SALLAH”.

40|$|This {{paper is}} an econometric {{study of the}} {{planning}} application statistics for a special category of permissible land use in Hong Kong in green <b>belt</b> <b>zones.</b> The permissible use in question {{is that of the}} house, which refers to both the 'small house' for 'indigenous villagers' and ordinary houses that require building permission. The existence of such permissible residential use obviously distinguishes the idea of green belts from the UK concept as expressed in the quotation from Home (1997) above. This paper draws definitive conclusions within this idiosyncratic context about two potentially conflicting local land use policies: the 'small house' policy; and green belt policy with a presumption against development. The idea of green belts (as green <b>belt</b> <b>zones)</b> in Hong Kong, as an ex-UK Crown Colony, 1 {{is not the same as}} that behind their Western counterparts. The findings of this paper are also specific to one planning jurisdiction. Hence, the facts and findings presented in this paper should be of interest to the historian on colonial planning and the local policy maker. Yet, it is believed that the type of data and method presented in this paper should also be of wider interest for the urban planning researcher. Such wider interest is predicated not only on an increasing awareness of the economics of green belts and other conservation zones but also on a concern with methods to interpret planning statistics, a concern to which we turn. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

Tarka's UMBC, a predominantly Christian party contested the pre-independence election of 1959 and the subsequent election of 1963 against the mainly Moslem Northern People's Congress. Both elections led to violence in the Middle Belt, which contributed to the Major Chukwuma Kaduna Nzeogwu's inspired military take-over on January 15, 1966. [...] Tarka was reelected in 1959.

40|$|Abstract. The {{origin of}} stony meteorites landing on Earth today is {{directly}} linked {{to the history of}} the main belt, which evolved both through collisional evolution and dynamical evolution/depletion. In this paper, we focus our attention on the main belt dynamical evolution scenario discussed in Petit et al. (2001). According to Petit et al., during the planet formation epoch, the primordial main belt contained several Earth masses of material, enough to allow the asteroids to accrete on relatively short timescales. After a few My, the accretion of planetary embryos in the main <b>belt</b> <b>zone</b> dynamically stirred the remaining planetesimals to high enough velocities to initiate fragmentation. After a short interval, perhaps as long as 10 My, the primordial main belt was dynamically depleted of> 99 % of its material via the combined perturbations of the planetary embryos and a newly-formed Jupiter. The small percentage of objects that survived in the main <b>belt</b> <b>zone</b> became the asteroid belt. It has been shown that the wavy-shaped size-frequency distribution of the main belt is a “fossil ” left over from this violent period (Bottke et al. 2004). Using a collisional/dynamical model of this scenario, we tracked the evolution of stony meteoroids produced by catastrophic disruption events over the last several Gy. We show that mos...|$|E
40|$|Orbital {{evolution}} of spherical interplanetary dust {{particles in the}} Edgeworth-Kuiper <b>belt</b> <b>zone</b> is treated for semimajor axes 30 - 50 AU. Besides solar gravity, also solar electromagnetic and corpuscular radiation, and, fast interstellar gas flow are important forces influencing motion of the particles. The solar electromagnetic radiation {{is represented by the}} Poynting-Robertson effect and the solar corpuscular radiation corresponds to the solar wind. Time-variability of the non-radial solar wind can significantly increase dust lifetime in the zone. The average time for the particle stay in the zone is more than 30 -times greater than the conventional case of constant (time independent) radial solar wind offers, for the particles of tens micrometers in size. This holds for the most realistic material properties of the particles: Q̅'_pr = 1, where Q̅'_pr is the dimensionless efficiency factor for electromagnetic radiation pressure. If Q̅'_pr = 1 / 2, then the average time of the particle stay in the zone is only 4 -times the conventional value. The approach used in the paper illustrates the relevance of the solar wind action in comparison with the Poynting-Robertson effect. The results have an important consequence for our understanding of the structure of dust distribution in the Edgeworth-Kuiper <b>belt</b> <b>zone,</b> and, also, of dust belts in other stellar systems.

Only the isolated and relatively thin banded iron formations and some migmatites show such Mt values.
