50|$|The {{process of}} attacking the basic {{application}} or <b>basic</b> <b>registration</b> {{for this purpose}} is generally known as 'central attack.'

5000|$|Critics also {{state that}} the bill {{contains}} some elements that complicate the voter registration process.

50|$|One {{disadvantage}} of the Madrid {{system is that}} any refusal, withdrawal or cancellation of the basic application or <b>basic</b> <b>registration</b> within five years of the registration date of the international registration {{will lead to the}} refusal, withdrawal or cancellation of the international registration to the same extent. For example, if a basic application covers 'clothing, headgear and footwear,' and 'headgear' is then deleted from the basic application (for whatever reason), 'headgear' will also be deleted from the international application. Therefore, the protection afforded by the international registration in each designated member jurisdiction will only extend to 'clothing and footwear.' If the basic application is rejected as a whole, the international registration would also be totally refused.|$|E

Zero-copy protocols are essential for large message performance in high-speed networking.

MYRINET EXPRESS nowadays offers a <b>basic</b> <b>registration</b> cache scheme to reduce the overhead of that memory registration, but maintaining its consistency yet forces the user-space to monitor any changes in the virtual memory, which we show to be inefficient. After integrating ”VMA spy 2 ” in the LINUX kernel to perform this monitoring inside the kernel in a reliable way, we modify MYRINET EXPRESS to use it. We then demonstrate that MYRINET EXPRESS current implementation of the registration cache suffers from weaknesses. We therefore add a new caching facility in the MYRINET EXPRESS driver, giving it a reasonable grain-size that we show to be more adapted that DMA windows. MYRINET EXPRESS is then modified to integrate that new cache.

40|$|The {{results of}} a 1998 {{inventory}} of environmentally related health complaints (EHCs) registered by municipal health authorities (MHA) {{was found to be}} impeded by the lack of a uniform registry. Therefore it was recommended to assess the willingness of the MHAs to participate in a national inventory of environmentally related health complaints. This assessment phase was carried out in the spring of 2001 by means of a telephone questionnaire among all the MHAs. The results showed {{that a majority of the}} MHAs (80 %) considers the availability of a national database on EHC to be useful. The willingness to participate is considerable (85 %), although the best way to achieve the set-up of a national database was not clear in advance. This is due to the large number of different registration forms in use and the relatively small number of digital registrations carried out by MHAs. A content analysis of 80 % of the available registrations revealed common ground to all MHAs for several types of information registered. This included managerial information, information on the complainant, general information on the complaint, substantive information on the complaint, and type of action. Using these groupings, MHAs could set up a <b>basic,</b> uniform <b>registration</b> form to contain the following items: number of complaint; name, address, telephone number and GP of the complainant, with date of registration, former contacts with an MHA/GP, open-ended questions on health complaint and alleged cause, date of settlement, and type of action.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{determine}} those financial and nonfinancial measures used by small, independent, four year liberal arts colleges to assess their financial condition and the importance placed on these specific indicators. ^ Through review of the body of literature which addresses financial health indices and attendance at seminars and meetings demonstrating how to define and determine financial stress, a listing of frequently identified indicators was developed. The final design of the survey instrument was edited after consultation with experienced colleagues and other informed sources. This questionnaire elicits the maintenance and perceived importance of selected admissions, student enrollment, faculty, and institutional and departmental operating and performance data. The chief business officers of the sample population (193 colleges) were mailed the questionnaire. Seventy-six usable returns were the basis for the study 2 ̆ 7 s descriptive and evaluative discussion of institutional application of the statistics. ^ Analysis of the responses indicates that institutional performance measures are retained most frequently on the transactional level and their use diminishes with the need for integration of additional data, calculation of interdepartmental statistics or increased levels of aggregation. Availability and value may be ranked in the following hierarchical order: ADMISSIONS (recruitment flow process and yield rates), <b>BASIC</b> <b>REGISTRATION</b> (headcount by level and major, FTE 2 ̆ 7 s by level, retention, and student credit hour consumption), FACULTY (headcount, FTE 2 ̆ 7 s credit hours generated by discipline, and percent tenured), STUDENT TO FACULTY RATIOS, and ELEMENTARY FINANCIAL INFORMATION (expenditure distribution, comparisons of operating revenues to expenses and total assets to total liabilities). The use of standard enrollment units, such as FTE 2 ̆ 7 s or per student credit hour, is rated low. Discipline information (faculty compensation, tenure, work load, and instructional cost) is significantly less available than institutional information. Only student credit hours appear to be maintained consistently on both discipline and institutional level. The least available statistics are those relating to the analysis of the college 2 ̆ 7 s financial structure: instructional costs, fixed costs, and ratios among income and expenditure components. The more important determinants of costs (average number of students per course section, faculty load, and compensation by discipline) have a low perceived value as a health indicator. ^ This study reveals that the need still exists to incorporate valid and credible measures of quantitative as well as qualitative outcomes of institutional activities to determine the real cost of the achievement of both academic and societal goals and mission fulfillment. ...|$|E
40|$|Monitor Policy Stimulus Road Safety 2015 : {{research}} justification. The Policy Stimulus Road Safety 2012 contains 23 extra {{measures that}} the Ministry of Infrastructure and the Environment and its administrative and social partners {{want to take}} together {{to reduce the number}} of serious road injuries. This monitor presents the developments concerning the numbers of casualties, exposure and risk, discusses the progress of the implementation and, where possible, discusses the effects of the additional measures. This report serves as a background report to the brief version R- 2015 - 20, in which the main findings are summarized. The developments in numbers of casualties are considered for both the long and the short term: ? The long-term development; this indicator is the trend over the period 2005 - 2014, expressed in an average relative change per year. ? The short-term development; this indicator is the comparison of the number of casualties in the previous year (in this case 2014) with the average of the three preceding years (2011 - 2013). As in 2013, there were 570 road fatalities in 2014. The number of serious road injuries rose to 20, 700. The number of road fatalities decreased by 9 % compared with the average over the previous three years and shows an average decline of 4. 2 % per year during the period 2005 - 2014. After the number of fatalities among motorcyclists in 2013 being half that of the average in the years 2010 - 2012, their number in 2014 has once more increased to reach the earlier level. Over the longer term, the number of serious road injuries shows an average increase of 2. 9 % per year. Over the short term the increase is 7. 1 %. More than half the serious road injuries are bicycle casualties in crashes not involving motorized vehicles. The proportion in the total number of road crash casualties in the National <b>Basic</b> <b>Registration</b> Hospital Care (LZB) is increasing for this group. This is also the case for the proportion of casualties in the age group of 60 years and older. The proportion of seriously injured cyclists in crashes involving motor vehicles traffic also seems to have increased in recent years, from 8 % in 2010 to more than 11 % in 2014. Since the mobility did not show a clear rise or decline during the last decade, the risk shows a development similar to that of the number of casualties. Therefore, changes in the number of casualties cannot simply be attributed to changes in the mobility. The Policy Stimulus Road Safety correctly identifies cyclists and the over- 60 s as target groups. For these two groups the number of fatalities did not show a declining trend during the past ten years. In addition, the proportion of serious road injuries that is registered in the LZB increased for both groups. The relatively unfavourable development in the number of casualties among decline during the last ten years, from 11. 5 fatalities per billion km travelled in 2005 to 8. 7 fatalities in 2014. Another mobility development is the rise of the electric bike, which is increasingly used by older cyclists in particular. The risk of an injury crash (A&E treatment) is higher on an electric bicycle than on a regular bike. Other groups for which the number of road fatalities seems to develop less favourably are: ? mobility scooters, microcars and other vehicles for the disabled; ? 60 km/hour-roads. We recommend stricter monitoring for these groups and to formulate additional measures if necessary. The most important measure in the Policy Stimulus concerning cycling is the Local approach safe cycling. In 2014, the response to the survey in which municipalities can indicate how they proceed with this local approach was 74 % (n = 298). In 2013, this was 72 % (n = 289). The response rate has no longer shown a considerable increase since the strong rise in 2013 compared to 2012 when the response rate was 29 %. About 40 % of the municipalities (125 of the 298) that completed the survey in the web tool 'Safe cycling ' of the Dutch Cycling Embassy, have a local approach to safe cycling ready; 68 % of the municipalities are known to have already started the Local approach safe cycling (August 2015) or will start soon. The share was 65 % in 2014. The measures in the Policy Stimulus directed at the elderly are carried out in the framework of the programme Stay Mobile Safely (BVM) and are aimed at promoting safe mobility of the elderly. The programme will run until the end of 2015. In 2014 - 2015, the focus was on the pedestrian older than 60 and on a senior-friendly living environment. The other measures from the Policy Stimulus were largely completed in 2014. These measures are: ? the CROW-publication Basic characteristics intersections and roundabouts; ? Start of Safer 3; ? Triptych Safe Traffic: Safe Traffic Registration Centre — Safe Neighbourhood Actions —Neighbourhood label Safe Traffic; ? Signing of the STAR Safety Deal with the aim to improve the accident registration. It is now important to make the step to carrying out effect measurements to determine to what extent these measures contribute to road safety improvement. In 2014, additional road safety measures were taken outside the Policy Stimulus. For example, legislative changes have occurred (e. g. the introduction of the recidivism regulation multiple offenders and the suspension of the alcolock program). Furthermore, different road authorities have taken infrastructural measures to increase the safety of their roads. In the field of education and information a process was started to improve traffic education in schools. And finally, the accompanied driving trial 2 toDrive was continued and will run until 31 - 10 - 2017. It has been decided to enshrine accompanied driving in the law per 1 November 2017. In her 2014 letter to Dutch Parliament on the subject of serious road injuries, the Minister indicated that she is investigating a risk-based approach as a new basis for taking measures. SWOV is in favour of such an approach. Using such an approach, however, requires data on the safety of infrastructure and the behaviour of road users. In brief, the Policy Stimulus Policy Stimulus seems to have been a good step, but the permanent change for the better has not yet been deployed, especially concerning the number of serious road injuries. What is needed now is not only a plan with accompanying measures, but also to generate attention for the implementation of the measures. When the measures we already know to be effective have found their way to the street, substantial steps may be taken towards a decrease in the number of serious road injuries and a further decline in the number of fatalities...|$|E
