40|$|The {{target of}} the project was to {{investigate}} high bitrate (#>=# 1 Gbit/s) optical interconnection networks for future high performance signal processor systems. The programme covered <b>board-to-board</b> interconnections and interconnections between several boards via an optical star network or an optical matrix switch. Environmental tests and system investigations should be performed using the realised demonstrators. At the beginning planar as well as fiber-optical backplane networks were considered. The realised fiberoptical demonstrators fulfilled all system demands. The constructions, however, were bulky and expensive. A planar backplane avoids these drawbacks, however, suitable low loss waveguides were lacking. In the course of the project we succeeded in reducing the attenuation of multimode polymeric stripe waveguides to the required value of 1 to 3 dB/m. With the new technology large (19 '') and complex waveguide structures can be manufactured as necessary for backplane networks. For the transition from the board to the backplane we have developed a compact and connector-free solution with free space transmission and 90 beam deflection within the backplane. The free space coupling provides easy to control positioning tolerances of #+-# 500 #mu#m in lateral and > 20. 000 #mu#m in axial direction. For <b>board-to-board</b> demonstrators we used at first plastic optical fibers integrated into the backplane and later on polymeric stripe waveguides, too. We have successfully demonstrated the <b>board-to-board</b> concept as a snap-on front-plane and as a rear-plane using standard backplane connectors. The system marigin was as high as 10 dB. Investigations concerning the feasibility of switched networks showed that only electro-optical switch matrices are useful. Using developed components and demonstrators first aging and environmental tests (temperature, humidity, dust, vibrations) have been successfully performed. In summary we have reached all relevant project goals. Decisive breakthroughs have been achieved for <b>board-to-board</b> coupling and in the reduction of the attenuation of polymeric stripe waveguides. Thus the feasibility of planar optical backplane networks could be demonstrated. (orig.)

The impacts of device technology, the data-link topology of multiple-board interconnections, and the imaging mapping between stages are explored. Four types of free-space optical interconnects have been examined in terms of system complexity, scalablity, and alignability. In particular, the alignment tolerance of a symmetric optical interconnect is analytically studied. Comparison of alignment tolerances is carried out between a system with telecentric configuration and a system with maximum lens-to-waist configuration. It has been shown that interconnection between integrated microlenses/transmitters and microlenses/receivers is generally more alignment toleranced than that of non-optical integrated transmitters and receivers. Key issues are identified and explored in the design, implementation and characterization of three types of optical systems, namely macrolens based optical interconnect, microlens based optical interconnect and hybrid-lens based optical interconnect.
