25|$|During a June 2, 1875, {{experiment}} by Bell and {{his assistant}} Thomas Watson, a receiver reed {{failed to respond to}} the intermittent current supplied by an electric battery. Bell told Watson, who was {{at the other end of}} the line, to pluck the reed, thinking it had stuck to the pole of the magnet. Mr. Watson complied, and to his astonishment Bell heard a reed at his end of the line vibrate and emit the same timbre of a plucked reed, although there were no interrupted on-off-on-off currents from a transmitter to make it vibrate. A few more experiments soon showed that his receiver reed had been set in vibration by the magneto-electric currents induced in the line by the motion of the distant receiver reed in the neighborhood of its magnet. The <b>battery</b> <b>current</b> was not causing the vibration but was needed only to supply the magnetic field in which the reeds vibrated. Moreover, when Bell heard the rich overtones of the plucked reed, it occurred to him that since the circuit was never broken, all the complex vibrations of speech might be converted into undulating (modulated) currents, which in turn would reproduce the complex timbre, amplitude, and frequencies of speech at a distance.|$|E

2500|$|Its {{construction}} {{was that of}} a triple-sized modern telephone. The hollow ear piece was made in such a form to focus the sound waves direct to the operator's ear. A thin metal diaphragm was secured to the opposite end, a pair of magnets with a pivoted armature was secured to the frame of the armature, and connected with the diaphragm by means of a strut, thus keeping the armature from contracting poles of the magnets, which were energized by a <b>battery</b> <b>current.</b> When the current was closed, the armature held the diaphragm in magnetic suspension. The slightest change in the current manifested upon the diaphragm and upon all those on the same line. It was decided best to move everything in connection with developing and manufacturing this project to House's shop in Bridgeport, [...] also taking Royal House (who was then over 70 years old) and his wife with them.|$|E
2500|$|These {{consisted}} of a resonant reed, vibrated by an alternating magnetic field created by an AC electromagnet, with contacts that reversed {{the direction of the}} current on the negative half cycles. [...] They were used in low power devices, such as battery chargers, to rectify the low voltage produced by a step-down transformer. [...] Another use was in battery power supplies for portable vacuum tube radios, to provide the high DC voltage for the tubes. [...] These operated as a mechanical version of modern solid state switching inverters, with a transformer to step the battery voltage up, and a set of vibrator contacts on the transformer core, operated by its magnetic field, to repeatedly break the DC <b>battery</b> <b>current</b> to create a pulsing AC to power the transformer. [...] Then a second set of rectifier contacts on the vibrator rectified the high AC voltage from the transformer secondary to DC.|$|E

The results which I had by {{this time}} {{obtained}} with magnets led {{me to believe that}} the <b>battery</b> <b>current</b> through one wire, did, in reality, induce a similar current through the other wire, but that it continued for an instant only, and partook more {{of the nature of the}} electrical wave passed through from the shock of a common Leyden jar than of the current from a voltaic battery, and therefore might magnetise a steel needle, although it scarcely affected the galvanometer.|$|E

This result was the consequence of the cold metals having frozen the water where they touched it, and thus insulating the fluid part; and it well illustrates the non-conducting power of ice, by showing how thin a film could prevent the transmission of the <b>battery</b> <b>current.</b> Upon thawing parts of this thin film, at both metals, conduction occurred.|$|E

Other substances, {{which could}} not be melted on glass, were fused by the lamp and {{blowpipe}} on platina connected with one pole of the battery, and then a wire, connected with the other, dipped into them. In this way chloride of sodium, sulphate of soda, protoxide of lead, mixed carbonates of potash and soda, &c. &c., exhibited exactly the same phenomena as those already described: whilst liquid, they conducted and were decomposed; whilst solid, though very hot, they insulated the <b>battery</b> <b>current</b> even when four troughs were used.|$|E

If {{the circuit}} between the helix or wire under {{induction}} and the galvanometer or indicating spiral was not rendered complete before the connexion between the battery and the inducing wire was completed or broken, then no effects were perceived at the galvanometer. Thus, if the battery communications were first made, {{and then the}} wire under induction connected with the indicating helix, no magnetising power was there exhibited. But still retaining the latter communications, when those with the battery were broken, a magnet was formed in the helix, but of the second kind (14.), i.e. with poles indicating a current {{in the same direction}} to that belonging to the <b>battery</b> <b>current,</b> or to that always induced by that current at its cessation.|$|E

But {{when the}} iron {{cylinder}} {{is put into}} the same helix (31.), previous to the connexion being made with the battery, then the current from the latter may be considered as active in inducing innumerable currents of a similar kind to itself in the iron, rendering it a magnet. This is known by experiment to occupy time; for a magnet so formed, even of soft iron, does not rise to its fullest intensity in an instant, {{and it may be}} because the currents within the iron are successive in their formation or arrangement. But as the magnet can induce, as well as the <b>battery</b> <b>current,</b> the combined action of the two continues to evolve induced electricity, until their joint effect is at a maximum, and thus the existence of the deflecting force is prolonged sufficiently to overcome the inertia of the galvanometer needle.|$|E

When {{the battery}} contact {{was made in}} one direction, the galvanometer-needle was {{deflected}} on the one side; if made in the other direction, the deflection {{was on the other}} side. The deflection on breaking the battery contact was always the reverse of that produced by completing it. The deflection on making a battery contact always indicated an induced current in the opposite direction to that from the battery; but on breaking the contact the deflection indicated an induced current {{in the same direction as}} that of the battery. No making or breaking of the contact at B side, or in any part of the galvanometer circuit, produced any effect at the galvanometer. No continuance of the <b>battery</b> <b>current</b> caused any deflection of the galvanometer-needle. As the above results are common to all these experiments, and to similar ones with ordinary magnets to be hereafter detailed, they need not be again particularly described.|$|E

The proto-sulphuret of iron, {{the native}} per-sulphuret of iron, arsenical sulphuret of iron, native yellow sulphuret of copper and iron, grey {{artificial}} sulphuret of copper, artificial sulphuret of bismuth, and artificial grey sulphuret of tin, all conduct the voltaic <b>battery</b> <b>current</b> when cold, more or less, some giving sparks like the metals, others not being sufficient for that high effect. They {{did not seem}} to conduct better when heated, than before; but I had not time to enter accurately into the investigation of this point. Almost all of them became much heated by the transmission of the current, and present some very interesting phenomena in that respect. The sulphuret of antimony does not conduct the same current sensibly either hot or cold, but is amongst those bodies acquiring conducting power when fused (402.). The sulphuret of silver and perhaps some others decompose whilst in the solid state; but the phenomena of this decomposition will be reserved for its proper place in the next series of these Researches.|$|E

50|$|Page's {{innovation}} was {{to construct}} a spiral conductor having cups filled with mercury (element) as electrical connectors that were placed at various positions along its length. He then connected one terminal from an electrochemical cell battery to the inner cup of the spiral, and put the other battery terminal into some other cup of the spiral. The direct <b>battery</b> <b>current</b> flowed through the spiral, from cup to cup. He held a metal wand in each hand, and put these wands into the same two cups as where the battery terminals went — or any other pair of cups. When an assistant removed one of the battery terminals, stopping the current from going in the spiral, Page received a shock. He reported stronger shocks when his hands covered more of the spiral's length than where direct <b>battery</b> <b>current</b> went. He even felt shocks from parts of the spiral where no direct <b>battery</b> <b>current</b> passed. He used acupuncture needles, pierced into his fingers, to amplify his sense of shock. While Page advocated {{the use of this}} shocking device as a medical treatment, an early form of electrotherapy, his own interest lay in its heightening of electrical tension, or voltage above that of the low voltage battery input, and in its other electrical behaviors.
