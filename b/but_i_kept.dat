25|$|I {{had watched}} Ken Barrington – a great Test batsman – {{as a boy}} and when I broke into the England side in the late Seventies he became a father figure. In fact, he was a mentor {{to a lot of}} us then – myself, David Gower, Ian Botham, Mike Gatting. Ken was an England {{selector}} and assistant manager on the West Indies tour of 1981. There were no official coach in those days but it was to Ken that most of us turned. Unlike many retired pros, he never used the words, 'In my day...' On the first night of the Test, he suffered a heart attack in our hotel. I was woken the next morning at around 8am by tour manager Alan Smith and captain Ian Botham. I knew something was wrong, because Both was never up before then. They told me the news. I had tears in my eyes when we went out on to the pitch for the minute's silence and again when I was batting in the second innings. We needed over 500 to win and it soon became apparent that we weren't going to get them. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>kept</b> thinking of him and managed to make a hundred. Kenny was a counsellor, a friend and an inspiration.|$|E
500|$|In a {{significant}} {{scene in the}} book, Harry sees a memory of his own father humiliating Snape in their school days, and Snape insulting his mother after she stood up for him. In the film, it is abbreviated to an [...] "idea", in Goldenberg's words. [...] "It's an iconic moment when you realise your parents are normal, flawed human beings. ... Things get trimmed out, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>kept</b> the meat of that in there – {{and that was what}} really gave me the coming-of-age story." [...] Young Lily Potter did not appear at all, but promotional screenshots show unknown teenager Susie Shinner in the role.|$|E
500|$|... "There are {{no words}} to {{describe}} the weariness I feel today. I have not slept well in days, and when I do, there is no comfort. My dreams are violent and full of betrayal. Like my life, there's no escape. I feel the responsibility of this film. I cannot talk about Evita and her life without defending myself... Dear God, what have I gotten myself into? What is happening to me? Today we went to shoot a music video for my next song. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>kept</b> forgetting the lyrics, and felt like crying each and every time I did it. It was so frustrating. It's my own song!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't {{you speak}} to me!" [...] I burst out. It was on my lips to tell him of the letter to Washington, <b>but</b> somehow <b>I</b> <b>kept</b> silent.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now it is Olaf who taunts in his turn," [...] said Ragnar with a laugh. Then {{they both}} sprang after me, <b>but</b> always <b>I</b> <b>kept</b> ahead of them.|$|R
60|$|Before I was troubled, <b>I</b> went wrong: <b>but</b> {{now have}} <b>I</b> <b>kept</b> Thy Word.|$|R
500|$|Jamie Foster Brown in the 1994 {{issue of}} Sister 2 Sister wrote that [...] "R. Kelly {{told me that}} he and Aaliyah got {{together}} and it was just magic." [...] Brown also reported hearing about a relationship between them. [...] "I've been hearing about Robert and Aaliyah for a while—that she was pregnant. Or that she was coming and {{going in and out of}} his house. People would see her walking his dog, 12 Play, with her basketball cap and sunglasses on. Every time I asked the label, they said it was platonic. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>kept</b> hearing complaints from people about her being in the studio with all those men. At 15," [...] Brown said. [...] "you have all those hormones and no brains attached to them." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode—whose title means [...] "I wish" [...] in French—was {{written and}} {{directed}} by long-time X-Files contributor Vince Gilligan. Gilligan noted that, [...] "from the very beginning I always had the intention of directing an episode, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>kept</b> putting it off because I figured I didn't know enough." [...] Gilligan, however, soon learned directing techniques from his four-and-a-half years of experience on the show. As season seven neared its end and the rumors that the season would be the show's last, Gilligan decided to finally direct an episode. After approaching series creator Chris Carter, an episode set to be {{written and directed}} by Gilligan was green-lit. Initially, Gilligan's first script was a [...] "stark and scary" [...] outing for the show. However, as the deadline for the script grew closer, he relented and decided to write a more humorous episode.|$|E
500|$|As a teenager, Cruz became {{interested}} in acting after seeing the film Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down! (1990) by Spanish director Pedro Almodóvar. She did casting calls for an agent but was rejected multiple times because the agent {{felt that she was}} too young. Cruz commented on the experience, [...] "I was very extroverted as a kid.... I was studying when I was in high school at night, I was in ballet and I was doing castings. I looked for an agent and she sent me away three times because I was a little girl <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>kept</b> coming back. I'm still with her after all these years." [...] In 1989, at the age of 15, Cruz won an audition at a talent agency over more than 300 other girls. In 1999, Katrina Bayonas, Cruz's agent, commented, [...] "She was absolutely magic [...] It was obvious there was something very impressive about this kid.... She was very green, but there was a presence. There was just something coming from within." ...|$|E
6000|$|An idea {{leapt to}} my mind {{to the effect that}} she might have run away with {{somebody}} else, a thing which often happens in the world. <b>But</b> fortunately <b>I</b> <b>kept</b> it to myself and only said, ...|$|R
6000|$|Bernard nodded. [...] "Sometimes the {{primitive}} {{plan is the}} only plan. One can see that you have pluck enough to meet a crisis. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> have <b>kept</b> you and have some other calls." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{is quite}} true, sir; {{every word of}} it is true. I have been tempted to make out a worse case against the doctor, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> have <b>kept</b> myself to the bare truth." ...|$|R
500|$|The {{video screens}} showed both live shoots and special footage {{directed}} by Robson. Cohen worked by Danny O'Brien at BCC Video to create double-sided custom video LED cubes that hanged above stage right. There were three larger-sized video screens above the stage area. The gyrating wheel in which Spears opened {{the show was}} made by Branam Enterprises and was attached to a platform also created by Tait Towers. 171 white light [...] were provided by Spectra. The giant music box from which Spears emerged in [...] "Born to Make You Happy" [...] (1999) was designed by Michael Cotton. Confetti was shot from machines provided by Pyrotek. Pyrotechnics were done by Gerb Fountains, whereas artificial snow was provided by Little Blizzard. During the encore performance of [...] "...Baby One More Time" [...] (1998), there was a water screen {{in which it was}} poured nearly two tons of water pumped at 360 gallons a minute. Cohen said, [...] "The water screen is the keystone of the entire design because it impacts every system—electrics, staging, dancing. Rob discovered the company (Chameleon Productions of Orlando, Florida) that makes the screen, and I immediately looked at what they had in stock, which was a straight line. And I knew we didn't want a straight line. We wanted a circular water screen so we could physically build a shower for her to stand in the middle of and not get wet and then walk through when she wanted to. Of course, everyone thought I was crazy, so I suggested a six-sided shape. Everyone was concerned that the gaps between the sections might cause gaps in the actual sheets of water. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>kept</b> saying that if you put them 40' to 50' up in the air, gravity will cause the water to attach to itself, so you end up getting a solid sheet." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "It is {{with great}} sorrow, that I must write you these lines. Yesterday {{we have lost}} our beloved son (Niels Peter Joensen) during a whaling in Sandvík. The sea was so rough that two boats capsized, 9 men on board one and 6 in the other. I was myself on board one of these boats and {{was the only one}} who got rescued. Several times I got loose of the boat and was deep down in the sea, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>kept</b> {{grabbing}} the boat again. After a long time a boat came to rescue me. You must not think, that I was just glad to be rescued. It was just because of Mariane (his wife) and the daughters. My brother Hans also died. All together 14 young men and boys like Peter. It is an unbelievable grief, both out where he used to work, and not at least here at home." ...|$|E
2500|$|Adams {{initially}} {{may have}} met James Dean in December 1950 while jitterbugging for a soft drink commercial filmed at Griffith Park. Adams {{spent three years}} in the Coast Guard between the time this commercial was shot in late 1950 and the start of filming for Rebel Without a Cause in March 1955. Actor Jack Grinnage, who played Moose, recalled, [...] "Off the set, Nick, Dennis (Hopper), and the others would go out together--almost like the gang we portrayed--but Jimmy and Corey Allen... were not a part of that." [...] They became friends during filming. During breaks, Dean and Adams entertained cast and crew with impersonations of Marlon Brando and Elia Kazan (who had directed Dean in East of Eden). A 1955 Warner Brothers press release quoted Dean as saying, [...] "I shall be busy for the rest of 1955, and Nick will be doing film work for the next six months. Come 1956, however, I wouldn't be surprised to find myself with Adams doing a two-a-night nightclub routine--or acting in a comedy by William Shakespeare." [...] When production was wrapped, Dean said in another press release, [...] "I now regard Natalie (Wood), Nick, and Sal (Mineo) as co-workers; I regard them as friends... about the only friends I have in this town. And I hope we all work together again soon." [...] Following Dean's 1955 death in an automobile accident, Adams overdubbed some of Dean's lines for the film Giant (these are in Jett Rink's speech at the hotel) and dated co-star Natalie Wood. Adams tried to capitalize on Dean's fame through various publicity stunts, including a claim he was being stalked by a crazed female Dean fan, allowing himself to be photographed at Dean's grave in a contemplative pose, holding flowers, and surrounded by mourning, teenaged female fans along with writing articles and doing interviews about Dean for fan magazines. He also claimed to have developed Dean's affection for fast cars, later telling a reporter, [...] "I became a highway delinquent. I was arrested nine times in one year. They put me on probation, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>kept</b> on racing... nowhere." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It was, {{until we}} came in search of Bowen J. Tyler, Jr.," [...] replied Billings. [...] "We found him and sent him home with his bride; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> was <b>kept</b> a {{prisoner}} here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The monks {{are with}} him, then?" [...] said Hereward. [...] "That {{is one more}} count in their score. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> am no monk. I have shorn many a crown, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> have <b>kept</b> my own hair as yet, you see." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They {{are full}} of oil," [...] she said, [...] "and I have often been sorely tempted to drink it; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> have <b>kept</b> it untouched, knowing that my life might some day depend upon it." ...|$|R
60|$|To {{me it was}} {{his broken}} spirit that {{expressed}} itself, and I rebelled against his renunciation. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>kept</b> my own counsel.|$|E
60|$|He {{looked at}} the dog, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>kept</b> my eyes on him, and I saw {{intelligence}} creep back, like a blush, into his face.|$|E
60|$|It {{occurred}} to me that perhaps she was afraid that she too would be taken captive and eaten, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>kept</b> my reflection to myself.|$|E
6000|$|... "No; {{certainly}} not," [...] said Lopez, seating himself beside her. [...] "I {{have not}} taken the other half share, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> have <b>kept</b> my old venture in the scheme. I believe in Bios, you know." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "After {{that all}} trace of you was lost, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> still <b>kept</b> on advertising, for missing {{people have a}} {{wonderful}} way of turning up to claim fortunes, {{and you see the}} result. Here is the letter, Sir Leonard." ...|$|R
2500|$|Sowell {{announced}} {{the end of}} syndicated column on December 27, 2016. He wrote that, at age 86, [...] "the question is not why <b>I</b> am quitting, <b>but</b> why <b>I</b> <b>kept</b> at it so long", and cited a desire to focus on his photography hobby.|$|R
6000|$|... "When I {{could look}} up again all was changed, the banner nowhere in sight, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>kept</b> my saddle, {{and cut down}} half a dozen rascaille after that." ...|$|E
60|$|When I {{passed him}} {{next in the}} street he was very busy amalgamating Chinese tramways. It {{appeared}} {{that there was a}} ground floor in China, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>kept</b> off it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Wal, by all thet's lucky!" [...] he said, dismounting. [...] "I knowed we'd {{meet some}} day. I can't say I just laid fer you, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>kept</b> my eyes open." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't suppose they'd get anything. How it {{has been}} managed I don't know. I have worked like a galley slave at it, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> haven't <b>kept</b> the books, and I don't know how things have gone so badly. They have gone badly,--very badly." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The ground {{belongs to}} me. It {{is the only}} {{possession}} I have not relinquished. Everything else has gone from me, little by little, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> have <b>kept</b> this. It {{was the subject of}} the only determined resistance I made in all the wretched years." ...|$|R
60|$|For, he says--Before I was troubled, <b>I</b> went wrong: <b>but</b> {{now have}} <b>I</b> <b>kept</b> Thy Word. Whereas nine {{people out of}} ten would say to God, if they dared--Before I was troubled, <b>I</b> <b>kept</b> Thy Word. <b>But</b> now that <b>I</b> am troubled; of course I cannot help going wrong.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>kept</b> thinking, Now he's {{pleasant}} {{to her because}} he thinks it's to his interest. If she had no relation to 'Every Other Week,' he wouldn't waste his time on her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The doctor {{talked of}} some fearful shock, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>kept</b> my own counsel. At dawn Miriam {{came back to}} life at last. When she and I were left alone, she turned to me.|$|E
6000|$|... "And now then, my dear life, us {{be better}} to goo hoom and get you sommat warm. You'm mortal cold, I rackon, by now. I was cruel fear'd for ye: <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>kept</b> mun off clever, didn't I, now?" ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{could see}} how little indeed she minded now, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> also <b>kept</b> the thread of my own {{intellectual}} history. [...] "Yes. Your not liking it is what I speak of as the piece. I hold it, you see, up before you. What, artistically, would you do with it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "O yes, I {{would have}} done that;--and so did Miss Snow. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> would have <b>kept</b> my box locked. She should never have seen my letters." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Maybe so," [...] Trent answered, [...] "yet you'd {{have died}} in D.T. before now <b>but</b> for me! <b>I</b> <b>kept</b> you from {{it as far as}} I could. I'm going to keep you from it now!" ...|$|R
