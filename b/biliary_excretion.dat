With taurocholate (100 microM) in the influent perfusate, hypo-osmotic exposure (225 mosmol/l) increased taurocholate excretion into bile and bile flow by 42 and 27 % respectively, whereas inhibition by 32 and 47 % respectively was observed after hyperosmotic (385 mosmol/l) exposure. The effects of aniso-moticity on taurocholate excretion into bile was observed throughout aniso-osmotic exposure, even {{after completion of}} volume-regulatory ion fluxes and were fully reversible upon re-exposure to normo-osmotic media. Hypo-osmotic cell swelling (225 mosmol/l) increased the Vmax. of taurocholate translocation from the sinusoidal compartment into bile about 2 -fold. Also, cell swelling induced by glutamine and glycine stimulated both bile flow and <b>biliary</b> taurocholate <b>excretion.</b> There was a close relationship between the aniso-osmotically and amino-acid-induced change of cell volume and taurocholate excretion into bile.

40|$|BACKGROUNDS & AIMS: ATP 8 B 1 is a {{phosphatidylserine}} flippase in the canalicular membrane; {{patients with}} mutations in ATP 8 B 1 develop severe chronic (PFIC 1) or periodic (BRIC 1) cholestatic liver disease. We {{have observed that}} Atp 8 b 1 deficiency leads to enhanced <b>biliary</b> cholesterol <b>excretion.</b> It has been established that <b>biliary</b> cholesterol <b>excretion</b> depends on transport by the heterodimer Abcg 5 /Abcg 8. We hypothesized that the increased cholesterol output was due to enhanced extraction from the altered canalicular membrane rather than to higher Abcg 5 /Abcg 8 activity. We therefore studied the relation between Abcg 5 /Abcg 8 expression and <b>biliary</b> cholesterol <b>excretion</b> in mice lacking Atp 8 b 1, Abcg 8, or both (GF mice). METHODS: Bile formation was studied in LXR agonist-fed wild-type mice as well as mice lacking Atp 8 b 1 or Abcg 8, or in GF mice upon infusion of taurocholate. Bile samples were analyzed for cholesterol, bile salt, phospholipids, and ectoenzyme content. RESULTS: LXR agonist increased Abcg 5 / 8 expression, and this was accompanied by increased biliary cholesterol output in both wild-type and Atp 8 b 1 (G 308 V/G 308 V) mice. However, Atp 8 b 1 (G 308 V/G 308 V) mice maintained higher cholesterol output. Although in Abcg 8 (-/-) mice biliary cholesterol output was severely reduced, GF mice displayed high biliary cholesterol output, which was comparable with wild-type mice. Bile of both Atp 8 b 1 (G 308 V/G 308 V) and GF mice displayed elevated levels of phosphatidylserine and sphingomyelin, indicating membrane stress. CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate that the increased <b>biliary</b> cholesterol <b>excretion</b> in Atp 8 b 1 -deficient mice is independent of Abcg 5 / 8 activity. This implicates that Atp 8 b 1 deficiency leads to {{a decrease in the}} detergent resistance and subsequent nonspecific extraction of cholesterol from the canalicular membrane by bile salt...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{suggested}} that copper is incompletely incorporated into caeruloplasmin, the major plasma form of copper-transporting protein, in the genetic copper toxic condition, Wilson's disease. In this paper we have investigated the role of copper and caeruloplasmin in the abnormal biliary copper transport and characterizes Wilson's disease. Using SDS/PAGE and Western blotting, we have demonstrated the presence of holocaeruloplasmin in liver samples from patients with Wilson's disease (abnormal <b>biliary</b> copper <b>excretion)</b> and in control patients (normal <b>biliary</b> copper <b>excretion).</b> The presence of holocaeruloplasmin was also confirmed by measurement of caeruloplasmin oxidase activity using staining with o'Dianisidine. In contrast with the findings in liver tissue, holocaeruloplasmin was absent from bile from patients with Wilson's disease, but as expected it was present in the bile from control subjects. We have also identified and partially characterized a 189 - 200 kDa protein from purified human biliary canalicular membranes which binds copper and possesses caeruloplasmin-like activity when probed with a specific human anti-caeruloplasmin antibody. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that copper incorporation in caeruloplasmin is normal in patients with Wilson's disease contrary to previous reports. Secondly, we have shown that the defect in Wilson's disease appears to lie in the <b>biliary</b> canalicular <b>excretion</b> of holocaeruloplasmin resulting in its retention within the hepatocyte causing copper toxicosis. Finally we have identified and partially characterized a caeruloplasmin-binding protein from biliary canalicular membranes which may provide a link to the gene defect in Wilson's disease...|$|R

The effects of acute and chronic administration of AP on bile secretory parameters were investigated in vivo in normal and bile duct ligated (BDL) rats and in vitro in isolated rat bile duct units (IBDU), In vivo, acute AP administration decreased bile now and <b>biliary</b> bicarbonate <b>excretion</b> and abolished secretin choleresis in BDL rats but not in normal rats. On the contrary, the AP inhibitor, levamisole, increased in BDL rat bile flow and <b>biliary</b> bicarbonate <b>excretion.</b> In vitro, basal and secretin-stimulated Cl(-) /HCO(3) (-) exchanger activity in IBDU was immediately inhibited by AP intraluminal microinjection (apical exposure) but only after a prolonged exposure to the basolateral pole. Levamisole increased the Cl(-) /HCO(3) (-) exchanger activity of IBDU, A significant basolateral uptake of AP occurs in IBDU with a progressive transport to the apical domain. AP chronic treatment increased AP and gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase (gamma-GT) activities in the intrahepatic bile ducts and hepatocyte canalicular pole, promoted enlargement of bile canaliculi, and decreased bile flow and <b>biliary</b> bicarbonate <b>excretion.</b> In conclusion, the intrahepatic biliary epithelium plays a role in the uptake and biliary secretion of serum AP. AP inhibits the secretory processes of the intrahepatic biliary epithelium and induces features of intrahepatic cholestasis after chronic administration.

25|$|Copper is {{imported}} into cells through the cell wall by the plasma {{membrane transport protein}} known as Copper Transporter 1, or Ctr1. Ctr1 rapidly binds to intracellular copper chaperone proteins. Atox1 delivers copper to the secretory pathway and docks with either copper-transporting ATPase ATP7B in the liver or ATP7A in other cells. ATP7B directs copper to plasma ceruloplasmin or to <b>biliary</b> <b>excretion</b> in concert with a newly discovered chaperone, Murr1, the protein missing in canine copper toxicosis. ATP7A directs copper within the trans-Golgi network to the proteins dopamine beta-monooxygenase, peptidylglycine alpha-amidating monooxygenase, lysyl oxidase, and tyrosinase, depending on the cell type. CCS is the copper chaperone for the Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase that protects cells against reactive oxygen species; it delivers copper in the cytoplasm and intermitochondrial space. Cox17 delivers copper to mitochondria to cytochrome c oxidase via the chaperones Cox11, Sco1, and Sco2. Other copper chaperones may exist and might include metallothionein and amyloid precursor protein (APP). Genetic and nutritional studies have illustrated the essential nature of these copper-binding proteins.|$|E
25|$|The {{transport}} and metabolism of copper in living organisms {{is currently the}} subject of much active research. Copper transport at the cellular level involves the movement of extracellular copper across the cell membrane and into the cell by specialized transporters. In the bloodstream, copper is carried throughout the body by albumin, ceruloplasmin, and other proteins. The majority of blood copper (or serum copper) is bound to ceruloplasmin. The proportion of ceruloplasmin-bound copper can range from 70-95% and differs between individuals, depending, for example, on hormonal cycle, season, and copper status. Intracellular copper is routed to sites of synthesis of copper-requiring enzymes and to organelles by specialized proteins called metallochaperones. Another set of these transporters carries copper into subcellular compartments. Certain mechanisms exist to release copper from the cell. Specialized transporters return excess unstored copper to the liver for additional storage and/or <b>biliary</b> <b>excretion.</b> These mechanisms ensure that free unbound toxic ionic copper is unlikely to exist in {{the majority of the population}} (i.e., those without genetic copper metabolism defects).|$|E

METHODS: After injection of 0. 5 mg/kg of indocyanine green (ICG), bile draining from each hepatic lobe was collected separately for 6 hours. <b>Biliary</b> ICG <b>excretion</b> in each hepatic lobe was estimated and compared with hepatic lobar volume measured by computed tomographic volumetry before and an average of 11 days after RPE. RESULTS: Right portal vein embolization produced {{a significant increase in}} bile volume and biliary ICG concentration in the left lobe, resulting in a significant increase in ICG excretion in the left lobe. The percentage of ICG excretion in the left lobe to the whole-liver excretion showed a mean increase of 20. 1 %, which was statistically significant. In contrast, the percentage of left lobar volume to the total liver volume increased by only 8. 3 %. CONCLUSIONS: Measurement of <b>biliary</b> ICG <b>excretion</b> is useful for estimating changes of hepatic lobar function and has revealed that within 11 days RPE enhances functional capacity in the left lobe compared with volume gain without affecting total liver function...|$|R

Intracellular organelles were visualized by fluorescence microscopy. The distribution of ATP 7 B was {{compared with that of}} Rab 7 and Niemann-Pick C 1 (NPC 1), proteins that localize in the late endosomes.

The present study aimed to test the impact of acute inflammation as well as selected acute phase proteins on RCT with a macrophage-to-feces in vivo RCT assay using intraperitoneal administration of [3 H]cholesterol-labeled macrophage foam cells. In patients with acute sepsis, cholesterol efflux toward plasma and HDL were significantly decreased (P < 0. 001). In mice, acute inflammation (75 µg/mouse lipopolysaccharide) decreased [3 H]cholesterol appearance in plasma (P < 0. 05) and tracer excretion into feces both within bile acids (− 84 %) and neutral sterols (− 79 %, each P < 0. 001). In the absence of systemic inflammation, overexpression of serum amyloid A (SAA, adenovirus) reduced overall RCT (P < 0. 05), whereas secretory phospholipase A 2 (sPLA 2, transgenic mice) had no effect. Myeloperoxidase injection reduced tracer appearance in plasma (P < 0. 05) as well as RCT (− 36 %, P < 0. 05).

Control mice and mice homozygous for Mdr 1 a/b (Abcb 1) or Mdr 2 (Abcb 4) gene disruption, the latter unable to secrete phospholipids and cholesterol into bile, were treated with griseofulvin to chemically induce protoporphyria. All groups showed dramatically increased PP levels in erythrocytes and liver after griseofulvin treatment. Histologically, massive PP deposits were found in livers of control and Mdr 1 a/b(-/-) mice but not in those of Mdr 2 (-/-) mice. Serum unesterified cholesterol and phospholipids were increased by griseofulvin because of formation of lipoprotein-X in control and Mdr 1 a/b(-/-) mice only.

Serum bilirubin concentrations decreased in all patients after administration of 1 - 2 mumol/kg body weight of the metalloporphyrin, given in two doses eight to 24 hours apart. This reduction lasted approximately four to five days after injection of the compound.

Biliary bilirubin concentrations decreased (mean decrease, 49 %) in the haemochromatosis patients after Sn-protoporphyrin administration.
