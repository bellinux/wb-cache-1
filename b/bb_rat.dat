50|$|Professor Ono {{has studied}} on ocular surface {{inflammation}} and the immune basis of age-related macular degeneration. His early work {{focused on the}} association of certain MHC haplotypes with susceptibility and resistance to type 1 diabetes. Using a number of recombinant and congenic rat strains, the work mapped susceptibility genes in the <b>BB</b> <b>rat</b> to the class II MHC loci. His work also showed that class I and II MHC gene products are expressed at higher levels or de novo on the insulin-producing beta cells of the islets of Langerhans. He focused much of his research {{in the next decade}} on the regulation of MHC gene expression. He showed that the different class II MHC isotypes are differentially expressed and showed that the X2-box cis-element controls this differential expression. His work also showed that the bZIP transcription factor: XBP1 forms a hetero-dimer with c-Fos. This {{has turned out to be}} relevant to the developmental control of B cell differentiation. His lab also discovered the NFX1 transcription factor and cloned both the human and murine cDNAs. This factor can bind DNA, RNA and protein via a reiterated RING finger motifs in the central domain of the polypeptide. The protein appears to have important roles in neuronal development and mRNA transport. NFX1 is also a probable E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase. These enzymes are of interest as they have been shown to participate in 3 metabolic pathways: ubiquitin mediated proteolysis, parkinson's disease, and huntington's disease. His lab also demonstrated that the non- histone chromosomal protein HMGA is required for the induction of multiple genes, including MHC genes, interferon-gamma and rhodopsin. They mapped the interaction of HMGA1a and the paired homeodomain motif within Crx and showed that these interactions help recruit such transcriptional activators to the promoter/enhancer.|$|E

In order to investigate the role of micro-environmental factors in the T-cell maturation in <b>BB</b> <b>rats</b> the postnatal development of macrophage subpopulations and T-lymphocyte subsets, {{in addition to the}} specific immune response in situ, were studied in thymus, spleen and lymph nodes of <b>BB</b> <b>rats.</b> Wistar rats were used as controls. From the day of birth on, a severe reduction was noticed in the macrophage subpopulations in the thymic cortex of <b>BB</b> <b>rats,</b> but not in spleen and lymph nodes, as compared to Wistar rats. The population of T-suppressor/cytotoxic cells (OX 8 -positive cells) did not increase any longer from Day 10 after birth in the thymic cortex and from Day 14 in spleen and lymph nodes. This is indicative for an intrathymic maturational defect of the OX 8 -positive cells in <b>BB</b> <b>rats.</b> No deviations could be observed {{in the development of the}} T-helper (ER 2 -positive) cell population. Young adult <b>BB</b> <b>rats</b> were as capable as Wistars of developing a specific immune response to thymus-independent (TI) antigens, but the response to a thymus-dependent (TD) antigen was delayed and decreased.

40|$|Perisinusoidal {{fibrosis}} is a {{vascular lesion}} {{observed in the}} liver of type I diabetic patients. To investigate whether this liver lesion is secondary to hyperglycemia or whether it represents a separate collagen vascular disorder, the authors studied the structure of liver sinusoids in genetically susceptible <b>BB</b> <b>rats</b> in which a spontaneous diabetes develops similar to human type I diabetes. Seven diabetic insulin-treated <b>BB</b> <b>rats,</b> 7 nondiabetic <b>BB</b> <b>rats,</b> and 6 control non-BB rats were studied. Histologic abnormalities of the collagen network were detected on trichrome-stained sections. Perisinusoidal collagen fibers were quantified ultrastructurally by the point-counting method. All control non-BB rats had normal livers; 86 % of the diabetic as well as 71 % of the nondiabetic <b>BB</b> <b>rats</b> displayed localized sinusoidal thickening corresponding ultrastructurally to perisinusoidal fibrosis; in these abnormal rats the percentage of collagen fibers per sinusoid unit {{was significantly higher than}} that in controls. Fibrous septa (2 diabetic and 5 nondiabetic <b>BB</b> <b>rats)</b> and liver nodulation (3 diabetic and 1 nondiabetic <b>BB</b> <b>rats)</b> were also observed. Perisinusoidal fibrosis is a frequent liver vascular abnormality in a strain of rats genetically predisposed to the development of type I diabetes. The lesion is independent of the presence of diabetes. These observations suggest that liver perisinusoidal fibrosis in patients with type I diabetes might be linked to a genetic abnormality rather than to hyperglycemia per se...|$|R
40|$|Evidence is accumulating {{that the}} {{development}} of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus involves autoimmune phenomena, both in the human and in the <b>BB</b> <b>rat</b> model. A strong association is observed in both cases with alleles of the class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC). Results of the present study show that autoimmune phenomena, as assessed by the presence of clinical diabetes or histological thyroiditis, are prevented by the injection of monoclonal antibodies to class II gene products in the <b>BB</b> <b>rat.</b> Immunosuppression was specifically obtained with a monoclonal antibody to the murine I-E equivalent, as opposed to the murine I-A equivalent, of the rat major histocompatibility complex.

The frequent occurrence of anaphylactic type deaths in young (1 month old) animals receiving more than six weekly injections of partially purified homologous (rat) monoclonal antibodies to rat class II gene products underscores the potential risks of this type of immunotherapy.

40|$|Upon {{stimulation}} with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), peritoneal macrophages from diabetes-prone Bio-Breeding (<b>BB)</b> <b>rats</b> secrete more tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) than macrophages from diabetes-resistant BB or normal Wistar rats. Enhanced transcription {{was demonstrated}} by Northern blot analysis {{and at the}} single cell level by mRNA: RNA hybridization. Cytofluorometry analysis showed 2 - 4 times more plasma membrane and total cell-associated TNF-alpha in macrophages of diabetes-prone <b>BB</b> <b>rats.</b> The analysis of fluorescence intensity showed a single peak, and TNF-alpha mRNA was found in > 90 % of macrophages. These findings exclude TNF hypersecretion as being due to an abnormal subfraction of cells. TNF-alpha gene hyperexpression in diabetes-prone <b>BB</b> <b>rats</b> was not due to mutations in the regulatory regions of the promoter, which could be shown by cloning and sequencing of the TNF-alpha promoter in the three rat strains. When searching for other regulatory defects we found the production of prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2) in response to LPS {{to be up to}} 10 times lower in macrophages from diabetes-prone <b>BB</b> <b>rats</b> than from Wistar <b>rats.</b> Furthermore, <b>BB</b> <b>rats</b> macrophages required significantly higher concentrations of PGE 2 for suppression of TNF-alpha secretion.

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{investigate}} whether various beta-cell stimulatory drugs, given neonatally, influence the incidence of diabetes in <b>BB</b> <b>rats.</b> Newborn <b>BB</b> <b>rats</b> were treated twice daily for 6 days and diabetes development was observed during the following 200 -day study period. Compared to a diabetes incidence of 63. 8 % in 163 control <b>BB</b> <b>rats</b> which received saline or were untreated, the percentage of experimental <b>BB</b> <b>rats</b> that developed diabetes was as follows in the different subgroups: arginineglucose: 47 % (n= 73, p < 0. 02); glucagon: 37 % (n = 93, p < 0. 0001); tolbutamide-glucose: 36 % (n = 58, p < 0. 0005); and theophylline-glucose: 39 % (n = 41, p < 0. 005). A long-term arginine-glucose treatment was not superior to the shorter neonatal treatment. Histological examination revealed a higher degree of insulitis in diabetic than in non-diabetic animals but no difference according to the kind of treatment was observed. Finally, we found that the diabetes incidence in <b>BB</b> <b>rats</b> was higher in the first litter compared to subsequent litters (p = 0. 04).

Hypoglycemic neuropathy was characterized by slowing of nerve conduction velocity, marked loss of anterior horn motoneurons and Wallerian degeneration, as well as loss of large myelinated fibers, suggesting a neuropathy involving predominantly motoneurons. Diabetic neuropathy was not associated with nerve cell loss but showed marked axonal atrophy involving predominantly sensory fibers.

In both strains, thymectomy (Tx) was followed by a decrease in peripheral T cell numbers, which was proportionally larger in <b>BB</b> <b>rats.</b> The decline of the Thy- 1 + recent thymic migrant (RTM) T cell phenotype was similar in both strains. <b>BB</b> <b>rats</b> showed a rapid preferential loss of CD 8 + and CD 45 RC+ T cells, whereas the relative loss of RT 6 + T cells was proportional to that of all T cells and not significantly different from that in PVG rats. Tx at 8 -week did not prevent diabetes. Tx of 4 -week-old <b>BB</b> <b>rats</b> revealed essentially the same changes in peripheral T cell subset distribution as in 8 -week-old animals. However, Tx at week 4 did prevent diabetes. Since this raised the possibility of a temporary requirement of CD 8 + T cells for the development of diabetes, we performed CD 8 depletions during different pre-diabetic intervals. We found that CD 8 depletion from 4 to 8 and 4 to 14 weeks, but not from 8 to 14 weeks of age prevented diabetes. We conclude that the protective effect of early adult Tx is, at least in part, due to the rapid loss of CD 8 + T cells, and that these cells are only required between 4 and 8 weeks of age for diabetes to develop in <b>BB</b> <b>rats...</b>|$|R

Such defects were absent in eight normal rat strains. 2) Thymic epithelial defects are absent at birth, but present in <b>BB</b> <b>rats</b> at 4 weeks of age. 3) The genetic predisposition to thymic epithelial defects is an autosomal dominant trait. 4) The observation of thymic defects in (DP x WF) F 1 rats led to the prediction that such animals, which never develop spontaneous autoimmunity, might be susceptible to its induction. Following depletion of RT 6 + T cells we observed diabetes in 91 %, and thyroiditis in 43 %, of treated F 1 animals (n = 23). Pancreatic insulitis was uniformly present.

D beta HVRIII, cloned polymerase chain reaction-amplified DNA into M 13 mp 18, and confirmed the presence of the susceptibility sequence (SS) (RRRAA) by the dideoxy sequencing method in a colony of DR BB/Wor-UTM rats. When immunized with human type II collagen (CII) in incomplete Freunds adjuvant (IFA), arthritis developed rapidly by day 10 with 100 % incidence.

40|$|The <b>BB</b> <b>rat</b> {{develops}} a syndrome of autoimmune diabetes similar to Type I diabetes of man. It {{also has a}} severe T cell lymphopenia. As {{part of an ongoing}} breeding program to transfer the diabetogenic genes of the <b>BB</b> <b>rat</b> onto inbred rat strain backgrounds, diabetic animals were used in a backcross (BC) - intercross (IC) -backcross breeding scheme with Brown Norway (BN), Lewis (L), and Wistar-Furth (WF) inbred rats. We have used monoclonal antibodies to analyze both lymphopenia and major histocompatibility (MHC) antigens (the RT 1 locus in the rat) in relation to the development of diabetes. To examine T cell subsets we used a panel of monoclonal antibodies, in particular W 3 / 25 and OX 19, which discriminate the abnormal phenotype better than W 3 / 13. In our breeding program, at least two independent genes or gene complexes are required for the expression of diabetes. One gene determines the lymphopenia, is inherited by simple autosomal recessive genetics and is not linked to the MHC. The second gene is linked to the MHC. Both genes are necessary, but neither gene is sufficient by itself for the development of diabetes...|$|E
40|$|Long-term {{treatment}} with recombinant interleukin- 2 (IL- 2) of diabetes-prone BB rats had contrasting effects {{in two different}} <b>BB</b> <b>rat</b> sublines. Diabetes development was enhanced in the subline with a low intrinsic diabetes risk and suppressed in the subline with a high diabetes risk. IL- 2 treatment started between 35 and 42 days of age and lasted for 3 months. In subline 1, diabetes incidence increased from 23 % to 53 % (P less than 0. 01), in subline 2 it decreased from 73 % to 32 % (P less than 0. 01). The two sublines differed in serum levels of factors controlling IL- 2 synthesis and activity. Mean IL- 2 inhibitory activity was higher in subline 2 (between 140 % and 290 % of levels in subline 1, P less than 0. 01). Conversely, mean concentrations of thymosin alpha 1 and beta 4 were higher in subline 1 (between 140 % and 200 % of levels in subline 2, P less than 0. 01). Thus the two sublines differ in their response to exogenous IL- 2 and also in serum levels of mediators affecting availability of IL- 2. We conclude that an internal network of hormonal factors, including IL- 2, contributes to the control of diabetes development in the <b>BB</b> <b>rat...</b>|$|E
40|$|<b>BB</b> <b>rats</b> {{serve as}} a model for human insulin-dependent {{diabetes}} mellitus (IDDM), since without insulin treatment, most 60 - 140 -d-old animals die within 1 to 2 wk of developing polyuria, polydypsia, hyperglycemia, and hypoinsulinemia. Lymphoid cells accumulate in the islets of Langerhans and beta cells undergo destruction. We report that inoculation of such <b>BB</b> <b>rats</b> with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (Armstrong strain, clone 13) reduces over a prolonged period the incidence of IDDM, normalizes the concentration of blood sugar and pancreatic insulin, prevents the mononuclear cell infiltration in the islets of Langerhans, and for a short time after inoculation alters T lymphocyte subsets. Thus, a virus might be programmed to carry out useful functions...|$|R
40|$|<b>BB</b> Wistar <b>rats</b> are a {{partially}} inbred line of rats prone to develop insulindependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), l usually between 60 and 140 d of age (1 - 5). The disease {{is characterized by}} the sudden onset of severe hyperglycemia, glycosuria, and weight loss followed by death within a few days unless insulin is administered. Thus, clinically, this disease closely resembles human insulindependent diabetes mellitus (type 1, or juvenile onset diabetes). Histologically, <b>BB</b> <b>rats</b> show pancreatic mononuclear cell infiltrates (PMI) (also called pancreatic lymphocytic infiltrates [PLI]), which are found initially around ducts and acini (before the onset of diabetes) and eventually involve islets of Langerhans (insulitis). At this stage, there is severe beta cell destruction and hence, insulinopenia (5). By electron microscopy and/or immunohistochemical techniques these mononuclear cell infiltrates can be identified as macrophages, T cells, and B cells. Occasionally, eosinophils are also present. In our hands, approximately one in three <b>BB</b> <b>rats</b> develops overt diabetes. However, some rats remain normoglycemic despite the histological presence o...|$|R
40|$|Spontaneous type 1 {{diabetes}} in <b>BB</b> <b>rats</b> {{is dependent on the}} RT 1 (u) MHC haplotype and homozygosity for an allele at the Lyp locus, which is responsible for a peripheral T-lymphopenia. Genetic studies have shown that there are other, as yet unidentified, genetic loci contributing to diabetes susceptibility in this strain. <b>BB</b> <b>rats</b> carrying wild-type Lyp alleles are not lymphopenic and are resistant to spontaneous diabetes (DR). Here we show that thymectomy and exposure to one sublethal dose of gamma-irradiation (TX-R) at 4 weeks of age result in the rapid development of insulitis followed by {{diabetes in}} 100 % of DR rats. Administration of CD 4 (+) 45 RC(-) T-cells from unmanipulated, syngeneic donors immediately after irradiation prevents the disease. Splenic T-cells from TX-R-induced diabetic animals adoptively transfer {{type 1 diabetes}} to T-deficient recipients. ACI, WF, WAG, BN, LEW, PVG, and PVG. RT 1 (u) strains are resistant to TX-R-induced insulitis/diabetes. Genetic analyses revealed linkage between regions on chromosomes 1, 3, 4, 6, 9, and 16, and TX-R-induced type 1 diabetes in a cohort of nonlymphopenic F(2) (Wistar Furth x BBDP) animals. This novel model of TX-R-induced diabetes in nonlymphopenic <b>BB</b> <b>rats</b> can be used to identify environmental and cellular factors that are responsible for the initiation of antipancreatic autoimmunity...|$|R
