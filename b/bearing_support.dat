The shaft lays in a shallow groove of the neck bearing block and is kept in position by the weight of the rotating assembly. The tail <b>bearing</b> <b>supports</b> the remainder of the vertical weight and any (horizontal) thrust generated by the wind. The neck bearing does not react any thrust forces.|$|R

40|$|Many machine components, which {{work in the}} Elastohydrodynamic (EHD) {{lubrication}} regime, including transportation bearings, reciprocating engines, geared transmissions experience vibrations, which {{result in}} a rapid variation of contact load or entrainment speed. The <b>bearings</b> <b>supporting</b> the main spindle of machine tools are subjected to vibrations generated by the cutting process, the gearbox, geometrical inaccuracies and also vibrations from the surrounding environment.

40|$|The {{choice of}} power {{conversion}} technology {{is critical in}} directing {{the design of a}} space vehicle for the future NASA mission to Mars. One candidate design consists of a foil <b>bearing</b> <b>supported</b> turbo alternator driven by a helium-xenon gas mixture heated by a nuclear reactor. The system is a closed-loop, meaning there is a constant volume of process fluid that is sealed from the environment. Therefore, foil bearings are proposed due to their ability to use the process gas as a lubricant. As such, the rotor dynamics of a foil <b>bearing</b> <b>supported</b> rotor {{is an important factor in}} the eventual design. The current work describes a rotor dynamic analysis to assess the viability of such a system. A brief technology background, assumptions, analyses, and conclusions are discussed in this report. The results indicate that a foil <b>bearing</b> <b>supported</b> turbo alternator is possible, although more work will be needed to gain knowledge about foil bearing behavior in helium-xenon gas...|$|R

50|$|Critical speed {{depends upon}} the {{magnitude}} and location of the shaft unbalance, {{the length of the}} shaft, its diameter, and the kind of <b>bearing</b> <b>support.</b> Many practical applications suggest as good practice that the maximum operating speed should not exceed 75% of the critical speed; however, there are cases that require speeds above the critical speed to work correctly. In such cases, it is important to accelerate the shaft through the first natural frequency quickly so that large deflections don't develop.|$|E

50|$|The mazda BPD engine (also {{commonly}} referred to as a BP2) was a revamp of the original BP engine (sometimes called BP1 for clarity's sake). It featured a larger crank nose, larger piston oil squirters, a main <b>bearing</b> <b>support</b> plate, better flowing inlet and exhaust ports. This was also the base engine for the Mazda Familia GT-R and GT-Ae. It is commonly known as the 'big turbo' variant as it utilised a much larger IHI RHF6CB water-cooled turbocharger(vj23). The BPD was used {{as the basis for the}} engine, with changes such as sodium-filled exhaust valves, larger (and front-mounted) intercooler, larger (440 cc) low impedance fuel injectors and stronger engine internals helping to up the performance of the engine to produce 209 hp (156 kW) and 184 lb·ft (255 N·m). The VICS system of the N/A BP has been removed, as well as the boost cut from the ecu. This engine was designed to power Mazda to a world rally championship win, and was thus used in the limited production Mazda Familia GT-R (2,200 built) and GTAe (300 built).|$|E

50|$|The Palm Harbor Museum (formerly called North Pinellas Historical Museum) {{is located}} in the {{historic}} Hartley House in Palm Harbor, Florida. The house was built by Thomas W. Hartley between 1914 and 1919, on property bought by his father, James Hartley, about 1880. The house was designed to accommodate the Hartley Family (Thomas, his wife Ida Stanton Hartley and their children Lucy, Clarine, Leonard and Orion). The house was built on a reinforced concrete foundation with concrete block construction. The blocks were poured on-site, made with white sane from a nearby scrub. The outside surfaces of the blocks were cast to simulate a stone finish. Each block weighed 84 pounds and the blocks were joined with pink mortar, which is said to have gotten its unusual color from crushed berries. A hall ran the length of the downstairs and its walls were reinforced concrete to provide <b>bearing</b> <b>support</b> for the second floor. Downstairs rooms have 10 foot high ceilings and upstairs are 8 feet high. The upstairs rooms and two of the planned porches were never completed by the family due to shortage of funds. The house was acquired in 1996 by Pinellas County as part of the extension of Belcher Rd; it is under the management of the Heritage village and houses the Palm Harbor Museum which is dedicated to preserving the history of Palm Harbor, Crystal Beach, Florida, Ozona, and Curlew from the 1800s to the present.|$|E
5000|$|The 431-cubic-inch {{displacement}} 1938-40 Cadillac V16 {{was one of}} {{the last}} new American auto engine designs prior to World War Two. As such, it incorporated some of the latest thinking. Nine main bearings provided a crankshaft main <b>bearing</b> <b>support</b> between each 135 degree opposing pair of cylinders. The square bore and stroke lowered piston speed and promoted crankshaft rigidity, no small matter for an engine with eight cylinders in line per cylinder bank. The side valve engine design was no handicap for the time because the era's typical top engine speed of 3400-3700 rpm provided little opportunity to exploit the high speed breathing efficiency of overhead valves. Luxury car drivers presumably valued smoothness and silence more than high speed power. Hydraulic valve lifters promoted silent running and an absence of periodic adjustment. Unlike most cars of the era, an external oil filter safeguarded the precision valve lifters. Despite the use of side valves, the engine produced as much power as the prior 45 degree V16, and with much less complexity. The earliest engines produced featured an innovative friction wheel drive to the generator. This was soon replaced by a conventional V belt drive. Cadillac claimed that the 1938, 1939, and 1940 Series 90 Sixteen had the best performance of any production car in the world at the time and would accelerate 10-60 in high gear only in 16 seconds. The definitive engineering report on the 135 degree Cadillac V16 engine is [...] "The Evolution of the Cadillac Sixteen engine," [...] by E.W. Seaholm, in charge of Cadillac engine design. It was published by the industry journal [...] "Automotive Industries," [...] November 27, 1937.|$|E
