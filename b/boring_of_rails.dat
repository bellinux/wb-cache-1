40|$|ABSTRACT: Two pilot {{projects}} for bored tunnelling in soft soil have been {{undertaken in the}} Netherlands. The monitoring was commissioned {{under the authority of}} the Centre for Underground Construction (COB). A description of the research related to the Second Heinenoord Tunnel and the Botlek Rail Tunnel will be given. The Second Heinenoord Tunnel has completed its boring works, while the <b>boring</b> <b>of</b> the Botlek <b>Rail</b> Tunnel has started in march/April 1999. Experience from the first project is put into use {{for the development of the}} latter. Both monitoring schemes have three logical phases: predictions, measuring and evaluation. An overview of all instrumentation and a selection of the results of the Second Heinenoord tunnel are given. 1...|$|R
40|$|For {{the purpose}} of {{clarifying}} the tool wear of spur machine-bits (alloy steel, high-speed steel, and cemented carbide) in the machine <b>boring</b> <b>of</b> western redcedar (Thuja plicata Donn), tool-life tests were performed. After <b>boring</b> 1000 number <b>of</b> holes, the amount of tool wear was measured and the worn surface of spur edge of the bit was observed with a scanning electron microscope. From the results, the difference between in the machine <b>boring</b> <b>of</b> air-dried western redcedar {{and that in the}} machine <b>boring</b> <b>of</b> green one was determined. Potential difference was occurred between the bit and workpiece when green wood was bored in every tool material, the tool-wear progressions of high-speed steel bit and cemented carbide bit in the machine <b>boring</b> <b>of</b> green wood were faster than those in the machine <b>boring</b> <b>of</b> air-dried one. These results were completely contrary to the result of alloy steel bit. From the scanning electron microscope observation of each machine bit, it was observed that worn surface of the bit was corroded remarkably by chemical or electrochemical corrosive action...|$|R

40|$|Micro bore {{finishing}} for {{metal and}} ceramic materials {{has been a}} challenge in the manufacturing industry. Unfortunately, little is understood about how to polish a micro bore and how to assess its inner wall quality because {{it is difficult to}} access the micro bore for either polishing or measurement. This article reports on a feasibility study of the abrasive flow polishing <b>of</b> micro <b>bores</b> <b>of</b> 260 similar to 500 -mum diameters and 25 similar to 50 length/diameter ratios for both metal and ceramic materials. An abrasive flow polishing machine was designed and built with turbulent flow characteristics. Polishing of steel S 45 C <b>bores</b> <b>of</b> 400 - and 500 -mum diameters, stainless steel 304 <b>bores</b> <b>of</b> 500 -mum diameter, and zirconia <b>bores</b> <b>of</b> 260 -mum diameter was conducted. Surface roughness and topography of the polished inner walls <b>of</b> micro <b>bores</b> were characterized using profilometry and optical interferometry from the three-dimensional point of view. Significant reduction in surface roughness <b>of</b> the micro <b>bore</b> inner walls has been made in the polishing processes. The results indicate that it is feasible to apply the abrasive flow polishing technology for metal and ceramic micro <b>bores</b> <b>of</b> diameters of 260 mum or larger and the length/diameter ratios of 25 or higher. It is found that surface roughness of the polished micro bore inner walls decreases with an increase of the abrasive flow passes...|$|R
