5|$|Two {{types of}} {{analysis}} {{are used in}} the bioprospecting of metagenomic data: function-driven screening for an expressed trait, and sequence-driven screening for DNA sequences of interest. Function-driven analysis seeks to identify clones expressing a desired trait or useful activity, followed by biochemical characterization and sequence analysis. This approach is limited by availability of a suitable screen and the requirement that the desired trait be expressed in the host cell. Moreover, the low rate of discovery (less than one per 1,000 clones screened) and its labor-intensive nature further limit this approach. In contrast, sequence-driven analysis uses conserved DNA sequences to design PCR primers to screen clones for the sequence of interest. In comparison to cloning-based approaches, using a sequence-only approach further reduces the amount of <b>bench</b> <b>work</b> required. The application of massively parallel sequencing also greatly increases the amount of sequence data generated, which require high-throughput bioinformatic analysis pipelines. The sequence-driven approach to screening is limited by the breadth and accuracy of gene functions present in public sequence databases. In practice, experiments make use of a combination of both functional and sequence-based approaches based upon the function of interest, the complexity of the sample to be screened, and other factors.|$|E

Regardless the buildings are both historically and architecturally linked.The building's first two floor were not occupied by White's furniture company, instead they functioned as spaces for a variety of other businesses. The first floor was occupied by a pharmacy in its northeast corner while the second floor was occupied by Gordon Manufacturing Company, a manufacturer of metal oil cans.

5000|$|Nancy Pocock {{was born}} in Chicago as Anne Dorothy Meek. She was raised in both Illinois and Pennsylvania but {{by the age of}} ten has settled with her family in Toronto where she lived until her death in 1998. After graduating from Central Technical School she entered [...] "The Grange" [...] or the Ontario College of Art to pursue a career in design and {{jewellery}} making. In 1930, she studied design and <b>bench</b> <b>work</b> in Paris, and upon returning to Toronto opened a studio on Gerrard Street which she shared with potter and friend Nunzio D'Angelo. Pocock was one of the founding directors of the Metal Arts Guild of Ontario and the only one to be described as a [...] "silversmith" [...] in its letters patent. Her work was included as part of the craft component for the Canadian Pavilion in the Universal and International Exhibition in Brussels in 1958. Pocock later moved her studio to Yorkville where she worked with her husband Jack (John) Pocock until 1970. They married on 5 March 1942. Being of different religious backgrounds led the Pococks to search for a common religion to fulfil their needs. Nancy and Jack found spiritual fulfilment in the Canadian Society of Friends (the Quakers). Nancy Pocock joined the Peace Movement after Jack returned wounded from the Second World War in 1944. Pocock worked with Jack in planning the Grindstone Island programmes, a series of seminars devoted to tackling the problems of war through peaceful means. She was also {{a founding member of the}} Voice of Women and Project Ploughshares and was involved with the Canadian Peace Research Institute, the Canadian Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament and a variety of Quaker peace projects including the Canadian Friends Service Committee. She was also a Quaker representative to the Inter-Church Committee on Refugees (ICCR) and Co-ordinator of Toronto Refugee Affairs Council. Pocock committed much of her time to working with refugees during the Vietnam War by helping American draft dodgers and deserters as well as Vietnamese refugees find homes in Canada. She visited Vietnam four times, the first time during the war as a member of a Quaker committee sending aid to Vietnam. After the death of her husband in 1975, her work with refugees intensified and she expanded her scope of interest to include refugees from Latin and Central America.|$|E
