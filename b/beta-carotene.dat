40|$|The {{activity}} of natural carotenoid extracts against the autoxidative deterioration of sunflower oil-in-water emulsions was estimated {{in terms of}} primary (lipid hydroperoxides) and secondary ("off flavour" volatiles) oxidation products. At a concentration of 2 g l(- 1), the tested carotenoids did not inhibit the production of hydroperoxides but they significantly retarded the formation of volatile aldehydes during the storage of simple tween-stabilised emulsions at 30 degrees C. In another series of experiments, several carotenoid extracts (paprika. annatto and marigold preparations) containing mainly polar carotenoids, added at an active concentration of 1 g l(- 1), exerted a strong activity against hydroperoxides and TBARs during the accelerated oxidation (60 degrees C) of homogenised protein-based emulsions. On the contrary, carotene preparations rich in hydrophobic alpha- and <b>beta-carotenes</b> and lycopene did not significantly differ from the control emulsion. Therefore, the carotenoid structure modulated their antioxidant effect, while concentration and emulsion structure may also affect carotenoid activity in protein dispersed systems.

40|$|International audienceAging is {{associated}} with a progressive dysregulation of immune responses as a result of increased oxidative stress. Therefore, we have assessed the oxidative stress status of peritoneal leukocytes from young prematurely aging mice (PAM) as compared with non-prematurely aging mice (NPAM), as well as the effects on this oxidative stress of a dietary supplementation with biscuits rich in antioxidants (vitamin C, vitamin E, <b>beta-carotenes,</b> zinc and selenium). We found that, in the peritoneal leukocytes, the levels of several parameters of oxidation such as extracellular superoxide anion (O(2) (-)), Prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)), nitric oxide, oxidized glutathione (GSSG) and lipid peroxidation (malondialdehyde, MDA) were higher in PAM as compared with NPAM, whereas the antioxidant defences such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and glutathione reductase (GR) activities, as well as reduced glutathione (GSH) levels, were decreased. Consequently, young PAM showed an oxidative stress in their leukocytes, which is characteristic of mice of an older chronological age. Antioxidant diet supplementation was able to restore redox homeostasis, increasing the antioxidant and decreasing the oxidant levels. Accordingly, supplementation with adequate levels of antioxidants, from an early age, could be useful to preserve health, especially in prematurely aging populations...|$|R

40|$|Carotenes, {{and their}} oxygenated {{derivatives}} xanthophylls, are essential {{components of the}} photosynthetic apparatus. They contribute to the assembly of photosynthetic complexes and participate in light absorption and chloroplast photoprotection. Here, we studied the role of xanthophylls, as distinct from that of carotenes, by characterizing a no xanthophylls (nox) mutant of Arabidopsis thaliana, which was obtained by combining mutations targeting the four carotenoid hydroxylase genes. nox plants retained alpha- and <b>beta-carotenes</b> but were devoid in xanthophylls. The phenotype included depletion of light-harvesting complex (LHC) subunits and impairment of nonphotochemical quenching, two effects consistent with the location of xanthophylls in photosystem II antenna, but also a decreased efficiency of photosynthetic electron transfer, photosensitivity, and lethality in soil. Biochemical analysis revealed that the nox mutant was specifically depleted in photosystem I function due to a severe deficiency in PsaA/B subunits. While the stationary level of psaA/B transcripts showed no major differences between genotypes, the stability of newly synthesized PsaA/B proteins was decreased and translation of psaA/B mRNA was impaired in nox with respect to wild-type plants. We conclude that xanthophylls, besides their role in photoprotection and LHC assembly, are also needed for photosystem I core translation and stability, thus making these compounds indispensable for autotrophic growth...|$|R
40|$|Aluminum {{phosphide}} (AlP) is a cheap solid fumigant and {{a highly}} toxic pesticide which is commonly used for grain preservation. In Iran it {{is known as the}} "rice tablet". AlP has currently aroused interest with increasing number of cases in the past four decades due to increased use in agricultural and non-agricultural purposes and also its easy availability in the markets has increased its misuse to commit suicide. Upon contact with moisture in the environment, AlP undergoes a chemical reaction yielding phosphine gas, which is the active pesticidal component. Phosphine inhibits cellular oxygen utilization and can induce lipid peroxidation. It was reported that AlP has a mortality rate more than 50 % of intoxication cases. Poisoning with AlP has usually occurred in attempts to suicide. It is a more common case in adults rather than teen agers.

40|$|Promoting food {{security}} in Latin-America and the Caribbean {{is directly related}} to agricultural products. The region faces a food crisis which has reduced large population groups’ access to food. This work contributes to the study of obtaining precooked composite flour made from biofortified crops using protein, vitamin A and/or minerals. This study evaluated the effect of precooked flour’s composition and precooking on its solubility in water, water absorption capacity, consistency and viscosity; such flour was obtained by extrusion and drying on rollers. The composite flours were obtained from cassava roots, sweet potato tubers, corn, rice and bean grains and cassava leaves. Four composite flours were formulated taking four- to six-year-old children’s daily nutrient requirements (protein, iron, zinc and <b>beta-carotenes)</b> as a basis. The extruder was operated at 90 ºC, 300 rpm screw rotation speed, 17. 64 g/min feed flow, with 30 % moisture mixture. The dryer rollers were operated at 4 rpm roller rotation speed, 90 ºC surface temperature and 1 mm separation between rollers. It was determined that flour dried on rollers led to more complete cooking and modified starch granule structure than precooking by extrusion, thereby producing flour having greater solubility in water, less water absorption, higher consistency and smaller viscosity, comparable to that of pattern flour.

40|$|Type 2 Diabetes (T 2 D) {{and other}} chronic {{diseases}} {{are caused by}} a complex combination of many genetic and environmental factors. Few methods are available to comprehensively associate specific physical environmental factors with disease. We conducted a pilot Environmental-Wide Association Study (EWAS), in which epidemiological data are comprehensively and systematically interpreted in a manner analogous to a Genome Wide Association Study (GWAS). We performed multiple cross-sectional analyses associating 266 unique environmental factors with clinical status for T 2 D defined by fasting blood sugar (FBG) concentration > or = 126 mg/dL. We utilized available Centers for Disease Control (CDC) National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) cohorts from years 1999 to 2006. Within cohort sample numbers ranged from 503 to 3, 318. Logistic regression models were adjusted for age, sex, body mass index (BMI), ethnicity, and an estimate of socioeconomic status (SES). As in GWAS, multiple comparisons were controlled and significant findings were validated with other cohorts. We discovered significant associations for the pesticide-derivative heptachlor epoxide (adjusted OR in three combined cohorts of 1. 7 for a 1 SD change in exposure amount; p< 0. 001), and the vitamin gamma-tocopherol (adjusted OR 1. 5; p< 0. 001). Higher concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) such as PCB 170 (adjusted OR 2. 2; p< 0. 001) were also found. Protective factors associated with T 2 D included <b>beta-carotenes</b> (adjusted OR 0. 6; p< 0. 001). Despite difficulty in ascertaining causality, the potential for novel factors of large effect associated with T 2 D justify the use of EWAS to create hypotheses regarding the broad contribution of the environment to disease.

5|$|The {{provitamin}} A <b>beta-carotene</b> from carrots {{does not}} actually help {{people to see}} in the dark unless they suffer from a deficiency of vitamin A.

Nevertheless, the consumption of carrots was advocated in Britain at the time as part of a Dig for Victory campaign. A radio programme called The Kitchen Front encouraged people to grow, store and use carrots in various novel ways, including making carrot jam and Woolton pie, named after the Lord Woolton, the Minister for Food. The British public during WWII generally believed that eating carrots would help them see better at night and in 1942 there was a 100,000 ton surplus of carrots from the extra production.|$|E
5|$|The lichen has a {{distinct}} prothallus—fibers of whitish fungal hyphae at the edge that lack photobiont, and which project beyond the thallus onto the growing surface. The prothallus is red to whitish in the inner part, red the in outer part. The surface of the thallus {{does not have a}} well-defined cortex, an outer layer of well-packed hyphae. The medulla (a loosely arranged layer of hyphae below the cortex and photobiont zone) is whitish but the lower part is red. It has few to many calcium oxalate crystals that are 3–8μm diameter. The hyphae of the medulla have many such crystals on the walls, that are 1–2μm in diameter. The algal photobiont (technically a phycobiont, as it is a green algal photosynthetic partner) is from the genus Trentepohlia. Normally, the algae is long and filamentous; when in the lichen state, it is divided into shorter filaments. The alga has a large chloroplast that contains droplets of <b>beta-carotene.</b> The lichen is heteromerous, meaning that the mycobiont and photobiont components are in well-defined layers, with the photobiont in a more or less distinct zone between the upper cortex and the medulla. Cells are single or a few cells aggregated, with dimensions of about 8–15 by 5–11μm.|$|E
5|$|These {{harmful effects}} {{may also be}} seen in non-smokers, as a recent {{meta-analysis}} including data from approximately 230,000 patients showed that β-carotene, vitamin A or vitamin E supplementation is associated with increased mortality but saw no significant effect from vitamin C. No health risk was seen when all the randomized controlled studies were examined together, but an increase in mortality was detected when only high-quality and low-bias risk trials were examined separately. As {{the majority of these}} low-bias trials dealt with either elderly people, or people with disease, these results may not apply to the general population. This meta-analysis was later repeated and extended by the same authors, with the new analysis published by the Cochrane Collaboration; this analysis confirmed the previous results. These two publications are consistent with some previous meta-analyzes that also suggested that Vitamin E supplementation increased mortality, and that antioxidant supplements increased the risk of colon cancer. <b>Beta-carotene</b> may also increase lung cancer. Overall, the large number of clinical trials carried out on antioxidant supplements suggest that either these products have no effect on health, or that they cause a small increase in mortality in elderly or vulnerable populations.|$|E
40|$|Photosynthesis is {{the process}} by which plants and {{cyanobacteria}} convert light to chemical energy. Photosystem I and photosystem II are the two photosynthetic reaction centers that perform light-driven electron transport across thylakoid membranes. Using photon energy, photosystem I oxidizes plastocyanin, transfers the electron through a series of cofactors, and finally reduces ferredoxin. Photosystem I, consists of 12 or more proteins, 96 chlorophyll alpha molecules, 22 <b>beta-carotenes,</b> two phylloquinones, two lipid molecules, and three iron-sulfur clusters. PsaA and PsaB, the largest subunits, surround the electron transfer chain cofactors with a two-fold symmetry. These cofactors are: P 700, the primary electron donor chlorophylls, another pair of molecules of Chlalpha (A 0), two phylloquinone molecules (A 1) and the iron-sulfur cluster Fx. A 0 and A 1 are symmetrically arranged in pairs, thus forming two branches. The directionality of electrons down one or both branches has been questioned. P 700, a dimer of chlorophylls may {{play an important role in}} the determination of the electron directionality since P 700 itself exhibits asymmetry, both in structure and in interaction with the protein. This asymmetry may influence the electron spin distribution over the chlorophylls.;P 700 is a heterodimer of two chemically different chlorophyll alpha molecules. The chlorophyll molecule coordinated by PsaA is the C 13 2 epimer of chlorophyll alpha. PsaB coordinates the other half of P 700. There are five hydrogen bonds between PsaA and Chlalpha 2 ̆ 7 (some through a water molecule) that are absent on the other half of the dimer. To understand the importance of protein environment to the biophysical properties of P 700, the hydrogen bonding residues in PsaA and the homologous positions in PsaB were altered using site-directed mutagenesis of the psaA and psaB genes of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy was used to study the protein-cofactor binding interaction in P 700. The electron spin density distribution over P 700 + was determined by electron nuclear double resonance spectroscopy (ENDOR). Our results show that changes of the hydrogen bonding residues in PsaA and the respective amino acids in PsaB, has not only altered the bonding pattern between P 700 and the protein but has affected its electronic structure as well...|$|R

These inadequacies could translate to adverse outcomes during pregnancy. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine differences in dietary macro and micronutrient intake in pregnant women on OMT compared to healthy controls. Methods: Participants from a parent prospective cohort study “ENRICH” were classified into two groups: OMT users and healthy controls. Inclusion into the nutritional analysis was based on eligibility criteria of completion of food frequency questionnaire administered during hospital stay after delivery, absence of heavy drinking and adequate energy intake. Crude differences in energy, macro (carbohydrate, protein and total fat) and micronutrient (vitamin A, B 1, B 2, B 6, B 12, C, D, E, <b>beta-carotenes,</b> folate, iron and choline) intake between the study groups were compared using student’s t-test which was repeated after adjustment by total energy intake. To control for multiple comparisons MANOVA was used. Multivariate regression was used to control for confounders. Results: A total of 54 subjects (34 OMT and 20 controls) were included in the nutritional analyses. No significant effect of OMT status on energy intake was observed. It was observed that OMT group had lower energy adjusted protein intake (p= 0. 03). Analysis of the dietary micronutrient intake showed that the subjects on OMT had significantly lower Vitamin E (- 0. 9 a-TE/ 1000 Kcal/day, 95 %CI:- 1. 8, 0. 1, p= 0. 03) and folate (- 45. 9 DFE/ 1000 Kcal/day, 95 %CI:- 87. 1,- 4. 6, p= 0. 03) intake compared to controls after controlling for marital status, insurance type, age and BMI. There was a significant effect of ethnicity on energy-adjusted carbohydrate intake (p= 0. 02) and employment (p< 0. 01) on energy-adjusted protein intake after controlling covariates. It was observed that diet alone was not able to meet the requirements of several micronutrients in both the OMT and control group. Conclusion: It was observed that pregnant women on OMT had lower intake of several micronutrients compared to healthy controls which could lead to adverse pregnancy outcomes. The results of this study reinforces the requirement of micronutrient supplementation during pregnancy. Future studies should focus on investigating the effect of these differences in pregnancy outcomes and implement policies to promote healthy diet.
