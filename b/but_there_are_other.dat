5|$|Provision of {{breathing}} gas at ambient pressure can greatly prolong {{the duration of}} a dive, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>other</b> problems that may result from this technological solution. Absorption of metabolically inert gases is increased {{as a function of}} time and pressure, and these may both produce undesirable effects immediately, as a consequence of their presence in the tissues in the dissolved state, such as nitrogen narcosis and high pressure nervous syndrome, or cause problems when coming out of solution within the tissues during decompression.|$|E
5|$|There are 94 Grade I listed {{buildings}} in South Somerset. Most are Norman- or medieval-era churches, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>other</b> religious buildings as well.

It remained a farm until about 1960, and has been owned by the National Trust since 1946.|$|E

25|$|Sparkling wine is a wine (usually white) {{that becomes}} carbonated, either through {{fermentation}} or by addition of carbon dioxide.

25|$|Several major sub-continental {{drainage}} basins {{border on}} the Salween. The Mekong basin forms {{nearly the entire}} eastern boundary of the watershed, while the Irrawaddy River flows southwards {{on the west side}} of the basin. The smallest boundary is formed by the Yangtze to the extreme north.

25|$|The {{experiments}} testing gravitational lensing {{and light}} time delay limits the same post-Newtonian parameter, the so-called Eddington parameter γ, {{which is a}} straightforward parametrization {{of the amount of}} deflection of light by a gravitational source. It is equal to one for general relativity, and takes different values in other theories (such as Brans–Dicke theory). It is the best constrained of the ten post-Newtonian parameters, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>other</b> experiments designed to constrain the others. Precise observations of the perihelion shift of Mercury constrain other parameters, as do tests of the strong equivalence principle.|$|E

The creek's drainage basin is designated as a Coldwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery and wild trout naturally reproduce in a reach of it. American eels have also been released into the creek.|$|E

Bosnia-Herzegovina, for example, is the combined area of Bosnia and Herzegovina, but a fighter-bomber is an aircraft that is both a fighter and a bomber. Iterative or amredita compounds repeat a single element, to express repetition or as an emphasis. Day by day and go-go are examples {{of this type of}} compound, which has more than one head.|$|E
