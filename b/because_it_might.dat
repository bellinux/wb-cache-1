5|$|Similarly, the Catholic Church opposes {{in vitro}} {{fertilisation}} (IVF), saying that the artificial process replaces the love between a husband and wife. In addition, it opposes IVF <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> cause disposal of embryos; Catholics believe an embryo is an individual with a soul who must be treated as such. For this reason, the church also opposes abortion.|$|E
5|$|Ba {{asserted}} {{that he would}} not take orders from Americans. He also argued that sending the 13 M113 armored personnel carriers through the Cong Ba Ky Canal would enable the Viet Cong to retreat <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> take too much time. An argument broke out between Vann and Ba. Finally, Vann radioed Ziegler at the command post at Tan Hiep and told him to ask the commander of the ARVN 7th Infantry Division to order Ba to move toward Ap Bac immediately. Shortly afterwards, Ziegler returned with Dam's permission, and Ba was ordered to move his M113 carriers {{in the direction of the}} white smoke that was rising from the burning hamlet. The American advisers were quietly confident that Ba's M113s could turn the tide of battle; on previous occasions, Viet Cong fighters often fled from the battlefield as soon as M113 armored personnel carriers turned up. However, in contrast to previous engagements, Viet Cong commander Hoang had ordered the soldiers of the 261st and 514th Battalions to throw everything they had at the South Vietnamese, as retreat through the muddy rice fields would result in certain death.|$|E
25|$|There exists no theory elucidating {{correlations}} among L-amino acids.

25|$|Most {{people in}} the world reject older {{situated}} ethics and localized religious views. However small-community-based and ecology-centric views have gained some popularity in recent years. In part, this has been attributed to the desire for ethical certainties. Such a deeply rooted definition of goodness would be valuable <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> allow one to construct a good life or society by reliable processes of deduction, elaboration or prioritisation. Ones that relied only on local referents one could verify for oneself, creating more certainty and therefore less investment in protection, hedging and insuring against consequences of loss of the value.|$|E

25|$|A superstition exists among troops {{about the}} Charms candies {{that come with}} some menus: they are {{considered}} bad luck, especially if actually eaten. Some attribute this to {{a case of a}} dislike becoming a superstition (i.e. not eating them 'just in case' or <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> make one's comrades uneasy). In March 2007, The Salt Lake Tribune invited three gourmet chefs to taste-test 18 MRE meals. None of the meals rated higher than a 5.7 average on a scale of 1-to-10, and the chicken fajita meal, in particular, was singled out for disdain, rating an average score of 1.3. Early in the war in Afghanistan, among the international troops who mingle at Bagram Air Base, a single French combat ration (cassoulet, perhaps, with deer pâté and nougat) could be traded for at least five American Meals Ready to Eat.|$|E
25|$|Escrivá's {{successful}} petition of a {{title of}} nobility has aroused controversy not only <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> seem {{at odds with}} the humility befitting a Catholic priest, but also because the same title of Marquess of Peralta had been rehabilitated during 1883 by Pope Leo XIII and King Alfonso XII in favor of a man to whom Escrivá had no male-line family association: the Costa Rican diplomat Manuel María de Peralta y Alfaro (1847–1930). On that occasion, the documents ordering the rehabilitation claimed that the original title had been granted during 1738 (not 1718) to Juan Tomás de Peralta y Franco de Medina, by Charles of Austria in his capacity as Holy Roman Emperor, not as pretender to the Spanish throne. Ambassador Peralta, who during 1884 had married a Belgian countess, Jehanne de Clérembault, died without children during 1930. None of his kinsmen in Costa Rica requested the transmission of the marquessate, but one of them has published an extensive genealogical study that would seem to contradict any claim by Escrivá to the title.|$|E
25|$|The Yale Report of 1828 was a dogmatic {{defense of}} the Latin and Greek {{curriculum}} against critics who wanted more courses in modern languages, mathematics, and science. Unlike higher education in Europe, there was no national curriculum for {{colleges and universities in}} the United States. In the competition for students and financial support, college leaders strove to keep current with demands for innovation. At the same time, they realized that a significant portion of their students and prospective students demanded a classical background. The Yale report meant the classics would not be abandoned. All institutions experimented with changes in the curriculum, often resulting in a dual track. In the decentralized environment of higher education in the United States, balancing change with tradition was a common challenge because no one could afford to be completely modern or completely classical. A group of professors at Yale and New Haven Congregationalist ministers articulated a conservative response to the changes brought about by the Victorian culture. They concentrated on developing a whole man possessed of religious values sufficiently strong to resist temptations from within, yet flexible enough to adjust to the 'isms' (professionalism, materialism, individualism, and consumerism) tempting him from without. William Graham Sumner, professor from 1872 to 1909, taught in the emerging disciplines of economics and sociology to overflowing classrooms. He bested President Noah Porter, who disliked social science and wanted Yale to lock into its traditions of classical education. Porter objected to Sumner's use of a textbook by Herbert Spencer that espoused agnostic materialism <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> harm students.|$|E

500|$|Within the Pacific Ocean, {{the name}} of any {{significant}} tropical cyclone can be retired from the tropical cyclone naming lists by the World Meteorological Organization if it is felt that a storm is so deadly or damaging that the future use of its name would be inappropriate.

500|$|In 1982 El Salvador took a 20-man squad (two players {{short of}} the normal 22, as a {{controversial}} cost–saving measure), coached by the aforementioned Mauricio [...] "Pipo" [...] Rodríguez, to Spain. The team's experience was an unhappy one. In their first match on June 15 in Elche, they were defeated 10–1 by Hungary, a scoreline that stands as a World Cup record to this day. A silver lining was that Luis Baltazar Ramírez Zapata scored the country's first World Cup goal during the game, albeit at a point when the Salvadorans were already down 5–0. It was cold comfort however. When Zapata scored against Hungary, some Salvadorans cried out to Zapata not to celebrate the goal effusively <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> make the Hungarians angry {{and encourage them to}} score more.

500|$|Due to the United States' {{entry into}} World War I, some suffragists stopped their {{activism}} in 1917 <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> {{be seen as}} [...] "unpatriotic;" [...] Stevens, instead, insisted that it was [...] "arrogant of Wilson to fight for democracy abroad when women {{were not included in}} democracy at home."

The women maintained their post for over a year disregarding weather conditions and the threat of arrest. Though she performed other organizational tasks, such as organizing the North Carolina branch of the NWP in March, Stevens participated as a sentinel. She and fifteen other women were arrested for picketing at the White House on Bastille Day, in July 1917, charged with obstructing the sidewalk, and served three days of their 60-day sentence at Occoquan Workhouse before receiving a pardon from President Wilson. The women were placed within the prison population, given no toothbrushes, combs or toiletries and were surprised that they were required to share a water dipper {{with the rest of the}} prisoners.|$|E
500|$|Tom Baker found filming in Paris to {{be a very}} {{different}} experience to what he was used to in the UK where crowds would gather to watch the filming and meet the stars. Doctor Who was not shown in France at the time and so the cast and crew were largely ignored.
