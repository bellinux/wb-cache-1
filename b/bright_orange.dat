5|$|European roller chicks vomit a <b>bright</b> <b>orange,</b> foul smelling liquid {{when they}} sense danger. This repels {{prospective}} predators and may alert {{their parents to}} danger: they respond by delaying their return.|$|E
5|$|Gulf No-Nox {{gasoline}} {{was promoted}} with a bucking horse leaving an imprint of two horseshoes. Several promotions {{centered on the}} two horseshoes. In 1966 <b>bright</b> <b>orange</b> 3-D plastic self-adhesive horseshoes for car bumpers were given away. Another popular giveaway was during the 1968 election season, gold horseshoe lapel pins featuring either a Democratic donkey or a Republican elephant.|$|E
5|$|Aberdaron {{is noted}} for {{low levels of}} air pollution. The Gwynedd State of the Environment Report in 2004 found levels of sulfur dioxide, {{nitrogen}} dioxide and carbon monoxide very low, and particulates to be low. It {{is one of the}} few sites in the United Kingdom for golden hair lichen, a striking <b>bright</b> <b>orange</b> lichen that is very sensitive to air pollution. The climate is relatively mild and, because of the Gulf Stream, frosts are rare in winter.|$|E

50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 65-80 mm. Adults {{are similar to}} Delias descombesi, but have much <b>brighter</b> <b>orange</b> colouration {{on the underside of}} the male hindwings. The female underside is considerably stronger marked than in descombesi.|$|R
5|$|Flight 663 {{was unable}} to recover from its unusually steep bank and plunged into the icy water of the Atlantic Ocean, where it {{exploded}} with <b>bright</b> <b>orange</b> flames. The Pan American 707 {{was the first to}} relay news of the crash, as it was receiving permission to land. Air Canada Flight 627, which had departed a few minutes prior to Flight 663, also radioed news of an explosion in the water.|$|E
5|$|In this period, the {{ceramics}} {{showed a}} {{change with the}} entry of the highland Solano style, This ceramic tradition is most associated with the Solano site in the southeastern Valley of Guatemala and the most characteristic type is a brick-red ware covered with a <b>bright</b> <b>orange</b> micaceous slip, sometimes painted with pink or purple decoration. This style of ceramics {{has been associated with}} the highland K'iche' Maya. These new ceramics did not replace the pre-existing Ocosito complex but rather became mingled with them.|$|E
5|$|Male Scyllarus latus carry spermatophores at {{the base}} of the last two pairs of pereiopods in April. Fertilisation has not been {{observed}} in this species, but most reptant decapods mate with the ventral surfaces together. Between July and August, females carry around 100,000 eggs on their enlarged, feathery pleopods. The eggs develop from being a <b>bright</b> <b>orange</b> colour to a dark brown before being shed into the water after around 16 days of development. There is normally only one generation per year.|$|E
50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 15.5-19 mm. The forewings are <b>bright</b> ochreous <b>orange</b> with broad, dark blackish brown transverse lines. The hindwings are paler, whitish in the costal {{part and}} darker, <b>bright</b> ochreous <b>orange</b> in the anal and terminal parts.|$|R
2500|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, the golden brown was {{replaced}} by a <b>brighter</b> <b>orange</b> (RAL 2011) and the stylised IE icon replaced the IR track logo. [...] The new logo did not accompany the Intercity lettering, but was put on all MK2 and MK3 coach doors.|$|R
50|$|In the {{variegated}} fritillary's range, {{the only}} similar species is the Mexican fritillary (Euptoieta hegesia). The Mexican fritillary is <b>brighter</b> <b>orange,</b> the {{upper side of}} its hindwing basal area is unmarked, and the underside of its wings is plainer, with no submarginal spots or median black lines.|$|R
5|$|Some {{birds and}} insects use {{defensive}} regurgitation {{to ward off}} predators. The northern fulmar vomits a <b>bright</b> <b>orange,</b> oily substance called stomach oil when threatened. The stomach oil is made from their aquatic diets. It causes the predator's feathers to mat, leading {{to the loss of}} flying ability and the loss of water repellency. This is especially dangerous for aquatic birds because their water repellent feathers protect them from hypothermia when diving for food.|$|E
5|$|The carrot {{gets its}} characteristic, <b>bright</b> <b>orange</b> colour from β-carotene, and lesser amounts of α-carotene, γ-carotene, lutein and zeaxanthin. α- and β-carotenes are partly metabolized into vitamin A, {{providing}} more than 100% of the Daily Value (DV) per 100 g serving of carrots (right table). Carrots {{are also a}} good source of vitamin K (13% DV) and vitamin B6 (11% DV), but otherwise have modest content of other essential nutrients (right table).|$|E
5|$|The {{mushrooms}} of Russula brevipes often develop under {{masses of}} conifer needles or leaves of broadleaved trees, and fruit from summer to autumn. Forms of the mushroom that develop a bluish band {{at the top}} of the stipe are sometimes referred to as variety acrior. Although edible, Russula brevipes mushrooms have a bland or bitter flavor. They become more palatable once parasitized by the ascomycete fungus Hypomyces lactifluorum, a <b>bright</b> <b>orange</b> mold that covers the fruit body and transforms them into lobster mushrooms.|$|E

50|$|The rainbow darter spawns in clean, rocky riffles from March through June. It has a {{lifespan}} {{of about}} 4 years. The males can {{grow up to}} 48 mm long, while the largest female reaches just under 43 mm. The male form is resplendent in <b>bright</b> <b>oranges</b> and iridescent blue spots, stripes, and checks.|$|R
5|$|The {{wings of}} dragonflies are {{generally}} clear, {{apart from the}} dark veins and pterostigmata. In the chasers (Libellulidae), however, many genera have areas of colour on the wings: for example, groundlings (Brachythemis) have brown bands on all four wings, while some scarlets (Crocothemis) and dropwings (Trithemis) have <b>bright</b> <b>orange</b> patches at the wing bases. Some aeshnids such as the brown hawker (Aeshna grandis) have translucent, pale yellow wings.|$|E
5|$|Cyptotrama asprata (alternatively spelled aspratum), {{commonly}} known as the golden-scruffy collybia, is a saprobic species of mushroom in the family Physalacriaceae. Widely distributed in tropical regions of the world, it is characterized by the <b>bright</b> <b>orange</b> to yellow cap that in young specimens is covered with tufts of fibrils resembling small spikes. This fungus has had a varied taxonomical history, having been placed in fourteen genera before finally settling in Cyptotrama. This species is differentiated from several other similar members of genus Cyptotrama by variations in cap color, and spore size and shape.|$|E
5|$|Gills are adnate with a decurrent tooth (where {{the gills}} curve up {{to join the}} stipe but then, close to the stipe, the margin turns down again), and {{initially}} narrow but broaden when old. They are pallid to grayish-olive with <b>bright</b> <b>orange</b> edges. Smith noted that the edge color may spread to the gill faces in some specimens, because the pigment, rather than being encrusted {{on the walls of}} the cystidia, is found in the cytosol and therefore more readily diffusible. The gills are spaced close together, with between 16 and 26 gills reaching the stipe, and there are up to three tiers of interspersed lamellulae (short gills that do not extend fully from the cap edge to the stipe).|$|E

5|$|Kyle {{is usually}} {{depicted}} wearing winter attire {{which consists of}} a bright green ushanka, a <b>bright</b> <b>orange</b> jacket, dark green pants, and lime-green mittens/gloves. The rare instances {{in which he is}} shown without his cap, he has a bright red-to-auburn Jewfro. His hat and hairstyle were influenced by those of James Humphrey, a character whom Matt Stone portrayed in the 1993 film Cannibal! The Musical. While he originally voiced Kyle without computer manipulation, Stone now does so by speaking within his normal vocal range and then adding a childlike inflection. The recorded audio is edited with Pro Tools, and the pitch altered to make the voice sound more like that of a fourth grader.|$|E
5|$|According to Alexander H. Smith's {{organization}} of the genus Mycena, M.aurantiomarginata is classified in section Calodontes, subsection Granulatae, which contains species with roughened cheilocystidia (cystidia on gill edges), such as M.rosella, M.flavescens, M.elegans, and M.strobilinoides. In his 1992 study of Mycena, Dutch mycologist Rudolph Arnold Maas Geesteranus put M.aurantiomarginata in the section Luculentae, characterized by species with an olive to yellowish-olive and moist cap, pallid to gray-olive gills with <b>bright</b> <b>orange</b> margins, brownish to grayish-olive stipes, white spore deposit, and spiny cystidia. M.aurantiomarginata was included in a 2010 molecular analysis focused on clarifying the phylogenetic relationships between Northern European species in the section Calodontes. The results suggested that, based on the similarity of nuclear large subunit ribosomal DNA sequences, the fungus {{is closely related to}} M.crocata and M.leaiana. This conclusion was previously corroborated by research that used molecular analysis to demonstrate that several Mycena species can be mycorrhizal partners of the orchid Gastrodia confusa.|$|E
5|$|The {{characteristic}} <b>bright</b> <b>orange</b> bill {{plates and}} other facial characteristics {{develop in the}} spring. At {{the close of the}} breeding season, these special coatings and appendages are shed in a partial moult. This makes the beak appear less broad, the tip less bright and the base darker grey. The eye ornaments are shed and the eyes appear round. At the same time, the feathers {{of the head and neck}} are replaced and the face becomes darker. This winter plumage is seldom seen by humans because when they have left their chicks, the birds head out to sea and do not return to land until the next breeding season. The juvenile bird is similar to the adult in plumage but altogether duller with a much darker grey face and yellowish-brown beak tip and legs. After fledging, it will make its way to the water and will head out to sea and not return to land for several years. In the interim, each year it will have a broader bill, paler face patches and brighter legs and beak.|$|E
50|$|It was {{not until}} after her ban by {{authorities}} had been lifted in 1957 that Aiki's work become more popular, as her ouvre had changed from somewhat bleak paintings in funereal tones to vivid, bold colored, heavily textured paintings that often incorporated images of fantasy and whimsy; Aiki's work from the early 1960s onward would often include <b>bright</b> <b>oranges,</b> greens and purples.|$|R
5000|$|The {{orange-cheeked waxbill}} lives in small family parties or flocks of thirty of more individuals. Their high-pitched peeps {{are the best}} clue of their presence. Like most estridids, they are very acrobatic in their {{movements}} on twigs and grass stems, [...] "climbing" [...] up and down verticals and hanging upside down while feeding. Males usually have <b>brighter</b> <b>orange</b> patches on the abdomen.|$|R

5|$|Carrot soup can be {{prepared}} as a cream-style soup and as a broth-style soup. Vegetable stock or chicken stock {{can be used as}} ingredients in both styles of soup. Other vegetables may be used in the dish, including root vegetables, the latter of which may include garlic onion, shallot, potato, turnip and others. Carrot juice and orange juice can be used in its preparation, and some versions are prepared using puréed carrot. After cooking, the dish can be run through a sieve to strain it. The carrots used can be peeled or unpeeled, and the use of peeled carrots can lend to increased smoothness in puréed versions of the dish. Those prepared with puréed carrot may have a thick consistency while also being smooth in texture. The soup's color can vary based upon the coloration of the carrots used. Young carrots tend to make the soup sweeter and imbue it with a <b>bright</b> <b>orange</b> coloration, while older, larger carrots provide less sweetness and may imbue a yellow coloration. The use of old, cracked carrots that have a woody texture in their interior can produce a soup of inferior quality.|$|E
