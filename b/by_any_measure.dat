500|$|Reception of Marvel Trading Card Game {{across all}} three {{platforms}} was mixed. [...] The game {{was compared to}} other collectible card games such as Pokémon, Magic, and Munchkin. [...] Reviewers were pleased with the game's representation of the VS System rules, but {{felt that it was}} less accessible to players who weren't familiar with the physical version. [...] Several reviews referred to the gameplay as addictive; IGN's Hilary Goldstein said [...] "I have to admit, I am somewhat addicted to the Marvel Trading Card Game. It's not a great game <b>by</b> <b>any</b> <b>measure,</b> but it does an excellent job of tapping into the collector's mentality of comic-book fans." ...|$|E
500|$|Just {{before the}} vote the Ames, McCotter {{addressed}} voters in what Politico described as [...] "a slow, abstract, exceptionally sober speech". It drew little crowd reaction other than applause at the denunciation of the [...] "regime in Beijing" [...] and the proclamation, [...] "I will not cede the 21st Century to a Communist, nuclear-armed dictatorship." [...] At his tent, McCotter spent {{a large amount of}} time playing guitar.

500|$|The episode {{received}} generally mixed-to-positive reviews. Ryan McGee of Zap2it {{wrote that}} [...] "this episode wasn't a stinker <b>by</b> <b>any</b> <b>measure,</b> {{but after the}} run of early episodes, {{this is the first}} that really didn't hold its own when compared to the others", adding that [...] "The moth imagery/metaphor just beats you down by episode's end, making you long for the more subtle writing the show has produced up until this point." [...] The TV Critic gave the episode a 68/100, writing that it falls between being [...] "obvious and cheesy" [...] and [...] "beautifully paced and structured". Myles McNutt of The A.V. Club gave the episode a B, and shared his opinion that it is [...] "one of the more intensely metaphorical—and thus writerly—episodes of the series. The eponymous metaphor—delivered by Locke—is one of the series’ most blatant, and the moth’s consistent reappearance in the episode calls {{a lot of attention to}} the construction of the narrative." ...|$|E

500|$|Around {{this same}} time, the thirty-two year-old Phips {{had made his}} way to England, where he gained an {{audience}} with Narborough and Charles II. [...] <b>By</b> <b>any</b> <b>measure,</b> this was a remarkable achievement for a poor New Englander like Phips, but it also seems clear that he must have been at {{the right place at the}} right time. His reputation for finding sunken ships may have preceded him, and he seems to have had demonstrable gains to show, as one letter writer mentions his 'late successful returns.' Perhaps he delivered the King's portion of these returns to Whitehall in person? [...] In any case, a reckless plan was concocted, probably by Narborough, whereby this New England native, despite having no background in the English navy, would be assigned as the commander of a 20-gun frigate, HMS Rose of Algiers for a treasure hunt, but given no other financial backing. He and his crew would be required to pay for all other expenses of the voyage, including food and diving equipment, and give a deposit of £100. Of the treasure they found, 35% would go to the King, and the rest would be divided among the otherwise unpaid crew.|$|E

Georgia had won nine of the {{previous}} ten games in the series, and Florida coach Bob Woodruff was 0–2 against his arch-rivals.|$|E
2500|$|The Orthodox {{reject the}} idea that Christ died to give God [...] "satisfaction", as taught by Anselm, or as a punitive {{substitute}} as taught by the Reformers.

40|$|We {{show that}} the Bloch vectors lying on any great circle is the largest set S(L) for which the {{parallel}} states |n, n> can always be exactly transformed into the anti-parallel states |n, -n>. Thus {{more information about the}} direction of the Bloch vector "n" is not extractable from |n, -n> than from |n, n> <b>by</b> <b>any</b> <b>measuring</b> strategy, for "n" belonging to S(L). Surprisingly, the largest set of Bloch vectors for which the corresponding qubits can be flipped is again S(L). We then show that probabilistic exact parallel to anti-parallel transformation is not possible if the corresponding anti-parallels span the whole Hilbert space of the two qubits. These considerations allow us to generalize a conjecture of Gisin and Popescu (Phys. Rev. Lett. 83, 432 (1999)) ...|$|R

2500|$|When {{an adult}} child loses a parent in later adulthood, it is {{considered}} to be [...] "timely" [...] and to be a normative life course event. This allows the adult children to feel a permitted level of grief. However, research shows that the death of a parent in an adult's midlife is not a normative event <b>by</b> <b>any</b> <b>measure,</b> but is a major life transition causing an evaluation of one's own life or mortality. Others may shut out friends and family in processing the loss of someone with whom they have had the longest relationship.|$|E
2500|$|While it was {{customary}} for Buddhist {{works to}} be written in Chinese, Dōgen often wrote in Japanese, conveying the essence of his thought in a style that was at once concise, compelling, and inspiring. A master stylist, Dōgen is noted not only for his prose, but also for his poetry (in Japanese waka style and various Chinese styles). Dōgen's use of language is unconventional <b>by</b> <b>any</b> <b>measure.</b> According to Dōgen scholar Steven Heine: [...] "Dogen's poetic and philosophical works are characterized by a continual effort to express the inexpressible by perfecting imperfectable speech through the creative use of wordplay, neologism, and lyricism, {{as well as the}} recasting of traditional expressions".|$|E

2500|$|May {{says that}} Oxford's poetry was [...] "one man's {{contribution}} to the rhetorical mainstream of an evolving Elizabethan poetic" [...] indistinguishable from [...] "the output of his mediocre mid-century contemporaries".

[...] Nelson says that [...] "contemporary observers such as Harvey, Webbe, Puttenham, and Meres clearly exaggerated De Vere's talent in deference to his rank. <b>By</b> <b>any</b> <b>measure,</b> his poems pale in comparison with those of Sidney, Lyly, Spenser, Shakespeare, Donne, and Jonson."

2500|$|The {{languages}} {{assigned to}} the Eastern Algonquian group are hypothesized to descend from an intermediate common ancestor proto-language, referred to as Proto-Eastern Algonquian (PEA). By virtue of their common ancestry the Eastern Algonquian languages constitute a genetic subgroup, and the individual Eastern Algonquian languages descend from PEA. By contrast, other Algonquian languages are hypothesized to descend directly from Proto-Algonquian, the ultimate common language ancestor of the Algonquian languages. In historical linguistics in general, the primary criterion for status as a genetic subgroup {{is that there are}} shared innovations {{assigned to the}} proposed subgroup that cannot be assigned to the ultimate ancestor language. A complex series of phonological and morphological innovations define Eastern Algonquian as a subgroup. [...] "There is less diversity, <b>by</b> <b>any</b> <b>measure,</b> among [...] as a group than among the Algonquian languages as a whole or among the non-Eastern languages." ...|$|E

40|$|Social {{status in}} {{randomly}} constituted groups of male CFLP mice was predictable from early suckling behaviour {{and rate of}} weight gain in natal litters. High-ranking males were those that had suckled on more anterior teats and gained weight more quickly.

Aggressive social relationships within natal litters did not predict polarized rank relationships in randomized groups. Nevertheless, while still in their natal litters, {{and in the absence of}} aggressive rank relationships, eventual rank categories showed the same difference in modulation of testosterone concentration in relation to current immunocompetence (low-rankers modulating, high-rankers not), as has repeatedly been found in randomized groups by earlier studies.
