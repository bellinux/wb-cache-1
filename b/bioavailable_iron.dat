40|$|Atmospheric inputs of iron to {{the open}} ocean are {{hypothesized}} to modulate ocean biogeochemistry. This review presents an integration of available observations of atmospheric iron and iron deposition, and also covers <b>bioavailable</b> <b>iron</b> distributions. Methods for estimating temporal variability in ocean deposition over the recent past are reviewed. Desert dust iron is estimated to represent 95 % of the global atmospheric iron cycle, and combustion sources of iron {{are responsible for the}} remaining 5 %. Humans may be significantly perturbing desert dust (up to 50 %). The sources of <b>bioavailable</b> <b>iron</b> are less well understood than those of iron, partly because {{we do not know what}} speciation of the iron is bioavailable. <b>Bioavailable</b> <b>iron</b> can derive from atmospheric processing of relatively insoluble desert dust iron or from direct emissions of soluble iron from combustion sources. These results imply that humans could be substantially impacting iron and <b>bioavailable</b> <b>iron</b> deposition to ocean regions, but there are large uncertainties in our understanding...|$|E

Improving the nutritional quality of staple food crops such as maize, by developing varieties with high <b>bioavailable</b> <b>iron</b> represents a sustainable and cost effective approach to alleviating iron malnutrition. The aim of our study was to use a Caco- 2 cell / quantitative trait loci (QTL) / and poultry approach to discover the genes that influence maize grain iron concentration and amount of <b>bioavailable</b> <b>iron.</b> After several breeding cycles guided by measurements of iron bioavailability with the Caco- 2 cell model, we identified two maize lines with identical grain iron concentration (20 [mu]g/g), but one line contained double the amount of <b>bioavailable</b> <b>iron</b> (p [LESS THAN] 0. 001). Three QTL were found to influence the bioavailability of iron in the two maize lines. Measurement of iron status in a poultry model confirmed {{the results of the}} Caco- 2 cell model. Some of the lines screened using the Caco- 2 cell / QTL / and poultry approach have been grown at multiple locations and data show a strong genotype x environment (GxE) interaction.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the effect of dissolved organic ligands, such as EDTA, humic acids, hydrophobic and hydrophilic fractions of dissolved organic matter (DOM), on the growth of Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata in cultured media and natural lake waters. The growth of algae was gradually increased on the addition of dissolved organic ligands, but markedly declined at high concentrations, due to reduced <b>bioavailable</b> <b>iron</b> concentrations (e. g., Fe 3 + and Fe'-inorganic ferric iron). The results demonstrated that the high growth rates of P. subcapitata were correlated with the hydrophobic, but not hydrophilic, DOM from five lakes, spiked under the nutrients-controlled conditions. This was attributed to the role of DOM in controlling the <b>bioavailable</b> <b>iron</b> due to complexation of Fe(III) with -COOH and -OH functional groups on the hydrophobic DOM. Therefore, the hydrophobic DOM, as chelating agent, is a biologically important component in the lake waters, which affects the algal growth by interacting with <b>bioavailable</b> <b>iron</b> in the lake water and can change the results of bioassay experiments.

40|$|Iron {{and vitamin}} A {{deficiencies}} in childhood are public health {{problems in the}} developing world. Introduction of cereal-based complementary foods, that are often poor sources of both vitamin A and <b>bioavailable</b> <b>iron,</b> {{increases the risk of}} deficiency in young children. Alternative foods with higher levels of vitamin A and <b>bioavailable</b> <b>iron</b> could help alleviate these micronutrient deficiencies. The objective {{of this study was to}} compare iron bioavailability of β-carotene-rich sweet potato-based complementary foods (orange-flesh based sweet potato (OFSP) ComFa and cream-flesh sweet potato based (CFSP) ComFa with a household cereal-based complementary food (Weanimix) and a commercial cereal (Cerelac®), using the in vitro digestion/Caco- 2 cell model. Iron bioavailability relative to total iron, concentrations of iron-uptake inhibitors (fibre, phytates, and polyphenols), and enhancers (ascorbic acid, ß-carotene and fructose) was also evaluated. All foods contained similar amounts of iron, but bioavailability varied: Cerelac® had the highest, followed by OFSP ComFa and Weanimix, which had equivalent bioavailable iron; CFSP ComFa had the lowest bioavailability. The high iron bioavailability from Cerelac® was associated with the highest levels of ascorbic acid, and the lowest levels of inhibitors; polyphenols appeared to limit sweet potato-based food iron bioavailability. Taken together, the results do not support that CFSP- and OFSP ComFa are better sources of <b>bioavailable</b> <b>iron</b> compared with non-commercial/household cereal-based weaning foods; however, they may be a good source of provitamin A in the form of β-carotene...|$|E
40|$|Biofortification is a {{strategy}} for combating iron deficiency that involves the selective breeding of food crops to increase total <b>bioavailable</b> <b>iron.</b> Evidence that ferritin is {{a good source of}} <b>bioavailable</b> <b>iron</b> has created interest for increasing ferritin concentrations in seeds. However the successful implementation of ferritin biofortification requires a method to rapidly measure ferritin in staple food crops. In this study, we developed an indirect ELISA to quantify ferritin in red beans, white beans, wheat, maize, and brown rice. This required the production of an anti-ferritin antibody that is immunoreactive with all seed ferritins, the development of a rapid method for the crude extraction of ferritin from the seeds, and the use of immunoblotting techniques to verify immunoreactivity of the antibodies.

40|$|High phytate {{content in}} staple food crops {{is a major}} barrier to {{successful}} iron biofortification. We have exploited the low phytic acid 1 - 1 (lpa 1 - 1) mutant of maize to generate transgenic plants with up-to 70 μg/g seed iron through the endosperm-specific overexpression of soybean ferritin, resulting in more than 2 -fold improvement in iron bioavailability. The levels of <b>bioavailable</b> seed <b>iron</b> achieved in this study greatly exceed any achieved thus far and closely approach values estimated to have a nutritional impact on target populations. Gene expression studies reveal a large induction of the YS 1 transporter in leaves and severe repression of an iron acquisition gene DMAS 1 in roots, suggesting significant alterations in the iron homeostatic mechanisms in transgenic lpa 1 - 1.

40|$|Modeling {{and remote}} sensing {{techniques}} {{were applied to}} examine the horizontal and vertical transport pathways of Patagonian dust and quantify the effect of soluble-iron- laden mineral dust deposition on marine primary productivity in the South Atlantic Ocean (SAO) surface waters. The global chemistry transport model GEOS-Chem, implemented with an iron dissolution scheme, was applied to evaluate the atmospheric transport and deposition of mineral dust and <b>bioavailable</b> <b>iron</b> during two dust outbreaks originating in the source regions of Patagonia. In addition to this "rapidly released" iron, offline calculations were also carried out to estimate the amount of <b>bioavailable</b> <b>iron</b> leached during the residence time of dust in the ocean mixed layer. Model simulations showed that the horizontal and vertical transport pathways of Patagonian dust plumes were largely influenced by the synoptic meteorological patterns {{of high and low}} pressure systems. Model-predicted horizontal and vertical transport pathways of Patagonian dust over the SAO were in reasonable agreement with remotely-sensed data. Comparison between remotely-sensed and offline calculated ocean surface chlorophyll-a concentrations indicated that, for the two dust outbreaks examined in this study, the deposition of <b>bioavailable</b> <b>iron</b> in the SAO through atmospheric pathways was insignificant. As the two dust transport episodes examined here represent typical outflows of mineral dust from South American sources, our study suggests that the atmospheric deposition of mineral dust is unlikely to induce large scale marine primary productivity and carbon sequestration in the South Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean...|$|E
40|$|The Southern Ocean {{is a major}} sink for {{anthropogenic}} carbon. Yet, {{there is}} no quantitative consensus about how this sink will change when surface winds increase (as they are anticipated to do). Among the tools employed to quantify carbon uptake are global coupled ocean-circulation–biogeochemical models. Because of computational limitations these models still fail to resolve potentially important spatial scales. Instead, processes on these scales are parameterized. There is concern that deficiencies in these so-called eddy parameterizations might imprint incorrect sensitivities of projected oceanic carbon uptake. Here, we compare natural carbon uptake in the Southern Ocean simulated with contemporary eddy parameterizations. We find that very differing parameterizations yield surprisingly similar oceanic carbon in response to strengthening winds. In contrast, we find (in an additional simulation) that the carbon uptake does differ substantially when the supply of <b>bioavailable</b> <b>iron</b> is altered within its envelope of uncertainty. We conclude that a more comprehensive understanding of <b>bioavailable</b> <b>iron</b> dynamics will substantially reduce the uncertainty of model-based projections of oceanic carbon uptake...|$|E
40|$|Iron {{dissolution}} from mineral dusts {{and soil}} particles is vital {{as a source}} of <b>bioavailable</b> <b>iron</b> in various environmental media. In this work, the dissolution of iron oxide particles trapped in ice was investigated as a new pathway of iron supply. The dissolution experiments were carried out in the absence and presence of various organic complexing ligands under dark condition. In acidic pH conditions (pH 2, 3, and 4), the dissolution of iron oxides was greatly enhanced in the ice phase compared to that in water. The dissolved iron was mainly in the ferric form, which indicates that the dissolution is not a reductive process. The extent of dissolved iron was greatly affected by the kind of organic complexing ligands and the surface area of iron oxides. The iron dissolution was most pronounced with high surface area iron oxides and in the presence of strong iron binding ligands. The enhanced dissolution of iron oxides in ice is mainly ascribed to the "freeze concentration effect", which concentrates iron oxide particles, organic ligands, and protons in the liquid like ice grain boundary region and accelerates the dissolution of iron oxides. The ice-enhanced dissolution effect gradually decreased when decreasing the freezing temperature from &minus; 10 to &minus; 196 °C, which implies that the presence and formation of the liquid-like ice grain boundary region play a critical role. The proposed phenomenon of enhanced dissolution of iron oxides in ice may provide a new pathway of <b>bioavailable</b> <b>iron</b> production. The frozen atmospheric ice with iron-containing dust particles in the upper atmosphere thaws upon descending and may provide <b>bioavailable</b> <b>iron</b> upon deposition onto the ocean surface...|$|E

40|$|Magnetotactic {{bacteria}} intracellularly biomineralize magnetite of {{an ideal}} grain size for recording palaeomagnetic signals. However, bacterial magnetite has only been reported in a few pre-Quaternary records because progressive burial into anoxic diagenetic environments causes its dissolution. Deep-sea carbonate sequences provide optimal environments for preserving bacterial magnetite due to low rates of organic carbon burial and expanded pore-water redox zonations. Such sequences often do not become anoxic for tens to hundreds of metres below the seafloor. Nevertheless, the biogeochemical factors that control magnetotactic bacterial populations in such settings are not well known. We document the preservation of bacterial magnetite, which dominates the palaeomagnetic signal throughout Eocene pelagic carbonates from the southern Kerguelen Plateau, Southern Ocean. We provide evidence that iron fertilization, associated with increased aeolian dust flux, resulted in surface water eutrophication in the late Eocene that controlled bacterial magnetite abundance via export of organic carbon to the seafloor. Increased flux of aeolian ironbearing phases also delivered iron to the seafloor, some of which became <b>bioavailable</b> through <b>iron</b> reduction. Our results suggest that magnetotactic bacterial populations in pelagic settings depend crucially on particulate iron and organic carbon delivery to the seafloor...|$|R
40|$|Previous studies {{demonstrated}} {{growth of}} Anaeromyxobacter dehalogenans strain 2 CP-C with acetate or hydrogen as the electron donor and Fe(III), nitrate, nitrite, fumarate, oxygen, or ortho-substituted halophenols as electron acceptors. In this study, we explored and characterized U(VI) reduction by strain 2 CP-C. Cell suspensions of fumarate-grown 2 CP-C cells reduced U(VI) to U(IV). More-detailed growth studies demonstrated that hydrogen was the required electron donor for U(VI) reduction {{and could not}} be replaced by acetate. The addition of nitrate to U(VI) -reducing cultures resulted in a transitory increase in U(VI) concentration, apparently caused by the reoxidation of reduced U(IV), but U(VI) reduction resumed following the consumption of N-oxyanions. Inhibition of U(VI) reduction occurred in cultures amended with Fe(III) citrate, or citrate. In the presence of amorphous Fe(III) oxide, U(VI) reduction proceeded to completion but the U(VI) reduction rates decreased threefold compared to control cultures. Fumarate and 2 -chlorophenol had no inhibitory effects on U(VI) reduction, and both electron acceptors were consumed concomitantly with U(VI). Since cocontaminants (e. g., nitrate, halogenated compounds) and <b>bioavailable</b> ferric <b>iron</b> are often encountered at uranium-impacted sites, the metabolic versatility makes Anaeromyxobacter dehalogenans a promising model organism for studying the complex interaction of multiple electron acceptors in U(VI) reduction and immobilization...|$|R

40|$|The {{supply of}} <b>bioavailable</b> <b>iron</b> to the high-nitrate low-chlorophyll (HNLC) {{waters of the}} Southern Ocean through {{atmospheric}} pathways could stimulate phytoplankton blooms and have major implications for the global carbon cycle. In this study, model results and remotely-sensed data are analyzed to examine the horizontal and vertical transport pathways of Patagonian dust and quantify the effect of iron-laden mineral dust deposition on marine biological productivity in the surface waters of the South Atlantic Ocean (SAO). Model simulations for the atmospheric transport and deposition of mineral dust and <b>bioavailable</b> <b>iron</b> are carried out for two large dust outbreaks originated at the source regions of northern Patagonia during the austral summer of 2009. Model-simulated horizontal and vertical transport pathways of Patagonian dust plumes are in reasonable agreement with remotely-sensed data. Simulations indicate that the synoptic meteorological patterns {{of high and low}} pressure systems are largely accountable for dust transport trajectories over the SAO. According to model results and retrievals from the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO), synoptic flows caused by opposing pressure systems (a high pressure system located to the east or north-east of a low pressure system) elevate the South American dust plumes well above the marine boundary layer. Under such conditions, the bulk concentration of mineral dust can quickly be transported around the low pressure system in a clockwise manner, follow the southeasterly advection pathway, and reach the HNLC waters of the SAO and Antarctica in ~ 3 – 4 days after emission from the source regions of northern Patagonia. Two different mechanisms for dust-iron mobilization into a bioavailable form are considered in this study. A global 3 -D chemical transport model (GEOS-Chem), implemented with an iron dissolution scheme, is employed to estimate the atmospheric fluxes of soluble iron, while a dust/biota assessment tool (Boyd et al., 2010) is applied to evaluate the amount of <b>bioavailable</b> <b>iron</b> formed through the slow and sustained leaching of dust in the ocean mixed layer. The effect of iron-laden mineral dust supply on surface ocean biomass is investigated by comparing predicted surface chlorophyll- a concentration ([Chl- a]) to remotely-sensed data. As the dust transport episodes examined here represent large summertime outflows of mineral dust from South American continental sources, this study suggests that (1) atmospheric fluxes of mineral dust from Patagonia {{are not likely to be}} the major source of <b>bioavailable</b> <b>iron</b> to ocean regions characterized by high primary productivity; (2) even if Patagonian dust plumes may not cause visible algae blooms, they could still influence background [Chl- a] in the South Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean...|$|E

Hunter et al., mBio 4 (4) :e 00557 - 13, 2013; N. N. Kreamer, J. C. Wilks, J. J. Marlow, M. L. Coleman, and D. K. Newman, J Bacteriol 194 : 1195 – 1204, 2012]. Here, we show that an RExxE motif in BqsS is required for BqsRS activation. Once Fe(II) is sensed, BqsR binds a tandem repeat DNA sequence, activating transcription. The BqsR regulon—defined through iterative bioinformatic predictions and experimental validation—includes several genes whose products are known to drive antibiotic resistance to aminoglycosides and polymyxins. Among them are genes encoding predicted determinants of polyamine transport and biosynthesis. Compared to the wild type, bqsS and bqsR deletion mutants are sensitive to high levels of Fe(II), produce less spermidine in high Fe(II), and are more sensitive to tobramycin and polymyxin B but not arsenate, chromate, or cefsulodin. BqsRS thus mediates a physiological response to Fe(II) that guards the cell against positively charged molecules but not negatively charged stressors. These results suggest Fe(II) is an important environmental signal that, via BqsRS, bolsters tolerance of a variety of cationic stressors, including clinically important antimicrobial agents...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Iron is an {{important}} micronutrient for all living organisms. Almost 25 % of the world population is affected by iron deficiency, {{a leading cause of}} anemia. In plants, iron deficiency leads to chlorosis and reduced yield. Both animals and plants may suffer from iron deficiency when their diet or environment lacks <b>bioavailable</b> <b>iron.</b> A sustainable way to reduce iron malnutrition in humans is to develop staple crops with increased content of <b>bioavailable</b> <b>iron.</b> Knowledge of where and how iron accumulates in seeds of crop plants will increase the understanding of plant iron metabolism and will assist in the production of staples with increased <b>bioavailable</b> <b>iron.</b> Results Here we reveal the distribution of iron in seeds of three Phaseolus species including thirteen genotypes of P. vulgaris, P. coccineus, and P. lunatus. We showed that high concentrations of iron accumulate in cells surrounding the provascular tissue of P. vulgaris and P. coccineus seeds. Using the Perls' Prussian blue method, we were able to detect iron in the cytoplasm of epidermal cells, cells near the epidermis, and cells surrounding the provascular tissue. In contrast, the protein ferritin that has been suggested as the major iron storage protein in legumes was only detected in the amyloplasts of the seed embryo. Using the non-destructive micro-PIXE (Particle Induced X-ray Emission) technique we show that the tissue in the proximity of the provascular bundles holds up to 500 μg g - 1 of iron, depending on the genotype. In contrast to P. vulgaris and P. coccineus, we did not observe iron accumulation in the cells surrounding the provascular tissues of P. lunatus cotyledons. A novel iron-rich genotype, NUA 35, with a high concentration of iron both in the seed coat and cotyledons was bred from a cross between an Andean and a Mesoamerican genotype. Conclusions The presented results emphasize the importance of complementing research in model organisms with analysis in crop plants and they suggest that iron distribution criteria should be integrated into selection strategies for bean biofortification. </p...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Low iron intake {{can lead}} to iron deficiency, which can result in {{impaired}} health and iron-deficiency anemia. A mobile phone app, combining successful dietary strategies to increase <b>bioavailable</b> <b>iron</b> with strategies for behavior change, such as goal setting, monitoring, feedback, and resources for knowledge acquisition, was developed with the aim to increase <b>bioavailable</b> <b>iron</b> intake in premenopausal women. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the content, usability, and acceptability of a mobile phone app designed to improve intake of bioavailable dietary iron. METHODS: Women aged 18 - 50 years with an Android mobile phone were invited to participate. Over a 2 -week period women were asked {{to interact with the}} app. Following this period, semistructured focus groups with participants were conducted. Focus groups were audio recorded and analyzed via an inductive open-coding method using the qualitative analysis software NVivo 10. Themes were identified and frequency of code occurrence was calculated. RESULTS: Four focus groups (n= 26) were conducted (age range 19 - 36 years, mean 24. 7, SD 5. 2). Two themes about the app 2 ̆ 7 s functionality were identified (frequency of occurrence in brackets) : interface and design (134) and usability (86). Four themes about the app 2 ̆ 7 s components were identified: goal tracker (121), facts (78), photo diary (40), and games (46). A number of suggestions to improve the interface and design of the app were provided and will inform the ongoing development of the app. CONCLUSIONS: This research indicates that participants are interested in iron and their health and are willing to use an app utilizing behavior change strategies to increase intake of <b>bioavailable</b> <b>iron.</b> The inclusion of information about the link between diet and health, monitoring and tracking of the achievement of dietary goals, and weekly reviews of goals were also seen as valuable components of the app and should be considered in mobile health apps aimed at adult women...|$|E

40|$|Runoff from glaciers and ice sheets {{has been}} {{acknowledged}} {{as a potential}} source of bioavailable dissolved organic matter (DOM) to downstream ecosystems. This source may become increasingly significant as glacial melt rates increase in response to future climate change. Recent work has identified significant concentrations of <b>bioavailable</b> carbon and <b>iron</b> in Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) runoff. The flux characteristics and export of N-rich DOM are poorly understood. Here, we employed electrospray ionization (ESI) coupled to Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS) to determine the elemental compositions of DOM molecules in supraglacial water and subglacial runoff from a large GrIS outlet glacier. We provide the first detailed temporal analysis of the molecular composition of DOM exported over a full melt season. We find that DOM pools in supraglacial and subglacial runoff are compositionally diverse and that N-rich material is continuously exported throughout the melt season as the snowline retreats further inland. Identification of protein-like compounds and {{a high proportion of}} N-rich DOM, accounting for 27 - 41 % of the DOM molecules identified by ESI FT-ICR MS, may suggest a microbial provenance and high bioavailability of glacially-exported DOM to downstream microbial communities...|$|R
40|$|Seasonings and {{condiments}} can be candidate {{vehicles for}} micronutrient fortification if consumed consistently and if dietary practices ensure bioavailability of the nutrient. In this review, we identify {{factors that may}} affect the bioavailability of iron, vitamin A, zinc, and folic acid when added to seasonings and condiments and evaluate their effects on micronutrient status. We {{take into consideration the}} chemical and physical properties of different forms of the micronutrients, the influence of the physical and chemical properties of foods and meals to which fortified seasonings and condiments are typically added, and interactions between micronutrients and the physiological and nutritional status of the target population. <b>Bioavailable</b> fortificants of <b>iron</b> have been developed for use in dry or fluid vehicles. For example, sodium iron ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (NaFeEDTA) and ferrous sulfate with citric acid are options for iron fortification of fish and soy sauce. Furthermore, NaFeEDTA, microencapsulated ferrous fumarate, and micronized elemental iron are potential fortificants in curry powder and salt. Dry forms of retinyl acetate or palmitate are bioavailable fortificants of vitamin A in dry candidate vehicles, but there are no published studies of these fortificants in fluid vehicles. Studies of zinc and folic acid bioavailability in seasonings and condiments are also lacking...|$|R
40|$|Phaeocystis {{antarctica}} is {{an abundant}} phytoplankton {{species in the}} Southern Ocean, where growth is frequently limited by iron and light. Being able to grow under low iron conditions {{is essential to the}} species' success, but there have been hints that this ability differs among clones. Here, we compare the growth, cell size and chlorophyll a concentrations of four P. antarctica clones cultured under different iron and light conditions. Iron was provided either as unchelated iron (Fe') or bound to the bacterial siderophore desferrioxamine B, representing, respectively, the most and least <b>bioavailable</b> forms of <b>iron</b> which phytoplankton encounter in the marine environment. The growth rate data demonstrate that the clones vary in their ability to grow using organically bound iron, and that this ability is not related to their ability to grow at low inorganic iron concentrations. These results are consistent at low and high light. Physiologically, only three of the four clones shrink or decrease the concentration of chlorophyll a in response to iron limitation, and only one clone decreases colony formation. Together, our data show that P. antarctica clones 1) respond to the same degree of iron limitation using different acclimation strategies, and 2) vary in their ability to grow under the same external iron and light conditions. This physiological diversity is surprisingly large for isolates of a single phytoplankton species...|$|R
