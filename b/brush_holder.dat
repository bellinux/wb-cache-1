40|$|The work {{concerns}} the constructive characteristics optimization of brushless D. C. (direct current) motors used in electromechanical spacecraft drives. The spacecraft electromechanical drives and units use rather widely the brushless D. C. motors {{in which a}} motor commutator is replaced with more reliable semiconductor commutator controlled by the rotor position sensors. However, these motors are of low power. Electrohydraulic actuators (EHA) use simple permanent-magnet motors (PMM) of rather high power and commutator motors with graphite brush variable contacts. High reliability of brush motors, and, therefore a reliability of EHA in general, substantially depends {{on the quality of}} motor commutator operation. There are different reasons for a possible impact on the normal motor commutator operation. One of them is brush wear. Sparking brushes and burning commutator bars are possible in case brushes are poorly grinded to fit, brushes cannot freely move true in the <b>brush</b> <b>holder</b> box, and in case an incorrect force to clamp brushes to the commutator is chosen. It is established that drive wear resistance and operability depends on the gas environment composition being under sealed motor housing. In dry nitrogen environment brush wear suddenly raises because of the changing tribological performances of the commutator thus leading to essentially falling isolation resistance and no motor start. It is recommended to fill a space under sealed motor housing with air. Positive experience of operating spacecraft device containers with mobile electromechanical couples allowed us to find that in this case a dew point of filled air must be minus 20 ˚C. The paper offers an electromechanical alternative of design to the electrohydraulic actuators, with a ball-screw gear of the actuation mechanism, possessing a number of advantages. </p...|$|E
40|$|Resumo: O objetivo deste trabalho foi avaliar a rugosidade {{superficial}} de três marcas comerciais de compósitos (Herculite XR, Prisma APH e P 50); dois ionômeros de vidro (Vidrion R e Chelon Fil) e um amálgama (Dispersalloy), submetidos à ação de um dentifrício (Kolynos Super Branco / Anakol), num ensaio de escovação in vitro. Os corpos de prova foram confeccionados em matrizes de plax-glass com dimensões de 20 x 10 x 2 mm, em número de oito, para cada material. Para a realização do ensaio foi utilizada uma máquina de escovação (Equilabor) com escovas extra-macias (Prevent 30 / Anakol) sob a ação de uma carga de 200 g. Cada material foi submetido a 250 escovações por minuto, num período de 2 horas, totalizando 30. 000 ciclos por amostra. Com auxílio do perfilômetro Perth-O-Meter M 2 P (Perthen-Mahr / Alemanha), utilizando o parâmetro Ra (rugosidade média), foram realizadas seis leituras para medida da rugosidade em cada corpo de prova, totalizando 288 leituras no experimento completo. Os resultados da análise estatística mostraram que não houve alteração da textura superficial dos materiais submetidos apenas à ação de uma escova extramacia em água destilada, porém quando foi acrescido o dentifrício, todos os materiais restauradores tiveram a sua topografia alterada. O material que apresentou a superfície-controle com maior rugosidade superficial inicial foi o Dispersalloy (0, 6394 &# 956;m), seguido pelo Vidrion R (0, 2697 &# 956;m), Chelon Fil (0, 1760 &# 956;m), Herculite XR (0, 0491 &# 956;m), P 50 (0, 0342 &# 956;m) e por último o Prisma APH (0, 0338 &# 956;m). Porém, esta ordem foi alterada, após o ensaio de escovação, ou seja, o Vidrion R apresentou a maior rugosidade (1, 2508 &# 956;m), seguido pelo HercuJite XR (1, 0300 p,m), Chelon Fil (0, 6210 &# 956;m), Prisma APH (0, 4542 &# 956;m), Dispersaloy (0, 4082 &# 956;m) e por último, o P 50 (0, 2754 &# 956;m). Também foi possível observar que em todos os materiais ocorreu um aumento da rugosidade superficial, exceto para o amálgama, que reduziu a rugosidade inicial para os níveis mais baixos, sem apresentar diferença estatística significativa, a nível de ' 5 % de significância, quando comparado com os materiais menos rugosos após a escovação (APH e P 50). Abstract: The {{purpose of}} this study was to evaluate the surface roughness oí direct restorative materiaIs (composite resins, glass ionomers and amalgam) submitted to a in vitro toothbrushing test. Three composite resins (Herculite XR, Prisma APH and P 50), two glass ionomers (Vidrion R and Chelon Fil) and an amalgam (Dispersalloy) were studied. Eigth samples of each material were obtained in plaxglass matrices measuring 20 x 10 x 2 mm. The tooth brushing machine had eight containers and the specimens were fixed in the botton of them. The brushes used were the Prevent 30 (Anakol) extra-soft type. These brushes wete glued to the stainless steel <b>brush</b> <b>holder.</b> The load af the brush was 200 g. The toothpaste used for these experimet was Kolynos Super Branco (Anakol), and the slurry was made by mixing 6 ml of distilled water and 6 g of toothpaste. Seven of the eight containers, with the specimens in position, received the slurry, and the last, only distilled water. The eletric motor produced 250 strokes / min and the machine was activated until the counter registered 30, 000 strokes. The brushes and the slurry were substituted for each material. Concluded the brushing cycle of two hours the specimens were removed from the machine, washed in tap water and stored at 37 ºC and 100 % relative umidity of the air until measuring the surface roughness. The specimens were then placed on a profilometer (Perth-O-Meter M 2 P / Perthen-Mahr) to measure the surface roughness, in micrometers, by the Ra parameter. A total of 288 readings were made in 48 samples. The statistic analyses of the results showed that the brushing with extra-soft brush and water didn't affect the surface topography of the analised materials. But; when the toothpaste was associated to the brushes, all materials showed an alteration of the surface topography. The material with the roughest inicial surface was Dispersalloy (0, 6394 &# 956;m), followed by Vidrion R (0, 2697 &# 956;m), Chelon Fil (0, 1760 &# 956;m), Herculite XR (0, 0491 &# 956;m), P 50 (0, 0342 &# 956;m) and Prisma APH (0, 0338 &# 956;m). After the toothbrushing test, the roughest material was Vidrion R (1, 2508 &# 956;m), followed by Herclliite XR (1, 0300 &# 956;m), Chelon Fil (0, 6210 &# 956;m), Prisma APH (0, 4542 &# 956;m), Dispersalloy (0, 4082 &# 956;m) and P 50 (0, 2754 &# 956;m). In all materials an increase of the roughness occured except for the amalgam in which the inicial roughness was reduced. There was no statistical difference between the surface of the amalgam when compared with the materiais that showed the less rough surface after brushing (Prisma APH and P 50) ...|$|E

I’ve been keeping my fingers crossed that you’ll {{be able to get}} off this weekend. Golly, darling, it’s been so darned long since I saw you last. Seems like a few years instead of eight days. Lord this time has gone slowly since you left last Wednesday. Nest Sunday we’ll have been married for two weeks. Yeh, married for two weeks + been together less than three days! That’s a great way to start! Everytime [sic] I wait for a call from you I’m a nervous wreck! Lord, honey, I’m all shaky + I’ve got butterflies during a rumba + golly, honey, I’m really bad off. Just wrote Mother + Daddy a letter. Send them the list of announcements. They’ll never be able to read it. Golly, darling, it’ll probably be about an hour no two hours before you call. My butterflies are really cutting up tonight. Golly, darling, it really is an emergency. We just got married + everything. He should understand. Maybe he’s not married though. This suspense. Time passing Well, honey, it’s seven o’clock now. Then after to be exact + I’m just about going crazy. That fool phone hasn’t even tingled. Why doesn’t it ring. I’ve tried to read + to eat + everything but, golly, honey, I just can’t do anything except wait. Golly, honey, I hope you’ll be able to get off this weekend. This suspense is awful. Washed my hair at Alice’s today. Her husband thinks I’m crazy. Mrs. Moseley just brought in a salad to me- she’s so nice. I was sure lucky to get a nice landlady. Most of them are awful stinkers from what the girls have told me. They go through their things + - oh listen to their conversations and are just about as agreeable as a zombie. Golly, won’t that phone ever ring – Wonder if it’s out of order or something- It’s seven fifteen now my nerves are really shot. If you can get off, honey, I have to leave here on a bus at 5 : 50. What an hour. All I’ve done since we’ve been married is get up at horrible hours of the night but {{if you were going to}} be there I’d get up at anytimes. Golly, I hope you got that pass I’m so excited about seeing you again. Golly, darling I hope it’s going to be all right. Can’t write any more. I’ll wait until after you call, honey. Nothing I say will be intelligent (no remarks) now. I love you so, Judd + hope we can be together this weekend. Here’s an example of what you’ll be up against when- “Crouched beneath a palm (tree) I heard a voice yell, “Hey, Lieutenant, what’ll I do with these prisoners?” Down the path sauntered a tall G. I. shepherding two disheveled Tojos. I was furious- “Listen” I hissed. “Don’t you know these woods are lousy with Jap snipers just laying for Officers? Call me Joe. Call me anything but don’t call me ‘Lieutenant’!” “Okay, Stupid, what’ll I do with these prisoners?” The Alabama jokes are even cornier than the ones from Pelham.

Darling you finally called an golly, honey, I’m so sorry that we can’t be together this weekend. It would have been wonderful though. Gee, honey, this certainly has been some marriage. It will be two weeks this Sunday and we’ve only been together two and a half days. Christmas, honey, we can’t go on much longer like this. I’m just about going crazy, honey. It’s awful. I’m so awfully lonesome + no matter how many people I meet it still doesn’t help any because you’re the only one who will make me happy. Good lord, honey, this is awful. I don’t think I can take much more of this. When you go overseas, darling, I really will go crazy. Hope it won’t be for a good long time though, honey. There isn’t any chance of your being made an instructor, honey. Darn it. I would like it but I guess that would be too easy. Lord, I wish this war would end. Golly, honey, I never minded being alone before but now I really dread it. I mean without you- as long as I know you’re coming home every night it’s all right. But I’ve developed the worst fear of being alone without you. Ever since the night we were married. Gee, honey, you think it’s bad for you- at least you have planes to keep you happy but it really hasn’t been so awfully bad. I just like to gripe about it. That was some conversation we had. All we both did was complain about how tough everything was. But, gee, honey, it certainly isn’t fair to have everything happen to us. Don’t know what I’ll do if you can’t live off the Post. That will be too much. So you think we’ll be heading for Lincoln, huh. Oh, well, I like traveling. How long will we be there? It will probably be over for you after that, won’t it, honey. What happened to this old pool they’ve had here for so long. Darn it. Everyone was here for at least a month after they graduated- usually three or four. Why does everything happen to us. Christmas, honey, what are they trying to do to us. I’ve definitely decided the Army doesn’t like wives. In fact I think they dislike them intensely. We must have the same weather here that you do because it poured here Tuesday, too. Yesterday + today were real nice. As I told you I’ve been trying to get a tan but all I got was freckles on my nose- they look horrid! Golly, honey, I love you so. Why can’t we be together- and listen, stop opening my mail. And after you finish reading it how about sending it to me- it’s a fine thing! Golly, honey, you’d better find those cards! And another thing- what was that remark you made about me doing some cooking because we’d get sick of eating out. You know as well as I do that we’d be a lot sicker if I cooked. Besides Mrs. Moseley won’t let me cook. She just lets me keep a few things in the ice box. Like milk + peanut butter. Going to get some fruit tomorrow, honey. Very exciting thought. Wish I had something to throw! I’m in a horrible mood. Besides I’m mad at the Army. They’re ruining our married life and they can’t do that to you. Golly, another thing I don’t like the way they don’t send your mail to you. Here I write + write + write and they don’t bother to send it down to you. That movin’ pitchers they have down there must be great. Eglin must really be a wonderful place. They certainly don’t run things right. Let’s you and I change things. Golly you’ve been down there over a week now and have only fired 600 rounds out of 3, 000. That’s really great. I’m just so happy. Why couldn’t they wait until the weather was going to be nice before they sent you down. What are weather observers, or whatever they have, for- Golly. I don’t like the way the Army runs things. Especially our lives. Why don’t you tell them how they should change that program. It sounds pretty dumb to me, too, honey. After all the trouble they take to train you to fly there to rush you through some course in 17 days that will be your life when you’re in combat. Ah, yes, the efficient little Army. They’re really doing great. Just great. Don’t tell me we’re going to get a leave. They’ll probably decide against it the day before we’re ready to leave. Did you know that everyone who graduated from Craig got 15 days! Why didn’t you to Craig. Golly, darling, we sure get all the breaks. (There are cadets who get the 15 days). By the way darling, how is your stiff neck? And how pray tell did you get it? Thought there were no women around there. My family are going to think its mighty queer when they receive my letters and none of them say very much about you. But, golly, I don’t want to lie to them. Well, honey, this certain has been a novel way to spend a honeymoon. You down at Eglin + me here at Selma. Nothing like a few hundred miles between a couple on their honeymoon. DO you think we will ever have one, honey? Honey, what do they put in that Florida sunshine or is it the PX that makes you write such crazy letters. You’re really getting crazier by the day. Gee, honey, it was so good to hear your voice. I’m sorry you couldn’t hear me very well but it was just as well because I didn’t have much to say. I am very discusted [sic]. I want a husband with me + a honeymoon + oh, honey, I just miss you so darned much. Guess, I’d better be getting to bed now. It’s getting kinda late now. Maybe I’ll feel better in the morning. There’s not much hope of that, at least not until Easter morning, anyway. Gee, darling, we’ll have to begin all over again. I don’t even feel married any more. Maybe I can get me a tan by the time you get back. I certainly will have enough time anyway. Why can’t they send you back Saturday night instead of Sunday morning? That would be the nicest thing to do. But no- They have to keep you down in that hole another night. Well, maybe we can be together on our third anniversary. Everyone around here thinks it’s a big joke. Hah, hah, hah- does that sound bitter. Well, at this point it certainly should. Everyone practically has hystories [sic] over the way things happened. We sure get all the breaks- Oh, well, it can’t go on like this- can it? Well, darling it won’t be much longer now. You should be home Sunday. I’ll be hoping anyway. Took $ 35 out of the bank today + in the mood I’m in I’d better hurry and get it back before I go out + spend it all. I’d take a fiendish delight in doing something like that right now. Good thing all the stores are closed. Gee, darling, I wish these 17 days would hurry. I love you so much. Honey, I really need you. You’re so essential to me. They should know better than to try to separate us. I’m just lost without you, darling. Well, maybe in about ten more days you’ll be back. Golly, darling, that’s a heck of a long time. There’s nothing we can do about it though, except wait. Tomorrow I won’t get a letter from you, honey, because you said you didn’t write last night. Oh well. Hope that you start receiving mine, honey, not that they’re anything to read but I know how much I look forward to your letters, honey. It’s just awful not to get one. Well, sweetheart, it’s not getting any earlier. That’s a brilliant statement. So I guess it’s way past my bedtime. Say hello to Tom + D. A. for me. If you get a stack of letters all at once you’re going to spend quite a while saying hello to Tom + D. A. for me. Oh, Julie + Betty Joe said hello from then (to you.) They’re sorry that we couldn’t be together, too. Not half as sorry as I am. Well, darling, only about ten more nights. I hope less and we’ll be together. Do you think you’ll be able to be together? It would really be awful if you had to go back every night. Well, again, goodnite [sic], honey. I miss you so. I love you so, Judd + hope we can be together again. You’ll always have all my love and devotion + I love you so. Your devoted wife (who is slightly lonesome) Dottie [Translation ends...|$|E
