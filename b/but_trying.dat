5|$|Looking to do {{a family}} film, Johnny Depp visited the Walt Disney Studios in 2001 {{when he heard}} of plans to adapt the Pirates of the Caribbean ride into a film. Depp was excited by the {{possibility}} of reviving an old Hollywood genre, and found the script met his quirky sensibilities: the crew of the Black Pearl were not in search of treasure <b>but</b> <b>trying</b> to return it to lift a curse on them, and the traditional mutiny had already occurred. Depp was cast on June 10, 2002. Producer Jerry Bruckheimer felt Depp would give the film an edge that could draw teenage and adult audiences despite Disney's reputation for soft children's fare.|$|E
25|$|The British frigates {{left the}} battle at 4 pm, and {{although}} after consulting among themselves the British commanders resolved return to fight at 4:30 pm, they finally withdrew {{half an hour}} later. The imminence of the nightfall {{and the possibility of}} running aground on the coast between Huelva and Ayamonte convinced Alonso de Torres y Guerra to turn back to Cádiz instead of chasing Galloway's division, <b>but</b> <b>trying</b> before to sail between the retreating British ships to shoot upon them two complete broadsides. The British vessels, however, managed to avoid the action by taking advantage of its fasteness and the darkness of the dusk.|$|E
25|$|Charles {{spent the}} years 1702–06 in a {{protracted}} struggle with Augustus II the Strong; {{he had already}} inflicted defeat on him at Riga in June 1701 and took Warsaw the following year, <b>but</b> <b>trying</b> to force a decisive defeat proved elusive. Russia withdrew from Poland {{in the spring of}} 1706, abandoning artillery but escaping from the pursuing Swedes, who stopped at Pinsk. Charles wanted not just to defeat the Commonwealth army but to depose Augustus, whom he regarded as especially treasonous, and have him replaced with someone who would be a Swedish ally, though this goal proved hard to achieve. After years of marches and fighting around Poland he finally had to invade Augustus' hereditary Saxony to bring him out of the war. In the treaty of Altranstädt (1706), Augustus was indeed forced to step down from the Polish throne, but Charles had lost a valuable time advantage over his main enemy in the east, Peter I, who had had the time to recover and build up a new and better army.|$|E

25|$|With {{the start}} of Game 3 delayed by rain {{for an hour and}} 31 minutes, the series finally resumed in Philadelphia just after 10 pm EST. Jamie Moyer became the oldest pitcher to start a World Series game, facing off against ALCS MVP Matt Garza. Philadelphia was on the board early, as Chase Utley was put out on a ground ball that scored a runner from third. The Rays would even the game at one run each in the 2nd inning as Gabe Gross flew out on a {{sacrifice}} fly. The Phillies would take the lead back in the 2nd inning after a solo home run by Carlos Ruiz. The Phillies would make it 4–1 in the 6th inning from back-to-back home runs by Chase Utley and Ryan Howard. Gabe Gross scored Carl Crawford by grounding out, and Jason Bartlett would do the same to score Dioner Navarro during the next at-bat to make the score 4–3 Philadelphia. In the 8th inning for the Rays, B.J. Upton would single to reach base. During Evan Longoria's at-bat, Upton would steal 2nd base, and later steal 3rd base in the same at-bat. Trying to throw out Upton at 3rd base, Phillies catcher Carlos Ruiz made a throwing error which allowed Upton to score and tie the game at 4–4. The 9th inning went sour for the Rays defensively, as Phillies batter Eric Bruntlett was hit by a pitch. When Bruntlett attempted to steal 2nd base, Rays catcher Dioner Navarro made a throwing error which allowed Bruntlett to advance to 3rd base. The Rays intentionally walked the next two batters, which loaded the bases with no outs. Carlos Ruiz would hit a soft ground ball down the 3rd base line, which was fielded cleanly by Rays 3rd baseman Evan Longoria, <b>but</b> <b>trying</b> to toss to Navarro at home to make a forceout, sailed the throw over the catcher's head, and the winning run was scored by the Phillies to win the game 5–4, and take a two games to one series lead. Because of the game's late start, it was not completed until 1:47 am EST.|$|E
500|$|Baby Gerald, Luigi Risotto, Assistant Superintendent Leopold, and Flanders' parents {{make their}} first {{appearances}} {{on the show}} in this episode. Leopold and Luigi were designed by David Silverman, one of the show's directors. Anderson thought Luigi {{was one of the}} funniest characters on the show when he first read Luigi's lines in the script during a table read of the episode. When Anderson skimmed through the script and saw Luigi's lines, he said he [...] "frightened Julie Kavner because I was laughing to myself, <b>but</b> <b>trying</b> to keep the laughter in because it was so damn funny." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{appearance}} of a live alien and flying saucer was in flux. Spielberg wanted the alien to resemble a Grey alien, and also rejected early versions of the saucer that looked [...] "too Close Encounters". Art director Christian Alzmann said the aesthetic was [...] "looking {{at a lot of}} older B-movie designs– <b>but</b> <b>trying</b> to make that look more real and gritty to fit in with the Indy universe." [...] Other reference for the visual effects work included government tapes of nuclear tests, and video reference of real prairie dogs shot in 1080p by Nathan Edward Denning.|$|E

500|$|In {{the sixth}} chapter, [...] "Dilemmas of Dominance", Chomsky explores the {{relationship}} that the U.S. has had with Eastern Europe {{since the collapse of}} the Soviet Union and with East Asia since the Second World War. In the former, Chomsky argues, the U.S. has allied itself with the capitalist reformers who have advocated privatization and neoliberalism {{at the expense of the}} welfare state, leading to increased poverty and demographic decline across the region. In the latter, he has explored the role that the U.S. has played – through the likes of the San Francisco Peace Treaty of 1951 – in supporting capitalist development, <b>but</b> <b>trying</b> to ensure its own economic hegemony at the same time.|$|E
500|$|In 1997, the Strokes {{consisted}} of singer Julian Casablancas, guitarist Nick Valensi, bassist Nikolai Fraiture, and drummer Fabrizio Moretti. Casablancas's stepfather and Moretti's and Fraiture's older brothers introduced the quartet {{to the music}} of reggae artist Bob Marley, protopunk group the Velvet Underground, and alternative rock band Jane's Addiction. Discussing the formative stages of the group, Moretti noted, [...] "Our music was, like, , <b>but</b> <b>trying</b> to be classical. We all took music classes and tried writing songs, and when we put them together they were this crazy amalgam of insane ideas that we thought was really cool." [...] In 1998, Albert Hammond, Jr., who Casablancas knew from his time at a Swiss boarding school, moved to New York City to attend film school and joined The Strokes as a second guitarist. His arrival provided the catalyst for the band's musical and emotional evolution.|$|E
500|$|Among the Canadians, {{only two}} players were not suspended: goalie Jimmy Waite and forward Pierre Turgeon. [...] Waite {{felt he could}} not risk being ejected for {{fighting}} under {{the belief that the}} game would resume, and that the Canadian backup goaltender, Shawn Simpson, was injured. [...] Steve Nemeth would later apply for early reinstatement arguing that he was not fighting, <b>but</b> <b>trying</b> to help break the players apart. [...] Many of their teammates never forgave Turgeon for failing to defend his teammates. In the words of Everett Sanipass: [...] "I'm looking for someone to help (Stéphane) Roy out and I look over at the bench. [...] There's this dog Turgeon, just sitting there, with his head down. He wouldn't get his ass off the bench ... just sitting there when everyone's off the Soviet bench and at least one of our guys is in real trouble getting double-teamed." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Tears Run Dry" [...] was {{originally}} an instrumental by Crada {{and later on}} strings were added. The song is a 'venting' record, where Tinie shares personal thoughts and then turns into a heavier finale. According to Tinie it was amended about 37 times due to constant adjustments and improvements. [...] "Lost Ones" [...] is about a couple splitting up <b>but</b> <b>trying</b> to maintain their pride, and then realising that in reality they do regret it. Paloma Faith recorded an [...] "eerie" [...] vocal for the chorus. Apparently Tinie wanted {{a part of the}} album to be motivational, and conveys this with the songs [...] "Children of the Sun", [...] "A Heart Can Save the World" [...] and [...] "Heroes". Emeli Sandé features on [...] "A Heart Can Save the World", and also wrote Laura Mvula's chorus for [...] "Heroes". Sandé also appeared on the Disc-Overy track [...] "Let Go". All three tracks are produced by Naughty Boy, a frequent collaborator with Sandé.|$|E
500|$|Hoffman {{occasionally}} {{changed his}} hair and lost or gained weight for parts, {{and he went to}} great lengths to reveal the worst in his characters. But in a 2012 interview he confessed that performing to a high standard was a challenge: [...] "The job isn't difficult. Doing it well is difficult." [...] In an earlier interview with The New York Times, he explained how deeply he loved acting but added, [...] "that deep kind of love comes at a price: for me, acting is torturous, and it's torturous because you know it's a beautiful thing... Wanting it is easy, <b>but</b> <b>trying</b> to be great– well, that's absolutely torturous." [...] This struggle was confirmed by the author John le Carré, who met Hoffman during the adaptation of his novel A Most Wanted Man. While praising the actor's intelligence and intuition, le Carré acknowledged the burden that Hoffman felt: [...] "It was painful and exhausting work, and probably in the end his undoing. The world was too bright for him to handle." ...|$|E
500|$|In each of {{the months}} leading up to its release, Hunt {{promoted}} the album by releasing new songs as free downloads. They were made available through music websites, blogs, and his own website. The song [...] "June" [...] was released through The Huffington Post on June 15. Excluded from the album, it is a somber, jazz-styled track that contrasts the album's raw aesthetic, with upright bass and blue chord changes. Hunt explained the song to be [...] "about a somber girl. I'm identifying with her somberness, <b>but</b> <b>trying</b> to make her smile ... he June bloom has set in her and she's struggling with it." [...] On July 7, Hunt released another non-album track, [...] "The Savage, Sincere L of P", on Pastes website. It features a soulful rock style and lyrics about the pleasures of the flesh and [...] "the savage, sincere look of pleasure". The album's lead single, [...] "Eyes Like Pearls", was released on September 9 via Hunt's Facebook page. Hunt also promoted the album with a 20-date national headlining tour, his first national tour since 2008. It began on September 19 at Webster Hall in New York City and concluded on October 13 at Yoshi's in San Francisco. He performed with members of his session band, drummer Ruth Price and keyboardist Peter Dyer, as well as guitarist Douglas Showalter. Prior to the tour, they had played at the 21st NAACP Theatre Awards gala on August 29.|$|E

500|$|... "Louboutins" [...] {{received}} mixed reception from critics. Elana Gorgan of Softpedia {{focused on}} the single cover and concept of the song. She said [...] "While {{the idea of the}} track is original, critics and fans alike say, the artwork is lackluster at best... There is a certain old vibe to the cover, what with the font of the writing and the shot in itself, but it's not helping the singer in any way garner much interest in the release." [...] Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly said [...] " [...] does for the ultra high-end shoe brand what Crocs do for sexy." [...] She pointed out how the song was not as good as Lopez's previous material and at one point even called the song [...] "Poo". Further to this, Peter Gicas of E! Online was also critical of the song, suggesting that the song leaked online before its official debut to warn fans of what Lopez was about to inflict on them. [...] "The track begins with the singer insisting, [...] "I'm taking back my love." [...] Personally, we wish we could take back the last three minutes and 49 seconds." [...] Tom Stacks of Entertainment Weekly was less than impressed saying [...] "J. Lo needs to move on from her recording career. She had some fun, catchy songs ('If You Had My Love,' 'Love Don't Cost a Thing'), <b>but</b> <b>trying</b> to regain musical relevance by singing about pricey high-heels just seems a little sad. I say focus on getting the movie career back on track..." ...|$|E
500|$|Among {{the reviews}} were several {{negative}} ones, which compared the series negatively to the original. Matthew Gilbert of The Boston Globe felt that like the original, 90210 was [...] "pretty bad". Gilbert {{said that the}} episode [...] "seemed to take forever to set up some remarkably bland plotlines", which he found had been executed with more finesse by other teen soaps. The reviewer criticized the writers for their [...] "unimaginative material", exemplified by the risqué anal sex scene which he opined {{would no longer be}} considered outrageous for a series targeted at teenagers. Gilbert claimed that the characters lacked depth and distinction, especially Naomi, whom he compared negatively to Gossip Girls Blair Waldorf. By contrast, Tom Gliatto of People magazine gave Naomi Clark a favorable review, but stated that he felt the cast as a whole had yet to gel. Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly described the pilot as [...] "corny <b>but</b> <b>trying</b> to be hip, crammed with subplots until the producers figure out which ones the audience responds to." [...] Tucker praised Walters acting as a [...] "slashing panache that no one else on screen approaches", and found the only time he laughed with pleasure throughout the pilot was when her character exclaimed, [...] "I'm gonna call Dan Tana's for some takeout!". Hal Boedeker of the Orlando Sentinel described the pilot as [...] "a blah variation on Beverly Hills, 90210", and being too [...] "extravagant and less believable". Boedeker expressed disappointment in the series, and predicted that it would be canceled within a year.|$|E
500|$|Mylod {{additionally}} {{spoke about}} filming the final {{scenes of the}} episode, the foot chase between Arya and the Waif, in the behind the scenes featurette published by HBO after the airing of the episode. Mylod stated that he did extensive research {{in order to create}} the foot chase, saying [...] "I devoured every foot chase in the history of cinema, <b>but</b> <b>trying</b> to take from that something that would fit into the blueprint of the Game of Thrones visual style, which is not necessarily the same kind of kinetic, handheld feel that you find in many contemporary thrillers. It's a much more classic frame." [...] He continued, [...] "Everything hinged from finding this very lovely, steep stairwell and thinking 'Wouldn't it be great if she leapt off that, and then tumbled down the stairs?' I had this image in my head that I wanted lots of oranges rolling down, not quite sure where that comes from, but it looked pretty." [...] Mylod also stated in a separate interview that it was a conscious decision not to show the final fight between Arya and the Waif, given that it took place in the dark, noting [...] "when the character dies in the dark, unless we switch on night-vision goggles, we're {{not going to be able}} to see that, and we're not going to stick around to hear a scream in the dark anyway. It was actually a conscious choice in the writing and I think, for me, a very elegant storytelling beat as to get that reveal a few seconds later." ...|$|E

500|$|Two {{years of}} {{kindergarten}} were offered, beginning at age four, and students progressed through to first grade {{with other students}} their age. The Cottage School was free to all students, and was supported both by Coonley's own resources and funds raised by the Kindergarten Education Association. The Association, of which Coonley was president, promoted new educational ideas and raised money to help support them. In 1915, John Dewey and his daughter Evelyn featured the Cottage School in their book, The Schools of To-Morrow, which examined how progressive {{schools around the country}} put new educational ideas into action. They were especially struck by how prominently nature featured in school life, noting that they have, for example, a rare bird that is as much a personality in school life as any of the children, and the children, having cared for him and watched his growth and habits, have become much more interested in wild birds. In the backyard is a goat, the best liked thing on the place, where the children have raised him from a little kid; and they still do all the work of caring for him. The Deweys held the Cottage School as an example of training in good citizenship, commenting on its mock elections, self-government, and public service: [...] "The school organized by the pupils into a civic league has made itself responsible for the conditions of the streets in certain portions of town, and is not only cleaning up <b>but</b> <b>trying</b> to get the rest of the town interested in the problem." [...] The teaching of English was also noted, as it was not taught as a separate subject but as part of history lessons, journal-keeping, and other exercises. Dewey wrote, [...] "The emphasis is put on helping the child to express his ideas; but such work provides ample opportunity for the required drill in the mechanics of writing." ...|$|E
500|$|The fugitives reached Catesby's {{family home}} of Ashby St Ledgers at about 6:00pm. [...] Not wanting to {{implicate}} his mother, Catesby {{sent a message}} to Robert, who had just recently arrived there, asking to meet just outside the town. [...] There he told him that Fawkes had been captured. [...] At Dunchurch they collected Everard Digby and his 'hunting party', which included Robert and Thomas's half-brother, John Wintour. [...] He had been invited to join them on 4 November. [...] The next day the group raided Warwick Castle for supplies, something that Robert strongly objected to as it would create [...] "a great uproar" [...] in the country, and later arrived at Huddington Court, where they met Thomas. [...] Early the next morning Huddington's occupants went to confession and took the Sacrament at Mass—in Fraser's opinion, a sign that none of them thought they had long to live. [...] They collected further arms and munitions from Hewell Grange, <b>but</b> <b>trying</b> to recruit more people to their cause they were met with disdain; while the conspirators considered themselves to stand for [...] "God and country", the men of Hewell Grange replied that they were for [...] "King James as well as God and Country". [...] Late that night, pulling a sodden cart full of weapons and armour behind them, they arrived at Holbeche House, near Kingswinford in Staffordshire. [...] Robert was asked if he would go and see if he could elicit any help from his father-in-law, John Talbot at his mansion at 'Pepperhill'. [...] He refused, and Thomas went instead, with Stephen Littleton. [...] Talbot was, however, loyal to James, and sent them away, claiming that their visit was [...] "as much as his life was worth". [...] While returning to Holbeche, they received a message that Catesby, Rookwood, John Grant and another man were dead, and the rest apparently fled. [...] Tired and desperate, the plotters had attempted to dry their soaked gunpowder in front of the fire, only for a stray spark to ignite it. [...] While Littleton chose to leave, begging his companion to follow his example, Thomas continued on to Holbeche, where he found the remaining plotters alive, but injured.|$|E
