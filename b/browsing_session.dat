40|$|Quantifying and {{modeling}} energy consumption in mobile devices {{are essential for}} developing energy-aware protocols and energy reduction techniques. In this work, we address the energy requirements for secure Web <b>browsing</b> <b>sessions</b> over handheld mobile devices. The contributions of this work are twofold. On one hand, we present a detailed study based on experimental measurements to quantify the energy consumed by the mobile device during secure Web <b>browsing</b> <b>sessions.</b> This includes the energy consumed due to data transmission/reception, encryption/decryption, hashing in addition to browser processing. On the other hand, we derive an empirical energy consumption model for secure Web browsing {{as a function of}} various protocol and device parameters. The developed model can be utilized to identify the various components that affect energy consumption during secure Web <b>browsing</b> <b>sessions,</b> to implement application-layer energy models in network simulation tools, and to develop adaptive energy-aware Web browsing protocols. The effectiveness of the developed model is demonstrated via experimental testing on several secure websites. PublishedN/...|$|R

40|$|Training {{statistical}} dialog {{models in}} spoken dialog systems (SDS) requires {{large amounts of}} annotated data. The lack of scalable methods for data mining and annotation poses a significant hurdle for state-of-the-art statistical dialog managers. This paper presents an approach that directly leverage billions of web search and <b>browse</b> <b>sessions</b> to overcome this hurdle. The key insight is that task completion through web search and <b>browse</b> <b>sessions</b> is (a) predictable and (b) generalizes to spoken dialog task completion. The new method automatically mines behavioral search and browse patterns from web logs and translates them into spoken dialog models. We experiment with naturally occurring spoken dialogs and large scale web logs. Our session-based models outperform the state-of-the-art method for entity extraction task in SDS. We also achieve better performance for both entity and relation extraction on web search queries when compared with nontrivial baselines. Comment: ICASSP 201...|$|R

50|$|Because the tabbed {{document}} interface holds many different documents logically under one window, {{it keeps the}} primary operating system interface free of the clutter that would be created by {{a large number of}} small child windows.

5000|$|The {{official}} {{releases of}} Firefox for macOS are universal builds that include both 32-bit and 64-bit {{versions of the}} browser in one package, and have been this way since Firefox 4. A typical <b>browsing</b> <b>session</b> uses {{a combination of the}} 64-bit browser process and a 32-bit plugin process, because some popular plugins still are 32-bit. [...] As of April 19, 2017, Firefox 53 has dropped support for 32-bit macOS.|$|E
50|$|In 2015, {{researchers}} from Pennsylvania State University {{found that a}} considerable amount of extensions on Firefox violated the private browsing policy based on an investigation of the top 2,000 extensions.

40|$|Search engine {{optimization}} (SEO) {{techniques are}} often abused to promote websites among search results. This is a practice known as blackhat SEO. In this paper we tackle a newly emerging and especially aggressive class of blackhat SEO, namely search poisoning. Unlike other blackhat SEO techniques, which typically attempt {{to promote a}} website’s ranking only under a limited set of search keywords relevant to the website’s content, search poisoning techniques disregard any term relevance constraint and are employed to poison popular search keywords with {{the sole purpose of}} diverting large numbers of users to short-lived traffic-hungry websites for malicious purposes. To accurately detect search poisoning cases, we designed a novel detection system called SURF. SURF runs as a browser component to extract a number of robust (i. e., difficult to evade) detection features from search-then-visit <b>browsing</b> <b>sessions,</b> and is able to accurately classify malicious search user redirections resulted from user clicking on poisoned search results. Our evaluation on realworld search poisoning instances shows that SURF can achieve a detection rate of 99. 1 % at a false positive rate of 0. 9 %. Furthermore, we applied SURF to analyze a large dataset of search-related <b>browsing</b> <b>sessions</b> collected over a period of seven months starting in September 2010. Through this long-term measurement study we were able to reveal new trends and interesting patterns related to a great variety of poisoning cases, thus contributing {{to a better understanding of}} the prevalence and gravity of the search poisoning problem...|$|R
