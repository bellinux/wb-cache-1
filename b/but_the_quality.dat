5|$|Etty was {{prolific}} and commercially successful {{throughout the}} 1840s, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> {{of his work}} deteriorated throughout this period. As his health progressively worsened he retired to York in 1848. He died in 1849, shortly after a major retrospective exhibition. In {{the immediate aftermath of}} his death his works became highly collectable and sold for large sums. Changing tastes meant his work later fell out of fashion, and imitators soon abandoned his style. By the end of the 19th century the value of all of his works had fallen below their original prices, and outside his native York he remained little known throughout the 20th century. Etty's inclusion in Tate Britain's landmark Exposed: The Victorian Nude exhibition in 2001–02, the high-profile restoration of his The Sirens and Ulysses in 2010 and a major retrospective of his work at the York Art Gallery in 2011–12 led to renewed interest in his work.|$|E
5|$|For {{the first}} year, Amazing {{contained}} primarily reprinted material. It was proving difficult to attract new, high-quality material, and Gernsback's slowness at paying his authors did not help. Writers such as H.P. Lovecraft, H.G. Wells, and Murray Leinster all avoided Amazing because Gernsback {{took so long}} to pay for the stories he printed. The slow payments were probably known to many of the other active pulp writers, which would have further limited the volume of submissions. New writers did appear, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> of their stories was often weak.|$|E
5|$|Noted American {{architect}} Henry Hobson Richardson, {{known for}} his public buildings including several Boston and Albany Railroad depots, {{was hired by the}} Central Vermont in September 1885 to design the new station. Richardson likely obtained the commission through his friend and former classmate James A. Rumrill, who was a director of the railroad. New London was the last of many railroad stations worked on by Richardson before his death in 1886, though numerous others were designed by his students (including the nearby New London Public Library designed by Shepley, Rutan and Coolidge). Many of Richardson's later attributed works were designed primarily by his office staff, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> of the design indicates that it was closely supervised by Richardson. Richardson's biographer, Henry-Russell Hitchcock, considered New London to be his best station design.|$|E

5|$|The {{draft was}} then {{transferred}} by pencil on white-primed panels of hardwood end grain. Not {{only was it}} hard work, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> of the printing block was crucial. Everything left white on the block, around Busch's drawn lines, was cut from the plate by skilled engravers. Wood engraving allows a finer differentiation than woodcut and the potential tonal values are of almost the quality of intaglio printing, such as copper engraving. Sometimes the result was not satisfactory, leading Busch to rework or reproduce plates. The wood engraving technique did not allow for fine lines, which is why Busch's drawing, especially in his illustrated tales up to the mid-1870s, are boldly drawn, giving his work its particular characteristic.|$|E
25|$|Light therapy using {{ultraviolet}} light has tentative support <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> {{of the evidence}} is not very good.

Overexposure to {{ultraviolet light}} carries its own risks, particularly that of skin cancer.|$|E
25|$|His {{popularity}} and prolific output may in part {{have been his}} undoing, though. From 1803 through 1817, his work became more static, even as it became more popular. He continued to produce large quantities of prints, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> as a rule did not match that of his earlier days. Occasional prints from this period, however, show his old brilliance.|$|E

English is taught as a foreign language at all of the schools in Sulukta, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> of English teaching tends to be poor. Thus, in Sulukta Uzbek schoolchildren learn four languages and Kyrgyz schoolchildren learn three languages.|$|E

Gut feelings go beyond first impressions: Physicians expressed feeling doubtful about their initial impressions as they gathered more data from their patients. More experienced physicians reported more instances of gut feelings than those less experienced, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> of the intuition {{was related to the}} quality of feedback received during the data collection process in general.

25|$|Increased {{production}} costs and {{difficulties in the}} import of raw materials brought about {{a decrease in the}} number of films made in the 1970s, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> of films improved. In the early nineties, there were barely two or three movies released per year. During this period, most of the seventies' stars had either moved to TV, or were trying to rebuild the Yeşilçam's former glory. Some of the notable examples of this era are Eşkıya (The Bandit) and Züğürt Ağa (The Agha), both starring Şener Şen. Both movies were critically and commercially acclaimed.|$|E

25|$|The last {{important}} {{group of}} painters was the Leagros Group (520-500 BC), {{named after the}} kalos inscription they frequently used, Leagros. Amphoras and hydria, the latter often with palmettes in the predella, are the most frequently painted vessels. The image field is usually filled absolutely to capacity, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> of the images is still kept very high. Many of the over 200 vases in this group were decorated with scenes of the Trojan War {{and the life of}} Heracles Painters like the witty Acheloos Painter, the conventional Chiusi Painter, and the Daybreak Painter with his faithful detailing belong to the Leagros Group.|$|E
25|$|Narcolepsy is a {{long-term}} neurological disorder that involves a decreased ability to regulate sleep-wake cycles. Symptoms include periods of excessive daytime sleepiness that usually last from seconds to minutes and may occur at any time. About 70% of those affected also experience episodes of sudden loss of muscle strength, known as cataplexy. These spells can be brought on by strong emotions. Less commonly there may be inability to move or vivid hallucinations while falling asleep or waking up. People with narcolepsy tend to sleep {{about the same number}} of hours per day as people without, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> of sleep tends to be worse.|$|E
25|$|Several intercurrent {{diseases}} in pregnancy can potentially {{increase the risk}} of miscarriage, including diabetes, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), hypothyroidism, certain infectious diseases, and autoimmune diseases. PCOS may increases the risk of miscarriage. Two studies suggested treatment with the drug metformin significantly lowers the rate of miscarriage in women with PCOS, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> of these studies has been questioned. The use metformin treatment in pregnancy has not been shown to be safe. In 2007 the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists also recommended against use of the drug to prevent miscarriage. Thrombophilias or defects in coagulation and bleeding were once thought to be a risk in miscarriage but have been subsequently questioned.|$|E

25|$|The Akha have {{traditionally}} employed slash and burn agriculture, in which new fields are cleared by burning or cutting down forests and woodlands. In such a system, {{there is usually}} no market for land. Rights to land are considered traditional and established over many generations. This type of agriculture {{has contributed to the}} Akha's semi-nomadic status as villages move to clear new farmland with each successive burn cycle. The Thai government has forbidden this practice, citing its detrimental effects on the environment. The Akha have adapted to new types of subsistence farming, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> of their land has suffered as they are no longer allowed to expand onto new plots. In many cases, chemical fertilizers are the only option for re-fertilizing the land.|$|E
