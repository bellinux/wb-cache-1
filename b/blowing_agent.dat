Typically, one metric ton of polyurethane foam needs 616 kg of MDI and 386 kg of polyol, with 54 kg of pentane as a <b>blowing</b> <b>agent.</b> These rigid polyurethane foams are good thermal insulators and used in nearly all freezers and refrigerators worldwide, as well as buildings. Typical polyols used are polyethylene adipate (a polyester) and poly(tetramethylene ether) glycol (a polyether).|$|E
2500|$|In 1996, Dow Chemical won the 1996 Greener Reaction Conditions {{award for}} their 100% carbon dioxide <b>blowing</b> <b>agent</b> for {{polystyrene}} foam production. Polystyrene foam {{is a common}} material used in packing and food transportation. [...] Seven hundred million pounds are produced {{each year in the}} United States alone. Traditionally, CFC and other ozone-depleting chemicals were used in the production process of the foam sheets, presenting a serious environmental hazard. Flammable, explosive, and, in some cases toxic hydrocarbons have also been used as CFC replacements, but they present their own problems. [...] Dow Chemical discovered that supercritical carbon dioxide works equally as well as a <b>blowing</b> <b>agent,</b> without the need for hazardous substances, allowing the polystyrene to be more easily recycled. The CO2 used in the process is reused from other industries, so the net carbon released from the process is zero.|$|E
