50|$|In {{areas where}} the ground is {{permanently}} frozen, such as in Siberia, Alaska, and the Yukon, placer deposits may be mined underground. As the frozen ground is otherwise too hard and firm to mine by hand, historically fires were built so as to thaw the ground before digging it.

50|$|Despite {{the power}} and {{potentially}} destructive nature of <b>jet</b> <b>blast,</b> there are relatively few <b>jet</b> <b>blast</b> incidents. Due to the invisible nature of <b>jet</b> <b>blast</b> and the aerodynamic properties of light aircraft, light aircraft moving about airports are particularly vulnerable. Pilots of light aircraft frequently stay {{off to the side}} of the runway, rather than follow in the centre, to negate the effect of the blast.|$|R
25|$|Aircraft {{carriers}} use <b>jet</b> <b>blast</b> deflectors at {{the rear}} of aircraft catapults, positioned to protect other aircraft from exhaust <b>blast</b> damage. <b>Jet</b> <b>blast</b> deflectors are made of heavy duty material that is raised and lowered by hydraulic cylinders or linear actuators. The <b>jet</b> <b>blast</b> deflector lies flush with and serves as a portion of the flight deck until the aircraft to be launched rolls over it {{on the way to the}} catapult. When the aircraft is clear of the deflector, the heavy panel is raised into position to redirect the hot <b>jet</b> <b>blast.</b> As soon as the deflector is raised, another aircraft can be brought into position behind it, and flight deck personnel can perform final readiness duties without the danger of hot, violent exhaust gases. Such systems were installed on aircraft carriers in the late 1940s and early 1950s, as jet-powered aircraft began to appear in navies.|$|R

2500|$|<b>Jet</b> <b>blast</b> {{deflectors}} {{began to}} appear at airports in the 1950s. Airports in the 1960s used <b>jet</b> <b>blast</b> deflectors with a height of , but airports in the 1990s needed deflectors that were twice as high, and even up to [...] high for jet airliners such as the McDonnell Douglas DC-10 and MD-11, which have engines mounted in the tail above the fuselage. Airports often place their deflectors at the beginnings of runways, especially when roadways or structures are adjacent. Airports that are in dense urban areas often have deflectors between taxiways and airport borders. <b>Jet</b> <b>blast</b> deflectors usually direct exhaust gases upward. However, a low-pressure zone can form behind the blast fence, causing ambient air and debris to be drawn upward with the jet exhaust, and hot, toxic gases to circulate behind the <b>blast</b> fence. <b>Jet</b> <b>blast</b> deflectors {{have been designed to}} counteract this problem by using multiple panels and various angles, and by using slotted panel surfaces.|$|R

30|$|The {{process of}} the gas jet from {{aircraft}} engines impacting a <b>jet</b> <b>blast</b> deflector {{is not only a}} complex fluid–solid coupling problem that is not easy to compute, but also a safety issue that seriously interferes with flight deck environment. The computational fluid dynamics (CFD) method is used to simulate numerically the impact effect of gas jet from aircraft engines on a <b>jet</b> <b>blast</b> deflector by using the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations and turbulence models. First of all, during the pre-processing of numerical computation, a sub-domains hybrid meshing scheme is adopted to reduce mesh number and improve mesh quality. Then, four different turbulence models including shear-stress transport (SST) k-w, standard k-w, standard k-ε and Reynolds stress model (RSM) are used to compare and verify the correctness of numerical methods for gas jet from a single aircraft engine. The predicted values are in good agreement with the experimental data, and the distribution and regularity of shock wave, velocity, pressure and temperature of a single aircraft engine are got. The results show that SST k-w turbulence model is more suitable for the numerical simulation of compressible viscous gas jet with high prediction accuracy. Finally, the impact effect of gas jet from two aircraft engines on a <b>jet</b> <b>blast</b> deflector is analyzed based on the above numerical method, not only the flow parameters of gas jet and the interaction regularity between gas jet and the <b>jet</b> <b>blast</b> deflector are got, but also the thermal shock properties and dynamic impact characteristics of gas jet impacting the <b>jet</b> <b>blast</b> deflector are got. So the dangerous activity area of crew and equipments on the flight deck can be predicted qualitatively and quantitatively. The proposed research explores out a correct numerical method for the fluid–solid interaction during the impact process of supersonic gas jet, which provides an effective technical support for design, thermal ablation and structural damage analysis of a new <b>jet</b> <b>blast</b> deflector.|$|R

40|$|The aims of {{the study}} were to carry out a {{comparison}} of grit blasting and other surface pretreatment processes and identify the relation between grit blasting parameters and coating adhesion, because it can be assumed that the adhesion between substrate and coating strongly depends on the physical properties of the substrate surface. By this way, in order to improve the bonding between substrate and coating, it is necessary to study the influence of different surface pre-treatment parameters and to compare different pre-treatment techniques. Grit <b>blasting,</b> water <b>jet</b> <b>blasting</b> and mechanicals processes (milling and grinding) have been studied. In order to compare them, the roughness of the surface, the adhesive straights, the topography, the contact surface and the residual stresses have been the considered parameters to carry out the research. Two different substrates have been studied, AlMg 7 and St_ 42. For grit blasting, five different blasting parameters have been analyzed and combined to obtain reliable results, attack angle, air pressure, lineal velocity, number of passes, and distance between substrate and nozzle. After measuring the obtained values, the most influence parameters were recombined and analyzed to obtain better surface conditions. In the case of mechanicals processes (milling and grinding), the samples were studied for different mechanical parameters, analyzed and compared with the other surface pretreatments in order to obtain the most suitable method. For water <b>jet</b> <b>blasting,</b> eight samples were sent to WLH (University of Hannover) to be treated. To carry out the pretreatment, the velocity of the water <b>jet</b> <b>blasting</b> was modify while the other blasting parameters remained constant, in order to compare the obtained values of roughness, adhesion, activate area and residual stresses for water <b>jet</b> with grit <b>blasting</b> and mechanical processes. The next conclusions can be assumed: The roughness is not so important than the topography to obtain the best adhesive bonding between the substrate and the coating, and the best bonding was obtained for homogeneous topographies (obtained for water <b>jet</b> <b>blasting</b> and grit blasting). Comparing the surface pretreatments is observed that water <b>jet</b> <b>blasting</b> is the surface pretreatment method which leads to the highest bonding between substrate and coating. It can be assumed that a higher contact surface area leads to a better adhesion between substrate and coating. The residual stresses strongly depend on the surface pretreatment used. Grit blasting leads to the highest compressive stresses while water <b>jet</b> <b>blasting</b> almost does not cause variations and grinding obtains the same values than for a raw surface (untreated surface).

30|$|The {{high-temperature}} and high-speed gas jet from {{aircraft engines}} {{is in an}} over expansion state when the aircraft engines are in full afterburner state to takeoff, which has a serious impact on the flight deck due to the complicated physical phenomena such as shock wave, noise and gas tempering caused by the interaction between gas jet and the <b>jet</b> <b>blast</b> deflector [1, 2]. The gas jet from aircraft engines has basic characteristics of supersonic flow and complex wave system. When the gas jet impacts a <b>jet</b> <b>blast</b> deflector, the thermal shock and dynamic impact will lead to thermal ablation and structure damage.
