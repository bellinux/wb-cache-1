25|$|Adaptive Highbeam Assist is Mercedes-Benz' {{marketing}} {{name for}} a headlight control strategy that continuously automatically tailors the headlamp range so the beam just reaches other vehicles ahead, thus always ensuring maximum possible seeing range without glaring other road users. It was first launched in the Mercedes E-class in 2009. It provides a continuous range of <b>beam</b> <b>reach</b> from a low-aimed low beam to a high-aimed high beam, rather than the traditional binary choice between low and high beams.|$|E

50|$|A proa has one sail, {{and is thus}} a catboat, {{though it}} is rarely called a catboat. Both ends are alike, and the boat is sailed in either direction, {{but it has a}} fixed leeward side and a {{windward}} side. The boat is shunted from <b>beam</b> <b>reach</b> to <b>beam</b> <b>reach</b> to change direction, with the wind over the side, a low-force procedure. The bottom corner of the crabclaw sail is moved to the other end, which becomes the bow as the boat sets off back the way it came. The mast usually hinges, adjusting its rake (mast). The proa is a low-stress rig, which can be built with simple tools and low-tech materials, but it is extremely fast. On a <b>beam</b> <b>reach,</b> it may be the fastest simple rig.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} rationally analyze RC beams under {{consecutive}} impact loading, a numerical analysis method based on three-dimensional elasto-plastic {{finite element method}} is proposed. An applicability of the method is discussed following two impact tests of RC beams: 1) consecutive impact loading test up to RC <b>beam</b> <b>reaching</b> ultimate state setting 1 m/s of initial and incremental impact velocity; and 2) two-time impact loading test with impact velocity around RC <b>beams</b> <b>reaching</b> ultimate state.

5000|$|A [...] "broad reach" [...] is {{a course}} {{further away from}} the true wind than a <b>beam</b> <b>reach</b> but above a run. In a broad reach, the wind is coming from behind the sailing craft at an angle. This {{represents}} a range of wind angles between <b>beam</b> <b>reach</b> and running downwind. On a sailboat (but not an iceboat) the sails are eased out away from the sailing craft, {{but not as much}} as on a run or dead run (downwind run).

50|$|Boats with shorter, wider sails have lighter, {{shallower}} hulls. They may {{wait for}} a favourable wind to avoid sailing upwind. They may go faster than a high-aspect-ratio sailboat when not going upwind; for instance, crab-claws sail extremely well on a <b>beam</b> <b>reach.</b>|$|E
50|$|Formula boards have {{excellent}} upwind and downwind ability, {{but are not}} as comfortable on a <b>beam</b> <b>reach</b> unless fin sizes are reduced. This explains why the course is usually a box with longer upwind and downwind legs, or just a simple upwind-downwind return course.|$|E
