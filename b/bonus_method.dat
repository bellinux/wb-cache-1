I have implemented and tested four methods to maintain diversity in the population of a genetic algorithm by frequency dependent selection. With frequency dependent selection individuals with a rare trait are in the advantage of individuals without the rare trait. When the rare trait becomes common the advantage disappears. Frequency dependent selection is incorporated in the genetic algorithm by selecting individuals that {{are different from the}} average population more often than individuals that are less different and have the same fitness value. I tested 4 different methods, a <b>bonus</b> <b>method</b> based on frequency dependent selection in nature, the sharing method as proposed by Goldberg [12], double-objective diversity maintenance as used in genetic programming by de Jong [16], and the fitness uniform selector as proposed by Hutter [15].

40|$|During {{the last}} few decades, reduced energy consumption, {{increased}} energy efficiency and utilization of renewable energy have gained interest while different energy efficient energy conversion technologies have matured. Combined heat and power (CHP), which utilizes biomass, has been promoted {{as a mean to}} reduce dependency of fossil fuels, increase use of renewable energy, improve overall energy efficiency and reduce importation of fossil fuels both by the European Union (EU) and associated countries. Primary Energy (PE) and CO 2 equivalent emissions were selected as the most relevant parameters to describe the environmental impact of an energy system (EN 15603). This means that the energy supplied to a building shall be calculated as the sum of kWh energy used per energy carrier multiplied by the Primary Energy Factor (PEF) for each energy carrier. The Primary Energy Factor takes into account all the energy that is needed to deliver 1 kWh power and/or heat to the end user, while “CO 2 equivalents” refers to the equivalent effect of all greenhouse gases that is emitted from extraction to delivery expressed by a CO 2 -value. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has decided to make official the term “CO 2 equivalent,” which consists of emissions from CO 2, CH 4 and N 2 O. A model was developed for calculating Primary Energy and CO 2 emissions for heat from district heating grids from combined heat and power plants utilizing biological material as fuel. The model is based on energy calculations and Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methods. The embodied energy and CO 2 equivalents are calculated by LCA methods based on information from producers, contractors, district heating companies and the Ecoinvent database. The district heating grid, used in the case studies, is created from an average Norwegian district heating grid, with variable flow and temperatures {{in each of the four}} seasons: winter, spring/fall and summer. Heat is supplied to a district heating grid with different energy densities, where supply and return temperatures vary for each different season. Heat loss and the loss of head are calculated for each season as well. The part load efficiencies of the CHP-plants are calculated by SteamPro and GTPro. Usually, yearly average efficiencies are used in those calculations/standards. Therefore, this study examined the impact by utilization seasonal efficiencies instead of annual values in calculating PEF and CO 2 equivalents for the four different CHP-plants. Research in this field has typically utilized average values for fuel. This study applies the impact of both biogenic and biomass with variable moisture levels. The results demonstrate both the importance of detailed calculation and the need for a strict standardized calculation method. Utilization of different fuels will also have an additional impact on the efficiency of the CHP-plant and thereby the total PEF for heat delivered in a district heating system. In addition, allocation methods such as alternative production (instead of the power <b>bonus</b> <b>method)</b> will reduce the impact of exported power, thus promoting energy efficient systems and/or renewable energy systems with low CO 2 equivalent emissions. Furthermore, the study has shown the need for at least two different parameters/indicators describing the environmental impact of such allocation methods. Application of a combination of PEF and CO 2 equivalents will provide a better understanding and comparison of different energy systems. This PhD-work has been carried out as a part of the Nordic/Baltic PhD-project Primary Energy Efficiency (PEE), and was partly financed by Nordic Energy Research and partly from some leading Norwegian district heating companies.

40|$|A steady growing {{global demand}} for energy and rising {{greenhouse}} gas emissions has resulted in several initiatives from the European Union {{with the purpose of}} increasing energy efficiency. A part of this strategy is the introduction of energy performance certificates for buildings, containing a numerical primary energy indicator. Another instrument is to encourage an increased use of cogeneration. As a member of the European Economic Area agreement, these events also affect Norway. The main aim of the project was to investigate how various relevant parameters influence the primary energy factor of district heating when a combined heat and power (CHP) plant is the heat producing unit. The study was to be based on Norwegian conditions. To select relevant technologies, a mapping of existing and planned CHP facilities connected to district heating (DH) networks in Norway was carried out. The findings were that at present, there are nine steam cycle CHP plants connected to DH networks that are based on waste incineration, one steam cycle that is based on demolition wood and one reciprocating engine that is running on biogas. The installed electric capacity ranged from 0, 3 MW to 22, 8 MW and the annual district heating production from 1, 5 GWh to 196 GWh. Based on this, it was decided to study steam cycle CHP plants further. Three different sizes were chosen: 2 MWel, 10 MWel and 25 MWel. In addition, the situation in Europe was looked into. Here, steam cycle and combined cycle were found to be the two most dominant CHP technologies. To have a different technology to compare with, a combined cycle with 22, 7 MWel capacity was also included in the study. By running plant simulations, the effects of part load operation, various district heating supply and return temperatures and different fuel types were quantified. STEAM Pro was utilised to design the steam cycle models, while GT Pro was used to design the combined cycle models. STEAM Pro was also used to perform design simulations for different temperature levels in the DH network and to study the effect of different types of fuels. To be able to investigate the part load performance of the plants based on a given district heating demand, the models from STEAM Pro and GT Pro was imported into Thermoflex and modified. Reducing the DH supply temperature from 120 to 80 &# 176;C and the return temperature from 80 to 35 &# 176;C in the 10 MW steam cycle plant increased the power efficiency by 25 % and the power to heat ratio by 33 %, but the total efficiency was only slightly increased. Variation of fuel, on the other hand, influenced the power efficiency and the total efficiency almost equally, and the power to heat ratio was hence left relatively unaltered. The results from the simulations at the defined full load conditions showed that power efficiency was more than twice as high for the combined cycle than for the steam cycle plants, and the power to heat ratio was almost four times higher for the CC plant. The total efficiency was approximately 10 % lower for the combined cycle than for the steam cycles. Performance also varied between the different sizes of steam cycles, and both boiler type and turbine size influenced power efficiencies and power to heat ratios. In contrast, the total efficiencies were close to equal. Part load had a great influence on power efficiency and power to heat ratio for all technology types. Especially at very low load levels, the power efficiency was considerably reduced. The combined cycle experienced a total fall in power efficiency of 40 %, while the reduction varied from 60 % to only 29 % for the steam cycle plants. The part load total efficiency was only slightly reduced for all plants. Based on the part load simulations, annual efficiencies and power to heat ratios were calculated for different annual load distributions. The annual power to heat ratio and power efficiency was clearly influenced by changes in the annual load distribution pattern, while the effect was less notable for the annual total efficiencies. To calculate the primary energy factors, the total efficiency and power to heat ratio results from the CHP plant simulations were implemented in an excel tool developed by [16]. Some other modifications were also performed. The district heating primary energy factors (PEFDH) for the defined base case varied from 0, 85 for the Combined Cycle* alternative to 1, 4 for the 2 MW steam cycle plant. The base case was defined to have medium energy density(8 MWh/m). This was later found to not represent the actual Norwegian conditions, where the average energy density is closer to 4 MWh/m. When this energy density was used, the PEFDH for the 10 MW steam cycle plant increased 9, 4 %, from 1, 38 to 1, 51. This value is still considerably lower than the primary energy factor for the average electricity production in the Nordic countries, which is 2, 16. It was found that the combined heat and power plant parameters had a significant influence on the primary energy factors. The power to heat ratio was particularly important when the power <b>bonus</b> <b>method</b> was utilised. One main conclusion is therefore that {{it is important that the}} performance indicators that are used for the CHP plant are realistic, and takes into account technology type, part load performance and what load duration curve the plant is subject to. In most of the cases studied, the fuel handling process and the use of additives contributed most to the primary energy losses related to the PEFDH, while the sum of primary energy losses was dominated by the losses occurring in the CHP plant and the fuel handling. Nevertheless, what process and parameters that could potentially improve the PEFDH most depended on technology and choice of allocation method. In all cases studied, pump work related to circulating the DH water and energy consumption related to ash transport, construction and dismantling of the CHP plant and DH pipes were negligible or close to negligible. Heat loss became a considerably more dominant primary energy loss contributor when a low energy density was assumed. In the end, the calculation of primary energy factors involves many choices that influence the results. It is therefore important that the calculation method becomes more standardised. As it is today, some processes are optional, for instance the use of additives. In this study, the use of additives had a non-negligible influence on the results. Furthermore, the CHP simulation results underlined the importance of taking type of CHP technology and operational conditions into account when calculating primary energy factors for this kind of systems. According to NS-EN 15316 - 4 - 5, the power <b>bonus</b> <b>method</b> is the allocation method that should be utilised when calculating primary energy factors for district heating. This makes the district heating primary energy factors extremely dependent on power to heat ratio and the choice of PEF for avoided electricity. If the amount of avoided electricity production in fact is smaller than the full amount of CHP production or if the PEF of the avoided electricity is lower than what is assumed, this might lead to a severe underestimation of the PEFDH. The ultimate goal with the use of primary energy is to encourage more efficient energy use. It is therefore important that the issues mentioned in the two paragraphs above are further studied and discussed as a part of exploring how a standard method should be designed to face this challenge. </p...|$|E

40|$|Quartz {{extraction}} and purification from rocks, sediment, {{soil and}} dust samples {{is essential for}} the successful measurement of 10 Be and 26 Al by Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS). The common procedure used involves initial water washing to remove fines then Aqua Regia treatment followed by density separation using lithium silicon tungstate then magnetic separation and finally selective etching of powder samples by ultrasonic heating and agitation in a dilute aqueous (~ 2 % w/w) hydrofluoric acid solution (HF). This technique has proven adequate for quartz rich rock types (ie granite, quartzite). The etching method alone typically involves 4 - 5 cycles of HF 2 % etchings and the result is ~ 10 - 30 % mass loss. However for fine grained and or low quartz (non-felsic) bearing samples such as flint, silcrete, andesite, diorite) density and magnetic separation are inefficient. Furthermore, HF etching will readily dissolve fine quartz grains and thus severely affects yields. We have developed an alternative method using hot phosphoric acid (~ 250 °C), which preferentially dissolves silicates and many other minerals but not quartz. Differentiation of quartz from other minerals (e. g., feldspars, plagioclase) is excellent, density and magnetic separation is not required and usually fewer cycles are required than with conventional HF etching. Hence the hot phosphoric acid method is particularly effective on rocks containing fine grain quartz, e. g., greywacke, silcrete and chert, to enhance quartz recovery.

40|$|Abstract. One of {{the most}} {{fruitful}} ways to analyze the effects of discretization error in the numerical solution {{of a system of}} differential equations is to examine the “modified equations, ” which are equations that are exactly satisfied by the (approximate) discrete solution. These do not actually exist in general but rather are defined by an asymptotic expansion in powers of the discretization parameter. Nonetheless, if the expansion is suitably truncated, the resulting modified equations have a solution which is remarkably close to the discrete solution. In the case of a Hamiltonian system of ordinary differential equations, the modified equations are also Hamiltonian if and only if the integrator is symplectic. Evidence for the existence of a Hamiltonian for a particular calculation is obtained by calculating modified Hamiltonians and monitoring how well they are conserved. Also, energy drifts caused by numerical instability are better revealed by evaluating modified Hamiltonians. Doing this calculation would normally be complicated and highly dependent on the details of the method, even if differences are used to approximate derivatives. A relatively simple procedure is presented here, nearly independent of the internal structure of the integrator, for obtaining highly accurate estimates for modified Hamiltonians. As a <b>bonus</b> of the <b>method</b> of construction, the modified Hamiltonians are exactly conserved by a numerical solution {{in the case of a}} quadratic Hamiltonian...|$|R
40|$|A density bonus, {{also called}} {{incentive}} zoning, is a conditional liberalization of zoning regulations, allowing {{a real estate}} development to exceed as-of-right density limits {{in exchange for the}} in-kind provision or purchase of a public amenity, often affordable housing or public open space. I explore employing LEED certification, an increasingly well-known proxy for environmental quality, as the density bonus amenity. In theory, the idea is to link profitable real estate development with environmental sustainability. In practice, my primary interest is in the tradeoffs between the perceived burdens of greater density and the potential benefits of enhanced environmental quality. I begin by examining the economic, public policy, and legal underpinnings of the density bonus idea, followed by a consideration of <b>bonus</b> calibration <b>methods</b> in current use, and determine that none adequately accounts for the public's valuation of density bonus amenities. In response, I explore the applicability of public valuation methods employed in the fields of environmental and real estate economics, before turning to scholarship on public participation for guidance. In the second section, with the fundamentals of incentive zoning better defined, I add LEED to the mix. (cont.) Employing LEED as a bonus amenity/public benefit has the potential to yield, I argue, a closer alignment of the benefits and burdens of development by reducing the local, regional, and global environmental impacts of buildings. This promise, however, is realizable only with an appropriate deliberative process. To place my proposal in context, as well as introduce some of the many real world difficulties it would undoubtedly encounter, I examine a hypothetical LEED Density Bonus tailored to Boston's Fenway neighborhood and Boston's existing zoning and development review procedures. My specific target is the under-utilized, auto-oriented upper Boylston Street corridor, which has long been viewed as a planning challenge by the city and a burden by the adjacent Fenway neighborhood.

We investigate the behaviour of long-term returns of the UK total share return index by testing the common statistical properties for financial data, so-called “stylised facts”. We show that for the monthly U. K. share total return indices, the Gaussian return hypothesis is rejected in series of tests. The local distribution of the returns has higher kurtosis and heavier tails than the Gaussian. In addition, the returns series show significant nonlinear autocorrelation, extreme returns appear in clusters. The first long term asset model purposed in this thesis is the exponential L´evy model with non-Gaussian increment. We describe the Generalised Hyperbolic distributions with their subclasses. They are considered as candidate distributions for the increments of the driving L´evy processes. We estimate model parameters to the UK share gross total return index using two approaches, maximum likelihood (MLE) and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm. Statistical and graphical goodness-of-fit tests demonstrate that these L´evy driven models give more accurate fits to the historical equity index returns data. For the liability model we consider long term participating life insurance products specifically unitised with-profits contracts. The payouts of unitised with-profits policies are simulated {{under a variety of}} asset models driven by L´evy processes. At first a basic model policy is considered with limited insurer operations and no risk controls. We look into various risk measures of the maturity loss for the insurer xiii and compare the statistical properties for different non-Gaussian increment L´evy models. It is found that the classical Gaussian model substantially underestimates the risk measures in unitised with-profits policies. The L´evy driven models which have semi-heavy tailed increments are aggregate to normal distributions in the long run. Then we consider different retrospective bonus mechanisms by varying the participating rate and the smoothing period. As a comparison we use a <b>bonus</b> earning power <b>method</b> with deterministic projected maturity asset share and 25 percent terminal bonus cushion. We study the joint distributions of the maturity asset shares and guarantees under these two bonus mechanism. With similar risk measures, there are larger expected maturity guarantees under <b>bonus</b> earning power <b>method</b> than retrospective <b>bonus.</b> Declaring bonuses on a more frequent basis is then tested, which has the desired effect of reducing the risk measures when declaring monthly bonuses using bonus earning power mechanism. We make observations on two different investment strategies, a diversified investment strategy and a hedging based investment strategy. The former method tries to reduce the variance of the invest return distribution while the hedging investment strategy, on the other hand, narrows the left tail of the maturity loss distribution by paying an extra amount of expenses. Finally, the L´evy models are extended by using GARCH(1, 1) -m type volatility. Both maximum likelihood estimators and Bayesian estimators using Markov Chain Monte Carlo are presented. The statistical tests on the devolatilised data show that the GARCH model reduces the non-linear autocorrelation in the conditional return processes and furthermore improve the fitting of the asset models. Also, multi-variable models are considered. Stochastic bridges driven by L´evy processes are constructed while the yearly returns follow the Wilkie model.
