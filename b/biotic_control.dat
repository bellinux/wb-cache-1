40|$|To {{improve the}} {{coupling}} of in situ chemical oxidation and in situ bioremediation, {{a systematic analysis}} was performed {{of the effect of}} chemical oxidation with Fenton's reagent, modified Fenton's reagent, permanganate, or persulfate, on microbial diversity and activity during 8 weeks of incubation in two diesel-contaminated soils (peat and fill). Chemical oxidant and soil type affected the microbial community diversity and biodegradation activity; however, this was only observed following treatment with Fenton's reagent and modified Fenton's reagent, and in the <b>biotic</b> <b>control</b> without oxidation. Differences in the highest overall removal efficiencies of 69 % for peat (<b>biotic</b> <b>control)</b> and 59 % for fill (Fenton's reagent) were partially explained by changes in contaminant soil properties upon oxidation. Molecular analysis of 16 S rRNA and alkane monooxygenase (alkB) gene abundances indicated that oxidation with Fenton's reagent and modified Fenton's reagent negatively affected microbial abundance. However, regeneration occurred, and final relative alkB abundances were 1 – 2 orders of magnitude higher in chemically treated microcosms than in the <b>biotic</b> <b>control.</b> 16 S rRNA gene fragment fingerprinting with DGGE and prominent band sequencing illuminated microbial community composition and diversity differences between treatments and identified a variety of phylotypes within Alpha-, Beta-, and Gammaproteobacteria.

40|$|While in situ {{chemical}} oxidation {{is often}} used to remediate tetrachloroethene (PCE) contaminated locations, very little is known about its influence on microbial composition and organohalide respiration (OHR) activity. Here, we investigate the impact of oxidation with permanganate on OHR rates, the abundance of organohalide respiring bacteria (OHRB) and reductive dehalogenase (rdh) genes using quantitative PCR, and microbial community composition through sequencing of 16 S rRNA genes. A PCE degrading enrichment was repeatedly treated with low (25 µmol), medium (50 µmol), or high (100 µmol) permanganate doses, or no oxidant treatment (<b>biotic</b> <b>control).</b> Low and medium treatments led to higher OHR rates and enrichment of several OHRB and rdh genes, as compared to the <b>biotic</b> <b>control.</b> Improved degradation rates can be attributed to enrichment of (1) OHRB able to also utilize Mn oxides as a terminal electron acceptor and (2) non-dechlorinating community members of the Clostridiales and Deltaproteobacteria possibly supporting OHRB by providing essential co-factors. In contrast, high permanganate treatment disrupted dechlorination beyond cis-dichloroethene and caused at least a 2 – 4 orders of magnitude reduction in the abundance of all measured OHRB and rdh genes, as compared to the <b>biotic</b> <b>control.</b> High permanganate treatments resulted in a notably divergent microbial community, with increased abundances of organisms affiliated with Campylobacterales and Oceanospirillales capable of dissimilatory Mn reduction, and decreased abundance of presumed supporters of OHRB. Although OTUs classified within the OHR-supportive order Clostridiales and OHRB increased in abundance over the course of 213 days following the final 100 µmol permanganate treatment, only limited regeneration of PCE dechlorination was observed in one of three microcosms, suggesting strong chemical oxidation treatments can irreversibly disrupt OHR. Overall, this detailed investigation into dose-dependent changes of microbial composition and activity due to permanganate treatment provides insight into the mechanisms of OHR stimulation or disruption upon chemical oxidatio...|$|E

A wide number of microbial species {{are able to}} ferment carbohydrates, but a high microbial diversity is often detrimental to bioprocess operation since it leads to process instability. To date, only few controllers, essentially physicochemical, are available to control finely the multiplicity of bacterial metabolisms in mixed cultures.

One possibility would be to engineer ecologically these communities to better control the metabolic networking.

First some keystone species, often low in abundance but having a major role on metabolic networks, were identified from several natural ecosystems. Different strategies of <b>biotic</b> <b>control</b> of the fermentative microbial communities were then investigated, confirming the important role of these species and the possibility of using them as biotic controllers of the overall community. Artificial co-cultures were also carried out, and a specific type of interaction was characterized.

40|$|We use multivariate {{statistics}} {{to examine the}} continental-scale patterns of the stable carbon isotopic composition (δ 13 C) of soil organic carbon (SOC) from a data set collected throughout the natural range of variation in climatic, edaphic and <b>biotic</b> <b>controls</b> in Australia. Climate and soil texture (percent of mineral particles < 63 μm) {{are found to be}} the dominant controls on δ 13 CSOC. Of the environmental variables analysed, the strongest correlations to δ 13 CSOC do not simply occur with respect to mean annual temperature or precipitation, but rather to ecosystem-scale measures of water availability such as mean annual vapour pressure deficit (VPD) and an index of the annual flux of available water available to plants (W). After the variance of δ 13 CSOC attributed to W was removed, the proportion of particles ≤ 63 μm diameter remained the only secondarily significant correlation (p < 0. 05). Based on this observation, we also develop a model of the primary climatic control on δ 13 CSOC, which is rooted in the assumption of optimized water-use efficiency of C 3 and C 4 vegetation, and can be extrapolated to continental or global data with readily available environmental data. The model describes optimized water-use efficiency controls on δ 13 CSOC in terms of a function of the variable W. We estimate model parameters of climatic control on δ 13 CSOC using an analysis of surface samples (0 – 5 cm) of sandy soils (< 10 % mineral particles ≤ 63 μm diameter) from which other edaphic and <b>biotic</b> <b>controls</b> are minimized. This simple model function is modified to account for variation of δ 13 CSOC due to variation of respiration rates and variable incorporation of the terrestrial Suess effect with mean annual temperature (MAT). Model regression of δ 13 CSOC to these continental-scale climate data accounts for 92 % of the variance observed using a model function with simple variables (W and MAT) and physically meaningful constants. We also examine edaphic controls on δ 13 CSOC using particle size separates from soil textural gradients within four climatic zones of Australia. These data indicate the protection of 13 C-enriched old, stable SOC in association with fine mineral particles, consistent with variable incorporation of the terrestrial Suess effect...|$|R
40|$|Changes in mammal faunal {{complexes}} {{over time}} {{have often been}} considered the result of bioevents linked to major climatic changes though some authors claimed that environmental factors such as impacts, eruptions, and climatic change have a minimal effect, and intrinsic <b>biotic</b> <b>controls</b> may be essential in affecting taxonomic diversity and changing community structure. To contribute to the debate, Italian faunal complexes (FCs) have been analysed in order to correlate diversity trends and structural dynamics with the extensive Middle Pliocene to Late Pleistocene environmental changes. Three main aspects have been considered for exploring the palaeoclimatic significance of faunal evolutionary changes: shifts in diversity; shifts in origination/immigration and extinction rates (turnover, dispersal, extinction phases); shifts in relative abundance of ecological categories defined herein. Two major structural reconstructions occurred in the FCs at the early/middle Villafranchian transition (from the Middle to the Late Pliocene, around 2. 6 Ma) and from the early to middle Galerian (from the Early to the Middle Pleistocene, i. e., from about 1. 2 to 0. 7 Ma). The Villafranchian turnover phase corresponds to the Middle Pliocene climate deterioration, and {{can be considered a}} starting point for the Late Pliocene dispersal phases. The Early to Middle Pleistocene turnover represents the major reorganization (dispersal and successive turnover) in the large mammal complexes of the Italian peninsula, and occurred in successive phases during the period of palaeoenvironmental changes at the onset of 100 ka climate cyclicity. Accordingly, {{the results of this study}} confirm that the most important renewals in the Italian large mammalian faunas (due both to originations/immigrations and extinctions) are connected to major global climatic changes. Nonetheless, there is no or minor evidence of cyclical, climatically-driven turnovers matching “glacial/interglacial” alternations. The Late Villafranchian (latest Pliocene and Early Pleistocene partim) and middle/late Galerian FCs (early Middle Pleistocene), for instance, present only minor phyletic adjustments and their evolutionary patterns support a model of protracted minor faunal change which seems driven by more complex forcing factors rather than climate alone. All in all, patterns of Italian faunal complexes indicate that climatic changes act in driving faunal structural changes in a rather complex way and intrinsic <b>biotic</b> <b>controls</b> may also be essential in determining faunal complex evolution: major climate change (changes of climate cyclicity), via migrations and dispersal events, allowed diversity to increase and altered palaeocommunity equilibria, leading to new intra- and inter-guild dynamics. The new internal competition caused the disappearances of some species through time and led to a new equilibrium within reconstructed FCs. The results obtained indicate that, at least in Italy, climatic changes are a forcing factor, especially in large mammal first appearances, whereas the global reconstruction of the structure of the FCs has been also influenced by the internal dynamics, not necessarily predicting strict dependence on major climatic changes...|$|R

Expanding P studies to soils may augment the understanding of P biogeochemistry and habitat suitability in this extreme environment. Our objectives were to examine P fractionation in Antarctic Dry Valley soils and sediments and compare their relationship to other soil biogeochemical data. Samples were obtained along transects perpendicular to the Harnish and Priscu streams in Lake Fryxell and Lake Bonney basins, respectively. We utilized a sequential inorganic P extraction procedure, analyzing {{for a series of}} labile through resistant P fractions. We further analyzed soils for labile organic P and biomass P. Results showed the amount of inorganic P increased from soluble to Ca-bound P at both sites, with greater weathering of P-bearing minerals at the Fryxell site inferred from the greater P levels found in most fractions as compared with the Bonney site. Fryxell site soluble P findings correlated positively with the Al-bound phase, possibly facilitating P availability to microfauna. The P fraction distribution at both the Fryxell and Bonney sites fits the general relationship between weathering intensity and P distribution of other arid ecosystems.

By increasing NaCl concentrations from 0 g/liter to 40 g/liter, defluorination efficiency decreased around 40 % in the BES, and in the BC it was completely ceased. p-FNB was mineralized by 30 % in the BES and hardly in the BC. Microorganisms were able to store 3. 8 and 0. 7 times more K+ and Na+ intracellularly in the BES than in the BC.

The great biodiversity inhabiting olive agroecosystem lead to a <b>biotic</b> <b>control</b> of many pest species.

The side effects of compounds allowed against the olive fly in open field are still little known as well as the agronomical methods for mitigating them. The aims of this research were to evaluate the impact of compounds allowed in organic olive farming and searching for more ecocompatible farming strategies. The research was carried out in Southern Italy. Experimental olive grove were untilled, and the grass cover was periodically managed. Six theses composed by 200 plants were randomly chosen and sprayed with rotenone, kaolin, a mixture of copper oxychloride and propolis, and dimethoate. Due to different actions of active agents involved in this research, arthropods were sampled at canopy and soil levels.

While many studies have shed light on the physico-chemical cues affecting specific processes, (micro) <b>biotic</b> <b>controls</b> and interactions potentially steering microbial communities leading to altered functioning are less known. Yet, recent accumulating evidence suggests that the concerted actions of a community can be significantly different from the combined effects of individual microorganisms, giving rise to emergent properties. Here, we exemplify the importance of microbial interaction for ecosystem processes by analysis of a reasonably well-understood microbial guild, namely, aerobic methane-oxidizing bacteria (MOB). We reviewed the literature which provided compelling evidence for the relevance of microbial interaction in modulating methane oxidation. Support for microbial associations within methane-fed communities is sought by a re-analysis of literature data derived from stable isotope probing studies of various complex environmental settings. Putative positive interactions between active MOB and other microbes were assessed by a correlation network-based analysis with datasets covering diverse environments where closely interacting members of a consortium can potentially alter the methane oxidation activity.

The study was conducted in young (YS), mature (MS), and old stands (OS) over 4 years at the AmeriFlux Metolius sites. Model simulations showed that interannual variation of GPP did not follow the same trends as precipitation, and effects of climatic variation were smallest at the OS (50 %), and intermediate at the YS (< 20 %). In the young, developing stand, interannual variation in leaf area has larger effects on fluxes than climate, although leaf area is a function of climate in that climate can interact with age-related shifts in carbon allocation and affect whole-tree hydraulic conductance. Older forests, with well-established root systems, appear to be better buffered from effects of seasonal drought and interannual climatic variation. Interannual variation of net ecosystem exchange (NEE) was also lowest at the OS, where NEE is controlled more by interannual variation of ecosystem respiration, 70 % of which is from soil, than by the variation of GPP, whereas variation in GPP is the primary reason for interannual changes in NEE at the YS and MS. Across spatially heterogeneous landscapes with high frequency of younger stands resulting from natural and anthropogenic disturbances, interannual climatic variation and change in leaf area are likely to result in large interannual variation in GPP and NEE...|$|R
40|$|Consumer-producer {{dynamics}} {{are critical}} for ecosystem functioning. In marine environments, primary production is often subject to strong consumer control, and on coral reefs, the grazing pressure exerted by herbivorous fishes {{has been identified as}} a major determinant of benthic community structure. Using experimental surfaces, we demonstrate that on coral reefs, microtopographic refuges decrease the overall grazing pressure by more than one order of magnitude. Furthermore, by functionally characterizing consumer communities, we show that refuges also restrict grazer communities to only one functional group, algal croppers, which selectively remove the apical parts of algae. In contrast, detritivorous fishes, which intensively graze flat and exposed microhabitats and can remove both particulate matter and entire stands of algal filaments, are almost entirely excluded. This preclusion of an entire ecosystem process (the removal of particulates) results in two distinct coexisting benthic regimes: communities within refuges are diverse and characterized by numerous algal types and juvenile scleractinian corals, while communities outside refuges support only low-diversity assemblages dominated by simple, unbranched filamentous turf algal mats. Although limited to the scale of a few centimeters, microtopographic refuges can, therefore, mediate the <b>biotic</b> <b>control</b> of community development by affecting both overall grazing rates and the functional diversity of consumer communities. We suggest that the coexistence of two distinct benthic regimes at a small spatial scale may be an important factor for ecosystem functioning and highlight the need to consider the ecological complexity of consumer-producer dynamics when assessing the status of coral reef ecosystems...|$|E

Prokaryotic abundance below 100 m declined with depth at all the stations, while decreasing trends with depth in prokaryotic heterotrophic activity were present only at 2 out of the 5 stations. Bacterial community composition (BCC), determined using both automated rRNA intergenic spacer analysis and terminal-restriction-fragment length polymorphism, was also related to depth {{although the number of}} operational taxonomic units was remarkably constant throughout the water column. Overall, the maximums in similarity values of the BCC between water sample pairs decreased with increasing temperature-salinity (T-S) distance of the water samples probably due to distinct biogeochemical characteristics of water masses. However, considerable dissimilarity in the BCC between samples with identical T-S values, and hence within the same water mass, was also observed, possibly reflecting heterogeneity in the organic matter field or in <b>biotic</b> <b>control</b> within a given water body.

Pioneer plant species that colonize these ecosystems at the land–water interface have developed specific traits {{in response to}} environmental constraints (response traits) {{and are able to}} modify habitat conditions by modulating geomorphic processes (effect traits). Changes in the geomorphic environment under the control of engineer plants often feed back to organism traits (feedback traits), and thereby ecosystem functioning, leading to eco-evolutionary dynamics.

All the physico-chemical and biological parameters determined were within the range or somewhat higher (in the case of phytoplankton abundance and biomass) than reported for other large streams. The underwater light conditions resulting from atypically short phytoplankton growth periods of about 6 months per year and the low phytoplankton carbon to chl a ratio of 23 were identified as a major limiting factor for phytoplankton development in the River Elbe. The seasonal distribution pattern of bacterioplankton indicated probable tight trophodynamical coupling both with phytoplankton and with heterotrophic flagellates, whereas heterotrophic flagellates showed a more trophic link with bacterial densities. Although approximately constant DOC and DON levels throughout the year sustained bacterial growth rates, during the phytoplankton growing season an increase of bacterial standing stocks was observed.

Nevertheless, despite accelerated climate and vegetation change in this ecosystem, the growth responses of peatland plant species to combined warming and vegetation change are unknown.

Warming was accomplished using open top chambers, which raised air temperature by approximately 0. 35 °C, and we measured air and soil microclimate as potential mechanisms through which both experimental factors could influence growth. We found that only Calluna growth increased with experimental warming (by 20 %), whereas the presence of dwarf-shrubs and bryophytes increased growth of Sphagnum (46 %) and Eriophorum (20 %), respectively. Sphagnum growth was also negatively related to soil temperature, which was lower when dwarf-shrubs were present. Dwarf-shrubs may therefore promote Sphagnum growth by cooling the peat surface. Conversely, the effect of bryophyte presence on Eriophorum growth was not related to any change in microclimate, suggesting other factors play a role.

Bulk soil, burrow linings and earthworm casts were incubated with 13 C-atrazine. The pollutant degradation was quantified by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry for 8 days, whereas active atrazine degraders were identified at 2 and 8 days by sequencing the 16 S ribosomal RNA in the 13 C-RNA fractions from the three soil microsites. An original diversity of atrazine degraders was found. Earthworm soil engineering greatly modified the taxonomic composition of atrazine degraders with dominance of a-, b- and c-proteobacteria in burrow linings and of Actinobacteria in casts. Earthworm soil bioturbation increased the c-diversity of atrazine degraders over the soil microsites generated. Atrazine degradation was enhanced in burrow linings in which primary atrazine degraders, closely related to Pelomonas aquatica, were detected only 2 days after atrazine addition. Atrazine degradation efficiency was not linearly related to the species richness of degraders but likely relied on keystone species.

Changes in the geomorphic environment under the control of engineer plants often feed back to organism traits (feedback traits), and thereby ecosystem functioning, leading to eco-evolutionary dynamics. Here we explain the joint foundations of fluvial and coastal ecosystems according to feedback between plants and the geomorphic environment. Location Dynamic fluvial and coastal ecosystems world-wide. Method Drawing from a pre-existing model of ‘fluvial biogeomorphic succession’, we propose a conceptual framework showing that fluvial and coastal ‘biogeomorphic ecosystems’ are functionally similar due to eco-evolutionary feedbacks between plants and geomorphology. Results The relationships between plant traits and their geomorphic environments within different fluvial and coastal biogeomorphic ecosystems are identified and classified within a framework of biogeomorphic functional similarity according to three criteria: (1) pioneer plants develop specific responses to the geomorphic environment; (2) engineer plants modulate the geomorphic environment; (3) geomorphic changes under <b>biotic</b> <b>control</b> within biogeomorphic ecosystems feed back to organisms. Main conclusions The conceptual framework of functional similarity proposed here will improve our capacity to analyse, compare, manage and restore fluvial and coastal biogeomorphic ecosystems world-wide by using the same protocols based on the three criteria and four phases of the biogeomorphic succession model...|$|E

To understand these interactions better, we used RNA-based stable-isotope probing to study the diversity of active atrazine-degrading bacteria in relation to atrazine degradation and to explore the impact of earthworm-soil engineering {{with respect to this}} relationship. Bulk soil, burrow linings and earthworm casts were incubated with 13 C-atrazine. The pollutant degradation was quantified by liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry for 8 days, whereas active atrazine degraders were identified at 2 and 8 days by sequencing the 16 S ribosomal RNA in the 13 C-RNA fractions from the three soil microsites. An original diversity of atrazine degraders was found. Earthworm soil engineering greatly modified the taxonomic composition of atrazine degraders with dominance of α-, β- and γ-proteobacteria in burrow linings and of Actinobacteria in casts. Earthworm soil bioturbation increased the γ-diversity of atrazine degraders over the soil microsites generated. Atrazine degradation was enhanced in burrow linings in which primary atrazine degraders, closely related to Pelomonas aquatica, were detected only 2 days after atrazine addition. Atrazine degradation efficiency was not linearly related to the species richness of degraders but likely relied on keystone species. By enhancing soil heterogeneity, earthworms sustained high phylogenetic bacterial diversity and exerted a <b>biotic</b> <b>control</b> on the bacterial diversity–function relationships. Our findings call for future investigations to assess the ecological significance of biotic controls on the relationships between diversity and function on ecosystem properties and services (for example, soil detoxification) at larger scales...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Sediment influx {{to channel}} {{networks}} is stochastically driven by rainstorms and other perturbations, which are discrete {{in time and}} space and which occur on a landscape with its own spatial variability in topography, colluvium properties, and state of recovery from previous disturbances. The resulting stochastic field of sediment supply interacts with the topology of the channel network and with transport processes to generate spatial and temporal patterns of flux and storage that characterize the sedimentation regime of a drainage basin. The regime varies systematically with basin area. We describe how the stochastic sediment supply is generated by climatic, topographic, geotechnical, and <b>biotic</b> <b>controls</b> that vary between regions. The general principle is illustrated through application to a landscape where sediment is supplied by mass wasting, and the forcing variables are deterministic thickening of colluvium, random sequences of root-destroying wildfires, and random sequences of rainstorms that trigger failure in a population of landslide source areas with spatial variance in topography and colluvium strength. Landslides stop in channels or convert to scouring debris flows, depending {{on the nature of the}} low-order channel network. Sediment accumulates within these channels for centuries before being transferred downstream by debris flows. Time series of sediment supply, transport, and storage vary with basin scale for any combination of climatic, topographic, and geotechnical controls. In a companion paper [Benda and Dunne, this issue] we use simulations of timing, volumes, and locations of mass wasting to study the interaction between a stochastically forced sediment supply and systematic changes of storage and flux through channel networks. 1...|$|R
40|$|Grazing by reef fishes {{is among}} the most {{important}} <b>biotic</b> factors <b>controlling</b> the structure of benthic communities in coral reefs and tropical rocky shores (e. g., HIXON, 1983). Exclusion experiments have widely demonstrated that fish grazing is a key factor determining algal abundance, with direct and indirect effects on corals and other competing benthic organisms (e. g., SAMMARCO, 1983; LEWIS, 1986; HUGUES et al., 2007). Grazer exclusion reduces the resilience of coral reefs in face of disturbances such as hurricanes, bleaching events, and climate change (HUGUES et al., 2007; MUMBY, 2009). Underwater observations and palatability, caging and transplantation experiments indicate that grazing by reef fish also has strong influence on the abundance, distribution and shape of sponges (PAWLIK, 1998...|$|R
40|$|Nitrogen (N) cycling in {{drylands}} under changing {{climate is}} not well understood. Our understanding of N cycling over larger scales to date relies heavily on the measurement of bulk soil N, and the information about internal soil N transformations remains limited. The 15 N natural abundance (δ 15 N) of ammonium and nitrate {{can serve as a}} proxy record for the N processes in soils. To better understand the patterns and mechanisms of N cycling in drylands, we collected soils along a 3200  km transect at about 100  km intervals in northern China, with mean annual precipitation (MAP) ranging from 36 to 436  mm. We analyzed N pools and δ 15 N of ammonium, dual isotopes (15 N and 18 O) of nitrate, and the microbial gene abundance associated with soil N transformations. We found that N status and its driving factors were different above and below a MAP threshold of 100  mm. In the arid zone with MAP below 100  mm, soil inorganic N accumulated, with a large fraction being of atmospheric origin, and ammonia volatilization was strong in soils with high pH. In addition, the abundance of microbial genes associated with soil N transformations was low. In the semiarid zone with MAP above 100  mm, soil inorganic N concentrations were low and were controlled mainly by biological processes (e. g., plant uptake and denitrification). The preference for soil ammonium over nitrate by the dominant plant species may enhance the possibility of soil nitrate losses via denitrification. Overall, our study suggests that a shift from abiotic to <b>biotic</b> <b>controls</b> on soil N biogeochemistry under global climate changes would greatly affect N losses, soil N availability, and other N transformation processes in these drylands in China...|$|R

We tested the role of abiotic and biotic factors that potentially influence spatial gradients of total ion content, acidity, carbon, total nitrogen, and total phosphorous in topsoil. We studied a network of Mediterranean montane meadows that spans a 2000 -m altitudinal gradient. The analyzed factors were grouped into two spatial scales: a landscape scale (climate and land form) and a field scale (topography, soil texture, soil moisture, and plant community composition). Total ion content and acidity are the major and independent variation trends of soil geochemistry. Soil acidity, carbon, and nitrogen increased along the altitudinal gradient whereas there was no relationship between total ion content and phosphorous and elevation. Climate had no direct influence on the analyzed gradients; all effects of climate were indirect through plant community composition and/or soil moisture. The results point to three types of models that explain the gradients of soil chemical composition: (1) a predominantly <b>biotic</b> <b>control</b> of carbon and nitrogen, (2) a predominantly abiotic control of acidity, and (3) a combined biotic and abiotic control of total ionic content. No direct or indirect effects explained the gradient of phosphorous. In our study region (central Spain), climate is predicted to turn more arid and soils will lose moisture. According to our models, this will result in less acid and fertile soils, and any change in plant community composition will modify gradients of soil carbon, nitrogen, total ion content, and acidity...|$|E
40|$|Remediation with in situ {{chemical}} oxidation (ISCO) impacts soil {{organic matter}} (SOM) and the microbial community, with deleterious effects on the latter being a major hurdle to coupling ISCO with in situ bioremediation (ISB). We investigate treatment of a diesel-contaminated soil with Fenton’s reagent and modified Fenton’s reagent coupled with a subsequent bioremediation phase of 187 d, both with and without nutrient amendment. Chemical oxidation mobilized SOM into the liquid phase, producing dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations 8 – 16 {{times higher than the}} untreated field sample. Higher aqueous concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorous species were also observed following oxidation; increased 14 – 172 times. During the bioremediation phase, dissolved carbon and nutrient species were utilized for microbial growth-yielding DOC concentrations similar to field sample levels within 56 d of incubation. In the absence of nutrient amendment, the highest microbial respiration rates were correlated with higher availability of nitrogen and phosphorus species mobilized by oxidation. Significant diesel degradation was only observed following nutrient amendment, implying that nutrients mobilized by chemical oxidation can increase microbial activity but are insufficient for bioremediation. While all bioremediation occurred in the first 28 d of incubation in the <b>biotic</b> <b>control</b> microcosm with nutrient amendment, biodegradation continued throughout 187 d of incubation following chemical oxidation, suggesting that chemical treatment also affects the desorption of organic contaminants from SOM. Overall, results indicate that biodegradation of DOC, as an alternative substrate to diesel, and biological utilization of mobilized nutrients have implications for the success of coupled ISCO and ISB treatments...|$|E
40|$|Abstract This work {{studied the}} {{behavior}} and seasonality of evapotranspiration influenced by biotic and abiotic factors through analysis of diurnal variation of aerodynamic resistance (ra), stomatal resistance (rs) and decoupling factor (&# 937;). This index was proposed by Jarvis and McNaughton (1986) as an indicative of the control of these resistances on the evapotranspiration of vegetation. Selection of representative data from wet and dry seasons from a primary forest in Central Amazonia and a primary forest and a pasture sites in Southwestern Amazonia had shown that: (i) rais about 20 s. m- 1 in both forests in both seasons, and ranges from 70 to 100 s. m- 1 in the pasture site; (ii) rsvaries both throughout the day and seasonally, with medians increasing from 40 in the morning, to 150 s. m- 1 in late afternoon, in the wet season in the forests and from 50 to 160 s. m- 1 in the pasture. These values increase in the dry season, with the forests rsranging from 50 up to 500 s. m- 1 and pasture rsstarting from 140 s. m- 1 and reaching {{up to more than}} 1800 s. m- 1 in the dry afternoons; (iii) &# 937; ranges from 0. 5 to 0. 8 during the wet season, and reduces to values below 0. 5 in the afternoons during the dry season, indicating that, although a strong influence of net radiation in the evaporative loss is present, to a large extent the evapotranspiration fluxes are coupled to the <b>biotic</b> <b>control</b> of stomatal closure in the vegetation, especially in the pasture and during dry periods...|$|E

We studied the plant-and-soil interaction in a mixed Mediterranean forest where several drought events since 1990 ’s have resulted in Scots pine defoliation and mortality, with a subsequent replacement by Holm oak (HO). The study focused on how this die-off and species replacement affected soil respiration (SR) and its heterotrophic and autotrophic components. It dealt with SR dependency on abiotic and <b>biotic</b> <b>controls</b> (i. e. soil temperature and moisture, photosynthetic activity, forest structure, litter inputs on soil, fine roots biomass) at different temporal and spatial scales. The study also determined rates of litter decomposition (both leaves and fine roots) along the die-off process. Soil temperature and moisture strongly regulated temporal variability of SR (from daily to seasonal), including both autotrophic and heterotrophic components. Plant activity exerted strong control over temporal variability of SR, with higher influence on living pines at daily time scales but stronger effect on HO at seasonal scale. SR and its components remained apparently unaffected by drought-induced Scots pine die-off denoting a high functional resilience of the studied plant-and-soil system. This functional resilience of SR {{was the result of}} colonization by HO of the gaps created by the dead of pines. Additionally, litter decomposition rates, specific root respiration, plant activity and soil bacterial communities compared between living pines, dead pines and HO also supported the role of HO rhizosphere colonization on below-ground functioning resilience.

40|$|Oceanic {{phytoplankton}} {{communities are}} {{a mixture of}} various algal functional groups, {{all of which are}} of different sizes, have variable physiologies, and interact differently with disparate herbivores. We suggest that polar plankton communities, and specifically the larger phytoplankton of Southern Ocean HNLC (high nutrient, low chlorophyll) systems, are controlled primarily by bottom-up processes, but that smaller (pico- and nanoplankton) reach an equilibrium that is set simultaneously by light, iron and grazing by microzooplankton. Thus Southern Ocean phytoplankton conforms to the “ecumenical iron hypothesis”, albeit with the further addition of light as an environmental control. Examples of bottom-up controls include iron availability, irradiance regulation (either by the incident surface irradiance as controlled by season and sea ice cover, or by the effects of vertical turbulence and mixed layer depths), and macronutrient availability (silicic acid and nitrate). While the contribution of various phytoplankton taxa varies spatially and temporally within the Antarctic, we suggest that this is largely due to the specific responses of the important functional groups to the patterns of physical forcing and micronutrient inputs, rather than to changes in controls by small and large grazers. Examples of abiotic and <b>biotic</b> <b>controls</b> are examined from representative regions of the Antarctic, including continental shelf regions and open ocean HNLC systems. Results from models further support our contention that bottom-up control of large forms is paramount in the Southern Ocean, but top-down controls play an important part in regulating the equilibrium standing stocks of smaller taxa. If bottom-up control is indeed universal in the Antarctic, then it has profound implications for the understanding of interannual variability, food web structure, and population dynamics of higher trophic levels in both the present and past Southern Ocean. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedThe Role of the Southern Ocean in Global Processes: an Earth System Science Approach...|$|R
