As {{has been done by}} TCEQ, it is useful to consider the daily ozone levels in a particular area as being the sum of two quantities: the <b>background</b> <b>ozone</b> and the local contribution. (page 10) 2. The <b>background</b> <b>ozone</b> is defined as the ozone level that would be attained if there were no local anthropogenic (or unusual biogenic) emissions of ozone precursors. (page 10) 3. The local contribution is the difference between the 8 -hour maximum <b>background</b> <b>ozone</b> and the 8 -hour maximum actual ozone. (page 10) From Chapter 2 : 4. The lowest 8 -hour maximum cannot be taken to be the <b>background</b> <b>ozone</b> level in Dallas-Fort Worth (DFW) or Houston-Galveston-Brazoria (HGA) because the lowest maximum is often found in the urban core or other sites affected by local emissions. (page 13) 5. A particular limited set of stations, assumed to be measuring pristine ozone under appropriate wind conditions, is used in DFW and HGA for estimating the <b>background</b> <b>ozone</b> in those two areas. (page 13 - 14) 6. Individual stations within the limited set typically, but not always, record the lowest 8 -hour ozone when the wind blows from the station toward the metropolitan area. (page 15 - 19) 7. Other regions had few monitors, so none were excluded. (page 15) 8 -Hour, Part I Page 4 of 52 1 / 29 / 05 From Chapter 3 : 8. Taking DFW as an example, there is year-to-year variability in the timing and magnitude of peaks of <b>background</b> <b>ozone,</b> but its interannual variability is sufficiently small that a multi-year average is an appropriate measure of typical conditions. (page 19) 9. Day-to-day variability of <b>background</b> <b>ozone</b> can be a factor of two or more, especially during late summer and early fall. (page 20) 10. There is relatively little variability of <b>background</b> <b>ozone</b> during the winter and during occasional periods in the early summer. (page 20) 11. The regular annual variation is a fundamental component of <b>background</b> <b>ozone.</b> (page 20) 12. All regions of eastern Texas have the same basic pattern of annual variation of <b>background</b> <b>ozone.</b> <b>Background</b> <b>ozone</b> is low in December but starts rising steadily in mid-January. A secondary maximum of <b>background</b> <b>ozone</b> is reached in mid-May, followed by a period with lower ozone values. The overall maximum in each region occurs in August or September, followed by a decline through the fall. (page 21 - 22) 13. Northeast Texas (NETX) appears to have the highest <b>background</b> <b>ozone</b> concentrations through the year. (page 22) 14. Differences in <b>background</b> <b>ozone</b> between NETX and DFW suggest that, because of sampling problems, absolute <b>background</b> <b>ozone</b> levels cannot be compared between regions with many sensors and regions with few sensors. (page 22) 15. DFW reaches a relative minimum in <b>background</b> <b>ozone</b> around the end of June and an absolute maximum in late August, while HGA reaches a relative minimum in early July and an absolute maximum in mid-September. (page 23) 16. The decline in ozone during the summer is largest in the southern regions and smallest in the northern regions. (page 23) 17. <b>Background</b> <b>ozone</b> levels as computed by the present method are suspiciously low at Beaumont-Port Arthur, suggesting that the sampling network has local source issues. (page 23) 8 -Hour, Part I Page 5 of 52 1 / 29 / 05 18. The local contribution at DFW makes up {{less than a third of}} the total 8 -hour ozome maximum on average days. (page 24) 19. The local contributions at DFW and HGA peak in July and August. (page 24 - 25) 20. The local contribution at HGA is generally a greater percentage of the total ozone than at DFW and reaches an average value of 0. 035 ppmv in August. (page 25) 21. The local contribution at HGA averages 0. 010 ppmv greater than at DFW, while the background at HGA averages 0. 010 ppmv less than at DFW, leading to similar mean 8 -h ozone levels. (page 25) 22. <b>Background</b> <b>ozone</b> levels at HGA and DFW correlate most strongly with the wind direction (and component from the north) on the previous day, with slightly lower but still highly significant correlations on the same day and two days previous. (page 26) 23. Also contributing to <b>background</b> <b>ozone</b> are weak winds at HGA and a lack of precipitation at DFW. (page 27) 24. The local contribution at DFW and HGA is positively correlated with high temperatures, low wind speeds, and a lack of precipitation. (page 27) 25. On days without precipitation, the average 8 -h maximum ozone in HGA in early September exceeds the 8 -h standard. Ozone in DFW comes close. (page 28) From Chapter 4 : 26. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is useful for representing the large-scale winds, which may be expected to strongly control <b>background</b> <b>ozone,</b> as a small number of continuously-varying patterns. (page 30) 27. Mean ozone-season winds are from the southeast in the HGA area and from the south in the DFW area, rotating clockwise around a center of high pressure in the southeastern United States. (page 31) 28. The leading principal component (PC 1), which explains the greatest amount of variability in the wind pattern, represents winds from the southwest (if positive) or northeast (if negative). It therefore is an indicator of the presence (or absence, if positive) of transport from the central and eastern United States. (page 31) 8 -Hour, Part I Page 6 of 52 1 / 29 / 05 29. The second principal component (PC 2) is positive with winds from the northwest. (page 31 - 32) 30. The total wind on any given day is the sum of the mean wind and the daily amplitudes of the various principal components. (page 33) From Chapter 5 : 31. The principal component most strongly correlated with <b>background</b> <b>ozone</b> is PC 1, followed by PC 5 and PC 2. (page 37) 32. The correlations are strongest with the wind pattern one day before the ozone event. (page 37) 33. By itself, PC 1 explains <b>background</b> <b>ozone</b> variations of about 0. 017 ppmv at DFW and over 0. 020 at HGA. (page 38) 34. The mean value of PC 1 declines steadily from spring to fall, consistent with the expected increasing prevalence of continental transport in late summer and early fall. (page 41) 35. The intraannual variation of PC 1 explains the early fall <b>background</b> <b>ozone</b> peak, but does not explain why spring experiences higher <b>background</b> <b>ozone</b> than early summer. (page 42) 36. PC 1 is much less variable in the summer, so days with PC 1 less than ? 8 (favorable for high <b>background</b> <b>ozone)</b> are somewhat more common in spring than summer. The summer sees extended periods of onshore transport. (page 42) 37. Even with a given wind pattern (PC 1), <b>background</b> <b>ozone</b> levels are higher by close to 0. 010 ppmv in spring than in early fall. (page 43) 38. The PC 1 values on two days together are a better predictor of <b>background</b> <b>ozone</b> than a single-day PC 1 value. This finding is consistent with the expectation that extended transport from the continent is more favorable for high <b>background</b> <b>ozone</b> than single days with favorable winds. (page 45) 39. Winds from the southwest carry high ozone if they were recently from the northeast. (page 46) 8 -Hour, Part I Page 7 of 52 1 / 29 / 05 40. At given values of PC 1 at zero and two-day leads, <b>background</b> <b>ozone</b> in HGA is 0. 010 ppmv to 0. 018 ppmv higher in spring than in summer. This suggests that the relatively high <b>background</b> <b>ozone</b> in springtime high regardless of the day-to-day weather patterns. (page 47) 41. Previous research suggests that high springtime ozone values are a consequence of the high lifetime of ozone in spring combined with a wintertime buildup of NOx. (page 48 - 49) 42.

40|$|Abstract: It {{has been}} known that the “background ozone ” level in urban cities is {{changing}} over the years. What is the <b>background</b> <b>ozone</b> and why this is changing is not entirely clear. This paper looks at one definition of <b>background</b> <b>ozone</b> level and using this definition to derive the background level of ozone using ambient quality data measured at the monitoring stations. From the derived <b>background</b> <b>ozone</b> level, {{it is possible to}} determine the change of background level from the early 1990 to the present day. The change or trend in background level at different monitoring stations will be accessed using the Long Range Dependent method and the results are shown to be not the same at different stations. This shows that the local conditions at each station are important in determining whether a quality management plan to reduce ozone below exceedance level is effective (or achievable) or not...|$|E

40|$|Both {{observations}} and a 3 -D chemical transport model suggest that surface ozone over populated eastern China features a significant drop in mid-summer {{and that the}} peak month differs by latitude and region. Source-receptor analysis is used to quantify the contributions of <b>background</b> <b>ozone</b> and Chinese anthropogenic emissions on this variability. Annual mean <b>background</b> <b>ozone</b> over China shows a spatial gradient from 55 ppbv in the northwest to 20 ppbv in the southeast, corresponding with changes in topography and ozone lifetime. Anthropogenic background (annual mean of 12. 6 ppbv) shows distinct troughs {{in the summer and}} peaks in the spring. On the monthly-mean basis, Chinese pollution ozone (CPO) has a peak of 20 – 25 ppbv in June north of the Yangtze River and in October south of it, which explains the peaks of surface ozone in these months. The mid-summer drop in ozone over eastern China is driven by the decrease of <b>background</b> <b>ozone</b> (− 15 ppbv). Tagged simulations suggest that this decrease is driven by reduced transport from Europe and North America, whereas ozone from Southeast Asia and Pacific Ocean exhibits a maximum in the summer over eastern China. This contrast in seasonality provides clear evidence that the seasonal switch in monsoonal wind patterns plays a significant role in determining the seasonality of <b>background</b> <b>ozone</b> over China...|$|E
40|$|Planetary {{boundary}} layer (PBL) ozone temporal variations were investigated on diurnal, seasonal and decadal scales in various regions across Canada and the United States {{for the period}} 1997 – 2006. <b>Background</b> <b>ozone</b> is difficult to quantify and define through observations. In light {{of the importance of}} its estimates for achievable policy targets, evaluation of health impacts and relationship with climate, <b>background</b> <b>ozone</b> mixing ratios were estimated. Principal Component Analyses (PCA) were performed using 97 non-urban ozone sites for each season to define contiguous regions. Backward air parcel trajectories were used to systematically select the cleanest background air cluster associated with the lowest May–September 95 th percentile for each site. Decadal ozone trends were estimated by season for each PCA-derived region using a~generalized linear mixed model (GLMM). <b>Background</b> <b>ozone</b> mixing ratios were variable geographically and seasonally. For example, the mixing ratios annually ranged from 21 to 38, and 23 to 38 ppb for the continental Eastern Canada and Eastern US. The Pacific and Atlantic coastal regions typically had relatively low background levels ranging from 14 to 24, and 17 to 36 ppb, respectively.

40|$|Key {{findings}} and recommendations {{of general interest}} are in boldface. From Chapter 2 : 1. <b>Background</b> <b>ozone</b> may {{be defined as the}} lowest 8 -h maximum ozone level on a given day within a region. (page 19) 2. When estimating <b>background</b> <b>ozone</b> for Houston, certain monitors with anomalously low ozone levels must be excluded. (page 19 - 21) 3. Annual variations in <b>background</b> <b>ozone</b> levels in Houston have a double peak, with high levels in the spring and late summer/early fall and low levels in early winter and early summer. (page 21) 4. The local contribution may be defined as the difference between the <b>background</b> <b>ozone</b> on a given day and the highest 8 -h average on that day. (page 21) 5. In Houston, the highest local contributions occur in summer and the smallest occur in winter. (page 21) 6. The 8 -h maximum ozone in Houston is a combination of these two annual cycles, resulting in a primary peak in August/September and a secondary, broader peak in May. (page 21) 7. The daily average 8 -h maximum ozone in Houston at the August/September peak is 0. 089 ppmv, which exceeds the 8 -h ozone standard. (page 21) 8 -h Ozone in Houston iv 1 / 29 / 05 8. Unlike other parts of central and eastern Texas, average local contributions to 8 -h ozone in Houston during the summer are as large as <b>background</b> <b>ozone</b> concentrations. (page 22) From Chapter 3 : 9. 8 -h ozone exceedances occur about 10 times per year each in August and September and about 20 times per year during the period April-July. (page 24) 10. The average annual number of 8 -h ozone exceedances at the various monitors ranges from 4 per year to 18 per year. (page 26) 11. Because some ozone monitors in Houston are strongly influenced by instrumental or local effects, {{it is not possible to}} determine the true spatial distribution of high levels of ozone within Houston. (page 28) 12. Efforts should be made to determine the true cause of the systematic station-tostation variations in ozone concentration. (page 28) From Chapter 4 : 13. The highest 8 -h design value for Houston peaked at 0. 118 ppmv in 1998 and has fallen every year since then. (page 30) 14. The current (2002 - 2004) ozone design value for Houston is 0. 102 ppmv, at station C 53 (Bayland Park). (page 30) 15. A downward trend in design values is found at almost all monitors. (page 30) 8 -h Ozone in Houston v 1 / 29 / 05 16. The characteristics of high ozone days may be determined by compiling statistics on the third through sixth highest 8 -h days each year at each monitor. This is more robust than simply tracking the characteristics of the fourth highest 8 -h day each year. (page 32) 17. At the individual monitors examined in detail, the <b>background</b> <b>ozone</b> levels on high 8 -h ozone days has been steady over the past 11 years at around 0. 065 ppmv. Over a shorter (7 -year) period of record, the <b>background</b> <b>ozone</b> high 8 -h days has been declining. (page 38) 18. The contribution of transient high ozone events to ozone levels on high 8 -h ozone days has been relatively minor since 2002. (page 35) 19. The decline in importance of transient high ozone events may simply be a consequence of transient high ozone events preferentially occurring on low ozone days. (page 43) 20. At the examined stations, <b>background</b> <b>ozone</b> comprises 60 % to 75 % (on average) of the total ozone measured on high 8 -h ozone days. This percentage was lower in the past. (page 32 - 38) 21. The average of the third to sixth highest annual <b>background</b> <b>ozone</b> levels (a measure of the design value in the absence of Houston emissions) has been falling steadily since the late 1990 s and now stands at 0. 062 ppmv. (page 41) 22. Days that violate the 8 -h standard are more frequent than days that violate the 1 -h standard. (page 44) 23. It is not clear from the statistical data whether emissions controls that bring Houston into compliance with the 1 -h ozone standard would also bring it into compliance with the 8 -h ozone standard. (page 44) 8 -h Ozone in Houston vi 1 / 29 / 05 From Chapter 5 : 24. <b>Background</b> <b>ozone</b> in Houston is most strongly correlated with meteorological parameters relating to a component of wind from the north on the day of the ozone and on each of the previous two days. (page 47) 25. Weaker winds also favor higher levels of <b>background</b> <b>ozone.</b> (page 47) 26. The local contribution to ozone is most strongly correlated with temperature (a positive correlation), with wind speed and the occurrence of precipitation both strongly negatively correlated. (page 47) 27. Temperature is not significantly correlated with <b>background</b> <b>ozone</b> levels. (page 47) 28. The difference in meteorological parameters related to <b>background</b> <b>ozone</b> and local contributions supports the approach of attempting to understand <b>background</b> <b>ozone</b> and local contributions separately. (page 47) 29. When the effects of wind speed and direction are excluded, precipitation appears to be an important suppressor of <b>background</b> <b>ozone</b> levels. (page 48) 30. When meteorological variables are controlled for by stepwise regression, there is significantly less local contribution on Sunday than on other days. (page 50) 8 -h Ozone in Houston vii 1 / 29 / 05 From Chapter 6 : 31. Regional-scale wind patterns are dominated by the sea breeze rotation, in which winds trace a circle or ellipse over the course of a 24 -hour period. (page 52) 32. This rotation is not as apparent in surface observations over land, because nighttime winds tend to become calm in the lowest few tens of meters. (page 55) 33. The wind rotation leads to recirculation when large-scale mean resultant winds are smaller in magnitude than the amplitude of the sea breeze rotation, which is about 3 m/s (6 mph). (page 57) 34. The timing of recirculation is determined by the direction of the large-scale wind. (page 57) 35. The wind rotation leads to stagnation when large-scale mean resultant winds are only slightly weaker than the sea breeze rotation. (page 58) 36. Average 1 -h maximum ozone levels are 0. 090 to 0. 110 when the 24 -hour mean resultant wind at a nearby offshore buoy is less than 4 m/s (8 mph). (page 60) 37. <b>Background</b> <b>ozone</b> levels are highest (nearly 0. 050 ppmv) when the 24 -hour mean resultant wind is less than 1 m/s. (page 61) 38. The local contribution to 1 -h ozone is nearly independent of wind speed below 4 m/s and decreases steadily at higher wind speeds, consistent with the sea breeze rotation model. (page 60) 39. The background contribution to 8 -h ozone levels is larger than the local contribution at all wind speeds. (page 61) 40. The 8 -h local contribution is highest (0. 035 ppmv) at the lowest wind speeds and is in general less dependent on wind speeds than the 1 -h local contribution. (page 61) 8 -h Ozone in Houston viii 1 / 29 / 05 41. The north-south component of wind is a better indicator of <b>background</b> <b>ozone</b> levels than is wind speed itself. (page 62) 42. The highest average <b>background</b> <b>ozone</b> levels (0. 046 ppmv) occur with a weak wind component from the north, while the lowest <b>background</b> <b>ozone</b> levels (less than 0. 020 ppmv) occur with a strong wind component from the south. These wind variations are a reflection of the importance of the large-scale wind patterns in controlling <b>background</b> <b>ozone.</b> (page 62) 43. <b>Background</b> <b>ozone</b> and local contributions are quite variable and cannot be predicted accurately from wind indicators alone. (page 63 - 64) 44. The highest 1 -h local contributions occur at 24 -hour resultant wind speeds of 1. 5 m/s to 4. 5 m/s (3 mph to 8 mph). (page 63) 45. The highest 8 -h local contributions occur at 24 -hour resultant wind speeds of less than 1. 5 m/s. (page 64) 46. <b>Background</b> <b>ozone</b> levels of 0. 040 ppmv or greater, which increase the likelihood of an 8 -h ozone exceedance, can be reached at almost any wind speed. (page 65) 47. Extremely high <b>background</b> <b>ozone</b> levels (greater than 0. 105 ppmv) have occurred when the 24 -hour resultant wind is nearly zero. (page 66) 48. High 1 -h (and 8 -h) local contributions are favored when the wind is light from the southeast, south, or southwest, but not when the wind is light from the north. The southerly winds are associated with daytime stagnation, while the northerly winds are associated with nighttime stagnation. Developing winds would likely carry any pollution blob resulting from nighttime stagnation eastward and southeastward over unmonitored areas. (page 66 - 69) 8 -h Ozone in Houston ix 1 / 29 / 05 49. In all the major local contribution cases, it appears that the meteorological pattern and sea breeze rotation combine to produce local stagnation in the Houston area sometime between 7 AM and 4 PM. (page 69) 50. <b>Background</b> <b>ozone</b> is less strongly dependent on the background wind speed and direction. (page 70) 51. There is a strong tendency for high <b>background</b> <b>ozone</b> with winds from the northeast. (page 70) 52. The largest cluster of extreme <b>background</b> <b>ozone</b> events is found when the 24 -hour resultant mean winds are 0. 5 m/s (1 mph) or less. Under such conditions, the ozone plume from Houston on a given day would follow a circular path and end up back in Houston on the following day. At no time during this evolution would the actual winds be stagnant. (page 70) 53. Very high <b>background</b> <b>ozone</b> occurrences with winds from the west-southwest are associated with reversals in the 24 -hour mean wind from the previous day and probably include the return of the previous day?s pollution. (page 71 - 72) 54. Local contributions to 8 -h ozone can be substantial even without pure stagnation, because an elongated but fairly concentrated plume can be as effective as a blob of high ozone in elevating 8 -h levels at a fixed monitor. (page 73) 55. In general, the conditions favoring high ozone are similar for 1 -h and 8 -h exceedances, except that 8 -h exceedances are more sensitive to <b>background</b> <b>ozone</b> levels and less sensitive to local contributions. (page 73) 8 -h Ozone in Houston x 1 / 29 / 05 56. Individual days will depart from the idealized wind patterns, but those patterns seem adequate for explaining the general conditions associated with most high ozone events in Houston. (page 73) From Chapter 7 : 57. Demonstration modeling in support of the 8 -h standard should consider a broader range of meteorological conditions than 1 -h modeling. (page 75) 58. Demonstration modeling should include an episode (or separate episodes) with both high background days and low background days. (page 75) 59. Days in which ozone from the previous day returns to Houston tend to be rare but extreme 8 -h ozone events. They are likely to be difficult to model successfully because of the needed wind accuracy. (page 75) 60. Days with high pollution at inland stations are likely to involve different mixes of precursor emissions and different chemical processes than days with high pollution at coastal stations, and both types of events should be modeled.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Policy Relevant <b>Background</b> (PRB) <b>ozone</b> {{concentrations}} {{are defined}} by the United States (U. S.) Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as those concentrations that would occur in the U. S. {{in the absence of}} anthropogenic emissions in continental North America (i. e., the U. S, Canada, and Mexico). Estimates of PRB ozone have had an important role historically in the EPA’s human health and welfare risk analyses used in establishing National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). The margin of safety for the protection of public health in the ozone rulemaking process has been established from human health risks calculated based on PRB ozone estimates. Sensitivity analyses conducted by the EPA have illustrated that changing estimates of PRB ozone concentrations have a progressively greater impact on estimates of mortality risk as more stringent standards are considered. As defined by the EPA, PRB ozone is a model construct, but it is informed by measurements at relatively remote monitoring sites (RRMS). This review examines the current understanding of PRB ozone, based on both model predictions and measurements at RRMS, and provides recommendations fo...|$|R
40|$|Surface ozone (O 3) is {{a potent}} {{phytotoxic}} air pollutant and significantly reduces the productivity of important agricultural crops. Growing use of fossil fuel and changes in climate are increasing the global <b>background</b> surface <b>ozone</b> concentrations to levels that threaten regional and global food supply. We performed an integrated modeling study, considering biophysical and crop management factors, to identify the spatial pattern of ozone damage in lands suitable for crop cultivation and to assess the potential for adaptation for four key crops (wheat, maize, rice and soybean) under current and future air quality legislation. Results indicate that China, India and the United States {{are by far the}} most affected countries, bearing {{more than half of all}} global losses and threatened areas. Short-erm adaptive measures at farm level, such as shifting crop calendars (by changing sowing dates or using crop cultivars with different cycle lengths) can reduce ozone damage regionally but have only limited impact at the global level. Considering these limited benefits of adaptation, mitigation of O 3 precursors remains the main option to secure regional and global food production...|$|R
40|$|A major {{objective}} of the 2006 Second Texas Air Quality Study (TexAQS II) focused on understanding the effects of regional processes on Houston and Dallas ozone nonattainment areas. Here we quantify the contributions of background (continental scale) ozone production on Houston and Dallas air quality during TexAQS II using ensemble Lagrangian trajectories to identify remote source regions that impact Houston and Dallas <b>background</b> <b>ozone</b> distributions. Global-scale chemical analyses, constrained with composition measurements from instruments on the NASA Aura satellite, are used to provide estimates of background composition along ensemble back trajectories. Lagrangian averaged O- 3 net photochemical production (production minus loss, P-L) rates along the back trajectories are used as a metric to classify back trajectories. Results show that the majority (6 out of 9 or 66 %) of the periods of high ozone in Houston were associated with periods of enhanced <b>background</b> <b>ozone</b> production. Slightly less than 50 % (7 out of 15) of the days with high ozone in the Dallas Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) show enhanced <b>background</b> <b>ozone</b> production. Source apportionment studies show that 5 -day Lagrangian averaged O- 3 P-L in excess of 15 ppbv/d can occur during continental-scale transport to Houston owing to NOy enhancements from emissions within the Southern Great Lakes as well as recirculation of the Houston emissions.

Not being recently mixed with boundary layer air, these air masses are characterised by a chemical age greater than 2 days. This analysis has shown that under background conditions the yearly principal maximum of ozone is recorded in spring and a secondary maximum is recorded in summer. In contrast, if we consider non-background conditions, the principal maximum is found in late summer and a secondary one in spring.

We use the FRSGC-UCI 3 -D chemical transport model to quantify the effects of anthropogenic emissions from the developing countries of East Asia on neighbouring continents and on the global troposphere.

40|$|Uncertainty {{about health}} effects of {{long-term}} ozone exposure remains. Land use regression (LUR) models have been used successfully for modeling fine scale spatial variation of primary pollutants but very limited for ozone. Our objective {{was to assess the}} feasibility of developing a national LUR model for ozone at a fine spatial scale. Ozone concentrations were measured with passive samplers at 90 locations across the Netherlands (19 regional background, 36 urban background, 35 traffic). All sites were measured simultaneously during four 2 -weekly campaigns spread over the seasons. LUR models were developed for the summer average as the primary exposure and annual average using predictor variables obtained with Geographic Information Systems. Summer average ozone concentrations varied between 32 and 61 µg/m(3). Ozone concentrations at traffic sites were on average 9 µg/m(3) lower compared to regional <b>background</b> sites. <b>Ozone</b> correlated highly negatively with nitrogen dioxide and moderately with fine particles. A LUR model including small-scale traffic, large-scale address density, urban green and a region indicator explained 71 % of the spatial variation in summer average ozone concentrations.

Ozone-induced senescence of L. hispidus was enhanced when grown with the more open canopy of A. odoratum compared to the denser growing D. glomerata. There was increased cover with increasing ozone exposure for both A. odoratum and D. glomerata, which resulted in an increase in the grass:Leontodon cover ratio in both community types.

40|$|In this study, we {{investigated}} {{the effect of}} numerous regulations enforced since 1985 to improve air quality on ozone in Europe with the focus on Switzerland, using the Comprehensive Air Quality Model with Extensions (CAMx) for a specific summer period. Several emission scenarios for the year 2010 were also considered. The model {{results suggest that the}} emission reductions of ozone precursors should have been effective to reduce ozone production between 1985 and 2000 in northern Switzerland. However, observations do not indicate any significant change in surface ozone levels since early 1990 s, except in the region of Zurich where there is a small negative trend. On the other hand, the model predictions match very well the spatial variability of the trends but the calculated trends are around 0. 5 ppb year(- 1) lower than those observed. This difference is similar to the <b>background</b> <b>ozone</b> increase as suggested by the long-term observations at the high Alpine station Jungfraujoch. These results support the hypothesis that the decrease in local ozone production due to emission reductions might have been partly or completely compensated by the simultaneous increase in the <b>background</b> <b>ozone.</b> In 2010, a strict application of the Gothenburg Protocol in Europe would lead to a decrease in peak ozone concentrations by about 5 % in Switzerland under the meteorological conditions applied. our calculations also indicated that emission controls only in Switzerland would not be very effective to improve the air quality in the future.

The spread of plant species may be less than expected, {{but a number of}} slow-growing ‘stress-tolerant’ species, including montane/alpine species, are likely to be lost. Nitrogen deposited as a result of emission of NOx from vehicles and NH 3 from agriculture is now a major source of acidity, and problems of acidification and eutrophication are linked. Despite reductions in sulphur emissions, critical loads of acid deposition are likely to be exceeded for soils in most of the Scottish uplands until at least 2005. Critical levels affecting tree growth may be exceeded where forests are in cloud for 10 % of the time in areas of the Great Glen.

An anthropogenic NOx, NMVOCs and CO emission inventory and biogenic NMVOCs emission data were used to support model simulations.

40|$|Two {{ground-based}} ozone lidars {{have been}} operated at Observatoire de Haute Provence (OHP) for 11 days during the Intercontinental Transport of Ozone and Precursors (ITOP- 2004) measurement campaign. Ozone and scattering ratio vertical profiles have been measured from the boundary layer {{up to the}} tropopause. At first order, tropospheric ozone temporal variability is due to local pollution within the planetary boundary layer and to stratosphere-troposphere exchange. Remaining ozone rich layers within the free troposphere are related to long-range transport processes. Transport pathways are discussed combining Lagrangian particle dispersion modeling analysis and upstream airborne in situ measurements of the chemical composition of these air masses. High ozone and CO mixing ratios measured within polluted plumes aboard the aircraft correspond to ozone and aerosol layers seen by the lidar. Most of these layers {{have their origin in}} North America where they are uplifted either by forest fires or by warm conveyor belts in the vicinity of frontal regions. During the campaign, these polluted and thin (< 1 km) layers remain coherent and are transported in a Lagrangian manner over the Atlantic Ocean.

40|$|Ozone {{throughout}} the troposphere is subject of significant {{temporal and spatial}} variability due to photochemical production in the planetary boundary layer and free troposphere, stratospheric intrusions, convective events and long range transport. However, high resolving observations of ozone in the troposphere are generally rare today. That is of special disadvantage for limited area models, which represent mathematically a differential equation system with an initial and boundary problem. As ozone concentrations usually increase from the earth surface to the stratosphere, a proper choice of the <b>background</b> <b>ozone</b> concentrations is necessary to reproduce or even predict the amount and distribution of ozone in a specific region of interest. In this paper the impact of background concentrations of ozone on regional scale model results is analysed during a summer smog episode over Europe. For this purpose ozone is artificially partitioned into individual categories. For each category, transport and chemical transformation is calculated separately. Initial and boundary concentrations of ozone dominate total ozone concentrations increasingly with height. But also in the planetary boundary layer they contribute with more than 30 % to the total ozone changes and are therefore far from being negligible.

To address this issue, surface ozone and ancillary data over the period 2004 – 2006 from the Shangdianzi Regional Background Station in north China were analyzed. Due to the suitable location and valley topography of the site, transport of pollutants from the North China Plain was easily observed and quantified according to surface wind directions. Regional (polluted) and <b>background</b> (clean) <b>ozone</b> concentrations were obtained by detailed statistic analysis.
