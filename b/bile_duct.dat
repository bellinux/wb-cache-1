5|$|Ascending cholangitis, {{also known}} as acute cholangitis or simply cholangitis, is an {{infection}} of the <b>bile</b> <b>duct</b> (cholangitis), usually caused by bacteria ascending from its junction with the duodenum (first part of the small intestine). It tends to occur if the <b>bile</b> <b>duct</b> is already partially obstructed by gallstones.|$|E
5|$|Given that {{ascending}} cholangitis usually {{occurs in}} the setting of <b>bile</b> <b>duct</b> obstruction, various forms of medical imaging may be employed to identify the site and nature of this obstruction. The first investigation is usually ultrasound, as this is the most easily available. Ultrasound may show dilation of the <b>bile</b> <b>duct</b> and identifies 38% of <b>bile</b> <b>duct</b> stones; it is relatively poor at identifying stones farther down the <b>bile</b> <b>duct.</b> Ultrasound can help distinguish between cholangitis and cholecystitis (inflammation of the gallbladder), which has similar symptoms to cholangitis but appears differently on ultrasound. A better test is magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP), which uses magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); this has a comparable sensitivity to ERCP. Smaller stones, however, can still be missed on MRCP depending {{on the quality of the}} hospital's facilities.|$|E
5|$|The gold {{standard}} test for biliary obstruction is still {{endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography}} (ERCP). This {{involves the use of}} endoscopy (passing a tube through the mouth into the esophagus, stomach and thence to the duodenum) to pass a small cannula into the <b>bile</b> <b>duct.</b> At that point, radiocontrast is injected to opacify the duct, and X-rays are taken to get a visual impression of the biliary system. On the endoscopic image of the ampulla, one can sometimes see a protuberant ampulla from an impacted gallstone in the common <b>bile</b> <b>duct</b> or the frank extrusion of pus from the common <b>bile</b> <b>duct</b> orifice. On the X-ray images (known as cholangiograms), gallstones are visible as non-opacified areas in the contour of the duct. For diagnostic purposes, ERCP has now generally been replaced by MRCP. ERCP is only used first-line in critically ill patients in whom delay for diagnostic tests is not acceptable; however, if the index of suspicion for cholangitis is high, an ERCP is typically done to achieve drainage of the obstructed common <b>bile</b> <b>duct.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{intravenous}} cholangiogram or IVC is a radiologic (x-ray) {{procedure that}} is used primarily {{to look at the}} larger <b>bile</b> <b>ducts</b> within the liver and the <b>bile</b> <b>ducts</b> outside the liver. The procedure can be used to locate gallstones within these <b>bile</b> <b>ducts.</b> IVC also can be used to identify other causes of obstruction to the flow of bile, for example, narrowings (strictures) of the <b>bile</b> <b>ducts</b> and cancers that may impair the normal flow of bile.|$|R
40|$|The {{paucity of}} {{intrahepatic}} <b>bile</b> <b>ducts</b> {{is characterized by}} reducing the quantity of interlobular <b>bile</b> <b>ducts</b> in re- lation to portal tracts of the liver. There are two de fi ned forms of paucity of intrahepaticbile ducts: syndromatic, which is associated with various extrahepatic abnormalities and nonsyndromatic, being the heterogeneous group of disorders, including congenital infections, metabolic, endocrine, immune disorders, congenital infections and various other disorders. In many instances paucity of intrahepatic <b>bile</b> <b>ducts</b> remains idiopathic. The review contains terminological issues, {{the description of the}} classi fi cation and the morphological characteristic, the dif- ferences of syndromatic and nonsyndromatic forms of paucity of intrahepatic <b>bile</b> <b>ducts,</b> and also the description of principles of differential diagnosis of paucity of intrahepatic <b>bile</b> <b>ducts</b> and biliary atresia.   </div...|$|R
40|$|Aim. To {{study the}} clinica-morphological {{features}} of syndromatic and nonsyndromatic paucity of intrahepatic <b>bile</b> <b>ducts</b> in pediatric liver transplant recipients. Methods and results. The clinical records were analyzed and histological studies of native livers of 20 children, {{who had suffered}} from paucity of intrahepatic <b>bile</b> <b>ducts</b> and to whom liver transplantation were made, were completed. The obtained data indicate higher levels of AST in patients with nonsyndromatic paucity of intrahepaticbile ducts (p = 0, 023). Ductopenia was the more frequent indication of syndromatic form of paucity of intrahepatic <b>bile</b> <b>ducts</b> (p = 0, 01), while ductular proliferations, which form «ductular structure», were discovered more often in nonsyndromatic paucity of intrahepaticbile ducts (p = 0, 03). The extent of in fl ammatory-destructive changes was more expressed in nonsyndromatic pauci- ty of intrahepatic <b>bile</b> <b>ducts</b> (p = 0, 01). Fibrosis or cirrhosis was formed more often in nonsyndromatic paucity of intrahepatic <b>bile</b> <b>ducts</b> (p = 0, 008). Conclusion. Our results indicate more severe clinical and morphological manifestations in nonsyndromatic paucity of intrahepatic <b>bile</b> <b>ducts.</b> These fi ndings may suggest about heavier liver condition in patient with nonsyndromatic form of paucity of intrahepatic <b>bile</b> <b>ducts.</b>   </div...|$|R
5|$|Cholangitis can be life-threatening, and is {{regarded}} as a medical emergency. Characteristic symptoms include yellow discoloration of the skin or whites of the eyes, fever, abdominal pain, and in severe cases, low blood pressure and confusion. Initial treatment is with intravenous fluids and antibiotics, but there is often an underlying problem (such as gallstones or narrowing in the <b>bile</b> <b>duct)</b> for which further tests and treatments may be necessary, usually in the form of endoscopy to relieve obstruction of the <b>bile</b> <b>duct.</b> The word is from Greek chol-, bile + ang-, vessel + -itis, inflammation.|$|E
5|$|In the elderly, the {{presentation}} may be atypical; they may directly collapse due to sepsis without first showing typical features. Those with an indwelling stent in the <b>bile</b> <b>duct</b> (see below) may not develop jaundice.|$|E
5|$|The {{presence}} of a permanent biliary stent (e.g. in pancreatic cancer) slightly {{increases the risk of}} cholangitis, but stents of this type are often needed to keep the <b>bile</b> <b>duct</b> patent under outside pressure.|$|E
25|$|Rarely are {{diseases}} of the <b>bile</b> <b>ducts,</b> such as primary sclerosing cholangitis, causes of cirrhosis. Imaging of the <b>bile</b> <b>ducts,</b> such as ERCP or MRCP (MRI of biliary tract and pancreas) may aid in the diagnosis.|$|R

40|$|Introduction. Retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is a {{validated}} {{reference method}} for detection and treatment of choledocholithiasis. It can be performed at any stage of treatment.

Despite varied course of choledocholithiasis, swift detection and removal of stones from <b>bile</b> <b>ducts</b> should be striven for due to a potential risk of life-threatening complications...|$|R
5|$|Arturo Vega, {{creative}} director from their formation in 1974 until their disbanding in 1996 and often considered the fifth Ramone, died on June 8, 2013, {{at the age}} of 65. The final original member, Tommy Ramone, died on July 11, 2014 after a battle with <b>bile</b> <b>duct</b> cancer.|$|E
5|$|In {{ascending}} cholangitis, it {{is assumed}} that organisms migrate backwards up the <b>bile</b> <b>duct</b> as a result of partial obstruction and decreased function of the sphincter of Oddi. Other theories about the origin of the bacteria, such as through the portal vein or transmigration from the colon, are considered less likely.|$|E
5|$|Cholangiocarcinoma, {{also known}} as <b>bile</b> <b>duct</b> cancer, {{is a form of}} cancer that is {{composed}} of mutated epithelial cells (or cells showing characteristics of epithelial differentiation) that originate in the bile ducts which drain bile from the liver into the small intestine. Other biliary tract cancers include gallbladder cancer and cancer of the ampulla of Vater.|$|E
5|$|Cholangiocarcinoma {{can affect}} any {{area of the}} <b>bile</b> <b>ducts,</b> either within or outside the liver. Tumors {{occurring}} in the <b>bile</b> <b>ducts</b> within the liver {{are referred to as}} intrahepatic, those occurring in the ducts outside the liver are extrahepatic, and tumors occurring at the site where the <b>bile</b> <b>ducts</b> exit the liver may be referred to as perihilar. A cholangiocarcinoma occurring at the junction where the left and right hepatic ducts meet to form the common hepatic duct may be referred to eponymously as a Klatskin tumor.|$|R
50|$|CA 19-9 can be {{elevated}} in {{many types}} of gastrointestinal cancer, such as colorectal cancer, esophageal cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma. Apart from cancer, elevated levels may also occur in pancreatitis, cirrhosis, and diseases of the <b>bile</b> <b>ducts.</b> It can be elevated in people with obstruction of the <b>bile</b> <b>ducts.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{most common}} {{physical}} indications of cholangiocarcinoma are abnormal liver function tests, jaundice (yellowing {{of the eyes}} and skin occurring when <b>bile</b> <b>ducts</b> are blocked by tumor), abdominal pain (30%–50%), generalized itching (66%), weight loss (30%–50%), fever (up to 20%), {{and changes in the}} color of stool or urine. To some extent, the symptoms depend upon the location of the tumor: patients with cholangiocarcinoma in the extrahepatic <b>bile</b> <b>ducts</b> (outside the liver) {{are more likely to have}} jaundice, while those with tumors of the <b>bile</b> <b>ducts</b> within the liver more often have pain without jaundice.|$|R
5|$|Liver {{function}} {{tests can}} show {{a combination of}} results indicative of <b>bile</b> <b>duct</b> obstruction (raised conjugated bilirubin, γ-glutamyl transpeptidase and alkaline phosphatase levels). CA19-9 (carbohydrate antigen 19.9) is a tumor marker that is frequently elevated in pancreatic cancer. However, it lacks sensitivity and specificity, not least because 5% of people lack the Lewis (a) antigen and cannot produce CA19-9. It has a sensitivity of 80% and specificity of 73% in detecting pancreatic adenocarcinoma, and is used for following known cases rather than diagnosis.|$|E
5|$|In June 2014, a {{tumor in}} his <b>bile</b> <b>duct</b> was {{discovered}} during a routine physical exam. It was removed, and Iwata {{returned to work}} in October of that year. The issue resurfaced in 2015, and Iwata {{died at the age}} of 55 from its complications on July 11. Members of the gaming industry and fans alike expressed their despair over his death through public announcements and social media, and fans worldwide established temporary memorials. Iwata was posthumously granted the Lifetime Achievement Award at both the 2015 Golden Joystick Awards and the 2016 DICE Awards.|$|E
5|$|Narrowed {{areas may}} be bridged by a stent, a hollow tube {{that keeps the}} duct open. Removable plastic stents are used in {{uncomplicated}} gallstone disease, while permanent self-expanding metal stents with a longer lifespan are used if the obstruction is due to pressure from a tumor such as pancreatic cancer. A nasobiliary drain may be left behind; this is a plastic tube that passes from the <b>bile</b> <b>duct</b> through the stomach and the nose and allows continuous drainage of bile into a receptible. It {{is similar to a}} nasogastric tube, but passes into the common <b>bile</b> <b>duct</b> directly, and allows for serial x-ray cholangiograms to be done to identify the improvement of the obstruction. The decision on which of the aforementioned treatments to apply is generally based on the severity of the obstruction, findings on other imaging studies, and whether the patient has improved with antibiotic treatment. Certain treatments may be unsafe if blood clotting is impaired, as the risk of bleeding (especially from sphincterotomy) is increased in the use of medication such as clopidogrel (which inhibits platelet aggregation) or if the prothrombin time is significantly prolonged. For a prolonged prothrombin time, vitamin K or fresh frozen plasma may be administered to reduce bleeding risk.|$|E

5|$|Not all gallstones {{implicated in}} {{ascending}} cholangitis actually originate from the gallbladder, but cholecystectomy (surgical {{removal of the}} gallbladder) is generally recommended in {{people who have been}} treated for cholangitis due to gallstone disease. This is typically delayed until all symptoms have resolved and ERCP or MRCP have confirmed that the <b>bile</b> <b>duct</b> is clear of gallstones. Those who do not undergo cholecystectomy have an increased risk of recurrent biliary pain, jaundice, further episodes of cholangitis, and need for further ERCP or cholecystostomy; the risk of death is also significantly increased.|$|E
5|$|The biliary tree is {{normally}} relatively free of bacteria because of certain protective mechanisms. The sphincter of Oddi {{acts as a}} mechanical barrier. The biliary system normally has low pressure (8 to 12 cmH2O) and allows bile to flow freely through. The continuous forward flow of the bile in the duct flushes bacteria, if present, into the duodenum, and does not allow {{the establishment of an}} infection. The constitution of bilebile salts and immunoglobulin secreted by the epithelium of the <b>bile</b> <b>duct</b> also has a protective role.|$|E
5|$|In February 1999, Payton {{announced}} that he had a rare autoimmune liver disease known as primary sclerosing cholangitis, which may have led to his cholangiocarcinoma (<b>bile</b> <b>duct</b> cancer). He spent his final months as an advocate for organ transplants, appearing in many commercials to encourage others to donate organs, although by the time his first appeal was recorded, his illness was already too far advanced for transplantation to have been a viable option. In April of that year, Payton made a final public appearance at a Chicago Cubs game with Mike Ditka, where he threw the game's ceremonial first pitch. Author Don Yaeger worked with him during the last weeks of his life to create his autobiography, Never Die Easy.|$|E

50|$|A hepatoportoenterostomy or Kasai portoenterostomy is a {{surgical}} treatment performed on infants with biliary atresia {{to allow for}} bile drainage.

40|$|Alagille {{syndrome}} (ALGS) is a complex, multisystem disease {{associated with}} mutations in the JAG 1 gene. In the liver, ALGS {{is characterized by}} paucity of intrahepatic <b>bile</b> <b>ducts.</b> Gene dosage analysis performed on a large, central regenerative nodule with preserved interlobular <b>bile</b> <b>ducts</b> of 2 unrelated ALGS patients, and on surrounding cirrhotic and ductopenic liver parenchyma, showed in both cases complete JAG 1 heterozygous deletion in the regenerative nodule and the ductopenic liver, with no differences in gene dosage. Thus, JAG 1 mosaicism and differential haploinsufficiency do not explain the presence of <b>bile</b> <b>ducts</b> in centrally located regenerative nodules...|$|R
5|$|In the Western world, about 15% of {{all people}} have gallstones in their {{gallbladder}} but the majority are unaware of this and have no symptoms. Over tenyears, 15–26% will suffer one or more episodes of biliary colic (abdominal pain due {{to the passage of}} gallstones through the <b>bile</b> <b>duct</b> into the digestive tract), and 2–3% will develop complications of obstruction: acute pancreatitis, cholecystitis or acute cholangitis. Prevalence of gallstone disease increases with age and body mass index (a marker of obesity). However, the risk is also increased in those who lose weight rapidly (e.g. after weight loss surgery) due to alterations in the composition of the bile that makes it prone to form stones. Gallstones are slightly more common in women than in men, and pregnancy increases the risk further.|$|E
5|$|Bacterial {{contamination}} {{alone in}} absence of obstruction does not usually result in cholangitis. However increased pressure within the biliary system (above 20 cmH2O) resulting from obstruction in the <b>bile</b> <b>duct</b> widens {{spaces between the}} cells lining the duct, bringing bacterially contaminated bile {{in contact with the}} blood stream. It also adversely affects the function of Kupffer cells, which are specialized macrophage cells that assist in preventing bacteria from entering the biliary system. Finally, increased biliary pressure decreases production of IgA immunoglobulins in the bile. This results in bacteremia (bacteria in the blood stream) and gives rise to the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) comprising fever (often with rigors), tachycardia, increased respiratory rate and increased white blood cell count; SIRS in the presence of suspected or confirmed infection is called sepsis. Biliary obstruction itself disadvantages the immune system and impairs its capability to fight infection, by impairing the function of certain immune system cells (neutrophil granulocytes) and modifying the levels of immune hormones (cytokines).|$|E
5|$|Bile is {{produced}} by the liver, and serves to eliminate cholesterol and bilirubin from the body, as well as emulsifying of fats {{to make them more}} soluble in water and aid in their digestion. Bile is formed in the liver by hepatocytes (liver cells) and excreted into the common hepatic duct. Part of the bile is stored in the gall bladder because of back pressure (exerted by the sphincter of Oddi), and may be released at the time of digestion. The gallbladder also concentrates the bile by absorbing water and dissolved salts from it. All bile reaches the duodenum (first part of the small intestine) through the common <b>bile</b> <b>duct</b> and the ampulla of Vater. The sphincter of Oddi, located at the junction of the ampulla of Vater and the duodenum, is a circular muscle that controls the release of both bile and pancreatic secretions into the digestive tract.|$|E
