40|$|We {{conducted}} a structural {{analysis of the}} antigenic cell wall mannoprotein (mannan) isolated from Candida kefyr (formerly Candida pseudotropicalis) IFO 0586. The result of two-dimensional homonuclear Hartmann-Hahn analysis of this mannan indicates that the molecule is constructed from alpha- 1, 2 - and alpha- 1, 6 -linked mannopyranose residues. Upon alkali treatment (beta-elimination reaction), this mannan released two alpha- 1, 2 -linked mannooligosaccharides, <b>biose</b> and triose. The structure of the alkali-stable mannan (outer chain) moiety was investigated by acetolysis. The structures of the resultant oligosaccharides, <b>biose</b> and triose, from the outer chain moiety {{were found to be}} the same as those of the alkali-released ones. Further, the treatment of the parent mannan with an Arthrobacter GJM- 1 exo-alpha-mannosidase gave a linear mannan consisting solely of alpha- 1, 6 -linked mannopyranose residues. These results indicate that the mannan forms the long backbone of the alpha- 1, 6 linkage, with a large number of short alpha- 1, 2 -linked oligomannosyl side chains forming a comblike structure. Moreover, we investigated the serological properties of this mannan by performing an inhibition assay of a slide agglutination reaction with mannooligosaccharides and polyclonal factor sera (Candida Check; Iatron). The result indicates that the factor 1 serum preferentially recognizes the alpha- 1, 2 -linked oligomannosyl side chains in this mannan. On the other hand, the fact that the mannan does not contain an antigenic determinant(s) corresponding to factor 8 suggests that the epitope(s) of this factor resides in other molecules on the cell surface of this strain...|$|E
40|$|We {{conducted}} a structural {{analysis of the}} cell wall mannans isolated from two Candida tropicalis strains, IFO 0199 and IFO 1647, exhibiting strong agglutinabilities against anti-Candida factor sera 5 and 6. The products released from these mannans by acid treatment were identified as the oligosaccharides, from <b>biose</b> to pentaose, consisting solely of beta- 1, 2 -linked mannopyranose units corresponding to common epitopes of Candida albicans serotypes A and B (factor 5). Mild acetolysis of acid- and alkali-treated mannans produced large amounts of hexaose and heptaose, Man rho beta 1 - 2 Man rho beta 1 - 2 Man rho alpha 1 - 2 Man rho alpha 1 - 2 Man rho alpha 1 - 2 Man and Man rho beta 1 - 2 Man rho beta 1 - 2 Man rho beta 1 - 2 Man rho alpha 1 - 2 Man rho alpha 1 - 2 Man, corresponding to the C. albicans serotype A-specific epitopes (factor 6). However, the homologous pentaose, Man rho beta 1 - 2 Man rho alpha 1 - 2 Man, was not generated by this procedure. The oligosaccharides (<b>biose</b> to hexaose) obtained from the mannans by conventional acetolysis were composed exclusively of alpha- 1, 2 -linked mannopyranose units. Therefore, the mannans of C. tropicalis IFO 0199 and IFO 1647 {{do not have the}} alpha- 1, 3 -linked mannopyranose units previously observed in the mannans of C. albicans and Candida stellatoidea. The results of this study and previous findings indicate that the similarity of the antigenicities of three Candida species, C. albicans serotype A, C. stellatoidea type II, and C. tropicalis, reside in the beta- 1, 2 and alpha- 1, 2 linkages containing oligomannosyl side chain (factor 6) in the cell wall mannan...|$|E

50|$|In {{most modern}} <b>BIOSes,</b> the boot {{priority}} order of all potentially bootable devices can be freely configured {{by the user}} through the BIOS configuration utility. In older <b>BIOSes,</b> limited boot priority options are selectable; in the earliest <b>BIOSes,</b> a fixed priority scheme was implemented, with floppy disk drives first, fixed disks (i.e. hard disks) second, and typically no other boot devices supported, subject to modification of these rules by installed option ROMs. The BIOS in an early PC also usually would only boot from the first floppy disk drive or the first hard disk drive, {{even if there were}} two drives of either type installed.

40|$|The glycolytic enzyme triosephosphate {{isomerase}} (TPI; EC 5. 3. 1. 1) of Staphylococcus aureus is {{a candidate}} adhesion molecule for {{the interaction between the}} bacterium and the fungal pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans. TPI may recognize the mannan backbone of glucuronoxylomannan (GXM) of C. neoformans. We purified TPI from extracts of S. aureus surface proteins to investigate its binding by surface plasmon resonance analysis. The immobilized TPI reacted with GXM in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, the interactions between staphylococcal TPI and α-(1 → 3) -mannooligosaccharides derived from GXM were examined. The oligosaccharides exhibited binding with TPI; however, monomeric mannose did not. Differences in the slopes of the sensorgrams were observed between oligosaccharides with an even number of residues versus those with an odd number. A heterogeneous ligand-parallel reaction model revealed the existence of at least two binding sites on TPI. The enzymic activities of TPI were inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by α-(1 → 3) -mannooligosaccharides larger than triose. The binding of TPI and α-(1 → 3) -mannotriose near the substrate-binding site was predicted in silico (AutoDock 3. 05). An oligosaccharide of size equal to or greater than triose could bind to the site, affecting enzymic activities. Moreover, affinities were indicated, especially for <b>biose</b> and tetraose, to another binding pocket, which would not affect enzymic activity. These data suggest a novel role for TPI, in addition to glycolysis, on the surface of S. aureus...|$|E
40|$|Cultivation of Candida albicans NIH B- 792 (serotype B) at high {{temperature}} (37 degrees C) for 48 h in yeast extract-containing Sabouraud liquid medium (YSLM) provided the following findings {{in comparison with}} the findings obtained after incubation at 27 degrees C. Growth of the blastoconidia of this strain was decreased, with a dry weight of 9 %, and the cells were deficient in cytokinesis. The cells did not undergo agglutination with serum factor 5 from a commercially available serum factor kit (Candida Check). Mannan (B- 37 -M) obtained from the cells cultured at 37 degrees C had partially lost its reactivity against serum factor 4 and lost most of its reactivity against serum factor 5 in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in contrast to that (B- 27 -M) at 27 degrees C. Both cells and mannan prepared by cultivation first at 37 degrees C and then at 27 degrees C entirely recovered their reactivities with serum factors 4 and 5. 1 H-nuclear magnetic resonance analysis also revealed that B- 37 -M had lost a beta- 1, 2 -linked mannopyranose unit and retained a phosphate group. Similar changes were observed in the three other serotype B strains used in the study. The beta- 1, 2 -linked mannooligosaccharides longer than mannotetraose were not included among the products released from B- 37 -M by mild acid treatment. The results of the inhibition ELISA with a series of beta- 1, 2 -linked mannooligosaccharides from <b>biose</b> to octaose (M 2 to M 8, respectively) showed that the reactivity against serum factor 4 was inhibited most strongly by the oligosaccharides M 4 to M 8 and that the reactivity against serum factor 5 was inhibited completely by relatively longer oligosaccharides, M 5 to M 8, indicating their participation as the antigenic factor 5 epitopes...|$|E

Traditionally, only values 00h and 80h were passed on by the BIOS during boot, and many boot sectors were hard-wired to work with fixed values, anyway. The Plug and Play BIOS Specification and BIOS Boot Specification (BBS) allow other devices to become bootable as well. The later also recommends that the MBR and VBR codes use DL rather than internally hardwired defaults. (NB. MS-DOS/PC DOS and OS/2 VBRs ignore the provided DL value and instead retrieve the value stored at offset +19h in the Extended BIOS Parameter Block (EBPB) or at sector offset +1FDh in DOS versions 3.2 to 3.31. Some versions of DR-DOS use DL starting with 7.02. DR-DOS 7.07 VBRs default to use DL and ignore the BPB value, but SYS /O:nnn can be used to reinvoke the old behaviour of using the BPB value or even enforce a particular boot drive unit nnn to be stored there.

The solution was to use conversion software such as OnTrack Disk Manager, EZ Drive, etc., which installed to the disk's OS loader and replaced INT 13h routines at boot time with custom code. This software could also enable LBA and INT 13h Extensions support for older computers with non LBA-compliant <b>BIOSes.</b>|$|R
