5|$|In October 1927, Memoirs of a White Crow Indian was {{accepted}} for publication by Century, and Marquis was prompted to take down his medical practice sign. However, this was premature, as it would <b>be</b> <b>some</b> <b>time</b> before royalties were forthcoming. Lack of funds drove Marquis to continue seeing patients and carrying out insurance medical examinations. He also needed to borrow money from relatives and cash in his war risk insurance policy. Memoirs of a White Crow Indian was published in April 1928 and received good reviews.|$|E
5|$|The CSBS and the {{improved}} version, the Mk. X were insufficient, as both were {{too large to}} easily stabilize. Because {{of the way it}} was built, the Automatic Bomb Sight could be equipped with a stabilizer but it was estimated that it would <b>be</b> <b>some</b> <b>time</b> before it could be modified and brought into production. The Norden did offer stabilization but it also required relatively long setup times and was still not available for purchase.|$|E
5|$|Evans' {{contributions}} to steam {{were not as}} ground-breaking as his earlier work in milling but he {{played a critical role}} by inventing and propagating the high-pressure steam engine in the United States. Evans' engines, particularly the Columbian, were highly influential in early steam-power applications in United States (particularly in the evolution of steamboats and steam-powered industrial processes). Yet once more Evans was ahead of the curve with many of his ideas, and his death during steam's infancy in the United States meant that it would <b>be</b> <b>some</b> <b>time</b> before many of his ideas would come to fruition. For example, although a leading advocate for high-pressure engines, it would not be until the 1830s that such engines definitively replaced low-pressure designs. And Evans' dream of a steam wagon, notwithstanding the brave attempt of the Oruktor Amphibolos, would not see widespread adoption until even later. And unlike his earlier contributions, Evans was just one of many brilliant minds in steam technology. It would be another inventor, Richard Trevithick, working totally independently of Evans who would develop the high-pressure engine that would make that dream possible.|$|E

5|$|In 1963, the Michigan State Highway Department petitioned AASHO {{to again}} {{make the change}} it had {{requested}} back in 1958, moving I-96 over I-196 to end at Muskegon and renumbering I-96 west of Grand Rapids to I-67. The state cited problems with destination signing and numerous complaints from the public about confusion caused by the numbering. At their October 21, 1963 meeting, AASHO approved the relocation of I-96, but rejected I-67, stating that the number should be kept for a more major route in case the system is expanded, and instead assigned I-196 to the not-yet-complete Benton Harbor–Grand Rapids highway. The signage was switched in January 1964. With the scheduled completion of the Lodge Freeway on October 29, 1964, a full freeway route was available from I-96 into downtown Detroit via I-696 and the Lodge, but it would <b>be</b> <b>some</b> <b>time</b> before I-96 was finished into the city.|$|E
25|$|Unfortunately {{it would}} also <b>be</b> <b>some</b> <b>time</b> before the changes were {{effective}} in resolving the staff morale problems born during the station's recent turbulent years. The most public manifestation of the station's morale woes came in 1992, when DJ Dani Elwell resigned from the station by reading her résumé live over the air. But the 1990s were also a period of revival and sowing seeds of growth for the station. In addition {{to the growth of}} the Humble & Fred morning show, Jason Barr also joined the station at this time and would go on to become a significant contributor to CFNY.|$|E
25|$|In {{a recent}} study (published May 1, 2013), it is {{suggested}} that the inflammation of the hypothalamus may be connected to our overall aging bodies. They focused on the activation of the protein complex NF-κB in mice test subjects, which showed increased activation as mice test subjects aged in the study. This activation not only affects aging, but affects a hormone known as GnRH, which has shown new anti-aging properties when injected into mice outside the hypothalamus, while causing the opposite effect when injected into the hypothalamus. It'll <b>be</b> <b>some</b> <b>time</b> before this can be applied to humans in a meaningful way, as more studies on this pathway are necessary to understand the mechanics of GnRH's anti-aging properties.|$|E

25|$|The Central Plains Water Trust then {{appealed the}} {{decision}} to the High Court {{on the grounds that}} as they had applied first their priority to the water should be upheld, {{in spite of the fact}} that a decision would <b>be</b> <b>some</b> <b>time</b> in the future. The High Court agreed with the Environment Court that priority to a limited resource went to the applications that were ready to be 'notifiable' first, not the applicant who applied first. That decision confirmed that Ngāi Tahu Properties Limited would be able to take water under their consents from the Waimakariri River at a more optimal minimum flow than any later consent granted to Central Plains Water Trust.|$|E
25|$|The Revolution {{permanently}} ended {{any chance}} of Catholicism becoming re-established in England. For British Catholics its effects were disastrous both socially and politically: Catholics were {{denied the right to}} vote and sit in the Westminster Parliament for over a century; they were also denied commissions in the army, and the monarch was forbidden to be Catholic or to marry a Catholic, this latter prohibition remaining in force until 2015. The Revolution led to limited tolerance for Nonconformist Protestants, although it would <b>be</b> <b>some</b> <b>time</b> before they had full political rights. It has been argued, mainly by Whig historians, that James's overthrow began modern English parliamentary democracy: the Bill of Rights 1689 {{has become one of the}} most important documents in the political history of Britain and never since has the monarch held absolute power.|$|E
25|$|The {{first three}} layers of {{modeling}} {{are used to}} determine the long-term, or Time Independent, estimates of the magnitude, location, and frequency of potentially damaging earthquakes in California. The Time Dependent model is based on the theory of elastic rebound, that after an earthquake releases tectonic stress there will <b>be</b> <b>some</b> <b>time</b> before sufficient stress accumulates to cause another earthquake. In theory, this should produce some regularity in the earthquakes on a given fault, and knowing the date of the last rupture is a clue to how soon the next one can be expected. In practice this is not so clear, in part because slip rates vary, and also because fault segments influence each other, so a rupture on one segment triggers rupturing on adjacent segments. One of the achievements of UCERF3 is to better handle such multifault ruptures.|$|E

500|$|McNamara {{attempted}} to short-circuit deployment in early 1966 {{by stating that}} the only program that had any reasonable cost-effectiveness was the thin defense against the Chinese, and then noted there was no rush to build such a system as it would <b>be</b> <b>some</b> <b>time</b> before they had an ICBM. Overruling him, Congress provided $167.9 million ($ billion in [...] ) for immediate production of the original Nike-X concept. McNamara and Johnson met on the issue on 3 November 1966, and McNamara once again convinced Johnson that the system could not justify the cost of deployment. McNamara headed off the expected counterattack from Romney by calling a press conference {{on the topic of}} Soviet ABMs and stating that the new Minuteman III and Poseidon SLBM would ensure the Soviet system would be overwhelmed.|$|E
500|$|The ban expired {{the week}} ending 30 May 2008, with the {{conviction}} of Goussis {{for the murder of}} Lewis Moran, paving the way for Nine to begin screening episodes; however, Andrew Rule, who co-wrote the book on which the series is based, says Underbelly will not be seen in Victoria anytime soon, saying [...] "the problem now will be that Tony Mokbel is back in Australia and ready to stand trial on very serious charges. That will effectively prevent the series being screened in Victoria until that trial is held... That could <b>be</b> <b>some</b> <b>time.</b> I'm not sure about several , but it might be two years." [...] However, Underbelly was legally shown in Victoria in September 2008, after a court ruled that the network could air the first five episodes. Supreme Court Justice Peter Vickery gave the network permission to air the specially edited episodes, but said screening the sixth episode could prejudice the upcoming trials of an accused criminal. The edited versions had whole scenes cut out, and Tony Mokbel's face was pixelated. Reactions from viewers were not favourable, mainly because most had already seen the entire series.|$|E
500|$|On October 31, 1907, the Ferguson Trust Board voted Taft a commission, and on December 16, {{he signed}} a $38,000 {{contract}} to commence work. [...] The commission was the first commission from the Ferguson fund. Despite the financial agreement it would <b>be</b> <b>some</b> <b>time</b> before a determination of a site for the work. [...] Ward's suit continued to loom over the deliberations. [...] One proposal was to locate it in Grant Park south of the Art Institute and another was to locate it at the 35th Street and Grand Boulevard (Now Martin Luther King, Jr. Drive) intersection that now hosts the Chicago Landmark and National Register of Historic Places-listed Victory Monument. The 1909 Art Institute annual report mentioned {{a proposal for a}} sunken garden with a focal fountain south of the Institute. [...] Legal issues regarding land use intensified in 1910, and the Art Institute began to make modest plans for the fountain almost attached to the south wall of its own building. [...] For the next few years there was little mention of the fountain as Taft focused on other work. Then in May 1913, the fountain model at Taft's Midway Studios was disassembled and taken to Jules Berchem's foundry for bronze casting. [...] Shepley, Rutan and Coolidge designed the base for the sculpture. [...] It was subsequently assembled by mid-August in preparation for a September 9, 1913 dedication date.|$|E

2500|$|In {{veterinary}} medicine, sodium thiopental is used {{to induce}} anesthesia in animals.

[...] Conversely, obese animals will have rapid recoveries, but it will <b>be</b> <b>some</b> <b>time</b> before it is entirely removed (metabolized) from their bodies. Sodium thiopental is always administered intravenously, {{as it can be}} fairly irritating; severe tissue necrosis and sloughing can occur if it is injected incorrectly into the tissue around a vein.|$|E
