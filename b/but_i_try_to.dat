500|$|Meat Loaf {{says that}} he does not enjoy {{recording}} in studios. He compares the process to [...] "going to the dentist and having root canal everyday". Whereas you really have to be flat for people to notice it in a live show, in a studio, every [...] "nuance is under a microscope... and I'm a perfectionist who knows that there's no such thing as perfection <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> get as close as I can." ...|$|E
2500|$|Breslow {{was born}} in New Haven, Connecticut, and raised in Trumbull, Connecticut. [...] He is Jewish, and {{attended}} Hebrew school. [...] His family attended Congregation B'nai Israel in Bridgeport, Connecticut, where he had his bar mitzvah in 1993. [...] He has fasted while pitching on Yom Kippur, and noted: [...] "Being Jewish is more difficult in baseball ... <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> do what I can in terms of paying attention to holidays." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not a great deal. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> {{make enough}} {{to pay the rent}} and store bills. May I ask {{what you are going to}} do in New York?" ...|$|E
60|$|I {{felt that}} he was unanswerable, here; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> argue the question, nevertheless.|$|R
60|$|I made {{no answer}} <b>to</b> that, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> show him by my bearing that I {{was ready for}} the worst which could befall me.|$|R
5000|$|Regarding the EP's track listing, Tatum noted, [...] "Some of {{the songs}} are very poppy <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> make them stranger, awkward or weird at certain points." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not quite," [...] he answered. [...] "I'll {{confess that}} I'm not {{satisfied}} yet, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> {{make the most}} of the good things that come along--and I'm glad I got up early. It's a glorious morning!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, stand ye {{on these}} terms?" [...] said the boy. [...] "Well, I care not greatly about the matter--only, I never smell out a secret <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> be {{either at the}} right or {{the wrong end of}} it, and so good evening to ye." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'January 28th.--The nine young Christians were baptized on Sunday evening; a very {{touching}} and solemn service it was, very full of comfort. It {{may be that}} now, in full swing of work, I am too sanguine, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> be sober-minded, thankful, and hopeful. I try, I say--it is not easy.|$|E
6000|$|... 'No,' I protested, 'I {{hated her}} and despised her; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> forget you; and I {{wanted you to}} feel certain that I no longer cared for you.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, <b>I</b> know. <b>But</b> {{she never}} was equal to him. I saw {{that from the}} start; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> blind myself to it. And when he kept coming----" ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{fixed the}} floor. There indeed <b>I</b> was. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> stay there--just there only--as {{short a time}} as possible. Something, moreover, after all, caught me up. [...] "But if Brissenden already knew----?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We'll let Grace's notion go. My form {{is not my}} step-children's, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> {{moderate}} my {{remarks about}} women. We'll admit Grace is a woman, although I sometimes doubt. Anyhow, {{you are not a}} man; you haven't a drop of warm blood in your veins! You're a curled and scented fine lady's lap-dog pup!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh! yes--I {{know she}} thinks {{a good deal}} of that, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> set her heart at ease, poor, dear, old grandmother, for it's of no use to be {{distressing}} herself about me! I can take care of myself well enough, and have plenty of friends who will never see me want. Father's sisters say they'll take care of me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't {{allow it}} to do that. A detective is a man, you know, much like other men, and I have always held that the better man he is the better detective he is sure to prove. I'm obliged to do disagreeable things, at times, in the {{fulfillment}} of my duty, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> spare even the most hardened criminal as much as possible. So why shouldn't I be kind to a helpless, unfortunate girl?" ...|$|E
60|$|We {{were all}} on the alert. There was a pause; a deep breath. I was horribly frightened, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> look calm. Then sharp and quick came the one word 'Go!' And like arrows from a bow, off we all started.|$|R
6000|$|Pulling himself together, Dick {{gave her}} a steady look. [...] "I can't let that pass, though if I begin to argue I'm lost. In a way, I'm at your mercy, because my defense can only make matters worse. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> explain on board the launch." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps it was wrong, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> do right. <b>I</b> wasn't sure, no {{one said}} anything, and I hoped I was mistaken. It would have been selfish to frighten you all when Marmee was so anxious about Meg, and Amy away, and you so happy with Laurie--at least I thought so then." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now see here, Mrs. Haney, I'm not {{displaying}} {{these to}} you as a salesman--not that I'm so very delicate about offering my things, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> wait till a second visit." [...] He really did feel mean about it. [...] "Don't take 'em--wait till to-morrow. They're pretty middling bad anyway. They're supposed to be mountain lions, but {{as a matter of fact}} I never saw a mountain lion outside the Zoo." ...|$|E
6000|$|When he had {{fastened}} himself securely, {{which he}} did with great rapidity, the man spoke, saying, [...] "Your Majesty has found us as busy as ever. The fact is, these animals and cars and merry-go-rounds run down very quickly, and they require so much attention {{that this is the}} first time we have been hooked together since early this morning. It is the same every day, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> do my duty, and you will find this Valley in good condition and everything properly cared for." ...|$|E
6000|$|He comes {{every day}} to paint and we talk a great deal and he [...] reads me lovely things out of his books. I don't {{understand}} [...] them all, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>to,</b> and he explains them so nicely and is [...] so patient with my stupidity. And he says any one with my [...] eyes and hair and coloring {{does not need to}} be clever. He [...] says I have the sweetest, merriest laugh in the world. But I [...] will not write down all the compliments he has paid me. I [...] dare say he does not mean them at all.|$|E
6000|$|... "And I've been {{praising the}} beauties of Indian Art all my days." [...] It {{was a little}} disappointing {{when you come to}} think of it, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> console myself by the thought that the two lay so far apart there was no {{comparison}} possible. And yet accuracy is surely the touchstone of all Art.|$|R
40|$|This was a rush job on a {{spontaneous}} trip. It {{was not possible}} to stay long or to meet with just one person. The whole recording is rather chaotic. There were too many people <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> speak just with a few. Sonny Djonler was there to help as interpreter and to provide input. Recording and scan of transcription included...|$|R
6000|$|... "The name? Gian was wont to make {{bad work}} of our honest German names, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> learn this--being so beholden to him. I even {{caused it to}} be spelt over to me, but my letters long ago went from me. It {{seems to me that}} the man is a knight-errant, like those of thy ballads, Stine--one Ritter Theur--Theur--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{think this}} power {{of living in}} our {{children}} {{is one of the}} sweetest things in the world; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> remember what Marmee once said to Meg--that fathers should have their share in the education of both girls and boys; so I leave Ted to his father all I can, and Fritz lends me Rob, whose quiet ways are as restful and good for me as Ted's tempests are for his father. Now I advise you, Amy, to let Bess drop the mud-pies for a time, and take up music with Laurie; then she won't be one-sided, and he won't be jealous.' ...|$|E
6000|$|As soon as {{they were}} alone, and the door closed, Thomasin said, turning up her pale, tearful face to him, [...] "It is killing me, this, Damon! I did not mean to part from you in anger at Anglebury this morning; but I was frightened, and hardly knew what I said. I've not let aunt know how much I have {{suffered}} to-day; and it is so hard to command my face and voice, and to smile {{as if it were a}} slight thing to me; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> do so, that she may not be still more indignant with you. I know you could not help it, dear, whatever aunt may think." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have now}} {{finished}} correcting the proofs of my little Volume of Poems. It {{has been a}} great plague to me, and one that I would not have incurred, had I expected to be laid up as I have been; but the matter was begun before I had any notion of being disabled by such an illness,--the severest I have suffered since I went to the West Indies. The Book will, after all, be a botched business in many respects; and I much doubt whether it will pay its expenses: <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> consider it as out of my hands, and not to fret myself about it. I shall be very curious to see Carlyle's Tractate on Chartism; which"--But we need not enter upon that.|$|E
40|$|My {{thesis is}} about {{strategy}} generation and its {{importance for the}} company. In the theoretical part, <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> emphasize {{the main purpose of}} the analysis and indicate their strengths and weaknesses. In the practical part, I worked out and evaluated the process of generation Mary Kay strategy. <b>I</b> was not <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> generate a new concept of the strategy, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> figure out why this strategy, which has been unchanged for many years, is so successful...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't understand; though I {{think you}} {{explained}} somewhat a year ago"--the poor gentleman gave it up. [...] "I think {{she wanted to}} speak to me--of any intentions I might have in regard to you--the day she was here. Very nicely, very properly she'd have done it, I'm sure. I think her idea was that I ought to make any settlement quite independent of your marrying her or not marrying her. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> convey to her--I don't know whether she understood me--that I liked her too much for that, I wanted too much to make sure of her." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "I wish I {{could be}} as {{straightforward}} as you, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> always <b>try</b> <b>to</b> get along with everyone.", insinuating an overbearing attitude.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] she answered, thoughtfully, [...] "I {{told you}} Lisha {{was a smart}} man; he give me a good lesson, and it set me to thinkin' serious. 'Pears to me trouble {{is a kind of}} mellerin' process, and ef you take it kindly it doos you good, and you learn to be glad of it.

I ain't what I ought to be, not by a long chalk, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> live up to my light, do my duty cheerful, love my neighbors, and fetch up my family in the fear of God. Ef I do this the best way I know how, I'm sure I'll get my rest some day, and the good Lord won't forgit Cynthy Wilkins. He ain't so fur, for I keep my health wonderfle, Lisha is kind and stiddy, the {{children}} flourishin', and I'm a happy woman though I be a humly one." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I do {{hope the}} rest of us won't catch the measles. It must look horrid to have red spots all over your face. We all feel pretty well yet. The Story Girl says as many queer things as ever. Felix thinks he is getting thin, but he is fatter than ever, and no wonder, with all the apples he eats. He has give up trying to eat the bitter apples at last. Beverley has grown half an inch since July, by the mark on the hall door, and he is awful pleased about it. I told him I guessed the magic seed was taking effect at last, and he got mad. He never gets mad at {{anything}} the Story Girl says, and yet she is so sarkastic by times. Dan is pretty hard to get along with as usul, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> bear pashently with him. Cecily is well and says she isn't going to curl her hair any more. She is so conscienshus. I am glad my hair curls of itself, ain't you? ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'My own temptation {{consists}} perhaps chiefly in {{the love}} of reading for its own sake. I do honestly think that for a considerable time past I have read, I believe, nothing which I {{do not expect to}} be of real use, for I have no taste naturally for novels, &c. (without, however,, wishing to deny that there may be novels which teach a real insight into character). Barring [...] "I Promessi Sposi" [...] which I take up very seldom when tired, I have not read one for ages: I must except [...] "Old Mortality," [...] read last Vacation at Feniton; but I can't deny that I like the study of languages for its own sake, though I apply my little experience in it wholly to the interpretation of the Bible. I like improving my scholarship, it is true, but I can say honestly that it is used to read the Greek Testament with greater accuracy: so of the Hebrew, Syriac, Arabic. I feel, I confess, sometimes that it is nice, &c., to know several languages, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> drive away any such thoughts, and it is quite astonishing how, after a few weeks, a study which would suggest ideas of an unusual course of reading becomes so familiar that I never think of myself when pursuing it, e.g., I don't think that after two hours' grind at Arabic the stupid wrong feeling of its being an out-of-the-way study comes upon me now, it is getting quite natural. It comes out though when I talk or write perhaps with another, but I must try and get over it.|$|E
5000|$|You {{can explain}} {{to people who}} don't know much of the physics, the early history... how Newton discovered...
