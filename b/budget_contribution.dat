40|$|Abstract. The {{economy of}} the European Union has not {{recovered}} from {{the impact of the}} economic and financial crisis. Growth rates remain low and investment activity is weak. This questions current economic policies of the Economic and Monetary Union, known as austerity. In opposition to fiscal contraction measures, expansive fiscal action policies are often called for to initiate economic recovery. But the national interests of austerity’s main proponent, performed in an asymmetric intergovernmental bargaining arena, render most of the proposed expansive action plans impossible and hence austerity is expected to prevail. The Juncker-Plan constitutes an expansive action plan which respects the restrictive budgetary rules. Nevertheless an investment volume of 315 billion Euro should be made available, enabled by 21 billion Euro of public money. The <b>budget</b> <b>contribution</b> should lever private funds by a multiplier of 15. The crucial factor of 15 rests on experience with Synergetic Financial Instruments which have been increasingly executed during the last budget period.

40|$|Effects of {{convective}} {{and mechanical}} turbulence at the entrainment zone are studied {{through the use}} of systematic Large-Eddy Simulation (LES) experiments. Five LES experiments with different shear characteristics in the quasi-steady barotropic boundary layer were conducted by increasing the value of the constant geostrophic wind by 5 m s- 1 until the geostrophic wind was equal to 20 m s- 1. The main result of this sensitivity analysis is that the convective boundary layer deepens with increasing wind speed due to the enhancement of the entrainment heat flux by the presence of shear. Regarding the evolution of the turbulence kinetic energy (TKE) budget for the studied cases, the following conclusions are drawn: (i) dissipation increases with shear, (ii) the transport and pressure terms decrease with increasing shear and can become a destruction term at the entrainment zone, and (iii) the time tendency of TKE remains small in all analyzed cases. Convective and local scaling arguments are applied to parameterize the TKE budget terms. Depending on the physical properties of each TKE <b>budget</b> <b>contribution,</b> two types of scaling parameters have been identified. For the processes influenced by mixed-layer properties, boundary layer depth and convective velocity have been used as scaling variables.

40|$|Numerous {{studies have}} portrayed Britain as an ‘awkward’, ‘reluctant’ and ‘semi-detached’ European Union (EU) member {{state that has}} been ‘at odds with Europe’ (George, 1998; Gowland and Turner, 2000; Wallace, 1997). It has even been {{suggested}} that Britain is an ‘allergic European’ (Aspinwall, 2004). Such views have been shaped by Britain’s unwillingness {{to participate in the}} initial steps towards European integration in the 1950 s and its inability to offer wholehearted commitment to the European project since its accession in 1973. A review of British ‘awkwardness’ since 1973 includes the 1974 renegotiation of terms of membership, the 1975 referendum on the renegotiated terms, the debate over the <b>budget</b> <b>contributions</b> that was eventually settled at the 1984 Fontainebleau European Council, hostility towards the development of a European social policy and Economic and Monetary Union, the 1996 policy of non-cooperation over the ban on British beef, and the inability of the Labour government led by Tony Blair to fully endorse the single currency. A direct implication of these developments is that Britain has often been perceived to be on the sidelines of key policy developments at the European level. This chapter explores a particular dimension of Britain’s European policy by focusing on government behaviour in the intergovernmental conference (IGC) negotiations that have resulted in the Single European Act (SEA), Treaty on European Union, Treaty of Amsterdam, Treaty of Nice, and finally the Constitutional Treaty. The chapter argues that despite the hesitancy of British governments to offer a wholehearted commitment to European integration, Britain has achieved considerable success in obtaining satisfactory outcomes in IGC negotiations. In taking this approach, the chapter emphasises Britain’s unique position within the EU and focuses {{on the extent to which}} it can be considered ‘a laggard leader. ...|$|R
40|$|New feature: frequentist fits & profile likelihoods The {{major new}} {{feature in the}} release is the {{addition}} of frequentist fits to complement the Bayesian fits that have existed ever since v 0. 5. This allows to do analyses with both Bayesian and frequentist statistics in a single framework. To determine frequentist confidence levels {{in one or two}} dimensions, there is a new profile likelihood fitter. In two dimensions, the results can be visualized using the existing contour plot function, while for one-dimensional p-value distributions, there is a new plot function pvalue_plot (which was inspired by the pretty plots generated by the GammaCombo package). On this occasion, the documentation of fits & fitters has been overhauled completely. See in particular the new introduction to inference in flavio, the extended discussion of Bayesian fits, and the new discussion of frequentist fits. There is also a new notebook in the flavio examples repository demonstrating the use of the new fitter and plots. Other improvements A major limitation of the sm_error_budget function and its visualization error_budget_pie to display error budgets of SM predictions has been removed: previously, the error <b>budget</b> <b>contributions</b> were obtained by individually varying each parameter one by one; this lead to misleading results in case some of the parameters are strongly correlated. This applies for instance to angular observables in B→Vll decays, where uncertainties partially drop out in ratios. The new version now groups together all correlated parameters into common slices of the pie. The top quark mass dependence in the matching condition of the Wilson coefficient C 10 is now approximately taken into account (previously, it was taken as a constant).
