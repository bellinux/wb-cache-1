60|$|Ann Veronica {{took that}} in silence. At the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>mind,</b> dim and yet disconcerting, was the {{perception}} that she herself {{did not know what}} she wanted. And yet she knew it was not fair to call her a foolish girl.|$|E
60|$|But {{she watched}} him as he moved round the table more in curiosity now than in fright. He puzzled her, and she still had a feeling at the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>mind</b> {{that there must be}} {{something}} more definite and more evil lurking at the back of that tortuous brain.|$|E
60|$|Tallente made no reply. He was {{standing}} on the hearth rug, {{a few feet away from}} her, watching as she stirred her milk, watching the curve of her body, the grace of her long, smoothly shining arms. And beyond these things he strove to read what was at the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>mind.</b>|$|E
60|$|Cora laughed, {{but gave}} no further {{evidence}} of the state <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>mind.</b>|$|R
60|$|La Fleur {{smiled at}} Mike's philosophy, and applied his {{information}} to the comfort <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>mind.</b>|$|R
60|$|The habits <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>mind,</b> the {{government}} <b>of</b> <b>her</b> conduct, her life-long reputation, all {{were those of}} a literal, exact truthfulness.|$|R
60|$|There {{was only}} one little thing at the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>mind</b> that alloyed her sense of happy and {{complete}} living that night, {{and that was the}} ghost of an addition sum. At home, in her pretty bureau, a little gathering pile of bills, as yet unpaid, and an empty cheque-book with appealing counterfoils, awaited her attention.|$|E
60|$|It was {{an awkward}} meeting, though Lister {{was the only one}} whose embarrassment was noticeable. His companions were {{watching}} Desmond quietly, though Mrs. Ratcliffe was sensible that this was the last man she would have desired to see. He had come back from Africa and might spoil everything, for at the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>mind</b> she was not quite sure of her daughter. Still, though it cost her an effort, she asked him a few questions.|$|E
60|$|In {{this era}} of {{bubbling}} joy, it was hard that Sally, the fairy godmother responsible for it all, {{should not have been}} completely happy too; and it puzzled her why she was not. But whatever it was that cast the faint shadow refused obstinately to come out from the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>mind</b> and show itself and be challenged. It was not till she was out driving in a hired car with Gerald one afternoon on Belle Isle that enlightenment came.|$|E
60|$|She hesitated and smiled. That terribly close guess of {{hers was}} not out <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>mind</b> yet.|$|R
60|$|She made no answer; {{she looked}} before {{her as if}} she were going out <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>mind.</b>|$|R
60|$|Waverley, {{with a voice}} {{interrupted}} by suffocating sensations, gave some account of the state <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>mind.</b>|$|R
60|$|She had {{not given}} up all {{thoughts}} of pleading yet; though she knew that for the moment she had failed, there floated vaguely at the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>mind</b> a dim hope that God would not abandon her in this her bitterest need. He had helped her in her direst trouble; He had averted the hideous treachery which threatened to stain her father's honoured name and her own with a hideous mark of shame; surely He would not allow this last most terrible crime to be committed.|$|E
60|$|For a second, she {{struggled}} frenziedly. But almost instantly she recognized how much stronger he was, {{and she was}} still, mute and motionless with anger. White, and mute, and motionless, she was taken to her room. And at the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>mind</b> all the time she wondered at his deliberate recklessness of her. Recklessly, he had his will of her--but deliberately, and thoroughly, not rushing to the issue, but taking everything he wanted of her, progressively, and fully, leaving her stark, with nothing, nothing of herself--nothing.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{believe in}} the bed, in the photographs, in the pot, in the balcony, in the sun, in Mrs. Flushing," [...] she remarked, still {{speaking}} recklessly, with something at the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>mind</b> forcing her to say the things that one usually does not say. [...] "But I don't believe in God, I don't believe in Mr. Bax, I don't {{believe in the}} hospital nurse. I don't believe--" [...] She took up a photograph and, looking at it, did not finish her sentence.|$|E
60|$|The agony <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>mind</b> {{disappointed}} <b>her</b> husband's hope <b>of</b> an heir, and {{the promise}} was never renewed.|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Bebberley Cumble thrust a very pardonable {{sense of}} {{exasperation}} {{into the background}} <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>mind</b> and demanded impatiently: ...|$|R
60|$|Ast. If {{you dare}} trust my {{knowledge}} <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>mind,</b> She has no thoughts {{of you that}} are unkind.|$|R
60|$|She had {{released}} Mr. Polly {{from the}} irksome duty of issuing invitations, {{and as the}} moments of assembly drew near she sent him and Mr. Johnson out into the narrow long strip of garden {{at the back of}} the house, to be free to put a finishing touch or so to her preparations. She sent them out together because she had a queer little persuasion at the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>mind</b> that Mr. Polly wanted to bolt from his sacred duties, and there was no way out of the garden except through the house.|$|E
60|$|Alison did {{not answer}} {{for a moment or}} two. She felt that she was acting imprudently in {{allowing}} herself to be drawn into the affair, but she was sorry for the man. He was a friend of Thorne's, and that counted for a good deal in his favor. In addition to this, the idea of playing a part, and possibly a leading part, in something of the nature of a complicated drama appealed to her, and there was, half formulated at the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>mind,</b> the desire to prove to Thorne just what she was capable of.|$|E
60|$|As Honora danced, Chiltern {{remained}} in the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>mind,</b> or rather an indefinite impression was there which in flashes she connected with him. She wondered, at times, {{what had become of}} him, and once or twice she caught herself scanning the bewildering, shifting sheen of gowns and jewels for his face. At last she saw him by the windows, holding a favour in his hand, coming in her direction. She looked away, towards the red uniforms of the Hungarian band on the raised platform {{at the end of the}} room. He was standing beside her.|$|E
60|$|She stopped. There was {{a corner}} <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>mind</b> into {{which she could}} not admit any one, even Ruth.|$|R
60|$|The {{wavering}} <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>mind</b> {{was visible}} in her tell-tale face. He noticed it, and caught at the opportunity.|$|R
60|$|Cel. She {{will accept}} on't, and she shall accept on't: I think I {{know more than}} you <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>mind,</b> sir.|$|R
60|$|And so, {{in spite}} of everything, poverty, dowdiness, obscurity, and nothingness, she was content to stay in {{abeyance}} at home for the time. True, she {{was filled with the}} same old, slow, dreadful craving of the Midlands: a craving insatiable and inexplicable. But the very craving kept her still. For at this time she did not translate it into a desire, or need, for love. At the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>mind</b> somewhere was the fixed idea, the fixed intention of finding love, a man. But as yet, at this period, the idea was in abeyance, it did not act. The craving that possessed her as it possesses everybody, in a greater or less degree, in those parts, sustained her darkly and unconsciously.|$|E
60|$|She {{tried to}} think of some altered state of affairs in which these monstrous {{limitations}} would be alleviated, in which women would stand on their own feet in equal citizenship with men. For a time she brooded on the ideals and suggestions of the Socialists, on the vague intimations of an Endowment of Motherhood, of a complete relaxation of that intense individual dependence for women which is woven into the existing social order. At the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>mind</b> there seemed always one irrelevant qualifying spectator whose presence she sought to disregard. She would not look at him, would not think of him; when her mind wavered, then she muttered to herself in the darkness so as to keep hold of her generalizations.|$|E
60|$|January found Ann Veronica {{a student}} in the {{biological}} laboratory of the Central Imperial College that towers up from among the back streets in the angle between Euston Road and Great Portland Street. She was working very steadily at the Advanced Course in Comparative Anatomy, wonderfully relieved to have her mind engaged upon one methodically developing theme in the place of the discursive uncertainties of the previous two months, and doing her utmost to keep right in the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>mind</b> and out of sight the facts, firstly, that she had achieved this haven of satisfactory activity by incurring a debt to Ramage of forty pounds, and, secondly, that her present position was necessarily temporary and her outlook quite uncertain.|$|E
60|$|Dim {{possibilities}} {{that she would}} not seem to look at even to herself gesticulated in the twilight background <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>mind.</b>|$|R
2500|$|The story <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>mind</b> control claims was {{featured}} in an episode of [...] in a segment entitled [...] "Sexy Secret Agent".|$|R
50|$|The General {{picture of}} the Goddess depicts a Parrot and a Sugarcane stick with her. Sugarcane {{represents}} the sweetness <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>mind.</b>|$|R
60|$|Jill {{could not}} have said whether she was glad or sorry. She had not seen Wally since that {{afternoon}} when they had lunched together at the Cosmopolis, and the rush of the final weeks of rehearsals had given her little opportunity for thinking of him. At the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>mind</b> had been the feeling {{that sooner or later}} she would have to think of him, but for two weeks she had been too tired and too busy to re-examine him as a factor in her life. There had been times when the thought of him had been like the sunshine on a winter day, warming her with almost an impersonal glow in moments of depression. And then some sharp, poignant memory of Derek would come to blot him out.|$|E
60|$|Long {{before the}} family stirred next morning, his horses fed and {{harnessed}} by lantern light, breakfast cooked and eaten by lamp fight, Old Man Tarwater was off and away down Tarwater Valley {{on the road}} to Kelterville. Two things were unusual about this usual trip which he had made a thousand and forty times since taking the mail contract. He did not drive to Kelterville, but turned off on the main road south to Santa Rosa. Even more remarkable than this was the paper-wrapped parcel between his feet. It contained his one decent black suit, which Mary had been long reluctant to see him wear any more, not because it was shabby, but because, as he guessed what was at the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>mind,</b> it was decent enough to bury him in.|$|E
60|$|Close by, {{a narrow}} flight of steps hewn {{out of the}} {{dripping}} rock led down into the ravine, and she watched with a curious sense of strained expectancy the path which wound among the silvery birches from the foot {{of them to the}} mossy stepping-stones round which the Barrock flashed. She knew this was unwise, and that she could not escape from what lay before her, but hope dies hard when one is young, and there was still lurking at the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>mind</b> a faint belief that after all something might happen to stave off the impending disaster. If so, it would be only fitting that it should result from the efforts of the man in whom she had once had faith and confidence, though neither now was so strong as it had been.|$|E
60|$|Alph. Who knows {{which way}} she points? Doubling and turning like an hunted hare;-- Find out the meaning <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>mind</b> who can.|$|R
60|$|But he didn't. He {{discovered}} nothing; and {{she went}} home jubilant, and dropped all concern about the matter permanently out <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>mind.</b>|$|R
60|$|She was silent, {{and looked}} wonderingly, a little fearfully, at him, as if vague, {{disturbing}} thoughts were entering the fringe <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>mind.</b>|$|R
