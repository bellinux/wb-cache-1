40|$|An {{analytical}} model of dispersive pulse propagation in semi-infinite cylinders due to transient axially symmetric end conditions has been experimentally investigated. Specifically, the dispersive propagation {{of the first}} axially symmetric longitudinal mode in thin wire waveguides, which have ends in <b>butt</b> <b>contact</b> with longitudinal piezoelectric ultrasonic transducers, is examined. The method allows for prediction of a propagated waveform given a measured source waveform, together with the material properties of the cylinder. Alternatively, the source waveform can be extracted from measurement of the propagated waveform. The material properties required for implementation of the pulse propagation model are determined using guided wave phase velocity measurements. Hard tempered aluminum 1100 and 304 stainless steel wires, with 127, 305, and 406 micron diam., were examined. In general, the drawn wires were found to behave as transversely isotropic media...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a detailed analysis}} of CMOS latchup dependencies on layout and geometrical dimensions. To this purpose test structures have been fabricated featuring <b>butted</b> <b>contacts</b> and guard rings with different values of critical distances. The devices have been experimentally characterized in the triggering and sustaining regime, and numerical simulations have been extensively used to interpret the experimental data. It is shown that great care should be taken in designing protection structures since larger areas do not always lead to enhanced latchup immunity...|$|R
50|$|Some {{designs of}} vacuum {{interrupter}} have simple <b>butt</b> <b>contacts,</b> but generally the contacts are shaped {{to improve their}} ability to break very heavy currents. Slots, ridges, or grooves are formed in the contacts. Arc current flowing through the shaped contacts generate magnetic forces on the arc column which cause the arc contact spot to move rapidly {{over the surface of}} the contact. This reduces contact wear due to erosion by the arc, which melts the contact metal at the point of contact.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to try and understand hypercompressor packing ring failures better with a view of ultimately reducing or even eliminating their occurrences. In order to gain further understanding of packing ring failures, we seek to obtain an appreciation of the stresses they experience during operation. First we consider a conventional simulation of an axisymmetric packing ring and cup subjected to the typical pressure loading conditions experienced by these components when installed in a hypercompressor cylinder. The key locations of interest are along the bimaterial interface, and in particular at the ends of the interface. These ends effectively represent a <b>butt</b> joint in <b>contact</b> and a <b>butt</b> joint under pressure. To begin to gain an appreciation of the stresses at these locations, we undertake a finite element analysis (FEA) of the configuration with traditional interface and contact conditions. Unfortunately the traditional analysis does not produce stresses that appear to converge at either end as judged by simple convergence checks. As is indicated by previous research, a singularity is expected to occur at the butt joint under pressure, and thus diverging stresses. However, for the <b>butt</b> joint in <b>contact</b> the situation is les...|$|R
5000|$|He makes {{a stop at}} a {{newsstand}} {{to pick up the}} Orange County Register, {{and begins}} talking to an older man, whom he suspects to be a police officer. Bonin, frustrated, returns home and finds the same mysterious car is stalking his home. He tries to <b>contact</b> <b>Butts,</b> but he wonâ€™t pick up. Bonin accosts Kyle at night after work, and attempts to convince him to throw off police by committing [...] "one last murder". Kyle refuses, however, and takes off with Lisa in his new car.|$|R
