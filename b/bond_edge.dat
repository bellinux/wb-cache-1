40|$|OBJECTIVES: Differences in {{mechanical}} properties between adherents and adhesive result in stress singularity at the free edge for tensile test specimens. Beyond causing premature failures, these also trigger fracture initiation at the <b>bond</b> <b>edge,</b> where {{the use of}} the maximum stress at failure as a measure of strength is not a reliable parameter for obtaining bond strength. The aim {{of this study is to}} describe the pattern of stress concentration along the interface for micro-tensile bond strength (muTBS) specimens. Also, possible sources of variation in stress concentration (adhesive layer thickness and mechanical properties) were evaluated using the finite element method. METHODS: One-fourth models of typical muTBS specimens were created using axisymmetric elements. A 15 MPa load was applied at the outer edge and finite element calculations were performed within the elastic deformation range. In the first set of runs, the adhesive thickness was varied and in the second set, different nu/E ratios between the adhesive and the adherent were assigned. RESULTS: When adhesive thickness increased, a significant increase in stress concentration at the free edge and in the length of the stress-affected area was observed. Increasing the nu/E ratio between adhesive and adherent lead to an increase in stress concentration at the free edge area without change in length of the stress-affected area. SIGNIFICANCE: If mechanical properties and adhesive thickness expected for a specific composite-dentin bond combination in muTBS specimens are known, stress concentration at the interface can be predicted. The adhesive thickness should remain constant when comparing different joints, as it facilitates the interpretation of nominal strength values. status: publishe...|$|E

Mechanical properties of nonwovens related to damage such as failure stress and strain at that stress depend on deformation and damage characteristics of their constituent fibres. Damage of polypropylene-fibre commercial low-density thermally bonded nonwovens in tension was analysed with tensile tests on single fibres, extracted from nonwovens bonded at optimal manufacturing parameters and attached to individual bond points at both ends. The same tests were performed on raw polypropylene fibres that were used in manufacturing of the analysed nonwovens to study quantitatively the effect of manufacturing parameters on tenacity of fibres. Those tests were performed with a wide range of strain rates. It was found that the fibres break at their weakest point, i. e. <b>bond</b> <b>edge,</b> in optimally bonded nonwovens. Additionally, failure stress and strain in tension of a fibre extracted from the fabric were significantly lower than those of virgin fibre. Since damage in nonwovens occurs by progressive failure of fibres, those experiments were used to establish damage initiation and propagation in thermally bonded nonwovens based on polypropylene fibres. Moreover, the results obtained from the experiments are useful to simulate the damage behaviour of nonwoven fabrics...|$|E

We apply our scheme particularly to random networks of bimodal degree distribution (two-peak networks), which have been proposed in earlier studies as robust networks against random failures of site and/or targeted attacks on sites, and show that the correlations among degrees affect a network's robustness against targeted attacks on sites or bonds non-trivially depending on details of network configurations.

An array of small support pillars separates the sheets; fused solder glass forms the edge seal. Heat transfer through the glazing occurs by radiation across the vacuum gap, conduction through the support pillars, and conduction through the <b>bonded</b> <b>edge</b> seal. Edge conduction is problematic because it affects stresses in the edge region, leading to possible failure of the glazing; in addition, excessive heat transfer because of thermal bridging in the edge region can lower overall window thermal performance and decrease resistance to condensation. Infrared thermography was used to analyze the thermal performance of prototype vacuum glazings, and, for comparison, atmospheric pressure superwindows. Research focused on mitigating the edge effects of vacuum glazings through the use of insulating trim, recessed edges, and framing materials. Experimentally validated finite-element and finite-difference modeling tools were used for thermal analysis of prototype vacuum glazing units and complete windows.

The {{stress and}} {{displacement}} fields near the <b>bonding</b> <b>edge,</b> sharp notch, and contact edge show singularity behaviours, so methods of evaluating {{the strength of}} these points using maximum stresses calculated by a numerical stress analysis, such as the finite element method, are generally not valid. We have previously presented a new method of evaluating the strength of these singular points using two stress singularity parameters H and λ. In this paper we have developed a method of formularizing critical stress-singularity parameter Hth for each order of stress singularity λ by utilizing critical distance stress theories (point method and line method), which {{can be derived from}} two typical strength parameters, namely, fatigue limit σw 0 and threshold stress-intensity factor range ∆Kth. These estimated critical Hth (λ) value agreed well with the experimentally measured value. Using these simple critical distance stress approach we estimated the fretting-fatigue-crack initiation criteria for any contact edge angle and optimized the contact-edge geometry. Moreover, we apply this new strength criteria to general stress concentration structures. Introduction.

The symmetry of the superconductive gap can be related to the Bragg scattering of electronic Bloch states near the edges of the AF pseudogap. Assuming a standard phonon coupling, one then predicts for commensurate AF a pure d symmetry of the superconductive gap for underdoped samples and d symmetry plus an ip contribution increasing linearly with overdoping. This seems in agreement with recent measurements of gap symmetry for YBCO, but should be more fully tested, especially for electron doped samples. The simple band approximation used here could no doubt be made more realistic by a specific inclusion of electron correlations and by a better description of AF short range order.

EELS allows single-particle spatial resolution. A measured 0. 23 eV bandwidth {{expansion of the}} localized surface plasmon resonance upon covalent bonding of 20 nm AuNP to WS 2 edges was deemed significant by Welch’s t-test. Approximately 0. 19 eV of the measured 0. 23 eV expansion went beyond conventional radiative and nonradiative damping mechanisms according to discrete dipole models, ostensibly indicating emergence of hot electron transport from AuNP into the WS 2.

Putative hot electron transport for AuNP physicochemically <b>bonded</b> to TMD <b>edges</b> exceeded that for AuNP physically deposited onto the TMD basal plane.

Cytec FM® 94 adhesive film (0. 25 mm nominal thickness) was used for all joints to bond two 2 mm-thickness carbon fibre polymer composite laminates manufactured from unidirectional Hexcel M 21 /T 800 S pre-pregs. Peel-ply surface treatment was used for all joints. The bonds were deteriorated via five methods: pre-curing the centre of bond area prior to the cure of the <b>bond</b> <b>edges,</b> increasing the curing temperature rate, reducing the curing time, and embedding PTFE films over the centre of the bond. For the last method, the studies were carried out by embedding PTFE films on one and two sides of the adhesive film.

The ultimate failure load of the joints with defected bonds (i. e. weak and kissing bonds) was measured and compared to that of the joints with no defect (i. e. good bonds). It was found that rapid curing and short-time curing reduces more than 50 % of the load carrying capacity of the single-lap joins in tension while the joints with weak bonds introduced by pre-curing of a large area of the bond (> 60 %) can take up more than 65 % of the ultimate load of the joint with good bond.

40|$|Key to high {{performance}} bonded joining {{technology is the}} adhesive interface between dissimilar materials. With adhesive joints and hybrid materials such as fiber-metal-laminates, weight savings and superior mechanical properties (e. g. fatigue strength or stiffness) can be achieved. One major challenge for adhesive joining {{is the development of}} suitable adhesive interfaces between polymer matrix and (metal) surfaces that enable long-term stable, degradation resistant bonding. Ideally, these joints also exhibit high bond strengths capable of carrying high loads for structural applications. To a certain degree, the strength requirement of the joints can be tackled by specific design (e. g. dimensioning, tapering, load-adapted design). However, degradation resistance towards humidity or corrosive media such as aqueous salt solutions is much harder to address by design measures (e. g. non-permeable paints on <b>bond</b> <b>edges).</b> Both strength and long-term stability can very efficiently be realized by means of a laser surface pre-treatment. For Ti 15 - 3 /PEEK and Ti 15 - 3 /Epicote 600 joints, excellent shear strengths and long-term stabilities were found after pre-treating the metal with a pulsed Nd:YAG laser as evidenced in single-lap shear tests after accelerated aging. Investigation of the laser-treated surfaces revealed a micrometer-level structure covered by a nanoporous oxide. The laser pre-treatment leads to higher long-term stability than e. g. grit blasting, although initially the bond strengths are comparable. Our current research focuses on bonding mechanisms and their importance for degradation resistance. Through further experiments modifying the structures at both scales, we show that the aging resistance is due to the nanoporous oxide. Removal of the nanostructure also eliminates the degradation resistance. Conversely, enhancing the micron-level structuring by creating trenches and undercuts does not yield increased bond strengths or degradation resistance. Combining measured shear strengths with joint and fracture surface analysis allows for {{a deeper understanding of the}} role of nano-structuring for bond strength, long-term stability and failure mechanisms...|$|R
40|$|The {{pursuit of}} high quality, large area {{graphene}} {{has been a}} major research focus of contemporary materials science research, {{in the wake of the}} discovery of the multitude of exceptional properties exhibited by the material. The DPhil project was undertaken with the objective of developing an understanding of the growth of large graphene sheets by chemical vapour deposition (CVD), and also in the subsequent characterisation of their material properties. By conducting atmospheric pressure CVD growth at high methane flow rates, it was found that few-layered graphene (FLG) could be deposited on a copper catalyst. It is demonstrated that the self-limiting property of a copper catalyst is not universal to all deposition conditions, and shown that FLG grows in a terrace-like configuration. In depth transmission electron microscopy (TEM) studies were carried out on FLG. By selective image reconstruction from the inverse power spectrum of the TEM images, it was possible to elucidate the inter-grain connectivity of few-layer graphenes. It was determined that there were two possible inter-grain configurations possible; specifically an overlap of graphene layers or a discrete atomic <b>bonding</b> <b>edge.</b> The perturbation of the few-layer structure when subject to an out of plane distortion was found to incur a shift in the conventional AB-Bernal stacking of FLG. By utilising the aberration corrected TEM (AC-TEM) at Oxford it was possible to resolve atomic detail in CVD synthesised monolayer films, including atomic bond rotations and vacancies. The use of a high current density at low accelerating voltage (80 kV) was demonstrated to allow for the controlled defect creation in graphene sheets.
