5|$|As it was, Heilmann's {{conclusion}} was so persuasive that it forestalled further {{debate on the}} subject {{even in the face}} of additional conflicting evidence. In 1936, paleontologist Charles Lewis Camp described a new theropod from the Jurassic of North America, Segisaurus. Like Oviraptor, Segisaurus had an unmistakable clavicle, but unlike Oviraptor, it was also plainly identified as <b>being</b> <b>such</b> in the paper that described it. Despite this, the implication of a wishbone-bearing dinosaur was blatantly ignored until much later, and for many years the state of dinosaur research stagnated, possibly due to the effects of the Depression and World War II.|$|E
5|$|Contact with {{extraterrestrial}} civilizations {{would raise}} legal questions, {{such as the}} rights of the extraterrestrial beings. An extraterrestrial arriving on Earth might only have the protection of animal cruelty statutes. Much as various classes of human <b>being,</b> <b>such</b> as women, children, and indigenous people, were initially denied human rights, so might extraterrestrial beings, who could therefore be legally owned and killed. If such a species were not to be treated as a legal animal, there would arise the challenge of defining the boundary between a legal person and a legal animal, considering the numerous factors that constitute intelligence.|$|E
5|$|The Mascarene grey parakeet was grey, {{had a long}} tail, and {{was larger}} than other species of the Psittacula genus, which are usually green. The grey parrots {{were said to be}} easy to hunt, as the capture of one would result in its calling out to summon the whole flock. They were also {{considered}} to be crop pests and <b>being</b> <b>such</b> easy prey meant that they were extensively hunted. Coupled with deforestation, this pushed them into extinction. This had happened by the 1730s on RÃ©union and by the 1760s on Mauritius.|$|E

5|$|The {{problem of}} {{induction}} discussed above {{is seen in}} another form in debates over the foundations of statistics. The standard approach to statistical hypothesis testing avoids claims about whether evidence supports a hypothesis or makes it more probable. Instead, the typical test yields a p-value, which is the probability of the evidence <b>being</b> <b>such</b> as it is, {{under the assumption that}} the hypothesis being tested is true. If the p-value is too low, the hypothesis is rejected, in a way analogous to falsification. In contrast, Bayesian inference seeks to assign probabilities to hypotheses. Related topics in philosophy of statistics include probability interpretations, overfitting, and the difference between correlation and causation.|$|E
5|$|Bart {{learns that}} the couple {{have lost their jobs}} and feels remorseful. After Seymour apologizes to Bart for {{embarrassing}} him, Bart encourages the former principal to stand up for himself and Edna. Agreeing to Bart's comment, Seymour and Edna lock down the school, call the media (with Bart's help) and make their demands: They want their jobs back and the townspeople to not interfere with their relationship. However, several residents reply with their accusation about the two having sexual intercourse in the janitor's closet described by their children. Seymour insists nothing of the sort happened and that he is a virgin. At first, everyone is speechless, but being on the basis of <b>being</b> <b>such</b> an embarrassing thing for someone his age to admit, they {{think it has to be}} true. Realizing that they have overreacted over the relationship, the residents peacefully leave, believing that no one would pretend to be a 44-year-old virgin. Chalmers agrees to reinstate Seymour and Edna as though nothing ever happened, but insists that they keep their relationship at a minimum level during school days. The couple decide to continue their relationship more privately than ever by convincing Bart that they have broken up after thanking him for helping them. They then go back into their relationship and enter the janitor's closet where they presumably have sex.|$|E
5|$|Interferons, a {{subclass}} of cytokines, {{are produced}} in the body during illnesses such as influenza {{in order to help}} fight the infection. They are responsible of many of the symptoms of influenza infections, including fever, muscle aches, fatigue, and headaches. Many patients report influenza-like symptoms hours after taking interferon-beta that usually improve within 24 hours, <b>being</b> <b>such</b> symptoms related to the temporary increase of cytokines. This reaction tends to disappear after 3 months of treatment and its symptoms can be treated with over-the-counter nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as ibuprofen, that reduce fever and pain. Another common transient secondary effect with interferon-beta is a functional deterioration of already existing symptoms of the disease. Such deterioration is similar to the one produced in MS patients due to heat, fever or stress (Uhthoff's phenomenon), usually appears within 24 hours of treatment, is more common in the initial months of treatment, and may last several days. A symptom specially sensitive to worsening is spasticity. Interferon-beta can also reduce numbers of white blood cells (leukopenia), lymphocytes (lymphopenia) and neutrophils (neutropenia), as well as affect liver function. In most cases these effects are non-dangerous and reversible after cessation or reduction of treatment. Nevertheless, recommendation is that all patients should be monitored through laboratory blood analyses, including liver function tests, to ensure safe use of interferons.|$|E

Since apurva is non-sentient, it cannot act unless moved by an intelligent <b>being</b> <b>such</b> as God. It cannot independently bestow reward or punishment.|$|E
