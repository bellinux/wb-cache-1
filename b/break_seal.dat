40|$|Behavioral {{responses}} by top marine predators to oceanographic {{features such as}} eddies, river plumes, storms, and coastal topography suggest that biophysical interactions in these zones affect predators ’ prey, foraging behaviors, and potentially fitness. However, examining these pathways is challenged by the obstacles inherent in obtaining simultaneous observations of surface and subsurface environmental fields and predator behavior. In this study, migratory movements and, in some cases, diving behavior of 40 adult female northern fur seals (NFS; Callorhinus ursinus) were quantified across their range and compared to remotely-sensed environmental data in the Gulf of Alaska and California Current ecosystems, with a particular focus {{off the coast of}} Washington State (USA) – a known foraging ground for adult female NFS and where autonomous glider sampling allowed opportunistic comparison of seal behavior to subsurface biophysical measurements. The results show that in these ecosystems, adult female habitat utilization was concentrated near prominent coastal topographic, riverine, or inlet features and within 200 km of the continental shelf <b>break.</b> <b>Seal</b> dive depths, in most ecosystems, were moderated by surface light level (solar or lunar), mirroring known behaviors of diel vertically-migrating prey. However, seal dives differed in the California Current ecosystem due to a shift to more daytime diving concentrated at or below the surface mixed layer base. Seal movement models indicate behavioral responses to season, ecosystem, and surface win...|$|E

Since almost all breaks were repaired, the calculated number of bases which could be inserted per repaired single-strand break depended on the dose and was close or inferior to a hundred. © 1974.

50|$|The {{leading case}} of joint authorship in India is Najma Heptulla v. Orient Longman Ltd. and Ors. In this case, the {{plaintiff}} {{is the legal}} heir of {{the author of the}} book 'India Wins Freedom'. The defendant is the publisher of said book. The defendant entered into an agreement with one Prof. Humayun Kabir to make contents of the book known to the public. The plaintiff obtained an injunction restraining defendants from <b>breaking</b> <b>seals</b> of covers of the complete book 'India Wins Freedom' and from making its contents known to the public. According to the preface to the said book written by Prof Kabir, Maulana Azad used to describe his experiences in Urdu, on the basis of which a draft in English would be prepared by Prof. Kabir. The court held that active and close intellectual collaboration and cooperation between Maulana Azad implied that Prof. Kabir is a joint author of the book with Maulana Azad. Hence, the defendants were allowed to <b>break</b> the <b>seals</b> of the covers of the complete book ‘India Wins Freedom’ and make its contents known to the public.|$|R
