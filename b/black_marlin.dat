The [...] "Rambler Marlin Sports Fastback" [...] (Corgi 263) scale model was released in 1966 and withdrawn from the market in 1969. In addition to the two-tone paint with chrome bumpers and grille, the model features a detailed interior finished in white and the front seat backs can be tipped forward (as in the actual cars). The second was a gift boxed set (Corgi GS10) with the Marlin finished in blue with a white roof and featuring a roof rack for a kayak, as well as towing a matching utility trailer with opening hatches. Released in 1968, this set had a short run of just 11 months.|$|E

50|$|The use of {{live bait}} is also popular for {{targeting}} {{both large and}} small <b>black</b> <b>marlin,</b> and under the right circumstances, is extremely effective, although sharks and other nontargeted gamefish can often be a problem with this method. Small live baits such as slimy mackerel and yellowtail scad are highly effective for juvenile <b>black</b> <b>marlin,</b> and are fished both by slow trolling and drifting. Live-bait techniques for larger <b>black</b> <b>marlin</b> are similar to those used for blue marlin, normally employing bridle-rigged live tunas of 3 to 25 lb. The use of a downrigger has proven to be helpful in positioning baits deeper in the water column.|$|E

50|$|Founded in 1986 by Winthrop P. Rockefeller, The Billfish Foundation (TBF) is the world's leading nonprofit {{organization}} dedicated to conserving billfish and associated species worldwide which helps ensure healthy oceans and strong coastal economies. TBF's signature research project is the traditional tag and release program that uses the efforts of anglers to provide data and research to scientists and fisheries managers. Awareness {{of the need to}} conserve billfish stocks worldwide has led to an increasing trend for recreational anglers and skippers to release their catches in as healthy a condition as possible. In some areas of the world, commercial fishing for striped, <b>black,</b> and blue <b>marlin</b> has been banned.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to hunting, Hemingway {{was an avid}} fisherman and a great contributor {{to the development of}} the sport. He also contributed to the knowledge of Atlantic marine life. During his first visit to Cuba with Pilar, Hemingway hosted Charles Cadwalader, director of the Philadelphia Academy of Natural History and Henry Fowler, the Academy’s chief ichthyologist. These two scientists were in Cuba trying to determine the taxonomy of marlin species. They were attempting to determine if white, blue, <b>black,</b> or striped <b>marlin</b> were different species, or just color variants of the same species. As a result of their efforts on the boat, they reclassified the North Atlantic marlin variants.|$|R
5000|$|By {{the start}} of the 1960s, the NFL was complacent in its {{dominance}} of the market for Professional Football fans, and had little incentive to expand that market. The AAFC was history, and the NFL had chosen not to capitalize on the boost it had received from the 1958 Colts-Giants sudden-death game. It was content with a 12-team league playing a 12-game schedule and featured [...] "ball-control" [...] football. When Texas oilmen Lamar Hunt and Bud Adams tried to purchase existing NFL franchises to move to Texas, or to establish new NFL franchises there, they were told that the conservative NFL was not interested. The result was that Hunt and Adams joined with six other businessmen to form the fourth American Football League (1960-1969). The league started out by signing half of the NFL's 1960 first-round draft choices including the Houston Oilers' Billy Cannon, and never slowed down. With future Hall of Fame Coaches Hank Stram (Dallas Texans/Kansas City Chiefs) and Sid Gillman (LA/San Diego Chargers) as well as others like the Buffalo Bills' Lou Saban, the league offered a more risk-oriented on-field approach that appealed to fans. The AFL also actively recruited from predominantly black colleges and other small colleges, a source the NFL virtually ignored. This led to a higher percentage of minority players, as well as several firsts, such as the first black number one draft choice (Buck Buchanan, Chiefs); the first black middle linebacker, Willie Lanier, Chiefs; and the first modern <b>black</b> starting quarterback (<b>Marlin</b> Briscoe, Broncos).|$|R
50|$|<b>Black</b> <b>marlin</b> {{are still}} found in Peruvian waters, {{but the main}} sport-fishing {{destination}} in the region nowadays is further north in Salinas, Ecuador. <b>Black</b> <b>marlin</b> are normally outnumbered in catch reports by the more prolific striped and blue marlin, but some big fish continue to be caught. The traditional method of sport fishing is trolling with natural baits, large ballyhoo being commonly used, while searching for finning fish.|$|E
50|$|Today, the {{productive}} reef areas in Piñas Bay, fished by boats from the famous Tropic Star Lodge, {{and the many}} other reefs and islands along the Pacific coast of Panama, particularly Coiba Island in the Gulf of Chiriqui, still have probably the best fishing for <b>black</b> <b>marlin</b> in the Western Hemisphere. <b>Black</b> <b>marlin</b> averaging 200 to 500 lb hunt schools of rainbow runners, black skipjack, and other prey over these structures along with large Pacific sailfish and dorado. Occasional specimens will reach well over 600 lb. Slow trolling with bridle-rigged live skipjack is the predominant technique used to target <b>black</b> <b>marlin</b> by the Tropic Star fleet. At Coiba Island, the Hannibal Banks is among most productive areas where trolling lures is employed successfully.|$|E

50|$|<b>Black</b> <b>marlin</b> fishing has {{traditionally}} conducted with rigged dead baits, both skipping and swimming. In the historic Cabo Blanco fishery, little blind trolling was done; instead, the billfish (striped marlin, <b>black</b> <b>marlin,</b> and swordfish) were sighted cruising or finning {{on the surface}} and baited. In the Cairns fishery, a wide variety of baitfish species are used successfully, including kawa kawa and other small tunas, queenfish, and scad. Baits range from 2 lb scad to dogtooth tuna and narrowbarred mackerel of 20 lb and more.|$|E
5000|$|Although {{most of the}} marlin captures in Ecuadorian waters {{today are}} blue and striped marlin, the <b>black</b> <b>marlin</b> brought {{this area of the}} {{southeast}} Pacific to fame in the 1950s, when many fish of over 1000 lb were boated by anglers fishing from Cabo Blanco, a small town in northern Peru, close to the border with Ecuador. The inshore grounds off the high white cliffs became known as 'Marlin Boulevard' for the numbers and size of the <b>black</b> <b>marlin</b> taken there. Greatest of the many granders captured here was the 1560 lb <b>black</b> <b>marlin</b> boated by Texas oilman Alfred C. Glassell, Jr., in August 1953. [...] The Cabo Blanco Fishing Club, where most fishing operations were based, closed down in the late 1960s following a period of political upheaval in Peru. Around the same time, the Peruvian sport fishery also crashed following the overfishing of the primary baitfish, anchoveta.|$|E

50|$|Along {{the east}} coast of Australia, land based game fishing can be divided into two fairly {{distinct}} geographic regions. On the north coast of New South Wales, from approximately Sydney north, light tackle is generally used, with smaller target species such as longtail tuna, Spanish mackerel and cobia. Particularly noted are the rock platforms of Jervis Bay, where <b>black</b> <b>marlin</b> of up to 200 lb have been caught using bait floated out on balloons. South of Sydney, heavier tackle is used as the target species are generally much larger, with the main targets being <b>black</b> <b>marlin,</b> yellowfin tuna, kingfish and sharks.|$|E
