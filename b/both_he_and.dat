25|$|As mentioned, e, like di, is only {{contracted}} {{with the word}} preceding it if a phoneme is dropped from the preceding word as well. E, however, has the unique property of changing the emphasis of the word before it. <b>Both</b> <b>’e</b> <b>and</b> ’i are commonly affixed to the word before them, even when they shouldn't be. In Papiamentu, ’é should always take on the acute accent because it is stressed when contracted.|$|R

Due to his incredibly negative view of politics, he regularly works to make his department as inefficient as possible.

40|$|The {{first order}} Boltzmann-Fokker-Planck {{equation}} is solved numerically to obtain diffusion and viscosity coefficients for a ternary gas mixture composed of electron, protons, and helium. The coefficients are tabulated for five He/H abundances ranging from 0. 01 to 10 <b>and</b> for <b>both</b> <b>He</b> II <b>and</b> <b>He</b> III. Comparison with Burgers's thermal diffusion coefficients reveals a maximum difference of 9 - 10 % for <b>both</b> <b>He</b> II <b>and</b> <b>He</b> III throughout {{the range of}} helium abundances considered. The viscosity coefficients are compared to those of Chapman and Cowling and show a maximum difference of only 5 - 6 % for He II but 15 - 16 % for He III. For the astrophysically important gas mixtures, it is concluded {{that the results of}} existing studies which employed Burgers's or Chapman and Cowling's coefficients will remain substantially unaltered...|$|R

5|$|Periyar viewed Christianity {{similar to}} the monotheistic faith of Islam. He {{explained}} that their faith says {{that there can be}} only one God which has no name or shape. Periyar took an interest in Rev. Martin Luther, where <b>both</b> <b>he</b> <b>and</b> his followers wanted to liken him and his role to that of the European reformer. Thus, Christian views such as that of Ram Mohan Roy's The Precepts of Jesus has had at least an indirect influence on Periyar.|$|E

However, Johnston recovered, and <b>both</b> <b>he</b> <b>and</b> Miller took their places in all five Tests, eliminating any disadvantage caused by the controversial initial omission of the latter.|$|E

The commander proposed setting up a common fund of the citizens to support the defence, but this proposal met with vehement opposition, particularly from the wealthy aristocrats, who would naturally have born the brunt of the cost. The common people however also proved unwilling to contribute, and rioted in favour of an accommodation with the Ottomans, when the news spread that they had offered a peaceful settlement, provided that the Despot Andronikos left the city.|$|E
