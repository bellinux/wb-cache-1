Color Air had an agreement for tickets to be sold at the Rimi supermarkets, {{as well as by}} phone and Internet. If <b>bought</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> travel agency, there was a NOK 200 surcharge. This was because Color Air was not linked to the Amadeus booking system, owing to the costs associated with membership.|$|E
5|$|During the trip, Homer {{falls asleep}} and wakes up {{abruptly}} {{at the wheel}} of the truck due to taking a combination of pep pills and sleeping pills that he <b>bought</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> general store. He awakes to discover that the truck drove by itself with its Navitron Autodrive System. He informs other truck drivers, who inform him that he cannot let anyone know about the Autodrive system because it would make all truck drivers lose their jobs. However, Homer tells the passengers of a passing bus about the system, which causes an angry mob of truckers to go after Homer. But even after the Autodrive system ejects itself from Homer's semi, Homer is able to escape from the angry trucker mob. Homer and Bart arrive in Atlanta to finish Red's shipment on time, and then commandeer a train full of napalm so they can return to Springfield.|$|E

25|$|The Portuguese guitar {{played a}} small role in Celtic and western folk music {{following}} the folk revival. In the 1970s, Andy Irvine {{of the band}} Planxty played a modified Portuguese guitar. British luthier Stefan Sobell based his early 1970s creation of the modern cittern on a Portuguese guitar he'd <b>bought</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> used shop in Leeds some years previously.|$|E
25|$|A {{computerised}} booking {{system was}} first {{installed in the}} early 1990s, allowing tickets to be <b>bought</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> number of locations around the city.

The following year, a Half Price Ticket Tent, run in association with Metro newspaper, started offering special ticket prices for different shows each day. This sold 45,000 tickets in its first year.|$|E
25|$|In February 2002 several scandals {{surrounding}} his administration were {{revealed in the}} media. The first headlines involved exceptionally high spending in his administration. It was claimed that he routinely drank luxury red wine (at a cost of around $1,200 USD per bottle) on the public expense account. Furthermore, the wine was <b>bought</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> local restaurant in which Brixtofte was a shareholder. Municipal employees reported that the charismatic mayor had over years shown increasing signs of alcoholism and established an autocratic, timid climate at the town hall.

25|$|Many {{suppliers}} of insects for reptiles offer live bugs and worms. Monitor lizards are typically fed live insects {{and may not}} eat pre-killed ones. Amphibians typically require live insects—wild-caught, home-grown, or <b>bought</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> pet store—although some like axolotls can be fed chunks of meat. It's generally hard to convert reptiles and amphibians that eat insects to pre-killed prey, though some pet owners can feed dead insects by moving or dangling them. Bearded dragons can be fed dead crickets by hiding them in other food, dangling them with tongs, squirting them with water, or vibrating a bowl.|$|E
25|$|In November 1993 Chinese paleontologists Zhou Zhonge, Hu Yoaming and Hou Lianhai, of the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology at Beijing, were {{presented}} a bird fossil <b>bought</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> flea market in Sihetun by amateur paleontologist Zhang He. It showed a partial {{skeleton of a}} bird new to science of which even some feather remains had been preserved. In December 1993 two further specimens were acquired from a farmer, Yang Yushan. Soon afterwards, {{it was discovered that}} local farmers {{were in the process of}} collecting hundreds of specimens that were provisionally prepared by them to be illegally sold to commercial fossil dealers. Many hundreds have since also been added to the official collections of Chinese institutions. In 2010 the Shandong Tianyu Museum of Nature alone possessed 536 specimens. The fossils are compressed but otherwise typically very complete often showing the entire feathering of the animal.|$|E
25|$|Travelcards {{for seven}} days or longer are known as season tickets and allow travel {{at any time of}} the day. When <b>bought</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> London Underground station or other Transport for London agent, one day Travelcards are sold on a paper ticket with a {{magnetic}} stripe and Travelcards lasting seven days or more are loaded on to an Oyster Card. A monthly travelcard (valid for between 28 and 31 days depending on month) is sold for 3.84 times the price of a 7-day card, while annual travelcards are sold for the price of 40 7-day tickets. The price of a travelcard valid for between one month and one year will be the sum of the relevant number of months, plus a pro-rata monthly rate for the number of days in the final month. As 40 weekly tickets cost approximately the same as a 10-month-12-day ticket, it is not possible in practice to buy a travelcard for a period between 10M12D and 1 year, as an annual pass is cheaper and will be issued anyway.|$|E

25|$|As a teenager, he {{was greatly}} {{troubled by the}} Metaphysics of Aristotle, which he could not {{understand}} until he read al-Farabi's commentary on the work. For {{the next year and}} a half, he studied philosophy, in which he encountered greater obstacles. In such moments of baffled inquiry, he would leave his books, perform the requisite ablutions, then go to the mosque, and continue in prayer till light broke on his difficulties. Deep into the night, he would continue his studies, and even in his dreams problems would pursue him and work out their solution. Forty times, it is said, he read through the Metaphysics of Aristotle, till the words were imprinted on his memory; but their meaning was hopelessly obscure, until one day they found illumination, from the little commentary by Farabi, which he <b>bought</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> bookstall for the small sum of three dirhams. So great was his joy at the discovery, made {{with the help of a}} work from which he had expected only mystery, that he hastened to return thanks to God, and bestowed alms upon the poor.|$|E
25|$|In 1836, {{two ships}} of the South Australia Land Company left to {{establish}} the first settlement on Kangaroo Island. The foundation of South Australia is now generally commemorated as Governor John Hindmarsh's Proclamation of the new Province at Glenelg, on the mainland, on 28 December 1836. From 1843 to 1851, the Governor ruled {{with the assistance of}} an appointed Executive Council of paid officials. Land development and settlement was the basis of the Wakefield vision, so land law and regulations governing it were fundamental to the foundation of the Province and allowed for land to be <b>bought</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> uniform price per acre (regardless of quality), with auctions for land desired by more than one buyer, and leases made available on unused land. Proceeds from land were to fund the Emigration Fund to assist poor settlers to come as tradesmen and labourers. Agitation for representative government quickly emerged. Most other colonies had been founded by Governors with near total authority, but in South Australia, power was initially divided between the Governor and the Resident Commissioner, so that government could not interfere with the business affairs or freedom of religion of the settlers. By 1851 the colony was experimenting with a partially elected council.|$|E
25|$|The poor {{indicated}} they were not so much concerned about the tariff charged by the private water companies, since it was {{much lower than the}} prices they had to pay to private vendors. They were much more concerned about the high connection fees to the network that were unaffordable for most of them. While wealthier residents use suction pumps and storage tanks to improve supply, poorer residents suffer more from low pressure and intermittent supply. Water vendors are not effectively regulated in terms of service quality and prices charged. Obtaining water from private wells or hydrants involves queuing of up to two hours and costs of 15,000 Rupiahs (US$1.66) per month and family. Bottled water was also frequently <b>bought</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> cost of up to 85,000 Rupiahs (US$9.44) per month and family. Water from wells is often polluted with bacteria and salty, with salt levels increasing in the Northern parts of the city closer to the coast. Groundwater in some areas has high iron content and needs to be filtered. According to the Jakarta Environmental Management Body 90 percent of groundwater was contaminated by metal, nitrate and e-coli in 2011. Boiling of water is frequent. Water from the public network, including at public hydrants, is sometimes only available for several hours per day and not always of good quality.|$|E

500|$|The furnace {{operated}} only intermittently under Valentine Iron management, and {{in early}} 1899, it {{was bought by}} the Empire Steel and Iron Company, along with the Nittany Valley RR and the associated ore lands. Empire Steel renamed the plant [...] "Nittany Furnace," [...] and sent Walter Kennedy, vice-president of engineering, to survey the local ore resources in March 1899. Empire decided to use a mixture of local and Lake Superior ores, and relit the furnace in May 1899. However, Empire shut down the furnace again in April 1900, closing it indefinitely.

This mandates housing developers using land <b>bought</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> discount from the city to make at least 10 percent of their housing units [...] "affordable", or to contribute money to an affordable-housing fund by increasing the percentage to 15 percent. The issue is considered {{a key element in}} the debate about ending homelessness in Chicago.

500|$|The design {{attracted}} {{comments from}} {{those interested in}} coins. Frank Duffield, editor of the ANA's journal The Numismatist, noted in the October 1936 issue that the coin had been awaited with anticipation by hobbyists because of an announcement that it would bear the likeness of Foster, but [...] "when it finally appeared many expressions of approval of the designs were heard and a few criticisms... Foster deserved a better bust than the one the artist has given us...the toy four-string lyre [...] holds in her hand is not {{in keeping with the}} times or the occasion... After all these years, Music deserved something better." [...] Coin dealer B. Max Mehl, in his monograph on commemorative coins published in 1937, agreed with the criticism of the reverse, [...] "apparently this lyre must have been <b>bought</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> 5¢ and 10¢ store as it seems to be only a toy".|$|E
500|$|The track [...] "Freeway", {{which was}} {{referred}} by the band as [...] "the feel bad dance {{hit of the}} year", features a hip hop-influenced style with sampled voices. Its lyrics were inspired by an article in Los Angeles Times {{about a man who}} stopped his truck on a Los Angeles freeway and committed suicide after litting his truck on fire and obstructing the traffic. The sampled voices were taken from Casio keyboards that Sparks and Suzi had previously <b>bought</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> Guitar Center store. The album features humorous and irreverent lyrics. Sparks noted that many songs are [...] "double-sided. There's a lot of masking of fuck-you's going on." [...] She also said that Slap-Happy was [...] "almost a spit in the eye of our label, who had dropped us. It was like, 'Fuck you, we’re going to make another record anyway, so fuck off!' Some of the writing on [...] record is very angry, because we were pissed." [...] The opening track [...] "Crackpot Baby", which is the first L7 song that features a three-part vocal harmony, features [...] "unforgiving lyrics about plastic L.A. types", while [...] "Stick to the Plan" [...] is about a [...] "chronic masturbator / With love in his eyes".|$|E
