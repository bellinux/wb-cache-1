40|$|Abstract. The {{closed-loop}} {{performance of}} a ball-screw drive is usually limited by a resonance in which the carriage oscillates {{in the direction of}} motion as the screw undergoes longitudinal and torsional deformation. By means of the finite element method (FEM), a model of ball-screw system dynamics is presented by taking into account the distributed inertia of the screw and the compliance and damping of thrust <b>bearings,</b> <b>nut</b> and coupling. Transmission ratio is modeled using DOFs (degree of freedoms) constraint equation. The model is found to accurately predict the transfer function from motor torque to carriage position. Comparing the predicted responses with experiments performed on a pair of ball-screw drives, the resonance frequency is misestimated as much as 5 % in the worst case...|$|R

The nonuniformity of microstructure and the lower carbon and chromium content in the indentation, leading to local lower hardness, account for the nut failure. While the raceway of the 20 CrMo carburized steel nut is more rough with scratches caused by the damaged steel balls so as to show the characteristics of wear failure.
