25|$|Low-voltage circuit {{breakers}} are also made for direct-current (DC) applications, such as DC for subway lines. Direct current requires special breakers because the arc is continuous—unlike an AC arc, {{which tends to}} go out on each half cycle. A direct current circuit breaker has blow-out coils that generate a magnetic field that rapidly stretches the arc. Small {{circuit breakers}} are either installed directly in equipment, or are arranged in a <b>breaker</b> <b>panel.</b>|$|E
2500|$|... 8 {{and larger}} cables are now {{insulated}} in black, with 6/3 for 50-amp electric ranges in kitchens, and 0/2 (two black-insulated #0 AWG wires, plus ground) {{for the main}} 200-amp cable from the weatherhead and electricity meter to the main <b>breaker</b> <b>panel.</b>|$|E
2500|$|AFCI {{receptacles}} look {{similar to}} GFCI receptacles {{in that they}} have a TEST and RESET button {{on the face of the}} device for localized testing. [...] This saves a homeowner a trip to the <b>breaker</b> <b>panel</b> should the device trip. [...] Unlike AFCI breakers, AFCI receptacles can be used on any wiring system, regardless of the panel. When installed as the first receptacle on a branch circuit, AFCI receptacles provide series arc protection for the entire branch circuit. They also provide parallel arc protection for the branch circuit starting at the AFCI receptacle.|$|E
50|$|Breakers {{are usually}} {{arranged}} in two columns. In a U.S.-style board, breaker positions are numbered left-to-right, along each row {{from top to}} bottom. This numbering system is universal with numerous competitive manufacturers of <b>breaker</b> <b>panels.</b>|$|R
50|$|Nonremovable {{electric}} equipment is often enclosed in protective outer shells that prevent whitewash intrusion. For example, circuit <b>breaker</b> <b>panels</b> may be enclosed within wooden cabinetry which keeps the whitewash spray coating {{from entering the}} panel.|$|R
50|$|Electrical {{panels are}} easily {{accessible}} junction boxes used to reroute and switch electrical services. The term {{is often used}} to refer to circuit <b>breaker</b> <b>panels</b> or fuseboxes. Local codes can specify physical clearance around the panels.|$|R

2500|$|... "All-copper" [...] {{building}} wiring {{is a term}} that refers to buildings in which the inside electrical service is carried exclusively over copper wiring. In all-copper homes, copper conductors are used in circuit <b>breaker</b> <b>panels,</b> branch circuit wiring (to outlets, switches, lighting fixtures and the like), and in dedicated branches serving heavy-load appliances (such as ranges, ovens, clothes dryers and air conditioners).|$|R
5000|$|Most of the time, the <b>panels</b> and the <b>breakers</b> {{inserted}} {{inside them}} must {{be by the}} same manufacturer. Each manufacturer has one or more [...] "systems", or kinds of <b>breaker</b> <b>panels,</b> that will only accept breakers of that type. In Europe, this is still the case, despite {{the adoption of a}} standard DIN rail for mounting and a standard cut-out shape, as the positions of the busbar connections are not standardized.|$|R
5000|$|An {{interlock}} kit {{does not}} require a separate panel to operate; it can be installed directly on the home's <b>breaker</b> <b>panel.</b>|$|E
50|$|Sometimes it {{is desired}} {{to have a}} {{portable}} <b>breaker</b> <b>panel,</b> for example, for special events. In this case, a <b>breaker</b> <b>panel</b> is mounted to a board, together with various sockets. The American one pictured at the right has a cord with an L21-30 plug to supply power. Power leaves the board through four three-phase circuits: three 15 ampere circuits; and one 20 A circuit. The 15 A circuits each go to a triplex box. The 20 A circuit goes to an L21-20 receptacle, and one leg of it goes to a 20 A duplex receptacle shown at the upper left. The neon night-lights on the upper right triplex box are to show the phase presence.|$|E

50|$|In July 2017, {{asbestos}} {{was found}} in the circuit <b>breaker</b> <b>panels,</b> which is inside the driver compartment, of the C and K sets. This caused all C and K sets to be taken out of service for inspection. As a result, S sets were used to replace C/K sets on services that were scheduled as C/K. As of 21 July 2017, some C/K sets are returning to service, but many are still being replaced by S sets.|$|R
5000|$|Circuitboards and panelboards built {{prior to}} 1965 {{did not have}} circuit total {{limiting}} devices or features built-in. To support these old <b>panels,</b> non-CTL circuit <b>breakers</b> that bypass the rejection feature are still sold [...] "for replacement use only." [...] As a result, numerous unsafe situations have resulted where panels were dangerously overloaded because these non-CTL breakers continue to be used. With the use of non-CTL <b>breakers,</b> <b>panels</b> can be configured with {{the total number of}} circuits in excess of the designed capacity of that panel.|$|R
50|$|Another {{well-known}} Square D {{product line}} is the Powerlink circuit breaker, created for lighting control in commercial buildings. B Line and D Line were the <b>breaker</b> <b>panels</b> in which Powerline breakers were used. Eventually, the company branded Powerline and Powerlink <b>panels</b> and <b>breakers.</b> Powerlink was a heavy duty 277-volt lighting breaker, used in large buildings with 277-volt lighting loads. These were also favored for their robust design, and functional reliability. This means less panel space and wire are needed, and why commercial buildings frequently utilize higher voltage for general task lighting.|$|R
5000|$|Unibit or Step-Bit: A {{metal-cutting}} {{drill bit}} with stepped-diameter cutting edges to enable convenient drilling holes in preset increments in stamped/rolled metal {{up to about}} 1.6mm (1/16 inch) thick. Commonly used to create custom knock-outs in a <b>breaker</b> <b>panel</b> or junction box.|$|E
5000|$|Lineman's pliers have a tapered nose {{suitable}} for reaming the rough {{edge of a}} 1/2" [...] or larger conduit, or cleaning sharp metal {{from the inside of}} a standard metal knockout in an electrical enclosure such as a junction box or <b>breaker</b> <b>panel.</b> Some brands manufacture pliers (i.e. Ideal) with a narrower jaw, {{suitable for}} reaming smaller conduit.|$|E
50|$|AFCI {{receptacles}} are {{an alternative}} solution to AFCI breakers. These receptacles {{are designed to}} address the dangers associated with both types of potentially hazardous arcing: parallel and series. AFCI receptacles offer the benefit of localized test and reset with such buttons located {{on the face of}} the device. This is very convenient and saves a journey to the <b>breaker</b> <b>panel.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In {{electrical}} grids, a {{power system}} network integrates transmission grids, distribution grids, distributed generators and loads that have connection points called busses. A bus in home circuit <b>breaker</b> <b>panels</b> {{is much smaller}} than those used on the grid, where busbars can be 50 mm in diameter in electrical substations. Traditionally, these grid connections are unidirectional point to multipoint links. In distributed generation grids, these connections are bidirectional, and the reverse flow can raise safety and reliability concerns. [...] Features in smart grids are designed to manage these conditions.|$|R
50|$|The I-Line {{series of}} {{distribution}} panelboards is favored by many electricians for its ease {{and safety of}} adding new <b>breakers.</b> The <b>panel</b> uses a stacked bus system that protects the energized bus from accidental contact and the breaker can be easily installed using a flat blade screwdriver contacting only de-energized parts of the backplane of the panel. The design of the <b>breakers</b> and <b>panel</b> require that extra attention be paid to phase rotation, as the right (even-numbered) side of the panel will have the phases in a C-B-A configuration whereas the left (odd-numbered) side of the panel will have a more standard A-B-C arrangement.|$|R
50|$|For {{reasons of}} {{aesthetics}} and security, domestic circuit <b>breaker</b> <b>panels</b> and consumer units are normally located in out-of-the-way closets, attics, garages, or basements, {{but sometimes they}} are also featured {{as part of the}} aesthetic elements of a building (as an art installation, for example) or where they can be easily accessible. However, current U.S. building codes prohibit installation of a panel in a bathroom (or similar room), in closets intended for clothing, or where there is insufficient space for an electrician {{to gain access to the}} panel. Specific situations, such as an installation outdoors, in a hazardous environment, or in other out-of-the-ordinary locations might require specialized equipment and more stringent installation practices.|$|R
50|$|Flanking {{the sides}} of the main panel were sets of smaller control panels. On the left side were a circuit <b>breaker</b> <b>panel,</b> audio controls, and the SCS power controls. On the right were {{additional}} circuit breakers and a redundant audio control panel, along with the environmental control switches. In total, the command module panels included 24 instruments, 566 switches, 40 event indicators, and 71 lights.|$|E
50|$|A {{distribution}} board (also known as panelboard, <b>breaker</b> <b>panel,</b> or electric panel) is {{a component of}} an electricity supply system that divides an electrical power feed into subsidiary circuits, while providing a protective fuse or circuit breaker for each circuit in a common enclosure. Normally, a main switch, and in recent boards, one or more residual-current devices (RCD) or residual current breakers with overcurrent protection (RCBO), are also incorporated.|$|E

40|$|A 90 -day test is {{reported}} of a regenerative {{life support system}} which was completed in a space station simulator. The long duration of the test {{and the fact that}} it was manned, imposed rigid reliability and safety requirements on the facility. Where adequate reliability could not be built into essential facility systems, either backup systems or components were provided. Awareness was intensified by: (1) placing signs on every piece of equipment that could affect the test, (2) painting switches on all <b>breaker</b> <b>panels</b> a bright contrasting color, (3) restricting access to the test control area, and (4) informing personnel in the facility (other than test personnel) of test activities. It is concluded that the basic facility is satisfactory for conducting long-duration manned tests, and it is recommended that all monitor and alarm functions be integrated into a single operation...|$|R
50|$|The New Zealand division, Reyrolle Pacific, {{was sold}} by Siemens AG/VA Tech {{to a private}} {{individual}} in New Zealand. This included the switchgear factory in Petone, {{with a staff of}} about 100. Reyrolle Pacific Switchgear became RPS Switchgear and manufactures retrofit breakers for the original LMT switchgear, and vacuum <b>breakers</b> and <b>panels</b> for 11 kV substations.|$|R
50|$|Aircraft are {{susceptible}} to encounters with volcanic ash particles during flight. The volcanic ash particles which are ingested can easily contaminate the fuselage of the aircraft. The contamination will necessitate the cleaning of the cockpit electronics and <b>panels,</b> <b>panels,</b> circuit <b>breaker</b> <b>panels</b> and passenger and baggage compartments. The electrical and aircraft avionics systems can be so heavily be covered with volcanic ash particles {{to the point where}} a complete replacement is required, due to overheating or diminished accuracy of the equipment. The ash can be drawn into cargo-hold and affect the fire-warning system and can cause spurious alarms. The ash itself is hazardous to the engines by melting and solidifying as a glassy material on the turbine blades, affects the small tolerances which make the turbine efficient. The glassy material which is formed on the blades also has the possibility of shattering and throwing hard debris through the engine which can cause damage.|$|R
50|$|Power and {{telecommunication}} services generally require entry points {{into the home}} and a location for connection equipment. For electric power supply, a cable is run either overhead or underground into a distribution board in the home. A distribution board, or circuit <b>breaker</b> <b>panel,</b> is typically a metal box {{mounted on a wall}} of the home. In many new homes the location of the electrical switchboard is {{on the outside of the}} external wall of the garage.|$|E
50|$|A 25-year-old male {{worker at}} a {{concrete}} pipe manufacturing facility died from injurieshe received while cleaning a ribbon-type concrete mixer. The victim’s daily tasks included cleaning out the concrete mixer {{at the end}} of the shift. The clean-out procedure was to shut off the power at the <b>breaker</b> <b>panel</b> (approximately 35 feet from the mixer), push the toggle switch by the mixer to make sure that the power was off, and then enter the mixer to clean it. No one witnessed the event, but investigators concluded that the mixer operator had shut off the main breaker and then made a telephone call instead of following the normal procedure for checking the mixer before any one entered it. The victim did not know that the operator had de-energized the mixer at the breaker. Thinking he was turning the mixer off, he activated the breaker switch and energized the mixer. The victim then entered the mixer and began cleaning without first pushing the toggle switch to make sure that the equipment was de-energized. The mixer operator returned from making his telephone call and pushed the toggle switch to check that the mixer was de-energized. The mixer started, and the operator heard the victim scream. He went immediately to the main <b>breaker</b> <b>panel</b> and shut off the mixer.|$|E
50|$|For modern {{residential}} construction {{the use of}} larger gauge stranded aluminum wire is fairly common in much of North America. Larger aluminum wire is used in residential applications for lower voltage service feeders from the utility to the building. Also, larger aluminum building wire made with the newer AA-8000 series alloy of aluminum is commonly used for electrical services (e.g. service entrance conductors from the utility connection to the service <b>breaker</b> <b>panel)</b> and for larger branch circuits with higher loads such as those for sub-panels, ranges and air-conditioning units.|$|E
50|$|Zinsco was {{originally}} the West Coast {{division of the}} Frank Adam Electric Company, whose main facility was in St Louis, Missouri, the company became independent as the Zinsmeyer Company following {{the onset of the}} Great Depression. The younger Zinsmeyer took over the company from his father in 1943 and renamed it Zinsco. The company was sold in 1973 to GTE-Sylvania, who continued to manufacture <b>breakers</b> and <b>panels</b> to the original Zinsco design for some years; this product line is now discontinued.|$|R
50|$|In early January a water leak was {{reported}} in the main house by the couple's alarm company and a plumber was summoned to repair the problem. The plumber repaired the leak and prior to leaving, made sure that he turned on all of the circuit <b>breakers</b> in the <b>panel.</b> This included the circuit breaker for the cabana cook top.|$|R
50|$|Bad wiring {{junctions}} {{can occur}} in utilization equipment, cords, or in-situ wiring and especially in a defective switch, socket, plug, wiring connection and even at the circuit <b>breaker</b> or fuse <b>panels.</b> Terminal screws loosened by vibration, improper tightening or other causes offer increased resistance to the current, with consequent heating and potential thermal creep, which will cause the termination to loosen further and exacerbate the heating effect. In North America, high resistance junctions are sometimes observed at the terminations of aluminum wire circuits, where oxidation has caused increased resistance, resulting in thermal creep. No technology located in a circuit <b>breaker</b> or fuse <b>panel</b> could detect a high-resistance wiring fault as no measurable characteristic exists that differentiates a glow fault from normal branch circuit operation. Power Fault Circuit Interrupters (PFCI) located in receptacles are designed to prevent fires caused by glowing connections in wiring or panels. From the receptacle a PFCI can detect the voltage drop when high current exists in a high resistance junction. In a properly designed and maintained circuit, substantial voltage drops should never occur. Proper wire terminations inside utilization equipment, such as appliances, and cords prevent high-resistance connections {{that could lead to}} fires.|$|R
