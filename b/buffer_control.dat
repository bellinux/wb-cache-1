Conjugatable Adjuvant Lipid Vesicles(CALV) with adjuvants monophosphoryl lipid A(MPL) or double stranded RNA(dsRNA). Methods: Study 1 (St 1), A 3, A 9 and He liposomes(CALV- 3 Asp) at 5, 10 or 25 ug of each protein/dose w/MPL were compared to <b>buffer</b> <b>controls</b> in a lethal challenge. In Study 2 (St 2), 5 ug/dose of CALV- 3 Asp with MPL and/or dsRNA were compared with <b>buffer</b> <b>controls</b> in a sublethal challenge. Mice were given a subcutaneous prime and 2 intranasal(IN) boosts, two/three weeks apart. Two weeks post-boosting, mice were immunosuppressed with triamcinolone and challenged IN with 8 x 10 ex 6 A. fumigatus conidia. Lungs were collected day 1 (St 1) /day 2 (St 2) post-challenge and plated for CFU/g(n= 6 - 7 /gp). St 1, lung homogenates and St 2, spleens were evaluated for cytokines. Results: Vaccination with 5 ug/dose CALV- 3 Asp improved survival compared to <b>buffer</b> <b>controls</b> (5 ug= 70 % vs PBS= 30 %) and mice given 5 ug/dose CALV- 3 Asp had significantly lower lung fungal burden compared to controls(P< 0. 03).

Mice given CALV- 3 Asp w/MPL (St 2) at 5 ug/dose, showed significant reductions in lung fungal burden compared to controls(P< 0. 04). Conclusions: Vaccination with CALV- 3 Asp w/MPL was protective, enhancing survival and significantly lowering lung fungal burden with elevation of both IFN-gamma and IL- 4.

We analyze the impacts of the handoff disruption period and inter-AR synchro-nization variance.

In {{this paper}} we propose a novel rate control {{initialization}} algorithm for real-time H. 264 /scalable video coding. In particular, a two-step approach is proposed. First, the initial quantization parameter (QP) for each layer is determined by means of a parametric rate-quantization (R-Q) modeling that depends on the layer identifier (base or enhancement) and on the type of scalability (spatial or quality). Second, an intra-frame QP refinement method that allows for adapting the initial QP value when needed is carried out over the three first coded frames in order to take into consideration both the <b>buffer</b> <b>control</b> and the spatio-temporal complexity of the scene. The experimental results show that the proposed R-Q modeling for initial QP estimation, in combination with the intra-frame QP refinement method, provide a good performance in terms of visual quality and <b>buffer</b> <b>control,</b> achieving remarkably similar results to those achieved by using ideal initial QP values.
