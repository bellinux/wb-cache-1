2500|$|Anaerobic {{digestion}} can {{be performed}} as a batch process or a continuous process. In a batch system, biomass {{is added to the}} reactor {{at the start of the}} process. The reactor is then sealed for the duration of the process. In its simplest form batch processing needs inoculation with already processed material to start the anaerobic digestion. In a typical scenario, biogas production will be formed with a normal distribution pattern over time. Operators can use this fact to determine when they believe the process of digestion of the organic matter has completed. There can be severe odour issues if a <b>batch</b> <b>reactor</b> is opened and emptied before the process is well completed. A more advanced type of batch approach has limited the odour issues by integrating anaerobic digestion with in-vessel composting. In this approach inoculation takes place through the use of recirculated degasified percolate. After anaerobic digestion has completed, the biomass is kept in the reactor which is then used for in-vessel composting before it is opened [...] As the batch digestion is simple and requires less equipment and lower levels of design work, it is typically a cheaper form of digestion. Using more than one <b>batch</b> <b>reactor</b> at a plant can ensure constant production of biogas.|$|E
50|$|The {{simplest}} type of reactor is a <b>batch</b> <b>reactor.</b> Materials {{are charged}} in a <b>batch</b> <b>reactor,</b> {{and the reaction}} proceeds with time. A <b>batch</b> <b>reactor</b> does not reach a steady state, and control of temperature, pressure and volume is necessary. Thus, a <b>batch</b> <b>reactor</b> has ports for sensors and material input and output. Batch reactors are used in small-scale production and reactions with biological materials, such as in brewing, pulping and production of enzymes.|$|E
50|$|<b>Batch</b> <b>reactors</b> {{are often}} used in the process industry. <b>Batch</b> <b>reactors</b> also have many {{laboratory}} applications, such as small scale production and inducing fermentation for beverage products. They also have many uses in medical production. <b>Batch</b> <b>reactors</b> are generally considered expensive to run, as well as variable product reliability. They are also used for experiments of reaction kinetics, volatiles and thermodynamics. <b>Batch</b> <b>reactors</b> are also highly used in waste water treatment. They are effective in reducing BOD (biological oxygen demand)of influent untreated water.|$|R
50|$|Reactors can {{be divided}} into two broad categories, <b>batch</b> <b>reactors</b> and {{continuous}} <b>reactors.</b> <b>Batch</b> <b>reactors</b> are stirred tanks sufficiently large to handle the full inventory of a complete batch cycle. In some cases, <b>batch</b> <b>reactors</b> may be operated in semi batch mode where one chemical is charged to the vessel and a second chemical is added slowly. Continuous reactors are generally smaller than <b>batch</b> <b>reactors</b> and handle the product as a flowing stream. Continuous reactors may be designed as pipes with or without baffles or a series of interconnected stages. The advantages of the two options are considered below.|$|R

50|$|It can {{be argued}} that heat {{transfer}} coefficient is also an important parameter. It has to be recognized however that large <b>batch</b> <b>reactors</b> with external cooling jackets have severe heat transfer constraints by virtue of design. It is difficult to achieve better than 100 Watts/litre even with ideal heat transfer conditions. By contrast, continuous reactors can deliver cooling capacities in excess of 10,000 W/litre.
