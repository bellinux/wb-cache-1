National audienceThe {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to propose a new reliability analysis method for X-by-Wire systems, which includes both dynamic performance and static redundancy of the system. X- by-wire systems must meet not only reliability but also real-time requirements. In this context, we propose an integrated approach for evaluating both the performance in presence of perturbations - the <b>Behavioural</b> <b>Reliability</b> - and the evaluation of reliability based on classical failure rates of the components - the Static Reliability - of X-by-Wire systems. An example of quantification is given to illustrate the proposed method...|$|E
40|$|International audienceAdaptive systems {{behaviours}} can be intuitively programmed, using {{rule based}} middleware, {{as a set}} of rules. The rules verify conditions and perform actions in order to achieve a set of objectives. However, this raises several problems. First, inconsistencies may result from the fact that an action is not actually performed due to a communication error or a hardware failure. Second, the rules may be conflicting and their sequential chaining may lead to undesirable behaviour. This paper proposes an approach that combines transactional and <b>behavioural</b> <b>reliability</b> (i. e. consistency and no conflict) in adaptive middleware. This approach is implemented using the middleware LINC and the automata based language Heptagon/BZR. A case study, in the field of building automation, is presented to illustrate the approach...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} two <b>behavioural</b> interfaces for <b>reliability</b> analysis: dynamic fault trees, which {{model the}} system reliability {{in terms of}} the reliability of its components and Arcade, which models the system reliability at an architectural level. For both formalisms, the reliability is analyzed by transforming the DFT or Arcade model to a set of input-output Markov Chains. By using compositional aggregation techniques based on weak bisimilarity, significant reductions in the state space can be obtained...|$|R
40|$|Although {{a number}} of {{questionnaires}} {{have been developed to}} measure romantic jealousy, {{there is a lack of}} independent research that has substantiated their psychometric properties and minimal research that has tested and applied these measures in a consistent and reliable way. We aimed to address these gaps by providing the first validation study of an existing measure of romantic jealousy—the Multidimensional Jealousy Scale (MJS). The MJS was subjected to exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses in two separate samples of individuals in romantic relationships of at least 2 months duration. A 17 -item Short-Form MJS (SF-MJS) was supported, with three factors representing cognitive, emotional, and <b>behavioural</b> jealousy. Internal <b>reliabilities</b> were high. Consistent evidence supported the discriminant and concurrent validity of the SF-MJS. Overall, the current research provides a brief, validated measure of romantic jealousy for use in the general population. Potential clinical uses are discussed...|$|R

Each of these constructs should be considered when examining children's levels of psychological adjustment following stressful life events. A paediatric instrument that accounts for both positive and negative impact of stressful events has not been investigated in The Netherlands before. The aim {{of the study was to}} investigate psychometric properties of the Dutch version of the Benefit and Burden Scale for Children (BBSC), a 20 -item questionnaire that intends to measure potential benefit and burden of illness in children. Dutch paediatric survivors of childhood cancer aged 8 - 18 (N[*]=[*] 77) completed the BBSC and other psychological questionnaires: Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (health-related quality of life), State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children (anxiety), Children's Revised Impact of Event Scale (posttraumatic stress) and Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (<b>behavioural</b> functioning). <b>Reliability</b> and validity were evaluated. Internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha, benefit 0. 84, burden 0. 72), test-retest reliability (benefit r[*]=[*] 0. 74, burden r[*]=[*] 0. 78) and homogeneity (mean inter-item correlation, benefit r[*]=[*] 0. 34, burden r[*]=[*] 0. 22) were satisfactory. Burden was associated with HRQoL (-), anxiety (+), posttraumatic stress symptoms (+) and behavioural problems. Benefit did not correlate with the psychological outcomes. The Dutch version of the BBSC shows promising psychometric properties. Perceived benefit and disease-related burden are distinct constructs; both should be considered when examining children's psychological adjustment to potentially traumatic experiences. The BBSC may be useful as monitoring and screening instrumen...|$|R

40|$|Primary objective: The aim of {{the present}} study was to explore the {{concurrent}} validity, inter-rater agreement and diagnostic sensitivity of a French adaptation of the Coma Recovery Scale–Revised (CRS-R) as compared to other coma scales such as the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), the Full Outline of UnResponsiveness scale (FOUR) and the Wessex Head Injury Matrix (WHIM). Research design: Multi-centric prospective study. Method and procedures: To test concurrent validity and diagnostic sensitivity, the four behavioural scales were administered in a randomized order in 77 vegetative and minimally conscious patients. Twenty-four clinicians with different professional backgrounds, levels of expertise and CRS-R experience were recruited to assess inter-rater agreement. Main outcomes and results: Good concurrent validity was obtained between the CRS-R and the three other standardized <b>behavioural</b> scales. Inter-rater <b>reliability</b> for the CRS-R total score and sub-scores was good, indicating that the scale yields reproducible findings across examiners and does not appear to be systematically biased by profession, level of expertise or CRS-R experience. Finally, the CRS-R demonstrated a significantly higher sensitivity to detect MCS patients, as compared to the GCS, the FOUR and the WHIM. Conclusion: The results show that the French version of the CRS-R is a valid and sensitive scale which can be used i...|$|R
40|$|This study {{contributes}} to the setting/industry specific metrics vs. the SERVQUAL metric debate. It also revisits the causality of relationships between customer loyalty dimensions {{and the effects of}} customer satisfaction on the latter. Evidence drawn from Greek banking, was analysed under a structural equations approach. Though generic, SERVQUAL was found to outperform all other metrics in terms of both grasping the particularities of the research setting and reflecting service quality's effects. The banking specific BANQUAL-R and BSQ metrics failed in all above respects. SERVQUAL is capable of providing reliable service quality measurement in banking. Proposed industry specific metrics should be used with extreme caution. Customer satisfaction's effects among loyalty's dimensions were found unequal. The causality of relationships between loyalty dimensions runs from word-of-mouth to business extension passing through business retention. Customer satisfaction campaigns should better be targeted at attitudinal rather than <b>behavioural</b> loyalty.

40|$|MASTER (MAnaging Speeds of Traffic on European Roads) aims {{to provide}} re-commendations for speed {{management}} strategies and policies and develop {{guidelines for the}} development of innovative speed management tools. This document reviews the relevant literature and various Advanced Transport Telematics (ATT) and traditional (non-ATT) methods of reducing driver speed are evaluated. It is concluded that traditional methods such as traffic calming can be effective at reducing speed at isolated sites. However their effects are localised in time and space, and have the additional drawbacks of lack of public acceptability, secondary costs such as noise and pollution, and possible accident migration. The most successful measures appear to be those which require drivers physically to lower their speed (e. g road humps) or alter the way in which drivers perceive the road (e. g. perceptual countermeasures). Technologically innovative methods offer opportunities of providing feedback to individual drivers, of implementing variable speed limits to maintain traffic flow and of automating longitudinal control by means of speed limiters and adaptive cruise control. It was concluded that informative systems have much smaller negative safety effects than intervening systems and appear to be more acceptable to drivers. ATT technologies are promising, but the associated issues of <b>reliability,</b> <b>behavioural</b> adaptation and acceptability merit further research. Trials will be carried out on a driving simulator to establish the relative contributions of various ATT and non-ATT speed reduction measures to safety...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate inter-observer and test-retest <b>reliability</b> of different <b>behavioural</b> observations to be used in an on-farm, animal welfare monitoring system for veal calves. Twenty-three veal calf farms, varying in size, housing system, feeding regime and age of the calves were visited twice with two observers, simultaneously. Behavioural tests were conducted in eight pens per farm, measuring the response of calves to: a human entering the barn; a novel object; a passive, unfamiliar person; disturbance in the pen and an active approach by an unfamiliar and a familiar person. Furthermore, behaviour was recorded 20 min before and 20 min after feeding in eight other pens per farm. For all <b>behavioural</b> tests, inter-observer <b>reliability</b> was very high. Farm effects and test-retest reliabilities were high and significant for all behavioural tests, except for the test measuring response to disturbance in the pen. Although the active approach test with the familiar person was reliable, it was not feasible in practice due to the availability of the farmer. Since the active approach test with the unfamiliar person gave similar results, this test was recommended for an on-farm animal welfare monitoring system. For most behavioural elements recorded around feeding, farms differed significantly and inter-observer and test-retest reliabilities were high as well as being significant. The behavioural tests with entering the barn, novel object and unfamiliar person, and the behavioural observations before and after feeding were feasible and distinctive and reliable enough to be performed on-farm. These methods are promising tools to use as a monitor of animal welfare in veal calve...|$|R
40|$|Bibliography: pages 224 - 231. The {{purpose of}} this study was to develop a {{performance}} appraisal system for truck drivers in a wine manufacturing organization. One of the objectives of the system developed, was to improve the performance of the truck drivers. The sample involved in this study consisted of 80 truck drivers and six transport foremen. A preliminary study was done to determine the satisfaction of the drivers with the previous appraisal system. A need for a new performance appraisal system was established and it was therefore decided to develop a new performance appraisal system for the truck drivers in the Transport Department of the organization. A literature review indicated that the most suitable appraisal system for this specific situation was the behavioural observation scale (BOS). A job analysis of the truck driver's job was done, critical incidents were collected and behavioural dimensions were defined. This resulted in the final behavioural observation scale consisting of 37 <b>behavioural</b> items. The <b>reliability</b> of the appraisal instrument determined by Cronbach's coefficient alpha, was. 98. An effort was made to achieve both content and face validity for the BOS. To determine whether the performance of the truck drivers did increase as a result of the new appraisal system, an experimental and control group were defined. Their performance was appraised three times at three-monthly intervals with the BOS. The experimental group received feedback on its performance, which included setting goals to be achieved by the next appraisal. The drivers in the control group were unaware of the fact that their performance was being appraised. To determine whether the performance of the drivers in the experimental group had improved, planned comparisons were done. There was a substantial improvement in performance amongst the experimental group, whilst the control group's performance remained unchanged. It was concluded that the intervention was successful. The use of a behavioural approach to performance linked with adequate feedback made a major contribution to the efficiency of these truck drivers as well as to their interaction with their supervisors, the transport foremen...|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} {{was concerned with}} consistency between three types of trait interaction and verbal behaviour in small student discussion groups. Hypotheses based on trait interactions of varying saliency were tested against samples of verbal behaviour. Using three successive classes of first-year Psychology students, Ss were {{selected on the basis}} of scores on the Spielberger STAI, the Wrenn Study Habits Inventory and the Eysenck Personality Inventory. Nineteen leaderless groups were formed, with two male and two female members. The discussions were scored using Bales' Interaction Process Analysis. The first study was concerned with extreme trait interactions involving two dimensions, neither of which was considered to be prominent in small group behaviour. The data, supplemented by other measures, provided strong support for the consistency hypothesis. The second study dealt with extreme trait interactions involving two dimensions, one of which was considered to be prominent in small group behaviour. The data with respect to interactions involving high extraversion provided better support for the consistency hypothesis than those involving low extraversion. The third study was concerned with trait interactions, involving extreme scores on only one dimension. Consistency was more evident in the high and low anxiety groups, than in the high and low extraversion groups. The demonstration of consistency depended on the nature of the trait interaction. Interactions involving more than one extreme trait provided strong confirmation of the consistency hypothesis on the basis of the observational record alone; weaker interactions required supplementary data; some trait interactions - notably those involving low extraversion - were associated with unpredictable <b>behavioural</b> correlates. The <b>reliability</b> of the data was checked using comparison groups, test-retest trials of the personality inventories, tests of the scoring method, and feedback from the Ss. Taken as a whole, and in the absence of replication, the links between the three types of trait interaction and verbal behaviour were shown to have consistent characteristics across all three studies...|$|R
