5|$|Based on the {{information}} his journalists had gathered from eyewitnesses in Gibraltar and that provided by the Spanish authorities, Bolton <b>believed</b> <b>his</b> team had enough to broadcast a documentary about the Gibraltar shootings. The journalists filmed those eyewitnesses {{who were willing to}} speak on camera. They also rented a helicopter, and—with the assistance of the Spanish authorities, who provided two police officers who had taken part in the operation—filmed a reconstruction of the Spanish surveillance operation.|$|E

60|$|An {{explanation}} ensued, if {{that could}} be called an explanation, which plunged the unfortunate Fernando into tenfold perplexity. If he might <b>believe</b> <b>his</b> eyes, he saw before him his beloved Serafina; if he might <b>believe</b> <b>his</b> ears, it was merely her hereditary form and features, perpetuated {{in the person of}} her great-granddaughter.|$|R
5|$|Based on {{variations}} {{in the size of}} the yearly catch, Hume and others <b>believed</b> <b>his</b> methods of fish-propagation to be successful. However, as salmon runs declined over time despite the hatcheries, recreational fishing interests began to oppose large-scale operations. In 1910, a state referendum banned commercial fishing on the Rogue, but this decision was reversed in 1913. As fish runs continued to dwindle, the state legislature finally closed the river to commercial fishing in 1935.|$|E
5|$|Due to his size, McGrattan <b>believed</b> <b>his</b> {{best chance}} of {{making it to the}} NHL was as an enforcer. Dennis Bonvie, the all-time penalty leader in {{professional}} hockey, taught him to be a better fighter while the two were teammates in Binghamton. After posting 173 PIM in 2002–03, McGrattan finished second in the AHL with 327 in 2003–04. He then set an AHL single-season record for penalties with 551 in 2004–05.|$|E
5|$|In later medieval prayers, Elves {{appear as}} a threatening, even demonic, force. For example, there are prayers which invoke God's help against noctural attacks by Alpe. Correspondingly, in the early modern period, elves are {{described}} in north Germany doing the evil bidding of witches; Martin Luther <b>believed</b> <b>his</b> mother to have been afflicted in this way.|$|E

5|$|Loving's early {{adulthood}} involved several stints in the U.S. Army as a musician, and later regimental bandleader. A later {{period of study}} at the New England Conservatory of Music ended when Loving decided to rejoin the Army over the protests of his professors, who <b>believed</b> <b>his</b> talent as a cornetist would be wasted. After withdrawing from the conservatory, Loving was given command of the band of the 45th United States Volunteer Infantry Regiment.|$|E
5|$|Many Southerners <b>believed</b> <b>his</b> {{warnings}} and read every political news {{story from the}} North as {{further evidence of the}} planned destruction of the white southern way of life. The climax came a decade after Calhoun's death with the election of Republican Abraham Lincoln in 1860, which led to the secession of South Carolina, followed by six other Southern states. They formed the new Confederate States, which, in accordance with Calhoun's theory, did not have any organized political parties.|$|E
5|$|Morgan had his men tap the Union {{telegraph}} {{lines and}} send conflicting reports about {{his strength and}} destination.

5|$|Across the Central Highlands of Vietnam, the South Vietnamese {{military}} {{enjoyed a}} numerical superiority of about 78,300 soldiers against North Vietnam’s 65,141 soldiers. However, within {{the vicinity of}} Ban Me Thuot, the South Vietnamese were actually outnumbered by a ratio of 5:1. The North Vietnamese had more tanks, armoured vehicles, and heavy artillery, with a ratio of about 2:1. North Vietnamese General Van Tien Dung <b>believed</b> <b>his</b> tank and artillery units in the Central Highlands were the key factors that guaranteed a quick victory, because South Vietnam simply lacked the capability to withstand such large numbers of heavy weaponry.|$|E
5|$|Blaine {{had always}} <b>believed</b> <b>his</b> health to be fragile, {{and by the}} time he joined Harrison’s cabinet he truly was unwell. The years at the State Department also brought Blaine {{personal}} tragedy as two of his children, Walker and Alice, died suddenly in 1890. Another son, Emmons, died in 1892. With these family issues and his declining health, Blaine decided to retire and announced that he would resign from the cabinet on June 4, 1892. Because of their growing animosity, and because Blaine’s resignation came three days before the 1892 Republican National Convention began, Harrison suspected that Blaine was preparing to run against him for the party’s nomination for president.|$|E
5|$|Born in Cenade {{village in}} Transylvania's Alba County (at {{the time in}} Alsó-Fehér County), Agârbiceanu was the second of eight children; his parents were Nicolae and Ana (née Olariu). His father and {{grandfather}} were both woodcutters, while he <b>believed</b> <b>his</b> great-grandparents were cowherds, {{as indicated by the}} surname of his grandfather, Vasile , who originated in the Sibiu area. The name Agârbiceanu came from the family's ancestral village, Agârbiciu. According to the novelist's own notes, his father was literate and subscribed to a number of Romanian-language publications that appeared in Transylvania. His mother, although a great lover of stories and storytelling, was illiterate.|$|E

5|$|Both Democrats and Republicans were {{concerned}} about the presence of S. Brewer Erwin, nominee of the newly formed Populist Party, in the race; he enjoyed strong support for a third-party candidate, despite the fact that many <b>believed</b> <b>his</b> party's platform was too radical. Democrats, who were used to carrying the agrarian vote by a wide margin, were especially concerned that the Farmers' Alliance, consisting of over 125,000 members in Kentucky, would endorse Erwin. This did not occur, however, and in the general election, Brown defeated Wood by a vote of 144,168 to 116,087. Though he won the election, Brown had not won a majority of the votes; Populist Erwin captured 25,631 votes – 9 percent of the total cast – and a Prohibition candidate received 3,292 votes.|$|E
5|$|Candaules {{depicts a}} scene from the first book of the Histories by Herodotus. Candaules, king of the ancient kingdom of Lydia, <b>believed</b> <b>his</b> wife Nyssia to be the world's most {{beautiful}} woman. He discussed his wife's beauty with his favourite bodyguard Gyges, but felt Gyges was lying when he told him that he agreed about her beauty. Candaules arranged, over the protests of Gyges, for Gyges to hide behind his bedroom door and secretly watch Nyssia undressing without her knowledge. Although he was unhappy at being forced to take part, Gyges reluctantly hid behind the door and watched Nyssia undress. Nyssia noticed Gyges as he slipped out of the room afterwards, but remained silent.|$|E
5|$|During {{the voyage}} to England the team {{conducted}} training drills on the ship's deck; for this the forwards were coached by Gallaher and fellow player Bill Cunningham, while Stead {{was in charge}} of the backs. Consequently, the services of the NZRFU-appointed coach Jimmy Duncan were not used; his appointment had caused opposition from many in the squad who <b>believed</b> <b>his</b> expertise was not required, and that an extra player should have been taken on tour instead. After a six-week voyage, the team arrived in Plymouth, England on 8September 1905.|$|E

5|$|In late 1970, Vicki Cole {{indicated}} {{in an interview}} Nixon was doing the best he could. During the 1972 campaign, Cole served as Ohio chair of a future voters organization for the Nixon campaign. She then left politics, devoting her spare time to training and showing horses. In 1974, Cole {{declined to comment on}} the resignation of President Nixon in the wake of the Watergate scandal, but stated in 1977 that she felt sympathy for him, though she <b>believed</b> <b>his</b> resignation was necessary.|$|E
5|$|It was {{reported}} in 2006 that suicide {{was one of the}} top causes of death of Singapore youths. In 2001, five children younger than 15 years took their lives, and 37 people between the ages of 15 and 25 did so. The coroner's report of a junior college student who killed himself because he <b>believed</b> <b>his</b> penis was too small {{was reported}} in the international media. The pressure exerted by parents on their children to produce good academic results has also been a contributing factor in some suicides.|$|E
5|$|Nasal {{imagery and}} {{references}} appear in his music and lyrics, {{as well as}} in the collage album covers created by his long-time collaborator Cal Schenkel. Zappa <b>believed</b> <b>his</b> childhood diseases might have been due to exposure to mustard gas, released by the nearby chemical warfare facility. His health worsened when he lived in Baltimore. In 1952, his family relocated for reasons of health. They next moved to Monterey, California, where his father taught metallurgy at the Naval Postgraduate School. They soon moved to Claremont, California, then to El Cajon, before finally settling in San Diego.|$|E
