At this time, the ground crews switched it from a fast fill to a replenish system. However, the LOX in the tanks began to fall, i.e., it was not being replenished.

40|$|The {{inner vessel}} heads {{including}} bypass and beam tubes {{had just been}} welded into place and dye penetrant checked. The vacuum heads were not on at this time but the vacuum shell was on covering the piping penetrating into the inner vessel. Signal boxes with all feed through boards, the instrumentation box, and high voltage boxes were all installed with their pump outs capped. All 1 / 4 -inch instrumentation lines were terminated at their respective shutoff valves. All vacuum piping used for pumping down the inner vessel was isolated using o-ring sealed <b>blind</b> <b>flanges.</b> PV 215 A (VAT Series 12), the 4 -inch VRC gate valve isolating the cyropump, and the rupture disk {{had to be removed}} and replaced with <b>blind</b> <b>flanges</b> before pressurizing due to their pressure limitations. Stresses in plates used as <b>blind</b> <b>flanges</b> were checked using Code calcualtions. Before the CC test, vacuum style blanks and clamps were hydrostatically pressure tested to 150 % of the maximum test pressure, 60 psig. The Code inspector and Research Division Safety had all given their approval to the test pressure and procedure prior to filling the vessel with argon. The test was a major success. Based on the lack of any distinguishable pressure drop indicated on the pressure gages, the vessel appeared to be structurally sound throughout the duration of the test (approx. 3 hrs.). A major leak in the instrumentation tubing was discovered at half of the maximum test pressure and was quickly isolated by crimping and capping with a compression fitting. There were some slight deviations in the actual procedure used. The 44 psig relief valve located just outside the cleanroom had to be capped until the pressure in the vessel indicated 38 psi. This was to allow higher supply pressures and hence, higher flows through the pressurizing line. Also, in order to get pressure readings at the cryostat without exposing any personnel to the potentially dangerous stored energy near the maximum test pressure, a camera was installed {{at the top of the}} vessel to view the indicator mounted there. The monitor was viewed at the ante room adjacent to the cleanroom. The holding pressure of 32 psig (4 / 5 of the maximum test pressure) was only maintained for about 20 minutes instead of the half hour recommendation in the procedure. We felt that this was sufficient time to Snoop test and perform the pressure drop test. After the test was completed, the inspector for CBI Na-Con and the Research Divison Safety Officer signed all of required documentation...|$|R

40|$|Many {{conceptual}} {{designs for}} advanced short-takeoff, vertical landing (ASTOVL) aircraft need exhaust nozzles that can vector the jet to provide forces and moments for controlling the aircraft's movement or attitude in flight near the ground. A type of nozzle that can both vector the jet and vary the jet flow area {{is called a}} vane nozzle. Basically, the nozzle consists of parallel, spaced-apart flow passages formed by pairs of vanes (vanesets) that can be rotated on axes perpendicular to the flow. Two important features {{of this type of}} nozzle are the abilities to vector the jet rearward up to 45 degrees and to produce less harsh pressure and velocity footprints during vertical landing than does an equivalent single jet. A one-third-scale model of a generic vane nozzle was tested with unheated air at the NASA Lewis Research Center's Powered Lift Facility. The model had three parallel flow passages. Each passage was formed by a vaneset consisting of a long and a short vane. The longer vanes controlled the jet vector angle, and the shorter controlled the flow area. Nozzle performance for three nominal flow areas (basic and plus or minus 21 percent of basic area), each at nominal jet vector angles from - 20 deg (forward of vertical) to + 45 deg (rearward of vertical) are presented. The tests were made with the nozzle mounted on a model tailpipe with a <b>blind</b> <b>flange</b> on the end to simulate a closed cruise nozzle, at tailpipe-to-ambient pressure ratios from 1. 8 to 4. 0. Also included are jet wake data, single-vaneset vector performance for long/short and equal-length vane designs, and pumping capability. The pumping capability arises from the subambient pressure developed in the cavities between the vanesets, which could be used to aspirate flow from a source such as the engine compartment. Some of the performance characteristics are compared with characteristics of a single-jet nozzle previously reported...|$|E
40|$|Utilities in the U. S. operate over 75, 000 km (47, 000 miles) of old {{cast-iron}} pipes for gas distribution. The bell-and-spigot joints {{that connect}} pipe sections together tend to leak as these pipes age. Current repair practices are costly and highly disruptive. The {{objective of this}} program is to design, test and commercialize a robotic system capable of sealing multiple cast-iron bell and spigot joints from a single pipe entry point. The proposed system will perform repairs while the pipe remains in service by traveling through the pipe, cleaning each joint surface, and installing a stainless-steel sleeve lined with an epoxy-impregnated felt across the joint. This approach will save considerable time and labor, avoid traffic disruption, and eliminate any requirement to interrupt service to customers (which would result in enormous expense to utilities). Technical challenges include: (1) repair sleeves must compensate for diametric variation and eccentricity of old cast-iron pipes; (2) the assembly must travel long distances through pipes containing debris; (3) the pipe wall must be effectively cleaned in the immediate area of the joint to assure good bonding of the sleeve; and (4) an innovative bolt-on entry fitting is required to conduct repair operations on live mains. The development effort is divided into eleven tasks. Task 1 (Program Management) and Task 2 (Establishment of Detailed Design Specifications) were completed previously. Task 3 (Design and Fabricate Ratcheting Stainless-Steel Repair Sleeves) has progressed to installing prototype sleeves in test cast-iron pipe segments. Efforts in the current quarter continued {{to be focused on}} Tasks 4 - 8. Highly valuable lessons were learned from field tests of the 4 -inch gas pipe repair robot in cast-iron pipe at Public Service Electric & Gas. (These field tests were conducted and reported previously.) Several design issues were identified which need to be implemented in both the small- and large-diameter repair robots for cast-iron pipe to assure their commercial success. For Task 4 (Design, Fabricate and Test Patch Setting Robotic Train), previous problems with bladder design and elastomeric material expansion in the large mains were addressed. A new bladder based on a commercially available design was obtained and tested with success. Minor improvements were highlighted during patch-setting tests and are now being pursued. For Task 5 (Design and Fabricate Pipe-Wall Cleaning Robot Train with Pan/Zoom/Tilt Camera), the previous field tests showed clearly that, in mains with low gas velocities, {{it will be necessary to}} improve the system's capacity to remove debris from the immediate vicinity of the bell and spigot joints. Otherwise, material removed by the cleaning flails (the flails were found to be very effective in cleaning bell and spigot joints) falls directly to the low side of the pipe and accumulates in a pile. This accumulation can prevent the sleeve from achieving a leak-free repair. Similarly, it is also deemed necessary to design an assembly to capture existing servicetap coupons and allow their removal from the inside of the pipe. Task 6 (Design and Build Surface Control and Monitoring System) was previously completed with the control and computer display functions being operated through LabVIEW. However, this must now be revisited to add control routines for the coupon catcher that will be added. This will most likely include a lift-off/place-on magnet translation function. Task 7 (Design and Fabricate Large Diameter Live Access System) progressed to completing the detailed design for a bolt-on entry fitting for 12 -inch diameter cast-iron pipe in the current quarter. The drilling assembly for cutting an access hole through the wall of the gas main was also designed, along with a plug assembly to allow removing all tools from the live main and setting a <b>blind</b> <b>flange</b> on the entry fitting prior to burial. These designs are described in detail in the report. Task 8 (System Integration and Laboratory Validation) continued with the development of the robot module inter-connects and of a master LabVIEW-based system display and control software...|$|E
40|$|Atmospheric-Pressure Laser Ionization (APLI) was {{developed}} at the University of Wuppertal as a sensitive atmospheric-pressure ionisation method {{for the analysis of}} non-polar aromatic hydrocarbons. The coupling of liquid chromatography (LC) with APLI was first realised with a Q-TOF Ultima (Waters) instrument in the form of LC-APLI-(TOF) MS. Because of its great separating power, gas chromatography presents an interesting alternative to LC. A plan was therefore drafted for coupling a gas chromatograph with the atmospheric-pressure ion source of the Q-TOF Ultima for APLI. To this end, an appropriate electrically heated transfer line was constructed. The front end of this transfer line could be mounted instead of a volatilisation stage on the otherwise unmodified atmospheric-pressure ion source. The parameters necessary to operate the source, such as the amounts of gas within the source and settings on the mass spectrometer, were optimised. The efficiency of this new coupling was demonstrated by the analysis of a number of standards (PAHs and hetero-PAHs). On the basis of this successful coupling, APLI was also coupled with another atmosphericpressure mass spectrometer (micrOTOF, Bruker Daltonics). For this, a new ion source {{was developed}} for the mass spectrometer, to replace the standard one. The central component of the new source, which can be used for LC as well as for GC versions of APLI-(TOF) MS, is a cube-shaped source body with several apertures. Various additional components, such as the volatilisation stage of liquid chromatography or the newly developed transfer line, could be mounted onto the body. After important parameters had been optimised, a number of standards as well as real samples were analysed with both the LC-APLI-(TOF) MS and GCAPLI-(TOF) MS systems, in order to show the potential of this coupling. Thus, in addition to several aromatic oligomers used in the manufacture of organic light-emitting diodes, which are difficult to analyse by other methods, transition-metal complexes used as triplet emitters were successfully analysed by LC-APLI-(TOF) MS. Among examples of the application of GC-APLI-(TOF) MS, several PAH and hetero-PAH standards were analysed, and the pyrene metabolite 1 -hydroxypyrene was detected in urine. For chrysene, a detection limit of 0. 5 ng/L was achieved with an injection volume of 2 µL. In order to use the advantages of such a flexible coupling, in which the costly high-resolution mass spectrometer serves as detector for various chromatographic applications in conjunction with the three important atmospheric-pressure ionisation methods (ESI, APCI, APPI), these methods were integrated into the design. In addition, an improved version of the GC-transfer line was developed. This new design of a Multi-Purpose API-Source (MPIS) has been made commercially available by the company Bruker Daltonics as a flexible ion source for an atmospheric-pressure mass spectrometer. Switching between various ionisation methods is convenient, requiring only that the alternative components be exchanged at the apertures of the source body. For example, to switch from GC-APLI-(TOF) MS to GC-APCI-(TOF) MS, only a quartz window is replaced by the APCI needle assembly. Switching between LC und GC is possible in the same way: here only the transfer line has {{to be replaced by a}} <b>blind</b> <b>flange.</b> In this design, the ionisation methods can be applied either individually or in combination as true multimode ionisation (e. g. APLI and APCI simultaneously). The efficiency of the individual modes was demonstrated with several standards. With this source, ionisation techniques such as ESI, APCI, APPI and APLI are available for both LC and GC. For LC, the additional multimode ionisation techniques APLI+ESI and APLI+APCI can be used. APLI is a selective method for ionising non-polar aromatic compounds. On the one hand, this represents a limitation to the general applicability of the method, but on the other hand it makes it possible to ionise this class of compounds selectively in a complex matrix. Therefore ionisation labels and corresponding strategies for derivatisation were developed for LC-APLI- (TOF) MS and GC-APLI-(TOF) MS. These ionisation labels are aromatic compounds that can be detected with high sensitivity. They have an anchor group for covalent coupling with nonaromatic analytes. The derivative can then be detected sensitively by APLI. A study of REMPI spectra of several derivatives under atmospheric pressure showed that they do not differ significantly from those of the labels themselves, which indicates that the electronic proportion of the aromatic system of the derivative is not significantly influenced by the analyte. The practical application of the APLI ionisation labels was showen for LC-APLI- (TOF) MS and GC-APLI-(TOF) MS by study of a number of samples such as Brij® 72 and PEG 1000 and by the determination of the fatty acid content of vegetable oils and a technical fatty alcohol mixture...|$|E
