50|$|Charles George Hood Kinnear FRIBA ARSA FRSE (30 May 1830 - 5 November 1894) was {{one half}} of Peddie & Kinnear, one of Scotlandâ€™s most renowned and prodigious {{architectural}} firms, famed for their development of the Scots Baronial style, typified by Cockburn Street in Edinburgh which evokes a highly medieval atmosphere. Kinnear was also a pioneer photographer credited with inventing the <b>bellows</b> <b>attachment</b> on early cameras.|$|E

Equipment is fully compatible between all models manufactured between 1936 and 1969. The spelling found on cameras has traditionally been Exakta, but some early Kine-Exaktas were marked Exacta specifically for marketing in France, Portugal and the U.S., perhaps for copyright reasons; and certainly {{a great number of}} American collectors refer to the whole range as the [...] "Exacta." [...] A related line of smaller, simpler cameras was the [...] "Exa" [...] line; these, too, existed in several variations. The Beseler Topcon line of 35mm cameras used the same lens mount as the Exakta. In the early 1970s the Exakta [...] "RTL 1000" [...] was introduced; it accepted the older models' lenses but had its own range of viewfinders, which included a model with through-the-lens light metering. M42 lens mount variants of the RTL line of cameras also appeared under the Practica name.|$|R
