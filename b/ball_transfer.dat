50|$|<b>Ball</b> <b>transfer</b> units {{can also}} be used in a non-inverted ball down {{position}} as a type of caster, however this use is restricted by load-bearing limitations and the type of floor.

50|$|For a {{sequence}} of same-weight elastic objects constrained to a straight path, the effect continues to each successive object. For example, when two balls are dropped to strike three stationary balls in a cradle, there is an unnoticed but crucial small distance between the two dropped balls and the action is as follows: The first moving ball that strikes the first stationary ball (the 2nd ball striking the 3rd <b>ball)</b> <b>transfers</b> all its velocity to the 3rd ball and stops. The 3rd <b>ball</b> then <b>transfers</b> the velocity to the 4th ball and stops, and then the 4th to the 5th ball. Right behind this sequence is the 1st <b>ball</b> <b>transferring</b> its velocity to the 2nd ball that had just been stopped, and the sequence repeats immediately and imperceptibly behind the first sequence, ejecting the 4th ball right behind the 5th ball with the same small separation that was between the two initial striking balls. If they are simply touching when they strike the 3rd ball, the more complete solution described below is {{necessary in order to}} be precise.|$|R

40|$|Purpose. Justification of optimum heat {{treatment}} of <b>ball</b> <b>transfer</b> unit body {{was developed and}} patented by "Victoria Ltd. " (Ukraine). These modes of {{heat treatment}} had to assure the maximum carrying capacity of <b>ball</b> <b>transfer</b> unit {{and its ability to}} withstand the load impact with given impact energy. Also the state of unit operability was investigated subject to applied static loading. Design/methodology/approach. The special experimental equipment was designed and manufactured for research. It allowed to simulate the real working conditions of <b>ball</b> <b>transfer</b> unit during the experiments. Entire test cycle was divided into three phases. Initially the units were subjected to impact loading with falling weight under increasing impact energy up to destruction of a body. The influence of steel body hardness on unit dynamic strength was estimated. Then samples of <b>ball</b> <b>transfer</b> units were loaded with static forces applied to central ball. Maximum failure load was determined and real safety factors were calculated subject to body hardness. Also unit operability at maximum load was investigated. It was estimated by possibility of full twisting central ball in the unit body. Findings. Optimum regimes of hardening of the body and the actual ultimate load safety factor at the normal loading of the unit were defined. Originality. New results on structural strength of <b>ball</b> <b>transfer</b> unit with steel punching body were obtained. ???????????? ?????????? ????????????????? ???????????? ??????????????? ????????? ? ????????????????? ???? ????????? ?????????? ??????????? ???????????? ???

40|$|The {{component}} called <b>Ball</b> <b>Transfer</b> Unit {{is often}} used in the conveyor belt system for the automatic and rapid transport of luggage within the airport handling systems. The analysed component is a bearing in which a largest ball rotates over a belt of other small balls. Some of these components grip, but only the ones present in one airport near the seaside. The aim of the present examination {{is focused on the}} reliable identification of the causes which have produced the loss of the rotational attitude which represents the main functional property of this mechanical bearing component. Visual inspection, microscopic analysis (optical and SEM) and computational simulation have been carried out to understand the failure mechanism. In particular the computational analysis permits to calculate the stress state and the deformation induced on the bearing. In a first time the damage has been attributed on the different and often not regular depth of the carburised and hardened layer supporting the belt of the little ball. This irregularity seems to produce an excessive deformation of the supporting body and the consequent detachment of the zinc coating. The presence of debris in the bearing component seems to be the element which deteriorates the rotation of the balls involved in the system. On the other hand, the performed study has revealed that the cause of the disease is not the irregularity of the depth of the hardened layer, but the presence of an abrasive body composed by SiO 2, CaO and Al 2 O 3 of exogenous origin which can start up a wear mechanism...|$|E
