25|$|The {{cost of an}} ACL {{reconstruction}} surgery {{will vary}} due to a few different reasons such as where you live, which graft is used, if the meniscus is also torn, and the coverage of your insurance. A study has shown in 2016 that metropolitan areas, {{of at least one}} million residents, located on the western coast of the United States of America and areas like Minnesota, Indiana, and Michigan were more expensive that the East and South East coast of the United States. Another study, conducted by Baylor University, found that ACL reconstruction procedures using the bone-patella tendon-bone technique took 2.5 hours longer than using a hamstring graft. The operation room costs and hospital charges for that amount of extra time came to about $1,580 more expensive. This also applies to having a torn meniscus during the procedure. Fixing the torn cartilage will increase the procedure time, increasing cost. Insurance plays the biggest roll in cost for an ACL reconstruction since that it will <b>be</b> <b>covering</b> majority of the costs. The coverage of your plan, deductibles, and insurance company will determine how much the patient will pay in copay's.|$|E

500|$|The {{season was}} {{commissioned}} by James Hindle, the channel's factual entertainment commissioning editor, and announced in July 2006. It was to consist of three films broadcast in the 11pm slot, headlined by a documentary on mass public masturbation. This kind of programming was not unprecedented: the Channel had previously screened a 'Penis Week', reportedly described by MacKenzie as a [...] "success" [...] in a Guardian article. He continued {{on the subject of}} Wank Week, [...] "we feel this is exactly the type of provocative and mischievous programming that Channel 4 should <b>be</b> <b>covering</b> in the 11pm slot" [...] In the United Kingdom, the 11pm slot is considered post-watershed, defined by the regulator Ofcom in the Broadcasting Code as later than 9pm (although transition to more adult material [...] "must not be unduly abrupt at the watershed or after the time when children are particularly likely to be listening" [...] according to section 1.6). This allows the broadcasting of more sexually explicit content.|$|E

It enjoyed much more success than its predecessor and contains the well-known single [...] "Floating" [...] which was given much airplay on late night alternative radio shows. The lead single [...] "Floating" [...] was famously overheard being played in Whelan's in Dublin by the musician Brendan Benson. Benson immediately requested {{a copy of the}} album and then praised Jape in The Guardian – however, the newspaper spelt it [...] "Jabe". He also rang Egan personally to inform him he would <b>be</b> <b>covering</b> [...] "Floating" [...] with his band The Raconteurs. However, Egan has stated that he did not give Benson personal permission to cover the song. He did witness the cover live at the Olympia Theatre and was later to describe it as [...] "a great moment". The single is also covered by Soulwax during their DJ sets. Jape participated in two nationwide tours with both David Kitt and The Redneck Manifesto to promote the album's release. Kitt was co-producer of [...] "Floating". The band went on to perform at prominent Irish festivals such as Electric Picnic and Hard Working Class Heroes.|$|E

500|$|Metcalfe {{spoke of}} the new storyline, saying how [...] "honoured" [...] she was {{to take part in}} the storyline as well as praising the writer, Anna Clements: [...] "I'm honoured to have been given this storyline to raise {{awareness}} of such an important cause. Count the Kicks is a fantastic charity, which aims to teach expectant mothers about noticing changes in their pregnancy to reduce the risk of stillbirth. And working with Sands has helped me understand how Mercedes would cope with life after her baby has died. Mercedes has already been through so much tragedy in her life, but the death of her son will show a much more fragile side to her character. The scripts are brilliantly written by Anna Clements and with the help of the two charities, I was able to really understand what Mercedes is going through." [...] Erica Stewart, the bereavement support services manager at Sands, said: [...] "We're pleased to have been approached by the researchers and writers at Hollyoaks for advice and help to ensure that this heartbreaking storyline is portrayed truthfully and sensitively. Stillbirth is not rare and it's a tragedy that can happen to anyone. Sadly thousands of babies die each year in the UK. In 2013, over 100 babies every week were stillborn or died soon after birth. For a show like Hollyoaks with a youth focus to <b>be</b> <b>covering</b> this devastating experience is a brilliant way of raising awareness of the issues surrounding baby death among a younger audience who may have not otherwise come across them." [...] Metcalfe later further discussed the storyline, revealing that when she read the scripts she had [...] "a lump in my throat", which made cry and when she had finished reading the scripts, she was [...] "sat their sobbing". She continued to say: [...] "When it came to playing it on set I did minimal rehearsals because I didn't want to wear out the true meaning of the words." [...] before praising the script writing, calling them [...] "brilliant" [...] and stating she did not have to work hard to find the [...] "level of emotion", [...] "The words were all there on the page.
