50|$|Suzuki GB PLC quickly instigated {{a recall}} and all {{customers}} {{were provided with}} a loan vehicle. Within fourteen days of the incident, a modified <b>brake</b> <b>pedal</b> <b>release</b> mechanism had been installed on every affected customer vehicle.|$|R
50|$|Following this {{announcement}} by Suzuki GB PLC, other {{right hand drive}} importers, such as Australia, Ireland, and New Zealand quickly followed suit. Left hand drive markets were not affected; nor are cars manufactured and sold in India or Thailand. The condition was traced to an over sensitive <b>brake</b> <b>pedal</b> <b>release</b> mechanism. This mechanism is designed to retract after a heavy collision.|$|R

50|$|The {{reunion with}} Bonnet would be {{short-lived}} as they parted ways some time shortly thereafter. Impellitteri recruited Curtis Skelton as vocalist, <b>releasing</b> <b>Pedal</b> to the Metal in 2004, displaying {{some of their}} most aggressive music to date.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{simulation}} of railway air <b>brake</b> <b>release</b> demand of a twin-pipe graduated <b>release</b> railway air <b>brake</b> system based on the solution of partial differential equations gouerning one-dimensional $ow by the Jinite difference method supported by extrapolationlinterpolation. Air <b>brake</b> <b>release</b> demand is simulated as an exponential input of pressure. The analysis incorporates the corrections needed {{to be used for}} various restrictions in the brake pipeline. Results are in good agreement with the laboratory data...|$|R
50|$|At {{the point}} of impact it is {{estimated}} that the excursion train was doing at least 45 mph whilst the parcels train was probably stationary with its <b>brakes</b> <b>released.</b>|$|R
50|$|The maximum {{takeoff weight}} (also {{known as the}} maximum brake-release weight) is the maximum weight {{authorised}} at <b>brake</b> <b>release</b> for takeoff, or {{at the start of}} the takeoff roll.|$|R

50|$|<b>Brake</b> <b>release</b> {{weight is}} {{the weight of}} an {{aircraft}} {{at the start of}} a runway, just prior to <b>brake</b> <b>release</b> for take-off. This is the ramp weight minus any fuel used for taxiing. Major airports may have runways that are about 2 miles (3 km) long, so merely taxiing from the terminal to the end of the runway might consume up to a ton of fuel. After taxiing, the pilot lines up the aircraft with the runway and puts the brakes on. On receiving take-off clearance, the pilot throttles up the engines and <b>releases</b> the <b>brakes</b> to start accelerating along the runway in preparation for taking off.|$|R
50|$|Landing {{weight is}} {{the weight of}} an {{aircraft}} as it lands at the destination. This is the <b>brake</b> <b>release</b> weight minus the trip fuel burned. It includes the zero fuel weight, unusable fuel, and all alternate, holding, and reserve fuel.|$|R
50|$|Vacuum-operated hidden {{headlamps}} were added, which retracted upwards in {{event of}} failure. An automatic parking <b>brake</b> <b>release,</b> two-way power seats, power front disc brakes (rear drum), an indicator light for the headlight doors, and adjustable head restraints were all standard features.|$|R
40|$|Six {{months prior}} to {{shipment}} of the Broadband X-ray Telescope to the Kennedy Space Center for flight aboard the Space Shuttle Columbia, a major system failure occurred. During modal survey testing of the telescope's gimbal pointing system, the roll axis <b>brake</b> unexpectedly <b>released.</b> Low level vibration and static preloads present during the modal survey were within the expected flight environment. <b>Brake</b> <b>release</b> during shuttle liftoff or ascent was an unacceptable risk to mission success; thus, a Brake Lock Mechanism (BLM) was developed...|$|R
5000|$|Yo La Tengo {{covered the}} song on their 1990 album, Fakebook. It was also covered by The Mavericks, whose version peaked at number 42 on the U.S. Billboard Hot Country Singles & Tracks chart in 1999. Turin <b>Brakes</b> <b>released</b> their cover version as a B-side to their single, [...] "Something In My Eye".|$|R
40|$|A {{method for}} {{evaluating}} aircraft takeoff performance from <b>brake</b> <b>release</b> to air-phase height that requires fewer tests than conventionally required {{is evaluated with}} data for the XB- 70 airplane. The method defines the effects of pilot technique on takeoff performance quantitatively, including the decrease in acceleration from drag due to lift. For a given takeoff weight and throttle setting, a single takeoff provides enough data to establish a standardizing relationship for the distance from <b>brake</b> <b>release</b> to any point where velocity is appropriate to rotation. The lower rotation rates penalized takeoff performance in terms of ground roll distance; the lowest observed rotation rate required a ground roll distance that was 19 percent longer than the highest. Rotations at the minimum rate also resulted in lift-off velocities that were approximately 5 knots lower than the highest rotation rate at any given lift-off distance...|$|R

At 16:10:47 (137 seconds) and 1000 ft, the Trident was descending at 4500 ft/min m/s. Impact {{with the ground}} came at 16:11, precisely 150 seconds after <b>brake</b> <b>release.</b>|$|R

50|$|The Whike 1.0 was {{released}} on 5 June 2008. It has a standard 1.6 m2 sail and can reach speeds up to 50 km/h with wind speeds of 4-5 bft (13 - 24 mph). It can be legally used on both bike lanes and streets in the Netherlands and UK. Activating the front <b>brake</b> <b>releases</b> the sail's spinlock, assuring {{there will be no}} more wind-propulsion.|$|R
5000|$|Most of the band's {{material}} {{consisted of}} original songs composed by Bob Holmes, {{or by the}} team of Holmes and Milliken. However, the group also recorded takes on country and western classics such as Ennio Morricone's [...] "The Good, The Bad and The Ugly" [...] and the Patsy Cline standard [...] "Walkin' After Midnight". As well, their first independently released single was a cover of Dolly Parton's [...] "Jolene" [...] in 1981. Shortly after this single was <b>released,</b> <b>pedal</b> steel guitarist Stern left the band, {{to be replaced by}} Mark Tomeo.|$|R

50|$|Engine {{failure on}} {{take-off}} (EFTO) is a situation, when flying an aircraft, where an engine has failed, {{or is not}} delivering sufficient power, at any time between <b>brake</b> <b>release</b> and the wheels leaving the ground / V2. The phases of flight are de-lineated to allow simplified standard procedures for different aircraft types to be developed. If an aircraft suffered engine failure on takeoff, the standard procedure for most aircraft would be to abort the takeoff.|$|R

50|$|The {{main part}} of the set up is the winding motor which is driven by the dc motor. Two double deck cages are {{attached}} to the two ends of the winding rope. At the start of the winding cycle, power applied to winding motor is gradually increased and mechanical <b>brake</b> <b>released.</b> The cages accelerate then maintain a speed of 6 m/s until the cages approach the ends of the shaft. During deceleration, generator voltage driving the winding motor is reduced to produce regenerative braking and it is finally brought to rest by a mechanical brake.|$|R
