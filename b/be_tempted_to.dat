5|$|Multiple static {{lines of}} defence, {{to delay the}} enemy's advance.

5|$|During {{the early}} Julio-Claudian period, many {{auxiliary}} regiments raised in frontier provinces were stationed {{in or near}} their home provinces, except during periods of major crises such as the Cantabrian Wars, when they were deployed temporarily in theatre. This carried the obvious risk if their own tribe or ethnic group rebelled against Rome (or attacked the Roman frontier from outside the Empire), auxiliary troops could <b>be</b> <b>tempted</b> <b>to</b> make common cause with them. The Romans would then be faced by an enemy that included units fully equipped and trained by themselves, thus losing their usual tactical advantages over tribal foes.|$|E
5|$|G. Homer Durham, {{a member}} of the First Quorum of the Seventy, {{replaced}} Joseph Anderson as director of the Historical Department in 1977 and began restraining the History Division's activity. Durham required that all manuscripts go through him for approval before publication. He attempted to combine the Mormon History Trust Fund with the general department budget, but was prevented by Arrington. Durham also refrained from hiring new staff members to replace staff who had left. The multi-volume church history project was dropped, allowing the outside authors to seek publishers other than Deseret Book who would give them royalties and not <b>be</b> <b>tempted</b> <b>to</b> sanitize church history. Not all twelve authors completed their projects, but many books that started from the History Division project were later published through other publishers.|$|E

5|$|In the 1970s, the Soviet Union {{reached the}} peak of its {{political}} and strategic power {{in relation to the}} United States. The first SALT Treaty effectively established parity in nuclear weapons between the two superpowers, the Helsinki Treaty legitimised Soviet hegemony over Eastern Europe, and the United States defeat in Vietnam and the Watergate scandal weakened the prestige of the United States. Brezhnev and Nixon also agreed to pass the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, which banned both countries from designing systems that would intercept incoming missiles so that neither the U.S. or the Soviet Union would <b>be</b> <b>tempted</b> <b>to</b> strike the other without the fear of retaliation. The Soviet Union extended its diplomatic and political influence in the Middle East and Africa.|$|E
5|$|It {{remains unclear}} {{precisely}} why Steuart {{was reluctant to}} pursue Banks' defeated army more vigorously, and contemporary records shed little light on the matter. It may be that his thirteen years' training as a cavalry officer led him to obey orders to the letter, {{with little or no}} room for personal initiative or variation from strict due process. No charges were brought against him however, despite Jackson's reputation as a stern disciplinarian. It is possible that Jackson's leniency {{had to do with the}} strong desire of the Confederacy to recruit Marylanders to the Southern cause, and the need to avoid offending Marylanders who might <b>be</b> <b>tempted</b> <b>to</b> join Lee's army.|$|E
5|$|Napoleon did {{not stay}} still. The French Emperor decided {{to set a}} {{psychological}} trap in order to lure the Allies out. Days before any fighting, Napoleon had been giving the impression that his army was weak and that he desired a negotiated peace. About 53,000 French troops—including Soult, Lannes and Murat's forces—were assigned to take Austerlitz and the Olmutz road, occupying the enemy's attention. The Allied forces, numbering about 89,000, seemed far superior and would <b>be</b> <b>tempted</b> <b>to</b> attack the outnumbered French army. However, the Allies {{did not know that}} Bernadotte, Mortier and Davout were already within the supported distance, and could be called in by forced marches from Iglau and Vienna respectively, raising the French number to 75,000 troops.|$|E

25|$|It is {{said that}} the {{justification}} for the employment of eunuchs as high-ranking civil servants was that, since they were incapable of having children, they would not <b>be</b> <b>tempted</b> <b>to</b> seize power and start a dynasty.

25|$|It {{was thought}} that commanders might <b>be</b> <b>tempted</b> <b>to</b> think of the Armadillo as a mobile pillbox rather than any sort of tank or {{armoured}} car. To counter such a view, instructions emphasised its use as a mobile unit, not a static fort and {{it was to be}} reserved for the defence of the airfield and not given other tasks such as transporting ammunition or being driven off to find parachutists.|$|E
25|$|It is {{this second}} step {{which makes the}} {{technique}} one of non-probability sampling. In quota sampling {{the selection of the}} sample is non-random. For example, interviewers might <b>be</b> <b>tempted</b> <b>to</b> interview those who look most helpful. The problem is that these samples may be biased because not everyone gets a chance of selection. This random element is its greatest weakness and quota versus probability has been a matter of controversy for several years.|$|E
25|$|If {{we attempt}} to build a densely packed {{collection}} of spheres, we will <b>be</b> <b>tempted</b> <b>to</b> always place the next sphere in a hollow between three packed spheres. If five spheres are assembled in this way, they will be consistent {{with one of the}} regularly packed arrangements described above. However, the sixth sphere placed in this way will render the structure inconsistent with any regular arrangement. This results in the possibility of a random close packing of spheres which is stable against compression.|$|E

25|$|Loose {{medicines}} {{may not be}} carried; most {{authorities have}} agreed that it is preferable that one who constantly needs medication remain at home rather than transgressing Shabbat by carrying medication. But, if such a person leaves home, then comes in need of medication, it is permissible under the laws of Pikuach nefesh to break Shabbat and bring the medication to the person. A small number of authorities {{in recent years have}} been permitting carrying the medication, however, since such a person may <b>be</b> <b>tempted</b> <b>to</b> leave home without it, and then his/her life may be endangered thereafter.|$|E
25|$|Mass {{mobilization}} {{of ethnic groups}} can only be successful if there are latent ethnic differences to be exploited, otherwise politicians would not even attempt to make political appeals based on ethnicity and would focus instead on economic or ideological appeals. Hence, {{it is difficult to}} completely discount the role of inherent ethnic differences. Additionally, ethnic entrepreneurs, or elites, could <b>be</b> <b>tempted</b> <b>to</b> mobilize ethnic groups in order to gain their political support in democratizing states. Instrumentalists theorists especially emphasize this interpretation in ethnic states in which one ethnic group is promoted {{at the expense of other}} ethnicities.|$|E
25|$|In the USA, {{on average}} {{one third of}} grade A {{students}} have cheated.

He contends that even if a plagiarized paper receives a relatively low grade, that grade is actually high, given how much time and effort went into the paper. In the study mentioned above (in which students were allowed to bring crib sheets to a test but did not improve their scores), the researcher concluded that the students used the crib notes as alternatives to studying, rather than as complements to studying, and thus spent less time preparing for the exam.|$|E

25|$|In {{many places}} {{throughout}} the Hebrew Scriptures – particularly the Book of Hosea – Israel is figured as Yahweh's wife or bride. Malachi's discussion of divorce {{may also be}} understood to conform to this metaphor. Malachi {{could very well be}} urging his audience not to break faith with Yahweh (the God of Israel) by adopting new gods or idols. It is quite likely that, since the people of Judah were questioning Yahweh's love and justice (1:2, 2:17), they might <b>be</b> <b>tempted</b> <b>to</b> adopt foreign gods. William LaSor suggests that, because the restoration to the land of Judah had not resulted in anything like the prophesied splendor of the messianic age which had been prophesied, the people were becoming quite disillusioned with their religion.|$|E
25|$|Robertson wanted {{industrial}} conscription, {{national service}} for men up {{the age of}} 55, and 900,000 new army recruits, similar to the new German Hindenburg Programme. He was concerned at the Asquith Coalition's lack of firm leadership, once likening the Cabinet to “a committee of lunatics”, and although he avoided taking sides in party politics he urged {{the creation of a}} small War Committee which would simply give orders to the departmental ministers, and was concerned (letter to Hankey, 9 November) that ministers might <b>be</b> <b>tempted</b> <b>to</b> make peace or else to reduce Britain’s Western Front commitment. Robertson gave an abusive response to the Lansdowne Memorandum (13 November 1916) (calling those who wanted to make peace “cranks, cowards and philosophers … miserable members of society”).|$|E
25|$|Prior to the {{beginning}} of the war, shelter policy had been determined by Sir John Anderson, then Lord Privy Seal and, on the declaration of war, Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security. Anderson announced the policy to Parliament on 20 April 1939, based on a report from a committee chaired by Lord Hailey. This reaffirmed a policy of dispersal and eschewed the use of deep shelters, including the use of tube stations and underground tunnels as public shelters. Reasons given were the spread of disease due to the lack of toilet facilities at many stations, the inherent danger of people falling onto the lines, and that people sheltering in the stations and tunnels might <b>be</b> <b>tempted</b> <b>to</b> stay in them day and night because they would feel safer there than outside the stations.|$|E
