My diaphragm function, the way my throat feels, is not compromised in any way. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>have</b> {{to think about it}} more now. I have to remind myself to keep my ribs open. I have to remind myself, if my breath starts to stack. When I took a breath before, the weight would kick in and give it that extra Whhoomf! Now it doesn't do that. If I don't remember {{to get rid of the}} old air and re-engage the muscles, the breath starts stacking, and that's when you can't get your phrase, you crack high notes.|$|E

[...] And that's what this episode is about. No one {{has the right to}} force anyone to believe the things that they believe. That's one of the beautiful things about Gene Roddenberry's vision of IDIC (Infinite Diversity in Infinite Combinations), {{and that was one of}} the things that we really wanted to hammer home here. Sisko does everything he can not to impose his values on the Bajorans, but Vedek Winn is determined to impose her values on everyone.|$|E
500|$|Gaga first {{performed}} [...] "Gypsy" [...] on a {{grand piano}} for guests at a listening party for Artpop in Berlin's Berghain nightclub. She said of the song: [...] "I wrote this song as I was travelling around the world... They say 'a Gypsy doesn't have a home.' <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>have</b> a home. I have a home with you always." [...] Seated atop a piano wearing a bra and short blond hair, Gaga performed an acoustic version of the song, singing with a heavy German accent while sporting a moustache. Brenna Ehlrich of MTV noted that: [...] "Throughout the performance, fans looked on with tears in their eyes, watching as Gaga unfurled the simple love story with nothing but her voice and piano." [...] Malene Arpe, entertainment contributor to the Toronto Star, said her performance was goosebump-inducing and caused viewers {{to forget about the}} moustache [...] "right {{in the middle of her}} face." ...|$|E

500|$|City of Death {{is one of}} five Doctor Who serials {{from the}} series' {{original}} run (1963–1989) not to have been novelised by Target Books; the others are The Pirate Planet, Shada, Resurrection of the Daleks, and Revelation of the Daleks. Target approached Douglas Adams {{on a number of occasions}} with a view to commissioning a novelisation, offering their standard advance of £600; Adams replied saying, [...] "I don't want to be embarrassing <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>have</b> a tendency to be a best-selling author". Target, concerned that their regular authors would seek better terms, refused to change their offer. Several years later, Target editor Nigel Robinson offered an advance of £4,000– double what was the standard advance at the time– but Adams again declined. Adams was unwilling to allow another author to write the novelisation. However, after Adams' death his estate allowed Gareth Roberts to write an adaptation of the unfinished serial Shada, which was published by BBC Books in 2012. In 2013, Roberts announced that he was working on a novelisation of City of Death, to be published on 21 May 2015. Roberts later announced that James Goss was working on the book instead.|$|E

2500|$|As a teenager, DeLillo was not {{interested}} in writing until a summer job as a parking attendant, where hours spent waiting and watching over vehicles led to a reading habit. In a 2010 interview with The Australian, DeLillo reflected on this period by saying [...] "I had a personal golden age of reading, in my 20s and my early 30s, and then my writing began to take up so much time". Among the writers DeLillo read and was inspired by in this period were James Joyce, William Faulkner, Flannery O'Connor, and Ernest Hemingway, who was a major influence on DeLillo's earliest attempts at writing in his late teens. As well as the influence of modernist fiction, DeLillo has also cited the influence of jazz music – [...] "guys like Ornette Coleman and Mingus and Coltrane and Miles Davis" [...] – and postwar cinema: [...] "Antonioni and Godard and Truffaut, and then in the '70s came the Americans, many of whom were influenced by the Europeans: Kubrick, Altman, Coppola, Scorsese and so on. I don't know how they may have affected the way I write, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>have</b> a visual sense." [...] On the influence of film, particularly European cinema, on his work, DeLillo has said, [...] "European and Asian cinemas of the 1960s shaped the way I think and feel about things. At that time I was living in New York, I didn't have much money, didn't have much work, I was living in one room....I was a man in a small room. And I went to the movies a lot, watching Bergman, Antonioni, Godard. When I was little, in the Bronx, I didn't go to the cinema and I didn't think of the American films I saw as works of art. Perhaps, in an indirect way, cinema allowed me to become a writer." [...] DeLillo also credits his parents' leniency and acceptance of his desire to write for encouraging him to pursue a literary career: [...] "They ultimately trusted me to follow the course I’d chosen. This is something that happens if you’re the eldest son in an Italian family: You get a certain leeway, and it worked in my case." ...|$|E

On Radio 4's Midweek on 5 February 2014 Rice-Davies said of Stephen Ward, [...] "I didn't fall for him, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>have</b> an affair with him."

5000|$|Fred Woodworth is an anarchist and atheist {{writer based}} in the United States. He is an anarchist without {{adjective}}s, saying: [...] "I have no prefix or adjective for my anarchism.
