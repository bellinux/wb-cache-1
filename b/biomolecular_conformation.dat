Standard theoretical techniques employing a harmonic approximation in the evaluation of thermodynamic quantities such as free energy are shown to be unreliable for the analysis of conformer populations in flexible molecules. The TPIMC method is a general approach to the thermodynamic simulation of large molecules that treats anharmonicity and quantum effects within the torsional degrees of freedom...|$|E
40|$|We {{propose that}} a {{significant}} contribution to the power stroke of myosin and similar conformation changes in other biomolecules is the pressure of a single molecule (e. g. a phosphate ion) expanding a trap, a mechanism we call "ergodic pumping". We demonstrate the principle with a toy computer model and discuss the mathematics governing the evolution of slow degrees of freedom in large Hamiltonian systems. We indicate in detail how the mechanism could fit with known features of the myosin cycle. Many other <b>biomolecular</b> <b>conformation</b> changes could be driven in part by ergodic pumping. We suggest the use of ergodic pumping as a design principle in nanobiotechnology. (c) 2006 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved. ...|$|E
40|$|Single-molecule {{methods have}} become widely used for {{quantifying}} the conformational heterogeneity and structural dynamics of biomolecules in vitro. Their application in vivo, however, has remained challenging owing to shortcomings {{in the design}} and reproducible delivery of labeled molecules, the range of applicable analysis methods, and suboptimal cell culture conditions. By addressing these limitations in an integrated approach, we demonstrate the feasibility of probing protein dynamics from milliseconds down to the nanosecond regime in live eukaryotic cells with confocal single-molecule Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) spectroscopy. We illustrate the versatility of the approach by determining the dimensions and submicrosecond chain dynamics of an intrinsically disordered protein; by detecting even subtle changes in the temperature dependence of protein stability, including in-cell cold denaturation; and by quantifying the folding dynamics of a small protein. The methodology opens possibilities for assessing the effect of the cellular environment on <b>biomolecular</b> <b>conformation,</b> dynamics and function...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a novel {{approach}} for discovering kinetically metastable states of <b>biomolecular</b> <b>conformations.</b> Several kinetically-aware metrics which encode both geometric and kinetic information about biomolecules are proposed. We embed the new metrics into k-center clustering and r-cover clustering algorithms to estimate the metastable states. Those clustering algorithms using kinetically-aware metrics are tested {{on a large scale}} biomolecule conformation dataset. It turns out that our algorithms are able to identify the kinetic meaningful clusters. ...|$|R

This technique {{has recently been}} proposed for the efficient computation of <b>biomolecular</b> <b>conformations.</b> One crucial step of UC is the decomposition of reversible nearly uncoupled Markov chains into rapidly mixing subchains. We show how the underlying scheme of uncoupling-coupling can also be applied to stochastic differential equations {{where it can be}} translated into a domain decomposition technique for partial differential equations...|$|R
40|$|Open AccessIn {{this letter}} we {{describe}} {{a method to}} probe <b>biomolecular</b> <b>conformations</b> and their dynamics at the single molecule level. We show, using fluorescence anisotropy based methods, that the hydrodynamic volume of biomolecules captures the intrinsic heterogeneity within a population. Population distributions of conformations and their dynamics are studied by making anisotropy measurements on one molecule at a time within a confocal volume. The mean anisotropy of mRNA is lowered on addition of salt while the spread remains the same. The intrinsic heterogeneity is revealed when conformational transitions are frozen, resulting in a drastic increase in {{the spread of the}} anisotropy. These studies reveal that mRNA samples a broad range of conformations...|$|R

He made pioneering contributions in computational biology, modelling and {{what we now call}} bioinformatics. The triple helical coiled coil structure of collagen proposed by him forms the basis of much of collagen research at the molecular level. The Ramachandran map remains the simplest descriptor and tool for validation of protein structures. He has left his imprint on almost all aspects of <b>biomolecular</b> <b>conformation.</b> His contributions in the area of theoretical crystallography have been outstanding. His legacy has provided inspiration for the further development of structural biology in India. After a pause, computational biology and bioinformatics are in a resurgent phase.

40|$|Fluorescence {{resonance}} energy transfer (FRET) is a distance-sensitive method that correlates changes in fluorescence intensity with conformational changes, for example, of biomolecules in the cellular environment. Applied {{to the gas}} phase in combination with Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry, it opens up possibilities to define structural/ conformational properties of molecular ions, {{in the absence of}} solvent, and without the need for purification of the sample. For successfully observing FRET in the gas phase it is important to find suitable fluorophores. In this study several fluorescent dyes were examined, and the correlation between solution-phase and gas-phase fluorescence data were studied. For the first time, FRET in the gas phase is demonstrated unambiguously.

40|$|Many {{efforts to}} develop {{advanced}} medical diagnostic capabilities rely {{on the ability to}} perform size-based separations of DNA and proteins. Miniaturized formats have potential to provide rapid integrated solutions, but rational development requires an improved understanding of the physics underlying separation. This dissertation majorly focuses on the DNA transport in microchip gel electrophoresis systems. We have developed a transport model that allows us to determine the interplay between the hydrogel pore size distribution, the applied electric field strength, and DNA size in determining separation performance. This fundamental understanding makes it possible to access a unique DNA transport mode, entropic trapping, that becomes dominant when the hydrogel pore size is close that of DNA coil. Further investigation of the entropic trapping phenomena, both experimentally and computationally, shows how the inherently disordered dynamics governing macromolecular transport under nanoconfined surroundings can paradoxically be precisely controlled. This capability lays a foundation for a sensitive probe of nanoscale molecular conformation, revealing previously unseen details about DNA-protein binding interactions at size scales far below the limits of conventional techniques. A key breakthrough is that our method is the first practical application of stochastic resonance in entropic trapping transport of macromolecules (previously studied, but only theoretically), yielding a new tool to ?image? nanoscale details of <b>biomolecular</b> <b>conformation...</b>|$|E
40|$|AbstractAmyloid {{deposits}} of amylin in the pancreas {{are an important}} characteristic feature found in patients with Type- 2 diabetes. The aggregate has been considered important in the disease pathology and has been studied extensively. However, the secondary structures of the individual peptide have not been clearly identified. In this work, we present detailed solution structures of rat amylin {{using a combination of}} Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics simulations. A new Monte Carlo method is presented to determine the free energy of distinct <b>biomolecular</b> <b>conformations.</b> Both folded and random-coil conformations of rat amylin are observed in water and their relative stability is examined in detail. The former contains an α-helical segment comprised of residues 7 – 17. We find that at room temperature the folded structure is more stable, whereas at higher temperatures the random-coil structure predominates. From the configurations and weights we calculate the α-carbon NMR chemical shifts, with results that are in reasonable agreement with experiments of others. We also calculate the infrared spectrum in the amide I stretch regime, and the results are in fair agreement with the experimental line shape presented herein...|$|R
40|$|In many applications, {{the primary}} {{objective}} of numerical simulation of time-evolving systems is the prediction of macroscopic, or coarse-grained, quantities. A representative example is the prediction of <b>biomolecular</b> <b>conformations</b> from molecular dynamics. In recent years {{a number of new}} algorithmic approaches have been introduced to extract effective, lower-dimensional, models for the macroscopic dynamics; the starting point is the full, detailed, evolution equations. In many cases the effective low-dimensional dynamics may be stochastic, even when the original starting point is deterministic. This review surveys a number of these new approaches to the problem of extracting effective dynamics, highlighting similarities and differences between them. The importance of model problems for the evaluation of these new approaches is stressed, and a number of model problems are described. When the macroscopic dynamics is stochastic, these model problems are either obtained through a clear separation of time-scales, leading to a stochastic effect of the fast dynamics on the slow dynamics, or by considering high dimensional ordinary differential equations which, when projected onto a low dimensional subspace, exhibit stochastic behaviour through the presence of a broad frequency spectrum. Models whose stochastic microscopic behaviour leads to deterministic macroscopic dynamics are also introduced. The algorithms we overview include SVD-based methods for nonlinear problems, model reduction for linear control systems, optimal prediction techniques, asymptotics-based mode elimination, coarse timestepping methods and transfer-operator based methodologies...|$|R
40|$|With {{improvements}} in computer speed and algorithm efficiency, MD simulations are sampling larger amounts of molecular and <b>biomolecular</b> <b>conformations.</b> Being able to qualitatively and quantitatively sift these conformations into meaningful groups {{is a difficult}} and important task, especially when considering the structure-activity paradigm. Here we present a study that combines two popular techniques, principal component (PC) analysis and clustering, for revealing major conformational changes that occur in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Specifically, we explored how clustering different PC subspaces effects the resulting clusters versus clustering the complete trajectory data. As a case example, we used the trajectory data from an explicitly solvated simulation of a bacteria's L 11 center dot 23 S ribosomal subdomain, which is a target of thiopeptide antibiotics. Clustering was performed, using K-means and average-linkage algorithms, on data involving the first two to the first five PC subspace dimensions. For the average-linkage algorithm we found that data-point membership, cluster shape, and cluster size depended on the selected PC subspace data. In contrast, K-means provided very consistent results regardless of the selected subspace. Since we present results on a single model system, generalization concerning the clustering of different PC subspaces of other molecular systems is currently premature. However, {{our hope is that}} this study illustrates a) the complexities in selecting the appropriate clustering algorithm, b) the complexities in interpreting and validating their results, and c) by combining PC analysis with subsequent clustering valuable dynamic and conformational information can be obtained...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{years have}} seen the initial success of a variational implicit-solvent model (VISM), {{implemented}} with a robust level-set method, in capturing efficiently different hydration states and providing quantitatively good estimation of solvation free energies of biomolecules. The level-set minimization of the VISM solvation free-energy functional of all possible solute-solvent interfaces or dielectric boundaries predicts an equilibrium <b>biomolecular</b> <b>conformation</b> that is often close to an initial guess. In this work, we develop a theory {{in the form of}} Langevin geometrical flow to incorporate solute-solvent interfacial fluctuations into the VISM. Such fluctuations are crucial to biomolecular conformational changes and binding process. We also develop a stochastic level-set method to numerically implement such a theory. We describe the interfacial fluctuation through the "normal velocity" that is the solute-solvent interfacial force, derive the corresponding stochastic level-set equation in the sense of Stratonovich so that the surface representation is independent of the choice of implicit function, and develop numerical techniques for solving such an equation and processing the numerical data. We apply our computational method to study the dewetting transition in the system of two hydrophobic plates and a hydrophobic cavity of a synthetic host molecule cucurbit[7]uril. Numerical simulations demonstrate that our approach can describe an underlying system jumping out of a local minimum of the free-energy functional and can capture dewetting transitions of hydrophobic systems. In the case of two hydrophobic plates, we find that the wavelength of interfacial fluctuations has a strong influence to the dewetting transition. In addition, we find that the estimated energy barrier of the dewetting transition scales quadratically with the inter-plate distance, agreeing well with existing studies of molecular dynamics simulations. Our work is a first step toward the inclusion of fluctuations into the VISM and understanding the impact of interfacial fluctuations on biomolecular solvation with an implicit-solvent approach...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Accelerated {{molecular}} dynamics (aMD) simulations greatly improve {{the efficiency of}} conventional {{molecular dynamics}} (cMD) for sampling <b>biomolecular</b> <b>conformations,</b> but they require proper reweighting for free energy calculation. In this work, we systematically compare the accuracy of different reweighting algorithms including the exponential average, Maclaurin series, and cumulant expansion on three model systems: alanine dipeptide, chignolin, and Trp-cage. Exponential average reweighting can recover the original free energy profiles easily only when {{the distribution of the}} boost potential is narrow (e. g., the range ≤ 20 kBT) as found in dihedral-boost aMD simulation of alanine dipeptide. In dual-boost aMD simulations of the studied systems, exponential average generally leads to high energetic fluctuations, largely {{due to the fact that}} the Boltzmann reweighting factors are dominated by a very few high boost potential frames. In comparison, reweighting based on Maclaurin series expansion (equivalent to cumulant expansion on the first order) greatly suppresses the energetic noise but often gives incorrect energy minimum positions and significant errors at the energy barriers (∼ 2 − 3 kBT). Finally, reweighting using cumulant expansion to the second order is able to recover the most accurate free energy profiles within statistical errors of ∼kBT, particularly when the distribution of the boost potential exhibits low anharmonicity (i. e., near-Gaussian distribution), and should be of wide applicability.

40|$|Membrane {{proteins}} play {{a central}} role in virtually all biological processes, and they represent important drug targets. Unfortunately, the application of traditional high-resolution methods such as X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy to membrane proteins remains challenging. This article reviews alternative approaches that involve chemical labeling and mass spectrometry (MS) for gaining insights into membrane protein structure, function, and interactions. Hydrogen/deuterium exchange MS represents an interesting avenue for exploring <b>biomolecular</b> <b>conformations</b> and dynamics, but thus far this technique has not been widely adopted for membrane protein studies. The main focus of this article is on the use of labeling agents that introduce covalent modifications in solvent-accessible protein regions. While it is possible to monitor the occurrence of single-site modifications using traditional biochemical methods or optical spectroscopy, the use of MS greatly enhances the scope and potential of this approach because multiple tagging events can be detected in parallel. The traditional bottom-up workflow of these studies involves the digestion of a chemically labeled membrane protein by a specific protease such as trypsin. This is followed by chromatographic separation of the resulting peptides and on-line electrospray ionization MS. The application of tandem MS allows pinpointing the exact locations of chemical modifications. A particularly exciting aspect is the applicability of covalent labeling techniques to membrane protein within their natural lipid environment, or even inside living cells. Some of these concepts will be illustrated using the oxidative labeling of bacteriorhodopsin as an example, but numerous other labeling agents and protein systems are being highlighted as well. It is hoped that this review will stimulate further developments in the characterization of membrane proteins...|$|R
