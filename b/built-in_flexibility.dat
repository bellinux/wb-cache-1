Overall, the literature confirms the existence of considerable social, ethnic, gender- and age-related inequalities in secondary school track placement. Studies on tracking timing and track allocation mechanisms reveal that postponement of the selection decision and binding teacher recommendations may reduce certain (mainly social) inequalities. Furthermore, recent evidence concerning long-term consequences of tracking on labor market outcomes suggests that sizeable <b>built-in</b> <b>flexibilities</b> in the German system succeed in compensating for initial (age-related) education inequalities.

The findings have implications for companies that consider openness in their innovation activities. A large company that wishes to involve suppliers, partners, customers and end-users {{need to be prepared}} organizationally, with e. g., motivated individuals, and allocated budgets. This applies regardless company size, but, the study indicates that a smaller firm can more easily involve end-users, and can take advantage of its (<b>built-in)</b> proximity and <b>flexibility</b> towards customers.

40|$|The Galileo Near-Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (NIMS) is a {{sophisticated}} multispectral instrument which {{was developed to}} study both geological and the spatial compositional aspects of atmospheres at Jupiter. Since its original development, the communication capability of the Galileo spacecraft has been severely reduced {{as the result of}} a failure of ground controllers to open the main antenna. The data rate which will be available for all instruments at the first Jupiter encounter in 1995 has been reduced by several orders of magnitude (even after recent numerous improvements to data link efficiency.) Because of this severe limitation, real-time return of science data is now secondary. The primary means of returning Galileo science data will now be to store encounter data using the on-board tape recorder and then gradually play it back over an extended period of time. But even this time period is restricted to approximately one month since the tape recorder must be ready for additional encounters as the spacecraft orbits Jupiter. The NIMS instrument designers <b>built-in</b> extraordinary <b>flexibility</b> to adjust parameters that affect spectral resolution, spatial resolution and field of view. Each of these affects the amount of data generated. As a result of the severe communication constraints, this flexibility has become of great importance in allowing the NIMS scientists to maximize their science return value. The NIMS instrument will also incorporate adaptive lossless data compression (by factors of 2 : 1 to 3 : 1) to further improve its return capabilities. This paper describes how this is accomplished such that the flexibility to arbitrarily alter instrument parameters is not jeopardized. The paper will also discuss a solution to the problem of NIMS allocation of a fixed number of bits over a full tape load in the face of changing data characteristics and associated greatly diverse data compression factors. The approach described is a global compression rate allocation strategy, designed to achieve nearly-optimal bit usage over a complete tape load. Data history and a priori planning are the major inputs to the strategy 2 ̆ 7 s control structure. This mechanism then autonomously makes adjustments in specific parameters which affect data generation to ensure compliance with the overall bit constraint.

40|$|Riboswitches are {{widespread}} structured RNA {{elements that}} usually occur in 5 '-untranslated regions (UTRs) of bacterial mRNAs. They directly regulate the expression {{level of the}} host gene, generally {{at the level of}} translation or transcription, in response to cellular factors such as metabolites, ions, or signaling molecules. The ability of these cis-regulatory elements to sense ligand stringently and to undergo drastic conformational changes is intriguing. Here I present two of my projects dissecting two riboswitches that sense S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) and Manganese. I first present our findings on the conformational switching mechanism of the SAM-III riboswitch. Though the Ke lab has already described the SAM-binding site of this RNA [1], the mechanism by which it switches conformations back and forth between expression "on" and "off" states is not understood, and is the goal of my first project. Here we present several structural snapshots SAMfree intermediate states, including a previously unanticipated structure. Interconversion between these conformations was confirmed in solution by collaborators using single-molecule (sm) FRET. I present a model for SAM-III's conformational switching in which it takes on multiple conformations in the absence of SAM and undergoes two distinct levels of conformation selection to converge to a single conformation in the presence of SAM. These findings exemplify RNA's <b>built-in</b> conformational <b>flexibility</b> in its function. Many putative riboswitches have been identified bioinformatically, but have unknown ligands. Study of these riboswitches has been historically challenging, but offers the greatest reward. In the second project presented, I show that one such "orphan", the widespread yybP-ykoY [2], is a Mn 2 +responsive riboswitch class. This finding suggests roles for its mostly-uncharacterized regulated genes in manganese homeostasis or oxidative stress. Additionally, I present the crystal structure of a transcriptional yybP-ykoy riboswitch and describe its mechanism of discriminating Mn 2 + from other metals by both geometry and chemical "hardness". We also find that the structure of an E. coli yybPykoY riboswitch in the absence of Mn 2 + displays a destabilized Mn 2 + binding region. We further show, via the structure of a binding site mutant, that the riboswitch's metal specificity can be altered. Through these and new structures and an ongoing collaboration using single-molecule (sm) FRET, we suggest a scheme for the conformation dynamics of this riboswitch. Using the information gleaned from these structures, we are also designing fluorescent Mn 2 + sensors, based on the Spinach/Broccoli fluorophorebinding RNA platform [3]. 2021 - 05 - 3...|$|R

Emphasis is placed on determining some of the major influences {{on the extent to which}} total corporation tax revenue changes when profits change over the economic cycle. A microsimulation model, CorpSim, is constructed and used to obtain numerical results. In the model, corporations use group relief, capital allowances and losses in a tax-minimising manner. The growth of aggregate corporation tax revenue in practice in the UK appears to be highly volatile in relation to the growth of profits. High volatility in revenue elasticities is found to be especially associated with economic downturns. In mild economic downturns, corporation tax revenue elasticities may rise (because tax growth falls less than profit growth), but in more severe downturns, large but temporary decreases in revenue elasticities (and even negative elasticities) can be expected. ...|$|E
