40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the extent}} of European Union (EU) actorness and effectiveness at the fifteenth United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Conference of the Parties (COP) meeting in Copenhagen in December 2009. For over a decade the European Union has been characterised {{as a leader in}} international climate policy-making and as an important actor in international climate change negotiations. The COP 15 meeting in Copenhagen has overall brought about disappointing outcomes, especially {{from the perspective of the}} European Union. This casts doubts on EU leadership and begs the question of what has happened to EU actorness and effectiveness in this field. In terms of actorness we take Jupille and Caporaso (1998) as a point of departure and then specify a more parsimonious actorness framework that consists of cohesion and autonomy. Effectiveness (i. e. goal attainment) is seen as conceptually separate from actorness. Effectiveness is conceptualised as the result of actorness conditioned by the ‘opportunity structure’, i. e. the external context (of other actors, events and ideas) that enables or constrains EU actions. We hold that the EU’s actorness has been only moderate, especially given somewhat limited preference cohesion. In terms of the opportunity structure in Copenhagen we argue that the high degree of politicisation constrained the EU’s ability to negotiate and thus to attain its goals. Another external factor that had a substantial adverse impact on the EU’s effectiveness at the Copenhagen negotiations was the strong involvement of other actors with rather different positions, namely the United States (US) and the <b>BASIC</b> <b>countries</b> (Brazil, South Africa, India, and China) ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Reducing carbon Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD+) is {{of central}} {{importance}} to combat climate change. Foremost among the challenges is quantifying nation's carbon emissions from deforestation and degradation, which requires information on forest carbon storage. Here we estimated carbon storage in India's forest biomass {{for the years}} 2003, 2005 and 2007 and the net flux caused by deforestation and degradation, between two assessment periods i. e., Assessment Period first (ASP I), 2003 - 2005 and Assessment Period second (ASP II), 2005 - 2007. Results The total estimated carbon stock in India's forest biomass varied from 3325 to 3161 Mt during the years 2003 to 2007 respectively. There was a net flux of 372 Mt of CO 2 in ASP I and 288 Mt of CO 2 in ASP II, with an annual emission of 186 and 114 Mt of CO 2 respectively. The carbon stock in India's forest biomass decreased continuously from 2003 onwards, despite slight increase in forest cover. The rate of carbon loss from the forest biomass in ASP II has dropped by 38. 27 % compared to ASP I. Conclusion With the Copenhagen Accord, India along with other <b>BASIC</b> <b>countries</b> China, Brazil and South Africa is voluntarily going to cut emissions. India will voluntary reduce the emission intensity of its GDP by 20 - 25 % by 2020 in comparison to 2005 level, activities like REDD+ can provide a relatively cost-effective way of offsetting emissions, either by increasing the removals of greenhouse gases from the atmosphere by afforestation programmes, managing forests, or by reducing emissions through deforestation and degradation. </p...|$|E
