50|$|In 1883 in Carthage, Missouri, J.P. Leggett {{developed}} {{a new type of}} <b>bedspring</b> consisting of single cone spring wire coils, formed and interlaced, then mounted on a wood slat base. The <b>bedspring</b> could then be used as a base for the then-popular cotton, feather or horsehair mattresses. Needing expertise in manufacturing and production, he recruited his soon-to-be brother-in-law, C.B. Platt, whose father owned and operated Platt Plow Works, into the partnership. Together, they produced the components of their Leggett & Platt <b>bedspring,</b> which was patented in 1885.|$|E

50|$|Although {{available}} in various models and continuously improved upon, <b>bedsprings</b> were practically the only product Leggett & Platt offered until 1933. However, {{in that year}} the company began to manufacture springs for innerspring mattresses, which were relatively new products in the industry and growing in popularity. Thereafter, the company slowly began to diversify its products within the bedding industry by producing rollaway beds and folding metal cots, along with bed frames and bed rails.|$|R
50|$|Many {{reports have}} {{surfaced}} over the years, {{from those who}} lived near the 500 kilowatt transmitter, of power fluctuations. Residents would see their lights flicker {{in time to the}} modulation peaks of the transmitter. It was widely reported that the signal was so overpowering some people picked up WLW radio on the metal coils of mattress and boxed <b>bedsprings,</b> similar to KDKA in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Arcing often occurred near the transmission site.|$|R
50|$|The Carthage {{market for}} their new product was very limited. To expand the market to a wider region, Mr. Platt and George Leggett, brother of J. P. Leggett, would load a horse-drawn wagon with <b>bedsprings</b> and travel to {{surrounding}} communities. Often, to conserve space, they would load the springs and slats separately into the wagon and assemble them in a store or on an adjacent sidewalk. The partnership prospered, and the business was incorporated in 1901.|$|R
50|$|The LB-1 was {{a single}} engine, open cockpit, biplane with {{conventional}} landing gear. The low-cost construction included using brazed steel <b>bedspring</b> wire for wing-ribs, and bed-sheet muslin covering. The airfoil was patterned on a Taylorcraft BC-12D. The aircraft used three fuel tanks, one in the headrest, one in the baggage compartment and one against the firewall. The red and white checkerboard painted aircraft was outfitted with a smoke system for airshow work.|$|E

50|$|The new Alley Theatre became “the most modern, elastic theatre {{house in}} the world for the {{dramatic}} arts” thanks to Yale University professor George Izenour’s first-of-its-kind light grid, adjustable walls and analogue recorder. The tension wire grid, which Izenour described as similar to a <b>bedspring,</b> was made of a couple miles of aircraft cable, which formed a mesh 19 feet above the stage, allowing lighting technicians to easily walk on it before shows to adjust lighting and eliminated the need for footlights, spotlights and curtains.|$|E
50|$|The first {{rectangular}} spring-cushioned wire frames {{to support}} mattresses {{did not have}} wood rims or cloth covers. These were called <b>bedsprings.</b> More and more box-springs are being made out of wood, then covered in fabrics. Wood makes a better support system for the newer memory foam and latex mattresses. The newest design in box-springs is the folding box spring made of wood or metal, then covered in fabric which can fold in half and can be sent by shipping and courier companies.|$|R

Civic-minded and wise beyond his years, Fat Albert works hard to maintain integrity in the gang and with others, and is the lead singer as well as bagpipe-accordion (made from a funnel, radiator and an airbag) player in the Junkyard Band and on occasion, plays the <b>bedspring.</b>|$|E
50|$|In {{telecommunications}} and radar, a reflective array antenna is {{a class of}} directive antennas in which multiple driven elements are mounted {{in front of a}} flat surface designed to reflect the radio waves in a desired direction. They are a type of array antenna. They are often used in the VHF and UHF frequency bands. VHF examples are generally large and resemble a highway billboard, so they are sometimes called billboard antennas, or in Britain hoarding antennas. Other names are <b>bedspring</b> array and bowtie array {{depending on the type of}} elements making up the antenna. The curtain array is a larger version used by shortwave radio broadcasting stations.|$|E
50|$|During the exorcism, the boy {{allegedly}} slipped one of {{his hands}} out of the restraints; broke a <b>bedspring</b> from under the mattress, and used it as an impromptu weapon, slashing the priest's arm and resulting in the exorcism ritual being halted. The family traveled to St. Louis, where Roland's cousin contacted {{one of his}} professors at St. Louis University, Raymond J. Bishop, who in turn spoke to William S. Bowdern, an associate of College Church. Together, both priests visited Roland in his relatives' home, where they allegedly observed a shaking bed, flying objects, the boy speaking in a guttural voice, and exhibiting an aversion to anything sacred. Bowdern was granted permission from the archbishop to perform another exorcism.|$|E
2500|$|Serious crystal radio hobbyists use [...] "inverted L" [...] and [...] "T" [...] type antennas, {{consisting}} {{of hundreds of}} feet of wire suspended as high as possible between buildings or trees, with a feed wire attached in the center or at one end leading down to the receiver. However more often random lengths of wire dangling out windows are used. A popular practice in early days (particularly among apartment dwellers) was to use existing large metal objects, such as <b>bedsprings,</b> fire escapes, and barbed wire fences as antennas.|$|R
5000|$|Weird Harold [...] (voiced by Gerald Edwards) is a tall, skinny, beady-eyed kid who is {{the tallest}} one of the Junkyard Gang and always wears a gold dress blazer, a brown sock on one foot and a red sock on the other, and is clumsy.

The sequence depicts a montage of the butcher-landlord making love to his mistress on a noisy bed, {{while the rest of}} the building's tenants perform activities (painting ceilings, knitting, playing the cello, assembling animal calls) at an increasing pace, with the squeaks from the <b>bedsprings</b> dictating the tempo. The trailer ended with the butcher climaxing, each tenant's activity ending (rather violently) and then a sudden cut to the title logo and the 'swinging pig' emblem from the film's opening credits.|$|R
5000|$|In 1870, Zalmon G. Simmons {{opened his}} first factory in Kenosha, Wisconsin. He started out by {{manufacturing}} wooden telegraph insulators and cheese boxes. He branched into making bedsprings {{after receiving a}} patent for a woven-wire <b>bedspring</b> in payment of a debt. In 1876, Simmons became the first manufacturer to mass-produce woven wire mattresses. This process helped the company produce beds faster and cheaper, and by 1889, {{with the introduction of}} spiral coil springs into woven mattresses, Simmons’ mattress prices dropped from $12 to 95 cents, making mattresses more widely affordable. The business was incorporated in 1884 as the Northwestern Wire Mattress Company, adopting Simmons Manufacturing Company as its name in 1889. According to company records, by 1891 it was the largest company [...] "of its kind in the world".|$|E
50|$|The AN/SPS-43 was a {{long-range}} air-search United States Navy radar system introduced in March 1961 {{that had a}} range of 500+ km. This radar could provide bearing and distance information, but no altitude information. The small-ship antenna (Type SPS-29) looked like a <b>bedspring.</b> Larger ships used the 12.8 m wide SPS-37 antenna - about twice as wide and half {{the height of the}} SPS-29 antenna - and designed with a much narrower beam. Targets were much more accurately displayed when using the -37 antenna. The -43 operated at VHF frequency - somewhat unusual for any radar - mostly in the bandwidth of television channel 13. The main difference to the SPS-37 was the greatly improved ECCM performance, as the AN/SPS-43 jumped between 20 different frequencies to frustrate jamming attempts. A sea-skimmeing missile could be detected at a range distance of 30 km, a large high-flying aircraft at 500 km.|$|E
5000|$|One of {{his general}} store {{customers}} paid for merchandise with a patent for a woven wire <b>bedspring.</b> At that time, mattresses {{were made of}} cotton or horsehair. Simmons took the ideas from the patent and {{found a way to}} make the cost of manufacturing affordable. In 1870, Simmons founded what would become the Simmons Bedding Company, but the market had not yet developed for spring beds. Instead, Simmons manufactured brass beds that were sold domestically and internationally. The Northwestern Wire Mattress Company was incorporated in 1884 and in 1889 the name was changed to Simmons Manufacturing Company. In 1925, Simmons produced the Beautyrest mattress, for which the company is best known. It was sold at three to four times the cost of wire mattresses at the time for $39.50 (...) and four years later had sold more than $9 million (...) of the mattresses. The company introduced the pull-out bed, Hide-a-Bed, in 1940. By 1941, the company made springs, mattresses, steel beds and furniture and employed about 2,500 men. During World War II, it produced 2,700 different products needed to support the war effort.|$|E

Complex described it as [...] "slang expander that's sure to alter your day-to-day work conversations". About the song XXL magazine wrote, [...] "The Taylor Gang affiliate enlists Wiz Khalifa to come through on the DJ Mustard-produced “Oh Nah”—a collaborative cut void of romance and love, but rather focuses on getting straight to the point—or in this case, the sheets. While DJ Mustard subtlety guides the track {{with the sounds of}} creaking <b>bedsprings,</b> both Ty Dolla $ign and Wiz take the time to question their potential bedmates about food and weed, making sure the femme fatale can cater to their needs." ...|$|R
50|$|The company {{built its}} first factory and offices in Carthage in 1895. The {{workforce}} {{at that time}} consisted of the two partners and five employees. Soon after completion of the Carthage plant, a second factory was built in Louisville, Kentucky. During the next 50 years, three more factories were built. Demand for the company’s improved <b>bedsprings</b> was rising, and a second plant was built in Carthage in 1925. The new, much larger plant was located next to a railroad to allow for expanded shipments of products and supplies. In 1942, an additional factory was built in Winchester, Kentucky, which was subsequently consolidated with the Louisville plant. For some time, Texas had {{proven to be a}} main market outlet, and in 1947, a major factory was built in Ennis, Texas. By 1947, Leggett & Platt consisted of 4 plants and 500 employees.|$|R
5000|$|Rambo {{destroys the}} gunboat with a rocket launcher. When Rambo calls for extraction, he is denied, as Murdock fears {{what will happen}} to him and his party if the American public learn about Murdock's activities. Rambo and the captive are both captured, and back at the camp Russian advisors soon arrive to {{interrogate}} Rambo. Meanwhile, Co enters the camp under the disguise of a prostitute and comes to the hut in which Rambo is held captive. There she witnesses Rambo being tortured by Russian Colonel Podovsky, who demands that the American contact his base and confess to war crimes. After being electrically shocked on a <b>bedspring</b> and then burned on the cheek with his own knife, Rambo pretends to agree to Podovsky's condition, but instead tells Murdock on the radio that [...] "he is coming to get him", after which he promptly escapes with Co's help. They hide in the jungle and Co tends to Rambo's wounds. She then asks him if he will take her with him to the U.S., he agrees and he kisses her. But they are attacked by some Vietnamese soldiers and Co is shot and dies. Enraged and distraught by Co's death, he kills them all (except for their commander, who escapes, but is later killed by one of Rambo's exploding arrows) and then buries Co's body in the jungle so her body is not scavenged upon by animals.|$|E
40|$|Due to both {{significant}} primary loads (weight, pressure) {{and thermal}} transients, important supporting structures (<b>bedspring,</b> deck…) subjected to thermo-mechanical fatigues require that periodical inspections {{are carried out}} in nuclear power plant. The <b>bedspring</b> and the deck are complex welded structures of very restricted access; the ability to reliably detect and locate defects like cracks is therefore a difficult challenge. Ultrasonic testing is a well-recognized non-invasive technic which exhibits high characterization performances in homogeneous media (steel). However, its capabilities are hampered when operating in heterogeneous and anisotropic austenitic welds because of deviation and splitting of the ultrasonic beam. In order to rise to this important challenge, a model-based method is proposed, which takes into account a prior knowledge corresponding to the welding procedure specifications (TIG welding, sequence of passes…) that condition the austenitic grains orientation within the weld and thus the wave propagation. The topological imaging method implemented is a differential approach which, compares signals from the reference defect-free medium to the inspected medium. It relies on combinations of two computed ultrasonic fields, one forward and one adjoint. Under the Born approximation, the investigated method virtually and successfully back-focuses the ultrasound residue towards any of the perturbations (defects) in the numerical model. However, when multiple reflections occurs, the conventional topological energy method fails at localizing the defect. This paper presents a new approach for addressing multiple reflexions. Numerical simulations and experiments {{have been carried out}} to validate the practical relevance of this approach to detect, locate and characterize an emerging notch both in a steel slab (consideration of the multiple reflections) and in a weld...|$|E

During the scene in which Nina was tortured to taunt Olivia into using her powers, Brown actually injured herself on the rusty <b>bedsprings</b> used as the prop for the show. Brown referred to the alternative version of her character as [...] "Meana" [...] due to her seemingly [...] "mean" [...] personality, and speculated that Nina may have become this way because without William Bell, [...] "she wasn’t at the party with all of the boys, the science boys" [...] and thus developed an [...] "outsider" [...] perspective.

500|$|Brinkley {{used his}} new border blaster {{to resume his}} {{campaign}} for governor by using the telephone to call in his broadcasts to the transmitter. This approach did not work, and he lost yet another political campaign; he would lose again in 1934. Though Brinkley's American radio license had been revoked, XER's signal {{was so strong that}} it could still be heard in Kansas. In 1932, the Mexican government allowed Brinkley to increase his wattage to 150,000 watts. Several months later, Brinkley was allowed to increase to one million watts, [...] "making XER far and away the most powerful radio station on the planet" [...] that, on a clear night, could be heard as far away as Canada. According to accounts of the time, the signal was so strong that it turned on car headlights, made <b>bedsprings</b> hum, and caused broadcasts to bleed into telephone conversations. Local residents didn't even need a radio to hear Brinkley's station; ranchers reported that they received it through their metal fences and in their dental appliances.|$|R
50|$|Chas Rogers {{began his}} {{entry in the}} bed {{manufacturing}} business contracting cots for Public School 135 in the Borough of Manhattan in 1854, with another bedding maker named Bradford Willard, a loose association which continued until the late 1850s. Due to bed bugs and vermin during this period in the city, iron and brass beds became fashionable both for style and as they harbored no hiding places for the pests as most wood furniture did. Rogers looked to capitalize on this growing demand. His first retail location in New York City was at 384 Hudson Ave. in lower Manhattan. Chas was selling mattresses, cots, iron bed frames and wholesaling other materials while developing contacts and suppliers for his brass bed business which he began in earnest in early 1855. He began selling brass beds after becoming the sole importer of Fisher Brown & Co. of Birmingham, England {{one of the major}} European producers of sought after, finely crafted brass beds. As his bedding business increased he began selling other items such as down comforters, pillows, <b>bedsprings,</b> divans, iron bedsteads and also began making specialized yacht cushions.|$|R
