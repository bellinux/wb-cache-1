The Voidomatis is mostly seasonal, with year-round flow occurring only in {{the lower part of the}} gorge. Due to its nature, the area of the gorge is precipitous and impassable most of the year.|$|E
5|$|The south {{transept}} {{contains the}} important late Saxon stone {{panel of the}} Harrowing of Hell. It dates from before the Norman Conquest and may have <b>been</b> <b>carved</b> around 1050. Following a fire in 1831 it was found {{being used as a}} coffin lid under the Chapter House floor.|$|E
5|$|The temple {{complex is}} on a rocky ridge over which {{an array of}} {{monolithic}} (made of a single block of stone) temples have <b>been</b> <b>carved</b> which resemble the monolithic temples of Mahabalipuram, Ellora and Dhamnar caves. The central temple of this complex, called the Thakurdwara, has extensive well crafted carvings. This shrine facing east has idols of Ram, Lakshman and Sita (made of black-stone).|$|E
50|$|This statue is {{the only}} stone Buddha with a nimbus at Unjusa. The nimbus with a flame pattern <b>was</b> <b>carved</b> using a {{depressed}} engraving method on a trapezoid stone backing. The entire Buddha <b>is</b> <b>carved</b> from one solid piece of stone. The Buddha, Buddha's mudras (symbolic or ritual hand gestures), nose, eyebrows and ears <b>are</b> <b>carved</b> in relief while the nimbus <b>is</b> <b>carved</b> in depression.|$|R

5|$|As {{previously}} planned, {{most of the}} Texians {{fell back}} to the barracks and the chapel. Holes had <b>been</b> <b>carved</b> in the walls to allow the Texians to fire. Unable to reach the barracks, Texians stationed along the west wall headed west for the San Antonio River. When the cavalry charged, the Texians took cover and began firing from a ditch. Sesma was forced to send reinforcements, and the Texians were eventually killed. Sesma reported that this skirmish involved 50Texians, but Edmondson believes that number was inflated.|$|E
5|$|During the {{earthquake}} of 1905, there was large scale {{damage to the}} temple complex. Substantial part of the temples were damaged resulting in many broken parts seen lying scattered around the temple. Further, the heterogeneous structural compactness of the sandstone rock mass, from which the temples have <b>been</b> <b>carved</b> out, {{has contributed to the}} damage. A particular structural part of the temple which {{is not part of the}} main monolithic temple complex suffered severe damage to most of its circular columns which resulted in collapse of the mandapa and the roof (probably made of local timber) of the structure.|$|E
5|$|Staffa {{lies about}} 10kilometres (6mi) west of Mull, and 9km {{northeast}} of Iona. It is longitudinally oriented north-south, {{and is a}} kilometre long by about half a kilometre wide. The circumference is about 3.8km in extent. In the northeast the isle shelves to a shore, but otherwise the coast is rugged and much indented; numerous caves have <b>been</b> <b>carved</b> out by rain, streams and sea. There is enough grass to feed a few cattle, and the island has a spring.|$|E
50|$|The Usuki Stone Buddhas were {{estimated}} to <b>be</b> <b>carved</b> during the 12th century, and consist of four groups of stone Buddhas. The reason why these stone Buddhas <b>were</b> <b>carved</b> here <b>is</b> unclear.|$|R

50|$|The {{inscriptions}} {{are classified}} as being carved in the runestone style Pr3, which suggests that they <b>were</b> <b>carved</b> in the period 1050-1080. They <b>were</b> <b>carved</b> first, then U 20/21, and last Gerlög's Hillersjö stone.|$|R
5|$|The {{discovery}} of a colossal head at Tres Zapotes {{in the nineteenth century}} spurred the first archaeological investigations of Olmec culture by Matthew Stirling in 1938. Seventeen confirmed examples are known from four sites within the Olmec heartland on the Gulf Coast of Mexico. Most colossal heads were sculpted from spherical boulders but two from San Lorenzo Tenochtitlán were re-carved from massive stone thrones. An additional monument, at Takalik Abaj in Guatemala, is a throne that may have <b>been</b> <b>carved</b> from a colossal head. This is the only known example from outside the Olmec heartland.|$|E
5|$|A {{considerable}} leap {{in quality}} is evident here, {{compared to the}} Apostles {{of the church of}} Santa Maria dei Miracoli that had <b>been</b> <b>carved</b> just a few years earlier. The cycle of the Caesars is not only considerably grander in size but also a notable qualitative improvement over the previous production. The presence of these Caesars on the façade of the Loggia in Brescia is testament of an architectural and figurative leap, a full expression of classical art that has climbed from the earlier experiments at the Miracoli. Cairano, through the creation of the cycle and subsequent architectural ornamentation of the Loggia palazzo, becomes the fulcrum of commissions, both public and private, from Brescians keen to show off their descent from ancient Rome and to ride the wave of the local Renaissance.|$|E
5|$|A {{persistent}} myth of {{more recent}} origin {{is that of}} the Glastonbury Zodiac, a purported astrological zodiac of gargantuan proportions said to have <b>been</b> <b>carved</b> into the land along ancient hedgerows and trackways, in which the Tor forms part of the figure representing Aquarius. The theory was first put forward in 1927 by Katherine Maltwood, an artist with an interest in the occult, who thought the zodiac was constructed approximately 5,000 years ago. But {{the vast majority of the}} land said by Maltwood to be covered by the zodiac was under several feet of water at the proposed time of its construction, and many of the features such as field boundaries and roads are recent.|$|E

5|$|Crude glyphs {{have been}} found on a few stone objects and some {{additional}} wooden items, {{but most of these}} are thought to be fakes created for the early tourism market. Several of the 26 wooden texts are suspect due to uncertain provenance (X, Y, and Z), poor quality craftsmanship (F, K, V, W, Y, and Z), or to having <b>been</b> <b>carved</b> with a steel blade (K, V, and Y), and thus, although they may prove to be genuine, should not be trusted in initial attempts at decipherment. Z resembles many early forgeries in not being boustrophedon, but it may be a palimpsest on an authentic but now illegible text.|$|E
5|$|Deleury {{suggests}} {{that although the}} temple may have {{been built in the}} 13th century, given the Hemadpanthi style architecture, the statue of Vithoba is of an earlier style so may have <b>been</b> <b>carved</b> for an earlier, smaller shrine that existed in Pandharpur. The workmanship of the image is earlier than the style of the Yadava (1175–1318), the Anhivad Chalukya (943–1210) and even the Ajmer Chohans (685–1193) eras. Although no other existing Vishnu temple has iconography like Pandharpur's Vithoba, Deleury finds similarities between the Pandharpur image and the third-century, arms-akimbo Vishnu images at Udaygiri Caves, Madhya Pradesh but declares that they are from different schools of sculpture.|$|E
5|$|Lutyens' {{designs were}} {{complete}} by 1920 and approved in November of that year, {{but as the}} chosen site {{was part of the}} churchyard, and several graves would have to be relocated to accommodate the memorial, the war memorial committee had to seek a faculty from the Diocese of Peterborough (the diocese in whose jurisdiction Northampton falls), which delayed the installation. The Reverend Geoffrey Warden, vicar of All Saints' Church, submitted the application in 1922, supported by two church wardens and two parishioners. Construction work commenced only in 1926, six years after the completion of the designs. By July 1926, the Northampton Independent reported that the obelisks had <b>been</b> <b>carved</b> and were waiting for the flags to be painted before they could be erected.|$|E
50|$|The term in situ {{is often}} used to {{describe}} ancient sculpture that <b>was</b> <b>carved</b> in place such as the Sphinx or Petra. This distinguishes it from statues that <b>were</b> <b>carved</b> and moved like the Colossi of Memnon, which was moved in ancient times.|$|R

50|$|Although {{occasionally}} used in Roman cameos, {{the earliest}} prevalent use of shell for cameo <b>carving</b> <b>was</b> during the Renaissance, in the 15th and 16th centuries. Before that time, cameos <b>were</b> <b>carved</b> from hardstone. The Renaissance cameos are typically white on a grayish background and <b>were</b> <b>carved</b> {{from the shell}} of a mussel or cowry, the latter a tropical mollusk.|$|R
5|$|The assault at Zeebrugge a {{few miles}} away from Ostend was more {{successful}} and the blocking of the major channel did cause some consternation amongst the German forces in Bruges. The larger raiders could no longer leave the port, but smaller ships, including most submarines, were still able to traverse via Ostend. In addition, within hours a narrow channel had also <b>been</b> <b>carved</b> through Zeebrugge too, although British intelligence did not realise this for several weeks. The defeat at Ostend did not entirely dampen the exuberant British media and public reaction to Zeebrugge, but in the Admiralty and particularly in the Allied Naval and Marine Forces the failure to completely neutralise Bruges rankled.|$|E
5|$|An Early Classic tomb was {{inserted}} under the main pyramid at Zaculeu; {{it had been}} tunnelled from the volcanic ash underlying the structure. A broad stairway descended to the tomb from the main plaza. The tomb interior was painted red and the floor was scattered with the remains of more than 100 ceramic vessels. These were crushed when {{the roof of the}} tomb collapsed. Also found were the remains of 34 pyrite mirrors of a type similar to those found at Kaminaljuyu. A sizeable quantity of jade was recovered from the tomb, including beads and earplugs. Some of the jade beads had <b>been</b> <b>carved</b> to represent human and parrot faces. The tomb contained the bones of four or more individuals. The ceramic offerings included decorated tripod vessels, polychrome bowls and a polychrome cylindrical vase that had a painted band of hieroglyphs. One ceramic bowl is painted in a negative painting style that is similar to finds from Nebaj.|$|E
5|$|Easter Island has {{the richest}} {{assortment}} of petroglyphs in Polynesia. Nearly every suitable surface has <b>been</b> <b>carved,</b> including {{the stone walls}} of some houses {{and a few of}} the famous mo‘ai statues and their fallen topknots. Around one thousand sites with over four thousand glyphs have been catalogued, some in bas- or sunken-relief, and some painted red and white. Designs include a concentration of chimeric bird-man figures at Orongo, a ceremonial center of the tangata manu ("bird-man") cult; faces of the creation deity Makemake; marine animals like turtles, tuna, swordfish, sharks, whales, dolphins, crabs, and octopi (some with human faces); roosters; canoes, and over five hundred komari (vulvas). Petroglyphs are often accompanied by carved divots ("cupules") in the rock. Changing traditions are preserved in bas-relief birdmen, which were carved over simpler outline forms and in turn carved over with komari. Although the petroglyphs cannot be directly dated, some are partially obscured by pre-colonial stone buildings, suggesting they are relatively old.|$|E

5|$|The {{images of}} Uttararama follow a {{different}} style from {{the images of the}} previous Anuradhapura period, and show some significant differences. The identity of the standing image is subject to a certain amount of dispute among historians and archaeologists, some of whom argue that it depicts the monk Ananda rather than the Buddha. Each of the images have <b>been</b> <b>carved</b> in a way that uses a maximum possible area of the rock, and their heights seem to have been decided based on the height of the rock itself. Each statue appears to have had its own image house, as indicated by the remains of brick walls at the site. The Uttararama was where Parakramabahu I held a congregation of monks to purify the Buddhist priesthood, and later drew up a code of conduct for them. This code of conduct has been recorded in an inscription on the same rock face containing the images of the Buddha.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of Gedi's structures were domestic residences made of thatched-roofed mud buildings concentrated between the outer and inner walls; however, the only buildings that survived {{to the present}} were constructed using coral stones extracted from the Indian Ocean. Although several of the buildings predate the fourteenth century, coral became a more common construction material for important structures and elite residences during that time period. All of the buildings at Gedi are single-story structures. The walls and other coral structures were constructed {{in a similar manner}} using lime mortar, with most foundations no greater than one foot in depth and filled with stones. Where foundations were used, they tended to be no wider than the wall they supported. There are several examples of non-utilitarian design elements. Doorways for the buildings consist of square framed pointed archways, with tombs and mosques containing spandrels and architraves that have <b>been</b> <b>carved</b> or inlaid with porcelain.|$|E
5|$|The misericords {{date from}} 1330 to 1340. They may have <b>been</b> <b>carved</b> under the {{direction}} of master carpenter John Strode, although his name is not recorded before 1341. He was assisted by Bartholomew Quarter, who is documented from 1343. They originally numbered ninety, of which sixty-five have survived. Sixty-one are installed in the choir, three are displayed in the cathedral and one is held by the Victoria and Albert Museum. New stalls were ordered when the eastern end of the choir was extended in the early 14th century. The canons complained that they had borne the cost of the rebuilding and ordered that the prebendary clerics should pay for their own stalls. When the newly refurbished choir opened in 1339 many misericords were left unfinished, including one-fifth of the surviving 65. Many of the clerics had not paid, and were required to contribute a total sum of £200. The misericords survived better than the other sections of the stalls, which, during the Protestant Reformation, had their canopies chopped off and galleries inserted above them. One of the misericords, depicting a boy pulling a thorn from his foot, dates from the 17th century. In 1848 there was a complete rearrangement of the choir furniture, and 61 of the misericords were reused in the restructured stalls.|$|E
