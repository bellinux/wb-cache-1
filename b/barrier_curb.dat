40|$|The contaminating {{effects of}} {{economic}} activity and the scarcity of natural resources has led firms to {{a situation in which}} corporate strategy has been compromised by environmental issues. The objective {{of this paper is to}} analyse some of the factors determining the pro-environmental change process by considering the drivers encouraging firms to progress in environmental protection and the <b>barriers</b> that <b>curb</b> this progress. Using a structural equation model implemented on a sample of 303 firms, our results confirm a direct and positive effect of stakeholder pressure and of the expectations of obtaining competitive advantages from the pro-environmental change process. The results also confirmed the indirect effect of stakeholder pressure on pro-environmental change through managers’ expectations of obtaining competitive advantages, which play a mediating role in the firm’s response. Although managers interpret the barriers we have studied as obstacles to adopting environmental protection measures, they do not prevent any firm from reaching advanced levels of pro-environmental change...|$|R
40|$|Soil {{and water}} {{conservation}} practices need to be tailored to suit the diverse local conditions in smallholder farms. Using a combination of survey methods, field experimentation over several seasons and farm scale analysis, this research explored the targeting of recommended options to field and farm types. Smallholder farmers’ in Mbeere and Meru South Districts of Central Kenya acknowledged the occurrence of soil erosionin their farms and understood the water erosion process. Trash lines were common in the low potential Mbeere area for the control of erosion, except for farmers with high resource endowment who instead preferred fanya juu and vegetation barriers. In Meru South, contour farming was popular for different farmers although the preference was for vegetative barriers with multiple benefits. Three field types on a relative scale of soil fertility were identified by the farmers: good, medium and poor. Physical and vegetative measures were more common and well maintained in good fields but rare and neglected in poor fields. Farming on sloping arable fields with no vegetative barriers lead to soil degradation and establishment of vegetative <b>barriers</b> <b>curbed</b> soil erosion. Napier grass barriers were efficient in conserving soil and water but competed with crops for available water. This competition was especially strong with minimum tillage even when the Napier was intensely harvested. Leucaena barriers had a complementary water use pattern with crops across tillage practices but were less efficient for soil {{and water conservation}}. Considering economic returns and the soil conserved, leucaena barriers had attractive and less risky economic returns across tillage practices but conserved less soil. Napier barriers with regular tillage presented a win-win scenario for farmers and environmental impacts because of simultaneous attractive economic returns and efficient soil conservation. Cumulative maize grain yields in the good fields were above 15 Mg ha - 1 across cropping seasons and were not influenced by tillage and crop residue retention. The cumulative grain yields in the medium fields were above 10 Mg ha - 1 across cropping seasons and were greater with crop residue retention. In the poor fields, cumulative grain yield was less than 10 Mg ha - 1 across seasons and minimum tillage resulted in yield decrease while crop residue retention did not affect yields. For the poor fields, emphasis {{should be placed on}} the rehabilitation of soil physical and chemical attributes. At farm level, retention of crop residues was not viable due to use of crop residues for livestock feed. Minimum tillage was of interest to well-endowed farmers who had labour constraints. Poor farmers were interested but would not afford herbicides and had no access to sprayer pumps. Long term studies and farm scale modelling are necessary to unravel further the complexity in heterogeneous smallholder farming system for better fitting of recommended soil and water conservation options.   ...|$|R
40|$|The {{wheelchair}} is {{the major}} means of transport for physically disabled people. However, it cannot overcome architectural <b>barriers</b> such as <b>curbs</b> and stairs. In this paper, the authors proposed a method to avoid falling down of a wheeled inverted pendulum type robotic wheelchair for climbing stairs. The problem of this system is that the feedback gain of the wheels cannot be set high due to modeling errors and gear backlash, which results in the movement of wheels. Therefore, the wheels slide down the stairs or collide with {{the side of the}} stairs, and finally the wheelchair falls down. To avoid falling down, the authors proposed a slider control strategy based on skyhook model in order to decrease the movement of wheels, and a rotary link control strategy based on the staircase dimensions in order to avoid collision or slide down. The effectiveness of the proposed fall avoidance control strategy was validated by ODE simulations and the prototype wheelchair...|$|R
40|$|Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) Between 1890 and 1930 in {{the city}} of Indianapolis, people in charge made certain {{decisions}} regarding infrastructure—the character and condition of streets and sidewalks, the provision of sewer services and garbage collection, the location of the city’s dump, and the placement of the city’s sewage treatment plant—that resulted in long-term health and safety consequences. In Indianapolis, as in most modern American cities, some neighborhoods are less healthy for their inhabitants than others. The least healthy neighborhoods—those with the highest rates of cancer, for example—are situated on the city’s southwest side. The southwest side of Indianapolis is also the location of the landfill, the sewage treatment plant, and much heavy industry. The entire city is at the mercy of an ill-designed sewer system, a system that taxpayers are spending millions annually to repair. The years from 1890 to 1930 saw the genesis of this state of affairs. 	In the city of Indianapolis since 1890, infrastructure has separated people from nature and from each other on two levels: its operational level, wherein it was an objective entity that performed according to its design, and its subjective level, where it operated as a social and hygienic <b>barrier.</b> Streets, <b>curbs,</b> sewers, and sidewalks are useful and necessary elements of public health and safety. We both want and need these elements to ensure our separation from things that are dangerous, such as speeding cars and contaminated water. When government officials exercise power to declare what parts of the city street are accessible to whom, or which neighborhoods will have a wastewater treatment plant, a landfill, or heavy industry nearby, infrastructure can work to separate people...|$|R
40|$|Agricultural {{development}} {{models are}} the focus of intense debate in the Cambodian policy-making arenas. A model inspired by the ‘Green Revolution’, which promotes industrialization of rice cropping systems and is mainly dependent on external inputs, is usually contrasted with multi-purpose farming (MPF) in which rice cropping is integrated with other production to maximize their interactions and complementarities. The purpose of this research is to present some economic arguments based on the experience in promoting MPF of CEDAC (Centre d’Etude et de Dévelopement Agricole Cambodgien, also known as the Cambodian Center for Study and Development in Agriculture). We develop a comparative analysis between conventional rice cropping systems and MPF to analyze the production economics and the overall patterns of household labor diversification. Focusing primarily on rainy-season rice production, we attribute significant advantage to MPF against non-MPF practices. These differences are perceptible in higher rice yield, lower cash-paid costs, and higher value-added per hectare. However, these differences become less significant when multi-purpose farming is only partially implemented, i. e. if some elements of the system are missing. MPF provides employment opportunities that represent a reliable alternative to job migration. Under MPF, family labor is used more on-farm than is the case with non- MPF farms and is more homogenously distributed throughout the year. However, we identify <b>barriers</b> that <b>curb</b> the scaling-up of this innovation, which include limited access to information, anticipated lack of labor, lack of capacity or technical skills, lack of up-front capital to make the initial investment in land conversion to MPF, and land plot sizes that are too small to be converted to this model. We also discuss the opportunities to create markets for products of differentiated quality produced under multi-purpose farming. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Earlier {{there were}} occupations based on caste {{and as such}} society was based on Chaturvarna. But, due to {{globalization}} and liberalization, {{many of the new}} occupations and professions were generated. Now, education is the base for career and occupational choices of the students. Many of the thinkers still believe that choice of occupations is {{made on the basis of}} caste of the students. Hence, a questionnaire based survey was conducted and 150 students studying in degree courses in different degree colleges were surveyed. It is found that caste or gender are no more influencing occupational choice of degree college students. Further, even though there are reservations and incentives to curb the social inequalities based on caste and gender, still there is discrimination in the education. It is suggested to the parents to give freedom to their children to choose their career and future. Further, it is suggested to <b>curb</b> <b>barriers</b> such as gender stratification and caste based stratification in education. It is concluded that the students, parents and the society should realize that now the education is not based on caste or gender and to increase knowledge and intelligence of the students...|$|R

Therefore, it will explore and find ways and means of how the South African government can reach out to rural communities with inadequate English proficiency, in an English-dominated South Africa, by breaking down the existing language <b>barriers</b> and <b>curbing</b> social inequalities. Language rights, like any other human rights, should be protected, as enshrined in the new democratic Constitution of South Africa. The dissemination of most information in South Africa is through English. This poses a serious problem, since information that is written in English is only accessible to people that are proficient in this language. Lo Bianco (1996) asserts that people acquire knowledge more effectively if the knowledge is presented to them in a language that they know. According to Ngcobo (2009 : 116), studies have focused on recommendations on how South Africa can address the challenge of providing information to South Africans. This thesis seeks to unpack what is actually happening in particular rural areas regarding this challenge. Ngcobo further emphasises that the issue is not only provision of information, but also access to the information. He further points out that information may relate to overall policies, procedures, what services are provided for whom, how to access these services, who to contact for urgent help or when things go wrong, and various other matters that may be of interest to members of the public. South Africa is a multilingual country, and Lo Bianco (1996) maintains that servicing a multilingual population through one language is inefficient, ineffective, and sometimes dangerous. Robinson (1992 : 29) asserts that a language belongs to a speech community, both as a means of communication and as an identifying feature. Both these concepts (communication and identity) are central to intervention, particularly where participation of the people is promoted. This thesis argues that language is also an essential element of any strategy of communication. This thesis suggests that a language may be marginalised from the process of communication for purposes of development by those in authority, and this lack of concern with language may indicate and accompany marginalisation of the people from the process of development itself. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{practice}} of one health approaches in {{human and animal}} health programmes is influenced by type and scope of bridges and barriers for partnerships. It was thus essential to evaluate the nature and scope of collaborative arrangements among human, animal, and wildlife health experts in dealing with health challenges which demand inter-sectoral partnership. The nature of collaborative arrangement was assessed, and the respective bridges and barriers {{over a period of}} 12 months (July 20011 to June 2012) were identified. The specific objectives were to: (1) determine the proportion of health experts who had collaborated with other experts of disciplines different from theirs, (2) r ank the general bridges for and barriers against collaboration according to the views of the health experts, and (3) f ind the actual bridges for and barriers against collaboration among the health experts interviewed. It was found that 27. 0 % of animal health officers interviewed had collaborated with medical officers while 12. 4 % of the medical officers interviewed had collaborated with animal health experts. Only 6. 7 % of the wildlife officers had collaborated with animal health experts. The main bridges for collaboration were instruction by upper level leaders, zoonotic diseases of serious impacts, and availability of funding. The main barriers for collaboration were lack of knowledge about animal/human health issues, lack of networks for collaboration, and lack of plans to collaborate. This thus calls for the need to <b>curb</b> <b>barriers</b> in order to enhance inter-sectoral collaboration for more effective management of risks attributable to infectious diseases of humans and animals. </p...|$|R
