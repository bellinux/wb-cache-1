5|$|After Lieder, {{the first}} person to {{propagate}} her Planet X idea was Mark Hazlewood, {{a former member of the}} ZetaTalk community, who in 2001 published a book titled Blindsided: Planet X Passes in 2003. Lieder would later accuse him of being a confidence trickster. A Japanese cult called the Pana Wave Laboratory, which <b>blocked</b> <b>off</b> roads and rivers with white cloths to protect itself from electromagnetic attacks, also warned that the world would end in May 2003 after the approach of a tenth planet.|$|E
5|$|In Guadeloupe, {{damage from}} the storm was limited; potent gusts uprooted {{numerous}} trees and blew debris onto streets throughout Basse-Terre. One road was <b>blocked</b> <b>off</b> to traffic during its passage as a precautionary measure, but was reopened soon thereafter. Gale-force winds downed some electricity lines in Saint Kitts and Nevis, causing two island-wide outages. The storm enhanced moisture to produce intermittent torrents over the Virgin Islands, with localized totals {{of no more than}} 1inch (25mm). Winds in the area were also limited; the highest gust was experienced on Buck Island, measuring 52mph (83km/h).|$|E
5|$|On September 29, 2006, Monsoor's platoon engaged four {{insurgents in}} a firefight, killing one and {{injuring}} another. Anticipating further attacks, Monsoor, three SEAL snipers and three Iraqi Army soldiers {{took up a}} rooftop position. Civilians aiding the insurgents <b>blocked</b> <b>off</b> the streets, and a nearby mosque broadcast a message for people {{to fight against the}} Americans and the Iraqi soldiers. Monsoor was protecting other SEALs, two of whom were 15 feet away from him. Monsoor's position made him the only SEAL on the rooftop with quick access to an escape route.|$|E

5|$|The hunt of {{the pilot}} whale is known by the locals as the Grindadráp. There are no fixed hunting seasons. As soon as a pod close enough to land is spotted, the locals set out to begin the hunt, after {{approval}} from the sysselman. The animals are driven into a bay which is approved for whaling by the Faroese government, and then {{they try to make}} the whales to beach themselves. The only way out is being <b>blocked</b> <b>off</b> by some of the boats, which stay there until men who have been waiting on shore have slaughtered all the whales.|$|E
5|$|The {{state funeral}} {{marked the first}} time that Washington had hosted a major event since the September 11 attacks. As a result, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) {{designated}} the state funeral a National Special Security Event (NSSE). Special precautions were taken because many of the events were open to the public and there were multiple protectees. As means of assisting the motorcade, many streets were temporarily <b>blocked</b> <b>off</b> by law enforcement.|$|E
5|$|Conker's Bad Fur Day is an action-platform {{game where}} the player {{controls}} Conker the Squirrel {{through a series}} of three-dimensional levels. The game features an overworld where players can transition from one level to another, although many are initially <b>blocked</b> <b>off</b> until Conker earns a certain amount of cash. Each level is an enclosed area in which the player can freely explore to find tasks to do. The gameplay mostly relies on figuring out a way to help other characters by completing a linear sequence of challenges. These challenges may include defeating a boss, solving puzzles, gathering objects, and racing opponents, among others. The result is always a cash reward, which aids access to other areas in the overworld.|$|E

50|$|In March 2008 Barahona and Ventura {{imagined}} {{an entire}} city block in which every residence would go solar. The collective buying power of this relatively larger group of solar consumers {{would allow them to}} negotiate better pricing from installers. The goal of taking one city <b>block</b> <b>off</b> the grid led to their new venture’s name, One <b>Block</b> <b>Off</b> the Grid, soon shortened to the acronym 1BOG.|$|R
5|$|In {{the weeks}} leading up to the event, the Société de Transport de la Communauté Urbaine De Montréal (STCUM) {{announced}} that they would held strikes over pension fund contributions during the Grand Prix weekend. STCUM chose those dates due to the event's high-profile status as public transport was classified as an essential service over the weekend. It would also result in the road leading to the circuit being <b>blocked</b> <b>off</b> to spectators. STCUM appeared before Essential Services Council on 9 June to discuss producing a contingency plan to ensure spectators would attend the Grand Prix with full services running. An agreement was reached on 13 June with 60% of transport workers voting in favour of improved pay and pension, allowing the race to go unaffected.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{completion}} of the project's first phase, the vicinity around the Wazir Khan mosque had been encroached upon by illegally erected shops which <b>blocked</b> <b>off</b> much of the mosque from the surrounding neighborhood. Tangled power lines further spoiled views of the mosque, and the Wazir Khan Chowk had been badly neglected and had shrunk in size due to illegally constructed shops. The {{first phase of the}} project removed illegally constructed shops, restoring views of the mosque. Wazir Khan Chowk was extensively rehabilitated by removal of encroachments, while the well of Dina Nath was restored. Power lines along the project corridor were also placed underground, and the Chitta Gate at the eastern entrance to Wazir Khan Chowk was rehabilitated.|$|E
5|$|The 51st Transport Regiment had {{constructed}} an airstrip on Lorengau and commenced another, known as Momote Airstrip, at the Momote Plantation on Los Negros. Lorengau {{was used as}} a staging point for aircraft moving between Rabaul and airstrips in North East New Guinea. The importance of the Admiralty Islands to the Japanese increased as the result of Allied advances in New Guinea and New Britain which <b>blocked</b> <b>off</b> other air routes. By February, both airstrips were unserviceable and the antiaircraft guns were silent in order to conserve ammunition and conceal their positions. Ezaki had ordered his men to neither move nor fire in daylight.|$|E

5|$|The heavy {{rainfall}} in Tokushima caused landslides and blocked roads, resulting in disruptions to bus and train service. Strong winds overturned a truck, injuring the two occupants. In Muroto, several {{people were injured}} by flying glass. Rough waves killed {{two people in the}} same city, one in Fukuoka, damaged the seawall in Kyoto, and damaged 25ships. In Takamatsu, Kagawa, Etau left about ¥1.2billion (JPY, $10million USD) in crop damage, mainly due to damaged greenhouses. Two workers were killed in Higashiuwa after being swept away by a river. On Hokkaido, {{heavy rainfall}} caused landslides, damaging hundreds of roads and bridges and isolating several villages. River flooding swept away a vehicle in Kamishihoro, killing the five occupants. Along Mount Poroshiri, 29people were rescued by helicopter from a mountain lodge after Etau <b>blocked</b> <b>off</b> their descending trail.|$|E
5|$|Transport {{suffered}} severely: several main roads, including {{part of the}} Trans-Canada Highway and Nova Scotia Highway 102, {{in northeastern}} Nova Scotia received flood damage and were temporarily <b>blocked</b> <b>off.</b> Additionally, the rising waters washed out several bridges {{in the region and}} swept away automobiles. Railways were covered by water, forcing trains to suspend their operation. Drinking water in Dartmouth was contaminated due to excessive runoff into Lake Antigonish, and a trailer park in Antigonish flooded, prompting 600 residents to evacuate. Overall monetary damage from Beth is estimated at between $3.5 million and $5.1 million USD. One person was indirectly killed by the hurricane in a traffic accident induced by heavy rain.|$|E
5|$|Tropic Thunder held {{an early}} {{screening}} at the 2008 San Diego Comic-Con, {{two weeks before}} it officially premiered on August 11, 2008, at the Mann Village Theatre in Westwood, California and two days before its wide release. Members of several disability groups picketed before the premiere, protesting at the portrayal of mental retardation shown in the film. The groups revealed {{that it was the}} first time that they had ever protested together at an event. As a result of the protest, the normally unobstructed views of the red carpet leading to the premiere were <b>blocked</b> <b>off</b> by 10-foot (3-m)-high fences and there was an increase in the number of security personnel present. No protests were held at the United Kingdom's September premiere.|$|E

5|$|Damage {{assessments}} in the Philippines began on October31, with aerial surveys being utilized for isolated areas. With numerous roads <b>blocked</b> <b>off</b> or washed away, clearing operations were a priority. The Philippine Red Cross {{assisted in the}} immediate aftermath of Typhoon Cimaron, evacuating people in La Union and providing relief goods to more than 16,000people in Aurora. The majority of relief work was handled by local governments, though some assistance from the National Disaster Coordinating Council was received. By November1, the estimated cost of humanitarian assistance reached 3.2million PHP (US$81,000). Teams from the Red Cross were already deployed in the Philippines due to Typhoon Xangsane in September and were able to quickly respond in Cimaron's aftermath. Relief efforts for Cimaron were cut short as just two weeks later, Typhoon Chebi struck nearly the same areas. A weaker, though still powerful typhoon, damage from Chebi was relatively limited.|$|E
5|$|In the 1980s, {{the city}} and Amtrak {{attempted}} to fund a second renovation with a private partner, but plans fell through. In 1991, Amtrak constructed a rectangular concrete and glass station building {{on the north side}} of the tracks, in front of the passenger tunnel. Access from the south was <b>blocked</b> <b>off.</b> In 1999, the original station building was renovated at a cost of $7 million for use as commercial space. The front parking lot was expanded on a slope to the west; it covered much of the ground level (similar to the station before 1915). The mechanical building and the covered ramp to the trolley station were removed. A strip mall was built just to the east, with balustrades and archways referencing the historic station. The passageway from the subway station, long closed, was likely buried at this time. The 1901-built station building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on July 8, 1999.|$|E
5|$|Players {{assume the}} role of Rivel, an immortal summoner who ventures through the enchanted Aldemona Wood. He has been tasked to track down the rebel group Temperance, led by Quraist Kingsley, who have assassinated a member of the royal family. The forest at times magically seals itself, {{trapping}} visitors inside, and is rumored to hold a source of mystical power for which Quraist is searching. The game consists of twelve stages, which are large branching maps that allow the player to move from points represented by stars to adjacent points. Each stage contains its own objectives, from defeating beasts that block the player’s way, to solving puzzles before time runs out. Additional stages are available for purchase as downloadable content. There are multiple optional objectives per stage, in addition to a main goal. Many areas of each stage are initially <b>blocked</b> <b>off,</b> and can only be entered by replaying the stage later in the game.|$|E

5|$|The {{new show}} {{transformed}} Iron Dragon midway {{into a new}} area called Celebration Plaza. The area features curved edges. A new entrance and queueing area was built for Iron Dragon because the new stage occupies the old queue and entrance area. The control booths used for American Portrait were relocated {{to the side of}} the midway. On May 2, 2012 it was announced that WildCat would be removed before opening day to expand Celebration Plaza and bleachers were added in its spot. A new concession area with patio seating was built on the left side of the control booth. During the show, a portion of the patio is <b>blocked</b> <b>off</b> as a V.I.P. seating area known as the Pepsi Fan Zone. In addition, a beer garden was added behind the control booth, to the left of the bleachers.|$|E
5|$|Heavy rains from Auring {{triggered}} flooding {{across the}} eastern provinces of the Philippines. A total of 38,764 people were evacuated to avoid floodwaters. The rains caused the Cagayan River to swell, {{leading to the}} death of a 12-year-old boy in Gingoog City. In Talisay City, Cebu, a 27-year-old woman was killed after she was electrocuted by a steel wire which was knocked down by high winds produced by Auring. Nine other people, all of whom are children, were listed as missing. About 12,211 people were left stranded at ports due to dangerous conditions caused by the depression. An additional 14 trucks, 44 light cars, 75 passenger buses, 27 vessels and 295 rolling cargoes were also stranded. Severe flooding destroyed 305 homes, 199 of which were in Macasandig. Another 610 homes sustained damage. An estimated 53hectares (130.9acres) of rice and 3.5hectares (8.6acres) of corn were damaged. About 43,851 people were affected by the storm, mainly along the Cagayan River. The remnants of Auring brought heavy rains to the flooded areas again on January7, triggering several landslides which <b>blocked</b> <b>off</b> roads and damaging power lines, leaving parts of the Catanduanes without power for several hours. Damages from the depression were estimated at PHP23million ($498,318USD) and an estimated 5,000 families were left homeless.|$|E
5|$|In {{trying to}} find a way to escape before the dome rises, Ryouta and Sakuya uncover records in the library {{mentioning}} a medical center that was shut down due to a fire, and that the ghostly Nageki, who Ryouta previously encountered, died in that fire. Sakuya deduces that an unused building on campus was the medical center and after investigating, they find its basement <b>blocked</b> <b>off.</b> They also encounter Anghel, who recalls the protagonist going into the infirmary the day before, contradicting Yuuya and Shuu's shared alibi. As Ryouta searches the infirmary for clues, he finds medical records for himself, the protagonist, Nageki, and Sakuya, but is knocked out immediately after. When he regains consciousness, he discovers the protagonist's bloody student ID—now with concrete evidence, Ryouta prepares to confront the doctor and Yuuya, only to find that Sakuya had left to do so alone. Ryouta returns to the infirmary as Yuuya shields Sakuya from Shuu's attempts to kill him; the doctor tells Ryouta that he will be waiting for him in the medical center's basement before escaping with Labor 9. Yuuya apologizes, affirming that while neither he nor Shuu killed the protagonist, they were the ones who dismembered her, and asks to speak to Sakuya alone. He reveals that they are full-blooded siblings, with Shuu using knowledge of Sakuya's true heritage to blackmail Yuuya into assisting him. Yuuya dies, Shuu's scalpel having been laced with the same neurotoxin that killed the headmaster, leaving Sakuya in a state of shock.|$|E
