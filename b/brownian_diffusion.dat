40|$|Abstract — The Ito {{calculus}} {{shows that}} noise benefits {{can occur in}} common models of continuous neurons and in ran-dom spiking neurons cast as stochastic differential equations. Additive Gaussian noise perturbs the neural dynamical systems as additive <b>Brownian</b> <b>diffusions.</b> The first of two theorems uses a global Lipschitz continuity condition to characterize a stochastic resonance (SR) noise benefit in models of continuous neurons that receive random subthreshold inputs. <b>Brownian</b> <b>diffusions</b> produce an SR noise benefit {{in the sense that}} they increase the neuron’s mutual information or bit count if the noise mean falls within an interval that depends on model parameters. The second theorem extends an earlier SR result for the random spiking FitzHugh-Nagumo neuron model by replacing a firing-rate approximation with exact stochastic dynamics. This gives an interval-based sufficient condition for an SR noise benefit. I.

50|$|The {{deposition}} of particulate pollutants into the lungs is necessary before the particles can {{travel through the}} mucus into the lung tissue. There are four mechanisms of deposition: interception, impaction, gravitational settling, and <b>Brownian</b> <b>diffusion.</b> Interception happens when a particle is removed after brushing up against an obstacle. Impaction happens when the particle collides into {{the surface of the}} respiratory tract due to the high inertia. Gravitational settling is influenced by the force of gravity which causes the particle to settle on the respiratory tract. Brownian motion causes the random collision of gas molecules against the particle, until the particle goes into the respiratory tract.|$|E
5000|$|In aerosol physics, {{deposition}} is {{the process}} by which aerosol particles collect or deposit themselves on solid surfaces, decreasing the concentration of the particles in the air. It can be divided into two sub-processes: dry and wet deposition. The rate of deposition, or the deposition velocity, is slowest for particles of an intermediate size. Mechanisms for deposition are most effective for either very small or very large particles. Very large particles will settle out quickly through sedimentation (settling) or impaction processes, while <b>Brownian</b> <b>diffusion</b> has the greatest influence on small particles. [...] This is because very small particles coagulate in few hours until they achieve a diameter of 0.3 micrometres. At this size they no longer coagulate.

In fact, there are some reasons that induce a slip velocity between the nanoparticles and the base fluid. Movements of nanoparticles has significant impact on rheological and thermophysical properties of the nanofluids. Therefore, investigating the nanoparticles motion is critical for evaluating the performance of nanoparticles inclusion to the base fluid as a heat transfer medium. Since the nanoparticles are very small ( [...] 100 nm), Brownian and thermophoretic diffusivities are the main slip mechanisms in nanofluids, as Buongiorno [...] declared. <b>Brownian</b> <b>diffusion</b> is due to random drifting of suspended nanoparticles in the base fluid which originates from continuous collisions among the nanoparticles and liquid molecules. Thermophoresis induces nanoparticle migration from warmer to colder region (in opposite direction of the temperature gradient), making a non-uniform nanoparticle volume fraction distribution.|$|E
