5|$|A {{thin layer}} of horn is glued onto {{what will be the}} <b>belly</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bow, the side facing the archer. Water buffalo horn is very suitable, as is horn of several antelopes such as gemsbok, oryx, ibex, and that of Hungarian grey cattle. Goat and sheep horn can also be used. Most forms of cow horn are not suitable, as they soon {{delaminate}} with use. The horn can store more energy than wood in compression.|$|E
5|$|ARCHER is {{a daytime}} {{non-invasive}} technology, which works by analyzing an object’s reflected light. It cannot detect objects at night, underwater, under dense cover, underground, under snow or inside buildings. The system uses a special camera facing down through a quartz glass portal in the <b>belly</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> aircraft, which is typically flown at a standard mission altitude of 2500feet (800meters) and 100 knots (50meters/second) ground speed.|$|E
5|$|Other less {{satisfactory}} materials than horn {{have been}} used for the <b>belly</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bow (the part facing the archer when shooting), including bone, antler, or compression-resistant woods such as osage orange, hornbeam, or yew. Materials that are strong under tension, such as silk, or tough wood, like hickory, {{have been used}} {{on the back of the}} bow (the part facing away from the archer when shooting).|$|E
40|$|Abstract <b>The</b> effects <b>of</b> immunocastration and {{ractopamine}} in {{the diet}} on the belly quality were investigated from two crossbred pigs under different conditions of production, diet, management, and slaughter arranged in factorial design using two levels of addition <b>of</b> ractopamine in <b>the</b> diet, 0 and 7. 5 ppm, and three genders (gilts, immunocastrated and barrows). <b>The</b> quality <b>of</b> <b>bellies</b> were analyzed for chemical composition, pH, meat and fat color, backfat thickness and fatty acid profile <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fat. <b>The</b> addition <b>of</b> ractopamine showed no significant influence on pH, color and chemical composition in two crossbred pigs. The immunocastrated had thicker belly backfat compared to <b>the</b> <b>bellies</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gilts. <b>The</b> contents <b>of</b> fatty acids polyunsaturated, linoleic, linoleic, arachidonic, total omega 3 and omega 6 were higher for immunocastrated pigs, as well as presenting values greater than 0. 4 for the PUFA:SFA ratio, thus, providing bellies with better nutritional quality. <b>The</b> <b>bellies</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gilts and immunocastrated pigs had higher concentrations of iodine value, indicative of higher unsaturated fat content. The results indicated that <b>the</b> addition <b>of</b> ractopamine and immunocastration had little influence on <b>the</b> quality <b>of</b> <b>bellies</b> {{as well as in}} their fatty acid profiles, suggesting <b>the</b> continuity <b>of</b> implementation of these techniques...|$|R
30|$|Ten cadaveric lower limbs were dissected. All muscle <b>bellies</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{extensor}} apparatus <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{knee joint}} {{were identified and}} traced distally until they merged into the quadriceps tendon. Connections between the different aponeurotic layers of each muscle were studied from origin to insertion. <b>The</b> fusing points <b>of</b> each layer were marked.

5|$|The B-52C's fuel {{capacity}} (and range) was increased to 41,700USgallons by adding larger 3000USgallon underwing fuel tanks. The gross weight was increased by 30,000pounds (13,605kg) to 450,000pounds. A new fire control system, the MD-9, was introduced on this model. The <b>belly</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> aircraft was painted with antiflash white paint, which {{was intended to}} reflect thermal radiation away after a nuclear detonation.|$|E
5|$|The {{equatorial}} ring {{goes around}} the <b>belly</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> armillary sphere 91 and 5/19 (degrees) away from the pole. The circle of the ecliptic also goes round the <b>belly</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> instrument at an angle of 24 (degrees) with the equator. Thus at the summer solstice the ecliptic is 67 (degrees) and a fraction away from the pole, while at the winter solstice it is 115 (degrees) and a fraction away. Hence (the points) where the ecliptic and the equator intersect should give the north polar distances of the spring and autumn equinoxes. But now (it has been recorded that) the spring equinox is 90 and 1/4 (degrees) away from the pole, and the autumn equinox is 92 and 1/4 (degrees) away. The former figure is adopted only because it agrees with the (results obtained by the) method of measuring solstitial sun shadows as embodied in the Xia (dynasty) calendar.|$|E

5|$|When two {{distinct}} types of organisms breed with each other, the resulting hybrids typically have intermediate traits (e.g., one plant parent has red flowers, {{the other has}} white, and the hybrid, pink flowers). Commonly, hybrids also combine traits seen only separately in one parent or the other (e.g., a bird hybrid might combine the yellow head of one parent with the orange <b>belly</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> other).|$|E
5|$|The Boat Captain– A humorous addition, the Boat Captain {{encountered}} Kratos {{on several}} occasions, although these were always to the Boat Captain's detriment. In God of War, Kratos ignored him {{when in the}} <b>belly</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Hydra and brushed him aside in the Underworld. In God of War II, the Boat Captain fled from Kratos as a spirit even though summoned to fight him, and in God of War III, he left a note of hatred towards Kratos in the Underworld and his voice was heard in Kratos' psyche. The character was voiced by Keith Ferguson in God of War and God of War II, and Josh Keaton in God of War III during the psyche sequence.|$|E
5|$|In 1996, the {{military}} rulers in Burma undertook renovation {{work on the}} Mahamuni Pagoda. During this period, the Mahamuni Buddha image was damaged in 1997 when a hole appeared in the <b>belly</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Great Image. It was believed that thieves had drilled the hole {{in an attempt to}} steal jewels believed to be secreted within the image. It was reported that a military officer had requested to open the temple in the night, resulting in a meeting of all the senior monks from major monasteries in the area to discuss the matter. Whilst the meeting was in progress, attention was diverted to a purported rape incident committed by a Muslim man on a Buddhist girl. A major riot broke out but it turned out afterward that the Buddhist girl had not been raped at all. It was a coverup to divert attention away from the Buddha so it could be repaired. However, the mystery remains as to whether any jewellery did exist and was actually removed from the Great Image at all.|$|E

5|$|During the 1980s these battleships {{made use}} of the RQ-2 Pioneer, an {{unmanned}} aerial vehicle employed in spotting for the guns. Launched from the fantail using a rocket-assist booster that was discarded shortly after takeoff, the Pioneer carried a video camera in a pod under the <b>belly</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> aircraft which transmitted live video to the ship so operators could observe enemy actions or fall of shot during naval gunnery. To land the UAV a large net was deployed {{at the back of}} the ship; the aircraft was flown into it. Missouri and Wisconsin both used the Pioneer UAVs successfully during Operation Desert Storm, and in one particularly memorable incident, a Pioneer UAV operated by Wisconsin received the surrender of Iraqi troops during combat operations. This particular Pioneer was later donated to the Smithsonian Institution, and is now on public display. During Operation Desert Storm these Pioneers were operated by detachments of VC-6. In addition to the Pioneer UAVs, the recommissioned Iowas could support six types of helicopters: the Sikorsky HO3S-1, UH-1 Iroquois, SH-2 Seasprites, CH-46 Sea Knight, CH-53 Sea Stallion and the LAMPS III SH-60B Seahawk.|$|E
25|$|The sensory {{function}} of the trigeminal nerve is to provide tactile, proprioceptive, and nociceptive afference to the face and mouth. Its motor function activates the muscles of mastication, the tensor tympani, tensor veli palatini, mylohyoid and the anterior <b>belly</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> digastric.|$|E
25|$|The mylohyoid {{muscle is}} flat and triangular, and is {{situated}} immediately {{superior to the}} anterior <b>belly</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> digastric muscle. It is a pharyngeal muscle (derived from the first pharyngeal arch) and classified {{as one of the}} suprahyoid muscles. Together, the paired mylohyoid muscles form a muscular floor for the oral cavity of the mouth.|$|E

40|$|Electromyographic {{activity}} was synchronously recorded by surface and intramuscular electrodes {{in the same}} muscle. <b>The</b> activity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> left masseter, left temporalis, and both <b>bellies</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> anterior digastric muscle was studied by this double registration technique. In rest position no electromyographic activity could be detected in any <b>of</b> <b>the</b> muscles by both techniques. Both techniques give comparable results in cyclic jaw movements. In isometric contractions, however, differences in the registrated activity were observed between the surface electrode on the depressor group muscles and the intramuscularly recorded anterior digastric muscles. Silent periods evoked in the elevator muscles were of slightly longer duration when recorded by intramuscular electrodes than when recorded by surface electrodes.

40|$|<b>The</b> {{seasonal}} prevalence <b>of</b> Rhipicephalus sanguineus and Ctenocephalides spp. on kennelled dogs in Pretoria North {{was determined}} by <b>the</b> regular examination <b>of</b> 3, initially, and later 2 dogs from March 1975 -January 1977. Once the ticks had become established in the kennel peak burdens of immature ticks (larvae plus nymphae) were present on the dogs during early summer 1975 and from midsummer-late summer 1976 and early midsummer 1976 / 77. Peak numbers of adult ticks were present in midsummer 1975 / 76, from late summer-autumn and during early spring 1976 and during midsummer 1976 / 77. Few adults and even fewer immature ticks were present on the dogs during winter 1976 and the infestation overwintered in the pens as engorged nymphae. The flea population took 10 months to become well established. Thereafter, the periods late summer-autumn 1976 and early midsummer 1976 / 77 (when the survey stopped) were the most favourable and winter-spring 1976 the least favourable for adult fleas.
