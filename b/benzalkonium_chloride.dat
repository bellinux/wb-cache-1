40|$|Quaternary {{ammonium}} compounds (QACs) are ubiquitous contaminants found {{worldwide in}} both engineered and natural systems. QACs are toxic to aquatic organisms and cause co-selection for antibiotic resistance, thus providing {{a reservoir of}} antibiotic-resistant bacteria, as well as antibiotic resistance genes in QAC-polluted environments. The objectives of the research presented here were to: a) systematically assess the fate and toxicity of QACs using quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR); b) evaluate the biotransformation potential of QACs under aerobic, anoxic and anaerobic conditions; and c) assess the potential toxicity of QACs biotransformation products. Nine QACs, belonging to three homologous groups [...] monoalkonium, dialkonium and <b>benzalkonium</b> <b>chlorides</b> [...] were the target QACs. The QACs critical micelle concentration (CMC) was determined. Then, the CMC {{was used as a}} descriptor to derive relationships between QAC structure and partitioning to biosolids as well as acute MicrotoxÂ® toxicity. QACs with low CMCs had a relatively high adsorption affinity for biosolids and a lower toxicity than QACs with higher CMCs, which suggests that QACs that are more mobile and more (bio) available are more toxic. The biotransformation potential of <b>benzalkonium</b> <b>chlorides</b> (BAC) [...] the most commonly used QACs found in engineered and natural biological systems [...] under aerobic, methanogenic, nitrate reducing, and fermentative conditions was evaluated using bioenergetics and batch bioassays. The aerobic BAC biotransformation involved sequential dealkylation and debenzylation steps resulting in the formation of benzyl dimethyl amine, and dimethyl amine, respectively. The bacterial community involved in the aerobic BAC degradation was mainly composed of species belonging to the Pseudomonas genus. All QACs tested were recalcitrant under methanogenic conditions and inhibited methanogenesis at and above 25 mg QAC/L. Under nitrate reducing and fermentative conditions, BAC was transformed to alkyldimethyl amines via an abiotic reaction known as modified Hofmann degradation and a biotic reaction known as fumarate addition, respectively. Both reactions are based on a mechanism known as nucleophilic substitution. The discovery of BAC transformation by the above mentioned two reactions is the first ever report to document QAC transformation under anoxic/anaerobic conditions and delineate the transformation pathway.

40|$|Two {{models for}} the {{prediction}} of corrosion inhibition efficiency of various pure surfactant and mixed surfactants in salt-containing solution are developed, compared, and validated. The two prediction models {{are based on a}} modified Langmuir adsorption (MLA) sub-model and a modified Quantitative Structure Activity Relation (MQSAR) sub-model. Each of the sub-models is combined with the critical micelle concentration (cmc) prediction sub-model to create an overall corrosion inhibition prediction model separately. Each of the created overall models is very robust in predicting corrosion inhibition of various surfactants in a variety of testing systems. The model derivation is mainly based on the mixed homologous <b>benzalkonium</b> <b>chlorides</b> in NaCl-containing aqueous solution and further validated using various testing systems of surfactants.

40|$|High {{strength}} wastewater (HSWW) {{generated in}} food processing industries {{is characterized by}} high organic carbon and nitrogen content, and thus high oxygen demand. Biological nitrogen removal (BNR) is a technology widely used {{for the treatment of}} HSWW. Food processing facilities practice sanitation to keep food contact surfaces clean and pathogen-free. <b>Benzalkonium</b> <b>chlorides</b> (BACs) are cationic quaternary ammonium antimicrobial compounds (QACs) common in industrial antimicrobial formulations. BAC-bearing wastewater generated during sanitation applications in food processing facilities is combined with other wastewater streams and typically treated in BNR systems. The poor selectivity and target specificity of the antimicrobial BACs negatively impact the performance of BNR systems due to the susceptibility of BNR microbial populations to BAC. Objectives of the research were: a) assessment and quantification of the inhibitory effect of QACs on the microbial groups, which mediate BNR in HSWW treatment systems while treating QAC-bearing HSWW; b) evaluation of the degree and extent of the contribution of QAC adsorption, inhibition, and biotransformation on the fate and effect of QACs in BNR systems. A laboratory-scale, multi-stage BNR system was continuously fed with real poultry processing wastewater amended with a mixture of three <b>benzalkonium</b> <b>chlorides.</b> The nitrogen removal efficiency initially deteriorated at a BAC feed concentration of 5 mg/L due to complete inhibition of nitrification. However, the system recovered after 27 days of operation achieving high nitrogen removal efficiency, even after the feed BAC concentration was stepwise increased up to 120 mg/L. Batch assays performed using the mixed liquors of the BNR system reactors, before, during, and post BAC exposure, showed that the development of BAC biotransformation capacity and the acquisition of resistance to BAC contributed to the recovery of nitrification and nitrogen removal. Kinetic analysis based on sub-models representing BNR processes showed that BAC inhibition of denitrification and nitrification is correlated with BAC liquid-phase and solid-phase concentrations, respectively. Simulations using a comprehensive mathematical BNR model developed for this research showed that BAC degradation and the level of nitrification inhibition by BAC were dynamic brought about by acclimation and enrichment of the heterotrophic and nitrifying microbial populations, respectively. The fate and effect of BACs in the BNR system were accurately described when the interactions between adsorption, inhibition, and resistance/biotransformation were considered within the conditions prevailing in each reactor. This work is the first study on the fate and effect of antimicrobial QACs in a continuous-flow, multi-stage BNR system, and the first study to quantify and report parameter values related to BAC inhibition of nitrification and denitrification. Results of this study enable the rational design and operation of BNR systems for the efficient treatment of QAC-bearing wastewater. The outcome of this research provides information presently lacking, supporting the continuous use of QACs as antimicrobial agents in food processing facilities, when and where needed, while avoiding any negative impacts on biological treatment systems and the environment.

40|$|Quaternary {{ammonium}} compounds (QACs) are a {{group of}} compounds of great economic significance. They are widely used as emulsifiers, detergents, solubilizers and corrosion inhibitors in household and industrial products. Due to their excellent antimicrobial activity QACs have also gained a special meaning as antimicrobials in hospitals, agriculture and the food industry. The main representatives of the microbiocidal QACs are the <b>benzalkonium</b> <b>chlorides</b> (BACs), which exhibit biocidal activity against most bacteria, fungi, algae and some viruses. However, the misuses of QACs, mainly at sublethal concentrations, can lead to an increasing resistance of microorganisms. One {{of the ways to}} avoid this serious problem is the introduction and use of new biocides with modified structures instead of the biocides applied so far. Therefore new BAC analogues P 13 âP 18 with pyridine rings were synthesized. The new compounds were characterized by NMR, FT-IR and ESI-MS methods. PM 3 semiempirical calculations of molecular structures and the heats of formation of compounds P 13 âP 18 were also performed. Critical micellization concentrations (CMCs) were determined to characterize the aggregation behavior of the new BAC analogues. The antimicrobial properties of novel QACs were examined by determining their minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values against the fungi Aspergillus niger, Candida albicans, Penicillium chrysogenum and bacteria Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

40|$|International audienceQuaternary {{ammonium}} compounds (QACs) {{are both}} cationic surfactants and biocidal substances widely used as disinfectants {{in the food}} industry. A sensitive and reliable method {{for the analysis of}} <b>benzalkonium</b> <b>chlorides</b> (BACs) and dialkyldimethylammonium chlorides (DDACs) has been developed that enables the simultaneous quantitative determination of ten quaternary ammonium residues in dairy products below the provisional maximum residue level (MRL), set at 0. 1 mgkg(- 1). To the best of our knowledge, this method could be the one applicable to milk and to three major processed milk products selected, namely processed or hard pressed cheeses, and whole milk powder. The method comprises solvent extraction using a mixture of acetonitrile and ethyl acetate, without any further clean-up. Analyses were performed by liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray tandem mass spectrometry detection (LC-ESI-MS/MS) operating in positive mode. A C 18 analytical column was used for chromatographic separation, with a mobile phase composed of acetonitrile and water both containing 0. 3 % formic acid; and methanol in the gradient mode. Five deuterated internal standards were added to obtain the most accurate quantification. Extraction recoveries were satisfactory and no matrix effects were observed. The method was validated using the total error approach in accordance with the NF V 03 - 110 standard in order to characterize the trueness, repeatability, intermediate precision and analytical limits within the range of 5 - 150 mugkg(- 1) for all matrices. These performance criteria, calculated by e. noval((R)) 3. 0 software, were satisfactory and in full accordance with the proposed provisional MRL and with the recommendations in the European Union SANTE/ 11945 / 2015 regulatory guidelines. The limit of detection (LOD) was low (< 1. 9 mugkg(- 1)) and the limit of quantification (LOQ) ranged from 5 mugkg(- 1) to 35 mugkg(- 1) for all matrices depending on the analytes.

40|$|<b>Benzalkonium</b> <b>chlorides</b> (BACs) {{are widely}} used, broad-spectrum {{disinfectants}} and frequently {{detected in the}} environment, even at toxic levels for life. Since such disinfectants can induce broad resistance capabilities, BACs may fuel the emergence of antibiotic resistance in the environment. A substantial body of literature has reported that exposure to BACs causes antibiotic resistance; yet, other {{studies suggest that the}} resistance linkage is rare, unsystematic, and/or clinically insignificant. Accordingly, whether or not disinfectant exposure mediates antibiotic resistance and, if so, what molecular mechanisms underlie the resistance link remains to be clearly elucidated. Further, understanding how microbial communities degrade BACs is important not only for alleviating the possible occurrence of antibiotic resistance but also reducing the potential risks to environmental and public health. An integrated strategy that combines metagenomics, metatranscriptomics, genetics, and traditional culture-dependent approaches was employed to provide novel insights into these issues. The integrative approach showed that a microbial community exposed to BACs can acquire antibiotic resistance through two mechanisms: i) horizontal transfer of previously uncharacterized efflux pump genes conferring resistance to BACs and antibiotics, which were encoded on a conjugative plasmid and co-selected together upon BACs and ii) selective enrichment of intrinsically multi-drug resistant organisms. Further, a microbial community adapts to BAC exposure via a variety of mechanisms, including selective enrichment of BAC-degrading species and amino acid substitutions and horizontal transfer of genes related to BAC resistance and degradation. The metatranscriptomic data suggests that the BAC-adapted microbial community metabolized BACs by cooperative interactions among its members. More specifically, Pseudomonas nitroreducens cleaved (i. e., dealkylated) BACs, metabolized the alkyl chain (the dealkylated product of BACs), and released benzyldimethylamine (the other product of BACs), which was further metabolized by other community members (e. g., Pseudomonas putida). Collectively, this study demonstrates the role of BACs in promoting antibiotic resistance and advances current understanding of a microbial community degrading BACs. The results of this work have important implications for (appropriate) usage of disinfectants and for assessing, predicting, and optimizing biological engineering processes treating BAC-bearing waste streams.
