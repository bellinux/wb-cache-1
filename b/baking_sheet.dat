2500|$|The {{most famous}} Crimean Karaite food is Kybyn ( [...] pl. , [...] kybyn pl. kybynlar, [...] ). Kybynlar are half moon shaped pies of leavened dough with a {{stuffing}} of chopped beef or mutton, baked in dutch oven or <b>baking</b> <b>sheet.</b> Other meals common for Crimean Karaites and Tatars are Chiburekki, Pelmeni, Shishlik (These {{are most often}} made from mutton).|$|E

50|$|The major {{ingredients}} of springerle are eggs, white (wheat) flour, and very fine or powdered sugar. The biscuits are traditionally anise-flavored, although the anise {{is not usually}} mixed into the dough; instead it is dusted onto the <b>baking</b> <b>sheets</b> so that the biscuit sits {{on top of the}} crushed anise seeds.|$|R
50|$|Sheet {{aluminium}} is spun or stamped into form. Due to {{the softness}} of the metal it may be alloyed with magnesium, copper, or bronze to increase its strength. Sheet aluminium is commonly used for <b>baking</b> <b>sheets,</b> pie plates, and cake or muffin pans. Deep or shallow pots may be formed from sheet aluminium.|$|R
5000|$|Every issue {{includes}} a detailed equipment test, where {{a panel of}} users tries a variety of items such as knives, cutting boards or <b>baking</b> <b>sheets.</b> In the case of more expensive pieces of equipment, an overall winner {{as well as a}} [...] "best buy" [...] are selected. Both types of tests sort their results into four categories: Highly Recommended, Recommended, Recommended with Reservations, and Not Recommended. As with recipes, much space is devoted to explaining the selection and testing process, and any exceptions to the general conclusions.|$|R
50|$|A sheet pan, {{baking tray}} or <b>baking</b> <b>sheet</b> is a flat, {{rectangular}} metal pan {{used in an}} oven. It is often used for baking bread rolls, pastries and flat products such as cookies, sheet cakes, swiss rolls and pizzas.|$|E
50|$|Cookie press: An {{automated}} or hand-operated cookie press, {{also called}} a cookie gun, {{is used to}} make large batches of cookies quickly. The cookie dough is extruded onto the <b>baking</b> <b>sheet</b> in ornate shapes {{that would otherwise be}} too difficult or time-consuming to create by hand.|$|E
5000|$|The Romans {{introduced}} an oven called a [...] "furn" [...] ("purni" [...] in Talmudic Aramaic), a large, wood-burning, stone-lined oven with a bottom {{on which the}} dough or <b>baking</b> <b>sheet</b> was placed. This provided a major advance in bread and pastry baking, and made the baking of much thicker loaves possible.|$|E
5000|$|To make springerle, very cold, stiff {{dough is}} rolled thin and pressed into a mold, or {{impressed}} by a specialized, carved rolling pin. The dough is unmolded {{and then left}} to dry for about 24 hours before being baked at a low temperature on greased, anise-dusted <b>baking</b> <b>sheets.</b> The drying period allows time for the pattern {{in the top of}} the cookie to set, so that the cookie has a [...] "pop-up" [...] effect from leavening, producing the characteristic [...] "foot" [...] along the edges, below the molded surface.|$|R
50|$|Professional sheet pans used in {{commercial}} kitchens typically {{are made of}} aluminum, with a 1 in raised lip around the edge, and in the United States come in standard sizes. The full-size sheet pan is 26 by 18 in, which is too large for most home ovens. A two thirds sheet pan (also {{referred to as a}} three quarter size sheet pan) is 21 by 15 in. A half sheet pan is 18 by 13 in; quarter sheets are 9 by 13 in. The half sheet is approximately the same size as mass-market <b>baking</b> <b>sheets</b> found in supermarkets, and the quarter sheet is a common size for rectangular, single-layer cakes. Other commercial kitchen equipment, such as cooling racks, ovens, and shelving, is made to fit these standard pans.|$|R
50|$|In the United States, kringles are hand-rolled from Danish pastry dough (wienerbrød dough) {{that has}} been rested {{overnight}} before shaping, filling, and <b>baking.</b> Many <b>sheets</b> of the flaky dough are layered, then shaped into an oval. After filling with fruit, nut, or other flavor combinations, the pastry is baked and iced.|$|R
50|$|The classic Ellio's pizza may be {{prepared}} {{only in a}} conventional or toaster oven. In each instance, the baking temperature is 425 degrees Fahrenheit (220 °C), with the pizza baking either directly on the rack for about 9-12 minutes, or on a <b>baking</b> <b>sheet</b> for 14-16 minutes (not more than 14 minutes in a toaster oven).|$|E
50|$|The {{most famous}} Crimean Karaite food is Kybyn (Кибина pl. , Karaim: kybyn pl. kybynlar, Kibinai). Kybynlar are half moon shaped pies of leavened dough with a {{stuffing}} of chopped beef or mutton, baked in dutch oven or <b>baking</b> <b>sheet.</b> Other meals common for Crimean Karaites and Tatars are Chiburekki, Pelmeni, Shishlik (These {{are most often}} made from mutton).|$|E
5000|$|Biscuits can be {{prepared}} for baking in several ways. The dough can be rolled out flat and cut into rounds, which expand when baked into flaky-layered cylinders. If extra liquid is added, the dough's texture changes to resemble stiff pancake batter so that small spoonfuls can be dropped into the <b>baking</b> <b>sheet</b> to produce [...] "drop biscuits," [...] which are more amorphous in texture and shape.|$|E
50|$|When {{finished}} <b>baking,</b> the <b>sheet</b> is rolled {{while still}} warm (to make jelly rolls or bûches de Noël), or cut and stacked into multiple layers or line a mold {{to be filled}} with a frozen dessert. A variety of fillings are used, such as jelly, chocolate, fruit, pastry cream, and whipped cream. The genoise can be piped in strips to make ladyfingers or into molds to make madeleines. It is the base for Jaffa Cakes.|$|R
50|$|Another {{method of}} making springerle {{is to not}} chill the dough at all. Commonly, after mixing all the {{ingredients}} together, one would cover a surface with flour, and use a regular rolling pin (also covered in flour) to roll out the dough to about half-an-inch of thickness. Flour would be spread over the top surface of the rolled-out dough, and also on the specialized Springerle rolling pin. One would whack the Springerle rolling pin against one's hand a few times, to dislodge any flour caked into the designs on it, and then proceed to carefully but firmly roll out the molds. One uses a knife to cut out the small, rectangular cookies (often 2x1 inches), and place them on a wooden board to dry overnight (or for at least twelve hours). As this process is repeated, the dough gets more brittle due to the added flour and doesn't hold the molds as well. Therefore, {{it is important to}} roll the dough out in small batches (instead of all at once), to keep the moisture in so the cookies hold together. Anise seed is sprinkled on the <b>baking</b> <b>sheets</b> just before putting them in the oven (about ten minutes is usually sufficient, but the cooking time also depends on thickness). 1-2 teaspoons of anise extract can also be added to the dough to increase the taste (which is rather like licorice), and the amount of cookies varies on the thickness. The usual recipe with 4 eggs and 3-4 cups of flour can yield anywhere from 60-144 cookies, depending on thickness and the experience of the maker.|$|R
50|$|With Kane {{absent from}} the arena, the falls count {{anywhere}} match for the WWF Tag Team Championship became a de facto handicap match. New Age Outlaws brought out a dumpster full of weapons, alluding to an incident in February where they had locked Mankind, as Cactus Jack, and Chainsaw Charlie in a dumpster and thrown it off the stage. Billy Gunn ran into the ring and met with a baking tray to his head from Mankind before the two had a sword fight of sorts, with a steel chair. Despite Mankind taking the advantage from this, the tandem attacks of <b>baking</b> <b>sheets</b> to the head subdued Mankind until he {{was caught in the}} ropes. After taking more weapons to the head, Mankind managed to toss Gunn over his back to the outside and fought Road Dogg into the corner. When Mankind went back out the ring to continue his assault on Gunn, though, the handicap caught up with him and he was thrown against the dumpster. Road Dogg opened up a table in the corner but Mankind managed to reverse the Irish whip, forcing Gunn through it. After a double team elevated neckbreaker did not dispatch him, he suffered a double team powerbomb through two chairs and again this did not keep Mankind down (although after Mankind kicked out, the Outlaws music briefly played) but finally a spiked piledriver onto the championship belt was enough to keep him down. After winning, Outlaws put Mankind in the dumpster and closed the lid. Whilst the Outlaws celebrated, the lid of the dumpster opened and Kane stood up, picking up a sledgehammer and throwing it down on an unseen Mankind inside the dumpster.|$|R
5000|$|Drops are a {{traditional}} small, round confectionery. It {{is a general}} term {{that can be used}} for any mixture of boiled sugar and flavourings that has been [...] "dropped" [...] onto a pan or <b>baking</b> <b>sheet</b> in rounds to set. In the 1840s, [...] drop roller machines came on the market. These machines took the hot, 120 °C, cooked sugar, and molded it into shapes between two hand cranked brass rollers.|$|E
5000|$|Cookie cutting sheet: Used {{for larger}} volumes, a {{production}} cookie cutting sheet {{is a piece}} of study plastic the size of a full sheet pan that essentially has dozens of cutout cookie cutters mounted on to it. [...] Rather than rolling out the dough and pressing the cutter into the top of the dough, the cutting sheet is placed of the <b>baking</b> <b>sheet,</b> cutting side up. A sheet of cookie dough, already rolled to the correct thickness, is laid on top of the cutting sheet, and a rolling pin is used to press the dough down on to the sharp edges of the cutting sheet. The cut cookies fall through the holes into the sheet, into their properly spaced positions on the <b>baking</b> <b>sheet.</b> The scrap dough and cutting sheet are removed, and the pan is ready for baking. Cookie cutter sheets allow high volume production without the time or risk of moving cut cookies to baking sheets, resulting in rapid production of a more uniformly shaped and spaced product.|$|E
50|$|The {{recipe for}} {{peppermint}} bark uses few ingredients, with only chocolate and mint candies required. Some recipes also add peppermint flavoring. The candies used may be candy canes. The candies should be broken up, and the chocolate is melted. These two ingredients are combined on a <b>baking</b> <b>sheet</b> and then chilled until firm. The bark is then {{removed from the}} sheet and broken into pieces {{in a similar way}} to peanut brittle.|$|E
50|$|This sheet-iron {{was used}} in Russia for stove flues and for roofing, among other tasks. Exported in {{quantity}} to the United States, it was notably used there for the cladding of steam locomotive boilers, where it found favor because paints of the time could not withstand the heat to which boiler cladding was subjected; its fine decorative finish went well with the brightly painted locomotives of the time.Its heat-resistant finish also brought it use to clad stoves, ovens, heating pipes and other similar tasks,and {{in the manufacture of}} <b>baking</b> pans and <b>sheets.</b>|$|R
50|$|In a large greased <b>baking</b> dish, {{individual}} <b>sheets</b> are layered one by {{one with}} small amounts of filling and sunflower oil or/and melted butter between them. After half of the sheets are placed in the pan, {{a large portion of}} the filling is spooned onto the leaves and is then covered with the remaining sheets and filling in the same manner. The pastry is then baked at 200-250 °C. In some recipes, just before the banitsa is finished, a glass of lemonade or sparkling water is poured into the tray, and the baking continues for several more minutes.|$|R
50|$|Putting a <b>baking</b> <b>sheet</b> {{pan over}} a furnace can allow for baking, {{which is in}} turn derived from {{the concept of the}} masonry oven. This was common for centuries, used to make breads, pies, and other items, and is still popular today, {{particularly}} among campers who enjoy stuffing their meats. Ovens can be made from cast iron, sheet metal or aluminum foil covered cardboard box. Reflector ovens are metal containers designed to surround an article of food being baked over an open flame and reflect the heat back towards the food.|$|E
50|$|The Hungarian kalács (pronounced ˈkɒlaːtʃ) is a sweet bread {{very similar}} to brioche, usually baked in a braided form, and {{traditionally}} considered an Easter food. Until {{the end of the}} 19th century, the preparation of kalács was similar to that of everyday bread; the difference was in the shape, and in the better/quality flour used for the kalács. Nowadays kalács is prepared from dough enriched with milk and eggs. It is baked in an oven or brick oven, sometimes directly on the stones of the brick oven, or on a <b>baking</b> <b>sheet.</b>|$|E
50|$|By using a <b>baking</b> <b>sheet</b> pan placed {{above the}} grill surface, {{as well as}} a drip pan below the surface, it is {{possible}} to combine grilling and roasting to cook meats that are stuffed or coated with breadcrumbs or batter, and to bake breads and even casseroles and desserts. When cooking stuffed or coated meats, the foods can be baked first on the sheet pan, and then placed directly on the grilling surface for char marks, effectively cooking twice; the drip pan will be used to capture any crumbs that fall off from the coating or stuffing.|$|E
50|$|Shortcake is {{typically}} made with flour, sugar, baking powder or soda, salt, butter, milk or cream, and sometimes eggs. The dry ingredients are blended, {{and then the}} butter is cut in until the mixture resembles cornmeal. The liquid ingredients are then mixed in just until moistened, resulting in a shortened dough. The dough is then dropped in spoonfuls onto a <b>baking</b> <b>sheet,</b> rolled and cut like baking powder biscuits, or poured into a cake pan, depending on how wet the dough is and the baker's preferences. Then it is baked at a relatively high temperature until set.|$|E
5000|$|Drop {{cookies are}} made from a {{relatively}} soft dough that is dropped by spoonfuls onto the <b>baking</b> <b>sheet.</b> During baking, the mounds of dough spread and flatten. Chocolate chip cookies (Toll House cookies), oatmeal (or oatmeal raisin) cookies, and rock cakes are popular examples of drop cookies. This may also include thumbprint cookies, for which a small central depression is created with a thumb or small spoon before baking to contain a filling, such as jam or a chocolate chip. In the UK, the term [...] "cookie" [...] often refers only to this particular type of product.|$|E
5000|$|Genoise {{is a basic}} {{building}} block of much French pâtisserie and is used for making several different types of cake. The batter usually is baked to form a thin sheet. An 1884 cookbook gives a simple recipe for a genoise: Work together briskly in a basin half a pound of flour, half a pound of sugar, and four eggs: after five minutes' good stirring, add {{a quarter of a}} pound of melted butter. Butter a square <b>baking</b> <b>sheet,</b> spread the paste upon it, and bake it in a moderate oven until it turns a golden yellow.|$|E
5000|$|One of {{the most}} common ways to prepare {{butternut}} squash is roasting. To do this, the squash is cut in half lengthwise (see pictures), lightly brushed with cooking oil or put in a thin layer of water and placed cut side down on a <b>baking</b> <b>sheet.</b> It is then baked for 45 minutes or until soft. Once roasted, it can be eaten in a variety of ways.The fruit is prepared by removing the skin, stalk, and seeds, which are not usually eaten or cooked. However, the seeds are edible, either raw or roasted, and the skin is also edible and softens when roasted.|$|E
