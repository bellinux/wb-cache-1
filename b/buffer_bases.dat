In one study, a drop in bicarbonate after 4  h and more significantly after 10  h has been reported after amino acid infusion as co-medication in ERT [15].

40|$|Systemic {{therapeutic}} hypothermia {{has gained}} a negative reputation in treating multiple trauma patients and is {{regarded as one of}} the factors in the lethal triad of shock, acidosis, and hypothermia. This fact owes to no relationship between acidosis and hypothermia; the effects of the latter on coagulation are evident and complexly reversible in the presence of acidosis. Objective: to determine the impact of noninvasive local brain cooling on the metabolic and blood coagulation indicators of a patient with acute cerebral ischemia. Subjects and methods. The subjects of the study were 113 patients with severe brain injury, including that complicated by the involvement of stem structures, who underwent brain cooling in different modifications. In so doing, the val ues of acidbase balance and coagulation system in arterial and venous blood were investigated. Results. Local brain hypother mia was not found to affect coagulation while the baseline negative values of excess <b>buffer</b> <b>bases</b> showed positive values (a right shift) by the end of cooling. Recommendations were given to prevent metabolic shifts. Conclusion. Patients at very high risk for bleeding may be safely cooled to a brain temperature of 32 — 34 °C even in the presence of moderatetosevere acidosis. This is a great advantage of local hypothermia over systemic one. </p...|$|E

40|$|Water {{oxidation}} in {{the neutral}} pH regime catalyzed by amorphous transition-metal oxides is of high interest in energy science. Crucial determinants of electrocatalytic activity were investigated for a cobalt-based oxide film electrodeposited at various thicknesses on inert electrodes. For water oxidation at low current densities, the turnover frequency (TOF) per cobalt ion of the bulk material stayed fully constant for {{variation of the}} thickness of the oxide film by a factor of 100 (from about 15  nm to 1. 5  μm). Thickness variation changed neither the nanostructure of the outer film surface nor the atomic structure of the oxide catalyst significantly. These findings imply catalytic activity of the bulk hydrated oxide material. Nonclassical dependence on pH was observed. For buffered electrolytes with pK a values of the <b>buffer</b> <b>base</b> ranging from 4. 7 (acetate) to 10. 3 (hydrogen carbonate), the catalytic activity reflected the protonation state of the <b>buffer</b> <b>base</b> in the electrolyte solution directly and not the intrinsic catalytic properties of the oxide itself. It is proposed that catalysis of water oxidation occurs within the bulk hydrated oxide film at the margins of cobalt oxide fragments of molecular dimensions. At high current densities, the availability of a proton-accepting base at the catalyst–electrolyte interface controls the rate of water oxidation. The reported findings may be of general relevance for water oxidation catalyzed at moderate pH by amorphous transition-metal oxides...|$|R
