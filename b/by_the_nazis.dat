50|$|By 1942, German and Italian armies ruled Norway, the Low Countries, France, the Balkans, Central Europe, part of Russia, {{and most}} of North Africa. Japan by this year ruled much of China, Southeast Asia, Indonesia, the Philippines, and many Pacific Islands.

Eleven million people - six million of them Jews - were systematically murdered <b>by</b> <b>the</b> German <b>nazis</b> <b>by</b> 1945.|$|R

5|$|Although Jews are an ethnoreligious group, {{they were}} defined <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Nazis</b> on purely racial grounds. The Nazi Party viewed the Jewish {{religion}} as irrelevant, persecuting Jews {{in accordance with}} antisemitic stereotypes of an alleged biologically determined heritage. Defining Jews as the chief enemy, Nazi racial ideology was also used to persecute other minorities.|$|E
5|$|Austrian and Czech foreign {{exchange}} reserves were soon seized <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Nazis,</b> as were stockpiles of raw materials such as metals and completed goods such as weaponry and aircraft, which were shipped back to Germany.

5|$|The former Belgian army fort at Breendonk, near Mechelen, was requisitioned <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Nazis</b> {{and used}} for detainment and {{interrogation}} of Jews, political prisoners and captured members of the resistance.

5|$|Despite this, while {{commanding}} Army Group Centre, {{he refused}} to dispatch troops {{to put down the}} Warsaw uprising (a task that ultimately was carried out by the SS), viewing it as a rear-area matter.

On the other hand, he showed no hesitation in clearing the Warsaw suburbs of Praga and Saska Kępa, through which vital supply lines ran.|$|E
5|$|In German-occupied Poland {{the task}} of rescuing Jews was {{especially}} difficult and dangerous. All household members were punished by death if a Jew was found concealed in their home or on their property.

5|$|In July 1942, the Germans ordered Gens {{to give up}} 500 {{children}} and old people, but by late July he had persuaded the Germans to abandon the order for children to be surrendered. He reduced the entire command to 100 older residents, and on 26 July handed over 84 elderly, mostly terminally ill or disabled, who were then executed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Nazis.</b> The Jewish administration employed over 1500 people in September 1942, including some intellectuals who were appointed to jobs to ensure their survival. This suggestion was made by community leaders and approved by Gens.|$|E
50|$|The line of festivals {{was itself}} {{affected}} by World War II, as <b>the</b> <b>nazis</b> took over <b>the</b> community's house and thus in 1941 and 1943 {{there was no}} revue shown. However, the 2005 revue Origo {{tells the story of}} a show indeed being written and rehearsed in 1943, on the authority of Norwegian Nazi sympathizer Vidkun Quisling, in order to turn the citizens of Trondheim to the nazi's side. However, the show was sabotaged by a Norwegian rebel, not unlike the sabotage at Rjukan during the war. Quisling discovered the day before the premiere that his revue made fun of <b>the</b> <b>nazis</b> instead of portray them well, and in rage he demanded the revue cancelled. Origo further on tells that the script, film reels and costumes was found below Samfundet during a renovation in 2005, and so a reconstruction of the sabotaged never-existing play Quiss-e-ling could be shown in the 2005 revue, to acclaim the until-now unknown war hero.|$|R
40|$|The {{capture of}} power <b>by</b> Hitler and <b>the</b> nazi {{movement}} in 1933 {{was one of}} the great turning-points in modern history. Yet its significance is usually seen to rest less upon what occurred in 1933 than upon what happened later. This article is an attempt to integrate the history of the nazi capture of power into what followed from it by examining four themes: war, racism, violence and order. Each of these themes was central to what happened in 1933. The first world war cast a long shadow over the politics of Weimar Germany, and this helped to create a climate conducive to nazism; racism inspired nazi activists and acceptance of racist assumptions was generally widespread; violence, both in word and deed, characterized nazi politics and helped <b>the</b> <b>nazis</b> to consolidate power rapidly in 1933; and a (misplaced) desire for order drove many Germans — among both the èlites and voters — into the arms of <b>the</b> <b>nazis.</b> Thus these broad themes, which frame the history of the Third Reich generally, also frame the history of the nazi capture of power. ...|$|R

5|$|In late 1980 Matlock {{had been}} {{appointed}} Ambassador to Czechoslovakia by President Jimmy Carter. However, the appointment was not ratified by the Senate before Carter’s election loss, {{and so it was}} with Ronald Reagan’s re-appointment in 1981 that he became Ambassador to Czechoslovakia.

5|$|Nevertheless, {{underground}} {{organizations and}} individuals – {{in particular the}} Polish Underground State – saved much of Poland's most valuable cultural treasures, and worked to salvage as many cultural institutions and artifacts as possible.

They jump-kicked him, kicked him {{in the back of his}} head, hit him with a burning piece of wood in his neck and pushing him into the fire to burn him, stomping on his stomach, destroying their belongings and setting fire to their tent.
