40|$|This report {{deals with}} {{systematic}} experiments {{carried out on}} five diaphragm materials with different pretreatment, {{for the purpose of}} ascertaining the suitability of such materials for slack diaphragms. The relationship of deflection and load, temperature and moisture, was recorded. Of the explored materials, synthetic leather, <b>balloon</b> <b>cloth,</b> goldbeaters skin, Igelit and Buna, synthetic leather treated with castor oil is the most suitable material for the small pressure range required. <b>Balloon</b> <b>cloth</b> is nearly as good, while goldbeaters skin, Igelit and Buna were found to be below the required standards...|$|E
40|$|Materials for {{wrapping}} surgical dressings {{were studied}} by a method which measured the recontamination rate in packs stored for periods {{of up to}} several weeks. Of the materials tested a thick crêpe paper was better than calico and <b>balloon</b> <b>cloth</b> fabrics. Dressings wrapped in paper were not significantly contaminated after storage in dusty places for periods of up to three weeks. For added protection during handling and for convenience in transport and storage, paper packs may be sterilized and kept in paper-lined cartons. The shelf life in good storage conditions would be many weeks at least...|$|E

Thanks to its a diameter of 23 m, Andreani made the first balloon flight {{when he was only}} 20. The paper-lined <b>cloth</b> <b>balloon</b> had a wickerwork passenger carrier. The hot air was created by burning birch wood, alcohol, and turpentine. The balloon took less than four weeks to make and weighed about 1300 kg when it was fuelled and had three passengers aboard. The first flight took place on 25 February 1784 when Andreani, [...] and Charles Gerli flew for 25 minutes without incident.|$|R
