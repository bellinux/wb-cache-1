40|$|This paper {{describes}} an anti-personnel landmine detection system, {{which is based}} on the neutron <b>back-scattering</b> <b>technique.</b> It consists of a point-like isotopic neutron source (252 Cf, 2, 31 × 107 n/s), eight BF 3 detectors and a neutron moderating and shielding block made from borated paraffin (3 wt%). It was modeled and tested by carrying out Monte Carlo calculations (MCNP- 4 C 2 Code). The tests were performed in some troublesome conditions which include long burial depths for a landmine, higher humidity levels in the formation and existence of some plastics-like substances in the scanning area near a mine. Use of the neutron moderator behind the BF 3 detectors increased the counting statistics and improved the S/N ratio. The system could detect a small cylindrical land mine (< 300 g) until a burial depth of 15 cm in limestone and also worked well in distinguishing trinitrotoluene (TNT) from the other nearby substances. However, the presence of moisture in limestone in the level of 5 % limited its applicability. Scanning speed of the system was calculated as 9. 6 m 2 /min on an even land surface.

Such systems would only be feasible if the received signal doppler broadening was small. Previous investigation in auroral latitudes by <b>back-scatter</b> <b>techniques</b> has shown that scatter velocities of up to several km/s are not uncommon. A 50 watt transmitter was set up in Fort Smith, N. W. T. using a five-element Yagi antenna and operating on a frequency of 40. 49 Mc/s. At Saskatoon, an identical antenna was used in conjunction with a receiver whose bandwidth could be varied from 5 c/s to 100 c/s. By changing the bandwidth an noting its effect on the received signal-to-noise radio, it was possible to estimate that the received signal, under undisturbed and mildly disturbed conditions, had a bandwidth of the order of 10 c/s. This corresponds to a r. m. s. scatterer velocity of about 50 m/s. There was some evidence to show that velocities greater than 50 m/s do occur during periods when the ionosphere is greatly disturbed. These periods, however, are always associated with an enhancement int eh received signal amplitude. The experiments indicate that, using a 100 watt transmitter a receiver with a bandwidth of 10 c/s an antenna similar to those used, an information rate of at least 10 words/minute would be possible 99. 9 % of the time over a path length of 1000 km...|$|R

40|$|The work {{described}} in the thesis focuses on understanding large-scale mean ExB flows, fine-scale zonal flows and turbulent transport in ohmic plasma discharges in the small Russian FT- 2 tokamak from a first principal basis. The investigations are performed with the full-fparticle-in-cell (PIC) code Elmfire which calculates the time evolution of the full distribution function of the electrons and a selection of ions while self-consistently calculating the electric field making the code suitable to study neoclassical and turbulent transport processes simultaneously. The equations solved in the Elmfire code {{are based on a}} set of gyrokinetic Vlasov equations which explicitly includes the polarization drift in the equations of motion by using an alternative definition for the gyrocenter. The differences to the standard gyrokinetic model and the advantages of this treatment for particle-in-cell codes are addressed. The coefficient matrix for the Poisson equation is constructed implicitly from the ion polarization and the electron parallel nonlinearity. Two types of interpolation schemes to obtain the particle electric field from the grid are implemented in the Elmfire code and their influence on the particle transport and momentum conservation are discussed. Collisions are treated by a binary collision model. The dependence of the transport quantities on the spatial resolution and the influence of particle noise are addressed. Steady state simulation profiles are obtained by the balance of ohmic heating and particle/energy transport, radiation losses and energy transported to a limiter surface.
