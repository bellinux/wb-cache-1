25|$|The {{building}} has undergone many expansions. Most important were {{the construction of}} a new east wing in the early 20th century based on the plans of Anastasios Metaxas and {{the construction of a}} two-storeyed building, designed by George Nomikos, during 1932–1939. These expansions were necessary to accommodate the rapidly growing collection of artifacts. The most recent refurbishment of the museum took more than 1.5years to complete, during which the museum remained completely closed. It reopened in July 2004, in time for the Athens Olympics and it included an aesthetic and technical upgrade of the <b>building,</b> <b>installation</b> of a modern air-conditioning system, reorganisation of the museum's collection and repair of the damage caused by the 1999 earthquake. The Minoan frescoes rooms opened to the public in 2005. On May 2008 the Culture Minister Mihalis Liapis inaugurated the much anticipated collection of Egyptian antiquities and the collection of Eleni and Antonis Stathatos. Today, there is a renewed discussion regarding the need to further expand the museum to adjacent areas. A new plan has been made for a subterranean expansion at the front of the museum.|$|E

5000|$|On July 23, 2015, V.C. Summer Unit 2 {{reached a}} {{landmark}} milestone with the successful {{placement of the}} CA-01 module, one of the largest, heaviest, and most complicated modules within the Nuclear Island, {{also referred to as}} a super module because it was so large that huge submodules had to be shipped from the manufacturer and final assembly was completed on site in the twelve-story Module Assembly <b>Building.</b> <b>Installation</b> of CA-01 was long delayed due to both regulatory and production hurdles related to the module. It is the first of the US AP1000 reactors under construction to achieve placement of this critical module, beating Vogtle Unit 3 to this milestone, and allowing other construction activities in the Nuclear Island to progress that could not proceed until the module was in place. CA-01 is a large structural module that forms the internal structures of some compartments within the Containment Vessel, including the Steam Generator compartments, Reactor Vessel cavity, and Refueling Canal. The CA-01 Module is the heaviest module on site, weighing 1,200 tons, or 2.4 million pounds. Because of how much it weighs, lifting and placing the CA-01 module into the Unit 2 Nuclear Island resulted in the heaviest lift for the V.C. Summer construction project to date.|$|E

40|$|Microgrids are {{becoming}} popular in commercial buildings {{due to the}} recent drive to achieve net-zero energy targets and improve energy efficiency and reliability in <b>building</b> <b>installations.</b> The commercial <b>building</b> microgrids depict unique characteristics due to generation mix and various types of loads connected to the commercial <b>building</b> <b>installations.</b> Therefore, the commercial building microgrids require special consideration during the operation and control stages. Dynamic models of a microgrid enable researchers to investigate their operational performance and control techniques before the control schemes are actually being implemented in the microgrid system. It is essential to develop more accurate dynamic simulation models of a microgrid in order to verify the fidelity {{and the effectiveness of}} control schemes. This chapter presents a dynamic modelling of a commercial building microgrid system and conducts a stability analysis of the microgrid under various operating conditions...|$|R
