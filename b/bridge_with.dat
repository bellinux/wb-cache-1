5|$|Abbotsford Bridge is a steel Allan truss-type bridge {{spanning}} the Murray River between Curlwaa, New South Wales, and Yelta, Victoria.

30|$|AASHTO (2011) {{stated that}} {{two-dimensional}} model {{is sufficient for}} <b>bridges</b> <b>with</b> skew angle less than 30 °; however, for <b>bridges</b> <b>with</b> larger skew angles, three-dimensional (3 D) models that account for the skew angle are necessary. It is generally agreed that <b>bridges</b> <b>with</b> skew angles greater than 20 ° exhibit complex response characteristics under seismic loads. Saiidi and Orie (1992) noted the skew effects and suggested that simplified models and methods of analysis would result in sufficiently accurate predictions of seismic response for <b>bridges</b> <b>with</b> skew angles less than 15 °. On the other hand, Maleki (2002) concluded that slab-on-girder <b>bridges</b> <b>with</b> skew angles up to 30 ° and spans up to 20 [*]m have comparable response characteristics to straight bridges, and therefore, simplified modeling techniques such as rigid deck modeling were justified in many cases. Bjornsson et al. (1997) conducted an extensive parametric study of two-span skew <b>bridges</b> modeled <b>with</b> rigid deck assumption. In this study, the maximum relative abutment displacement {{was found to be}} influenced strongly by the impact between the deck and the abutments. A critical skew angle was introduced as a function of span length and width that maximizes the rotational impulse due to impact, and it was found to be between 45 ° and 60 °.|$|R
40|$|Prior {{to modern}} seismic codes, several road bridges were not {{designed}} for earthquakes in many moderate seismic regions. The seismic performance of these bridges is questionable. A portfolio of 30 non- seismically designed bridges is compiled for seismic reliability assessment. Fragility analysis is conducted, the reliability of each structure is determined considering typical moderate seismic areas. The study shows that slab and multi-girder <b>bridges</b> <b>with</b> elastomeric bearings perform worse; girder <b>bridges</b> <b>with</b> conventional bearings and multi-girder <b>bridges</b> <b>with</b> monolithic joints have better behavior. It is also shown that seismic design per Eurocode 8 leads to a reliability index of 2...|$|R

5|$|Continuing eastwards, {{the river}} is crossed by Iping Bridge at Iping, a narrow stone <b>bridge</b> <b>with</b> five arches dating from the seventeenth century. To {{the west of the}} bridge is the site of Iping watermill. A mill was {{recorded}} there in the Domesday survey, completed in 1086. By 1665, there were the remains of a fulling mill at the site, and a wheat-mill and malt-mill, both part of the same building. It became a paper mill in the eighteenth century, and continued to operate until it was destroyed by fire in 1930. At Stedham, part of the civil parish of Stedham with Iping, Stedham Lane crosses the river on a stone <b>bridge</b> <b>with</b> six segmental arches. Five of them date from the seventeenth century, with one later addition. The river then makes a large loop to the north, where Stedham Mill was situated. The mill building has been demolished, but the mill house is a listed structure. After the loop, Woolbeding Bridge, on the northern Edge of Midhurst, dates from the fifteenth or sixteenth centuries. It has four segmental arches, was restored in 1919, and is a grade II* listed structure.|$|E
