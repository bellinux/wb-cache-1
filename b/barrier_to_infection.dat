Methods We performed a qualitative study to examine facilitators and <b>barriers</b> <b>to</b> <b>infection</b> control at an 800 -bed, private, tertiary hospital in Manila, Philippines.

Experimental infections show that aquatic microfauna can rapidly lower the abundance and density of infectious stages by consuming Bd zoospores, resulting in a significantly reduced probability of infection in anuran tadpoles.

Because of the long incubation period to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), a vaccine trial with AIDS as the outcome {{would be a long}} and costly undertaking. Because contagiousness is concentrated into the period of primary infection, vaccine trials assessing contagiousness would not take as long. An approach to assessing vaccine effects on the contagiousness of primary infection while simulta-neously assessing protection against infection is presented.

Effective implementation of infection control practices is crucial to reducing the transmission of hospital acquired infections at hospitals worldwide.

The Systems Engineering Initiative for Patient Safety (SEIPS) model examines problems {{through the lens of}} interactions between people and systems.

Althoughmice are highly susceptible to CVB 3 infection when virus is delivered by intraperitoneal injection, infection by the enteral route is very inefficient. Murine DAF, un-like human DAF, does not bind virus, and {{we hypothesized that}} the absence of an accessible receptor on the intestinal surface is an important <b>barrier</b> <b>to</b> <b>infection</b> by the oral route. We generated transgenic mice that express human DAF specifically on intes-tinal epithelium andmeasured their susceptibility to infection by a DAF-binding CVB 3 isolate. Human DAF permitted CVB 3 to bind to the intestinal surface ex vivo and to infect polarized monolayers of small-intestinal epithelial cells derived fromDAF transgenic mice.

40|$|SummaryA vaginal {{microbicide}} should prevent pathogen transmission without disrupting tissue <b>barriers</b> <b>to</b> <b>infection.</b> Ideally, {{it would}} {{not need to be}} applied immediately before sexual intercourse, when compliance is a problem. Intravaginal administration of small interfering RNA (siRNA) lipoplexes targeting Herpes Simplex Virus Type 2 (HSV- 2) genes protects mice from HSV- 2. However, protection is short-lived, and the transfection lipid on its own unacceptably enhances transmission. Here, we show that cholesterol-conjugated (chol) -siRNAs without lipid silence gene expression in the vagina without causing inflammation or inducing interferons. A viral siRNA prevents transmission within a day of challenge, whereas an siRNA targeting the HSV- 2 receptor nectin- 1 protects for a week, but protection is delayed for a few days until the receptor is downmodulated. Combining siRNAs targeting a viral and host gene protects mice from HSV- 2 for a week, irrespective of the time of challenge.

Lactobacilli are relevant as a <b>barrier</b> <b>to</b> <b>infection</b> and are important in the impairment of colonization by pathogens, owing to competitive adherence to adhesion sites in the vaginal epithelium and their capacity to produce antimicrobial compounds. Methods: The aim {{of the present study}} was to demonstrate the inhibitory capability of Lactobacillus metabolites against Clostridium perfringens, an anaerobic Gram-positive bacterium. These bacteria were isolated from vaginal swabs by using culture-dependent approaches, and the bacteriostatic effect of Lactobacillus metabolites, extracted from different isolates, was assessed using a modified E test. Results: Among the 100 vaginal swabs, 59 (59 %) samples showed the presence of Lactobacillus strains and only one sample contained C. perfringens.

Interventions should focus on needle disposal, handwashing, cross-contamination, and cleaning prior to sterilization. Tattooists with > or = 10 years of experience are most in need of intervention. National guidelines for tattooing infection control and strategies for collaboration between public health officials and tattooists are needed...|$|R
40|$|Evidence for the antiquity and {{importance}} of microbial pathogens as selective agents {{is found in the}} proliferation of antimicrobial defences throughout the animal kingdom. Social insects, typified by crowding and often by low genetic variation, have high probabilities of disease transmission and eusocial Hymenoptera may be particularly vulnerable because of haplodiploidy. Mechanisms they employ {{to reduce the risk of}} disease include antimicrobial secretions which are particularly important primary <b>barriers</b> <b>to</b> <b>infection.</b> However, until now, whether or not there is selection for stronger antimicrobial secretions when the risk of disease increases because of sociality has not been tested. Here, we present evidence that the production of progressively stronger antimicrobial compounds was critical to the evolution of sociality in bees. We found that increases in group size and genetic relatedness were strongly correlated with increasing antimicrobial strength. The antimicrobials of even the most primitive semi-social species were an order of magnitude stronger that those of solitary species, suggesting a point of no return, beyond which disease control was essential. Our results suggest that selection by microbial pathogens was critical to the evolution of sociality and required the production of strong, front-line antimicrobial defences. 3 page(s...|$|R
