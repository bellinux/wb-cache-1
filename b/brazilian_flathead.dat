50|$|They {{are small}} fishes: the largest species, the <b>Brazilian</b> <b>flathead,</b> Percophis brasiliensis, grows {{up to about}} 50 cm, but 10 to 20 cm is more typical. A few species are fished commercially, {{including}} the <b>Brazilian</b> <b>flathead.</b>|$|E
40|$|Spawning {{frequency}} and batch fecundity were estimated for <b>Brazilian</b> <b>flathead,</b> Percophis brasiliensis, in Argentine coastal waters. Samples {{of this species}} were collected during the spawning period in November 1998 and 1999. Spawning frequency, determined using the percentage of females with postovulatory follicles, was about 17 % during November 1998. This percentage indicates that P. brasiliensis spawned, on average, once every 6 days during this month. Batch fecundity, estimated from counts of hydrated oocytes, was fitted to a power function of length and a linear function of ovary-free female weight. Batch fecundity ranged from 37, 500 (47 cm total length) to 614, 300 (68 cm total length) hydrated oocytes. Relative fecundity estimated for the two years sampled ranged from 95 to 672 hydrated oocytes/g of female weight (ovary-free). Annual differences in the size-batch fecundity relationship and in the relative fecundity were observed...|$|E
40|$|In a {{fish paste}} made with cooked <b>Brazilian</b> <b>flathead</b> (Percophis brasiliensis), {{glycerol}} (17 %), sodium chloride (1. 5 %) and potassium sorbate (0. 1 %) the following acid percentages: 0. 2; 0. 4; 0. 6; 0. 8, 1 and 1. 5 % w/w were incorporated {{to determine the}} relationship between added acetic acid and the sensorially perceived intensity, {{and the effects of}} the combination of sweet-acid tastes. Tests for paired comparison, ranking and structured verbal scales for sweet and acid attributes and psychophysical test were carried out. There was a perceptible difference among samples for differences of 0. 4 units of acid concentration. Samples indicated as sweeter by 89. 47 % of the judges were those containing a lesser acid concentration. A reduction in glycerol sweetness when increasing acid levels was observed. Acetic acid reduced the sweetness of glycerol and inversely glycerol reduced the acidity of acetic acid. The data obtained with the magnitude estimation test agree with Steven's law...|$|E
40|$|The age {{and growth}} {{parameters}} of <b>Brazilian</b> <b>flathead,</b> Percophis brasiliensis, {{from the southwest}} Atlantic coastal waters (34 °- 41 °S) were determined for samples collected in spring (n = 853; years 1998 and 2000) and winter (n = 596; year 2004), whereas age was validated through the edge analysis of otoliths collected in 2007 (n = 1367 otoliths). The indices of precision APE, V, and D were {{used to test the}} reproducibility, between agers, of the ages determined from 845 otoliths. Maximum determined ages were 19 years for males and 15 years for females. One opaque and one translucent band are laid down per year, in the sagittal otolith. According to the APE (0. 668 %), V (1. 121 %), and D (0. 647 %) indices, the age determination was consistent. Von Bertalanffy's growth parameters [males: spring (L&# 8734; = 58. 1 cm, k = 0. 26 year- 1, t 0 = - 2. 02 years), winter (L&# 8734; = 58. 7 cm, k = 0. 21 year- 1, t 0 = - 2. 90 years); females: spring (L&# 8734; = 65. 2 cm, k = 0. 29 year- 1, t 0 = - 1. 15 years), winter (L&# 8734;= 63. 5 cm, k = 0. 26 year- 1, t 0 = - 2. 01 years) ] were significantly different between sexes and seasons. From the first year of life, females grow faster and reach greater lengths than males of the same age due, probably, to an asynchronism in the sexual maturity...|$|E
