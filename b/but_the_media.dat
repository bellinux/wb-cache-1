5|$|As with {{cultural}} studies, media {{study is a}} distinct discipline that owes to the convergence of sociology and other social sciences and humanities, in particular, literary criticism and critical theory. Though the production process or the critique of aesthetic forms {{is not in the}} remit of sociologists, analyses of socializing factors, such as ideological effects and audience reception, stem from sociological theory and method. Thus the 'sociology of the media' is not a subdiscipline per se, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>media</b> is a common and often-indispensable topic.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with their}} regular training, Bobrov had the Soviet players take boxing lessons in {{preparation}} for the series. The Soviets arrived in Montreal not long before the series, on August 30. Staying at Montreal's Queen Elizabeth Hotel, the team began two-a-day workouts at the St. Laurent Arena the next day. They were already acclimatized to the time zone as the team had been training on Montreal time for two weeks before travelling there. They brought 15 forwards, nine defencemen and three goaltenders. Veteran defenceman Vitaly Davydov did not accompany the team to Canada. The reason given was injury, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>media</b> questioned if Davydov had fallen out of favour with Bobrov. Firsov was reported as having a knee injury to explain his omission from the team.|$|E

The state Chief Minister Anandiben Patel resigned, citing her age, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>media</b> speculated that the handling of agitation was one of her reasons. On 4 August, the Gujarat High Court quashed the 10% EBC reservation, citing it as unconstitutional and in violation of guidelines of the Supreme Court. The government challenged the order in the Supreme Court on 9 August. Other leaders of PAAS accused Hardik Patel of spending the community's money on furthering his personal interests.|$|E
25|$|Inside, they {{discover}} Magdalene's tomb has been removed. Langdon realizes that Sophie's family {{died in a}} car crash, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>media</b> reported she too had died. Saunière was not her actual grandfather but her protector, and she is the last descendant of Jesus Christ. The two are greeted by several members of the Priory, including Sophie's grandmother, who promises to protect her. Langdon and Sophie part ways, the former returning to Paris. While shaving, he cuts himself and has an epiphany when his blood curves down the sink, reminding him of the Rose Line. Realizing the true meaning of the cryptex clue, he follows the line to the Louvre, concluding the Holy Grail, the sarcophagus of Mary Magdalene, is hidden in a shopping mall. Langdon kneels before it, as the Knights Templar did before him.|$|E

25|$|On December 22, 2006 in an {{agreement}} amongst the Coast Guard, National Guard and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts a partnership {{was created in}} which the Coast Guard would assume control of the aviation facilities from the Air Force (Runways, taxiways, etc.) while the Air National Guard will manage the utilities (Electricity, water, sewerage, etc.) and the state will fund the emergency services and fire protection. The Federal Aviation Administration has released new flight procedures that identify the ICAO code KFMH {{with the name of}} Coast Guard Air Station Cape Cod. This does not signify a name change as it has not been officially announced. The FAA sometimes does issue plans that call an airport a different name than is commonly known. With the control of the airfield changing hands, improvements to the lighting system were put in control of the Coast Guard. The base is still known as Otis among locals, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>media</b> reports it as Coast Guard Air Station Cape Cod.|$|E

The power cables that string into the craft fully activate {{it for the first}} time, and glowing and humming like a living thing it starts to draw upon this energy source and awaken the ancient racial programming. Those Londoners in whom the alien admixture remains strong fall under the ship's influence; they merge into a group mind and begin a telekinetic mass murder of those without the alien genes, an ethnic cleansing of those the alien race mind considers to be impure and weak.|$|E
500|$|In 2006 DC drew {{widespread}} {{media attention}} by announcing a new, lesbian {{incarnation of the}} well-known character Batwoman even while openly lesbian characters such as Gotham City police officer Renee Montoya already existed in DC Comics. It was revealed at the 2009 New York Comic Con {{that she would be}} DC Comics' highest profile gay superhero, appearing in a new Justice League comic book written by James Robinson and taking over as the lead character in Detective Comics with issue #854. Greg Rucka said that DC's editors had no problem with his writing Montoya or Batwoman as lesbian, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>media</b> controversy over Batwoman's sexuality [...] "nullified any positive effect Batwoman might have had on the industry" [...] and forced the character into minor roles during major crossover storylines.

500|$|Boisselier {{confidently}} {{announced at}} a press conference in Florida in December 2002 that Clonaid had successfully produced a live-born clone, named Eve, for an infertile couple. Canadian sociologist Susan J. Palmer notes that naming the cloned child [...] "Eve" [...] recalls Raël's teachings that aliens created the first humans through cloning. After the announcement, Boisselier received abundant press, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>media,</b> particularly late-night comedy programs, criticized her glamorous appearance and mocked Raëlism. Around that time, Boisselier appeared on many U.S. network news broadcasts and on CNN. She did not provide details about the child or its family, although she was often asked to. She hired a science editor from ABC to supervise verification of the cloning. Many scientists doubted that the Raëlians could overcome the difficulties that human cloning posed, or that {{they would be able to}} produce a healthy child. Boisselier said a DNA test was forthcoming and announced that five more clones would be born later that winter. As Raël and Boisselier continued to seek media exposure, journalistic animosity towards them grew.|$|E
500|$|Mouton's only WRC {{event of}} the year was the long-distance Rallye Côte d'Ivoire. She was co-driven by Arne Hertz as Pons was ill {{at the time of the}} start. Mouton started well and tied the lead with Toyota's Juha Kankkunen after the first day. Her Quattro {{incurred}} severe engine problems on the next day, but was seemingly repaired by Audi mechanics off the route in the jungle. At the same time, the Sport Quattro [...] "chase car", a high-speed service car, retired and Audi faced accusations of swapping the cars. The team withdrew Mouton just before the finish and the controversy remains unresolved; the stewards did not find proof <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>media</b> published evidence afterwards. Although her rallying year was a disappointment, Mouton made a successful return to the Pikes Peak, winning the event overall in her Sport Quattro. Despite slippery conditions caused by a hailstorm, she broke Al Unser, Jr.'s 1982 record by about thirteen seconds. The Frenchwoman's win irritated some of her male rivals. Bobby Unser was reputedly quite vocal about his loss, to which Mouton is said to have replied: [...] "If you have the balls you can try to race me back down as well." ...|$|E
500|$|Spiegelman's work as {{cartoonist}} {{and editor}} {{had long been}} known and respected in the comics community, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>media</b> attention after the first volume's publication in 1986 was unexpected. [...] Hundreds of overwhelmingly positive reviews appeared, and Maus {{became the center of}} new attention focused on comics. [...] It was considered one of the [...] "Big Three" [...] book-form comics from around 1986–1987, along with Watchmen and The Dark Knight Returns, that are said to have brought the term [...] "graphic novel" [...] and the idea of comics for adults into mainstream consciousness. [...] It was credited with changing the public's perception of what comics could be at a time when, in the English-speaking world, they were considered to be for children, and strongly associated with superheroes. [...] Initially, critics of Maus showed a reluctance to include comics in literary discourse. [...] The New York Times intended praise when saying of the book, [...] "Art Spiegelman doesn't draw comic books". [...] After its Pulitzer Prize win, it won greater acceptance and interest among academics. [...] The Museum of Modern Art staged an exhibition on the making of Maus in 1991–92.|$|E

But I spent a total of 15 years—if you count the first year I played her on Dallas. That was quite an investment for me as an actress. If you were playing a goody-two-shoes today, the tabloid media would be dying to catch you on a bad day. [...] Look at what they’ve done to Tiger Woods. Look at what they’ve done to that man. My feeling is his father—or the absence of his father in his life—is (the root of) what’s going on with Tiger and that marriage. <b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>media</b> won’t leave him alone. No matter who you are, (the celebrity coverage) is obsessive and constant. It’s hurtful. For me, if they show my face in a bad photo, they latch into me hook, line and sinker. Even Entertainment Tonight now has blood on their hands. It's brutal. I wonder what they’ll do with Alec Baldwin now. He was my brother on Knots. They really threw him under a bus (when endlessly publicizing his infamous voice-mail rant against daughter Ireland, then 11, in 2007). He loves that child so much." ...|$|E

The newspaper company and the power plant subsequently suffered by having some of their functions curtailed. The group had planned to kill the governor and the top public prosecutor, but failed.
