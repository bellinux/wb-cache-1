40|$|Three {{important}} current {{areas of}} research in the field of international comparisons are the construction of price indexes at the <b>basic</b> <b>heading</b> level, price indexes at higher levels of aggregation, and the linking of comparisons across regions. We consider recent innovations in each of these areas. These innovations have largely arisen out of ICP 2005, and hence we discuss them in this context. We give particular emphasis to the construction of price indexes at the <b>basic</b> <b>heading</b> level, since we believe it is here that the biggest problems lie. For example, the apparently anomalous results obtained for China and India in ICP 2005 {{can be traced back to}} problems at the <b>basic</b> <b>heading</b> level. We also highlight some inconsistencies in current ICP methodology, and some promising areas for future research that warrant closer scrutiny in the next round of ICP. (JEL...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} a stochastic approach {{based on the}} country-product-dummy (CPD) method for the computation of purchasing power parities (PPPs) in the International Comparison Program. The approach develops estimation strategies {{in conjunction with the}} country-product-dummy method to derive a range of multilateral index number methods for the compilation of PPPs at the <b>basic</b> <b>heading</b> level as well as at higher levels of aggregation. At the <b>basic</b> <b>heading</b> level our approach generates Jevons geometric index, arithmetic and harmonic indexes as well as the Dutot index. At higher levels of aggregation, a weighted stochastic model with alternative stochastic specifications and the method of moments (MOM) are used to derive the Geary-Khamis, Iklé, Rao and other multilateral index number methods employed in international comparisons. Expressions for computing standard errors for PPPs based on these formulae are also derived. Existence of solutions to the estimating equations derived from the weighted method of moments or the maximum weighted likelihood is also discussed. A numerical illustration based on ICP 2005 data is presented...|$|E
40|$|<b>Basic</b> <b>heading</b> (disaggregated) price indexes {{provide the}} {{building}} blocks from which international comparisons are made. Most errors arise at this disaggregated level and hence {{it is here that}} the most pressing research problems can be found. Perhaps the most striking result that emerged from the International Comparisons Program (ICP) results for 2005 was that China came out 40 percent smaller than previously thought. Using the raw price quote data from a sample of nine countries from the Asia-Pacific region we consider the extent to which this result can be explained by either an excessive focus in China on urban areas or on unrepresentative products in the data collection process. More generally, we consider whether the country-product-dummy (CPD) method used to construct the <b>basic</b> <b>heading</b> price indexes could be improved in future rounds of ICP by including representative dummies, correcting for heteroscedasticity and semilogarithmic coefficient bias, or by pooling the estimation of CPD equations across basic headings. We also explore the viability of estimating CPD-type regressions directly from the individual price quotes rathe...|$|E

40|$|A Dissertation {{submitted}} to the Faculty of Science, University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, in fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science, 2012. The {{purpose of this study}} is to investigate if the International Comparison Program (ICP) methodology could be used to examine the different buying power (worth) of the currency on the same products or goods amongst South African provinces. The method will be tested on the Consumer Price Index (CPI) food data collected from January 2006 to December 2006 from the main cities in the provinces. The food basket is obtained via the Income and Expenditure Survey (IES), which is generally updated every 5 years. South Africa (SA) has disparities and differentials in economic indicators such as the CPI, Gross Domestic Product and employment, amongst the provinces which are caused by among other things geographic set-up, urbanisation, inflation rates, and expenditure patterns. We use the monthly data to do an inter-provincial comparison of food prices by deriving annual purchasing power parities (PPPs) for each of the provinces, using the Country Product Dummy (CPD) method recommended as best practice by the World Bank. The CPI data is validated using the SEMPER software developed by the African Development Bank (AfDB). The validated data is examined for variability over the months and between the provinces using Analysis of Variance. Significant price differences are found for various products over the months and between provinces. The validated data was used to compute PPPs at the group and <b>basic</b> <b>heading</b> level. PPPs were investigated for differences in the provinces on grouped level of food products using Analysis of Variance. The reliability of PPPs between provinces is investigated both at grouped and <b>basic</b> <b>heading</b> level of products using the Cronbach-alpha statistic. The results show that there are no significant variations in PPPs across provinces. This could be due to the similar business opportunities or developments in the provinces or due to the aggregation of prices from the individual product (<b>basic</b> <b>heading)</b> to the main product group level. This implies that the cost of the food basket is the same across provinces...|$|E

The study uses dummy variable hedonic and exact/superlative hedonic index number formulations applied to an inter-country context for both bilateral and multilateral comparisons. Unlike conventional methods, such methods are not confined to matched samples comparisons and thus make use of the entire sample. Their application extends to price survey data using checklists on characteristics. The application is to scanner data on about 1 million transactions for television sets over two months in three countries. It is, to the authors’ knowledge, the first such use of scanner data and application of the above hedonic frameworks in this context...|$|E

40|$|A {{challenge}} facing {{the implementation of}} each round of the International Comparison Program (ICP) is to use methodology that is consistent over time; but to also use {{lessons learned from the}} past to improve results from the current round. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to provide an overview of major methodological changes being implemented in the 2011 ICP and their impact on the final results. The most significant change is moving from a list priced by only a few countries in each region to link regional Purchasing Power Parities (PPPs), to a set of global core products priced by every country as part of their regional price collection. Once <b>basic</b> <b>heading</b> PPPs are linked across regions, they will be linked at higher levels of the GDP using a global aggregation rather than the two stage aggregation used in the past. In the 2005 ICP, only a few regions used productivity adjustments for the within region PPPs for government services and no adjustments were made for the linking process; this made it difficult to compare these PPPs and real expenditures between countries in different regions. To a lesser extent, methods to improve PPPs for housing are also being implemented...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{discover}} whether or not the cost of living differs significantly within Portugal. That can be done by calculating regional price indices, usually called purchasing power parities when comparing different countries. We refer to these indices as cost of living indices. The calculation of cost of living indices is done in two steps. Firstly, price indices are computed within each category of goods and services. These categories are usually called basic headings. Secondly, those price indices are aggregated using as weights the expenses in each category. In our study, we present two methods of calculating price indices at the <b>basic</b> <b>heading</b> level: the CPD (Country-Product-Dummy) and the EKS. (Elteto-Koves-Szulc) (United Nations, 1992). Both possess two desirable properties of price indices: transitivity and base invariance. Additionally, the availability of all the prices in each category is not required, preventing the waste of information implied by using only prices of goods and services common to all regions. Concerning the aggregation methods, it is generally accepted that the Ideal Fisher Index is the best to compare two countries (regions). However, there is n...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} two {{procedures for}} calculating Purchasing Power Parities (ppps) at the <b>basic</b> <b>heading</b> level: {{the first one}} suggested by UNSO and the second one used by EUROSTAT For the synthesis of the prices of items, UNSO resorts to the "characteristicity" or "asterisk" approach and proposes the unweighted geometric mean of the ratios {{with at least one}} asterisk, whereas EUROSTAT transforms the above approach into that of "equi-characteristicity" and introduces pseudo Laspeyres and Paasche indexes and finally Fisher forms which in some sense are weighted geometric means. For the purpose of producing a complete and transitive matrix of ppps, both resort to the EKS procedure, or GEKS, as this paper proposes to rename it. As far as the EUROSTAT procedure is concerned, the formulas for pseudo L and P are analyzed (leaving aside the simple geometric mean suggested by UNSO which gives biased results because of the Gerschenkron effect) and it is shown that the ratios of sums are proper L and P indexes which advantage is that of having a simple and reasonable economic meaning. &# 13; As for the GEKS iterative procedure, the paper proves that the minimization over the L and P matrices of parities instead of over the matrix of the Fs leads the process to converge in many more cases - therefore giving complete and transitive matrices - than one would obtain through minimization of the matrix of the Fs, which results in a minor loss of information...|$|E

40|$|Human head {{gestures}} {{convey a}} rich message, containing information deliver for peoples as a communication tool. Nodding, shacking {{are commonly used}} gestures as non-verbal signals to communicate their intent and emotions. However, the majority of head gestures classification systems focused on head nodding and shaking detection. while they ignored other head gestures which have more expressive emotional signals like rest(up and down), turn, tilt, and tilting. In this paper we developed a new model to classify all head gestures (rest, turn, tilt, node, shake, and tilting) from complex head motions. The model methodology based on distinguishing <b>basic</b> <b>head</b> movements (rest, turn, and tilt) and combined movements (nodding, shaking, and tilting). The purpose of this system is to detect and label combined and <b>basic</b> <b>head</b> movements in dynamic video. In addition, this phase of this study looking at developing an affective machine uses head movements to extract complex affective states (this work is underway). The system used 3 D head rotation angles to classify relevant head gestures in-plan and out-plan of view during user interaction with computer. This system used an open source tracker to detect and track head movements. The Three angels that obtained from the tracker (pitch, yaw, and roll), were analyzed and packed into sequences of observation symbols or cues. Observations formed inputs to an all-vs-all discrete Hidden Markov Model (HMM) classifier. Three classifiers were used for each angle.

Occasionally, physicians can make the initial observations of extreme stiffness or poor ability to suckle. The preliminary diagnosis of PVL is often made using imaging technologies. In most hospitals, premature infants are examined with ultrasound soon after birth to check for brain damage.

The study sample comprised 100 subjects of both sex aged 18 to 30 from South Dalmatia and 200 subjects from Middle Croatia. Eight basic craniofacial variables were measured to obtain head, forehead and face indexes. The data indicate that average values of all variables can be used as standard craniofacial parameters for the examined population groups. All the craniofacial variables are considerably higher in men than in women (p < 0. 05).

50|$|The {{electromagnetic}} {{arrangement of}} a tape head is generally similar for all types, though the physical design varies considerably {{depending on the}} application - for example videocassette recorders (VCR) use rotating heads which implement a helical scan, whereas most audio recorders have fixed heads. A head consists of a core of magnetic material arranged into a doughnut shape or toroid, into which a very narrow gap has been let. This gap is filled with a diamagnetic material, such as gold. This forces the magnetic flux out of the gap into the magnetic tape medium more than air would (it also prevents the gap filling with rubbed off material from the tape which would have the reverse effect). The flux thus magnetises the tape at that point. A coil of wire wrapped around the core opposite the gap interfaces to the electrical side of the apparatus; thus either supplying a signal {{in the case of}} recording, or being fed to an amplifier in the case of playback. The <b>basic</b> <b>head</b> design is fully reversible - a variable magnetic field at the gap will induce an electric current in the coil, and an electric current in the coil will induce a magnetic field in the core and hence in the tape drawn across the gap.|$|R
