5|$|Although the Attorney General, William de Grey, {{advised that}} the {{publishers}} should again be prosecuted, Mansfield disagreed, {{saying that if}} they {{failed to respond to}} Junius, he would become <b>bored</b> <b>and</b> stop writing. Mansfield was evidently correct, because other than a letter printed on 5 October 1771, Junius ceased to write at the beginning of 1772.|$|E
5|$|In October 1906, Keynes's Civil Service {{career began}} as a clerk in the India Office.

5|$|Their fur is {{darker than}} other spaniels {{and they have}} no {{undercoat}} like most of the other field type spaniels. Their coats come mostly in solid colours with some occasional markings on the chest. They can make good family dogs and are patient with children, but can require some sort of purpose, be it hunting or agility work in order to prevent them from becoming <b>bored</b> <b>and</b> destructive.|$|E
50|$|There {{are three}} main types of lasers used in laser cutting. The CO2 laser is suited for cutting, <b>boring,</b> <b>and</b> engraving. The {{neodymium}} (Nd) and neodymium yttrium-aluminium-garnet (Nd-YAG) lasers are identical {{in style and}} differ only in application. Nd is used for <b>boring</b> <b>and</b> where high energy but low repetition are required. The Nd-YAG laser is used where very high power is needed <b>and</b> for <b>boring</b> <b>and</b> engraving. Both CO2 and Nd/ Nd-YAG lasers {{can be used for}} welding.|$|R
50|$|It was {{developed}} from the Jabiru 2200 and 3300 aeroengines, but whilst these earlier modular-design engines share the same <b>bore</b> <b>and</b> stroke (97.5mm x 74 mm), the 5100 flat-eight shares only the 97.5mm <b>bore,</b> <b>and</b> the stroke is increased from 74mm to 85mm.|$|R
50|$|Major {{development}} {{changes were}} made to the RC45’s engine, one of the first differences seen is the <b>bore</b> <b>and</b> stroke, which are much different from the RC30’s. The RC45 had a reduced stroke compared to the RC30, the RC30 having used a <b>bore</b> <b>and</b> stroke of 70 mm x 48.6 mm, whereas the RC45 was changed to a more rev-happy <b>bore</b> <b>and</b> stroke combination of 72 mm x 46 mm. This allowed higher engine revolutions than the RC30 whilst maintaining equal pistons speeds.|$|R
5|$|In late 1835, Davis sailed from New Orleans to Havana, Cuba, to {{help restore}} his health. He was {{accompanied}} by James Pemberton, his only slave at that time. Davis observed the Spanish military and sketched fortifications. Although no evidence points to his having any motive beyond general interest, the authorities knew that Davis was a former army officer and warned him to stop his observations. <b>Bored</b> <b>and</b> feeling somewhat better, Davis booked passage on a ship to New York, then continued to Washington, D.C., where he visited his old schoolmate George Wallace Jones. He soon returned with Pemberton to Mississippi.|$|E
5|$|The Parson is {{a feisty}} and {{energetic}} type of Terrier. They can excel in dog {{sports such as}} flyball or agility and require vigorous exercise {{in order to prevent}} them from becoming <b>bored</b> <b>and</b> potentially destructive in the home. They can be suited to live with children but as they have a typical Terrier temperament, they will not tolerate rough handling. The AKC describes them as being single minded, tenacious and courageous when at work, while at home they can be exuberant, playful and affectionate. However, it is unusual for dogs of this breed to be involved in work, such as fox hunting, typical of a small white terrier, as they are more adapted to the show bench.|$|E
5|$|Zappa's {{interest}} in composing and arranging flourished {{in his last}} high-school years. By his final year, he was writing, arranging and conducting avant-garde performance pieces for the school orchestra. He graduated from Antelope Valley High School in 1958, and later acknowledged two of his music teachers on the sleeve of the 1966 album Freak Out! Due to his family's frequent moves, Zappa attended at least six different high schools, and as a student he was often <b>bored</b> <b>and</b> given to distracting {{the rest of the}} class with juvenile antics. In 1959, he attended Chaffey College but left after one semester, and maintained thereafter a disdain for formal education, taking his children out of school at age 15 and refusing to pay for their college.|$|E

5|$|According to {{a report}} of the trip Armstrong later filed with the Hawaiian government, any {{negotiations}} for Indian contract labor had to be done with the British government in London, so no talks were conducted during their time in India. They arrived in Calcutta on May 28 and visited the Alipore Zoological Gardens. Kalākaua spent one day sitting in the Calcutta courthouse to observe India's legal process. Their trip across the British India subcontinent was a sightseeing excursion during their last days before sailing to the Middle East, and they stopped to tour the Ellora Caves prior to reaching Bombay. The King soon tired of the long journey, and was <b>bored</b> <b>and</b> restless by the time they arrived at Bombay, where they remained until the departure of their steamship on June 7. There was more in Bombay to interest him: a shopping trip, the Arab Stallion Stables, the Parsi Towers of Silence, and a visit from businessman Sir Jamsetjee Jejeebhoy.|$|E
5|$|In November, Chaplin {{began working}} with Cherrill again {{in some of the}} Flower Girl's less {{dramatic}} scenes. While waiting for her scenes for several months, Cherrill had become <b>bored</b> <b>and</b> openly complained to Chaplin. During the filming of one scene, Cherrill asked Chaplin if she could leave early so that she could go to a hair appointment. Chaplin fired Virginia Cherrill and replaced her with Georgia Hale, Chaplin's co-star in The Gold Rush. However, Hale's screen tests proved that she was unsuitable for the role. Chaplin also briefly considered sixteen-year-old actress Violet Krauth, but he was talked out of this idea by his collaborators. Chaplin finally re-hired Cherrill to finish City Lights. She demanded and got a raise to $75 per week. Approximately seven minutes of test footage of Hale survives and is included on the DVD release; excerpts were first seen in the documentary Unknown Chaplin along with an unused opening sequence.|$|E
5|$|Moon {{grew up in}} Alperton, {{a suburb}} of Wembley, in Middlesex, and took up the drums during the early 1960s. After playing with a local band, the Beachcombers, he joined the Who in 1964 before they {{recorded}} their first single. Moon remained with the band during their rise to fame, and was quickly recognised for his drumming style, which emphasised tom-toms, cymbal crashes, and drum fills. He occasionally collaborated with other musicians and later appeared in films, but considered playing in the Who his primary occupation and remained {{a member of the}} band until his death. In addition to his talent as a drummer, however, Moon developed a reputation for smashing his kit on stage and destroying hotel rooms on tour. He was fascinated by blowing up toilets with cherry bombs or dynamite, and by destroying television sets. Moon enjoyed touring and socialising, and was <b>bored</b> <b>and</b> restless when the Who were inactive. His 21st birthday party in Flint, Michigan, has been cited as a notorious example of decadent behaviour by rock groups.|$|E

5|$|Producers chose {{boys who}} were {{students}} of Tariq bin Ziad High School. The school was {{holding on to the}} notion of a united Iraq, even as the country was becoming increasingly racially and religiously segregated. Having worked in Iraq in 2003, Winter knew that the Baghdad district Karrada was mixed and integrated with high numbers of Shiites and Christians. She asked her former driver and translator, who had attended the school, if he would contact the principal. Initially the school was suspicious of their intentions, but decided to trust the judgement of Winter's translator. Principal Ra'ad Jawad selected eight boys {{to take part in the}} documentary because he knew they could be discreet about making the documentary, would not get <b>bored,</b> <b>and</b> would remain committed to filming their lives for a year. The producers wanted their cast to include girls, and had found a school and families willing to take part in the documentary, but the then-Minister of Education refused to let them take part. Jawad travelled to London to meet the producers and he was trained to operate the video cameras that the boys were to use. The cameras and tapes were sent into Iraq via the BBC News department, which were then passed onto the school. Jawad and two Iraqi associate producers trained the boys how to use the cameras. Two months into filming, four of the boys dropped out of the project, leaving Hayder Khalid, Anmar Refat, Ali Shadman, and Mohammad Raed. O'Mahoney and Winter never met the boys while the documentary was being produced because it was such a high-risk assignment.|$|E
25|$|Researchers {{surveyed}} 1,520 children, ages 9–10, with {{a four-year}} follow up and discovered {{a positive correlation}} between obesity and low self-esteem in the four-year follow up. They also discovered that decreased self-esteem led to 19% of obese children feeling sad, 48% of them feeling <b>bored,</b> <b>and</b> 21% of them feeling nervous. In comparison, 8% of normal weight children felt sad, 42% of them felt <b>bored,</b> <b>and</b> 12% of them felt nervous.|$|E
