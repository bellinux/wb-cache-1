5|$|Explosive eruptions {{occur when}} magma decompresses as it rises, {{allowing}} dissolved volatiles (dominantly water and carbon dioxide) to exsolve into gas <b>bubbles.</b> As more <b>bubbles</b> nucleate a foam is produced, which decreases {{the density of}} the magma, accelerating it up the conduit. Fragmentation occurs when <b>bubbles</b> occupy ~70-80 vol% of the erupting mixture. When fragmentation occurs, violently expanding <b>bubbles</b> tear the magma apart into fragments which are ejected into the atmosphere where they solidify into ash particles. Fragmentation is a very efficient process of ash formation and is capable of generating very fine ash even without the addition of water.|$|E

5|$|Once microbubbles have formed, {{they can}} grow by either a {{reduction}} in pressure or by diffusion of gas into the gas from its surroundings. In the body, <b>bubbles</b> may be located within tissues or carried along with the bloodstream. The speed of blood flow within a blood vessel {{and the rate of}} delivery of blood to capillaries (perfusion) are the main factors that determine whether dissolved gas is taken up by tissue <b>bubbles</b> or circulation <b>bubbles</b> for bubble growth.|$|E
5|$|The {{arterial}} bubble assumption {{also provides}} {{an explanation for}} the criticality of the initial ascent phase. <b>Bubbles</b> associated with symptoms are not necessarily generated on site. There is a growth process {{at the beginning of the}} ascent that may last for several cycles until the <b>bubbles</b> have reached a critical size when they are either filtered in the lung or stopped at the tissue level. It is postulated that the production of a shower of small arterial <b>bubbles</b> during the first minutes of the initial ascent is a precursor for DCS symptoms.|$|E
5|$|The {{arterial}} bubble {{assumption is}} that the filtering capacity of the lung has a threshold radius {{of the size of}} a red blood cell and that sufficiently small decompression <b>bubbles</b> can pass to the arterial side, especially during the initial phase of ascent. Later in the ascent, <b>bubbles</b> grow to a larger size and remain trapped in the lung. This may explain why conventional Doppler measurements have not detected any <b>bubbles</b> in the arterial circulation.|$|E
30|$|When the <b>Bubble</b> Index is 1, the L 2 -IBI {{processor}} calculates {{the correlation}} coefficient between filtered residual strength and filtered plasma density.

Combining the <b>Bubble</b> Probability and the <b>Bubble</b> Index end users may impose stricter criterion on the correlation between filtered residual strength and filtered plasma density.

40|$|Abstract [...] -The {{phenomena}} of <b>bubble</b> in a two-phase gas liquid system is encountered in many {{industries such as}} nuclear reactor, hydro-station, chemical, pharmaceutical, liquid-piping transportation and petrochemical. As results of bubble/cavitation phenomena such a lack of equipment efficiency, vibration, noise and solid surfaces erosion can occur. There has been no research so far on the Acoustic Emission (AE) energy of <b>bubble</b> burst and its correlation with <b>bubble</b> size.

50|$|This gas {{expansion}} propagates a shock wave. The density {{difference of}} the expanding gas <b>bubble</b> {{from the surrounding}} water causes the <b>bubble</b> to rise toward the surface. Unless the explosion is shallow enough to vent the gas <b>bubble</b> to the atmosphere during its initial expansion, the momentum of water {{moving away from the}} gas <b>bubble</b> will create a gaseous void of lower pressure than the surrounding water. Surrounding water pressure then collapses the gas <b>bubble</b> with inward momentum causing excess pressure within the gas <b>bubble.</b> Re-expansion of the gas <b>bubble</b> then propagates another potentially damaging shock wave.

5|$|Therapeutic {{decompression}} is {{a procedure}} for treating decompression sickness by recompressing the diver, thus reducing bubble size, {{and allowing the}} gas <b>bubbles</b> to re-dissolve, then decompressing slowly enough to avoid further formation or growth of <b>bubbles,</b> or eliminating the inert gases by breathing oxygen under pressure.|$|E

5|$|A second {{scenario}} considers pressure increases during decompression {{that reduce}} bubble diameters. This can allow <b>bubbles</b> {{trapped in the}} lung during a normal decompression to suddenly pass through the capillaries and become responsible for Type II DCS symptoms. This could explain the difference in outcomes of in-water decompression versus surface decompression. Data collected in the North Sea have shown that if the overall incidence rate of the two diving methods is about the same, that surface decompression tends to produce ten times more type II DCS than in-water decompression. It is assumed that when the diver ascends to the surface, <b>bubbles</b> are produced that are trapped by the lung capillaries, and on recompression of the diver in the deck chamber, these <b>bubbles</b> are reduced in diameter and pass to the arterial side, later causing neurological symptoms. The same scenario was proposed for type II DCS recorded after sawtooth diving profiles or multiple repetitive dives.|$|E
