5|$|This pan-Germanic Empire was {{expected}} to assimilate practically all of Germanic Europe into an enormously expanded Reich. Territorially speaking, this encompassed the already-enlarged German Reich itself (consisting of pre-1938 Germany proper, Austria, Bohemia, Moravia, Alsace-Lorraine, Eupen-Malmedy, Memel, Lower Styria, Upper Carniola, Southern Carinthia and German-occupied Poland), the Netherlands, the Flemish part of <b>Belgium,</b> <b>Luxembourg,</b> Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Iceland, at least the German-speaking parts of Switzerland and Liechtenstein.|$|E

The main importing countries are France, <b>Belgium,</b> <b>Luxembourg,</b> and the United States, while the chief exporting nations are Indonesia and China. The annual global trade in the American bullfrog (Rana catesbeiana), mostly farmed in China, varies between 1200 and 2400 tonnes.|$|E

On December 16, 1944, it massed 29 divisions totaling 250,000 men at a weak point in the Allied lines, and during {{the early stages of the}} ensuing Battle of the Bulge, made significant headway towards the Meuse River during the worst winter Europe had seen in years.

5|$|Truman was {{a strong}} {{supporter}} of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), which established a formal peacetime military alliance with Canada and democratic European nations that had not fallen under Soviet control following World War II. The treaty establishing it was widely popular and easily passed the Senate in 1949; Truman appointed General Eisenhower as commander. NATO's goals were to contain Soviet expansion in Europe and to send a clear message to communist leaders that the world's democracies were willing and able to build new security structures in support of democratic ideals. The U.S., Britain, France, Italy, the Netherlands, <b>Belgium,</b> <b>Luxembourg,</b> Norway, Denmark, Portugal, Iceland, and Canada were the original treaty signatories.

5|$|The Ardennes or Ardennais {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} breeds of draft horse, and {{originates}} from the Ardennes area in <b>Belgium,</b> <b>Luxembourg</b> and France. They are heavy-boned with thick legs and are used for draft work. The Ardennes is found in many colors, although black horses are very rare and are not allowed to be registered with the breed registry. Their history reaches back to Ancient Rome, and throughout the years blood from several other breeds has been added to the Ardennes, although only the Belgian breed had any significant impact. The first Ardennes were imported to the United States in the early 20th century, and the first breed registry was established in Europe in 1929. The horses have been used throughout history as war horses, both as cavalry mounts and to draw artillery, and are used today mainly for heavy draft and farm work, meat production and competitive driving events. They have also been used to influence or create several other horse breeds throughout Europe and Asia.|$|E
5|$|The {{changeover}} {{period during}} which the former currencies' notes and coins were exchanged for those of the euro lasted about two months, until 28 February 2002. The official date on which the national currencies ceased to be legal tender varied from member state to member state. The earliest date was in Germany, where the mark officially ceased to be legal tender on 31 December 2001, though the exchange period lasted for two months more. Even after the old currencies ceased to be legal tender, they continued {{to be accepted by}} national central banks for periods ranging from several years to indefinitely (the latter for Austria, Germany, Ireland, Estonia and Latvia in banknotes and coins, and for <b>Belgium,</b> <b>Luxembourg,</b> Slovenia and Slovakia in banknotes only). The earliest coins to become non-convertible were the Portuguese escudos, which ceased to have monetary value after 31 December 2002, although banknotes remain exchangeable until 2022.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to Hitler's actions, two days later, on 3 September, after a British ultimatum to Germany to cease military operations was ignored, Britain and France {{declared war on}} Germany. In the spring of 1940, Germany conquered Denmark and Norway, the Netherlands, <b>Belgium,</b> <b>Luxembourg,</b> and France forcing the French government to sign an armistice after German troops occupied most of the country. The British repelled German air attacks in the Battle of Britain in the same year. In 1941, German troops invaded Yugoslavia, Greece and the Soviet Union. By 1942, Germany and other Axis powers controlled most of continental Europe and North Africa, but following the Soviet Union's victory at the Battle of Stalingrad, the allies' reconquest of North Africa and invasion of Italy in 1943, German forces suffered repeated military defeats. In June 1944, the Western allies landed in France and the Soviets pushed into Eastern Europe. By late 1944, the Western allies had entered Germany despite one final German counter offensive in the Ardennes Forest. Following Hitler's suicide during the Battle of Berlin, German armed forces surrendered on 8 May 1945, ending World War II in Europe. After World War II, {{former members of the}} Nazi regime were tried for war crimes at the Nuremberg trials.|$|E
