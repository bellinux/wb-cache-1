5|$|In 1914, {{the crew}} {{numbered}} 803 officers and enlisted men. The Swiftsures were quite manoeuvrable {{as a result}} of their <b>balanced</b> <b>rudder</b> and a hull form optimized to make the rudder more effective. They were the last British battleships to enter service with bow crests and were also were the last to enter service equipped with ventilation cowls.|$|E
5|$|Steering was {{controlled}} by a single <b>balanced</b> <b>rudder,</b> which gave the ships excellent maneuverability. The rudder was augmented with special steering system on the engine transmissions; they had gears that could drive half of the engines astern and half forward allowed the screws to assist in turning the ship at sharper angles. The ships tended toward lee helm in general conditions, but in heavy wind, they suffered from weather helm. Both vessels also suffered from severe leeway at low speeds, and the effect was especially pronounced for Nürnberg, owing to her larger superstructure.|$|E
5|$|Directional {{stability}} {{was achieved}} by four fixed vanes, two vertical and two horizontal, attached {{at the rear of}} the gas-bag, and by a long vertical vane running along the main axis of the gas-bag from the centre of the elliptical frame to its rear. Horizontal motion was controlled by the movement of a <b>balanced</b> <b>rudder</b> at the rear of an empennage on a long boom, mounted below the gas-bag and aft of the gondola (see lead image). The empennage consisted of vertical and horizontal vanes arranged like the fletching of an arrow, behind which the vertical rudder was mounted. During a refit in 1907 the vertical vanes of the empennage were modified, as is shown in the accompanying illustration.|$|E
50|$|The B-117 had a {{slightly}} tapered tailplane mounted a little above the fuselage and carrying unbalanced elevators. The twin broad-chord <b>balanced</b> <b>rudders</b> were on small fins, mounted close together over the fuselage sides.|$|R
5|$|An {{additional}} {{solution was}} to fit twin <b>balanced</b> <b>rudders</b> behind each inner shaft, {{in contrast to the}} single central rudder used on earlier ships. This greatly increased the effectiveness of the rudder and substantially decreased the turning circle of the Invincibles in comparison to earlier ships of their size.|$|R
50|$|The Caproni Ca.61 and Ca.61a {{were the}} final {{evolution}} of the Caproni Ca.1 bomber of 1914. The Ca.61 retained the twin boom biplane layout, the three engines in push-pull configuration and the approximate dimensions of the 1916 Ca.36, the main Ca.3 type production variant, but had more modern, streamlined structures and <b>balanced</b> <b>rudders.</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{aircraft}} was a conventional unequal-span biplane design with wooden wings, while the fuselage was built using aluminum tubing with steel tie rod bracing. The landing gear was fixed and the tail included a <b>balanced</b> <b>rudder</b> with a rear skid originally, later {{changed to a}} tailwheel.|$|E
25|$|Later in 1941, the LaGG-3 {{appeared}} with new armament options, an internally <b>balanced</b> <b>rudder,</b> retractable ski landing gear for the winter, retractable tailwheel and wing pipes for drop tanks. The result {{was still not}} good enough. Even with the lighter airframe and revised supercharged engine, the LaGG-3 was underpowered.|$|E
25|$|The third Algol {{engine was}} in {{the nose of the}} {{fuselage}}; behind it the cockpit was just ahead of the leading edge. The flat sided fuselage consisted of two parts, bolted together, and contained a cabin for ten passengers with a lavatory and luggage compartment. The tail surfaces were straight edged and conventional, with a <b>balanced</b> <b>rudder.</b>|$|E
50|$|The empennages of the S.55 and S.63 were similar, {{though the}} latter had two {{vertical}} tails rather than three. These were wire-braced and, including <b>balanced</b> <b>rudders,</b> quadrantal in profile, with one attached to each girder. A rectangular tailplane, mounted {{at a high}} incidence, linked the girders and projected beyond them. It carried a semi-elliptical, balanced elevator.|$|R
5000|$|... rudders: two <b>balanced</b> spade <b>rudders</b> (2011-2013 series) with T-type {{horizontal}} stabilizers (2015-2016 series) ...|$|R
25|$|To save weight, {{electric}} welding was used, as was aluminum in the superstructure, {{and a single}} funnel stack. New impulse geared turbine engines, driving four shafts with three-bladed propellers gave {{a top speed of}} , which was better than most contemporary cruiser designs and the Mogami class has twin <b>balanced</b> <b>rudders,</b> rather than the single rudder of previous Japanese cruiser designs.|$|R
25|$|The {{fuselage}} of the AB 1 was flat-sided, with a narrowed but flat topped decking. There was a gunner's {{position in}} the extreme nose fitted with a 7.7mm machine gun on a TO 4 mounting. The fuselage tapered rearwards with the cantilever tailplane, which carried separate elevators, mounted on top. The fin carried a horn <b>balanced</b> <b>rudder</b> which extended {{down to the bottom}} of the fuselage, moving between the elevators.|$|E
25|$|The keel {{consisted}} of wooden beams bound together with iron hoops. In stormy weather, {{holes in the}} prow would partially fill with water when the ship pitched forward, thus lessening the violent turbulence caused by waves. Treasure ships also used floating anchors cast off {{the sides of the}} ship in order to increase stability. The stern had two 2.5 m (8 foot) iron anchors weighing over a thousand pounds each, used for mooring offshore. Like many Chinese anchors, these had four flukes set at a sharp angle against the main shaft. Watertight compartments were also used to add strength to the treasure ships. The ships also had a <b>balanced</b> <b>rudder</b> which could be raised and lowered, creating additional stability like an extra keel. The <b>balanced</b> <b>rudder</b> placed as much of the rudder forward of the stern post as behind it, making such large ships easier to steer. Unlike a typical fuchuan warship, the treasure ships had nine staggered masts and twelve square sails, increasing its speed. Treasure ships also had 24 cast-bronze cannons with a maximum range of 240 to 275 m (800–900feet). However, treasure ships were considered luxury ships rather than warships. As such, they lacked the fuchuan's raised platforms or extended planks used for battle.|$|E
25|$|Like {{the rest}} of the {{fuselage}} the empennage was steel framed and fabric covered. The tailplanes were mounted just below the top of the fuselage, each braced from below with a single strut and carrying a balanced elevator. A curved, deep, <b>balanced</b> <b>rudder,</b> mounted on a small fin and slightly pointed on top, worked in elevator cut-outs. The airliner had a fixed tailwheel undercarriage. The two mainwheels were mounted independently on V-struts from the lower fuselage with near-vertical oleo struts to the wing roots. The mainwheels had brakes and the tailwheel was steerable.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Balanced</b> <b>rudders</b> {{are used}} by both ships and aircraft. Both may {{indicate}} {{a portion of the}} rudder surface ahead of the hinge, placed to lower the control loads needed to turn the rudder. For aircraft the method can also be applied to elevators and ailerons; all three aircraft control surfaces may also be mass balanced, chiefly to avoid aerodynamic flutter.|$|R
50|$|The two deep, oval section tailbooms, {{with the}} outer engines at their forward ends {{on the lower}} wing, were joined to the upper wing via the oblique interplane struts. The booms ran aft to carry the empennage. The Ca.61's biplane {{horizontal}} tail, with constant chord tailplanes and elevators mounted between the fins, formed a stiffening structural box-unit. The <b>balanced</b> <b>rudders</b> were broad and tall.|$|R
25|$|Based on the {{stability}} issues shown by Hatsuharu during her trials, Ariake and Yūgure had been modified for two <b>balanced</b> <b>rudders</b> placed {{directly behind the}} propellers and angled outward 18.5° to reduce the angle of heel when turning. These proved to reduce their speed by one knot and were removed after their trials as superfluous since both ships had been rebuilt to reflect {{the lessons of the}} Tomozuru Incident.|$|R
25|$|The Coccinelle is {{a simple}} wood framed, fabric covered monoplane, with {{shoulder}} mounted wings braced by a single strut each side from the lower fuselage longerons. The wings are essentially rectangular in plan, though with blunted forward tips, and have significant forward sweep. The <b>balanced</b> <b>rudder</b> is almost without a fin, {{though there is a}} shallow, triangular fillet in front of the rudder, which is large, straight edged and extends to the keel. The rectangular tailplane, mounted {{at the top of the}} fuselage, carries full span, rectangular plan elevators with a central cut-out to allow rudder movement.|$|E
25|$|The {{fuselage}} of the 703 {{was entirely}} ply skinned, tapering gently from a blunt {{nose to the}} tail. There, a small, ply skinned fin carried a largely fabric covered, rounded, wide chord, <b>balanced</b> <b>rudder</b> which extended down to the keel. The straight tapered tailplane, also largely fabric covered, was set forward of the fin {{and at the top}} of the fuselage, so the elevators required only a small cut-out for the rudder to move in. The pilot sat upright just ahead of the wing leading edge under a multi-piece canopy which merged into the aft fuselage. The 703 had no landing wheel but just a sprung skid from the nose to behind the cockpit, on the deepest part of the fuselage. It was assisted by a tail bumper.|$|E
25|$|In 1921, the US Army Air Service {{evaluated}} the Fokker D.VIII parasol monoplane, and the D.VII biplane, both fighters {{handed over to}} it after the Armistice with Germany that ended World War I. It placed an order for two examples of a parasol monoplane fighter based {{on the design of}} the D.VIII, but powered by an American-built Hispano-Suiza V-8 engine, for evaluation. These aircraft, designated by Fokker as Fokker F VI, had plywood-covered wooden cantilever wings similar to those in the D.VIII and the contemporary D.X fighters, and a typical Fokker welded steel-tube fuselage. The forward fuselage was protected by armour plates, although the car-type radiator and the wing-mounted fuel tank had no such protection. The aircraft had a fixed tailskid undercarriage, while it had no fixed fin, having a <b>balanced</b> <b>rudder</b> instead.|$|E
50|$|Sharpies are {{a type of}} hard chined {{sailboat}} with a flat bottom, extremely shallow draft, centreboards and straight, flaring sides. They {{are believed}} to have originated in the New Haven, Connecticut region of Long Island Sound, United States. They were traditional fishing boats used for oystering, and later appeared in other areas. With centerboards and shallow <b>balanced</b> <b>rudders</b> they are well suited to sailing in shallow tidal waters.|$|R
2500|$|Earlier Burnelli {{lifting body}} designs had fuselages which were {{rectangular}} in plan, with the empennage directly attached, but the CB-16's fuselage tapered and the tail unit was mounted beyond the lifting body's trailing edge {{on a pair}} of thin panels extending from its sides. The alteration was motivated by the difficulties of pitch and yaw control encountered with the earlier arrangement. [...] The panels swept upwards into a pair of fins and <b>balanced</b> <b>rudders</b> carrying a high set tailplane with three <b>balanced</b> elevators, the <b>rudders</b> working between them. The single wheels of the still novel retracting undercarriage were mounted on V-struts hinged at the lower, outer fuselage, retracting inwards.|$|R
25|$|The {{result was}} a {{completely}} new design. A tractor monoplane became a pusher biplane with large balanced fore-elevators, similar in basic layout to the Wright Flyer, but with a fully covered fuselage. Ailerons were fitted to the top wing, and twin <b>balanced</b> <b>rudders</b> were mounted behind the propeller, but out of its immediate slipstream. The only obvious component of the Bleriot that {{found its way into}} the new design was its 60hp (45kW) E.N.V. Type F engine.|$|R
25|$|The {{aircraft}} was a shoulder-wing monoplane {{powered by a}} 52kW (70hp) Gnome Gamma 7-cylinder rotary engine driving a two bladed propeller. The pilot and passenger were seated in side-by-side configuration: the control column was centrally mounted {{and there were two}} sets of rudder pedals, so that it could be flown from either seat. The shallow section rectangular fuselage tapered to a horizontal knife-edge at the tail, with the elongated triangular horizontal stabiliser mounted in the middle, its covering blending into that of the upper and lower fuselage surface. A semi-elliptical elevator was mounted on the trailing edge, and a triangular <b>balanced</b> <b>rudder</b> was mounted above the rear fuselage. Lateral control was effected by wing-warping, the wires leading to a single inverted V-strut cabane above the fuselage and a similar V strut beneath. Petrol was stored in three tanks: a pair of gravity tanks were located under the top decking in front of the cockpit, pressure-fed from a larger tank under the seats.|$|E
25|$|The Gweduck's {{structure}} is formed from glass and carbon fibre. Its high wings are trapezoidal in plan, fitted with externally balanced ailerons and Fowler flaps. Each wing has a float mounted below it on a single, wide chord strut which rotates through 90° after take-off {{to place the}} float at the wing tip. A pair of 300hp (224kW) Lycoming IO-540 six cylinder horizontally opposed engines are mounted forward of the wing leading edge with their thrust lines above the upper surface. The Gweduck has a single step hull, with the pilots' cabin just forward of the wing leading edge; behind them, the passenger cabin has four windows on each side. Tail surfaces are straight edged, the tailplane trapezoidal and the fin leading edge swept, with a horn <b>balanced</b> <b>rudder</b> and externally mass balanced elevators. On land the Gweduck uses a conventional undercarriage, with mainwheels that retract but remain exposed in the fuselage sides and a tailwheel that retracts behind doors in the extreme rear fuselage.|$|E
500|$|The {{design of}} the Fuji class was derived {{from that of the}} British s, albeit about [...] smaller. The Fuji-class ships {{improved}} on the Royal Sovereigns in several ways; they were about [...] faster, they incorporated superior Harvey armour, and their guns, although smaller and lighter, were the same as those of the later [...] and were protected by armoured hoods (gun turrets). The two ships of the class were almost identical even though they were designed by two different naval architects, Yashima by Philip Watts and Fuji by George C. Mackrow. The primary difference was that Yashima had her deadwood cut away aft and was fitted with a <b>balanced</b> <b>rudder.</b> This made her almost a knot faster than her sister and gave her a smaller turning circle at the cost of a weaker stern that required careful attention when drydocked lest it sag.|$|E
50|$|Instead of four rudder and {{elevator}} fins {{set on the}} airship's empennage, the Zeppelin NT {{uses only}} three identical fins; one fin being set at the top with the others offset at an angle of 120 degrees {{to either side of}} the top fin. This arrangement not only saves weight, but as a side effect, the loss of one fin can be compensated with the remaining two. The aerodynamically <b>balanced</b> <b>rudders</b> are equipped with independent electrical actuators.|$|R

The three ships, Audacious, , and , with <b>balanced</b> <b>rudders</b> were described as unmanageable under sail alone.|$|R
500|$|Rudder, stern-mounted and {{vertical}} axial: Lawrence V. Mott, who defines a steering oar as a rudder, states the ancient Egyptian use of stern-mounted rudders {{can be traced}} back to the 6th dynasty (2350–2200 BC). Mott states that the method of attachment for rudders in the Arab, Chinese, and European worlds differed from each other, leading him to doubt the spread of the Chinese system of attachment by socket-and-jaws or block and tackle (versus European pintle-and-gudgeon invented by c. 1180 AD). In regards to Mott's definition of a steering oar as a rudder, Joseph Needham, Richard Lefebvre des Noëttes, K.S. Tom, Chung Chee Kit, S.A.M. Adshead, Paul Johnstone and Sean McGrail state that a steering oar is not a rudder; the steering oar has the capacity to interfere with handling of the sails (limiting any potential for long ocean-going voyages) while it was fit more for small vessels on narrow, rapid-water transport; the rudder did not disturb the handling of the sails, took less energy to operate by its helmsman, was better fit for larger vessels on ocean-going travel, and first appeared in China. Leo Block writes of the use of the steering oar in the ancient Mediterranean world (specifically in regards to the Phoenicians, 1550–300 BC): [...] "A single sail tends to turn a vessel in an upwind or downwind direction, and rudder action is required to steer a straight course. A steering oar was used at this time because the rudder had not yet been invented. With a single sail, a frequent movement of the steering oar was required to steer a straight course; this slowed down the vessel because a steering oar (or rudder) course correction acts like a break." [...] The oldest depicted rudders at the back of a ship, without the use of oars or a steering oar, comes from several ceramic models of Chinese ships made during both the Western and Eastern eras of the Han Dynasty (202 BC– 220 AD). According to the scholars Zhang Zunyan and Vassilios Christides, there is literary evidence to suggest that the axial stern rudder existed in China since the 1st century BC, while Gang Deng asserts the first reference was made in the Huainanzi of the 2nd century BC, and K.S. Tom says the first clear reference dates to the 5th century AD. However, K.S. Tom points to the fact that all Chinese pottery models of ships before this Guangzhou tomb model show steering oars instead of a rudder, which he states is strong evidence for the rudder's invention only by the 1st century AD. Jacques Gernet states that while the Chinese had invented the rudder in the 1st century AD, it was not completely fixed to the sternpost of Chinese ships until the end of the 4th century. The bulkhead ship design of the junk, which appeared roughly the same time as the rudder, provided the essential vertical components for the hinged axial rudder. Deng points out that an Eastern Han (25–220) model distinctly shows a rudder located in its own separate cabin, suggesting that helmsmanship had already become an established profession. Following the invention of the <b>balanced</b> <b>rudder</b> pivoted on an axis, Tom and Deng state that the Chinese then innovated the fenestrated rudder by the Song Dynasty (960–1279), with deliberate puncturing and boring out of holes in shapes such as diamonds, which, according to Tom, made the rudder [...] "easier to steer, reduced turbulence drag, did not affect efficiency and was hydrodynamically sound." ...|$|E
2500|$|... 7D1 - initial {{prototype}} with comma-style <b>balanced</b> <b>rudder,</b> wide-chord I-struts, and upper wing supported by pylon faired into engine cowling. The entire fuselage was skinned in plywood. The radiator was {{mounted in the}} upper wing, set off the port side of the supporting pylon.|$|E
2500|$|After testing during May and June 1912 the fins were removed, and an {{enlarged}} aerodynamically <b>balanced</b> <b>rudder</b> fitted. The aircraft {{was sold to}} the Deutsche Bristol Werke.
