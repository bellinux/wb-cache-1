40|$|Background After {{traumatic}} brain injury (TBI), the ability of cerebral vessels to appropriately react to changes in arterial blood pressure (pressure reactivity) is impaired, leaving patients vulnerable to cerebral hypo- or hyper-perfusion. Although, the traditional <b>pressure</b> reactivity <b>index</b> (PRx) has demonstrated that impaired pressure reactivity associates with poor patient outcome, PRx is sometimes erratic {{and may not be}} reliable in various clinical circumstances. Here, we introduce a more robust wavelet transform <b>based</b> <b>pressure</b> reactivity <b>index</b> (wPRx) and compare its performance with the widely used traditional PRx across three areas: its stability and reliability in time, its ability to give an optimal cerebral perfusion pressure (CPPopt) recommendation and its relationship with patient outcome. Methods and Findings 515 TBI patients admitted in Addenbrooke’s Hospital, UK (March 23 rd, 2003 - December 9 th, 2014), with continuous monitoring of arterial blood pressure (ABP) and intracranial pressure (ICP) were retrospectively analyzed to calculate the traditional PRx and a novel wavelet transform based wPRx. wPRx was calculated by taking the cosine of the wavelet transform phase-shift between ABP and ICP. A time trend of CPPopt was calculated using an automated curve fitting method that determined the CPP at which the pressure reactivity (PRx or wPRx) was most efficient (CPPopt_PRx and CPPopt_wPRx, respectively). There was a significantly positive relationship between PRx and wPRx (r = 0. 73) and wavelet wPRx was more reliable in time (ratio of between-hour variance to total variance, wPRx 0. 957 ± 0. 0032 vs PRx and 0. 949 ± 0. 047 for PRx, p= 0. 002). The 2 -hour interval standard deviation of wPRx (0. 19 ± 0. 07) was smaller than that of PRx (0. 30 ± 0. 13, p< 0. 001). wPRx performed better in distinguishing between mortality and survival (AUROC for wPRx was 0. 73 vs 0. 66 for PRx, p = 0. 003). The mean difference between the patients’ CPP and their CPPopt was related to outcome for both calculation methods. There was a good relationship between the two CPPopts (r= 0. 814, p< 0. 001). CPPopt_wPRx was more stable than CPPopt_PRx (within patient standard deviation 7. 05 ± 3. 78 vs 8. 45 ± 2. 90; p< 0. 001). Key limitations include that this study is a retrospective analysis and only compared wPRx with PRx in the cohort of TBI patients. Prospective validation is required prior to better assess clinical utility of this approach. Conclusions Wavelet <b>based</b> <b>pressure</b> reactivity <b>index</b> (wPRx) offers several advantages to the traditional PRx: it is more stable in time, it yields a more consistent optimal CPP recommendation, and importantly, it has a stronger relationship with patient outcome. The clinical utility of wPRx should be explored in prospective studies of critically injured neurological patients...|$|R
40|$|Paute-Cardenillo (owned by Celec Ep-Hidropaute) is a dam with {{maximum height}} 135 m {{located in the}} Paute River in Ecuador. Its {{hydroelectric}} production will be integrated at the National Electric System of Ecuador with an installed capacity of 600 MW which will produce 3300 GWh per year. To evaluate the stability and safety of the structure, {{it is necessary to}} ascertain the shape and dimensions of the scour generated downstream from the dam. We studied the scour, due to the operation of the free surface spillway (700 m 3 /s) and half-height outlets (1760 m 3 /s), with three complementary procedures: empirical formulae obtained in models and prototypes, semi-empirical methodology <b>based</b> on <b>pressure</b> fluctuations-erodibility <b>index</b> and computational fluid dynamics simulations. The free surface weir could generate a scour around 21 m, while the intermediate outlet could reach the intact rock, located 34 m below the initial river bed. A pre-excavated basin is proposed and the velocities and pressures are analyzed. The results demonstrated the suitability of combining different methodologies to achieve an adequate resolution of this complex phenomenon...|$|R

40|$|Background: Peripheral {{arterial}} {{disease is}} an atherosclerotic disease {{characterized by an}} increase in morbidity and mortality. For these reasons early diagnosis of peripheral arterial disease is important. Ankle-brachial systolic <b>pressure</b> <b>index</b> measurement is frequently used in screening studies. Evaluating waveforms of distal lower extremities with Doppler ultrasound {{can be used as a}} screening program and provides more accurate information on peripheral arterial disease. Aim: We investigate the prevalence of peripheral arterial disease, compare the efficacy of Doppler ultrasound evaluation of distal lower extremity waveforms and ankle-brachial systolic <b>pressure</b> <b>index</b> measurement in screening programs, and discuss the importance of early diagnosis of asymptomatic cases. Material and methods: A total of 457 patients over the age of 65 (between 65 and 94, mean age: 71. 4) including 270 males and 187 females were examined with Doppler ultrasound, had ankle-brachial systolic <b>pressure</b> <b>index</b> measurement taken and were screened for peripheral arterial disease. The correlation between Doppler ultrasound findings and ankle-brachial systolic <b>pressure</b> <b>index</b> was examined. Results: According to the Doppler ultrasound findings, in the aortoiliac (r = 0. 648) and femoropopliteal (r = 0. 564) area, there is a medium level of correlation between severe stenosis and occlusions and a low ankle-brachial systolic <b>pressure</b> <b>index</b> value, and a low level of correlation between such abnormalities in the tibioperoneal region (r = 0. 116) and a low ankle-brachial systolic <b>pressure</b> <b>index</b> value. Therefore, while the sensitivity of ankle-brachial systolic <b>pressure</b> <b>index</b> increases in proximal stenosis, it decreases in distal stenosis. Conclusion: Despite the fact that ankle-brachial systolic <b>pressure</b> <b>index</b> is a diagnostic test commonly used in screening studies, evaluation of distal arteries by means of Doppler ultrasound provides more accurate information in terms of the identification of peripheral arterial disease...|$|R

40|$|The {{swelling}} pressure of soil depends upon various soil parameters such as mineralogy, clay content, Atterberg's limits, dry density, moisture content, initial degree of saturation, etc. along with structural and environmental factors. It {{is very difficult}} to model and analyze {{swelling pressure}} effectively taking all the above aspects into consideration. Various statistical/empirical methods have been attempted to predict the swelling <b>pressure</b> <b>based</b> on <b>index</b> properties of soil. In this paper, the computational intelligence techniques artificial neural network and support vector machine have been used to develop models based on the set of available experimental results to predict swelling pressure from the inputs; natural moisture content, dry density, liquid limit, plasticity index, and clay fraction. The generalization of the model to new set of data other than the training set of data is discussed which is required for successful application of a model.

40|$|Background: Anthropometric {{measures}} {{are used as}} indicators of elevated blood pressure, but reported to have variable sensitivity among populations. This study was undertaken to identify the better indicator of Cardiac-risk factors by statistical comparison of BMI, Waist circumference, and Waist to Height (WtHr) ratio in apparently healthy adolescents and young adult female students of Tripura. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional {{study was conducted in}} a resource limited setup on 210 apparently healthy female adolescents and young adult students in Tripura. Mean (±SD) of all parameters were compared (ANOVA) to recognize significant independent (anthropometric measures) and dependent factors (blood <b>pressure</b> <b>indices</b> and so on). Correlation (r) analysis was used to identify the better (p) indicator of blood <b>pressure</b> <b>indices</b> (dependent variable) and its impact was assessed by Multiple Regression analysis. Results: blood <b>pressure</b> <b>indices</b> are comparatively higher in obese and overweight participants with statistically significant (95. 5 % confidence) mean differences. Significant correlation with dependent factors is observed with BMI followed by WtHr and Waist Circumference. Impact of anthropometric measures with blood <b>pressure</b> <b>Indices</b> is most significant for BMI (P ≤ 0. 020) followed by WtHr (P ≤ 0. 500) and waist circumference (P ≤ 0. 520).

40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} which metabolic and cardiovascular risk factors {{are associated with}} the change in ankle brachial <b>pressure</b> <b>index</b> and incident peripheral arterial disease over 9 years, and whether these associations differ between healthy weight and overweight & obese individuals. Methods: Metabolic factors, change in ankle brachial <b>pressure</b> <b>index</b> and incidence of peripheral arterial disease (ankle brachial <b>pressure</b> <b>index</b> < 0. 90) over 9 -years were determined in 2139 healthy weight and 1453 overweight & obese participants from the D. E. S. I. R. study. Results: Fasting glucose, insulin, HDL-cholesterol, systolic blood pressure and pulse pressure were all directly associated with the incidence of peripheral arterial disease, however BMI and the metabolic syndrome were not. There was some evidence that the associations of fasting insulin (Pheterogeneity = 0. 06), insulin resistance (Pheterogeneity = 0. 08) and ˇ-cell function (Pheterogeneity = 0. 004) with change in ankle brachial <b>pressure</b> <b>index,</b> differed between healthy weight and overweight & obese subjects. Principal components analysis identified a classical metabolic syndrome cluster, and an alternative clustering of metabolic factors that was characterised by high pulse pressure, high HDL-cholesterol and low triglycerides. This alternative cluster of cardiovascular and metabolic risk factors was associated with reductions in ankle brachial <b>pressure</b> <b>index</b> and an increased incidence of peripheral arterial disease (both P < 0. 0001). Conclusions: Overweight & obesity do not increase the risk of developing peripheral arterial disease. We identified an alternative cluster of metabolic factors that is strongly associated wi...|$|R
40|$|Obesity and {{hypertension}} are {{two major}} inter-related cardiovascular risk factors. Decrease in adiposity {{is one of the}} most effective preventive measures not only in decreasing the overall cardiovascular risk but also the blood pressure. This cross-sectional study measured the effect of various measures of adiposity on blood pressure in normal healthy subjects of Pakistani origin. 400 normotensive subjects (247 males and 153 females) were included in this study. Along with data on co-morbid conditions, two blood pressure readings and several anthropometric measurements were recorded. Age and gender specific analysis was done. Following the WHO cutoffs for Asians, about 52 % of our sample population was found to be overweight or obese. Age was not associated with blood <b>pressure</b> <b>indices</b> in males, however it was strongly associated with all blood <b>pressure</b> <b>indices</b> in females. Greater Body Mass Index (BMI), Waist Circumference (WC) and Waist to Height Ratio (WHTR) were associated with higher Systolic and Diastolic Blood pressure. Increasing age was also associated with higher levels of BMI, WC and WHTR. Anthropometric variables however, were more strongly associated with blood <b>pressure</b> <b>indices</b> than age in this sample population.

40|$|The {{effect on}} the <b>base</b> <b>pressure</b> of a thin slit located at the base edge of a blunt {{axisymmetric}} body, communicating an internal cavity with the external flow, is investigated. A parametric study is performed of the effect on <b>base</b> <b>pressure</b> of changes in slit size and cavity depth. The <b>base</b> <b>pressure</b> increases initially with increasing cavity depth, but saturates at a depth which depends on the slit size. The <b>base</b> <b>pressure</b> increases monotonically up to 5 % with increasing slit size for the geometries tested. An upper limit of <b>base</b> <b>pressure</b> recovery of 20 % is extrapolated from the data. It is observed that {{the main effect of}} the slit is to reduce the instantaneous pressure asymmetry, which is linked to the total <b>base</b> <b>pressure</b> in a similar fashion for all the slit sizes. As a second-order effect, for highly asymmetric pressure distributions, the slit produces a <b>base</b> <b>pressure</b> increase not associated with the <b>base</b> <b>pressure</b> asymmetry. The results suggest a global effect of the slit on the wake due to a diametrical flow within the cavity driven by the pressure differences across the slit and regulated by the largest of the pressure drops between the slit and cavity. The slit also reduces the periodic <b>base</b> <b>pressure</b> fluctuations, corresponding mainly to the vortex shedding, and increases the rotational speed of the wake...|$|R
40|$|ObjectivePeripheral {{arterial}} occlusive {{disease and}} peripheral neuropathy are major risk factors in diabetic foot disease. We evaluated the relative influences of noncritical lower limb arterial disease and peripheral neuropathy on cutaneous foot perfusion in diabetes. MethodToe-brachial <b>pressure</b> <b>indices,</b> transcutaneous oxygen, {{and carbon dioxide}} tensions at foot and chest sites were measured in individuals with diabetes, with or without detectable peripheral neuropathy and with or without significant arterial disease on color duplex imaging. Subjects without diabetes, with and without arterial disease, were used as controls. ResultsA total of 130 limbs were studied during an 8 -month period. Toe-brachial <b>pressure</b> <b>indices</b> reflected the presence of arterial disease in all groups. Foot transcutaneous oxygen values were reduced in diabetes and correlated with chest transcutaneous oxygen values. Low foot transcutaneous oxygen with elevated transcutaneous carbon dioxide values were only demonstrated in individuals with diabetes, arterial disease, and peripheral neuropathy. Toe-brachial <b>pressure</b> <b>indices</b> demonstrated a positive correlation with foot transcutaneous oxygen values, but values > 1. 2 demonstrated a negative correlation. ConclusionsWe demonstrated two influences on cutaneous foot perfusion in diabetes: (1) a global microcirculatory dysfunction, reflected in low chest and foot transcutaneous oxygen values, and (2) macrovascular disease as indicated by reduced toe-brachial <b>pressure</b> <b>indices</b> and foot transcutaneous oxygen values. Further, the results demonstrated that in diabetic individuals without critical limb ischemia, impaired foot perfusion secondary to arterial disease is amplified significantly by coexisting microcirculatory disease...|$|R

Research design and methodsPopulation-based cohort of 68 -year-old men (n= 474). Diabetes was defined as history of diabetes or a fasting blood glucose ≥ 6. 1 mmol/l. PAD was defined as an ankle–brachial <b>pressure</b> <b>index</b> (ABI) < 0. 9 in either leg. Fourteen-year mortality and cardiac event rates were based on record linkage with regional and national registers. ResultsThe prevalence of PAD in men with and without diabetes was 29 and 12 %, respectively (p= 0. 003). The incidence of cardiac events was 22. 9 / 1000 person years in men free from both diabetes and PAD. In {{the absence of an}} abnormal <b>pressure</b> <b>index,</b> diabetes was associated with an event rate of 28. 4 (p= 0. 469). In the presence of an abnormal index the incidence was 102 (p< 0. 001). This pattern remained in the multivariate analysis when other atherosclerotic risk factors were taken into account. Cardiovascular mortality rates similarly differed substantially between diabetic men with and without PAD. ConclusionsA fasting blood glucose value above 6. 1 mmol/l {{even in the absence of}} symptoms indicating diabetes was associated by an increased prevalence of asymptomatic PAD.

40|$|The {{results of}} femoropopliteal bypass to the infragenicular popliteal artery, {{in the absence}} of {{suitable}} saphenous vein have, in the main, been disappointing. We present a new type of composite graft, for use when the distal anastomosis is below the knee, which avoids the potential problems of prosthetic graft alone. The graft consists of a proximal segment of 6 mm expanded PTFE (Gore-Tex; or Impra), anastomosed to transposed non-reversed autologous saphenous vein. Forty-two patients were studied following unilateral, below knee composite femoropopliteal graft surgery for severe claudication or critical ischaemia. <b>Pressure</b> <b>indices</b> were calculated along with intraoperative flow rate, and all patients were followed up at regular intervals to assess graft patency. During the study period three patients died and graft occlusion occurred in a further eight. Analysis of the cumulative patency curve revealed that the majority of occlusions occurred in the first 3 months. The patency at 12 and 18 months was encouraging with values of 84 % and 79 % respectively. Comparison of <b>pressure</b> <b>indices</b> revealed a significant increase following surgery (P less than 0. 001). The postoperative <b>pressure</b> <b>index</b> appeared to predict the grafts likely to occlude and the intraoperative flow rates mirrored a similar trend.

The role of oxidized low-density lipoprotein in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis has already been investigated.

40|$|Pure {{aluminum}} (Al) {{thin films}} were sputter deposited {{under conditions of}} variable <b>base</b> <b>pressure</b> of the deposition tool. The {{purpose of the study}} was to identify if the <b>base</b> <b>pressure</b> had a key influence on the electrochemical properties, namely corrosion resistance, of the Al deposits. The corrosion resistance was found to increase with increasingly high <b>base</b> <b>pressure</b> (i. e. lower quality vacuum). Potentiodynamic polarization experiments, pit growth studies, TEM and XPS were employed. From the results is posited that improved corrosion resistance is due to the presence of oxygen (O) being incorporated into the films during deposition resulting an O-containing (i. e. Al-O) alloy.

The thin films were obtained at room temperature on glass substrates by direct-current (DC) magnetron sputtering with a power of 120 W (corresponding to a power density of 2. 63 W/cm 2) and a total deposition pressure of 4. 0 mTorr (0. 53 Pa) with only argon gas.

Among the <b>base</b> <b>pressures</b> studied, the lower <b>base</b> <b>pressure</b> zone [best vacuum level: under ~ 5. 7 × 10 - 7 Torr (~ 7. 6 × 10 - 5 Pa); dark yellow zone] produced dark yellow AZO thin films with moderate transmittance, but the highest resistivity and the worst stability to the environment. The middle <b>base</b> <b>pressure</b> zone [~ 5. 7 × 10 - 7 Torr (~ 7. 6 × 10 - 5 Pa) to ~ 7. 3 × 10 - 7 Torr (~ 9. 7 × 10 - 5 Pa); opaque zone] produced dark gray or brown AZO thin films with good conductivity, but that exhibited the worst transmittance. The higher <b>base</b> <b>pressure</b> zone [bad vacuum level: higher than ~ 7. 3 × 10 - 7 Torr (~ 9. 7 × 10 - 5 Pa); transparent zone] produced highly transparent AZO thin films with moderate resistivity.

40|$|A {{prospective}} study was undertaken {{to evaluate the}} clinical and hemodynamic effects of aortofemoral Dacron reconstruction in patients with multilevel disease (i. e. aortoiliac and femoropopliteal occlusive disease). Thirty nine patients underwent, apart from clinical evaluation, segmental plethysmography and Doppler pressures before operation, immediately after operation and again at 3 and 6 months. All patients improved by the reconstruction, but 12 (31 %) continued to complain of disabling claudication during normal daily activities. The mean ankle pressure and thigh <b>pressure</b> <b>index</b> improved by 37. 5 %. This {{was accompanied by a}} decrease of peak flow time, an increase of peak flow and an improved recovery during reactive hyperemia. Furthermore an additional significant rise of the ankle <b>pressure</b> <b>index</b> was noted between 3 and 6 months. Continuing claudication was always associated with both initial and late hemodynamic failure (the criterium for hemodynamic success was defined as an increase of the ankle <b>pressure</b> <b>index</b> with more than 0. 1). Hemodynamic success resulted unvariably in clinical success. However 4 patients were clinically symptomfree, although they had to be classified as hemodynamic failures. It is concluded that a significant number of patients fail to obtain complete relief after proximal reconstruction. Preoperative hemodynamic studies may provide additional information, but hemodynamic and clinical results do not always correlate with each other. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|AbstractOBJECTIVESWe {{sought to}} compare {{standard}} lower extremity vascular laboratory treadmill exercise with the office-based active pedal plantarflexion technique. BACKGROUNDIntermittent claudication is relatively common in elderly patients {{and is an}} important predictor of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Noninvasive testing using resting and posttreadmill exercise ankle:brachial systolic blood <b>pressure</b> <b>indices</b> is often required to confirm the diagnosis and objectively assess the severity of lower extremity arterial occlusive disease. This is traditionally performed in a formal vascular laboratory setting. METHODSFifty consecutive patients (100 lower extremities) with known or suspected intermittent claudication referred for lower extremity treadmill exercise testing were also tested with active pedal plantarflexion using a prospective, randomized crossover design. Supine ankle:brachial systolic blood <b>pressure</b> <b>indices</b> were measured immediately before and after each form of exercise. RESULTSThere was an excellent correlation (r = 0. 95, 95 % confidence interval 0. 93 to 0. 97) between mean postexercise ankle:brachial systolic blood <b>pressure</b> <b>indices</b> for treadmill exercise and active pedal plantarflexion. There {{was no significant difference}} in outcome based on the order of testing or the severity of arterial occlusive disease. Symptoms of angina or dyspnea occurred in 11 patients (22 %) with treadmill exercise versus zero patients with active pedal plantarflexion. CONCLUSIONSActive pedal plantarflexion is an office-based test that compares favorably with treadmill exercise for the noninvasive, safe, objective and economical assessment of lower extremity arterial occlusive disease...|$|R
40|$|Based on the {{introduction}} of the general situation of research region, <b>pressure</b> <b>index</b> model of cultivated land is adopted according to the data of population, cultivated land area, crop sowing area, grain sowing area, and unit grain yield in the Statistical Yearbook of Fengxian County. The change of relevant factors of cultivated land <b>pressure</b> <b>index</b> over time is analyzed, as well as the tension level of cultivated land resources. Research shows that the pressure on cultivated land is relatively great in Fengxian County in the years 1999 - 2005. Grain supply and demand is still under the unsafe state. There will be more prominent contradiction between supply and demand of cultivated land in Fengxian County in the future, and the grain security will under greater pressure. Several countermeasures are put forward to ease the pressure on cultivated land in Fengxian County, in order to realize the sustainable use of cultivated land resources, to ensure the supply and demand balance of grain and cultivated land, and to stabilize and improve the grain productivity in Fengxian County, such as protecting the current cultivated land resources by the strictest protection system of cultivated land, enhancing the intensity of land development and reclamation, enlarging the area of cultivated land, increasing the agricultural sci-tech input, and improving the grain unit yield. <b>Pressure</b> <b>index</b> of cultivated land, Land use, Sustainable development, Fengxian, China, Agribusiness,...|$|R

We performed the peripheral arterial tonometry test in 22 patients with Buerger disease. We recorded the patients’ characteristics, including ankle brachial <b>pressure</b> <b>index</b> and reactive hyperemia index, which reflect the endothelial dysfunction. We divided the patients with Buerger disease into the conservative treatment and lumbar sympathectomy group. While the reactive hyperemia index was not significantly different between these two groups, the ankle brachial <b>pressure</b> <b>index</b> was significantly different (1. 12 versus 0. 83, P= 0. 003). Furthermore, the reactive hyperemia index was significantly correlated with the ankle brachial <b>pressure</b> <b>index</b> value in the patients in the lumbar sympathectomy group (ρ= 0. 848, P= 0. 005). Given that patients with Buerger disease show impairment of the sympathetic nervous system, we should consider the after-effects of such an impaired system {{on the condition of}} these patients. The patients treated with lumbar sympathectomy might be more appropriate to evaluate their endothelial function by a peripheral arterial tonometry test.
