The bilayer thickness, surface charge, intermolecular forces, amphiphilic molecules, changes in free energy, alternating or spontaneous curvatures, increase or decrease in temperature, solvents, and the environment are all examples of different conditions that cause changes in biomembranes. For example, the strength of the intermolecular forces within the <b>biomembrane</b> are fairly strong but when lipids are extracted from biomembranes for analytical purposes there is a decrease in the constraints by the intermolecular forces against the phospholipids which may cause the lipid to undergo polymorphism as well as a temporary rearrangement of other lipids or proteins in the <b>biomembrane.</b> The thickness of the <b>biomembrane</b> determines the permeability of the membrane and ethanol, which {{can be used as a}} solvent, is able to reduce the thickness of the <b>biomembrane</b> which is one way this amphiphilic molecule is able to permeate through the <b>biomembrane.</b> There can also be free energy changes that can increase or decrease during the phase transitions of the phospholipids during polymorphism or mesmorphism which can also affect the curvature of lipids. All lipids can experience some sort of positive or negative alternating or spontaneous curvature due to variations in sizes between the hydrophobic and the hydrophilic region.

Ethanol has been recognized as being an excellent solvent in an aqueous solution for inducing non-lamellar phases in phospholipids. The formation of non-lamellar phases in phospholipids is not completely understood, but it is significant that this amphiphilic molecule is capable of doing so. The formation of non-lamellar phases is significant in biomedical studies which include drug delivery, the transport of polar and non-polar ions using solvents capable of penetrating the <b>biomembrane,</b> increasing the elasticity of the <b>biomembrane</b> when it is being disrupted by unwanted substances (viruses, bacteria, solvents, etc.) and functioning as a channel or transporter of biomaterial.|$|E
25|$|Rubber {{particles}} are {{formed in the}} cytoplasm of specialized latex-producing cells called laticifers within rubber plants. Rubber {{particles are}} surrounded by a single phospholipid membrane with hydrophobic tails pointed inward. The membrane allows biosynthetic proteins to be sequestered at {{the surface of the}} growing rubber particle, which allows new monomeric units to be added from outside the <b>biomembrane,</b> but within the lacticifer. The rubber particle is an enzymatically active entity that contains three layers of material, the rubber particle, a <b>biomembrane</b> and free monomeric units. The <b>biomembrane</b> is held tightly to the rubber core due to the high negative charge along the double bonds of the rubber polymer backbone. Free monomeric units and conjugated proteins make up the outer layer. The rubber precursor is isopentenyl pyrophosphate (an allylic compound), which elongates by Mg2+-dependent condensation by the action of rubber transferase. The monomer adds to the pyrophosphate end of the growing polymer. The process displaces the terminal high-energy pyrophosphate. The reaction produces a cis polymer. The initiation step is catalyzed by prenyltransferase, which converts three monomers of isopentenyl pyrophosphate into farnesyl pyrophosphate. The farnesyl pyrophosphate can bind to rubber transferase to elongate a new rubber polymer.|$|E

25|$|There {{are various}} usages of ethanol which include an {{additive}} to gasoline, a primary ingredient for food preservation {{as well as}} alcoholic beverages and being used for transdermal drug delivery. For example, it can function as an antiseptic in topical creams to kill bacteria by denaturing proteins. Ethanol is an amphiphilic molecule meaning that it has chemical and physical properties associated with hydrophobic and hydrophilic molecules. Although, studies show that when penetrating through the <b>biomembrane</b> its hydrophobic abilities appear to be limited based on its preference to bind closely to the hydrophilic region of the phospholipids. There are various issues presented in regards to ethanol's ability to penetrate through the <b>biomembrane</b> and cause a reorganization of the phospholipids towards non-lamellar phases. The issues are as followed: 1) how the alteration of the phospholipids' phase occurs 2) understanding the significance of ethanol's interaction with membrane proteins and membrane phospholipids 3) understanding the permeability of the <b>biomembrane</b> based on the tolerance and adaptation level {{in the presence of}} ethanol although this process appears to be concentration dependent 4) determining the significance of ethanol's amphiphilic character as it relates to its ability to partition throughout the membrane by increasing the fluidity of it. Ethanol's hydrophobic properties are limited and primarily binds close the hydrophilic region of the phospholipid. This bonds creates a strong hydrogen bonds and leads to a strong interlocking amongst the acyl chains 5) why the presence of cholesterol; a sterol compound, inhibits ethanol's ability to disrupt the membrane and 6) deriving the molecular level mechanism of the entire process.|$|E

2500|$|Biological {{membranes}} {{are found}} in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. They surround cells and organelles with a semi-permeable barrier that prevents free flow of substances. The membrane consists of a phospholipid bilayer structure and often embedded or otherwise associated proteins, along with cholesterol and glycolipids. The phospholipid bilayer is a two-layer structure mainly composed of phospholipids, which are amphiphilic molecules that have hydrophilic and hydrophobic regions. The hydrophilic region contains the polar head group. This region is exposed to aqueous substances located mainly in the exterior portion of the <b>biomembrane.</b> The hydrophilic region consists of the non-polar acyl chains or fatty acids groups facing {{the interior of the}} <b>biomembrane.</b> Phospholipids consist of two non-polar hydrocarbon chains with ester or ether bonds to the phosphate group which is also linked by ester or ether bonds to the polar hydrophilic region. The phospholipid carries a negative charge due to the presence of the phosphate group.

2500|$|When lipids are {{extracted}} or {{isolated from}} biomembranes, Polymorphism and mesomorphism can occur {{because they are}} then no longer under the intermolecular constraints that are present within the <b>biomembrane.</b> This can lead to formation of non-lamellar (non-bilayer) or lamellar phases in phospholipids. [...] "Polymorphism" [...] refers to formation of diverse structures such as three-dimensional tubes, rods, and structures with cubic symmetry. Mesomorphism refers to phase transitions when heat is applied. For example, a lipid {{can be in the}} lamellar phase at a lower temperature, but as the temperature increases it transitions into a non-lamellar phase. It is important to consider the size of the hydrophilic region versus the hydrophobic region. For example, if the hydrophilic region and hydrophobic region are similar, a cylindrical shape lipid bilayer is formed; but when the hydrophilic regions is smaller than the hydrophobic region a cone shaped lipid bilayer is formed. Another example is the formation of micelles which has a non-lamellar formation in which the hydrophilic region is significantly larger compared to the hydrophobic region. There are various liquid-crystalline phases that can exist in lipids. Liquid-crystalline phases are when the hydrophobic chain regions are not motionless but are allowed to move about freely in a fluid-like melted state. The lamellar phase (Lα) is the most common and dominant phase in lipids and are aligned as stacks of bilayers on top of bilayers oriented in one single direction.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In this review, {{we report}} on the {{organization}} of lipid molecules forming <b>biomembranes.</b> More precisely, the question is how these amphiphiles phase separate under a change of a suitable parameter, like temperature, pressure or membrane environment. The mixture may undergo a lateral or transversal phase separations. This essentially depends on two principal factors, which are the structure (length) of hydrocarbon chains of lipid molecules and the curvature asymmetry of membranes. When the former dominates, a lateral separation is then expected. In contrary, for those <b>biomembranes</b> of high curvature asymmetry, a vertical separation is rather observed. We examine the problem from a static (phase diagrams) and kinetics (relaxation in time) point of view. Finally, the discussion is also extended to the phase separation between lipid molecules and cholesterol in <b>biomembranes</b> (formation of rafts), between phospholipids and grafted polymers on liposomes, or between surfactant and its co-surfactant in bilayer systems...|$|R
