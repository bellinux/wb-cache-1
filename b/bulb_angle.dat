40|$|Objective—To {{determine}} {{the effect of}} head conformation (brachycephalic, mesaticephalic, and dolichocephalic) on olfactory <b>bulb</b> <b>angle</b> and orientation in dogs by use of in vivo MRI. Animals— 40 client-owned dogs undergoing MRI for diagnosis of conditions that did not affect skull conformation or olfactory bulb anatomy. Procedures—For each dog, 2 head conformation indices were calculated. Olfactory <b>bulb</b> <b>angle</b> and an index of olfactory bulb orientation relative {{to the rest of the}} CNS were determined by use of measurements obtained from sagittal T 2 -weighted MRI images. Results—A significant negative correlation was found between olfactory <b>bulb</b> <b>angle</b> and values of both head conformation indices. Ventral orientation of olfactory bulbs was significantly correlated with high head conformation index values (ie, brachycephalic head conformation). Conclusions and Clinical Relevance—Low olfactory bulb angles and ventral olfactory bulb orientations were associated with brachycephalia. Positioning of the olfactory bulbs, cribriform plate, and ethmoid turbinates was related. Indices of olfactory <b>bulb</b> <b>angle</b> and orientation may be useful for identification of dogs with extremely brachycephalic head conformations. Such information may be used by breeders to reduce the incidence or severity of brachycephalic-associated diseases...|$|E
40|$|A {{total of}} 183 panel {{specimens}} of 24 ST alloy with nominal thicknesses of 0. 020, 0. 025, and 0. 040 inch with extruded bulb-angle sections of 12 shapes spaced 4 and 5 inches as stiffeners were tested {{to obtain the}} buckling stress and the amplitude of the maximum wave when buckled. <b>Bulb</b> <b>angles</b> from 3 to 27 - 1 / 2 inches long were tested as pin-end columns. The experimental data are presented as stress-strain and column curves and in tabular form. Some comparisons with theoretical results are presented. Analytical methods are developed that {{make it possible for}} the designer to predict with reasonable accuracy the buckling stress and the maximum-wave amplitude of the sheet in stiffened-panel combinations. The scope of the test was insufficient to formulate general design criteria but the results are presented as a guide for design and an indictaion of the type of theoretical and experimental work needed...|$|R
40|$|A {{conventional}} frigate hullform {{was modified}} {{by the addition}} of four bow bulbs (herein distinguished from bow sonar domes) and three stern wedges with three different angles. All designs were tested, singly or as combinations of bulbs and wedges, for resistance in still water and three, the basis form and two bow bulb variants, were tested in regular head waves to evaluate seakeeping and slamming behaviour. Worthwhile reductions in fuel consumption are achievable with bulbs or wedges, dependent upon <b>bulb</b> design, wedge <b>angle,</b> propulsion machinery characteristics, and service speed profile. The bulbous bows tested in wave had no important adverse effect on seakeeping, and particularly slamming behaviour. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|R
40|$|This study {{evaluated}} claw {{development in}} 80 calves of different genetic background {{during the first}} 70 days of life. Linear claw measurements {{were found to be}} useful tools for this purpose. Large differences in claw parameters were observed, depending on the position of the claws, gender and breeding line, including interaction effects between gender and breeding line. In all four pairs of claws, the medial claws were longer than the lateral claws. Claw width is significantly wider in lateral claws, both hind and fore. Male calves showed significantly higher values than females in most measured parameters except <b>bulb</b> length and <b>angle</b> of the <b>bulb.</b> Comparing breeding lines, significant differences in some parameters (claw width, length of the diagonal, sole length, axial wall length) were found, which are in discussion to be important in claw soundness. Older cows produced calves with larger claws than calves of younger cows...|$|R

40|$|A {{parametric}} {{computational model}} of the human carotid artery bifurcation is employed to demonstrate {{that it is only}} necessary to simulate approximately one-half of a single heart pulse when performing a global exploration of the relationships between shear stress and changes in geometry. Using design of experiments and surface fitting techniques, a landscape is generated that graphically depicts these multi-dimensional relationships. Consequently, whilst finely resolved, grid and pulse independent results are traditionally demanded by the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) community, this strategy demonstrates {{that it is possible to}} efficiently detect the relative impact of different geometry parameters, and to identify good and bad regions of the landscape by only simulating a fraction of a single pulse. Also, whereas in the past comparisons have been made between the distributions of appropriate shear stress metrics, such as average wall shear stress and oscillatory shear index, this strategy requires a figure of merit to compare different geometries. Here, an area-weighted integral of negative time-averaged shear stress,, is used as the principal objective function, although the discussion reveals that the extent as well as the intensity of reverse flow may be important. Five geometry parameters are considered: the sinus <b>bulb</b> width, the <b>angles</b> and the outflow diameters of the internal carotid artery (ICA) and external carotid artery (ECA). A survey of the landscape confirms that bulb shape has the dominant effect on with maximum occurring for large bulb widths. Also, it is shown that different sets of geometric parameters can produce low values of by either relatively small intense areas, or by larger areas of less intense reverse flow. <br/...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe Lower Palaeolithic site of Menez-Dregan I (Plouhinec, Finistere), {{located in}} Brittany {{at the very}} tip of western Europe, has been under {{excavation}} since 1991. It is an ancient marine cave where the roof has gradually collapsed, and hence partly protected the archaeological living floors from erosion. The fauna has not been preserved due to the acidic environment at the site, leaving only the lithic industry to show the living style of the human groups who settled there and, notably, mastered the very early lighting/control of fire in late MIS 13 or early MIS 12. Recent digging of layer 7 has provided a lithic assemblage {{comparable to that of}} the upper layers at the site and is representative of the Colombanian techno-typological facies. This Lower Palaeolithic industry is contemporary with the Acheulean but differs from it as the heavy-duty tools are mostly cobble tools (choppers). The raw materials used were directly collected from the site itself or from the surrounding pebble beaches; from this stage of collection the use of two chaines operatoires is clearly evident. The flint pebbles/cobbles are preferentially used for flake production. In most of the cases the "SSDA-Clactonian" (systeme par surface de debitage alternee) method is applied providing flakes with wide striking platforms seldom facetted, prominent <b>bulbs</b> and open <b>angled</b> ventral faces; sometimes flakes are produced by percussion on anvil; they are never Levallois. The small tool kit mainly includes denticulates and notches with a few scrapers. The heavy-duty tools mostly comprised of various types of choppers are shaped on larger cobbles selected for their rather flat, often elongated shape and for their homogenous nature sandstone or microgranite). This paper presents some specimens yielded by layer 7; although few, they are typical and definitely akin to the Acheulean techno-typological facies, especially two cleavers made on flakes (quartzite and microgranite), and two bifacial tools roughly shaped on cobbles (sandstone and quartzite), with a third one {{from the top of the}} underlying layer 8. These findings revive the question of the relationship between the Acheulean and the Colombanian. Moreover the position of the site in a setting where the natural rocks are available in the form of pebbles/cobbles, flint only as small pebbles, questions the influence of raw material on technical traditions. This provides arguments for understanding the Lower Palaeolithic variability and contributes to the debate on the definition of Acheulean...|$|R
