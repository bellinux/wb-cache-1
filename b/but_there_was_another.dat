25|$|Not {{much was}} {{expected}} of the Drillers, nowhere {{more evident than in}} the pre-season coaches poll that had them pegged to finish 4–36. Such opinions were hardly unexpected though, as the Power were a dismal 6–34 the year prior. Even then most of the players inherited were good for little more than trade bait as the NPSL required that teams could field no more than four imports. Experienced players were very hard to come by, as not only had there not been any Canadian teams prior to provide a talent base, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>another</b> Canadian team entering the league that year, the Toronto Shooting Stars, and they had a head start on finding players.|$|E

[...] For unknown reasons, that actor {{was not able}} to play the part, and Facinelli was selected in his place. The choice of Ashley Greene to portray Alice Cullen was criticized by some fans because Greene is [...] taller than her character as described in the novel. Meyer said that Rachael Leigh Cook resembled her vision of Alice.

500|$|Some {{critics and}} biographers have opined {{along the lines}} of Andrew Gibson: [...] "The modern James Joyce may have vigorously {{resisted}} the oppressive power of Catholic tradition. <b>But</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>another</b> Joyce who asserted his allegiance to that tradition, and never left it, or wanted to leave it, behind him." [...] Gibson argues that Joyce [...] "remained a Catholic intellectual if not a believer" [...] since his thinking remained influenced by his cultural background, even though he lived apart from that culture. His relationship with religion was complex and not easily understood, even perhaps by himself. He acknowledged the debt he owed to his early Jesuit training. Joyce told the sculptor August Suter, that from his Jesuit education, he had 'learnt to arrange things {{in such a way that}} they become easy to survey and to judge.' ...|$|E

[...] "It was an event that happened to real people who really died. Working around the wreck for so much time, you get such a strong sense of the profound sadness and injustice of it, and the message of it." [...] Cameron stated, [...] "You think, 'There probably aren't going to be many filmmakers who go to Titanic. There may never be another one – maybe a documentarian." [...] Due to this, he felt [...] "a great mantle of responsibility to convey the emotional message of it – to do that part of it right, too".|$|E

500|$|Waddington {{resented the}} class {{divisions}} in English cricket, his feelings fuelled by experiences of {{officers in the}} war and possibly his tour to Australia in 1920–21. He fully embraced Yorkshire's hard-edged competitiveness in the early 1920s: he questioned the decisions of umpires and sledged opposing batsmen, {{both of which were}} unusual at the time. His Times obituary noted that some disagreements came because Waddington played to win and was an enthusiastic appealer, although he was unlikely to win many appeals for leg before wicket because of the angle at which he bowled. Anthony Woodhouse, the cricket historian, describes Waddington as a [...] "wild and irresponsible...quick-tempered individual". <b>But</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>another</b> side to his personality; he was a good talker and liked to wear smart clothes, including monogrammed silk shirts. Sutcliffe, a close friend and teammate of Waddington, called him [...] "a genial fellow in the dressing room; a man with a rare personality, proof of which is shown by the fact that whenever there was a discussion of any kind in the dressing room, Abe generally ruled it, to all intents and purposes, the chairman." [...] The cricket writer Jim Kilburn wrote that [...] "at his best, [...] was a magnificently hostile bowler {{with one of the most}} beautiful actions ever seen in cricket, and his pace and break-back were a problem for the greatest of batsmen". The historian Leslie Duckworth summed him up: [...] "Yes, a man of temper, Waddington, but a fine cricketer." ...|$|E
2500|$|<b>But</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>another</b> {{cause for}} the rupture. Hazlitt had {{reviewed}} Wordsworth's The Excursion in 1814, [...] approvingly, but with serious reservations. Wordsworth's poetry was appreciated by few at that time. The Excursion was notoriously demeaned by the influential Francis Jeffrey in his Edinburgh Review criticism beginning with the words, [...] "This will never do", while Hazlitt's account was later judged {{to have been the}} most penetrating of any written at the time. Still, Wordsworth was unable to tolerate less than unconditional acceptance of his poetry, and he resented Hazlitt's review as much as he did Jeffrey's. Their relations deteriorated further, and by 1815 they were bitter enemies.|$|E
2500|$|One Texas Ranger {{said that}} {{although}} {{it was obvious to}} him that Lucas often lied, there was an instance where he demonstrated guilty knowledge: [...] "I remember him trying to cop to one he didn't do, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>another</b> murder case where I'll kiss your butt if he didn’t lead us right to the deer stand where the murder took place. Ain't no way he could've guessed that, and I damn sure didn't tell him. I think he did that one." [...] Another Ranger had a similar experience: Lucas demonstrated his apparent familiarity with a crime scene by directing his escort to the murder location with ease, {{as if he had been}} there before.|$|E

2500|$|The {{charge of}} a uranium nucleus, we found, was indeed large enough to {{overcome}} {{the effect of the}} surface tension almost completely; so the uranium nucleus might indeed resemble a very wobbly unstable drop, ready to divide itself at the slightest provocation, such as the impact of a single neutron. <b>But</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>another</b> problem. After separation, the two drops would be driven apart by their mutual electric repulsion and would acquire high speed and hence a very large energy, about 200MeV in all; where could that energy come from? ...Lise Meitner... worked out that the two nuclei formed by the division of a uranium nucleus together would be lighter than the original uranium nucleus by about one-fifth the mass of a proton. Now whenever mass disappears energy is created, according to Einstein's formula E= mc2, and one-fifth of a proton mass was just equivalent to 200MeV. So here was the source for that energy; it all fitted! ...|$|E
