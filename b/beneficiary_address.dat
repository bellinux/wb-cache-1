40|$|This paper {{describes}} a proof-of-concept study undertaken {{to determine the}} usefulness of provider-beneficiary mean geographic distances as a screening tool in Medicare fraud, waste and abuse detection activities. Tech-niques included geocoding provider and <b>beneficiary</b> <b>addresses,</b> calculating geographic distances between pro-vider-beneficiary pairs, and creating summary statistics and automated screening procedures. We used ESRI’s ArcView Desktop GIS software for street-level geocoding, Gazetteer files publicly available from the U. S. Census Bureau for zip code-level geocoding, and Base SAS for all data transfer activities, distance calculations, summary statistics and screening. SAS procedures included PROC DBF, PROC MEANS and PROC SUMMARY. The DATA Step was also used for calculations and screening. Outcomes suggest that larger-than-average mean pro-vider-beneficiary geographic distances are a good indicator of potentially anomalous provider activity and that the methodology developed is {{for the most part}} time-efficient and cost-effective...|$|R
40|$|The {{main focus}} of the social {{protection}} and labor portfolio is on strengthening client's institutional capacity {{in the design and}} implementation of programs, but projects are not well equipped to track progress in this area. Correspondingly, {{there is a need to}} strengthen approaches to measuring and monitoring a'missing middle'of service delivery, precisely those areas for which counterpart institutions are responsible during the course of a project. In particular, better measures of the primary functions of social protection and labor agencies are needed, such as identifying and enrolling beneficiaries, targeting, payment systems, fraud and error control, performance monitoring of service delivery providers, responsiveness to citizens, transparency, efficiency, management information systems and monitoring and evaluation systems. New World Bank initiatives particularly standard core indicators by sector and the introduction of results based investment lending call for substantial improvements in the use of monitoring and evaluation (M&E). Impact evaluations are included in about half of projects and should continue to be used selectively and strategically, particularly when the program is innovative, replicable and/ or scalable to reach a broader set of <b>beneficiaries,</b> <b>addresses</b> a knowledge gap and is likely to have a substantial policy impact.

40|$|An in vivo {{biosensor}} is {{a technology}} in development that will assess the biological activity of cancers to individualise external beam radiotherapy. Inserting such technology {{into the human}} body creates cybernetic organisms; a cyborg that is a human–machine hybrid. There is a gap in knowledge relating to patient willingness to allow automated technology to be embedded and to become cyborg. There is little agreement around what makes a cyborg and less understanding {{of the variation in}} the cyborgisation process. Understanding the viewpoint of possible <b>beneficiaries</b> <b>addresses</b> such gaps. There are currently three versions of ‘cyborg’ in the literature (i) a critical feminist STS concept to destabilise power inherent in dualisms, (ii) an extreme version of the human/machine in science-fiction that emphasises the ‘man’ in human and (iii) a prediction of internal physiological adaptation required for future space exploration. Interview study findings with 12 men in remission from prostate cancer show a fourth version can be used to describe current and future sub-groups of the population; ‘everyday cyborgs'. For the everyday cyborg the masculine cyborg status found in the fictionalised human–machine related to issues of control of the cancer. This was preferred to the felt stigmatisation of being a ‘leaker and bleeder’. The willingness to become cyborg was matched with a having {{to get used to the}} everyday cyborg's technological adaptations and risks. It is crucial to explore the everyday cyborg's sometimes ambivalent viewpoint. The everyday cyborg thus adds the dimension of participant voice currently missing in existing cyborg literatures and imaginations...|$|R

The objective {{of this study was}} to assess the contribution of Lideta Micro-Finance Institution (LMFI) to the livelihood of the beneficiaries’ case of Adigrat. In order to see the MF contribution to the livelihood of beneficiary previous researches in Tigray focused mainly on physical and financial capital based conditions. This research has incorporated limited financial, human and social indicators in the assessment of the contribution to livelihoods. The information for the purpose of assessing the contribution of LMFI to the livelihood of beneficiaries was obtained from primary and secondary sources. 120 respondents with at least four years stay in the institution have been selected using purposive sampling. Quantitative and qualitative data were collected through semi-structured questionnaires and ten <b>beneficiaries</b> <b>addressed</b> through a questionnaire have also participated in focus group discussion. Further, the interview was conducted with five members of LMFI experts and Community Development Workers (CDW). The result of the study suggests that program participation has a positive contribution to the household income and social performance. However, the rate of children school enrolment before and after beneficiaries joined the institution showed no changes at all. Whereas, the beneficiaries care for their child's education in the form of providing school materials and making strict follow up on their education has shown positive changes after they joined the institution. Besides, the children of the beneficiaries have invested their time in helping the business in a way that does n’t interfere with their education. Hence, government bodies, nongovernmental and other concerned bodies by taking this result into consideration, they should work for further progress of MF...|$|R

30|$|Although {{beneficiaries}} {{might not}} have all {{the information about the}} estate distribution after the death of the estate holder because of information asymmetry, the last will can send a positive signal to <b>beneficiaries.</b> Signaling theory <b>addresses</b> information asymmetries between two parties in which the sources of asymmetric information are concerned with information about quality or information about intent (Stiglitz 2000; Su et al. 2015). In the case of estate planning decisions, the last will writer has better information about the names of beneficiaries on the last will but beneficiaries {{might not have}} the same information about the intentions of the last will writer. Meditation, which comes from religious beliefs (Caponigro 2012), minimizes the agency problem between the last will writer and his or her family members by sending a positive signal to beneficiaries. The findings of Gill and Mathur (2017) suggested that level of religious beliefs positively impacts estate planning decisions of individuals.|$|R

40|$|Shared Savings Program and Accountable Care Organizations (ACO 5). NASW is {{a strong}} {{supporter}} of the 2010 Affordable Care Act. We support the concept ofACOs because shared accountability for <b>beneficiary</b> health will <b>address</b> both gaps in quality and unnecessary costs caused by fragmented and poorly coordinated care. Moreover, shared savings will support activities that improve care and lower health care costs—namely, care coordination services—which are not currently reimbursed under the Medicare fee-for-service program. We offer, for your consideration, the following recommendations to strengthen the Shared Savings Program. Meeting the Core Objectives of the Shared Savmgs Program NASW supports the three core objectives of the Shared Savings Program: better care for individuals, better health for populations, and lower growth in health care expenditures. We believe these goals cannot be achieved, however, without the participation of a broader array of providers in the ACO health care team. In particular, we recommend greater specificity regarding the types of psychosocial supports and services that ACOs must provide. In the absence of such requirements, ACOs may fail to address the social determinants of health an...|$|R
40|$|Implementation of ecosystem-based {{fisheries}} management (EBFM) requires a clear conceptual and quantitative framework for assessing how different harvest options can modify benefits to ecosystem and human <b>beneficiaries.</b> We <b>address</b> this social-ecological need for Pacific salmon fisheries, which are economically valuable but intercept {{much of the}} annual pulse of nutrient subsidies that salmon provide to terrestrial and aquatic food webs. We used grizzly bears, vectors of salmon nutrients and animals with densities strongly coupled to salmon abundance, as surrogates for "salmon ecosystem" function. Combining salmon biomass and stock-recruitment data with stable isotope analysis, we assess potential tradeoffs between fishery yields and bear population densities for six sockeye salmon stocks in Bristol Bay, Alaska, and British Columbia (BC), Canada. For the coastal stocks, we find that both bear densities and fishery yields would increase substantially if ecosystem allocations of salmon increase from currently applied lower to upper goals and beyond. This aligning of benefits comes at a potential cost, however, {{with the possibility of}} forgoing harvests in low productivity years. In contrast, we detect acute tradeoffs between bear densities and fishery yields in interior stocks within the Fraser River, BC, where biomass from other salmon species is low. There, increasing salmon allocations to ecosystems would benefit threatened bear populations at the cost of reduced long-term yields. To resolve this conflict, we propose an EBFM goal that values fisheries and bears (and by extension, the ecosystem) equally. At such targets, ecosystem benefits are unexpectedly large compared with losses in fishery yields. To explore other management options, we generate tradeoff curves that provide stock-specific accounting of the expected loss to fishers and gain to bears as more salmon escape the fishery. Our approach, modified to suit multiple scenarios, provides a generalizable method to resolve conflicts over shared resources in other systems...|$|R

40|$|The Energising Development (EnDev) initiative, {{for which}} the GIZ acts as {{implementing}} agency, promotes the supply of modern energy technologies to households and small‐scale businesses in the rural communities of 24 countries in Africa, Latin America and Asia. In Indonesia, this has been achieved through off‐grid micro‐hydro (MHP) and solar power mini‐grids and since 2006 230 MHP and 117 solar projects have been supported to varying degree at substantial cost, reaching more than 167 thousand people. The objective {{of this study is}} to assess this contribution of the EnDev-Indonesia initiative regarding the MHP performance and ultimate long‐term sustainability prospect of the rural energy infrastructure in the country. As such a comparison between EnDev and non-EnDev MHP projects in the country was undertaken and based on the established Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) survey methodology and the DB&TO sustainability model specifically fashioned for the purpose of this study. This approach involved on‐site visits and comprises technical, social, economic and environmental aspects. As a result, the analysis has shown important differences among the different supporting schemes, with the second implementing phase (2009 ‐ 2012) of EnDev outranking the other systems largely due to the high level of technical sustainability achieved by these sites. Such a good performance is even more surprising considering that the EnDev 1 sites implemented during the first phase of the program in the early years were among the least‐sustainable investigated in this study. However, despite the high costs necessary to reach such a high level of sustainability as regards the quality of the civil works and electro‐mechanical equipments, this aspect alone was found not enough to guarantee the long‐term sustainability of MHP in Indonesia. On the other hand, lack of social and economic sustainability appeared having fatal consequences onthe operations of many plants. Therefore, such complex interrelation among the different aspects of sustainability was investigated and also external factors, like the regional and cultural differences among the different <b>beneficiaries,</b> were <b>addressed.</b> Finally, recommendations for future eventual courses of action were proposed. ...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} issues facing the South African democracy is that of breaking the grip of poverty on a substantial portion of its citizens. In South Africa, Non-Profit Organisations (NPOs) {{play a major role in}} the development of assistance for the poor and in reducing poverty. As an NPO, the Greater Midrand Development Centre (GMDC) has played an important role in supporting and encouraging the development aspirations of Region A of the City of Johannesburg community in the areas of Agricultural projects, bakery, poultry and paper making. The aim of the study was to determine the impact of the Development Centre Approach (DCA) on poverty alleviation in the Region A of the City of Johannesburg community and to make recommendations on policy priorities and challenges that will fast track developmental social service delivery within a Development Centre Approach. The study focused on the GMDC poverty alleviation projects in five selected areas. The study followed a qualitative research approach. Data was collected by means of one-on-one interviews and focus groups by means of semi-structured interview schedules. The participants of the focus groups involved both those beneficiaries who were still attending the GMDC poverty alleviation projects, and those who have exited the development centre poverty alleviation projects. The one-on-one interviews involved five project leaders, members of the board, staff members, and officials from the Department of Social Development. The findings indicated that the GMDC has played a crucial role in terms of poverty alleviation of the beneficiaries. From the study it was concluded that the poverty alleviation projects of the GMDC appear to be alleviating the poverty of the <b>beneficiaries</b> by <b>addressing</b> some of their basic needs to a certain extent by improving a livelihood, but nonetheless still not reducing their poverty levels. The study recommends the development of a clear exit strategy which is understood and supported by beneficiaries. The exit strategy should include factors and elements which will promote sustainability, such as business and entrepreneurial skills; knowledge on equipment; material; a marketing strategy; and a strategy or guidelines on networking, including donors and financing institutions.

40|$|I {{explore the}} role of {{information}} and communication {{in the world of}} institution-led development. Through a series of case studies from the Atlantic Coast of Nicaragua, I present several projects and their implications for uncovering information that may lead to greater local benefit from externally-planned development projects. In order to construct policies and implement projects, development institutions collect, analyze, and simplify information, collapsing messy physical and social realities into narrow sets of metrics. In addition, local stakeholders often aren't privy to the analysis and assumptions of the "expert" planners. An evolved set of methods for dialogue and planning, which focus on sharing available information, can help facilitate outcomes that are more beneficial for targeted groups. Carbon abatement cost curves provide a clear example where the relations of complex social, economic, and environmental systems are reduced to a narrow set of metrics, specifically the cost of carbon mitigation and the total tons reduced. When the carbon abatement cost curve is applied to the community level, it reveals information and allows for conclusions obscured by aggregated national level studies. I show that there are opportunities for augmenting the limited metrics of these cost curves to include those that relate to welfare, beginning to highlight how costs and savings are distributed among stakeholders. In particular, the benefits to the most marginalized groups are heavily dependent on planners taking a pro-poor approach. However, planners typically remain blind to the priorities, capabilities, and values of the target stakeholders. There is a dearth of methods that effectively open up the development expert's black box of project designs, allowing their proposed solutions to be transparent to the target <b>beneficiaries.</b> I <b>address</b> this challenge through the presentation of a participatory modeling process that was utilized with groups of artisanal fishers. Participatory modeling places a greater emphasis on understanding processes, rather than just focusing on outcomes. The process facilitated the detailed exploration of local realities through the creation and playing of a board game that modeled their local fishing economy. Participants were able to look closely at the causal relations between several potential development interventions such as a cooperative-owned fish businesses and local ice production, gaining insights into possible costs and benefits...|$|R

It then explores how housing <b>beneficiaries</b> have creatively <b>addressed</b> some of these issues by transforming their subsidised houses, primarily through the addition of back yard rooms. The paper then describes a new housing typology which uses backyard rooms as a valuable precedent. The illustrated paper examines design issues that arise when designing at an optimal 100 units/ha such as: • Strategic placing of the initial unit; • Accommodating additions to the initial unit; • Utilising the site effectively to ensure adequate outdoor space; • Enabling occupation by a number of households; • Accommodating home-businesses; • Contributing to streetscape; and • Balancing public and private space.

40|$|The {{international}} development {{agencies and the}} Chinese government have become increasingly {{more aware of the}} importance of bottom-up community-driven development. Some scholars argue that the problems for community-driven development in China are mainly because of the lack of favorable policy environment and effective monitoring mechanisms. The research in this dissertation does not intend to deny the importance of those factors. The goal of this work, however, is to offer perspectives that can help organizations at all levels and of different sectors to understand the importance of embracing and integrating the local culture into development policy making and program designing. To achieve effective community-driven development, the policy makers and practitioners should first understand and respect the culture and interests of the <b>beneficiaries.</b> Instead of <b>addressing</b> institutaional and structural development issues as "hardware", this research takes a cultural perspective as "software" to contribute to the existing literature of this field. To achieve effective community-driven development in China, partnership and cooperation between different players is crucial. Culture, both as means and ends of development, is an important factor that bonds them together. Emphasizing the significnace of gender roles and responsibilities, a gendered perspective of community development in China is presented in this research. This research also refers to theories of Complex Adaptive Systems and Self-organization mechanisms, which explain how complex, adaptive macro behavior emerges from simple, local micro decisions and how simple agents collectively solve difficult problems. The roles of community, government, and NGOs [domestic and international] in this development process will be addressed here. During the author's field study in the rural areas of China in the summer of 2007, data was collected through participatory observation, interviews, and focus groups with multiple stakeholders involved in the community-driven development programs in China.

The ”New Public Management” denotes goverment policies that, since the 1980 s, aimed to modernise and render the public sector more efficient through a better management of the public budget. as to enforce competition, emphasizing economic and leadership principles. New public management <b>addresses</b> <b>beneficiaries</b> of public services much like customers, and conversely citizens as shareholders. Ferlie et al (1996) describe the ”New Public Management in Action” {{in terms of an}} introduction into public services that is done by markets, managers and measurement. However, pedagogy aims at developing the emancipatory potential of the “responses” of each individual to the different questions of life. Pedagogy should enable the individual to get awareness of such questions, making him/her capable of working out a range of possible answers as well as reflecting these answers in terms of effecting a situation {{for the benefit of the}} social community, for society and environment as well as for her/his own good (see Kraus 2010). A pedagogical relation of an adult to a child or to a young (or aged) person is supposed to be carried out by a constant, in a way “loving” attentiveness for the initiatives of this person. Pedagogical “love” embraces difference as its basic principle as well as the demand of a completely unselfish and also highly reflexive attention to the needs of the child or young (or aged) person in terms of reaching the aim of pedagogy. Every pedagogical relation is thus directed to sooner or later surpassing the asymmetric social relation which is significant for it, in that by pedagogy the learning persons should be empowered to self-determination and responsibility for themselves, for others and for the things. There is no human development without the efforts of pedagogues or adults to focus on the needs of children and other dependent humans, focusing on the aim of an optimal emancipation.

40|$|High-deductible {{health plans}} (HDHPs) are an {{important}} and growing part of the health insurance landscape. By some estimates, as many as 80 percent of large employers may offer an HDHP in 2014. In 2013, more than 15 million Americans received health coverage through an HDHP, a more than a threefold increase since 2007. As outlined by the U. S. Treasury Department, individuals with an HSA-eligible HDHP are required to pay {{the full cost of}} most medications and services [...] in theory utilizing pre-tax HSA funds [...] until deductibles are met. However, the 2003 authorizing legislation and further guidance include a safe harbor allowing plans to cover primary preventive services, those typically deemed to prevent the onset of disease, before the deductible is satisfied. Services or benefits meant to treat "an existing illness, injury or condition," are excluded from first-dollar coverage in HSA-eligible HDHPs, which encompasses most secondary preventive services. For example, plans are prohibited from providing first dollar coverage of disease management services such as insulin, eye and foot exams, and glucose monitoring supplies for patients with diabetes. As chronic disease conditions currently make up 75 percent of total U. S. health spending, appropriate chronic disease management is an important tool to lower long-term health care costs. As the market for HDHPs grow, it is important that they maintain the flexibility to allow for effective health management of all <b>beneficiaries.</b> This report <b>addresses</b> the strict definition of prevention that an HDHP must follow for it to include a pre-tax health savings account (HSA), and how this restriction limits the effectiveness of current plans. A potential solution - allowing HSA-eligible HDHPs to provide first-dollar coverage for targeted, evidence-based, secondary preventive services that prevent chronic disease progression and related complications - can improve patient-centered outcomes, add efficiency to medical spending, and enhance HDHP attractiveness. A multi-disciplinary research team from the University of Michigan's Center for Value-Based Insurance Design, Harvard Medical School, and the University of Minnesota conducted a multi-part project to investigate the impact of updating the definition of prevention for HDHPs to include selected secondary preventive services that are frequently used as health plan quality metrics and included as elements of pay-for-performance programs. Specifically, the project aimed to: 1) determine the premium effect, actuarial value, and estimated market uptake of the novel HDHP plan that covers these evidence-based services outside the deductible, and 2) explore through interviews whether insurance industry experts found coverage of secondary preventive services a worthwhile endeavor...|$|R
40|$|The Renewable Energy (RE) {{sector is}} {{one of the fastest growing}} new {{industries}} in the Republic of South Africa (RSA). The Bloomberg New Energy Finance Climate Scope Report recently ranked RSA third globally, behind China and Brazil, and first among African countries for investment in clean energy (Glickman, 2014). However, one of the main benefits to be derived from the industry, that of socio-economic and enterprise development, is not being achieved owing to unsuccessful management of revenue for beneficiary communities in the renewable energy sector in RSA. Challenges relating to good governance and long-term planning are causing significant harm to communities that are already vulnerable, and are threatening to have a negative effect on the industry’s ability to fulfil its obligation to alleviate and, ultimately, eradicate poverty in some of the poorest communities in RSA. The primary objective of this study is to develop a model for the successful management of revenue for beneficiary communities in the renewable energy sector in South Africa. The model will provide guidance for enterprises, stakeholders, industry experts and community development practitioners within the renewable energy sector towards a pro-active, effective, and relevant decision-making process to achieve success in managing revenue for <b>beneficiary</b> communities. To <b>address</b> the primary objective, a number of secondary objectives were established by developing a conceptual model comprising variables identified in a comprehensive survey of the related literature. A path diagram, based on the formulation of appropriate hypotheses, was constructed between the independent variable and subsequent intervening and dependent variables. Primary data sourced from the identified national and international population of project management practitioners were collected by means of an electronic measuring instrument. The data were analysed and tested empirically by means of Structural Equation Modelling (SEM). The determinants that were identified through a review of the literature as influencing the success of managing revenue for beneficiary communities of renewable energy companies in South Africa included: the use of outside advice, strategic financial services, strategic planning, strategic partnerships, infrastructure development and project management. In order to achieve the objective, the following research questions were formulated: What is the influence of external factors such as outside advisers and support services on the perceived success of managing revenue for beneficiary communities of renewable energy companies in South Africa? The purpose of this research, therefore, was to evaluate and recommend new methodologies to the renewable energy sector by introducing a model of perceived success in managing revenue for beneficiary communities of renewable energy companies in South Africa. The study provided new insight into managing revenue for beneficiary communities in RSA. With the renewable energy sector being one of the fastest growing sectors in the RSA, and the RSA Government being determined to link the location of renewable energy facilities to economic development, this research has given new insight into managing revenue for SED and ED. The objectives of multi-sector participation, transformational change and sustainable initiatives for beneficiary communities could ensure greater consideration and care when managing beneficiary revenue. Thereby, the opportunity presented by the RE industry for beneficiary communities can change these communities dramatically for the better. The study makes a valuable contribution to the body of knowledge about managing revenue for beneficiary communities. The proposed model has led to a better understanding of the determinants that influence the success of managing revenue for beneficiary communities, namely: distinctive benefits (a combination of two variables: outside advice and support services), financial management, developmental benefits (a combination of two variables: infrastructure development and education), human development, project management and strategic planning. The study has also opened up new avenues of research into this subject...|$|R
