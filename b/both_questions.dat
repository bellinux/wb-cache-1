5|$|Fisher wanted {{additional}} Commonwealth {{power in}} certain areas, {{such as the}} nationalisation of monopolies. A constitutional referendum was initiated in 1911 which aimed to increase the federal government's legislative powers over trade and commerce and over monopolies. <b>Both</b> <b>questions</b> were defeated, with around 61 per cent voting 'No'. The Fisher government made another attempt, holding a referendum in 1913 which asked for greater federal powers over trade and commerce, corporations, industrial matters, trusts, monopolies, and railway disputes. All six questions were defeated, with around 51 per cent voting 'No'. At the 1913 election, the Commonwealth Liberal Party, led by Joseph Cook, defeated the Labor Party by a single seat.|$|E
5|$|In {{answering}} <b>both</b> <b>questions</b> in the negative, the Court of Appeal {{overturned the}} High Court's {{finding that the}} statute was unconstitutional. The Court of Appeal further clarified Singapore's stance on legislative plenary power and expounded upon Article 12(1) of the Constitution, explaining that the promise of equality {{does not mean that}} all persons are to be treated equally, but simply that all persons in like situations will be treated alike. Drawing on foreign case law, the Court of Appeal further outlined the test to determine if a differentiating law falls foul of Article 12.|$|E
30|$|In {{order to}} compare {{questions}} produced by different question generation teams, Rus et al. (2010) identified five criteria {{for humans to}} use in judging the quality of questions: syntactic correctness, ambiguity, relevance, question type, and variety. Although the first two criteria, syntactic correctness and ambiguity, are probably clear, the other three criteria need explanation. Because the generation task required generating questions from given texts, relevance measured the match of the question to its source in the text. <b>Both</b> <b>question</b> type and variety rewarded systems that generated questions {{in a variety of}} formats. For instance, a system that merely prepended “Is it the case that” to every sentence would get low marks for <b>both</b> <b>question</b> type and variety.|$|R

5|$|Johnson {{returned}} home when his state {{took up the}} issue of secession. His successor as governor, Isham G. Harris, and the legislature, organized a referendum on whether to have a constitutional convention to authorize secession; when that failed, they put the question of leaving the Union to a popular vote. Despite threats on Johnson's life, and actual assaults, he campaigned against <b>both</b> <b>questions,</b> sometimes speaking with a gun on the lectern before him. Although Johnson's eastern region of Tennessee was largely against secession, the second referendum passed, and in June 1861, Tennessee joined the Confederacy. Believing he would be killed if he stayed, Johnson fled through the Cumberland Gap, where his party was in fact shot at. He left his wife and family in Greeneville.|$|E
5|$|Minas Geraes was christened by Senhora Regis de Oliveira, {{the wife}} of the Brazilian {{minister}} to Great Britain, and launched at Newcastle-on-Tyne on 10 September 1908. During fitting-out, it was moved to Vickers' Walker Yard, and thousands turned out to see the incomplete ship squeeze barely underneath and through overhead and swing bridges. After completion, Minas Geraes was handed over by Armstrong on 5 January to the Brazilian Commission on behalf of the Brazilian government, while the ship's company was mustered on deck. The British Royal Navy carried out its gunnery trials at the request of Armstrong's and with the agreement of the Brazilian government. Although the idea of having superfiring turrets was not new—the American s were also designed and built in this fashion around the same time—the trials attracted interest from a few nations, who sent representatives to observe. They wanted to resolve two major questions: the effect that firing the upper superfiring turrets would have on the crewmen in the lower guns, and whether smoke from the discharge of the lower guns would hinder the targeting capabilities of the upper turret. The tests resolved <b>both</b> <b>questions</b> satisfactorily.|$|E

25|$|In March 1989 the Court {{handed down}} its ruling. By a narrow margin, it {{held for the}} {{government}} on <b>both</b> <b>questions,</b> that the title applications were mailings in furtherance of Schmuck's scheme {{and that he was}} not entitled to an instruction on odometer tampering. Harry Blackmun wrote the majority opinion, joined by Chief Justice William Rehnquist, Byron White, John Paul Stevens, and Anthony Kennedy. Scalia wrote for himself and the other three dissenters, William Brennan, Thurgood Marshall, and Sandra Day O'Connor. His opinion exclusively concerned the first question and did not reach the second.|$|E
25|$|During {{the first}} Parliamentary hearing, Labour Party, NZ First, Green Party and Māori Party {{expressed}} {{dissatisfaction with the}} order of the questions and said that the public should first be asked whether they want a change, and continue with a second referendum only if they do, or <b>both</b> <b>questions</b> compacted into one referendum, which could potentially save millions of dollars. David Seymour (ACT's representative in the Cross-Party Group) said that the planned order made sense, as the public would need to see the alternative designs before deciding on a change. Professor John Burrows, chair of the Flag Consideration Panel, agreed that familiarity with proposals is a prerequisite for a properly informed decision about them.|$|E
25|$|In {{the second}} round, the contestants {{attempted}} {{to match the}} celebrities whom they had not matched in the first round. On the CBS version, the challenger always began the second round (unless that contestant had matched all six stars; in this situation, the champion selected from the two questions available). This meant that a champion who had only answered one question could be ahead of a challenger who had played <b>both</b> <b>questions,</b> rendering the final question moot. On the syndicated versions, the leader after a round played first in the next round. In case of a tie score, the contestant who had not selected their own question in the previous round made the selection in the tie-breaker round.|$|E

25|$|Blackmun ruled for the {{government}} on <b>both</b> <b>questions.</b> Since Schmuck had enjoyed a continuing relationship with the dealers he sold to, and the cars could not be resold to a retail customer without titles obtained using false information, the dealers' applications were {{an essential element of}} his crime and thus constituted mail fraud. On the second question, Blackmun said the court should have considered whether the elements of odometer tampering were a subset of the elements of the mail fraud, and since {{that was not the case}} Schmuck had been properly denied the instruction. Scalia's dissent focused exclusively on the mail fraud issue. Since Schmuck had already received his payment for the altered vehicles, it did not matter what happened afterwards, a holding he found more consistent with the Court's earlier rulings on the subject.|$|E
25|$|The High Court {{answered}} <b>both</b> <b>questions</b> in the negative. The majority, Griffith CJ, Barton & O'Connor JJ, {{in separate}} decisions, applied {{the decision in}} the Sawmillers case, holding that the Arbitration Court could not make an award that was inconsistent with a State law. There were two fundamental propositions that were central to the judgments of the majority, (1) the reserved powers doctrine that power to regulate the domestic trade and commerce was reserved to the State and that the Australian parliament could not invade that sphere and (2) that arbitration was the exercise of judicial power and that the Arbitration Court was required to determine the matter according to law, including State law. Section 109 of the Constitution, did not apply because the Arbitration Court was required to declare and administer the law, not make it, thus an award made by the Arbitration Court was not a federal law that would prevail over a State law. Discontent with a State law was not an industrial dispute between employees and their employer. On the question of inconsistency the majority held the question was whether {{it was impossible to}} obey both laws. Because an employer could agree to pay more than the State minimum wage, the Arbitration Court could order the employer to pay more than the minimum.|$|E
500|$|In the House of Lords, {{technically}} {{called the}} Court of the King (or Queen) in Parliament, the Lord High Steward was the President or Chairman of the Court, {{and the entire}} House determined <b>both</b> <b>questions</b> of fact and questions of law {{as well as the}} verdict. By convention, Bishops and Archbishops did not vote on the verdict, though they were expected to attend {{during the course of the}} trial. They sat until the conclusion of the deliberations, and withdrew from the chamber just prior to the final vote. At the end of the trial, peers voted on the question before them by standing and declaring their verdict by saying [...] "guilty, upon my honour" [...] or [...] "not guilty, upon my honour", starting with the most junior baron and proceeding in order of precedence ending with the Lord High Steward. For a guilty verdict, a majority of twelve was necessary. The entire House also determined the punishment to be imposed, which had to accord with the law. For capital crimes the punishment was death; the last peer to be executed was Laurence Shirley, 4th Earl Ferrers, who was hanged for murder in 1760.|$|E
