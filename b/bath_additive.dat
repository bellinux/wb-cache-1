A conventional, additive-free sulfamate electrolyte has been chosen for pure Ni electrodeposition due to its simplicity and ability to produce ductile, low-stress films.

The electrodeposition of pure Ni in the presence of saccharin is studied here to understand its effects in the absence of an alloying element (such as Co or Fe). The grain structure and Vickers hardness of Ni deposited with and without saccharin on a rotating disk electrode were all found to be consistent with previous studies available in the literature. The following observations were made: (1) The fine, columnar morphology obtained without saccharin became an equiaxed, nano-sized grain structure with saccharin (from {approx} 1. 5 {micro}m to {approx} 40 nm nominal grain size, respectively). The grain refinement resulting from saccharin is not accompanied with an increase in film stress, in contrast to the grain refinement associated with certain Ni alloys. (2) A change in the deposit texture from weak (210) to (111) along the film growth direction with the addition of saccharin. (3) An increase in Vickers hardness by a factor of {approx} 2 (from {approx} 170 to {approx} 320) upon the addition of saccharin. (4) A rapid decrease in hardness with annealing from the high, as-deposited values for films deposited with saccharin to a value lower than that of annealed Ni from an additive-free bath.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Zinc and its alloys {{are among the most}} widely utilised metallic coatings for the sacrificial protection of steel. Although excellent in this mode of protection, these coatings are often less durable when subjected to environments of combined wear and corrosion due to their intrinsic relative softness and ductility. A possible and fast growing way of improving the durability of these coating is by the codeposition of inert particles into the zinc and zinc-alloy matrix. The main aim of this research was therefore to improve the durability of zinc and zinc-nickel coatings by the incorporation of inert particles via electrolytic codeposition methods. The first five chapters of this thesis comprise literature review on the electrodeposition of zinc, its alloys and composite electrodeposition in general. A major part of which was dedicated to the review of various conventional methods and parameters such as current density, agitation, temperature, solution composition, <b>bath</b> <b>additives</b> and pH usually investigated in electrodeposition.

A systematic study on the deposition behaviour of both zinc/silica and zinc-nickel/silica composite baths was carried out with particular interest on the rate of particle incorporation and the influence of particles on zinc-nickel alloy deposition.

All coatings were electrodeposited on mild steel. Using GES {{it was possible to}} identify Zn-Co intermetallic phases in the coatings with Co content higher than 1 at. %. The GES, SEM and EDX results revealed that the corrosion mechanism of the Zn-Co layers with high Co content is related to the appearance of cracks due to the dissolution of the gamma Zn-rich phases, while the corrosion of the Zn and Zn- 1 Co layers was characterized by dissolution of the coatings.

The better corrosion resistance of the Zn-Co coatings obtained in the <b>bath</b> without <b>additive,</b> in comparison with Zn- 1 Co obtained in the <b>bath</b> containing <b>additive</b> is due to the high Co content which leads to an ennoblement of the coating.

Zinc-bismuth alloys also have melting points higher than zinc-tin alloys and thus {{are considered to be}} superior to the latter. A major challenge in the electrodeposition of zinc-bismuth alloys is the difference in standard potentials of the two metals of 1. 08 V. Thus very little is known on electroplated zinc-bismuth alloys [2]. Cyclic voltammetry and Hull cell experiments have shown that sole complexation of bismuth with common ligands such as gluconate, tartrate or citrate is insufficient to avoid burnt bismuth deposits.

40|$|Copper {{surfaces}} are sometimes protected with an organic coating {{to improve the}} durability or the aesthetic properties. Examples of industrial applications are household appliances and heat exchanger components. In order to extend the service life of the organic coated copper a specific surface pre-treatment is often required. Nevertheless, probably because of the limited market of this application, no specific pre-treatments for copper are industrially developed, {{with the exception of}} cleaning procedures, but simply extensions of existing pre-treatments optimised for other metals (aluminium, zinc, magnesium alloys) are used. The application of silane pre-treatments as adhesion promoters for organic coated metals is remarkably increasing in the last decade, because silanes offer very good performance together with high environmental compatibility. The idea is therefore to try to develop a specific silane based pre-treatment for copper. The starting point is the existing silane products for aluminium, modifying the composition and the application conditions (concentration, pH of the <b>bath,</b> <b>additives,</b> etc.) in order to develop a high performance copper alloy pretreatment increasing the protective properties and the adhesion of a successively applied organic coating.

In this work the metallized films were developed by electroless copper plating of polyethylene films grafted with vinyl ether of monoethanoleamine. There are several techniques for metal deposition on surface of polymers such as evaporation, sputtering, electroless plating and electrolysis. In this work the metallized films were developed by electroless copper plating of polyethylene films grafted with vinyl ether of monoethanoleamine. Polyethylene films were subjected to gamma-radiation induced surface graft copolymerization with vinyl ether of monoethanolamine. Electroless copper plating was carried out effectively on the modified films. The catalytic processes for the electroless copper plating in the presence {{and the absence of}} SnCl 2 sensitization were studied and the optimum activation conditions that give the highest plating rate were determined. The effect of grafting degree on the plating rate is studied. Electroless plating conditions (<b>bath</b> <b>additives,</b> pH and temperature) were optimized. Plating rate was determined gravimetrically and spectrophotometrically at different grafting degrees. The results reveal that plating rate is a function of degree of grafting and increases with increasing grafted vinyl ether of monoethanolamine onto polyethylene. It was found that pH 13 of electroless bath and plating temperature 40 °C are the optimal conditions for the plating process. The increasing of grafting degree results in faster plating rate at the same pH and temperature.

40|$|Copper was {{electrodeposited}} on a polycrystalline gold substrate both in {{the presence}} and absence of electrochemical <b>bath</b> <b>additives.</b> Stress evolution was monitored in situ using a cantilever beam method and surface morphology was observed using in situ atomic force microscopy (AFM). Measurements of stress and relaxation behaviour provided adequate data-sets to generate reliable and reproducible plots of local stress in the film. This was possible because (i) the magnitude of stress relaxation upon resumption of deposition was small relative to the stress generated during deposition and (ii) stress upon resuming deposition eventually recovered to its pre-interrupted value. In-situ stress measurements showed that tensile stress peaked during deposition and eventually reached a relatively constant (plateau) value above a certain thickness (typically > 50 nm). The measured values of plateau stress increased with overpotential, ranging from 25 to 45 MPa for - 125 to - 200 mV. In-situ AFM imaging showed nucleation of individual copper islands which grew in size and eventually coalesced forming grain boundaries. Coalescence and grain boundary formation coincided {{with an increase in}} tensile stress. Surface features smoothened during interruption of deposition and recovered to a roughened configuration upon resumption of deposition. This behaviour coincided with a recovery in stress and this has been attributed to reversible movement of adatoms between the surface and grain boundaries. Chloride ion significantly reduced tensile stress and produced rougher deposits than without additives. As roughness increased, stress decreased as was observed also for additive-free deposition. PEG alone had no significant effect on stress. However, PEG significantly enhanced stress reduction in the presence of chloride. A flat copper surface with scattered large pyramidal structures was produced. Three prototypes of ductility testers were developed, the latest of which employed an optical-lever method for determining the displacement of a freestanding nanofilm under load.

40|$|The {{success of}} silicon IC {{technology}} in producing {{a wide variety}} of microstructures relies heavily on the orientation dependant etching observed for silicon in alkaline media. Despite the rapid growth of this industry, the chemical and electrochemical mechanisms by which anisotropic etching occurs remain poorly understood. The most common etchant systems in use are ethylenediamine-pyrocatechol-water (EPW) and potassium hydroxide-isopropanol-water (KOH-IPA), and whilst these systems are highly plane selective they each have distinct disadvantages. The occurrence of inhomogeneities such as micropyramids and pits on the surface of etched substrates is a particularly disadvantageous characteristic of many alkaline etching systems. A complete understanding of the chemical and electrochemical anisotropic etching mechanisms is essential in order to obtain more reproducible etching, improved etch rate ratios and the development of more reliable etching baths. Wet chemical etching experiments to evaluate the etching rates for the different alkali metal cations have shown that similar etch rates are observed for LiOH, NaOH and KOH but those of RbOH and CsOH are significantly lower. The presence of impurities was shown to worsen the etched wafer's surface finish obtained in these etching <b>baths.</b> <b>Additives</b> have been shown to dramatically improve the surface finish with the presence of IPA in conjunction with etchant oxygenation virtually eliminating all surface defects. Electrochemical experiments were used to assess the electrochemical behaviour of Si p-(100) in of {{a wide variety of}} etchants and variations were seen according to the etchant used. A. C impedance spectroscopy showed a variation in the flat-band potential (V_F_B) according to alkali metal hydroxide etchant used. These trends were similarly observed in the presence of isopropanol. Oxygenation was observed to reproducibly alter the flat-band potentials. A. c impedance spectroscopic studies additionally confirmed the presence of surface states at the interface resulting in Fermi level pinning. Whilst the mechanisms of etching appear to be similar for LiOH, NaOH and KOH, those of RbOH and CsOH appear to be different or more complex.

40|$|Magnetic fields {{parallel}} to electrodes were introduced during plating process to prepare cobalt films from <b>baths</b> without <b>additives.</b> Effects of magnetic intensities on the nucleation process, electrochemical mechanism and surface morphology were investigated. It {{was found that}} limiting current and deposition mass increased gradually with the rise in magnetic intensities. Magnetohydrodynamic phenomenon (magnetic fields can induce currents in a moving conductive fluid, which in turn creates forces on the fluid and also changes the magnetic field itself) caused by Lorentz forces could agitate to decrease thickness of diffusion layers, which contribute {{to the increase in}} deposition rate. Reduction of cobalt on copper substrates without magnetic fields showed instantaneous nucleation process. However, cobalt reduction with 1 T magnetic intensity deviated from instantaneous nucleation process as a result of micromagnetohydrodynamic (micro-MHD) flows. Films of smaller grain size and compact surface could be obtained under 1 T magnetic intensity as a result of MHD effects...|$|R
