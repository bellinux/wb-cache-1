60|$|This <b>boiling</b> <b>spring,</b> as {{they called}} it, was a {{beautiful}} spring, from which fine cool water was always boiling {{up out of the}} sand. It was in a narrow glen, shaded by trees, and the water running down into a little sort of meadow, kept the grass green there, even in very dry times; so that the cows were very fond of this spot.|$|E

60|$|By {{this time}} the boys came to the bars that led into the pasture, and they went in and began to look about for the cows.

60|$|They went {{not only}} to the <b>boiling</b> <b>spring,</b> but up and down so many wild, {{woodland}} paths that had been cut for the adornment of the Carmel Springs, and so well pleased were both parties, that it was supper-time before they reappeared on the lawn; and, when they did appear, Lillie was leaning confidentially on John's arm, with a wreath of woodbine in her hair that he had arranged there, wondering all the while at his own wonderful boldness, and at the grace of the fair entertainer.|$|E

50|$|People began {{settling}} {{the area around}} the namesake <b>boiling</b> <b>springs</b> in 1843. The first families to settle were the Hamricks, the Greenes and the McSwains. It was only appropriate that the settlement be named <b>Boiling</b> <b>Springs.</b> One of the first buildings was <b>Boiling</b> <b>Springs</b> Baptist Church, built in 1847 about 100 yards from the <b>springs.</b> <b>Boiling</b> <b>Springs</b> was known as a sleepy community, with no railroads, no industries, few stores and no paved streets. At the turn of the 20th century Kings Mountain Baptist and Sandy Run Associations began {{looking for a place to}} build their denominational high school and chose <b>Boiling</b> <b>Springs</b> because it was geographically situated between the two associations and because the <b>Boiling</b> <b>Springs</b> community made concerted efforts to attract the school. The <b>Boiling</b> <b>Springs</b> High School boarding institution opened for business in 1905. School authorities felt that neither intoxicating drinks nor cigarettes should be sold near the school, so in 1911 the town was incorporated in order to ban the sale of such items. Town limits were decided by drawing a mile and a half radius from the school's original bell tower.|$|R
60|$|An unaccountable horror {{suddenly}} {{swept over}} the watching man. His hair stood straight up; a sensation as of cold stole chillingly over him. Whether {{it was the}} climax of this long night's excitement, or anticipation of the bloody struggle soon to come, he knew not. Did this <b>boiling</b> <b>spring,</b> shimmering in the sliver moon-rays, hold in its murky depths a secret? Did these lonesome, shadowing trees, with their sad drooping branches, harbor a mystery? If a future tragedy was to be enacted here in this quiet glade, could the murmuring water or leaves whisper its portent? No; they were only silent, only unintelligible with nature's mystery.|$|E
6000|$|Now {{the trunks}} of trees on the bottom, and the old log canoe, and the dark {{surrounding}} woods, are gone, and the villagers, who scarcely know where it lies, {{instead of going to}} the pond to bathe or drink, are thinking to bring its water, which should be as sacred as the Ganges at least, to the village in a pipe, to wash their dishes with!--to earn their Walden by the turning of a cock or drawing of a plug! That devilish Iron Horse, whose ear-rending neigh is heard throughout the town, has muddied the <b>Boiling</b> <b>Spring</b> with his foot, and he it is that has browsed off all the woods on Walden shore, that Trojan horse, with a thousand men in his belly, introduced by mercenary Greeks!

60|$|Mono Lake is {{a hundred}} miles in a {{straight}} line from the ocean--and between it and the ocean are one or two ranges of mountains--yet thousands of sea-gulls go there every season to lay their eggs and rear their young. One would as soon expect to find sea-gulls in Kansas. And in this connection let us observe another instance of Nature's wisdom. The islands in the lake being merely huge masses of lava, coated over with ashes and pumice-stone, and utterly innocent of vegetation or anything that would burn; and sea-gull's eggs being entirely useless to anybody unless they be cooked, Nature has provided an unfailing spring of boiling water on the largest island, and you can put your eggs in there, and in four minutes you can boil them as hard as any statement I have made during the past fifteen years. Within ten feet of the <b>boiling</b> <b>spring</b> is a spring of pure cold water, sweet and wholesome.|$|E

60|$|The pond was my well ready dug. For {{four months}} in the year its water is as cold as it is pure at all times; and I {{think that it is}} then as good as any, if not the best, in the town. In the winter, all water which is exposed to the air is colder than springs and wells which are {{protected}} from it. The temperature of the pond water which had stood in the room where I sat from five o'clock in the afternoon till noon the next day, the sixth of March, 1846, the thermometer having been up to 65º or 70º some of the time, owing partly to the sun on the roof, was 42º, or one degree colder than the water of one of the coldest wells in the village just drawn. The temperature of the <b>Boiling</b> <b>Spring</b> the same day was 45º, or the warmest of any water tried, though it is the coldest that I know of in summer, when, beside, shallow and stagnant surface water is not mingled with it. Moreover, in summer, Walden never becomes so warm as most water which is exposed to the sun, on account of its depth. In the warmest weather I usually placed a pailful in my cellar, where it became cool in the night, and remained so during the day; though I also resorted to a spring in the neighborhood. It was as good when a week old as the day it was dipped, and had no taste of the pump. Whoever camps for a week in summer by the shore of a pond, needs only bury a pail of water a few feet deep in the shade of his camp to be independent of the luxury of ice.|$|E

5000|$|On December 2, 1905, the <b>Boiling</b> <b>Springs</b> High School was {{chartered}} as {{a result}} of an initiative sponsored by the Kings Mountain Baptist Association (Cleveland County) and the Sandy Run Baptist Association (Rutherford County).

The town of <b>Boiling</b> <b>Springs</b> is named after the natural springs that can be found on campus. They provided clean water for the school when it began operation in 1907.|$|R
