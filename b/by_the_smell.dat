5|$|The crop can be {{attacked}} by larvae of the carrot fly (Chamaepsila rosae). This pest feeds {{on the outer}} layers of the root, burrowing its way inside later in the season. Seedlings may be killed while larger roots are spoiled. The damage done provides a point of entry for fungal rots and canker. The fly is attracted <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>smell</b> of bruised tissue.|$|E
5|$|The {{onion fly}} (Delia antiqua) lays eggs on {{the leaves and}} stems {{and on the ground}} close to onion, shallot, leek, and garlic plants. The fly is {{attracted}} to the crop <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>smell</b> of damaged tissue and is liable to occur after thinning. Plants grown from sets are less prone to attack. The larvae tunnel into the bulbs and the foliage wilts and turns yellow. The bulbs are disfigured and rot, especially in wet weather. Control measures may include crop rotation, the use of seed dressings, early sowing or planting, and the removal of infested plants.|$|E
5|$|The White House is {{the oldest}} {{building}} on President's Park. An {{integral part of the}} planned city that is Washington, D.C., a design was chosen and construction begun in 1792, and the building (although unfinished) was opened for occupancy on November 1, 1800. The first people to occupy the building were President John Adams and his wife, Abigail. Parts of the mansion were unfinished, including the cavernous East Room. With no running water (it was not installed until 1834), water had to be brought into the house by jug and heated for bathing or laundry to be done. Abigail Adams often hung the family's laundry up to dry in the drafty East Room. The ghost of Abigail Adams has been seen since shortly after her death in 1818, arms extended as if she were still carrying laundry into the East Room, accompanied <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>smell</b> of soap or damp clothing. Household staff in the Taft administration even observed her walking through walls.|$|E

5|$|Other {{spirits are}} also said {{to remain at}} The Octagon as well. Dolley Madison's spirit has been seen near the {{fireplace}} in the main ballroom as well as heading through a closed door to the garden, and her ghost's presence is accompanied <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>smell</b> of lilacs, her favorite flower. A slave girl {{in the house was}} allegedly thrown from the third floor landing to the first floor below and killed by a British soldier during the War of 1812, and eyewitnesses have reported hearing her scream. The specter of a British soldier in War of 1812 dress was seen by caretaker James Cypress in the 1950s, and museum superintendent Alric H. Clay claimed that in the 1960s spirits would often turn on the lights and open The Octagon's doors late at night. A gambler shot to death in the house's third-floor bedroom in the late 19th century has sometimes been seen still in the bed he died in, and ghostly footmen have been seen at the front door waiting to receive guests. He was said to have rung a bell shortly before his death and that the ring of the bell often heard in the house is from him. Various witnesses have also reported hearing assorted moans, screams, and footsteps.|$|E

Visitors were overwhelmed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>smell.</b> Later during the exhibition Noten showed a video of the decomposing process together with the pike's cleaned skeleton and the necklace itself. With The Revenge Noten is referring to the Zuiderzee fishermen's loathing of pearls as these were very popular with the nobility.|$|E

Because almost everything was destroyed, he taught Paetsch while sitting on potato crates {{in the ruins}} of the war, and as Hadelich's children (Sigismund and Valeska) were then babies, they were surrounded <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>smells</b> of diapers. Everything was done by heart, as there was no printed music to be found at this time of utter poverty and deprivation. Hadelich was as much a genius on the piano as on the cello.|$|R

He soon finds her cornered by Man's vicious hunting dogs, which he manages to ward off. Bambi, his father, Faline, and the forest animals manage to reach shelter on a riverbank. The following spring, Faline gives birth to twins under Bambi's watchful eye as the new Great Prince of the Forest.|$|E
25|$|The Imperial Family {{were not}} the only {{residents}} of the palace; below the metal framework in the attics lived an army of servants. So vast were the servants' quarters that a former servant and his family, unbeknownst to the palace authorities, moved into the roof of the palace. They were only discovered <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>smell</b> of the manure from the cow that they had also smuggled into the building with them to provide fresh milk. It seems this cow was not the only bovine in the attics; other cows were kept next to the room occupied by the Maids of Honour, in order to provide fresh milk for the kitchens. This practice was discontinued after the 1837 fire.|$|E

'It is a King cobra, and you have not killed it' replied Eha. The snake was put in a crate and sent to the BNHS with the note 'It may not survive the journey.

There he encounters Tsume, Hige and Toboe, three other wolves who were drawn to Freeze City by {{the scent of the}} Lunar Flower and are now living in the city. The wolves encounter Quent Yaiden, a former Sheriff of Kyrios who is obsessed with hunting down wolves, and his dog Blue. Cheza, the Flower Maiden who is destined to lead the wolves to Paradise, is being studied at a laboratory under the care of Cher Degré.

25|$|For {{the most}} part {{carnivorous}} plant populations are not dominant enough to be dramatically significant, ecologically speaking, {{but there is an}} impressive variety of organisms that interact with various carnivorous plants in sundry relationships of kleptoparasitism, commensalism, and mutualism. For example, small insectivores such as tree frogs often exploit the supply of prey to be found in pitcher plants, and the frog Microhyla nepenthicola actually specialises in such habitats. Certain crab spiders such as Misumenops nepenthicola live largely on the prey of Nepenthes, and other, less specialised, spiders may build webs where they trap insects attracted <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>smell</b> or appearance of the traps; some scavengers, detritivores, and also organisms that harvest or exploit those in turn, such as the mosquito Wyeomyia smithii are largely or totally dependent on particular carnivorous plants. Plants such as Roridula species combine with specialised bugs (Pameridea roridulae) in benefiting from insects trapped on their leaves.|$|E
25|$|The {{number of}} {{casualties}} totaled 146 people, including 109 women and 37 men ranging {{from the age of}} two months to 81 years. 34 were burned alive in the Davoudis house, 76 were killed in the bakery, 34 were shot or stabbed in their homes or outside the village. Following the destruction of Chortiatis, the Axis forces returned to their bases in Asvestochori and Thessaloniki. Fearing the return of the penal expedition and repulsed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>smell</b> emanating from the corpses, the surviving inhabitants of Chortiatis hid in the surrounding forest. Two days later Schubert's men returned to the village to strip it of what little they had left on their previous visit. The Chortiatis massacre was not mentioned in any form in the contemporary German documents. Similarly, during course of the Nuremberg trials, then chief of staff of Army Group E Wilhelm Hammer, only referred to the ambush preceding the massacre. None of the Germans responsible for the massacre were ever convicted of their crimes. Many of them continued to advance their careers {{in the years that followed}} the war: Army Group E intelligence officer Kurt Waldheim later became the ninth President of Austria. Schubert on the other hand was arrested in the aftermath of the war, tried and executed in Athens.|$|E
2500|$|Johan Hoghusen, a wine trader who immigrated from Westphalia in 1620, {{lived on}} Number 44, just as did {{his son and}} namesake who was raised to peerage and {{appointed}} county governor, and for several centuries the building continued to be leavened <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>smells</b> of liquor. [...] The milliner's shop Lamberg, founded in 1877 <b>by</b> <b>the</b> then 21 years old Augusta Lamberg from Gothenburg, was located over the punch manufacture of J G Grönstedt in the basement, and, as the story goes, the vapours from the latter attracted customers to the former.

40|$|In the 1880 s Melbourne was a {{study in}} contrasts. It was the fastest growing city in the British Empire {{and one of the}} most prosperous, writes John Legge in The Age.. It was also the smelliest, with an appalling infant {{mortality}} rate and up to 3 per cent of the rest of the population dying of typhoid every year. Melbourne has a superb public transport infrastructure - for 1935. The economists and the germ theory deniers said that this was the way things were, and the best thing to do was to do nothing.

25|$|Ancient DNA {{supports}} {{the hypothesis that}} dog domestication preceded the emergence of agriculture and was initiated close to the Last Glacial Maximum 27,000 YBP when hunter-gatherers preyed on megafauna, and when proto-dogs might {{have taken advantage of}} carcasses left on site by early hunters, assisted in the capture of prey, or provided defense from large competing predators at kill-sites. Wolves were probably attracted to human campfires <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>smell</b> of meat being cooked and discarded refuse in the vicinity, first loosely attaching themselves and then considering these as part of their home territory where their warning growls would alert humans to the approach of outsiders. The wolves most likely drawn to human camps were the less-aggressive, subdominant pack members with lowered flight response, higher stress thresholds, less wary around humans, and therefore better candidates for domestication. The earliest sign of domestication in dogs was the neotonization of skull morphology and the shortening of snout length that results in tooth crowding, reduction in tooth size, and a {{reduction in the number of}} teeth, which has been attributed to the strong selection for reduced aggression. This process may have begun during the initial commensal stage of dog domestication, even before humans began to be active partners in the process.|$|E
500|$|Petrels can be {{attracted}} to boats with [...] "chum", a malodorous mixture typically containing fish heads, bones and offal, with added fish oil and popcorn to aid flotation. An apparently empty ocean will soon fill with hundreds of birds attracted <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>smell.</b> The attraction of the fishy odour is sometimes enhanced {{by the addition of}} dimethylsulphide (DMS) a chemical also naturally produced by some planktonic organisms, although there are doubts about the safety of this possible carcinogen.|$|E
500|$|Other {{minerals}} such as topaz contain fluorine. Fluorides, {{unlike other}} halides, are insoluble {{and do not}} occur in commercially favorable concentrations in saline waters.

500|$|Cats have {{an acute}} sense of smell, {{due in part}} to their {{well-developed}} olfactory bulb and a large surface of olfactory mucosa, about [...] in area, which is about twice that of humans. Cats are sensitive to pheromones such as 3-mercapto-3-methylbutan-1-ol, which they use to communicate through urine spraying and marking with scent glands. Many cats also respond strongly to plants that contain nepetalactone, especially catnip, as they can detect that substance at less than one part per billion. [...] About 70–80% of cats are affected by nepetalactone. This response is also produced by other plants, such as silver vine (Actinidia polygama) and the herb valerian; it may be caused <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>smell</b> of these plants mimicking a pheromone and stimulating cats' social or sexual behaviors.|$|E
