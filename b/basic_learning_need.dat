40|$|Context: During clerkships, {{teaching}} and learning in day-to-day activities occur in many moments of interaction among doctors, patients, peers and other co-workers. How people talk with one another influences their identity, their position {{and what they are}} allowed to do. This paper focuses on the opportunities and challenges of such moments of interaction between doctors and students during a clerkship characterised by short supervisory relationships. Methods: This study was conducted in a 10 -week internal medicine clerkship. Nine students and 10 doctors who worked with these nine students participated by regularly describing moments of interaction, using dictaphones. We performed critical discourse analysis of material sourced from a total of 184 audio diary entries and seven student debriefing interviews to reveal how participants discursively shaped the way they could think, speak and conduct themselves. Results: The ways in which doctors and students posed and answered questions represented a recurrent and influential feature in the diaries. This Question and Answer dynamic revealed six discourses of <b>Basic</b> <b>Learning</b> <b>Need,</b> Care and Attention, Power Game, Exchange of Currency, Distance, and Equality and Reciprocity. These discourses and the interplay among them revealed both students' and doctors' frameworks of needs and expectations in a culturally defined power structure. The interplay among the discourses reflected the ways in which doctor-student interactions afforded meaningful contributions to their medical or educational practice such as in the exchange of authentic professional or personal experience. Conclusions: By purposefully bringing power structures to the surface, we have addressed the complexity of learning and teaching as it occurs in day-to-day moments of interaction in a clerkship with little continuity in supervision. Both doctors and students should be supported to reflect critically on how they contribute to supervisory relationships with reference to, for example, {{the ways in which they}} ask or answer questions. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd...|$|E

40|$|Abstract]: According to the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation's (2000) 'Education for All' goals, all {{students}} are entitled to opportunities to fulfil their potential. This implies that appropriate programs {{need to be in}} place for all children, especially gifted Aboriginal students. Accordingly, this means that all educational institutions in Australia have an obligation to provide involvement and commitment opportunities for all gifted and talented Aboriginal students in meeting their <b>basic</b> <b>learning</b> <b>needs.</b> This goal is not being achieved within Australia. Gifted and talented Aboriginal students have been identified as the most educationally disadvantaged group in the Australian education system (Sydney Morning Herald, 2004). Education for Aboriginal learners varies throughout the states of Australia. While New South Wales has provided excellent modelling of accommodating for inclusion of gifted Aboriginal students, in Queensland the lower representation of Indigenous students in gifted programs suggests inappropriate facilitation. This discussion paper compares and contrasts New South Wales and Queensland gifted Indigenous educational policy, exploring the issues of appropriate identification and programs for gifted Aboriginal students, Aboriginal learning styles {{and the role of the}} classroom teacher in accommodating these students. ...|$|R

Quality education assures sustainable acquisition of knowledge, be it intellectual or practical capable of developing the individual and contributes to national and global development. The process of providing quality education begins with proper planning for financial, human and physical resources and curriculum. This involves all the stakeholders and it is incorporated in the teaching/learning process. The focus on education quality is normally at the heart of efforts aimed at improving the performance of education sectors. Quality is what attracts learners, satisfies their <b>basic</b> <b>learning</b> <b>needs,</b> and enriches their life and their overall experience of living. Governments and all other partners must work together to ensure quality of education for all, regardless of gender, wealth, location, language, ethnic, social or cultural origin.

40|$|In {{the light}} of {{worldwide}} commitments to meet global <b>basic</b> <b>learning</b> <b>needs</b> made at the 1990 United Nations Conference on Education for All (EFA) in Jomtien, the 2000 World Education Forum in Dakar and the 2000 United Nations Millennium Summit in New York, UNESCO has established a Working Group on Debt Swaps for Education which has met on two occasions so far, in 2006 and 2007. Drawing on experiences of bilateral donors such as Spain and Germany, this UNESCO Working Group is now promoting debt-for-education swaps, constructions whereby external debt is cancelled by the creditor {{in exchange for the}} debtor government’s commitment to mobilise domestic resources for education sector spending. The experience with debt swaps in the mid 1990 s was, however, far from positive, and recent improved insight in the economics of debt relief suggests extreme caution. In reviewing debt-for-education swaps between Germany and Indonesia and between Spain and El Salvador, this paper examines to what extent these second- generation debt swaps differ from their contested predecessors. We argue that, while the Paris Declaration’s principles of policy and system alignment appear to have been fairly well implemented on education sector level in both case studies considered, it is mainly the macro-economic nature of such swaps that remains problematic. For debt relief to hold at least some promise of translating into an efficient and effective instrument of development, it should be large and comprehensive, {{as in the case of}} the HIPC Initiative and its successor the MDRI. ...|$|R

In 1990, at Jomtien again tried to define the content basic education and {{how it should be}} delivered. ‘Basic education’ is defined as ‘action designed to meet ‘basic learning needs’. ‘primary schooling’ is considered as ‘the main delivery system of basic education’.

The report gives an outline of the educational system in Mauritius and its socio-cultural background, before it sets out to discuss {{the role of the}} most important trade union (GTU) within the primary education sector. Although Mauritius has achieved commendable success in providing universal access to basic education through very high enrolment rates and gender equality in education at primary and secondary level through its well-established education system, many sources of educational inequalities exist regarding educational inputs, processes and outcomes, and when meeting <b>basic</b> <b>learning</b> <b>needs</b> and assuring minimum level of competencies for all. The performance in learning cannot be properly understood unless taking into account the difficult and complex language situation that exists in Mauritius. It should be noted that for the great majority of the children, the language of learning and teaching was not their mother tongue. This is related to the fact that most children speak Kreol, a lingua franca, which is not a written language, while most teaching and learning is related to two ‘foreign languages’ such as French and English. There is also a good number of children in rural areas whose mother tongue is Hindi or rather Bhojpuri, an oral dialect of the former, who may be disadvantaged towards the means of instruction in primary schools that would influence learning achievements. One can just imagine what sort of difficulties these children encounter when faced with the challenge of learning two ‘foreign’ languages as from the age of five when they commence primary school. Another important findings which is far from new knowledge is that socio-economic status of the child’s family has a very strong impact on achievement at school. This confirm that parental education level and parents’ opinion about education are decisive factors affecting performance of the children at school...|$|R
40|$|The 1990 World Conference on Education for All in Jomtien {{reaffirmed the}} {{commitment}} of countries to meet <b>basic</b> <b>learning</b> <b>needs</b> of all children, youths and adults. Specific goals, {{in the light of}} which countries agreed to establish national targets, included universal access to and completion of basic education by the year 2000 and the reduction of adult illiteracy, with specific emphasis on eliminating gender disparities in educational opportunities. However, problems of economic stagnation, continued population growth and economic and social disparities both among and within nations have posed various challenges to making this a reality. A decade has passed since Jomtien. What progress has been accomplished towards the goal of education for all? Is it possible to quantify the impact of demography on public policy, particularly on education? To what extent did policies directed towards universal access to primary education, the elimination of gender gaps and increasing net primary school enrolment ratios succeed in overcoming the challenges of population dynamics and resource constraints? Which policies have been the most effective and what can countries learn from the experience of others? This paper examines what has been accomplished and what remains to be done, first from a global perspective and then with a focus on the less developed regions where the demographic transition is still underway and where universal basic education is still far from reality. Changes in enrolment ratios, literacy rates, gender disparities, public investment in education, as well as shortages in educational provision and inadequate conditions of learning are considered against the backdrop of demographic changes. Regional figures, however, hide considerable variations within regions and even within countries, masking important differences in policies. In order to detect these variations, the situation of individual countries is presented for some specific issues. The relative success of national policies in meeting EFA goals is also examined through a comparison of the E- 9 countrie...|$|R
40|$|A inclusão em educação não se restringe à visão multifacetada da deficiência. Ela se constitui na dialética exclusão/inclusão, fazendo-se parte constitutiva da exclusão. Sabe-se que a antinomia exclusão/inclusão significa o direito à satisfação das necessidades básicas de aprendizagem, a eliminação das barreiras à aprendizagem e a participação de todos no sistema educativo. Entende-se que isso só ocorrerá quando direcionar-se o pensamento para o desenvolvimento de culturas, para a construção de políticas e para a orquestração de práticas inclusivas. Essas três dimensões são necessárias ao (des) envolvimento inclusivo dentro de qualquer escola que pretenda tornar-se inclusiva. O objetivo desse trabalho é mostrar a necessidade de {{discutir}} acerca da relação exclusão/inclusão, das diferenças vistas como a especificidade do ser humano e da afetividade, aspecto imprescindível para a aprendizagem. A gestão da afetividade positiva predispõe a ação e a reação em diferentes situações, fazendo com que o aluno "sinta" a aprendizagem, despertando o interesse em aprender e, assim, eliminando o fracasso escolar nas crianças de classes populares. Consequentemente, a tríade afetividade - aprendizagem - inclusão é vital para o processo educativo. Esse trabalho foi concretizado em 2009, em estudos realizados no grupo Laboratório de Pesquisa, Estudos e Apoio à Participação e à Diversidade em Educação - LaPEADE/UFRJ, e tem relação com o período das obras teóricas consultadas e o tema desenvolvido.

It is understood that this will only occur once we direct the thought for the development of cultures, the construction of policies and the structuring practices for inclusion.

The objective of this work is to show the necessity to discuss the relationship exclusion/inclusion, the differences seen as specificities of the human being and the affectivity, which is an essential aspect for learning. The management of the positive affectivity predisposes the action and the reaction in different situations. It makes the pupil "feel" the learning, rousing the interest in learning, and eliminating the school failure in the children from lower social classes.

Qualitative data indicate that teachers were willing to integrate technology, but many felt ill prepared or unsupported to change their practice. ^ The results of this study may determine specific needs and barriers that must be addressed to advance the use of technology in education. This information may benefit districts as work to support teachers in their efforts to integrate technology into teaching and learning. ...|$|R

NursingBibliography: leaves 87 - 95 The {{purpose of}} this study was to assess the <b>learning</b> <b>needs</b> and self- {{efficacy}} of 41 patients with chronic low back pain (CLBP), in an outpatient pain treatment clinic in St. John's, Newfoundland, and to examine relationships between perceived <b>learning</b> <b>needs,</b> pain-related self-efficacy, demographic and injury-related factors. Knowles' (1980) adult learning theory and Bandura's (1977) self-efficacy theory guided this study. <b>Learning</b> <b>needs</b> were assessed using the patient <b>learning</b> <b>needs</b> scale (PLNS) and self-efficacy was measured using the self-efficacy scale, developed by Long et al. (1989 a). [...] Patients in this study reported having many <b>learning</b> <b>needs</b> in order to manage their own care at home. Of most importance to these subjects was information about treatments and complications, medications and enhancing quality of life. <b>Learning</b> <b>needs</b> were associated with education level, pain experienced "most of the time" and distress experienced "most of the time". As a group, subjects reported low self-efficacy fa all three self-efficacy subscales- pain, function and other symptoms. The lowest scores were reported for pain self-efficacy. Self-efficacy was associated with education level and distress experienced by the patient at the time of interview. A statistically significant inverse relationship was found between <b>learning</b> <b>needs</b> and self-efficacy. This relationship was particularly evident between <b>learning</b> <b>needs</b> and function self- efficacy with a correlation of - 0. 70. These findings have implications for nursing practice and future research...|$|R
