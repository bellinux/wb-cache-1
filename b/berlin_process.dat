40|$|Irrigation {{agriculture}} is {{of a major}} socio-economic importance for the Central Asian countries Afghanistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. Remote agricultural areas, the lack of harmonized agricultural statistics, the intensification of agriculture combined with water scarcity as well as unsustainable water use management make the integrated and combined use of Remote Sensing and Web GIS a very valuable technique for crop monitoring and to support the mitigation of those problems. Thus, within {{the frame of the}} Central Asian Water project (CAWa), a web-based mapping platform, the Water Use Efficiency Monitor in Central Asia (WUEMoCA), is being currently developed. It is comprised of a coherent and automated interdisciplinary processing chain starting from the automated download of Terra MODIS data and the computation of NDVI time series. A subsequent land use classification and crop yield estimation via machine learning algorithms for image processing provides a retrospective crop inventory for all years between 2000 and 2016 so far. Parallely, the near-real time early estimation of the current agricultural vegetation condition provides information about phenological anomalies and drought-affected regions. The systematic storage of these large amounts of processed multitemporal MODIS data requires the deployment of a spatial database with supportive raster analysis functionalities such as PostgreSQL/PostGIS in which all results are spatially aggregated on administrative levels such as water use associations, state districts and state provinces. Morover, the connectivity between a GeoServer and PostGIS is natively integrated, allowing for the automatic creation of Web Map Services (WMS) directly from the database. Interactive maps are visualized in a client application based on the mapping framework OpenLayers which is tailored for the specific needs of Central Asian water management. This makes a web-based presentation of all results possible. At last, the use of a PostGIS database also provides the possibility to establish a land use indicator system for all administrative levels with secondary information such as land use coefficient, crop diversity, land use intensity and irrigated crop acreage.

5000|$|German {{unification}} did {{not disappear}} from the political agenda after the disappointments of 1848/49. [...] Initially Cornelius supported the [...] "Großdeutschland" [...] solution which foresaw a united German state that would be administered from Vienna and incorporate {{those parts of the}} Austrian empire where German language and culture predominated. This raised various difficult issues because of the multi-national multi-ethnic nature of Austro-Hungary, however, and when unification actually took place it was based on a [...] "Kleindeutschland" [...] model, creating a smaller German state, completely excluding catholic Austria, with much power devolved to the regions, and national control exercised not from Vienna but from <b>Berlin.</b> The <b>process</b> of creating this new German state was deftly choreographed by Chancellor Bismarck: after 1866 Cornelius abandoned his support for [...] "Großdeutschland", becoming a huge admirer of Bismarck's approach to the unification challenge.

It was marked by the establishment of provisional local authorities, carried out by the representative of the Serbian government in the Supreme Army Command. In the second phase permanent local institutions were established in the New Areas in order to harmonize their administrative and judicial structure with that of pre-war Serbia. In the third phase the agrarian reform was carried out in order to abolish feudal relations, while protecting the property rights of the former Muslim land­owners in compliance with Article 39 of the Berlin Treaty. In the fourth phase the question of resettling the "New Serbian Areas" was being resolved after the significant population change brought about by the Second Serbo-Turkish War.
