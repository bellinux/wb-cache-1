5|$|Inverlyon was {{a fishing}} smack of 59 tons burthen {{that was a}} part of the fishing fleet at Lowestoft on the Suffolk coast. The wooden <b>boat</b> <b>had</b> a flush deck, two masts, and no engine. Inverlyons sails were fore-and-aft rigged and may have been red ochre in colour, the {{traditional}} sail colour for British smacks.|$|E
5|$|On June 16, 2012, {{a revival}} of the musical by Lyric Opera of Chicago was {{broadcast}} by WFMT-Radio of Chicago. This production of Show Boat reinstated the songs Mis'ry's Comin' Round, Till Good Luck Comes My Way and Hey, Feller!. It marked the first time a virtually complete version of Show <b>Boat</b> <b>had</b> ever been broadcast on radio.|$|E
5|$|The {{remaining}} {{boats were}} filled {{much closer to}} capacity and in an increasing rush. No.11 was filled with five people more than its rated capacity. As it was lowered, it was nearly flooded by water being pumped out of the ship. No.13 narrowly avoided the same problem but those aboard were unable to release the ropes from which the <b>boat</b> <b>had</b> been lowered. It drifted astern, directly under No.15 as it was being lowered. The ropes were cut in time and both boats made it away safely.|$|E
50|$|To this day, {{the design}} for the Swan <b>Boat</b> <b>has</b> changed very little. The <b>boats</b> <b>have</b> been {{periodically}} replaced throughout the years, and the current fleet operates with six <b>boats.</b> Each <b>boat</b> <b>has</b> kept the original design, with two pontoons, a brass seat atop a paddlebox concealed by a fiberglass swan, and wooden benches for passengers. However, more rows of benches have been added over the years. Five of the <b>boats</b> <b>have</b> six rows, each row holding about three to four adults, and the oldest <b>boat</b> <b>has</b> five rows which seat two to three adults each. The boats {{range in age from}} roughly twenty to over ninety years old. The oldest boat in operation was built in 1918, and the newest was built in 1995.|$|R
5000|$|The first <b>boats</b> <b>had</b> been {{stricken}} in 1905. The remaining <b>boats</b> <b>had</b> been renamed in 1910 and 1914 as SM T 11 - SM T 65. S12, T 21, T 25, S 26, S 32, S 41, S 48, T 50 {{got lost}} by collisions or storm. The S 66-class <b>boats</b> <b>had</b> been renamed in 1914 as SM T 66 - SM T 89.|$|R
50|$|This model carries 7500 lb of ballast. The <b>boat</b> <b>has</b> a {{draft of}} 6.58 ft with the {{standard}} keel. The <b>boat</b> <b>has</b> a PHRF racing average handicap of 108 with a high of 108 and low of 108.|$|R
5|$|Two of {{her four}} funnels were removed, and the forward two were cut {{at an angle}} to {{resemble}} those of a German destroyer. The bow was packed with 4.5 tons of high explosives, which were set in concrete. It was decided that the explosive charge would be timed to detonate after the raiders had left the harbour. To prevent the Germans towing her away, the crew would open the ship's seacocks before abandoning the ship. Should she become disabled or sunk before getting to the dock, four motor launches had been detailed to take off the crew and put the commandos ashore. The charge would be reset to explode after the last <b>boat</b> <b>had</b> left.|$|E
5|$|U-28 sank by {{accident}} on 17 March 1944, at the U-boat pier in Neustadt. During a training exercise, the <b>boat</b> <b>had</b> passed under a dummy freighter used for target practice. The commander-in-training failed {{to note the}} position of the stationary freighter, and the U-boat's conning tower was ripped off. Water flooded the control room, but the other compartments remained intact. The crew escaped by slowly equalizing the water pressure in the boat and swimming to the surface. The boat was raised in March 1944, but was stricken on 4 August. The submarine's crew suffered no casualties during her career.|$|E
5|$|L/16 {{eventually}} landed, 30 minutes late, to {{the left}} of Fox Green, taking casualties as the boats ran in and more as they crossed the 200 yards (180m) of beach. The terrain at the very eastern end of Omaha gave them enough protection to allow the 125 survivors to organize and begin an assault of the bluffs. They were the only company in the first wave able to operate as a unit. All the other companies were, at best, disorganized, mostly leaderless and pinned down behind the shingle with no hope of carrying out their assault missions. At worst, they had ceased to exist as fighting units. Nearly all had landed at least a few hundred yards off target, and in an intricately planned operation where each section on each <b>boat</b> <b>had</b> been assigned a specific task, this was enough to throw the whole plan off.|$|E
50|$|This wing keel model carries 7500 lb of ballast. The <b>boat</b> <b>has</b> a {{draft of}} 5.00 ft with the wing keel. The <b>boat</b> <b>has</b> a PHRF racing average {{handicap}} of 102 with a high of 99 and low of 102.|$|R

50|$|The North Korean Navy {{deployed}} three torpedo boats {{the next}} day, prompting a deployment of two s by the South Koreans on 14 June. By this time, the North Koreans' patrol <b>boats</b> <b>had</b> crossed the NLL 52 times and their fishing <b>boats</b> <b>had</b> crossed 62 times.|$|R
5|$|The French {{submarine}} Mariotte (Q74) was {{a submarine}} {{built for the}} French Navy prior to World War I. Intended to accompany the fleet, she was designed for high speed on the surface. Although the navy was unsatisfied with her performance on the surface, the <b>boat</b> <b>had</b> a higher underwater speed than any French submarine before or during the following 35 years. Mariotte was plagued with engine problems during her construction and the navy spent years fixing the various issues before finally commissioning her five years after beginning construction. During the war, she participated in the Dardanelles Campaign, but had to be scuttled after she became entangled in the cables of a minefield on her first attempt to penetrate the Dardanelles.|$|E
5|$|Wragg {{agreed to}} Teach's demands, and a Mr. Marks and two pirates were given {{two days to}} collect the drugs. Teach moved his fleet, and the {{captured}} ships, to within {{about five or six}} leagues from land. Three days later a messenger, sent by Marks, returned to the fleet; Marks's <b>boat</b> <b>had</b> capsized and delayed their arrival in Charles Town. Teach granted a reprieve of two days, but still the party did not return. He then called a meeting of his fellow sailors and moved eight ships into the harbour, causing panic within the town. When Marks finally returned to the fleet, he explained what had happened. On his arrival he had presented the pirates' demands to the Governor and the drugs had been quickly gathered, but the two pirates sent to escort him had proved difficult to find; they had been busy drinking with friends and were finally discovered, drunk.|$|E
5|$|HMS Shannon {{had been}} off Boston for 56 days and was running short of provisions, whilst the {{extended}} period at sea {{was wearing the}} ship down. She would be at a disadvantage facing USS Chesapeake, fresh from harbour and a refit. A boat was despatched carrying the invitation, manned by a Mr Slocum, a discharged American prisoner. The <b>boat</b> <b>had</b> not reached the shore when Chesapeake was seen underway, sailing out of the harbour. She was flying three American ensigns and a large white flag at the foremast inscribed 'Free Trade and Sailor's Rights'. Shannon carried 276 officers, seamen and marines of her proper complement, eight recaptured seamen, 22 Irish labourers who had been 48 hours in the ship, of whom only four could speak English, and 24 boys, of whom about 13 were under 12 years of age. Broke had trained his gun crews to fire accurate broadsides into the hulls of enemy vessels, {{with the aim of}} killing their gun crews, rather than attempting to disable the enemy ship by firing at the masts and rigging. This was, however, the standard Royal Navy practise of the time, only Broke's efficiency in gunnery training distinguished him in this regard. Lawrence, meanwhile, was confident in his ship, especially since she carried a substantially larger crew. Previous American victories over Royal Navy ships left him expectant of success. Just before the engagement, the American crew gave three cheers.|$|E

5|$|On board Arctic, disquiet turned {{increasingly}} into panic as {{it became}} clear that lifeboat capacity was inadequate. Shortly after the port guard boat's departure, the port quarter boat, with around twelve women and five crew aboard, was being readied for lowering into the water when it, too, was rushed by members of the crew. In the general melee the boat was upended, sending all but three of its occupants into the water, where they drowned. On {{the other side of the}} ship, Luce ordered Second Officer Baalham to launch the starboard guard boat and proceed with it to the stern, where women and children passengers would be passed down. No sooner was it launched when it was overwhelmed by men, who leapt into the water and clambered into the boat; all but one of these were crew members. With his boat now full, Baalham disregarded Luce's instructions to pick up women and children, and drifted away. Meanwhile, the upended port quarter <b>boat</b> <b>had</b> been righted, but despite Luce's efforts to give women passengers priority, it was again rushed by crew and male passengers, who thrust aside the waiting women and cut the boat adrift from the ship while it was only partially filled.|$|E
5|$|Refusing to {{surrender}} until all options had been exhausted, Willoughby dispatched boats to Sirius, asking Pym if {{he believed it}} would be practical to send boats to tow Nereide out of range. Pym replied that with the boats engaged in attempting to tow Sirius and Magicienne off the reef {{it was not possible}} to deploy them under fire to tow Nereide. Pym also suggested that Willoughby disembark his men and set fire to his ship in the hope that the flames would spread to the French ships clustered on shore. Willoughby refused this suggestion as it was not practical to disembark the dozens of wounded men aboard Nereide in the growing darkness and refused to personally abandon his men when Pym ordered him to transfer to Sirius. At 11:00 pm, Willoughby ordered a boat to row to Bellone and notify the French commander that he had surrendered. However, Willoughby's <b>boat</b> <b>had</b> been holed by shot and was unable to make the short journey. The message was instead conveyed by French prisoners from Nereide who had dived overboard and reached the shore during the night. Recalling the false flags used on 20 August, Bouvet resolved to wait until morning before accepting the surrender.|$|E

25|$|The <b>boat</b> <b>had</b> {{accommodation}} for 14 people. Eight crewmates slept below decks {{in double}} berth cabins, while the cook had {{a private room}} by the galley on the main deck. Four private rooms for officers were on the engineer’s deck and the captain’s office and private bedroom was behind the pilothouse.|$|E
25|$|Around 5 am {{authorities}} {{started an}} investigation after an emergency {{call that a}} <b>boat</b> <b>had</b> capsized and bodies were coming ashore. The bodies of Kurdi and another child were discovered by two locals at around 6:30 am. The two men moved the bodies from the water, where Kurdi was later photographed by a Turkish press photographer.|$|E
25|$|Cuyahoga sank {{within two}} minutes of the {{collision}} in 58feet of water. The cutter's 14-foot utility <b>boat</b> <b>had</b> popped free of the sinking vessel and Boatswains Mate Roger Wild put the injured survivors in the boat. The un-injured clung {{to the sides of}} the boat until the freighter had returned to pick up survivors. 11 on board Cuyahoga were killed, but 18 survived.|$|E

50|$|The Brumaire {{class were}} Laubeuf type submarines, {{following}} the Laubeuf standard design of double hull and dual propulsion systems (as were the Pluviôse class). The Brumaire <b>boats</b> <b>had</b> electric motors for underwater propulsion, {{and are usually}} listed as having diesel engines for surface propulsion, though in practice this was mixed. While most had diesels several of the earlier <b>boats</b> <b>had</b> steam engines. These had been preferred by Laubeuf in the early stages, though later Laubeuf type submarines, such as the , predecessors to the Pluviôse and Brumaire classes, had used diesel engines, {{and some of the}} later Pluviôse <b>boats</b> <b>had</b> diesels.|$|R
25|$|A less {{significant}} victim of this engagement was {{the boat in}} which General Patton had intended to reach the beach from the flagship Augusta. The <b>boat</b> <b>had</b> been swung out on davits in preparation for launch when muzzle blast from the cruiser's 8-inch guns blew out {{the bottom of the}} boat, causing most of Patton's luggage to be lost overboard.|$|E

25|$|Commander John Lloyd recommissioned Podargus in November 1810. On 2 December Podargus was {{on station}} off Boulogne when her crew {{retrieved}} an abandoned, swamped Dutch boat. The <b>boat</b> <b>had</b> to be over-turned {{to bring her}} on board Podargus, but even so, money was found aboard her, amounting to 13 gold guineas, four half-guineas, and some silver French coins. Then in October 1811 Commander John Bradley replaced Lloyd.|$|E
