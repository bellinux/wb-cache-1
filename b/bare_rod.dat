40|$|Abstract — Flow induced {{vibrations}} are {{an important}} concern {{in the design of}} nuclear reactors. One of the possible designs of the 4 th generation nuclear reactors is a lead-cooled fast reactor of which MYYRHA is a prototype. The combination of high liquid density, flow velocity, low pitch-todiameter ratio and the absence of grid spacers makes this design prone to flow induced vibrations. Although most vibrations are induced by cross flow, axial flow around this slender structure could also induce vibrations. In order to gain insight in the possible vibrations (either induced by cross flow, axial flow or an external excitation) this study examines the change of eigenmodes and frequencies of a <b>bare</b> <b>rod</b> due to the lead-bismuth flow. To do so partitioned simulations of the fluid structure interaction are performed in which the structure is initially perturbed according to an in-air eigenmode...|$|E
40|$|Porous {{bodies that}} are {{resistant}} to corrosion at high temperatures and thermal shock may be produced from metallic fibers. In order to accomplish reasonable homogeneity and high porosity, the cross-sectional area of the fibers and the width of distribution thereof need to be small. This article studies two techniques for making fibers. Melt extraction out of a crucible yields filaments with a typical diameter ranging from 50 to 200 mu m, which is too thick. Also patented {{for a long time}} is the extraction from a pendant drop. Even though relatively fine fibers can be manufactured with this method, it never exceeded crucible extraction with respect to industrial importance owing to the low productivity of the process. The present article addresses the drawbacks of both variants of melt extraction of metallic filaments. Because metallic melts are electrically conducting, the use of magnetic fields allows for contactless process optimization. It is well believed that increasing the extraction speed diminishes the fiber diameter. Being not always true, at least in the case of crucible melt extraction, as indicated by the present findings, however, undesired fluid flow, i. e., turbulence, imposes an upper limit on the rotation rate of the extraction wheel. Application of a static magnetic field leads to both higher wheel speed and thinner filaments. The low productivity of extraction from the molten tip of a rod suffers from the fact that only one melt drawing edge can be used. As the <b>bare</b> <b>rod</b> is problematic with respect to heating its tip in contact with the extraction wheel, it is challenging to melt the entire edge of a sheet. A special design of the induction-heating magnetic field is also proposed to solve also this task...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{significantly}} increase the power density of Light Water Reactors (LWRs), the helical-cruciform (HC) fuel rod assembly {{has been proposed}} {{as an alternative to}} traditional fuel geometry. The HC assembly is a self-supporting nuclear fuel configuration consisting of 4 -finned, axially-twisted fuel rods closely packed against one another in a square array. Within the LWR core, HC fuel would in theory possess several inherent advantages over traditional fuel, potentially allowing for operation at a higher power density. Chief among these advantages are a larger surface-to-volume ratio, a shorter radial heat conduction path, and improved mixing characteristics. In previous work, computational models of the HC fuel assembly have been of limited accuracy due to the absence suitable correlations. To address needs within these subchannel analysis models, experimental measurements of rod bundle coolant mixing have been conducted with 4 x 4 arrays of HC test rods. The tests used the technique of a hot water tracer injection (at 95 °C) into a bulk flow of cold water (at 25 °C). Downstream temperature measurements were used to judge the rate of lateral cross-flow within the HC rod bundle. These tests were conducted at atmospheric pressure, and encompassed a range of mass fluxes from 1000 kg/m 2 s to 3500 kg/m 2 s, HC rod twist pitches of 200 cm, 100 cm, and 50 cm, and different hot water injection velocities and mixing lengths. Data from over 300 tests was analyzed, yielding a best fit correlation for use with any twist pitch, rod length, or coolant flow rate. Compared to the <b>bare</b> <b>rod</b> bundle, this correlation implies an enhancement in the intensity of turbulent interchange of 40 % brought about by the HC geometry, and a 1. 6 % forced diversion of axial flow per subchannel, per quarter-turn along the rod length. These parameters fit all data points considered within a standard deviation of 24 %. Stochastic error was limited to ± 16 % by the use of precise temperature sensors. By applying this empirical mixing model to the subchannel representation of a BWR core featuring the HC rod design, a need to increase the flow area of the edge subchannels was demonstrated. This prompted a slight re-design of the HC fuel rod cross-section in order to make room for small spacer protrusions at the duct wall, to increase flow to peripheral subchannels. The modification was accomplished by reducing fin length, but increasing the inner diameter to maintain the reference fuel volume. The water rod region was also adjusted to maintain the reference assembly hydrogen to uranium atom ratio. With this modification, the model predicted a 24 % allowable power uprate for the 200 cm twist pitch HC core. Inlet and exit enthalpies were maintained from the reference cylindrical-rod core. When applied to a PWR core of HC rods, also with a fixed power to flow ratio, this empirical mixing model predicted an allowable power uprate of 47 %, using traditional CHF correlations for cylindrical fuel. In subcooled conditions, CHF is known to be more sensitive to peaked areas of non-uniform heat-flux than in saturated two-phase flow conditions. Therefore power density gains will likely be dependent on {{the degree to which the}} rod twist would disrupt of nascent pockets of vapor; this effect should be further investigated experimentally. In order to further ascertain the potential gain in power density for the new design, an experiment must be carried out to obtain CHF data for the HC rod bundle. Two facilities with this aim were designed in great detail for BWR conditions: the first would operate using high pressure water at 7 MPa, and the alternate would use a relatively low pressure refrigerant at equivalent conditions. The appropriate scaling laws were applied, which resulted in the choice of R 134 a as the simulant fluid. The R 134 a facility was found to be possible to construct at a greatly reduced cost. by Thomas M. Conboy. Thesis (Ph. D.)

As its name indicates, it had a retractable fire screen in the back to protect the user's relatively exposed face from too much heat from the fireplace. The screen was usually made of a pleated or straight piece of heavy fabric, supported by crossed and sliding metallic supports. Many fire screen desks still exist, but the original screens have rarely survived. The metal supports or rods which extended the screens generally have been maintained with the desk.

40|$|The {{synthesis}} and chromatographic {{behavior of}} an analytical size mixed-mode bonded silica monolith was investigated. The monolith was functionalized by an in situ modification process of a <b>bare</b> silica <b>rod</b> with chloro(3 -cyanopropyl) dimethyl silane and chlorodimethyl propyl phenyl silane solutions. These ligands were selected {{in order to}} combine both resonance and nonresonance π-type bonding within a single separation environment. Selectivity studies were undertaken using n-alkyl benzenes and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in aqueous methanol and acetonitrile mobile phases to assess the methylene and aromatic selectivities of the column. The results fit with the linear solvent strength theory suggesting excellent selectivity of the column was achieved. Comparison studies were performed on monolithic columns that were functionalized separately with cyano and phenyl ligands, suggesting highly conjugated molecules were able to successfully exploit both of the π-type selectivities afforded by the two different ligands on the mixed-mode column...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of varying OH− ion concentration {{on the surface}} morphology of chemically deposited ZnO-SiO 2 nanostructures on glass substrate was investigated. The morphological features, phase structure, and infrared characteristics were examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), respectively. Results revealed that silica significantly changes the hexagonal morphology of <b>bare</b> ZnO <b>rod</b> to “pointed tips” when using low initial OH− precursor concentration. Increasing OH− ion concentration resulted in a “flower-like” formation of ZnO-SiO 2 and a remarkable change from “pointed tips” to “hemispherical tips” at the top surface of the rods. The surface capping of SiO 2 to ZnO leads {{to the formation of}} these “hemispherical tips. ” The infrared spectroscopic analysis showed the characteristics peaks of ZnO and SiO 2 as well as the Si-O-Zn band which confirms the formation of ZnO-SiO 2. Phase analysis manifested that the formed ZnO-SiO 2 is of wurtzite structure. Furthermore, a possible growth mechanism is proposed based on the obtained results...|$|R

40|$|We {{present the}} first {{experimental}} {{measurements of the}} isotropic and nematic phases of mixtures of thin, charged semiflexible fd virus, and thick, fd-PEG created by covalently grafting poly-(ethylene glycol) to the the surface of fd, rods. The fd-PEG is sterically stabilized and its phase behavior is independent of ionic strength. The fd is charged. Therefore, by varying the ionic strength of a mixture of fd and fd-PEG, only the effective diameter of the <b>bare</b> fd <b>rods</b> changes, subsequently varying the effective diameter ratio (d=D_fd-PEG/D_fd) from 3. 7 to 1. In solution, binary mixtures of fd and fd-PEG are shown to exhibit isotropic-nematic, isotropic-nematic-nematic and nematic-nematic coexisting phases with increasing concentration. We measure the binary phase diagrams {{as a function of}} composition, total concentration, and ionic strength. We find a lower critical point in the nematic-nematic coexistence region which has not been observed previously. These experimental results resolve a controversy in the literature concerning the evolution of the nematic-nematic phase separation with concentration. The experimental results are qualitatively described by a rescaled Onsager-type theory for the phase behavior of binary rod mixtures. Comment: shorter version. submitted to PR...|$|R

40|$|Plasmonic {{nanostructures}} can be {{engineered to}} take on unusual optical properties not found in natural materials. The optical responses of plasmonic materials are functions of the structural parameters and symmetry of the nanostructures, material parameters of the nanostructure and its surroundings and the incidence angle, frequency and polarization state of light. The scattering and hence the visibility of an object could be reduced by coating it with a plasmonic material. In this thesis, presented is an optical frequency scattering cancelation device composed of a silicon nanorod coated by a plasmonic gold nanostructure. The principle of operation was theoretically analyzed using Mie theory and the device design was verified by extensive numerical simulations. The device was fabricated {{using a combination of}} nanofabrication techniques such as electron beam lithography and focused ion beam milling. The optical responses of the scattering cancelation device and a control sample of <b>bare</b> silicon <b>rod</b> were directly visualized using near-field microscopy coupled with heterodyne interferometric detection. The experimental results were analyzed and found to match very well with theoretical prediction from numerical simulations thereby validating the design principles and our implementation. Plasmonic nanostructures could be engineered to exhibit unique optical properties such as Fano resonance characterized by narrow asymmetrical lineshape. We present dynamic tuning and symmetry lowering of Fano resonances in plasmonic nanostructures fabricated on flexible substrates. The tuning of Fano resonance was achieved by application of uniaxial mechanical stress. The design of the nanostructures was facilitated by extensive numerical simulations and the symmetry lowering was analyzed using group theoretical methods. The nanostructures were fabricated using electron beam lithography and optically characterized for various mechanical stress. The experimental results were in good agreement with the numerical simulations. The mechanically tunable plasmonic nanostructure could serve as a platform for dynamically tunable nanophotonic devices such as sensors and tunable filters...|$|R
40|$|Preliminary {{analysis}} of the cross-shaped spiral (CSS) fuel assembly suggests great thermal-hydraulic upside. According to computational models, the increase in rod surface area, combined {{with an increase in}} coolant turbulence and inter-channel mixing will allow for a greater than 25 % uprate in total core power, without loss of safety margin. Proper design of the rod dimensions can limit circumferential heat-flux to a peak-to-average ratio of 1. 88. Non-uniformities in heat flux due to its unusual geometry seem to particularly ally CSS fuel to the BWR core, where limiting conditions {{are less likely to be}} locally influenced. Furthermore, the increase in cooling surface and reduction in central pin thickness is expected to drop fuel centerline temperature an estimated 2000 C under nominal operating conditions, a reduction which rises to 3000 C at 125 % of nominal power conditions. In addition to these advantages, the absence of grid spacers within the CSS fuel assembly is expected to lower pressure losses, aiding natural convection and core stability. Spacers typically account for 25 - 30 % of the total core pressure drop. Experimental measurements of hydraulic: losses for 1. 5 -meter-long model CSS rods in 4 x 4 arrays show a larger pressure drop at the same flow velocity than for <b>bare</b> cylindrical <b>rods.</b> However, this results in a CSS-bundle turbulent friction factor which is only 90 % of the expected value given its hydraulic diameter. The effect of twist pitch on this pressure drop and friction factor is negligible in the range of twists examined. (cont.) Combined with the elimination of grid spacers, this results in a 40 % reduction in core hydraulic loss from the reference case (neglecting entrance and exit plates). All told, the use of CSS rods should reduce total core pressure drop at nominal power by 9 %, in spite of a reduction in core flow area. At 125 % of nominal power, this becomes a 16 % increase in pressure drop in comparison to the reference core at nominal power. by Thomas M. Conboy. Thesis (S. M.)
