She increased the tempo and urgency from the original recording, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>times</b> had difficulty in communicating with her band. Hill continued touring, including a set at the 6th Annual Jazz in the Gardens, in Miami Gardens, Florida in December. In Spring 2011, Hill performed at the Coachella Valley Music Festival, New Orleans Jazz Fest, and at The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas. In July 2011, Hill gave birth to her sixth child, Micah, her first not with Rohan Marley; the father remains publicly unknown.|$|E
5|$|In 1950, Ba Cụt was {{involved}} in a battle with another Hòa Hảo leader, Nguyễn Giác Ngộ. He was defeated and driven from the district of Chợ Mới in February, provoking Soái to attack Ngo. Ba Cụt then moved to Thốt Nốt and began attacking the civilians and the French forces there. The French saw the disagreements as an opportunity to divide the Hòa Hảo and gain an anti-Việt Minh ally, and offered material aid, which Ba Cụt accepted. Ba Cụt repeatedly made treaties with the French colonial forces to fight the Việt Minh in return for arms and money, but he broke his end of the bargain and sometimes fought the Cao Đài instead of the communists. He made five such deals with the French, but he abandoned his military responsibilities each time. It was said that Ba Cụt sometimes broke away with the encouragement of Soái, who was still allied to the French, but nevertheless is believed to have given Ba Cụt weapons to fight the French. The French continued to furnish him with supplies despite his disloyalty and unreliability because they lacked the personnel to patrol all of Vietnam but had spare equipment. Some historians have claimed Ba Cụt's anti-French activities were not taken seriously as he was able to pass through French checkpoints without incident. There are also reports that he was accompanied by French intelligence agents during periods when he was nominally opposed to the French. The other Hòa Hảo commanders generally had the same general outlook as Ba Cụt; they were stridently opposed to the Việt Minh due to Sổ's assassination, and sometimes fought alongside and received supplies from the French, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>times</b> they lapsed into apathy and refused to attack.|$|E

25|$|The {{cultural}} tradition of chewing gum {{seems to have}} developed through a convergent evolution process, as traces of this habit have arisen separately {{in many of the}} early civilizations. Each of the early precursors to chewing gum were derived from natural growths local to the region and were chewed purely out the instinctual desire to masticate. Early chewers did not necessarily desire to derive nutritional benefits from their chewable substances, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>times</b> sought taste stimuli and teeth cleaning or breath-freshening capabilities.|$|E
25|$|Dayna Mellanby, {{played by}} Josette Simon (series 3–4). The {{daughter}} of former dissident Hal Mellanby, Dayna {{is an expert}} in weapons technology. She is adept at designing mechanized weapons, but also appreciates the nobility of what she describes as more 'primitive' combat. Brave and loyal, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>times</b> reckless and naïve, she often successfully challenges men who are supposedly accomplished fighters. Her vendetta against Servalan (who murdered her father) motivates her to endorse Avon's fighting of the Federation.|$|E

25|$|In 1885, the Malta Post Office {{was set up}} and British stamps were {{no longer}} valid in Malta. A set of six {{definitive}} stamps along with several types of postal stationery were issued.

At some points from the 1880s to the 1980s, postage stamps were also valid for fiscal use, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>times</b> separate revenue stamps were issued.

In an interview with Woman's Day magazine, Lawrence said she was appointed to care for Corby, who had become increasingly mentally unstable and had watched Corby's condition deteriorate after she was imprisoned.|$|E
25|$|In 1862, Bishop John William Colenso of Natal {{published}} The Pentateuch and Book of Joshua Critically Examined, {{an analysis}} of the first five books of the Old Testament.

Outrage broke out within the Church of England, and the X network not only gave their support to Colenso, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>times</b> even dined with him to discuss his ideas.|$|E

25|$|The university's first {{director}} was Arthur Denning (1949–1952), who made important contributions to founding the university. In 1953, he {{was replaced by}} Philip Baxter, who continued as vice-chancellor when this position's title was changed in 1955. Baxter's dynamic, if authoritarian, management was central to the university's first 20 years. His visionary, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>times</b> controversial, energies saw the university grow from a handful to 15,000 students by 1968. The new vice-chancellor, Rupert Myers (1969–1981), brought consolidation and an urbane management style to a period of expanding student numbers, demand for change in university style and challenges of student unrest.|$|E
25|$|Al-Jazzar {{maintained}} a small naval force. In 1779, {{it consisted of}} two galiots and two zebecs. The vessels did not possess basic technical equipment and so al-Jazzar had such equipment, including compasses, stolen off French vessels. They were largely commissioned to thwart raids against the Syrian coast by Maltese buccaneers. By 1789, his naval squadron consisted of three galiots, one zebec and two Dalmatian boats that were based in Acre, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>times</b> were briefly anchored at Tyre, Sidon, Beirut, Tripoli or Latakia. Al-Jazzar also owned three trading ships that routinely traveled between Acre and Damietta, a port city in Egypt.|$|E

25|$|Liverpool F.C. Reserves is {{the reserve}} team of Liverpool. It {{is the most}} senior level of the Liverpool academy beneath the first team. In the summer of 2012, the whole English reserve {{football}} system was overhauled and replaced with an Under 21 league system, the Professional Development League. Liverpool's Reserve team became the Liverpool under 21 team and competes in the Professional Development League 1 which is also known by its sponsorship name of Barclays under 21 Premier League. The team generally consists of Under-21 players at the club <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>times</b> senior players also play for the reserves when they are recuperating from injury.

25|$|The Ms. M.383, titled Fior di Battaglia, {{is in the}} {{holdings}} of the Morgan Library & Museum in New York City, NY. Novati {{described it as a}} small, thin, vellum folio, pen and ink with gold highlights, and illustrations of sword and lance combat on foot and horseback. Unlike the other surviving manuscripts, the swords and other weapons were enameled in silver, though it has since tarnished to a glossy black. This is the briefest copy of Fiore's work currently known, with only 19 folios; it has a prologue in Italian and four illustrated figures per page in the main body. The figures are accompanied by text that is often identical to that of the Ms. Ludwig XV 13 (excepting differences in spelling), <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>times</b> includes additional explanation. The Ms. M.383 is almost certainly longer when it was first written; its text makes reference to sections on poleaxe, dagger, and grappling which are not present in the book's current state. It also refers to a certain play of the sword in one hand which is likewise missing from that section. This manuscript is typically referred to as the 'Pierpont Morgan version' or simply the 'Morgan'.|$|E
