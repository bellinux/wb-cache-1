50|$|Pneumatic and servo-electric {{machines}} are typically used in lower tonnage applications. Hydraulic brakes produce accurate high quality products, are reliable, use little energy and are safer because, unlike flywheel-driven presses, {{the motion of}} the ram can be easily stopped at any time in response to a safety device, e.g. a light curtain or other presence sensing device. Recent improvements are mainly in the control and a device called a backgauge. A <b>back</b> <b>gauge</b> is a device {{that can be used to}} accurately position a piece of metal so that the brake puts the bend in the correct place. Furthermore, the <b>back</b> <b>gauge</b> can be programmed to move between bends to repeatedly make complex parts. Early brakes relied on the tooling to determine the bend angle of the bend. The animation to the right shows the operation of the <b>back</b> <b>gauge,</b> setting the distance from the edge of the material or previous bend to the center of the die.|$|E
50|$|Guide, <b>back</b> <b>gauge,</b> or finger stop - These {{parts are}} all {{used to make}} sure that the {{material}} being worked on always goes in the same position, within the die, as the last one.|$|E
50|$|Press brakes {{often include}} {{multi-axis}} computer-controlled <b>back</b> <b>gauges.</b> Optical sensors allow operators {{to make adjustments}} during the bending process. These sensors send real-time data about the bending angle in the bend cycle to machine controls that adjust process parameters.|$|R
5000|$|On January 12, 1927, the Toronto Transportation Commission started {{operating}} the T&YRR lines under contract. Shortly after, the TTC converted the Mimico line from standard <b>gauge</b> <b>back</b> to Toronto <b>gauge.</b>|$|R

5000|$|A brake can be {{described}} by basic parameters, such as the force or tonnage and the working length. [...] Additional parameters include the stroke length, {{the distance between the}} frame uprights or side housings, distance to the <b>back</b> <b>gauge,</b> and work height. The upper beam usually operates at a speed ranging from 1 to 15 mm/s.|$|E
50|$|The press {{usually has}} {{some sort of}} <b>back</b> <b>gauge</b> to {{position}} depth of the bend along the workpiece. The backgauge can be computer controlled to allow the operator to make a series of bends in a component to {{a high degree of}} accuracy. Simple machines control only the backstop, more advanced machines control the position and angle of the stop, its height and the position of the two reference pegs used to locate the material. The machine can also record the exact position and pressure required for each bending operation to allow the operator to achieve a perfect 90 degree bend across a variety of operations on the part.|$|E
40|$|Meso-scale {{simulations}} of a compaction wave in a granular bed of HMX have been performed. The grains are fully resolved {{in order that}} the change in porosity across the wave front {{is determined by the}} elastic-plastic response of the grains rather than an empirical law for the porosity as a function of pressure. Numerical wave profiles of the pressure and velocity are compared with data from a gas gun experiment. The experiment used an initial porosity of 36 %, and the wave had a pressure comparable to the yield strength of the grains. The profiles are measured at the front and back of the granular bed. The transit time for the wave to travel between the gauges together with the Hugoniot jump conditions determines the porosity behind the wave front. In the simulations the porosity is determined by the yield strength and stress concentrations at the contact between grains. The value of the yield strength needed to match the experiment is discussed. Analysis of the impedance match of the wave at the <b>back</b> <b>gauge</b> indicates that the compaction wave triggers a small amount of burn, less than 1 % mass fraction, on the micro-second time scale of the experiment...|$|E

50|$|The Mimico {{radial line}} used Toronto gauge until 1922 when the Hydro-Electric Railways {{converted}} {{the line to}} standard gauge. When the TTC took over the line in 1927, it converted the line <b>back</b> to Toronto <b>gauge.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 2005 Luntz {{conducted}} {{a focus group}} broadcast on the Conservative leadership race on the BBC current affairs show Newsnight. The focus group's overwhelmingly positive reaction to David Cameron was {{seen by many as}} crucial in making him the favorite in a crowded field. Cameron was the eventual victor. In March 2007, Newsnight invited him <b>back</b> to <b>gauge</b> comparative opinions on Cameron, Gordon Brown and Sir Menzies Campbell in the city of Birmingham.|$|R
50|$|The two VAC {{sleeping}} {{cars were}} withdrawn from standard gauge service and converted <b>back</b> to broad <b>gauge</b> at Newport Workshops, and the sitting compartments were replaced with full Twinette compartments.

50|$|In 1923, the Toronto Transportation Commission {{took over}} the line from Keele Street to Runnymede Road, and later to the Lambton Loop, {{converting}} the line <b>back</b> to Toronto <b>gauge</b> in 1924. The line was closed on 17 August 1928 being replaced by bus service.|$|R
50|$|Ten {{locomotives}} {{were built}} in 1876 with broad gauge wheels outside the standard double frames. Five more broad gauge locomotives {{were built in}} 1878, while from 1884 another 35 were converted from standard gauge to broad.

50|$|The Haldibari-New Jalpaiguri {{line has}} gone through two {{successive}} gauge changes. As most other railway tracks in the area were metre gauge, the line was converted from broad gauge to metre gauge in 1949.

50|$|A {{large number}} of {{different}} gauges of strings can be used. Strings reside {{on top of the}} zero fret regardless of thickness, and have the same distance travel down to the first fret. If you have cut the grooves into the nut for thick strings, {{it may be necessary to}} change the nut out completely in order to go <b>back</b> to lighter <b>gauge</b> strings. On zero fret, this isn't needed.|$|R
50|$|In 1962, 35CE was {{converted}} to standard gauge and recoded to 1VHE (No.1, Victorian, Guard's Van, E type respectively), {{and it was}} used as a spare van for standard gauge services until 1969 when it {{was converted}} <b>back</b> to broad <b>gauge.</b> At this time it regained its original identity of 35CE.

5000|$|Power {{or working}} stroke: The {{pressure}} of the combustion gases pushes the piston downward, generating more work than it required to compress the charge. Complementary to the compression stroke, the combustion gases expand {{and as a result}} their temperature, pressure and density decreases. When the piston is near to BDC the exhaust valve opens. The combustion gases expand irreversibly due to the leftover pressure—in excess of <b>back</b> pressure, the <b>gauge</b> pressure on the exhaust port—; this is called the blowdown.|$|R

50|$|After the Second World War, {{the railway}} tracks were briefly {{converted}} to Russian broad gauge in July 1945. The Soviet dictator, Stalin {{took part in}} the Potsdam Conference and insisted on a trip without changing trains. The line was converted <b>back</b> to standard <b>gauge</b> in September of the same year. Since the line was the most important link to the USSR, neither long-distance track was dismantled for war reparations (unlike on other lines), but instead both of S-Bahn tracks were dismantled. The suburban tracks were re-laid up to 1947 so that S-Bahn trains could run to Karlshorst again.|$|R
