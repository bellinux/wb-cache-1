5000|$|Transceiver nodes can be {{connected}} to cable segments with N connectors, or via a vampire tap, which allows new nodes to be added while existing connections are live. A vampire tap clamps onto the cable, a hole is drilled through the outer shielding, and a spike is forced to pierce and contact the inner conductor while other spikes bite into the outer <b>braided</b> <b>shield.</b> Care is required to keep the outer shield from touching the spike; installation kits include a [...] "coring tool" [...] to drill through the outer layers and a [...] "braid pick" [...] to clear stray pieces of the outer shield.|$|E

The coupling is represented by voltage and current sources and is implemented using the Transmission Line Matrix (TLM) Method. Frequency domain analysis for both shield and inner conductor excitations is presented and compared against an existing, lossless, SPICE model...|$|E

5000|$|Despite being shielded, {{interference}} {{can occur}} on coaxial cable lines. Susceptibility to interference has little relationship to broad cable type designations (e.g. RG-59, RG-6) but is {{strongly related to}} the composition and configuration of the cable's shielding. For cable television, with frequencies extending well into the UHF range, a foil shield is normally provided, and will provide total coverage as well as high effectiveness against high-frequency interference. Foil shielding is ordinarily accompanied by a tinned copper or aluminum <b>braid</b> <b>shield,</b> with anywhere from 60 to 95% coverage. The braid is important to shield effectiveness because (1) it {{is more effective than}} foil at preventing low-frequency interference, (2) it provides higher conductivity to ground than foil, and (3) it makes attaching a connector easier and more reliable. [...] "Quad-shield" [...] cable, using two low-coverage aluminum <b>braid</b> <b>shields</b> and two layers of foil, is often used in situations involving troublesome interference, but is less effective than a single layer of foil and single high-coverage copper <b>braid</b> <b>shield</b> such as is found on broadcast-quality precision video cable.|$|R
25|$|Individual {{and overall}} shield (F/FTP, S/FTP, and SF/FTP): Individual {{shielding}} using foil between the twisted pair sets, and also an outer foil and/or <b>braided</b> <b>shielding.</b> Common names: fully shielded twisted pair, screened foiled twisted pair, shielded foiled twisted pair, screened shielded twisted pair, shielded screened twisted pair. This type of shielding helps prevent EMI from entering or exiting the cable and also protects neighboring pairs from crosstalk.|$|R
40|$|The {{phenomenon}} of crosstalk between parallel <b>braided</b> <b>shield</b> coaxial cables is examined. Two specific configurations are treated in detail: (1) two infinite length cables and (2) two finite length cables with their shields terminated in perfectly conducting shorting planes. Crosstalk is calculated {{using a new}} integral equation formulation. A comparison is made between the existing transmission line model, traditionally used for analyzing such coupling, and this new approach. Measurements of far-end and near-end crosstalk were made and the correlation of this data with these two theories is discussed. It was found that, at frequencies such that the cable separation is an appreciable portion of a wavelength, the integral equation approach is much more accurate at predicting the crosstalk than transmission line theory. ...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{measurement and}} simulation technique of cable impedance parameters in 600 V system. Coaxial and twinaxial cables {{are the two}} types of cables analyzed. The cables are modelled in finite element method (FEM) software using the concept of transverse electric magnetic (TEM) waves. The impedance parameters are measured in a laboratory with a vector network analyzer (VNA) using short circuit and open circuit method. A comparison and analysis of results is made between the simulation and laboratory measurements. The effect on the impedance parameters due to a solid or <b>braided</b> <b>shield</b> in a cable are discussed. Also, a study is conducted to understand the behaviour of cable impedance for placements and at different heights from chassis/copper frame. Different types of shield groundings are adopted in the measurement setup to understand its main purpose. Furthermore, measurements on the cables of a hybrid bus are also performed and compared with the simulation and laboratory measurement results...|$|E
40|$|The {{transfer}} impedance Z/sub t/ of a cable is often {{assumed to be}} a characteristic of the shield only. We investigate the limits of this assumption by calculations and measurements. The first test cable was formed by a solid copper tube (ldquoshieldrdquo) and a wire inside; several positions, also non-central, were chosen for the wire. The common mode current (between 10 Hz and 100 kHz) through the tube had as return path a single wire, which was placed at several positions, near and at some distance from the shield. A second cable with a <b>braided</b> <b>shield</b> was tested as well. The results show that both the differential mode and the common mode circuit have to be carefully defined for a particular Z/sub t/. Varying either circuit may alter Z/sub t/ drastically. Consequently, the Z/sub t/ of a particular cable measured in a triaxial setup, is a characteristic of that setup and cannot always be used in another setup as in for instance cable bundle...|$|E
25|$|ISO/IEC 11801:2002 (Annex E) {{attempts}} to internationally standardize the various designations for shielded cables by using combinations of three letters - U for unshielded, S for <b>braided</b> <b>shielding</b> (in outer layer only), and F for foil shielding - to explicitly indicate {{the type of}} screen for overall cable protection and for protecting individual pairs or quads, using a two-part abbreviation {{in the form of}} x/xTP.|$|R
5000|$|Individual {{and overall}} shield (F/FTP, S/FTP, and SF/FTP): Individual {{shielding}} using foil between the twisted pair sets, and also an outer foil and/or <b>braided</b> <b>shielding.</b> Common names: fully shielded twisted pair, screened foiled twisted pair, shielded foiled twisted pair, screened shielded twisted pair, shielded screened twisted pair.

5000|$|For its {{physical}} layer 10BASE5 uses cable similar to RG-8/U coaxial cable but with extra <b>braided</b> <b>shielding.</b> This is a stiff, 0.375 in diameter cable with an impedance of 50 ohms, a solid center conductor, a foam insulating filler, a <b>shielding</b> <b>braid,</b> and an outer jacket. The outer jacket is often yellow-to-orange {{fluorinated ethylene propylene}} (for fire resistance) so it often is called [...] "yellow cable", [...] "orange hose", or sometimes humorously [...] "frozen yellow garden hose". 10BASE5 coaxial cables had a maximum length of 500 m. Up to 100 nodes could be connected to a 10BASE5 segment.|$|R
50|$|Annex E, Acronyms for {{balanced}} cables, {{provides a}} system to specify the exact construction for both unshielded and shielded balanced twisted pair cables. It uses three letters - U for unshielded, S for <b>braided</b> <b>shielding,</b> and F for foil shielding - to form a two-part abbreviation {{in the form of}} xx/xTP, where the first part specifies the type of overall cable shielding, and the second part specifies shielding for individual cable elements.|$|R
50|$|The gaps or holes, {{allow some}} of the {{electromagnetic}} field to penetrate to the other side. For example, <b>braided</b> <b>shields</b> have many small gaps. The gaps are smaller when using a foil (solid metal) shield, {{but there is still}} a seam running the length of the cable. Foil becomes increasingly rigid with increasing thickness, so a thin foil layer is often surrounded by a layer of braided metal, which offers greater flexibility for a given cross-section.|$|R
50|$|The most {{commonly}} recognized variety of RG-6 is cable television (CATV) distribution coax, used to route cable television signals to and within homes, and RG-6 type cables {{have become the}} standard for CATV, mostly replacing the smaller RG-59, in recent years. CATV distribution coax typically has a copper-clad steel (CCS) center conductor and a combination aluminum foil/aluminum <b>braid</b> <b>shield,</b> typically with low coverage (about 60%). RG-6 type cables are also used in professional video applications, carrying either base band analog video signals or serial digital interface (SDI) signals; in these applications, the center conductor is ordinarily solid copper, the shielding is much heavier (typically aluminum foil/95% copper braid), and tolerances are more tightly controlled, to improve impedance stability.|$|R
50|$|Some {{balanced}} lines {{also have}} electrostatic shielding {{to reduce the}} amount of noise introduced. The cable is often wrapped in foil, copper wire, or a copper <b>braid.</b> This <b>shield</b> provides immunity to RF interference but does not provide immunity to magnetic fields.|$|R

40|$|Abstract— A SPICE {{model is}} {{proposed}} to simulate a typical boxto-box structure when the interconnect is a two-wire shielded cable. The {{goal is to}} carry out a very simple circuit that can be easily implemented by any user interested in investigating conducted transient immunity of a parallel-pair (twinax) or twisted-pair shielded cable. The model is based on the classic cable representation as a cascade of lumped element circuit cells obtained considering the cable as a three-conductor transmission line (TL) above a reference plane. Particular attention is here addressed to properly define the mutual inductive coupling between the wires and the shield in order {{to take into account the}} penetration through apertures proper of real <b>braided</b> <b>shields.</b> The model is suitable for direct transient analysis and allows modeling any kind of cable terminations...|$|R
40|$|A {{statistical}} {{evaluation of a}} measurement system {{that is used to}} determine the screening attenuation performance of coaxial cable is presented. The measurement system, which is in accordance with IEC 61196 [1] guidelines, is defined to consist of the test equipment, appropriate personnel to operate the equipment, and samples of coaxial cable that are to be tested. The system measurement error is shown to depend primarily on the test fixture length, the frequency span of the test, and the design of the shield structure under test. The contributions of these components to the measurement error are identified through a series of five measurement system evaluations (MSE’s). The MSE’s were conducted with two shield designs used on standard 75 -ohm coaxial cable. The first is a foil/braid shield design. The second is a single <b>braid</b> <b>shield...</b>|$|R

40|$|A simple {{theory is}} {{presented}} of how lightning induced Waveform 5 currents appears on cables in composite airframes {{and why it}} does not rise {{as fast as the}} lightning pulse or as slow as the RL time constant of the cable. Why normal copper <b>braid</b> <b>shields</b> do not work against it is explained using Schelkunoff’s theory of coaxial cable shields. A new cable shield design using layers of copper and high-mu foil is developed that will protect against Waveform 5 currents and not saturate. The effects of the new cable shield on signals passing through it are discussed. Finally, a lab test is designed for verifying the models. 2 INTRODUCTION This paper is possibly the first open publication of (1) a simple theory of how the low frequency Waveform 5 induced lightning current (44 - 50 s rise time and 100 - 500 s decay time) 4 develops on cables in composite airframes, (2) why normal copper <b>braid</b> cable <b>shields</b> do not attenuate the low frequencies, and (3) a new cable shield design 21 for protecting electrical and electronic systems from this little understood phenomenon. More rigorous theoretical work is needed. Composite airframes exposed to direct strike lightning with as much as 200 kA current will have over ten thousand volts built up along the airframe. A notional picture of a composite cylindrical airframe with a shielded wire is shown in Figure 1. source impedance would be acceptable to the phenomenologists but it is unnecessary for this modeling because it is much larger than the loads...|$|R
5000|$|The MIDI {{specification}} {{provides for}} a ground [...] "wire" [...] and a <b>braid</b> or foil <b>shield,</b> connected on pin 2, protecting the two signal-carrying conductors on pins 4 and 5. Although the MIDI cable is supposed to connect pin 2 and the <b>braid</b> or foil <b>shield</b> to chassis ground, it should do so only at the MIDI out port; the MIDI in port should leave pin 2 unconnected and isolated. Some large manufacturers of MIDI devices use modified MIDI in-only DIN 5-pin sockets with the metallic conductors intentionally omitted at pin positions 1, 2, and 3 so that the maximum voltage isolation is obtained.|$|R
50|$|Typically {{the male}} {{connector}} is fitted to a cable, {{and the female}} to a panel on equipment. Cable connectors are often designed to be fitted by crimping using a special power or manual tool. Wire strippers which strip outer jacket, <b>shield</b> <b>braid,</b> and inner dielectric to the correct lengths in one operation are used.|$|R
5000|$|RG-58/U {{is a type}} of {{coaxial cable}} often used for {{low-power}} signal and RF connections. The cable has a characteristic impedance of either 50 or 52 Ω. [...] "RG" [...] was originally a unit indicator for bulk RF cable in the U.S. military's Joint Electronics Type Designation System. There are several versions covering the differences in core material (solid or <b>braided</b> wire) and <b>shield</b> (70% to 95% coverage).|$|R
5000|$|Professional audio {{equipment}} {{intended for use}} with balanced lines may have a ground lift switch for the cable shield. The ground lift switch eliminates unwanted hum and buzz by interrupting the ground loops between equipment, preventing current flow along the cable shield between two devices. The switch disconnects pin 1 on the XLR jack, which {{is connected to the}} <b>braid</b> or foil <b>shield</b> in the cable and acts as the ground point of the circuit.|$|R
50|$|Crimp {{connections}} are used typically to fix connectors, such as BNC connectors, to coaxial cables quickly, {{as an alternative}} to soldered connections. Typically the male connector is crimp-fitted to a cable, and the female attached, often using soldered connections, to a panel on equipment. A special power or manual tool is used to fit the connector. Wire strippers which strip outer jacket, <b>shield</b> <b>braid,</b> and inner insulation to the correct lengths in one operation are used to prepare the cable for crimping.|$|R
50|$|An ideal shield {{would be}} a perfect {{conductor}} with no holes, gaps, or bumps connected to a perfect ground. However, a smooth solid highly conductive shield would be heavy, inflexible, and expensive. Such coax is used for straight line feeds to commercial radio broadcast towers. More economical cables must make compromises between shield efficacy, flexibility, and cost, such as the corrugated surface of flexible hardline, flexible <b>braid,</b> or foil <b>shields.</b> Since shields cannot be perfect conductors, current flowing {{on the inside of}} the shield produces an electromagnetic field on the outer surface of the shield.|$|R
5000|$|Many {{conventional}} coaxial cables use braided {{copper wire}} forming the shield. This allows the cable to be flexible, {{but it also means}} there are gaps in the shield layer, and the inner dimension of the shield varies slightly because the braid cannot be flat. Sometimes the braid is silver-plated. For better shield performance, some cables have a double-layer shield. The shield might be just two braids, but it is more common now to have a thin foil shield covered by a wire braid. Some cables may invest in more than two shield layers, such as [...] "quad-shield", which uses four alternating layers of foil and <b>braid.</b> Other <b>shield</b> designs sacrifice flexibility for better performance; some shields are a solid metal tube. Those cables cannot be bent sharply, as the shield will kink, causing losses in the cable. When a foil shield is used a small wire conductor incorporated into the foil makes soldering the shield termination easier.|$|R
50|$|The cable used {{to connect}} the MIL-STD-1553 bus and stub devices has a {{characteristic}} impedance of 78 ohms at 1 MHz. A 2-conductor twisted-pair cable known as Twinax is used {{to connect the}} bus and stub devices. The insulated pairs are balanced and have an overall <b>shielding</b> <b>braid</b> around the pairs. The twisting of the signal-carrying pairs theoretically cancels any random induced noise caused by the pair. The two internal dielectric fillers separate the braid from the pairs to minimize the leakage capacitance to ground. The fillers also assist in uniform twisting of the pairs. The 90% braid coverage protects the pair from external noise. PVC outer jacket cable is suitable for lab use while high-temperature rated outer jacket cable is applicable for vehicle use.|$|R
40|$|The {{characteristics}} of a triaxial test fixture, which has been developed for screening attenuation measurements on long shielded cables, are described. Screening attenuation performance of a selection of coaxial CATV cable <b>braid</b> and multi-foil/braid <b>shield</b> designs are presented. Measured screening attenuation results for 30 meter long cables covering the frequency range 1 - 100 MHz are compared with results from measurements on 1. 5 meter long cables that were measured over the frequency range of 1 - 1000 MHz. The comparison shows that the estimation or deduction of long length, low frequency performance from high frequency performance can have significant error. The paper concludes that worse case or minimum screening attenuation performance should be assessed for cable lengths and frequencies that are pertinent to usage of the cable...|$|R
40|$|Simulated {{lightning}} strike testing of instrumentation cabling on the redesigned solid rocket motor was performed. Testing consisted of subjecting the lightning evaluation test article to simulated {{lightning strike}}s and evaluating {{the effects of}} instrumentation cable transients on cables within the system tunnel. The maximum short-circuit current induced onto a United Space Boosters, Inc., operational flight cable within the systems tunnel was 92 A, and the maximum induced open-circuit voltage was 316 V. These levels were extrapolated to the worst-case (200 kA) condition of NASA specification NSTS 07636 and were also scaled to full-scale redesigned solid rocket motor dimensions. Testing showed that voltage coupling to cables within the systems tunnel can be reduced 40 to 90 dB and that current coupling to cables within the systems tunnel can be reduced 30 to 70 dB {{with the use of}} <b>braided</b> metallic sock <b>shields</b> around cables that are external to the systems tunnel. Testing also showed that current and voltage levels induced onto cables within the systems tunnel are partially dependant on the cables' relative locations within the systems tunnel. Results of current injections to the systems tunnel indicate that the dominant coupling mode on cables within the systems tunnel is not from instrumentation cables but from coupling through the systems tunnel cover seam apertures. It is recommended that methods of improving the electrical bonding between individual sections of the systems tunnel covers be evaluated. Further testing to better characterize redesigned solid rocket motor cable coupling effects as an aid in developing methods to reduce coupling levels, particularly with respect to cable placement within the systems tunnel, is also recommended...|$|R
