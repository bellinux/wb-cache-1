5|$|In 1975, Richard Bulliet of Columbia University {{wrote that}} the {{dromedary}} exists in large numbers in areas from which the <b>Bactrian</b> <b>camel</b> has disappeared; the converse is also true to a great extent. He said this substitution could have taken place because of the heavy dependence on the milk, meat and wool of the dromedary by Syrian and Arabian nomads, while the Asiatic people domesticated the <b>Bactrian</b> <b>camel</b> but {{did not have to}} depend upon its products.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, Peng Cui of the Chinese Academy of Sciences {{and colleagues}} {{carried out a}} phylogenetic study of the {{evolutionary}} relationships between the two tribes of Camelidae; Camelini – consisting of the three Camelus species (the study considered the wild <b>Bactrian</b> <b>camel</b> as a subspecies of the <b>Bactrian</b> <b>camel)</b> – and Lamini, which consists of the alpaca (Vicugna pacos), the guanaco (Lama guanicoe), the llama (L. glama) and the vicuña (V. vicugna). The study showed the two tribes had diverged 25 million years ago (early Miocene), earlier than previously estimated from North American fossils.|$|E
5|$|The {{dromedary}} and the <b>Bactrian</b> <b>camel</b> often interbreed {{to produce}} fertile offspring. Where the ranges {{of the species}} overlap, such as in northern Punjab, Persia and Afghanistan, the phenotypic differences between them tend to decrease {{as a result of}} extensive crossbreeding. The fertility of their hybrid has given rise to speculation that the dromedary and the <b>Bactrian</b> <b>camel</b> should be merged into a single species with two varieties. However, a 1994 analysis of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene showed the species display 10.3% divergence in their sequences.|$|E
50|$|Camelids {{are members}} of the {{biological}} family Camelidae, the only currently living family in the suborder Tylopoda. The extant members of this group are: dromedary <b>camels,</b> <b>Bactrian</b> <b>camels,</b> wild <b>Bactrian</b> <b>camels,</b> llamas, alpacas, vicuñas, and guanacos.|$|R

5|$|The {{dromedary}} {{shares the}} genus Camelus with the <b>Bactrian</b> <b>camel</b> (C. bactrianus) {{and the wild}} <b>Bactrian</b> <b>camel</b> (C. ferus). The dromedary belongs to the family Camelidae. The ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle (4th century BC) {{was the first to}} describe the species of Camelus. He named two species in his History of Animals; the one-humped Arabian camel and the two-humped <b>Bactrian</b> <b>camel.</b> The dromedary was given its current binomial name Camelus dromedarius by Swedish zoologist Carl Linnaeus in his 1758 publication Systema Naturae. In 1927, British veterinarian Arnold Leese classified dromedaries by their basic habitats; the hill camels are small, muscular animals and efficient beasts of burden; the larger plains camels could be further divided into the desert type that can bear light burdens and are apt for riding, and the riverine type slow animals that can bear heavy burdens; and those intermediate between these two types.|$|E
5|$|Among {{many other}} mammal crosses are hybrid camels, crosses between a <b>bactrian</b> <b>camel</b> and a dromedary. The first known {{instance}} of hybrid speciation in marine mammals {{was discovered in}} 2014. The clymene dolphin (Stenella clymene) is a hybrid of two Atlantic species, the spinner and striped dolphins.|$|E
5|$|In Asia, nearly 70% of the {{population}} occurs in India and Pakistan. The combined population of the dromedary and the <b>Bactrian</b> <b>camel</b> decreased by around 21% between 1994 and 2004. The dromedary is sympatric with the <b>Bactrian</b> <b>camel</b> in Afghanistan, Pakistan, and central and southwestern Asia. India has a dromedary population of less than one million, with most (0.67 million) {{in the state of}} Rajasthan. Populations in Pakistan decreased from 1.1 million in 1994 to 0.8 million in 2005 – a 29% decline. According to the FAO, the dromedary population in six countries of the Persian Gulf was nearly 0.67 million in 2003. In the Persian Gulf region the dromedary is locally classified into breeds including Al-Majahem, Al-Hamrah, Al-Safrah, Al-Zarkah and Al-Shakha, based on coat colour. The UAE has three prominent breeds; Racing camel, Al-Arabiat and Al-Kazmiat.|$|E

5|$|The {{dromedary}} has 74 diploid chromosomes, {{the same}} as other camelids. The autosomes consist of five pairs of small to medium-sized metacentrics and submetacentrics. The X chromosome is {{the largest in the}} metacentric and submetacentric group. There are 31 pairs of acrocentrics. The dromedary's karyotype {{is similar to that of}} the <b>Bactrian</b> <b>camel.</b>|$|E
5|$|Compared {{with the}} <b>Bactrian</b> <b>camel,</b> the {{dromedary}} has a lighter build, longer limbs, shorter hairs, a harder palate and an insignificant or absent ethmoidal fissure. Unlike the camelids {{of the genus}} Lama, the dromedary has a hump, and in comparison has a longer tail, smaller ears, squarer feet and a greater height at the shoulder. The dromedary has four teats instead of the two in the Lama species.|$|E
5|$|Horses occur {{naturally}} on the steppes of Central Asia, {{and their}} domestication, around 3,000 BC in the Black Sea and Caspian Sea region, was originally {{as a source}} of meat; use as pack animals and for riding followed. Around the same time, the wild ass was being tamed in Egypt. Camels were domesticated soon after this, with the <b>Bactrian</b> <b>camel</b> in Mongolia and the Arabian camel becoming beasts of burden. By 1000 BC, caravans of Arabian camels were linking India with Mesopotamia and the Mediterranean.|$|E

5|$|The modern {{dromedary}} probably {{evolved in}} the hotter, arid regions of western Asia from the <b>Bactrian</b> <b>camel,</b> which in turn was {{closely related to the}} earliest Old World camels. This hypothesis is supported {{by the fact that the}} dromedary foetus has two humps, while in the adult male an anterior vestigial hump is present. A jawbone of a dromedary that dated from 8,200 BC was found in Saudi Arabia on the southern coast of the Red Sea.|$|E
5|$|Camel {{hybridisation}} {{began in}} the first millennium BC. For about a thousand years, Bactrian camels and dromedaries have been successfully bred in regions where they are sympatric to form hybrids with either a long, slightly lopsided hump or two humps – one small and one large. These hybrids are larger and stronger than their parents – they can bear greater loads. A cross between a first generation female hybrid and a male <b>Bactrian</b> <b>camel</b> can also produce a hybrid. Hybrids from other combinations tend to be bad-tempered or runts.|$|E

25|$|By {{at least}} 1200 BC, the first camel saddles had appeared, and Bactrian camels could be ridden. The first saddle was {{positioned}} {{to the back}} of the camel, and control of the <b>Bactrian</b> <b>camel</b> was exercised by means of a stick. However, between 500–100 BC, Bactrian camels attained military use. New saddles, which were inflexible and bent, were put over the humps and divided the rider's weight over the animal. In the seventh century BC, the military Arabian saddle appeared, which again improved the saddle design slightly.|$|E

25|$|Sherratt {{argued that}} this phase in {{agricultural}} development enabled humans {{to make use of}} the energy possibilities of their animals in new ways, and permitted permanent intensive subsistence farming and crop production, and the opening up of heavier soils for farming. It also made possible nomadic pastoralism in semi arid areas, along the margins of deserts, and eventually led to the domestication of both the dromedary and <b>Bactrian</b> <b>camel.</b> Overgrazing of these areas, particularly by herds of goats, greatly extended the areal extent of deserts.|$|E
25|$|The {{campaign}} {{focused on}} the threat of desertification from the intensive farming practised in the area, which Goldsmith emphasised {{with the help of}} a <b>Bactrian</b> <b>camel</b> supplied by Aspinall. Goldsmith was in turn accompanied by bearded supporters dressed in the garb of Arab sheiks, the implication being that if modern oil-intensive farming practises were allowed to continue, the camel would be the only viable means of transport left in Suffolk. Goldsmith lost his deposit, but his unorthodox campaign succeeded in attracting the media's attention and highlighted the issues. He again stood for the now-renamed Ecology Party at the European elections in 1979, now winning a more respectable portion of the vote.|$|E
25|$|Toward {{the end of}} the Wild Goat style, {{northern}} Ionian artists imitated—rather poorly—Corinthian models. But {{already in}} the 7th century high quality vases were being produced in Ionia. Since approximately 600 BC the black-figure style was used either entirely or in part to decorate vases. In addition to regional styles which developed in Klazomenai, Ephesus, Milet, Chios and Samos there were especially in northern Ionia styles which cannot be precisely localized. Oil flasks which adhered to the Lydian model (lydions) were common, but most of them were decorated only with stripes. There are also original scenes, for example a Scythian with a <b>Bactrian</b> <b>camel,</b> or a satyr and a ram. For some styles attribution is controversial. Thus the Northampton Group shows strong Ionian influence but production was probably in Italy, perhaps by immigrants from Ionia.|$|E
