A lightning strike can attack its victims in one of three ways: direct hit, splash or ground strike. The cardiovascular system can be affected directly by mechanical or electrical trauma during a direct hit or can be indirectly affected through effects on the total body with extensive catecholamine release or autonomic stimulation. Reported effects include hypertension, tachycardia, nonspecific etectrocardiographic (ECG) changes including prolongation of the corrected QT (QTc) interval, transient T wave inversion and myocardial necrosis with creatine kinase-MB (CKMB) fraction release. Methods. Nineteen victims from five separate lightning strikes were studied over a 2 -month period. Each patient was evaluated by serial ECG, CK-MB determinations and echocardiography. Results. The early (0 to 72 h) effects of lightning were demonstrated on the ECG by ST segment elevation consistent with acute current of injury, prolonged QTc interval with direct hits and nonspecific ST and T wave changes. On echocardiography, segmental or global ventricular dysfunction was seen, and pericardial effusion was also detected. During the intermediate (3 - to 14 -day) period, new and ofter marked ECG changes consistent with pericarditis or ischemia were seen. No new echocardiographic changes were detected, however, and the early abnormalities including severe left ventricular dysfunction with cardiogenic shock have reversed. The late (1 to 12 months) period revealed only one patient with long-term sequelae (recurrent pericarditis that persisted for 5 months). Conclusions. Unless both entrance and exit sites are limited to the lower limbs, direct and splash lightning strikes cause myocardial damage as assessed <b>by</b> abnormal <b>sernam</b> enzyme determinetions or abnormal echocardiographic findings. Only direct hits resulted in echocardiographic abnormalities or a prolonged QTc interval. The degree of myocardial injury can be severe with left and right ventricular ejection fraction < 15 % and can be reversible...|$|R

5000|$|Michelle Bachelet was {{the first}} female {{president}} of Chile, leading the country between 2006 and 2010. During her presidency, Bachelet increased {{the budget of the}} National Women's Service (SERNAM) and helped the institution gain funding from the United Nations Development Fund for Women. At the end of 2006, there were 29 government and private centers to attend to victims of intrafamily violence. During 2006, the SERNAM partnered with NGOs to conduct courses on the legal, medical, and psychological aspects of domestic violence for police officers and judicial and municipal authorities. [...] This intensive training program <b>by</b> <b>SERNAM</b> has increasingly allowed many Chilean police to provide effective assistance in domestic violence cases. SERNAM has been active in advancing the domestic violence legislation (see below).|$|E
