5|$|Washington {{became an}} {{international}} icon for liberation and nationalism, {{as the leader}} of the first successful revolution against a colonial empire. The Federalists made him the symbol of their party <b>but,</b> <b>for</b> <b>many</b> years, the Jeffersonians continued to distrust his influence and delayed building the Washington Monument. On January 31, 1781, he was elected a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.|$|E
5|$|Many {{eukaryotic}} non-coding RNAs {{are always}} polyadenylated {{at the end}} of transcription. There are small RNAs where the poly(A) tail is seen only in intermediary forms and not in the mature RNA as the ends are removed during processing, the notable ones being microRNAs. <b>But,</b> <b>for</b> <b>many</b> long noncoding RNAs– a seemingly large group of regulatory RNAs that, for example, includes the RNA Xist, which mediates X chromosome inactivation– a poly(A) tail is part of the mature RNA.|$|E
5|$|The Museum House is cast in Classical Revival {{style and}} was the last {{outbuilding}} constructed for Isaac Ellwood on the property. Today the Museum House's exterior appears {{much the same as}} it did when it was newly constructed <b>but</b> <b>for</b> <b>many</b> years the structure was badly deteriorated. After Harriet Ellwood died in 1910 the objects remained inside the building while it began to decline. By 1934 the building was in serious need of repair and by the 1970s both porches were gone and the only way into the building was through the north door. The museum house restoration was undertaken more than ten years later. Prior to the addition of the Visitors Center to the Carriage House, the Museum House served as the visitors center and housed staff offices.|$|E

5|$|Real estate {{companies}} {{continued to}} advertise and sell land along newly dug canals. In April 1912—the {{end of the}} dry season—reporters {{from all over the}} U.S. were given a tour of what had recently been drained, and they returned to their papers and raved about the progress. Land developers sold 20,000lots in a few months. But as news about the Wright report continued to be negative, land values plummeted, and sales decreased. Developers were sued and arrested for mail fraud when people who had spent their life savings to buy land arrived in south Florida expecting to find a dry parcel of land to build upon and instead found it completely underwater. Advertisements promised land that would yield crops in eight weeks, <b>but</b> <b>for</b> <b>many</b> it took at least as long just to clear. Some burned off the sawgrass or other vegetation only to discover that the underlying peat continued to burn. Animals and tractors used for plowing got mired in the muck and were useless. When the muck dried, it turned to a fine black powder and created dust storms. Settlers encountered rodents, skinks, and biting insects, and faced dangers from mosquitoes, poisonous snakes and alligators. Though at first crops sprouted quickly and lushly, they just as quickly wilted and died, seemingly without reason. It was discovered later that the peat and muck lacked copper and other trace elements. The USDA released a pamphlet in 1915 that declared land along the New River Canal would be too costly to keep drained and fertilized; people in Ft.Lauderdale responded by collecting all of the pamphlets and burning them.|$|E
5|$|The {{episodes of}} Flywheel, Shyster, and Flywheel were recorded, <b>but</b> <b>for</b> <b>many</b> {{years it was}} thought the {{recordings}} had not been preserved. At {{the time of the}} broadcasts, pre-recorded shows were frowned upon by advertisers and audiences. However, in 1988, Michael Barson, who worked in the United States Copyright Office at the Library of Congress discovered that the scripts for twenty-five of the twenty-six episodes had been submitted to the Office, where they had been placed in storage. Nobody was aware that they still existed and their copyrights had not been renewed. This meant that Flywheel, Shyster, and Flywheel had fallen into the public domain. The scripts were published that same year by Pantheon in a book titled Flywheel, Shyster, and Flywheel: The Marx Brothers' Lost Radio Show, edited by Michael Barson and with an interview with Perrin. In October 1988, Flywheel, Shyster and Flywheel scenes were broadcast {{for the first time since}} the show went off the air in 1933 when National Public Radio, a non-profit media organization that provides content to public radio stations around the United States, aired an 18-minute recreation of Flywheel, Shyster and Flywheel in markets such as Chicago, Illinois, Dallas, Texas, and Los Angeles, California, using Washington, D.C.-based Arena Stage actors to perform the Chico and Groucho lead roles from the published scripts. Years later, three recordings of Flywheel, Shyster, and Flywheel were found, including a five-minute excerpt of Episode 24 and a fifteen-minute recording of Episode 25. A complete recording of Episode 26 exists and was broadcast on BBC Radio 4 in 2005.|$|E

25|$|The damped natural {{frequency}} {{is less than the}} undamped {{natural frequency}}, <b>but</b> <b>for</b> <b>many</b> practical cases the damping ratio is relatively small and hence the difference is negligible. Therefore, the damped and undamped description are often dropped when stating the natural frequency (e.g. with 0.1 damping ratio, the {{damped natural frequency}} is only 1% less than the undamped).|$|E
25|$|Charles Eliot was a fearless crusader {{not only}} for {{educational}} reform, <b>but</b> <b>for</b> <b>many</b> {{of the goals of}} the progressive movement—whose most prominent figurehead was Theodore Roosevelt (Class of 1880) and most eloquent spokesman was Herbert Croly (Class of 1889).

25|$|Some mystics {{are said}} {{to have been able to}} perform miracles. <b>But</b> <b>for</b> <b>many</b> mystics, the miracles {{occurred}} to them.

Catherine of Genoa was an example of someone who experienced this type of miracle.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{the formal}} disapproval of {{religious}} authority, gender segregation in Muslim societies {{and the strong}} emphasis on virility leads adolescents and unmarried young men to seek alternative sexual outlets to women, especially with males younger than themselves.

25|$|In 1746 the Scotch-Irish Presbyterians {{created the}} College of New Jersey, later renamed Princeton University. The mission was {{training}} New Light Presbyterian ministers. The college became educational {{as well as}} religious capital of Scotch-Irish America.

Meanwhile, Princeton Seminary, under the leadership of Charles Hodge, originated a conservative theology that in large part shaped Fundamentalist Protestantism in the 20th century.|$|E
25|$|The {{center of}} the Central region was Mexico City. The {{development}} of Mexico City itself is extremely important {{to the development of}} New Spain as a whole. It was the seat of the Viceroyalty of New Spain, the Archdiocese of the Catholic Church, the Holy Office of the Inquisition, the merchants' guild (consulado), and the most elite families in the Kingdom of New Spain. Mexico City was the single-most populous city, not just in New Spain, <b>but</b> <b>for</b> <b>many</b> years the entire Western Hemisphere, with a high concentration of mixed-race castas.

25|$|However, some Japanese fans {{of hip-hop}} find it {{embarrassing}} and ridiculous that these blackface fans {{do this because}} {{they feel like they}} shouldn't change their appearance to embrace the culture. In some instances it {{can be seen as a}} racist act, <b>but</b> <b>for</b> <b>many</b> of the young the Japanese fans it is a way of immersing in the hip hop culture the way they see fit. For example, the Japanese hip hop group Soul'd Out is extremely imitative of African American culture. Looking at Soul'd Out, their appearance stands out. Their wardrobe undoubtedly reminds one of African American fashion.|$|E
25|$|International {{service from}} Edinburgh began in 1962 with a direct service to Dublin, <b>but</b> <b>for</b> <b>many</b> years {{international}} flights were charter and private only.

By the mid-1980s direct routes included Paris, Düsseldorf, Brussels, Frankfurt and Copenhagen, but until the Open Skies Act in 1990, all transatlantic flights had to land first at Prestwick, with very few exceptions. By the time BAA had been privatised in 1987, Edinburgh Airport handled over 1.8 million passengers each year; compared to the 681,000 passengers handled in 1971 when BAA first {{took control of the}} airport.|$|E
