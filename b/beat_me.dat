25|$|In the 13th lecture, Cyril of Jerusalem {{discusses}} the Crucifixion and burial of Jesus Christ. The main themes that Cyril focuses on in these lectures are Original sin and Jesus’ sacrificing himself {{to save us}} from our sins. Also, the burial and Resurrection which occurred three days later proving the divinity of Jesus Christ and the loving nature of the Father. Cyril was very adamant {{about the fact that}} Jesus went to his death with full knowledge and willingness. Not only did he go willingly but throughout the process he maintained his faith and forgave all those who betrayed him and engaged in his execution. Cyril writes “who did not sin, neither was deceit found in his mouth, who, when he was reviled, did not revile, when he suffered did not threaten”. This line by Cyril shows his belief in the selflessness of Jesus especially in this last final act of Love. The lecture also gives a sort of insight to what Jesus may have been feeling during the execution from the whippings and beatings, to the crown of thorns, to the nailing on the cross. Cyril intertwines the story with the messages Jesus told throughout his life before his execution relating to his final act. For example, Cyril writes “I gave my back to those who <b>beat</b> <b>me</b> and my cheeks to blows; and my face I did not shield from the shame of spitting”. This clearly reflects the teachings of Jesus to turn the other cheeks and not raising your hands against violence because violence just begets violence begets violence. The segment of the Catechesis really reflects the voice Cyril maintained in all of his writing. The writings always have the central message of the Bible; Cyril is not trying to add his own beliefs in reference to religious interpretation and remains grounded in true biblical teachings.|$|E

In 1972, he said, [...] "Sour grapes {{to criticize the}} man who <b>beat</b> <b>me,</b> but I just wouldn't be human if I said I liked spending {{the second half of}} my life as 'the man who Nixon beat'". After Nixon resigned as President, Voorhis, noted, [...] "Here is the philosophy of doing-anything-to-win receiving its just and proper reward." [...] Voorhis, believing he had been labeled a subversive by Nixon, [...] "took some satisfaction" [...] in stating that Nixon himself had been the subversive, seeking, according to Voorhis, to impose [...] "a virtual dictatorship" [...] on the country.|$|E

She also discovered that young men, including her brothers, shared the feeling of shame over losing to girls.

Sudeep's performance in Naan Ee impressed filmmaker Chimbu Deven, who cast him as the antagonist in Puli (2015).|$|E
500|$|After McCain and Palin were {{defeated}} in the general election, a Republican campaign advisor told The New York Times that the McCain Campaign was not happy about the prank, which caused friction between McCain and Palin. McCain and his advisors were allegedly upset that Palin did not tell them beforehand that she planned to speak with who she thought was Nicolas Sarkozy. McCain strategist Steve Schmidt called a meeting and demanded to know who let Palin talk to the fake Sarkozy without checking with senior advisors first. Steve Biegun, one of Palin's aides admitting to vetting the call without speaking to campaign advisors or the U.S. State Department, told the Los Angeles Times that [...] "No one's going to <b>beat</b> <b>me</b> up more than I beat myself up for setting up the governor like that." ...|$|E
500|$|All {{television}} match players wore small microphones so {{that their}} words {{and the sounds of}} play could be heard by the audience. After Bell's second 9 ball break, Balukas reportedly muttered within the range of the microphone words to the effect that Bell was having a string of inordinately lucky shots. She was cautioned by the referee and play continued, with Balukas the ultimate victor with a final score of 9–5. According to an interview with Balukas appearing in New York Woman magazine in 1991, Balukas's exact words were [...] "Some world championship... <b>beat</b> <b>me</b> with skill, not luck." [...] Despite their off-the-table friendship, following the match Bell made a formal complaint to the WPBA about the incident. The WPBA's board of directors thereafter sanctioned Balukas $200 for unsportsmanlike conduct.|$|E

On December 29, 1955, Houtteman's first son, Jeff, was born with assistance from National Football League player Leon Hart, who was visiting Houtteman and helped deliver the baby.|$|E

500|$|Second, Schulz is {{credited}} with being the first center to {{step back from the}} line while playing defense. [...] Prior to Schulz's innovation, centers played in the line on defense. [...] In 1905, Schulz began dropping back from the line, enabling him to use his speed to move laterally and giving him greater coverage across the field of play. [...] At the time, the innovation was referred to as a [...] "roving center", but it was effectively the birth of the linebacker position in American football. [...] Asked how he developed the [...] "roving center" [...] idea, Schulz noted that the backs started from five yards behind the line and concluded, [...] "No back living could move five yards while I was moving four". [...] He described his thinking to Coach Yost this way: [...] "It's all very simple, Yost. The ball carrier travels five yards while I travel only four yard to meet him. [...] I know of no back who can <b>beat</b> <b>me</b> in a five-yard race after giving me a one-yard handicap".|$|E
500|$|Lavender {{made his}} MLB debut on April23, 1912 as a relief pitcher in a 5–3 {{loss to the}} Pittsburgh Pirates.

The loss appeared to affect Marquard {{for the remainder of the}} season, though he regained his form in the 1912 World Series. During the 1913season, upon the ending of an 11-game winning streak by Washington Senators pitcher Joe Boehling, Marquard commented, [...] "I know just how Boehling feels.

500|$|Ali {{learned that}} his {{regurgitation}} talents {{had the potential to}} entertain and to earn money through performance at the age of fifteen:I tried out my tricks first of all in the street, swallowing many glasses of water and then pouring forth a great fountain {{from one side of the}} road to the other... A cafe proprietor saw me doing this one day, and chased me down the street. I thought he wanted to <b>beat</b> <b>me</b> up, but no—all he did was to put a coin in my hand and ask me to repeat the trick. Finally, he was so delighted that he asked me to come to his cafe and entertain the customers. Taking his abilities on the road, Ali met an Italian man in Cairo who signed him to a contract for music hall performances. Ali performed under contract throughout Europe and at times for heads of state. According to Ali, in or about 1914 he was summoned by Tsar NicholasII of Russia to perform at the Winter Palace in Saint Petersburg, Russia. He stated that the Tsar [...] "must have liked my performance because he awarded me a special decoration, which is now one of my most treasured possessions." [...] Following World War I, Ali began managing his own affairs and toured the world, learning more tricks as he went.|$|E

I was hitting the dirt so smooth, so fast, when I hit the dirt, there wasn't no hesitation. It was like a skid mark, like you throw a rock on the water and skid off it.
