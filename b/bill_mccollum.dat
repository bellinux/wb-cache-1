While Borislow maintained that his company's actions were not illegal, he reached a settlement on April 15, agreeing to pay the state of Florida $125,000 {{for the cost of}} the investigation. He said the company resolved over 500 complaints and added a disclaimer on the website clarifying the misconception.|$|E

5000|$|In 2011 Rep.

[...] The <b>McCollum</b> <b>bill</b> was initially defeated, but reintroduced by the congresswoman a second time, when it narrowly passed with bipartisan support. It was ultimately dropped by the U.S. Senate. In 2012, McCollum again attempted to defund military music programs by reintroducing her amendment. In an effort to preempt further action by McCollum, the U.S. Air Force proactively disbanded one-third of its regional bands and sharply {{cut the number of}} billets of two others. Other service branches have prepared and staffed proposals to follow suit.|$|R

2500|$|In {{his final}} {{involvement}} with the game, on 12 May, Thompson {{sent a letter to}} Florida Attorney General <b>Bill</b> <b>McCollum</b> and Florida Governor Charlie Crist which read, in part, [...] "Florida retailers are scheduled to sell a very violent video game called Manhunt 2 which will be available, remarkably, for [...] "play" [...] on the kids-friendly Nintendo Wii gaming platform.

[...] This prompted McCollum to look into the situation. In a 6 June interview on Fox News, McCollum subsequently expressed concerns regarding how Manhunt 2 utilized the Wii Remote in an interactive manner; for instance, in order to stab someone, the player would have to flick the Remote forward, in much the same fashion one would do when actually stabbing with a knife; when cutting someone's throat, the player would have to move the remote from left to right.
