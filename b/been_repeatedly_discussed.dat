This was the first of five expansions, the last of which was in 1963. In 1975 the town burial site was moved to the newly created Parkfriedhof Junkerberg.

40|$|Extract] Di Georgi {{and colleagues}} propose that {{sentinel}} {{lymph node biopsy}} (SLNB) {{does not provide a}} real survival benefit and that the disease-free survival benefit is a result of lead-time bias. These are old arguments that have <b>been</b> <b>repeatedly</b> <b>discussed</b> in the literature. A reiterative statement of these arguments does not make them truer. The only new idea in the letter of Di Georgi and colleagues is to designate the gain of disease-free survival time as lead-time bias that shows that they did not really understand the concept of lead time bias...|$|E

So far, however, no quantitative estimate on the thermal noise of these reflective structures exists. In this work we present a theoretical calculation of a grating reflector’s noise. We further apply it to a proposed third generation gravitational wave detector. Depending on the grating geometry, the grating material, and the temperature, we obtain a thermal noise decrease by up to a factor of 10 compared to conventional dielectric mirrors. Thus the use of grating reflectors can substantially improve the noise performance in metrological applications...|$|E

This is indeed the case with INSPECT, which {{in addition to having}} a good perceptual match (smartphone orientation matches that of the movement plane), benefits from the use small muscle-groups [38], since most of the work is done by the fingers. Finally, the technique works with the dominant hand fingers interacting very close to the off-hand palm. This establishes a frame of reference for the dominant hand to manipulate against [39].

Studies on arthropathies associated with HIV- 1 or HTLV- 1 infection as well as new experimental animal models like the Tax transgene mice and new data from the MLR/lpr mouse model might help to answer the questions how and by what mechanisms retroviral infection may lead to autoimmune rheumatic diseases.

40|$|This article revisits one {{historical}} event that has <b>been</b> <b>repeatedly</b> <b>discussed</b> {{in the literature}} on democratic breakdown: {{the rise and fall of}} Argentine democracy between 1916 and 1930. First, we demonstrate why the claim that demands for drastic redistribution led to democratic breakdown is not a convincing explanation for the 1930 coup. Instead, we contend that the coup was the product of a polarizing political realignment that led to a legitimacy crisis. We evaluate this argument using estimates of Argentine legislators ’ latent preferences (ideal points) between 1916 and 1930. Our roll-call data analysis suggests that disputes over socio-economic issues did not precipitate the breakdown of the regime. What mattered was the allocation of political power. These findings support the view that stable democracy requires that all major groups in society have a sufficiently large chance of being in power...|$|E

40|$|International audienceTome´Purpose {{of review}} This review {{presents}} the different pathways by which protein and amino acid impact glucose control. The review more particularly discusses the contradictory effects {{reported in the}} literature on the involvement of amino acid on glucose production and in insulin secretion and sensitivity.

However, thorough examination of the odor and flavor profiles of the intra-uterine environment might support our understanding of early sensory triggers and potential sensory conditioning processes. Therefore, the aim {{of the present study was}} to characterize specific odorants in individual samples of amniotic fluid and to identify the most potent odor-active substances in this physiological fluid by means of gas chromatography olfactometry and aroma extract dilution analysis. The identification led to six new substances, which were not reported, to the best of our knowledge, for amniotic fluid before—among them the two steroids 5 α-androst- 16 -en- 3 -one and 4, 16 -androstadien- 3 -one...|$|R

40|$|While {{leadership}} in voluntary organizations {{is important to}} the understanding of voluntary action, not enough is known about differences between leaders and mem-bers in voluntary organizations. This study explored the differences between leaders and members in local voluntary organizations in the U. S. and Israel. Using discrim-inant function analysis on demographic characteristics, social psychological varia-bles, and cost-benefit relationships it was found that leaders differ significantly from members in several of these areas. Patterns of greatest similarity were found be-tween the American and Israeli participants on the social psychological variables. Gender distinguished members from leaders in Israel; occupation and education did so in the U. S. A very significant finding in the area of costs and benefits was that leaders perceived their activism as more costly than did members; leaders viewed costs to their participation as being equal to benefits while members perceived more benefits than costs. The importance of citizen participation in voluntary organizations throughout the world has <b>been</b> <b>repeatedly</b> <b>discussed.</b> One enigma is: If participation is such a goo...|$|E
40|$|This paper aims at {{understanding}} how adventure games can support educational goals by understanding {{the foundations of}} their design, and what how inherent properties lend themselves to specific types of learning. The potential of adventure games as educational tools has <b>been</b> <b>repeatedly</b> <b>discussed</b> {{from the standpoint of}} education (Carroll, 1982; Cavallari, Hedberg & Harper, 1992; Ju & Wagner, 1997; Amory, Naicker Vincent & Adams, 1999; Moser, 2002; Dickey, 2006), usually focusing on the narrative framing that adventure games provide (Dickey, 2006), but not on their specific design conventions. Understanding adventure games entails {{understanding how}} their design helps the player learn. There are two key aspects of adventure games that are discussed here, derived from the puzzle-driven nature of adventure games: domain knowledge and insight. The domain specifies the knowledge that the player must have in order to solve the puzzles in the game, whereas insight takes place when the player figures out the solution to the puzzle. This paper analyzes how game design can set up the domain, what are the aspects of the game that facilitate insight and, more importantly, how these design properties of adventure games can be harnessed to develop educational games...|$|E
40|$|A consanguineous {{origin of}} the sparry {{siderite}} and magnesite mineralizations of the Eastern Alps has <b>been</b> <b>repeatedly</b> <b>discussed</b> in the past, often without the back-up of sound scientificarguments. Here, it is shown that the characteristics of these mineralizations including structures, fluid parameters, timing etc. are amazingly similar suggesting in fact the genetic linkage of these deposits. The siderite {{as well as the}} magnesite mineralizations of the Eastern Alps exhibit metasomatic-epigenetic structures of lens-shaped orebodies with dolomitic alteration rims as dominant features. The basic chemical characteristics of the ore forming fluids in these mineralizations are those of highly fractionated hypersaline fluids exhibiting all the features of residual bittern brines. Fluid invasion and mineralization structures strictly depend on the original lithology of the host rocks, mainly carbonatic sedimentary rocks. In Late Triassic times, these buried evaporitic brines were mobilized either by magmatic/metamorphic processes in the underlying crystalline units or by the superimposed sedimentary upload of the Triassic platform carbonates thus leading to magnesite formation. Initially these residual, bittern brineswere completely free of Fe and rich in Mg suitable for the formation of magnesite. Deeperand more extensive circulation of these fluids and their interaction with the host-rock, resulted in the uptake of Fe and the formation of siderite. </p...|$|E

Partridge’s notion of Occulture as ‘ordinary’, the emphasis he places on acts of spiritual and religious bricolage, {{and the ways in which}} his formulation of an “invisible community” behind occulture challenges the tendency to detach ‘spiritual’ and ‘mystical’ visual culture from social and political power struggles are all examined. I emphasize the complex blurring of Christianity and Occultism in Whistler’s art and letters to the press, the important shifts in the critical discourse surrounding his works between 1860 and 1900, and the ways in which his visual productions should be seen as sites not of authentic numinous experience so much as spaces in which boundaries between the sacred and the secular, the religious and the spiritual <b>were</b> negotiated and <b>repeatedly</b> re-drawn...|$|R
