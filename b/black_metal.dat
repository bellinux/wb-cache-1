5|$|Although {{bands like}} Sarcofago had been donning corpsepaint, by 1990, Mayhem was {{regularly}} wearing corpsepaint; many other <b>black</b> <b>metal</b> acts also adopted the look. Bathory inspired the Viking metal and folk metal movements and Immortal brought blast beats to the fore. Some bands in the Scandinavian <b>black</b> <b>metal</b> scene became associated with considerable {{violence in the}} early 1990s, with Mayhem and Burzum linked to church burnings. Growing commercial hype around death metal generated a backlash; beginning in Norway, much of the Scandinavian metal underground shifted to support a <b>black</b> <b>metal</b> scene that resisted being co-opted by the commercial metal industry.|$|E
5|$|Brandon Stosuy, of Pitchfork Media, {{talked of}} a <b>black</b> <b>metal</b> {{influence}} in the album's imagery. Anderson responded to the claim of <b>black</b> <b>metal</b> influence by stating {{that he does not}} know why people compare his music to black metal; he hypothesized that it is simply the raw production of the music, or the double 'i' in the band name.|$|E
5|$|By 1992, <b>black</b> <b>metal</b> scenes {{had begun}} to emerge in areas outside Scandinavia, {{including}} Germany, France, and Poland. The 1993 murder of Mayhem's Euronymous by Burzum's Varg Vikernes provoked intensive media coverage. Around 1996, when many in the scene felt the genre was stagnating, several key bands, including Burzum and Finland's Beherit, moved toward an ambient style, while symphonic <b>black</b> <b>metal</b> was explored by Sweden's Tiamat and Switzerland's Samael. In the late 1990s and early 2000s decade, Norway's Dimmu Borgir brought <b>black</b> <b>metal</b> closer to the mainstream, as did Cradle of Filth.|$|E

5|$|Mercyful Fate {{were a part}} of {{the first}} wave of <b>black</b> <b>metal,</b> along with other groups, such as Venom, Bathory and Hellhammer. Many of these groups helped {{establish}} the style upon which future <b>black</b> <b>metal</b> artists would later build. Unlike the other first wave bands, typical elements of Mercyful Fate's style are influences from progressive rock, epic 1970s hard rock and traditional heavy metal. As many of the band's songs featured lyrics about Satanism and the occult and King Diamond was among the first <b>black</b> <b>metal</b> musicians to use the now famous corpse paint, Mercyful Fate was a pioneer in developing <b>black</b> <b>metal,</b> although their musical style was not as much an influence as that of other first wave bands.|$|E
5|$|Some {{members of}} the Norwegian <b>black</b> <b>metal</b> scene were {{motivated}} to take violent action against this influence – for instance, the church burnings by <b>black</b> <b>metal</b> musicians Varg Vikernes, Samoth, Faust, and Jørn Inge Tunsberg, among others. While most bands or individuals did not go that far, an undercurrent of racism, nationalism, and anti-Semitism continues to permeate parts of the <b>black</b> <b>metal</b> scene. Many Viking metal artists, however, including bands such as Enslaved and Einherjer, simply express interest in Vikings and Norse mythology and entirely reject the Satanic inclination of <b>black</b> <b>metal,</b> writing almost exclusively on Norse themes, without any racist or anti-Semitic undertones. Whereas <b>black</b> <b>metal</b> during the 1990s took a militant and destructive stance toward the status quo, Viking metal looked {{to the past and}} took a populist, anti-system approach which eschewed violence. Viking metal is both pre-Christian and post-apocalyptic– it looks to a pre-Christian past and imagines a post-Christian future. While opposition to Christianity drove the formation of Viking metal, some bands that play, or have played, Viking metal, such as Slechtvalk, Drottnar, and Holy Blood, subscribe to Christian beliefs.|$|E
5|$|Antestor (then called Crush Evil) existed {{prior to}} the release of Hellig Usvart but their music was a death/doom style, and was not yet musically {{considered}} <b>black</b> <b>metal.</b> During the early 1990s when the band was known as Crush Evil, Euronymous, guitarist for the seminal <b>black</b> <b>metal</b> band Mayhem, was planning to stop Crush Evil from continuing. However, this never took place.|$|E

5|$|Mercyful Fate is a Danish {{heavy metal}} band from Copenhagen, formed in 1981 by vocalist King Diamond and guitarist Hank Shermann. Influenced by {{progressive}} rock and hard rock, with lyrics dealing with Satan and the occult, Mercyful Fate {{were part of}} the first wave of <b>black</b> <b>metal</b> in the early to mid-1980s. Many of the bands from this movement went on to influence later <b>black</b> <b>metal</b> musicians in the 1990s, particularly in Norway. Since the band's inception in 1981, Mercyful Fate have released seven studio albums, two extended plays and four compilations.|$|E
5|$|Viking metal {{emerged from}} <b>black</b> <b>metal</b> {{during the late}} 1980s and early 1990s, sharing with <b>black</b> <b>metal</b> an {{opposition}} to Christianity, but rejecting Satanism and occult themes {{in favor of the}} Vikings and paganism. It is similar, in lyrics, sound, and thematic imagery, to pagan metal, but pagan metal has a broader mythological focus and uses folk instrumentation more extensively. Most Viking metal bands originate from the Nordic countries, and nearly all bands claim that their members descend, directly or indirectly, from Vikings. Many scholars view Viking metal and the related black, pagan, and folk metal genres as part of broader modern Pagan and neo-völkisch movements as well as part of a global movement of renewed interest in, and celebration of, local and regional ethnicities.|$|E
5|$|Industrial metal {{developed}} in the late 1980s, as industrial and metal began to fuse into a common genre. In {{the early years of}} the 21st century, groups from the <b>black</b> <b>metal</b> scene began to incorporate elements of industrial music. Industrial metal did well in the early 1990s, particularly in North America, with the success of groups such as Nine Inch Nails. The industrial metal movement began to fade in the latter half of the 1990s.|$|E
500|$|The {{front cover}} of the band's debut album, I.N.R.I., is {{regarded}} as a great influence on <b>black</b> <b>metal's</b> corpse paint style make-up. That record is also considered one of the [...] "first wave" [...] albums that helped shape the genre. Their second LP, The Laws of Scourge, {{was one of the first}} technical death metal records to be released.|$|R

5|$|Many subgenres {{of heavy}} metal {{developed}} {{outside of the}} commercial mainstream during the 1980s such as crossover thrash. Several {{attempts have been made}} to map the complex world of underground metal, most notably by the editors of AllMusic, as well as critic Garry Sharpe-Young. Sharpe-Young's multivolume metal encyclopedia separates the underground into five major categories: thrash metal, death metal, <b>black</b> <b>metal,</b> power metal, and the related subgenres of doom and gothic metal.|$|E
5|$|Some of {{the members}} still play in the <b>black</b> <b>metal</b> band Vaakevandring, who played a reunion concert in 2007 {{together}} with Antestor at the Endtime Festival held {{at the end of}} March 2007 in Halmstad. Antestor performed the concert with numerous session musicians. In this concert the band announced that this is their last live show for a while.|$|E
5|$|The album {{received}} mixed reviewssome critics {{claimed it}} was fresh and a new sound, while others argued it was very similar to music already available. Desolate North has an extremely slow rhythm and has only limited vocals. The music is interspersed with various woodland sounds, such as running water and footsteps. The natural imagery used on the album is reminiscent of that used in <b>black</b> <b>metal,</b> but the music is closer to ambient.|$|E
50|$|In late 1997, Kristoffer Rygg invited keyboardist, sound conceptualist, and {{composer}} Tore Ylwizaker into the collective, {{and together they}} created a strategy for The Blake Album. Musically, the album transcended <b>black</b> <b>metal’s</b> aesthetics to create a genre-defying work and employed everything from ambient and classical sounds to industrial, prog metal, and art rock. The title alone being a loud signal that Ulver had changed somewhat.|$|R
5000|$|Alcest's second album, Écailles de Lune (Scales of the Moon), was {{released}} March 29, 2010.

5|$|Thematically, Viking metal draws {{extensively}} on elements of <b>black</b> <b>metal,</b> but the lyrics and imagery are pagan and Norse rather than anti-Christian or Satanic. It combines the exaltation {{of violence and}} virility through weapons and battlefields, which is common to many death and <b>black</b> <b>metal</b> bands, {{with an interest in}} ancestral roots, particularly a pre-Christian heritage, which is expressed through Viking mythology and imagery of northern landscapes. Some bands such as Sorhin keep the Satanic elements of <b>black</b> <b>metal</b> but musically are influenced by more recent folk tunes. Visuals such as album art, band photos, website design, and merchandise all highlight the dark and violent outlook of Viking metal lyrics and themes. The art on albums by Viking metal artists frequently depicts Viking Age archeological finds: Thor's hammers are especially common, but other artifacts such as Oseberg posts and even the Sutton Hoo helmet have appeared. Some bands incorporate far more ancient, pre-medieval imagery, such as the Finnish band Moonsorrow's use of prehistoric rock carvings and megaliths. Other Finnish bands, such as Ensiferum, Turisas, and Korpiklaani, focus on Sami traditions and shamanism, further stretching the definition of Viking metal. Not all bands rely on Viking-related visuals or other ancestral images to aid their musical character: for instance, the members of Týr do not wear Viking costumes on stage, and only their folk-influenced music and lyrical themes distinguish them from other heavy metal bands.|$|E
5|$|Anderson {{admits that}} there may be death metal {{influences}} in the vocals, but says {{that it was not a}} conscious design, and that the music does not have any other similarities to death metal. He claims that there are no <b>black</b> <b>metal</b> influences. He says that describing Celestiial's music as folk is a bad idea, as folk is such a broad, vague description as to make it meaningless. He says that what he is creating is neither folk, nor traditional, and even the harp songs are not traditional works, though they are influenced by the traditional music of the United Kingdom and traditional Irish music.|$|E
5|$|Combining {{elements}} of death metal, thrash metal, <b>black</b> <b>metal,</b> progressive metal and industrial music, Strapping Young Lad's music {{was characterized by}} the use of polyrhythmic guitar riffing and drumming, blast beats and Wall of Sound production. The band's musical direction was mainly determined by Townsend, whose battle with bipolar disorder and dark sense of humour were major influences on his songwriting. Townsend was also noted for his eccentric appearance and on-stage behaviour, which greatly contributed to the band's intense live performances.|$|E

5|$|During the 1980s, glam metal {{became popular}} with {{groups such as}} Mötley Crüe and Poison. Underground scenes {{produced}} an array of more aggressive styles: thrash metal broke into the mainstream with bands such as Metallica, Megadeth, Slayer, and Anthrax, while other extreme subgenres of metal such as death metal and <b>black</b> <b>metal</b> remain subcultural phenomena. Since the mid-1990s popular styles have further expanded {{the definition of the}} genre. These include groove metal (with bands such as Pantera, Sepultura, and Lamb of God) and nu metal (with bands such as Korn, Slipknot, and Linkin Park), the latter of which often incorporates elements of grunge and hip hop.|$|E
5|$|Former guitarist Scott Danough {{has said}} that he is {{influenced}} by metal and hardcore bands, like At The Gates, Slayer, Cradle of Filth, Integrity and Earth Crisis. Vocalist Brandan Schieppati has also mentioned American thrash metal bands as an influence on Bleeding Through, e.g. Testament or Exodus. In an interview, guitarist Brian Leppke added Cro-Mags, Entombed, Crowbar and Pantera as well to the list of influences. Lastly, keyboardist Marta Peterson is the one who brings industrial, symphonic <b>black</b> <b>metal,</b> and goth inspirations to the band's sound.|$|E
5|$|In 1997, Antestor {{recorded}} a promotional CD titled Kongsblod.

Cacophonous signed a record deal for 2 albums with Antestor. In 1998, Cacophonous released Kongsblod under a different name, The Return of the Black Death, and changed the original cover art of a famous Norwegian painting to artwork by Joe Petagno, a well-known American heavy metal cover art creator.|$|E
