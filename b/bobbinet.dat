He continued until being arrested again on 25 April 1827, when police charged Solomon with theft and receiving. The goods involved were 6 watches, 3Â½ yards of woollen cloth, 17 shawls, 12 pieces of Valentia cloth, lace, <b>bobbinet,</b> caps and other articles. Solomon was committed for trial and lodged in Newgate Prison.|$|E

60|$|Super-extraordinary Pocket-Handkerchief, French cambric, {{trimmed and}} worked, in account with <b>Bobbinet</b> & Gull.|$|E
6000|$|... "This {{handkerchief}} cost ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS, Clara," [...] said Eudosia, deliberately {{and with}} emphasis, imitating, {{as near as}} possible, the tone of <b>Bobbinet</b> & Co.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, ma'am, we OUGHT in {{justice to}} {{ourselves}} to have $120 for that article; but, to our regular customers I believe Mr. <b>Bobbinet</b> has determined to ask ONLY $100." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{is really}} very pretty, Mr. <b>Bobbinet,</b> very pretty, but Miss Monson bought one not quite as pretty, at Lace's; and SHE payed SIXTY-FIVE, if I am not mistaken." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, Mr. <b>Bobbinet,</b> this is {{the highest}} priced {{handkerchief}} that was ever sold in New York." [...] This was said {{with a sort of}} rapture, the fair creature feeling all the advantage of having so good an opportunity of purchasing so dear an article.|$|E
6000|$|After a short negotiation, it {{was settled}} that Mr. Halfacre was to receive $50, and <b>Bobbinet</b> & Co. were to replace me in their drawer. The next morning an article {{appeared}} in a daily paper of pre-eminent honesty and truth, and talents, in the following words:-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh! Fifty dollars go to {{the poor}} girl who does the work, twenty-five more to the odious custom-house, some fifteen to rent, fuel, lights, and ten, perhaps, to Mr. <b>Bobbinet,</b> as profits. Now all this is very good, and very useful to society, as you must own." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{is quite}} surprising, colonel," [...] {{observed}} Mr. <b>Bobbinet,</b> when his customers were properly out of hearing, [...] "that THESE young ladies should let such an article slip through their fingers. Their father {{is one of}} the richest men we have; and yet they never even asked the price." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{approve of}} your motives, Mr. Halfacre," [...] {{returned}} <b>Bobbinet,</b> [...] "but {{you know the}} character of the times, and the dearness of rents. That article has been seen in private hands, doubtless, and can no longer be considered fresh--we shall be forced to make a considerable abatement, if we consent to comply." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Can't I persuade {{you to take}} THIS?" [...] demanded <b>Bobbinet,</b> as {{they were}} turning away. [...] "There is not its equal in America. Indeed, one of the house, our Colonel Silky, who has just {{returned}} from Paris, says it was worked expressly for the dauphine, who was prevented from getting it by the late revolution." ...|$|E
60|$|A smile, {{a slight}} blush, and curtsy, {{concluded}} the interview; {{and the young}} ladies hastily left the shop. Mr. <b>Bobbinet</b> was disappointed, as, indeed, was Col. Silky, who was present, en amateur; but the matter could not be helped, as these were customers who acted and thought for themselves, and all the oily persuasion of shop-eloquence could not influence them.|$|E
60|$|When I {{found myself}} {{once more in}} the {{possession}} of <b>Bobbinet</b> & Co., I fancied that I might anticipate a long residence in their drawers, my freshness, as an article, having been somewhat tarnished by the appearance at Mrs. Trotter's ball. In this I was mistaken, the next day bringing about a release, and a restoration to my proper place in society.|$|E
60|$|Luckily for {{the views}} of <b>Bobbinet</b> & Co., we were all still lying on the counter. This is deemed a {{fortunate}} circumstance in the contingencies of this species of trade, since it enables the dealer to offer his uncalled-for wares in the least suspicious and most natural manner. It was fortunate, also, that I lay {{at the bottom of}} the little pile--a climax being quite as essential in sustaining an extortionate price, as in terminating with due effect, a poem, a tragedy, or a romance.|$|E
60|$|It is {{unnecessary}} {{to dwell on}} the remainder of this dialogue, my own adventures so soon carrying me into an entirely different sphere. The following morning, however, as soon as he had breakfasted, Mr. Halfacre put me in his pocket, and walked down street, with the port of an afflicted and stricken, but thoroughly honest man. When he reached the shop-door of <b>Bobbinet</b> & Co., he walked boldly in, and laid me on the counter with a flourish so meek, that even the clerks, a very matter-of-fact caste in general, afterwards commented on it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Good morning, Miss Halfacre," [...] said Mr. <b>Bobbinet,</b> bowing and smiling; if {{his face}} had been half as honest as it professed to be, it would have GRINNED. [...] "I am glad you have come in at this moment, as {{we are about to}} put on sale some of the rarest articles, in the way of pocket-handkerchiefs, that have ever come to this market. The Misses Burton have just seen them, and THEY {{pronounce}} them the most beautiful articles of the sort they have ever seen; and I believe they have been over half the world." ...|$|E
60|$|To this <b>Bobbinet</b> assented. The {{young lady}} tripped into her carriage, and was {{instantly}} whirled from the door. In precisely forty-three minutes, a maid entered, {{half out of}} breath, and laid {{a note on the}} counter. The latter contained Mr. Halfacre's check for one hundred dollars, and a request from the fair Eudosia that I might be delivered to her messenger. Every thing was done as she had desired, and, in five minutes, I was going up Broadway as fast as Honor O'Flagherty's (for such {{was the name of the}} messenger) little dumpy legs could carry me.|$|E
6000|$|Mr. <b>Bobbinet</b> {{attended}} these {{customers in}} person. Practiced {{in all that}} portion of human knowledge which appertains to a salesman, he let the sweet girls select two or three dozen handkerchiefs of great beauty, but totally without ornament, and even pay for them, before he said a word {{on the subject of}} the claims of his reserved corps. When he thought the proper moment had arrived, however, one of the least decorated of our party was offered to the consideration of the young ladies. The sisters were named Anne and Maria, and I could see by the pleasure that beamed in the soft blue eyes of the former, that she was quite enchanted with the beauty of the article laid before her so unexpectedly. I believe it is in FEMALE [...] "human nature" [...] to admire every thing that is graceful and handsome, and especially when it takes the form of needle-work. The sweet girls praised handkerchief after handkerchief, until I was laid before them, when their pleasure extracted exclamations of delight. All was done so quietly, however, and in so lady-like a manner, that the attention of no person in the shop was drawn to them by this natural indulgence of surprise. Still I observed that neither of the young lades inquired the PRICES, these being considerations that had no influence on the intrinsic value, in their eyes; while the circumstance caused my heart to sink within me, as it clearly proved they did not intend to purchase, and I longed to become the property of the gentle, serene-eyed Anne. After thanking Mr. <b>Bobbinet</b> for the trouble he had taken, they ordered their purchases sent home, and were about to quit the shop.|$|E
6000|$|The {{following}} words--"we {{take this}} occasion to thank Messrs. <b>Bobbinet</b> & Co. for a specimen of most beautiful gloves sent us," [...] had a line run {{through in the}} manuscript; a little reflection, telling the learned editor {{that it might be}} indiscreet to publish the fact at that precise moment. The American will know how to appreciate the importance of this opinion, in relation to the house in question, when he is told that it was written by one of those inspired moralists, and profound constitutional lawyers, and ingenious political economists, who daily teach their fellow creatures how to give practical illustrations of the mandates of the Bible, how to discriminate in vexed questions arising from the national compact, and how to manage their private affairs {{in such a way as}} to escape the quicksands that have wrecked their own.|$|E
6000|$|... "WORTHY OF IMITATION.--A {{distinguished}} gentleman of this city, H---- H----, Esquire, {{having been}} compelled to SUSPEND, in {{consequence of the}} late robbery of the Bank of the United States by the cold-blooded miscreant whose hoary head disgraces the White House, felt himself bound to return an article of dress, purchased as recently as yesterday by his lovely daughter, and who, in every respect, was entitled to wear it, as she would have adorned it, receiving back the price, {{with a view to}} put it in the fund he is already collecting to meet the demands of his creditors. It is due to the very respectable firm of <b>Bobbinet</b> & Co. to add, that it refunded the money with the greatest liberality, at the first demand. We can recommend this house to our readers as one of the most liberal in OUR city, (by the way the editor who wrote this article didn't own a foot of the town, or of any thing else,) and as possessing a very large and well selected assortment of the choicest goods." ...|$|E
60|$|Thus {{the account}} stood the day I was first {{offered to the}} admiration of the fair of New York. Mr. <b>Bobbinet,</b> however, was {{in no hurry to}} exhibit me, having several {{articles}} of less beauty, that he was anxious to get off first. For my part, I was as desirous of being produced, as ever a young lady was to come out; and then my companions in the drawer were not of the most agreeable character. We were all pocket-handkerchiefs, together, and all of French birth. Of the whole party, I {{was the only one that}} had been worked by a real lady, and consequently my education was manifestly superior to those of my companions. THEY could scarcely be called comme il faut, at all; though, to own the truth, I am afraid there is tant soit peu de vulgarity about all WORKED pocket-handkerchiefs. I remember that, one day, when Madame de la Rocheaimard and Adrienne were discussing the expediency of buying our whole piece, with a view of offering us to their benefactress, the former, who had a fine tact in matters of this sort, expressed a doubt whether the dauphine would be pleased with such an offering.|$|E
60|$|<b>Bobbinet</b> & Co. did {{not exactly}} {{understand}} his more sophisticated partner; {{but before he}} had time to ask an explanation, the appearance of another customer caused his face to brighten, and changed the current of his thoughts. The person who now entered was an exceedingly brilliant looking girl of twenty, dressed in the height of fashion, and extremely well, though a severe critic might have thought she was OVER dressed for the streets, still she had alighted from a carriage. Her face was decidedly handsome, and her person exquisitely proportioned. As a whole, I had scarcely ever seen a young creature that could lay claim to more of the loveliness of her sex. Both the young ladies who had just left us were pleasing and pretty; and to own the truth, there was an air of modest refinement about them, that was not so apparent in this new visiter; but the dazzling appearance of the latter, at first, blinded me to her faults, and I saw nothing but her perfection. The interest manifested by the master--I beg his pardon, the boss of the store--and the agitation among the clerks, very plainly proved that much was expected from the visit of this young lady, who was addressed, with a certain air of shop-familiarity, as Miss Halfacre--a familiarity that showed she was an habituee of the place, and considered a good customer.|$|E

50|$|The {{majority}} of tulle is actually <b>bobbinet,</b> invented in Britain {{in the early}} 19th century. <b>Bobbinet</b> is made by wrapping the weft thread around the warp thread, creating a strong hexagonal design which tends not to twist or fall out of shape, because the wrapped threads maintain a state of tension. The result is tulle netting which is lightweight and surprisingly strong and durable for its weight.|$|E

5000|$|The {{original}} SAS {{design was}} based on two new fabrics: a type of [...] "powernet" [...] (or [...] "girdle fabric") for high-tension areas, and an elastic <b>bobbinet</b> weave for lower-tension areas. Both {{were based on a}} heavy elastic warp thread with a much less elastic weft thread to form a netting. The terms warp and weft are used loosely here, as the material was not woven using traditional means. Powernet used Spandex cord as the warp with nylon cord as the weft, allowing movement primarily along the warp axis. <b>Bobbinet</b> used cotton-wrapped rubber warp and nylon or Dacron weft, and was flexible in both directions. The cotton wrapping limited the maximum stretch to 200% of the rest length. The amount of over-pressure <b>bobbinet</b> could create was about [...] over the torso, the largest volume, and up to [...] over smaller radius curves on the wrist and ankles. Powernet could produce about [...] even on the torso. A minimum of [...] is needed for normal breathing.|$|E
