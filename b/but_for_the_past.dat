60|$|He {{sprang from}} a rugged stock, {{for he was}} a {{descendant}} of the Annandale Johnstones, whose crest was significantly the flying spur. Appleyard stood {{on the edge of}} the bleak moorlands that drop down to the western marshes of the Scottish border, and he knew every lonely rise and boggy flat that his mosstrooper ancestors had ridden on moonless nights. It is possible that in his youthful rambles across the high, wind-swept waste, he had acquired something that linked him to the past.

60|$|For {{seven hours}} the battle raged in the darkness. After losing three {{thousand}} men here, General Merci decided that his army {{would be totally}} destroyed if Enghien should bring his troops down from the hill at daybreak. Accordingly, leaving a body of musketeers to hide the movement by their fire, he withdrew {{the rest of his}} army and took up another strong position, partly on a height known as the Black Mountain, covering the entrance of the valley of St. Pierre and partly in the valley itself, thus covering his line of retreat. Had the French been able to attack early the next morning before the Bavarians had time to intrench themselves they might have won an easy victory; <b>but</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> twenty-four hours the rain had been falling incessantly, Turenne's army had been marching on the previous day, and had been fighting for seven hours, and was incapable of further exertions, while that of Enghien was in little better plight, having passed the night in the rain on the ground it had won.|$|E

When encouraged to speak out, the narrative of the temptation had so entirely agreed with what we had said as to show there had been no prevarication, and this had done more to convince my father that he was on the right track than the having found him on his knees. He had had a patient hearing, and thus was able to command his nerves enough to explain himself, and it had ended in my father giving entire forgiveness for what, as Griff truly said, would have been a mere trifle <b>but</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>past.</b> The voluntary confession had much impressed my father, and he could not help adding a word of gentle reproof to me for having joined in aiding him to withhold it, but he accepted my explanation and went away, observing, 'By the by, I don't wonder at what Griffith says of that room; I never heard such strange effects of currents of air.' ...|$|E
60|$|One Sunday morning, some {{twelve or}} {{fourteen}} {{months after the}} visit of Colonel John and the parrot-tragedy, Miss Wepley sat decorously in her pew in the parish church, immediately {{in front of that}} occupied by Groby Lington. She was, comparatively speaking a new-comer in the neighbourhood, and was not personally acquainted with her fellow-worshipper in the seat behind, <b>but</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> two years the Sunday morning service had brought them regularly within each other's sphere of consciousness. Without having paid particular attention to the subject, she could probably have given a correct rendering {{of the way in which}} he pronounced certain words occurring in the responses, while he was well aware of the trivial fact that, in addition to her prayer book and handkerchief, a small paper packet of throat lozenges always reposed on the seat beside her. Miss Wepley rarely had recourse to her lozenges, but in case she should be taken with a fit of coughing she wished to have the emergency duly provided for. On this particular Sunday the lozenges occasioned an unusual diversion in the even tenor of her devotions, far more disturbing to her personally than a prolonged attack of coughing would have been. As she rose to take part in the singing of the first hymn, she fancied that she saw the hand of her neighbour, who was alone in the pew behind her, make a furtive downward grab at the packet lying on the seat; on turning sharply round she found that the packet had certainly disappeared, but Mr. Lington was to all outward seeming serenely intent on his hymnbook. No amount of interrogatory glaring on the part of the despoiled lady could bring the least shade of conscious guilt to his face.|$|E

This study creates quarterly time series of exchange-market pressure for five Latin American countries, not only for two periods of crisis, <b>but</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> entire <b>past</b> decade. These series are then used in two separate analyses. The first addresses the macroeconomic determinants of this pressure, finding that current account deficits place the most pressure on a country's currency and that economic growth tends to reduce this pressure.

40|$|We have {{developed}} an improved model of global digital palaeo-plate boundaries and plate motion to describe the distribution and history of plates since the Late Jurassic. From this history we computed net lithospheric rotation (NR) through time confirming the so-called westward drift, <b>but</b> only <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> 30 Myr. <b>The</b> NR has significantly smaller magnitudes (0. 13 °/My, past 5 My) than for some other plate models; it averages to 0. 11 ± 0. 03 °/My <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> 50 My with a small but systematic increase toward the present.

40|$|Forty-eight {{patients}} with achondroplasia and 24 with hypochondroplasia have been reviewed {{in order to}} clarify {{the differences between the}} two disorders and establish the height, body proportions and other clinical and radiological variations within each group. Some ofthe “classical ” findings in achondroplasia are not always present, and hypochondroplasia at its most severe is indistinguishable from achondroplasia at its least severe. The frequency of spinal stenosis and neurological complications was established in an unselected group of 27 achondroplastic and 12 hypochondroplastic patients aged 10 years and over. Only three of the former were free of symptoms but only three developed serious complications (1 1 per cent). Measurement of radiographs of the lumbar canal did not in general correlate well with the severity of spinal stenosis symptoms, but it was found that the ratio of interpedicular distances at the first and fourth lumbar vertebrae had some value. Neurological complications were rare in {{patients with}} simple narrowing of the spinal canal or with persistence of a thoracolumbar kyphos but when these occurred together there was a high risk of serious neurological involvement.

30|$|The Nankai Trough in {{southwest}} Japan {{is among the}} most thoroughly studied subduction zones with many geological and geophysical investigations. Geological studies have suggested that subduction and accretion have been continuous since the late Cretaceous (e.g., Taira et al. 1988). Meanwhile, several global geologic events have occurred since then, including the early Cenozoic global reorganization of plate motions (e.g., Seton et al. 2015), back-arc spreading in the western Pacific margin (Karig 1971), and intra-continental deformation caused by the India-Asian collision (Tapponnier et al. 1982). Their effects on the subduction processes must be recorded in accretionary complexes, but the resulting phenomena of each event remains unclear.
