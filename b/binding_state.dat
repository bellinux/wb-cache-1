25|$|A revolutionary {{government}} met for {{the first}} time in November 1918. Known as the Council of People’s Commissioners, it consisted of three Majority Social Democrats (Friedrich Ebert, Philipp Scheidemann, and Otto Landsberg) and three United Social Democrats (Emil Barth, Wilhelm Dittman, and Hugo Haase). The new government faced a social crisis in the German Reich following the end of the First World War, with Germany threatened by hunger and chaos. There was, for the most part, an orderly return of soldiers back into civilian life, while the threat of starvation was combated. Wage levels were raised, universal proportional representation for all parliaments was introduced, and a series of regulations on unemployment benefits, job-creation and protection measures, health insurance, and pensions saw the institution of important political and social reforms. In February 1918, workers made an agreement with employers which secured them total freedom of association, the legal guarantee of an eight-hour workday, and the extension of wage agreements to all branches of trade and industry. The People’s Commissioners made these changes legally binding. In addition, the SPD-steered provisional government introduced <b>binding</b> <b>state</b> arbitration of labor conflicts, created worker’s councils in large industrial firms, and opened the path to the unionization of rural labourers. In December 1918, a decree was passed providing relief for the unemployed. This provided that communities were to be responsible for unemployment relief (without fixing an amount) and established that the Reich would contribute 50% and the respective German state 33% of the outlay. That same month, the government declared that labour exchanges were to be further developed with the financial assistance of the Reich. Responsibility for job placement was first transferred from the Demobilization Office to the Minister of Labour and then to the National Employment Exchange Office, which came into being in January 1920.|$|E
500|$|After the sudden, inexplicable {{death of}} a cow on the ranch, Homer sends Lonnie to town to bring Hud to the ranch for his opinion. [...] Lonnie, finding Hud {{just in time to}} take the blame for Hud's tryst with a married woman, protests Hud's putting him in a {{dangerous}} situation as they return to the ranch, with Hud driving over Alma's flowers as they arrive. [...] At the dead animal, Hud shoots several buzzards to scare the flock away against his father's protestations that they keep the land clean and shooting them is illegal. [...] Hud states his immunity to laws that inconvenience him, setting the tone of his overall demeanor. [...] Hud is annoyed by his father's decision to summon the state veterinarian, and suggests selling the animals to other ranchers before the news spreads; otherwise, government agents will kill all the cattle and destroy everything they have worked for. He blames his father for not realizing that the cheap Mexican cattle were sick before he bought them. Adhering to his principles, Homer ignores Hud's idea and waits for the veterinarian. Upon his arrival, the state veterinarian immediately issues a legally <b>binding</b> <b>State</b> Livestock Transfer Order directing the quarantine of the ranch for a possible foot-and-mouth disease outbreak.

40|$|The head or motor {{domain of}} the ncd (non-claret disjunctional) {{molecular}} motor is 41 % identical to that of kinesin, yet moves along microtubules {{in the opposite direction}} to kinesin. We show here that despite the reversed directionality of ncd, its kinetics in solution are homologous in key respects to those of kinesin. The rate limiting step, ADP release, occurs at 0. 0033 s- 1 at 100 mM NaCl and is accelerated approximately 1000 -fold when the motor binds to microtubules. Other reaction steps are all very fast (> 0. 1 s- 1) compared with ADP release, and the motor is consequently paused in the ncd. ADP <b>state</b> until microtubule <b>binding</b> occurs (Kd = 2 microM), at which point ADP release is triggered and the motor locks onto the microtubule in a rigor-like state. These data identify close functional homology between the strong <b>binding</b> <b>states</b> of kinesin and ncd, and in view of this we discuss a possible mechanism for directional reversal, in which the strong <b>binding</b> <b>states</b> of ncd and kinesin are functionally identical, but the weak <b>binding</b> <b>states</b> are biased in opposite directions...|$|R

The combined results allowed us to analyze the <b>binding</b> <b>states</b> of a drug to lipid bilayers, one on the water-membrane interface and another in the hydrocarbon region of the bilayer.

Grp78 recruitment to chaperone the misfolded proteins results in Grp78 dissociation from its conformational <b>binding</b> <b>state</b> of the transmembrane receptor proteins PERK, IRE1 and ATF6. Dissociation results in receptor homodimerisation and oligomerisation to an active state. The activated cytosolic domain of PERK phosphorylates the eIF2alpha, inhibiting translation and resulting in cell cycle arrest. The activated cytosolic domain of IRE1 cleaves the 26bp intron from its substrate XBP1, facilitating its translation to form the transcription factor XBP1. Activated ATF6 translocates to the Golgi, cleaved by proteases to form an active 50kDa fragment (ATF6 p50). ATF6 p50 and XBP1 bind ERSE promoters in the nucleus to produce upregulation of the proteins involved in the unfolded protein response.|$|E

40|$|Ligand-protein binding {{processes}} are essential in biological systems. A well-studied {{system is the}} binding of cyclic adenosine monophosphate to the cyclic nucleotide binding domain of the bacterial potassium channel MloK 1. Strikingly, the measured on-rate for cyclic adenosine monophosphate binding is two orders of magnitude slower than a simple Smoluchowski diffusion model would suggest. To resolve this discrepancy and to characterize the ligand-binding path in structural and energetic terms, we calculated 1100 ligand-binding molecular dynamics trajectories and tested two scenarios: In the first scenario, the ligand transiently binds to the protein surface and then diffuses along the surface into the binding site. In the second scenario, only ligands that reach the protein surface {{in the vicinity of}} the binding site proceed into the binding site. Here, a binding funnel, which increasingly confines the translational as well as the rotational degrees of freedom, determines the binding pathways and limits the on-rate. From the simulations, we identified five surface <b>binding</b> <b>states</b> and calculated the rates between these surface <b>binding</b> <b>states,</b> the <b>binding</b> site, and the bulk. We find that the transient binding of the ligands to the surface <b>binding</b> <b>states</b> does not affect the on-rate, such that this effect alone cannot explain the observed low on-rate. Rather, by quantifying the translational and rotational degrees of freedom and by calculating the binding committor, our simulations confirmed the existence of a binding funnel as the main bottleneck. Direct binding via the binding funnel dominates the binding kinetics, and only ∼ 10 % of all ligands proceed via the surface into the binding site. The simulations further predict an on-rate between 15 and Math Eq, which agrees with the measured on-rate...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: Integrating {{different}} {{visual features}} {{into a coherent}} object is an essential issue for the visual system which is referred as the binding problem. Previous {{studies have shown that}} early visual cortex plays a very important role in the active binding of color and motion (Zhang et al., 2014; 2016). However, our knowledge {{of the relationship between the}} binding problem and the neural oscillations is still incomplete. 	METHODS: We explored the role of neural oscillations in active color-motion binding with an illusory misbinding of color and motion (Wu et al., 2004). We probed the neural oscillations of the color-motion misbinding using electroencephalogram (EEG), and transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS). Specifically, we presented a color-motion misbinding stimulus to subjects and recorded EEG signals while they reported whether they perceived the misbinding or the correct <b>binding</b> <b>state.</b> 	RESULTS: Results showed that alpha oscillatory activity in left occipital area increased when subjects reported the correct <b>binding</b> <b>state,</b> relative to the misbinding state. Moreover, we used tACS over left posterior area to enhance individual alpha activity and found an increase in the duration of the correct <b>binding</b> <b>state.</b> Furthermore, we also manipulated alpha frequency to investigate the behavioral changes at different frequencies. We found that delivering a higher frequency than individual alpha frequency that we got from EEG signal would increase the switching rate between the misbinding and the correct <b>binding</b> <b>state</b> and vice versa. 	CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that alpha activity can determine the color-motion binding and individual alpha activity causally shaped the perceptual states of the color-motion binding. Our results provide new insight for the neural mechanisms of active color-motion binding in human visual cortex. </p...|$|E

The apparatus designed for this purpose transforms a standard Auger electron spectrometer into a detector measuring the rate of these surface reactions. We have used this technique to study the thermal desorption of cesium from (110) gallium arsenide. Several <b>binding</b> <b>states</b> are found...|$|R
40|$|Ramped field {{desorption}} {{has been}} employed {{to probe the}} <b>binding</b> <b>states</b> of adsorbed species. The use of fast linear ramps with slopes of 107 ·V/m ns allows us to combine this method with time-of-flight mass spectrometry. First results are presented for the desorption of NO adsorbed at step sites of Pt field emitter tips. We describe the general formalism for calculating the field desorption rates. The application to the system NO/Pt yields considerable agreement between theory and experiment...|$|R
