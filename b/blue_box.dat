After an earthquake and witnessing a nearby mountain begin to smoulder, he realises he has in fact materialised in Pompeii one day before the eruption of Mount Vesuvius. When he and Donna return to where the TARDIS landed, he discovers that a local merchant sold it to sculptor Lobus Caecilius. The Doctor and Donna go to Caecilius's house to retrieve it.

25|$|Application {{services}} are offered through a single program known officially as the Cooperative Macintosh Toolbox environment, but are universally {{referred to as}} the <b>Blue</b> <b>Box.</b> The <b>Blue</b> <b>Box</b> encapsulates an existing System 7 operating system inside a single process and address space. Mac programs run inside the <b>Blue</b> <b>Box</b> much as they do under System 7, as cooperative tasks that use the non-reentrant Toolbox calls. A worst-case scenario is that an application in the <b>Blue</b> <b>Box</b> crashes, taking down the entire <b>Blue</b> <b>Box</b> instance with it. This does not result in the system as a whole going down, however, and the <b>Blue</b> <b>Box</b> can be restarted.|$|E

25|$|Model Dockyard was {{the first}} to release a brass, ready-to-run model of the {{locomotive}} in 1967. The units were generic, unpainted models and significantly pre-dated the modern preservation era, so none of the more modern features are represented. The engines were packaged in a <b>blue</b> <b>box</b> with foam interiors, and were fitted with Triang-style motor and gearbox which projected into the locomotive cab, and retailed for $78AUD. The units were manufactured by Kumata in Japan. A re-run was produced in Korea in 1982, using a newer, smaller can motor design which allowed for in-cab detailing.|$|E

Copland runs what was essentially a complete copy of System 7.5 (in the <b>Blue</b> <b>Box)</b> in addition to an entirely separate operating system running under it.
