40|$|This paper {{describes}} work {{carried out}} at University College London to integrate public narrow-band ISDN services into the Internet world. The aim {{of the work is}} to provide a gateway that allows access to global Internet resources for users with <b>Basic</b> <b>Rate</b> ISDN <b>access.</b> The gateway not only supports traditional data applications but also newer multi-media, multicast applications such as VAT and WB.

Since the Sun is on the Internet, this has given us the chance to investigate the integration of the ISDN and Internet worlds. The first phase of these experiments has concentrated on a "data-communications oriented" approach - i. e. we have tried to extend the datacommunications world of our LANs transparently across the ISDN. In this phase we have concentrated on [...] ...|$|R

50|$|There are two ISDN implementations. Basic Rate Interface (BRI), {{also called}} <b>basic</b> <b>rate</b> <b>access</b> (BRA) — {{consists}} of two B channels, each with bandwidth of 64 kbit/s, and one D channel with a bandwidth of 16 kbit/s. Together these three channels can be designated as 2B+D. Primary Rate Interface (PRI), also called primary rate access (PRA) in Europe — contains {{a greater number of}} B channels and a D channel with a bandwidth of 64 kbit/s. The number of B channels for PRI varies according to the nation: in North America and Japan it is 23B+1D, with an aggregate bit rate of 1.544 Mbit/s (T1); in Europe, India and Australia it is 30B+2D, with an aggregate bit rate of 2.048 Mbit/s (E1). Broadband Integrated Services Digital Network (BISDN) is another ISDN implementation and it is able to manage different types of services at the same time. It is primarily used within network backbones and employs ATM.|$|E
40|$|This {{contribution}} {{proposes a}} PSD template for the very-low-band (VLB) symmetric spectrum management class. The template, {{based on the}} provisionally agreed template (T 1 E 1. 4 / 99 - 099), has been modified to better accommodate more "squared off" PSDs, like those of CAP and QAM, while tightening up other portions of the template to improve ADSL margins. This template incorporates most existing T 1. 601 transmitters, baseband "HDSL-type" transmission at rates from 80 to 144 kbaud, and CAP/QAM transmission at rates from 40 to 72 kbaud. Applications/services supported by these technologies include ISDN <b>Basic</b> <b>Rate</b> <b>Access,</b> IDSL, SDSL, and UDC. The achievable data rates for T 1. 413 /G. 992. 1 and G. 992. 2 ADSL with 24 -disturber NEXT from systems that transmit with the proposed PSD template is compared to that obtained when using the PSD template provisionally agreed from T 1 E 1. 4 / 99 - 099.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} how {{an electric}} transmission {{company in a}} pass-through area should settle {{the cost of a}} pass-through with the neighboring transmission companies under the point-of-connection tariff system. First, the paper shows that if the cost of the pass-through is settled based on the principle that determines the (metered) power transmission fares for ordinary customers (i. e. injectors and withdrawers) of the transmission companies, the fare receipts of the pass-through transmission company can be made to match its power transmission losses. The paper also demonstrates that this method minimizes power transmission losses from a nationwide perspective. In addition, the paper shows that incentives will be given to construction of the transmission line in the pass-through area if the transmission company in the pass-through area charges its neighboring transmission companies the same <b>basic</b> <b>rates</b> (as opposed to the metered transmission fare) that ordinary injectors and withdrawers face. This structure of a <b>basic</b> <b>rate</b> sets higher injection rates and lower withdrawal rates in upstream areas than in downstream areas. The revenue from this <b>basic</b> <b>rates</b> structure can bear the burden of construction costs of transmission lines in the pass-through areas. Incidentally, this finding justifies the structure of <b>basic</b> <b>rates</b> practiced in Nordic countries. ...|$|R
50|$|Margaret Thatcher, who favoured {{indirect}} taxation, reduced {{personal income}} tax rates during the 1980s. In the first budget after her election victory in 1979, the top rate was reduced from 83% to 60% and the <b>basic</b> <b>rate</b> from 33% to 30%. The <b>basic</b> <b>rate</b> was also cut for three successive budgets - to 29% in the 1986 budget, 27% in 1987 and to 25% in 1988. The top rate of income tax was cut to 40% in the 1988 budget. The investment income surcharge was abolished in 1985.|$|R
50|$|Gift Aid allows {{individuals}} who are subject to UK income tax to complete a simple, short declaration {{that they are a}} UK taxpayer. Any cash donations that the taxpayer makes to the charity after making a declaration are treated as being made after deduction of income tax at the <b>basic</b> <b>rate</b> (20% in 2011), and the charity can reclaim the <b>basic</b> <b>rate</b> income tax paid on the gift from HMRC. For a basic-rate taxpayer, this adds approximately 25% to the value of any gift made under Gift Aid. Higher-rate taxpayers can claim income tax relief, above and beyond the amount claimed directly by the charities. The rate of the relief for higher-rate taxpayers in 2011 is usually 20%, the difference between the <b>basic</b> <b>rate</b> (20%) and the higher rate (40%) of income tax, although recipients of dividend income (taxed at 10% and 32.5%) can achieve a higher rate of tax relief (22.5%).|$|R
