40|$|Human spinal dura and arachnoid, {{obtained}} during neurosurgical operations, {{were studied}} by transmission electron microscopy. The ultrastructure of spinal meninges largely conformed to the morphology of the cranial meninges, but some minor differences were detected. The dura {{was composed of}} an outermost loosely arranged fibroelastic layer, a middle basically fibrous portion and an innermost cellular <b>layer</b> (dural border <b>cell</b> <b>layer).</b> The dural border <b>cell</b> <b>layer</b> was characterised by multiple interdigitating cell processes, no extracellular collagen, significant extracellular spaces and few cell junctions. Paravascular vesiculated nerve profiles were encountered within the fibroadipose epidural tissue. The arachnoid was composed of an outermost portion (arachnoid <b>barrier</b> <b>cell</b> <b>layer),</b> presenting tightly packed cells, numerous tight junctions and no extracellular collagen. In view of its numerous tight junctions, the arachnoid <b>barrier</b> <b>cell</b> <b>layer</b> is considered to represent an effective morphological and physiological meningeal barrier between the cerebrospinal fluid in the subarachnoid space and the blood circulation in the dura. The arachnoid <b>barrier</b> <b>layer</b> was always characterised by a distinct continuous basal lamina on its inner surface towards the innermost collagenous portion of the arachnoid (arachnoid reticular <b>cell</b> <b>layer).</b> The interweaving arachnoid trabecular <b>cells</b> within this <b>layer</b> possessed numerous mitochondria and were anchored to the inner surface of the arachnoid <b>barrier</b> <b>cell</b> <b>layer</b> by desmosomes.

40|$|Nickel <b>barrier</b> <b>layers</b> are commonly-used in {{metallisation}} of silicon-based microelectronic and {{photovoltaic devices}} to prevent copper diffusion from metal contacts {{to the underlying}} silicon. This thesis compares the effectiveness of nickel <b>barrier</b> <b>layers,</b> formed using: (i) electroless plating; and (ii) light-induced plating (LIP), in preventing copper diffusion into mono-crystalline silicon laser-doped selective emitter (LDSE) solar cells. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy was {{used in conjunction with}} transmission electron microscopy for chemical identification of copper-rich regions in silicon under the nickel/copper metal contacts of heat-treated cells. It was observed that copper can penetrate through both electroless-plated and LIP Ni <b>barrier</b> <b>layers</b> in LDSE <b>cells</b> that have been heated for 5 hours at 200 °C or 400 °C, followed by quenching in ethylene glycol (fast cooling). Current-voltage measurements were used to characterise the electrical performance of LDSE cells with different nickel <b>barrier</b> <b>layers.</b> Significant degradations in cell efficiency, fill factor and open-circuit voltage were observed for LDSE cells with electroless-plated nickel <b>barrier</b> <b>layers</b> after heating at 200 °C and subsequent quenching in ethylene glycol. In the worst case, the fill factor was reduced from 66 % to 31 %, causing severe efficiency degradation. However, the fill factor of cells with LIP nickel <b>barrier</b> <b>layers</b> were only reduced from 66 % to 58 % under the same conditions. When cells were cooled slowly the electrical performance of the cells was only slightly affected and was independent of the type of nickel <b>barrier</b> <b>layer.</b> Furthermore, LDSE <b>cells</b> with electroless-plated nickel <b>barrier</b> <b>layers</b> that were originally heat-treated followed by fast cooling, were exposed to a second heat treatment at 250 °C for 2 hours, followed by slow cooling. This resulted in a significant improvement in the lifetime. These results suggest that copper may diffuse through both electroless plated and LIP nickel <b>barrier</b> <b>layers</b> at temperatures as low as 200 °C. However, on slow cooling (which is likely in the field), the copper can out-diffuse to regions of the cell where the cell&# 146;s electrical performance is not degraded. These observations suggest that some commonly-accepted views on the ability of nickel <b>barrier</b> <b>layers</b> to prevent copper diffusion in silicon solar cells may need to be challenged and further investigated...|$|R
40|$|A {{method was}} {{developed}} revealing even slight variations of structural features around the <b>barrier</b> <b>layer</b> of porous anodic alumina films formed in H 2 SO 4 electrolyte at conditions {{different from those}} of best ordering. This is based on the combination of a suitable structural-kinetic model with the average size of imprints of <b>barrier</b> <b>layer</b> units on the Al surface determined by FESEM. The galvanostatic growth of films in steady state is accompanied by rise of anodic potential with time depending on temperature. Simultaneously structural features around the <b>barrier</b> <b>layer</b> like <b>cell</b> width, pore base diameter and <b>barrier</b> <b>layer</b> thickness increase with time and anodic potential. The ratios of their values remain constant in time but depend on temperature. A proportionality rule thus applies explained by demand for constant Al 3 + and O 2 - transport numbers in steady state. The enlargement of the above structural features occurs simultaneously with termination of some pores due to their narrowing resulting from drop of ionic conductance in pores and/or <b>barrier</b> <b>layer.</b> The surface density of cells/pores across the film increases to film surface. where it becomes highest, established around the start of second transient stage. The porosity near <b>barrier</b> <b>layer</b> remains constant with time but increases with temperature. The anodising ratio and average field strength across the <b>barrier</b> <b>layer</b> generally slightly increases and decreases respectively with time while the relevant trends are affected by temperature. FESEM examination of film surfaces showed structure affected by metallurgical texture, altered however to deeper layers, and surface structure changes due to chemical attack of oxide by the electrolyte.

40|$|Purpose Spinal {{surgery in}} a {{previously}} irradiated field carries {{increased risk of}} perioperative complications, such as delayed wound healing or wound infection. In addition, adhesion around the dura mater is often observed clinically. Therefore, similar to radiation-induced fibrosis- a major late-stage radiation injury in other tissue-epidural fibrosis is anticipated to occur after spinal radiation. In this study, we performed histopathologic assessment of postirradiation changes in the spinal dura mater and peridural tissue in mice. Materials and Methods The thoracolumbar transition of ddY mice was irradiated with a single dose of 10 or 20 Gy. After resection of the irradiated spine, occurrence of epidural fibrosis and expression of transforming growth factor beta 1 in the spinal dura mater were evaluated. In addition, microstructures in the spinal dura mater and peridural tissue were assessed using an electron microscope. Results In the 20 -Gy irradiated mice, epidural fibrosis first occurred around 12 weeks postirradiation, and was observed in all cases from 16 weeks postirradiation. In contrast, epidural fibrosis was not observed in the nonirradiated mice. Compared with the nonirradiated mice, the 10 - and 20 -Gy irradiated mice had significantly more overexpression of transforming growth factor beta 1 at 1 week postirradiation and in the late stages after irradiation. In microstructural assessment, the arachnoid <b>barrier</b> <b>cell</b> <b>layer</b> was thinned at 12 and 24 weeks postirradiation compared with that in the nonirradiated mice.

40|$|Abstract. The {{concept of}} the {{diffusion}} barrier coating system (DBC system) is summarized and the latest results are presented. The DBC system is comprised of alloy substrate/diffusion barrier/Al-reservoir/an external scale. Diffusion flux (JAl) of Al through the <b>barrier</b> <b>layer</b> will be given approximately by JAl = DAl x SAl x (CAl/x), where DAl and SAl are the diffusion coefficient and solubility limit of Al in the <b>barrier</b> <b>layer,</b> respectively as well as CAl / x is driving force given by the concentration difference across the barrier (CAl) divided by {{the thickness of the}} <b>barrier</b> <b>layer</b> (x). A slow diffusion flux can be obtained by using low values of DAl, SAl, or (CAl / x). Accordingly, a selection of a <b>barrier</b> <b>layer</b> with lower DAl and SAl is essential. A low driving force is also an important factor, and can be achieved by using lower CAl with a constant <b>barrier</b> <b>layer</b> thickness x. At higher temperatures, however, the <b>barrier</b> <b>layer</b> can react with the alloy substrate and Al-reservoir layer, resulting in gradual degradation of the <b>barrier</b> <b>layer.</b> This means that the thickness x of the <b>barrier</b> <b>layer</b> tends to decrease and may finally disappear. With decreasing thickness of the diffusion <b>barrier</b> <b>layer,</b> the driving force (CAl/x) will increase, and the effectiveness of the <b>barrier</b> <b>layer</b> will be eliminated. Therefore, it is essential to maintain a constant thickness of the <b>barrier</b> <b>layer</b> for long exposure time.

30|$|It can be {{seen from}} Fig. 1 that there is a length {{distribution}} for the nanotubes and nanowires in each sample.

Ni 2 + ions are reduced during the electrodeposition by the electrons tunneled through the <b>barrier</b> <b>layer.</b> However, the <b>barrier</b> <b>layer</b> at each pore could be branched differently during the thinning process of the <b>barrier</b> <b>layer,</b> resulting in different energy barriers for tunneling because of different <b>barrier</b> <b>layer</b> thickness [23].

40|$|We {{present a}} {{revisited}} 2 -degree resolution global ocean climatology of monthly mean <b>Barrier</b> <b>Layer</b> Thickness (BLT) first proposed by de Boyer Montégut et al. (2007 a). In addition to using an extended data set, {{we present a}} modified computation method {{in order to take}} into account the observed permeability of <b>Barrier</b> <b>Layers</b> (BL). We name permeability the fact that <b>barrier</b> <b>layers</b> can, in some areas, be very patchy regarding the space and time scales that are considered. This patchiness may have important consequences for the climatic impact of BLs. Differences between the two computation methods are weak for robust BLs that are formed by large-scale processes. The former approach can however largely underestimate the thickness of short and/or localized <b>barrier</b> <b>layers.</b> This is especially the case for the ones formed by mesoscale mechanisms (under the ITCZ for example and along western boundary currents) and patchy <b>barrier</b> <b>layers</b> detected equatorward of the sea surface salinity subtropical maxima. Complete characterisation of regional BL dynamics therefore requires the description of BL robustness through the determination of both BLT and BL permeability...|$|R
40|$|Thin-film PV modules {{grown on}} flexible, light weight, {{thermally}} stable and low cost substrates such as stainless steel foil, are an attractive product for solar market applications. When metal foils {{are used as}} substrate, {{it is essential to}} deposit a dielectric <b>barrier</b> <b>layer</b> to isolate electrically and chemically the thin-film solar cells front the substrate. In this work, SiOx stacks deposited on ‘rough’ stainless steel by a combination of a new sol-gel formulation and a Plasma Enhanced Chemical Vapor Deposition (PECVD) deposition step are reported as a suitable dielectric <b>barrier</b> <b>layer</b> candidate. Using these SiOx multilayers, a smooth and homogeneous film was achieved. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis showed that back contact of the solar cell (based on Molybdenum) is not affected by the presence of the <b>barrier</b> <b>layer.</b> Moreover, according to X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (SIMS) measurements, this approach led to excellent <b>barrier</b> <b>layer</b> properties against the diffusion of impurities from the stainless steel. A complete electrical characterization of these dielectric <b>barrier</b> <b>layers</b> was also carried out showing good electrical insulation. Peer Reviewe...|$|R

Epitaxial oxide junctions of highly spin polarized La 0. 7 Sr 0. 3 MnO 3 and Fe 3 O 4 electrodes with magnetic NiMn 2 O 4 (NMO) insulating <b>barrier</b> <b>layers</b> provide a magnetic tunnel junction system in which we can probe the effect of the barrier by comparing junction behavior above and below the Curie temperature of the <b>barrier</b> <b>layer.</b> When the <b>barrier</b> is paramagnetic, the spin polarized transport is dominated by interface scattering and surface spin waves; however, when the barrier is ferrimagnetic, spin flip scattering due to spin waves within the NMO barrier dominates the transport.

40|$|Synopsis [...] Mechanical {{features}} of and damages {{to the outer}} skin, such as pliability, stretch~ ability, stickiness while wet, and chapping seem to depend, at least partly, on the water con-tent on the stratum corneum, or, rather, the <b>barrier</b> <b>layers.</b> Statements {{on the behavior of}} callus cannot be immediately related to those referring to the <b>barrier</b> <b>layers.</b> The water content of the barriers depends on the local relative humidity. There seem to be at least two barriers. Their variable water vapor diffusion resistances, the external milieu and the active transfer processes below the barrier control the relative humidity of the <b>barrier</b> <b>layers.</b> 1...|$|R
30|$|The drastic {{thickening}} of the <b>barrier</b> <b>layer</b> in {{the marginal}} sea off the western coast of Sumatra during {{the passage of}} the Madden-Julian oscillation (MJO) observed during December 2015 is investigated. Before the MJO arrival, the halocline above a depth of 20  m was very strong, and the <b>barrier</b> <b>layer</b> thickness was 5 – 10  m based on R/V Mirai observations. During the MJO forcing of 13 – 16 December, the isothermal layer drastically deepened from 20 to 100  m. Meanwhile, the mixed layer deepening lagged behind the isothermal layer deepening by 1  day, and the <b>barrier</b> <b>layer</b> underwent dramatic thickening to 60  m within 24  h. An evaluation of the vertical salinity gradient tendency showed that the dramatic thickening of the <b>barrier</b> <b>layer</b> was due to the vertical oceanic mixing by the atmospheric MJO forcing and the vertical stretching by the oceanic downwelling coastal Kelvin wave intruding from the open ocean. In addition, an evaluation of the vertical temperature gradient tendency showed that the temperature inversion in the <b>barrier</b> <b>layer</b> formed by losing heat to the atmosphere due to the MJO forcing and downward advection of the temperature gradient due to the downwelling Kelvin wave resulting in the dramatic isothermal layer deepening. One of the important factors in the drastic <b>barrier</b> <b>layer</b> thickening was the atmospheric external forcing and the oceanic internal wave being in phase. The downwelling oceanic Kelvin wave continuously lowered the thermocline from the middle of November to the end of December, and the salinity stratification {{in the vicinity of the}} thermocline was continuously mitigated by the vertical stretching. Under such conditions, the MJO forcing caused vertical mixing of the freshwater with strong salinity stratification and temperature stratification near the surface. The combination of the two distinct processes caused the drastic thickening of the <b>barrier</b> <b>layer,</b> and the <b>barrier</b> <b>layer</b> thickness reached a maximum of 85  m 5  days after the MJO arrival.|$|R
