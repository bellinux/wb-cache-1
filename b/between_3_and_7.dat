5|$|Plutonium also {{exhibits}} valence states <b>between</b> <b>3</b> <b>and</b> <b>7</b> inclusive, {{and thus}} is chemically similar to neptunium and uranium. It is highly reactive, and quickly forms an oxide film in air. Plutonium reacts with hydrogen even at temperatures as low as 25–50°C; it also easily forms halides and intermetallic compounds. Hydrolysis reactions of plutonium ions of different oxidation states are quite diverse. Plutonium(V) can enter polymerization reactions.|$|E

Soult left Granada and reached the Gor ravine on 9 August with 6,000 {{infantry}} and 1,500 cavalry. The position {{was so strong that}} Soult made no attempt to attack, but instead mounted occasional bombardments of the Spanish lines. Earlier, Soult had ordered Godinot to advance from Jaén against La Cuadra's position at Pozo Alcón. Godinot left Baeza on the 7th with at least 4,000 foot soldiers and 600 horsemen. In the face of this advance, La Cuadra abandoned Pozo Alcón on 8 August and fell back to the east in the direction of Huéscar. When he heard that Godinot was coming down from the northwest, Freire sent O'Donnell's 4,000 men to occupy a blocking position at Zújar and ordered La Cuadra to join him there.|$|E
500|$|Scientifically, sugar loosely {{refers to}} a number of carbohydrates, such as monosaccharides, disaccharides, or oligosaccharides. Monosaccharides are also called [...] "simple sugars," [...] the most {{important}} being glucose. Most monosaccharides have a formula that conforms to [...] with n <b>between</b> <b>3</b> <b>and</b> <b>7</b> (deoxyribose being an exception). Glucose has the molecular formula [...] The names of typical sugars end with -ose, as in [...] "glucose" [...] and [...] "fructose". Sometimes such words may also refer to any types of carbohydrates soluble in water. The acyclic mono- and disaccharides contain either aldehyde groups or ketone groups. These carbon-oxygen double bonds (C=O) are the reactive centers. All saccharides with more than one ring in their structure result from two or more monosaccharides joined by glycosidic bonds with the resultant loss of a molecule of water (...) per bond.|$|E

30|$|For the {{cationic}} cysteamine-AuNP, the ZP {{charge was}} positive <b>between</b> pH  <b>3</b> <b>and</b> <b>7</b> but dramatically changed to negative at pH  9. This implies that <b>between</b> pH  <b>3</b> <b>and</b> <b>7,</b> the cysteamine ligand maintained its functionality as {{evidence from the}} strongly positive ZP charge which also indicated high colloidal stability. The transformation of the ZP charge from positive to negative at pH  9 indicates loss of chemical stability of the NP which may arise due to deprotonation of the thiol functional moiety or removal of the cysteamine functional group from the surface. We hereby recommend that the cationic AuNPs should be utilized <b>between</b> pH  <b>3</b> <b>and</b> <b>7.</b>|$|R

500|$|The Sega Pico, {{also known}} as , is an {{educational}} video game console by Sega. Marketed as [...] "edutainment", {{the main focus of}} the Pico was educational video games for children <b>between</b> <b>3</b> <b>and</b> <b>7</b> years old. The Pico was released in June 1993 in Japan and November 1994 in North America and Europe, later reaching China. It was succeeded by the Advanced Pico Beena, which was released in Japan in 2005. Though the Pico was sold continuously in Japan through the release of the Beena, in North America and Europe the Pico was less successful and was discontinued in early 1998, later being rereleased by Majesco Entertainment. Releases for the Pico were focused on education for children and included titles supported by licensed franchised animated characters, including Disney and Sega's own Sonic the Hedgehog series. Overall, Sega claims sales of 3.4 million Pico consoles and 11.2 million game cartridges, and over 350,000 Beena consoles and 800,000 cartridges.|$|E
