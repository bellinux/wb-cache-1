This may be publicized to improve a firm’s image.

Only one edition altered Milton's views: a version possibly edited by James Tyrell, a historian, was changed during a controversy over the succession of William III. The work was retitled Pro Populo Adversus Tyrannos: Or the Sovereign Right and Power of the People over Tyrants. This work continued to <b>be</b> <b>advertised,</b> in 1691, as being Milton's work.|$|E

25|$|An {{annotated}} edition of Mein Kampf {{was published in}} Germany in January 2016 and sold out within hours on Amazon's German site. The book's publication led to public debate in Germany, and divided reactions from Jewish groups, with some supporting, and others opposing, the decision to publish. German officials had previously said they would limit public access to the text amid fears that its republication could stir neo-Nazi sentiment. Some bookstores stated {{that they would not}} stock the book. Dussmann, a Berlin bookstore, stated that one copy was available on the shelves in the history section, but that it would not <b>be</b> <b>advertised</b> and more copies would be available only on order.

To promote the film, Siegmund Lubin placed an advertisement in Billboard; appearing in its October 15, 1904 issue, {{it was the first}} film to <b>be</b> <b>advertised</b> in the magazine. The advertisement offered the film for purchase at the price of 66 dollars, along with a free Victor Talking Machine if one were to purchase two other films. An advertisement for the film in the New York Clipper declared that The Bold Bank Robbery was [...] "the most sensational film ever made." ...|$|E
500|$|Jim Henson, {{the creator}} of the Muppets, owned the {{trademarks}} to those characters, and was reluctant to market them at first. He agreed when the CTW promised that the profits from toys, books, computer games, and other products were to be used exclusively to fund the CTW and its outreach efforts. Even though Cooney and the CTW had very little experience with marketing, they demanded complete control over all products and product decisions. Any product line associated with the show had to be educational and inexpensive, and could not <b>be</b> <b>advertised</b> during the show's airings. As Davis reported, [...] "Cooney stressed restraint, prudence, and caution" [...] in their marketing and licensing efforts.|$|E
500|$|The single reel drama, {{approximately}} 1,000 feet long, {{was released}} on January 13, 1911. This would be billed as the second in the series following the successful Love And Law film. The two later releases would be The Norwood Necklace and The Court's Decree would conclude the [...] "Violet Gray, Detective" [...] series. Apparently the film series made an impact because the Lubin Manufacturing Company released a film under the title Violet Dare, Detective in June 1913. The film received a positive review from The Billboard for its interest plot, good acting and photography. The New York Dramatic Mirror found the film {{to be a good}} melodrama, but found fault in that a woman detective was used to resolve the case when the part would have had more dignity and realism if the case was resolved by a man. The film would be shown in Pennsylvania and <b>be</b> <b>advertised</b> by theaters even a year after its release.|$|E

500|$|During the pre-writing {{planning}} phase, Iwakami simply {{requested that}} Urobuchi make the storyline [...] "heavy". Furthermore, Shinbo specified {{that it should}} contain copious amounts of blood and violence, elements that were unusual to the magical girl genre. The director also specifically sought {{for many of the}} magical girl characters to be killed throughout the series. Urobuchi admitted he had no trouble with these requirements, referencing his past reputation as a writer of very dark and somber stories, the extent of which Shinbo had not fully known. One objective was for the script to starkly contrast with the way the anime was to be marketed. Shinbo planned for the series to <b>be</b> <b>advertised</b> in an innocent and pure manner that would deliberately conceal its dark undertones. For example, the title logo for the anime was rendered using rounded fonts that would appear more harmless to audiences. Urobuchi further misled fans following the development of the anime by using his Twitter account to try to convince them that the plot of the series was very innocuous. The true nature of the series was disguised because Shinbo strongly desired for its dark themes to come as a complete surprise to the viewer. Iwakami later defended the mature themes in the Puella Magi Madoka Magica, stating [...] "the story of Madoka is serious but it's not entirely inappropriate for children. For example, there's nothing sexually explicit in it. There's some death, but it's not gratuitous; it can be explained {{within the context of the}} story." ...|$|E
500|$|In the {{standard}} Golden Age model, the industry's top product, the A films, premiered {{at a small}} number of select first-run houses in major cities. Double features were not the rule at these prestigious venues. As described by historian Edward Jay Epstein, [...] "During these first runs, films got their reviews, garnered publicity, and generated the word of mouth that served as the principal form of advertising." [...] Then it was off to the subsequent-run market where the double feature prevailed. At the larger local venues controlled by the majors, movies might turn over on a weekly basis. At the thousands of smaller, independent theaters, programs often changed {{two or three times a}} week. To meet the constant demand for new B product, the low end of Poverty Row turned out a stream of micro-budget movies rarely much more than sixty minutes long; these were known as [...] "quickies" [...] for their tight production schedules—as short as four days. As Brian Taves describes, [...] "Many of the poorest theaters, such as the 'grind houses' in the larger cities, screened a continuous program emphasizing action with no specific schedule, sometimes offering six quickies for a nickel in an all-night show that changed daily." [...] Many small theaters never saw a big-studio A film, getting their movies from the states rights concerns that handled almost exclusively Poverty Row product. Millions of Americans went to their local theaters as a matter of course: for an A picture, along with the trailers, or screen previews, that presaged its arrival, [...] "he new film's title on the marquee and the listings for it in the local newspaper constituted all the advertising most movies got", writes Epstein. Aside from at the theater itself, B films might not <b>be</b> <b>advertised</b> at all.|$|E
