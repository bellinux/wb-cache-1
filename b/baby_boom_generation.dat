40|$|With 'guarantee {{pensions}}', {{we refer}} to minimum pensions that serve the purpose of providing a minimum subsistence security for pensioners. In Finland, this role is played by the national pension, which is offset by any earnings-related pensions paid to its recipient. In the context of minimum pensions, various simulation models have proved useful tools for the forecasting of pensioner populations, of incomes and expenditures, and of the financial balance. An ag-gregate deterministic simulation model has been developed to assist in national pension projections. In many countries, the large post-war <b>baby</b> <b>boom</b> <b>generations</b> are about to reach old-age retirement age. In Finland, this trend will be particularly pronounced in 2010 - 2030. The retirement of the <b>baby</b> <b>boom</b> <b>generations</b> together with low fer-tility rates will increase the financial burden of retirement provision. Retirement projections suggest {{that the number of}} pension beneficiaries in Finland will in-crease by a factor of at least 1. 4. The cost of earnings-related retirement provi-sion is increasing as well. The cost of the Finnish national pension scheme, on the other hand, will not increase in real terms unless pension levels are raised by specific decision. Any pension calculations will be sensitive to the underlying assumptions about economic performance on which they are based.

25|$|There is {{one final}} matter to consider: the {{possibility}} that euthanasia not only would be performed on incompetent patients {{in violation of the}} rules—as an abuse of the safeguards—but would become the rule in the context of demographic and budgetary pressures on Social Security and Medicare as the <b>Baby</b> <b>Boom</b> <b>generation</b> begins to retire, around 2010. Once legalized, physician-assisted suicide and euthanasia would become routine. Over time doctors would become comfortable giving injections to end life and Americans would become comfortable having euthanasia as an option. Comfort would make us want to extend the option to others who, in society's view, are suffering and leading purposeless lives.

After the U.S.’s involvements with World War II in 1945, the economy was ready to turn its attention to the returning troops. “To integrate millions of young veterans into the American economy, the 78th Congress passed the GI Bill of Rights on June 22, 1944.” (U-S-History.com) The GI Bill provided veterans low-interest rates {{and they were able}} to purchase homes and seek higher education, which sparked a movement into the <b>Baby</b> <b>Boom</b> <b>generation</b> as well as a move into the suburbs.

40|$|The last 150 {{years have}} been a period of unusual {{demographic}} change. <b>Baby</b> <b>booms</b> occurred {{in the aftermath of}} wars in some countries. In others, <b>baby</b> <b>booms</b> occurred as a result of falling infant mortality rates and subsequent reductions in fertility. <b>Baby</b> <b>boom</b> <b>generations</b> produce an echo, {{in the form of a}} large cohort of children a generation later, creating long-term demographic disequilibria. These destabilized age structures, together with improvements in health and longevity among the elderly, are producing, for the first time in history, populations with large and growing rates of old age dependency. We argue that transitions from high mortality and fertility to low mortality and fertility can be beneficial to economies as the large <b>baby</b> <b>boom</b> cohorts enter the workforce and save for retirement, while rising longevity has perhaps increased both the incentive to invest in education and to save for retirement.

25|$|The {{first phase}} of postmodernity {{overlaps}} the end of modernity and is regarded by many as {{being part of the}} modern period (see lumpers/splitters, periodization). Television became the primary news source, manufacturing decreased in importance in the economies of Western Europe and the United States but trade volumes increased within the developed core. In 1967–1969 a crucial cultural explosion took place within the developed world as the <b>baby</b> <b>boom</b> <b>generation,</b> which had grown up with postmodernity as its fundamental experience of society, demanded entrance into the political, cultural and educational power structure. A series of demonstrations and acts of rebellion – ranging from nonviolent and cultural, through violent acts of terrorism – represented the opposition of the young to the policies and perspectives of the previous age. Opposition to the Algerian War and the Vietnam War, to laws allowing or encouraging racial segregation and to laws which overtly discriminated against women and restricted access to divorce, increased use of marijuana and psychedelics, the emergence of pop cultural styles of music and drama, including rock music and the ubiquity of stereo, television and radio helped make these changes visible in the broader cultural context. This period is associated with the work of Marshall McLuhan, a philosopher who focused on the results of living in a media culture and argued that participation in a mass media culture both overshadows actual content disseminated and is liberating because it loosens the authority of local social normative standards.|$|E

Our pension and disability insurance fund has a problem managing unfavorable socioeconomic trends and demographic reality, considering that the number of employees is steadily declining. Employee to retiree ratio has been affected by serious changes during the last half a century, and it declined from 5 : 1 in 1960 s to 1, 4 : 1 nowadays. This is a result of population ageing (life expectancy rising and dropping of total fertility rate) and unrestrictive law that allowed pensions to those who didn't deserve it (the share of disability retirees is significantly higher than that in other countries). An additional issue is the fact that <b>baby</b> <b>boom</b> <b>generations</b> are a few years away from the legal age acquired for the age pension.

Under current program structures, population aging would be virtually certain to increase the costliness of Federal programs as a share of GDP by 35 percent (± 2 percent) by the 2030 s, and by 60 percent (± 15 percent) in the second half of the century.

The model is fit to data on life cycle employment, schooling and occupation decisions, and on life cycle labor earnings, {{within and between}} cohorts observed in the US between 1968 and 1993. ^ Based on the estimates of the model, the impact of cohort size on skill prices and, consequently, on career decisions is assessed. Compared to a baseline case in which cohort size increased at a steady (average) rate and the fertility process was stationary, {{it is found that}} the male baby bust generations born in the 1930 s and 1940 s faced higher skill prices (by as much as 2. 0 %), completed college at a higher rate (by as much as 0. 3 percentage points) and worked more over the lifetime (by as much as 0. 1 years). In contrast, the males from the <b>baby</b> <b>boom</b> <b>generations</b> born in the 1950 s and 1960 s faced lower skill prices (by as much as 1. 5 %), completed college at a lower rate (by as much as 1. 0 percentage points) and worked less over the lifetime (by as much as 0. 1 years). The impact of cohort size is found to differ across gender due to the differential impact of fertility on the value of home production: unlike males, the female baby bust generations completed college at a lower rate (by as much as 1. 5 percentage points) and worked less over the lifetime (by as much as 0. 5 years) while the female <b>baby</b> <b>boom</b> <b>generations</b> completed college at a lower rate (by as much as 1. 5 percentage points) and worked more over the lifetime (by as much as 0. 2 years). ^ A tuition subsidy experiment is also performed both in a general equilibrium setting in which skill prices are endogenous and in a partial equilibrium setting with fixed skill prices. Based on the estimated model, a 1 % increase in tuition is predicted to reduce college enrollment rates by 1. 27 % in partial equilibrium, consistent with previous estimates, and by 1. 05 % in the general equilibrium case. Thus, for this policy experiment, the partial equilibrium analysis of schooling choice would not differ significantly from the general equilibrium analysis. ...|$|R
