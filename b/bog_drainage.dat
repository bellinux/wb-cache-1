50|$|The {{marshland}} itself, forming {{part of the}} Elbe Marshes, {{is divided}} in turn into the fertile sea marsh, the so-called Hochland ("highland", ca. 1-2 m above NN; comprising much of today's collective municipality of Hadeln), and the Sietland {{on the edge of}} the <b>bogs.</b> <b>Drainage</b> is difficult and is handled mainly by the pumping station (Schöpfwerk Otterndorf) in Otterndorf as well as by the small lock near Altenbruch. At Otterndorf the waters of the Medem and its many tributaries, and the water of the Hadeln Canal, and Elbe-Weser Shipping Channel, is pumped into the Elbe. Hitherto the area, particularly the lower-lying Sietland which lies about 0.8 m below NN, had been chronically endangered by flooding.|$|R

50|$|The {{hydrological}} features at {{this site}} are most unusual. Being a domed bog, water enters the bog mainly from natural precipitation creating oligotrophic conditions. The periphery of the bog is encircled by a mineral-enriched lagg that maintains a base water level for the <b>bog.</b> <b>Drainage</b> is poor due to underlying clay deposits as well as numerous beaver dams. Water eventually drains slowly both westward into Greens Creek and eastward into Bear Brook. However, water levels remain {{at or near the}} surface of the bog for most of the year. Saline ground-water sources are found under the organic overburden. A number of artificial ditches were dug in the bog for land reclamation or drainage of adjacent lands, however, most are no longer functioning efficiently due to the many beaver impoundments and gradual sedimentation that has occurred along their lengths.|$|E
50|$|Edgeworth was {{involved}} {{in the construction of the}} Church of Ireland parish church at Collon in County Louth, where he worked with Daniel Augustus Beaufort (father of Richard Lovell Edgeworth's fourth wife). Others were William Fletcher (killed there in the building work), and Samuel Jones, brought up by William Edgeworth.Edgeworth's surveying work in Ireland included soundings in the River Inny and the mapping of bogs. Irish Bogs Commission was active in the period 1809 to 1814, and under an Act from 1774 there was funding for county maps from grand juries; Edgeworth reported on issues of <b>bog</b> <b>drainage</b> and reclamation. His 1813 map of County Longford was noted, and was followed by a map of County Roscommon with Richard Griffith. He worked also with William Hampton and John Brinkley. Unlike some other surveyors in Ireland at the time, he encountered little opposition to his work; he took a tactful and communicative line with local people.|$|E
50|$|Damage to peatland, {{partly due}} to palm oil production, is claimed to {{contribute}} to environmental degradation, including four percent of global greenhouse gas emissions and eight percent of all global emissions caused annually by burning fossil fuels, due to the clearing of large areas of rainforest for palm oil plantations. Many Indonesian and Malaysian rainforests lie atop peat bogs that store great quantities of carbon. Forest removal and <b>bog</b> <b>drainage</b> {{to make way for}} plantations releases this carbon.Researchers are looking for possible solutions and ways to help the situation and have suggested that if enough land is conserved and there remain large enough areas of primary forest reserves, the effects of the palm oil industry may not have as much of an impact on wildlife and biodiversity. Environmental groups like Greenpeace, the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil, and the Amnesty International are also taking part in advocating bans on unsustainable palm oil crops and the companies that purchase these exports.|$|E
40|$|We {{examined}} the effects of long-term (51 years) drainage on peat microbial communities using phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis. We analysed the peat profiles of natural and adjacent drained fen and bog sites. Viable microbes (i. e. microbial PLFA) were present in relatively large amounts even in the deepest peat layers of both peatland sites, a finding that warrants further investigation. Microbial biomass was generally higher in the fen than in the bog. Microbial community structure (indexed from PLFA) differed between the fen and bog sites and among depths. Although we did not exclude other factors, the effect of drainage on the total microbial biomass and community structure was not limited to the surface layers, but extended to the deepest layers of the fen and <b>bog.</b> Long-term <b>drainage</b> increased the total microbial PLFA biomass in the surface, subsurface and bottom layers of the fen, but decreased it in the surface and bottom layers of the <b>bog</b> site. <b>Drainage</b> also increased the characteristic FAs of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria in the surface and subsurface layers of the fen, and decreased them in the bottom layers of the bog site. The characteristic fungal FA was only reduced in the surface layers of the <b>bog</b> site by <b>drainage.</b> Thus, by affecting the microbial community beyond the surface layers, long-term peatland water-level draw-down can alter the microbial contribution to deeper peat organic matter stabilization. This suggests that long-term drainage may have a more significant climate change effect than revealed by the surface layer analyses alone...|$|R

40|$|Destruction of peat <b>bogs</b> by <b>drainage,</b> peat digging, {{agriculture}} and forestry in Central Europe represents a serious threat {{for the conservation of}} adapted species and characteristic habitat types. As a basis to form recommendations for renaturation procedures we investigated spider assemblages from different habitat types on the Dubringer Moor (Saxony, Germany). Spiders were recorded by pitfall trapping in 2012 in an Erica tetralix bog, a degenerated stage of the bog dominated by Molinia caerulea, two varieties of birch wood and four varieties of Picea abies forests. 22 of the 130 recorded spider species are endangered (Red Data Books of Germany and Saxony). Indicator species for different habitat types were found. Tyrphophilic and photohygrophilic species are characteristic for the peat bog stand as well as xerophylic spiders of dry heathlands – in the latter case caused by the more xerothermous conditions on the tops of hummocks. From the perspective of nature conservation the spruce-birch forests offer a more diverse habitat structure, photic and hygric amplitude than the spruce forest monocoenosis, resulting in a more diverse spider assemblage. Therefore, these woods could represent ’stepping stones’ for some species linking to rare Betula pubescens stands. The renaturation of the damaged bog sites should be enhanced by blocking ditches and cutting spruce, leading to reduced evaporation and re-wetting of the are...|$|R

Laboratory and in situ bioassays using Daphnia pulex tested the toxicity of the drainage water. These data were collected to evaluate ongoing efforts to reduce pesticide contamination discovered in cranberry <b>bog</b> <b>drainage</b> in 1994.

40|$|Dissolved {{organic carbon}} (DOC) in rivers {{contains}} {{a wide range}} of molecules that can be assimilated by microbes. However, there is today no integrated understanding of how the source and composition of this DOC regulate {{the extent to which the}} DOC can support microbial growth and respiration. We analyzed patterns in microbial metabolism of DOC from different streams and rivers in Québec, by combining short-term bacterial production and respiration measurements with long-term DOC loss and analyses of bacterial use of different single substrates. We show that distinct metabolic patterns indeed exist across catchments, reflecting the varying nature and sources of the DOC. For example, DOC from forest headwaters systematically supported the highest bacterial growth efficiency (BGE) that was recorded, while in contrast DOC in peat <b>bog</b> <b>drainage</b> was used with significantly lower BGE. The carbon consumption in clear mountain rivers, possibly represented by autochthonous algal DOC, supported the highest bacterial respiration rates and the highest long-term DOC losses. By using principle component analysis, we demonstrate how the major axes of variation in all of the measured metabolic responses are tightly connected to spectrofluorometrical DOC composition indicators and to isotopic indicators of DOC source. If causality is assumed, our results imply that changes in DOC supply from different sources, for example, caused by land use or climate change, should result in dramatic changes in the patterns of aquatic microbial metabolism and thus in altered aquatic ecosystem functioning, with likely consequences for food-web structures and greenhouse gas balances...|$|E
50|$|The {{bedrock of}} the park {{consists}} of Precambrian to Ordovician period quartzite and slate, plus Devonian period granite. All of these rocks, especially quartzite, have a high silica content and provide scanty amounts of nutrients to the soils that develop on them. The slate, however, is fine-grained and produces a loamy soil which yields its nutrients more quickly than the stony sandy loams and loamy sands found over the coarse-grained rocks. Most of the slaty loams occur around Kejimkujik Lake. Deep outwash sands and gravels form a band west of the lake. Elsewhere the soil landscape {{is dominated by the}} cobbly, often shallow granite or quartzite material. Podzols underlie most well-drained areas. Gleysols and peat <b>bogs</b> dominate where <b>drainage</b> is poor. The park receives acid rain, and its soils have few available acid-buffering minerals, so strong acidity is the rule for soils and waters—even large bodies of water such as Kejimkujik Lake.|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} is focused on Potamogeton polygonifolius – the species {{considered}} to be endangered in Germany, the Czech Republic, Poland and Switzerland. Field {{studies were carried out}} in Lower Silesia and Lusatia in southwestern Poland in order to verify the present state of the marginal populations of P. polygonifolius, to determine the habitat preferences of the species in the study area, to compare the ecological data between marginal and central populations and finally to recognise the factors constraining the easternmost limit of the P. polygonifolius. In total, 18 populations were examined, and 11 relevés were collected. The relevés gathered were compared with 95 relevés made in northwestern Germany, and with 10 relevés collected in the German part of Lusatia. There {{were no significant differences between}} the ecology of populations of P. polygonifolius on the eastern edge of its range and those in the central part. P. polygonifolius was found growing both in natural habitats like unspoiled peat bogs, and in anthropogenic habitats such as exploited peat <b>bogs</b> and <b>drainage</b> ditches. In both types of habitats its populations were abundant and competent in terms of generative propagation. The lack of geographical barriers as well as biology and fitness of P. polygonifolius individuals from the study area suggest that marginal populations are possibly a part of a large metapopulation, covering the whole (Polish and German) area of Lusatia, however, this hypothesis was not tested in detail. The main factor shaping the easternmost limit of the general range of P. polygonifolius is most likely climate, which prevents P. polygonifolius from spreading farther eastwards...|$|R
40|$|Roughly 6. 5 % of the German {{utilized}} {{agricultural area}} is located on organic soils (fens and <b>bogs).</b> Nevertheless, the <b>drainage</b> of these areas {{in order to allow}} their agricultural utilization causes roughly a third of the greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) of the German agricultural sector, being equivalent to 4 % of the total German GHG emissions. Obviously, German policies trying to reduce the GHG emissions successfully must tackle this issue. The abandonment of the cultivation of organic soils would be an effective policy to reduce the GHG emissions however the question remains whether it is an efficient measure compared with the other options? In the paper we assess the mitigation costs {{on the basis of the}} standard gross margin and tenure of the agriculturally used peatlands and with the results obtained from sector model RAUMIS. Without engineering and transaction costs the mitigation costs are in the magnitude of 10 to 45 € per to of CO 2 eq. This makes rewetting of peatlands at least in the medium and long run a fairly efficient options for reducing GHG emissions, especially as the implications on the sector due to reallocation affects are fairly small.

40|$|Bogs {{can store}} {{large amounts of}} lead (Pb) and arsenic (As) from {{atmospheric}} deposition of anthropogenic emissions. Pb and As are exported along with dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from these organic-rich systems, {{but it is not}} yet clear which hydrological (pre) conditions favor their export. This study combines a 1 -year monitoring of precipitation, bog water level and pore water concentration changes with bog discharge and DOC, iron, As and Pb stream concentrations. From these data, annual DOC, As, and Pb exports were calculated. Concentrations ranged from 5 to 30 mg L − 1 for DOC, 0. 2 to 1. 9 μg L − 1 for As, and 1. 3 to 12 μg L − 1 for Pb, with highest concentrations in late summer. As and Pb concentrations significantly correlated with DOC concentrations. Fluxes depended strongly on discharge, as 40 % of As and 43 % of Pb were exported during 10 % of the time with the highest discharge, pointing out the over-proportional contribution of short-time, high-discharge events to annual As, Pb and DOC export. Exponential increase in element export from the bog is explained by connection of additional DOC, As and Pb pools in the acrotelm during water table rise, which is most pronounced after drought. Pb, As and DOC concentrations in pore water provide evidence of an increase in the soluble Pb pool as soon as the peat layer becomes hydrologically connected, while DOC and As peak concentrations in runoff lag behind in comparison to Pb. Our data indicate a distinct bog-specific discharge threshold of 8 L s − 1, which is thought to depend mainly on the <b>bogs</b> size and <b>drainage</b> conditions. Above this threshold, element concentrations do not further increase and discharge becomes diluted. Combining pore water and discharge data shows that As and Pb exports are dependent on not only the amount of precipitation and discharge but also on the frequency and depth of water table fluctuations. Comparing the annual bog As and Pb export with element inventories indicates that As is much more mobilized than Pb, with annual fluxes accounting for 0. 85 and 0. 27 ‰ of total As and Pb inventory, respectively...|$|R
40|$|Die Hochmoore des Erzgebirges sind auf Grund ihrer jahrhunderte langen Nutzung und der ökosystemaren Wandelprozesse der vergangenen 10 - 15 Jahre unterschiedlich stark degradiert. Gleichzeitig sind sie durch den Austrag vergleichsweise hoher Austräge von DOC (Dissoloved Organic Carbon) gekennzeichnet. Um den Zusammenhang zwischen dem Zustand der Hochmoore, als Ergebnis in erster Linie der unterschiedlich nutzungsbedingten Degradation und den Stoffausträgen speziell den DOC-Austrägen zu erfassen, wurden mittels landschaftsökologischer Methoden Hochmoortestflächen verschiedener Zustände vergleichend untersucht. Die Ergebnisse lieferten erste Hinweise, dass in Flächen mit natürlicher Regeneration oder anthropogener Wiedervernässung vergleichsweise hohe DOC-Konzentrationen und – Austräge zu beobachten waren. Demgegenüber standen stärker degradierte Flächen mit zum Teil aktueller forstlicher Nutzung (geräumte Entwässerungsgräben), die durch geringere DOC-Konzentrationen und – Austräge charakterisiert waren. Da die gefundenen Zusammenhänge nicht endgültig belegt werden konnten, besteht insbesondere Forschungsbedarf hinsichtlich landschaftshaushaltlicher Untersuchungen unterschiedlich degradierter Hochmoore im Erzgebirge. Natural peat bogs {{are known}} as a sinks {{especially}} for carbon because of theire special matter and water balance. The use of peat <b>bogs</b> requiers their <b>drainage,</b> but consequently the peat will decompose unreversible and peatlands turn to a source esspecially for carbon. The peat bogs in the “Erzgebirge Mountains” were used over several centuries. Thats why the peatlands existing nowadays have different states dependent on the duratian of their use. Beside the use peatlands were mostly negativly effected by processes of ecological change in the “Erzgebirge Maountains” in the last 10 to 15 years. As one result of ecological change the increased output of DOC (Dissolved Organic Carbon) into surface waters can be seen. The main source for DOC are peatlands. By the way it seems to exist {{a connection between the}} output of DOC and other dissolved substances and the state of the peatlands especially of their ditches. To research this hypothesis four test areas of different state were chosen. Their state and the output of DOC and other dissolved substances were investigated with methods from landscape ecology from 2001 - 2003. It was the first time, that peatlands in the “Erzgebirge Mountains” were investigated in such a way. The badest state had the test area where the ditches were cleaned in 2000 / 2001 (“Weiße Mulde”, Western “Erzgebirge Mountains”). This test area showed the lowest but constant DOC-concentrations and DOC-output during the investigation period. The test areas “Carlsfeld” and “Löffelsbach” (Western “Erzgebirge Mountains”) had the best state. The state of “Carlsfeld” is related to the narueal closed ditches, which cause the processes of self regeneration. Due to such processes the DOCconcentrations were distinctly higher but very variable in dependence on weather and runoff. The same was supposed to DOC-output. The same valuation got the test area “Löffelsbach”, because of rewetting by technical closed ditches in 2001. During the investigation period the highest DOC-concentrations of all test areas were measured there. Similar to “Carlsfeld” DOC-concentrations and –output were highly variable in dependence on weather and runoff. The state of the test area “Salzflüßchen” (Eastern “Erzgebirge Mountains”) is also related to processes of self regeneration but was valuated bader than “Carlsfeld”, because the effect of former drainage was stronger in this area. In 2005 the rewetting of the test area is planed by “Naturpark Erzgebirge/ Vogtland”. In the consequence the DOC-concentrations and –output will increase similar to “Löffelsbach”. The results of the investigations indicate that a connection exists between state of peatlands and output of dissolved substances esspecially DOC. The results are supported by national and international literature. It will be clear, that more research is necessary especially on the field of comparative investigations of peatlands with different states in the “Erzgebirge Mountains”...|$|R
40|$|Peatlands {{occupy a}} mere 3 % of the world's land mass, but store {{up to one}} third of {{terrestrial}} carbon stocks. Peatlands are widely regarded as carbon sinks owing {{to their ability to}} sequester more carbon than is released. Carbon cycling in peatlands is driven by environmental conditions e. g. water table levels, temperature and pH; substrate quality i. e. the ease with which microbes can synthesise the carbon; nutrient availability and the composition of the microbial community. Peatlands are valued not only for their ability to sequester carbon, but also for the range of ecosystem services which they provide including the provision of food, recreation and leisure, a source of income for rural communities, water supply and as habitats for a range of flora and fauna. As a result, management of peatlands is widespread, with the four most common methods of management of upland blanket <b>bogs</b> being afforestation, <b>drainage,</b> grazing and burning. To date, little work has been carried out on the effects of such management practices on carbon losses or drivers of the carbon cycle. The aim of this research was to identify how these management practices influenced losses of carbon from peatlands as well as the chemical and physical drivers of the peatland carbon cycle. A combination of field and laboratory work was carried out on managed peats with an unmanaged site at the Moor House National Nature Reserve in Cumbria. Field monitoring involved measurement of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in the peat solution, water table levels and carbon dioxide gains and losses. Laboratory analysis was carried out on cores of peat to examine nutrient concentrations, the structure of the peat in terms of porosity and density; carbon stocks {{and the quality of the}} carbon. The results of this research demonstrated that all sites including the unmanaged site acted as carbon sources. Greatest losses occurred from the afforested site, where losses of DOC were significantly higher than all other sites and some of the highest losses of carbon dioxide were found. In contrast, the site that was burnt on a 10 year rotation was found to be a very slight carbon sink, held the most carbon within the peat and lost the least amount of DOC. Few significant differences in the chemical composition of the peat were observed between the sites, however, lignin, the most recalcitrant fraction was found to be significantly lower in the burnt (every 10 years) site, which had the highest carbon content. Lignin was identified as the dominant constituent of the peat for all the sites, with highest concentrations present in the afforested site. The high lignin content of the peats from all the sites indicated that the peats are in the latter stages of decomposition, and are thus fairly recalcitrant. The higher lignin content in the afforested site, coupled with the highest losses of DOC, some of the highest CO 2 losses through ER (ecosystem respiration), however, suggest that the chemical composition of the peat is not a strong a driver of the peatland carbon cycle. Temperature was found to be the dominant driver of ER, accounting for between 54 and 92 % of variation in the data. The afforested site was the only treatment where a significant relationship between temperature and ER was not identified. Rates of primary productivity were highest in the burnt and grazed sites indicating that regeneration of the vegetation through management is of key importance in terms of sequestering carbon. The lowest primary productivity was identified at the drained site, where concentrations of nitrogen were also lowest. In terms of the structure of the peat, the air filled porosity of the burnt and grazed (every 20 years) site was greatest, however no linkages were established between the structure of the peat and gaseous carbon losses. This thesis has provided a unique insight into the effects of land management on the drivers of the peatland carbon cycle, carbon dioxide gains and losses, and DOC production. Further work should focus on examining the effects of the intensity of land management practices on peatland carbon budget for example, comparing low and high temperature burns, or closely spaced drains with drains that are located far apart. The results of this thesis suggest that future management needs to focus on encouraging increased PP by managing water table levels and promoting growth of peat forming species of vegetation such as Sphagnum. Light burning was also found to increase water table levels and peat solution acidity, thus reducing losses of DOC into the peat solution. The results demonstrated that temperature is the most important control on ER, and under climate change losses are likely to increase, therefore, the need twas found to be strongly linked to water table levels, pH and the carbon quality, with higher concentrations of holocellulose resulting in reduced losses of DOC.
