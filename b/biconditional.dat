5|$|For Rhodes, throffers can {{not merely}} be <b>biconditional</b> proposals. If Q proposes that P pay $10,000 so that Q withholds {{information}} {{that would lead to}} Ps arrest, then {{despite the fact that the}} proposal is <b>biconditional</b> (that is, P may choose to pay or not pay, which would lead to different outcomes) it is not a throffer. This is because choosing to pay cannot be considered attractive for P independent of Qs proposal. Ps paying of Q does not lead to the satisfaction of an attainment-want, which is a necessary condition for a proposal's being an offer under Rhodes's account. The exception to this is when an agent offers to help another overcome a background threat (a threat that was not introduced by the proposal). Biconditionals, in addition to either threats or offers, may contain neutral proposals, and so not be throffers. The possibility of another agent's not acting is necessarily neutral. Throffers are those <b>biconditional</b> proposals that contain both a threat and an offer, as opposed to <b>biconditional</b> proposals containing a threat and neutral proposal, or an offer and a neutral proposal. In the case of throffers, it is always going to be difficult or even impossible to determine whether an agent acts on the threatening aspect of the proposal or the offer.|$|E
25|$|Davidson's work is {{well noted}} for its unity, as he has brought a similar {{approach}} {{to a wide variety}} of philosophical problems. Radical interpretation is a hypothetical standpoint which Davidson regards as basic to the investigation of language, mind, action, and knowledge. Radical interpretation involves imagining that you are placed into a community which speaks a language you do not understand at all. How could you come to understand the language? One suggestion is that you know a theory that generates a theorem of the form 's means that p' for every sentence of the object language (i.e. the language of the community), where s is the name of a sentence in the object language, and p is that sentence, or a translation of it, in the metalanguage in which the theory is expressed. However, Davidson rejects that suggestion on the grounds that the sentential operator 'means that' is sensitive not only to the extensions of the terms that follow it, but also to their intensions. Hence, Davidson replaces 'means that' with a connective sensitive only to the extensions of sentences; since the extension of a sentence is its truth value, this is a truth functional connective. Davidson elects the <b>biconditional</b> (if and only if) as the connective needed in a theory of meaning. He concludes that a theory of meaning must be such that for each sentence of the object language it generates a theorem of the form 's is true if and only if p'. A theory of truth for a language can serve as a theory of meaning.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Compounds of {{indicative}} conditionals {{present some}} puzzling phenomena. Perhaps most striking, some nested indicative conditionals are uninterpretable. Proponents of NTV hold that indicative conditionals {{do not have}} truth values, and they use this to explain why nested indicative conditionals are sometimes uninterpretable: the embedded conditional does not provide the truth conditions needed by the embedding conditional. Cases where nested conditionals are interpretable are then explained away as ad hoc, pragmatic interpretation. We challenge the NTV explanation for why nested conditionals are sometimes interpretable, sometimes not. The standard reasons for NTV about indicative conditionals — triviality results, Gibbardian standoffs, etc. — extend naturally to NTV about <b>biconditionals.</b> So NTVers about conditionals should also be NTVers about <b>biconditionals.</b> But <b>biconditionals</b> embed much more freely than conditionals. If NTV explains why some nested conditionals are uninterpretable, why do <b>biconditionals</b> embed successfully in the very contexts where conditionals do not embed? 1...|$|R

40|$|In {{combination}} with the local disquotation principle, the list of Yablo <b>biconditionals</b> is not formally paradoxical, but rather ω-paradoxical. It is unsatisfiable on (any expansion of) the standard model N of arithmetic. This is the most that any formal proof related to Yablo's paradox can establish using just the local disquotation principle for Yablo sentences. Indeed, the list of Yablo <b>biconditionals</b> is satisfiable on all non-standard models, and is formally consistent. Bueno and Colyvan are mistaken in insisting that the list of Yablo <b>biconditionals</b> plus the local disquotation principle is sufficient for a formal derivation of the paradox. As already noted, and explained in Priest 1997, one can reconstruct the paradox (i. e. one can deduce an inconsistency from certain assumptions), but this necessarily requires a pair of uniform assumptions: the Uniform Fixed-Point Yablo Principle and the Uniform Yablo Disquotation Scheme. And finally, whether one expresses the relevant disquotation principles using a truth predicate or a satisfaction predicate is immaterial, since these notions are interdefinable. © Jeffrey Ketland...|$|R

This article is an improvement on Halbach's argument.
