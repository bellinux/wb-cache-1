There is no evidence of extra <b>blood</b> <b>vessels</b> in the crest for this purpose, however, and the large, membranous wings filled with <b>blood</b> <b>vessels</b> would have served that purpose much more effectively.|$|E
5|$|Anecdotally {{injection}} of alprazolam has been reported, causing dangerous damage to <b>blood</b> <b>vessels,</b> closure of <b>blood</b> <b>vessels</b> (embolization) and decay of muscle tissue (rhabdomyolysis). Alprazolam {{is not very}} soluble in water—when crushed in water it does not fully dissolve (40µg/ml of H2O at pH 7). There have also been anecdotal reports of alprazolam being snorted. Due to the low weight of a dose, alprazolam, in one case, was distributed on blotter paper {{in a manner similar}} to LSD.|$|E

5|$|Dissection {{occurs when}} blood accumulates {{in the wall}} of the blood vessel. This is most likely due to a tear in the tunica intima (the inner layer), {{allowing}} blood to enter the tunica media, although other lines of evidence have suggested that the blood may instead arise from the vasa vasorum, the small <b>blood</b> <b>vessels</b> that supply the outer layer of larger <b>blood</b> <b>vessels.</b> Various theories exist as to whether people who sustain carotid and vertebral artery dissection, even if not suffering from a connective tissue disorder, have an underlying vulnerability. Biopsy samples of skin and other arteries has indicated that this might be a possibility, but no genetic defect in collagen or elastin genes has been convincingly proven. Other studies have indicated inflammation of the <b>blood</b> <b>vessels,</b> as measured by highly sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP, a marker of inflammation) in the blood.|$|E
5|$|Most (about two-thirds to 80%) of CSF is {{produced}} by the choroid plexus. The choroid plexus is a network of <b>blood</b> <b>vessels</b> present within sections of the four ventricles of the brain. It is present throughout the ventricular system except for the cerebral aqueduct, frontal horn of the lateral ventricle, and occipital horn of the lateral ventricle.

5|$|Telangiectasias and {{arteriovenous}} malformations in HHT {{are thought}} to arise because of changes in angiogenesis, the development of <b>blood</b> <b>vessels</b> out of existing ones. The {{development of a new}} blood vessel requires the activation and migration of various types of cells, chiefly endothelium, smooth muscle and pericytes. The exact mechanism by which the HHT mutations influence this process is not yet clear, and it is likely that they disrupt a balance between pro- and antiangiogenic signals in <b>blood</b> <b>vessels.</b> The wall of telangiectasias is unusually friable, which explains the tendency of these lesions to bleed.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a new 3 D (three-dimensional) <b>blood</b> <b>vessel</b> {{modeling}} method for FSI (fluid-structure interaction) analysis. Because {{of the nature}} of medical images, a 3 D <b>blood</b> <b>vessel</b> model that includes intima and adventitia cannot be reconstructed using a single medical image. Many researchers have used IVUS (intravascular ultrasound) images to obtain detailed intima and adventitia information and X-ray angiogram images to calculate the position and orientation of IVUS images. By combining these types of medical images, 3 D <b>blood</b> <b>vessel</b> model can be generated. However, when an IVUS image is taken, a catheter attached to a miniaturized ultrasound device is inserted into the <b>blood</b> <b>vessel,</b> so the shape of the <b>blood</b> <b>vessel</b> is deformed. The resulting 3 D <b>blood</b> <b>vessel</b> model developed by combining the IVUS and X-ray angiogram images reflects the deformation of the <b>blood</b> <b>vessel</b> by the IVUS catheter. To solve this problem, we propose a novel method for 3 D <b>blood</b> <b>vessel</b> modeling using undeformed intima and adventitia information obtained with an IVUS catheter...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE. Vascular ectasia in port wine stain birthmarks (PWS) {{might result}} from reduced {{innervation}} with loss of autonomic stimulation. We investigated this theory and evaluated nerve and <b>blood</b> <b>vessel</b> density, and mean <b>blood</b> <b>vessel</b> size in untreated and treated PWS skin. METHODS. Skin biopsy specimens were obtained from uninvolved skin, untreated PWS, PWS with a good response to laser treatment and PWS with a poor response to laser treatment. Confocal microscopy was performed to determine nerve and <b>blood</b> <b>vessel</b> density, and mean <b>blood</b> <b>vessel</b> size. RESULTS. Nerve density was significantly decreased in all PWS sites compared to uninvolved skin. Mean <b>blood</b> <b>vessel</b> diameter was larger in untreated compared to treated PWS. PWS with a good response to treatment had decreased nerve density but <b>blood</b> <b>vessel</b> density and mean diameter was relatively normal. PWS with a poor response to treatment had decreased nerve density but increased <b>blood</b> <b>vessel</b> density and mean <b>blood</b> <b>vessel</b> diameter compared to normal skin. CONCLUSION. Nerve density was decreased in all evaluated PWS sites {{and this may be}} a factor in lesion pathogenesis. PWS <b>blood</b> <b>vessel</b> size correlated with pulsed dye laser response and may prove to be a useful prognostic indicator of therapeutic outcome...|$|R

5|$|Adrenaline and {{noradrenaline}} are catecholamines, water-soluble {{compounds that}} have a structure made of a catechol group and an amine group. The adrenal glands are {{responsible for most of}} the adrenaline that circulates in the body, but only for a small amount of circulating noradrenaline. These hormones are released by the adrenal medulla, which contains a dense network of <b>blood</b> <b>vessels.</b> Adrenaline and noradrenaline act at adrenoreceptors throughout the body, with effects that include an increase in blood pressure and heart rate. The actions of adrenaline and noradrenaline are responsible for the fight or flight response, characterised by a quickening of breathing and heart rate, an increase in blood pressure, and constriction of <b>blood</b> <b>vessels</b> {{in many parts of the}} body.|$|E

5|$|The <b>blood</b> <b>vessels</b> and lymph {{vessels are}} considered, the valves of the heart, and the {{separate}} functions of arteries and veins. Paley argues that such functions {{as that of}} the epiglottis could not have formed gradually (as by evolution).|$|E
5|$|The {{symptoms}} {{produced by}} AVMs {{in the liver}} depend {{on the type of}} abnormal connection that they form between <b>blood</b> <b>vessels.</b> If the connection is between arteries and veins, a large amount of blood bypasses the body's organs, for which the heart compensates by increasing the cardiac output. Eventually congestive cardiac failure develops ("high-output cardiac failure"), with breathlessness and leg swelling among other problems. If the AVM creates a connection between the portal vein and the <b>blood</b> <b>vessels</b> of the liver, the result may be portal hypertension (increased portal vein pressure), in which collateral <b>blood</b> <b>vessels</b> form in the esophagus (esophageal varices), which may bleed violently; furthermore, the increased pressure may give rise to fluid accumulation in the abdominal cavity (ascites). If the flow in the AVM is in the other direction, portal venous blood flows directly into the veins rather than running through the liver; this may lead to hepatic encephalopathy (confusion due to portal waste products irritating the brain). Rarely, the bile ducts are deprived of blood, leading to severe cholangitis (inflammation of the bile ducts). Liver AVMs are detectable in over 70% of people with HHT, but only 10% experience problems as a result.|$|E
