When Hornigold took command of the Ranger, he {{delegated}} the captaincy of his earlier sloop to Teach. In the spring of 1717 the two pirate captains seized three merchant ships in quick succession, one carrying 120 barrels of flour bound for Havana, another a <b>Bermudian</b> <b>sloop</b> with a cargo of spirits and the third a Portuguese ship travelling from Madeira with a cargo of white wine.|$|E

50|$|Bermuda was in {{de facto}} control of the Turks Islands, with their lucrative salt industry, from the late 17th century to the early 19th. The Bahamas made {{perpetual}} attempts to claim the Turks for itself. On several occasions, this involved seizing the vessels of Bermudian salt traders. A virtual state of war was said to exist between Bermudian and Bahamian vessels {{for much of the}} 18th century. When the <b>Bermudian</b> <b>sloop</b> Seaflower was seized by the Bahamians in 1701, the response of the Governor of Bermuda, Captain Benjamin Bennett, was to issue letters of marque to Bermudian vessels. In 1706, Spanish and French forces ousted the Bermudians, but were driven out themselves three years later by the Bermudian privateer Captain Lewis Middleton. His ship, the Rose, attacked a Spanish and a French privateer holding a captive English vessel.

50|$|A virtual state-of-war {{existed between}} Bermuda and the Bahamas {{through much of}} the Eighteenth Century. When the <b>Bermudian</b> <b>sloop</b> Seaflower was seized by the Bahamians in 1701, the {{response}} of Bermuda Governor Bennett was to issue letters-of-marque to Bermudians vessels. The legal struggle with the Bahamas began in 1766, when the King's representative in the Bahamas, Andrew Symmer, on his own authority, wrote a constitution which legislated for and taxed the Bermudians on the Turks. The Secretary of State, Lord Hillsborough, for the Crown, issued orders that the Bermudian activities on the Turks should not be obstructed or restrained in any way. As a result of this order, Symmer's constitution was dissolved. The Bermudians on the Turks appointed commissioners to govern themselves, with the assent of the King's local agent. They drew up regulations for good government, but the Bahamian governor Shirley drew up his own regulations for the Turks and ordered that no one might work at salt raking who had not signed assent to his regulations.|$|E

50|$|In Bermuda, the Bermuda rig, {{now almost}} {{universal}} on small sailing vessels, {{can still be}} seen in its purest form in the Bermuda Fitted Dinghy, used {{for a series of}} races contested each year by the colony's yacht clubs. The first race of this type was held in 1880, as a way of reducing the costs then experienced racing larger <b>Bermudian</b> <b>sloops,</b> with their similarly-larger professional crews. BFD racing was restricted to amateurs, although each dinghy carries a crew of six.|$|R
5000|$|The Royal Navy {{sought to}} counter the threat of French privateers in the New World by {{commissioning}} its own light vessels, built along the lines of traditional Bermuda sloops. The first three vessels commissioned from Bermudian shipyards were 200 ton, 12-gun sloops-of-war, ordered in 1795, and commissioned as , [...] and [...] Over the next fifteen years, the Admiralty would commission a great many more vessels from Bermudian builders, manned by locally recruited officers and crews. Although the first were intended {{to counter the}} privateer menace, <b>Bermudian</b> <b>sloops</b> ultimately became 'advice' vessels, using their speed and handling to evade enemies, and carrying communications and vital freight around the globe. They were also used for reconnaissance and maintaining pickets. In addition to ships commissioned by the Admiralty, Bermudian merchant vessels were also bought-up and commissioned for this purpose. The most famous was undoubtedly , which carried the news of British victory back from Trafalgar.|$|R
50|$|Initially {{influenced}} by the Mediterranean lateen rigs introduced during Spain's rule of their country, the Dutch had modified the design by omitting the masts, with the yards of the lateens being stepped in thwarts. By this process, the yards became raked masts. Lateen sails mounted this way were known as leg-of-mutton sails. The Dutch called a vessel rigged in this manner a bezaanjacht (nl). The Bermuda sloop differed from other sloops partly {{in the form of}} its hull, which was very stiff. This stiffness was a result partially of the shipbuilding skills on the islanders, but also thanks to the availability of large quantities of Bermuda cedar, which has superior qualities of rot-resistance, low density (making the ships lighter and faster) and high strength (making the ships more durable). The vessels carried little fixed ballast, which allowed them to transport large cargoes. Designed to sail primarily on the open ocean, their relatively deep hulls gave them superior seaworthiness by comparison to similar vessels, such as the Baltimore Clipper, which were intended to operate in coastal waters. The fore-and-aft rig was particularly useful in maneuvering upwind. Moreover, single-masted <b>Bermudian</b> <b>sloops</b> were optimized for speed. This made them a very demanding craft to sail. In rough weather, they were easily swamped.|$|R

A keen sportsman who hunted when young and regularly rode Household Cavalry horses in Hyde Park, he also played polo, squash and tennis. Cronin was an enthusiastic yachtsman [...] - [...] a member of the Royal Lymington Yacht Club, based in Hampshire, he sailed regularly and was Commodore of the House of Commons Yacht Club. His yacht, named Hardie after the founder of the Labour party, was a 17 ton <b>Bermudian</b> rigged <b>sloop</b> and won the Cowes to Cherbourg Yacht race with Cronin at the helm.|$|R
5000|$|The Laser 2 is a {{double-handed}} {{version of}} the popular Laser one-design class of small sailing dinghy. It is a quick, planing dinghy that differs from the Laser in {{that it has a}} jib, symmetric spinnaker and a trapeze for the crew. It was designed by New Zealander Frank Bethwaite and was first launched as a product in Australia then North America in 1979 and in Europe in 1980. The hull is made of GRP (glass reinforced plastic). The rig is a <b>Bermudian</b> rig <b>sloop</b> with spinnaker. It is designed to be a mid to high performance racer. In Britain, its most common current use is at university class in British University Sailing Association (BUSA) events. A version known as the Laser Fun was available, the same hull but featuring a reefable mainsail and a roller furling jib, and with the option of an asymmetric spinnaker (Laser Fun New Wave). As a strict one-design boat the Laser 2 was not available for amateur construction.|$|R
