25|$|The {{precursor}} sciences to {{the development}} of modern computer graphics were the advances in electrical engineering, electronics, and television that took place {{during the first half of}} the twentieth century. Screens could display art since the Lumiere brothers' use of mattes to create special effects for the earliest films dating from 1895, but such displays were limited and not interactive. The first cathode ray tube, the <b>Braun</b> <b>tube,</b> was invented in 1897 - it in turn would permit the oscilloscope and the military control panel - the more direct precursors of the field, as they provided the first two-dimensional electronic displays that responded to programmatic or user input. Nevertheless, computer graphics remained relatively unknown as a discipline until the 1950s and the post-World War II period - during which time the discipline emerged from a combination of both pure university and laboratory academic research into more advanced computers and the United States military's further development of technologies like radar, advanced aviation, and rocketry developed during the war. New kinds of displays were needed to process the wealth of information resulting from such projects, leading {{to the development}} of computer graphics as a discipline.|$|E
50|$|Cathode ray tubes (CRTs) were {{developed}} in the late 19th century. At that time, the tubes were intended primarily to demonstrate and explore the physics of electrons (then known as cathode rays). Karl Ferdinand Braun invented the CRT oscilloscope as a physics curiosity in 1897, by applying an oscillating signal to electrically charged deflector plates in a phosphor-coated CRT. <b>Braun</b> <b>tubes</b> were laboratory apparatus, using a cold-cathode emitter and very high voltages (on the order of 20,000 to 30,000 volts). With only vertical deflection applied to the internal plates, {{the face of the}} tube was observed through a rotating mirror to provide a horizontal time base. In 1899 Jonathan Zenneck equipped the cathode ray tube with beam-forming plates and used a magnetic field for sweeping the trace.|$|R
5000|$|Rosing's {{invention}} expanded on {{the designs}} of Paul Nipkow and his mechanical system of rotating lenses and mirrors. Accordingly, Rosing's system employed a mechanical camera device, but used very early cathode ray tube (developed in Germany by Karl Ferdinand Braun) as a receiver. Rosing's <b>Braun</b> <b>Tubes</b> consisted of two parallel metal plates {{that were used to}} electrically shift the electron beam itself before it was scanned and reached the screen. These two plates were connected electrically to the photoelectric cell in the camera. Depending on the output of the photoelectric cells, the beam would be deflected up or down before entering the concentrating plate. Since this movement increased or decreased the number of electrons passing between the plates, it had the effect of varying the brightness of the electron beam. The system was primitive, but it was definitely one of the first experimental demonstrations where the cathode ray tube was employed for the purposes of television.|$|R
50|$|Jonathan Adolf Wilhelm Zenneck (15 April 1871 - 8 April 1959) was a {{physicist}} and electrical engineer. Zenneck {{was born in}} Ruppertshofen, Württemberg.

Zenneck improved the <b>Braun</b> cathode ray <b>tube,</b> by adding a second deflection structure at right angles to the first, which allowed two-dimensional viewing of a waveform.

The system performance was excellent; the range was read off the <b>Braun</b> <b>tube</b> with a tolerance of 50 meters (less than 1 percent variance), and the lobe switching allowed a directional accuracy of 0.1 degree. Historically, this marked the first naval vessel equipped with radar. Although this apparatus was not put into production, GEMA was funded to develop similar systems operating around 50 cm (500 MHz).

To make the problem clearer, the present author utilized a special fluid electrode after Sugi (so-called Sugi 2 ̆ 7 s insulating vessel). The muscle was connected to a load which could be suddenly released to stretch the muscle with a special equipment. The potential difference across the separating wall was led through the electrodes placed in compartments to an amplifier and <b>Braun</b> <b>tube</b> oscilloscope. 1) The muscle showed negative potential of a few millivolt {{at the time of}} sudden stretch (Fig. 3). 2) The size of this potential was proportional to the degree of stretching not to the tension (Fig. 4). 3) The negative potential developed at the initial phase of stretching decreased gradually in the course of time, while the length of muscle still continued to increase. The mechanisms underlying the phenomena are not identical in the initial and delayed phases. 4) Action potential of the stretched muscle was smaller than that of the control muscle. 5) The stretching potential increased {{at the side of the}} muscle applied with anodic current, decreased at the side of cathodic current. 6) Influences of various salts, ions and their concentrations on the stretching potential were investigated with the result that the size of the potential were arranged in order K > Rb > NH_ 4; Na > Li; though partially an accordance with Hofmeister 2 ̆ 7 s series, and that the potentialities of monovalent cations were superior to that of bivalent cations. 7) From the observations that these factor 2 ̆ 7 s interfere with the stretching potential, some speculative insight into the mechanism of the stretching potential was indicated.

As for the small monophasic discharge appearing subsequent to the polyphasic discharge as mentioned in par. 2 above, it may appear singly or in pairs. In these monophasic discharges, no such secondary discharge as can normally be seen in the case of Narke was observed. 4.
