5|$|Although much of {{his life}} remains obscure, Nerva was {{considered}} a wise and moderate emperor by ancient historians.

5|$|Bloodlines is {{an action}} {{role-playing}} video game optionally presented from the first- or third-person perspective.

5|$|Interaction with non-player {{characters}} (NPCs) {{was a large}} design focus. When {{the player}} interacts with a non-player character, the game will enter a cutscene-like conversation mode where the player advances the conversation <b>by</b> <b>selecting</b> {{from a list of}} dialogue options. The player's choices often have a substantial effect on both gameplay and plot, as non-player characters will react in different ways depending on the selected answer (e.g. rudeness makes them less likely to provide assistance).|$|E
5|$|Other lemurs {{that do not}} exhibit {{dormancy}} conserve energy <b>by</b> <b>selecting</b> thermoregulated microhabitats (such as tree holes), sharing nests, {{and reducing}} exposed body surfaces, such as by hunched sitting and group huddling. Also, the ring-tailed lemur, ruffed lemurs, and sifakas are commonly seen sunning, thus using solar radiation to warm their bodies instead of metabolic heat.|$|E

5|$|Alexander's death raised {{questions}} about the succession to the throne as well as the nature of the Greek regime. As the king had contracted an unequal marriage his descendants were not in the line of succession. The Hellenic Parliament demanded that Constantine I and Crown Prince George be excluded from the succession but sought to preserve the monarchy <b>by</b> <b>selecting</b> another member of the royal house as the new sovereign. On 29 October 1920, the Greek minister in Berne, acting {{under the direction of the}} Greek authorities, offered the throne to Alexander's younger brother, Prince Paul. Paul, however, refused to become king while his father and elder brother were alive, insisting that neither of them had renounced their rights to the throne and that he therefore could never legitimately wear the crown.|$|E
5|$|Barnum Brown, {{assistant}} {{curator of}} the American Museum of Natural History, found the first partial skeleton of Tyrannosaurus rex in eastern Wyoming in 1900. H. F. Osborn originally named this skeleton Dynamosaurus imperiosus in a paper in 1905. Brown found another partial skeleton in the Hell Creek Formation in Montana in 1902. Osborn used this holotype to describe Tyrannosaurus rex in the same paper in which D. imperiosus was described. In 1906, Osborn recognized the two as synonyms, and acted as first revisor <b>by</b> <b>selecting</b> Tyrannosaurus as the valid name. The original Dynamosaurus material resides in the collections of the Natural History Museum, London.|$|E

5|$|CTW {{solicited}} the Educational Testing Service (ETS) {{to conduct}} its summative research. CTW and ETS hired and trained coordinators, testers, and observers from local communities to conduct these studies. The most relevant {{tests of the}} show's effectiveness were comparisons between children who watched it regularly {{and those who did}} not. After the first season, however, Sesame Street was so widely watched that it was difficult to make this distinction; ETS began to have problems finding subjects for their non-viewing groups, which weakened the experimental design. It solved this problem <b>by</b> <b>selecting</b> control-group households from areas that did not broadcast the show. Instead of using groups of viewers and non-viewers, later large-scale studies used statistical designs and methods for estimating cause-effect relationships.|$|E
5|$|Carroll had {{considered}} {{running for the}} U.S. Senate in 1968, but {{dropped out of the}} race after just two weeks when he discovered that it would take well over $100,000 to run a competitive primary campaign. In 1971, former governor Bert T. Combs sought a second term as governor and chose Carroll as his informal running mate. (The governor and lieutenant governor were elected separately at the time.) Combs, an Eastern Kentucky native, sought geographic balance for the ticket <b>by</b> <b>selecting</b> Carroll, from the far-west Jackson Purchase. Combs said he would provide the needed financing, and Carroll agreed to enter the race.|$|E
5|$|For {{the first}} four seasons, {{prospect}} UFC fighters from two different weight categories were selected to compete. The fighters are divided into two teams, irrespective of weight class, with each team coached by a current UFC headliner. The teams then compete (in a manner which varies by season) with the loser being eliminated from the competition. Often, incentives are provided for the team of a winning fighter. This can include the right for their team to select the next matchup, in order to pick off fighters from the opposing team <b>by</b> <b>selecting</b> favourable matchups.|$|E

5|$|Local {{multiplayer}} {{allows the}} player to select which teams {{participate in the}} battle {{as well as the}} number of worms and handicaps, which options and weapons are used, and the level to be played on. The matches can use any combination of human and computer teams, provided at least one team is human. Additionally, multiple worm teams can form an alliance for the match <b>by</b> <b>selecting</b> the same team color – they will still operate separately in movement rotation but share weapons and score. If multiple human players are using the same computer, the game functions in a hotseat mode.|$|E
5|$|Springbok are {{primarily}} browsers and may switch to grazing occasionally; they feed on shrubs and young succulents (such as Lampranthus species) before they lignify. They prefer grasses such as Themeda triandra. Springbok can meet their water needs {{from the food}} they eat, {{and are able to}} survive without drinking water through dry season. In extreme cases, they do not drink any water over the course of their lives. Springbok may accomplish this <b>by</b> <b>selecting</b> flowers, seeds, and leaves of shrubs before dawn, when the food items are most succulent. In places such as the Etosha National Park, springbok seek out water bodies where they are available. Springbok gather in the wet season and disperse during the dry season, unlike other African mammals.|$|E
5|$|Another aspect {{introduced}} in the game is the Dimension Link (D-Link), measured in a blue gauge on the interface. It is used to draw power from certain companions who the player characters meet during the game, such as Experiment 626, temporarily replacing the commands in the player's customized command deck with a pre-determined set of commands that differ with each D-Link. Once the command gauge is filled while performing a D-Link, a powerful finishing move is activated to take out enemies. Each finishing move has two levels which can render a finishing move more powerful than before, {{similar to that of}} the Command System. The D-Link can only be used when its corresponding gauge is filled completely, and can be activated by pressing right on the directional pad to access the D-Link menu, followed <b>by</b> <b>selecting</b> the chosen ally.|$|E

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the game, the player accumulates mass by colliding their asteroid against other asteroids until enough mass has been gathered to become a small planet. From there, the player has to absorb other asteroids to make their planet grow enough to become a life planet; crashing against other objects will decrease the player's mass. At this point, life forms will evolve in the planet, creating spaceships, planetary shields and cannons. If the player wishes, they can accumulate more mass until their planet becomes a star. Life forms will disappear, but the player will be able to attract planets to form a solar system, further grow the star by absorbing other planets, or a combination of both. The player can also create multi-star systems <b>by</b> <b>selecting</b> planets from their system and make them absorb asteroids until they become another star.|$|E
5|$|Broken Sword II: The Smoking Mirror is a 2D {{adventure}} {{game played}} from a third-person perspective. Via a point-and-click interface, the player guides protagonist George Stobbart through the game's world and {{interacts with the}} environment <b>by</b> <b>selecting</b> from multiple commands, while Nicole Collard is also a playable character in selected portions of the game. The player controls George's movements and actions with a mouse (PC and PlayStation), or a gamepad (PlayStation). Player can collect objects {{that can be used}} with either other collectible objects, parts of the scenery, or with other people in order to solve puzzles and progress in the game. George can engage in dialogue with other characters through conversation trees to gain hints of {{what needs to be done}} to solve the puzzles or to progress the plot. The player uses a map to travel, and new locations are added to it as the story unfolds. By right clicking on an object, the player gets a description and clues. The player character's death is possible if the player makes a wrong decision.|$|E
5|$|Combat {{occurs in}} real-time, and the player {{character}} may use both melee and ranged weapons. The player attacks by holding the cursor over the game screen and clicking, depressing the button longer to inflict greater damage. Some weapons allow for {{different types of}} attacks depending on where the cursor is held; for example, clicking {{near the bottom of}} the screen may result in a jab, while clicking in the middle produces a slash. Simulated dice rolls occur behind the scenes to determine weapon accuracy. Enemies sometimes try to escape when near death, and the game's stealth mechanics may occasionally be used to avoid combat altogether. The player may cast spells <b>by</b> <b>selecting</b> an appropriate combination of runestones. Like mantras, runestones must be found in the game world before use. There are over forty spells, some undocumented; their effects range from causing earthquakes to allowing the player character to fly.|$|E
