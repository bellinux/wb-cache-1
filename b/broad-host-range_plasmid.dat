40|$|Broad-host-range {{plasmids}} {{are frequently}} associated with antibiotic resistance genes and can quickly spread antibiotic resistant phenotypes among diverse bacterial populations. Wastewater treatment {{plants have been}} identified as reser-voirs for broad-host-range plasmids carrying resistance genes. The threat of broad-host-range plasmids released into the environment from wastewater treatment plants has identified the need for disinfection protocols to target <b>broad-host-range</b> <b>plasmid</b> destruction. Here we evaluate the efficacy of dissolved ozone at 2 and 8 mg·L– 1 as a primary means for the destruction of <b>broad-host-range</b> <b>plasmid</b> and chromosomal DNA in simulated effluent. Pilot-scale tests using an experimental unit were carried out in municipal wastewater treatment plant effluent and compared with ultraviolet (UV) -irradiation and chlorination methodologies. Genes specific to Escherichia coli (uidA) and IncP broad-host-range plasmids (trfA) were monitored using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), and total DNA was monitored using absorbance spectroscopy. In wastewater treatment plant experiments, E. coli qPCR results were com-pared to a recognized culture-based method (Colilert®) for E. coli. In laboratory experiments, dissolved ozone at 8 mg·L– 1 significantly destroyed 93 % total, 98 % E. coli, and 99 % of <b>broad-host-range</b> <b>plasmid</b> DNA. Ozonation, UV-irradiation, and chlorination significantly reduced DNA concentrations and culturable E. coli in wastewater treat-ment plant effluent.

40|$|<b>Broad-host-range</b> <b>plasmids</b> {{are known}} to spread genes between {{distinct}} phylogenetic groups of bacteria. These genes often code for resistances to antibiotics and heavy metals or degradation of pollutants. Although some <b>broad-host-range</b> <b>plasmids</b> have been extensively studied, their evolutionary history and genetic diversity remain largely unknown. The goal {{of this study was}} to analyze and compare the genomes of 12 <b>broad-host-range</b> <b>plasmids</b> that were previously isolated from Norwegian soils by exogenous plasmid isolation and that encode mercury resistance. Complete nucleotide sequencing followed by phylogenetic analyses based on the relaxase gene traI showed that all the plasmids belong to one of two subgroups (β and ε) of the well-studied incompatibility group IncP- 1. A diverse array of accessory genes was found to be involved in resistance to antimicrobials (streptomycin, spectinomycin, and sulfonamides), degradation of herbicides (2, 4 -dichlorophenoxyacetic acid and 2, 4 -dichlorophenoxypropionic acid), and a putative new catabolic pathway. Intramolecular transposition of insertion sequences followed by deletion was found to contribute to the diversity of some of these plasmids. The previous observation that the insertion sites of a Tn 501 -related element are identical in four IncP- 1 β plasmids (pJP 4, pB 10, R 906, and R 772) was further extended to three more IncP- 1 β plasmids (pAKD 15, pAKD 18, and pAKD 29). We proposed a hypothesis for the evolution of these Tn 501 -bearing IncP- 1 β plasmids that predicts recent diversification followed by worldwide spread. Our study increases the available collection of complete IncP- 1 plasmid genome sequences by 50 % and will aid future studies to enhance our understanding of the evolution and function of this important plasmid family...|$|R

40|$|The methanotrophs Methylococcus capsulatus (Bath) and Methylosinus trichosporium OB 3 b contain {{particulate}} methane monooxygenase (pMMO) and soluble methane monooxygenase (sMMO) genes. Other methanotrophs such as Methylomicrobium album BG 8 and Methylocystis parvus OBBP contain only pMMO genes. Although molecular genetic {{techniques are}} poorly developed in methanotrophs, sMMO genes were expressed in methanotrophs normally containing only pMMO genes. This {{was achieved by}} conjugation using <b>broad-host-range</b> <b>plasmids</b> containing the native promoter and sMMO genes from Me, capsulatus (Bath) and Ms. trichosporium OB 3 b, sMMO genes derived from Ms. trichosporium OB 3 b were expressed in an active form in Mcy. parvus OBBP and in Mm. album BG 8. Therefore, all of the genes required for active sMMO synthesis were contained on the <b>broad-host-range</b> <b>plasmids</b> and were expressed in the heterologous hosts. Constitutive synthesis of pMMO was observed in Mm. album BG 8 when grown at high and low copper-to-biomass ratios, while transcription of the recombinant sMMO genes was only observed under growth conditions of low copper-to-biomass ratios. Therefore, the regulatory protein(s) for sMMO synthesis was also present on the plasmid used, or the heterologous host contained a regulatory system for sMMO. Expression of sMMO genes in methanotrophs containing only pMMO will assist further investigations on the expression and regulation of MMO genes in methanotrophs...|$|R

40|$|We {{constructed}} {{a series of}} transposon vectors which allow efficient in vitro gene manipulation and subsequent introduction of cloned DNA {{into a variety of}} gram-negative bacteria. Transfer of the cloned fragment from these multicopy <b>plasmids</b> into self-transmissible <b>broad-host-range</b> vectors is achieved in vivo, using the Tn 3 transposition mechanism. Transposition into a variety of <b>broad-host-range</b> <b>plasmids</b> proceeds efficiently, and the resulting recombinant plasmids can be readily transferred and maintained in a variety of gram-negative bacteria.

Recombinant plasmids having a ColEl type origin were linked to the RP 4 derivative. Cointegrate formation appeared to take place by RecA-independent, homologous recombination within a short piece of DNA derived from the P-lactamase gene of TnllTn 3 carried by both vector components, so that it never disrupted the recombinant portion of the construction. pNJ 5000 provides an unstable intermediate vector for use in marker exchange experiments, while its stable relative pNJ 1020 provides a carrier for use in binary vector systems...|$|R
40|$|A cryIA(c) gene was cloned from {{a native}} Bacillus thuringiensis strain showing {{activity}} against the sugarcane borer, Eldana saccharina.

40|$|IncU {{plasmids}} are {{a distinctive}} group of mobile elements with highly conserved backbone functions and variable antibiotic resistance gene cassettes. The IncU archetype is conjugative plasmid RA 3, whose sequence (45, 909 bp) shows {{it to be}} a mosaic, modular replicon with a class I integron different from that of other IncU replicons. Functional analysis demonstrated that RA 3 possesses a broad host range and can efficiently self-transfer, replicate, and be maintained stably in alpha-, beta-, and gammaproteobacteria. RA 3 contains 50 open reading frames clustered in distinct functional modules. The replication module encompasses the repA and repB genes embedded in long repetitive sequences. RepA, which is homologous to antitoxin proteins from alpha- and gammaproteobacteria, contains a Cro/cI-type DNA-binding domain present in the XRE family of transcriptional regulators. The repA promoter is repressed by RepA and RepB. The minireplicon encompasses repB and the downstream repetitive sequence r 1 /r 2. RepB shows up to 80 % similarity to putative replication initiation proteins from environmental plasmids of beta- and gammaproteobacteria, as well as similarity to replication proteins from alphaproteobacteria and Firmicutes. Stable maintenance functions of RA 3 are most like those of IncP- 1 <b>broad-host-range</b> <b>plasmids</b> and comprise the active partitioning apparatus formed by IncC (ParA) and KorB (ParB), the antirestriction protein KlcA, and accessory stability components KfrA and KfrC.
