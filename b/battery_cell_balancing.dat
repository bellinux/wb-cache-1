40|$|International audienceAs {{opposed to}} the first battery {{technologies}} (Pb, Ni-Mh…), whose protection and management required simple electronic circuits, today's Li-ion batteries need to be precisely supervised during all their working cycles to limit their charges and discharges, to ensure their security and improve their lifetime. Battery management is currently performed by monitoring <b>battery</b> <b>cell</b> voltages: charging is interrupted when the voltage of the first cell of the serial arrangement exceeds a threshold value (charging then goes forward with a lower current for the remaining <b>cells).</b> <b>Battery</b> discharge is managed similarly and is interrupted when the voltage of first <b>battery</b> <b>cell</b> falls below a threshold value. The remaining energy in the other cells of the serial arrangement is not used. Hence, the energy stored into the battery is not fully exploited, which limits {{the autonomy of the}} supplied system. Non-dissipative solutions to exchange energy between cells so as to maintain the <b>cells</b> <b>balanced</b> have been reported; yet, they require a large number of DC/DC converters with associated size, weight and price drawbacks. To overcome these limitations and to remove the battery charger and output converter (DC/DC or DC/AC converter to supply the load), we propose a full converter based on <b>battery</b> <b>cell</b> switching, to adjust the battery pack output voltage to the effective need in real time and maintain the <b>battery</b> <b>cells</b> <b>balanced.</b> The architecture we developed consists in connecting or disconnecting in real time each cell placed in the serial arrangement. In the case of an electrical vehicle with 30 kWh on board, by using <b>battery</b> <b>cells</b> of 3. 3 V, the output voltage can be adjusted by steps of 3. 3 V from- 60 V to + 60 V. We show {{that it is possible to}} directly drive a three-phase electric motor with an efficiency up to 98 % from few Hz to 400 Hz, while maintaining the <b>cells</b> <b>balanced.</b> Moreover, this is achieved with a transistor cost lower than 300 € (consumer prices, expectedly 10 times lower for large quantities). For the transistor driving part, a distributed electronic is placed in front of each cell of the serial arrangement. Each distributed electronic circuit is able to drive up to 14 transistors, to carry out local measurements (temperature, current, voltage) and to calculate the estimated State of Charge of the local cell. Distributed electronic circuits communicate with an electronic advisor by using galvanically isolated a common serial communication bus.

A switching matrix provides controlled access to individual cells and an extra <b>cell</b> in the <b>battery</b> string provides redundancy.

40|$|Abstract—Conventional battery {{management}} systems (BMSs) for electric vehicles (EVs) are designed {{in an ad}} hoc way, causing the supply of EVs to fall behind the market demand. A well-designed and combined hardware-software architecture {{is essential for the}} efficient management of a large-scale battery pack that may consists of thousands of <b>battery</b> <b>cells</b> as in Tesla Motors and GM Chevy Volt. We propose a Dependable, Efficient, Scalable Architecture (DESA) that effectively monitors a large number of <b>battery</b> <b>cells,</b> efficiently controls, and reconfigures, if needed, their connection arrangement. DESA supports hierarchical, autonomous management of <b>battery</b> <b>cells,</b> where a global BMS orchestrates a group of local BMSs. A local controller on each local BMS autonomously manages an array of <b>battery</b> <b>cells,</b> and the global controller reconfigures the connectivity of such battery-cell arrays in coordination with the local controllers. Also, DESA allows individual arrays and local BMSs to be selectively powered-off for energy savings. The performance of this energy-saving capability is modeled and evaluated using a Markov chain. Our evaluation results show that DESA effectively tolerates battery-cell failures by an order-of-magnitude—while achieving service cost savings—better than a conventional BMS.
