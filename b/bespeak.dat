5|$|Above all, {{he possessed}} a {{resolute}} decision of character, which, however unfortunately {{it may have}} operated under different conditions, appeared to extraordinary advantage at the crisis of continental thrones. Bewildered by the revolutionary din, and oscillating ignominiously between fear and rage, resistance and concession, the clique of crowned heads suffered greatly by contrast with a Sovereign who at least knew his own mind, and was prepared to abide by his opinions. In the European convulsions, therefore, King Ernest maintained the stability of his throne and the tranquillity of his people without damage from revolution or reaction. As Kings, indeed, are computed on the continent, he was an able and even a popular Monarch, and his memory may find, perhaps, in his ancestral dominions a sympathy which it would be vain to <b>bespeak</b> {{for it in the}} scenes of his manhood or the land of his birth.|$|E
25|$|Like {{those of}} his contemporaries Aleksa Šantić, Vladimir Ćorović and Jovan Dučić, Kočić's {{writings}} were greatly influenced by the Nemanjid-Byzantine literary tradition, which was mainly taken up by Serb writers, and primarily dealt with themes from Serbian history, such as the medieval Serbian Empire and the Battle of Kosovo. His stories all <b>bespeak</b> {{the social and political}} beliefs to which he adhered. His primary sources of inspiration were Serbian epic poetry and Njegoš's Gorski vijenac (The Mountain Wreath; 1847). Kočić's works were written in his native Ijekavian dialect, primarily spoken west of the Drina.|$|E
25|$|What {{seemed a}} mass {{movement}} toward practicality and specialization that would drain {{the university of}} the aestheticism and humanism frustrated {{the young men who}} would eventually found the Monthly; each was involved with {{one or more of the}} other Harvard literary publications—the Lampoon, the Advocate, and the Crimson, which didn't offer the creative outlet they felt necessary. Toward the end of their junior year, W.W. Baldwin and T.P. Sanborn brainstormed in the latter's room in Grays Hall, proceeding to A.B. Houghton's room in Holyoke and, after gathering W.M. Fullerton and G.R. Carpenter, assembling in Santayana's room in Hollis Hall, where they agreed to move forward with a plan for a true literary magazine. They vowed their work would not <b>bespeak</b> the scrupulous consciousness of John Bunyan's Puritan Pilgrim, but rather the doubting scrutiny of William Dean Howells' Silas Lapham who, in Howells’ story, prevails over the empty, hypocritical norms of proper Boston society.|$|E

500|$|Critical {{reception}} of Blue Gardenia was positive overall. Jonathan Widran wrote a positive review for the album, complimenting Walton's arrangements and the featured soloists. Widran {{also said that}} each track allowed James to [...] "explore both tenderness and guttural emotions" [...] and that James' mother's contributions to the title track provided a [...] "unique touch that [...] emotional dimension to an already emotionally rich affair". Music critic Robert Christgau awarded the album an [...] "A–" [...] rating and wrote that James [...] " [...] the songs do the talking and [...] you to wonder whether her modest melodic variations <b>bespeak</b> sly musicality or weathered pipes." [...] Isaac Guzman of the New York Daily News thought that the album showcased James' ability to [...] "get inside the gentle nuances of classic torch songs and ballads". Dorothy Hill noted the blues sound of the album and the [...] "ache" [...] in James' voice. She complimented the performances by the guest musicians appearing on the album, including Hawkins, whose vocal contribution Hill called [...] "unpolished but alluring".|$|E

2500|$|Contemporary philosopher Bernard Rollin {{writes that}} [...] "{{dominion}} does not entail or allow abuse {{any more than}} does dominion a parent enjoys over a child." [...] Rollin further states that the Biblical Sabbath requirement promulgated in the Ten Commandments [...] "required that animals be granted a day of rest along with humans. Correlatively, the Bible forbids 'plowing with an ox and an ass together' (Deut. 22:10–11). According to the rabbinical tradition, this prohibition stems from the hardship that an ass would suffer by being compelled {{to keep up with}} an ox, which is, of course, far more powerful. Similarly, one finds the prohibition against 'muzzling an ox when it treads out the grain' (Deut. 25:4–5), and even an environmental prohibition against destroying trees when besieging a city (Deut. 20:19–20). These ancient regulations, virtually forgotten, <b>bespeak</b> of an eloquent awareness of the status of animals as ends in themselves", a point also corroborated by Norm Phelps.|$|E
2500|$|The way {{in which}} the Niggerati thought that FIRE!! was {{received}} reveals much about their intent in publishing it. [...] Hughes wrote in The Big Sea that [...] "None of the older Negro intellectuals would {{have anything to do with}} FIRE. [...] Dr. Du Bois in Crisis roasted it.". [...] In fact, Du Bois did no such thing. [...] The only mention that FIRE!! received was a brief announcement in the January 1927 issue, calling it [...] "a beautiful piece of printing" [...] that was [...] "strikingly illustrated by Aaron Douglas" [...] and concluding [...] "We <b>bespeak</b> for it wide support.". [...] Huges thought that Du Bois panned FIRE!! because he expected him to pan it, that being the reaction that he and the other Niggerati had intended to elicit. [...] Nugent reported that once all initial submissions had been made, Thurman had asked the group for something that would get the journal banned in Boston, which led to the inclusion of Cordelia the Crude and Smoke, Lilies and Jade.|$|E

2500|$|More recently, the J. Edgar Hoover Building {{has been}} {{strongly}} criticized for its aesthetics and {{impact on the}} urban life in the city. In 2005, D.C. architect Arthur Cotton Moore harshly condemned the building for creating a dead space {{in the heart of}} the nation's capital. [...] "It creates a void along Pennsylvania Avenue. Given its elephantine size and harshness, it creates a black hole. Its concrete wall, with no windows or life to it, is an urban sin. People should be strolling down America's main street. Nobody strolls in front of the FBI Building." [...] The following year, Gerard Moeller and Christopher Weeks wrote in the AIA Guide to the Architecture of Washington, D.C. that the FBI building was the [...] "swaggering bully of the neighborhood...ungainly, ill-mannered..." [...] They also blamed the structure's poor design for undermining the redevelopment of Pennsylvania Avenue: [...] "the impenetrable base, the shadowy courtyard, and looming upper stories <b>bespeak</b> security and surveillance. The prototype for the Pennsylvania Avenue redevelopment plan devised under the direction of Nathanial Owings, it helped to ensure that the full plan would never be realized." [...] Five years later, in 2011, Washington City Paper reporter Lydia DePillis noted that the building has [...] "long been maligned as downtown D.C.'s ugliest edifice". Architecture for Dummies author Deborah K. Dietsch said in April 2012 that it was [...] "disastrous", [...] "insensitive", and [...] "hostile", and that it and the James V. Forrestal Building topped the list of the city's ugliest buildings. A list compiled by Trippy.com and Reuters declared the J. Edgar Hoover Building the world's ugliest building, and found it to be a [...] "dreary 1970s behemoth". Los Angeles Times travel writer Christopher Reynolds remarked that the Hoover building is [...] "so ugly, local historians say, that it scared authorities into setting higher standards for pedestrian friendliness among buildings along [...] ".|$|E
