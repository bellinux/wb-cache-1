He {{frequently}} comes out with a different plot and narration style, and [...] "Thuppaki is a brilliant example of this". Sify's critic stated that Murugadoss [...] "has made a complete entertainer that blends with Vijay's mass image, thanks to his racy script", calling it a [...] "perfect Diwali entertainer". Sangeetha Devi Dundoo of The Hindu commented: [...] "One of the first promos of the film, with snapshots of Mumbai, lurking terror, the antagonist threatening Vijay to which he responds 'I am waiting' went viral on social networks. The wait, clearly, has <b>been</b> <b>worth</b> <b>it</b> for the audience. And the man who's probably having the last laugh is Murugadoss". For the same newspaper, Karthik Subrmaniam wrote, [...] "One can only wonder just how much better Thuppakki would have been if it had done away with the song-and-dance-and-romance and such trappings." [...] Haricharan Pudipeddi of The New Indian Express said, [...] "Most of the characters are made to look dumb as Vijay steals all the attention. Kajal's role as a boxer, which she squanders with her cliched performance, is definitely a turn off in the film. Jayaram and Sathyan, who're supposed to make us laugh, fail miserably in the process" [...] and concluded, [...] "In essence, [...] "Thuppakki" [...] has the energy of Vijay and intellect of A.R. Murugadoss".|$|E

Rainie and Phil {{were to be}} involved in a storyline involving the taking of crack cocaine. Discussing her return in 2010, she said she was pleased to be working closely with McFadden as they had not worked together. Franks explained that after being thrown out of the house by Tanya's ex-husband Max, and moving in with Phil that, [...] "it gets quite dark and dirty, really. Phil and Rainie are two people who meet at a point in their lives where they both see something equivalent in each other. He offers her something that she wants, and that is a place to be, while she has something that he wants, and that's drugs—so it's a match at that time." [...] Franks was given advice from the charity DrugScope on how to act the part and also undertook some of her own research, and she said she believed the scenes to be very realistic. She wanted the drugs storyline to help people, saying, [...] "If {{there are people who have}} a drugs problem, or an addiction problem of any kind really, they might watch something like this and it could trigger something in their mind that is relevant to them, or someone that they know. Hopefully it could make people think twice about carrying on with that, and perhaps look into getting some help. The organisation that we worked with, DrugScope, gives a lot of help and advice for people with drug addictions. I think it can be hugely helpful when a show as popular as EastEnders does something like this." [...] She also stated that if EastEnders [...] "has saved one life by putting this story out it's <b>been</b> <b>worth</b> <b>it.</b> The whole point of soaps is to reflect a certain amount of everyday life. Some of it is going to be light entertainment, some isn't." ...|$|E

He enjoyed the silent, uneasy evenings which had supplanted those cheery ones of the first year of their marriage.

6000|$|He {{recognised}} Osmond, as I say; he recognised him {{at every}} turn. He saw how he kept all things within limits; how he adjusted, regulated, animated their manner of life. Osmond {{was in his}} element; at last he had material to work with. He always had an eye to effect, and his effects were deeply calculated. They were produced by no vulgar means, but the motive was as vulgar as the art was great. To surround his interior {{with a sort of}} invidious sanctity, to tantalise society with a sense of exclusion, to make people believe his house was different from every other, to impart to the face that he presented to the world a cold originality--this was the ingenious effort of the personage to whom Isabel had attributed a superior morality. [...] "He works with superior material," [...] Ralph said to himself; [...] "it's rich abundance compared with his former resources." [...] Ralph was a clever man; but Ralph had never--to his own sense--been so clever as when he observed, in petto, that under the guise of caring only for intrinsic values Osmond lived exclusively for the world. Far from being its master as he pretended to be, he was its very humble servant, and the degree of its attention was his only measure of success. He lived with his eye on it from morning till night, and the world was so stupid it never suspected the trick. Everything he did was pose--pose so subtly considered that if one were not on the lookout one mistook it for impulse. Ralph had never met a man who lived so much in the land of consideration. His tastes, his studies, his accomplishments, his collections, were all for a purpose. His life on his hill-top at Florence had been the conscious attitude of years. His solitude, his ennui, his love for his daughter, his good manners, his bad manners, were so many features of a mental image constantly present to him as a model of impertinence and mystification. His ambition was not to please the world, but to please himself by exciting the world's curiosity and then declining to satisfy it. It had made him feel great, ever, to play the world a trick. The thing he had done in his life most directly to please himself was his marrying Miss Archer; though in this case indeed the gullible world was in a manner embodied in poor Isabel, who had been mystified to the top of her bent. Ralph of course found a fitness in being consistent; he had embraced a creed, and as he had suffered for it he could not in honour forsake it. I give this little sketch of its articles for what they may at the time have <b>been</b> <b>worth.</b> <b>It</b> was certain that he was very skilful in fitting the facts to his theory--even the fact that during the month he spent in Rome at this period the husband of the woman he loved appeared to regard him not in the least as an enemy.|$|E
