5|$|After a final {{check of}} the weather reports for Germany and the North Sea, Hess took off at 17:45 on 10 May 1941 from the {{airfield}} at Augsburg-Haunstetten in his specially prepared aircraft. It was the last of several attempts to depart on his mission; previous efforts had to be called off due to mechanical problems or poor weather. Wearing a leather flying suit bearing the rank of captain, he <b>brought</b> <b>along</b> <b>a</b> supply of money and toiletries, a torch, a camera, maps and charts, and a collection of 28 different medicines, as well as dextrose tablets to help ward off fatigue and an assortment of homeopathic remedies.|$|E
5|$|In June 2007, vocalist Adam Lazzara said Taking Back Sunday were {{preparing}} to write the follow-up album to Louder Now (2006). In July, bassist Matthew Rubano mentioned that {{the other members of}} the band were in the process of writing individually in separate locations: Rubano in Manhattan, Lazzara in Texas, guitarist Fred Mascherino in Jersey, drummer Mark O'Connell on Long Island and guitarist Eddie Reyes in Ohio. From late July to early September, the band participated in the 2007 Projekt Revolution tour. During the tour, they <b>brought</b> <b>along</b> <b>a</b> mobile recording studio and demoed material, and continued writing for their next album. Plans to do serious writing, as well as record their next album towards the end of the year, were in place.|$|E
5|$|The dreaded North Vietnamese wet season {{offensive}} (Campaign Z) {{began on}} 17 December 1971. The multi-division offensive was commanded by Major General Le Trong Tan, who had commanded the PAVN counteroffensive against Operation Lam Son 719. Once again the communists rolled across the Plain of Jars {{and to the}} outskirts of Long Tieng. This time however, they had <b>brought</b> <b>along</b> <b>a</b> battery of 130mm artillery, which proceeded to pummel the defenders. By 17 January 1972, reinforcement by Unity troops and strikes by B-52s had driven the PAVN from the high ground surrounding the valley, but they could not be pushed out of the area. General Tan then shifted the focus of his forces to the southwest and seized Sam Thong on 18 March. The fighting around Long Tieng did not cease until 28 April.|$|E
25|$|Before {{the start}} of the season, {{assistant}} coach Paul Maurice was promoted to head coach, when Tom Webster was relieved of his duties after a disagreement in team policies. Maurice <b>brought</b> <b>along</b> <b>an</b> old teammate as his new assistant, close friend Peter DeBoer. The two played together with the Windsor Compuware Spitfires in the mid to late 1980s.|$|R
50|$|After {{finishing}} the raw edits of Alice's Wonderland, the studio filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in July 1923. Disney made some final money by shooting a 6-month-old girl named Kathalee Viley and sold his movie camera, earning {{enough money for}} a one-way train ticket, moving to Hollywood, California; he <b>brought</b> <b>along</b> <b>an</b> unfinished reel of Alice's Wonderland.|$|R
5000|$|In 1898, {{he was one}} of {{the artists}} sent to cover the {{campaign}} in Sudan which culminated at Battle of Omdurman. Villiers <b>brought</b> <b>along</b> <b>an</b> early cine-camera and was filming when an explosion caused the boat to rock in the Nile River, tipping over the apparatus. His other campaigns included the Boer War where he accompanied the Kimberley Relief Column.|$|R
25|$|On every trip he <b>brought</b> <b>along</b> <b>a</b> chair made {{of birch}} and rawride {{where he would}} sit as he {{negotiated}} his business, while everyone else sat on the ground. Though {{it has been said}} he was illiterate, he had an excellent memory and kept his business records in his head without ever making a single note. He could sign his name with a flourish, so one must wonder if he actually was illiterate, or perhaps just keeping his business to himself.|$|E
25|$|The first {{permanent}} European-American settler in the Grand Rapids {{area was}} Isaac McCoy, a Baptist minister. General Lewis Cass, who commissioned Charles Christopher Trowbridge to establish missions for Native Americans in Michigan, ordered McCoy {{to establish a}} mission in Grand Rapids for the Ottawa. In 1823, McCoy, as well as Paget, a Frenchman who <b>brought</b> <b>along</b> <b>a</b> Native American pupil, traveled to Grand Rapids to arrange a mission, though negotiations fell through with the group returning to the Carey mission for the Potawatomi on the St. Joseph River.|$|E
25|$|As Muhammad's son and {{designated}} heir Zayd {{was also}} captured {{and sent to}} Bukhara, the Zaydid leaders agreed to name Zayd's infant son al-Mahdi as their ruler, but dissension broke out among their ranks: one of them proclaimed himself for the Abbasids instead, and his troops attacked and massacred the Zaydid supporters. Instead, the Samanids took over the province. The Samanid conquest <b>brought</b> <b>along</b> <b>a</b> restoration of Sunni Islam in the province, but the Shi'a cause was upheld and spread among the Daylamites and Gilanites by another Alid, Hasan al-Utrush, who in 914 managed to conquer Tabaristan and restore Zaydid rule.|$|E
25|$|The Roman period <b>brought</b> <b>along</b> <b>an</b> {{influx of}} {{imported}} iron (and other) artifacts like Roman wine glasses and dippers {{as well as}} various coins of the Empire. During this period the (proto) Finnish culture stabilized on the coastal regions and larger graveyards become commonplace. The prosperity of the Finns rose to the level {{that the vast majority}} of gold treasures found within Finland date back to this period.|$|R
60|$|The temper of {{the other}} two girls was different. Beth De Graf had <b>brought</b> <b>along</b> <b>an</b> archery outfit, and she set up her target on the ample green the day {{following}} her arrival. Here she practiced persistently, shooting at sixty yards with much skill. But occasionally, when Louise tired of her novel and her cushions in the hammock, the two girls would play tennis or croquet together--Beth invariably winning.|$|R
60|$|Just {{then the}} dog Harold Bird had <b>brought</b> <b>along</b> set up <b>a</b> mournful howl.|$|R
25|$|His renown as an {{architect}} even reached the court of the Archduke Albert and Infanta Isabella, governors of the Southern Netherlands. In 1601 {{he was invited to}} Brussels to present himself at the court, arriving in September of that year. When his in-laws died in 1603, he had to return to Rome to settle family matters. On his return in 1604, he <b>brought</b> <b>along</b> <b>a</b> book from Cardinal Baronius for the printshop of Christoffel Plantijn. He settled in Antwerp where he was admitted as a master in the Guild of Saint Luke. In 1605 he was admitted in the Guild of Romanists.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} year there, they made friends with the 32 {{students}} who attended l'Academie des Beaux-Arts, located {{at the end of}} their street. The students invited Harry and Polly to their annual Quartre Arts Ball, an invitation the couple embraced with enthusiasm. Harry fashioned a necklace of four dead pigeons, sported a red loincloth, and <b>brought</b> <b>along</b> <b>a</b> bag of snakes. Caresse wore a sheer chemise to her waist, a huge turquoise wig on her head, and nothing else. They both dyed their skin with red ochre. The students cheered Caresse's toplessness, and she was carried around on the shoulders of 10 students.|$|E
25|$|Webb {{was born}} in Detroit in 1905 and grew up there and in a Quaker {{community}} in Ontario. From 19241929 {{he worked as a}} bank teller and clerk at a brokerage firm in Detroit; in another account, he was a successful stockbroker during the 1920s but lost his earnings during the Crash before the Depression. During the Depression beginning in 1929, he moved to California and worked as a prospector and earned a meager living. During these years he also worked as a fire ranger for the United States Forestry Service. Webb reportedly wrote short stories which were unpublished. After 1934, Webb returned to Detroit and worked for the automobile manufacturer Chrysler in their export division. In 1937, he visited a friend in Panama in search of gold, but had little success. But in Panama, he <b>brought</b> <b>along</b> <b>a</b> camera donated by his former employer, Chrysler.|$|E
500|$|In 1997, while {{pitching}} {{the cartoon}} to executives at Nickelodeon, Hillenburg donned <b>a</b> Hawaiian shirt, <b>brought</b> <b>along</b> <b>an</b> [...] "underwater terrarium with {{models of the}} characters", and played Hawaiian music to set the theme. The setup was described by Nickelodeon executive Eric Coleman as [...] "pretty amazing". Although Derek Drymon, creative director of SpongeBob SquarePants, described the pitch as stressful, he said it went [...] "very well". Nickelodeon approved and gave Hillenburg money to produce the show.|$|R
60|$|Soon a {{fire was}} blazing merrily. They built {{it under the}} outer {{end of a long}} tree limb, and from the limb {{suspended}} a pot full of water by a long iron chain they had <b>brought</b> <b>along.</b> <b>As</b> the ground was covered with snow, there was little danger of spreading a conflagration. Soon the water was boiling and the guide made a steaming pot of coffee, which was passed around in tin cups, with sugar and a little condensed milk. They had <b>brought</b> <b>along</b> bread, cheese, chipped beef, and boiled eggs, and also a mince pie which Mrs. Barrow had baked the day before, and these made what Tom declared was a famous dinner.|$|R
60|$|Once more, they {{unpacked}} {{the provisions}} they had <b>brought</b> <b>along</b> and made <b>a</b> leisurely break-fast. Then they packed their things again and waited.|$|R
25|$|Mujāhid {{returned}} to Sardinia in 1016 intending {{a more thorough}} conquest of the island. To this end he <b>brought</b> <b>along</b> <b>a</b> reported thousand horses from the Balearics. On these islands, which were renowned for their horses and mules, Mujāhid had reformed the tax system and put the stables {{at the service of}} the government in preparation for his expedition. He arrived off Sardinia with a large fleet and a landing force capable of a rapid conquest. The local Sardinian ruler, Salusio, the judge of Cagliari, was killed in the fighting and the organised resistance broke down. His troops may have met up with garrisons that had remained on the island after the failed expedition of 1015. He also established a beachhead at Luni, on the coast between Genoa and Pisa, according to the eleventh-century German chronicler and bishop Thietmar of Merseburg (Thitmarus), who mis-dates the event to 1015. Luni was reportedly taken by surprise, but the citizens and the bishop managed to flee. Both town and countryside were pillaged without resistance.|$|E
500|$|Businessman and {{politician}} Boris Berezovsky said in {{a police}} interview that [...] "Sasha mentioned some person who he met at Millennium Hotel", but would not [...] "remember whether [...] was Vladimir or Vyacheslav."

500|$|During {{the atomic}} bombing of Hiroshima, on August 6, 1945, Agnew, along with Alvarez and Johnston, flew as a {{scientific}} observer in The Great Artiste, piloted by Charles Sweeney, which tailed the Enola Gay as the instrumentation aircraft. [...] Agnew later recalled, [...] "After we dropped our gauges I remember we made a sharp turn to the right {{so that we would}} not get caught in the blast – but we still got badly shaken up by it." [...] He <b>brought</b> <b>along</b> <b>a</b> movie camera and took the only existing movies of the Hiroshima event as seen from the air.|$|E
60|$|Breakfast was {{certainly}} a slim affair, each person getting a small bite of duck, two crackers, a spoonful of cold beans Shep had <b>brought</b> <b>along,</b> and <b>a</b> drink of melted snow. Several gazed wistfully at the rabbit, but Snap {{shook his head at}} them.|$|R
5000|$|Sleep was {{friendly}} with theatre critic Jack Tinker; {{the two men}} were often mistaken for each other. At the premiere of a production of The Comedy of Errors, a play which depends on sets of identical twins being confused for one another, Tinker <b>brought</b> <b>along</b> <b>an</b> identically dressed Sleep as his companion. At Tinker's memorial celebration, a pastiche of Stephen Sondheim's musical Sweeney Todd was staged entitled [...] "Tinker Jack, the Demon Critic of Fleet Street" [...] in which Sleep played Tinker, serially executing several major West End producers (who played themselves) for inflicting particular dramatic atrocities upon the city's theatregoers.|$|R
5000|$|... “We {{met in a}} studio, and I <b>brought</b> <b>along</b> <b>an</b> old pair of my tap shoes. I said 'This is how {{you play}} cascara {{on the side of}} the drum. This is how you do it with your feet.' He was {{immediately}} able to reproduce what I was doing," [...] Pollak reflects. [...] "I thought, 'If this guy can learn the basic gist of tap dancing so fast, this is worth my energy.' I taught him for a couple of hours, and then told him 'Keep the shoes.'" [...] A couple months later they met up in New York and Ramos performed a [...] "mindblowing" [...] tap solo on stage.|$|R
500|$|The musical {{was well}} {{received}} by most critics. In his review for The Sentinel, Chris Blackhurst <b>brought</b> <b>along</b> <b>a</b> seven-year-old child called Dylan Brayford, and his 34-year-old godfather, James Humphreys, from Nantwich {{to watch the}} musical. The two [...] "weren't disappointed." [...] Blackhurst said [...] "The fast-paced tale of courage and dreams kept both entertained with plenty of hilarious moments {{for the children and}} a sprinkle of gags which flew over younger fans' heads but brought a wry smile to mums and dads' faces." [...] Brayford summed it up, saying [...] "It was good, but not quite as good as the TV show." ...|$|E
500|$|Polonius tells Claudius and Gertrude {{his theory}} {{regarding}} Hamlet's behavior, and speaks to Hamlet in a {{hall of the}} castle to try to uncover more information. Hamlet feigns madness but subtly insults Polonius all the while. When Rosencrantz and Guildenstern arrive, Hamlet greets his [...] "friends" [...] warmly, but quickly discerns that they are spies. Hamlet becomes bitter, admitting that he is upset at his situation but refusing to give the true reason why, instead commenting on [...] "what a piece of work" [...] humanity is. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern tell Hamlet that they have <b>brought</b> <b>along</b> <b>a</b> troupe of actors that they met while traveling to Elsinore. Hamlet, after welcoming the actors and dismissing his friends-turned-spies, plots to stage a play featuring {{a death in the}} style of his father's murder, thereby determining the truth of the ghost's story, as well as Claudius's guilt or innocence, by studying Claudius's reaction.|$|E
500|$|Sternberg, still {{prospecting}} for Cope that spring, was woken by a liveryman who relayed {{word from}} Annie that Cope had died three days earlier. Sternberg {{wrote in his}} memoirs, [...] "I had lost friends before, and I had known {{what it was to}} bury my own dead, even my firstborn son, but I had never sorrowed more deeply than I did over the news." [...] Cope's Quaker funeral consisted of six men: Osborn, his colleague William Berryman Scott, Cope's friend Persifor Frazer, son-in-law Collins, Horatio Wood, and Harrison Allen. The six sat around Cope's coffin among the fossils and Cope's pets, a tortoise and a Gila monster, for what Osborn called [...] "a perfect Quaker silence... an interminable length of time." [...] Anticipating the quiet, Osborn had <b>brought</b> <b>along</b> <b>a</b> Bible and read an excerpt from the Book of Job, ending by saying, [...] "These are the problems to which our friend devoted his life." ...|$|E
60|$|Brushwood was handy, and Tom {{helped to}} cut {{some of this}} with the hunting knife he had <b>brought</b> <b>along.</b> Soon <b>a</b> lively blaze was warming them up, and water was boiling for the coffee, while the rabbit was cleaned, and broiled on a long fork in the guide's outfit. Crackers were running low, and they had but two apiece.|$|R
5|$|In {{the early}} 1930s, Lee learned that Venerable Tao Chiai wanted {{to restore a}} {{dilapidated}} Chinese temple in Sarnath (the deer park where the Buddha gave his first sermon after his enlightenment) that a Chinese emperor of the Tang Dynasty built in the 8th century AD. Venerable Tao Chiai died before he could accomplish this task; however, his chief disciple, Venerable Teh Yue, continued the restoration project, which Lee personally funded. Lee went {{on a pilgrimage to}} India with Venerable Teh Yue and <b>brought</b> <b>along</b> <b>an</b> English engineer, A. H. King, to assess and assist the restoration works. This temple still stands today in Sarnath and is called simply The Chinese Temple in Sarnath.|$|R
6000|$|Honora {{took the}} eleven o'clock train, which {{gave her an}} hour after she arrived in New York to do as she pleased. Her first idea, as she {{stood for a moment}} amidst the clamour of the traffic in front of the ferry house, was to call on Mrs. Holt at that lady's hotel; and then she remembered that the Charities Conference began at eleven, and decided to pay a visit to Madame Dumond, who made a {{specialty}} of importing novelties in dress. Her costume for the prospective excursion in the automobile had cost Honora some thought that morning. As the day was cool, she had <b>brought</b> <b>along</b> <b>an</b> ulster that was irreproachable. But how about the hat and veil? ...|$|R
2500|$|In 1935, Himmler {{contacted}} a Finnish nobleman and author, Yrjö von Grönhagen, {{after seeing}} {{one of his}} articles about the Kalevala folklore in a Frankfurt newspaper. Grönhagen agreed to lead an expedition through the Karelia region of Finland to record pagan sorcerers and witches. Because there was uncertainty about whether the Karelians would allow photography, the Finnish illustrator Ola Forsell also accompanied the team. Musicologist [...] <b>brought</b> <b>along</b> <b>a</b> magnetophon, hoping to record pagan chants.|$|E
2500|$|In [...] 1918, the servility {{towards the}} presidents {{was at its}} peak and the {{university}} was renamed [...] "University of Guatemala, Estrada Cabrera", by decree of the National Assembly on 2 May 1918. Francisco Galvez Portocarrero, close friend of the president, lobbied heavily for the new university given that in {{a recent trip to}} Perú, Argentina and Chile he liked the model the universities followed in those South American countries. Upon returning to Guatemala, Galvez - who was also a National Assembly representative- <b>brought</b> <b>along</b> <b>a</b> complete library about universities and convinced both the president and the Assembly members to create the [...] "University of Guatemala".|$|E

Patch was quoted as saying: [...] "I was a bit {{doubtful}} before meeting a German soldier. Herr Kuentz is a very nice gentleman however. He is all for a united Europe and peace– and so am I".
