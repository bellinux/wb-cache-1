40|$|This {{research}} aims to {{test the}} mediating role of both affective and cognitive satisfaction {{on the effect of}} service quality on loyalty. The affective satisfaction is represented by Kansei Engineering-based measures and the cognitive satisfaction is represented by overall customer satisfaction. The study is based on survey through personal interviewing and face-to-face questionnaire. There were 102 respondents from 24 hotels ranging from three-star to five-star hotels in Surabaya, Indonesia. There are four latent variables, namely, service quality, overall customer satisfaction, Kansei, and loyalty. The relationships among the constructs are modeled via structural equation modeling. The mediation analysis is carried out using <b>bias-corrected</b> <b>bootstrap</b> <b>sampling.</b> We found that both overall customer satisfaction and Kansei partially mediate the relationship between service quality and loyalty (approximately 52 % mediation effects). In particular, the two mediators, namely, Kansei and overall customer satisfaction accounts for 24 % and 28 % of the effect of service quality on loyalty, respectively. Additionally, we failed to find a statistically significant relationship between Kansei and overall customer satisfaction. This might be due to relatively low sample size. The generalization of the results from the study is limited because of the relatively small sample size. Furthermore, the study was carried out in a single service setting, that is, hotel services. Affective satisfaction is equally important as cognitive satisfaction in service encounter. Both are shown to have significant mediating effects on the relationship between service quality and loyalty. To create higher loyalty, service provider should therefore not overlook the importance of both affective and cognitive satisfaction. This research complements the previous research by taking into account both cognitive and affective satisfaction as mediators at the same time. It is shown that the two-mediator model fits the data better than that of using one mediator or no mediator...|$|R

The indirect effect[*]=[*] 0.06, SE[*]=[*] 0.02, <b>bias-corrected</b> <b>bootstrap</b> 95 % CI (0.01, 0.10; excluding zero). The conditional indirect effects were examined at three different levels of perceived over-qualification, including low perceived over-qualification (1 SD below the mean), average perceived over-qualification and high perceived over-qualification (1 SD above the mean) while controlling for gender, tenure, and education. The indirect effect of transformational leadership has a significant association with voice via positive affect for participants with high and average perceived over-qualification. Specifically, when the perceived over-qualification is high, the indirect effect[*]=[*] 0.09, SE[*]=[*] 0.03, and <b>bias-corrected</b> <b>bootstrap</b> 95 % CI[*]=[*](0.03, 0.15 : excluding zero).

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with statistical inference for the coefficient of the linear regression model when the error term follows an autoregressive (AR) model. Past studies have reported severe size distortions, when the data are trending and autocorrelation of the error term is high. In this paper, we consider a test based on the <b>bias-corrected</b> <b>bootstrap,</b> where <b>bias-corrected</b> parameter estimators for the AR and regression coefficients are used. For bias-correction, the jackknife and bootstrap methods are employed. Monte Carlo simulations are conducted to compare size and power properties of the <b>bias-corrected</b> <b>bootstrap</b> test. It is found that the <b>bias-corrected</b> <b>bootstrap</b> test shows substantially improved size properties and exhibits excellent power for most of cases considered. It also appears that bootstrap bias-correction leads to better size and higher power values than jackknife bias-correction.

The backward VAR model {{is used to}} bootstrap VAR forecasts conditionally on past observations. Bootstrap prediction regions based on asymptotic bias-correction are compared with those based on bootstrap bias-correction. Monte Carlo simulation results indicate that bootstrap prediction regions based on asymptotic bias-correction show better small sample properties than those based on bootstrap bias-correction for nearly all cases considered. The former provide accurate coverage properties in most cases, while the latter over-estimate the future uncertainty. Overall, the percentile-t bootstrap prediction region based on asymptotic bias-correction is found to provide highly desirable small sample properties, outperforming its alternatives in nearly all cases.

40|$|The {{half-life}} {{is defined}} as the number of periods required for the impulse response to a unit shock to a time series to dissipate by half. It is widely used as a measure of persistence, especially in international economics to quantify the degree of mean reversion of the deviation from an international parity condition. Several studies have proposed bias-corrected point and interval estimation methods. However, they have found that the confidence intervals are rather uninformative with their upper bound being either extremely large or infinite. This is largely due to the distribution of the half-life estimator being heavily skewed and multi-modal. In this paper, we propose a <b>bias-corrected</b> <b>bootstrap</b> procedure for the estimation of half-life, adopting the highest density region (HDR) approach to point and interval estimation. Our Monte Carlo simulation results reveal that the <b>bias-corrected</b> <b>bootstrap</b> HDR method provides an accurate point estimator, as well as tight confidence intervals with superior coverage properties to those of its alternatives. As an application, the proposed method is employed for half-life estimation of the real exchange rates of seventeen industrialized countries. The results indicate much faster rates of mean-reversion than those reported in previous studies.

40|$|Objectives: Identification of pathway effects {{responsible}} for specific diseases {{has been one}} of the essential tasks in systems epidemiology. Despite some advance in procedures for distinguishing specific pathway (or network) topology between different disease status, statistical inference at a population level remains unsolved and further development is still needed. To identify the specific pathways contributing to diseases, we attempt to develop powerful statistics which can capture the complex relationship among risk factors. Setting and participants: Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) data obtained from 133 adults (98 patients and 35 controls; 47 % female). Results: Simulation studies indicated that the proposed Pathway Effect Measures (PEM) were stable; bootstrap-based methods outperformed the others, with <b>bias-corrected</b> <b>bootstrap</b> CI method having the highest power. Application to real data of AML successfully identified the specific pathway (Treg -> TGF beta -> Th 17) effect contributing to AML with p values less than 0. 05 under various methods and the <b>bias-corrected</b> <b>bootstrap</b> CI (- 0. 214 to - 0. 020). It demonstrated that Th 17 -Treg correlation balance was impaired in patients with AML, suggesting that Th 17 -Treg imbalance potentially plays a role in the pathogenesis of AML. Conclusions: The proposed bootstrap-based PEM are valid and powerful for detecting the specific pathway effect contributing to disease, thus potentially providing new insight into the underlying mechanisms and ways to study the disease effects of specific pathways more comprehensively...|$|R

Denote the demeaned observations by ˜ Xt = Xt − T − 1 ∑ T i= 1 Xi, and let B denote the number of <b>bootstrap</b> <b>samples.</b> The algorithm for mean bias correction using the bootstrap is as follows: 1. Estimate the model by OLS and save the OLS estimates ˆ θ = vec (ˆ Φ) and the residuals. Set b = 1. 2. Generate <b>bootstrap</b> <b>sample</b> b using the residual bootstrap: Resample the OLS residuals,. Randomly choose a starting value among the T denoting the bootstrap residuals by u ∗ t observations. For t> 1, construct the <b>bootstrap</b> <b>sample</b> using ˜ X ∗ t = ˆ Φ ˜ X ∗ t− 1 +u∗t. 3. Calculate the OLS estimates on <b>bootstrap</b> <b>sample</b> b and denote it by ˆ θ ∗ b. 4. If b < B then increase b by one and return to step two. 5. Calculate the average over all samples as ¯ θ ∗ = B − 1 ∑ B b= 1 ˆ θ ∗ b. 6. Calculate the <b>bootstrap</b> <b>bias-corrected</b> estimate as ˜θ B = ˆ [] θ − ¯θ ∗ −θ ˆ = 2 ˆ θ − ¯ θ ∗. For large B, the estimated bias ¯ θ ∗ − ˆ θ will be close to bT (ˆ θ). The motivation for this approach {{comes from the fact}} that E(bT (ˆ θT)) = bT(θ 0) +O(T − 2), thus we can reduce the bias to order T − 2 by using this bias correction (Horowitz, 2001) ...|$|R

We drew 1, 000 <b>bootstrap</b> <b>samples</b> from a dataset consisting of 4, 911 patients admitted to hospital with an AMI. Using each <b>bootstrap</b> <b>sample,</b> logistic regression models predicting 30 -day mortality were obtained using backward elimination, forward selection, and stepwise selection. The agreement between the different model selection methods and the agreement across the 1, 000 <b>bootstrap</b> <b>samples</b> were compared. Results: Using 1, 000 <b>bootstrap</b> <b>samples,</b> backward elimination identified 940 unique models for predicting mortality. Similar results were obtained for forward and stepwise selection. Three variables were identified as independent predictors of mortality among all <b>bootstrap</b> <b>samples.</b> Over half the candidate prognostic variables were identified as independent predictors in less than half of the <b>bootstrap</b> <b>samples.</b> Conclusion: Automated variable selection methods result in models that are unstable and not reproducible.
