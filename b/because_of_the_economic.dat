5|$|<b>Because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>economic</b> background, {{large-scale}} {{systems are}} presently distributed where the support regimes {{have been the}} most consistent, or the most advantageous. Total capacity of worldwide PV plants above 4 MWAC was assessed by Wiki-Solar as 36 GW in c. 2,300 installations at the end of 2014 and represents about 25 percent of total global PV capacity of 139GW. The countries which had the most capacity, in descending order, were the United States, China, Germany, India, United Kingdom, Spain, Italy, Canada and South Africa.

5|$|A gold dollar coin {{had been}} {{proposed}} {{several times in}} the 1830s and 1840s, but was not initially adopted. Congress was finally galvanized into action by the increased supply of bullion caused by the California gold rush, and in 1849 authorized a gold dollar. In its early years, silver coins were being hoarded or exported, and the gold dollar found a ready place in commerce. Silver again circulated after Congress in 1853 required that new coins of that metal be made lighter, and the gold dollar became a rarity in commerce even before federal coins vanished from circulation <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>economic</b> disruption caused by the American Civil War.|$|E
5|$|<b>Because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>economic</b> {{benefits}} of good telecommunication infrastructure, {{there is increasing}} worry about the inequitable access to telecommunication services amongst various countries of the world—this {{is known as the}} digital divide. A 2003 survey by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) revealed that roughly a third of countries have fewer than one mobile subscription for every 20 people and one-third of countries have fewer than one land-line telephone subscription for every 20 people. In terms of Internet access, roughly half of all countries have fewer than one out of 20 people with Internet access. From this information, as well as educational data, the ITU was able to compile an index that measures the overall ability of citizens to access and use information and communication technologies. Using this measure, Sweden, Denmark and Iceland received the highest ranking while the African countries Nigeria, Burkina Faso and Mali received the lowest.|$|E
25|$|On 5 December 2008 Honda {{announced}} that they were quitting F1, <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>economic</b> crisis. This led to months of uncertainty as to whether a buyer could be found, and whether they would retain Barrichello.|$|E

25|$|The {{reintroduction}} of {{the gold}} standard in 1925 by Winston Churchill, which made the British pound too strong for effective exporting to take place from Britain and (<b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>economic</b> processes involved in maintaining a strong currency) raised interest rates, hurting some businesses.|$|E
25|$|<b>Because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>economic</b> {{decline from}} the end of the 17th until the middle of the 19th century, much of the 16th- and 17th-century city centre is still intact.

25|$|<b>Because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>economic</b> climate, {{demand for}} {{electricity}} dropped {{significantly in the}} early 1980s, which led to structural changes at Hydro-Québec.

It was also given the mandate to export power and to work in any energy-related field.|$|E

50|$|<b>Because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{difficult}} <b>economic</b> climate then existing, only 20 A-1 Argos were completed.

25|$|RDU's post-hub {{years have}} brought the {{addition}} of several new carriers (notably Southwest Airlines and new destinations). <b>Because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>economic</b> downturn and high fuel prices in 2008, American ended the flights to Jacksonville, Kansas City, Newark and Louisville. Mainline flights to Austin, Columbus (OH), New York–LaGuardia and St. Louis were also dropped and service to other cities was reduced or downgraded. Other airlines cut flights and destinations also, including United's service to Denver, US Airways' services to Las Vegas and Phoenix–Sky Harbor. ExpressJet ended its independent flights to Kansas City and New Orleans (ExpressJet now only operates as United Express and Delta Connection). In 2008 RDU lost over 30 flights from the March 2008 schedule.|$|E
25|$|To help {{mitigate}} the declining population, the government {{continues to increase}} child support payments. Thus it provides one-time payments of 12,250 hryvnias for the first child, 25,000 Hryvnias for the second and 50,000 Hryvnias for the third and fourth, along with monthly payments of 154 hryvnias per child. The demographic trend is showing signs of improvement, as the birth rate has been steadily growing since 2001. Net population growth over {{the first nine months}} of 2007 was registered in five provinces of the country (out of 24), and population shrinkage was showing signs of stabilising nationwide. In 2007 the highest birth rates were in the western oblasts. In 2008, Ukraine emerged from lowest-low fertility, and the upward trend has continued since, except for a slight dip in 2010 <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>economic</b> crisis of 2009 (see demographic tables).|$|E

25|$|One {{could even}} {{say that in the}} years before 1780 the {{prospects}} of the economy were improving: <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>economic</b> growth in the German hinterland there were possibilities of growth in distributional trade in colonial commodities, and industrial products (Dutch or other European). Such possibilities were indeed realized in the 20th century, when the Netherlands again became a major distributional hub. The agricultural sector still enjoyed high productivity, whereas the nearby British markets for dairy products and produce offered opportunities for increased exports (which were indeed soon realized). Only, the high-cost structure of the labor market, high taxes, structural overvaluation of the guilder, all militated against most forms of industrial production, let alone export industries. Without the necessary reforms to remedy these problems the Netherlands were unlikely to participate in the industrial renaissance that Great Britain, and later other neighboring countries, started to experience {{in the latter part of}} the 18th century.|$|E
25|$|With a great {{increase}} in knowledge of Asia among Western specialists, increasing {{political and economic}} involvement in the region, {{and in particular the}} realization of the existence of close relations between Indian and European languages, by William Jones, there emerged more complex intellectual connections between the early history of Eastern and Western cultures. Some of these developments occurred in the context of Franco–British rivalry for control of India. Liberal economists, such as James Mill, denigrated Eastern civilizations as static and corrupt. Karl Marx, himself of Jewish origin, characterized the Asiatic mode of production as unchanging, <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>economic</b> narrowness of village economies and the State's role in production. Oriental despotism was generally regarded in Europe as {{a major factor in the}} relative failure of progress of Eastern societies. The study of Islam in particular was central to the field since the majority of people living in the geographical area termed 'the Orient' were Muslims. Interest in understanding Islam was partly fueled by economic considerations of growing trade in the Mediterranean region and the changing cultural and intellectual climate of the time.|$|E

In 1930 Cunard ordered an 80,000 ton liner {{that was to be}} the first of two record-breakers fast enough to fit into a two-ship weekly Southampton–New York service.

However, in an effort to boost employment in the Battersea area, which had suffered badly in the depression, the Ministry of Transport agreed to underwrite 60% of the costs of a cheaper four-lane bridge costing £365,000 (about £ in [...] ), on condition that all materials used in the building of the bridge be sourced from within the British Empire.|$|E
500|$|On 23 January 2013, Miliband {{stated that}} he was against holding a {{referendum}} on the UK's membership of the European Union <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>economic</b> uncertainty that it would create.

In August 2013, following the recall of Parliament to discuss an alleged chemical attack in Syria, Miliband announced that Labour would oppose any military intervention on the basis that there was insufficient evidence.
