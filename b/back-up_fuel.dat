50|$|Moneypoint {{power station}} (Stáisiúin Chumhachta Ghob na Muine) is Ireland's largest {{electricity}} generation station (output 915 MW) and only coal-fired power station. Commissioned between 1985-87, {{it is located}} on the River Shannon near Kilrush, County Clare. It was constructed at a cost of more than £700m in one of the largest capital projects in the history of Ireland. The station operates largely on coal, making it both unique in the context of Irish electricity production and the country's single largest emitter of greenhouse gases. It is capable of meeting around 25% of customer demand across the country.

40|$|Background. For the {{treatment}} of visceral leishmaniasis in Bangladesh, single dose liposomal amphotericin B (ambisome) {{is supposed to be}} the safest and most effective treatment. Specific needs for application and storage raise questions about feasibility of its implementation and acceptance by patients and health staff. Methods. The study was carried out in the most endemic district of Bangladesh. Study population includes patients treated with ambisome or miltefosine, hospital staff, and a director of the national visceral leishmaniasis program. Study methods include direct observation (subdistrict hospitals), open interviews (heath staff and program personnel), structured questionnaires, and focus group discussions (patients). Results. Politicalcommitment for ambisome is strong; the general hospital infrastructure favours implementation but further strengthening is required, particularly for drug storage below 25 °C (refrigerators), <b>back-up</b> energy (<b>fuel</b> for generators), and supplies for ambisome administration (like 5 % dextrose solution). Ambisome created high satisfaction in patients and hospital staff, less adverse events, and less income loss for patients compared to miltefosine. Conclusions. High political commitment, general capacities of subdistrict hospitals, and high acceptability favour the implementation of ambisome treatment in Bangladesh.

50|$|Gas {{production}} commenced in 1991 {{with the}} development of the Hides Gas to Electricity Project (GTE). The Hides GTE project consists of a pipeline (PL 1) connecting the Hides-1 and Hides-2 wells to a small gas conditioning plant at the Hides Production Facility (HPF) located in the Tagari River valley. Sales gas is then used by the Porgera Joint Venture to generate electricity in an adjacent facility. The electricity is transmitted to the Porgera Gold Mine by overhead wire. Condensate produced along with the gas is distilled into naphtha and diesel which is sold into local markets and used as <b>back-up</b> <b>fuel</b> for the power station. Oil Search owns 100% of the GTE project and is Operator. The gas is sold under a long-term gas supply contract, which was revised {{in the first half of}} 2012.|$|E
40|$|All {{renewable}} energy systems make some contribution to climate change. This {{is due to}} the emission of greenhouse gases from the fossil fuels combusted for their construction, and as back-up energy during their operation. Accurate calculation of greenhouse gas emissions per kilowatt hour of electricity is difficult, but {{is an important part of}} policy making and planning. Calculation methodologies and results for different grid-scale electricity generation systems are presented in this paper, with an emphasis on solar thermal systems. Both material inventory and financial-based methods are employed, and the results are compared with other recent studies. For most renewable electricity plants, the emissions have a strong dependence on the capacity factor, <b>back-up</b> <b>fuel,</b> and on the size of the plant. For typical solar thermal plants, the results show that approximately 90 g of CO 2 equivalent are released per kWh of electricity generated over the lifetime of the plant. 1...|$|E
30|$|Global {{concerns}} over climate change {{as well as}} increasing energy consumption necessitate a cleaner future electric grid. Fossil-fuel based power plants emit tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, a primary gas pollutant in the United States accounting for 82 % of greenhouse gas emissions. Environmental regulations like the EPA’s Clean Power Plan aim to combat climate change by proposing carbon dioxide emissions reduction by 30 % by 2030 from power plants. In order to achieve this, states {{across the country are}} retiring coal plants and are seeking to replace them with renewable energy resources such as wind and solar power. Since the latter can be highly volatile, increasing their penetration into the power grid calls for quick, cheap, clean, and flexible back-up fuels to ensure reliability. Gas-fired generators (GFGs) are sought after as this reliable <b>back-up</b> <b>fuel</b> due to their flexibility, quick ramp rates, and low cost. As a result, natural gas (NG) and electricity networks are getting increasingly linked and interdependent.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Heat for {{brooding}} is {{the biggest}} single energy use item in the typical integrated broiler operation. Maintenance of the proper temperature is particularly important during the first week, before the bird develops the ability to regulate its own body temperature. A number of energy sources are being evaluated to supplement or replace the conventional liquid propane gas and natural gas sources. Solar heat and methane are the best known alternatives. Others include wind, coal and wood combustion, coal, wood, and biomass gasification, and hy-drogen and heat pumps. Each alternative has advantages and disadvantages. Installations should be studied carefully before an alternate heat source is selected. In particular, the supply of energy, whether from wind coal or some other source, should be matched {{to the needs of}} the poultry production unit. Economics, in most cases, are not attractive when compared to the costs of conventional fuels. However, the economics should improve as conventional fuels become more expensive and as improved technology is developed for the alternate energy sources. A <b>back-up,</b> conventionally <b>fueled</b> heating system will be needed in many cases. (Key words. - fuel, temperature, energy, brooding...|$|R

Department of Energy's National Energy Technology Laboratory, Siemens Westinghouse is conducting a three-year program to develop an ultra low NOx, fuel flexible catalytic combustor for gas turbine application in IGCC. The program is defined in three phases: Phase 1 -Implementation Plan, Phase 2 -Validation Testing and Phase 3 -Field Testing. The Phase 1 program has been completed. Phase II was initiated in October 2004. In IGCC power plants, the gas turbine must be capable of operating on syngas as a primary fuel and an available <b>back-up</b> <b>fuel</b> such as natural gas.

40|$|In {{solar cooling}} systems the {{selection}} of the thermal driven and solar collection technologies is mainly based on climate and load conditions analysis. Moreover in particular conditions (i. e., south part of the Mediterranean basin), energy (electricity, <b>back-up</b> <b>fuel)</b> and water costs and availability can be driving parameters in the design process. The work presented in this paper falls within the activities carried out to evaluate the technical feasibility of solar cooling in the Mediterranean food & agro industry. In particular, a case study based on the application of a solar refrigeration system for a Tunisian Agro-food industry is presented. This novel system consists in the series connection of a concentrating collector, a water-ammonia single effect air-cooled absorption chiller and a cold storage. This configuration is justified by the high temperature difference between the chilled refrigerant temperature about – 5 °C and the ambient temperature which could exceed 40 °C. The monitoring data obtained were analyzed in order to extract the performance figures recommended by the most up to date unified monitoring procedure proposed within Task 38 -SHC of the International Energy Agency (IEA).

40|$|Natural gas {{presently}} provides {{nearly one}} quarter of New Zealandʼs primary energy and, since the production started at the Maui gas field over twenty years ago, the quantity of gas used in electricity generation has more than doubled, with about {{one quarter of}} electricity demand now generated from natural gas. Gas {{has proven to be}} a competitive and versatile thermal fuel in the industrial, commercial and residential markets and is a necessary and reliable complement to renewable resources in electricity generation. Underpinning the attractiveness of gas is efficient and cost-effective combustion and generation technology and a highly reliable system of supply. Gas is supplied from the production and processing facilities in Taranaki to the principal gasfired power stations through a high-pressure transmission system. Whilst this system has operated to a high level of reliability since the 1970 ʼs, it does not have built into its design 1 the reliability criteria, such as N- 1, applied in electricity transmission networks whereby the loss of a linkage within the system will not cause a failure elsewhere. The reliability of the gas transmission system can be ascribed to its engineering and operational competence rather than the availability of back-up supplies through the design of the network layout. The few failures in gas supplies which have occurred have generally been of short duration and caused by damage to the transmission pipelines, such as washout by flooding or impact by digging machinery operating adjacent to the buried pipeline. Unlike the electricity transmission network, there is some storage capacity within the gas system as the gas is transmitted at high pressure (up to 86 bar) and consumers can be supplied for some time as the gas decompresses in the pipeline downstream of the damage. During the washout of the Hawkes Bay pipeline in 2004, there was sufficient compressed gas, or linepack, in the pipeline to supply the residential gas market for the week the pipeline was out of operation. However, larger industrial consumers could not receive gas during this period. Government and the gas industry is aware of this potential vulnerability to gas supplies and, through the Gas Industry Company, is replacing existing industry arrangements for dealing with critical contingencies with regulations under the Gas Act. The resulting Gas Governance (Critical Contingency Management) Regulations 2008 include, inter alia, the appointment of a critical contingency operator, the preparation of critical contingency management plans, and curtailment arrangements to reduce gas supply to consumers. They are intended to permit the more efficient management of situations when gas supply is affected by short-term production outage or physical problems with the transmission system which the market proves unable to manage although they do not specify a maximum period for which the contingency arrangements will be applied. One of CAENZʼs principal areas of activity is developing a more thorough understanding of the resilience of New Zealand infrastructure to natural hazards and the inter-dependencies between any vulnerabilities and the wider economy. The natural gas supply system is a significant part of this infrastructure and little publicized work has been undertaken to investigate the impact of sustained failures within the supply system on gas availability and the consequent impact on gas consumers, in particular the electricity generators which have a wider impact on electricity consumers. This lack of investigation is due in part to the high level of reliability of gas supplies. Whilst gas supplies may be crucial to many commercial and industrial consumers, relatively few have back-up measures in place to replace gas if it were not available. In some cases this is because the consumersʼ operations require the particular properties of natural gas but in most cases it is due to the costs of making provision for <b>back-up</b> <b>fuels</b> which is deemed unnecessary given the high reliability of natural gas supply. However, this is not to say that situations cannot occur which result in a sustained shortfall of gas supplies. It is the intention of this investigation to provide a better understanding of the impact of breakdowns in the gas supply system on the availability of gas to consumers and the consequent impact on their operations. Specific attention is given to the impact of gas availability on electricity generation and the interplay between gas and electricity demand when gas is in short supply...|$|R
40|$|Solar {{photovoltaic}} {{and wind}} power are increasingly contributing to electricity supply in Europe and worldwide. Due to their intermittent nature, questions of balancing power demand, system stability and the interconnection of electricity, heat and transport sector {{have become a}} major focus of energy system research. REMix is a high resolution multi-sectoral energy system model using a linear optimization approach. It has been developed with the aim of providing a powerful tool for the development and assessment of future energy supply scenarios. Model applications range from cost-minimum green-field capacity expansion analysis to validation of long-term supply scenarios and impact assessment of different storage and balancing options on renewable energy integration. The optimization in REMix is set up in a modular structure and currently comprises around 20 technology modules, describing power generation technologies, heat production technologies or balancing options. The latter include storage, demand response, transmission grids, as well as fuel cell and electric vehicles. Using REMix, the impact of different technologies on the overall system is studied. Model results are presented that show the importance of the interconnection between different demand sectors. Demand response, flexible hydrogen production for industry and transport sector and enhanced coupling between power and heat supply can provide notable amounts of balancing power and energy. Together with transmission grid expansion and additional storage, they can substantially reduce the demand for conventional power storage and fossil <b>fuel</b> <b>back-up</b> capacities...|$|R
40|$|China has {{constituted}} {{the most significant}} source of the incremental growth in global oil demand over the last decade, adding around 5 million b/d between 2000 and 2012. This {{is expected to continue}} well into the future: the International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that China will account for more than 40 per cent of the increase in oil demand to 2035. A big part of that growth story has related to diesel, which has assumed a growing importance in the energy production and consumption of the world’s fastest growing emerging market economies. Fuelled by trade and investment, China’s growth has strongly supported diesel demand over the last decade. The dominant position of diesel in commercial freight traffic, be it by truck or rail, has made it the fastest-growing demand component. In China, the government mandate requiring all trucks to be fuelled by diesel by 2010 simply accelerated the already rising momentum of diesel demand growth. Further, diesel demand received an extra boost from power problems that led to greater use of diesel as a <b>back-up</b> <b>fuel.</b> In 2004, 2008, and 2010, power shortages during the winter months together with periods of government power rationing (to achieve environmental targets) contributed to buoyant diesel demand. The heavy industrial and mining sectors –such as coal, ship building, steel, and cement – that rely heavily on diesel, boomed throughout the 2000 s. It is thus hardly a surprise that diesel was the backbone of Chinese oil demand growth, to the extent that Chinese oil demand growth was synonymous with diesel demand growth...|$|E
40|$|The {{need for}} {{air-conditioning}} in buildings and for industrial process cooling - e. g., in food industry - is growing rapidly {{all over the}} world. A new promising approach to meet this increasing demand in an environmentally sound way {{is the use of}} solar energy in combination with heat driven cold production. Many technical solutions are possible to use solar heat for air-conditioning. Key issues for system design and selection of components are: - The selection of the room air-conditioning distribution systems: e. g., radiative ceilings and other ”high temperature” systems need only chilled water temperatures in the range of 15 - 18 °C while chilled water networks supplying fan-coil systems require temperatures at 7 - 10 °C. - The heat rejection technology used: a wet cooling tower allows for lower heat rejection temperatures than dry air-cooling. - The presence and size of a storage to overcome mismatches between solar gains and cooling loads. A very attractive solution in terms of energy density is an ice storage; however this storage requires cold production temperatures below 0 °C. The system selection is mainly based on climate and load conditions analysis and on the energy (electricity, <b>back-up</b> <b>fuel)</b> and water costs and availability. In this paper a basic thermodynamic analysis is presented which gives insight into the interaction between the selection of the proper technical solution and the climate and load conditions. In {{the second part of the}} paper a special focus is given on a newly designed system which can be applied under extreme climatic conditions, i. e., hot and humid climates...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{the paper}} is to {{investigate}} plant flexibility for a pre-combustion cycle. That is, answering the question: how flexible is the plant to changes in operating conditions? Steady-state off-design simulations was the key component of the plant flexibility analysis. Specifically, part load behavior and dual-fuel operation of the integrated reforming combined cycle (IRCC) were studied. The idea of the plant was to use hydrogen-rich decarbonized fuel as the primary fuel and natural gas as <b>back-up</b> <b>fuel.</b> If a problem would occur in the reforming, water-gas shift, or CO 2 capture processes {{there might be a}} need to switch to a natural gas feed for the gas turbine. This led to design challenges for the heat recovery steam generator (HRSG). The design of the HRSG for the IRCC process was different from an HRSG design in a natural gas combined cycle (NGCC) plant because of the significant amount of steam production from the heat generated in the reforming process. In addition, preheating (within the HRSG) of some of the process streams could add to the complexity in HRSG design. For the concepts studied it was of importance to maintain a high net plant efficiency on both fuels. Therefore the HRSG design had to be a compromise between NGCC and IRCC operation modes. In the analysis performed, part load behavior was good with efficiency reductions from base load operation comparable to that of the reference combined cycle plant. Based on the analysis performed in the present work, it was possible to operate a complex plant like an IRCC at loads down to 60  gas turbine load while capturing 85 % of the CO 2. During start-up and operation at lower loads, CO 2 would not be captured. The investigation was done by using process simulation tools Aspen Plus by AspenTech and GT PRO/GT MASTER by Thermoflow...|$|E
40|$|L’évolution du cerveau humain suscite l’intérêt des scientifiques depuis longtemps. Ainsi l’augmentation de la taille du cerveau au cours de la période de {{modernisation}} pré-humaine a été associée à l’apparition d’aptitudes remarquables comme la capacité à fabriquer des outils, la bipédie, la chasse et le raffinement de l’interaction sociale, les talents artistiques et le développement du langage. Bien entendu, avec la taille c’est aussi {{la croissance}} de certaines parties du cerveau (notamment le cortex) qui entrent en jeu. Quel a été l’élément déterminant de cette évolution ? Il semble bien qu’aujourd’hui comme naguère (il y a cinq ou six millions d’années), l’apport nutritif constitue un facteur clé. La disponibilité et l’ingestion d’aliments riches en acides gras fournissent une suite d’éléments explicatifs susceptibles d’étayer une théorie selon laquelle les individus les plus adipeux (fattest) se seraient les mieux adaptés (fittest). En somme, l’environnement aurait eu un effet sur les capacités de survie de certains individus par rapport à d’autres. The circumstances of human brain evolution are of central importance to accounting for human origins, yet are still poorly understood. Human evolution is usually portrayed as having {{occurred in a}} hot, dry climate in East Africa where the earliest human ancestors became bipedal and evolved tool-making skills and language while struggling {{to survive in a}} wooded or savannah environment. At least three points need to be recognised when constructing concepts of human brain evolution : (1) The human brain cannot develop normally without a reliable supply of several nutrients, notably docosahexaenoic acid, iodine and iron. (2) At term, the human fetus has about 13  % of body weight as fat, a key form of energy insurance supporting brain development that is not found in other primates. (3) The genome of humans and chimpanzees is < 1  % different, so if they both evolved in essentially the same habitat, how did the human brain become so much larger, and how was its present-day nutritional vulnerability circumvented during 5 - 6 million years of hominid evolution ? The abundant presence of fish bones and shellfish remains in many African hominid fossil sites dating to 2 million years ago implies human ancestors commonly inhabited the shores, but this point is usually overlooked in conceptualizing how the human brain evolved. Shellfish, fish and shore-based animals and plants are the richest dietary sources of the key nutrients needed by the brain. Whether on the shores of lakes, marshes, rivers or the sea, the consumption of most shore-based foods requires no specialized skills or tools. The presence of key brain nutrients and a rich energy supply in shore-based foods would have provided the essential metabolic and nutritional support needed to gradually expand the hominid brain. Abundant availability of these foods also provided the time needed to develop and refine proto-human attributes that subsequently formed the basis of language, culture, tool making and hunting. The presence of body fat in human babies appears to be the product of a long period of sedentary, shore-based existence by the line of hominids destined to become humans, and became the unique solution to insuring a <b>back-up</b> <b>fuel</b> supply for the expanding hominid brain. Hence, survival of the fattest (babies) was the key to human brain evolution...|$|E
