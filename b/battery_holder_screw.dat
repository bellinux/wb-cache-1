50|$|<b>Battery</b> <b>holders</b> {{developed}} {{in parallel with}} batteries over time; as battery package sizes shrunk so did the holders. In the 1980s, the first circuit board mounting lithium coin cell <b>battery</b> <b>holders</b> appeared {{in the form of}} patent no. 4487820 by the <b>battery</b> <b>holder</b> manufacturer MPD.|$|R
50|$|<b>Battery</b> <b>holders</b> for zinc-air <b>batteries</b> {{must not}} be {{completely}} air-tight since approximately 1 litre of air is required per ampere-hour of discharge per cell. The <b>battery</b> <b>holder</b> may include a valve integrated with the device power switch to allow air to be admitted when the device is switched on.|$|R
50|$|Design of the <b>battery</b> <b>holder</b> {{requires}} {{knowledge of}} how and where the larger product will be used. Human factors to be considered include ease of battery exchange, age range and physical condition of the intended user. These elements {{must be taken into}} account for a design to be successful and are part of the design process. A designer must select between a <b>battery</b> <b>holder</b> molded into the product case or made as a separate part. For many products regulations and product safety standards affect the <b>battery</b> <b>holder</b> selection.|$|R

5000|$|The plastic <b>battery</b> <b>holder</b> on the T90 is {{somewhat}} susceptible to breakage, {{and can cause}} the camera to become inoperative. Used cameras should be carefully checked for broken/repaired <b>battery</b> <b>holder</b> compartments. Another common problem is failure of the second internal battery that retains frame number/ISO settings, replacement of which requires service by a person skilled in soldering techniques and camera disassembly.|$|R
50|$|Some early 1900s <b>battery</b> <b>holders</b> {{were often}} {{no more than}} a {{cardboard}} box with copper contacts. By the 1920s, <b>battery</b> <b>holders</b> used twin metal clips (like fuse holders) to hold the battery in place while making electrical contact. Patent no. 1439429 was granted in Dec., 1922 for an assembly with two spring arm clips, a small switch and a lamp assembly on the end of connected wires.|$|R
50|$|Cold-weather <b>battery</b> <b>holder</b> was {{available}} from 1969 and minor changes {{were applied to}} the appearance. The cold-weather <b>battery</b> <b>holder</b> allowed the relocation of the battery by using a long cord with a dummy battery carrier and receptacle for the original <b>battery</b> <b>holder</b> to then {{be placed in a}} warm pocket to avoid battery failure due to cold. Along with the availability macro lenses for close work, a selection of extension tubes and in both the standard bayonet and the outer bayonet were available as well. As well as a compact and convenient variable extension was also available. For more flexibility a bellows system {{was available}} as well as a slide copier accessory.|$|R
50|$|A <b>battery</b> <b>holder</b> {{is either}} a plastic case with {{the shape of the}} housing molded as a {{compartment}} or compartments that accepts a battery or batteries, or a separate plastic holder that is mounted with screws, eyelets, glue, double-sided tape, or other means. <b>Battery</b> <b>holders</b> may have a lid to retain and protect the batteries, or may be sealed to prevent damage to circuitry and components from battery leakage. Coiled spring wire or flat tabs that press against the battery terminals are the two most common methods of making the electrical connection inside a holder. External connections on <b>battery</b> <b>holders</b> are usually made by contacts with pins, surface mount feet, solder lugs, or wire leads.|$|R

50|$|Zinc-air {{batteries}} {{cannot be}} used in a sealed <b>battery</b> <b>holder</b> since some air must come in; the oxygen in 1 liter of air is required for every ampere-hour of capacity used.|$|R
50|$|Most {{cylindrical}} dry batteries (such as the AA battery) have {{a projection}} {{at one end}} (positive) and a flat base (negative). These mate with metal strips or springs in the <b>battery</b> <b>holder.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{electronics}} industry now uses many {{surface mounted}} lithium <b>battery</b> <b>holders</b> or sockets. CR2/3A, CR1/2AA and CR123A batteries began in camera applications, but expanded into new markets like alarm systems, hand held computers, and keyfobs.|$|R
50|$|Digital cameras utilize either {{proprietary}} or standard consumer batteries. , most cameras use proprietary {{lithium-ion batteries}} while some use standard AA batteries or primarily use a proprietary Lithium-ion rechargeable battery pack but have an optional AA <b>battery</b> <b>holder</b> available.|$|R
50|$|Battery {{technologies}} {{offered by}} Renata comprise silver oxide (for wristwatches, calculators and small electronic toys, etc.), zinc air (for hearing aids), lithium (non-rechargeable, primary) (for computer battery backup, etc.) and <b>battery</b> <b>holders,</b> {{as well as}} lithium polymer (rechargeable, secondary) (for industrial use).|$|R
50|$|The {{introduction}} of polypropylene in the 1950s and miniature batteries by Eveready {{allowed for the}} use of small plastic <b>battery</b> <b>holders.</b> These are still common in toys, decorations, and lighted or blinking items. In 1957, electric wrist watches gained popularity with the public.|$|R

50|$|A <b>battery</b> <b>holder</b> is {{one or more}} {{compartments}} or chambers {{for holding}} a battery. For dry cells, the holder must also make electrical contact with the battery terminals. For wet cells, cables are often connected to the battery terminals, as is found in automobiles or emergency lighting equipment.|$|R
50|$|Most current <b>battery</b> <b>holders</b> {{are made}} with {{polypropylene}} or nylon bodies rated for 80-100 °C. Lithium coin cell holders {{are made with}} high temperature PBT, nylon or LCP bodies because they normally are circuit board mounted and require wave soldering at 180-240 °C or reflow soldering at 260-300 °C.|$|R

50|$|In {{addition}} to disposable (one use) button cells, rechargeable batteries {{in many of}} the same sizes are available, with lower capacity than disposable cells. Disposable and rechargeable batteries are manufactured to fit into a holder or with solder tags for permanent connection. In equipment with a <b>battery</b> <b>holder,</b> disposable or rechargeable batteries may be used, if the voltage is compatible.|$|R

The center of the "donut" has a screw and thread on each side, so that when {{unscrewed}} {{each side of the}} "donut" becomes a base of a candlestick. Stored inside of the two candlestick bases are the candle holders of the apparatus. Each of the <b>holders</b> <b>screws</b> onto one of the candlestick bases, creating a collapsible candlestick set that is easily portable. The two candles are used on Shabbat (and other holidays) and are lit prior to sunset to usher in Shabbat. Nancy L. SalzUpdated recordDigital imag...|$|R
50|$|Depending on the model, some Galaxy Note II (GT-N7100) {{units have}} the two {{optional}} charging pins {{on the back side}} of the device, just right of the <b>battery</b> <b>holder,</b> that can be used for wireless charging with the modified back cover. Galaxy Note II displays the notification message built in the firmware when it is charged wirelessly. SCH-L900 does not have the pins. SGH-T889 has the pins, but they are disabled.|$|R
50|$|The {{processors}} for {{the first}} Microvision cartridges were made with both Intel 8021 (cross licensed by Signetics) and Texas Instruments TMS1100 processors. Due to purchasing issues, Milton Bradley switched to using TMS1100 processors exclusively including reprogramming the games that were originally programmed for the 8021 processor. The TMS1100 was a more primitive device, but offered more memory and lower power consumption than the 8021. First-revision Microvisions needed two batteries due to the 8021's higher power consumption, but later units (designed for the TMS1100) only had one active <b>battery</b> <b>holder.</b> Even though the battery compartment was designed to allow the two 9-volt batteries to be inserted with proper polarity {{of positive and negative}} terminals, when a battery was forcefully improperly oriented, while the other battery was properly oriented, the two batteries would be shorted and they would overheat. The solution was to remove terminals for one of the batteries to prevent this hazard. Due to the high cost of changing production molds, Milton Bradley did not eliminate the second battery compartment, but instead removed its terminals and called it the spare <b>battery</b> <b>holder.</b>|$|R
5000|$|LFP's higher (3.2 V) {{working voltage}} can allow a single cell to drive an LED without needing a step-up circuit. The {{increased}} tolerance to modest overcharging (compared to other Li cell types) means that [...] could {{be connected to}} photovoltaic cells without complex circuitry. A single LFP cell also alleviates corrosion, condensation and dirt issues associated with <b>battery</b> <b>holder</b> and cell-to-cell contacts - such poor connections often especially plague outdoor systems using multiple removable NiMH cells.|$|R
50|$|There {{is a lot}} of {{uncertainty}} as to the effects of <b>battery</b> <b>holders</b> and <b>batteries</b> on the environment. The debate is evolving alongside developments in environmental awareness, such as concerns over global warming and e-waste. There are concerns that devices, such as cell phones and iPods, are heavily contributing to this through their use of soldered in batteries, which could be made removable and therefore replaceable. This could improve the life of each unit while reducing the amount of e-waste generated.|$|R

5000|$|When the Thunderware Thunderclock Plus was {{released}} in 1980, it quickly became the de facto standard for an Apple II system clock. When Apple Computer released its new ProDOS operating system in 1984, a Thunderclock software driver came built-in. From that point on, all new Apple II system clocks strived to emulate the Thunderclock. The card itself was more compact than the earlier [...] "The Clock" [...] from Mountain Computers and contained two <b>battery</b> <b>holders</b> for off the shelf alkaline batteries which were easily replaceable.|$|R
50|$|Capsela was a {{construction}} toy brand consisting primarily of gears and motors in spherical plastic capsules {{that could be}} connected to form various static or dynamic toys suitable for land or water. The capsules usually have six hollow octagonal connectors pointing out, where an octagonal sleeve piece bridges between two capsules. The hollow connection pegs on a capsule can have electrical or rotary adapters inside, reaching into the next capsule. There are electric motor capsules, gear capsules, switch capsules, pontoon capsules, and others; there are also <b>battery</b> <b>holders,</b> wheels, propellers, impellers, lights, wires, and other miscellaneous supporting pieces.|$|R
50|$|The Pentax K-500 is an {{entry-level}} sibling of the Pentax K-50, sharing {{almost all}} of its features. The main {{differences between the two}} cameras are the K-500's lack of colored body options (only black), electronic level, weather sealing, and focus point visualisation through the optical viewfinder. As a consequence of the lack of weather sealing, this camera is bundled with the non-weather-sealed DA L 18-55mm kit lens, and most variants of the camera come with an AA <b>battery</b> <b>holder</b> included as opposed to the D-Li109 rechargeable Li-ion battery included with the K-50. However, the camera is still compatible with the aforementioned Li-ion battery.|$|R
5000|$|Many {{parts were}} {{introduced}} since the Liverpool factory closed under the French-and-Japanese {{running of the}} company. These included plastic parts, can motors, and modern <b>battery</b> <b>holders.</b> Metal became an expensive raw material {{to work with and}} many of the metal parts were replaced with plastic parts. Allen (hex-headed) zinc electroplated steel bolts replaced the slotted bolts. Some Meccano modellers enthusiastically embrace the changes and new parts. However, the [...] "purists" [...] look down on these new parts. Some enthusiasts set self-imposed limits on using only parts deemed to be traditional and steer clear of those parts viewed as “not truly Meccano”.|$|R
