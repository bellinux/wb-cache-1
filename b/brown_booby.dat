5|$|As {{part of a}} {{study on}} adaptation, 57 rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) were {{introduced}} to the island of Desecheo and other southern off-shore islands and cays in 1967. Prior to the introduction, Desecheo was the largest nesting colony of the <b>brown</b> <b>booby,</b> but mainly as a result of egg predation by the introduced macaques, no bird species presently nests in the island. Efforts to trap and remove the species have been unsuccessful and it has expanded its range to southwestern Puerto Rico. Other primates also have established populations in Puerto Rico. As a result of vandalism, 107 squirrel monkeys escaped from a research station at Sabana Seca in the late 1970s. The latest estimate for this population is 35 individuals.|$|E
25|$|Twenty-three {{species of}} birds were found in a 1969 survey, of which 19 were {{observed}} during a follow-up count in 1988. Species breeding in larger numbers that year included the great frigatebird and red-footed booby. Their numbers appear reduced due {{to the destruction of}} the Pisonia forests. Other breeding species include the red-tailed tropicbird, white-tailed tropicbird, the masked booby, <b>brown</b> <b>booby,</b> white tern, brown noddy, and sooty tern.|$|E
25|$|The atoll {{supports}} {{a large population}} of sea and shorebirds, with up to 26 species present. Species breeding during 1988 included the <b>brown</b> <b>booby,</b> red-footed booby, great frigatebird, red-tailed tropicbird, sooty tern, white tern, brown noddy, and possibly the reef heron. Migratory birds present included the bristle-thighed curlew, turnstone, wandering tattler, golden plover, and the sanderling. The densest bird populations are on three islets {{to the north of}} Sibylla: North (Kita), Kamwome and an unnamed islet. Bokak is the only known breeding ground of Christmas shearwater and possibly Bulwer's petrel.|$|E

25|$|Seabirds use {{the islands}} as resting, breeding, and {{wintering}} sites. Species found here include streaked shearwater (Calonectris leucomelas), <b>brown</b> <b>booby</b> (Sula leucogaster), red-footed booby (S. sula), great crested tern (Sterna bergii), and white tern (Gygis alba). Little {{information is available}} regarding {{the current status of}} the islands' seabird populations, though it is likely that birds may divert nesting sites to smaller, less disturbed islands. Bird eggs cover the majority of Song Tu, a small island in the eastern Danger Zone. A variety of cetaceans such as dolphins, orcas, pilot whales, and sperm whales are also present around the islands.|$|E
25|$|Sea birds (magnificent frigatebird, <b>brown</b> <b>booby,</b> masked booby, terns, double-crested {{cormorant}} (Phalacrocorax auritus), pelican, petrels) nest on the cliffs and uninhabited islands. In particular, on Grand-Îlet, a natural reserve of the archipelago which houses species of booby found nowhere else on les Saintes: red-footed booby (Sula sula) and blue-footed booby (Sula nebouxii). But {{in the context}} of global warming and invasive foreign species implanted by the humans (e.g. red lionfish), the environment and the biodiversity of these islands are considered to be very vulnerable and to be protected. It is therefore recommended that visitors do not take plants or capture animals to avoid disturbing the species in their natural biotope, and do not pollute the ecosystem.|$|E
25|$|The {{island is}} {{a focal point}} for seabirds of various species. Eight species or {{subspecies}} of seabirds nest on it. The most numerous is the red-footed booby, which nests in colonies, using trees on many parts of the shore terrace. The widespread <b>brown</b> <b>booby</b> nests on the ground {{near the edge of the}} seacliff and inland cliffs. Abbott's booby (listed as endangered) nests on tall emergent trees of the western, northern and southern plateau rainforest, the only remaining nesting habitat for this bird in the world. Another endangered and endemic bird, the Christmas frigatebird, has nesting areas on the northeastern shore terraces. The more widespread great frigatebirds nest in semi-deciduous trees on the shore terrace, with the greatest concentrations being in the North West and South Point areas. The common noddy and two species of bosun or tropicbirds, with their brilliant gold or silver plumage and distinctive streamer tail feathers, also nest on the island.|$|E
50|$|The islands {{have been}} {{identified}} by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area (IBA) because they support over 1% of the world populations of <b>brown</b> <b>boobies</b> and roseate terns. The breeding colony of <b>brown</b> <b>boobies,</b> of up to 18,000 breeding pairs, is possibly {{the largest in the}} world. Up to 20,000 roseate terns have been recorded there.|$|R

Others include the resident [...] crested tern, sooty tern, brown noddy, black noddy, white tern, black-naped tern, and the migrant wedge-tailed shearwater, red-tailed tropicbird, red-footed booby, <b>brown</b> <b>booby,</b> great frigatebird, golden plover, bristle-thighed curlew, wandering tattler, and ruddy turnstone.|$|E
2500|$|Desecheo, {{which has}} no known bodies of surface water, reaches a maximum {{elevation}} of 715 ft (218 m) and has an annual precipitation, on average, of 40.15in (1020mm). The lack of surface water limits its flora to thorny shrubs, small trees, weeds and various cacti, including the endangered higo chumbo [...] (Harrisia portoricensis). Fauna includes various species of seabirds, three endemic species of lizard (Ameiva desechensis, Anolis desechensis and Sphaerodactylus levinsi), introduced goats and rats, and a population of rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) introduced from Cayo Santiago in 1967 {{as part of a}} study on adaptation. Before the introduction of rhesus monkeys the island was the largest nesting colony of the <b>brown</b> <b>booby,</b> however, no species presently nests on the island.|$|E
2500|$|Many {{bird species}} are {{seasonal}} {{visitors to the}} offshore cays and are only in evidence at Hans Lollik during the summer breeding season. [...] The most conspicuous birds at the study sites are the resident seabird species, including the <b>brown</b> <b>booby</b> (Sula melanogaster) and the brown pelican (Pelecanus occidentalis). [...] Both species utilize the bait-rich waters of Hans Lollik for feeding; both species target white fry, blue fry, or false pilchard as preferred prey. [...] The prime roosting spots for these species have been located and mapped by JDA to enable the site planning process to avoid these areas. [...] Hans Lollik has no critical nesting sites for any bird species. [...] The cliff-site nesting areas for the tropic bird are de facto protected from humans by their precarious cliff location.|$|E

30|$|Differences in δ 15 N values {{generally}} {{reflect the}} exploitation of resources of different trophic levels by the consumers (e.g., Hobson et al. [1994]; Inger and Bearhop [2008]; Moreno et al. [2011]). We found significant differences in δ 15 N values between the two species and between incubating and chick-rearing <b>brown</b> <b>boobies.</b> However, differences in δ 15 N between two consumers that segregate their diet, i.e. exploit prey of different trophic levels, are usually associated with δ 15 N values differing by 3 ‰ to 4 ‰ (Post [2002]). In our case, the differences were about one magnitude lower and generally less than 0.4 ‰. Thus, while statistically significant, the differences in δ 15 N values are not biologically relevant and suggest that the two species, as well as incubating and chick-rearing <b>brown</b> <b>boobies,</b> exploit similar resources. The observed differences in the δ 15 N values can most likely {{be attributed to the}} influence of protein catabolism related to differences in foraging effort (Hobson et al. [1993]; Cherel et al. [2005]; Navarro et al. [2007]), i.e., higher effort of off-shore foraging red-tailed tropicbirds vs. in-shore foraging <b>brown</b> <b>boobies</b> and of chick-provisioning vs. incubating <b>brown</b> <b>boobies.</b>|$|R
30|$|The {{present study}} {{revealed}} both interspecific and intraspecific differences in δ 13 C and δ 15 N values. Even though absolute {{differences in the}} δ 13 C values between species {{as well as between}} incubating and chick-rearing <b>brown</b> <b>boobies</b> were small (< 0.3 ‰), the isotopic results are supported by the available information about the foraging behavior of the two species and the energetic requirements during breeding. Given the evidence of a decreasing inshore-offshore δ 13 C gradient described for marine ecosystems (Hobson et al. [2002]; Forero and Hobson [2003]), the differences in δ 13 C values between the two study species and between incubating and chick-rearing <b>brown</b> <b>boobies</b> suggest the utilization of different foraging areas. In particular, the lower δ 13 C values of red-tailed tropicbirds suggest that they forage further offshore during both breeding stages than incubating <b>brown</b> <b>boobies</b> (higher δ 13 C values), which seem to use more inshore/coastal foraging areas. During incubation, <b>brown</b> <b>boobies</b> usually make relatively short foraging trips of only several hours and thus feed in areas close to their breeding sites (Nelson [1978]; Dunlop et al. [2001]; Lewis et al. [2004]). In contrast, red-tailed tropicbirds perform long foraging trips, up to several days, to feed in waters far from their breeding colonies (Dunlop et al. [2001]; Le Corre et al. [2003]; Sommerfeld and Hennicke [2010]). The intraspecific differences in δ 13 C values found between incubating and chick-rearing <b>brown</b> <b>boobies</b> suggest a shift in foraging habitat towards more distant foraging areas during chick rearing. Potentially, this is a consequence of different energetic demands during the two breeding stages. <b>Brown</b> <b>boobies</b> reproduce year-round (Nelson [1978]; Stokes [1988]) and hence incubating and chick-rearing adults are in demand of food at the same time. Since chick-rearing adults must find food not only for themselves but also for their chicks, i.e., they have higher energetic demands, they should try to reduce direct competition for food with conspecifics, e.g., by foraging in more distant waters (Ashmole and Ashmole [1967]; Ashmole [1968]; Birt et al. [1987]). Alternatively, they could switch foraging areas to obtain prey of higher energetic value as it has been found in other seabirds (Ricklefs [1983]; Shaffer et al. [2003]; Navarro et al. [2007]).|$|R

30|$|At {{intraspecific}} level, {{we found}} that incubating <b>brown</b> <b>boobies</b> showed lower δ 15 N and higher δ 13 C values than chick-rearing <b>brown</b> <b>boobies</b> (Figure  2; Table  1; δ 15 N: t[*]=[*] 2.91, df[*]=[*] 90, p[*]=[*] 0.004; δ 13 C: t[*]=[*]− 3.23, df[*]=[*] 90, p[*]=[*] 0.002; absolute differences; δ 15 N[*]=[*] 0.14 ‰, δ 13 C[*]=[*] 0.17 ‰).

50|$|Localities {{within the}} site include three Saint Helena plover {{breeding}} sites - Broad Bottom, Southern Pastures, and Man and Horse. Apart from red-billed tropicbirds, breeding seabirds include band-rumped storm petrels, Atlantic masked boobies, Atlantic sooty terns, brown and black noddies, white terns and, possibly, <b>brown</b> <b>boobies.</b>|$|R
30|$|Thus, {{given the}} limited and homogenously {{distributed}} prey availability in their tropical marine foraging habitat, <b>brown</b> <b>boobies</b> and red-tailed tropicbirds {{seem to have}} a strong overlap in their diet during the breeding season and opportunistically exploit whatever prey is available, most likely flying fish and squid, the main and most abundant prey of tropical seabirds (e.g., Ashmole and Ashmole [1967]; Ballance and Pitman [1999]; Catry et al.[2009]). The resulting competition for prey is likely to be reduced by spatial segregation in foraging habitat, facilitating successful reproduction in sympatry in a tropical marine environment with unfavorable prey availability. Additional studies using tracking devices and examining isotopic references of the trophic resources of the species would help to further elucidate ecological mechanisms explaining the coexistence of red-tailed tropicbirds and <b>brown</b> <b>boobies</b> on Christmas Island.|$|R
