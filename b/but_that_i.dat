500|$|A Confederate officer {{approached}} Capehart's 3rd Brigade {{on horseback}} under a flag of truce. Capehart and the officer rode down the column to General Custer, where the officer told the general that Lee and Grant were in correspondence concerning a surrender of Lee's Army. The Confederate officer also requested a truce until {{the results of}} the negotiation were known. Custer's response was [...] "Tell General Longstreet that I am not in command of all the forces here, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am on his flank and rear with a large cavalry force, and that I will accept nothing but unconditional surrender." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2013, Tony Benn reiterated his {{previous}} opposition to European integration. Speaking to the Oxford Union on the alleged overshadowing of the EU debate by [...] "UKIP and Tory backbenchers", he said:I took {{the view that}} having fought [...] that we should now work with them, and co-operate, {{and that was my}} first thought about it. Then how I saw how the European Union was developing, it was very obvious that what they had in mind was not democratic. ... And the way that Europe has developed is that the bankers and the multinational corporations have got very powerful positions, and if you come in on their terms, they will tell you what you can and cannot do. And that is unacceptable. My view about the European Union has always been not that I am hostile to foreigners, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am in favour of democracy ... I think they're building an empire there, they want us {{to be a part of}} their empire and I don't want that.|$|E
500|$|Later authors {{appreciated}} Hebel's work too. Hermann Hesse once commented, [...] "As far as I know, in no {{literary history}} do we yet read that Hebel {{was the greatest}} German novelist, as great as Keller and more confident and purer and mightier in effect than Goethe." [...] Theodor W. Adorno lauded his essay Die Juden as [...] "one {{of the most beautiful}} German prose plays in defence of the Jews". In Die gerettete Zunge, Geschichte einer Jugend, Elias Canetti described the influence that Hebel's Schatzkästlein had on him: [...] "I never wrote a book, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> did not secretly aspire to his style, and I began by writing everything in shorthand, the knowledge of which I owe to him alone." [...] Marcel Reich-Ranicki wrote, [...] "Hebel's stories are among the most beautiful in the German language", and included the [...] "Schatzkästlein" [...] and [...] "Die Rose" [...] in his Kanon Deutscher Literatur. [...] The first was also listed in the ZEIT-Bibliothek der 100 Bücher.|$|E

500|$|Her {{interest}} in acting sparked from watching her brother perform {{in a school}} production of The King and I when she was six. During rehearsals, she pleaded with his teachers to let her be in the play. They let her join the chorus. While enrolled in Woldingham School as a teen, she was heavily involved in theatre. She was the student head of the drama department there, performing in plays and musicals, conducting workshops with younger students, and helping put on productions. When she was 16, she attended a production of HenryV starring Kenneth Branagh. His performance emboldened her and reinforced her belief {{that she wanted to}} pursue a career in acting. She wrote a letter to Branagh asking him for advice. [...] "I explained that my parents didn't want me to act, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> felt it was my vocation in life," [...] she said. Branagh's sister replied: [...] "Kenneth says that if you feel such a strong need to be an actress, you must be an actress." ...|$|E
500|$|Rodriguez {{first came}} up with the idea for Planet Terror during the {{production}} of The Faculty: [...] "I remember telling Elijah Wood and Josh Hartnett, all these young actors, that zombie movies were dead and hadn't been around in a while, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> thought they were going to come back in a big way because they’d been gone for so long. I said, 'We've got to be there first.' I had [...] I’d started writing. It was about 30 pages, and I said to them, 'There are characters for all of you to play.' We got all excited about it, and then I didn't know where to go with it. The introduction was about as far as I'd gotten, and then I got onto other movies. Sure enough, the zombie [...] invasion happened and they all came back again, and I was like, 'Ah, I knew that I should've made my zombie film.'" [...] The story was reapproached when Tarantino and Rodriguez developed the idea for Grindhouse.|$|E
500|$|Besides {{working on}} the Dictionary, Johnson also wrote {{numerous}} essays, sermons, and poems during these nine years. In 1750, he decided to produce a series of essays under the title The Rambler that were to be published every Tuesday and Saturday and sell for twopence each. Explaining the title years later, he told his friend, the painter Joshua Reynolds: [...] "I {{was at a loss}} how to name it. I sat down at night upon my bedside, and resolved that I would not go to sleep till I had fixed its title. The Rambler seemed the best that occurred, and I took it." [...] These essays, often on moral and religious topics, tended to be more grave than the title of the series would suggest; his first comments in The Rambler were to ask [...] "that in this undertaking thy Holy Spirit may not be withheld from me, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> may promote thy glory, and the salvation of myself and others." [...] The popularity of The Rambler took off once the issues were collected in a volume; they were reprinted nine times during Johnson's life. Writer and printer Samuel Richardson, enjoying the essays greatly, questioned the publisher as to who wrote the works; only he and a few of Johnson's friends were told of Johnson's authorship. One friend, the novelist Charlotte Lennox, includes a defence of The Rambler in her novel The Female Quixote (1752). In particular, the character Mr. Glanville says, [...] "you may sit in Judgment upon the Productions of a Young, a Richardson, or a Johnson. Rail with premeditated Malice at the Rambler; and for the want of Faults, turn even its inimitable Beauties into Ridicule." [...] (Book VI, Chapter XI) Later, she claims Johnson as [...] "the greatest Genius in the present Age." ...|$|E

2500|$|A Man for All Seasons {{struggles with}} ideas of {{identity}} and conscience. More argues repeatedly {{that a person is}} defined by his conscience. His own position is depicted as almost indefensible; the Pope is described as a [...] "bad" [...] and corrupt individual, forced by the Emperor Charles V to act according to his will. But as More says to Norfolk, [...] "What matters is not that it's true, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> believe it; or no, not that I believe it, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> believe it." [...] More fears that if he breaks with his conscience, he will be damned to hell, while his associates and friends are more concerned with holding onto their own temporal power.|$|E

Further, this dichotomy was by choice, that is, Angra Mainyu chose to be evil: [...] "It is not that I cannot create anything good, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> will not." [...] And to prove this, he created the peacock.|$|E

[...] In his July 2012 trip to Israel he said that preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear [...] "capability" [...] should be America's [...] "highest national security priority." [...] Romney has said of using military force against Iran, [...] "I don't believe at this stage, therefore, if I'm President, {{that we need to have}} war powers approval or a special authorization for military force." [...] He has refused to state if he would be open to using direct diplomacy to settle the issue with the Iranians.|$|E
2500|$|It is {{believed}} William IV, {{who had been}} his godfather when Duke of Clarence, had George brought up at Windsor in hope of his eventual marriage to his cousin Princess Victoria of Kent, who was two months younger. This prospective match was favoured by George's own parents, but was forestalled by her uncle Leopold I of Belgium. He secured Victoria's betrothal to his nephew, Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, which became formal after she succeeded to the British throne. In 1839 Queen Victoria wrote to Albert about George's father: [...] "The Duke told Lord Melbourne he had always greatly desired our marriage, and never thought of George: <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> don't believe." [...] George {{was one of a}} range of suitors considered by Victoria, the most prominent of whom, Prince Alexander of the Netherlands, was openly favoured by William.|$|E
2500|$|Moby explains: [...] "The B Sides is a {{collection}} of songs that weren't quite appropriate for Play, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> still love enough to release as B-sides. Some of these songs might not be instantly accessible, but I (immodestly) think they are all quite special." [...] A few of the album's songs are somewhat similar to the ones found in Play, but the tracks were criticized as inferior by AllMusic's John Bush, who gave the release three out of five stars. Moby realized this and even admitted that if not for the overwhelming success of Play, the songs would not have been given a wide release. Neva Chonin from Rolling Stone gave it three-and-a-half stars and said it was [...] "more of a meditative tone poem" [...] than the [...] "millennial time signature" [...] that was Play.|$|E

2500|$|Romney {{said during}} his 2008 presidential campaign,y view on {{marriage}} has been entirely consistent over my political career. And {{that is that}} I oppose same-sex marriage.

I've written a letter to every U.S. senator on the topic [...] [...] [...] I believe that traditional marriage is right for the nurturing and development of children, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> do not want to discriminate against gay people in employment or housing or other parts of their life.|$|E
2500|$|<b>But</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> didn’t {{appreciate}} {{the techniques of}} playwriting from just listening it was certainly kind of him and I certainly often went to his room to listen to and discuss drama. The following summer, July if I remember correctly, I went as usual to visit him when Mr. Aston, laughing, said ‘similarly you don’t know about this person’s publications’ and showed me five books containing six volumes in temporary bindings which had been published. They, the Kawatake Mokuami script series, had been published as articles by the Ginza’s Kabuki Shinpō [...] (Kabuki News) Company. They covered ‘Nakamitsu’, ‘Four Thousand Ryō‘ (...) (in Japanese) and ‘’. When I went I {{had no idea that}} they had been successively published and had been delivered from a Ginza bookstore. I leapt for joy and straight away started going to him and borrowing them so that I could indulge myself by reading them.|$|E

2500|$|Once Washington {{found out}} that Raguet had left Brazil, the State Department quickly worked to appoint someone new to repair any damage caused by Raguet and to {{continue}} working on solving the issues with Brazil that had led Raguet to leave. Adams would later write that relations between the United States and Brazil were [...] "aggravated by the rashness and intemperance of Condy Raguet, ... brought this country and Brazil to the very verge of war." [...] On Raguet's return to the United States he held a meeting with Clay and Adams who said [...] "I told him that my opinion of his integrity, patriotism, and zeal was unimpaired; that I was convinced of the purity of his motives to the step he had taken; <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> thought {{it would have been}} better if he had, before taking that step, consulted his government." [...] When Raguet was suggested for another ambassadorial position in 1828 Adams felt that while Raguet's motives were good he felt putting someone with [...] "such a temper and want of judgment, who took blustering for bravery and insolence for energy, was too dangerous." ...|$|E
2500|$|After being {{discharged}} from his duties in the Navy, as a seaman first class in August 1946, Coltrane returned to Philadelphia, where he [...] "plunged into the heady {{excitement of the}} new music and the blossoming bebop scene." [...] After touring with King Kolax, he joined a Philly-based band led by Jimmy Heath, who was introduced to Coltrane's playing by his former Navy buddy, the trumpeter William Massey, who had played with Coltrane in the Melody Masters. In Philadelphia after the war, he studied jazz theory with guitarist and composer Dennis Sandole and continued under Sandole's tutelage through the early 1950s. Originally an altoist, in 1947 Coltrane also began playing tenor saxophone with the Eddie Vinson Band. Coltrane later referred to {{this point in his}} life as a time when [...] "a wider area of listening opened up for me. There were many things that people like Hawk , and Ben [...] and Tab Smith were doing in the '40s that I didn't understand, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> felt emotionally." [...] A significant influence, according to tenor saxophonist Odean Pope, was the Philadelphia pianist, composer, and theorist Hasaan Ibn Ali. [...] "Hasaan was the clue to ... the system that Trane uses. Hasaan was the great influence on Trane’s melodic concept." ...|$|E
