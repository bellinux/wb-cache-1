5|$|A test {{session was}} held on May 17 and 18 at the Paul Ricard circuit in France, with the track {{configured}} to replicate {{the characteristics of the}} Circuit Gilles Villeneuve for the final two days after {{it had been in the}} style of the Monaco for the first two. Despite the fact that the McLaren team had dominated on the Monaco set up of the circuit, Ferrari were <b>better</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Canadian set up.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{configuration}} of the Circuit de Monaco, with its low average speed and abundance of low-speed corners, allied to the low-grip nature of the public road surface, the teams all set their cars up to produce the maximum amount of downforce and mechanical grip possible. Benetton modified their car's suspensions to work <b>better</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> circuit's low-speed corners. The Minardi cars came equipped with a new titanium cast gearbox and new rear suspensions. McLaren brought an additional spare car to the event, with four in total being shared between Häkkinen and Coulthard.|$|E

5|$|Football on the Pacific Coast {{had been}} on the rise since the late 1910s. Early in 1922, Warner signed a {{contract}} with Stanford University in which he would begin coaching in 1924 (after his contract with Pitt expired). Health concerns, a significant pay raise and the rising status of Pacific Coast football made Warner make the big change. Years later, he wrote:I felt my health would be <b>better</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Pacific coast. Weather conditions at Pittsburgh during the football season are rather disagreeable, and much of the late season work had to be done upon a field which was ankle deep in mud. At the close of every season I would be in poor physical condition, twice being rendered incapable of coaching while I recuperated in a hospital. Doctors advised me that the climate of the Pacific coast would be much better for a man of my age and in the work in which I was engaged.|$|E

5|$|The Gamezebo {{reviewer}} {{had special}} {{praise for the}} game's sound design {{and how it was}} used to clue the player into puzzle solutions. TouchArcade commended how the game's sparse story unfolded by watching the assassination targets go about their time at the compound. The reviewer also noted that his suspension of disbelief was broken when characters would eventually return to partying after reacting to a gunshot, but suggested that the game's Easter eggs redeemed its psychopathic qualities. Pocket Gamer wrote that the game did not reach the heights of the series' situational humor in hiding bodies stealthily. Other criticism included Gamezebo, which blamed the game's core multiplier ability for breaking the balance of the game. TouchArcade thought that the game played <b>better</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> tablet iPad than on the smaller iPhone, and praised the feature that synced game progress, since Apple's iCloud service was known for its struggle to successfully implement the same feature. Despite Square Enix Montreal being best known for its Go series, Hitman: Sniper was the studio's biggest revenue generator. As its most lucrative title, the game helped to fund the development of the Go series.|$|E
5|$|Worldwide, {{the game}} sold nearly two million units {{in its first}} three weeks of release, and had sold 2.5 million {{by the end of}} September 2009. According to NPD Group, Batman: Arkham Asylum sold {{approximately}} 593,000 units in North America during the five tracked days following its release on August 25. By December 2009, the PlayStation 3 version of the game had outsold the Xbox 360 version by approximately 10,000 units despite multi-platform titles typically selling <b>better</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Xbox 360 at the time. The exclusive content featuring the Joker as a playable character was cited as a possible reason for the success of the PlayStation 3 version. The game took two of the top five spots on the US software chart in its first week of release, and topped the UK all-format chart for two weeks.|$|E

25|$|In 2013, Blackhawk High School offered 15 Advanced Placement (AP) courses, at {{a higher}} cost than regular courses. The student pays the fee for the exam, which was $89 per test per pupil in 2012. Students {{have the option of}} taking College Board-approved courses and then taking the board's {{examination}} in the spring. Students who achieve a 3 or <b>better</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> exam may be awarded college credits at US universities and colleges. Each higher education institution sets its own standards about what level of credits are awarded to a student based on their AP exam score. Most give credits for scores of 4 or 5. Some also give credits for scores of 3. High schools give credits towards graduation to students who take the school's AP class. At Blackhawk High School 66% of students who took an AP course earned a 3 or <b>better</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> exam.|$|E

25|$|Corvettes {{commissioned}} by the Royal Canadian Navy during the Second World War were named after communities for the most part, to better represent the people {{who took part in}} building them. This idea was put forth by Admiral Percy W. Nelles. Sponsors were commonly associated with the community for which the ship was named. Royal Navy corvettes were designed as open sea escorts, while Canadian corvettes were developed for coastal auxiliary roles, as exemplified by their minesweeping gear. Eventually the Canadian corvettes were modified to allow them to perform <b>better</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> open seas.|$|E
