500|$|Hornsby {{started playing}} {{baseball}} {{at a very}} young age; he once said, [...] "I can't remember anything that happened <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> baseball in my hand." [...] He took a job with the Swift and Company meat industry plant as a messenger boy when he was 10 years old, and he also served as a substitute infielder on its baseball team. By the age of 15, Hornsby was already playing for several semi-professional teams. He also played baseball for North Side High School until 10th grade, when he dropped out to take a full-time job at Swift and Company. While he was in high school, Hornsby also played on the football team, alongside future College Football Hall of Famer Bo McMillin.|$|E
2500|$|In March 2009, M.C. Hammer and Vanilla Ice had a one-off {{concert in}} the McKay Events Center, Orem, Utah. This concert aided in the {{promotion}} of Hammer's new music and television show. During the concert (as shown during an episode of Hammertime), it was mentioned between the two rappers that this was their first headline show together in nearly 20 years, since {{the time when they}} were touring together at the peak of their hip-hop careers. Hammer said: [...] "Contrary to popular belief, Ice and I are not only cool with each other, we are like long lost friends. I've known him since he was 16, before he had a record contract and <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> record contract. It is a great reunion." [...] Vanilla Ice, real name Robert Van Winkle, said: [...] "It's like no time has passed at all. We set the world on fire back in the day - it gives me goose bumps to think about. The concert wouldn't have been so packed if it wasn't us together. I'm so happy right now, the magic is here." ...|$|E
60|$|It {{was some}} little time <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> {{chance to speak}} to him. But finally he saw me and came forward.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he said, [...] "I can't help {{thinking}} that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> come across you somewhere <b>before.</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> good memory for faces, and yours is familiar." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "All right," [...] {{said the}} clerk. [...] "We've had cadets stop here <b>before.</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> big {{room on the}} second floor, with two large beds in it. Will that do?" ...|$|R
60|$|In {{point of}} fact, <b>I</b> met Strickland <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> been <b>a</b> {{fortnight}} in Paris.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, I am only twenty-eight. You know I {{was only}} a brevet Major, and had two more steps to get <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> regimental majority." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{is strong}} stuff," [...] he said apologetically, [...] "and I never drank spirits without water <b>before.</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> glass of grog-and-water {{on board a}} ship sometimes, but {{it has always been}} at least two parts of water to one of spirits." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, of course, Mr. Cuthbert," [...] she answered, <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> {{chance to}} say {{anything}} more. [...] "You were in great danger of perishing before the men got to you, and nobody seemed to think of any way to give you immediate relief. And don't you think that a collegiate education {{is a good thing}} for girls--at least, that it was for me?" ...|$|E
60|$|Incommunicative as he was, {{some time}} elapsed <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>an</b> {{opportunity}} of gauging his mind. I first {{got an idea}} of its calibre when I heard him preach in his own church at Morton. I wish I could describe that sermon: but it is past my power. I cannot even render faithfully the effect it produced on me.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not exactly, yet," [...] I said. [...] "I {{want to do}} {{some good}} in the world--something--something effectual, <b>before</b> <b>I</b> die. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> sort of idea my {{scientific}} work--I don't know." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My {{conscience}} {{was very}} much pleased with me," [...] was the answer. [...] "What I did was a stratagem, and perfectly fair too. If <b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{found that it was}} right for you to see Junius, <b>I</b> would <b>have</b> done everything <b>I</b> could to help you communicate with him. But when I did at last see him, down you swooped upon us <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>an</b> opportunity of saying a word about you." ...|$|R
60|$|However, it was {{not long}} after my Arrival in England <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> Commission given me by King James, to be a Lieutenant in a new rais'd Regiment under the Command of Colonel Tufton, Brother to the Earl of Thanet. Under this Commission I sojourn'd out two peaceable Campaigns on Hounslow-Heath; where I was an Eye-Witness of one mock Siege of Buda: After which our Regiment was order'd to Berwick, where I {{remained}} till the Revolution.|$|E
6000|$|... "Tell Uncle John I {{have left}} {{the key to his}} trunk on the mantel, behind the picture of the madonna. I stuffed papers into Arthur's trouser leg to deceive him if he came back <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> chance to escape. But I hoped you would {{discover}} nothing until you read this letter, for I wanted to surprise you. Have I? Then I am content. You tricked me once; but I have tricked you at the last, and the final triumph is mine.|$|E
6000|$|... "After this I cast {{about for}} another subject, {{but failed to}} procure a live one. It {{occurred}} to me, however, that I might try my hand on two skeletons that hung in our garret, so I got their heads off without delay, and gradually extracted every tooth in their jaws. As there were about sixty teeth, I think, in each pair, I felt myself much improved before the jaws were toothless. At last, I resolved {{to take advantage of}} the first opportunity that should offer, during my father's absence, to practise on the living subject. It was not long <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> chance.|$|E
60|$|This {{detained}} Mr. Laidlaw re infecta, and <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> written <b>a</b> page {{the pony}} {{came to the}} door; but wrote something after dinner.|$|R

6000|$|He told me I was wrong. 'For,' says he, 'madam, as <b>I</b> said <b>before,</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> {{wife and}} no wife, and 'twould be no sin {{to me to}} wish her hanged, if that were all.' 'I know nothing of your {{circumstances}} that way, sir,' said I; 'but it cannot be innocent to wish your wife dead.' 'I tell you,' says he again, 'she is a wife and no wife; you don't know what I am, or what she is.' ...|$|R
6000|$|It {{was easy}} for me, who knew of Newcome's {{relations}} with the squatters, to discover the signs of confusion in his countenance, as his eye first met mine. One who was not acquainted with the circumstances, most probably would have detected {{nothing out of the}} common way. It will be remembered that the [...] "'squire" [...] had no positive knowledge that I was acquainted with his previous visit to the mill; and it will be easy to see that he must have felt an itching and uneasy desire to ascertain that fact. A great deal depended on that circumstance; nor was it long <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> specimen of his art in sounding round the truth, with a view to relieve his mind.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yon's a thing I dinna' exactly ken, {{but when}} I was coming doon the road I heard {{a shot and}} saw ye break intil the wood. Weel, I thought the back o' it was the place for me, and I was follying the dyke, quiet and saircumspect, when a man jumped ower and took the heather. He had a stairt, but the brae was steep, and I was {{thinking}} it would no' be long <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> grup o' him when the polis cam' ower the dyke behind. Then I {{thought it might be}} better if I didna' interfere, and made for a bit glen that rins doon the fell. When I saw my chance I slippit oot and found the peat-hag." ...|$|E
60|$|In the meanwhile, I was {{innocent}} of any wrong being done me. For not only I knew no {{word of the}} Gaelic; but what with the long suspense of the waiting, and the scurry and strain of our two spirts of fighting, and more than all, the horror I had of some of my own share in it, the thing was no sooner over than I was glad to stagger to a seat. There was that tightness on my chest that I could hardly breathe; {{the thought of the}} two men I had shot sat upon me like a nightmare; and all upon a sudden, and <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> guess of what was coming, I began to sob and cry like any child.|$|E
6000|$|... "There is not {{the least}} reason, Cecilia, to be anxious about my prospects. I mean to be Sir Jervis Redwood's {{favorite}} <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> been <b>a</b> week in his service." ...|$|R
60|$|Upon serious {{consider}}ation, for indeed now I {{began to}} consider things very seriously, and never till now; I say, upon serious consideration, I resolved {{to tell him}} of it first; {{and it was not}} long <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>an</b> opportunity, for the very next day his brother went to London upon some business, and the family being out a-visiting, just as it had happened before, and as indeed was often the case, he came according to his custom, to spend an hour or two with Mrs. Betty.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, lady," [...] the man-at-arms said. [...] "I am neither knight nor esquire, but {{a simple}} soldier; but I take no {{presents}} for saving two maidens from capture and captivity. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> been <b>a</b> monk all my life, though now <b>a</b> man-at-arms. Never <b>before</b> <b>have</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>an</b> opportunity of doing aught of kindness for a woman, and I am {{glad that the}} chance has fallen in my way." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not exactly, {{but pretty}} nearly so," [...] said Will. [...] "I had entertained the belief, presumptuous if you will, that I could {{find my way}} {{in any part of}} the {{wilderness}} by means of a sextant and pocket compass, and, to say truth, I don't feel quite sure that I should have failed, but <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> sufficient opportunity of testing my powers, one of our baggage horses rolled down the bank of a creek and broke my sextant. In trying to save him I rolled down along with him and smashed my compass, so I have resigned the position of guide in favour of my friend here, who, being a native, seems to possess a mysterious power in the matter of finding his way." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't see how I'm {{going to}} eat breakfast," [...] said Anne rapturously. [...] "Breakfast seems so commonplace at such an {{exciting}} moment. I'd rather feast my eyes on that dress. I'm so glad that puffed sleeves are still fashionable. It did {{seem to me that}} I'd never get over it if they went out <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> dress with them. I'd never have felt quite satisfied, you see. It was lovely of Mrs. Lynde to give me the ribbon too. I feel that I ought {{to be a very good}} girl indeed. It's at times like this I'm sorry I'm not a model little girl; and I always resolve that I will be in future. But somehow it's hard to carry out your resolutions when irresistible temptations come. Still, I really will make an extra effort after this." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, there I was {{standing}} {{face to face}} with young Mr. Fox, and he grinning at me in a way that said just as plain as words could have done what a good time he'd have eating me. Goodness, I'm trembling even now to think of what he might have done <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> chance to wag my ear if he'd known that I was the one who led his grandfather into the trap where Mr. Man could get hold of him so easily! When he didn't even speak after I'd talked to him so sweetly the idea came into my head that perhaps I might jump right over his back and so get out of the hole in that way; but it seemed as if he must have known what was in my mind, for he said with another of his beastly grins: ...|$|E
40|$|Trying to {{remember}} {{is a form of}} forgetting. Memory fades, changes meaning, and disappears over time. While trying to find other ways to preserve stories about my family, {{it occurred to me that}} I could recreate what I remember in clay. I am creating collections of physical mementos of the memories that fill my head, focusing mainly on my childhood. Remembering is in itself an act of forgetting, and thus this is my memory preservation kit. I am recording memories of my family for posterity in clay <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> chance to forget...|$|R
5000|$|... "I've been {{promoting}} G Unit since <b>before</b> <b>I</b> even <b>had</b> <b>a</b> record deal," [...] says 50. [...] "All {{the music}} I {{put on the}} mixtape circuit was 50 Cent and G Unit." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>have</b> determined, therefore, to beat {{a retreat}} in time, and am {{actually}} looking out for some other nest in this great city where old English manners are still kept up, where French is neither eaten, drunk, danced, nor spoken, and {{where there are no}} fashionable families of retired tradesmen. This found, I will, like a veteran rat, hasten away <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> old house about my ears, bid a long, though a sorrowful adieu to my present abode, and leave the rival factions of the Lambs and the Trotters to divide the distracted empire of LITTLE BRITAIN.|$|R
6000|$|She met {{the men who}} {{addressed}} {{her with}} entire fearlessness and candor (she was afraid only of women in good clothes), speaking with the easy slanginess of a herder, using naturally and unconsciously the most picturesque phrases of the West. Her speech was incisive and unhesitating, yet not swift. She never chattered, but [...] "you bet" [...] and [...] "all right" [...] were authorized English so {{far as she was}} concerned. [...] "They say you can't beat this town anywhere for society, and I sure like the looks of what we've seen. Suppose we hang around this hotel for a while--not too long, for it's mighty expensive." [...] Here she smiled--a quick, flashing smile. [...] "You see, I can't get used to spending money--I'm afraid all the time I'll wake up. It's just like a dream I used to have of finding chink--I always came to <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> chance to handle it and see if it was real." ...|$|E
60|$|For {{a little}} while Reuel Gridley {{attended}} that school of ours. He was an elderly pupil; he was perhaps twenty-two or twenty-three years old. Then came the Mexican War and he volunteered. A company of infantry was raised in our town and Mr. Hickman, a tall, straight, handsome athlete of twenty-five, was made captain of it and had a sword by his side and a broad yellow stripe down the leg of his gray pants. And when that company marched {{back and forth through}} the streets in its smart uniform--which it did several times a day for drill--its evolutions were attended by all the boys whenever the school hours permitted. I can see that marching company yet, and I can almost feel again the consuming desire that I had to join it. But they had no use for boys of twelve and thirteen, and <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> chance in another war the desire to kill people to whom I had not been introduced had passed away.|$|E
60|$|A {{few years}} ago, {{if any one}} in Fleet street had said that the day would come when I would devote my time to trying to lose my reputation, I would have smiled incredulously. That was <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> reputation. To be as {{statistical}} as time will allow--for before I go to bed I have {{seven and a half}} yards of fiction to write--it took me fifteen years' hard work to acquire a reputation. For two years after that I worked as diligently to retain it, not being quite certain whether it was really there, and {{for the last five years}} I have done my best to get rid of it. Mr. R. L. Stevenson has a story of a dynamiter who tried in vain to leave an infernal machine anywhere. It was always returned to him as soon as he dropped it, or just as he was making off. My reputation is as difficult to lose. I have not given up the attempt yet, but I am already of opinion that it is even harder to lose a reputation in letters than to make one. My colleagues will bear me out in this.|$|E
