40|$|The {{phytoplankton}} genus Phaeocystis has well-documented, spatially and temporally extensive blooms of gelatinous colonies; {{these are}} associated with release of copious amounts of dimethyl sulphide (an important climate-cooling aerosol) and alterations of material flows among trophic levels and export from the upper ocean. A potentially salient property {{of the importance of}} Phaeocystis in the marine ecosystem is its physiological capability to transform between solitary cell and gelatinous colonial life cycle stages, a process that changes organism biovolume by 6 - 9 orders of magnitude, and which appears to be activated or stimulated under certain circumstances by chemical communication. Both life-cycle stages can exhibit rapid, phased ultradian growth. The colony skin apparently confers protection against, or at least reduces losses to, smaller zooplankton grazers and perhaps viruses. There are indications that Phaeocystis utilizes chemistry and/or changes in size as defenses against predation, and its ability to create refuges from biological attack is known to stabilize predator-prey dynamics in model systems. Thus the life cycle form in which it occurs, and particularly associated interactions with viruses, determines whether Phaeocystis production flows through the traditional "great fisheries" food chain, the more regenerative microbial food web, or is exported from the mixed layer of the ocean. Despite this plethora of information regarding the physiological ecology of Phaeocystis, fundamental interactions between life history traits and system ecology are poorly understood. Research summarized here, and described in the various papers in this special issue, derives from a central question: how do physical (light, temperature, particle distributions, hydrodynamics), chemical (nutrient resources, infochemistry, allelopathy), biological (grazers, viruses, bacteria, other phytoplankton), and self-organizational mechanisms (stability, indirect effects) interact with life-cycle transformations of Phaeocystis to mediate ecosystem patterns of trophic structure, biodiversity, and biogeochemical fluxes? Ultimately the goal is to understand and thus predict why Phaeocystis occurs when and where it does, and the <b>bio-feedbacks</b> between this keystone species and the multitrophic level ecosystem...|$|R
40|$|Den Ausgangspunkt der vorliegenden Arbeit bilden zum einen Befunde zur hohen Patientenakzeptanz des Biofeedbacks und zum anderen Nachweise der Migräneforschung hinsichtlich einer Überlegenheit der Biofeedbackmethode gegenüber kognitiv-behavioralen Ansätzen. Den theoretischen Hintergrund des zweiten Aspektes stellt die Annahme dar, dass bei Verfolgen eines somatischen Krankheitsmodells der Tinnitusentstehung vorausgehendes Biofeedback hilft, kognitive und emotionale Einflüsse auf Körperreaktionen zu erkennen. Dies begünstigt eine psychosomatische Sichtweise, die als geeigneten Ausgangspunkt für nachfolgende kognitive Methoden gilt. Mangels konkreter Nachweise der vielfach angenommenen Vorteile des <b>Bio-feedbacks,</b> wurde in der vorliegenden Arbeit erstmalig der differentielle Anteil dieses psychophysiolgischen Ansatzes am erwarteten Interventionseffekt unter-sucht. In der Tinnitusforschung findet sich bislang noch keine empirische Evi-denz für die {{relative}} Wirksamkeit des biofeedbackgestützten Relaxationstrain-ings im Vergleich zu einem rein kognitiv-behavioralen Vorgehen. Bei Annahme pathologischer Muskelverspannungen als Tinnitusverstärker wird von einer Beeinträchtigungsreduktion durch eine verbesserte Relaxationsfähig-keit als Copingstrategie ausgegangen. Hierfür wurden in einer kontrollierten und randomisierten Cross-over-Studie eine kognitiv-behaviorale Gruppeninterven-tion und ein Biofeedbacktraining im Einzelsetting kombiniert und gegenüberge-stellt. Forschungsberichten zufolge zeigen nämlich kognitiv-verhaltenstherapeu-tische Konzepte mit integriertem Relaxationstraining bei chronischem Tinnitus die höchsten Erfolgsraten. Die Wirksamkeitsprüfung der 12 -wöchigen Interven-tion erfolgte im ambulanten Setting an 112 Tinnitusbetroffenen, die als leicht-gradig chronisch beeinträchtigt gelten. Die Datenlage zeigt Verbesserungen hinsichtlich tinnitusspezifischer Symptome (Tinnitusfragebogen) und eingesetzter Bewältigungsstrategien. Bezüglich unter-suchter physiologischer Parameter ließen sich für den Bereich M. frontalis signi-fikante Spannungsreduktionen (EMG) von Sitzungsanfang bis -ende sowie von der ersten bis zur sechsten Biofeedbackeinheit nachweisen. Die Reduktion der Muskelanspannung für den EMG-frontalis in der ersten Sitzung erwies sich als prädiktionsstark für die Reduktion der Tinnitusbelastung. Nachgewiesen sind mit den Daten eine tendenzielle Überlegenheit der psychophysiologischen ge-genüber der kognitiv-verhaltensorientierten Methode sowie eine hohe Patienten-akzeptanz der biofeedbackgestützten Relaxationsintervention. Evaluation of a biofeedback-supported cognitive-behavioral {{intervention in}} chronic tinnitus The {{beginning of this}} present paper consists of two parts: On the one hand there are findings about a high patient acceptance regarding biofeedback {{and on the other}} hand there is evidence delivered by migraine research stating that the biofeedback-method is superior to cognitive-behavioral approaches. The theoretical background of the second aspect assumes that prior biofeedback helps in recognizing cognitive and emotional influences on body reactions when following the somatic disease model of tinnitus occurrence. This approach favors a psychosomatic view that is considered to be suitable for the following cognitive methods. Due to a lack of concrete evidence regarding the assumed advantages of biofeedback, we explored the differential share of this psychophysiological approach in the expected intervention effect in this paper for the very first time. Up to date, tinnitus research is not able to present empiric evidence for the relative effectiveness of biofeedback-supported relaxation training compared to a purely cognitive-behavioral procedure. When assuming that pathological muscle tension intensifies the occurrence of tinnitus, then a coping strategy - improving the patient’s relaxation ability –would reduce his/her impairment. A cognitive-behavioral group intervention and biofeedback training in single setting were combined in a controlled and randomized cross-over study and then compared. Research reports show that cognitive behavioral therapeutic concepts with integrated relaxation training have the highest success rates in cases of chronic tinnitus. The effectiveness test of the 12 -week long intervention took place in an outpatient setting and included 112 patients suffering from a light-chronic degree of tinnitus. The following is a summary of the findings: (1) The central statement of the study was that participating in the 12 -week long biofeedback-supported tinnitus coping training resulted in a treatment-specific reduction of the impairment caused by tinnitus, which remained constant over time. For both defined treatment elements, cognitive-behavioral unity in the group setting and biofeedback in the individual setting, evidence for efficacy was provided. (2) While there are positive changes in the ways of coping and handling with the impairment, no improvement regarding mood, sensibility towards noise and catastrophizing was detectable. (3) The increased relaxation ability during the course of the biofeedback-relaxation training is detectable in the physiological relaxation indicator EMG and can also be detected through electrodermal activity. In the area of the m. frontalis and m. masseter, there are significant tension reductions (EMG) from the beginning of the session to the end of the session as well as from the first to the sixth biofeedback unit. (4) In regards to the differential share of the biofeedback, there is empirical evidence for psychophysiological biofeedback training having the tendency of being superior to cognitive behavioral-oriented group programs. (5) For predicting the success of treatment, the degree of severity of tinnitus as well as the tension reduction in the area of the m. frontalis in the first biofeedback session with inclusion of the partial sample RF 2 (beginning with biofeedback) seem to be strong predictors. (6) All in all, biofeedback with its supporting function in cases of documented high patient acceptance presents itself as a very suitable treatment component when being part of an outpatient behavioral-therapeutic approach in chronic tinnitus. (7) A first proposal for future studies refers to the test design used in this case. A methodic alternative, which would help in avoiding a method deficit caused by cross-over design, would be the additional definition of two parallel intervention conditions with pure behavioral therapy as well as pure biofeedback training...|$|R
