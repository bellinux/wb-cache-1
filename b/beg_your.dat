500|$|Synth-pop {{continued}} into the late 1980s, with a format that moved closer to dance music, including the work of acts such as British duos Pet Shop Boys, Erasure and the Communards. The Communards' major hits were covers of disco classics [...] "Don't Leave Me This Way" [...] (1986) and [...] "Never Can Say Goodbye" [...] (1987). After adding other elements to their sound, {{and with the help}} of a gay audience, several synth-pop acts had success on the US dance charts. Among these were American acts Information Society who had two top 10 singles in 1988, Anything Box, and Red Flag. British band When In Rome scored a hit with their debut single [...] "The Promise". Several German synth-pop acts of the late 1980s included Camouflage, Cetu Javu, CCCP and Celebrate the Nun. Canadian duo Kon Kan had major success with their debut single, [...] "I <b>Beg</b> <b>Your</b> Pardon" [...] in 1989.|$|E

500|$|Supported by gentry and nobility in East Anglia and the Thames Valley, Mary's {{military}} {{camp was}} gathering strength daily and, through luck, came into possession of powerful artillery from the royal navy. In the circumstances the Duke deemed fighting a campaign hopeless. The army proceeded from Cambridge to Bury St Edmunds and retreated again to Cambridge. On 20 July {{a letter from}} the Council in London arrived, declaring that they had proclaimed Queen Mary and commanding Northumberland to disband the army and await events. Dudley did not contemplate resistance. He explained to his fellow-commanders that they had acted on the Council's orders all the time and that he did not now wish [...] "to combat the Council's decisions, supposing that they have been moved by good reasons ... and I <b>beg</b> <b>your</b> lordships to do the same." [...] Proclaiming Mary Tudor at the market place, he threw up his cap and [...] "so laughed that the tears ran down his cheeks for grief." [...] The next morning the Earl of Arundel arrived to arrest him. A week earlier Arundel had assured Northumberland of his wish to spill his blood even at the Duke's feet; now Dudley went down on his knees as soon as he caught sight of him.|$|E

2500|$|Dear Sir — Our earnest solicitude for {{the success}} of the Great Southern Rights {{movement}} to secure an immediate release from the overwhelming dangers that imperil our political and social safety, will we trust, be a sufficient apology for the results which we beg to impose on you. [...] The sentiment of the Southern heart is overwhelming in favor of the movement. Light only is wanted that men many see their way clearly and the prayer of every true patriot will eventually be realized. Tennessee will be a unit. Although the time be so very short, this object may yet be accomplished, if a few men only, (the more the better, however) in each county, will devote their entire energies to it during the canvass for Delegates.

2500|$|On another occasion, when Cao Pi {{was out on}} {{a hunting}} excursion, the fences built to trap the deer in an {{enclosed}} area were not properly secured so the deer broke through the fences and escaped. Cao Pi was so furious that he drew his sword and wanted to execute his servants. Su Ze knelt down and pleaded with him to spare the servants, saying, [...] "Your Majesty, I heard that the sage-rulers of ancient times would not harm people {{for the sake of}} animals. Now, Your Majesty wishes to promote the culture of Yao's time, yet Your Majesty wants to execute so many people just because a hunting excursion went wrong. I don't think this is something Your Majesty should do. With my life, I <b>beg</b> <b>Your</b> Majesty to spare these people." [...] Cao Pi replied, [...] "You're a subject who speaks his mind." [...] He then spared all his servants. Since then, Cao Pi became more wary of Su Ze because he knew that Su Ze would not hesitate to speak up and criticise him if he did something wrong.|$|E
2500|$|When Mary {{is brought}} in by Talbot, Elizabeth reacts with hostility (È sempre la stessa: superba, orgogliosa / She is always the same, proud, overbearing") and, after each {{character}} collectively expresses his or her feelings, Mary approaches and kneels before the Queen (Aria: Morta al mondo, ab! morta al trono / [...] "Dead to the world, and dead to the throne… I come to <b>beg</b> <b>your</b> pardon"). The confrontation soon becomes hostile. Elizabeth accuses Mary of having murdered her husband, Lord Darnley, as well as acts of treason and debauchery, all the while Leicester attempting to calm both sides. Stung by Elizabeth's false accusations, Mary calls her the Figlia impura di Bolena ("Impure daughter of Boleyn") and continues with the final insult: Profanato è il soglio inglese, vil bastarda, dal tuo piè! ("The English throne is sullied, vile bastard, by your foot"). Elizabeth is horrified and demands that the guards take Mary away, declaring [...] "The axe that awaits you will show my revenge". Mary is returned to captivity.|$|E
2500|$|When {{there were}} rumours that Sun He {{could no longer}} secure his {{position}} as Crown Prince, Lu Xun wrote a memorial to Sun Quan: [...] "The Crown Prince is the legitimate heir apparent so he should have a foundation as solid as hard rock. The Prince of Lu is a vassal and a subject of the state, so he should receive less favours than the Crown Prince. If both of them know their places, Your Majesty and all your subjects will have peace. I humbly kowtow and <b>beg</b> <b>Your</b> Majesty, {{to the point of}} bleeding (from my forehead), to (re)consider this issue carefully." [...] He wrote several memorials to Sun Quan and even requested to leave Wuchang (武昌; present-day Ezhou, Hubei) and go to the capital to speak up on this problem. Sun Quan denied him permission. Lu Xun's maternal nephews Gu Tan, Gu Cheng (顧承) and Yao Xin (姚信), who supported Sun He during the succession struggle, were sent into exile. Wu Can, the Crown Prince's Tutor (太子太傅), who had been exchanging letters with Lu Xun, was imprisoned and later executed.|$|E

2500|$|Brian devoted some Pet Sounds {{sessions}} to avant-garde indulgences {{such as an}} extended a cappella run-through of the children's song [...] "Row, Row, Row Your Boat" [...] that exploited the song's use of rounds. Humorous skits and sound effects were recorded {{in an attempt to}} create a psychedelic comedy album, foreshadowing much of his work on Smile, which was set to have followed Pet Sounds. The only product of these sessions present in Pet Sounds was an excerpt of Brian's dogs barking accompanied by a recording of passing trains, which was sampled from the 1963 sound effects LP Mister D's Machine. Brian may also have briefly considered recording other animal sounds for inclusion, as evidenced by a snippet of surviving studio chatter from a [...] "dog barking" [...] session. This features Brian asking studio engineer Chuck Britz: [...] "Hey, Chuck, is it possible we can bring a horse in here without... if we don't screw everything up?", to which a clearly startled Britz responds, [...] "I <b>beg</b> <b>your</b> pardon?", with Brian then pleading, [...] "Honest to God, now, the horse is tame and everything!" ...|$|E
