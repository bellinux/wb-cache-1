5|$|The monastery at Wearmouth-Jarrow had an {{excellent}} library. Both Benedict Biscop and Ceolfrith had acquired <b>books</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Continent, and in Bede's day the monastery was a renowned centre of learning.

5|$|Although Clinch {{believed}} that the evidence pointed to the twins having genuinely existed but that they {{had lived in the}} 16th century, rather than the early 12th century as generally claimed, they are not mentioned in any journals or <b>books</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> period. This points against their having lived in the 16th century; the case of Lazarus and Joannes Baptista Colloredo (1617– after1646) had prompted great interest in conjoined twins, and conjoined sisters surviving to adulthood in south east England would have been widely noted.|$|E

5|$|Anne Rice (born Howard Allen Frances O'Brien; October 4, 1941) is an American {{author of}} gothic fiction, Christian literature, and erotica. She {{is perhaps best}} known for her series of novels, The Vampire Chronicles, {{revolving}} around the central character of Lestat. <b>Books</b> <b>from</b> <b>The</b> Vampire Chronicles were the subject of two film adaptations, Interview with the Vampire in 1994, and Queen of the Damned in 2002.|$|E
5|$|Daenerys voices {{her fear}} of the barbarian lord, but her brother tells her to marry him. During the wedding ceremony, Daenerys is given two wedding gifts. The first is a {{collection}} of <b>books</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Seven Kingdoms, given by Ser Jorah Mormont, an exiled knight loyal to the Targaryens. The second gift is a chest containing three petrified dragon eggs, given by Magister Illyrio Mopatis, the man who helped arrange the marriage.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to her vampire novels, Rice has authored books such as The Feast of All Saints (adapted for television in 2001) and Servant of the Bones, which {{formed the basis of}} a 2011 comic book miniseries. Several <b>books</b> <b>from</b> <b>The</b> Vampire Chronicles have been adapted as comics by various publishers. Rice has also authored erotic fiction under the pen names Anne Rampling and A.N.Roquelaure, including Exit to Eden, which was later adapted into a 1994 film.|$|E

5|$|When Google Books started, the British Library {{signed an}} {{agreement}} with Microsoft to digitise a number of <b>books</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> British Library for its Live Search Books project.

5|$|Between 1893 and 1897, {{the years}} when Bauer and Nold were also in the Western Penitentiary for their part in the {{assassination}} attempt, the three men surreptitiously produced 60 issues of a hand-written anarchist newsletter by transferring their work from cell to cell. They managed to send the completed newsletters, which they called Prison Blossoms, to friends outside the prison. Participating in Prison Blossoms, initially written in German and later in English, helped Berkman improve his English. He developed a friendship with the prison chaplain, John Lynn Milligan, who was a strong advocate {{on behalf of the}} prison library. Milligan encouraged Berkman to read <b>books</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> library, a process that furthered his knowledge of English.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the spread}} of such ideas was {{forbidden}} in the Spanish territories, as was the sale of related books or their unauthorized possession. Spain instituted those bans when it declared war on France after the execution of LouisXVI and retained them after the peace treaty of 1796. News {{of the events of}} 1789 and copies of the publications of the French Revolution spread around Spain despite efforts to keep them at bay. Many enlightened criollos came into contact with liberal authors and their works during their university studies, either in Europe or at the University of Chuquisaca (modern Sucre). <b>Books</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> United States found their way into the Spanish colonies through Caracas, owing to the proximity of Venezuela to the United States and the West Indies.|$|E

5|$|In 1153 the Jin emperor Wanyan Liang {{moved the}} empire's capital from Huining Prefecture in {{northern}} Manchuria (south of present-day Harbin) to Zhongdu (now Beijing). Four {{years later in}} 1157 he razed Beijing, including the nobles’ residences, and moved the Jin's southern capital from Beijing to Kaifeng. It was here at the former seat of the Song dynasty that he began a large project of reconstruction (since the siege against it in 1127). For much of his reign there was peace between Jin and Song, while both states upheld an uninterrupted flow of commercial trade between each other. While amassing tribute from the Southern Song, the Jin dynasty also imported large amounts of tea, rice, sugar, and <b>books</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Southern Song. However, Wanyan Liang reopened the Jin dynasty's armed conflict with the Song by the 1160s.|$|E
5|$|In Malaysia, {{a similar}} price war caused {{controversy}} regarding {{sales of the}} book. Four of the biggest bookstore chains in Malaysia, MPH Bookstores, Popular Bookstores, Times and Harris, decided to pull Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows off their shelves as a protest against Tesco and Carrefour hypermarkets. The retail price of the book in Malaysia is MYR 109.90, while the hypermarkets Tesco and Carrefour sold the book at MYR 69.90. The move by the bookstores {{was seen as an}} attempt to pressure the distributor Penguin Books to remove the <b>books</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> hypermarkets. However, as of 24 July 2007, the price war has ended, with the four bookstores involved resuming selling the books in their stores with discount. Penguin Books has also confirmed that Tesco and Carrefour are selling the book at a loss, urging them to practice good business sense and fair trade.|$|E
5|$|Lions {{continue}} to be featured in modern literature, from the messianic Aslan in The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe and following <b>books</b> <b>from</b> <b>The</b> Chronicles of Narnia series written by C. S. Lewis, to the comedic Cowardly Lion in The Wonderful Wizard of Oz. The advent of moving pictures saw the continued presence of lion symbolism; {{one of the most}} iconic and widely recognised lions is Leo the Lion, which has been the mascot for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) studios since the 1920s. The 1960s saw the appearance of what is possibly the most famous lioness, the Kenyan animal Elsa in the movie Born Free, based on the true-life book of the same title. The lion's role as king of the beasts has been used in cartoons, such as the 1994 Disney animated feature film The Lion King.|$|E

Memer disguises herself as a boy and goes to meet Iorath, where she learns that the troop is not an army, but only carries a message. She returns to Galvamand with an offer from them to make Ansul a protectorate, rather than a colony. Memer gifts Orrec one of the <b>books</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> secret room, and she and Sulter decide to make a library with the books there. After a conversation with Gry, Memer decides to travel with her and Orrec for a while.|$|E
5|$|The King's School, Canterbury claims Augustine as its founder, {{which would}} make it the world's oldest {{existing}} school, but the first documentary records of the school date from the 16th century. Augustine did establish a school, and soon after his death Canterbury was able to send teachers out to support the East Anglian mission. Augustine received liturgical <b>books</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> pope, but their exact contents are unknown. They may have been some of the new mass books that were being written at this time. The exact liturgy that Augustine introduced to England remains unknown, {{but it would have been}} a form of the Latin language liturgy in use at Rome.|$|E
5|$|The National Library of Somalia was {{established}} in 1975, and came under {{the responsibility of the}} Ministry of Education, Culture and Higher Education. In 1983, it held approximately 7,000 books, {{little in the way of}} historical and cultural archival material, and was open to the general public. The National Library later closed down in the 1990s. In June 2013, the Heritage Institute for Policy Studies organized a shipment of 22,000 <b>books</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> United States to Somalia as part of an initiative to restock the library. In December of the year, the Somali authorities officially launched a major project to rebuild the National Library. With Zainab Hassan serving as Director, the $1 million federal government funded initiative will see a new library complex built in the capital within six months. In preparation for the relaunch, 60,000 additional books from other Arab League states are expected to arrive.|$|E
