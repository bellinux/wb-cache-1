50|$|Where the {{existing}} busy-hour carried traffic, Ec, is measured on an already-overloaded system, {{with a significant}} level of blocking, {{it is necessary to}} take account of the <b>blocked</b> <b>calls</b> in estimating the busy-hour offered traffic Eo (which is the traffic value {{to be used in the}} Erlang formula). The offered traffic can be estimated by Eo = Ec/(1 &minus; Pb). For this purpose, where the system includes a means of counting <b>blocked</b> <b>calls</b> and successful calls, Pb can be estimated directly from the proportion of calls that are blocked. Failing that, Pb can be estimated by using Ec in place of Eo in the Erlang formula and the resulting estimate of Pb can then be used in Eo = Ec/(1 &minus; Pb) to estimate Eo. Another method of estimating Eo in an overloaded system is to measure the busy-hour call arrival rate, λ (counting successful calls and <b>blocked</b> <b>calls),</b> and the average call-holding time (for successful calls), h, and then estimate Eo using the formula E = λh.|$|E

50|$|The term is {{typically}} used with mobile telephony systems, {{in which there}} are simply not enough radio channels available in a given cell or cells. This causes <b>blocked</b> <b>calls</b> or dropped calls. However, it can also apply to landline phones, in which not enough trunking telephone circuits are available into and out of any given telephone exchange or equivalent switching office at any level of the public switched telephone network (PSTN).|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to steam service disruption to 15-20 buildings, telephone service and Internet connectivity were disrupted in the area. Although an underground electrical transformer and feeder cables were also damaged, {{there were no}} significant power outages reported, but customers in the affected area were asked to reduce demand. Cellular telephone service was overloaded in the immediate aftermath, and <b>blocked</b> <b>calls</b> were reported as many people in the area tried to make calls at the same time.|$|E
50|$|The Erlang distribution, which {{measures}} {{the time between}} incoming calls, {{can be used in}} conjunction with the expected duration of incoming calls to produce information about the traffic load measured in erlangs. This can be used to determine the probability of packet loss or delay, according to various assumptions made about whether <b>blocked</b> <b>calls</b> are aborted (Erlang B formula) or queued until served (Erlang C formula). The Erlang-B and C formulae are still in everyday use for traffic modeling for applications such as the design of call centers.|$|E

50|$|This also {{affected}} international {{calls from the}} rest of the world, because carriers using least-cost routing, especially in the United States, routed calls to Gibraltar via Spain, which prevented calls dialled using the +350 code from terminating in Gibraltar. Consequently, the caller would hear a recorded announcement saying that the number dialled did not exist. Even when calls routed via Spain were allowed to terminate in Gibraltar, under the 'sender keeps all' arrangement, Telefónica in Spain was able to keep revenue from these calls, instead of paying Gibtelecom's international termination charges. Although all other countries and territories recognised the +350 dialling code, not all networks <b>blocked</b> <b>calls</b> to Gibraltar from being made using Spain's +34 9567 code, which allowed subscribers to call Gibraltar for the cost of a call to Spain.|$|E
5000|$|There was an {{additional}} problem facing the newly combined company: {{prior to the}} merger, Nextel Communications had been issued a government mandate to reduce interference caused by its cellular network with public safety radio systems. It was to do so via a process termed [...] "re-banding." [...] As {{a side effect of}} this [...] "re-banding," [...] however, Nextel's iDEN network would lose valuable 800 MHz spectrum, causing the network to face significant capacity challenges. Simultaneously, Boost Mobile, a prepaid MVNO that operated on Nextel's network, was beginning to skyrocket in popularity, placing an even greater burden on the iDEN system. This eventually manifested itself in a decrease in Nextel customers' call quality in certain markets—dropped calls, <b>blocked</b> <b>calls,</b> and bad voice quality all began to be reported in various cities in 2006.|$|E

5000|$|The Erlang C formula {{expresses the}} {{probability}} that an arriving customer will need to queue (as opposed to immediately being served). Just as the Erlang B formula, Erlang C assumes an infinite population of sources, which jointly offer traffic of A erlangs to N servers. However, if all the servers are busy when a request arrives from a source, the request is queued. An unlimited number of requests may {{be held in the}} queue in this way simultaneously. This formula calculates the probability of queuing offered traffic, assuming that <b>blocked</b> <b>calls</b> stay in the system until they can be handled. This formula is used to determine the number of agents or customer service representatives needed to staff a call centre, for a specified desired probability of queuing. However, the Erlang C formula assumes that callers never hang up while in queue, which makes the formula predict that more agents should be used than are really needed to maintain a desired service level.) ...|$|E

30|$|The PTS method (red stem) {{starts to}} reduce the <b>blocked</b> <b>calls</b> after {{detecting}} them; therefore, the UDR decreases as well. Nevertheless, due to the traffic fluctuations, peaks of UDR are obtained. Thanks to this mechanism, the average UDR is reduced to about 4 %.

Hence, although the indicator is improved, BR is not the proper input to optimize these situations.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Call {{admission}} control algorithms that reduce dropped calls in CDMA cellular systems {{are discussed in}} this paper. The capacity of a CDMA system is confined by inter-ference of users from {{both inside and outside}} of the target cell. Earlier algorithms for call {{admission control}} is based on the effective traffic load for the target cell if one call is accepted. These algorithms ignore the interference effect of the to-be-accepted call on the neighboring cells. In our algo-rithms, the call admission decision is based on the effective traffic loads for both the target cell and the neighboring cells. In addition, to prioritize handoff calls, we also introduce the idea of soft guard channel, which reserves some traffic load exclusively for handoff calls. Stochastic reward net (SRN) models are constructed to compare the performance of the algorithms. The numerical results show that our algorithms can significantly reduce the dropped calls with a price of in-creasing the <b>blocked</b> <b>calls.</b> To show the potential gain due to our algorithms, we introduce two new metrics: the in-creased blocking ratio for our algorithms and the increased dropping ratio for the conventional algorithms. From the nu-merical results, it is shown that our algorithms can reduce the dropped calls significantly while the <b>blocked</b> <b>calls</b> are in-creased at a relatively small rate under both homogeneous and hot spot traffic loads...|$|E
