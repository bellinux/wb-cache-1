40|$|A {{combined}} numerical {{and experimental}} investigation is {{performed on the}} fundamental aspects of tip vortex formation and convection mechanisms for a two bladed rotor. The paper is focused on identifying similarities and differences in the near wake fields caused by blade tip geometry modification. Two different configurations are investigated. The first one corresponds to a square blade tip while the second one corresponds to a rounded <b>blade</b> <b>tip</b> <b>cap.</b> PIV measurements of the crossflow velocities around the forming tip vortex were performed for a forward flight regime characterized by a 0. 1 advance ratio. RANS simulations of the rotor flow were conducted for the same rotor configurations as used in the experimental tests but considering only the hover regime. Both experimental and numerical tests confirm {{that there is a}} qualitative difference in the tip vortex formation and evolution between the square blade tip and rounded blade tip configurations. This qualitative change is shown in the velocity distributions measured and computed around and downstream of the tip. It is explained by the differences in the flow separation identified for the two configurations...|$|E
40|$|To improve {{gas turbine}} performance, the {{operating}} temperature has been increased continuously. However, the heat {{transferred to the}} turbine blade is substantially increased as the turbine inlet temperature is increased. Cooling methods are therefore much needed for the turbine blades to ensure a long durability and safe operation. The blade tip region is exposed to the hot gas flows and is difficult to cool. A common way to cool the tip is to use serpentine passages with a 180 turn under the <b>blade</b> <b>tip</b> <b>cap</b> {{taking advantage of the}} three-dimensional turning effect and impingement. Increasing internal convective cooling is however required to increase the blade tip life. In this article, enhanced heat transfer of a blade tip has been investigated numerically. The computational models consist of a two-pass channel with a 180 turn and arrays of pin-fins mounted on the tip-cap, and a smooth two-pass channel. Inlet Reynolds numbers range from 100, 000 to 600, 000. The computations are 3 -D, steady, and incompressible. The detailed 3 -D fluid flow and heat transfer over the tip surfaces are presented. The overall performance of the two models is evaluated. It is found that due to the combination of turning, impingement, and pin-fin crossflow the heat transfer coefficient of the pin-finned tip might be a factor of 1. 84 higher than that of a smooth tip. This augmentation is achieved at the expense of a penalty of pressure drop around 35 %. It is suggested that the pin-fins could be used to enhance blade tip heat transfer and cooling...|$|E

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation was}} made to evaluate the durability and permeability {{of a group of}} transpiration-cooled, strut-supported turbine blades. The porous shells were formed from a woven-wire material. The blades were fabricated by a contractor for the Bureau of Aeronautics. The results of permeability tests indicated that the shell material exhibited large random variations in local permeability, which result in excessive coolant flows and very nonuniform cooling. For this reason no heat-transfer evaluations were made because any results would have been inconclusive. Four blades were investigated for structural soundness in a turbo-jet engine operating at a turbine-inlet temperature of approximately 1670 deg F and a turbine tip speed of approximately 1305 feet per second. The maximum temperature of the porous-shell material was approximately 1050 deg F. Inspection of the first two blades after 10 minutes of engine operation revealed that the tips of both of the blades had failed. For the second pair of <b>blades,</b> an improved <b>tip</b> <b>cap</b> was provided by the use of built-up weld extending from strut tip to shell.

The wingtips were tested separately (wingtip only configuration) and while mounted on a semi-span wing. The quarter-chord sweep angle of the wing was varied from 30 deg forward sweep, to unswept, to 30 deg. aft sweep. Wingtip loading was obtained from a six component strainguage balance mounted in the wingtip.

40|$|AbstractThe tip leakage flow has an {{important}} influence {{on the performance of}} transonic compressor. <b>Blade</b> <b>tip</b> winglet has been proved to be an effective method to control the tip leakage flow in compressor, while the physical mechanisms of <b>blade</b> <b>tip</b> winglet have been poorly understood. A numerical study for a highly loaded transonic compressor rotor has been conducted to understand the effect of varying the location of <b>blade</b> <b>tip</b> winglet on the performance of the rotor. Two kinds of tip winglet were designed and investigated. The effects of <b>blade</b> <b>tip</b> winglet on the compressor overall performance, stability and tip flow structure were presented and discussed.

40|$|To {{clarify the}} {{behavior}} of the <b>blade</b> <b>tip</b> vortices of a wind turbine equipped with a brimmed-diffuser shroud, called a &# 8220;Wind-Lens turbine&# 8221;, we conducted a three-dimensional numerical simulation using a large eddy simulation (LES). Since this unique wind turbine consists of not only rotating blades but also a diffuser shroud with a broad-ring brim at the exit periphery, the flow field around the turbine is highly complex and unsteady. Previously, our research group conducted numerical simulations using an actuator-disc approximation, in which the rotating blades were simply modeled as an external force on the fluid. Therefore, the detailed flow patterns around the rotating blades and the shroud, including the <b>blade</b> <b>tip</b> vortices, could not be simulated. Instead of an actuator-disc approximation, we used a moving boundary technique in the present CFD simulation to simulate the flow around a rotating blade in order to focus especially on <b>blade</b> <b>tip</b> vortices. The simulation results showed a pair of vortices consisting of a <b>blade</b> <b>tip</b> vortex and a counter-rotating vortex which was generated between the <b>blade</b> <b>tip</b> and the inner surface of the diffuser.

40|$|Abstract: The {{application}} of improved <b>blade</b> <b>tip</b> geometries is studied {{with the aim}} of identifying an effective design concept for industrial fan passive noise control. The concept developed opti-mizes a datum blade by means of profiled endplates at the tip, reducing fan noise by changing the tip leakage flow behaviour. Experimental and computational investigations have been carried out on a family of axial fans, in fully ducted configuration, to establish the aerodynamic merits of the proposed <b>blade</b> <b>tip</b> design concept. The flow mechanisms in the fan tip region are correlated to specific blade design features that promote a reduction of the fan aero-acoustic signature in both tonal and broadband noise components. The tip vortical flow structures are characterized, and their role in creation of overall stage acoustic emissions clarified. The reported research identifies modification of tip geometry as markedly affecting the multiple vortex behaviour of <b>blade</b> <b>tip</b> leakage flow by altering the near-wall fluid flow paths on both <b>blade</b> surfaces. <b>Blade</b> <b>tip</b> endplates were also demonstrated to influence the rotor loss behaviour in the <b>blade</b> <b>tip</b> region.

40|$|Active rotor control concepts, such {{as active}} twist actuation, have the {{potential}} to effectively reduce the noise and vibrations of helicopter rotors. Within the STAR (Smart Twisting Active Rotor) hover test, an active twist rotor was tested in the rotor preparation hall at DLR Braunschweig. The rotor blades were actuated with frequencies of 1 /rev – 5 /rev and peak torsion amplitudes of up to 2 °. This paper describes aerodynamic results from the hover test based on time-resolved stereoscopic PIV measurements at the forward <b>blade</b> <b>tip</b> position. Continuous time series of flow fields behind the <b>blade</b> <b>tips</b> were evaluated to investigate the young <b>blade</b> <b>tip</b> vortices between 3. 56 ° and 45. 74 ° of vortex age. For the unactuated baseline case, the vortex trajectory, <b>blade</b> <b>tip</b> scattering, and temporal development of the peak axial and swirl velocity are discussed. The effects of the active twist actuation on the <b>blade</b> <b>tip</b> vortices are examined for the 1 /rev and 3 /rev actuation frequencies. The variation of the vortex trajectories is dominated by the <b>blade</b> <b>tip</b> deflection for the 1 /rev actuation, and by the torsion of the <b>blade</b> <b>tip</b> for the 3 /rev actuation. The 3 /rev actuation reduces the initial peak swirl velocity by up to 35 % compared to the baseline case. The actuation with the control phase angles 225 ° – 315 ° achieves a strong variation of the vortex trajectories with a vertical deviation of up to 2. 6 %R below the rotor tip path plane.

To investigate the high-speed scraping behavior between a vulcanized silicone rubber and a Ti- 6 Al- 4 V fan blade and evaluate the abradable performance of seal rubber, abrasion tests were conducted at a <b>blade</b> <b>tip</b> velocity of 50 – 300  m/s with an incursion rate of 100  μm/s.

With an increase of the <b>blade</b> <b>tip</b> velocity, both of the final incursion depth and wear mass loss of seal rubber exhibit growth trends. The gradual changes of rubbing forces with an increase of rubbing time are the characteristic of abrasive wear, and force curves with unstable mutations are a reflection of pattern wear.

This thesis investigates two concepts, the adaptive blade root and the adaptive <b>blade</b> <b>tip,</b> allowing direct adaptive shape control of the main rotor areas that are the main sources of helicopter noise and vibration.

Since non-stationary helicopter aerodynamics and their interaction with the elastic helicopter structure are the main sources for flight envelope boundaries as well as vibration and noise, the comprehension of aerodynamics is essential to effectively influence local airflow conditions and finally evaluate the investigated concepts. With respect to these relations the adaptive blade root and the adaptive <b>blade</b> <b>tip</b> are described and evaluated.

For unshrouded centrifugal, mixed-flow and axial-flow blood pumps, the complex flow patterns within the <b>blade</b> <b>tip</b> clearance between the lengthwise upper surface of the rotating impeller blades and the stationary pump housing have a dramatic effect on both the hydrodynamic performance and the blood damage production. Detailed computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analyses were performed in this study to investigate such flow behavior in <b>blade</b> <b>tip</b> clearance region for a centrifugal blood pump representing a scaled-up version of a prototype pediatric VAD. Nominal flow conditions were analyzed at a flow rate of 2. 5 L/min and rotor speed of 3000 rpm with three <b>blade</b> <b>tip</b> clearances of 50, 100, and 200 microm.
