5|$|Reptilian lungs {{typically}} receive air via {{expansion and}} contraction of the ribs driven by axial muscles and buccal pumping. Crocodilians also {{rely on the}} hepatic piston method, in which the liver is pulled <b>back</b> by <b>a</b> muscle <b>anchored</b> to the pubic bone (part of the pelvis) called the diaphragmaticus, which in turn creates negative pressure in the crocodile's thoracic cavity, allowing air to be moved into the lungs by Boyle's law. Turtles, which are unable to move their ribs, instead use their forelimbs and pectoral girdle to force air {{in and out of}} the lungs.|$|R
50|$|Using two anchors set {{approximately}} 45° apart, or wider angles up to 90°, {{from the}} bow {{is a strong}} mooring for facing into strong winds. To set anchors in this way, first one anchor {{is set in the}} normal fashion. Then, taking in on the first cable as the boat is motored into the wind and letting slack while drifting <b>back,</b> <b>a</b> second <b>anchor</b> is set approximately a half-scope away from the first on a line perpendicular to the wind. After this second anchor is set, the scope on the first is taken up until the vessel is lying between the two anchors and the load is taken equally on each cable.This moor also to some degree limits the range of a vessel's swing to a narrower oval. Care should be taken that other vessels will not swing down on the boat due to the limited swing range.|$|R

40|$|Any graph {{which is}} not vertex {{transitive}} has a proper induced subgraph which is unique due to its structure or the way of its connection {{to the rest of}} the graph. We have called such subgraph as <b>an</b> <b>anchor.</b> Using <b>an</b> <b>anchor</b> which, in fact, is representative of a graph asymmetry, the reconstruction of that graph reduces to a smaller form of the reconstruction. Therefore, to show that a graph is reconstructible, it is sufficient to find <b>a</b> suitable <b>anchor</b> that brings us to a solved form of the problem. An orbit O of a graph G which makes G O to be <b>an</b> <b>anchor</b> or two vertices which makes G {v,w to be <b>an</b> <b>anchor</b> with the conditions that will be mentioned, is sufficient to show that G is reconstructible. For instance, this fact is enough to show that trees are reconstructible...|$|R
