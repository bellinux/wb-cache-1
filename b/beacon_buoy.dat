40|$|This paper {{describes}} the environmental monitoring / regatta <b>beacon</b> <b>buoy</b> under {{development at the}} Laboratory of Autonomous Systems (LSA) of the Polytechnic Institute of Porto. On the one hand, environmentalmonitoring of open water bodies in real or deferred time is essential to assess and make sensible decisions and, on the other hand, the broadcast in real time of position, water and wind related parameters allows autonomous boats to optimise their regatta performance. This proposal, rather than restraining the boats autonomy, fosters the development of intelligent behaviour by allowing the boats to focus on regatta strategy and tactics. The Nautical and Telemetric Application (NAUTA) buoy is a dual mode reconfigurable system that includes communications, control, data logging, sensing, storage and power subsystems. In environmental monitoring mode, the buoy gathers and stores data from several underwater and above water sensors and, in regatta mode, the buoy becomes an active course mark for the autonomous sailing boats in the vicinity. During a race, the buoy broadcasts its position, together with {{the wind and the}} water current local conditions, allowing autonomous boats to navigate towards and round the mark successfully. This project started with the specification of the requirements of the dual mode operation, followed by the design and building of the buoy structure. The research is currently focussed {{on the development of the}} modular, reconfigurable, open source-based control system. The NAUTA buoy is innovative, extensible and optimises the on board platform resources...|$|E
40|$|The marine {{sector of}} the Campi Flegrei caldera has started to be {{monitored}} over the long-term with a seafloor equipment deployed in the Gulf of Pozzuoli from 2008. The equipment includes a set of geophysical, oceanographic and environmental sensors integrated in a marine platform that was specifically designed for real-time monitoring. This platform, named CUMAS (Cabled Underwater Multidisciplinary Acquisition System), was installed {{in the center of}} the Gulf at about 2. 5 km south of Pozzuoli where the sea depth is about 100 m [Iannaccone et al., 2010]. The CUMAS system consists of a seafloor module connected by cable to a buoy (elastic beacon type) equipped with autonomous power supply systems, real-time data- transmission devices and a weather station. The core of CUMAS is the seafloor module that contains geophysical and oceanographic sensors, in particular, a three-component broadband seismometer, a best in class three axis MEMS accelerometer, a low-frequency hydrophone and a high-resolution sea bottom pressure recorder. A single-point acoustic, three-component, water-current meter and a water-temperature sensor were also installed to monitor some water local physical parameters. A set of status sensors, which also included a digital compass and a two-component digital tilt-meter, were added to track the attitude of the module over the course of the experiment. The marine monitoring system transmits the data in real-time and is integrated into the Monitoring Center in Naples managed by INGV-Osservatorio Vesuviano. A continuous GPS station has been installed since the end of 2011 on the top of the buoy. The elastic <b>beacon</b> <b>buoy</b> forms a structure which is rigidly connected by a mechanical cable to the ballast on the sea bottom, a submerged float at the base of the buoy maintains tension on the cable and ensure the overall buoyancy of the system. In this way, any vertical movement of the seafloor propagates rigidly to the emerged part of the buoy itself, allowing measurement of the vertical movement of the sea floor by the GPS station. The analysis of about 17 months of continuous GPS data, from January 2012 to May 2013, revealed an overall uplift of about 3 - 4 cm allowing a first measurement of vertical seafloor displacement in the Campi Flegrei caldera [De Martino et al., 2014]. A new opportunity to enhance the deployed system was given by a national project, EMSO-MedIT, which is providing the necessary resources to expand the data acquisition to other areas of the Gulf of Pozzuoli. New improved systems similar to CUMAS are going to be deployed in three additional marine sites of the Gulf of Pozzuoli and the existing tide gauges network will be renewed with state-of-art sensors. The overall new monitoring infrastructure will allow to extensively map the seafloor vertical displacement and to improve the interpretative models of the bradyseism phenomenon including a more accurate location of earthquakes in the marine areas and extending to lower magnitude values the detection of the seismic activity...|$|E

[...] Funds had been raised for the implementation of navigation aids by taxing vessels entering the Port of Brunswick at six pence per ton.
