60|$|From the {{considerations}} {{which we}} have now adduced, it is obvious {{what is meant by}} such phrases as a <b>brisk</b> <b>demand,</b> and a rapid circulation. There is a <b>brisk</b> <b>demand</b> and a rapid circulation, when goods, generally speaking, are sold {{as fast as they can}} be produced. There is slackness, on the contrary, and stagnation, when goods, which have been produced, remain for a long time unsold. In the former case, the capital which has been locked up in production is disengaged as soon as the production is completed; and can be immediately employed in further production. In the latter case, a large portion of the productive capital of the country is lying in temporary inactivity.|$|E

40|$|Benefiting from <b>brisk</b> {{external}} <b>demand,</b> Austria's {{manufacturing sector}} continued its recovery {{also in the}} autumn: in September, production was 11 percent higher than during the trough in May 2009, {{and the results of}} the WIFO business cycle survey suggest that production activity remained lively also in October and November. Driven by exports and manufacturing activity, real GDP rose by 0. 9 percent quarter-on-quarter and by 2. 4 percent year-on-year in the third quarter. However, a self-sustaining pick-up in investment has not got off the ground as yet: it was possible to stop the decline in equipment investment in the spring of 2010, but construction investment continues to contract. Household consumption is benefiting from brisk employment growth not only in the services sectors but also in manufacturing industry. The number of unemployed, while still clearly exceeding pre-crisis levels, continues to fall. Consumer price inflation remains subdued, it is primarily determined by the rise in world market prices for crude oil and other commodities. Business Cycle Report...|$|R
40|$|Quarterly {{national}} accounts, {{based on}} the ESA 2 nd edition concept, are {{for the first time}} available in Austria. Faced with a shortage of primary statistics that meet the quarterly demand in terms of prompt availability and accuracy, WIFO has developed an econometric model to estimate quarterly series. This IS-LM Model for small open economies (SMOE) with fixed exchange rates yields quarterly series for the entire demand side. Provisional estimates for current quarters will be a synthesis of the model's results and recent information from the supply side, for which reliable and quick data are available. WIFO plans to publish quarterly data within three months of the end of each quarter. Since key statistical data on the relevant quarter will necessarily take some time to collect, revisions will have to be made more frequently. A first glance at the original as well as seasonally adjusted data reveals that there are only modest fluctuations in quarterly GDP series. The greatest seasonal fluctuation can be found in investment in construction whereas import figures show the least erratic movement. In the first quarter of 1998 real GDP grew by 4. 2 percent on a year-on-year basis. Seasonally adjusted GDP increased by over 1. 4 percent over the previous quarter. Despite the crisis in the construction sector its real value added soared by 10. 2 percent over the year, due to the mild climate. Manufacturing output (including mining) surged by 8. 9 percent, caused by the <b>brisk</b> foreign <b>demand</b> as well as domestic investments. Exports of goods and services rose by 12. 8 percent and gross fixed capital formation by 8. 6 percent. So far, consumer spending has been muted, inching up by 1. 2 percent in the first quarter.

40|$|A {{stronger}} international {{competitive position}} and <b>brisk</b> domestic <b>demand</b> {{will have a}} positive impact on the Austrian economy in the next years. Assuming that the international financial crisis will be temporary in its detrimental effect and that the public budget consolidation policy will continue, there are no obstacles to the achievement of stable growth. In 1997 - 2002, GDP will grow by 2. 75 percent p. a. on average, which is slightly above the EU average rate. Growth of the Austrian economy has accelerated since 1996. The dynamic development is likely to be temporarily stayed by the effects of turbulences on the international financial markets. After a slight slowdown in 1999, total economic production will once again expand strongly. As a result of production expansion and measures under the National Action Plan for Employment, some 100, 000 additional jobs could be created in the projection period. Unemployment should decline by about 1 percentage point (from 7. 2 percent to 6. 2 percent of the dependently employed in line with the traditional definition; from 4. 4 percent to 3. 7 percent in accordance with the EU definition). The external sector will make a positive contribution to growth of 0. 25 percent of GDP on average. Improved terms of trade and an upswing of the domestic tourism industry will provide for a noticeable reduction of the current account deficit over the next years. In the projection period domestic demand is supported by strong and steadily growing private consumption (+ 2 percent p. a. in real terms on average). Consumer confidence has improved. As a consequence of the growth of disposable real income of private households, the personal savings ratio will gradually be returned to its long-term equilibrium value. At an average growth of 4 percent p. a., gross fixed capital formation up to 2002 will rise at double the pace of 1991 - 1997. Plant and equipment expenditure will develop more dynamically, while building investments will grow moderately as a consequence of the redimensioning process in residential housing construction. Neither import prices nor unit labor cost are expected to make for any upward trend of prices domestically, and sustained competitive pressure effectively restricts price increases, so that prices will remain stable. The average rate of inflation will be 1. 25 percent p. a. According to the projection (which does not consider the plans for tax reform), budget consolidation will continue in 2000, after a hiatus in 1999. The deficit will be less than 1. 5 percent of GDP, government debt, on the other hand, will not decline below 60 percent of GDP. Mittelfristprognose Oesterreich...|$|R

The exhibition and the sales are private now. Stocks are up, just at present, partly because of a <b>brisk</b> <b>demand</b> created by the recent return of the Sultan's suite from the courts of Europe; partly on account of an unusual abundance of bread-stuffs, which leaves holders untortured by hunger and enables them to hold back for high prices; and partly because buyers are too weak to bear the market, while sellers are amply prepared to bull it.

6000|$|... 2. Again, it {{is another}} common notion that high prices make high wages; because the {{producers}} and dealers, being better off, {{can afford to pay}} more to their laborers. I have already said that a <b>brisk</b> <b>demand,</b> which causes temporary high prices, causes also temporary high wages. But high prices, in themselves, can only raise wages if the dealers, receiving more, are induced to save more, and make an addition to their capital, or at least to their purchases of labor. Wages will probably be temporarily higher in the employment in which prices have risen, and somewhat lower in other employments: in which case, while {{the first half of the}} phenomenon excites notice, the other is generally overlooked, or, if observed, is not ascribed to the cause which really produced it. Nor will the partial rise of wages last long: for, though the dealers in that one employment gain more, it does not follow that there is room to employ a greater amount of savings in their own business: their increasing capital will probably flow over into other employments, and there counterbalance the diminution previously made in the demand for labor by the diminished savings of other classes.|$|E
60|$|The {{refusal of}} the Committee to admit my {{statement}} had not unnaturally created the impression {{that it must be}} a scandalous document; and a lively demand for copies at once set in. And among the very first applicants were members of the majority which had carried the decision to exclude the document. They had given so little attention to the business that they did not know, or had forgotten, that they had already been supplied with copies at their own request. At all events, they came to me publicly and cleaned me out of the handful of copies I had provided for distribution to the press. And after the sitting it was intimated to me that yet more copies were desired {{for the use of the}} Committee: a demand, under the circumstances, of breath-bereaving coolness. At the same time, a <b>brisk</b> <b>demand</b> arose outside the Committee, not only among people who were anxious to read what I had to say on the subject, but among victims of the craze for collecting first editions, copies of privately circulated pamphlets, and other real or imaginary rarities, and who will cheerfully pay five guineas for any piece of discarded old rubbish of mine when they will not pay four-and-sixpence for this book because everyone else can get it for four-and-sixpence too.|$|E
6000|$|... 1. For instance, it is {{a common}} saying that wages are high when trade is good. The demand for labor in any {{particular}} employment is more pressing, and higher wages are paid, when there is a <b>brisk</b> <b>demand</b> for the commodity produced; and the contrary when there is what is called a stagnation: then work-people are dismissed, and those who are retained must submit to a reduction of wages; though in these cases there is neither more nor less capital than before. This is true; and is one of those complications in the concrete phenomena which obscure and disguise the operation of general causes; but it is not really inconsistent with the principles laid down. Capital which the owner does not employ in purchasing labor, but keeps idle in his hands, is the same thing to the laborers, for the time being, as if it did not exist. All capital is, from the variations of trade, occasionally in this state. A manufacturer, finding a slack demand for his commodity, forbears to employ laborers in increasing a stock which he finds it difficult to dispose of; or if he goes on until all his capital is locked up in unsold goods, then at least he must of necessity pause until he can get paid for some of them. But no one expects either of these states to be permanent; if he did, he would at the first opportunity remove his capital to some other occupation, in which it would still continue to employ labor. The capital remains unemployed for a time, during which the labor market is overstocked, and wages fall. Afterward the demand revives, and perhaps becomes unusually brisk, enabling the manufacturer to sell his commodity even faster than he can produce it; his whole capital is then brought into complete efficiency, and, if he is able, he borrows capital in addition, which would otherwise have gone into some other employment. These, however, are but temporary fluctuations: the capital now lying idle will next year be in active employment, that which is this year unable {{to keep up with the}} demand will in its turn be locked up in crowded warehouses; and wages in these several departments will ebb and flow accordingly: but nothing can permanently alter general wages, except an increase or a diminution of capital itself (always meaning by the term, the funds of all sorts, destined for the payment of labor) compared with the quantity of labor offering itself to be hired.|$|E
5000|$|As {{people were}} being bought, {{the main focus of}} this was the market of vote buying. At the {{beginning}} of voting for candidates the market opened for business. Mark Wahlgren Summers writes that [...] "On that day the market for votes opened at five dollars, with a <b>brisk</b> <b>demand</b> and strong upward tendency." [...] At the beginning of an election most voters would receive five dollars, but as the election process continued people could obtain as much as fifty dollars for their vote. The dictation of the prices fluctuated since this was a market, but as the election dwindled to the end voters could receive these high payments. As Business Report, in New York in 1888 dispatched information to the public, this only helped those who were floating voters have better chances of receiving greater compensation for their vote since they knew what was a reasonable offer. Furthermore, this complicated the discussion between the runner and the floating voter. Runners were bargaining to get the cheapest prices, while voters desired to receive the highest payment they could. In all vote buying led to changes in the polls as Senator George Edmunds remarked in 1889, [...] "divisions of parties in several of the states have been so close that the purchase of a comparatively small number of votes could easily turn the scale." ...|$|E

40|$|The {{momentum}} {{generated by}} international trade is gradually overcoming the restrictive internal stabilization concept. The incipient upswing shows an unusual regional pattern. The western Länder, accustomed to picking up positive trends {{of the economic}} cycle quickly, are lagging behind. Although their high-skilled industries have also started to rehire, structural problems in the tourism industry and its suppliers and – {{especially in the case}} of Salzburg – the loss of the bridge function between EC and EFTA have greater weight and are delaying the upswing. In the eastern region on the other hand, differences between regional developments have become even more distinct. While Lower Austria and Burgenland have been able to exploit the change in the geopolitical scene (Burgenland in particular experienced explosive growth), business in domestically focused Vienna suffered most from the stabilization concept. Upper Austria and Carinthia exploited the <b>brisk</b> <b>demand</b> for intermediate products and recovered rapidly. Styria got the best out of the upswing thanks to its stringent structural policy program which helped it shake off its reputation as a crisis region. In the last three months, 2, 800 new jobs were created there, almost one third of the overall growth in Austria. Aufschwung begünstigt Ostregion. Die Wirtschaft in den Bundesländern im II.

Most of these wars are seen in areas of sports organizations. Sports is always in front of consumer in every moment of the life and being in <b>brisk</b> <b>demand.</b> It is transformed into an industry which has a large-scale by adding the power of influencing the sectors connected to each other.

Anyway, the efforts of preventing ambush marketing applications by the event owners and sponsors becoming very hard. There is not a clear result about whether ambush marketing is an ethical application or not and if it has a positive or a negative impact on the sports marketing.

40|$|Mergers, acquisitions, {{and high}} {{competitiveness}} are some factors that compound the so-called globalisation in the container shipping industry {{as the new}} millennium approaches. In the last three decades, great changes in the shipping industry have fiercely witnessed the investment in standardised cargo units, integrated transport system and speedy cargo handling facilities. In general, the shipping industry has improved significantly {{and much of the}} public's attention has been drawn towards the increasing TEU (twenty-foot equivalent unit) capacity and speed of container ships. Moving goods quickly and as cheaply as possible are the milestones of shipping liners that are gradually going on a fierce competition for seaborne trade. The liners of today's maritime industry have an increasing awareness of the importance of quality of service and how to attain this, consequently maintaining the service competitive in the market. Political factors sometimes have a great influence in the volume of seaborne trade. Every ship operator knows that the market offers periods of high and low. Success is rather easy to attain when the market is considered to be high. Good freight rates and peak market times is a combination that the ship operator thrives on. The investment on economies of scale is shaping the container sector. That leads to lower price to the shipper who also benefits from faster times. However, the constraints posed to the 'mega-carriers' in the light of building such huge and speedy vessels, leads to the question: "How far can large and speedy container vessels improve the company's revenue?" Sometimes the shipowner is caught up with some decisions to be taken. For instance, he can be employing chartered vessels on a specific trade and is not entirely satisfied with the financial performance of the loop. Another typical case is that on what the company is not being successful on the return on investment of vessels as forecast and may be contemplating charter these vessels out and invest on faster and larger ships to meet the <b>brisk</b> <b>demand</b> on that trade. Whatever the case is, this study is intended to investigate the market and determine the efficiencies of investing in larger tonnage as well as in speedy ships in the liner environment...|$|E
