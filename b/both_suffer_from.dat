25|$|There {{have been}} various {{attempts}} to find modifications to general relativity. The most famous of these are the Brans–Dicke theory (also known as scalar-tensor theory), and Rosen's bimetric theory. Both of these theories proposed changes to the field equations of general relativity, and <b>both</b> <b>suffer</b> <b>from</b> these changes permitting the presence of bipolar gravitational radiation. As a result, Rosen's original theory has been refuted by observations of binary pulsars. As for Brans–Dicke (which has a tunable parameter ω such that ω = ∞ {{is the same as}} general relativity), the amount by which it can differ from general relativity has been severely constrained by these observations.|$|E
2500|$|The {{relationship}} between Rhisiart and Owen {{is a central}} theme, with Rhisiat calling Owen father and vice versa, and similarities have been suggested with Stephen Dedalus and Leopold Bloom in James Joyce's Ulysses. The theme is also, of course, explored in other of Powys's novels, most notably Wolf Solent and [...] Rhisiart and Owen also resemble each other in several significant ways: [...] "oth, for example, are forced {{to come to terms}} [...] with the inevitable clash between the dream possibilities of Romance and the harsh realities of life in this world". They also <b>both</b> <b>suffer</b> <b>from</b> [...] "strange seizures" [...] and have a cruel sadistic side, though they both also exhibit compassion.

2500|$|Suddenly, two spirits – Gianni Schicchi de' Cavalcanti and Myrrha, both punished as Imposters (Falsifiers of Persons) – run rabid {{through the}} pit. Schicchi sinks his tusks into Capocchio's neck and drags him away like prey. Griffolino {{explains}} how Myrrha disguised herself to commit incest {{with her father}} King Cinyras, while Schicchi impersonated the dead Buoso Donati to dictate a will giving himself several profitable bequests. Dante then encounters Master Adam of Brescia, one of the Counterfeiters (Falsifiers of Money): for manufacturing Florentine florins of twenty-one (rather than twenty-four) carat gold, he was {{burned at the stake}} in 1281. He is punished by a loathsome dropsy-like disease, which gives him a bloated stomach, prevents him from moving, and an eternal, unbearable thirst. Master Adam points out two sinners of the fourth class, the Perjurers (Falsifiers of Words). These are Potiphar's wife (punished for her false accusation of Joseph, Gen. 39:7-19) and Sinon, the Achaean spy who lied to the Trojans to convince them to take the Trojan Horse into their city (Aeneid II, 57-194); Sinon is here rather than in Bolgia 8 because his advice was false as well as evil. <b>Both</b> <b>suffer</b> <b>from</b> a burning fever. Master Adam and Sinon exchange abuse, which Dante watches until he is rebuked by Virgil. As a result of his shame and repentance, Dante is forgiven by his guide. Sayers remarks that the descent through Malebolge [...] "began with the sale of the sexual relationship, and went on to the sale of Church and State; now, the very money is itself corrupted, every affirmation has become perjury, and every identity a lie" [...] so that every aspect of social interaction has been progressively destroyed.|$|E

60|$|In {{regard to}} the moral qualities, some {{elimination}} of the worst dispositions is always in progress {{even in the most}} civilised nations. Malefactors are executed, or imprisoned for long periods, so that they cannot freely transmit their bad qualities. Melancholic and insane persons are confined, or commit suicide. Violent and quarrelsome men often come to a bloody end. Restless men who will not follow any steady occupation—and this relic of barbarism is a great check to civilisation[236]—emigrate to newly-settled countries, where they prove useful pioneers. Intemperance is so highly destructive, that the expectation of life of the intemperate, at the age, for instance, of thirty, is only 13.8 years; whilst for the rural labourers of England at the same age it is 40·59 years.[237] Profligate women bear few children, and profligate men rarely marry; <b>both</b> <b>suffer</b> <b>from</b> disease. In the breeding of domestic animals, the elimination of those individuals, though few in number, which are in any marked manner inferior, is by no means an unimportant element towards success. This especially holds good with injurious characters which tend to reappear through reversion, such as blackness in sheep; and with mankind some of the worst dispositions, which occasionally without any assignable cause make their appearance in families, may perhaps be reversions to a savage state, from which we are not removed by very many generations. This view seems indeed recognised in the common expression that such men are the black sheep of the family.|$|E

50|$|Tie presses are {{particularly}} useful for bow ties, {{due to the}} creasing and thus deformative nature of the bow tie knot, which involves crushing the ends to produce the 'bow' effect.

While ChIP-Seq is typically used for genome-wide identification of TFBS (Barski et al., 2007; Wei et al., 2006), it provides only linear information of protein binding sites along the chromosomes (but not interactions between them), and can suffer from high genomic background noise (false positives).|$|E
