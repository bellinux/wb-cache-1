Some examples of <b>waste</b> <b>oil</b> are used oils such as hydraulic oil, transmission oil, brake fluids, motor oil, crankcase oil, gear box oil and synthetic oil. Many {{of the same}} problems associated with natural petroleum exist with <b>waste</b> <b>oil.</b> When <b>waste</b> <b>oil</b> from vehicles drips out engines over streets and roads, the oil travels into the water table bringing with it such toxins as benzene.

40|$|According to a {{decision}} of the European Court of Justice material recycling of <b>waste</b> <b>oil</b> must take priority over thermal recycling. The present study investigates the possibilities to classify <b>waste</b> <b>oil</b> samples according to their potential for material recycling on-site at the <b>waste</b> <b>oil</b> producer. The {{first part of the}} study surveys {{the state of the art}} in chemical analysis of <b>waste</b> <b>oil</b> and in oil quality monitoring with sensing elements in vehicles. It was shown, that the chemical analysis of <b>waste</b> <b>oil</b> is dominated by methods for monitoring the oil quality and by methods for the determination of harmful substances. For sensor-based oil condition monitoring in vehicles different approaches were discussed in literature. Most sensor systems work in a capacitive mode and use the change of the electrical properties of the oil for analysing oil quality. The second part of the study investigates, whether <b>waste</b> <b>oil</b> can be classified according to its potential for material recycling by the following physical parameters: viscosity, density, viscoelastic properties, conductivity and relative permittivity. This was done by performing and evaluating measurements at 26 different <b>waste</b> <b>oil</b> samples with a combi-SAW-/IDK-dipstick sensor. The results showed, that the SAW- und IDK-signals contain only little information permitting to classify <b>waste</b> <b>oil</b> samples according to their potential for material recycling. A classification of <b>waste</b> <b>oil</b> samples with the combi-SAW-/IDK-dipstick sensor was impossible, even when the signal evaluation was done by using modern methods of chemometrics, as e. g. the multivariate statistics. A further series of measurements showed, that since the conductivity of the <b>waste</b> <b>oil</b> samples is too low, cyclovoltammetry is also an unsuitable method to classify <b>waste</b> <b>oil</b> samples on-site. On the other hand, the study showed that the investigated <b>waste</b> <b>oil</b> samples can be classified by IR-spectroscopy in combination with multivariate statistics. By evaluating the IR-spectra of the <b>waste</b> <b>oil</b> samples with a partial-least-square procedure the samples can be divided into samples that have the potential for material recycling and samples that have not. Having in mind that the problem is complex, that only a few <b>waste</b> <b>oil</b> samples have been investigated and that the number of measurements was restricted, this empirically found correlation can only be seen as an indication how the problem could be solved. A definite proof that IR-spectroscopy in combination with a PLS-procedure allows to classify <b>waste</b> <b>oil</b> is still not produced. The study indicates that, from a technical point of view, an on-site testing device for the classification of <b>waste</b> <b>oil</b> can be realized most likely in terms of a mobile IR-spectrometer with an ATR probe and an integrated signal evaluation module.

40|$|Road {{construction}} necessitates a {{high amount}} of bitumen, {{which is a}} non-renewable material. The usage of reclaimed asphalt pavement (RAP) {{can be seen as}} a sustainable option, which offers economic benefits and conservation of natural resources. However, the high stiffness offered by RAP which leads to cracking has impelled the application of rejuvenator. The exploration of <b>waste</b> <b>oil</b> as the rejuvenator has gained the interest but they still lack of the information. This paper aims to highlight previous research works conducted on the <b>waste</b> <b>oil</b> application in the pavement materials. Large amount of waste product from the automotive industry and by-product of frying can impose adverse impact if not disposed properly. The properties of two types of <b>waste</b> <b>oil</b> namely <b>waste</b> engine <b>oil</b> (WEO) and <b>waste</b> cooking <b>oil</b> (WCO) were reviewed. Additionally, method incorporating <b>waste</b> <b>oil</b> in pavement materials, effects to the binder and mixture performance also included.

40|$|The marine {{ecological}} environment and fishery resources can be severely polluted or destroyed by <b>waste</b> <b>oil</b> from fishing vessels {{if they are}} emitted directly into the ocean without any proper pre-treatment process. International conventions such as MARPOL 73 / 78 regulate waste-oil emissions and require the installation of a waste oil-water separator only for ocean-going ships of over 400 gross tons. Hence, these international conventions are not applicable to most fishing ships due to their low gross tonnages. In addition, space on most fishing vessels is too limited to allow waste-oil storage tanks or a waste oil-water separator to comply with international maritime regulations. Because {{a significant amount of}} <b>waste</b> <b>oil</b> is produced by fishing vessels around the world every day, effective strategies or measures are needed to prevent this <b>waste</b> <b>oil</b> from polluting the marine environment. This study thus investigates strategies and measures for improving the effectiveness of waste-oil collection from fishing vessels. This study found that existing procedures for the collection and treatment of <b>waste</b> lubricating <b>oil</b> on land could be applied to the management of <b>waste</b> <b>oil</b> and bilge water from fishing vessels. Sufficient oil-water separators and storage facilities for the collection of <b>waste</b> <b>oil</b> should be placed at each fishing port and shipyard. Fishermen should then be required to deliver their <b>waste</b> <b>oil</b> to these storage facilities, from where it can be transported to legal recycling companies for further treatment. In addition, fishing harbor authorities should bear definitive responsibility for monitoring the illegal dumping of <b>waste</b> <b>oil</b> and for checking the waste-oil record books of fishing vessels. Each maritime country should enforce relevant laws and regulations to reduce the emission of <b>waste</b> <b>oil</b> from fishing vessels into the ocean. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

30|$|The {{beneficial}} reuse {{of industrial}} <b>waste</b> <b>oil</b> {{is important to}} alleviate energy shortage and improve environmental protection. The first key link of reuse is the demulsification of the <b>waste</b> <b>oil</b> emulsion [1, 2, 3]. In general, demulsification of water-in-oil emulsion is difficult to achieve by a single process efficiently. Demulsification technologies usually couple and integrate two and more processes or units to complete the separation process; thus, they are difficult {{to adapt to the}} conventional process [4, 5, 6]. For the W/O industrial <b>waste</b> <b>oil</b> of high water content and complex components, the dewatering-type hydrocyclone can be used as the body and the high-voltage electrode is embedded to generate and couple high-voltage electric and swirling centrifugal fields for realizing the efficient separation and treatment of the <b>waste</b> <b>oil</b> emulsion [7].|$|R

40|$|Aims: The study {{analyzes}} the carbon footprint of the <b>waste</b> <b>oil</b> management system operating in Portugal {{to ensure the}} sustainable operation in the future. The analysis {{was carried out in}} 2011 for the system that is composed of a treatment procedure collecting the treated oil for re-refining, followed by the production of expanded clay and recycling for electricity production. Methodology: Carbon footprint analysis was conducted by using the Umberto software 5. 5 based on the concepts of life cycle assessment with respect to international standards (ISO). Within this context, the substances considered for such carbon footprint analysis are directly relevant to Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC, 2007). Results: The results showed that managing <b>waste</b> <b>oils</b> may contribute to the reduction of carbon footprint due to the avoided emissions of greenhouse gas through the reuse of treated <b>waste</b> <b>oils.</b> The carbon dioxide equivalent emissions from collection and treatment of <b>waste</b> <b>oils</b> would not outweigh such benefit earned from the substitution of virgin lubricant oil even though the use of treated <b>waste</b> <b>oils</b> for producing expanded clay may end up some more carbon dioxide emissions. Conclusion: The carbon footprint analysis in this study has shown the potential for improvements in the <b>waste</b> <b>oil</b> management system in Portugal. The most significant improvement that could be made is the increase of using treated <b>waste</b> <b>oils</b> for the expanded clay production. However, such a strategy would not be consistent with the waste hierarchy principle which dominates the current decision making in managing waste nationally...|$|R
5|$|Deep frying {{produces}} {{large amounts}} of <b>waste</b> <b>oil,</b> which must be disposed of properly. <b>Waste</b> <b>oil</b> can overflow sewage systems, bind to the walls of sewage pipes, and interfere with sewage treatment. <b>Waste</b> <b>oil</b> from deep frying is increasingly being recycled and refined into biodiesel. Potatoes that are stored in artificially humidified warehouses contain more water, which makes {{the time required to}} deep fry them into chips longer. This increases the carbon dioxide footprint of commercially producing chips because more energy is required for frying over a longer time.
