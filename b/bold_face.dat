25|$|Although CP/M {{provided}} some hardware abstraction to standardize the interface to disk I/O or console I/O, typically application programs still required installation {{to make use}} of all the features of such equipment as printers and terminals. Often these were controlled by escape sequences which had to be altered for different devices. For example, the escape sequence to select <b>bold</b> <b>face</b> on a printer would have differed among manufacturers, and sometimes among models within a manufacturer's range. This procedure was not defined by the operating system; a user would typically run an installation program that would either allow selection from a range of devices, or else allow feature-by-feature editing of the escape sequences required to access a function. This had to be repeated for each application program, since there was no central operating system service provided for these devices.|$|E
