5|$|As Tyrion and Bronn head towards Tywin Lannister's camp, {{they are}} {{surrounded}} {{by one of the}} barbarian hill tribes of the Vale. Tyrion convinces them to serve as his escorts by promising them gold, weapons and an army to help them seize the Vale of Arryn. Tywin is displeased, but agrees to keep Tyrion's promises if the hill tribes join the fight against the Starks. The tribesmen agree, <b>but</b> <b>want</b> Tyrion to follow them as insurance, much to Tyrion's discomfort.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to radio-based methods, some projects, such as SEVENDIP (Search for Extraterrestrial Visible Emissions from Nearby Developed Intelligent Populations) at the University of California, Berkeley, are using {{other regions of}} the electromagnetic spectrum to search for extraterrestrial signals. Various other projects are not searching for coherent signals, <b>but</b> <b>want</b> to rather use electromagnetic radiation to find other evidence of extraterrestrial intelligence, such as megascale astroengineering projects.|$|E

25|$|More {{difficult}} are {{situations where}} the countries asking for support, such as ASEAN and allies both can offer sensitive HUMINT, <b>but</b> <b>want</b> to exchange for SIGINT from the US or allies such as Australia.

25|$|Hansen {{said one}} of his most {{important}} achievements in the Senate was the passage of amendments to the Surface Mining Act which prevent mining companies from confiscating the wealth from private lands by means of following an oil bed onto adjacent properties. Farmers and ranchers as a whole in Wyoming, he said, do not object to mining <b>but</b> <b>want</b> compensation if minerals are found on their lands. Hansen said that the amendments have proved important over time because of the large coal industry now rooted in his state.|$|E
25|$|The {{target market}} is the U.S. Air National Guard and foreign nations that cannot afford the F-35, <b>but</b> <b>want</b> an {{aircraft}} to perform ISR and light attack missions better than turboprop planes. Buying and sustaining the Scorpion would cost less than A-10 or F-16 upgrades. For air patrol, the Scorpion requires radar and the capability of supersonic flight, similar to the unsuccessful 1980s-era Northrop F-20 Tigershark. The market for light fixed-wing attack jets had declined in the 1980s as richer countries opted for more capable aircraft and poorer countries pursued turboprops and attack helicopters. It is uncertain if the Scorpion will be cheaper or outperform turboprops or remotely piloted aircraft (RPA) in terms of range, endurance, low-altitude performance, and sensors.|$|E

25|$|When {{band members}} are marching in one {{direction}} <b>but</b> <b>want</b> to focus their sound in another, they may rotate their bodies at the waist, so that only the upper portion of the body faces {{in the direction of}} play. This is known as lateral marching, but is more commonly known as either shifting, traversing, or sliding. A lateral march is not a change in the direction of march, only in the direction the upper body faces. Percussion players, whose large drum harnesses often prevent them from twisting their torsos, and sometimes tuba and sousaphone players, instead uses a crab step when moving sideways. During a crab step, the musician crosses one leg over the other, either marching on the toes or rolling the foot sideways. Percussionists may also substitute roll step when their instruments would interfere with performing the high step.|$|E
25|$|Another {{problematic}} case is {{the cases}} of desired non-disclosure of PGD results for some genetic disorders that may not yet be apparent in a parent, such as Huntington disease. It is applied when patients {{do not wish to}} know their carrier status <b>but</b> <b>want</b> to ensure that they have offspring free of the disease. This procedure can place practitioners in questionable ethical situations, e.g. when no healthy, unaffected embryos are available for transfer and a mock transfer has to be carried out so that the patient does not suspect that he/she is a carrier. The ESHRE ethics task force currently recommends using exclusion testing instead. Exclusion testing is based on a linkage analysis with polymorphic markers, in which the parental and grandparental origin of the chromosomes can be established. This way, only embryos are replaced that do not contain the chromosome derived from the affected grandparent, avoiding the need to detect the mutation itself.|$|E
500|$|Jennifer Thomas of Pioneer Press {{compiled}} a list of 12 of the best TV characters of 2009; Jenny was number 7 on her list and stated: [...] "Jenny is a rare combination of destruction, self-destruction, naivety and insanity. You can't help <b>but</b> <b>want</b> to strangle her, but then she goes all needy and fragile." [...] She also claimed that the season finale was a let-down, but Jenny would have been happy that even in death she was the center of attention and meddling in her friends lives.|$|E

60|$|Eemerk was big enough--over six feet--but {{he wanted}} to be bigger. He was stout enough, <b>but</b> <b>wanted</b> to be stouter. He was {{influential}} too, <b>but</b> <b>wanted</b> to reign supreme. This, of course, was not possible while there existed a taller, stouter, and cleverer man than himself. Even if Eemerk had been the equal of Chingatok in all these respects, there would still have remained one difference of character which would have rendered equality impossible.|$|R
500|$|After {{seeing a}} {{commercial}} about starving children in Africa, Cartman, Stan, Kenny and Kyle send money to Sally Struthers' charity organization, the Christian Children's Fund. They {{do not care}} about the cause, <b>but</b> <b>want</b> the free sports watch {{that comes with the}} sponsorship. However, due to a miscommunication, an Ethiopian boy is delivered to the boys instead of the watch. Although initially shocked, the four boys befriend him, and Cartman names the boy Starvin' Marvin ("Marvin" [...] being given to him by the apparent pronunciation of the name when he was talking in his native language). Meanwhile, mobs of wild turkeys begin attacking and killing South Park residents. Mad scientist Dr. Mephisto tries to warn Mayor McDaniels that genetically engineered turkeys he had been breeding to feed to the poor have gone crazy and are now attacking humans. Mephisto is instead ignored and ridiculed by McDaniels.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) is distraught {{to learn}} that {{although}} her writing staff sometimes hang out after work, they never invite her. She tells Jack—her boss—about this, however, Jack explains that it is best for her to keep her distance from them. Later, Liz's assistant Cerie Xerox (Katrina Bowden) announces that her wedding is back on and that Liz and Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) need to plan a bachelorette party for her. Liz decides to have the party at her apartment and prove to her employees—who are invited—that she can be fun to be with. At the bachelorette party, staff members Pete Hornberger (Scott Adsit), Frank Rossitano (Judah Friedlander), James [...] "Toofer" [...] Spurlock (Keith Powell) and J. D. Lutz (John Lutz) show up, <b>but</b> <b>want</b> to leave as they are not having a good time. Liz gets upset about this, calls them out for not inviting her {{to hang out with}} them and demands that they apologize to her.|$|E
500|$|In {{his letter}} of acceptance, Grant {{concluded}} with [...] "Let us have peace", which became his campaign slogan. For vice president, the delegates nominated House Speaker Schuyler Colfax. Grant's 1862 General Order No. 11 {{became an issue}} during the presidential campaign; he sought {{to distance himself from}} the order, saying [...] "I have no prejudice against sect or race, <b>but</b> <b>want</b> each individual to be judged by his own merit." [...] As President, Grant would atone for 1862's expulsion of the Jews. Historian Jonathan Sarna argues that Grant became one of the greatest friends of Jews in American history, meeting with them often and appointing them to high office. He was the first president to condemn atrocities against Jews in Europe, thus putting human rights on the American diplomatic agenda. As was expected at the time, Grant returned to his home state and left the active campaigning to his campaign manager, William E. Chandler, and others. The Republican campaign focused on continuing Reconstruction and restoring the public credit.|$|E
