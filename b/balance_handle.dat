40|$|The era has {{transferred}} from Analog Age to Digital Age, {{and the market}} is rife with digital products. Due to the science and technology development, people obtain information easily. The overabundant information make people rely on it, however, {{it is not easy}} to digest so much information. Under this background, based on surrounding human, objects and environment, we rethink about the “Communication”. Apply with the method of expressing creation steps the creations contain the message of common experiences and memories between communication objects. After deciding what message to transfer, the creation leads in non-electrical and non-technical concepts. It tries to create unplugged design which does not emphasize on functional oriented concept. These unplugged designs contain emotional messages as communication media. It can help to communicate and to transfer feelings. There are 6 communication issues and 10 derivative creations, Communication of Family (To Keep: a plant basin), Lover (<b>Balance</b> <b>Handle),</b> Friends (The Missing of Cake Plate), Oneself (Wolf in Sheep's Clothing, Technical Cell Phone, Technical Camera, Look Inside), Pen (Pencil & Chopsticks, Born & Burn, Plug Pencil), and Environment (Candle & Candle Holder). In the exhibition space, a visitor can touch and experience the design to compare the received messages with designer's original concept. They can also think over the meaning of every communication issues and rethink the relationship between oneself and surrounding people, event, or objects. 從類比時代轉換為數位時代，市場上充斥著各式數位化商品。隨著科技發展、資訊取得容易，資訊氾濫結果導致人們容易依賴資訊，卻也不易消化資訊。在此數位時代背景下，以周遭人、物、境為對象，重新審思「溝通」行為。創作過程，利用創作步驟圖進行創作。透過決定欲傳遞給溝通對象的溝通訊息，並帶入共同經驗與記憶使訊息達到共鳴，再導入不利用電與科技、不再強調功能導向，而用擁有所謂情感訊息的「不插電」產品設計做為彼此溝通的媒介，期望有助於溝通並達到情感傳遞的效果。最終以六個溝通議題-家人（蓄盆栽）、情人（平衡把手）、朋友（缺一角的蛋糕盤）、自己（披著羊皮的狼，科技手機、相機，飲水思源）、鉛筆（筆筷，Born&Burn，插頭筆）、與環境（花燭器）溝通，衍生了十件創作。透過觀賞者實際操作比對創作者的想法，以檢視每一個溝通主題背後的意涵，重新省思自身與周遭人、事、物的關係。[URL]...|$|E

40|$|At the 3 rd Conference on Vacuum Microbalance Techniques in Los Angeles in 1962, we {{suggested}} {{the use of}} the equation of motion of a balance T=J+a+ka+Ca for the calculation of the unknown torque T, and the measurement for that purpose of the values of all the other quantities in this equation. The present paper discusses the consequences of two sources of error relevant for this method. First, the errors caused in the first and second derivatives of the deflection are considered, deduced from two or three deflection measurements separated by small time intervals. Secondly, the consequences of the errors caused by the uncertainties in the deflection measurements are discussed. Consideration of the two errors together leads to an optimal set of values of parameters for the <b>balance</b> <b>handling...</b>|$|R
50|$|The Blaze was {{originally}} built by Ian Howlett and John Caig, and marketed by Topper International from 1996. In 2000 an active class association ran a sail development program {{to produce a}} more responsive sail, dropping some of the excessive leech of the original that proved 'difficult' in any real breeze for many helms. The slight loss in area was countered by a more efficient sail and <b>balanced</b> <b>handling</b> characteristics, and the class rapidly adopted the sail with numbers raced and sold rising very rapidly. In 2006 Topper moved out of performance composite boats and the manufacturing and marketing rights transferred to Cirrus Raceboats (www.cirrusrace.com) who have refined the boat further and work with Rondar to produce the current boat. As of November 2007 there are just under 250 registered boats.|$|R

50|$|As {{reported}} in tests {{such as the}} Practical Car and Driver, rear-engined cars generally suffer from oversteer handling characteristics to some extent, and to counteract this as much as possible, the Imp has a semi-trailing arm independent rear suspension system. This relatively costly and sophisticated solution, atypical for small-car design at the time, was insisted upon by its designers after testing at length a Chevrolet Corvair with swing axles. To attain <b>balanced</b> <b>handling,</b> the Imp actually uses swing axle geometry at the front, but this initially led to too much understeer and the camber was later reduced by lowering the pivot points. Rootes relied upon {{a team led by}} two young designers, Tim Fry and Mike Parkes who were given an almost free hand {{to come up with a}} small car that would fit well into the Rootes car programme. This at the time centred on derivatives of the Hillman Minx.|$|R
40|$|Three-wheeled tilting {{vehicles}} {{have many}} potential advantages. They combine the comfort {{and safety of}} a car with the fuel economy, size and manoeuvrability of a motorcycle. One major challenge is to fully understand and account for the unusual dynamics {{of this type of}} vehicle. This paper sets out the equations of motion for a vehicle with single front and twin rear wheels and compares them with those of a car and a motorcycle. The mathematical model shows {{that it is necessary to}} introduce a tilt-dependent rear wheel steer term to obtain <b>balanced</b> <b>handling</b> characteristics. A vehicle with a hydraulically actuated tilting system is considered as a case study. As the tilt actuators act against the non-tilting engine module, this has significant effects on the cornering dynamics. Finally, the difference between the lateral acceleration and the hydraulic response time is shown to be a key issue...|$|R
5000|$|Designed {{around the}} all-new Fiat SOHC engine and {{transmission}} {{from the front}} wheel drive Fiat 128, the X1/9 relocated the transverse drive train and suspension assembly {{from the front of}} the 128 to the rear of the passenger cabin, directly in front of the rear axle, giving a mid-engined layout. The layout located the fuel tank and spare wheel ahead of the engine, behind the driver and passenger seats respectively [...] - [...] optimizing the proportion of the car's weight within its wheelbase for more <b>balanced</b> <b>handling</b> and enabling cargo areas front and rear.Once developed for production, the two-seater featured sharp-edged styling with a wedge shape, retractable headlights, an integrated front spoiler and a removable hard top roof panel (targa top). The removable hardtop could be stored in the front boot; a second luggage compartment was provided at the rear of the car, accessible through a conventional boot lid.|$|R
50|$|The 2005 and 2006 system {{normally}} sends 70% {{of power}} to the front wheels and 30% to the rear under normal conditions but these ratios can reverse according to dynamic driving conditions. The 2007-2008 brochures specification sections indicate that this ratio changed to 80%-20%, and vice versa. The system can work because the clutches can slip under circumstances where the vehicle is turning, thus allowing the rear and front wheels to turn at different rates around a curve. As noted above, the SH-AWD can take 100% of the power shunted through the rear differentials and variably direct power to each wheel, up to 100% of that power to the outside rear wheel. Adding power to the outside rear wheel on a turn has a steering effect on the vehicle which can greatly improve vehicle handling dynamics through the reduction of oversteer and more <b>balanced</b> <b>handling.</b> In limited situations, the vehicle may exhibit power oversteer, characteristic of more sporty rear-wheel-drive vehicles.|$|R

It was initially planned to be a 64DD game, but was later announced as being developed as a cartridge-based Nintendo 64 game. It was the first game in the series to use 3D graphics; according to Nakamura, they had aimed to evolve the series dramatically by introducing this 3D engine, which allowed for free roaming and open environments. They focused on creating original features, as opposed to the simultaneously developed Game Boy Color game Shiren the Wanderer GB2, for which they were forced to focus on [...] "traditional dungeon types" [...] due to the limitations of the Game Boy Color hardware.

40|$|Retail store {{managers}} may {{not follow}} order advices generated by an automated inventory replenishment system if their incentives dier from the cost minimization {{objective of the}} system or if they perceive the system to be suboptimal. We study the ordering behavior of retail store managers in a supermarket chain to characterize such deviations in ordering behavior and investigate their potential drivers. Using orders, shipments, and POS data for 19; 417 item-store combinations over 5 stores, we nd that store managers systematically modify automated order advices by advancing orders from peak to non-peak days. We show that order advancement is explained signicantly by hypothesized product characteristics, such as case-pack size relative to average demand per item, net shelf space, product variety, demand uncertainty, and seasonality error. Our results suggest that store managers add value. They improve upon the automated replenishment system by incorporating two ignored factors: in-store handling costs and sales improvement potential through better in-stock. We test a heuristic procedure, based on our regression results, to modify order advices to mimic the behavior of store managers. Our method performs better than the store managers by achieving a more <b>balanced</b> <b>handling</b> workload with similar average days of inventory...|$|R

30|$|For the {{production}} of safe and high quality drinking water the research project PRiMaT aims at {{the development of a}} risk-based master plan for handling trace pollutants and pathogens in drinking water supplies. The concept will be based on three pillars: risk analysis, risk mitigation and risk communication. Risk analysis will focus on a description of sources and propagation scenarios for emerging pollutants and pathogens in water catchment areas. Therefore molecular biological methods for microorganisms as well as concepts for the characterisation of trace pollutants, nano materials and pathogens will be developed and validated. With regard to risk mitigation technical solutions for raw water treatment as effective barrier especially against polar trace pollutants will be applied, combing innovative oxidation technologies with biological treatment steps. In addition novel adsorption-based and membrane-based technologies for selective removal of trace pollutants will be investigated. Risk communication will include educational measures and communication concepts for a <b>balanced</b> <b>handling</b> of risks from a water supplier’s perspective. Furthermore a concept for educational measures at schools will be developed to increase consumer’s awareness for drinking water issues in the long-term. Finally, examples from the past will be studied to learn about experiences on communication between water utilities and consumers and to identify areas for improvement.|$|R

Moreover, our method is computationally efficient, which makes it attractive for hand-held devices. The algorithm uses motion detection to display correctly moving objects in the sequence.
