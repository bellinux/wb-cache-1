5|$|As {{the area}} boomed {{following}} {{the discovery of the}} Comstock Lode, the Bowers claim proved to hold one of the richest seams of silver ore in what would become Nevada, and <b>because</b> <b>their</b> claim was close to the surface, it was easily extracted without initial capital investment.

5000|$|In 1979, {{the house}} and office were listed {{together}} on the National Register of Historic Places. [...] They qualified for inclusion on the Register both <b>because</b> of <b>their</b> contribution to local history and <b>because</b> of <b>their</b> architecture. As virtually no changes have been made either to the house or to the office — inside or out — they are excellent examples of early twentieth-century Queen Anne architecture, especially <b>because</b> of <b>their</b> location adjacent to each other. Moreover, these buildings are significant <b>because</b> of <b>their</b> place as a house-and-office combination of a typical early twentieth-century doctor.|$|R

5|$|Divers are aquatic birds {{the size}} of a large duck, to which they are unrelated. They swim well and fly {{adequately}} but, <b>because</b> <b>their</b> legs are placed towards the rear of the body, are clumsy on land. They feed on fish and other aquatic animals.|$|E
5|$|Enterprises' episodes {{were usually}} junked <b>because</b> <b>their</b> rights {{agreements}} with the actors and writers to sell the programmes abroad had expired.

50|$|Some {{species and}} {{varieties}} are gaining in popularity as garden plants, partly <b>because</b> of <b>their</b> herbal and culinary value. partly <b>because</b> of <b>their</b> Karooid character, and partly <b>because</b> of <b>their</b> attractive, persistently snowy appearance, both in flower and in seed. They also are valued in bird-friendly gardens, because some {{species of birds}} actively collect the woolliness of the empty seed follicles for their nests.|$|R

5|$|Fin skeletons are {{elongated}} {{and supported}} with soft and unsegmented rays named ceratotrichia, filaments of elastic protein resembling the horny keratin in hair and feathers.

50|$|Antibubbles are {{a common}} but widely unrecognized phenomenon, in part <b>because</b> of <b>their</b> {{resemblance}} to air bubbles, and in part <b>because</b> of <b>their</b> typically , or short-lived, nature. With certain (soapy) solutions, they {{can be made to}} last much longer.|$|R

5|$|Most {{species of}} the Hydrophiinae are able to respire through {{the top of their}} skin.
