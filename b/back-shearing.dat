40|$|The {{three-dimensional}} (3 D) {{evolution of}} the Australian-Pacifi c late boundary in the central South Island of New Zealand is investigated by analysing seismic data from the South Island GeopHysical Transect (SIGHT) project and by using a novel 3 D tomography inversion method, FMTOMO. A 380 km-long, 350 km-wide and 56 km-deep 3 D tomography image of the P-wave velocity structure and interface geometry of the crust and upper-mantle is constructed by inverting for 164, 048 traveltime picks. The picks are both coincident (in-line) and oblique (cross-line) to the survey geometry. The traveltime picks and station elevations were static corrected and reduced to basement level, respectively, to eliminate the highly variable sedimentary component of the inversion process. Synthetic testing of the model space was carried out to help {{the interpretation of the}} solution model features. Some model features are consistent with previous results. Usual crustal velocities (5. 5 km/s close to the surface and 6. 3 km/s {{at the bottom of the}} crust) are found at distal ends of the collision zone. Lower velocities (5. 7 km/s) intrude the mid-crust of the Australian plate to depths of about 20 km, which is consistent with the downward flexure of the Australian plate. A low velocity zone (5. 9 - 6. 1 km/s) is situated to the southeast of the Alpine fault, which is consistent with the Alpine fault low velocity zone. Furthermore, a high-velocity body (6. 3 km/s) is observed in the top 10 km of the upper-crust immediately above the thickened crust between the west coast of the South Island and the Main Divide of the Southern Alps. This body is interpreted as a drier, more rigid body of schist. A zone of low velocity (5. 8 km/s reaching 8 km depth) is observed immediately to the southeast of the aforementioned high velocity body. The feature is interpreted as a <b>back-shearing</b> faulting structure through which fluid escape towards the surface. A flexural analysis of an apparent flexure profile of the Australian Plate along SIGHT line 01 yielded a flexural parameter, a, of 89 km, an elastic thickness, Te, of 14 km and a flexural rigidity, D, of 1. 5 : 10 ^(23) N. m. These results are consistent with results of a flexural analysis of SIGHT line 02 W [Harrison 1999]. The following features are derived from the solution model. An apparent gradient in uppermantle anisotropy is observed with seismic velocities increasing towards the south of the model. Also, the geometry of the Mohorovicic discontinuity is apparently smooth between the two main SIGHT transects. The tomography method used in this project proves to be complementary to other coarser-scale and finer-scale seismic studies of the region in that it brings out features that were not seen by them. Notwithstanding that the interface inversion process remains to be perfected in the software, the velocity inversion produced a satisfactory solution model...|$|E
40|$|It is {{well known}} that there exist three {{singular}} points, U 2 c 5 6 f/k and U 5 c, where the corresponding levels will be called inertia critical levels (ICLs) and the classic critical level (CCL), in the equation governing a two-dimensional, rotating, continuously stratified, hydrostatic, <b>back-sheared</b> Boussinesq flow. Here U and c are basic wind and phase speed, respectively; f is the Coriolis force; and k is the wavenumber. The effects of these critical levels on flows over an isolated mountain ridge are investigated both analytically and numerically, based on a broad range of Rossby numbers (Ro) and Richardson numbers (Ri). Each wave mode generated from the isolated mountain with a continuous spectrum has its own ICL. To indicate the net effects of all ICLs, the authors define the effective ICL as the height above which the amplitude of the inertia-gravity wave mode is very small. The findings for linear flows are summarized as follows. Regime I is inertia-gravity waves. The flow behaves like unsheared inertia-gravity waves and the effective lower ICL plays a similar role as the CCL does in a nonrotating flow. Regime II is combined inertia-gravity waves and baroclinic lee waves. These waves behave like those in regime I below the lower effective ICL, and like baroclinic lee waves near the CCL. In this regime, the horizontal warm advection by the baroclinic lee wave {{plays an important role in}} the formation of the lee pressure trough. On the other hand, near the downslope of the mountain...|$|R
