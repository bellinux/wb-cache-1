Since embedded systems generally run continuously during their whole lifetime, fragmentation {{is one of}} the most important factors in designing the memory allocator. This paper focuses on minimizing fragmentation while other requirements are still satisfied. To minimize fragmentation, a part of a memory region is segregated by the proposed <b>budgeting</b> <b>method</b> that exploits the memory profile of the given application. The <b>budgeting</b> <b>method</b> can be applied for any existing memory allocators.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a comprehensive comparison {{of theory and}} practice of the most established capital <b>budgeting</b> <b>methods</b> in Germany based on our survey results. For this purpose we have sent questionnaires to CEOs and CFOs of all companies listed in the German all share index (CDAX) to find out which capital <b>budgeting</b> <b>methods</b> are currently used by German managers and how accurately they apply them. We cover with our survey not only the most important capital <b>budgeting</b> <b>methods</b> classified in the three groups of fundamental capital <b>budgeting</b> <b>methods,</b> risk adjustment methods and valuation methods but also other relevant fields of corporate finance like cost of capital and capital structure. We confront some of our survey results with prior German and recent international studies to obtain an insight into current domestic developments and to gauge how up-to-date German managers are in an international context. Based on these findings, we are able to examine whether executives follow the shareholder value principle when applying capital <b>budgeting</b> <b>methods.</b> We regress the most prominent corporate performance figures, return on equity and total investment return on the application frequency of particular capital <b>budgeting</b> <b>methods</b> to assess whether the usage of such methods has an impact on performance. To {{the best of our knowledge}} our paper is the first to exploit this approach. We conclude that German managers do not seem to follow the shareholder value principle when applying capital <b>budgeting</b> <b>methods.</b> Furthermore, we show that executives seem to be hesitant to implement residual income valuation methods as a key tool for the ex post performance measurement of a company. Finally, we provide evidence that the usage of capital <b>budgeting</b> <b>methods</b> and their proper application has a much greater impact on corporate performance than observable personal characteristics of top managers and fundamental properties of their companies...|$|R
40|$|This study {{develops}} a yield-based capital <b>budgeting</b> <b>method</b> {{that is consistent}} in maximizing shareholder wealth in six out of seven preconditioned environments. Academic studies surveying corporate management consistently conclude that corporate management prefers a yield-based capital <b>budgeting</b> <b>method,</b> such as the IRR, to a discount cash flow model, such as the NPV. This preference is strong with the NPV and EAA methods typically ranked as least favorable among corporate managment and yield-based methods ranked most favorable. However, previous yield-based methods are not consistent in maximizing shareholder wealth in many economic environments. The capital <b>budgeting</b> <b>method</b> developed in this study appeases corporate management’s preference for a yield-based measure while maintaining the Fisherian assumption of wealth maximization. To maintain wealth maximization, this study demonstrates that the yield-based measure must distinguish between financing and investment cash flows, adjust to investments with differing economic lives, recognize the time disparity in the cash flow stream between mutually exclusive investments, and maintain the value additive principle...|$|E

40|$|In this essay, {{we study}} the capital <b>budgeting</b> <b>method</b> called real options analysis. The method is, by many researchers, {{considered}} superior to other capital budgeting methods {{since it is}} able to value flexibilities within projects. Among practitioners, however, the method has not had a large breakthrough, although it has existed for almost three decades. This indicates that there are problems with the method impeding the implementation and these problems are the interest of this essay. We have conducted a literature study, where we try to create a picture of what the academic world thinks are the largest problems with the method. We have also conducted an interview study, where we interviewed companies, in the Gothenburg region, to get a picture of what they look for in a capital <b>budgeting</b> <b>method</b> and what problems real options analysis would experience in the companies.

40|$|This study empirically {{examines}} capital <b>budgeting</b> <b>methods.</b> Based on 115 {{responses from}} a cross-sectional survey and two approaches to contingency fit, this study produces three basic findings. First, both {{discounted cash flow}} (DCF) techniques and nonfinancial measures are widely used in capital budgeting. However, DCF techniques {{are more important than}} nonfinancial measures, and nonfinancial measures appear to serve as a partial substitute when DCF analysis is less efficient. Second, DCF techniques and nonfinancial measures are not unconditionally appropriate. Although the impact of firm strategy on capital <b>budgeting</b> <b>methods</b> is not supported by the present results, the study shows that product standardization affects both capital <b>budgeting</b> <b>methods,</b> as hypothesized. Firms with high product standardization tend to place more emphasis on DCF analysis, while firms with low standardization are more likely to focus on nonfinancial measures. Third, an appropriate fit under contingency theory between product standardization and the two capital <b>budgeting</b> <b>methods</b> is significantly associated with a firm's satisfaction with the capital budgeting process.

40|$|In Mediterranean environments, {{evaporation}} is a {{key component}} of lake water budgets. This applies to Lake Baratz in Sardinia, Italy, a closed lake that almost dried up in 2008 after a succession of years with low seasonal rainfall. We used the energy <b>budget</b> <b>method</b> and Penman's equation to estimate evaporation over Lake Baratz. We measured, using a raft station, water temperature at the surface and at 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 m depth, as well as air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and net radiation over a period of three years. We also compared Penman's equation and the energy <b>budget</b> <b>method</b> in two other climatic zones using published data. Our results indicate that mean yearly evaporation over Lake Baratz was 950 mm. On an annual scale evaporation estimated by Penman was 18 % higher than by the energy <b>budget</b> <b>method,</b> with monthly difference ranging between − 38 and + 60 %. Solar radiation and heat storage were found {{to be the most important}} energy fluxes to and from the lake and had the greatest effect on evaporation rates for the energy <b>budget</b> <b>method.</b> The bias between the two methods has a seasonal cycle due to the storage and release of energy from the lake. Energy advected to and from the lake by precipitation, surface water, and ground water had minor effect on evaporation rates. Lake Baratz, like other lakes in a Mediterranean environment, is particularly sensitive to the summer hot and dry climate. In contrast, we found that rates of evaporation estimated from Penman and the energy <b>budget</b> <b>methods</b> over tropical African lakes were nearly constant over the entire year and the difference between the two methods smaller. Difference between the two methods for north American lakes is also smaller probably owing to the ice-cover season and to lower radiation and lower temperatures during summer...|$|R

40|$|M. Com. (Business Management) All valuations {{of mineral}} assets in South Africa are {{guided by the}} South African Mineral Resources Committee (SAMREC) and South African Mineral Valuation (SAMVAL) codes. They have also been adopted by the Johannesburg Securities Exchange (JSE) {{in order to protect}} shareholders. Different capital {{budgeting}} methods are used for mineral assets valuation in South Africa. These are the net present value (NPV), internal rate of return (IRR), payback period, cost, market and real options methods. It is not known which capital <b>budgeting</b> <b>method</b> is most often used for mining property valuations, as South African mining companies and associations are not required to share their capital budgeting processes with the public. In addition, the SAMVAL code does not recommend the use of the real options method and no reasons are provided. The study was aimed at establishing the capital <b>budgeting</b> <b>method</b> most often used for mining property valuations in South Africa, as well as the reasons why the real options method is not recommended by the SAMVAL code. A judgement sample of expert valuators was utilised in the study and interviews were carried out using open ended questions. The research revealed that NPV is the capital <b>budgeting</b> <b>method</b> most often used for mining property valuations followed by the IRR method. Outside South Africa, Bhappu & Guzman (1995) found that these preferences were reversed. Since the IRR method represents a notional rather than an actual return on investment, South African valuators were found to be more rational than their overseas counterparts in the application of these discounted cash flow (DCF) methods. The findings also revealed that the cost, market and payback methods were less preferred to the NPV and IRR methods. The reasons given were all consistent with the theory. The cost method was avoided because it uses historical cost data which is not usually applicable, the market method was limited {{due to the lack of}} available information on truly comparable projects and the payback method was shunned for undervaluing mining properties by ignoring cash flows that arrive after the payback period. The respondents also indicated that the real options method is the least used. The method (which includes the value of embedded optionality) was regarded as complex and not widely understood and this was also thought to explain why it is not recommended by the SAMVAL code. This finding indicated that in South Africa the embedded optionality in mining projects may not be taken into account and as a result, opportunities for the exploitation of its mineral assets could be missed...|$|E

However, the formulation in [9] does not consider flip-flop (FF) minimization, which is important in practical applications. Here, we propose a new sequential budgeting algorithm, C-SBGT, that not only controls the FF count, but also can be solved more efficiently compared to [9].
