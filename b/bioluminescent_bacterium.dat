However, {{when they are}} highly concentrated in the photophore (about [...] cells/ml), transcription of luciferase is induced, leading to bioluminescence.|$|E

The Bioluminescent Nudes series is the most recent starting in 2017. In Living Drawings Cole created drawings with living <b>bioluminescent</b> <b>bacteria</b> and photographed them as they grow and die.

40|$|<b>Bioluminescent</b> <b>bacteria</b> {{have been}} studied during a one-year survey in 2011 at the deep ANTARES site (Northwestern Mediterranean Sea, 2000 m depth). The {{neutrino}} underwater telescope ANTARES, located at this station, {{has been used to}} record the bioluminescence at the same depth. Together with these data, environmental variables (potential temperature, salinity, nutrients, dissolved organic carbon and oxygen) have been characterized in water samples. The year 2011 was characterized by relatively stable conditions, as revealed by minor variability in the monitored oceanographic variables, by low bioluminescence and low current speed. This suggests weak eukaryote participation and mainly non-stimulated light emission. Hence, no processes of dense water have affected the ANTARES station during this survey. Abundance of <b>bioluminescent</b> <b>bacteria</b> belonging to Photobacterium genus, measured by qPCR of the luxF gene, ranged from 1. 4 x 10 (2) to 7. 2 x 10 (2) genes mL(- 1). Their effective activity was confirmed through mRNA luxF quantification. Our results reveal that <b>bioluminescent</b> <b>bacteria</b> appeared more active than the total counterpart of bacteria, suggesting an ecological benefit of this feature such as favoring interaction with macro-organisms. Moreover, these results show that part of the bioluminescence, recorded at 2000 m depth over one year, could be due to <b>bioluminescent</b> <b>bacteria</b> in stable hydrological conditions.

40|$|Our {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to make safe and easy access for students to basic microbiological experiments at high schools and universities. We used a marine <b>bioluminescent</b> <b>bacterium,</b> Photobacterium phosphoreum strain OC 2 - 1 at four classes, one in a high school in 2005 and other in 2008, and other two in a university in 2006. At the beginning of each class, all students learned the principle of obtaining bacterial single colonies by dilution, and practiced streaking and spreading OC 2 - 1 cultures onto agar media after serial dilution. University students further conducted three kinds of experiments to study the effects of oxygen depletion, osmotic stress and immobilization by alginate calcium on the bacterial luminescence. In 2008 ’s practice, a hand-made luminometer which was comprised of a solar battery and a voltmeter was used to monitor the light output from the bacterial culture. According to the results of the questionnaire to ask students for their opinions on the practice, we concluded that the experiments with <b>bioluminescent</b> <b>bacterium</b> captured students' interests, and fostered better understanding of microorganisms...|$|E
40|$|Recent reports {{suggest that}} the {{selective}} advantage of bioluminescence for bacteria is mediated by light-dependent stimulation of photolyase to repair DNA lesions. Despite evidence for this model, photolyase mutants have not been characterized in a naturally <b>bioluminescent</b> <b>bacterium,</b> nor has this hypothesis been tested in bioluminescent bacteria under natural conditions. We have now characterized the photolyase encoded by phr in the <b>bioluminescent</b> <b>bacterium</b> Vibrio fischeri ES 114. Consistent with Phr possessing photolyase activity, phr conferred light-dependent resistance to UV light. However, upon comparing ES 114 to a phr mutant and a dark ΔluxCDABEG mutant, we found that bioluminescence did not detectably affect photolyase-mediated resistance to UV light. Addition of the light-stimulating autoinducer N- 3 -oxo-hexanoyl homoserine lactone appeared to increase UV resistance, but this was independent of photolyase or bioluminescence. Moreover, although bioluminescence confers an advantage for V. fischeri during colonization of its natural host, Euprymna scolopes, the phr mutant colonized this host to {{the same level as}} the wild type. Taken together, our results indicate that at least in V. fischeri strain ES 114, the benefits of bioluminescence during symbiotic colonization are not mediated by photolyase, and although some UV resistance mechanism may be coregulated with bioluminescence, we found no evidence that light production benefits cells by stimulating photolyase in this strain...|$|E

5000|$|<b>Bioluminescent</b> <b>bacteria</b> {{are most}} {{abundant}} in marine environments during spring blooms {{when there are}} high nutrient concentrations. These light-emitting organisms are found mainly in coastal waters near the outflow of rivers, such as the northern Adriatic Sea, Gulf of Trieste, northwestern part of the Caspian Sea, coast of Africa and many more. These are known as milky seas. <b>Bioluminescent</b> <b>bacteria</b> are also found in freshwater and terrestrial environments but are less wide spread than in seawater environments. They are found globally, as free-living, symbiotic or parasitic forms [...] and possibly as opportunistic pathogens. Factors that affect the distribution of <b>bioluminescent</b> <b>bacteria</b> include temperature, salinity, nutrient concentration, pH level and solar radiation. For example, Aliivibrio fischeri grows favourably in environments that have temperatures between 5 to 30°C and a pH that is less than 6.8; whereas, Photobacterium phosphoreum thrives in conditions that have temperatures between 5 and 25°C and a pH that is less than 7.0.|$|R

50|$|The wide-ranged {{biological}} {{purposes of}} bio-luminescence include {{but are not}} limited to attraction of mates, defense against predators, and warning signals. In the case of <b>bioluminescent</b> <b>bacteria,</b> bio-luminescence mainly serves as a form of dispersal. It has been hypothesized that enteric bacteria (bacteria that survive in the guts of other organisms) - especially those prevalent in the depths of the ocean - employ bio-luminescence as an effective form of distribution. After making their way into the digestive tracts of fish and other marine organisms and being excreted in fecal pellets, <b>bioluminescent</b> <b>bacteria</b> are able to utilize their bio-luminescent capabilities to lure in other organisms and prompt ingestion of these bacterial-containing fecal pellets. The bio-luminescence of bacteria thereby ensures their survival, persistence, and dispersal as they are able to enter and inhabit other organisms.|$|R
50|$|Another {{example of}} quorum sensing by <b>bioluminescent</b> <b>bacteria</b> is by Vibrio harveyi, which {{are known to}} be free-living.

50|$|<b>Bioluminescent</b> <b>{{bacteria}}</b> are light-producing {{bacteria that}} are predominantly present in sea water, marine sediments, {{the surface of}} decomposing fish and in the gut of marine animals.

These bacteria may be free living (such as Vibrio harveyi) or in symbiosis with animals such as the Hawaiian Bobtail squid (Aliivibrio fischeri) or terrestrial nematodes (Photorhabdus luminescens). The host organisms provide these bacteria a safe home and sufficient nutrition. In exchange, the hosts use the light produced by the bacteria for camouflage, prey and/or mate attraction. <b>Bioluminescent</b> <b>bacteria</b> have evolved symbiotic relationships with other organisms in which both participants benefit close to equally.
