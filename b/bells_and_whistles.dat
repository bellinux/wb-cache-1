In 1865, Joseph Henry of the Smithsonian Institution, the Chairman of the Lighthouse Board, set up <b>bells</b> <b>and</b> <b>whistles</b> and tested the distances they could be heard. In 1879, a steam fog whistle was installed {{at the cost of}} $5000. In 1902, a air siren was installed and powered by two 16½ horsepower engines and used in an experiment in sound penetration. In 1934, a Leslie-Tyfon trumpet was installed.|$|E

Later, when Kurt is at the Winter Showcase to support Rachel, she sees him moved by Rachel's piece, and announces that he will be auditioning after the intermission. Though he initially panics, Rachel convinces him that he doesn't need his <b>bells</b> <b>and</b> <b>whistles</b> to perform, and he chooses to sing [...] "Being Alive" [...] from Company, which impresses the NYADA audience, and he later gets a letter telling him that he has gotten in.|$|E

50|$|Against this backdrop, the FM2 {{may have}} seemed an anachronism, yet it sold well.

The FM2 was not designed for budget-minded snapshooters who would never bother to learn to utilize shutter-speeds and aperture settings, but rather was intended to appeal to serious photographers who demanded a tough, rugged camera.

500|$|Greatest Hits: My Prerogative {{received}} generally favorable {{reviews from}} critics. James Griffiths of The Guardian commented: [...] "Here comes the Queen of Pop {{in a box}} so shiny you can see your face in it. Spears is described on the cover as 'the ultimate video performer', and watching the 20 promos contained within, it's difficult to argue. [...] Relentlessly thrusting herself at the camera, compulsively preening amid special FX galas, Britney is the MTV video age in human form." [...] He also complimented the innovations of the menu, but added that [...] "it's not particularly impressive" [...] and [...] "you need to be pretty nifty with your handset to find them." [...] Music Week said: [...] "The DVD version of Spears' high-flying 'best of' set adds <b>bells</b> <b>and</b> <b>whistles</b> to the audio version at only a slight premium pricewise.

500|$|... "Beat Goes On" [...] {{received}} generally mixed {{to positive}} reviews from music critics. Caryn Ganz of Rolling Stone {{felt that the}} usage of <b>bells</b> <b>and</b> <b>whistles</b> as instrumentation, along with the disco sounds made the track connect to two of Madonna's inspirations, that of Chic, and Donna Summer. Ganz went on to criticize West's appearance, calling it [...] "uninspired". In a similar review, Thomas Hauner of PopMatters wrote that the song [...] "continues the Donna Summer touch, this time opting for 'beep beep' vocals on a surprisingly sweet track." [...] Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine believed that compared to the demo, the final version had lost an individuality, but complimented the addition of West, feeling that it [...] "transports [...] from 2001 to 1979". Talia Soghomolian of musicOMH praised [...] "the variations in its tempo", making it [...] "the perfect dance floor tune, merging old school and modern takes on urbanity."

Ian Nathan of Empire gives the film only two of a {{possible}} five stars, observing that the film [...] "still ranks {{as one of the most}} forgettable Bonds on record." [...] In 2006, IGN chose For Your Eyes Only as the sixth best Bond film, claiming it is [...] "a good old-fashioned espionage tale", a placement shared by Norman Wilner of MSN, who considered it [...] "the one Moore film that seems to reach back to Connery's heyday", and Entertainment Weekly chose it as the tenth best in 2008, saying it was a [...] "return to low-tech, low-key Bond ... some of the best stunts since the early days". In October 2008 Time Out re-issued a review of For Your Eyes Only and observed that the film is [...] "admirable in intent" [...] but that it [...] "feels a little spare", largely because the plot has been [...] "divested of the <b>bells</b> <b>and</b> <b>whistles</b> that hallmark the franchise".|$|E

Chesapeake and Ohio 2716 was re-lettered as Southern 2716, and, even though the Southern had never owned any Berkshires, 2716 was configured to look like a Southern locomotive, including moving the head light {{to the center of the}} smoke box, <b>and</b> the locomotive’s <b>bell</b> <b>and</b> <b>whistle</b> were changed.|$|R

Several reviewers identified Portal 2 as an early contender for [...] "Game of the Year", while others called {{it one of the}} best games of all time.

Eurogamer's Oli Welsh said that the game avoids the normal pitfalls that developers introduce in sequels, stating that [...] "Portal is perfect. Portal 2 is not. It's something better than that.". Gus Mastrapa of The A.V.

500|$|WWE SmackDown! Shut Your Mouth and WWE SmackDown!

It improved from the previous three WWF SmackDown! games, as {{it was written by}} actual WWE storyline writers. Both games also featured generic music, though the quality of it had improved. Shut Your Mouth featured little improvement to the commentary, which was then removed completely from Here Comes the Pain. WWE SmackDown! vs. RAW received a more positive review than previous games, as GameShark stated that it was [...] "a wonderful new edition to the SmackDown! family, serving up slick graphics, vastly enhanced gameplay, and lots of other <b>bells</b> <b>and</b> <b>whistles</b> that make the whole package shine." [...] WWE SmackDown! vs. RAW 2006 received a positive review and a 9.2/10 rating by IGN due to the additions of matches, the General Manager mode, and the ability to defend championships in exhibition mode. WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2008 {{received more}} negative reviews due to lack of an appealing season mode and little improvement of features, with the exceptions of the [...] "Ultimate Control moves," [...] "Struggle system," [...] and the ECW Extreme Rules matches.|$|E

5000|$|The FE2 was {{intended}} by Nikon as a quality {{alternative to the}} more cheaply built 35 mm amateur SLRs by other manufacturers of the day. It {{can be described as}} Nippon Kogaku’s Nikon FM2 mechanical (springs, gears, levers) camera with precision electronic controls grafted on. Its unusual roots were most obvious in its backup ability to operate without batteries - albeit in a limited fashion: completely manual mechanical control with limited shutter speeds (1/250th second, marked M250, or Bulb) and without the light meter. The FE2 shared the luxurious bearing-mounted film advance and transport mechanism of its other high-level cameras, and many were used by professional photographers. The FE2’s deliberately conservative external features (no program modes or matrix metering) were not intended to appeal to beginners, but rather to experienced photographers who required a reliable camera capable of withstanding extremes of climate, impacts, and extended use.

The ceremony occurred {{three days after}} Topping was divorced from his third wife, actress Arline Judge, who had been previously married to his brother Dan. Although worth millions when they married, Topping suffered heavy financial losses due to poor investments and excessive gambling. The couple's marriage resulted in a church trial for the officiant because the marriage took place {{less than a year}} after Topping's divorce from Judge. Cheryl Crane writes in her memoir that her mother's wedding to Bob Topping was a beautiful, lavish affair held in the spacious Topping family mansion in Greenwich, Connecticut, with all of the <b>bells</b> <b>and</b> <b>whistles</b> accompanying a traditional wedding. Despite the fact that both the bride and the groom had been married and divorced multiple times previously, Lana wore a traditional white gown, the bridesmaids wore equally beautiful gowns of Lana's choosing, and young Cheryl served as the flower girl. Crane goes on to state that she later saw this as her mother's attempt to finally have a beautiful, traditional wedding while she was still young after three failed marriages (to Artie Shaw and Steve Crane) in which the ceremonies took place before justices of the peace with Lana usually attired in a simple dress suit and heels.|$|E
500|$|The first song, [...] "Anything Goes", was {{recorded}} by Bennett for his 1959 collaboration with Count Basie and his Orchestra, Strike Up the Band, and Gaga {{first came to}} know about it when she was 13 years old.

Olivier added, [...] "Gaga's voice, when stripped of its <b>bells</b> <b>and</b> <b>whistles,</b> showcases a timelessness that lends itself well to the genre." [...] "I Can't Give You Anything but Love" [...] was originally written in 1928 by Jimmy McHugh and Dorothy Fields for the Broadway revue, Blackbirds of 1928.
