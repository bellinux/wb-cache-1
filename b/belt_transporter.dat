In the master's thesis author suggest a new simplified theory of crop flow inside the Power Flow header. The thesis contain the factors which can affect the crop flow and comparison between the Power Flow and competitor's header. The thesis also contain geometrical characteristics of crop for four types of cereal...|$|E
40|$|Several {{high-temperature}} (to 500 C) heat-storage systems using sand as {{the storage}} medium are described. The advantages of sand as a storage medium include low cost for sand, widespread availability, non-toxicity, non-degradation characteristics, easy containment, and safety. The systems considered include: stationary sand with closely spaced tubes throughout the volume, {{the use of}} a fluidized bed, use of conveyor <b>belt</b> <b>transporter,</b> and {{the use of a}} blower rapid transport system. For a stationary sand bed, very close spacing of heat transfer tubes throughout the volume is required, manifesting as high power related system cost. The suggestion of moving sand past or around pipes is intended to reduce the power related costs at the penalty of added system complexity. Preliminary system cost estimates are offered. These rough calculations indicate that mobile sand heat storage systems cost less than the stationary sand approach...|$|E
40|$|A {{pilot scale}} {{horizontal}} {{vacuum belt filter}} was used to dewater smuts mud and to filter cane mud. The filter gave good results on smuts dewatering, offering several advantages over the existing system, {{including the fact that}} no flocculant is required. Large scale units of this type are to be used at the Maidstone and Felixton II mills for smuts dewatering. The performance on cane mud filtration was encouraging. Filtercake of the same or better quality as produced by the rotary drum filters could be obtained. General Description The horizontal vacuum belt filter (HBF) consists of two endless belts, one running inside the other. The inner <b>belt,</b> called the <b>transporter</b> <b>belt,</b> is a heavy rubber belt with raised ribs across its width. Raised curbs contain the slurry. The oute...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Transport {{of ground}} and coal {{at the surface}} coal dig in Kostolac, Serbia, is done using {{transportation}} belts (3 - 5 kilometres in length) using the systems of BTR (Bagger-Transporter-Remover) and BTM (Bagger-Transporter-Mill). The <b>transporter</b> <b>belt</b> during circular movement is suspended on carry-rollers (during transport of weight) and on support-rollers (without weight). Two or three carry-rollers, or three support-rollers make a garland. Garlands (5 carry and 3 supporting) are built into a section and they enable the movement of belt over them. The number of sections depends on the transportation system length. Reliability of these systems is governed by {{the reliability of the}} carry and support rollers. In order to determine the reliability of the BTR and BTM systems, reliability analysis of both carry and support rollers was performed using the method of Fault Tree Analysis (FTA) and Reliability Block Diagrams (RBD). In this paper the assessment of roller reliability is described using the FTA method with failure elements. The reliability function was determined {{on the basis of the}} RBD in the case where all of the constructive elements of the rollers are in operation – the complex relationship, and when some of the elements are in failure mode – the quasi-complex relationship...|$|R
40|$|Edible {{fats and}} oils have a {{peculiar}} role in food science, technology and nutrition; besides being solely energy source, they are important as carrier of bioactive molecules as antioxidants, hormones and vitamins precursors or having themselves such roles. Natural {{fats and oils}} need anyway for an extraction step, before it, raw matter undergoes to processes that can contaminate them: harvesting mechanical devices, <b>transporter</b> <b>belts,</b> piping, valves etc. to end with storage and packaging. In the case of seeds, they can be stored for long times before extraction; {{in order to avoid}} some degradation depending on enzymatic activity or biotic agents as molds and microorganisms, the content of water must be reduced: drying can be a source of contamination. In this paper, details will be given concerning selected organic contaminants (Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons – PAHs-, Mineral Oil Saturated Hydrocarbons – MOSH-, Mineral Oils Aromatic Hydrocarbons – MOAH-, Phtalates). PAHs contamination can be removed by refining, of course, preventing contamination is a more suitable strategy; limits for PAHs in fats and oils had been established by different Countries legislation, of course to check for contamination, analytical methods are required; some matrix problems arise so that a purification step must be applied, as well. Mineral oils contamination depends on a number of different sources, packaging being involved, too, in this case, selected analytical methods had been developed by applying advanced hyphenated chromatographic techniques, too, while in the case of phtalates severe blank problems must be kept in mind to avoid false positive results...|$|R
40|$|Damages -reduced in fruit packing {{lines is}} {{a major cause of}} grace {{reduction}} and quality loos in fresh marks: fruit. Fruit must be treated gently during in sir handling to improve their qualityin order to get a good price in a competitive market. The correct post-hardvest handling in fruit packing lines is a prerequisite to cut down the heavy post-harvest losses. Fruit packing lines must be evaluated, studying their design, the impacts applied to the fruits, the characteristics of the materials, etc. This study establishes the possibility of carrying out modifications and tests in a packing line during a long period of time. For this purpose, an experimental fruit packing line has been designed and located in the Agricultural Engineering Department of the Polythecnic University of Madrid with the aim of improving mechanical devices and fruit handling conditions to minimize damage to fruit. The experimental line consists of several transporting <b>belts,</b> one rollers <b>transporter,</b> one sizer, one elevator, one singularizer, and three trays to receive the calibrated fruit. The line has a length of 6. 15 m and a width cf 1. 9 m. Movement of the different components is regulated by electric motors with variable velocity electronically controlled. The height of the transfer points is variable and can be easily modified. The experimental line has been calibrated using two instrumented spheres IS 100 (8. 8 cm Ø and 6. 2 cm Ø). Average acceleration values obtained in all the transfers of the experimental line lay under 80 g's, although there is big variation for some of them being some values above 100 g's...|$|R
