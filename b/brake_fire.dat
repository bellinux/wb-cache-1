50|$|The Su-17 entered {{service with}} the Soviet Air Force in 1970. The {{aircraft}} {{was used by}} both the Soviets and the Afghanistan government forces during the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. High-altitude airfields and hot dusty climate created special operational challenges. In the summer, the takeoff roll of the Su-17 increased 1.5-fold and landings frequently ended with burst tires and <b>brake</b> <b>fires.</b> Avionics failures were common due to heat and sand contamination.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis study aims {{to analyze}} trends of aerosol optical {{thickness}} (AOT) generated from MODIS data which acquire from Terra / Aqua MODIS and PM 10 concentration distribution from 12 Pollution Control Department (PCD) air quality ground measurement {{stations in the}} period 2007 – 2010, and find their relationship to generate estimated PM 10 concentration maps for Upper Northern Thailand during the period 2007 - 2010 based on obtained relationships, {{as well as to}} study the situation of active fires in March from the years 2007 - 2010 in Chiang Rai province, where it was found most patients were affected by the haze in the year 2007. The results in this study showed that the trends of AOT and PM 10 go together in similar direction in the same trend, even though the equation for the relationship between AOT and PM 10 between year 2007 - 2011, from February to March, is Y = 57. 09 + 70. 93 which give the correlation R = 0. 32 is not very high. In the study, it also found the rate of active fire occurrence of Chiang Rai occurs 55 % in forested areas, 40 % in agricultural areas, 2 % in community area and 3 % in other areas. After checking on the fire occurrences on land cover, it was found also that burning areas were mostly found in forest areas and caused from the invasion of agriculture, such as rice and corn fields. Farmers tend to clear areas and eliminate weeds to prepare for planting the next season by burning. During burning period, in most cases, it lacks of <b>brake</b> <b>fire</b> in these areas, resulting in the spreading of fire. For agricultural land, farmers continue straw burning after harvesting, because it is easy and can save time. Therefore, to solve the pollution problem as a result of burning, stakeholders in all sectors should seriously work together, offer an alternative and transfer knowledge to farmers to reduce burning, using the results obtaining from this study, which remote sensing and GIS technology is applied...|$|E

50|$|An RTO {{is usually}} {{seen as one}} of the hardest tests an {{airplane}} has to undergo for its certification trials. The RTO test is performed under the worst possible conditions; i.e. with fully worn out brakes, the plane loaded to maximum takeoff weight and no use of thrust reversers. During an RTO test most of the kinetic energy of the airplane is converted to heat by the brakes, which may cause the fusible plugs of the tires to melt, causing them to deflate. Small <b>brake</b> <b>fires</b> are acceptable {{as long as they do}} not spread to the airplane body within five minutes (the maximum likely time for arrival of the airport fire fighters).|$|R

50|$|It was a {{thoroughly}} conventional gun, being a modernized version of Krupp's FK 73 gun, {{but failed to}} incorporate any recoil system other than a partially effective spade <b>brake,</b> and <b>fired</b> a 12-pound projectile. Thus it was rendered obsolete when the French introduced their Canon de 75 modèle 1897 the following year. Most guns were rebuilt to modern standards (only the barrel was retained) in 1904 as the 7.7 cm FK 96 n.A. (neuer Art) model which served throughout World War I as one of Germany's main light field guns. The remaining unmodified guns were then known as the 7.7 cm FK 96 a.A. (alte Art or old model).|$|R

50|$|The Electra landed safely at Anchorage International Airport, {{even with}} the loss of almost all flight controls. The crew had to shut down all engines once the {{aircraft}} was on the ground in order to help bring it to a stop; one tire blew out and the <b>brakes</b> caught <b>fire.</b> Nobody was hurt when the propeller hit the fuselage or during the emergency landing. The captain, 54-year-old James Gibson, with 5,700 hours' experience flying Electras, was honored for the successful landing by a meeting with President Ronald Reagan in the White House. The Airline Pilots Association also honored Captain Gibson, 39-year-old co-pilot Gary Lintner and 45-year-old flight engineer Gerald Laurin later in 1983 with its Superior Airmanship Award.|$|R
50|$|The two Ferrari drivers {{topped the}} {{timesheets}} {{in the second}} session on Friday afternoon, with Kimi Räikkönen one tenth of a second ahead of Vettel. Rosberg and Hamilton were third and fourth respectively, ahead of Daniel Ricciardo and Max Verstappen. After quick laps on the supersoft tyre compounds, the teams then turned to race simulation runs on higher fuel loads, with Mercedes splitting their drivers on the soft and medium compounds, while Ferrari continued their long runs on the supersoft tyres. Esteban Gutiérrez encountered problems when his rear <b>brakes</b> caught <b>fire,</b> causing him to spend much of the session in the garage. Following his crash in the first session, Magnussen did not take part as his team investigated {{the reason for his}} tyre failure.|$|R

50|$|The {{first part}} of the contest were {{technical}} trials, starting on August 4. Unlike the following Challenges, it was not too complicated and consisted of a technical evaluation, quick engine start test, quick wing folding test and fuel consumption trial only.The first was a technical evaluation of competing planes' construction. Such features, like twin controls, rich set of controls, wheel <b>brakes,</b> <b>fire</b> safety devices and a room for parachutes, could bring up to 18 points. Most points was given to the Italian Breda Ba-15s (11.75 to 12 pts) and German all-metal Junkers A50s (11.75 pts). Very good result of 11.25 points was obtained also by the Italian Fiat AS.1s and Romeo Ro-5s. The German BFW M.23b were given only 9.5 points, DH-60s - from 9.5 to 10.5 points, and the lowest result was 8 points (Caudron C.113).After quick wings' folding and quick engine starting tests, the classification leader was the Czech Josef Novak flying an Aero A.34 biplane, with 17.5 pts. Behind him, there were three Italians flying Romeo Ro-5 biplanes (17.25 pts), then the rest. The best German pilot, Wolf Hirth, had 16.25 pts (12th place, Klemm L.25), but most Germans had a few points less. Some planes were handicapped, not having folding wings. Some crews completed wings' folding trial on 6 August.The last was a fuel consumption test, on 6 x 50 km closed circuit, on 5 August. It could bring up to 20 points. The best result was obtained by the German Johannes Nehring flying a Darmstadt D-18 biplane (18.5 pts), then the Swiss Hans Wirth (Klemm L.25), three German Junkers A50 and two Czech Avia BH-11s, with 15-17 pts. The German Klemms also were good at this trial, with 12-14.5 pts.|$|R
50|$|For 1979, the styling was freshened {{with the}} {{addition}} of flush bumpers, a smoother grille with rectangular headlights and hidden turn signals, chrome strips on the tail-lamps, and larger rear glass for the hatchback. Inside, the steering wheel previously found only in the Arrow GT was now standard. The rear axle was also extended 2.5 inches for better traction. A sporty variant called the Fire Arrow was first offered this year, which had special decals and a sporty interior, as well as a 2.6 L I4 engine and four-wheel disc <b>brakes.</b> The <b>Fire</b> Arrow had one of the best horsepower/weight ratios among U.S. production cars at the time because of its light weight. For 1979 and the succeeding year, the 2.0 L I4 engine was unavailable as an engine option.|$|R
50|$|The gun had a semi-automatic, {{vertical}} {{sliding block}} breech that automatically ejected the cartridge case after firing, {{but had to}} be hand-loaded for the next shot. It had a standard hydro-pneumatic recoil system and a muzzle <b>brake.</b> It could <b>fire</b> a 6.5 kg armor-piercing shell for direct fire. It was intended for motor towing as it rode on a two-axle carriage with pneumatic wheels, but could be towed by horses if necessary. The side legs of the cruciform mount folded for transport.|$|R
50|$|The gunner {{does not}} have a hatch and is seated forward of the commander. The gunner has a x6 {{magnification}} periscope, as well as a x6 magnification sight. The main gun was the Type 61 90 millimeter calibre rifled gun with a horizontal sliding breach block. The gun is fitted with a t-shaped muzzle <b>brake,</b> which diverts <b>firing</b> gases sideways, and reduces the amount of dust kicked up by firing. A coaxial 7.62 millimeter machine gun is mounted next to the gun.|$|R
50|$|Ahead of the car's forward {{bulkhead}} the <b>brake</b> cylinders, <b>fire</b> extinguisher system, battery and radiator were {{carried on a}} tray-like extension to the cockpit floor pan, constructed in lighter 20 gauge aluminium sheet. Herd did consider using side-mounted radiators, but these were too complex to design and build in the time available. The car's fibreglass nose bodywork enclosing the radiator was relatively square, with a near-rectangular opening for the radiator intake. On {{either side of the}} radiator opening Herd placed small wings to generate downforce, moulded with the radiator cowl as a single unit. These wings were fixed in position, braced with a steel tube that spanned their full width, and carried adjustable trim tabs along their trailing edges. At the rear of the car a large, single-plane, adjustable wing was mounted atop the gearbox, between the rear wheels.|$|R
50|$|The GTV/Spider was {{equipped}} as standard with power steering, driver and passenger airbag, automatic air conditioning, front seatbelt pretensioners, Bosch ABS (with EBD from 1998), electric heated door mirrors, electric frameless windows with one-touch operation for the driver's side, height adjustable headlamps, {{front and rear}} foglights, third <b>brake</b> light, <b>fire</b> prevention system, reach and rake adjustable leather clad steering wheel, stitched leather gear knob, an automatic electric aerial, a stereo radio/cassette with six speakers and central locking with Alfa-CODE immobiliser, internal electric release for the bootlid and filler flap. The additional options were: alarm system, passenger-side airbag removal, electric heated seats (GTV only), metallic paint, iridescent paint (only with Lusso trim), leather MOMO seats (only with Lusso trim) and electric sunroof (GTV only). For the Spider some cars could be equipped with an electric hood folding mechanism.|$|R
50|$|If {{funded by}} the Russian space agency Roscosmos, it would be {{developed}} by the Russian Space Research Institute and NPO Lavochkin, based on Fobos-Grunt technology. Designs show a dome-shaped lander would separate from the orbiter and would enter the Martian atmosphere protected within an inflatable rubber <b>braking</b> cone and <b>fire</b> rockets for the final stage. Once a robotic arm selects and retrieves the samples (mass about 0.2 kg), a small rocket {{in the top of}} the lander would blast the ascent vehicle for rendezvous and docking with the orbiter for the soil sample transfer into the return vehicle.|$|R
50|$|On January 15 after 40 orbits, the <b>braking</b> rocket was <b>fired</b> at 16 km {{altitude}}, and {{the craft}} began to de-orbit. At {{an altitude of}} 750 m (2,460 ft) the main thrusters began firing, slowing the fall until a height of 22 m (72 ft) was reached. At this point the main thrusters shut down and the secondary thrusters ignited, slowing the fall until the lander was 1.5 m (5 ft) above the surface, where the engine was switched off. Landing occurred at 23:35 UT in Le Monnier crater at 25.85 degrees N, 30.45 degrees E.|$|R
50|$|The {{working life}} of the mills ended in 1906 and in 1908 Jill was damaged in a storm. She lost her fantail and sails over the years until in 1953 {{restoration}} {{was carried out by}} E Hole and Son, the Burgess Hill millwrights, funded by Cuckfield Rural District Council. In 1978, restoration of Jill to working order was commenced. Jill ground flour again in 1986. During the Great Storm of 1987, the mill's sails were set in motion with the <b>brake</b> on, setting <b>fire</b> to the mill. Some members of the Windmill Society were able to get to the mill and save her.|$|R
25|$|Three {{practice}} sessions—two on Friday and a {{third on}} Saturday—were held before the Sunday race. The Friday morning and afternoon sessions lasted ninety minutes each; the third, one-hour session was held on Saturday afternoon. In the first practice session, Alonso set the fastest lap {{with a time of}} one minute and 49.056 seconds, one-tenth of a second faster than Hamilton in second and Rosberg third. Vettel was fourth-fastest, ahead of Ricciardo and Jean-Éric Vergne. Kimi Räikkönen, Button, Daniil Kvyat and Pérez rounded out the session's top ten drivers. Although several drivers narrowly avoided damaging their cars, the session passed relatively smoothly. Vergne's battery was changed, causing him to miss the first hour, but after setting his fastest lap, his car stopped with an energy recovery system failure, ending his session early. Räikkonen's session also ended prematurely when his <b>brakes</b> caught <b>fire.</b> Vettel stopped at the pit lane exit with a sudden oil pressure loss, but was not issued with a ten-place grid penalty because he was running an older engine.|$|R
