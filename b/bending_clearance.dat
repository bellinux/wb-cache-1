40|$|AbstractRotor rubbing is {{a common}} fault of {{rotating}} machinery, and usually induced by other faults, such as <b>bending,</b> <b>clearance,</b> unbalance and so on. The essential characteristic of this fault is the impact and friction between rotor and stator, so this paper puts forward a method for representing the rubbing fault by identifying the suffered dynamic load of rotor and stator. The basic formula of load identification is built, and the measured impact response is used to replace the system real impulse response function. The experiment {{results show that the}} proposed method can effectively extract the impact components of rotor and stator, and detecting stator vibration signal is more effective to represent rubbing fault than that of rotor, and the analysis result has clear credibility. Meanwhile, the proposed method is convenient for practical engineering application...|$|E
50|$|The {{critical}} {{point in the}} whole line is the railway underpass at the Rimini railway station. It has a tight <b>bend</b> and limited <b>clearance,</b> forcing the trolleybuses to flatten their trolley poles near their roofs, with {{the risk that the}} trolley poles will come off the wires.|$|R
40|$|This {{computational}} work investigates {{planetary gear}} load sharing of three-mount suspension wind turbine gearboxes. A three dimensional multibody dynamic model is established, including gravity, bending moments, fluctuating mesh stiffness, nonlinear tooth contact, and bearing clearance. A flexible main shaft, planetary carrier, housing, and gear shafts are modeled using reduced degrees-of-freedom through modal compensation. This drivetrain model is validated against the experimental data of Gearbox Reliability Collaborative for gearbox internal loads. Planet load sharing is a combined effect of gravity, <b>bending</b> moment, bearing <b>clearance,</b> and input torque. Influences {{of each of}} these parameters and their combined effects on the resulting planet load sharing are investigated. Bending moments and gravity induce fundamental excitations in the rotating carrier frame, which can increase gearbox internal loads and disturb load sharing. Clearance in carrier bearings reduces the bearing load carrying capacity and thus the bending moment from the rotor can be transmitted into gear meshes. With bearing <b>clearance,</b> the <b>bending</b> moment can cause tooth micropitting and can induce planet bearing fatigue, leading to reduced gearbox life. Planet bearings are susceptible to skidding at low input torque...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Tube bending is {{a complex}} process with multi-factor {{coupling}} effect and multiple defects occurring. The wall thinning, {{as one of the}} important defects in tube bending, determines the bending quality. In this study, taking thin-walled 6061 -T 4 Al-alloy tube with Φ 50. 8 ×t 0. 889 ×R 101. 6 mm (outer diameter D × wall thickness t × bending radius R) as the objective, the significance of processing parameters on the wall thinning degree is studied using the orthogonal test under ABAQUS/Explicit platform. The results show that: 1) the <b>bending</b> radius, the <b>clearance</b> between the tube and the pressure die, the friction between the tube and the pressure die, the clearance between the tube and the pressure die, the clearance between the tube and the mandrel and the friction between the tube and the mandrel affect the wall thinning significantly, while the coefficient of boost velocity, the number of mandrel balls, the friction between the tube and the wiper die, the mandrel extension length and the friction between the tube and the bending die have little effect on the wall thinning degree...|$|R
