Repsol at the time said the area could ultimately produce 100,000 <b>barrels</b> <b>of</b> <b>oil</b> <b>a</b> <b>day,</b> which would meet 10 percent of Spain's energy needs. However, the analysis of samples obtained did not show the necessary volume nor quality to consider future extraction, and the project was scrapped.|$|E

2500|$|Up {{until the}} early 1950s, coal had been the {{commodity}} mined in the area. [...] In the late 40's, a blizzard in the Alberta foothills pushed the seismic operations eastward to Stettler. The move resulted in the discovery of oil near Big Valley. [...] But more importantly, it spawned extensive {{oil and gas exploration}} throughout the county. [...] That exploration resulted in the Big Valley No. 7 discovery well the following year, located [...] south of Big Valley, Alberta. [...] This well was completed in September 1950. [...] Once developed, the Fenn-Big Valley field covered an area of 78.2 hectares (30.2 square miles). [...] This field produced over 51 million cubic metres (321 million barrels) of oil and over 2.4 billion cubic metres (85 billion cubic feet) of solution gas. [...] Small amounts of oil and gas remain to be produced from this field. [...] The oil and gas formation lies 1660 metres (5,445ft) {{below the surface of the}} ground. [...] At its peak, the Fenn-Big Valley Field produced 5,352 cubic metres (35,000 <b>barrels)</b> <b>of</b> <b>oil</b> <b>a</b> <b>day</b> for Gulf and similar amounts for Shell and Esso. [...] The original portion of No. 7 well alone produced 95,700 cubic metres (626,000 barrels) of oil during its lifetime.
