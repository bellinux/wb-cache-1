5|$|The episode {{begins at}} a funeral, {{attended}} by Guy, Caroline, Boyce (Oliver Chris), Martin Dear (Karl Theobald) and Sue White (Michelle Gomez). References {{made in the}} episode lead the viewer to first {{believe that it is}} Mac's funeral, <b>but</b> <b>then</b> <b>a</b> giant picture of Angela Hunter (Sarah Alexander), who left the hospital in series two, appears. The cause of her death is not fully explained, although comments made by the characters indicate she died in a hunting accident with a moose. The plot then splits between three groups of characters.|$|E

Octavia Hill was {{impressed}} and moved by Henry Mayhew's London Labour and the London Poor, a book that portrayed {{the daily lives of}} slum dwellers. She was also strongly influenced by the theologian, Anglican priest and social reformer F. D. Maurice, who was a family friend. She began her work on behalf of London's poor by helping to make toys for Ragged school children, and serving as secretary of the women's classes at the Working Men's College in Bloomsbury in central London.|$|E

5|$|Across the Way is a 1915 American silent {{short film}} {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company under the Princess brand. The comedy-drama involves a man named Sparks playing a trick on his friend to make him question his sanity. The trick involves the friend's love interest being attacked by an assailant which works, <b>but</b> <b>then</b> <b>a</b> burglar attacks her a few days later. The friend saves his love interest from the burglar and later marries him instead of Sparks. The Princess comedy-dramas were not well-received {{and it was not}} long after the film's release that Edwin Thanhouser took a personal interest in the productions at the New Rochelle studio. Soon thereafter, the Princess brand was discontinued and replaced by the Falstaff brand. The film is presumed to be lost.|$|E
5|$|The {{fourth quarter}} began with Virginia Tech in {{possession}} of the ball and facing a first down at their 35-yard line. The first play of the quarter resulted in a 20-yard gain by Evans on a running play. After that, however, the Hokies did not gain another first down and punted to Cincinnati. Following the kick, the Bearcats started their first possession of the fourth quarter at their 14-yard line. Running back Isaiah Pead ran for three yards, <b>but</b> <b>then</b> <b>a</b> pass by Pike was intercepted at the 10-yard line by Tech defender Orion Martin. Three rushing plays later, Evans ran six yards for a touchdown. The extra point kick was good, and with 11:29 remaining in the game, Virginia Tech took a 20â€“7 lead.|$|E
5|$|After {{fighting}} his {{way back}} to the top of the temple, Ryu encounters Bloody Malth, whom Ryu defeats. While dying, Malth reveals that he was the one who dueled with Ryu's father, that his father is still alive and that Ryu will meet him as he presses onward. When he reaches the temple's inner chambers, he discovers that his father was not killed but was instead possessed by an evil figure. He destroys the evil figure, which releases Ken from its hold. Jaquio, enraged from Ken's release from the possession, shows himself; he immediately tries to kill Ryu with a fiery projectile, but Ken throws himself in front of Ryu and takes the hit. Jaquio is killed during the ensuing fight by Ryu, <b>but</b> <b>then</b> <b>a</b> lunar eclipse occurs, causing the demon statues to transform into Jashin. After Ryu defeats the demon, Ken tells him he does not have much longer to live due to Jaquio's attack. He tells Ryu to leave him behind in the temple while it collapses and to take the young woman with him. Afterwards, Foster, communicating via satellite, orders the girl to kill Ryu and steal the demon statues; she chooses to be with Ryu instead of carrying out the order. The two kiss, and the girl tells Ryu her name, Irene Lew; the two watch as the sun rises.|$|E

5|$|The tournament {{began on}} 30 July at Headingley in Leeds, where the Loughborough Lightning faced the Yorkshire Diamonds. The Lightning batted first and scored 128 for nine, led by 52 runs from their New Zealand international, Sophie Devine. The Diamonds began their {{response}} well, and their captain, Lauren Winfield scored 23 runs from just 13 balls {{before she was}} run out. There was some controversy regarding the dismissal; Winfield felt {{that she had been}} impeded by the bowler, but the umpires upheld the dismissal. Regular wickets and miserly bowling from the Lightning attack restricted Yorkshire's batsmen, and they were eventually all out for 85, giving the Lightning a 43-run victory. The following day saw two low-scoring matches; the Surrey Stars were restricted to 85 runs from their 20 overs by a economic Southern Vipers bowling attack. Nat Sciver managed to score 36 runs for the Stars late in the innings, but the Vipers scored 66 runs from their opening partnership, including 41 runs from 43 balls for Georgia Adams to help them towards their target. They won with six wickets and 28 balls to spare. In the other fixture that day, the Lancashire Thunder reached 65 for four, <b>but</b> <b>then</b> <b>a</b> spell of bowling from Heather Knight and Stafanie Taylor for the Western Storm saw the Thunder dismissed all out for 83 runs. Taylor finished with four wickets, while Knight took three. In their batting response, Knight and Taylor were again the best performers; Knight scored 23 and Taylor 14 as the Storm chased down the total with 27 balls remaining.|$|E

25|$|Denmark were in {{difficulties}} at 62/4 {{early on}} against the Dutch, with Elferink claiming 3-28, <b>but</b> <b>then</b> <b>a</b> stand of 99 between J Morild (who was eventually run out for 86) and Henriksen (42) righted {{the ship and}} guided the Danes to 224/8. The Netherlands also had their own problems and were 96/4 at one stage, but their scorecard was dominated by Gomes. He made 127 not out, 56.4% of his team's total, as they overhauled their target with five wickets and 5.4 overs still remaining.|$|E

25|$|Argentina {{surprisingly}} reduced Zimbabwe to 98/5, <b>but</b> <b>then</b> <b>a</b> {{stand of}} 174 between Rawson (125) and Gary Wallace (77) saw the Africans {{through to a}} daunting 357/7. Argentina were never likely to threaten such a target, and so it proved as they were bowled out for 150 to lose by a massive 207 runs. In the other Group A game, Jahangir Shah took 4-37 for Bangladesh but could not stop Malaysia making 239 (Asgari Stevens 68, Yazid Imran 64); DP John took 5-40 as the Bangladeshis slid to a 57-run defeat despite Rafiqul Alam's 51.|$|E
25|$|De Leyva, who {{had been}} seriously injured by a capstan, pitched camp {{on the shore of}} the bay for nine days, until news came of another ship of the fleet, the galleass Girona, which had {{anchored}} in Killybegs harbour while two other ships had been lost on attempting to enter the harbour. With the assistance of an Irish chieftain, MacSweeney Bannagh, Girona was repaired and set sail in mid-October with 1,300 men on board, including de Leyva. Lough Foyle was cleared, <b>but</b> <b>then</b> <b>a</b> gale struck and Girona was driven ashore at Dunluce in modern County Antrim. There were nine survivors, who were sent on to Scotland by Sorley Boy MacDonnell; 260 bodies were washed ashore.|$|E
25|$|Centuries by Barrington (his first Test hundred) and Dexter {{ensured that}} England {{made a big}} score. Alexander took five catches. In response, West Indies were 102/3, <b>but</b> <b>then</b> <b>a</b> mammoth fourth wicket {{partnership}} of 399 (still the record for that wicket for West Indies against all countries) by Sobers and Worrell took them into a first innings lead. In the circumstances, Trueman's analysis was a good one. West Indies had scored at under {{two and a half}} runs per over, and by the time that they declared England only had to bat for 140 minutes in their second innings. Allen for England, and Scarlett and Watson for West Indies, made their Test debuts. Statham was unfit, Moss playing in his stead.|$|E

25|$|Histon School {{was started}} in 1722; in 1729 it gained funding from the {{foundation}} of Elizabeth March - a board {{over one of the}} doors to Histon church records this bequest. Histonâ€™s share of this income was Â£14 a year. Until 1840 the school was held in the parish church, <b>but</b> <b>then</b> <b>a</b> purpose-built school was erected to hold up to 70 children in what is now called School Hill. In 1872 the school was enlarged; it was then held up as a model school for the whole county. On being taken over by the school board in 1893 it was enlarged still further {{with the addition of a}} new south wing, built over the Histon brook. In 1913 the school moved to its current site and the building was then handed back to the church and is now the church hall.|$|E
25|$|USS Saginawâ€Š's {{crew was}} just putting the anchor {{down when the}} first shot burst in the water next to the ship. Surprised, the Americans first raised a white flag to show their {{friendly}} intentions <b>but</b> <b>then</b> <b>a</b> second shot was fired along with a third. Trying to get up steam, the Saginaw turned around and withdrew slowly to 900 yards, by which time her crew were at station and ready for action. The American gunners returned fire with one of their 32-pounders and after only about twenty minutes the Vietnamese guns were silenced. A secondary explosion was observed and it was suspected that either the powder magazine of the fort, {{or one of the}} guns, blew up and killed their operators. After the explosion no further shots were fired from the fort. However, the Saginawâ€Š's gunners continued their bombardment for another half-hour unopposed until the fort was in ruins. American forces suffered no damage or casualties and after the action, communicating with the natives proved fruitless so the Saginaw steamed back to Hong Kong.|$|E
25|$|<b>But</b> <b>then</b> <b>a</b> mysterious {{person in}} a Krabby Patty-costume defeats {{all four of the}} {{restaurant}} managers, saves SpongeBob and takes him back to the Krusty Krab. It turns out that the Krusty Krab has gone downhill ever since Mr. Krabs fired SpongeBob and took over as the fry cook. Squidward reveals himself as the person in the costume, and explains that as much as he hates SpongeBob (which SpongeBob himself acknowledges), he hates the smell of burning Krabby Patties even more, and both he and Mr. Krabs ask SpongeBob to be the fry cook again, with Mr. Krabs admitting that he made a huge mistake in firing SpongeBob in the first place. SpongeBob gladly accepts his old job as the fry cook, and puts the restaurant back on track, which brings back all the customers, even the four restaurant managers who fought over SpongeBob. At the end of the episode, Mr. Krabs reveals that he has installed a pay toilet that costs a nickel to use, thus making up the nickel that he previously lost by hiring SpongeBob.|$|E
50|$|There are {{combinations}} {{of glass and}} iron-nickel-cobalt alloys (Kovar) where even the non-linearity of the thermal expansion is matched. These alloys can be directly sealed to glass, <b>but</b> <b>then</b> the oxidation is critical. Also, their low electrical conductivity is a disadvantage. Thus, they are often gold plated. It is also possible to use silver plating, <b>but</b> <b>then</b> <b>an</b> additional gold layer is necessary as an oxygen diffusion barrier to prevent the formation of iron oxide.|$|R

Three of LuxiÈ›a's brothersâ€”Iancu, Dumitrache, and Costache Florescuâ€”participated in the events, and {{played a part in}} the shootout with the loyalist Colonel Grigore LÄƒcusteanu, whom they eventually arrested. Unusually, Costache Florescu's daughter married LÄƒcusteanu's brother Iancu while the colonel was still in captivity. All three brothers were repressed during the foreign intervention: Iancu Florescu was arrested by the Russians and spent some eight years in Siberia, returning after the Crimean War removed Wallachia from the Russian sphere of influence; Costache and Dumitrache were taken into Ottoman custody, returning after nine years of exile in Bursa. While Iancu took up law practice, Dumitrache is best known for setting to music the poetry of Vasile Alecsandri.|$|E

In the Super Sixes, Klusener failed with the bat {{for the first time}} in the Cup, scoring only 4 against New Zealand, but he still took 2/46 with the ball. He scored 46* and took 1/41 against Pakistan and scored 36 and 1/53 against Australia in another losing cause. In the World Cup semi-final, Klusener came in when the score was 6/175, with the South Africans required 39 in 5 overs to win. Klusener scored 31 off just 16 balls and brought South Africa to the level of a tie, <b>but</b> <b>then</b> <b>a</b> run out with Allan Donald resulted in the match remaining tied and Australia passed through to the final per past results with Klusener remaining stranded not out.|$|E
