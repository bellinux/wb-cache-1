500|$|Chaney {{wrote that}} the mash-up of [...] "Fly" [...] and [...] "I <b>Believe</b> <b>I</b> <b>Can</b> Fly" [...] was [...] "an {{unexpectedly}} lovely mix" [...] {{and gave it a}} [...] "B+". Futterman said it [...] "seamlessly" [...] wove the two [...] "into an uplifting and thematically appropriate mash-up", and credited Santana and Blaine with [...] "an impressive job on Minaj's rap verses, while Rachel, Artie and Mercedes split tastefully understated solos". Slezak credited [...] "solid vocals from Artie, Finn, Rachel, and Mercedes, and some not terrible rapping from Blaine and Santana", but he thought the number [...] "lacked the epic scope you want from a Regionals showdown" [...] and disliked the song [...] "I <b>Believe</b> <b>I</b> <b>Can</b> Fly"; his grade was a [...] Votta characterized the mashup as [...] "just off" [...] and [...] "better visually than it is just to listen to the track". Lynch said Santana had [...] "attitude to spare" [...] in her rap and New Directions [...] "harmonized wonderfully on this very re-listenable mash-up", and gave it a [...] "B+" [...] grade.|$|E

His beliefs matter to him {{both on and off}} the track: [...] "I'm a religious man, so I really believe in my God-given ability, that I can do the unexpected. I really do <b>believe</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> break a record, or come close to it, or win a medal." [...] He is frequently described as a modest and respectful athlete.|$|E

500|$|The only {{song that}} was given a {{strongly}} enthusiastic reception was [...] "Cough Syrup", which was sung by Blaine (Darren Criss) and used to soundtrack the Karofsky suicide sequence. The other songs, all performances for the Regionals competition, received a mixture of reviews. Five of the six singles released from this episode charted on both the Billboard Hot 100 and the Billboard Canadian Hot 100; the mash-up of [...] "Fly" [...] and [...] "I <b>Believe</b> <b>I</b> <b>Can</b> Fly" [...] performed by New Directions charted {{the highest in the}} US, while [...] "What Doesn't Kill You (Stronger)" [...] performed by the Troubletones as part of the New Directions set charted the best of the five in Canada.|$|E
500|$|Regionals {{opens with}} the Warblers {{performing}} two songs, [...] "Stand" [...] and [...] "Glad You Came", {{and the second}} group, the Golden Goblets, are strong performers as well. In the choir room, before New Directions goes on, Finn announces that he and Rachel are getting married afterward, and tells the group to live each day {{as if it is}} their last. New Directions opens their set with a mash-up of [...] "Fly" [...] and [...] "I <b>Believe</b> <b>I</b> <b>Can</b> Fly", which is followed by a Troubletones performance of [...] "What Doesn't Kill You (Stronger)". Rachel ends the set by performing [...] "Here's to Us", and New Directions wins the competition, with the Warblers finishing second.|$|E

[...] "Blood on the Dance Floor" [...] peaked at {{number one in the}} UK, Spain and New Zealand, {{charting}} for 11 weeks in the latter two nations. In the UK it sold 85,000 copies in its first week, enough to take the number one spot from [...] "I <b>Believe</b> <b>I</b> <b>Can</b> Fly" [...] by friend and collaborator R. Kelly. The song was Jackson's seventh UK chart topper as a solo artist, although it fell to number eight in its second week of release.

500|$|In 1981 Daniel Dennett had {{formulated}} another {{argument against}} the LOT. Dennett suggested that it would seem, {{on the basis of}} the evidence of our behavior toward computers but also with regard to some of our own unconscious behavior, that explicit representation is not necessary for the explanation of propositional attitudes. During a game of chess with a computer program, we often attribute such attitudes to the computer, saying such things as [...] "It thinks that the queen should be moved to the left." [...] We attribute propositional attitudes to the computer and this helps us to explain and predict its behavior in various contexts. Yet no one would suggest that the computer is actually thinking or believing somewhere inside its circuits the equivalent of the propositional attitude [...] "I <b>believe</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> kick this guy's butt" [...] in Mentalese. The same is obviously true, suggests Dennett, of many of our everyday automatic behaviors such as [...] "desiring to breathe clear air" [...] in a stuffy environment.|$|E

[...] Chicago Tribune rock music critics Greg Kot believed that R. Kelly [...] "reprises the formula of his big gospel-stoked anthem" [...] ("I <b>Believe</b> <b>I</b> <b>Can</b> Fly") on the track. A journalist for The Wichita Eagle wrote that Jackson [...] "shines on the sincere ballads" [...] such as [...] "Cry", [...] "Heartbreaker" [...] and [...] "Speechless". Pop music critic Thor Christensen of the Dallas Morning News described the single as being the musician's [...] "latest batch of inspirational cotton candy." [...] Francisco Cangiano of University Wire noted that the overall good songs from Invincible are [...] "Heartbreaker," [...] "Cry" [...] and [...] "Speechless." [...] Pamela Davis and Gina Vininetto of St. Petersburg Times called the song [...] "hubris- filled" [...] and {{said that it was}} full of Jackson's [...] "freaky messiah-savior complex." ...|$|E

Gerry Mallon, then-chair {{of the university}} ruling council, expected Nesbitt to [...] "bring considerable energy, dynamism and commitment" [...] to the post. Following his official installation on 8 June 2010, Nesbitt said, [...] "Rather than being just an informal role officiating at ceremonies, I think I can act as an ambassador. I have access to {{an awful lot of}} people and places because of my work. I hope to be a voice that can be heard, not just at the university, but also outside promoting the importance of the funding of education. If that involves me being at Stormont, then I'd be very happy to do that. Clearly these public spending cuts are going to have an impact and it's important to fight for funding because it's about investing in students and investing in the future of Northern Ireland. I <b>believe</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> bring something to that, otherwise I wouldn't have taken this on." ...|$|E
500|$|Ryan {{signed a}} five-album record deal with SYCOmusic {{as part of}} Columbia Records on September 18, 2006. She was the first U.S. artist to sign with SYCOmusic; during the press conference, Simon Cowell called Ryan [...] "potentially {{one of the best}} singers I have ever heard in my life."

Eight days later, the album debuted at No. 57 on the Billboard album charts, showcasing [...] "her gargantuan chops and sweet charm". Matt Collar of AllMusic added that the arrangements were [...] "grandiose" [...] for someone of Ryan's age, but they were [...] "more than matched by her truly impressive vocal talent." [...] Los Angeles Daily News reviewer Sandra Barrera wrote that Ryan handled the songs [...] "like the old pro that her big, powerful voice makes you think she is".|$|E
500|$|The episode {{features}} {{performances of}} cover versions of eight songs, and {{seven of them}} are being released as six singles, available for downloading, with the two-song mash-up released as one single.

If you were looking around for a high concept pitch-style descriptor, with its synth brass and Philly soul strings {{you might call it}} 'Stevie Wonder meets N.E.R.D in space'. But then that would be too simplistic a definition for the multifaceted, resolutely accomplished 'Sweet Thing'." [...] Pitchforks Larry Fitzmaurice labeled it a [...] "Best New Track" [...] and noted that [...] "this was a week where Frank Ocean bravely invited us to learn more about his personal story; 'Sweet Life' is another reminder of how well he can structure a narrative in the musical realm." [...] The Telegraphs Neil McCormick noted that Ocean took the R genre and pushed it out into strange new places, with tracks like the [...] "blissful, jazzy jigsaw of 'Sweet Life', which seems to assemble itself from disconnected elements as it goes along." [...] AllMusic's Andy Kellman mused that the track served as one of the album's lighter moments, and wrote that [...] "the bright 'Sweet Life' and the relatively exuberant 'Monks,' both of which would be standouts on any N.E.R.D. album, offer more than bright coating, dealing in surrealism and sharp observations that are equally penetrating." ...|$|E
