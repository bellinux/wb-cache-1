500|$|In September 2010, Waters {{commenced}} The Wall Live tour, {{an updated}} version of the original Pink Floyd shows, featuring a complete performance of The Wall. Waters told the Associated Press that The Wall Tour will likely be his last, stating: [...] "I'm not as young as I used to be. I'm not like B.B. King, or Muddy Waters. I'm not a great vocalist or a great instrumentalist or whatever, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> the fire in my belly, and I have something to say. I have a swan song in me and I think this will probably be it." [...] At The O2 Arena in London on 12 May 2011, Gilmour and Mason once again appeared with Waters and Gilmour performing [...] "Comfortably Numb", and Gilmour and Mason joining Waters for [...] "Outside the Wall". For the first half of 2012, Waters' tour topped worldwide concert ticket sales having sold more than 1.4 million tickets globally. As of 2013, The Wall Live is the highest-grossing tour of all time by a solo artist. Waters performed at [...] at Madison Square Garden on 12 December 2012. On 24 July 2015, Waters headlined the Newport Folk Festival in Newport, Rhode Island. Waters was accompanied by the band My Morning Jacket and two singers from the group Lucius.|$|E
2500|$|The New York Post’s {{widely read}} Page Six gossip column {{claimed that he}} was {{converted}} to Catholicism by Father C. John McCloskey, a leader of Opus Dei, “the secretive sect which drew so much attention with The Da Vinci Code.” Actually, McCloskey {{was one of the}} two priests—the other was Vaghi—from whom Novak received instruction in the Catholic faith. Andrew Sullivan claimed that Novak was a member of Opus Dei. John L. Allen Jr., however, in his authoritative study, Opus Dei, wrote that Novak was not a member. Novak felt that his new faith did not influence his personal behavior or his political views, saying, “I’m a Christian now, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> some bad traits.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Connolly and {{his older}} sister, Florence (named for their {{maternal}} grandmother, and eighteen months his senior), were cared for by two aunts, Margaret and Mona Connolly, his father's sisters, in their cramped tenement in Stewartville Street, Partick. [...] "My aunts constantly told me I was stupid, which still affects me today pretty badly. It’s just a belief that I’m not quite as good as anyone else. It gets worse as you get older. I’m a happy man now <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> the scars of that." [...] Regarding his sister, Connolly has called her his [...] "great defender". [...] "To this day, he explained in 2009, [...] "Guys say, 'God, your sister... We didn't dare beat you up – your sister was a nightmare'. She used to get after them." [...] In the mid-1960s, Flo was on holiday in Dunoon {{with her husband and}} two children. [...] "My mother said, 'I saw Florence walking along, and I followed her.'" [...] "I said, 'Did you speak to her?' 'Oh, no, I didn't,' she said. I thought, 'Oh, my god. It's like being a ghost while you're still alive.' Walking behind your own child. Having a look. I couldn't bear that." ...|$|E

In 2012 he wrote of his adolescence: [...] "I was a miserable teenager. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>had</b> something to live for. I had feminism, Dungeons & Dragons and the Ramones. Not necessarily in that order." [...] He described his mother Paddy as a feminist, art teacher and [...] "a staunch unionist".|$|R

5000|$|... "I {{was pretty}} {{overbearing}} to deal with," [...] Rundgren recalled in the liner notes to the 1999 CD release. [...] "I was also becoming very particular about arrangements, so I took {{a crack at}} playing it all myself. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>had</b> some dependence on other musicians.

If {{you look at the}} dollar amount, my own income as a freelance writer probably wasn’t much higher than some of my interviewees, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>had</b> resources like educational credentials and social capital which many of them lacked. One of the reasons that graduation rates among low-income first generation college students hover at around 10 % is that they don’t have the “college knowledge” taken for granted by their peers.|$|R

I must know when Cornhill must see it. I can send some of it in a week easily, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> to read The Laughing Man,[13] and I mean to wait until I get to London and have the loan of that from you.

[...] "You are kind to me, God bless your sweet face! Though I scold, {{and have a}} frightful temper, my {{servants}} {{will do anything to}} make me comfortable, and get up at any hour of the night, and never say a cross word in answer. I like my cards still. Indeed, life would be a blank without 'em. Almost everything is gone except that. I can't eat my dinner now, since I lost those last two teeth.

I shall hear of it only as so many a woman banished out of England hears a distant misunderstood report {{of what is going}} on in the country she has left. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> regard enough,--I will be bold, and, knowing that you will not take it amiss, will say love enough for you,--to feel a desire that you should not be shipwrecked. Since we first took you in hand between us, Barrington and I, I have never swerved in my anxiety on your behalf. When I resolved that it would be better for us both that we should be only friends, I did not swerve. When you would talk to me so cruelly of your love for Violet, I did not swerve. When I warned you from Loughlinter because I thought there was danger, I did not swerve. When I bade you not to come to me in London because of my husband, I did not swerve. When my father was hard upon you, I did not swerve then. I would not leave him till he was softened. When you tried to rob Oswald of his love, and I thought you would succeed,--for I did think so,--I did not swerve. I have ever been true to you. And now that I must hide myself and go away, and be seen no more, I am true still." ...|$|E

I did not think a guide necessary, but a boy took me up by a track near Gadmen, and left me to my Siegfried map some way up the great ridge of rocks that overlooks the Engstlen Alp. I a little overestimated my mountaineering, and it came about that I was benighted while <b>I</b> was <b>still</b> high above the Joch Pass on my descent. Some of this was steep and needed caution. I had to come down slowly with my folding lantern, in which a reluctant candle went out at regular intervals, and I did not reach the little inn at Engstlen Alp until long after eleven at night. By that time I was very tired and hungry.|$|R
