The presence of individual variations in the behaviour of individuals within a population is an important factor favouring the outcome of a new invasion (Wolf and Weissing [2012]), and provides a basis to predict potential invasiveness (Carere and Gherardi [2013]). The plasticity in the behaviour of P. marinus can be considered as a major factor, enhancing its capacity of colonising new environments.|$|R

40|$|Phytoplankton {{distribution}} and periodicity patterns were investigated {{in a series}} of four intermittently linked ponds during the period January 1984 to December 1987. The ponds, each with an area of less than one hectare, are located within the boundaries of Windsor Great Park, Berkshire. During the middle two of the four field seasons studied the ponds were subjected to mechanical disturbances which involved the dredging and enlargement of all basins. Inverted microscope counts of the algae in sedimented water samples indicated a phytoplankton succession characteristic of eutrophic bodies of water. The vernal increase was consistently dominated by the Bacillariophyceae mainly Asterionella formosa and Stephanodiscus ref hantzschii. Asterionella formosa is normally associated with larger more open water areas and may have been living at the limit of its ecological range. Diatoms were succeeded largely by species from the Chlorophyceae, Cryptophyceae and Euglenophyceae. Cyanobacteria were conspicuous only occasionally during the summer months. Changes in phytoplankton {{distribution and}} composition were observed following dredging operations, these changes suggested a reversion to less eutrophic conditions in ponds one, two and three; this was not apparent in pond four. Additionally, Stephanodiscus ref hantzschii was succeeded by Asterionella formosa as the dominant diatom during spring growth, a factor possibly associated with basin enlargement. Flagellates rather than other species were more apparent in the turbid conditions which obtained after dredging.

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{has been carried}} out on the algal flora of slow sand filter beds. Ecological field studies were made from August 1963 until December 1965 and experimental work was continued until June 1966. The filter beds studied were located at the Ashford Common works of the Metropolitan Water Board, London. The major chemical nutrients, and pH were determined throughout the period together with temperature and penetration of light into the water. Biomass, interpreted from calculated cell volumes, of the major species of algae encountered was used to express the results of cell concentrations. The periodicity end distribution of the algae in the filter beds was investigated. The algal populations present were sub-divided into planktonic, epipelic and attached <b>bottom</b> <b>living</b> species and each one was found to have a distinct seasonal periodicity. Observations suggested that the filter bed algal populations were not often limited by nutrient concentrations but the algae on the sand surface may on several occasions have been limited by low light levels. Experiments to determine the toxicity of copper sulphate to certain species of algae were carried out. The ability of algae to penetrate the sand and to survive was also investigated experimentally. These experiments showed that cells could stay alive in the filter bed sand after cleaning and act as population innocula when the bed was refilled. The flora of the sand surface was compared with that of an in-situ polythene bag to ascertain the effects of nutrient limitation.

40|$|During {{the spring}} 1988, spraint samples were {{collected}} {{on the banks of}} 3 watercourses (one river and two canals) crossing the Marais Poitevin. Their general characteristics (flow rate, conductivity, hydrographic regime) are quite different. The fish community of the two canals was sampled by electrofishing and we estimated the relative abundance of the different fish species. After a check of the reliability of our spraint analysis technique (feeding trials with captive otters), we made an estimate of the relative abundance of the prey items in the otters diet and an assessment of the length and of the weight of each individual fish preyed upon. They are indeed very strong length-weight correlations in fish and also close relationships between the length of some skull bones and the total length od a fish. The diet is mostly made up by the eel. It comprises also a great variety of other fish species, nearly all that were observend in the habitat. Much frogs, some snakes, birds, mammals, insects and crustaceans were also discovered. They are only slight diet differences between the main watercourses which probably are related to the characteristics of their fish fauna (e. g. much more sticklebacks when waters are becoming brackish; big amount of Atherina in salt marshes). No marked variations were found during a normal summer but fish is obviously less eaten during a severe drought. Comparing the frequency-distributions of fish in the diet and in the habitat, we found no selective predation in respect with fish (eel, cyprinids) size. From that point of view, the otter display a generalistic-opportunistic pattern of foraging. As far as the relative abundance of the various species is considered, otters take much less roaches and much more eels and tenches than present in the habitat. It {{remains to be seen if}} that is the consequence of a 'deliberate choice' or of a peculiar way of underwater huntig.

40|$|The {{study of}} larvae, their {{behaviour}} & physiology has gathered momentum {{in recent years}} due {{to the development of}} improved techniques of rearing during the past decade. Many marine larvae have been successfully reared in the laboratory (Shelbourne, 1964; Schumann, 1967; Blaxter, 1968, 1969; Houde & Palko, 1970; Futch & Detwyler, 1970; Lasker, Feder, Theilacker & May, 1970). Fish larvae, in particular those of most marine species form an important tool for research in that at hatching they only possess the rudiments of most organs. Thus they are ideal material for ontogenetical studies. Although the respiratory mechanisms of adult fish {{have been the subject of}} a great deal of investigation from the point of view of gas exchange (see Randall 1970) gill structure (Hughes, 1966; Hughes & Grimstone, 1965; Newstead, 1967; to name a few) and dimensions (see Muir, 1969) gill ventilation and perfusion (see Shelton, 1970) circulatory systems (see Randall, 1970) bioenergetics, (see Brett, 1970) the respiratory systems of larvae have not been investigated in any great detail. Apart from a few studies on oxygen uptake (see Blaxter, 1969) and Harder (1954) on the development of branchial elements, no detailed study of the development of respiratory mechanisms have been made in marine fish larvae. The purpose of this study was to investigate the development of respiration in two species of marine larvae viz. the herring (Clupea harengus L.) and the plaice (Pleuronectes plates sa L.) These two species are well separated taxonomically and both adults and young have very different life histories. Herring lay demersal eggs, the plaice pelagic ones. The yolk-sac larvae of both species are planktonic, later feeding on diatoms and copepod nauplii and much later copepods. Adult herring are pelagic, living in mid water as juveniles and moving into deeper water with age, ranging from offshore to about 200 m. They perform migrations partly caused by the distribution and density of food organisms. In contrast to this plaice at metamorphosis show an interesting asymmetry in that one eye migrates over the head and comes to lie against its opposite number. At this stage pelagic life ceases and the young fish assumes a bottom-living existence. Other features associated with asymmetry are secondary to the migration of the eye and follow on from the adoption of the benthic mode of life. They range from the shoreline when young to lOOOm feeding on <b>bottom</b> <b>living</b> organisms. During development the mechanism of respiration changes from a cutaneous one to gill respiration typical of the adult form. There is apparently no respiratory pigment in the early stages but the blood becomes pink at metamorphosis. The problem was approached from a morphological and a physiological viewpoint. The main parts of the study are as follows. (1) The survival times in water of low oxygen concentrations. (2) The oxygen uptake at normal oxygen concentrations. (3) The oxygen uptake at low oxygen concentrations. (4) Measurement of the body surface area as well as the gill area available for respiration.

40|$|Manganese, Mn, is an {{abundant}} element in nature, particularly in soft bottom sediments {{of the oceans}} and in bedrock. The metal is predominantly bound to the sediment in the colloid state, MnO 2. Eutrophication caused by the high nutrient load in coastal waters together with over-fishing cause cascade effects in the ecosystem increasing the algal blooms and enhancement of hypoxic condition over large bottom areas. During hypoxic events MnO 2 is reduced and released into the bottom water as bioavailable ions, Mn 2 +. Mn is essential for several metabolic and enzymatic processes and is necessary for both animals and plants. Elevated levels though, are toxic and severe effects on the nervous system have been known for long. In addition, previous studies have shown an impaired immune system of the <b>bottom</b> <b>living</b> lobster, Nephrops norvegicus, when exposed to concentrations that are realistic to find in nature. In this study I aimed to investigate if immunotoxic effects of manganese are general also for other marine invertebrates. It is widely accepted that invertebrates {{do not have a}} documented so called adaptive immune response. They lack the genes, proteins and cells for the highly specific recognition and the long-term memory as found in vertebrates. Invertebrates primarily rely on the innate immune system to effectively combat a wide array of microbial pathogens. The innate immune system comprises of a first line of defence systems such as coagulation and melanization reactions, often followed by cellular reactions such as phagocytosis, encapsulation and production of antimicrobial substances. Many innate immune reactions are highly evolutionary conserved and are found throughout the whole animal kingdom. In aquatic invertebrates the open coelom or semi-open haemal circulatory system continuously expose them to potential pathogens and their immune response has proved to be exceptionally efficient in pathogen elimination as witnesses by the invertebrates’ evolutionary success. In this thesis species from three different phyla within the Bilaterians were investigated; the Norway lobster, Nephrops norvegicus (Crustacea), the blue mussel Mytilus edulis (Mollusca) and the common sea star, Asterias rubens (Echinodermata), differing in preferred habitats, feeding behaviour and somewhat in their strategies of immune defence. Studies were made on molecular, cellular and organism levels. On molecular and cellular levels we investigated the effects of manganese on the renewal of haemocytes (proliferation and differentiation of new cells), manganese effects on viability of haemocytes and the stress responses measured in both haemocytes and haematopoietic tissue. On the whole organism we investigated the effect of manganese on the ability for the animals to clear their cavity form injected bacteria. The results of this thesis show that Mn in concentrations found in bottom waters affects the immune system of marine invertebrates differently. In N. norvegicus the metal severely suppresses the number of circulating haemocytes by inducing apoptosis, programmed cell death. The impaired immunity made them more susceptible to infections, which was also found in M. edulis. In A. rubens the same Mn concentration seemed to have a stimulating effect (hormesis) on the haematopoiesis which increased the number of circulating haemocytes. Although manganese was shown stressful to the haemocytes and affected their ability to phagocyte, the increased number of haemocytes compensates these impairments. There was seemingly a negative correlation between the accumulation of the metal in the tissues of the animals and their ability to eliminate bacteria. Although Mn does not cause chronic effects on immunity, the expanding areas with bioavailable Mn might have an impact on species composition since some invertebrates become more susceptible to infections...|$|E
40|$|The {{rockfishes}} and scorpionfishes (family Scorpaenidae) {{form one}} of the most important fish families in the ocean waters of California. At present, in California waters, this family is represented by 49 species in the genus Sebastodes, two in the genus Sebastolobus, and one in the genus Scorpaena. Not only does this family contain more species than any other marine or freshwater fish family known to inhabit our waters, but most of the species are highly desirable for food. Only a few are too small to be of direct value for human consumption. Even these, however, are utilized as food by other fishes, often by larger species of rockfishes. The pygmy rockfish for example, which barely reaches a size of eight inches, has been taken only from the stomachs of other rockfish. Various rockfishes were of commercial importance in California as early as 1875 and, as a group, the rockfish have continually increased in importance not only in California but along the Pacific Coast, as well. The California catch, which in 1900 totaled between one and two million pounds, has in recent years risen to an average of between 12 and 13 million pounds annually. The importance of rockfish for human consumption during World War II is reflected in the peak Pacific Coast catch of 60 million pounds in 1945. For many years the majority of the catch was marketed fresh in the form of fillets. At present, only a small amount of the rockfish catch is marketed in a fresh dressed form, particularly in Southern California, but a sizable proportion is processed as frozen fillets. Preliminary tests on the frozen storage life of the fillets of a few important species indicate definite differences in keeping qualities. In this regard, it is hoped that this publication will be of particular value to both the fisherman and the processor in the proper identification of the numerous rockfish species. In the filleting process of rockfish, there is a loss of about two-thirds from the round weight. The carcasses that remain after filleting are either reduced to meal for livestock feeds or are mixed with scrap fish some of which consists of small unmarketable species of rockfish. This mixture is ground and frozen for use as mink food or as a supplement in the diet of hatchery-raised trout. During the past decade, sport fishing in the ocean waters of California has become increasingly important as a source of recreation for our growing population, and rockfish are now {{one of the}} most important components of the sport catch. Party boat records for all of California reveal that rockfish comprised 9 percent of the two and one-half million fish caught by anglers in 1947. By 1955, 55 percent of the three million fish caught by sport anglers consisted of rockfish. The adult forms of some rockfish are found only in relatively shallow water, often close to shore, but others are found only in deeper water and the adults of a few may occur in offshore water as deep as 3, 000 feet. Surveys being conducted by the California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigation show that the larvae of various species of rockfish occur in great abundance and are widely distributed along the coast, in some cases appearing as far as 300 miles offshore. They are abundant during most of the months of the year. Thus, during their pelagic existence and later as young and immature forms seeking an ultimate bottom habitat, these species are of considerable importance as food for pelagic, mid-water, and <b>bottom</b> <b>living</b> fishes. The young of various rockfish sometimes form a large and important part of the diet of such highly prized species as king salmon, albacore, and petrale sole. Most of the Pacific Coast scorpaenids were described prior to 1900 by a number of different workers. These men often based their descriptions on a single specimen, and occasionally a freak or variant would be described as new. Others of these early descriptions are inadequate for satisfactory identification of the fish at hand. As a result, the identity of a number of species of rockfish has been in doubt for many years. A number of recent workers have unraveled some of the nomenclatorial problems and reduced several species to synonymy, however, until now no major attempt has been made to redescribe the different species in the light of current knowledge. The present work presents uniform, concise descriptions of all the species comprising the family Scorpaenidae in California waters. Keys and photographs of all these species are presented to facilitate identification. Proper identification of the 52 kinds of rockfish, inhabiting our waters, will not only aid the industry by providing means of maintaining a uniformity in its products, but is logically the first step in helping to speed future research studies on this increasingly important group of fishes...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Cover and biomass {{estimates}} of the macroalgal assemblage on a coral reef off Waikīkī Beach, Hawai‘i were analyzed to determine changes through time. Biomass data spanned 39 years (1966 – 2005) while data for cover were taken from 1975 to 2005. Data for the 1975 – 2005 period were collected {{as part of a}} regularly scheduled class exercise. Mean biomass in 2005 was the same as in 1966, however during the 1980 's biomass was substantially lower. Much of this decline in total algal biomass was due to the low biomass of Sargassum spp. during those years. In the 1960 ’s total biomass was essentially constant from the shore to 200 m off shore, while in later years there was a decline in biomass with distance from shore. The invasive Rhodophyte, Gracilaria salicornia, was a major contributor to biomass starting in 1990. Even with this new dominant species, diversity, based on the 15 most common species, showed little change through time. Cover also remained consistent from 1975 to 2005 with macroalgae generally covering more than 50 % of the <b>bottom</b> and <b>living</b> coral less than 5 %. As with biomass, macroalgal cover declined with distance from shore. Student projects and class exercises can be used to generate valuable long-term data sets when appropriate quality control is maintained...|$|R
40|$|Dr. Charles M. Breder participated on the 1934 {{expedition}} of the Atlantis from Woods Hole, Massachusetts to Panama {{and back}} and kept a field diary of daily activities. The Atlantis expedition of 1934, led by Prof. A. E. Parr, was a milestone {{in the history of}} scientific discovery in the Sargasso Sea and the West Indies. Although naturalists had visited the Sargasso Sea for many years, the Atlantis voyage was the first attempt to investigate in detailed quantitative manner biological problems about this varying, intermittent ‘false’ <b>bottom</b> of <b>living,</b> floating plants and associated fauna. In addition to Dr. Breder, the party also consisted of Dr. Alexander Forbes, Harvard University and Trustee of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI); T. S. Greenwood, WHOI hydrographer; M. D. Burkenroad, Yale University’s Bingham Laboratory, carcinology and Sargasso epizoa; M. Bishop, Peabody Museum of Natural History, Zoology Dept., collections and preparations and H. Sears, WHOI ichthyologist. The itinerary included the following waypoints: Woods Hole, the Bermudas, Turks Islands, Kingston, Colon, along the Mosquito Bank off of Nicaragua, off the north coast of Jamaica, along the south coast of Cuba, Bartlett Deep, to off the Isle of Pines, through the Yucatan Channel, off Havana, off Key West, to Miami, to New York City, and then the return to Woods Hole. During the expedition, Breder collected rare and little-known flying fish species and developed a method for hatching and growing flying fish larvae. (PDF contains 48 pages...|$|R
