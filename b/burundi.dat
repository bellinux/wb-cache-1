5|$|<b>Burundi</b> {{participated in}} the 2008 Summer Olympics, held in Beijing, China from 8 to 24 August 2008. It was Burundi's fourth {{appearance}} in the summer Olympics since its debut in 1996. The <b>Burundi</b> team included three athletes: runners Joachim Nshimirimana and Francine Niyonizigiye, as well as swimmer Elsie Uwamahoro. Niyonizigiye, a marathon runner, was flag bearer for the opening ceremony. None of the <b>Burundi</b> athletes progressed further than the qualifying round.|$|E
5|$|In 1985, many {{countries}} had women's national football teams. While the sport grew in popularity worldwide {{in the ensuing}} years, <b>Burundi</b> {{did not have an}} official team until more than two decades later. By 2009, however, <b>Burundi</b> had a FIFA-recognised senior national team nicknamed the Swallows and a FIFA-recognised <b>Burundi</b> women's under-20 national team. The under-20 team played one international match in 2002, one in 2004 and one in 2006.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Burundi</b> women's {{national}} football team represents <b>Burundi</b> in women's inter{{national football}} competitions. The team, however, has not competed in a match recognised by FIFA, the sport's international governing body. A senior national team is inactive, but an under-20 team {{has played in}} numerous matches. Further development of football in the country faces challenges found across Africa, including inequality and limited access to education for women. A women's football programme {{did not exist in}} <b>Burundi</b> until 2000, and only 455 players had registered for participation on the national level by 2006.|$|E
25|$|The Transitional Senate has fifty-one members, {{and three}} seats are {{reserved}} for former presidents. Due to stipulations in <b>Burundi's</b> constitution, 30% of Senate members must be female. Members of the Senate are elected by electoral colleges, which consist of members from each of <b>Burundi's</b> provinces and communes. For each of <b>Burundi's</b> eighteen provinces, one Hutu and one Tutsi senator are chosen. One term for the Transitional Senate is five years.|$|R

5|$|<b>Burundi</b> {{had participated}} in three {{previous}} Summer Olympics, between its debut in the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, United States and the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. At its debut, the country sent seven athletes to the games, all of whom competed in athletics. The largest number of Burundian athletes participating in the summer games is seven in 1996 and 2004. The only Burundian competitor to win a medal at the Olympics was Vénuste Niyongabo, who won gold in the men's 5000 metres in 1996. Three athletes from <b>Burundi</b> were selected {{to compete in the}} 2008 Olympics: Joachim Nshimirimana in the men's marathon, Francine Niyonizigiye in the women's track and field 5000 metres and Elsie Uwamahoro in the women's 50 metre freestyle swimming.|$|E
5|$|The Fédération de Football du <b>Burundi,</b> the country's {{national}} association, {{created a}} woman's football programme in 2000. By 2006, {{there were just}} 455 registered women players, {{and the absence of}} a thriving women's game has been an obstacle for the national team.

5|$|The senior {{national}} football team has never competed in a FIFA-sanctioned fixture {{and has not}} competed at the Women's World Cup. The team was one of 200 preparing for a qualification tournament for the cup in 2007, but did not play in the competition. The team has withdrawn from numerous other events. <b>Burundi</b> was {{to play in the}} 2008 African Women's Championship but withdrew from the tournament, giving the Democratic Republic of the Congo an automatic qualification. The team also withdrew from the 2010 CAF Women's Championship and the 2012 CAF Women's Championship before the first-round qualifiers. <b>Burundi</b> has not participated in other major events on the continent, including the 2011 All-Africa Games.

50|$|On 18-19 October 1965, a {{group of}} ethnic Hutu {{officers}} from the Burundian military attempted to overthrow <b>Burundi's</b> government in a coup d'état. The rebels were angry about the apparent favouring of ethnic Tutsi minority by <b>Burundi's</b> monarchy {{after a period of}} escalating ethnic tension following national independence from Belgium in 1962. Although the Prime Minister was shot and wounded, the coup failed and soon provoked a backlash against Hutu in which thousands of people, including the participants in the coup, were killed. The coup also facilitated a militant Tutsi backlash against the moderate Tutsi monarchy resulting in two further coups which culminated in the abolition of <b>Burundi's</b> historic monarchy in November 1966 and the rise of Michel Micombero as dictator.|$|R

5|$|Lieutenant General Eugene Irwin (Robert Redford) {{is brought}} to a maximum {{security}} military prison to begin a ten-year sentence for his decision (in violation of a presidential order) to send U.S. troops on a mission in <b>Burundi,</b> resulting {{in the deaths of}} eight soldiers. Colonel Winter (James Gandolfini), the prison's commandant, is a great admirer of the general but is offended by a comment he overhears: Irwin criticizes Winter's much-prized military artifacts collection, calling it something no actual battlefield veteran would ever have.|$|E
5|$|Reports from <b>Burundi</b> and Angola warn of {{a threat}} to food {{security}} caused by the African Cassava Mosaic Virus (ACMD). ACMD is responsible for the loss of a million tons of cassava each year. CMD is prevalent in all the main cassava-growing areas in the Great Lakes region of east Africa, causing between 20 and 90 percent crop losses in the Congo. The FAO emergency relief and rehabilitation program is assisting vulnerable returnee populations in the African Great Lakes Region through mass propagation and distribution of CMD resistant or highly tolerant cassava.|$|E

50|$|Following the Second World War, Ruanda-Urundi was {{classified}} as a United Nations Trust Territory under Belgian administrative authority. During the 1940s, a series of policies caused divisions throughout the country. On 4 October 1943, powers were split in the legislative division of <b>Burundi's</b> government between chiefdoms and lower chiefdoms. Chiefdoms {{were in charge of}} land, and lower sub-chiefdoms were established. Native authorities also had powers. In 1948, Belgium allowed the region to form political parties. These factions contributed to gaining <b>Burundi's</b> independence from Belgium.|$|R
5|$|The group stage {{began on}} 25 November and ended on 3 December with Group C's final matches between Rwanda against Sudan, and Uganda against Somalia. Groups A and C {{contained}} four teams, but {{as there were}} only 11 partaking teams, group B contained only the three teams of <b>Burundi,</b> Zambia, and Zanzibar. At {{the end of the}} group stage, the team who finished bottom of their group was eliminated, whereas the teams who finished in positions other than last in the group progressed to the knock-out rounds.|$|E
5|$|As the {{revolution}} progressed, many Tutsi left Rwanda to escape Hutu purges. The exodus, which began during the November 1959 arson attacks, continued steadily throughout {{the revolution}}. An official, late-1964 total of 336,000 Tutsi settled {{primarily in the}} four neighbouring countries of <b>Burundi,</b> Uganda, Tanganyika (later Tanzania) and Congo-Léopoldville. The exiles, unlike the ethnic Rwandans who migrated during the pre-colonial and colonial eras, were seen as refugees by their host countries and began almost immediately to agitate {{for a return to}} Rwanda. Their aims differed; some sought reconciliation with Kayibanda and the new regime, some affiliated with the exiled King Kigeli and others wished to oust the new PARMEHUTU regime from power and establish a socialist republic.|$|E
5|$|Belgian forces {{took control}} of Rwanda and <b>Burundi</b> during World War I, and the country came under Belgian control in a 1919 League of Nations mandate, named Ruanda-Urundi. Although Belgium {{initially}} continued the German method of government through the monarchy, in 1926, it began a policy of direct colonial rule {{in line with the}} norm in the Congo. Reforms included simplifying the complex three-chieftain system, so one chief (usually Tutsi) instead of three (typically split between Tutsi and Hutu) ruled a local area. Belgian reforms also extended uburetwa (forced labour by Hutus for Tutsi chiefs) to individuals, not just communities, and to regions not previously covered by the system. Tutsi chiefs began a process of land reform with Belgian support; grazing areas traditionally controlled by Hutu collectives were seized by Tutsi and privatised with minimal compensation.|$|E
