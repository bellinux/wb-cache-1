50|$|<b>Bill</b> <b>shock</b> can generically {{be used as}} a {{term for}} the {{surprise}} an individual receives on any bill that has an amount higher than expected pending to be paid. Other examples of <b>bill</b> <b>shock</b> have been noted in credit card bills, rental bills, and utility bills.|$|E
50|$|In telecommunications, <b>bill</b> <b>shock</b> is the {{negative}} reaction a subscriber can experience if their phone bill has unexpected charges. <b>Bill</b> <b>shock</b> can happen when, for example, a user grossly overuses data applications without an appropriate data plan, or uses a mobile device while roaming (whether domestically or internationally) without understanding the voice or data roaming charges involved.|$|E
5000|$|In {{some cases}} <b>bill</b> <b>shock</b> can be extreme, usually {{a result of}} a mobile bill priced into the tens of {{thousands}} of dollars. These cases often make news both locally and nationally due to the sense of compassion the experience provokes, and the suitability the story has for mainstream media. This can result from another company - not the customer's provider - refusing to waive roaming charges. In Europe and the United States, governments are becoming more involved with monitoring issues around <b>bill</b> <b>shock</b> and implementing proper regulations around smart devices that protect consumers. Notably, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission in the United States handles nearly all FCC domestic wireless telecommunications programs, policies, and outreach initiatives. A survey in 2010 revealed that over 30 million Americans are impacted by <b>bill</b> <b>shock</b> each year.|$|E

50|$|Zero-rating (also called {{toll-free}} data or sponsored data) is {{the practice}} of mobile network operators (MNO), mobile virtual network operators (MVNO), and Internet service providers (ISP) not to charge end customers for data used by specific applications or internet services through their network, in limited or metered data plans. It allows customers to use provider-selected content sources or data services like an app store, without worrying about <b>bill</b> <b>shocks,</b> which could otherwise occur if the same data were normally charged according to their data plans and volume caps. This has especially become an option to market 4G networks, but has also {{been used in the}} past for SMS or other content services.|$|R
5000|$|The Goodies {{share their}} feelings, worst embarrassments and mutual recriminations with the others, leading to {{complete}} personality overhauls for both Tim (who changes clothes completely) and Bill (who shaves his beard off, puts a suit on {{and takes his}} pet off his head, purely so that Tim can see him for who he truly is). Tim comes back into the room, showing off his bellybutton. <b>Shocked,</b> <b>Bill</b> says: [...] "Cover up your nakedness!" [...] to which Tim replies: [...] "This isn't nakedness. This is my... BELLY BUTTON!!" [...] <b>Bill,</b> even more <b>shocked,</b> says: [...] "Wash your mouth out." ...|$|R
50|$|There is a {{discussion}} of <b>bill</b> <b>shock</b> and why and how it occurs. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is presented. The concept of a user review is discussed.|$|E
5000|$|It can be {{difficult}} to prevent <b>bill</b> <b>shock</b> while using a mobile device because monitoring the data, voice and SMS and roaming consumption on a mobile device is difficult. It can also {{be difficult}} for phone companies to alert their customers to potential impending <b>bill</b> <b>shock,</b> because various third-party companies impose various roaming charges (a mobile phone company pays other companies for its customer's usage of their networks), so the customer's usage of networks in different areas of the country or the world will result in different charges.|$|E
50|$|Since 1 July 2010 <b>bill</b> <b>shock</b> is mitigated in the EU. Eurotariff {{protected}} consumers {{by introducing}} a cut-off mechanism once the bill reaches €50 per month, unless they choose another cut-off limit.|$|E
40|$|Recent debates around {{electricity}} prices {{and renewable energy}} policy have ignored the crucial factors of rapidly dropping solar technology costs, and the critical risks involved in continuing with 2 ̆ 7 business as usual 2 ̆ 7. Going solar is the first economic assessment of future electricity price shocks if fossil fuels continue to dominate. The report takes {{a close look at}} Australia’s electricity price security and singles out rising gas prices and more frequent droughts as key risks. Prices for gas-fired electricity are now linked to volatile international fuel prices. Water scarcity reduces supply from water-cooled coal plants, pushing up wholesale {{electricity prices}}. Without stable policies to support renewable energy, we risk future <b>bill</b> <b>shocks</b> of up to 250 a year for the average household, plus supply interruptions. Embracing the shift to renewable energy – a line powerfully supported by trends in the USA and China – can reduce vulnerability to electricity price shocks and energy insecurity. Rising popularity and rapidly falling costs put rooftop solar at the leading edge of this change, threatening traditional electricity business models...|$|R

However, in June, point guard Skylar Diggins suffered a knee injury and missed {{the rest of the}} season. On July 20, 2015, majority owner <b>Bill</b> Cameron <b>shocked</b> not just fans in Tulsa, but the WNBA itself as he announced he will move the team to Dallas. The following day, minority owner Stuart Price filed suit against Cameron in a failed attempt to keep the team in Tulsa.|$|R

The Shock were on a roll after having been the worst team in the WNBA in 2002. The Finals were a battle fueled by the relationship between head coaches Michael Cooper (Sparks) and <b>Bill</b> Laimbeer (<b>Shock)</b> which stemmed from their days in the NBA. The rough road to the finals and the tough play of the Shock wore down the Sparks, which lost the series, two games to one, and failed to three-peat.|$|R
5000|$|Previously, the {{called party}} was obligated to quote only the call price from BT landlines.

40|$|Following FCC {{pressure}} to end <b>bill</b> <b>shock,</b> cellular carriers now alert customers when they exceed usage allowances. We estimate {{a model of}} plan choice, usage, and learning using a 2002 – 2004 panel of cellular bills. Accounting for firm price adjustment, we predict that implement-ing alerts in 2002 – 2004 would have lowered average annual consumer welfare by $ 33. We show that consumers are inattentive to past usage, meaning that bill-shock alerts are informative. Additionally, our esti-mates imply that consumers are overconfident, underestimating the variance of future calling. Overconfidence costs consumers $ 76 annu-ally at 2002 – 2004 prices. Absent overconfidence, alerts would have little to no effect. (JEL D 12, D 18, L 11, L 96, L 98) Cellular phone companies frequently offer consumers contracts with included monthly allowances of voice minutes, text messages, and data usage that are followed by overage charges for higher usage. Consumers are often unaware that they are incur-ring overage charges during the month, which leads to <b>bill</b> <b>shock</b> {{at the end of}} the month...|$|E

30|$|A {{government}} wage <b>bill</b> <b>shock</b> of 1 p.p. of GDP raises output {{on impact}} by about 0.92 p.p., and by 0.97 p.p. of GDP one quarter after the shock. Then it gradually returns to zero with a profile resembling {{to the government}} purchase response (Figure  3 A); whereas the cumulative output response is much more pronounced (see Figure  3 A and Tables  1 and 2). In case of a wage <b>bill</b> <b>shock</b> the negative responses of unemployment and unemployment rate are more sizeable and the peak response occurs earlier compared to government spending shocks (see Figures  3 B- 3 C), i.e., unemployment declines by 2.5 % and the unemployment rate falls by 0.30 p.p. on impact. The cumulative unemployment response reaches about - 2.7 p.p. {{one year after the}} shock and - 6.25 p.p. two years after the shock (see Tables  1 and 2). The pre-EAP response of unemployment is much more pronounced the first three quarters after the shock, but then it returns rapidly to zero. The effects are quite dramatic if we assume that the unemployment rate will stabilize around its 2012 value; i.e. the impact response of unemployment rate is - 0.62 becoming - 0.65 one year after the shock. The cumulative responses indicates rapidly rising unemployment rates in the event of cut in government wage bill.|$|E

Situational factors such as experiencing <b>bill</b> <b>shock</b> or having an unresolved service problem may also trigger switching. Implications for research and managers are that the switching process is complex and dynamic and may involve situational factors, best uncovered in qualitative research. 8 page(s...|$|E
30|$|Hence, {{contrary}} to other studies (Lane and Perotti 2003; Alesina et al. 2002) that {{have identified a}} non-Keynesian response of output {{in the case of}} a government wage <b>bill</b> <b>shock</b> due to the (indirect) labor cost channel, in our case we do find a strong Keynesian response of output. An increase in the government wage bill leads to a direct boost in domestic demand, which then expands output and reduces unemployment. This also reveals the important role that the government sector had acquired over the years in the workings of the Greek economy. This has worked through both higher wages and expansion of government employment 22. As a result, cuts in the wage bill component (which are at the heart of the on-going fiscal consolidation effort) have dire consequences for demand and output.|$|E
