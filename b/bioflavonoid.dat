40|$|Bachelor {{thesis is}} considerd with <b>bioflavonoids</b> and their {{contribution}} to the human body. It is described the history, characteristics of <b>bioflavonoids,</b> chemical composition and their sources in food, here. The next part is focused on effects of <b>bioflavonoids</b> against some civilization diseases such as cardiovascular disease or cancer, and emphasizes their importance in human nutrition. The discovery of <b>bioflavonoids</b> is dated to {{the first half of}} the 19 th century when the tanstuffs were detached. <b>Bioflavonoids</b> rank among the group of substances called polyphenols and it´s known more than 20 000 of them. There are ubiqity substances in the vegetal kingdom furnishing the characteristic colouring or taste of fruit and vegetable. Flavonoids are not even in fruit and vegetable but also in pulses, hops, buckwheat, tea, grapevine, chocolate and further spices. The contain of polyphenols in the plant diet can be affected by the variety, conditions of growing, picking maturity, processing, stocking or culinary treatment. The optimal is the flameproof finish in steam when the polyphenols fade away at least. The main place of polyphenol resorption in the human digestive system is the small intestine and colon. <b>Bioflavonoids</b> are thought of the protectors of the vitamin C and these two substances assist to each other in their effects. <b>Bioflavonoids</b> as so-called fytochemical substances make possible to plants to resist a infections and other demage resultings commited by microorganisms, insects or other enemy. The most considerable flavonoids, the part of this bachelory was devoted, fall into quercetin which is often situated in apples, onion, rutin in buckwheat, resveratrol in red wine and catechin in tea. The purpose of this working was to draw up the problems of <b>bioflavonoids</b> and find out which status these substances have, in a human nutrition. The positive effects to a human health agree from their antioxidative treatment at all. The epidemiological studies from the various parts of the world prove that some components of fruit and vegetable have considerable influence to certain types of cancer. In fruit are mentioned the positive effects against the oral cavity cancer, gullet and larynx cancer, in vegetable against stomach illness, colon, rektum and urocyst cancer. Many studies mention the influence of <b>bioflavonoids</b> in a prevention cardio-vascular illness and in a present day also in a ageing process prevention. At the end of the bachelory there are mentioned other positive effects of these substances in assorted illnesses prevention. These effects are due to their ability to inactivate free radicals and reduce risik hydroperoxides. <b>Bioflavonoids</b> assert theirself for example in a varicose veins treatment, piles, paradentos, variety tumours and inflammation. Many people use up ironically rather vitamins as food supplements in place of fresh fruit and vegetable. Because of it that´s necessary to learn that <b>bioflavonoids</b> in fruit, vegetable and other sources are irreplaceable for our health and many times more wholesome than the syntetic preparations...|$|R

BackgroundCold ischemia and reperfusion during kidney transplantation {{are associated}} with release of free oxygen radicals and damage of renal tubular cells. <b>Bioflavonoids</b> may diminish cold storage-induced injury due to antioxidant and iron chelating activities. This {{study was designed to}} delineate the renoprotective mechanisms of <b>bioflavonoids</b> and to define the structural features conferring cytoprotection from cold injury. MethodsLLC-PK 1 cells were preincubated for three hours with <b>bioflavonoids</b> and cold stored in University of Wisconsin (UW) - or Euro-Collins (EC) -solution for 20 hours. After rewarming, cell viability was assessed by the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release, MTT-test, and amino acid transport activity. Lipid peroxidation was assessed from the generation of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances. ResultsTwenty-hours of cold storage of LLC-PK 1 cells resulted in a substantial loss of cell integrity that was more pronounced in the EC (LDH release, 93. 6 ± 1. 6 %) than the UW solution (67. 2 ± 6. 9 %; P < 0. 0001). Pretreatment with quercetin significantly enhanced cell survival (LDH release, 5. 4 ± 2. 7 % for UW and 8. 4 ± 4. 2 % for EC) in a concentration dependent manner. Structure-activity studies revealed similar renoprotection for kaempferol, luteolin and fisetin, unlike myricetin, morin, apigenin, naringenin, catechin, silibinin and rutin. Lipid peroxidation was reduced (UW alone, 2. 7 ± 1. 2 vs. UW+quercetin 0. 5 ± 0. 2 nmol/mg protein, P < 0. 01), and l-threonine uptake completely sustained by pretreatment with quercetin, kaempferol, luteolin, and fisetin. However, renoprotection by fisetin was rapidly lost during rewarming. Protective properties of <b>bioflavonoids</b> were governed by the number and arrangement of hydroxyl substitutes, electron-delocalization, sterical planarity, and lipophilicity of the basic diphenylpyran skeleton. ConclusionCold storage-induced renal tubular cell injury is ameliorated by <b>bioflavonoids.</b> Renoprotective effects of <b>bioflavonoids</b> are defined by structure, suggesting that flavonoids are incorporated into membrane lipid bilayers and interfere with membrane lipid peroxidation...|$|R

40|$|Currently, <b>bioflavonoids</b> {{have been}} known to have strong {{antioxidant}} capacities, and a variety of efforts have been made to identify the utilities of <b>bioflavonoids</b> in treating various diseases based on their antioxidant capacities. The effects of <b>bioflavonoids</b> extracted from the bark of Pinus maritima Pycnogenol (PYC) on free radical formation, activation of redox sensitive transcription factors, as well as interleukin- 1 β (IL- 1 β) production were investigated in murine macrophage cell lines. PYC exerted strong scavenging activities against reactive oxygen species generated either by H 2 O 2 or PMA in RAW 264. 7 and IC- 21 cells, respectively. In situ ELISA, immunoblot analysis, and competitive RT-PCR demonstrated that PYC pretreatment of LPS-stimulated RAW 264. 7 cells dose-dependently reduced both the production of IL- 1 β and its mRNA levels. Furthermore, in the same cells, PYC blocked the activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) and activator protein- 1 (AP- 1), two major transcription factors centrally involved in IL- 1 β gene expression. When RAW 264. 7 cells were stimulated with LPS, the inhibitor protein IκB largely disappeared from cytosolic fractions. However, pretreatment of the cells with PYC abolished the LPS-induced IκB degradation. These results suggest that PYC can inhibit the expression of the proinflammatory cytokine IL- 1 by regulating redox-sensitive transcription factors. This study may support the possibility that <b>bioflavonoids</b> including PYC can be used as antiinflammatory and immunosuppressive drugs based on their radical scavenging activities. ope...|$|R

Methods: Dietary supplement, Flavin 7 ® was added to standard treatments, randomized, multi-center, controlled clinical trial on 295 patients in 33 centers. Results: Flavin 7 ® is a dietary supplement containing <b>bioflavonoid,</b> resveratrol, anthocyanides, vitamins, minerals and trace-minerals. Its oxidative radical scavenging activity is a function of concentration and time, and exceeds the effectiveness of similar products on the market. In this study, the treating physicians found that Flavin 7 ® inhibits the growth of tumours, reduces or alleviates the side effects of chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Flavin 7 ® displays hepatoprotective properties and protects against cardio toxicity. Reduces pain caused by bone metastases. The treating physicians observed improved quality of life and symptoms of depression. Conclusions: The review of international scientific literature and epidemiology data suggest that the role of bioflavonoids is more accepted in prevention. Presently, the scientifically proven treatment methods are not successful to reasonably improve quality of life, survival figures, complete and partial remission. Flavin 7 ® given as a dietary supplement markedly improved the quality of life and the ratio of complete and partial remission of our patients.
