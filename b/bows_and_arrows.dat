5|$|Humans {{have lived}} {{in what is now}} Pennsylvania since at least 10,000BC. The first {{settlers}} were Paleo-Indian nomadic hunters known from their stone tools. The hunter-gatherers of the Archaic period, which lasted locally from 7000to 1000BC, used a greater variety of more sophisticated stone artifacts. The Woodland period marked the gradual transition to semi-permanent villages and horticulture, between 1000BC and 1500AD. Archeological evidence found in the state from this time includes a range of pottery types and styles, burial mounds, pipes, <b>bows</b> <b>and</b> <b>arrows,</b> and ornaments.|$|E
5|$|Sandgate was {{completed}} by the autumn of 1540; Henry may {{have come to the}} castle when he was visiting Folkestone in May 1542. Elizabeth I visited the fortification in 1573, and also used it to imprison the courtier Thomas Keyes for a period, after he married Lady Mary Grey against the Queen's wishes. In 1593, the castle was reported to be equipped with seven artillery pieces - one culverin, two demi-culverins, three sakers and one minion - along with muskets, <b>bows</b> <b>and</b> <b>arrows.</b>|$|E
50|$|For {{long-range}} weapons, the <b>bow</b> <b>and</b> <b>arrow</b> {{was tested}} against the sling. The <b>bow</b> <b>and</b> <b>arrow's</b> effective range was 50 yards while the sling delivered two kills and three wounds with five shots. The edge {{was given to}} the <b>bow</b> <b>and</b> <b>arrow</b> for its superior range, accuracy, rate of fire, and lethality.|$|R
50|$|Throughout {{the history}} of Bhutan, fire <b>and</b> the <b>bow</b> <b>and</b> <b>arrow</b> were an {{important}} means of survival in the highlands during war and on hunts. The <b>bow</b> <b>and</b> <b>arrow</b> {{play a significant role}} in many Bhutanese myths and legends; images of the gods holding a <b>bow</b> <b>and</b> <b>arrows</b> are considered especially favorable. Symbolic and religious significance of the <b>bow</b> <b>and</b> <b>arrow</b> is associated with the legendary murder of Tibetan King Langdarma in the 10th century. The king had persecuted Buddhism, and thus failed to perform his duty as he made mischief. A Buddhist monk, Lhalung Pelgi Dorji, performed the Black Hat Dance to entertain the king, during which he feigned a bow before the king, drew a <b>bow</b> <b>and</b> <b>arrow</b> hidden in the big sleeves of a ceremonial dance costume, and killed the king.|$|R
50|$|The <b>bow</b> <b>and</b> <b>arrow</b> {{constituted}} the classical Indian weapon of warfare, from the Vedic period, until {{the advent of}} Islam. Some Rigvedic hymns lay emphasis {{on the use of}} the <b>bow</b> <b>and</b> <b>arrow.</b>|$|R
5|$|The Tzotzil Maya of {{highland}} Chiapas used spears, thrown rocks, <b>bows</b> <b>and</b> <b>arrows,</b> {{and large}} flexible cotton shields that protected the warrior {{from head to}} foot and could be rolled up for storage. Towns were sometimes defended with walls and barricades, built from packed earth and stone, and reinforced with tree trunks. Defenders would hurl stones down from above, or pour boiling water mixed with lime and ashes upon attackers. As the Spanish became established in Chiapas, indigenous resistance took the form of flight to inaccessible regions.|$|E
5|$|European {{visitors}} in 1667 reported the Sihanaka lived in fortified villages, which they very effectively defended with <b>bows</b> <b>and</b> <b>arrows.</b> They {{were the only}} ethnic group encountered by the European party that had built a bridge. Homes were made of plant material; the Sihanaka believed building homes in brick or clay would invite the displeasure of the ancestors. Gendered roles factored into house construction and maintenance: men applied carpentry to build {{the frame of the}} house and roof, as well as the windows and doors and their frames, while women wove zozoro reed mats that would serve as walls, flooring and roofing.|$|E
5|$|For millennia, archery {{has played}} a pivotal role in Chinese history. Because the {{cultures}} associated with Chinese society spanned a wide geography and time range, the techniques and equipment associated with Chinese archery are diverse. Historical sources and archaeological evidence suggest that a variety of bow designs existed throughout Chinese history. For much of the 20th century, only one Chinese traditional bow and arrow making workshop was active. However, {{in the beginning of the}} 21st century, there has been revival in interest among craftsmen looking to construct <b>bows</b> <b>and</b> <b>arrows</b> in the traditional Chinese style.|$|E

40|$|This thesis reexamines the {{adoption}} of the <b>bow</b> <b>and</b> <b>arrow</b> in the Eastern Woodlands. Archaeologists have usually relied on {{the size and shape of}} projectile points to help them determine when the <b>bow</b> <b>and</b> <b>arrow</b> was adopted, since the other parts of this complex system (e. g., the wooden <b>bows</b> <b>and</b> <b>arrow</b> shafts) do not survive well in the Eastern Woodlands. The current belief is that the <b>bow</b> <b>and</b> <b>arrow</b> was introduced during the Late Woodland period (AD 500) in the Eastern Woodlands. This is based on the wide spread use of small stone projectile points and on their continued use up to European contact. However, this small point technology was actually established during the Late Archaic period (2000 BC). A wide range of evidence is presented in this thesis that shows that the <b>bow</b> <b>and</b> <b>arrow</b> may have been adopted during the Late Archaic period and was well established during the Middle Woodland period (AD 100) in several Eastern Woodland states.

5|$|From the Glades peoples, {{two major}} nations {{emerged in the}} area: the Calusa and the Tequesta. The Calusa was {{the largest and most}} {{powerful}} nation in South Florida. It controlled fifty villages located on Florida's west coast, around Lake Okeechobee, and on the Florida Keys. Most Calusa villages were located at the mouths of rivers or on key islands. The Calusa were hunter-gatherers who lived on small game, fish, turtles, alligators, shellfish, and various plants. Most of their tools were made of bone or teeth, although sharpened reeds were also effective for hunting or war. Calusa weapons consisted of <b>bows</b> <b>and</b> <b>arrows,</b> atlatls, and spears. Canoes were used for transportation, and South Florida tribes often canoed through the Everglades, but rarely lived in them. Canoe trips to Cuba were also common.|$|E
5|$|Maya armies {{were highly}} disciplined, and warriors participated in regular {{training}} exercises and drills; every able-bodied adult male {{was available for}} military service. Maya states did not maintain standing armies; warriors were mustered by local officials who reported back to appointed warleaders. There were also units of full-time mercenaries who followed permanent leaders. Most warriors were not full-time, however, and were primarily farmers; {{the needs of their}} crops usually came before warfare. Maya warfare was not so much aimed at destruction of the enemy as the seizure of captives and plunder. Maya warriors entered battle against the Spanish with flint-tipped spears, <b>bows</b> <b>and</b> <b>arrows</b> and stones. They wore padded cotton armour to protect themselves. The Spanish described the weapons of war of the Petén Maya as <b>bows</b> <b>and</b> <b>arrows,</b> fire-sharpened poles, flint-headed spears and two-handed swords crafted from strong wood with the blade fashioned from inset obsidian, similar to the Aztec macuahuitl. Maya warriors wore body armour in the form of quilted cotton that had been soaked in salt water to toughen it; the resulting armour compared favourably to the steel armour worn by the Spanish. Warriors bore wooden or animal hide shields decorated with feathers and animal skins. The Maya had historically employed ambush and raiding as their preferred tactic, and its employment against the Spanish proved troublesome for the Europeans. In response to the use of cavalry, the highland Maya took to digging pits on the roads, lining them with fire-hardened stakes and camouflaging them with grass and weeds, a tactic that according to the Kaqchikel killed many horses.|$|E

5|$|On February 23, 1854, Irataba, Cairook, {{and other}} Mohave people {{encountered}} an expedition led by military officers Amiel Whipple and J.C.

Whipple and his men counted six hundred Mohave gathered near their camp, trading corn, beans, squash, and wheat for beads and calico. By {{the end of their}} commerce, the party had purchased six bushels of corn and two hundred pounds of flour. The Mohave played a traditional game played with a hoop and pole, and the two groups entertained themselves with target practice, the Mohave using <b>bows</b> <b>and</b> <b>arrows</b> and the whites firing pistols and rifles. When the expedition had difficulty crossing the Colorado on February 27, several Mohave jumped into the water and helped salvage the supplies.|$|E

5|$|The Spanish {{conquest of}} El Salvador was the {{campaign}} {{undertaken by the}} Spanish conquistadores against the Late Postclassic Mesoamerican polities in the territory that is now incorporated into the modern Central American nation of El Salvador. El Salvador is the smallest country in Central America, and is dominated by two mountain ranges running east-west. Its climate is tropical, and the year is divided into wet and dry seasons. Before the conquest the country formed {{a part of the}} Mesoamerican cultural region, and was inhabited by a number of indigenous peoples, including the Pipil, the Lenca, the Xinca, and Maya. Native weaponry consisted of spears, <b>bows</b> <b>and</b> <b>arrows,</b> and wooden swords with inset stone blades; they wore padded cotton armour.|$|E

5|$|When encountering natives in the New World, Spanish explorers were {{occasionally}} {{told of a}} tribe composed {{entirely of}} women.

Juan de Grijalva was told of Amazons during his 1518 expedition through the Tabasco region of Mexico. Nuño de Guzmán followed tales of a nation of women who lived in riches on or near the sea, women with whiter skin who were accounted goddesses by the natives. He described how they used <b>bows</b> <b>and</b> <b>arrows,</b> and lived in many towns. Polk characterized Guzmán as driven by lust for sex and riches—his greed and sadism were well known.|$|E
5|$|Like its {{predecessor}} , Seeds of Evil is a first-person shooter where the player assumes {{the role of}} Turok from a first-person perspective. As Turok, the player can run, jump, climb ladders, swim and dive underwater for a limited period of time. The player can carry an unlimited number of weapons, ranging from <b>bows</b> <b>and</b> <b>arrows</b> to pistols, rifles, a shotgun, a grenade launcher, a flamethrower, a speargun, and more advanced weapons such as the Cerebral Bore, which fires a homing projectile capable of latching onto enemy's heads, killing them by drilling into their skulls and exploding. Turok has {{a certain amount of}} health which decreases when attacked by enemies. If Turok's health is fully depleted, the player loses one Life Force point and has to continue the game from a previous checkpoint. If the player loses all Life Force points, the game will be over. Ammunition, health, and Life Force suppliers can be collected throughout the game to increase the player's resources.|$|E

5|$|On September 1, 1857, a joint {{force of}} Mohave and Quechan warriors {{launched}} a major attack {{with hundreds of}} warriors on a Maricopa village close to Maricopa Wells, Arizona, on the Gila river. The Battle of Pima Butte was described {{by a group of}} white mail carriers who witnessed it. They stated that the battle was fought mostly with clubs, as well as <b>bows</b> <b>and</b> <b>arrows,</b> and that probably more than 100 warriors died, most of them from the attacking party. It is unknown whether Irataba participated in the attack, but given his status as kwanami, it is likely that he did. The battle has been described as the last major battle involving only Native American nations. This defeat put the Mohave on the defensive, wary of the possibility that whites would take this moment of weakness as an opportunity to begin settling on tribal lands.|$|E
5|$|The Spanish {{conquest of}} Yucatán was the {{campaign}} {{undertaken by the}} Spanish conquistadores against the Late Postclassic Maya states and polities in the Yucatán Peninsula, a vast limestone plain covering south-eastern Mexico, northern Guatemala, and all of Belize. The Spanish conquest of the Yucatán Peninsula was hindered by its politically fragmented state. The Spanish engaged in a strategy of concentrating native populations in newly founded colonial towns. Native resistance to the new nucleated settlements {{took the form of}} the flight into inaccessible regions such as the forest or joining neighbouring Maya groups that had not yet submitted to the Spanish. Among the Maya, ambush was a favoured tactic. Spanish weaponry included broadswords, rapiers, lances, pikes, halberds, crossbows, matchlocks and light artillery. Maya warriors fought with flint-tipped spears, <b>bows</b> <b>and</b> <b>arrows</b> and stones, and wore padded cotton armour to protect themselves. The Spanish introduced a number of Old World diseases previously unknown in the Americas, initiating devastating plagues that swept through the native populations.|$|E
5|$|The main {{striking}} {{force of the}} Parthian army was its cataphracts, heavy cavalry with man and horse decked in mailed armor. The cataphracts were equipped with a lance for charging into enemy lines, but were not equipped with <b>bows</b> <b>and</b> <b>arrows</b> which were restricted to horse archers. Due {{to the cost of}} their equipment and armor, cataphracts were recruited from among the aristocratic class who, in return for their services, demanded a measure of autonomy at the local level from the Arsacid kings. The light cavalry was recruited from among the commoner class and acted as horse archers; they wore a simple tunic and trousers into battle. They used composite bows and were able to shoot at enemies while riding and facing away from them; this technique, known as the Parthian shot, was a highly effective tactic.|$|E
