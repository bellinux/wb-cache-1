5|$|Cultivation {{from seed}} may be {{difficult}} or easy, depending on the species. The more difficult species to grow include the ones that require a period of dormancy or smoke treatment to simulate a bushfire. Stylidium specimens should be grown in a medium that is kept moist and has a relatively low concentration of nutrients. It {{should also be noted}} that they appear to <b>be</b> <b>sensitive</b> <b>to</b> disturbance of their root systems. Minimization of such disturbance will likely result in healthier plants.|$|E
5|$|In {{neutrino}} astronomy, astronomers use heavily shielded {{underground facilities}} such as SAGE, GALLEX, and Kamioka II/III {{for the detection}} of neutrinos. The vast majority of the neutrinos streaming through the Earth originate from the Sun, but 24 neutrinos were also detected from supernova 1987A. Cosmic rays, which consist of very high energy particles (atomic nuclei) that can decay or be absorbed when they enter the Earth's atmosphere, result in a cascade of secondary particles which can be detected by current observatories. Some future neutrino detectors may also <b>be</b> <b>sensitive</b> <b>to</b> the particles produced when cosmic rays hit the Earth's atmosphere.|$|E

40|$|The {{strains of}} Vibrio parahaemolyticus {{isolated}} from water, sediment, plankton, fish and prawn of Cochin backwater were tested for sensitivity to ten antibiotics namely, ampicillin, chloramphenicol, gentamycin, kanamycin, neomycin, oxytetracycline, penicillin, polymyxin-B, streptomycin and sulphadiazine. Of the 120 isolates tested, 96. 7 and 93. 3 % <b>were</b> <b>sensitive</b> <b>to</b> gentamycin and chloramphenicol respectively.

5|$|Penicillin {{has been}} {{suggested}} as the drug of choice {{for the treatment of}} S.iniae infection in mammals, including humans. In the 1995–1996 cluster of human cases, all clinical s were susceptible to penicillin, several cephalosporins, clindamycin, erythromycin, and co-trimoxazole (MICs 0.25µg/ml); all nine patients were treated with parenteral beta-lactam antibiotics and recovered uneventfully. A study of isolates submitted to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention between 2000 and 2004 found all to <b>be</b> <b>sensitive</b> <b>to</b> beta-lactams, macrolides, quinolones, and vancomycin.|$|E
5|$|Tooth decay {{is caused}} by certain types of acid-producing {{bacteria}} which cause the most damage {{in the presence of}} fermentable carbohydrates such as sucrose, fructose, and glucose. The resulting acidic levels in the mouth affect teeth because a tooth's special mineral content causes it to <b>be</b> <b>sensitive</b> <b>to</b> low pH. Depending on the extent of tooth destruction, various treatments can be used to restore teeth to proper form, function, and aesthetics, but there is no known method to regenerate large amounts of tooth structure. Instead, dental health organizations advocate preventative and prophylactic measures, such as regular oral hygiene and dietary modifications, to avoid dental caries.|$|E
5|$|A person's {{experience}} in managing sexuality after the injury relies {{not only on}} physical factors like severity and level of the injury, but on aspects of life circumstances and personality such as sexual experience and attitudes about sex. As well as evaluating physical concerns, clinicians {{must take into account}} factors that affect each patient's situation: gender, age, cultural, and social factors. Aspects of patients' cultural and religious backgrounds, even if unnoticed before the injury caused sexual dysfunction, affect care and treatments—particularly when cultural attitudes and assumptions of patients and care providers conflict. Health professionals must <b>be</b> <b>sensitive</b> <b>to</b> issues of sexual orientation and gender identity, showing respect and acceptance while communicating, listening, and emotionally supporting. Providers who treat SCI have been found to assume their patients are heterosexual or to exclude LGBTQ patients from their awareness, potentially resulting in substandard care. Academic research on sexuality and disability under-represents LGBTQ perspectives as well.|$|E

5|$|Being a brachycephalic breed, King Charles Spaniels can <b>be</b> <b>sensitive</b> <b>to</b> anesthesia. This {{is because}} in brachycephalic dogs, there is {{additional}} {{tissue in the}} throat directly behind the mouth and nasal cavity, known as the pharynx, and anesthesia acts as a muscle relaxant causing this tissue to obstruct the dogs' narrow airways. These narrow airways can decrease the dogs' ability to exercise properly and increase their susceptibility to heat stroke. Other congenital and hereditary disorders found in the King Charles Spaniel are hanging tongue, where a neurological defect prevents the tongue from retracting into the mouth; diabetes mellitus, which {{may be associated with}} cataracts; cleft palate and umbilical hernia. The English Toy Spaniel Club of America recommends that umbilical hernias be corrected only if other surgery is required, due to the risk of surgery in brachycephalic breeds. In another study conducted by the OFA, the King Charles Spaniel was the 38th worst of 99 breeds for patella luxation; of 75 animals tested, 4% were found to have the ailment. However, surveys conducted by the Finnish breed club between 1988 and 2007 found that the occurrences were higher in some years, ranging from 5.3% to 50%.|$|E

40|$|Background/PurposePollen allergy is {{believed}} to be less common in East Asia, Latin America, and tropical areas. The {{purpose of this study was}} to understand the role of pollen allergy in Taiwan. MethodsPatients with clinically diagnosed allergic rhinitis were enrolled. All subjects received a 30 -item skin test panel that included perennial allergens (house dust mix, Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus, Dermatophagoides farinae, dog epithelium, cat hairs, cockroach mix, and Candida albicans) and pollen allergens (acacia, pine mix, eucalyptus, beefwood, juniper mix, willow, mulberry mix, pepper tree, cedar, Johnson grass, Bermuda grass, ragweed mix, Timothy grass, spiny pigweed, cocklebur, sage mix, sheep sorrel, dog fennel, pigweed mix, English plantain, castor bean, alfalfa, and dandelion). ResultsA total of 419 patients were recruited. A total of 313 (74. 7 %) had a positive skin test. A total of 288 patients (68. 7 %) <b>were</b> <b>sensitive</b> <b>to</b> perennial allergens, and 11 8 patients (28. 2 %) <b>were</b> <b>sensitive</b> <b>to</b> pollen allergens. However, 93 pollen-sensitive patients <b>were</b> also <b>sensitive</b> <b>to</b> perennial allergens, and only 25 <b>were</b> <b>sensitive</b> <b>to</b> pollen allergens alone. The most common allergens were D. pteronyssinus, D. farinae, house dust mix, and cockroach, but the most common pollen allergens were spiny pigweed, Johnson grass, and sheep sorrel. All nasal symptoms tended to be more severe in patients who <b>were</b> <b>sensitive</b> <b>to</b> perennial allergens than in those who <b>were</b> <b>sensitive</b> <b>to</b> pollen allergens alone. ConclusionMost patients with allergic rhinitis in Taiwan <b>are</b> <b>sensitive</b> <b>to</b> perennial allergens, and pollens are a less common allergen...|$|R
