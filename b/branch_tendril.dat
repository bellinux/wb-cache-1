50|$|Leaves are compound, with {{leaflets}} {{arranged in}} threes (perennial species) or pinnately (mostly annuals). The leaflet {{at the end}} of each leaf is transformed into a <b>branched</b> <b>tendril.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{leaves are}} stipulate, {{alternate}} and compound, each {{made up of}} 3-8 opposite pairs of linear, lance-shaped, oblong, or wedge-shaped, needle-tipped leaflets up to 35 mm long. Each compound leaf ends in a <b>branched</b> <b>tendril.</b>|$|R
50|$|It is a {{prolific}} climber, reaching heights of 20 - 30 m in the wild, using small <b>branched</b> <b>tendrils</b> with twining tips. The leaves are palmately compound, composed of five leaflets, and range from 3 - 20 cm across. The leaflets have a toothed margin.|$|R
50|$|The {{roots are}} large, fleshy, and perennial, {{leading to a}} high {{survival}} rate due to the long tap root. The vine-like stems spread in all directions for a few meters looking for something over which to climb. If present, shrubs and herbs are preferred and climbed by means of axiliary <b>branching</b> <b>tendrils.</b>|$|R
50|$|Cissus anisophylla is a liana {{climbing}} {{over other}} vegetation {{by means of}} <b>branched</b> <b>tendrils.</b> Stems are round in cross-section, hairless. Leaves are broadly ovate, up to 14 cm long and 10 cm across. Flowers are green, about 5 mm in diameter, borne in compound cymes up to 6 cm across, with minutely hairy peduncles.|$|R
50|$|This {{species is}} {{perennial}} with climbing stems. The leaves have 4 to 12 pairs of leaflets and end in <b>branched</b> <b>tendrils.</b> The flowers are 15 to 20 mm long arranged in racemes {{of up to}} 18 flowers. The petals are white with purple veins and the fruit is a pod or legume with 4 to 5 seeds.|$|R
5000|$|Lathyrus latifolius has winged hairless stems, and {{alternating}} blue green compound leaves {{consisting of}} {{a single pair of}} leaflets and a winged petiole about 2" [...] long. The leaflets are narrowly ovate or oblong-ovate, smooth along the margins, hairless and up to 3" [...] long and 1" [...] across. There is a <b>branched</b> <b>tendrils</b> between the leaflets.|$|R
5000|$|A rhizomatous plant. Its {{climbing}} habit {{is enabled}} by <b>branched</b> <b>tendrils</b> {{at the end}} of each leaf stem, which curl around surrounding plants. The stems are not branched, are almost glabrous, sometimes with rare soft hairs, single, mostly 30 to 40 cm long but sometimes as much as 100 cm. The leaves are compound and pinnate with 4 to 8 pairs of opposite leaflets ending in <b>branched</b> <b>tendrils.</b> Leaflets are 20 to 30 mm long, 8 to 10 mm wide, elongated elliptical in form with broad bases and glabrous at both sides. Flower stalks are very short with 2 to 6 almost sessile flowers on each. Flowers are 12 to 15 mm long, reddish-lilac or lilac-blue. Similar in appearance to common vetch (Vicia sativa) but each stem of the latter has more flowers, and bush vetch is usually hairless whereas V. sativa is slightly hairy.|$|R

50|$|It is a {{deciduous}} woody vine {{growing to}} 30 m tall or more given suitable support, attaching itself {{by means of}} numerous small <b>branched</b> <b>tendrils</b> tipped with sticky disks. The leaves are simple, palmately lobed with three lobes, occasionally unlobed or with five lobes, or sufficiently deeply lobed to be palmately compound with (usually) three leaflets; the leaves range from 5 to 22 cm across. The flowers are inconspicuous, greenish, in clusters; the fruit is a small dark blue grape 5-10 mm diameter.|$|R
50|$|This {{delicate}} looking {{plant is}} a hairless annual (or occasionally perennial) up to a metre tall with weak, often pinkish, clambering stems. The leaves are pale to medium green, doubly compound, the leaflets being well-stalked and {{divided into three}} to five sub-leaflets, and ending in a <b>branching</b> <b>tendril.</b> The flowers are small, pale creamy-yellow, in short axilliary spikes. Each flower is elongated and tubular with a lip and spur and stamens in two bundles. The seed pods are short, usually narrowing between the two seeds.|$|R
50|$|Cultivated species produce gourds in {{a variety}} of shapes. However, all are creeping, annual {{tropical}} vines with large-lobed leaves and <b>branching</b> <b>tendrils.</b> The skin color reflects hybrids, varying from dark green to light yellow. The flesh can also vary in color, but most common is bright orange or yellow. Varieties differ somewhat in taste and texture, but are generally slightly sweet with a firm but soft texture. Farmers' markets in South America offer varieties of calabaza in a fashion similar to the variety of apples that might be present in a North American market.|$|R
40|$|International audienceCucumis sativus L. (cucumber), a {{creeping}} plant of the Cucurbitaceae family, is widely cultivated for its fruit. It is a tender annual with a rough, succulent, trailing stem and hairy leaves with {{three to five}} pointed lobes; the stem bears <b>branched</b> <b>tendrils</b> by which the plant can be trained on supports. Depending on the cultivar, the fruits are available in many different sizes, shapes, and colors. They range from thick, stubby little fruits (10 – 12 cm long) to Dutch greenhouse varieties (of up to 50 cm long) ...|$|R
5000|$|Cow vetch {{is in the}} Fabaceae {{family and}} similar to a pea in growth habit with {{climbing}} stems growing to 150 cm long, perennial, sending out noose-like <b>branched</b> <b>tendrils</b> from the tips of its leaves when it contacts another plant and securely fastens itself. This can cause [...] "strangling" [...] of smaller plants. An individual plant may reach a length (or height) of 2 m with a white taproot, which may extend up to 1 m. The leaves are 3-8 cm long, pinnate, with 8-12 pairs of leaflets, each leaflet 5-10 mm long.|$|R
60|$|In {{the allied}} Eccremocarpus the internodes, petioles, and much- <b>branched</b> <b>tendrils</b> all spontaneously revolve together. The tendrils do {{not as a}} whole turn from the light; but their bluntly-hooked {{extremities}} arrange themselves neatly on any surface with which they come into contact, apparently {{so as to avoid}} the light. They act best when each branch seizes a few thin stems, like the culms of a grass, which they afterwards draw together into a solid bundle by the spiral contraction of all the branches. In Cobaea the finely- <b>branched</b> <b>tendrils</b> alone revolve; the branches terminate in sharp, hard, double, little hooks, with both points directed to the same side; and these turn by well-adapted movements to any object with which they come into contact. The tips of the branches also crawl into dark crevices or holes. The tendrils and internodes of Ampelopsis have little or no power of revolving; the tendrils are but little sensitive to contact; their hooked extremities cannot seize thin objects; they will not even clasp a stick, unless in extreme need of a support; but they turn from the light to the dark, and, spreading out their branches in contact with any nearly flat surface, develop discs. These adhere by the secretion of some cement to a wall, or even to a polished surface; and this is more than the discs of the Bignonia capreolata can effect.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis work {{describes}} a new, to our knowledge, strategy of efficient colonization {{and community development}} where bacteria substantially alter their physical environment. Many bacteria move in groups, in a mode described as swarming, to colonize surfaces and form biofilms to survive external stresses, including exposure to antibiotics. One such bacterium is Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which is an opportunistic pathogen responsible for both acute and persistent infections in susceptible individuals, as exampled by those for burn victims and people with cystic fibrosis. Pseudomonas aeruginosa often, but not always, forms <b>branched</b> <b>tendril</b> patterns during swarming; this phenomena occurs only when bacteria produce rhamnolipid, which is regulated by population-dependent signaling called quorum sensing. The experimental results of this work show that P.  aeruginosa cells propagate as high density waves that move symmetrically as rings within swarms toward the extending tendrils. Biologically justified cell-based multiscale model simulations suggest a mechanism of wave propagation {{as well as a}} <b>branched</b> <b>tendril</b> formation {{at the edge of the}} population that depends upon competition between the changing viscosity of the bacterial liquid suspension and the liquid film boundary expansion caused by Marangoni forces. Therefore, P.  aeruginosa efficiently colonizes surfaces by controlling the physical forces responsible for expansion of thin liquid film and by propagating toward the tendril tips. The model predictions of wave speed and swarm expansion rate as well as cell alignment in tendrils were confirmed experimentally. The study results suggest that P.  aeruginosa responds to environmental cues on a very short timescale by actively exploiting local physical phenomena to develop communities and efficiently colonize new surfaces...|$|R
5000|$|Lathyrus sulphureus is a hairless {{perennial}} herb {{with leaves}} {{made up of}} many oval-shaped leaflets each up to 4 centimeters long. The leaves are tipped with <b>branching,</b> coiled <b>tendrils</b> and the large stipules may be over 2 centimeters long.|$|R
50|$|This vetch is a {{perennial}} herb with stout, hollow, and ridged climbing stems that may reach two meters in length. It attaches to objects {{and other plants}} by its large <b>branched</b> <b>tendrils</b> for support. The leaves {{are made up of}} 9 to 13 pairs of lance-shaped or elongated oval leaflets that may measure up to 4 centimeters in length. The inflorescence is a one-sided raceme of up to 15 or 20 flowers which have pale pink to dark reddish purple or sometimes yellowish to orange corollas. The flowers, each with a calyx about half as long as the corolla, are 1 to 2 centimeters long. They yield fruits which are legume pods measuring up to 4 centimeters long by 1.5 wide. As they dry they turn black.|$|R
50|$|Throughout the rainforests {{they are}} found no higher than 1,500 meters. During the night, it is common that the adults form groups 3 to 10 meters above the ground.

40|$|International audienceThis chapter compares some of {{the growth}} {{strategies}} associated with different attachment and stem mechanics. It investigates {{some of the}} functional and developmentally variable traits that contribute to their ecological success. The chapter explores how different climbing plants attach mechanically to their supports, and discusses the forces generated by leaf friction, hooks, <b>branches,</b> <b>tendrils,</b> roots, and twining stems. It further provides quantitative comparisons {{of the kinds of}} forces these structures can withstand, and the reliability of their connection with the host. The chapter discusses how attachment and adaptive variations of mechanical properties contribute to profound developmental plasticity in vines and lianas. Changes in developmental timing among vines and lianas – between juvenile self-supporting and mature non-self-supporting traits – are undoubtedly linked to other functional traits and potential trade-offs involving water provisioning, leaf surface area, photosynthesis, and growth rate...|$|R
5000|$|Lathyrus linifolius is a {{perennial}} plant with a sprawling or climbing stem that grows to 25 to 80 cm and is shallowly-winged and nearly hairless. The leaves are alternate with short winged stalks and long narrow stipules. The leaf blades are pinnate with {{two to four}} pairs of narrow lanceolate leaflets, entire margins and a terminal <b>branching</b> <b>tendril.</b> The inflorescence has a long stem and two to eight purple flowers, each 12 to 20 mm long. These have five sepals and five petals and are irregular. The uppermost petal {{is known as the}} [...] "standard", the lateral two as the [...] "wings" [...] and the lowest two are joined to form the [...] "keel". There are ten stamens and a single carpel. The fruit is a flat brown pod containing up to twelve seeds. This plant flowers in July and August.|$|R
60|$|Tendrils {{of which}} the {{extremities}} are permanently and slightly curved, are sensitive only on the concave surface; other tendrils, {{such as those of}} the Cobaea (though furnished with horny hooks directed to one side) and those of Cissus discolor, are sensitive on all sides. Hence the tendrils of this latter plant, when stimulated by a touch of equal force on opposite sides, did not bend. The inferior and lateral surfaces of the tendrils of Mutisia are sensitive, but not the upper surface. With <b>branched</b> <b>tendrils,</b> the several <b>branches</b> act alike; but in the Hanburya the lateral spur-like branch does not acquire (for excellent reasons which have been explained) its sensitiveness nearly so soon as the main <b>branch.</b> With most <b>tendrils</b> the lower or basal part is either not at all sensitive, or sensitive only to prolonged contact. We thus see that the sensitiveness of tendrils is a special and localized capacity. It is quite independent of the power of spontaneously revolving; for the curling of the terminal portion from touch does not in the least interrupt the former movement. In Bignonia unguis and its close allies, the petioles of the leaves, as well as the tendrils, are sensitive to a touch.|$|R
5000|$|This is a {{perennial}} herb with a long, winged stem which climbs {{by means of}} <b>branched,</b> coiled <b>tendrils.</b> The leaves {{are made up of}} several pairs of lance-shaped leaflets. The plant bears an inflorescence of up to 15 pink or purplish flowers each up to 2 centimeters wide. The fruit is a hairless, dehiscent legume pod.|$|R
40|$|Leaves have {{undergone}} structural modifications over evolutionary time, and presently exist in many forms. For instance, in Fabaceae and Bignoniaceae, leaf parts {{can be modified}} into tendrils. Currently, no data are available on genic control of tendrilled leaf development outside Fabaceae. Here, we conducted a detailed study of three representatives of Bignonieae: Amphilophium buccinatorium, Dolichandra unguis-cati, and Bignonia callistegioides, bearing multifid, trifid, and simple-tendrilled leaves, respectively. We investigated the structure of their petioles, petiolules, leaflets, and tendrils through histological analyses. Additionally, the expression of SHOOTMERISTEMLESS (STM), PHANTASTICA (PHAN), and LEAFY/FLORICAULA (LFY/FLO) during leaf development was analyzed by in situ hybridizations. Tendrils share some anatomical similarities with leaflets, but not with other leaf parts. Transcripts of both STM and LFY/FLO were detected in leaf primordia, associated with regions from which leaflets and <b>tendril</b> <b>branches</b> originate. PHAN expression {{was found to be}} polarized in <b>branched</b> <b>tendrils,</b> but not in simple tendrils. In Bignonieae, tendrils are modified leaflets that, as a result of premature completion of development, become bladeless organs. Bignonieae leaves develop differently from those of peas, as both LFY/FLO and STM are expressed in developing leaves of Bignonieae. Moreover, PHAN is probably involved in tendril diversification in Bignonieae, as it has distinct expression patterns in different leaf types.

50|$|Echinocystis lobata is {{an annual}} vine that {{produces}} stems {{that can be}} as long as 8 m and which climb, {{with the help of}} coiling, <b>branched</b> <b>tendrils,</b> over shrubs and fences or trail across the ground. The stems are angular and furrowed. The leaves are alternate with long petioles, five palmate lobes and no stipules. The flowers are monoecious, with separate male and female blooms on the same plant. The male flowers are in long-stemmed, upright panicles. Each flower has a white, or greenish-yellow, corolla with six slender lobes. The male flower has a single central stamen with a yellow anther. The female flower has a single stigma and is borne on a short stalk {{at the base of the}} flower panicle, with the spiky globular inferior ovary being immediately beneath. The fruit is a prickly, inflated capsule up to 5 cm long with two pores and four seeds. It resembles a tiny spiny water melon, persists all winter and then opens at the bottom, liberating the seeds. This species can be distinguished from the oneseed bur cucumber (Sicyos angulatus) by the six-lobed corolla and the lack of the clustered fruits that that plant bears.|$|R
50|$|Lathyrus tuberosus, {{also known}} as the {{tuberous}} pea, tuberous vetchling, earthnut pea, or aardaker, is a small, climbing perennial plant, native in moist temperate parts of Europe and Western Asia. The plant is a trailer or weak climber, supported by tendrils, growing to 1.2 m tall. The leaves are pinnate, with two leaflets and a <b>branched</b> twining <b>tendril</b> at the apex of the petiole. Its flowers are hermaphroditic, pollinated by bees. The plants can also spread vegetatively from the root system.|$|R
5000|$|Growing {{from a large}} {{tuberous}} rootstock {{and found}} up to 2000m, in open woodland and grassland, often on granite outcrops, it occasionally develops <b>tendrils.</b> <b>Branch</b> nodes are conspicuously swollen and new parts of the plant have a ferruginous, floccose covering, persisting on the bracts.|$|R
50|$|The vine {{produces}} long branching annual stems that {{climb over}} shrubs and fences or trail across the ground. The stems are hairy, pale green and furrowed. The alternate leaves have {{three to five}} palmate lobes and can be 8 in across. The margin is slightly toothed, the upper surface of the blade is usually hairless and the under side has fine hairs, especially on the veins. The petiole is thick and hairy, and about 5 in long. The leaf is deeply indented where it {{is attached to the}} petiole. Opposite some of the junctions formed by the petiole and stem, grow <b>branched</b> <b>tendrils,</b> and at others there are flower shoots. The flowers are monoecious, with separate male and female blooms. The male flowers are in long-stemmed racemes. Each flower is about 0.3 in wide, with a calyx with five pointed teeth, a whitish, green-veined corolla with five lobes, and a central boss of stamens. The small female flowers are bunched together on a short stalk, each having its ovary enclosed in a spiny, hairy fruit; one seed is produced by each flower. The fruit is about 0.5 in long, green at first but becomes brown with age; it is dispersed by animals which come into contact with its bristly surface.|$|R
50|$|The {{watermelon}} {{is a large}} annual {{plant with}} long, weak, trailing or climbing stems which are five-angled (five-sided) and up to 3 m long. Young growth is densely woolly with yellowish-brown hairs which disappear as the plant ages. The leaves are large, coarse, hairy pinnately-lobed and alternate; they get stiff and rough when old. The plant has <b>branching</b> <b>tendrils.</b> The white to yellow flowers grow singly in the leaf axils and the corolla is white or yellow inside and greenish-yellow on the outside. The flowers are unisexual, with male and female flowers occurring on the same plant (monoecious). The male flowers predominate {{at the beginning of}} the season; the female flowers, which develop later, have inferior ovaries. The styles are united into a single column. The large fruit is a kind of modified berry called a pepo with a thick rind (exocarp) and fleshy center (mesocarp and endocarp). Wild plants have fruits up to 20 cm in diameter, while cultivated varieties may exceed 60 cm. The rind of the fruit is mid- to dark green and usually mottled or striped, and the flesh, containing numerous pips spread throughout the inside, can be red or pink (most commonly), orange, yellow, green or white.|$|R
