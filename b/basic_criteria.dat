The neo-Classical approach, {{similar to that of}} the White House and the Federal Capitol in the United States, was popular at the time and had already been used by Soane in his additions to the old palace, but had connotations of revolution and republicanism, whereas Gothic design embodied conservative values. The committee in the House of Lords announced in June 1835 that [...] "the style of the buildings should be either Gothic or Elizabethan". On 14 July 1835 a Royal Commission was appointed. The chairman was Charles Hanbury-Tracy and the other members were Edward Cust, Thomas Liddell, the poet Samuel Rogers and the artist George Vivian.

2500|$|A {{recovery}} {{plan for the}} Laysan duck has been developed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. [...] The goal of the recovery program is to conserve and recover the species {{to the extent that}} it may be down-listed from endangered to threatened in the near future, and ultimately, that the population be healthy enough to no longer require federal protection under the Endangered Species Act. [...] The emphasis of the {{recovery plan}} is the distribution of additional viable populations in the Laysan duck’s historical and prehistorical range. [...] The creation of multiple populations will decrease the risk that catastrophic events will result in species extinction. [...] The increase of population size will diminish the threats from demographic and environmental uncertainties. [...] To achieve this goal, biologists plan to establish at least five populations on a combination of predator-free Northwestern Hawaiian Islands and predator-controlled sites on Main Hawaiian Islands. [...] This plan includes wild translocation and the establishment of a successful captive or semi-captive breeding program using wild source eggs for reintroductions to the Main Hawaiian Islands. Additionally, the plan calls for achieving gene flow between the wild source populations through long-term inter-island translocations, and island-specific management for each population to reduce threats and improve quality of habitat. [...] If <b>basic</b> <b>criteria</b> of the recovery plan are met, the Laysan duck could be down-listed from endangered to threatened by 2019.|$|E

2500|$|The {{remarkable}} {{stability of}} cyclotides {{means that they}} have an exciting range of potential applications centred on either their intrinsic biological activities or the possibility of using the CCK motif as a scaffold for stabilizing biologically active epitopes. [...] Interest in these has recently intensified with the publications of a chemical methodology capable of synthetically producing cyclotides with high yields, and the amenability of the CCK framework to amino-acid substitutions. [...] But for molecules to be useful in a therapeutic setting they require useful biopharmaceutical characteristics such as resistance to proteolysis and membrane permeability. The membrane interactive surface area and moment of the cyclotides are determinants in the prediction of their biological activities. A recent study on related cystine knot proteins as drug candidates showed that cystine knots do permeate well through rat small intestinal mucosa relative to non-cystine knot peptide drugs such as insulin and bacitracin. Furthermore, enzymatic digestion of cystine knot peptide drugs was associated with only a few proteases and it was suggested that this limitation may be overcome by mutating out particular cleavage sites. Thus, certain cystine knot proteins satisfy the <b>basic</b> <b>criteria</b> for drug delivery and represent exciting novel candidates as scaffolds for peptide drug delivery. [...] The diverse range of intrinsic activities of cyclotides also continues to hold promise {{for a wide range of}} applications in the agricultural fields against insects and nematodes, especially those from Clitoria ternatea.|$|E
2500|$|The Brooklyn Class {{design was}} a further {{refinement}} of the New Orleans Class Heavy Cruiser that preceded it. [...] The {{desire for the}} Brooklyns arose from the London Naval Treaty of 1930, which limited the construction of heavy cruisers, i.e., ships carrying guns with calibers between 6.1 inches and 8 inches. Great Britain needed trade control cruisers and hoped that the treaty would limit nations to smaller cruisers to a 6,000 to 8,000 ton range that she could afford. Agreement to the London Treaty and the proceeding with the American Light cruiser design can be focused to Admiral William V. Pratt who overrode the vehement objections of the General Board. Under the treaty the US was allowed 30,000 tons for heavy cruisers and 143,500 tons for light cruisers. The United States needed large cruisers {{to deal with the}} extreme ranges that operations in the Pacific Ocean required. Cruisers with 6" [...] guns and 10,000 tons were therefore desired. The US Navy's experience with the Omaha Class Cruiser was not all that could be hoped for. The light hull design caused a stressed hull and was very overweight. Design started in 1930, with the first four of the class ordered in 1933 and an additional three ships in 1934. <b>Basic</b> <b>criteria</b> had been that speed and range should match heavy cruisers and, when the Japanese Mogami-class cruisers carrying fifteen six-inch main guns appeared, the new U.S. ships would match their weaponry. Various combinations of armor and power plants were tried in the efforts to stay below the Treaty 10,000 ton limit. Aviation facilities were moved to the stern of the ship from the amidships position of the New Orleans Class cruisers.|$|E
