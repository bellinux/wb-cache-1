40|$|An {{active control}} method {{utilizing}} the multiple {{trailing edge flap}} configuration for rotorcraft vibration suppression and blade loads control is presented. A comprehensive model for <b>rotor</b> <b>blade</b> with active trailing edge flaps {{is used to calculate}} the vibration characteristics, natural frequencies and mode shapes of any complex composite helicopter <b>rotor</b> <b>blade.</b> A computer program is developed to calculate the system response, <b>rotor</b> <b>blade</b> root forces and moments under aerodynamic forcing conditions. <b>Rotor</b> <b>blade</b> system response is calculated using the proposed solution method and the developed program depending on any structural and aerodynamic properties of <b>rotor</b> <b>blades,</b> structural properties of trailing edge flaps and properties of trailing edge flap actuator inputs. <b>Rotor</b> <b>blade</b> loads are determined first on a nominal <b>rotor</b> <b>blade</b> without multiple active trailing edge flaps and then the effects of the active flap motions on the existing <b>rotor</b> <b>blade</b> loads are investigated. Multiple active trailing edge flaps are controlled by using open loop controllers to identify the effects of the actuator signal output properties such as frequency, amplitude and phase on the system response. Effects of using multiple trailing edge flaps on controlling <b>rotor</b> <b>blade</b> vibrations are investigated and some design criteria are determined for the design of trailing edge flap controller that will provide actuator signal outputs to minimize the <b>rotor</b> <b>blade</b> root loads. It is calculated that using the developed active trailing edge <b>rotor</b> <b>blade</b> model, helicopter <b>rotor</b> <b>blade</b> vibrations can be reduced up to 36 % of the nominal <b>rotor</b> <b>blade</b> vibrations...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{hydrodynamic}} forces imparted on a {{tidal turbine}} rotor, whilst {{causing it to}} rotate and hence generate power, will also cause the blades to deform. This deformation will affect the turbine's performance if {{not included in the}} early design phase and could lead to a decrease in power output and a reduction in operational life. Conversely, designing blades to allow them to deform slightly may reduce localised stress and therefore prolong the life of the blades and allow the blades to deform in to their optimum operational state. The aim {{of this paper is to}} better understand the kinetic energy extraction by varying the material modulus of a turbine blade. Shaft torque/power, blade tip displacement, and axial thrust results are presented for 2, 3 and 4 <b>bladed</b> <b>rotor</b> configurations at peak power extraction. For the rotor design studied the FSI model data show that there is a low sensitivity to blade deformation for the 2, 3 and 4 <b>bladed</b> <b>rotors.</b> However, the results reveal that the 3 <b>bladed</b> <b>rotor</b> displayed maximum hydrodynamic performance as a rigid structure which then decreased as the blade deformed. The 2 and 4 <b>bladed</b> <b>rotor</b> configurations elucidated a slight increase in hydrodynamic performance with deflection...|$|R

The wind speed that causes bending of the <b>rotor</b> <b>blades</b> exhibits a natural variability, and so does the stress response in the <b>rotor</b> <b>blades.</b> Also, the resistance of the <b>rotor</b> <b>blades,</b> in terms of their tensile strengths, exhibits a natural variability.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{compatibility}} {{between a}} composite beam cross-sectional analysis {{based on the}} variational asymptotic approach, and a helicopter <b>rotor</b> <b>blade</b> model {{which is part of}} a comprehensive rotorcraft analysis code is examined.

The new YF/VABS <b>rotor</b> <b>blade</b> model accounts for arbitrary cross-sectional warping, in-plane stresses, and moderate deflections. The YF/VABS composite <b>rotor</b> <b>blade</b> model was validated against experimental data and various <b>rotor</b> <b>blade</b> analyses by examining displacements and stresses under static loads, as well as aeroelastic stability of a composite <b>rotor</b> <b>blade</b> in hover, and forward flight vibratory hubloads of a four <b>bladed</b> composite <b>rotor...</b>|$|R
40|$|A {{cooperative}} program undertaken by {{organizations in the}} United States, England, France, and Australia has assessed {{the strengths and weaknesses}} of four lifting-line/wake methods and three CFD methods by comparing their predictions with the data obtained in flight trials of a research Puma. The Puma was tested in two configurations: a mixed <b>bladed</b> <b>rotor</b> with instrumented rectangular tip blades, and a configuration with four identical swept tip blades. The results are examined of the lifting-line predictions. The better lifting-line methods show good agreement with lift at the blade tip for the configuration with four swept tips; the moment is well predicted at 0. 92 R, but deteriorates outboard. The predictions for the mixed <b>bladed</b> <b>rotor</b> configuration range from fair to good. The lift prediction is better for the swept tip blade than for the rectangular tip blade, but the reasons for this cannot be determined because of the unmodeled effects of the mixed <b>bladed</b> <b>rotor...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{invention}} {{is directed}} to a damper ring for damping the natural vibration of the <b>rotor</b> <b>blades</b> of an integrally <b>bladed</b> rocket turbine <b>rotor.</b> The invention consists of an integral damper ring which is fixed to {{the underside of the}} <b>rotor</b> <b>blade</b> platform of a turbine rotor. The damper ring includes integral supports which extend radially outwardly therefrom. The supports are located adjacent to the base portion and directly under each <b>blade</b> of the <b>rotor.</b> Vibration damping is accomplished by action of tuned mass damper beams attached at each end to the supports. These beams vibrate at a predetermined frequency during operation. The vibration of the beams enforce a local node of zero vibratory amplitude at the interface between the supports and the beam. The vibration of the beams create forces upon the supports which forces are transmitted through the <b>rotor</b> <b>blade</b> mounting platform to the base of each <b>rotor</b> <b>blade.</b> When these forces attain a predetermined design frequency and magnitude and are directed {{to the base of the}} <b>rotor</b> <b>blades,</b> vibration of the <b>rotor</b> <b>blades</b> is effectively counteracted...|$|R
