25|$|Moore {{was born}} on February 13, 1922, in Bardstown, Kentucky, the eldest of four {{children}} born to Harold, Sr. and Mary (Crume) Moore. His father was an insurance agent whose territory covered western Kentucky {{and his mother was}} a homemaker. Because he was interested in obtaining an appointment to the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, New York and felt his chances were <b>better</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> was located in a larger city, he left Kentucky at the age of seventeen before finishing high school and got a job in Washington, D.C. working in the U.S. Senate book warehouse. Moore finished high school at night while working days and graduated from St. Joseph Preparatory School in Bardstown with the class of 1940. Moore attended George Washington University at night for two years, working at his warehouse job while waiting on an appointment to West Point. During his time at George Washington University he was initiated into the Kappa Sigma Fraternity. After President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed legislation authorizing each senator and representative additional appointments to the military and naval academies, Moore was offered an appointment to the United States Naval Academy by Representative Ed Creal (4th District, Kentucky) but Moore had no desire to go to the Naval Academy. Moore asked Creal if he could find another congressman that would trade his Military Academy appointment for Creal's Naval Academy appointment would he be agreeable to that arrangement. Creal agreed, and Moore soon found Representative Eugene Cox of Georgia's 2nd Congressional District, with an open appointment to West Point. Cox was impressed with Moore's tenacity and he left Cox's office with the West Point appointment.|$|E
500|$|In April 2006, actors Tom Sturridge, Teresa Palmer, and Jamie Bell {{were cast}} for Jumper with Sturridge {{in the lead}} role. The {{following}} July, actor Samuel L. Jackson was cast as an Rolan Cox, with producer Simon Kinberg rewriting the original screenplay draft by Goyer. Principal photography was scheduled {{to take place in}} Tokyo, Rome, Toronto, and New York. Production was stopped in June 2006 after producer Tom Rothman told Liman [...] "The lead is 18. Wouldn't the movie be <b>better</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> was 25? You have a huge movie here and adults won't go and see an 18-year-old. They'll consider it a children's movie. You could make a bigger movie than that." [...] Liman agreed on casting older actors for furthering the romantic aspect of the film. In August, actor Hayden Christensen replaced Sturridge in the lead role as David just two weeks before the beginning of shooting, as the studio [...] "became concerned about not having a more prominent actor in their trio of young stars." [...] After Christensen was recast for the lead role, Liman replaced Palmer with Rachel Bilson.|$|E
500|$|Various personalities {{paid tribute}} to Clark {{throughout}} the night on New Year's Eve; the New Year's Rockin' Eve broadcast featured special celebrity messages for Clark, and revelers in Times Square were seen with signs saluting Clark. During CNN's coverage, revelers in Times Square told CNN's Jason Carroll that Philbin was [...] "all right" [...] filling in for Clark (but still had Anderson Cooper and Carroll too). Mayor Michael Bloomberg also spoke with Philbin on Clark's absence during the show, noting that [...] "it isn't that we don't like Regis, but we want [...] back next year." [...] Philbin's hosting received mixed reviews: Richard Huff of the New York Daily News noted that Philbin's hosting was [...] "stiff" [...] at first, and suggested {{that he would have}} performed <b>better</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> had a co-host to interact with like his daytime talk show Live with Regis and Kelly. In conclusion, he considered Philbin's performance to be [...] "suitable – although not spectacular." [...] Virginia Heffernan of The New York Times believed that Philbin was feeling [...] "surprisingly nervous" [...] in his role at host, and felt that [...] "rowdy crowds" [...] (which Philbin chose to avoid by staying in the studio) and the success of Rod Stewart's career (which Philbin pounced on to promote his new album, [...] "When You're Smiling") were bothering him.|$|E

500|$|... "Amor Puro" [...] (Pure Love) is {{in a minor}} key with romantic lyrics, {{a string}} {{ensemble}} and techno synthesizers. Its lyrics focus {{on the meaning of}} true love. Queen sings: [...] "Pure love does not fight, it does not hurt you, love that is pure does not cause you to fall", and described the song as [...] "an honest statement of what love is". [...] "I Do" [...] is a minor-key, mid-tempo pop and R power ballad built on a handclapped rhythm and piano. Lyrically, the song is a message to men and women; Queen sings: [...] "My ladies, if you know <b>better,</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> loves you, let him come back. My fellas, if you love her, don't let nothing hold you back, run out and look for her". Queen recorded the song in English because she felt the language worked well with the beat. According to an editor for iTunes, the song [...] "puts her message of female empowerment into a glossy pop ballad, complete with English lyrics and Auto-Tuned vocal." [...] The minor-key [...] "Acércate" [...] (Get Closer) features vocals by Wisin & Yandel and synthesizers; it has been described as [...] "pure reggaeton". The song was praised for the presence of Wisin & Yandel and its hook. Queen previously collaborated with Wisin & Yandel on their seventh studio album, La Revolución (2009), with [...] "Perfecto" [...] (which also featured Yaviah).|$|E
500|$|... "The Field Where I Died" [...] {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews from critics. Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club gave [...] "The Field Where I Died" [...] a [...] "B+". He {{felt that it}} worked [...] "pretty well" [...] {{and there was a}} lot to appreciate about it, and while he noted that [...] "the episode isn't quite good enough for the conclusion to be as devastating as it should be", he still praised the tragic ending. However, he felt it not believable that Mulder quickly accepts his past lives and Melissa's part in it, and thought it would have worked <b>better</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> eased into believing it. Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a largely positive review and awarded it three-and-a-half stars out of four. She called the entry [...] "unabashedly emotional episode" [...] that is [...] "unafraid to plumb the depths of human loss and grief". Furthermore, Vitaris praised Cloke's acting; she called her [...] "a truly gifted actor, slipping faultlessly into the skin of all of Melissa's personalities." [...] She was, however, more critical of Duchovny, noting that his hypnosis scene was underacted. Sarah Stegall, in The Munchkyn Zone, gave the episode a 5 out 5 rating. Stegall wrote that while the episode is [...] "drowned in tears and soaked in muted sunlight, [...] teeters on the brink of sentimentality", it manages [...] "to stay just this side of it for a dynamite, gripping episode that showcases some fine actors".|$|E

2500|$|In {{keeping with}} these noble characteristics, Tarzan's {{philosophy}} embraces an extreme form of [...] "return to nature". Although {{he is able}} to pass within society as a civilized individual, he prefers to [...] "strip off the thin veneer of civilization", as Burroughs often puts it. His preferred dress is a knife and a loincloth of animal hide, his preferred abode is any convenient tree branch when he desires to sleep, and his favored food is raw meat, killed by himself; even <b>better</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> is able to bury it a week so that putrefaction has had a chance to tenderize it a bit.|$|E
2500|$|Over {{the final}} {{mountain}}s, Ullrich rode into second place behind Riis, but he conceded time on each mountain stage, eventually being nearly four minutes behind Riis. He won the final individual time trial and secured his first Tour stage win. He cut 2 minutes 18 seconds into Riis's lead [...] This led Indurain to comment that Ullrich {{would win the}} Tour some day, adding {{that it was a}} remarkable victory considering that Ullrich had been helping Riis. Ullrich dismissed suggestions he would have done <b>better</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> had not had to help Riis, saying Riis had inspired the team. Jan finished his first tour in second place at 1-minute 41 seconds from his teammate Bjarne Riis.|$|E
2500|$|During that time, {{she tries}} to {{convince}} Homer {{that it was the}} one thing that was missing because their lives would be miserable without Bart, Lisa and Maggie. He proved to be more unconvinced and more depressed after seeing that his life {{would have been a lot}} <b>better</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> had won, even leaping into the pot to try to [...] "live in the sauce". The saucier bashes him for his foolishness and saying if you could live in the sauce, then he would have jumped in himself. Marge convinces him to take a walk with her to the Springfield Wall of Fame. Eventually, he agrees and learns that his name has been put up. Marge reveals that she confronted Dondelinger and forced him to do the right thing. A boy then has his picture taken with him. Homer, now much happier, goes to a Korean restaurant that Bart says 'sells beef that spells the date of your death'.|$|E

2500|$|After his rescue, Jonah obeys {{the call}} to prophesy against Nineveh, causing {{the people of the}} city to repent and God to forgive them. Jonah is furious, however, and angrily tells God that this is the reason he tried to flee from Him, as he knew Him to be a just and merciful God. He then beseeches God to kill him, a request which is denied when God causes a tree to grow over him, giving him shade. Initially grateful, Jonah's anger returns the next day, when God sends a worm to eat the plant, {{withering}} it, and he tells God that it would be <b>better</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> were dead. God then points out: [...] "You are concerned about the bush, for which you did not labour and which you did not grow; it came into being in a night and perished in a night. And should I not be concerned about Nineveh, that great city, in which {{there are more than a}} hundred and twenty thousand people who do not know their right hand from their left, and also many animals?

2500|$|The papal nuncio, the Most Rev. Giovanni Tonucci, said at Father Kaiser’s {{funeral in}} the Nairobi basilica, [...] "The church, through pitiless violence, has once more been {{deprived}} {{of one of her}} ministers. Let no one have any doubts about it: we are celebrating a religious occasion; we are reflecting on a religious assassination, not a political one. Fr. Kaiser has been murdered because he was, and in the eternity of God still is, a Catholic priest who preached the Gospel. Those who killed him, those who planned his killing, wanted to silence the voice of the Gospel.... Only two days before his death, I met Fr. Kaiser for a long conversation. At the end, he asked my blessing, which I reluctantly gave him. At that moment, I thought it would have been <b>better</b> <b>if</b> <b>he,</b> an old and worthy missionary, had blessed me. How much more I am convinced of that now that we look at him as a martyr of the faith?". Also present at the altar was Maurice Cardinal Otunga, Archbishop Emeritus of Nairobi.|$|E
2500|$|Once Washington {{found out}} that Raguet had left Brazil, the State Department quickly worked to appoint someone new to repair any damage caused by Raguet and to {{continue}} working on solving the issues with Brazil that had led Raguet to leave. Adams would later write that relations between the United States and Brazil were [...] "aggravated by the rashness and intemperance of Condy Raguet, ... brought this country and Brazil to the very verge of war." [...] On Raguet's return to the United States he held a meeting with Clay and Adams who said [...] "I told him that my opinion of his integrity, patriotism, and zeal was unimpaired; that I was convinced of the purity of his motives to the step he had taken; but that I thought {{it would have been}} <b>better</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> had, before taking that step, consulted his government." [...] When Raguet was suggested for another ambassadorial position in 1828 Adams felt that while Raguet's motives were good he felt putting someone with [...] "such a temper and want of judgment, who took blustering for bravery and insolence for energy, was too dangerous." ...|$|E

Wanting to seduce Donna Elvira's maid, and believing that she will trust him <b>better</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> appears in lower-class clothes, Don Giovanni orders Leporello to exchange cloak and hat with him. Donna Elvira comes to her window (Trio: [...] "Ah taci, ingiusto core" [...] – [...] "Ah, be quiet unjust heart"). Seeing {{an opportunity for a}} game, Don Giovanni hides and sends Leporello out in the open wearing Don Giovanni's cloak and hat. From his hiding place Don Giovanni sings a promise of repentance, expressing a desire to return to her and threatening to kill himself if she does not take him back, while Leporello poses as Don Giovanni and tries to keep from laughing. Donna Elvira is convinced and descends to the street. Leporello, continuing to pose as Don Giovanni, leads her away to keep her occupied while Don Giovanni serenades her maid with his mandolin.

2500|$|They {{were three}} tour matches between {{the second and}} third Tests, in the second of these against Northamptonshire Taylor top scored with 116, his second century of the tour. The third match saw South Africa return to Edgbaston, this time against Warwickshire he top scored in both innings with 94 and 116. His good form {{continued}} into the third Test where he made scores of 59 not out and 56. He shared 54 and 99 run partnerships with Bob Catterall as South Africa averted a third consecutive innings defeat however they still lost by nine wickets. Rain affected the final two Tests of the series and both were drawn, Taylor scored 18 not out at Old Trafford and 11 at The Oval. His series total was 197 at 32.83. Wisden described the performance as 'disappointing' but commented: [...] "There {{can be no doubt that}} the anxiety of captaining a beaten team told upon him and that he would have done far <b>better</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> had had nothing to think about but his own batting." [...] In the tour as a whole he played in 34 first-class matches and scored 1,898 runs, marginally fewer than Dave Nourse but with a higher average of 42.17.|$|E
