40|$|Objectives: To deepen our {{understanding}} of the status quo and to identify the hot topics and developmental trends of research on nursing models in countries other than China in the most recent decade. Methods: The study subjects were the publications retrieved from the PubMed database using the MeSH terms of âModels, Nursingâ. <b>Bibliographic</b> <b>item</b> co-occurrence mining system (BICOMS) software was used for conventional bibliometric analysis of publications during two time periods, 2005 â 2009 and 2010 â 2014. The number of published journal articles, journal distribution, authors of publications, country of origin of journals, and language of publications were analyzed to establish a high-frequency keyword profile and co-occurrence matrix. Graphical clustering toolkit (gCLUTO) software was applied for two-way clustering analysis and visualized analysis. Results: A total of 1472 journal articles with a key theme of nursing models were retrieved for final analysis, including 771 published during 2005 â 2009 and 701 during 2010 â 2014. The bibliometric analysis revealed that publications other than China concerning nursing models were mostly concentrated in the United States and the United Kingdom and that the number of relevant publications has been continuously decreasing. The two-way clustering analysis showed that there were mainly four types of research themes in the relevant publications in countries other than China during 2005 â 2009, i. e., nursing education and theoretical research, clinical nursing and psychological care, nursing administration, and models of nursing education, whereas there were five types during 2010 â 2014, i. e., nursing theories and clinical nursing practice, nursing administration models and assessments of nurses' knowledge and skills, community nursing administration models, nursing human resource management, and nursing education models and approaches. Conclusions: Research on nursing models in countries other than China is relatively mature and stable with a broader view, but it has shown a declining trend in recent years. It emphasizes both theory and practice, with research content tending to be structured into four modules, i. e., nursing education, administration, clinical practice, and theoretical research. Community nursing models may become a key research direction in the international research on nursing models in the future...|$|E
40|$|JoÅ¡ za Å¾ivota MaruliÄ je bio svjetski poznat pisac i kao autoritet Äesto je citiran. Vjerojatno je zato ugledni propovjednik dominikanac Dominik BuÄa od njega zatraÅ¾io da papi izloÅ¾i teÅ¡ko stanje krÅ¡Äana i pogibli koje su, posebno nakon pada Beograda 1521., prijetile cijeloj Europi. Splitski mu je pisac udovoljio obrativÅ¡i se novoizabranom papi Hadrijanu VI. pismom, koje je tiskano u Rimu joÅ¡ prije papina ustoliÄenja. StupivÅ¡i na prijestolje, papa je u zamrÅ¡enim crkvenim i druÅ¡tveno-politiÄkim prilikama poduzimao razne korake (sukladne onima za koje se MaruliÄ zalagao), ali dosad je bilo otvoreno pitanje je li splitskom humanistu osobno odgovorio. PronaÄeni bibliografski podatci ukazuju da je postojao papin otpis (tiskan u Rimu), u kojem prema MaruliÄu izraÅ¾ava poÅ¡tovanje i dobrohotnost. DosadaÅ¡nja potraga za tekstom nije urodila plodom, pa se ovdje donose i analiziraju dostupne vijesti o njemu. TakoÄer se pokazuje da je kljuÄnu vezu izmeÄu dvaju korespondenata vjerojatno imao Toma Niger, MaruliÄev prijatelj, a papin izaslanik. Even {{during his}} lifetime, MaruliÄ {{was a writer}} with a {{worldwide}} reputation, and was often cited as an authority. It was probably {{for this reason that}} the Dominican preacher Dominik BuÄa asked him to lay before the pope the fraught condition of the Christians and the perils that, particularly after the fall of Belgrade in 1521, threatened the whole of Europe. Acceding to his request, the Split writer addressed the newly elected Pope Adrian VI a letter that was printed in Rome on April 30, 1522, even before the new popeâs enthronement. Ascending the papal throne, in the tangled ecclesiastical, social and political conditions of the time the pope took various steps (in line with those that MaruliÄ had urged),but it has been unclear so far whether he personally replied to the Split humanist. In this paper a newly found <b>bibliographic</b> <b>item</b> is discussed suggesting that such a reply really did exist. This clue is found in the second (H-M) volume of the bio-bibliographic lexicon of Antonio Possevino Apparatus sacer ad scriptores Veteris & Novi Testamenti, eorum interpretes, [ [...] . ] poetas sacros, libros pios, quocumque idiomate conscriptos (Venice, 1606). In this volume alone, more than two and a half thousand authors are discussed, among them, on pp. 385 - 386, Marko MaruliÄ. Possevino knows nothing of his life, but cites the fifteen editions of the De institutione, Evangelistarium, Quinquaginta parabolae. At the very beginning of this volume there is an article about Adrian VI: on p. 2, in the list of his works, Possevino among other things notes: Praeter alias vero insignes eius epistolas extant eae, quas scripsit ad Senatum Ciuitatis Bambergensis, atque ad singulos quosque Principes, & Ecclesiasticos Laicos eiusdem argumenti, sed praesertim ad Ducem Saxoniae Fredericum, in cuius ditione viuebat Germanici incendij fax Lutherus. Et aliam ad Marcum Marulum virum optimum, atque doctissimum plenam honoris, & erga illum beneuolentiae. Romae quoqe impressam. This information was repeated several times (with certain variations) in similar bio-bibliographic surveys (Henri-Louis de Chasteigner de la Rocheposay, Ludwig Jakob a S. Carolo, Giovanni Palazzi) Naturally, it might be thought that Possevino knew of MaruliÄâs letter to Adrian, but was confused as to who was sender and who was recipient. But the actual formulation of Possevino â the pope sent a letter to Â»the excellent and very learned manÂ«, a letter Â»full of respect and benevolence for himÂ« â would tend to suggest rather that the compiler of the lexicon was well informed (perhaps that he had the popeâs letter in his hands). The information that the letter to MaruliÄ was printed, in Rome itself (Romae quoque impressam), even aroused hope that an extant copy might be found. But unfortunately, research to date has not been productive. Pope Adrian VI probably knew of MaruliÄ. He could well have found out about the Split writer not only from his books but also from Thomas Niger, MaruliÄâs close friend. After the fall of Belgrade in 1521 the pope of the time, Leo X, had sent Niger to the court of Charles V, as a person of the highest rank in the European diplomatic world, to lobby for an anti-Ottoman war. Niger acquainted the newly elected and still unthroned Pope Adrian VI of the losses being suffered by the Christian people and the perils that loomed over the whole of Europe. It is perhaps for this mission that MaruliÄâs letter to Adrian VI was in great haste prepared and printed...|$|E

It currently represents the unified research framework of the EC approved SoReComJoint-IDP ([URL] conducted in collaboration with 13 Early Stage Researchers at the European PhD on Social Representations and Communication Research Centre and Multimedia Lab. Specific web-tools have been designed by de Rosa (including the on-line grid for the meta-theoretical analysis and the related web-inventories) implemented in the institutional website ([URL] currently in transition into a new digital platform, including the SoReComâA. S. de Rosaâ@-library (de Rosa, 2014 b, 2014 c, 2014 d, 2015 a). The analysis of our big data and metadata enables us to take stock of the scientific field developed in more than 50 years by mapping its development, the related research paradigmatic approaches and methods, the thematic areas and their impact on the various applied fields within the multi-generational community of scientists and across different geo-cultural contexts (de Rosa, A. S. 2015 b). Goal. Our goal is to discuss some aspects of global dissemination of the Social Representations Theory, presenting a selection of results visualized according to a technique designed ad hoc for geo-mapping the development and the dissemination of the theory across the continents (de Rosa, 2014 a), over several generations of scientists, and according to paradigmatic, geo-cultural and thematic foci. We shall share some of the comparative analyses based on âbig dataâ and âmeta-dataâ filed in our SoReComâA. S. de Rosaâ@-library repositories, concerning authorsâ countries and institutional affiliations, years of publication by decades, type of publication, thematic areas, language of publication, etc. This allows us to present: a) the geo-mapping of the wider scientific production in Social Representations (de Rosa, 2014 a) and comparative results with different types of publications; 1 In collaboration with the 13 SoReCom Joint IDP fellows: Carlos Miguel Aguilar Filiberto, Laura Arhiri, Filomena Berardi, Borja De Madeira, Teresa Forte, Mihaela Alexandra Gherman, Marija Adela Gjiorgjioska, Ioana Guraliuc, Maryia Kukharava, Gabriela Monica Panzaru, Agnese Pastorino, Aminat Ramazanova, Ana Tomicic ([URL] b) the dynamics of the knowledge epidemiology via the inter-institutional collaborations between authors belonging to institutions in different countries and continents: who works with whom, (on what) and where? c) the relevance of the crosscutting thematic choice for the publications Methods. The bibliographic sources of the empirical data used for our analyses were extracted from a larger number of 9930 SoReComâA. S. de Rosaâ@-library bibliographic references, of which 8888 items specifically related to social representations and communication (including also books, book chapters, conference presentations, web documents, manuscripts, university reports, Master and PhD theses, etc.) filed in the repositories of the SoReComâA. S. de Rosaâ@-Library as of March 3, 2015 (de Rosa, 2014 a, 2014 d, 2015 a, 2015 b). They have been analysed using the specific tool, the last version (v. 2014) of the Grid for meta-theoretical analysis developed by de Rosa that consists of five parts. In this presentation, we take into account data and meta-data based on its first part relevant to the âbibliographic itemâ. Results. Concerning the âtypeâ of the <b>bibliographic</b> <b>item,</b> the majority of production in social representations filed in the repositories of the SoReCom âA.

The related proposals are characterized by their simplicity and practicability, which independ of government decisions. The librarian, alone, can perform changes in his(her) routine, and in that way, to benefit his (her) userâs reading...|$|R

40|$|We {{study the}} growth rate of the summatory {{function}} of the MÃ¶bius function {{in the context of an}} algebraic curve over a finite field. Our work shows a strong resemblance to its number field counterpart, which was proved by Ng in 2004. We find an expression for a bound of the summatory function, which becomes sharp when the zeta zeros of the curve satisfy a certain linear independence property. Extending a result of Kowalski in 2008, we prove that most curves in the family of universal hyperelliptic curves satisfy this property. Then, we consider a certain geometric average of such bound in this family, using Katz and Sarnak's reformulation of the equidistribution theorem of Deligne. Lastly, we study an asymptotic behavior of this average as the family gets larger by evaluating the average values of powers of characteristic polynomials of random unitary symplectic matrices.

INID codes are used by patent offices {{worldwide}} for indicating specific <b>bibliographic</b> data <b>items</b> on the title pages of patents and patent application publications. INID codes use Arabic numerals, and so are language-independent. For example, number (30) indicates priority data, and (51) technical area according to the International Patent Classification (IPC).|$|R
