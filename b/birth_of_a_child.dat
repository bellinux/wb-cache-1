5|$|Stay-at-home dads are not {{prevalent}} in East Asian countries, which generally have strict traditional gender roles. However, {{a survey conducted}} in 2008 in Japan suggested that nearly one third of married men would accept the role. The Japanese government passed a law in April 1992 allowing time off following the <b>birth</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> for {{both male and female}} employees. In 1996, 0.16% of Japanese fathers took time off of work to raise children. In South Korea, about 5,000 men were stay-at-home dads in 2007. Even so, stay-at-home dads face discrimination from stay-at-home mothers, and are often ostracized.|$|E
25|$|During the <b>birth</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>child,</b> {{men were}} rarely present. Women from the {{neighbourhood}} or family would join {{in on the}} process of birth and assist in many different ways. The one position where men would help with the <b>birth</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> would be in the sitting position, usually when performed {{on the side of a}} bed to support the mother.|$|E

25|$|The {{substance}} of the Brahmana text varies with each Veda. For example, {{the first chapter of}} the Chandogya Brahmana, one of the oldest Brahmanas, includes eight ritual suktas (hymns) for the ceremony of marriage and rituals at the <b>birth</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>child.</b> The first hymn is a recitation that accompanies offering a Yajna oblation to Agni (fire) on the occasion of a marriage, and the hymn prays for prosperity of the couple getting married. The second hymn wishes for their long life, kind relatives, and a numerous progeny. The third hymn is a mutual marriage pledge, between the bride and groom, by which the two bind themselves to each other. The sixth through last hymns of the first chapter in Chandogya Brahmana are ritual celebrations on the <b>birth</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> and wishes for health, wealth, and prosperity with a profusion of cows and artha. However, these verses are incomplete expositions, and their complete context emerges only with the Samhita layer of text.|$|E
25|$|According to Pottermore, the Quill of Acceptance is {{a magical}} object which detects the <b>birth</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> with magical capabilities.

Professor McGonagall consults the book and sends out the {{subsequent}} Hogwarts acceptance letters by owl once the child turns eleven.

25|$|Folk dances are {{performed}} for every possible occasion, {{to celebrate the}} arrival of seasons, <b>birth</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>child,</b> a wedding and festivals. The dances are very focused on gestures, postures, and expressions. The dances burst with verve and vitality. Men and women perform some dances exclusively, while in some performances men and women dance together. On most occasions artists sing the main lyrics and are accompanied by instruments. Each form of dance has a specific costume. Most costumes are flamboyant with extensive jewels.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to these festivals, ceremonies marking rites of passage are also performed within the shrines. Two such ceremonies are the <b>birth</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> and the Shichi-Go-San. When a child is born they are brought to a shrine {{so that they can}} be initiated as a new believer and the kami can bless them and their future life. The Shichi-Go-San (the Seven-Five-Three) is a rite of passage for five-year-old boys and three- or seven-year-old girls. It is a time for these young children to personally offer thanks for the kami’s protection and to pray for continued health.|$|E
25|$|In 1952, Coffey {{returned}} {{to live in}} London and, from 1973, Southampton. He began again to publish his poetry and translations, mainly of French poetry. The first work in English to appear after this period of silence was Missouri Sequence, apparently begun in St. Louis but first appearing in the University Review in 1962. This poem deals {{with the experience of}} exile, memories of the poet's dead parents and the premature <b>birth</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>child.</b> It is written in a much more conventional syntax than most of Coffey's work and, thanks to this greater accessibility is one of his most widely read works.|$|E
25|$|From 3 December 2004 onwards, persons born {{outside of}} India {{shall not be}} {{considered}} citizens of India unless their birth is registered at an Indian diplomatic mission within one year of the date of birth. In certain circumstances {{it is possible to}} register after one year with the permission of the Central Government. The application for registration of the <b>birth</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> must be made to an Indian diplomatic mission and must be accompanied by an undertaking in writing from the parents of the child that he or she does not hold the passport of another country.|$|E

25|$|There {{were also}} further {{follow-up}} studies conducted {{using a different}} approach. In these follow-up studies the experimenters contacted certain individuals after foreseeable emotional experiences, such as the <b>birth</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>child,</b> giving blood, or taking an exam. This way, the experimenters chose not only the emotional event to be recalled, but furthermore the types of emotional events they would be studying {{so that they could}} examine possible differences between types of emotional events. The findings of these studies supported those of the retrospective studies: 96–100% of emotional events were socially shared. Furthermore, no significant difference was found in the frequency of social sharing between different types of emotional events.|$|E
25|$|Adolescence {{and early}} {{adulthood}} {{have been described}} as special times in memory encoding because individuals typically recall a disproportionate number of autobiographical memories from those periods. The reminiscence bump accounts for this disproportionate number of memories. The reminiscence bump typically occurs between 10 years of age and 30 years of age and is the period that individuals produce the most memories during free recall tasks. Research suggests that memories are easily accessible from the reminiscence bump because they are linked to self-identity. The memories found within the reminiscence bump significantly contribute to an individual's life goals, self-theories, attitudes, and beliefs. Additionally, life events that occur during the period of the reminiscence bump, such as graduation, marriage, or the <b>birth</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>child,</b> are often very novel, thus, making them more memorable.|$|E
25|$|Sea salt was {{a common}} {{condiment}} in ancient Hawaii, and Inamona, a relish made of roasted, mashed kukui nutmeats, sea salt and sometimes mixed with seaweeds, often accompanied the meals. At important occasions, a traditional feast, ‘aha‘aina, was held. When a woman was to have her first child, her husband started raising a pig for the ‘Aha‘aina Mawaewae feast that was celebrated for the <b>birth</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>child.</b> Besides the pig, mullet, shrimp, crab, seaweeds and taro leaves were required for the feast. The modern name for such feasts, lū‘au, was not used until 1856, replacing the Hawaiian words ‘aha‘aina and pā‘ina. The name lū‘au came from {{the name of a}} food always served at a ‘aha‘aina — young taro tops baked with coconut milk and chicken or octopus.|$|E

25|$|The {{loss of a}} {{significant}} person in one's life will typically initiate a grief response; in this situation, one might feel lonely, even while {{in the company of}} others. Loneliness may also occur after the <b>birth</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> (often expressed in postpartum depression), after marriage, or following any other socially disruptive event, such as moving from one's home town into an unfamiliar community, leading to homesickness. Loneliness can occur within unstable marriages or other close relationships of a similar nature, in which feelings present may include anger or resentment, or in which the feeling of love cannot be given or received. Loneliness may represent a dysfunction of communication, and can also result from places with low population densities in which there are comparatively few people to interact with. Loneliness can also be seen as a social phenomenon, capable of spreading like a disease. When one person in a group begins to feel lonely, this feeling can spread to others, increasing everybody's risk for feelings of loneliness. People can feel lonely even when they are surrounded by other people.|$|E
25|$|Magic {{texts and}} amulets attest by {{name to the}} {{prevalence}} of a belief in reproductive demons in the Greco-Roman world. During the Byzantine period, textual evidence of the child-harming demon is most often found in exorcisms or demonologies. Historian of ancient religion Sarah Iles Johnston suggests that this belief is expressed more commonly in earlier literature than has been noticed. The Homeric epics allude to the unmarried dead, who are excluded from the Underworld and might harm the living. In the Homeric Hymn to Demeter, Demeter {{in her role as}} a kourotrophic ("youth-nurturing") goddess promises to protect her hosts' infant from demonic attack in language that recalls known magical incantations. Centuries later, in Augustan Rome, Ovid describes the practice of protecting doorways with buckthorn after the <b>birth</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> to ward off striges, winged female demons who were thought to suck the blood of newborns. One of the twelve-and-a-half names of Gylo (see above) is Strigla, a form of the word strix as a kind of witch.|$|E
25|$|A Federal Education Grants Act {{was also}} introduced, which opened up better chances of higher {{education}} for low-income children. In addition, labor-protection and anti-trust laws were significantly strengthened, while from 1969 to 1975 alone some 140 laws were passed that entitled various socially disadvantaged groups to tax subsidies. During the mid-Seventies recession, eligibility for short-term unemployment benefits was extended from 6 to 12 months, and to 24 months in some cases. Active Labour Market Policies were substantially expanded, {{with the number of}} people benefiting from such schemes increasing from 1,600 in 1970 to 648,000 by 1975. In addition, the SPD-FDP government gave more priority to raising minimum housing standards. The Law on Nursing Homes and Homes for the Elderly (1974) sought to guarantee minimum standards in an important area of social services, while the Beratungshilfegesetz (Legal Advice Act) of 1980 strengthened the position of the indigent in need of out of court legal advice and representation. The Maternity Leave Act of 1979 permitted mothers in work to take leave of 6 months after the <b>birth</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>child,</b> granted a maternity allowance, and safeguarded jobs for 8 months.|$|E

The work performed by the microcytemia centers in screening and prophylaxis is described. The results <b>of</b> <b>a</b> screening program underway since 1967 involving 46, 559 students of the University of Rome are presented in detail. <b>A</b> preliminary survey <b>of</b> 256 families revealed that the incidence <b>of</b> subsequent <b>births</b> after the <b>births</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> affected by Cooley's anemia was generally low.
