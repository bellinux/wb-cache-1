40|$|International audienceBaby cry sound {{detection}} allows {{parents to}} be automatically alerted when their <b>baby</b> is <b>crying.</b> Current solutions in home environment ask for a client-server architecture where an end-node device streams the audio to a centralized server {{in charge of the}} detection. Even providing the best performances, these solutions raise power consumption and privacy issues. For these reasons, interest has recently grown in the community for methods which can run locally on battery-powered devices. This work presents a new set of features tailored to <b>baby</b> <b>cry</b> sound recognition, called hand crafted <b>baby</b> <b>cry</b> (HCBC) features. The proposed method is compared with a baseline using mel-frequency cepstrum coefficients (MFCCs) and a state-of-the-art convolutional neural network (CNN) system. HCBC features result to be on par with CNN, while requiring less computation effort and memory space at the cost of being application specific...|$|R

The system has inbuilt alarm that indicates two conditions – first when the mattress is wet, which is an important parameter to keep the baby in hygienic condition, second when baby does not stop crying with in a stipulated time, which intimated that baby needs attention. This system helps parents and nurses to take care of babies without physical attention...|$|R

Woody is shown the baby's crib and, after the parents leave the house, rushes to the refrigerator, makes some sandwiches, opens a few bottles of Coke, and settles down to enjoy the evening TV show in solid comfort. Just as he is completely relaxed and enjoying himself, he hears the <b>baby</b> <b>cry.</b> He opens his Baby-Sitters' Manual and ascertains that when the <b>baby</b> <b>cries,</b> you give him a bottle. He prepares the bottle, takes it to the crib, and, to his consternation, discovers that he is babysitting a baby gorilla.|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{assess the}} {{amplification}} and distortion of noise in incubators by measuring noise levels {{from various sources}} under various conditions. STUDY DESIGN: We recorded sound pressure levels (SPL) of background noise, <b>baby</b> <b>crying,</b> alarms and porthole closing with the incubator hood open or closed. Then we tried to reduce the sound level in the incubator by applying a sound absorbing panel to {{the ceiling of the}} hood. RESULTS: The sound sources analysed produced very high SPL. In free field <b>baby</b> <b>crying</b> and porthole noise were, respectively, 81 - 83 dB and 70 - 71 dB, closing the hood they raised to 84 - 87 and 73 - 74 dB: this means that the noise perceived by a baby in the incubator had twice the SPL of the same noise emitted in a free field; alarm noise was 56 - 57 dB inside incubators. Sound emitted inside the hood was also distorted, i. e. it had different features from the same source in a free field. The insulating panel prevented amplification and distortion due to the hood and reduced the SPL of alarms. Only background noise did not decrease with the panel. Sound absorbing panel reduced <b>baby's</b> <b>crying,</b> porthole noise and alarm noise SPL to 82 - 85, 70 - 71 and 50 - 51 dB, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Incubators are reverberating environments, which amplify the <b>baby's</b> <b>cry</b> and other noises produced inside the hood. The frequency components of noises are altered by the hood. The sound absorbing panel reduced this phenomenon...|$|R
