40|$|Glacier surge {{behaviour}} {{is characterized}} by multiyear, quasi-periodic changes in glacier geometry and ice flow. Various attempts have been done on modelling glacier surge behaviour. The focus of this research will be on land-terminating, hard-bedded, temperate glaciers (LHT-glaciers). Whereas the drainage system {{at the base of}} the glacier is thought to be the key element in the surge behaviour of those glaciers, developed models do not include a <b>basal</b> <b>drainage</b> model. The surges of LHT-glaciers are characterized by a sudden initiation and a sudden termination of the surge. This sudden on- and offset is assigned to switches in <b>basal</b> <b>drainage</b> system. Therefore, a description of the transformation of the <b>basal</b> <b>drainage</b> system during a surge cycle of LHT-glaciers is proposed. The proposed transformation is based on observations of the 1982 - 1983 surge of Variegated Glacier, Alaska. Despite the fact that models that are capable of simulating quasi-periodic behaviour related to basal frictional lubrication do not include a <b>basal</b> <b>drainage</b> model, building blocks of a <b>basal</b> <b>drainage</b> model for surging glaciers have been proposed for a long time. By means of translating the proposed transformation of the <b>basal</b> <b>drainage</b> system into those building blocks, a <b>basal</b> <b>drainage</b> model is constructed. The constructed <b>basal</b> <b>drainage</b> model is coupled to the ice mass continuity equation. By means of implementing the coupled model, it is shown that the model simulates the characteristic features of the surge cycle of LHT-glaciers.

40|$|Document embargo 26 / 03 / 2016. Meltwater {{drainage}} {{across the}} surface of the Greenland ice sheet (GrIS) is well constrained by measurements and modeling, yet despite its critical role, knowledge of its transit through the subglacial environment remains limited. Here we present a subglacial hydrological analysis of a land-terminating sector of the GrIS at unprecedented resolution that predicts the routing of surface-derived meltwater once it has entered the <b>basal</b> <b>drainage</b> system. Our analysis indicates the probable existence of small subglacial lakes that remain undetectable by methods using surface elevation change or radar techniques. Furthermore, the analysis suggests transient behavior with rapid switching of subglacial drainage between competing catchments driven by seasonal changes in the basal water pressure. Our findings provide a cautionary note that should be considered in studies that attempt to relate and infer future response from surface temperature, melt, and runoff from point measurements and/or modeling with measurements of proglacial discharge and ice dynamics.

(i) To present risk factors, clinical courses, and outcomes {{in different types}} of SAH patients with negative DSA findings; (ii) to explore the differences of basal vein between aSAH patients and NASAH patients; and (iii) to evaluate the value of repeated DSA for these patients. Methods. All SAH patients with negative initial DSA findings between 2013 and 2015 in our hospital were enrolled and were further categorized as perimesencephalic SAH (PMN-SAH) or nonperimesencephalic SAH (nPMN-SAH).

40|$|We use the Shreve {{hydraulic}} potential equation as {{a simplified}} approach to investigate potential subglacial lake locations and meltwater drainage pathways beneath the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets. We validate the method by demonstrating {{its ability to}} recall the locations of < 60 % of the known subglacial lakes beneath the Antarctic Ice Sheet. This is despite uncertainty in the ice-sheet bed elevation and our simplified modelling approach. However, we predict many more lakes than are observed. Hence we suggest that thousands of subglacial lakes remain to be found. Applying our technique to the Greenland Ice Sheet, where very few subglacial lakes have so far been observed, recalls 1607 potential lake locations, covering 1. 2 % of the bed. Our results will therefore provide suitable targets for geophysical surveys aimed at identifying lakes beneath Greenland. We also apply the technique to modelled past ice-sheet configurations and find that during deglaciation both ice sheets likely had more subglacial lakes at their beds. These lakes, inherited from past ice-sheet configurations, would not form under current surface conditions, but are able to persist, suggesting a retreating ice-sheet will have many more subglacial lakes than advancing ones. We also investigate subglacial drainage pathways of the present-day and former Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets. Key sectors of the ice sheets, such as the Siple Coast (Antarctica) and NE Greenland Ice Stream system, are suggested to have been susceptible to subglacial drainage switching. We discuss how our results impact our understanding of meltwater <b>drainage,</b> <b>basal</b> lubrication and ice-stream formation...|$|R
40|$|Whole or {{shredded}} {{scrap tyres}} are sometimes proposed {{as an alternative}} to conventional aggregates in landfill drainage systems.

Previous work has indicated that tyre drainage layers will remain effective under high stresses, but tests have in the main been restricted to small (< 100 mm) shred sizes. The use of coarser shreds or even whole tyres for landfill drainage systems may be advantageous as they are more economical to produce and may be less prone to clogging than smaller shreds. In this paper, the results of large scale (2 m diameter) tests to investigate the variation in hydraulic conductivity (permeability) with stress of 50 mm, 200 mm and 450 mm nominal size tyre shreds are compared with data from the literature for smaller size shreds and whole tyres.

By using {{a simple}} paramet erized model of thermomechanically coupled flow in cold ice sheets, {{together}} with a physically based sliding law which includes a description of <b>basal</b> <b>drainage,</b> we show that relationships between ice flux and ice thickness can realistically be multi-valued, and hence that hydraulically induced surges can occur.

This is consistent with various recent ideas concerning drainage under ice sheets, be it through a system of canals, a di stributed film or a subglacial aquifer. For confined flows, such as valley glaciers (e. g. Trapridge Glacier) or topographically constrained ice streams (e. g. Hudson Strait in the Laurentide ice sheet), which are underlain by sufficiently deformable sediment, we can expect thermally regulated surges to occur, while in a laterally unconfined drainage basin (such as that which flows into the Ross Ice Shel!), we might expect ice streams to develop. 1...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2001 Fast ice {{flow and}} {{unstable}} ice sheet behavior were characteristic {{features of the}} Lake Michigan Lobe of the southern Laurentide Ice Sheet. Such behavior may result from some combination of subglacial-sediment deformation and decoupled sliding at the ice-bed interface. Both mechanisms depend on high water pressure relative to ice pressure. Using the finite-difference groundwater modeling package MODFLOW we simulate groundwater flow along a 1, 040 km flowline, extending from the south shore of Lake Superior to the Mississippi River near Carbondale, Illinois. Model simulations indicate that subglacial aquifers were not capable of evacuating the estimated basal meltwater. A <b>basal</b> <b>drainage</b> system consisting of a distributed film or canal system, similar to systems hypothesized as underlying Ice Stream B, West Antarctic Ice Sheet, would transmit sufficient water to prevent basal water pressure from exceeding the ice overburden pressure.

40|$|Many {{explanations}} {{have been}} provided for variations of the spatial distribution and thickness of till sheets. This paper gives new insight into the architecture of a stratigraphically distinct till sheet {{as a function of}} the type of substratum and preadvance topography at a scale of similar to 10 km. This emphasises the sensitivity of the subglacial system to changes in the <b>basal</b> <b>drainage</b> conditions. The study area is the forefield of Slettjokull at the northern margin of the Myrdalsjokull ice cap, central south Iceland. Here, detailed lithostratigraphical and sedimento logical investigations, including mapping of the thickness for two till units, sediment logging, clast fabric and geotechnical measurements provide a basis for interpretations. The results show that the thickness of a stratigraphically distinct till sheet is directly correlated to the type of substratum. Where the substratum consists of sorted sediments the till is thin. Conversely, the till is thick where the substratum consists of till overlying sorted sediments. A sedimentological model is presented in which till thickness is tied to the variable hydraulic conditions experienced in a deforming subglacial bed. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. We {{investigate}} whether the recent slow-down of Whillans Ice Stream (WIS),West Antarctica, {{may lead to}} its complete stoppage in the near future, using a numerical model. Basal resistance to ice-stream motion is represented by a continuous till layer whose strength changes in response to basal melting and freezing. We implement a <b>basal</b> <b>drainage</b> system, which acts to hinder ice-stream stoppage through supply of extra water to {{those parts of the}} bed that are experiencing freezing. The ice module is a standard flowline model with parameterized key out-of-plane effects (Raymond, 1996). The most important result of our modeling effort is that we never obtained a slow-down that would not be followed by a complete stoppage within 5100 years. WIS slow-down can be avoided in the model if large basal water-input rates are assumed, to satisfy basal freezing. In com-parison, the tested perturbations inWISwidth andmass balance hada relatively small effect on the tendency of the simulated ice stream to slow down. These results underscore the need for more quantitative constraints on the efficiency of sub-ice-streamwater drainage. We con-jecture that the present-day slow-down of WIS will evolve to shut-down in the next few decades, unless an addition of basal water prevents freeze-on-driven bed strengthening. 1...|$|E
40|$|Here {{we report}} results of water {{pressure}} pulse studies conducted at Storglaciären (Sweden) and West Washmawapta Glacier (British Columbia, Canada). Comparison of pressure pulse records with meteorological conditions at Storglaciären indicates that several periods of increased basal slip activity observed during a 10 day interval of summer 2008 {{were due to}} precipitation loading of the glacier surface, rather than to infiltration of surface water to the glacier bed; this indicates that the glacier bed {{was close to the}} failure strength for much of this interval. Pressure pulse magnitudes for the two glaciers were well-fit by power law distributions similar to those earlier observed at Trapridge Glacier (and similar in form to the Gutenberg-Richter relationship commonly used in seismology), suggesting that the mechanical processes that give rise to these distributions are robust features of soft-bedded glaciers. In contrast, interevent time distributions for both glaciers diverge from those observed at Trapridge Glacier for short recurrence intervals, suggesting that the factors that govern the rate at which these processes occur differ between glaciers. An examination of pressure pulse characteristics at West Washmawapta Glacier indicates that the establishment of a <b>basal</b> <b>drainage</b> system in summer 2008 resulted in increased stability and reduced sensitivity to meltwater input, suggesting that common assumptions about the relationship between meltwater production and ice flow are oversimplified.

40|$|The Antarctic Ice Sheet {{influences}} the global temperature and sea level by complex {{interactions with the}} atmosphere and the ocean and is thus {{an important factor in}} the Earth's climate system. Recent climate assessments reveal a steady increase of global temperatures and an on-going shrinking of glaciers and ice sheets. Because the total Antarctic ice volume has the potential to raise the global sea level by about 58 meters, it is of particular interest to understand the ice dynamics regarding the mass export and thus the contribution to sea level rise. Observations of the last decades reveal a widespread hydrological system of subglacial lakes and drainage networks beneath the Antarctic Ice Sheet which is recognized to have a large impact on the ice dynamics. The aim of this thesis is to investigate this subglacial hydrological environment and its interactions with the ice flow dynamics of the overlying ice sheet. For reaching this aim, the ice flow model RIMBAY is enhanced by a subglacial hydrology module which provides the simulation of basal water flow and the identification of positions and extents of subglacial lakes. This model is then applied to the Antarctic Ice Sheet. A subsequent validation by the analysis of ice-penetrating radar profiles in Dronning Maud Land leads to the identification of 31 new potential subglacial lake locations. Based on these findings, the total number of Antarctic subglacial lakes is estimated to be 1300 Â± 300, a factor of three more than what has been discovered so far. Their overall extent is assessed to cover about 0. 6 % of the Antarctic ice-bed interface. Furthermore, strong correlations are found between modeled pathways of basal water flow and observed locations of ice streams. In a detailed investigation of the Ross Ice Streams at the Antarctic Siple Coast the local basal driver of fast ice flow is identified as water saturated and unconsolidated sediment. The assessment of the basal flow regime enables the simulation of <b>basal</b> <b>drainage</b> patterns which are clearly associated with current patterns of fast ice flow. The application of satellite-observed ice surface elevation changes to the present-day ice sheet geometry additionally allows prognostic water flow simulations. They reveal a high dynamic of basal water pathways. In particular, a major hydraulic tributary of the Kamb and Whillans Ice Stream is redirected towards the Bindschadler Ice Stream within the next 200 years, possibly resulting in future increase of ice velocities within the Bindschadler Ice Stream. In order to gain further insights into the complex feedback mechanisms between an ice sheet and its subglacial environment, ice dynamics and subglacial hydrology are modeled in a coupled approach for a synthetic domain. A new hydrological concept is developed and implemented in RIMBAY, providing the dynamic generation of subglacial lakes and covering the spatial and temporal variability of <b>basal</b> <b>drainage</b> systems. The impact of basal hydrology on the ice dynamic is estimated in various experiments, considering distinct feedback mechanisms. It is demonstrated, that a coupling at full complexity leads to a considerably negative mass balance of the investigated synthetic ice sheet. The results reveal the capabilities of the new hydrological concept and emphasize the necessity to incorporate subglacial hydrology in ice sheet models...|$|E

Landfill <b>basal</b> <b>drainage</b> systems are, however, subjected to large overburden stresses from the overlying waste, which may compress a tyre drainage layer reducing its porosity and hence it effectiveness. Previous work has indicated that tyre drainage layers will remain effective under high stresses, but tests have in the main been restrictred to small (< 100 mm) shred sizes. The use of coarser shreds or even whole tyres for landfill drainage systems may be advantageous as they are more economical to produce and may be less prone to clogging than smaller shreds. In this paper, the results of large-scale (2 m sample diameter) tests to investigate the compressibility of 50, 200 and 450 mm nominal-size tyre shreds are compared with data from the literature for smaller-size shreds and whole tyres. Tests were carried out at vertical stresses up to 600 kPa, representing landfill depths of up to about 60 m. Generally whole tyres and larger-size segments compress more in overall volume terms on initial loading than smaller size shreds. At vertical stresses greater than about 80 kPa, however, the differences on a graph of dry density or porosity plotted against vertical stress are much smaller. The proportion of voids that are not free-draining decreases with compression for whole tyres, as cup-like structures capable of retaining water flatten out. For tyre chips, the proportion of non-drainable voids increases with compression, suggesting that flow pathways are being lost. The dependence of the compressive behaviour of tyres and tyre chips on the particle shape is discussed, and the need for a more detailed and rigorous way of characterising particle size and shape is highlighted...|$|E
40|$|Assessment of landslide-triggering {{rainfall}} thresholds {{is useful}} for early warning in prone areas. In this paper, it is shown how stochastic rainfall models and hydrological and slope stability physically based models can be advantageously combined in a Monte Carlo simulation framework to generate virtually unlimited-length synthetic rainfall and related slope stability factor of safety data, exploiting {{the information contained in}} observed rainfall records and field-measurements of soil hydraulic and geotechnical parameters. The synthetic data set, dichotomized in triggering and non-triggering rainfall events, is analyzed by receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis to derive stochastic-input physically based thresholds that optimize the trade-off between correct and wrong predictions. Moreover, the specific modeling framework implemented in this work, based on hourly analysis, enables one to analyze the uncertainty related to variability of rainfall intensity within events and to past rainfall (antecedent rainfall). A specific focus is dedicated to the widely used power-law rainfall intensity–duration (I – D) thresholds. Results indicate that variability of intensity during rainfall events influences significantly rainfall intensity and duration associated with landslide triggering. Remarkably, when a time-variable rainfall-rate event is considered, the simulated triggering points may be separated with a very good approximation from the non-triggering ones by a I – D power-law equation, while a representation of rainfall as constant–intensity hyetographs globally leads to non-conservative results. This indicates that the I – D power-law equation is adequate to represent the triggering part due to transient infiltration produced by rainfall events of variable intensity and thus gives a physically based justification for this widely used threshold form, which provides results that are valid when landslide occurrence is mostly due to that part. These conditions are more likely to occur in hillslopes of low specific upslope contributing area, relatively high hydraulic conductivity and high critical wetness ratio. Otherwise, rainfall time history occurring before single rainfall events influences landslide triggering, determining whether a threshold based only on rainfall intensity and duration may be sufficient or it needs to be improved by the introduction of antecedent rainfall variables. Further analyses show that predictability of landslides decreases with soil depth, critical wetness ratio and the increase of vertical <b>basal</b> <b>drainage</b> (leakage) that occurs {{in the presence of a}} fractured bedrock...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2006 This {{dissertation}} {{concentrates on}} the controlling factors on the instability of the Laurentide Ice Sheet (LIS) and their effects on abrupt climate change. Northern Hemisphere climate fluctuated abruptly during the last deglaciation possibly related to variability in Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) and reduced aerial extent of the LIS. Reductions in AMOC can be induced by changes in the hydrologic cycle which in turn may be controlled by instabilities in the LIS due to subglacial hydrology, sliding and till deformation. Sedimentological observations of the Tiskilwa Till, Illinois, and Sky Pilot Till, Manitoba determined that the LIS deposited these tills in a ≤ 1 m thick deforming layer as strain migrated upwards due to till accretion. These tills experienced high strain in a deforming layer thick enough contribute to ice sheet motion. Simulations of the subglacial hydrology of the James Lobe (JL) of the LIS suggest that the JL had little affect on regional groundwater flow and that subglacial aquifers were incapable of draining meltwater from the ice-till interface. However, a canal <b>basal</b> <b>drainage</b> system with canals up to 70 cm wide spaced 40 to 70 m apart could drain the ice-till interface keeping the JL coupled to its bed. To resolve the effects of LIS retreat on the hydrologic cycle, a suite of new freshwater routing proxies indicate that western Canadian Plains freshwater was routed to the St. Lawrence {{at the start of}} the Younger Dryas with an increase in base flow discharge sufficient to reduce AMOC. These proxies identified a previously unrecognized intra-Younger Dryas routing event at 12 ka, the impact of which indicates the tight coupling of AMOC, climate and the hydrologic cycle. To determine the role of the LIS in Holocene climate change, 10 Be ages from western Quebec were used to date the final disappearance of the LIS at 6. 8 ka following a period of rapid retreat and thinning that contributed to a rapid rise in sea level. The disappearance of the LIS initiated the Holocene Thermal Maximum, while the attendant reduction in freshwater runoff induced the formation of Labrador deep sea water...|$|E
40|$|The Greenland Ice Sheet, {{which extends}} {{south of the}} Arctic Circle, is {{vulnerable}} to melt in a warming climate. Complete melt of the ice sheet would raise global sea level by about 7 meters. Prediction of how the ice sheet will react to climate change requires inputs {{with a high degree}} of spatial resolution and improved simulation of the ice-dynamical responses to evolving surface mass balance. No Greenland Ice Sheet model has yet met these requirements. A three-dimensional thermo-mechanical ice sheet model of Greenland was enhanced to address these challenges. First, it was modified to accept high-resolution surface mass balance forcings. Second, a parameterization for <b>basal</b> <b>drainage</b> (of the sort responsible for sustaining the Northeast Greenland Ice Stream) was incorporated into the model. The enhanced model was used to investigate the century to millennial-scale evolution of the Greenland Ice Sheet in response to persistent climate trends. During initial experiments, the mechanism of flow in the outlet glaciers was assumed to be independent of climate change, and the outlet glaciers' dominant behavior was to counteract changes in surface mass balance. Around much of the ice sheet, warming resulted in calving front retreat and reduction of total ice sheet discharge. Observations show, however, that the character of outlet glacier flow changes with the climate. The ice sheet model was further developed to simulate observed dynamical responses of Greenland's outlet glaciers. A phenomenological description of the relation between outlet glacier discharge and surface mass balance was calibrated against recent observations. This model was used to investigate the ice sheet's response to a hypothesized 21 st century warming trend. Enhanced discharge accounted for a 60 % increase in Greenland mass loss, resulting in a net sea level increment of 7. 3 cm by year 2100. By this time, the average surface mass balance had become negative, and widespread marginal thinning had caused 30 % of historically active calving fronts to retreat. Mass losses persisted throughout the century due to flow of dynamically responsive outlets capable of sustaining high calving rates. Thinning in these areas propagated upstream into higher elevation catchments. Large drainage basins with low-lying outlets, especially those along Greenland's west coast and those fed by the Northeast Greenland Ice Stream, were most susceptible to dynamic mass loss in the 21 st centur...|$|E
40|$|Fill {{and draw}} is a {{flushing}} technique {{that may be}} used to help remove contaminants from landfilled waste and, in so doing, accelerate the remediation of landfill sites. A simple fill and draw technique involves saturating in situ waste from the bottom up with water and then, normally following a pause, draining the landfill. In this way, soluble and diffusive contaminants can effectively be recovered from the waste mass. Repeating this process will sequentially reduce the masses of contaminants. This report describes a large-scale fill and draw tracer test that was performed in a 25 000 tonne test cell at a landfill in Landgraaf (The Netherlands), which contained a ~ 2. 5 m saturated zone at its base. Hydrogeological tracers were mixed with 800 m 3 water and introduced into the <b>basal</b> <b>drainage</b> system of the landfill test cell over a period of 17 days. 69 kg of bromide (in the form of potassium bromide) and 0. 56 kg of Rhodamine WT (RWT) were evenly mixed with the water and injected at a constant rate of 2 m 3 /hour through three slotted drains equally spaced across the base of the test cell. Towards the end of the injection phase, 0. 45 kg of Li was also added to the tracer mix to help assess the properties of the test cell’s basal sand layer. After a 3 day pause the injected water and tracer was then pumped from the cell using the same infrastructure that was used to introduce it. The tracer breakthrough data and the analysis of contaminants recovered from the waste during pumping were used to determine a number of important contaminant transport processes. Abstraction of the injected tracer occurred over two periods of constant pumping separated by a 40 day pause. The initial abstraction of 555 m 3 over a period of 26 days occurred at an average rate of 0. 9 m 3 /hr. The second 53 day phase removed a further 543 m 3 of leachate at an average rate of 0. 5 m 3 /hr. Drainage was from the three basal drains, with flow rates controlled manually. During abstraction, samples were collected from each drain, and from the combined discharge. An inline fluorometer, installed in the discharge, was also used to monitor the tracer return. Leachate heads were measured in fully-screened wells and piezometers with discrete response zones. By the end of injection, the leachate table had been raised by ~ 2. 2 m. The wells and piezometers were also used to collect water samples, before and throughout the tracer test. Average leachate levels {{at the end of the}} test were returned to starting conditions (i. e. ~ 2. 5 m saturated depth). Water samples were analysed in the laboratory for a wide range of parameters, including the introduced tracers Br, Li and RWT, and indigenous leachate contaminants including chloride, ammonia, electrical conductivity and dissolved organic carbon. The mass recovery of the bromide was between 61 - 83 %. The concentration of bromide measured in the piezometers with a deeper response zone (i. e. those nearer the base of the test cell), showed a higher peak during injection period than the shallower piezometers. The deeper piezometers also maintained higher concentrations of tracer at the end of the test than those with a shallower response zone. An inverse response was seen in the analysis of indigenous contaminants (including ammonia and chloride). In general, deep piezometers showed a more significant change in concentration than the shallower piezometers. Contaminant transport parameters for the waste were recovered from model fits to the introduced tracers Br and Li, and to indigenous contaminants Cl and NH 4. The tracer Li was mainly used to characterise the influence of the basal sand layer. A simple 1 D, two-porosity advection diffusion model (DP-Pulse) was used to provide a ‘first approximation’ fit to the data. Both the tracers and the indigenous contaminants fit the model well, suggesting that despite the complexity of the system, a simple conceptualisation is sufficient for estimating bulk contaminant flushing parameters. The results for Br and Cl, return extremely high values of tcb (the characteristic diffusion time of an immobile block of waste), in excess of 500 days. This may indicate that there are either large sections of the waste which are isolated from the flow, or that there are highly-localised preferential flow paths. The recovered values of tcb, indicate that the characteristic dimension of the immobile blocks is at least 20 cm and possibly greater than 60 cm. The block diffusion time for NH 4, was two orders of magnitude lower than for the other species, which may indicate that the spatial distribution of ammonia was a lot more varied than Cl. The results of this trial demonstrate the viability of the ‘fill and draw’ concept using the basal leachate drainage system of (hydrogeologically suitability) landfills as a potential accelerated landfill remediation technique. The models that have been developed will form the basis of future design tools. Further work is required to assess the efficiency of this modus operandi versus other landfill flushing techniques...|$|E
