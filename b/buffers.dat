5|$|There are {{few or no}} {{riparian}} <b>buffers</b> along Mud Creek {{where it}} flows through agricultural land. However, the Montour County Natural Areas Inventory has recommended restoring the riparian <b>buffers</b> in Derry Township. A wet meadow is located along the creek north of Washingtonville. Plant types typically found in wet meadows include various ferns, sedges, grasses, and red maples. Mud Creek is designated as a warm-water fishery.|$|E
5|$|MacPaint uses two offscreen memory <b>buffers</b> {{to avoid}} flicker when {{dragging}} shapes or images across the screen. One of these <b>buffers</b> contained the existing pixels of a document, {{and the other}} contained the pixels of its previous state. The second buffer {{was used as the}} basis of the software's undo feature. In April 1983, the software's name was changed from MacSketch to MacPaint. The original MacPaint was programmed as a single-document interface. The palette positions and sizes were unalterable, as was the document window. This was different from other Macintosh software at the time, which allowed the users to move windows and resize them.|$|E
40|$|Traditional integer order <b>buffer</b> {{operator}} {{is extended}} to fractional order <b>buffer</b> operator, the corresponding {{relationship between the}} weakening <b>buffer</b> operator and the strengthening <b>buffer</b> operator is revealed. Fractional order <b>buffer</b> operator not only can generalize the weakening <b>buffer</b> operator and the strengthening <b>buffer</b> operator, but also realize tiny adjustment of <b>buffer</b> effect. The effectiveness of GM(1, 1) with the fractional order <b>buffer</b> operator is validated by six cases...|$|R
50|$|A stencil <b>buffer</b> is {{an extra}} <b>buffer,</b> in {{addition}} to the color <b>buffer</b> and depth <b>buffer</b> (z-buffering) found on modern graphics hardware. The <b>buffer</b> is per pixel, and works on integer values, usually with a depth of one byte per pixel. The depth <b>buffer</b> and stencil <b>buffer</b> often share the same area in the RAM of the graphics hardware.|$|R
50|$|The terms <b>buffer</b> {{underrun}} and <b>buffer</b> underflow {{are also}} used to mean <b>buffer</b> underwrite, a condition similar to <b>buffer</b> overflow, but where the program is tricked into writing {{before the beginning of}} the <b>buffer,</b> overriding potential data there, like permission bits.|$|R
5|$|On 8 January 1991, {{two people}} were killed and {{hundreds}} were injured when an electric multiple unit failed to stop on a dead-end platform and collided with the <b>buffers.</b>|$|E
5|$|Rollingstock in Victoria {{has used}} air braking since tests of {{continuous}} train brakes {{were carried out}} in 1884. Initially screw couplings were used to connect wagons, but from 1924 automatic knuckle couplers were introduced, with <b>buffers</b> removed from freight wagons by 1960.|$|E
5|$|The Fishing Creek Sportsmans' Association has {{proposed}} a number of methods to conserve Fishing Creek and its tributaries. These include planting riparian <b>buffers,</b> eliminating leaky septic systems, and protecting the area from hydraulic fracturing.|$|E
50|$|<b>Buffer's</b> fame has reunited {{him with}} long-lost family members. In 1989, <b>Buffer</b> was {{contacted}} by his birth-father, who introduced <b>Buffer</b> to <b>Buffer's</b> half-brothers after having seen him on television. In the mid-1990s, <b>Buffer</b> brought {{on one of}} his half-brothers, Bruce <b>Buffer,</b> as his agent/manager. This grew into a business partnership to increase licensing productivity of the trademark.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we address}} the problem of {{minimizing}} <b>buffer</b> storage requirement in <b>buffer</b> binding for SDF (Synchronous Dataflow) graphs. First, we propose a new two-port FIFO <b>buffer</b> structure that can be efficiently shared by two producer/consumer pairs. Then we propose a <b>buffer</b> binding algorithm based on this two-port <b>buffer</b> structure for minimizing the <b>buffer</b> size requirement. Experimental results demonstrate 9. 8 %~ 37. 8 % improvement in <b>buffer</b> requirement compared to the conventional approaches...|$|R

5|$|Each {{background}} processor {{consisted of}} a computation section, a control section and local memory. The computation section performed 64-bit scalar, floating point and vector arithmetic. The control section provided instruction <b>buffers,</b> memory management functions, and a real-time clock. 16 kwords (128 kbytes) of high-speed local memory was incorporated into each background processor for use as temporary scratch memory.|$|E
5|$|On 9 August 1920, a {{passenger}} train {{collided with the}} <b>buffers.</b> Two people were injured. The following year, {{a passenger}} train was being shunted into a platform and collided with three luggage vans already occupying the line. A carriage was derailed and a luggage van was wrecked.|$|E
5|$|The {{area in the}} {{vicinity}} of Keyser Creek has experienced habitat loss due to abandoned mine impacts. What remains of the creek's riparian buffer in some reaches is overrun with invasive plants. The understory in the creek's riparian area is covered in knotweed. However, some reaches have riparian <b>buffers</b> containing red maple, silver maple, and river birch.|$|E
50|$|Typically Stencil <b>buffer</b> is {{initialized}} {{by setting}} depth <b>buffer</b> and color <b>buffer</b> masks to false. and then setting appropriate ref value to stencil <b>buffer</b> by failing the stencil test every time.|$|R
25|$|In {{computer}} security and programming, a <b>buffer</b> overflow, or <b>buffer</b> overrun, is an anomaly where a program, while writing data to a <b>buffer,</b> overruns the <b>buffer's</b> boundary and overwrites adjacent memory locations.|$|R
25|$|A <b>buffer</b> {{overflow}} {{occurs when}} data written to a <b>buffer</b> also corrupts data values in memory addresses {{adjacent to the}} destination <b>buffer</b> due to insufficient bounds checking. This can occur when copying data from one <b>buffer</b> to another without first checking that the data fits within the destination <b>buffer.</b>|$|R
5|$|Abrahams Creek has a {{watershed}} association {{known as the}} Abrahams Creek Watershed Association. It was awarded the Watershed Stewardship Award by the Luzerne Conservation District in 2009. The organization also received a $5000 grand from American Water for improving water quality, adding riparian <b>buffers,</b> and other projects. Damaging flooding in 2006 caused the Abrahams Creek Watershed Assessment and Project Prioritization to be created. The creek {{was used as a}} reference watershed by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection when developing a total maximum daily load for the nearby Solomon Creek.|$|E
5|$|Halo 3 {{does not}} {{natively}} render at true HD resolution (at least 720 lines of vertical resolution). In a Bungie Weekly Update, it was {{confirmed that the}} game renders at 1152×640 resolution instead of the usual 1280×720 (HD) resolution that most Xbox 360 games use. This is because Halo 3 uses two frame <b>buffers</b> instead of the usual one, so the lower resolution allowed Bungie to preserve as much of the dynamic range as possible for the game's lighting without adversely affecting the frame rate. The image can be upscaled to 1080p by the Xbox 360.|$|E
5|$|LOOC {{transferred}} {{the ownership of}} the Olympic venues in Lillehammer to the municipality for NOK1 million on 7 September 1993. By then the government had increased the post-Olympic fund to NOK200 million. Ownership of the Hamar and Gjøvik venues had previously been transferred to the respective municipal governments. The fund was established in September and is managed by a separate foundation, Stiftelsen Lillehammer Etterbruksfond. Additional capital for the fund was secured through LOOC's financial <b>buffers</b> not being used and the surplus transferred to the funds. In June 1994 the fund was set to NOK401.3 million.|$|E
50|$|Desalting and <b>buffer</b> {{exchange}} both entail recovering {{the components}} of a sample in whatever <b>buffer</b> is used to pre-equilibrate the small, porous polymer beads (resin). Desalting occurs when <b>buffer</b> salts and other small molecules are removed from a sample in exchange for water (with the resin being pre-equilibrated in water). <b>Buffer</b> exchange occurs when the <b>buffer</b> salts in a sample are exchanged for those in another <b>buffer.</b>|$|R
50|$|A <b>buffer</b> {{amplifier}} (sometimes simply {{called a}} <b>buffer)</b> {{is one that}} provides electrical impedance transformation from one circuit to another, {{with the aim of}} preventing the signal source from being affected by whatever currents (or voltages, for a current <b>buffer)</b> that the load may produce. The signal is 'buffered from' load currents. Two main types of <b>buffer</b> exist: the voltage <b>buffer</b> and the current <b>buffer.</b>|$|R
50|$|The useful {{property}} of a circular <b>buffer</b> {{is that it}} does not need to have its elements shuffled around when one is consumed.(If a non-circular <b>buffer</b> were used then it would be necessary to shift all elements when one is consumed.)In other words, the circular <b>buffer</b> is well-suited as a FIFO <b>buffer</b> while a standard, non-circular <b>buffer</b> is well suited as a LIFO <b>buffer.</b>|$|R
5|$|To protect Rome's eastern territories {{from the}} Parthian Empire, Augustus {{relied on the}} client states of the east to act as {{territorial}} <b>buffers</b> and areas that could raise their own troops for defense. To ensure security of the Empire's eastern flank, Augustus stationed a Roman army in Syria, while his skilled stepson Tiberius negotiated with the Parthians as Rome's diplomat to the East. Tiberius was responsible for restoring Tigranes V to the throne of the Kingdom of Armenia.|$|E
5|$|USB2.0 {{added two}} {{additional}} handshake packets: NYET and ERR. NYET {{indicates that a}} split transaction is not yet complete, while ERR handshake indicates that a split transaction failed. A second use for a NYET packet is to tell the host that the device has accepted a data packet, but cannot accept any more due to full <b>buffers.</b> This allows a host to switch to sending small PING tokens to inquire about the device's readiness, rather than sending an entire unwanted DATA packet just to elicit a NAK.|$|E
5|$|Aspirin {{has been}} shown to have at least three {{additional}} modes of action. It uncouples oxidative phosphorylation in cartilaginous (and hepatic) mitochondria, by diffusing from the inner membrane space as a proton carrier back into the mitochondrial matrix, where it ionizes once again to release protons. Aspirin <b>buffers</b> and transports the protons. When high doses are given, it may actually cause fever, owing to the heat released from the electron transport chain, as opposed to the antipyretic action of aspirin seen with lower doses. In addition, aspirin induces the formation of NO-radicals in the body, which have been shown in mice to have an independent mechanism of reducing inflammation. This reduced leukocyte adhesion is an important step in the immune response to infection; however, evidence is insufficient to show aspirin helps to fight infection. More recent data also suggest salicylic acid and its derivatives modulate signaling through NF-κB. NF-κB, a transcription factor complex, plays a central role in many biological processes, including inflammation.|$|E
50|$|A {{non-linear}} <b>buffer</b> amplifier {{is sometimes}} used in digital circuits where a high current is required, perhaps for driving more gates than the normal fan-out of the logic family used, or for driving displays, or long wires, or other difficult loads. It {{is common for}} a single package to contain several discrete <b>buffer</b> amplifiers. For example, a hex <b>buffer</b> is a single package containing 6 discrete <b>buffer</b> amplifiers, and an octal <b>buffer</b> is a single package containing 8 discrete <b>buffer</b> amplifiers. The terms inverting <b>buffer</b> and non-inverting <b>buffer</b> effectively correspond with high-current capability single-input NOR or OR gates respectively.|$|R
5000|$|In {{wormhole}} switching, each <b>buffer</b> {{is either}} idle, or allocated to one packet. A header flit {{can be forwarded}} to a <b>buffer</b> if this <b>buffer</b> is idle. This allocates the <b>buffer</b> to the packet. A body or trailer flit can be forwarded to a <b>buffer</b> if this <b>buffer</b> is allocated to its packet and is not full. The last flit frees the <b>buffer.</b> If the header flit is blocked in the network, the <b>buffer</b> fills up, and once full, no more flits can be sent: this effect is called [...] "back-pressure" [...] and can be propagated back to the source.|$|R
50|$|The Bip <b>Buffer</b> (bipartite <b>buffer)</b> is {{very similar}} to a {{circular}} <b>buffer,</b> except it always returns contiguous blocks which can be variable length. This offers nearly all the efficiency advantages of a circular <b>buffer</b> while maintaining the ability for the <b>buffer</b> to be used in APIs that only accept contiguous blocks.|$|R
5|$|Nature’s Plan For Parkways - Recreational Lands was {{published}} in 1932 and proposed a regional plan that would place Darby and Cobbs Creeks in an interior network of parks. These streams were chosen {{due to the fact}} that the flowed through some of the most densely populated areas in Southeastern Pennsylvania and it could serve as <b>buffers</b> through urban areas. During the 1930s there were a number of projects undertaken on Darby Creek by the Army Corps of Engineers. The dikes along the southern end of the creek were repaired by a joint force of the Works Progress Administration, the Pennsylvania legislature, and Delaware County. A series of ditches in the Tinicum marshland were constructed by the Corps in 1935 as a means of mosquito control. The dredged material was deposited throughout the marsh over the next few years.|$|E
5|$|Nescopeck Creek is home {{to brown}} trout and brook trout near its source, but does not have much life further {{downstream}} because coal mine waste in Little Nescopeck Creek pollutes the lower reaches of Nesocpeck Creek. In 1999, a study discovered 20 species of fish living in the Nescopeck Creek watershed. Of these, 15 had been observed before in the watershed, and five had not. Nesopeck Creek and its various tributaries are rated Class A to Class D for wild trout. There {{are a number of}} riparian <b>buffers</b> on Nescopeck Creek, of which 80percent consist of forest. Along parts of Nescopeck Creek, there are a large number of shrub-like oak trees. In the Nescopeck Creek watershed, there are prolific forests of oak, chestnut, and hemlock trees.|$|E
5|$|Royton {{railway station}} {{lay at the}} end of a branch from Royton Junction on the Oldham Loop Line, which was part of the route which {{connected}} Manchester, Oldham and Rochdale. The station was opened in 1864 and closed in April 1966. It featured steep gradients on the line up to Royton Junction, which, in October 1908, caused an accident when a goods train ran out of control on the gradient down to the station, killing a fireman. In February 1961, a four-coach runaway train crashed through the <b>buffers</b> at Royton railway station and continued on over High Barn Street. Five houses were damaged. The driver of the train was injured, but there were no fatal or severe injuries to the public. Five people from the damaged houses were taken to hospital suffering from shock and bruises, and in one case a fractured clavicle.|$|E
