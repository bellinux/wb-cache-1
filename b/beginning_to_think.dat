25|$|<b>Beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> he was {{indispensable}} at Radio 1, {{the first}} big falling-out with management came in December 1995 after taking his crew out on a 17-hour pub-crawl which ended two hours before they were due on air: Evans was fined one day's pay, £7,000. In 1996, broadcasting watchdogs investigated a continual trail of complaints against the show: Radio 1 refused to comment, Evans never said sorry. Evans also made increasing public demands of the Radio 1 management: after taking an extra week of unplanned holiday, Evans chose to turn up half an hour late for his 06:30 show and then demanded that his hours were changed {{so that it was}} a permanent fixture – this request was accepted.|$|E

Richardson had previously shot the [...] "Cake Like Lady Gaga" [...] snippet video, featuring the singer playing with cake. He had been wanting to do music videos for some time, and started {{his work in the}} medium with the video for Miley Cyrus' single [...] "Wrecking Ball" [...] and Beyoncé's [...] "XO". After her provocative performance of the song on Saturday Night Live, many interviewers had questioned Gaga regarding her chemistry with Kelly, leading the singer to tweet the following message: [...] "Many interviewers quelped today about my 'SHOCKING' performance w/ R Kelly on SNL I'm <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> y'all aren't ready for the video." ...|$|E
500|$|Verdi said of Puccini, {{early in}} the latter's career, that [...] "the symphonic element dominates in him", and Gianni Schicchi has been {{compared}} by later analysts {{to that of the}} final presto movement of a three-movement symphony. With the fast-moving pace of the work, the set pieces are given a simpler melodic structure than those in the other two parts of the triptych. On stage, with the commedia dell'arte references, a humorous atmosphere is established from the very beginning. However, the music itself is of the 20th century; Edward Greenfield refers to its [...] "dissonant modernity", with simultaneous clashing chords suggesting that [...] "Puccini was <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> in bi-tonal terms". Alongside these dissonant passages are others which opera scholar Julian Budden calls [...] "bland, schoolroom diatonism".|$|E

500|$|Among {{the less}} {{favorable}} contemporary critiques, a Melody Maker reviewer dismissed the album as [...] "Not typical Byrds music, which is rather a pity." [...] Writing in Crawdaddy! {{just before he}} withdrew from city life and temporarily retired from music journalism, Paul Williams lamented: [...] "I'm <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> I'll have to make this jailbreak unaided … The Byrds have gone country and Big Pink is out, and it's beautiful stuff, man, beautiful … But country is just more relaxation, wonderful stifling inertia … and I guess this isn't the summer to look to be rescued by music." [...] Robert Shelton of The New York Times similarly commented that [...] "The latest Byrds album adheres {{to most of the}} 'rules of the game' about country sound, and yet, sad to say, to this old fan of the Byrds, the album is a distinguished bore." ...|$|E
500|$|After the {{evacuation}} of Dunkirk, people believed that the threatened invasion could come at almost any time. Churchill was at times personally pessimistic about Britain's chances for victory, telling Hastings Ismay on 12 June 1940 that [...] "ou and I will be dead in three months' time". German preparations would require {{at least a few}} weeks, but all defensive precautions were made with an extreme sense of urgency. In mid-1940, an invasion attempt could have occurred at any time, but some times were more likely than others: the phase of the moon, the tides and, most of all, the weather were considerations. The weather usually deteriorates significantly after September, but an October landing was not out of the question. On 3 October, General Brooke wrote in his diary: [...] "Still no invasion! I am <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> that the Germans may after all not attempt it. And yet! I have the horrid thought that he may still bring off some surprise on us." ...|$|E
500|$|In mid-October 1965, the Beatles {{entered the}} {{recording}} studio; {{for the first}} time when making an album, they had an extended period without other major commitments. Until this time, according to George Martin, [...] "we had been making albums rather like a collection of singles. Now we were really <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> about albums as a bit of art on their own." [...] Released in December, Rubber Soul was hailed by critics as a major step forward in the maturity and complexity of the band's music. Their thematic reach was beginning to expand as they embraced deeper aspects of romance and philosophy. Biographers Peter Brown and Steven Gaines attribute the new musical direction to [...] "the Beatles' now habitual use of marijuana", an assertion confirmed by the band – Lennon referred to it as [...] "the pot album", and Starr said: [...] "Grass was really influential in a lot of our changes, especially with the writers. And because they were writing different material, we were playing differently." [...] After Help!s foray into the world of classical music with flutes and strings, Harrison's introduction of a sitar on [...] "Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)" [...] marked a further progression outside the traditional boundaries of popular music. As their lyrics grew more artful, fans began to study them for deeper meaning. Of [...] "Norwegian Wood" [...] Lennon commented: [...] "I was trying to be sophisticated in writing about an affair... but in such a smokescreen way that you couldn't tell." ...|$|E

500|$|Peter Lavezzoli, {{author of}} The Dawn of Indian Music in the West, has written of Harrison's first solo single: [...] "'My Sweet Lord' was {{everything}} that {{people wanted to}} hear in November 1970: shimmering harmonies, lustrous acoustic guitars, a solid Ringo Starr backbeat, and an exquisite [...] guitar solo." [...] Reviewing the single for Rolling Stone, Jon Landau called the track [...] "sensational". In an era when songs by Radha Krishna Temple and adaptations of the Christian hymns [...] "Oh Happy Day" [...] and [...] "Amazing Grace" [...] were all worldwide hits, Ben Gerson of Rolling Stone observed that the substituting of Harrison's [...] "Hare Krishna" [...] refrain for the trivial [...] "Doo-lang, doo-lang, doo-lang"s of [...] "He's So Fine" [...] was [...] "a sign of the times". John Lennon told a reporter, [...] "Every time I put the radio on, it's 'Oh my Lord' – I'm <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> {{there must be a}} God." [...] In his December 1970 album review for NME, Alan Smith bemoaned the apparent lack of a UK single release for [...] "My Sweet Lord" [...] and noted that the song [...] "seems to owe something" [...] to [...] "He's So Fine". To Gerson, it was an [...] "obvious re-write" [...] of the Chiffons hit, and within two months US music publisher Bright Tunes had served a writ on Harrison citing unauthorised copyright infringement. In a January 1971 review for NME, Derek Johnson expressed surprise at Apple's delay in releasing the single in the UK, before declaring: [...] "In my opinion, this record – finally and irrevocably – establishes George as a talent equivalent to either Lennon or McCartney." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Sparks Fly" [...] {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} music critics. Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone praised Swift's vocals on [...] "Sparks Fly", commenting that her voice {{in such an}} upbeat song is unaffected enough to mask how masterful she has become as a singer. Rahul Prabhakar of The Oxonian Review considers it [...] "dopamine-infused, hair-whipping stuff". Jonathan Keefe of Slant Magazine calls the song [...] "the purest iteration of Swift’s template and repertoire", also saying that it [...] "could turn things around for Swift, as it’s perhaps the most perfectly constructed single in a career built on tracks that are marvels of pop production and songwriting." [...] He concluded by stating that the song [...] "proves how evocative those turns-of-phrase {{can be in the}} right context. To that end, “Sparks Fly” plays as a template as much as it does as a standalone single, and it’s a testament to everything Taylor Swift gets right." [...] Bobby Peacock of Roughstock claims that he gets [...] "a sense that Taylor is starting to experience a little [...] burnout at radio. Her songs drop like rocks once they peak, and she's currently 0 for 3 on hitting the top of the Billboard charts. While I don't think this song has that je ne sais quoi to get her another 'You Belong with Me'-level [...] hit, I still think that even a slightly lesser effort from her is a worthwhile listen." [...] Blake Boldt of Engine 145 praised Swift, saying [...] "Her infusion of individual lines with urgency (“Drop everything now,” she insists) and earnestness (“Take away the pain,” she pleads) are a tribute to her talent, {{not so much as a}} distinguished vocalist but as an excellent communicator. Each frazzled note is freighted with meaning. Should I stay or should I go now?, she wonders, [...] away the hours before he calls her again." [...] Amanda Hensel of Taste of Country claimed the song is [...] "just another one of those so-Swift tracks that continually toes the line between country and pop to create a genre that is 100% Taylor Swift." [...] Erin Thompson of Seattle Weekly stated he wasn't to [...] "hot on" [...] the song and compared the song to Swift's earlier works, [...] "Fearless", [...] "Hey Stephen", and [...] "Forever and Always", and stated that Swift [...] "puts in a line about standing in the rain in so many of her songs that I'm <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> she watches The Notebook every time she gets ready to sit down and write a song." [...] Mikael Wood of Spin considered it a bubbly tune along with Swift's song, [...] "Long Live".|$|E

2500|$|Throughout the competition, Allen {{received}} many compliments for his folk-inspired interpretations of modern pop songs. He played several instruments during his performances, including the acoustic guitar, the electric guitar, the keyboard, and the piano.

[...] Flew also said: [...] "My one and only piece of relevant evidence [...] is the apparent impossibility of providing a naturalistic theory of the origin from DNA of the first reproducing species... the only reason which I have for <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of believing in a First Cause god is the impossibility of providing a naturalistic account of the origin of the first reproducing organisms." ...|$|E
2500|$|In Washington {{and around}} the country in 1839, support for the war was eroding. The size of the Army had been {{increased}} because of the demands for manpower in the Florida war. Many people were <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> that the Seminole had earned a right to stay in Florida. The cost and time required to get all the Seminole out of Florida were looming larger. [...] Congress appropriated US$5,000 to negotiate a settlement with the Seminole people in order to end the outlay of resources. President Martin Van Buren sent the Commanding General of the Army, Alexander Macomb, to negotiate a new treaty with the Seminole. Remembering the broken treaties and promises of the past, they were slow to respond to the new overtures. Finally, Sam Jones sent his chosen successor, Chitto Tustenuggee, to meet with Macomb. On May 19, 1839, Macomb announced reaching agreement with the Seminole. They would stop fighting in exchange for [...] a reservation in southern Florida.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the past}} decade the study of autoimmunity, the failure to {{recognize}} self antigens as [...] "self," [...] has grown immensely. Autoimmunity is thought by many researchers to {{be a result of}} a loss of immunological tolerance, the ability for an individual to discriminate between self and non-self, though others are <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> that many autoimmune diseases are due to mutations governing programmed cell death, or to environmental products that injure target tissues, thus causing a release of immunostimulatory alarm signals,. Growth in the field of autoimmunity has resulted in more and more frequent diagnosis of autoimmune diseases. Consequently, recent data show that autoimmune diseases affect approximately 1 in 31 people within the general population. Growth has also led to a greater characterization of what autoimmunity is and how it can be studied and treated. With an increased amount of research, there has been tremendous growth {{in the study of the}} several different ways in which autoimmunity can occur, one of which is molecular mimicry. The mechanism by which pathogens have evolved, or obtained by chance, similar amino acid sequences or the homologous three-dimensional crystal structure of immunodominant epitopes remains a mystery.|$|E

2500|$|The Atlantic {{had some}} {{similarity}} {{to the earlier}} Boulton & Paul Bourges and indeed some structural commonality, for the Bourges Mk 1B was cannibalised to produce {{the first of two}} Atlantics. [...] Though Boulton & Paul were <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> about metal framed aircraft, the Atlantic was traditionally built from wood, albeit with many metal fittings and joints. [...] It was a three-bay twin-engined biplane with wings that were neither staggered nor swept and were of parallel chord, though the lower wing was narrower than the upper. [...] Ailerons were fitted on both wings and as on the Bourges their horn balances projected beyond the wingtips. [...] The two 450hp (336kW) Napier Lion water-cooled engines were mounted on top of the lower wings just inside the innermost interplane struts. [...] They were cooled with a retractable radiator mounted under the fuselage between the undercarriage legs. [...] The fin and horn balanced rudder had a near-circular profile, but the tailplane was quite rectangular, carrying unbalanced elevators. [...] The [...] tailplane incidence was adjustable from the cockpit for trim and there was a pair of ancillary fins mounted on the tailplane to hold the aircraft straight when flying on one engine. The fins could be rotated from the cockpit and locked to cope with the asymmetry.|$|E
