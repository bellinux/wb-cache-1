The introduction of magical events from the perspective of the slaves highlights their otherness, because while they may <b>believe,</b> <b>for</b> instance, that Macandal survived his execution, the whites, and especially the readers, know that he did not. The marvellous, emphasized in the Prologue, is a product of the characters' beliefs, which is why there is the shift in perspectives when presenting it.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{explains}} {{what it is}} to <b>believe</b> something <b>for</b> a reason. I argue that you <b>believe</b> something <b>for</b> a reason just in case the reason non-deviantly causes your belief. In the course of arguing for my thesis, I present a new argument that reasons are causes and offer an informative account of causal non-deviance. 1. Preliminaries Imagine a juror with a true belief that the defendant is guilty. Having paid close attention throughout the trial, she has impeccable reasons for thinking so. But she disregards these good reasons and instead believes he’s guilty because the quarter turned up heads! (Heads he’s guilty, tails he’s not.) Our juror has good reasons for her belief. But she <b>believes</b> <b>for</b> a bad reason. <b>Believing</b> <b>for</b> a good reason is a valuable state, more valuable than merely having a good reason...|$|R

When owner Bert Bell asked him why, Smukler allegedly told him, “I’m through with football.” Apparently, Smukler had broken training rules various times in the past. He had made a pledge to Bell that this would not happen again, only to break training once more. Bell said, “In my opinion, Dave {{was one of the}} greatest football players in professional football when he wanted to be.

Boole considered converting to Judaism but in the end was said to have chosen Unitarianism. Boole came to speak against a what he saw as [...] "prideful" [...] scepticism, and instead, favoured the belief in a [...] "Supreme Intelligent Cause."

2500|$|... "The Honeymooners" [...] {{made its}} debut on October 5, 1951, as a six-minute sketch. Ensemble cast member Art Carney made a brief {{appearance}} {{as a police officer}} who gets hit with flour Ralph had thrown out the window. The tone of these early sketches was much darker than the later series, with Ralph exhibiting extreme bitterness and frustration with his marriage to an equally bitter and argumentative middle-aged woman (Kelton was nine years older than Gleason). The Kramdens' financial struggles mirrored those of Gleason's early life in Brooklyn, and he took great pains to duplicate on set the interior of the apartment where he grew up (right down to his boyhood address of 328 Chauncey Street). The Kramdens—and later the Nortons when those characters are added—are childless, an issue only occasionally explored, but a condition on which Gleason insisted. Ralph and Alice did legally adopt a baby girl whom they named Ralphina (because he actually wanted a baby boy he could name after himself but {{fell in love with the}} baby girl the agency had placed with them). However, the biological mother requested to have her baby returned, and the agency asked whether the Kramdens would be willing to do so even though they were the legal parents. Ralph agreed and stated that they would visit her and she would have a real-life Santa Claus every Christmas. A few later skits had ralph mistakenly <b>believe</b> <b>for</b> a while that Alice was pregnant.|$|E
2500|$|Dehydration refers both to hypohydration ({{dehydration}} induced {{prior to}} exercise) and to exercise-induced dehydration (dehydration that develops during exercise). The latter reduces aerobic endurance performance {{and results in}} increased body temperature, heart rate, perceived exertion, and possibly increased reliance on carbohydrate as a fuel source. Although {{the negative effects of}} exercise-induced dehydration on exercise performance were clearly demonstrated in the 1940s, athletes continued to <b>believe</b> <b>for</b> years thereafter that fluid intake was not beneficial. More recently, negative effects on performance have been demonstrated with modest (<2%) dehydration, and these effects are exacerbated when the exercise is performed in a hot environment. The effects of hypohydration may vary, depending on whether it is induced through diuretics or sauna exposure, which substantially reduce plasma volume, or prior exercise, which has much less impact on plasma volume. Hypohydration reduces aerobic endurance, but its effects on muscle strength and endurance are not consistent and require further study. [...] Intense prolonged exercise produces metabolic waste heat, and this is removed by sweat-based thermoregulation. A male marathon runner loses each hour around 0.83 L in cool weather and 1.2 L in warm (losses in females are about 68 to 73% lower). People doing heavy exercise may lose two and half times as much fluid in sweat as urine. This can have profound physiological effects. Cycling for 2 hours in the heat (35nbsp&°C) with minimal fluid intake causes body mass decline by 3 to 5%, blood volume likewise by 3 to 6%, body temperature to rise constantly, and in comparison with proper fluid intake, higher heart rates, lower stroke volumes and cardiac outputs, reduced skin blood flow, and higher systemic vascular resistance. These effects are largely eliminated by replacing 50 to 80% of the fluid lost in sweat.|$|E
