5|$|After Washington issued his 1793 Proclamation of Neutrality he <b>became</b> <b>concerned</b> that Spain, {{which later}} that year joined Britain in war against France, might work in consort to incite insurrection in the Yazoo against the U.S., using the opening of trade on the Mississippi as an enticement. At that same time though, mid-1794, Spain was {{attempting}} to extract itself from its alliance with the British, and to restore peace with France. As Spain's prime minister, Manuel de Godoy, was attempting to do so, he learned of John Jay's mission to London, and <b>became</b> <b>concerned</b> that those negotiations would result in an Anglo-American alliance and an invasion of Spanish possessions in North America. Sensing the need for rapprochement, Godoy sent a request to the U.S. government for a representative empowered to negotiate a new treaty; Washington sent Thomas Pinckney to Spain in June 1795.|$|E

5|$|Although the Serbian Army {{had put up}} fierce {{resistance}} and inflicted heavy casualties on the Austro-Hungarians, Putnik <b>became</b> <b>concerned</b> that his lines were over-extended. He began contemplating another strategic withdrawal, one in which Belgrade {{would have to be}} evacuated. On the night of 26–27 November, the Austro-Hungarian 6th Army attacked all along the front and pushed deeper into the Serbian interior.|$|E
5|$|Competition for the {{contract}} was so fierce that it involved last-minute discounts, offers of free parts and allegations of sabotage. Metro-Cammell, Kawasaki and ASEA were shortlisted for the final round. Metro-Cammell based its design on the Hong Kong MTR M-Train EMU and proposed to use the GEC propulsion system had they won {{the contract}}. Metro-Cammell also delivered a concept mock-up and was originally the favourite to win the contract. However, analysts <b>became</b> <b>concerned</b> that a measuring error involving the London Underground 1983 Stock during the evaluation period could jeopardise their bid.|$|E

5|$|During the series, Boycott <b>became</b> <b>concerned</b> {{with his}} form {{and that he}} may be dropped before he could chase Sobers' record in the {{upcoming}} tour of India. He had scored only 10 and 37 in the Fifth Test, however in the drawn Sixth Test at The Oval he scored 137, passing Colin Cowdrey's record of 7624 runs and becoming England's highest run-scorer. He ended the series behind only Botham, with 392 runs at 32.66.|$|E
5|$|In December 1944 the United States Navy's {{high command}} <b>became</b> <b>concerned</b> that the IJN {{would attempt to}} cut the supply line to the planned beachhead at Lingayen Gulf. On 26 December a Japanese naval force {{operating}} from Cam Ranh Bay in Japanese-controlled French Indochina shelled the Allied beachhead at Mindoro, but inflicted no damage. One of the Japanese destroyers involved in this operation was sunk, {{and all of the}} remaining ships were damaged by Allied air and naval attacks before returning to Cam Ranh Bay.|$|E
5|$|In early 1934, Hitler {{and other}} Nazi leaders <b>became</b> <b>concerned</b> that Röhm was {{planning}} a coup d'état. Röhm had socialist and populist views, {{and believed that}} the real revolution had not yet begun. He felt that the SA—now numbering some three million men, far dwarfing the army—should become the sole arms-bearing corps of the state, and that the army should be absorbed into the SA under his leadership. Röhm lobbied Hitler to appoint him Minister of Defence, a position held by conservative General Werner von Blomberg.|$|E

5|$|It {{was hoped}} that the Air Force would guard the plane, but, lacking hangar space, it was left {{outdoors}} on a remote part of the air base, exposed to the elements. Souvenir hunters broke in and removed parts. Insects and birds then gained access to the aircraft. Paul E. Garber of the Smithsonian Institution, <b>became</b> <b>concerned</b> about the Enola Gays condition, and on 10 August 1960, Smithsonian staff began dismantling the aircraft. The components were transported to the Smithsonian storage facility at Suitland, Maryland, on 21 July 1961.|$|E
5|$|Once {{production}} began {{it became}} apparent that Part One and Part Two were under-running so more dialogue was written to fill in the time. It was originally intended that the character of Jackson would not reappear after the second episode, but during filming Saward <b>became</b> <b>concerned</b> that it appeared that he had been executed and so he and Clegg rewrote Part Three to include him. Part Three also looked to be under running so scenes from Part Four were brought forward and the final scenes with the Guardians were extended to compensate.|$|E
5|$|Plume {{harvesting}} {{became a}} dangerous business. The Audubon Society <b>became</b> <b>concerned</b> {{with the amount}} of hunting being done in rookeries in the mangrove forests. In 1902, they hired a warden, Guy Bradley, to watch the rookeries around Cuthbert Lake. Bradley had lived in Flamingo within the Everglades, and was murdered in 1905 by one of his neighbors after he tried to prevent him from hunting. Protection of birds was the reason for establishing the first wildlife refuge when President Theodore Roosevelt set Pelican Island as a sanctuary in 1903.|$|E

5|$|The Scilly Isles were {{supporters}} of Charles I {{during the civil}} war, and after a short period in Parliamentary control rebelled in favour of Charles in 1648. Tresco formed a base for Royalists privateers and Parliament <b>became</b> <b>concerned</b> that the Dutch, then hostile to England, might counter the piracy by occupying the islands, gaining a foothold they could then use against England. In 1651 Parliament sent Sir Robert Blake {{in charge of a}} naval task force to retake the islands.|$|E
5|$|Trans World Airlines (TWA) Flight 159 was a {{regularly}} scheduled passenger flight from New York City to Los Angeles, California, with a stopover in Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport, Kentucky, that crashed after an aborted takeoff from Cincinnati on 6 November 1967. The Boeing 707 attempted to abort takeoff when the copilot <b>became</b> <b>concerned</b> that the aircraft had {{collided with a}} disabled DC-9 on the runway.

5|$|Two further Carry On films {{followed}} for Jacques in 1972: Carry On Matron, {{for which she}} was engaged in the title role, and Carry On Abroad, as Floella, the fiery Spanish cook at a half-finished hotel. As well as the film being Charles Hawtrey's last, it also marked a reduction in Jacques's screen time; she spent only one week filming her scenes. During post-production, the film's insurers <b>became</b> <b>concerned</b> about Jacques's deteriorating health. In {{a letter to the}} series producer Peter Rogers, they expressed their reluctance to insure her on set in any future film.|$|E

40|$|Traditional {{undergraduate}} {{liberal arts}} courses, required of most premedical and predental students, have failed dismally to motivate doctors and dentists to <b>become</b> <b>concerned</b> {{with the health}} problems of the poor, be they black or white. Examination of black studies programs leads the authors to believe that these programs, if planned with the purpose in view, would {{be a source of}} additional doctors and dentists with humanitarian and community-oriented values.

5|$|With {{their victory}} in the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–05, the Japanese <b>became</b> <b>concerned</b> about the {{potential}} for conflict with the US. The theorist Satō Tetsutarō developed the doctrine that Japan should have a battlefleet at least 70% the size of that of the US. This would enable the Japanese navy to win two decisive battles, the first early in a war against the US Pacific Fleet, and the second against the US Atlantic Fleet which would inevitably be dispatched as reinforcements.|$|E
5|$|Although American Graffiti {{is set in}} 1962 Modesto, California, Lucas {{believed}} the city had changed too much in 10 years and initially chose San Rafael as the primary shooting location. Filming began on June 26, 1972. However, Lucas soon became frustrated {{at the time it}} was taking to fix camera mounts to the cars. A key member of the production had also been arrested for growing marijuana, and, in addition to already running behind the shooting schedule, the San Rafael City Council immediately <b>became</b> <b>concerned</b> about the disruption that filming caused for local businesses and therefore withdrew permission to shoot beyond a second day.|$|E
5|$|As Isma'il al-Azhari {{began to}} assert his power, both Sayyid Ali al-Mirghani and Sayyid Abd al-Rahman <b>became</b> <b>concerned</b> {{that they would}} lose their {{political}} influence. From October 1955 Sayyid Ali began to seek ways to oust Isma'il al-Azhari from power. A key issue was whether a plebiscite should be held to determine if Sudan was to be independent of Egypt, which Sayyid Ali supported and Isma'il al-Azhari opposed. To strengthen his position in parliament, Isma'il al-Azhari started making overtures to associates of Sayyid Abd al-Rahman to explore {{the idea of an}} NUP-Umma coalition. Sudan formally became independent on 1 January 1956. On 2 February 1956 Isma'il al-Azhari announced a new cabinet that included representatives of all political parties and factions.|$|E
