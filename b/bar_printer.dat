50|$|Line matrix {{printers}} {{can print}} text, bar codes and graphics. Line matrix printers were originally popularized by the mini-computer craze and continued its growth as a <b>bar</b> code <b>printer.</b> Today they {{are sold in}} virtually {{every corner of the}} world and while they print as rapidly as line printers, they can print bar codes and other graphics as well. When implemented as impact printers, they can be the least expensive to operate per page.|$|R
25|$|Others In addition, machine {{operators}} {{often use}} user interface devices, typically touchscreen units, which {{serve as the}} operator control panel. The operator can switch from program to program, make adjustments within a program and also operate a host of peripheral devices that may be integrated within the same robotic system. These include end effectors, feeders that supply components to the robot, conveyor belts, emergency stop controls, machine vision systems, safety interlock systems, <b>bar</b> code <b>printers</b> and an almost infinite array of other industrial devices which are accessed and controlled via the operator control panel.|$|R

40|$|The electromagnetically {{isolated}} programming {{of unique}} user IDs, into the transponder memory of UHF RFID inlays, {{is essential for}} successful operation in the RFID inventory process. <b>Bar</b> code <b>printers</b> enabled for RFID represent a typical environment of such programming. They are usually equipped with an RFID interrogator and a reactive near field (RNF) coupler. <b>Bar</b> code <b>printers,</b> in particular those for industrial use, consist of compact robust metallic media housings. This environment fundamentally changes the electromagnetical properties of RFID inlays, nominally designed for operation in the far field. One fundamental requirement put on the coupler design is the strong mutual electromagnetic interaction towards RFID inlays with arbitrary antenna geometries, yet still completely isolated from neighboring inlays, being as close as a couple of millimeters apart. Another requirement is efficient coupling despite strong non-linearity of the transponder chip for increased drive power levels. This thesis treats the prerequisites for an adaptive solution of geometry independent RFID inlay programming in reactive near field. The work {{is divided into two}} distinct parts. The first part addresses the non-linear behavior of RFID transponder chips under source impedance and drive level shift. A measurement method with modulated stimuli is developed from which a figure of merit (FOM) is extracted, including the |ΔΓ|-value, a common performance parameter found in the RFID community. A dual probe connection method is introduced, enabling the characterization of RFID transponder chips from several vendors having different size parameters. An approximate ideal clipping model is developed, enabling power swept measurements with a linear vector network analyzer (VNA). In the second part the differential transmission line loop (DTLL) is presented as novel coupling element for high efficient programming of RFID inlays in reactive near field (RNF). Results for simple super elliptic loop geometries show strong magnetic coupling towards a number of different inlay geometries, utilizing the current inductive loop of the inlay. The inductive loop is common for virtually all inlay types, making the DTLL a strong candidate as coupling element in future adaptive coupling technologies. In particular the DTLL offers design flexibility both in component choice and geometry, suitable for further element optimization...|$|R
40|$|Radio {{frequency}} identification (RFID) {{offers a}} vast variety of options {{to improve the}} functionality and efficiency in the automated data collection (ADC) industry and Internet of Things (IoT). In the inventory process of RFID with passive data carriers, a population of battery less tags {{is located in the}} working range of an interrogator system. These tags contain transponders receiving operating energy from radio waves which can demodulate and modulate a digital signal from an RF carrier. The fundamental prerequisite in RFID is unique user identities (IDs) stored in the tag memories. Commonly, programming of these IDs occurs in the reactive near field, where the cavity of an RFID enabled <b>bar</b> code <b>printer</b> represents a typical example of such an environment. The two major challenges of user ID programming are the change of the electrical environment presented towards the transponder, as compared to the nominal far field or propagating near field conditions, and electromagnetic spatial selection, to prevent non-target tag programming. This thesis presents the results from an industrial Ph. D. project, in collaboration between industry and university. In a first part, novel measurement and characterization techniques of RFID transponders are presented, with the main goal of understanding the impact of non-linearity on communication quality under altered reactive near field conditions. The remaining part of the thesis addresses fundamental components needed in the concept of self adaptive reactive near field coupler technology, for geometry independent and spatially selective programming of RFID tags. The core of the technology is the differential transmission line loop (DTLL), exhibiting highly efficient and spatially selective coupling for varying inlay geometry; as such an array based spatial distribution of the reactive near field coupling is enabled. As exemplary simulations show, the versatility of the DTLL offers flexibility in array design, of creating a phase controlled reactive near field over the entire structure, which hence acts as a sensitive array. The elements act independently, where the amount of phase alteration in each element is a compensation for the geometrical size of the element itself. A fundamental property of the sensitive array is the independency of a software system, controlling the coupling elements. In other words, the reactive near field coupling of the array is self contained...|$|R
40|$|Transcript, 42 pp. Audio file {{available}} at [URL] describes National Cash Register's (now NCR) {{early years in}} the electronic computing industry. Mumma {{went to work for}} NCR in 1939 in their newly formed Electronic Research Department. Before the war he designed gas thyratron tubes for use as decimal counters in an electronic calculator, a working model of which was completed before the war. Mumma discusses the contact NCR had during this period with MIT and Harvard, and reviews some of the early research projects and personnel at NCR. He describes in guarded terms work NCR did before the war for NDRC on a secret communication system and during the war on a high speed counter for measuring muzzle velocity of cannon shells. He recounts how war-time work on cryptanalytic equipment took all the company's effort, and how this shaped company policy resisting government contract work after the war. The second half of the interview describes NCR's move into commercial electronic computing in the 1940 s, 1950 s, and early 1960 s, with such products as cash registers with punched tape, accounting machines with electronic multiplier, high-speed <b>printers,</b> <b>bar</b> code readers, point-of-sale terminals, and magnetic ink character recognition equipment. Mumma explains how NCR considered purchasing the Eckert-Mauchly Company prior to its acquisition of Computer Research Corporation, as a way of entering the computer field. The division of labor between NCR-Dayton and the NCR-CRC division are considered, as are the difficulties of promoting, developing, and marketing electronic technology in the mechanically-oriented environment of NCR headquarters in Dayton...|$|R
