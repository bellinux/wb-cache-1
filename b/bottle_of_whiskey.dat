5|$|The {{scene where}} Lisa gives a <b>bottle</b> <b>of</b> <b>whiskey</b> {{to a man}} on horseback (payment for {{delivering}} a letter) is a reference to Meryl Streep's scene from the film The French Lieutenant's Woman. Some aspects of the episode are references to the novel Lord of the Flies (a pig's head on a spear, kids using primitive weapons and wearing war paint, and a burning effigy).|$|E
5|$|The episode {{begins with}} Tom (Shearsmith), a primary school teacher, apathetically marking work while chatting {{to his girlfriend}} Gerri (Arterton), {{who is going to}} {{audition}} for a part in a play. Tom complains about a tramp begging outside their house. Later in the evening, Tom is home alone and Migg (Pemberton), the tramp, comes to his door, to return Tom's wallet. Tom rewards him with £40. Migg comes back later with a <b>bottle</b> <b>of</b> <b>whiskey</b> for Tom. Reluctantly, Tom invites Migg inside for a drink. Migg says he knew Charles Bukowski, whom Tom as an aspiring author idolises, and Tom warms to Migg as they drink.|$|E
5|$|The departures of Núñez and Louis van Gaal {{were hardly}} noticed by the fans when {{compared}} to that of Luís Figo, then club vice-captain. Figo had become a cult hero and was considered by Catalans to be one of their own. Barcelona fans, however, were distraught by Figo's decision to join arch-rivals Real Madrid, and, during subsequent visits to the Camp Nou with Madrid, Figo was given an extremely hostile reception. Upon his first return, a piglet's head and a full <b>bottle</b> <b>of</b> <b>whiskey</b> were thrown at him from the crowd. The next three years saw the club in decline, and managers came and went. Van Gaal was replaced by Llorenç Serra Ferrer who, despite an extensive investment in players in the summer of 2000, presided over a mediocre league campaign and a humiliating first-round Champions League exit, and was eventually dismissed late in the season.|$|E

5|$|The video {{begins with}} the singer recalling {{memories}} from a hangover, including images of whiskey, a shoe in a chandelier, and her making out with a man flash on the screen, particularly getting a <b>bottle</b> <b>of</b> <b>whiskey</b> and drinking it with him. In the following scene, Lo is seen at a tea party with four other women and the waitresses, where they drink champagne amongst an array of cakes and cupcakes. As the video flashes white, it shows {{a glimpse of the}} other women's fantasies. Then, Lo becomes drunk, takes her shirt off, smears cake on her face, pours champagne on herself and starts to dance with her guests and the waitresses. In the following scene, she makes out with the man she was drinking with. The visual ends with the singer being at home while vomiting into a sink. Scenes interspersed through the main plot portray Lo in a dark room, with mascara dripping from her eyes while doing activities such as blowing bubble gum, eating melting ice cream, and smoking a cigarette.|$|E

Upon his first return, a piglet's head and a full <b>bottle</b> <b>of</b> <b>whiskey</b> were thrown at him from the crowd. The next three years saw the club in decline, and managers came and went. Van Gaal was replaced by Lorenzo Serra Ferrer who, despite an extensive investment in players in the summer of 2000, presided over a mediocre league campaign and a humiliating first-round Champions League exit, and was eventually dismissed late in the season. Long-serving coach Carles Rexach was appointed as his replacement, initially on a temporary basis, and managed to at least steer the club to the last Champions League spot {{on the final day of}} the season. Despite better form in La Liga and a good run to the semi-finals of the Champions League, Rexach was never viewed as a long-term solution and that summer Van Gaal returned to the club for a second spell as manager. What followed, despite another decent Champions League performance, was one of the worst La Liga campaigns in the club's history, with the team as low as 15th in February 2003. This led to Van Gaal's resignation and replacement for the rest of the campaign by Radomir Antić, though a sixth-place finish was the best that he could manage. At the end of the season, Antić's short-term contract was not renewed, and club president Joan Gaspart resigned, his position having been made completely untenable by such a disastrous season on top of the club's overall decline in fortunes since he became president three years prior.|$|E

500|$|Ono and Lennon's son, Sean, {{was born}} on October 9, 1975, which was Lennon's 35th birthday.

500|$|He {{heads to}} her house, which is eerily quiet. Going in, he discovers a <b>bottle</b> <b>of</b> <b>whiskey,</b> several {{cigarette}} butts, and a telegram from the government. Dorothy's husband is dead, his plane {{shot down over}} France. Dorothy comes out of her bedroom, crying, and Hermie tells her [...] "I'm sorry." [...] The sense of empathy triggers her to channel to Hermie some of her loneliness. She turns on the record player and invites Hermie to dance with her. They kiss and embrace, tears on both their faces. Without speaking, and to the sound only of the waves, they move to the bedroom, where she draws him into bed and gently makes love with him. Afterward, withdrawing again into her world of hurt, Dorothy retires to the porch, leaving Hermie alone in her bedroom. He approaches her on the porch, where she can only quietly say [...] "Good night, Hermie." [...] He leaves, his last image of Dorothy being of her leaning against the railing, as she smokes a cigarette and stares into the night sky.|$|E
500|$|Lennon {{initially}} {{teamed up}} with producer Phil Spector to record the album, letting Spector have full control. Spector chose some of the songs, booked the studio, and the musicians. When news got around that Lennon was in Hollywood making a record, every musician there {{wanted to be part}} of the sessions. In mid-October 1973, sessions were booked at A Studios, with many of them having over 30 musicians, but the sessions quickly fell into disarray—fueled by alcohol. Spector once showed up dressed in a surgeon's outfit and shot a gun in the ceiling of the studio, hurting Lennon's ears. [...] On another occasion, a <b>bottle</b> <b>of</b> <b>whiskey</b> had spilled on the A Studio's mixing console causing future sessions to be banned from the facility. Unknown to Lennon, each night Spector would remove the master tapes from the studio, and move them to his house. Spector then disappeared with the session tapes and would not be heard from for several months. Spector made one cryptic call to Lennon, claiming to have the [...] "John Dean tapes" [...] from the recent Watergate scandal; Lennon deduced that Spector meant he had the album's master tapes. When a car accident on 31 March 1974 left Spector in a coma, the project was put on indefinite hold. In mid-1974, Lennon returned to New York with Pang and began writing and recording a new album of original material, Walls and Bridges. Shortly before these sessions began, Al Coury, then-head of A/promotion for Capitol Records retrieved the Spector tapes. Not wanting to break stride, Lennon shelved the tapes and completed work on Walls and Bridges.|$|E
