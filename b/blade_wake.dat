40|$|In some situations, {{concentrated}} vorticity {{which forms}} a vortical flow {{is involved in}} the inflow of a propeller. The impingement of the vortex on the propeller has several detrimental effects, e. g., foreign object damage during ground operation, impact on the propeller performance, unsteady loading on the blade, and tonal noise generation. The research presented in this report is conducted for the concern {{of the effects of the}} interaction between inflow vortex and propeller, in terms of vortex response to the propeller and vortex impact on the aerodynamic performance of the propeller. The impact of impinging vortex on the propeller is studied by experimental and numerical methods. The variation of the propeller performance caused by the impingement of vortex is dependent on the relatively rotational direction of the vortex and the propeller. For the counter-rotating case, the thrust and torque coefficients are increased by the vortex impingement; and vice versa for the co-rotating case. The variations of the thrust and torque coefficients are proportional to the vortex strength. And it becomes more significant as the radial impingement position moves inwards and the advance ratio increases. However, the impingement of vortex does not evidently affects the efficiency of the propeller. The response of vortex to the propeller is investigated by PIV measurement. The variation of vortex behaviors is dependent on the phase angle of the propeller blade. At the phase angles when the wake of the blade is away from the impinging vortex, the vortex core circulation is independent from the impact of propeller. Due to the contraction of the stream tube caused by the propeller suction, the vortex core radius observed in the measurement plane downstream the propeller is smaller than that in the flow field upstream, and the magnitude of vortex vorticity and the maximum tangential velocity becomes larger. At the phase angle when the vortex core coincides with the propeller <b>blade</b> <b>wake</b> vortices, characteristics of the impinging vortex are dependent on the sign of the vorticity of the impinging vortex and the <b>blade</b> <b>wake.</b> For the case that the impinging vortex and the <b>blade</b> <b>wake</b> have the opposite sign of vorticity, the impinging vortex and the <b>blade</b> <b>wake</b> break each other into fractions with smaller core radius and circulation; for the case with the same sign of vorticity, they merge together, forming a new pattern with higher magnitude of vorticity.

Tests were made with circular and NACA 0012 rotor-blade sections. The blades were operated only with zero lift at each radial station.

The rotor with cylindrical blades generally radiated more noise throughout the noise spectrum than did the rotor with airfoil blades.

40|$|An {{experimental}} investigation using {{trailing edge}} blowing for reducing fan rotor/guide vane wake interaction noise {{was completed in}} the NASA Glenn 9 - by 15 -foot Low Speed Wind Tunnel. Data were acquired to measure noise, aerodynamic performance, and flow features for a 22 " tip diameter fan representative of modern turbofan technology. The fan was designed to use trailing edge blowing to reduce the fan <b>blade</b> <b>wake</b> momentum deficit. The test objective was to quantify noise reductions, measure impacts on fan aerodynamic performance, and document the flow field using hot-film anemometry. Measurements concentrated on approach, cutback, and takeoff rotational speeds as those are the primary conditions of acoustic interest. Data are presented for a 2 % (relative to overall fan flow) trailing edge injection rate and show a 2 dB reduction in Overall Sound Power Level (OAPWL) at all fan test speeds. The reduction in broadband noise is nearly constant and is approximately 1. 5 dB up to 20 kHz at all fan speeds. Measurements of tone noise show significant variation, as evidenced by reductions of up to 6 dB in the 2 BPF tone at 6700 rpm. : and increases of nearly 2 dB for the 4 BPF tone at approach speed. Aerodynamic performance measurements show the fan with 2 % injection has an overall efficiency that {{is comparable to the}} baseline fan and operates, as intended, with nearly the same pressure ratio and mass flow parameters. Hot-film measurements obtained at the approach operating condition indicate that mean <b>blade</b> <b>wake</b> filling in the tip region was not as significant as expected. This suggests that additional acoustic benefits could be realized if the trailing edge blowing could be modified to provide better filling of the wake momentum deficit. Nevertheless, the hot-film measurements indicate that the trailing edge blowing provided significant reductions in <b>blade</b> <b>wake</b> turbulence. Overall, these results indicate that further work may be required to fully understand the proper implementation of injecting flow at/near the trailing edge as a wake filling strategy.

Average computing times for the three cases confirmed that the cases with the smallest computational domain were the most efficient.
