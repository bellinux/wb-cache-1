5|$|On Hill 69 and {{the coastal}} road, the 53rd Battalion intercepted and engaged a {{contingent}} of Egyptian reinforcements from Majdal. After the battles, the 53rd Battalion reported that at 03:00, they had <b>been</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> ambush possible reinforcements, and at 06:00, an Egyptian convoy of two armored vehicles and 4 other vehicles {{made their way to}} Isdud. They were hit by Israeli mines, operated by Avraham Schwarzstein's platoon (see Battle of Nitzanim), and only two vehicles made it out and back to Majdal. At 09:00 the general retreat order was given, and after reaching Nitzanim, Schwarzstein's platoon set out to assist the Negev forces' retreat, helping carry the 20-so casualties. The forces on Hill 69 retreated only at noon to Be'er Tuvia.|$|E
5|$|The convoys {{of wounded}} were met {{a few miles}} from El Arish by {{infantry}} with sandcarts lent by the 52nd (Lowland) Division, so the wounded who had endured the cacolets travelled in comfort to the receiving station, arriving at 04:00 on 25 December. The 52nd (Lowland) Division supplied medical stores and personnel to assist, but although arrangements were made for evacuation to the railhead two days later, evacuation by sea was planned. This had to be postponed due to a gale with rain and hail on 27 December and it was not until 29 December that the largest single ambulance convoy organised in the campaign, 77 sandcarts, nine sledges and a number of cacolet camels, moved out in three lines along the beach with 150 wounded. A few serious cases, who had not <b>been</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> be moved, were evacuated the following day to begin their journey to Kantara on the Suez Canal.|$|E
25|$|The Browns {{and their}} {{supporters}} were despondent over the loss and returned from Chicago to a station devoid of welcoming fans. Browns players were critical of player-manager Charlie Comiskey's decision to start Caruthers in back-to-back games, noting that Nat Hudson had <b>been</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> start for the visitors until the last-minute {{decision was made to}} bring back the team's ace on zero rest. Star outfielder Tip O'Neill expressed the view that the pitching situation had been miserably managed and that the entire team had been put off by the decision not to rest Caruthers.|$|E

25|$|According to Fairey's projections, the ER.103/B {{could have}} <b>been</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> fly within {{eighteen}} months of having received an order, while the ER.103/C {{could reach the}} same readiness within 30 months. In particular, Fairey pursued Operational Requirement F.155, which called for a two-seat fighter equipped with radar and missiles with suitable performance to achieve an altitude of 60,000 feet and Mach 2 within six minutes of taking off; while the company thought the firm thought that their design {{would be able to}} fully capable of meeting the specified requirements, it was believed that the complete weapon system would not be fully developed until 1962. Thus, Fairey proposed that a simpler interim aircraft, if selected, could be available by 1960 or potentially earlier.|$|E
25|$|In July 2007, Vaz {{was elected}} as {{the chair of}} the Home Affairs Select Committee. Select {{committee}} members are usually proposed by the Committee of Selection which, under the Standing Orders of the House, nominates members to select committees., but unusually Vaz was the only nomination made by Harriet Harman, Leader of the House of Commons and Lord Privy Seal. Harman argued that this was because there was not sufficient time to go through the usual procedure before the impending summer recess. The Chairman of the Committee of Selection told the House that the Committee had <b>been</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> meet earlier that week, but had been advised by the Government that there was no business for it to transact. Vaz replaced John Denham on 26 July 2007. Vaz was re-elected to the Committee's chairmanship in June 2015.|$|E
25|$|The Battle of Albert (21–3 August) saw Third Army {{push forward}} up to 4,000 yards over an 11 mile front, taking 5,000 prisoners, with Fourth Army attacking on the {{southern}} flank - in Gary Sheffield's description, a victory for ordinary British troops which {{would not have happened}} without Haig’s prodding of Byng. The attacks continued for another two days, then on 26 August Currie’s Canadian Corps, now part of First Army, attacked at Arras further north. Haig wrote to his wife that this, the Battle of the Scarpe, was “the greatest victory which a British Army has ever achieved”, and although it did not achieve quite the planned level of success – cavalry, including a brigade of infantry in buses, had <b>been</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> exploit – Ludendorff ordered further withdrawals that evening, including the ground gained by “Georgette” in April.|$|E

500|$|Following a {{statement}} by Chief Minister Jayalalithaa that the flooding had {{been the result of}} exceptional rainfall, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) issued a strong criticism on 16 November, stating that the flooding in Chennai could have been averted if local and state officials had taken strong precautions. The state BJP president, Tamilisai Soundararajan, said: [...] "Even if it was six months of rain on a single day, the administration should have <b>been</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> tackle it." [...] Tamilisai mentioned the cleaning and de-silting of the Cooum River would allow it to divert large amounts of runoff during the monsoons.|$|E

500|$|Additionally, the Soviet Union {{had once}} <b>been</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> support an control {{commission}} {{under the aegis}} of the UN, Khrushchev explained, but it could not longer do so given perceived bias in recent UN action in the Congo. Instead, Khrushchev reiterated the troika proposal. Furthermore, Khrushchev insisted that the test ban be considered in the context of [...] "general and complete disarmament," [...] arguing that a test ban on its own was unimportant; Kennedy said the US could only agree with a guarantee that a disarmament agreement would be reached quickly (the Vienna demands thus amounted to a reversal of both sides' earlier positions). Kennedy also disagreed that a test ban was itself insignificant; the world could expect many more countries in the coming years to cross the nuclear threshold without a test ban. Ultimately, the two leaders left Vienna without clear progress on the subject. The Soviet Union would drop the general-disarmament demand in November 1961.|$|E

Charles would gladly have given them office if they had <b>been</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> desert their principles. Every day Hampden's conviction grew stronger that Charles would never surrender a position which he had taken up. In August 1641 Hampden was one of the four commissioners who attended Charles in Scotland, and the king's conduct there, [...] connected with such events as the [...] "Incident", must have proved to a man far less sagacious than Hampden that the time for compromise had gone by. He was therefore a warm supporter of the Grand Remonstrance, and was marked out as one of the five impeached members, known thenceforth in history as the Five Members (the others being John Pym] Arthur Haselrig, Denzil Holles and William Strode) whose attempted arrest brought at last the opposing parties into open collision. In the angry scene which arose on the proposal to print the Grand Remonstrance, it was Hampden's personal intervention which prevented an actual conflict, and it was after the impeachment had been attempted that Hampden laid down the two conditions under which resistance to the king became the duty of a good subject.

[...] He praised Frost for the way he [...] "chaired the proceedings with his usual unflappable professionalism" [...] and Burnett for [...] "combining straight news with personal comment", though he said [...] "the combination of news and variety is more debatable. There is certainly something a bit strange about going straight from a discussion about the orbit of Luna 15 to hearing Cilla Black singing her latest recording. On balance, I think this type of juxtaposition is justified, if only because some point of rest is needed in a programme of this length. The danger is that the viewer will be so saturated with information that his responses will be blunted {{when it comes to the}} moments of real excitement: pop music, however, provides the necessary let-up and fulfills much the same function as comic relief in a five-act drama.|$|E
