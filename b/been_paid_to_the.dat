5|$|The jealous {{attention}} {{which has}} <b>been</b> <b>paid</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> unities both {{of time and}} place has taken away the principle of perspective in the drama, and all the interest which objects derive from distance, from contrast, from privation, from change of fortune, from long-cherished passion; and contrasts our view of life from a strange and romantic dream, long, obscure, and infinite, into a smartly contested, three hours' inaugural disputation on its merits by the different candidates for theatrical applause.|$|E
5|$|Scholarship in {{the area}} of Jewish Christian studies has tended to be based on {{artificial}} constructs similar to those developed by the early Christian heresiologists, with the underlying assumption that all of the beliefs and practices of these groups were based on theology. This has led to the perpetuation of ideological definitions that fail {{to take into account the}} pluriformity of these groups, reflecting differences in geography, time periods in history, and ethnicity. With respect to Epiphanius, and the Ebionites in particular, insufficient attention has <b>been</b> <b>paid</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> highly speculative nature of his theological constructs and his mixing together of disparate sources, including his use of a gospel harmony that may have had nothing to do with the Ebionite sect known to Irenaeus. In the end, he presents an enigmatic picture of the Ebionites and their place in early Christian history.|$|E
5|$|Tvrtko's {{coronation}} as King of Bosnia and Serbia {{was held}} in the fall of 1377 (probably 26 October, the feast day of Saint Demetrius), but there is no consensus as to where it took place. The Ragusan chronicler Mavro Orbini wrote, in 1601, that the coronation was performed in the Serbian monastery of Mileševa by its Orthodox metropolitan bishop, an opinion accepted today only in Serbian historiography. Citing more recent archaeological and historical research, Croatian and Bosnian historians agree that the coronation more likely took place in the Franciscan Church of Saint Nicholas in the Bosnian town of Mile, which is the undisputed place of the coronations of Tvrtko I's successors. Writing to Ragusa shortly after his coronation, Tvrtko successfully claimed Saint Demetrius' income, which had <b>been</b> <b>paid</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> kings of Serbia since the 13th century.|$|E

5|$|Spanish conquistador Pedro de Alvarado {{passed through}} Soconusco with a {{sizeable}} force in 1523, {{en route to}} conquer Guatemala. Alvarado's army included hardened veterans of the conquest of the Aztecs, and included cavalry and artillery; there were also a great many indigenous allies from Cholula, Tenochtitlan, Tezcoco, Tlaxcala, and Xochimilco. Alvarado was received in peace in Soconusco, and the inhabitants swore allegiance to the Spanish Crown. They reported that neighbouring groups in Guatemala were attacking them because of their friendly outlook towards the Spanish. Alvarado's letter to Hernán Cortés describing his passage through Soconusco is lost, and knowledge of events there come from the account of Bernal Díaz del Castillo, who was not present, but related the report of Gonzalo de Alvarado. By 1524, Soconusco had been completely pacified by Alvarado and his forces. Over the next fifty years, native population levels collapsed catastrophically {{as a result of}} exposure to Old World diseases, with an estimated 90–95% drop. In spite of this, the colonial administration demanded twice as much tribute in cacao as had <b>been</b> <b>paid</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Aztecs prior to the Spanish invasion, and cacao continued to be an important crop throughout the colonial period. Due to the economic importance of cacao to the new colony, the Spanish were reluctant to move the indigenous inhabitants far from their established cacao orchards. As a result, the inhabitants of Soconusco {{were less likely to be}} rounded up into new reducción settlements, where the planting of a new cacao crop would have required five years to mature.|$|E

Relations with the ROCOR Metropolitans were devoted to presentations Krutitsa Juvenal, Vienna Irenaeus (Zuzemilya), Archbishops Kirill of Smolensk, Saratov Pimen (Khmelevskiy), Yaroslavl Plato, Archpriest Basil Stoyanova priest Vitaly Shastina, Hieromonk Hilarion (Alfeyev) and others.|$|E

Typically, the sale of laser pointers is restricted to either class3A (<5nbsp&mW) or classnbsp&2 (<1nbsp&mW), depending on local regulations. For example, in the US, Canada and the UK, classnbsp&3A is the maximum permitted, unless a key actuated control or other safety features are provided. In Australia, classnbsp&2 is the maximum allowed class. However, because enforcement is often not very strict, laser pointers of classnbsp&2 and above are often available for sale even in countries where they are not allowed.|$|E

25|$|The book of Esther is {{traditionally}} read by Jews on the holiday of Purim from a handwritten scroll on parchment {{that must be}} halakhically valid. This means that the rules of open and closed parashot are of more practical relevance for Esther than for any other book in Nevi'im or Ketuvim. Despite this—or {{perhaps because of the}} large numbers of scrolls of Esther that have been written, and the special attention that has therefore <b>been</b> <b>paid</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> problem by rabbis and scribes—manuscripts of Esther and opinions about how they should be written betray a relatively large number of discrepancies regarding the parashah divisions.|$|E
25|$|Critics {{have offered}} various {{interpretations of the}} film's message and its {{significance}} for the series. Particular attention has <b>been</b> <b>paid</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ambiguous imagery in the ending: set 700 years after the main events, the last scene depicts a statue of Caesar shedding a single tear as the Lawgiver recounts Caesar's story to an integrated audience of ape and human children. By one interpretation, the statue cries tears of joy because the species have broken the cycle of oppression, giving the series an optimistic finale. By another, the statue weeps because racial strife still exists, implying the dystopian future of Planet and Beneath is unavoidable.|$|E

On the inner face of the octagon the declaration of faith is followed by conflated verses describing the powers of God. Next Muhammad is introduced, with a blessing that, though not directly quoted from the Quran, was clearly already in use in 694 AD. Then comes an exhortation to Christians that Jesus was also a prophet and mortal, followed by the claim that God is sufficient unto Himself. Finally comes a command to bend to His will and the threat of reckoning for those who do not.|$|E
