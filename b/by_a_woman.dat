5|$|Although Ravel {{wrote for}} mixed choirs and male solo voices, he is chiefly associated, in his songs, with the soprano and {{mezzo-soprano}} voices. Even when setting lyrics clearly narrated by a man, he often favoured a female voice, {{and he seems}} to have preferred his best-known cycle, Shéhérazade, to be sung <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman,</b> although a tenor voice is a permitted alternative in the score.|$|E

She is perhaps more famous than her father, because at some time between 1013 and 1016 she married Cnut, son of Sweyn Forkbeard, future King of the English. Her son was Harold Harefoot, King of the English.|$|E
5|$|Baith Israel Anshei Emes's move to egalitarianism {{culminated in}} August 1988, when Debra Cantor {{was hired as}} its first female rabbi, making it the first synagogue in the Northeastern United States to be led <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman.</b> Cantor, who was 33 at the time, had been valedictorian of that year's graduating class at the Jewish Theological Seminary. The {{decision}} was not accepted by all congregants; the Conservative movement had ordained its first female rabbi, Amy Eilberg, only three years before, in 1985, and following Cantor's appointment a number of families left the synagogue to form B'nai Avraham, an Orthodox congregation in Brooklyn Heights.|$|E

5|$|One notable {{section of}} Riverside is Silvertown, a {{subdivision}} developed in 1887 for African Americans.

5|$|Part {{of the new}} {{genre of}} the Romantic travel narrative, History of a Six Weeks' Tour exudes spontaneity and enthusiasm; the authors {{demonstrate}} their desire to {{develop a sense of}} taste and distinguish themselves from those around them. The romantic elements of the work would have hinted at the text's radical politics to nineteenth-century readers. However, the text's frank discussion of politics, including positive references to the French Revolution and praise of Enlightenment philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau, was unusual for a travel narrative at the time, particularly one authored primarily <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman.</b>|$|E
