She refuses to destroy it, and quarrels with Tigerstar about housecats {{and how they are}} not independent. Sad, she reminisces about her perfect life with Jean and Ken.|$|E

Even the NSDP (Net STate Domestic Product) ratings suggest that the growth is a decent 12.15% per annum.

25|$|In other {{situations}} the delusion {{may turn out}} to be true belief. For example, in delusional jealousy, where a person believes that their partner is being unfaithful (and may even follow them into the bathroom believing them to <b>be</b> <b>seeing</b> their lover even during the briefest of partings), it may actually be true that the partner is having sexual relations with another person. In this case, the delusion does not cease to be a delusion because the content later turns out to be verified as true or the partner actually chose to engage in the behavior of which they were being accused.|$|E

40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was carried out}} to test the thesis that people employ sensory-motor conceptual metaphors to understand metaphorical expressions. Congenitally blind and sighted participants paraphrased metaphorical expressions derived from the UNDERSTANDING is GRASPING and UNDERSTANDING <b>is</b> <b>SEEING</b> conceptual metaphors, and evaluated to what extent they felt they had understood them. On the one hand, congenitally blind participants did not comprehend better UNDERSTANDING is GRASPING expressions than UNDERSTANDING <b>is</b> <b>SEEING</b> expressions. On the other hand, sighted participants did not comprehend UNDERSTANDING <b>is</b> <b>SEEING</b> expressions better than the blind.

25|$|Many locals say Orang Pendek's feet {{look like}} those of a child, {{evidenced}} by foot prints they have found while walking through the forest. However, another local animal, the sun bear, is a possible source of these sightings. Bears in general are known for having feet that look quite human-like, and the size of a sun bear's {{are similar to those of}} a child. In addition, gibbons populate the forests in this area and are known to occasionally descend to the ground and walk for a few seconds at a time on two legs. Witnesses could possibly <b>be</b> <b>seeing</b> orangutans; however: 1) this species has long been thought to have died out in all but the northern regions of Sumatra and 2) witnesses almost never describe the animal as having orange fur.|$|E

In the 1920s and 1930s Abyssinia was the name for the country now called Ethiopia.)

500|$|With a {{collection}} of songs reportedly written while snowed in on his Minnesota ranch, Dylan booked recording time with Daniel Lanois at Miami's Criteria Studios in January 1997.

Before the album's release Dylan was hospitalized with a life-threatening heart infection, pericarditis, brought on by histoplasmosis. His scheduled European tour was cancelled, but Dylan made a speedy recovery and left the hospital saying, [...] "I really thought I'd <b>be</b> <b>seeing</b> Elvis soon." [...] He {{was back on the}} road by mid-year, and performed before Pope John Paul II at the World Eucharistic Conference in Bologna, Italy.

500|$|The episode {{serves as}} a coda to the fourth season instead of a climax, as Whedon wanted to achieve {{something}} different for a season finale. Whedon experimented with several filming techniques to make the episode as dreamlike as possible. The episode also foreshadows upcoming events, most notably the first appearance of Buffy's sister Dawn. Buffy scholar Nikki Stafford calls the surrealistic episode [...] "unprecedented in television", saying it is [...] "so jam-packed with information that we'll probably <b>be</b> <b>seeing</b> allusions to {{it for the rest}} of the series", and referring to it as a [...] "mysterious lead-in to the emotionally turbulent season five". [...] "Restless" [...] received high praise from critics upon airing, particularly for its character development, visual direction, and wit. It is frequently noted as one of the best episodes of the series.|$|E

The video for the song served as the closing clip for the B'Day Anthology Video Album, and was filmed on Super 8 mm film in Miami. Beyoncé discussed the music video with MTV, stating that, [...] " [...] feels like something you shouldn't <b>be</b> <b>seeing,</b> like you found a home video. It's very raw: no retouching, no special effects. That's who I am. You can see my soul." [...] In an interview with Vibe Beyoncé recalled the video, [...] "I didn't have any hair and makeup.

But, you know, {{at the end of}} the day, in Storybrooke, she’s still trying to fill this void that Maleficent warned her about." [...] Leading up to the episode broadcast, Parrilla also gave a preview of what viewers could expect. Of the episode's plot, she explained, [...] "We will <b>be</b> <b>seeing</b> some dirty politics between Regina and Mr. Gold.
