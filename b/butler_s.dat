The maximum nullity of G over F is MF(G) =n-mrF(G). The minimum rank problem of a graph G is to determine mrF(G) (or equivalently, MF(G)).

40|$|Type of work : NonReferee Journal ArticleThis paper {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} subjectivity, identity coherence and embodiment {{in the context of}} space by analysing character development and characterisation in the television series Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Character transformation in Buffy goes beyond the traditional question of the abjectively transformed vampire body, and instead focuses on the major characters in terms of their embodied subjecthood and the question of subjectivity {{as a response to the}} cultural imperative of coherence, intelligibility and recognisability. As characters, Buffy and her friends come into physical contact with demons, vampires, monsters and creatures that are culturally-coded abject not by virtue of a good/evil or subject/abject dichotomy, but through their establishment in the narrative as that which puts into question the fantasy of coherent bodies and coherent subjectivity. I consider here how <b>Butler</b> <b>s</b> theories of subjective performativity and bodily materialisation can be figured within a cultural crisis of the subject by showing that performativity, as a citation of the signifier or category or norm as co-ordinate of selfhood, is conditioned not only by the cultural imperative to articulate a coherent, normalised and regimented body but in distinction from the cultural construction of the abject, or that which threatens coherent subjectivity...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} teen soap The O. C. s {{representation of}} gender and masculinity. The study employs a social constructivist view of gender, particularly inspired by Judith <b>Butler</b> <b>s</b> work. Moreover, theories on masculinity, masquerade and melodrama, feminist theory {{and the work of}} Camille Paglia also make up important theoretical groundwork which this thesis rests on. The main question I structure my thesis around is how gender and masculinity are represented in The O. C through the characters of Ryan and Seth. My approach to examining this question is through textual analysis. The analysis is divided into three main parts. One chapter explores the representation {{of gender and}} masculinity from the perspective of film history, focusing especially on how Ryan is influenced by Marlon Brando s star persona, while Seth s display of masculinity evokes Woody Allen s comic screen persona. In my second main chapter I examine their friendship from the framework of homosociality and homoeroticism, then I briefly suggest a third way of looking at their relationship, inspired by the term bro-mance. In my final chapter I analyze Ryan and Seth s look, style and fashion, pointing out how clothing plays a key element in expressing the flexibility of masculine identities...|$|E
40|$|We have cloned three {{copies of}} a {{repeated}} DNA segment from Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto strain B 31, present on both circular and linear plasmids of this and other B. burgdorferi sensu lato strains. The DNA sequences are characterized by a highly homologous segment containing two open reading frames (ORFs), ORF-A and ORF-B. Five additional ORFs {{can be found on}} the slightly less homologous flanking sequences: ORF-G on the opposite strand upstream of ORF-A, and ORF-C, ORF-D, ORF-E, and ORF-F downstream of ORF-B. The 4. 6 -kb-long element containing ORF-A through ORF-E is flanked by approximately 180 -bp-long imperfect inverted repeats (IRs). The putative gene product of ORF-C displays homology to proteins involved in plasmid maintenance in a number of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. ORF-E features several short, highly homologous direct repeats. ORF-A, ORF-B, and ORF-D are homologous to three ORFs on a recently described 8. 3 -kb circular plasmid of Borrelia afzelii Ip 21 that are flanked by similar IRs (J. J. Dunn, S. R. Buchstein, L. -L. <b>Butler,</b> <b>S.</b> Fisenne, D. S. Polin, B. N. Lade, and B. J. Luft, J. Bacteriol. 176 : 2706 - 2717, 1994).

Furthermore, the repeated DNA element as defined by the IRs is present in opposite orientations relative to the flanking sequences on the B 31 and Ip 21 plasmids...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{our study}} was to {{investigate}} the relation between substantia nigra (SN) echomorphology and indices of motor cortex excitability. Nigral hyperechogenicity in healthy individuals is thought to represent an SN abnormality or predisposition to Parkinson's disease (PD) and its prevalence is greater in the very old. Our study involved 20 old healthy subjects (aged 72 - 84 years) known to have normal (n= 10) or abnormal (n= 10) SN echomorphology. All were in good health with no overt neurological signs. SN morphology was assessed with transcranial sonography through the pre-auricular bone window. Motor cortical excitability and intracortical inhibition were assessed with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over the first dorsal interosseus motor area. Single stimuli were delivered during relaxation and voluntary contraction and paired stimuli were delivered during relaxation. Each cortical hemisphere was analysed separately. The response to single-pulse TMS (in motor cortex ipsilateral to the target SN) did not differ between groups. However, a significant difference between groups was observed in the paired pulse paradigm (conditioning stimulus intensity: 70 % resting motor threshold; interstimulus interval: 2 ms). The conditioned motor evoked potential amplitude was significantly larger ipsilateral to the hyperechogenic SN than in controls (P= 0. 014). Thus, healthy subjects with SN hyperechogenicity exhibit significantly less intracortical inhibition within the motor cortex than subjects with normal echomorphology. Decreased intracortical inhibition is also observed in PD patients. This study provides further evidence that SN hyperechogenicity in healthy individuals is associated with changes characteristic of PD supporting a role for this feature as a vulnerability marker or state marker for subtle nigral dopaminergic dysfunction.
