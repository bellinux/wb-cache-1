5|$|The BT46 was an {{aluminium}} alloy monocoque featuring the trapezoidal cross section common {{to many of}} Gordon Murray’s 1970s designs. It featured inbuilt pneumatic jacks fed from an external supply of compressed air to lift it off the ground for tyre changes during practice. It employed a very early version of the carbon brakes that were in universal use by the mid-1980s—a concept taken from the aircraft industry. The system, which Brabham had <b>been</b> <b>developing</b> since 1976, combined carbon composite brake pads with a steel disc faced with carbon composite 'pucks'.|$|E
