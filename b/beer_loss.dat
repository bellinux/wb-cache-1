40|$|Abstract. The brewing {{industry}} is typically high pollution and energy consumption industry, the pollutant makes huge impact to the environment. It {{is necessary to}} reduce the energy consumption and emissions in the {{brewing industry}}. In this paper, based on the cleaner production(CP) audit of a beer brewing enterprise in Dalian, both {{the sources of the}} main pollutant and the reason of high energy consumption was analyzed. 3 medium/high CP projects and 4 none/low CP projects were carried out through technology and management improvement. By cleaner production audit, water consumption and sewage emissions can be reduced by 375 thousand tons and 350 thousand tons per year. <b>Beer</b> <b>loss</b> reduction ratio was 0. 1 %,energy can be totally saved by 3325 tons per year. The aims of energy conservation, energy and emissions reduction can be absolutely accomplished...|$|E
50|$|In July 1915, a large tornado {{ripped through}} Ludlow. Over $20,000 in {{damage was done}} to the {{buildings}} in the park. The final event that spelled doom for the park was the First World War. For many years, the Lagoon served Bavarian Beer (Covington made) at various bars in the park. Grain, however, was needed for the war effort, so the United States Government halted the manufacturing of liquor and <b>beer.</b> The <b>loss</b> of alcohol sales spelled doom for the park. The Lagoon Amusement Park closed after the 1918 season.|$|R
5000|$|Derecho Common {{was issued}} by the Port City Brewing Company of Alexandria, VA after the power outages related to the June 2012 North American derecho {{resulted}} in a tank of Port City's beer fermenting as a steam <b>beer</b> due to <b>loss</b> of refrigeration. [...] Port City has since continued to release Derecho Common.|$|R
50|$|Ginebra and Purefoods {{first met}} on April 5, 1988, with Purefoods playing coach Fernandez {{matching}} coaching skills with Ginebra counterpart Jaworski. Purefoods won the match, 116-110, despite falling down by 16 {{points in the}} third quarter. Fernandez was voted best player of the game. The squads again faced {{each other in the}} semifinals of the 1988 Open Conference. Purefoods’ 111-109 overtime win sent the Hotdogs into the finals against San Miguel <b>Beer,</b> while a <b>loss</b> would have meant another playoff game with Ginebra for the second finals berth. After this game, some frustrated Ginebra fans at the gallery section pelted the court with plastic cups and coins.|$|R
50|$|Marston's is {{the only}} {{remaining}} brewer to use Burton Union Sets; a system whereby fermentation barrels and troughs are linked together by pipework. The basic principle is one of preventing excessive <b>beer</b> and yeast <b>loss</b> through foaming, but the consequence is that the beer is in contact with more wood and with more beer, fermenting in a bigger volume, typically totalling about 100 barrels or 16 hectolitres. That results in a more consistent flavour and very little chance of a whole batch being ruined. All other large-scale brewers have abandoned that method in favour of stainless steel fermenting vessels, which while they assure (through volume) a consistent flavour, limit the use of traditional yeast varieties. They make selective use of the unusual double dropping process (for example, {{in the production of}} Brakspear Bitter), which introduces complex flavours by a period of accelerated yeast growth.|$|R
25|$|In 1944, 2nd Battalion was {{transferred}} to 56th Independent Infantry Brigade, and at 11:00 on 6 June, during the Normandy landings, the brigade landed without incident in the second wave at Gold Beach. In the Battle of Normandy the battalion saw action at Tilly-sur-Seulles on 11 June during Operation Perch, along the Saint-Germain d'Ectot ridge on 30 July during Operation Bluecoat, and at Thury-Harcourt on 12 August in the prelude to Operation Tractable. In mid-August, having variously served under the commands of 50th (Northumbrian) Infantry Division, 7th Armoured Division and 59th (Staffordshire) Infantry Division, 56th Brigade came under command of 49th (West Riding) Infantry Division, with which it remained {{for the rest of}} the war. During the advance to the River Seine 2nd Battalion suffered 53 casualties capturing Épaignes on 25 August, and crossed the river at Rouen on 2 September. Eight days later it spearheaded the assault on Le Havre, and on 12 September it was the first British unit to enter the city's fort, capturing 1500 prisoners and much <b>beer</b> for the <b>loss</b> during the battle of 40 men killed and wounded.|$|R
40|$|Opaque sorghum beer is a {{significant}} component of the diet of millions of poor people in rural Africa. This study reports the effect of traditional brewing operations on its level of micronutrients, especially iron and zinc. The example of a West African sorghum beer, tchoukoutou, in Northern Benin was studied. The beer was characterized {{and the impact of}} process unit operations on phytate, phenolic compounds, and Zn and Fe in vitro solubility was evaluated. The major microorganisms involved in the beer fermentation were Saccharomyces cerevisiae and heterofermentative lactobacilli. The manufacturing process reduces the phytate content by nearly 95 %, particularly during germination, mashing-boiling and fermentation. The level of reactive phenolic groups increased as a result of germination and fermentation as well as from a shift in dry matter composition. Simultaneously with these modifications, an increase of Fe solubility was observed, and a correlation between phytate and Fe solubility (R 2 = 0. 85) was established. No clear correlation could be established between the Zn solubility and the phytate content of the products. During <b>beer</b> manufacturing, significant <b>losses</b> of minerals occur particularly during soaking and mashing/filtration; thus the quantity of minerals available to consumers is restricted. Improvements aiming to minimize such losses are highly desirabl...|$|R
5000|$|LAX {{refused to}} return the belts, hired a lawyer, and (kayfabe) {{threatened}} to sue TNA for violating their First Amendment rights. At that point, Cornette backed down and reinstated LAX as NWA World Tag Team Champions. On the next episode of Impact! they were placed in a match against Kurt Angle and Petey Williams with Cornette stating {{that he could not}} strip them of the titles but he could make them defend it. Throughout the broadcast LAX took out James Storm and Chris Harris, as well as Petey Williams right before the title match. LAX seemed to have the advantage on Angle when Samoa Joe came out to tag with Angle. Angle and Joe both proceeded to apply their respective submission holds and made both Homicide and Hernandez tap, thus apparently winning the NWA World Tag Team Championships. But soon after the bell sounded Cornette and LAX's lawyer appeared with the lawyer stating Joe was not signed to the contract and the match must be declared a disqualification on Angle to end the show. At Turning Point, LAX defeated America's Most Wanted in a flag match after they managed to hang the Mexican Flag, making the LAX the first non-American team to win a flag match on American soil. They had another victory over America's Most Wanted on December 14 in a [...] "Titles vs. Career" [...] match after James Storm deliberately hit Chris Harris with a <b>beer</b> bottle. The <b>loss</b> forced AMW to disband.|$|R
