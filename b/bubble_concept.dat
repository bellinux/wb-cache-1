Given the superreplication duality (16), as soon as M_UI(S)≠∅, then there is no <b>bubble.</b> The <b>concepts</b> of <b>bubble</b> itself and bubble birth change.

Here the “bubble misprice” on an asset is given by the fact that we can get the same wealth at the end, but by exploiting an investment strategy with a lower initial price. Still, we cannot profit from this opportunity because its generating strategy is not admissible: we need to go short on the asset and long on the superreplicating strategy to generate a sure profit at terminal time but by doing this we also face the risk of unbounded losses in (0,T).

The model predicted accurately the responses of temperature and product concentrations. The study of the reactor steady-state and dynamic behaviour showed that benzene conversion and maleic anhydride production rate could be used as controlled variables to optimize the yield. System identification techniques were used to obtain input-output linear models of the benzene conversion and maleic anhydride production rate as a function of feed rate and temperature set-point.

40|$|Historically, U.

After 2008, {{the wisdom of}} this approach came under attack. Critics argued that procyclical regulation left financial institutions undercapitalized and unable to withstand panics. Other critics asserted that economic downturns could be mitigated and even averted if regulators took steps to puncture asset <b>bubbles.</b> The <b>concept</b> of countercyclical regulation responds to both of these critiques. This new approach posits that {{financial regulation}} {{would be more effective}} if financial regulation clamped down during financial expansions and lightened up during economic slumps, when banks and other financial services firms are struggling financially and typically are at their most risk- averse. One objective of countercyclical regulation is to require financial firms to build up reserves during flush times, so that they can draw on those resources when downturns strike. A second potential objective is to modulate the growth of easy credit and the asset bubbles that it fuels in order to avoid a string of bank failures following a surge in loan delinquencies. Countercyclical regulation {{is the single most important}} breakthrough in years to ending cycles of boom and bust. As such, it deserves serious consideration. Implementing countercyclical regulation, however, is not as easy as it seems.

40|$|This {{review was}} {{motivated}} by the growing need for sustainable water supply technologies in arid lands worldwide. A key driver of this review is to evaluate the potential of presently unused freshwater sources such as from evaporative brine management technologies. In doing so, this paper provides a conceptual building block for innovative water systems in the future {{with a focus on}} ecologically, socially and economically sustainable freshwater production. The utilization of solar thermal and wind energy as the principal drivers for brackish and saline water desalination projects provides the link between the technologies and devices that are discussed and evaluated in this review. Of the solar still concepts reviewed, higher productivity rates are achieved with increased optimization of heat and mass transfer processes within the system and productivity is closely linked to the technological complexity of the stills. Water production ranges from 2 to 3 L/m 2 /day for passive stills up to 100 L/m 2 /day and more for novel systems with multiple latent heat use. Still–greenhouse systems and seawater greenhouse systems are capable of producing distilled water while providing a vital humid environment for the growth of crops in a greenhouse system. Water production rates of 0. 5 – 2. 5 L/m 2 /day for ‘still in a greenhouse’ systems and up to 55 L/m 2 /day for seawater greenhouses with improved passive condenser technology can be achieved.

40|$|The COUPP {{collaboration}} {{has successfully}} used bubble chambers, a technology previously {{applied only to}} high-energy physics experiments, as direct dark matter detectors. It has produced the world's most stringent spin-dependent WIMP limits, and increasingly competitive spin-independent limits. These limits were achieved by capitalizing on an intrinsic rejection of the gamma background that all other direct detection experiments must address through high-density shielding and empirically-determined data cuts. The history of COUPP, including its earliest prototypes and latest results, is briefly discussed in this thesis. The feasibility of a new, windowless <b>bubble</b> chamber <b>concept</b> simpler and more inexpensive in design is discussed here as well. The dark matter limits achieved with a 15 kg windowless chamber, larger than any previous COUPP chamber (2 kg, 4 kg), are presented. Evidence of the greater radiopurity of synthetic quartz compared to natural is presented using the data from this 15 kg device, the first chamber to be made from synthetic quartz. The effective reconstruction of the three-dimensional positions of bubbles in a highly distorted optical field, with ninety-degree bottom lighting similar to cloud chamber lighting, is demonstrated.

40|$|This work {{deals with}} a {{theoretical}} analysis {{about the possibility of}} using linear and nonlinear acoustic properties to modify ultrasound by adding gas bubbles of determined sizes in a liquid. We use a two-dimensional numerical model to evaluate the effect that one and several monodisperse bubble populations confined in restricted areas of a liquid have on ultrasound by calculating their nonlinear interaction. The filtering of an input ultrasonic pulse performed by a net of bubbly-liquid cells is analyzed. The generation of a low-frequency component from a single cell impinged by a two-frequency harmonic wave is also studied. These effects rely on the particular dispersive character of attenuation and nonlinearity of such bubbly fluids, which can be extremely high near bubble resonance. They allow us to observe how gas bubbles can change acoustic signals. Variations of the bubbly medium parameters induce alterations of the effects undergone by ultrasound. Results suggest that acoustic signals can be manipulated by bubbles.

40|$|Graduation date: 1972 A {{mathematical}} model {{was developed to}} predict the absorption rate of a slightly soluble gas entrained by a plunging liquid jet. The single parameter of the model, the transfer factor, TF, {{was defined as the}} summation of the product of the mass transfer coefficient and interfacial area over all the entrained <b>bubbles.</b> The <b>concept</b> of transfer factor reduced the mathematical description of the process to a tractable as well as representative form. The model was successfully applied to experimental data from present and previous studies of the entrainment of a gas in aqueous systems. Values of TF {{as a function of the}} jet stream characteristics were determined for three gases. The transfer factor was found to be proportional to the product of jet Weber number and. Reynolds number. The magnitude of TF was determined to be inversely proportional to the gas solubility as predicted by interphase mass transfer theory. Results suggested that the entrainment process exceeds the performance of most commercial absorbers when compared on the basis of gas absorbed/unit energy. The results of the present study indicate 3. 77 mg 0 ₂ absorbed/joule when absorbing pure oxygen gas in oxygen-free water from bubbles entrained by a plunging liquid jet. Specifically, oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon dioxide were entrained by a plunging water jet and absorbed in a pool of water. Circular, coherent jet streams varying from 1. 4 to 6. 8 mm OD at flow rates equivalent to a jet Reynolds number varying from 4, 000 to 20, 000 were used. The rate of gas absorption was calculated from the time rate of change of the pool concentration determined from gas chromatographic analyses of pool samples at various time periods.

40|$|Space Station and {{satellite}} reservicing {{will require the}} ability to vent gas on orbit from liquid supply or storage tanks and to gage liquid quantity under microgravity conditions. In zero gravity, (zero-g) the vortex vent is capable of venting gas from a tank of liquid containing gas randomly distributed as <b>bubbles.</b> The <b>concept</b> uses a spinning impeller to create centrifugal force inside a vortex tube within a tank. This creates a gas pocket and forces the liquid through a venturi {{and back into the}} tank. Gas is then vented from the gas pocket through a liquid detector and then out through an exhaust port. If the liquid detector senses liquid in the vent line, the fluid is directed to the low-pressure port on the venturi and is returned to the tank. The advantages of this system is that it has no rotating seals and is compatible with most corrosive and cryogenic fluids. A prototype was designed and built at the NASA Johnson Space Center and flown on the KC- 135 zero-g aircraft. During these test flights, where microgravity conditions are obtained for up to 30 sec, the prototype demonstrated that less than 0. 10 percent of the volume of fluid vented was liquid when the tank was half full of liquid. The pressure volume temperature (PVT) gaging system is used in conjunction with the vortex vent to calculate the amount of liquid remaining in a tank under microgravity conditions. The PVT gaging system is used in conjunction with the vortex vent to gage liquid quantity in zero or low gravity. The system consists of a gas compressor, accumulator, and temperature and pressure instrumentation. To measure the liquid in a tank a small amount of gas is vented from the tank to the compressor and compressed into the accumulator. Pressure and temperature in the tank and accumulator are measured before and after the gas transfer occurs. Knowing the total volume of the tank, the volume of the accumulator, the volume of the intermediate lines, and initial and final pressures and temperatures, the mass of the gas leaving the tank is equated to the mass of the gas entering the accumulator. The volume of liquid remaining in the tank is calculated using the ideal gas law...|$|R
40|$|Though {{a common}} view holds that bubbles bagan their {{formation}} from 1986, we cannot easily agree. Share prices, at least, began to contain bubbles from 1984. Though share prices during 1983 - 85 stayed within changes of so-called fundamentals, current profit of companies, {{which is one}} of the two fundamentals, contained profit from that very rise of share prices. Explaining <b>bubbles</b> through the <b>concept</b> of "fundamentals" will inevitably go around in circles. We should rather pay attention to the fact that at the end of 1984, the ratio of the total sum of shares to GNP, listed on all the stock exchanges, valued at current market prices, amounted to 56. 1 % which is an unprecedented high figure. The bubbles in share prices owed greatly to the positive absorption of overseas short-term fund by foreign exchange banks from 1984. They took advantage of the abolition, in 1984, of so-called yen-ten regulation, which had long restricted, to a degree, the banks' conversion of dollars, taken in from overseas financial centers, into yen. After the abolition some parts of the converted money were vigorously invested into domestic stock market. Greater part of the money taken in was appropriated to their own external investment, and the rest to security investment, particularly in shares. Consequently, share prices were raised. It is not that big banks were excluded from financing to big firms but that they remained doing so, transforming themselves into by far the biggest undertaker of so-called equity finance.

40|$|Nuclear {{power systems}} will be {{required}} to provide much greater power levels for both civilian and defense space activities in the future than an currently needed. Limitations on the amount of usable power from radioisotope thermal generators and the limited availability of radioisotope heat source materials lead directly to the conclusion that nuclear power reactors will be needed to enhance the exploration of the solar system as well as to provide for an adequate defense. Lunar bases and travel to the Martian surface will be greatly enhanced by the use of high levels of nuclear power. Space based radar systems requiring many kilowatts of electrical power can provide intercontinental airline traffic control and defense early warning systems. Since the, figure of merit used in defining any space power system is the specific power, the decrease in die mass of any reactor system component will yield a tremendous benefit to the overall system performance. Also, since the heat rejection system of any power system can make up {{a large portion of the}} total system mass, any reduction in the mass of the heat rejection radiators will significantly affect the performance of the power system. Composite materials which combine the high strength, flexibility, and low mass characteristics of Si% based fibers with the attractive compatibility and heat transfer features of metallic foils, have been proposed for use m a number of space radiator applications. Thus, the weave of the fabric and the high strength capability of the individual fibers are combined with the high conductivity and chemical stability of a metallic liner to provide a light weight, flexible alternative to heavy, rigid, metallic radiator structural containers. The primary focus of this investigation revolves around two applications of the fabric composite materials, notably a fabric heat pipe radiator design and the <b>Bubble</b> Membrane Radiator <b>concept...</b>|$|R
40|$|Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) is an {{electricity}} generation technology that concentrates solar irradiation through heliostats onto a small area, the receiver, where a {{heat transfer fluid}} is used as heat carrier towards the heat storage and power block. It has been under the spotlight for a decade {{as one of the}} most potential or promising renewable and sustainable energy technology. The use of gas/solid suspensions as heat transfer fluid in CSP has been advocated for the first time in the 1980 's and this novel application relies on its possible use throughout the full CSP plant, i. e. in heat capture, conveying, storage and heat reuse, where it offers major advantages in comparison with water/steam, thermal fluids or molten salt, the current heat transfer fluids. Since the powder suspension has a heat capacity similar to that of molten salts, without temperature limitation except for the maximum allowable wall temperature of the receiver tube, suspension temperatures of about 800 °C can be tolerated, with additional high efficiency thermodynamic systems being applicable. This work reviews the development of CSP and assesses both its energy efficiency and the impact of the direct normal solar irradiance on the power yield of a CSP plant. A literature review of fluidized bed systems and their use as heat transfer medium is also included. A novel <b>bubbling</b> fluidized bed <b>concept,</b> the upflow <b>bubbling</b> fluidized bed is selected for use in a solar power tower plant for its excellent heat transfer and potential in moderate to high receiver capacities. Circulating fluidized beds could be interesting for very large scale operations. The selection accounts for sizes, complexity and operating costs. Both upflow bubbling fluidized bed and circulating fluidized bed of fine particles feature excellent heat transfer. At the 1 MW solar furnace, PROMES CNRS France reported that a high heat transfer coefficient of 1100 W/m²K was achieved with an upflow bubbling fluidized bed receiver at superficial gas velocities below 0. 2 m/s and solids circulation flux of 10 to 45 kg/m²s. A moderate heat transfer coefficient of 60 to 300 W/m²K was obtained in the circulating fluidized bed operation mode in this PhD. The values of the obtained heat transfer coefficients are dealt with by both empirical and mechanistic modeling approach, with fair to very good agreements obtained. Furthermore, the mechanistic surface renewal model provides guidelines in terms of dimensional scaling up, which is also a major contribution of the PhD. The particle circulation loop throughout the CSP installation is also examined for the remaining sections of the power generation concept, i. e. in the hot and cold storage hoppers, in the boilers of the thermal block, or as direct heat supply to the hot-side heat exchanger of a Stirling engine. Whereas in heat capture, mostly upflow bubbling or circulating fluidized beds seem appropriate, both moving beds or downcomers, and bubbling fluidized beds are recommended in the heat storage and re-use, and experimentally quantified. The novel concepts of thermal energy storage, using latent heat in phase change materials, or storing thermo-chemical heat through using reversible chemical reactions has been investigated with extensive interest. The thermal energy from a solar collection field or from transforming excess renewable electricity from wind turbines into heat can be stored for short or even long terms in such systems. However the concept applied at high temperatures is still at its early stage. Experimental phase change materials research was conducted and results illustrate the effect of different parameters. Another approach to thermal energy storage is the use of reversible chemical reactions, and they can be regenerated through the exothermic reverse reaction process. Unlike sensible or latent heat storage, mostly limited in time due to heat losses, chemical energy storage enables to bridge long duration gaps between supply and demand, hence making it particularly suitable for a stable {{electricity generation}}. Thermodynamic calculations and thermogravimetric analysis were conducted on selected reaction pairs. Results are of fundamental nature only, and it is far too early to imagine a pilot or large-scale application of thermo-chemical storage in the CSP concept. Since phase transformation or chemical reactions are involved, the materials need to be properly contained. The containment is discussed with respect to the selection concerns and criteria. The containing material or geometry should satisfy the required need of being closed and able to withstand the high temperatures envisaged, to resist possible chemical attacks by the contained materials, and to resist the pressure build up during the phase transition or reactions, in which expansion often occurs or gases and vapours are released. The PhD research is concluded by scale-up data and provides a preliminary view into the prospects and the overall economy of the system. Market prospects for both novel concentrated solar power and thermal energy storage applications are expected to be excellent. Although the PhD research provided lab-scale based design methods and equations for the key unit operations of a novel solar power tower CSP concept, there is ample scope for future development of several topics, as finally recommended. status: publishe...|$|R
