5|$|Of the {{military}} texts written before {{the unification of}} China and Shi Huangdi's subsequent book <b>burning</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> second century BC, six major works have survived. During the much later Song dynasty, these six works were combined with a Tang text into a collection called the Seven Military Classics. As {{a central part of}} that compilation, The Art of War formed the foundations of orthodox military theory in early modern China. Illustrating this point, the book was required reading to pass the tests for imperial appointment to military positions.|$|E
5|$|At 4:00 am on 25 August, {{the newly}} erected French gun battery {{opened fire on}} Sirius and Iphigenia, which {{returned}} fire as best they could. Accepting that Sirius was beyond repair, Pym removed all her personnel and military supplies, setting fire to the frigate at 9:00 am, shortly after Iphigenia had pulled beyond {{the range of the}} battery, using a cannon as an anchor after losing hers the previous day. French boats attempted to reach Sirius and capture her before she exploded, although they turned back when Pym launched his own boats to contest possession of the wreck. The frigate's remaining munitions exploded at 11:00 am. During the morning, Duperré sent an official boarding party aboard Nereide, who wet the decks to prevent any risk of fire from the ships <b>burning</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> harbour and removed 75 corpses from the frigate.|$|E

5|$|Jason X (2002) marked Kane Hodder's last {{performance}} as Jason. The film starts off in 2010; Jason has returned after another unexplained resurrection. Captured by the U.S. government in 2008, Jason is being experimented upon {{in a research}} facility, {{where it has been}} determined that he has regenerative capabilities and that cryonic suspension is the only possible solution to stop him, since numerous attempts to execute him have proved unsuccessful. Jason escapes, killing all but one of his captors, and slices through the cryo-chamber, spilling cryonics fluid into the room, freezing himself and the only other survivor, Rowan (Lexa Doig). A team of students 445 years later discover Jason's body. On the team's spacecraft, Jason thaws from his cryonic suspension and begins killing the crew. Along the way, he is enhanced by a regenerative nanotechnology process, which gives him an impenetrable metal body. Finally, he is ejected into space and falls to the planet Earth 2, <b>burning</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|S. g. ashbyi, (critically endangered), {{the western}} Victorian pied currawong, was {{described}} by Australian amateur ornithologist Gregory Mathews in 1913. It is threatened by hybridization with the neighbouring subspecies nebulosa whose range is expanding westwards. A 2000 estimate placed the number of breeding birds at around 250. It resembles subspecies nebulosa, with sooty plumage, a long tail and a short bill. There is some doubt over whether ashbyi, which is little known, is a distinct subspecies or a colour morph of nebulosa. It {{is thought to have}} evolved after the two populations became separated by basalt plains in western Victoria, with the return of trees after the abandonment of regular Aboriginal <b>burning</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> late 18th century contributing to the remixing of populations. Hybrid forms have been identified in the Grampians and Yarra Valley.|$|E
5|$|The {{chemical}} {{reacts with}} moisture {{on the skin}} and in the eyes, causing a burning sensation and the immediate forceful and uncontrollable shutting of the eyes. Effects usually include tears streaming from the eyes, profuse coughing, exceptional nasal discharge that is full of mucus, <b>burning</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> eyes, eyelids, nose and throat areas, disorientation, dizziness and restricted breathing. It will also burn the skin where sweaty and/or sunburned. In highly concentrated doses it can also induce severe coughing and vomiting. Almost all of the immediate effects wear off within an hour (such as exceptional nasal discharge and profuse coughing), although the feeling of burning and highly irritated skin may persist for hours.

5|$|The commotion {{caused by}} the stoor worm's writhing agonies draws a crowd to the beach, and Assipattle lands safely among them. The ferocity of the fire <b>burning</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> creature's liver increases, causing smoke clouds to be {{expelled}} from its mouth and nostrils, turning the skies black. The islanders, believing {{that the world is}} about to end, clamber up a hillside to watch the final death throes of the creature at a safe distance from the resulting tidal waves and earthquakes. As it dies, the creature's teeth fall out to become the islands of Orkney, Shetland and the Faroes. The Baltic Sea is created where its tongue falls out, and when the creature finally curls up into a tight knot and dies, its body becomes Iceland. True to his word, once the skies clear and the earth settles, the king relinquishes his kingdom to Assipattle, who marries Princess Gem-de-lovely. As promised, the king also gives Odin's magic sword to Assipattle.|$|E
5|$|Gradually, the {{hydrogen}} <b>burning</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> shell around the solar core {{will increase the}} mass of the core until it reaches about 45% of the present solar mass. At this point the density and temperature will become so high that the fusion of helium into carbon will begin, leading to a helium flash; the Sun will shrink from around 250 to 11times its present (main-sequence) radius. Consequently, its luminosity will decrease from around 3,000 to 54 times its current level, and its surface temperature will increase to about 4770K. The Sun will become a horizontal giant, burning helium in its core in a stable fashion much like it burns hydrogen today. The helium-fusing stage will last only 100million years. Eventually, it will have to again resort to the reserves of hydrogen and helium in its outer layers and will expand a second time, turning into what is known as an asymptotic giant. Here the luminosity of the Sun will increase again, reaching about 2,090 present luminosities, and it will cool to about 3500K. This phase lasts about 30million years, after which, {{over the course of a}} further 100,000years, the Sun's remaining outer layers will fall away, ejecting a vast stream of matter into space and forming a halo known (misleadingly) as a planetary nebula. The ejected material will contain the helium and carbon produced by the Sun's nuclear reactions, continuing the enrichment of the interstellar medium with heavy elements for future generations of stars.|$|E

25|$|Of {{all of the}} {{mechanisms}} of human-mediated disturbances, anthropogenic fire {{has become one of}} great interest to ecologists, geographers, soil scientists, and anthropologists alike. By studying the effects of anthropogenic fires, anthropologists have been able to identify landscape uses and requirements of past cultures. Ecologists became interested in the study of anthropogenic fire as to utilize methods from previous cultures to develop policies for regular burning. Geographers and soil scientists are interested in the utility of anthropic soils caused by <b>burning</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> past. The interest in anthropogenic fire came about {{in the wake of the}} Industrial Revolution. This time period included a mass migration from rural to urban areas, which decreased controlled <b>burning</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> countryside. This led to an increase in the frequency and strength of wildfires, thus initiating a need to develop proper prevention methods. Historical ecology focuses on the impact on landscapes through human-mediated disturbances, once such being anthropogenic fire. It is a fusion of ecological, geographical, anthropological, and pedological interests.|$|E

30|$|The {{results from}} our 13 -year small plot study {{indicate}} that <b>burning</b> later <b>in</b> <b>the</b> year appears to have positive effects on mitigating woody plant encroachment, increasing forb diversity, reducing exotic grasses, and increasing native tallgrass species. Moreover, frequent <b>burning</b> <b>in</b> a very narrow late-winter to early-spring window may not actually reduce or limit woody plant encroachment and can reduce forb diversity. These results challenge the current burning paradigm that late winter and early spring are the most effective times to burn to maintain tallgrass prairie <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Great Plains. Other studies using fire during {{the spring and summer}} found that repeated burning during this time did not reduce the cover or frequency of any woody species, just as our study found (Engle and Bidwell 2001, Towne and Kemp 2008). Also, the potential benefit of <b>burning</b> later <b>in</b> <b>the</b> year on flowering forbs and tallgrasses has implications for biodiversity, particularly for pollinators and wildlife habitat (Towne and Kemp 2008, Howe 2011).|$|R
30|$|In {{contrast}} to our study, {{other studies have}} reported reductions in S. orbiculatus with fire. Late spring <b>burning</b> <b>in</b> tallgrass prairie reduced S. orbiculatus due to lower carbohydrate reserves because plants had already leafed out (Hulbert [1984]) which is different than our early spring burns and no apparent reductions. Furthermore, two successive years of spring <b>burning</b> <b>in</b> April in a forested corridor of Kansas reduced S. orbiculatus canopy cover from 40 % to 9 % but did not alter shrub species richness (Abrams [1988]). Thus, <b>burning</b> later <b>in</b> <b>the</b> season or <b>burning</b> a site repeatedly for successive years may result in reductions of S. orbiculatus. However, at our research sites, most <b>burning</b> is done <b>in</b> <b>the</b> early spring {{and may not be}} possible in late spring due to Schedonorus arundinaceus (tall fescue) greenup and alteration of fire behavior (McGranahan et al. [2012]). Furthermore, {{it can be difficult to}} graze and burn complete pastures for successive years (Ansley et al. [2010]).|$|R
