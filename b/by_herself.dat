5|$|Raising six {{children}} <b>by</b> <b>herself</b> exhausted Shabazz. Providing for them was difficult as well. Shabazz's {{share of the}} royalties from The Autobiography of MalcolmX was equivalent to an annual salary. In 1966, she sold the movie rights to the Autobiography to film-maker Marvin Worth. She began to authorize the publication of MalcolmX's speeches, which provided another source of income.|$|E

5|$|Another {{theory is}} that Madeleine, nearly four at the time, left the {{apartment}} <b>by</b> <b>herself,</b> perhaps to look for her parents, and was abducted by a passer-by or fell {{into one of the}} open construction sites nearby. This is widely regarded as unlikely. According to her mother, Madeleine would have had to open the unlocked patio doors, close the curtains behind her, close the door again, open and close the child gate {{at the top of the}} stairs, then open and close the gate leading to the street.|$|E
5|$|Elaine is the {{governor}} of the Tri-Island Area, a fictional group of pirate islands in the Caribbean. She is loved by the undead pirate LeChuck, who never ceases to pursue her affections and attempts to turn her into his undead bride, but Elaine instead falls in love with hapless protagonist Guybrush Threepwood. Elaine is consistently kidnapped by LeChuck, prompting Guybrush to attempt a rescue, although Elaine is usually more than capable of escaping predicaments <b>by</b> <b>herself.</b> She eventually marries Guybrush and relinquishes her gubernatorial responsibilities to her grandfather, travelling with Guybrush to the fictional Gulf of Melange to cure the outbreak of a voodoo-empowered pox.|$|E

He grabs her just as her brother walks in, but Hunsecker, encouraged by Susan's silence, accuses Falco of trying to assault Susan and begins beating the physically weaker Falco. Falco pleads that he only came to the apartment at Hunsecker's request, prompting Hunsecker to tell Falco that he never called him. As Susan stops Hunsecker from further harming him, Falco realizes that Susan placed the call {{in order to bring}} the men to blows.|$|E
5|$|Following the women's suggestion, Emma {{searches}} for and finds Walt's journal containing {{all of his}} pumpkin growing secrets. She discovers that Walt documented all of his strategies in code. After Seth helps to translate {{a portion of the}} journal, he tries to partner with her, but she refuses believing she must grow the pumpkins <b>by</b> <b>herself.</b> Emma is unable to spread manure as she falls down while attempting to use the tiller. During a poker game Seth wins a bet which forces Emma to collaborate with him for the contest. While they work together, Seth participates in Emma's radio program.

5|$|On an {{ordinary}} day at Springfield Elementary, Lisa {{attempts to make}} friends with a new girl, Francine (who is much larger and tougher than Lisa), but Francine beats up Lisa severely. Even attempting to share an interest in Malibu Stacy does not work since the doll that Francine has turns out to be Lisa's, which she then ruins. Lisa attempts to hire the school bullies (Nelson, Jimbo, Dolph, and Kearney) to protect her, but they decline since girls fight dirtier than boys (and boys tend to be more vulnerable to falling in love). It is up to Lisa to investigate <b>by</b> <b>herself</b> the reason why Francine is targeting her.|$|E

5|$|The Andean cock-of-the-rock {{exhibits}} marked sexual dimorphism; {{the male}} {{has a large}} disk-like crest and scarlet or brilliant orange plumage, while the female is significantly darker and browner. Gatherings of males compete for breeding females with each male displaying its colourful plumage, bobbing and hopping, and making a variety of calls. After mating, the female makes a nest under a rocky overhang, incubates the eggs, and rears the young, all <b>by</b> <b>herself.</b>|$|E

5|$|The last heroine in Clannad is {{a first-year}} student named Fuko Ibuki {{who has a}} distant {{attitude}} towards others and, before she met Tomoya, was generally seen alone <b>by</b> <b>herself</b> making wood carvings of starfish with a small knife to give to others as presents. Fuko is extremely enthralled by starfish, or things that are star-shaped, and will often go into short euphoric bouts where her awareness of her surroundings is completely overtaken.|$|E
5|$|They {{continue}} spending afternoons on {{the beach}} where, {{in the midst of}} scantily-clad teenage girls, their thoughts invariably turn to sex. All of them are virgins: Oscy is obsessed with the act of sex, while Hermie finds himself developing romantic interest in the bride, whose husband he spots leaving the island on a water taxi one morning. Later that day, Hermie finds her trying to carry bags of groceries <b>by</b> <b>herself,</b> and helps get them back to her house.

5|$|After {{completing}} the game once, the player can access the Chrysler Building and {{have access to}} the final boss, who takes the form of Aya's sister, Maya. She explains to Aya that Klamp cultivated the liver cells of the original Eve to analyze. When Melissa was giving birth to the Ultimate Being, she created a nest there. In case Melissa and the Ultimate Being failed, the purebred would remain. Aya speaks with her sister, and they engage in battle against the purebred. After the purebred is defeated, the mitochondria inside Aya's body begin to rebel against her. It is explained that Aya's mitochondria have now reached a higher evolutionary stage than Maya’s, but Maya's personality has suddenly become dominant and begun to fight off the Eve persona. Maya eventually wins, purging the Eve persona from herself. Somehow, Maya protects Aya by preventing the original Eve from taking over her. Aya leaves the building <b>by</b> <b>herself,</b> although she apparently has gained some sort of connection with her dead sister.|$|E

5|$|In 1926 he left Cambridge for the University of Göttingen {{to study}} under Max Born. Göttingen {{was one of}} the world's leading centers for {{theoretical}} physics. Oppenheimer made friends who went on to great success, including Werner Heisenberg, Pascual Jordan, Wolfgang Pauli, Paul Dirac, Enrico Fermi and Edward Teller. He was known for being too enthusiastic in discussion, sometimes to the point of taking over seminar sessions. This irritated some of Born's other students so much that Maria Goeppert presented Born with a petition signed <b>by</b> <b>herself</b> and others threatening a boycott of the class unless he made Oppenheimer quiet down. Born left it out on his desk where Oppenheimer could read it, and it was effective without a word being said.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, Morgan led the U.S. in goals (28), multi-goal matches (9), assists (21) {{and points}} (77). Her {{calendar}} year goals, assists and points totals are the third-best, tied second-best (one tally shy of record), and second-best, respectively, in U.S. WNT history.

Morgan and Wambach combined for 55 goals in 2012– matching a 21-year-old record set in 1991 by Michelle Akers (39 goals) and Carin Jennings (16 goals) as the most goals scored by any duo in U.S. WNT history. She had either scored or assisted on 41 percent of the USA's 120 goals this year.
