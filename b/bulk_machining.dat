50|$|Though MEMS {{processes}} are generally classified {{into a number}} of categories - such as surface machining, <b>bulk</b> <b>machining,</b> LIGA, and EFAB - there are indeed thousands of different MEMS processes. Some produce fairly simple geometries, while others offer more complex 3-D geometries and more versatility. A company making accelerometers for airbags would need a completely different design and process to produce an accelerometer for inertial navigation. Changing from an accelerometer to another inertial device such as a gyroscope requires an even greater change in design and process, and most likely a completely different fabrication facility and engineering team.|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} design {{methodology}} and manufacturing {{process for the}} construction of articulated three-dimensional microstructures with features on the micron to centimeter scale. Flexure mechanisms and assembly folds result from the <b>bulk</b> <b>machining</b> and lamination of alternating rigid and compliant layers, similar to rigid-flex printed circuit board construction. Pop-up books and other forms of paper engineering inspire designs consisting of one complex part with a single assembly degree of freedom. Like an unopened pop-up book, mechanism links reside on multiple interconnected layers, reducing interference and allowing folding mechanisms of greater complexity than achievable with a single folding layer. Machined layers are aligned using dowel pins and bonded in parallel. Using mechanical alignment that persists during bonding allows device layers to be anisotropically pre-strained, a feature we exploit to create self-assembling structures. These methods and three example devices are presented. 1...|$|E
40|$|The {{ability of}} 8 {{picosecond}} pulse lasers for three dimensional direct-writing in {{the bulk of}} transparent dielectrics is assessed through a comparative study with a femtosecond laser delivering 600 fs pulses. The comparison addresses two main applications: the fabrication of birefringent optical elements and two-step machining by laser exposure and post-processing by chemical etching. Formation of self-organized nano-gratings in glass by ps-pulses is demonstrated. Differential etching between ps-laser exposed regions and unexposed silica is observed. Despite attaining values of retardance (> 100 nm) and etching rate (2 µm/min) similar to fs pulses, ps pulses are found unsuitable for <b>bulk</b> <b>machining</b> in silica glass primarily due to the build-up of a stress field causing scattering, cracks and non-homogeneous etching. Additionally, we show that the so-called “quill-effect”, that is the dependence of the laser damage {{from the direction of}} writing, occurs also for ps-pulse laser machining. Finally, an opposite dependence of the retardance from the intra-pulse distance is observed for fs- and ps-laser direct writing...|$|E

40|$|Solid {{freeform}} fabrication processes (SFF) {{have been the}} subject of much research and discussion within recent years. Unlike other near net shape manufacturing processes (i. e. conventional injection molding, casting, or <b>bulk</b> <b>machining),</b> SFF techniques fabricate parts "from the ground up" by the sequential deposition and curing of raw material slurry layers upon each other until the final part results. Precise spatial control of deposited layers is achieved through CAD software and hardware interfaced with the SFF apparatus. The development of suitable SFF compatible raw material formulations and appropriate processing parameters are discussed in this dissertation. In particular, a wide range of materials have been fabricated and characterized at AML and ACR using this technique including alumina., crosslinked acrylate, and high molecular weight Nylon 6 thermoplastics. Comparisons are made between the mechanical properties of the SFF and corresponding commercial conventionally processed materials. Finally, the heat transfer and polymerization kinetics associated with three model SFF resin formulations are discussed and compared to corresponding empirical SFF process observations...|$|E
40|$|Optical biochips may {{incorporate}} both {{optical and}} microfluidic components {{as well as}} integrated light emitting semiconductor devices. They make use {{of a wide range}} of materials including polymers, glasses and thin metal films which are particularly suitable if low cost devices are envisaged. Precision laser micromachining is an ideal flexible manufacturing technique for such materials with the ability to fabricate structures to sub-micron resolutions and a proven track record in manufacturing scale up. Described here is the manufacture of a range of optical biochip devices and components using laser micromachining techniques. The devices employ both microfluidics and electrokinetic processes for biological cell manipulation and characterization. Excimer laser micromachining has been used to create complex microelectrode arrays and microfluidic channels. Excimer lasers have also been employed to create on-chip optical components such as microlenses and waveguides to allow integrated vertical and edge emitting LEDs and lasers to deliver light to analysis sites within the biochips. Ultra short pulse lasers have been used to structure wafer level semiconductor light emitting devices. Both surface patterning and <b>bulk</b> <b>machining</b> of these active wafers while maintaining functionality has been demonstrated. Described here is the use of combinations of ultra short pulse and excimer lasers for the fabrication of structures to provide ring illumination of in-wafer reaction chambers. The laser micromachining processes employed in this work require minimal post-processing and so make them ideally suited to all stages of optical biochip production from development through to small and large volume production...|$|E
40|$|Three Dimensional Printing (3 DP) is {{a process}} that enables the {{fabrication}} of geometrically complex parts directly from computer-aided design (CAD) models. The success of 3 DP as an alternative manufacturing technology to <b>bulk</b> <b>machining</b> of materials for complex parts has been demonstrated. By proof of concept, 3 DP has demonstrated the ability to create parts with Local Control of the Composition (LCC). LCC allows tailoring the material properties in regions of a part for functional purposes. In this work, LCC was studied and demonstrated by fabricating bimetallic bars consisting of two layers of Fe-Ni alloys with different composition and, hence, different thermal expansion properties; the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) of Fe-Ni system is sensitive to its composition. Two types of the binder/dopant slurries were made for making the LCC bars. One type consisted of dispersions of Fe₂O₃ particles in water, and the other consisted of dispersion of NiO in water. The LCC bars were successfully made by printing the Fe₂O₃/NiO slurries into Fe- 30 Ni base powders. After heat treatment to impart strength to the printed bars, the bars were successfully retrieved from unbound powders. The bars, then, were annealed at 1400 ⁰C for 2 hours for sintering and homogenization. The final composition of the base powders were changed accordingly. In the layers on which an Fe₂O₃ slurry was printed, the Fe composition of the layers increased on average to 72 wt%. Similarly, the Ni composition of the Ni-enriched layers of the bars increased on average to 33 wt%. The densification and local homogenization resulting from reduction and sintering treatments were not satisfactory. (cont.) The major problem was presumably caused by the oxide residues. The presence of the oxide powders was evident from the microprobe measurement. The oxide residues caused the local compositions to be inhomogeneous. As a result, the compositional profiles showed considerable scatter. Moreover, the residues impeded the sintering rate of the bars; the sintering densities of the bars were as small as 78 % of the theoretical density. The resulting bimetallic bars did exhibit bending deflection on uniform heating. However, the bending deflections were much smaller than expected. Evidently, the compositional profiles of the bars critically influence their thermal bending properties. The scatter in the compositional profiles resulted in local variations of CTE in the bars, which degraded the thermal bending properties. A linear elastic model that allows prediction of the deflection as a function of composition profile shows good agreement with the observed deflections in the bimetallic bars with LCC. by Ratchatee Techapiesancharoenkij.

40|$|Adhesive {{wafer bonding}} {{is a good}} {{substitute}} in wafer-towafer bonding applications requiring low processing temperatures and electrical potentials, though {{at the expense of}} difficulty with chemical, mechanical, and thermal stability over time. In the case of wafer bonding for Micro-Electro-Mechanical System (MEMS) applications, the problem is compounded not just by consideration of bond strength, but also by limitations in the way adhesives are delivered to the interface, since traditional spin-coating methods cannot be directly employed. A typical approach is the formation of microfluidic channels via wafer bonding, where the adhesive layer should only be present on the mesa structures. The introduction of BCB (benzocyclobutene), dry-etchable polymers, makes it possible to pattern the adhesive layer in a similar fashion {{with the rest of the}} bulk material. In this paper we present a BCB-based wafer bonding process, which is compatible with <b>bulk</b> micro <b>machining.</b> Depending on applications, BCB can replace the silicon oxide or silicon nitride as a hard mask in <b>bulk</b> micro <b>machining.</b> A process using BCB as both bonding adhesive and bulk-etch mask is a good option for stacking microstructures such as building micro-fluidic circuitry...|$|R

40|$|SETTING: A {{high-throughput}} laboratory routinely performing {{fluorescence microscopy}} for acid-fast bacilli (AFB) smear with automated bulk staining. OBJECTIVES: To determine {{the risk of}} false-positive AFB sputum smears from bulk staining showing as smear-positive, culture-negative specimens, or a decrease in smear- and culture-positives. DESIGN: Direct AFB smear and Löwenstein-Jensen culture were performed {{for a total of}} 39 350 routine sputum specimens. Of these, 6633 were randomly selected for individual AFB staining, while the remaining 32 717 were processed by <b>bulk</b> <b>machine</b> staining. Positives for smear and culture were compared. RESULTS: Overall, 111 specimens yielded a positive individually stained smear; of these, 100 (90. 1 %, 95 %CI 83. 0 - 95. 0) were also culture-positive compared to 504 / 543 smear-positives after bulk staining (92. 8 %, 95 %CI 90. 6 - 95. 0). The proportions of smear-positive, culture-negative and smear- and culture-positive specimens were respectively 1. 8 % vs. 2. 2 % and 90. 1 % vs. 92. 8 %, for individual and bulk staining (non-significant). CONCLUSIONS: The risk of transferring AFB from positive to negative smears during bulk AFB staining is negligible, if it occurs at all.
