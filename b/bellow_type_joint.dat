The quartz actuators with large displacement have not been developed because quartz has small piezoelectric constants compared to other materials such as PZT.

40|$|The present {{research}} {{is focused on}} the behavior of a <b>type</b> of <b>joint</b> between hollow sections. A theoretical model is created with the finite element method simulating a beam to column joint. The member which acts as the beam or as the brace of the joint (bi) is the same type of section with the other one act as the column or the chord (bo). Both members are square hollow sections. Firstly, the effect of the shear force due to the bending moment is examined with additionally the effect or the geometric ratio (β = bi/bo) and the thickness ratio (τ = ti/to) in the resistance of normal <b>type</b> <b>joint.</b> According to the parametric analysis followed, the design resistances of these <b>types</b> of <b>joints</b> are compared to those mentioned to EC 3 and those proposed of the research study worldwide in the same <b>type</b> of <b>joints</b> under axial loads. Joints are classified according the pre-mentioned limits for open sections and the resultant moment-rotation curves. An experimental study of these normal joints is made. <b>Joints</b> of “X” <b>type</b> in scale 1 : 1 and geometric ratios β = 0. 66 and β = 1. 0 are examined including 4 moment <b>type</b> <b>joints.</b> In sequence, the previous <b>type</b> of <b>joints</b> are examined with the chord-column member rotated by 45 o consisting a “bird-beak” joint.

50|$|Welded bellows (also called edge-welded, or {{diaphragm}} bellows) {{are manufactured}} by welding {{a number of}} individually formed diaphragms to each other. The comparison between the two <b>bellows</b> <b>types</b> generally centers on cost and performance. Hydroformed bellows generally have a high tooling cost, but, when mass-produced, may have a lower piece price. However, hydroformed bellows have lower performance characteristics due to relatively thick walls and high stiffness. Welded metal bellows are produced with a lower initial tooling cost and maintain higher performance characteristics. The drawback of welded bellows is the reduced metal strength at weld joints, caused by the high temperature of welding.|$|R

50|$|The {{metal bellows}} {{accumulators}} function similarly to the compressed gas type, except the elastic diaphragm or floating piston {{is replaced by}} a hermetically sealed welded metal bellows. Fluid may be internal or external to the bellows. The advantages to the metal <b>bellows</b> <b>type</b> include exceptionally low spring rate, allowing the gas charge to do all the work with little change in pressure from full to empty, and a long stroke relative to solid (empty) height, which gives maximum storage volume for a given container size. The welded metal bellows accumulator provides an exceptionally high level of accumulator performance, and can be produced with a broad spectrum of alloys resulting in a broad range of fluid compatibility. Another advantage to this type {{is that it does not}} face issues with high pressure operation, thus allowing more energy storage capacity.|$|R

Aims: We conducted a cohort study to describe the clinical manifestations, incidence of persistent arthralgia, and the associated risk factors among patients with CHIK identified during an outbreak {{in a suburb of}} Chennai, India. Materials and Methods: We conducted a retrospective cum prospective cohort study in Gowripet, Avadi, Chennai. We included all adult CHIK case patients identified during the outbreak. We conducted a nested case-control study to identify the risk factors for persistent arthralgia defined as a CHIK case experiencing arthralgia for more than 15 days from the date of onset of illness. We included all 81 patients and 81 randomly selected controls. Results: All 403 case patients had joint pain. Approximately 40 % suffered joint pain for up to 1 month and 7 % had it beyond 1 year. The most commonly affected <b>types</b> of <b>joints</b> were knee (96 %), wrist (80 %), and ankle (77 %) joints.
