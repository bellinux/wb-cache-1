40|$|<b>Monoclonal</b> <b>gammopathy</b> of {{undetermined}} significance (MGUS) is a premalignant {{plasma cell}} disorder that {{is associated with}} a lifelong risk of multiple myeloma. We conducted a systematic review of all studies investigating the prevalence and incidence of MGUS in the online database PubMed. The review was conducted from January 6, 2009, through January 15, 2010. The following MeSH search headings were used: <b>monoclonal</b> <b>gammopathy,</b> <b>benign</b> and prevalence; <b>monoclonal</b> <b>gammopathy,</b> <b>benign</b> and incidence; paraproteinemia and prevalence; and paraproteinemia and incidence. Articles were limited to those written in English and published by January 2009. Fourteen studies that met prespecified criteria were included and systematically assessed to identify the most accurate prevalence estimates of MGUS based on age, sex, and race. On the basis of our systematic review, we estimate that the crude prevalence of MGUS in those older than 50 years is 3. 2 % in a predominantly white population. Studies in white and Japanese populations demonstrate a clear increase in prevalence with age. The prevalence is also affected by sex: 3. 7 % and 2. 9 % in white men and women, respectively; and 2. 8 % and 1. 6 % in Japanese men and women, respectively. Additionally, MGUS is significantly more prevalent in black people (5. 9 %- 8. 4 %) than in white people (3. 0 %- 3. 6 %). We conclude that MGUS is a common premalignant plasma cell disorder in the general population of those older than 50 years. The prevalence increases with age and is affected by race, sex, family history, immunosuppression, and pesticide exposure. These results are important for counseling, clinical care, and the design of clinical studies in high-risk populations...|$|R
50|$|Smouldering myeloma, {{also known}} as {{smoldering}} myeloma, smoldering multiple myeloma, indolent myeloma or asymptomatic myeloma, is a disease classified as intermediate in a spectrum of step-wise progressive diseases termed plasma cell dyscrasias. In this spectrum of diseases, a clone of plasma cells secreting monoclonal paraprotein (also termed myeloma protein or M protein) causes the relatively <b>benign</b> disease of <b>monoclonal</b> <b>gammopathy</b> of undetermined significance. This clone proliferates and may slowly evolve into more aggressive sub-clones that cause smouldering multiple myeloma. Further and more rapid evolution causes the overtly malignant stage of multiple myeloma and can subsequently lead to the extremely malignant stage of secondary plasma cell leukemia. Thus, some patients with smouldering myeloma progress to multiple myeloma and plasma cell leukemia. Smouldering myeloma, however, is not a malignant disease. It is characeterised as a pre-malignant disease that lacks symptoms but is associated with bone marrow biopsy showing {{the presence of an}} abnormal number of clonal myeloma cells, blood and/or urine containing a myeloma protein, and a significant risk of developing into a malignant disease.|$|R

40|$|International audienceMultiple myeloma is {{the most}} {{frequent}} <b>monoclonal</b> <b>gammopathy</b> to involve the kidney; however, {{a growing number of}} kidney diseases associated with other <b>monoclonal</b> <b>gammopathies</b> are being recognized.
