40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to list potential candidate bee species for environmental risk assessment (ERA) of genetically modified (GM) cotton and to identify the most <b>suited</b> <b>bee</b> species for this task, according to their abundance and geographical distribution. Field inventories of bee on cotton flowers were performed in the states of Bahia and Mato Grosso, and in Distrito Federal, Brazil. During a 344 hour sampling, 3, 470 bees from 74 species were recovered, at eight sites. Apis mellifera dominated the bee assemblages at all sites. Sampling at two sites that received no insecticide application was sufficient to identify the three most common and geographically widespread wild species: Paratrigona lineata, Melissoptila cnecomola and Trigona spinipes, which could be useful indicators of pollination services in the ERA. Indirect ordination of common wild species revealed that insecticides {{reduced the number of}} native bee species and that interannual variation in bee assemblages may be low. Accumulation curves of rare bee species did not saturate, as expected in tropical and megadiverse regions. Species?based approaches are limited to analyze negative impacts of GM cotton on pollinator biological diversity. The accumulation rate of rare bee species, however, may be useful for evaluating possible negative effects of GM cotton on bee diversity. 201...|$|R
40|$|Bumblebee workers {{vary greatly}} in size, unlike workers {{of most other}} social bees. This {{variability}} has not been adequately explained. In many social insects, size variation is adaptive, with different-sized workers performing different tasks (alloethism). Here we established whether workers of the bumblebee, Bombus terrestris (L.) (Hymenoptera; Apidae), exhibit alloethism. We quantified the size of workers engaging in foraging compared to those that remain in the nest, and confirmed {{that it is the}} larger bees that tend to forage (X̄ ± SE thorax widths 4. 34 ± 0. 01 mm for nest bees and 4. 93 ± 0. 02 mm for foragers). We then investigated whether large <b>bees</b> are better <b>suited</b> to foraging because they are able to transport heavier loads of food back to the nest. Both pollen and nectar loads of returning foragers were measured, demonstrating that larger bees do return with a heavier mass of forage. Foraging trip times were inversely related to bee size when collecting nectar, but were unrelated to bee size for bees collecting pollen. Overall, large bees brought back more nectar per unit time than small bees, but the rate of pollen collection appeared to be unrelated to size. The smallest foragers had a nectar foraging rate close to zero, presumably explaining why foragers tend to be large. Why might larger bees be better at foraging? Various explanations are considered: larger bees are able to forage in cooler conditions, may be able to forage over larger distances, and are perhaps also less vulnerable to predation. Conversely, small workers are presumably cheaper to produce and may be more nimble at within-nest tasks. Further research is needed to assess these possibilities. © 2002 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|Nature {{conservation}} and income generation Cue: In the North West province of Cameroon, beekeeping and honey production have, {{in the last}} 20 years, become {{a major source of}} income for the rural poor. Honey from the province is exported to Nigeria and Chad, as well as being sold in towns, cities and villages in Cameroon. Much of this success has come from the work of ANCO, the Apiculture and Natural Conservation Organisation, a local NGO which was established in the area in 1992. For fifteen years it has been training farmers in the production of beehives and other beekeeping equipment, and in beekeeping skills. It has also been working as a marketing organisation for the honey that is produced. Yet despite that success, beekeeping has still not been included in Cameroon?s poverty reduction strategy, which frustrates ANCO?s founder and director, Paul Mzeka. Martha Chindong visited Paul recently at one of ANCO?s training venues, a bee farm, and found out that beekeeping has not only brought financial benefits to the province, but has also helped to protect the environment. But Martha began by pointing out that in fact, harvesting honey from the wild had been practised in the area for hundreds of years ? so why the need to introduce new methods? IN:		?Beekeeping is a very old occupation ?? OUT:		??Thank you for coming. I?m very happy. ? DUR?N:	 5 ? 02 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Paul Mzeka, founder of ANCO, an organisation working in the North West province of Cameroon, to promote beekeeping and protection of the environment. He was speaking to Martha Chindong, and the interview comes from a radio resource pack produced by CTA. Transcript Mzeka	Beekeeping is a very old occupation in the North West and people do not only harvest from the wild. They keep bees but they keep bees in round hives. Medino did a study in 1987 and found that 30 % of bush fires in the province were caused by bee farmers. Now the reason why this happened was that farmers used naked fire. When they are taking the naked fire to the bush sometimes they accidentally cause a bush fire. When they light to harvest their honey sometimes they set the hive on fire and then start a bush fire. Now what can be done? We have found that the newly introduced type of hive called a Kenya Top-Bar was very suitable for the rural world and also there was need to educate them, to wear a <b>bee</b> <b>suit</b> and to use what is called a smoker. That small device called a smoker, which is now used even by traditional beekeepers who do not agree to our approach but they all accept the use of the smoker which makes them harvest their honey without killing any bees, without being a threat to the environment. It is all spread all over the province now and I think that if another study were to be carried out now it would be discovered that there are very few bush fires arising from honey harvesting. Chindong	Is preventing bush fire the only environmental benefit of ANCO? Mzeka	No, the other environmental benefit {{is the fact that the}} bee family is not reduced by using direct naked fire. Because when you use it, a study done in some country in West Africa showed that harvesting from one hive, between two and three thousand bees are killed. So if you go at that rate you are destroying the very thing that is giving you honey. So one advantage is that farmers do not kill bees and therefore the bee population is increasing, pollination is increasing. The second one is the fact that they have become aware of the link between the honey they have in their hives and the environment, the trees that they have around. So they are now participating in planting trees and many of them are now marketing seedlings, which is an added advantage. They are spreading the idea of environmental protection themselves by selling seedlings. Chindong	We are sitting in a very cool environment with bee hives planted here and there. Are these trees planted here because of these bee hives? Is that what you teach the people? Mzeka	Yes, what you see here, there are eighteen hives and they all have bees. This is what we call a model bee farm. When we bring people to train, we talk about ideas but then we must show in practice what it is that we want them to do. We bring them here and say this farm has these trees because the hives are there. In the dry season the trees give shade to the hives and then the trees also give nectar which the bees need for the honey. So you need also in your farm never to have an exposed farm. The trees do a lot of work for your hives. The temperature of the hive should not be rising and falling, it should always be moderate and the trees will provide that condition. So the trees are here. You see the mango, you see the plum, you see the banana, you see the plantains; all these trees are planted to serve the hive. And then they do protect the environment. Chindong	Let me ask you a very practical question. You say you have eighteen hives here. Is there already honey inside, and when are you going to harvest? Mzeka	There is honey inside, and we are going to harvest towards the end of this month. This is the harvesting season. Chindong	And honey harvested from here can be what quantity? Mzeka	From these eighteen hives we usually harvest and sell, in a good year we sell for 150, 000 CFA. Chindong	Just from these eighteen hives? That is wonderful. Mzeka	Yes from these eighteen hives. And look at the land that is devoted to the hives. A very small piece. That is what we are saying, that government, the eye of those who are taking decisions should be opened to the realities of our rural world. There is this eucalyptus which people can cut down and make plank hives; there is bamboo which they can cut down and make hives. So let us just help them by bringing training to them, and they will carry the other activities without any help. Chindong	Thank you for making yourself available to us. Mzeka	Thank you for coming. I?m very happy. End of track. In North West Cameroon, improved methods of beekeeping are helping to protect forests and generate income...|$|E
40|$|Improved hive {{management}} Cue: Beehives come in many {{shapes and}} sizes. Traditional beehives are often made from hollowed out logs. A more modern type of beehive is the top-bar beehive, {{and the most}} sophisticated beehive is called a Langstroth beehive. This was designed by an American, the Reverend Lorenzo Langstroth, back in 1851. One {{of the advantages of}} the Langstroth hive is that the bees construct their honeycombs in frames which can be removed from the hive. This allows beekeepers to extract the honey without damaging the honeycomb, and then put the comb back into the hive. As a result, they can make more harvests each year, and get top quality honey. However, Langstroth hives are also more difficult to make. Carpenters may need specialised equipment and training, as the measurements of the structures in the hive must be extremely accurate. Many attempts to introduce Langstroth hives in Africa, particularly among rural communities, have failed. One organisation that has had some success however, is Honey Care Africa, which not only manufactures the hives, but also trains community members in beekeeping skills. Eric Kadenge visited their workshop in Nairobi, and spoke to operations manager Margaret Mimoh about their work. IN:		?This is the workshop, this is where ? OUT:		?are going to a group in Mount Kenya. ? DUR?N:	 4 ? 46 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Margaret Mimoh, operations manager for Honey Care Africa, an organisation that promotes sustainable community beekeeping in East Africa. The interview comes from a radio resource pack produced by CTA. Transcript Mimoh	This is the workshop, this is where we do the manufacture of hives and we are promoting Langstroth beehives. But when it comes to marketing, we are also helping or supporting the farmers who have different, other types of hives, through our own training, and we help them to improve on the techniques in handling the honey so that they come up with quality honey that conforms to the requirements of the market. Kadenge	Now why do you specifically concentrate or promote Langstroth beehives? Mimoh	Because we came to realise that Langstroth beehives give quality honey and also the production in Langstroth hive is a bit high as compared to the other hives. And especially it is women friendly, because the women can also take up beekeeping. Kadenge	What makes it more friendly to women? Mimoh	Because when it comes to inspections, the hives are placed on hanging stands, which are a bit lower compared to the log hives which were being placed up on top of trees and women cannot climb on top of trees to do inspections. And it is also next to the homestead, and it is very easy for women to carry out inspections. Kadenge	So take us through some of the steps that one needs to take. Mimoh	In fact what has to happen is the beekeeper has to ensure that he has the right equipment to help him manage the hives effectively. So we are talking in terms of the <b>bee</b> <b>suit</b> which is the protective clothing, and we have the smoker, we have the protective gloves and we have the gumboots. So he puts them on and goes to the hive, opening up the hive and checking inside to know what is the progress in the hive, and this will give him the indication of what to do next. Kadenge	And when it comes to observation, what do you need to observe and at what times? Mimoh	Normally inspection is done in the evening because the bees are quite cool at that particular time. So what will happen is, once the farmer goes to the hive in the evening, he has to check the strength of the colony. In that case he will also even see the laying pattern of the queen, which will give him an indication of whether the queen is active or not active. Because if the queen is not active then the laying pattern is so poorly done and the colony is so weak, so getting some good amounts of honey becomes a problem and also the building pattern of the bees becomes too slow. Kadenge	In the event that the laying patterns are poor, what would the farmer need to do? Mimoh	He will definitely know that the colony is a bit weak so he can also do the merging of the colonies or re-queening of the hive. Kadenge	Any other thing that the farmer would observe? Mimoh	If the farmer observes things like pests, he will definitely know what is the remedy I have to take or the action I have to take against this. In case of ants, crawling ants, he should definitely manage his apiary by cutting long grass. He can put also some ash or used oil around the post or modify a pond of water around the post so that the bees can use the water and the pests can drown in the water. Kadenge	Is there any other thing {{that you would like to}} add regarding management of beehives? Mimoh	If you don?t manage your hives then don?t expect a harvest. And this has been a practice that has been taken into account by most of the beekeepers who are born beekeepers. Maybe they just hang their hive, wait for six months and think that they are going to get honey out of it. But we have realised, or that is a challenge we have faced, if you don?t manage your hive very well you don?t get the honey. And you find that is why we are saying the Langstroth hive is women friendly, and the women are really doing very well. And in this case you find that they really take into account the inspections of the hive. And the moment they do that, they are really assured of the harvest and the quality of the honey they produced and the income that is going to be generated from that. You are also promoting nutrition within the families, because they get to know the value of using honey as a nutritional factor within the communities. Kadenge	So how many hives do you manufacture in this particular room in a given time? Mimoh	What I would say is that we work in partnership with non governmental organisations, community based organisations and even the government of Kenya. So what happens with the NGOs and the community groups on the ground, they would give us an order of the hives. So let?s say they have given us an order for 200 hives. We would take even two weeks to manufacture it and send it out. Kadenge	So right now we are looking at how many hives here? Mimoh	Right now we have three hundred. Kadenge	And they are destined to go where? Mimoh	About fifty of them are going to a group in Sudan and some are going to a group in western Kenya and some are going to a group in Mount Kenya.
