The paleocurrent was from the west to the east and east-southeast. The overlying predominantly finer grained Villavieja Formation was deposited in a meandering setting of a smaller size than those of the older La Victoria Formation. Paleocurrent analysis of the sediments in the Baraya and Cerro Colorado Members has revealed a similar flow direction as the La Victoria paleorivers, while the upper part of the Cerro Colorado Member shows an opposite trend to the west. The volcanic clasts of the formations have as provenance the Central Range volcanism, of which the volcaniclastics in the Honda Group mark its onset.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Progress {{towards a}} fuller {{understanding}} of the dynamics and deposits of <b>braided</b> <b>rivers</b> demands aninterdisciplinary approach {{to a host of}} unresolved problems. Although many advances have b en made within recent years in interpreting the mechanics of flow, transport of sediment and sedimentary architecture of <b>braided</b> <b>rivers</b> many key issues remain to be addressed. In particular, several areas demand attention: the mechanisms of braid bar initiation; confluence-diffluence dynamics, the nature ofsedimentary facies over a range of grain sizes and the influence of flow stage and aggradational regime upon the depositional architecture over a range of channel scales. This paper focuses upon these issues and highlights several areas of fruitful future interdisciplinary collaboration. <b>Braided</b> <b>rivers</b> form important topics of study for many scientists and one of the primary aims of this volume is to bring together work from many disciplines in an integrated approach to <b>braided</b> <b>rivers.</b> For the geomorphologist braided fluvial systems are abundant within upland and pro...|$|R
25|$|It is {{difficult}} to analyze extinction and survival rates of land organisms in detail, because few terrestrial fossil beds span the Permian–Triassic boundary. Triassic insects {{are very different from}} those of the Permian, but a gap in the insect fossil record spans approximately 15 million years from the late Permian to early Triassic. The best-known record of vertebrate changes across the Permian–Triassic boundary occurs in the Karoo Supergroup of South Africa, but statistical analyses have so far not produced clear conclusions. However, analysis of the fossil river deposits of the floodplains indicate a shift from meandering to <b>braided</b> <b>river</b> patterns, indicating an abrupt drying of the climate. The climate change may have taken as little as 100,000 years, prompting the extinction of the unique Glossopteris flora and its herbivores, followed by the carnivorous guild. End-Permian extinctions did not occur at an instantaneous time horizon; particularly, floral extinction was delayed in time.|$|E
25|$|A {{significant}} geographical {{aspect of}} Assam {{is that it}} contains three of six physiographic divisions of India – The Northern Himalayas (Eastern Hills), The Northern Plains (Brahmaputra plain) and Deccan Plateau (Karbi Anglong). As the Brahmaputra flows in Assam the climate here is cold and there is rainfall most of the month.Geomorphic studies conclude that the Brahmaputra, the life-line of Assam is an antecedent river, older than the Himalayas. The river with steep gorges and rapids in Arunachal Pradesh entering Assam, becomes a <b>braided</b> <b>river</b> (at times 10mi/16km wide) and with tributaries, creates a flood plain (Brahmaputra Valley: 50–60mi/80–100km wide, 600mi/1000km long). The hills of Karbi Anglong, North Cachar and those in and close to Guwahati (also Khasi-Garo Hills) now eroded and dissected are originally parts of the South Indian Plateau system. In the south, the Barak originating in the Barail Range (Assam-Nagaland border) flows through the Cachar district with a 25–30miles (40–50km) wide valley and enters Bangladesh with the name Surma River.|$|E

40|$|We give an {{overview}} of recent experimental and theoretical progress on the understanding of some fundamental (unit) processes which appear to control the morphodynamics of <b>braiding</b> <b>rivers.</b> In particular we analyse how bars, i. e. the basic constituents of <b>braiding</b> <b>rivers,</b> arise in response to intrinsic instabilities of the flow-sediment system (free bars) or to forcing mechanisms like channel curvature, channel widening and channel divergence (forced bars). We then proceed to discuss the mechanism of channel bifurcation and analyse the equilibrium configurations and stability of a basic unit of <b>braiding</b> <b>rivers,</b> consisting of a single loop formed by two channels bifurcating from an upstream node and merging into a downstream node. The picture drawn {{from the results of}} the above analyses, albeit incomplete, helps clarifying the highly dynamic and strongly fluctuating nature of <b>braiding</b> <b>rivers.</b> The paper is completed by a discussion of the basic ingredients that must be included in any sound model attempting to describe the development of a braiding network...|$|R

The vegetation of the La Venta fossil assemblage was diverse due to the different biomes of the depositional environment; meandering and <b>braided</b> <b>river</b> systems in a setting at lower altitudes than the present-day elevation of more than [...] above mean sea level. It has been suggested that the vegetational cover of the Honda Group sedimentary sequence was not a continuous canopy forest, yet a complex pattern of different flora ecosystems. The evergreen Amazonian foothill forests of today would therefore postdate the uplift of the Eastern Ranges of the Andes. Based on vegetational and grazer diversity analysis of the La Venta fauna, it has been suggested the ecosystem resembled more that of Africa and Asia than of the modern Neotropics. Research of the paleosols found in various levels within the Honda Group suggests the presence of arid areas in close proximity to pluvial parts.|$|E

2500|$|By the Triassic, the Permian Zechstein Sea {{had retreated}} and the climate {{had become a}} little wetter giving a gentle {{transition}} making the Permian-Triassic boundary uncertain in northern England as there are no fossil horizons or facies changes that make a definitive separation possible as there in continental Europe. The horizon however is characterised by a succession of red marls (calcareous mudstones) deposited on coastal flats, followed by the Sherwood Sandstone (formerly Bunter Sandstone). [...] The 'British Isles' were not islands, but had an intra-continental position within Pangea. The area that now constitutes Great Britain was drifting northwards as Pangea rotated, was at a latitude of 10° - 20° north, equivalent to the latitude of the present day Sahara desert. Erosion of the then recently uplifted landmass formed Aeolian deposits in the southern and central parts of the country. This iron-rich silica sandstone was both oxidised and reworked to give it its red colouration and its name, [...] "New Red Sandstone". British deposits of the era consist of these red beds, alluvial, fluvial and lake deposits, with some shallow-water marine and evaporite deposits. These Permo-Triassic outcrops {{can be seen on}} either side of the Pennines and in Devon. Within the main central England basin (Staffordshire and Cheshire), the deposits are dominated by pebbly sandstones and conglomerates (Chester Pebble Beds, Wilmslow and Wildmoor Sandstones), which have been interpreted as the deposits of a fluvial system running within well-confined channels. The Sherwood Sandstone Group comprises a series of conglomerates, coarse sandstones and mudstones. The Chester pebble beds to the south of Alderley represent material deposited in alluvial fan/braided river system. The finer sediments of the Wilmslow and Helsby Sandstone to the west of Alderley represent alluvial deposits of low sinuosity channels. The Alderley area represents the midpoint between the full <b>braided</b> <b>river</b> system and the lower energy area. Minor aeolian dunes and channel infill deposits in the Wilmslow Sandstones indicate an inter channel area or seasonal drying of some of the minor river channels.|$|E

50|$|There {{are a few}} {{distinctly}} different channel types based on their geological structure and depositional environment. <b>Braided</b> <b>rivers</b> carry fairly coarse-grained sediment down a fairly steep gradient. They typically exhibit numerous channels that split off and rejoin each other to give a braided appearance. Additionally, the water discharge tends to be highly variable. Consequently, <b>braided</b> <b>rivers</b> usually exist near mountainous regions, especially those with glaciers.

40|$|A {{fundamental}} and unresolved question in fluvial sedimentology concerns {{the nature of}} scale invariance and whether {{it is appropriate to}} apply data from a single river or outcrop of alluvial sediments to others of a different size. This issue is addressed herein by i) examining the similarity in aspects of the morphology of modern bars in <b>braided</b> <b>rivers</b> and ii) comparing the subsurface facies of three sandy <b>braided</b> <b>rivers</b> of differing scale (30 - 2000 m channel width), as revealed by ground penetrating radar (GPR). Measurement of braid bar shape in 15 rivers, covering four orders of magnitude in spatial scale, demonstrates that a simple index of bar planform shape, the width:length ratio, is scale invariant. Additionally, scour depths at channel confluences are similar in their relative scale across channels of greatly differing size. Comparison of the subsurface sedimentary facies of three sandy <b>braided</b> <b>rivers</b> using GPR demonstrates that sandy <b>braided</b> <b>rivers</b> exhibit a degree of scale invariance with the ubiquitous occurrence of trough cross-stratification associated with migrating dunes. However, significant differences exist in the occurrence of other facies both between rivers and between bars within the same river, most notably in the predominance of either high-angle planar cross-stratification or low-angle stratification. These differences are controlled by a wide range of factors that may include the discharge regime, local bar and channel topography, anabranch width:depth ratio and the abundance of vegetation. Hence although rivers and individual bars within the same river may have similar surface planform shapes, their subsurface facies may be very different. A single, universal facies model for sandy <b>braided</b> <b>rivers</b> is thus probably inappropriate and will remain elusive...|$|R
