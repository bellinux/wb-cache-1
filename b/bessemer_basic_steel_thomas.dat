5000|$|The {{bridge was}} of an obsolete, {{non-redundant}} structural design {{similar to that}} of the Hoan Bridge in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, which suffered a substantial structural failure.

30|$|The {{penetration}} {{resistance of}} the ions chloride in the mortar and the concrete {{is one of the}} most important questions concerning the durability of the concrete structures. When the chloride concentration exceeds a certain threshold, a depassivation of steel occurs and there is a beginning of corrosion for reinforced <b>steel</b> (<b>Thomas</b> 1996; Alonso et al. 2000). Consequently, the development of protection materials with a penetration resistance of chloride is required for the concrete structures.|$|R

5000|$|In 1865, the French {{engineer}} Pierre-Émile Martin {{took out}} a license from Siemens and first applied his regenerative furnace for making steel. The most appealing characteristic of the Siemens regenerative furnace is the rapid production of large quantities of <b>basic</b> <b>steel,</b> used for example to construct high-rise buildings.

40|$|Engineering {{students}} are {{best able to}} understand theory when one explains it in relation to realistic problems and its practical applications. Teaching theory in isolation has led to lower levels of comprehension and motivation and a correspondingly higher rate of failure. At Queensland University of Technology, {{a number of new}} methods have been introduced recently to improve the teaching and learning of steel structural design at undergradt 1 ate level. In the <b>basic</b> <b>steel</b> structures subject a project-based teaching method was introduced in which the students were required to analyse, design and build the lightest I most efficient steel columns for a given target capacity. A design assignment involving simple, but real structures was also introduced in the <b>basic</b> <b>steel</b> structures subject. Both these exercises simulated realistic engineering problems from {{the early years of the}} course and produced a range of benefits. Improvements to the teaching and learning was also made through integration of a number of related structural engineering subjects and by the introduction of animated computer models and laboratory models. This paper presents the details of all these innovative methods which improved greatly the students' understanding of the steel structures design process...|$|R

40|$|A revised {{procedure}} {{for the design}} of steel plate shear walls is proposed. In this procedure, the thickness of the infill plate is found using equations that are derived from plastic analysis of the strip model, which is widely accepted for the representation of steel plate shear walls.

500|$|The Cleveland {{ironstone}} {{had been}} considered inferior for steelmaking, as it contained a relatively high percentage of phosphorus at 1.8 to 2.0%, weakening the resulting iron. [...] Bell directed large-scale experiments {{at a cost of}} up to £50,000, resulting in a <b>basic</b> <b>steel</b> process which produced steel rails containing no more than 0.07% phosphorus. His obituary in The Times of 1904 noted, {{as a sign of the}} progress that Bell himself had brought about, that Bell could recall [...] "seeing wooden rails in use on the tramroads by which coal was brought down to the River Tees".|$|R
5000|$|The {{key to the}} {{effectiveness}} of the hollow charge is its diameter. As the penetration continues through the target, the width of the hole decreases leading to a characteristic [...] "fist to finger" [...] action, where the size of the eventual [...] "finger" [...] is based {{on the size of the}} original [...] "fist". In general, shaped charges can penetrate a steel plate as thick as 150% to 700% of their diameter, depending on the charge quality. The figure is for <b>basic</b> <b>steel</b> plate, not for the composite armor, reactive armor, or other types of modern armor.|$|R
