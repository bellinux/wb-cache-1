With proper care, they resist {{many of the}} parasites that affect more {{sensitive}} tropical fish species, such as Trichodina, Epistylis, and Ichthyophthirius multifiliis infections. Water pH is important for maintaining koi's health. Water changes help {{reduce the risk of}} diseases and keep koi not stressed. Two of the biggest health concerns among koi breeders are the koi herpes virus (KHV) and rhabdovirus carpio, which causes spring viraemia of carp (SVC). No treatment is known for either disease. Some koi farms in Israel use the KV3 vaccine, developed by Prof. M. Kotler from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and produced by Kovax, to immunise fish against KHV. Israel is currently the only country in the world to vaccinate koi against the KHV. The vaccine is injected into the fish when they are under one year old, and is accentuated by using an ultraviolet light. The vaccine has a 90% success rate and when immunized, the fish cannot succumb to a KHV outbreak and neither can the immunised koi pass KHV onto other fish in a pond. Only <b>biosecurity</b> <b>measures</b> such as prompt detection, isolation, and disinfection of tanks and equipment can prevent the spread of the disease and limit the loss of fish stock. In 2002, spring viraemia struck an ornamental koi farm in Kernersville, North Carolina, and required complete depopulation of the ponds and a lengthy quarantine period. For a while after this, some koi farmers in neighboring states stopped importing fish for fear of infecting their own stocks.|$|E

40|$|Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. Biosecurity, {{in broad}} terms, aims {{to reduce the}} impact and {{incidence}} of threats to life through regulatory means. For reasons we raise in this paper, such regulation can often lead to the specification of disease free processes within the food and farming industry, with <b>biosecurity</b> success <b>measured</b> {{in terms of the}} degree of compliance with and allegiance to modern farming practice. We counter this progressive narrative in three ways. First we draw on UK-based qualitative fieldwork with vets, farmers and pigs to demonstrate how biosecure farming and disease freedom are translated and qualified, in practice, to pathogen free, pathogen management and ultimately to configuring health through immunity management. Second, these translations demonstrate how building health is dependent on spatial and microbiological diversity rather than uniformity. Crucially, health involves patch-work and situated knowledge practices that are under threat within an industry increasingly marked by control and homogeneity. Third, in conceptual terms, we argue that while pig farming is organised through both biosecurity and a biopolitical regulation of life, immunity opens up political space for exploring an alternative politics of life, one where farmers and others are not so much made responsible for disease prevention, but make valued contributions to understandings of animal health and food security.

40|$|Background: Biosecurity {{routines}} at herd level {{may reduce}} the probability of introduction of disease into the herd, but some measures may be regarded as expensive and cumbersome for the farmers. Custom-made measures based on individual farm characteristics may aid in improving the actual application of on-farm biosecurity. The aim {{of the study was}} to provide a tool for calculating the effects of different <b>biosecurity</b> <b>measures</b> and strategies on the individual farm level. A simple model was developed to assess the risk of disease introduction and the need for <b>biosecurity</b> <b>measures</b> in individual farms. To illustrate the general applicability of the tool, it was applied to theoretical examples of Swedish cattle and pig farms and diseases endemic in those animal species in the EU, in two scenarios with different between-farm contact patterns. Results: The model illustrated that the most important factors affecting the risk, and the effect of <b>biosecurity</b> <b>measures</b> such as quarantine routines and protective clothing, were the frequency of between- farm contacts and prevalence of the disease. The risk of introduction as well as the effect of <b>biosecurity</b> <b>measures</b> differed between farm types and disease transmission routes. Adapting contact patterns to mitigate a specific disease risk was as important as <b>biosecurity</b> <b>measures</b> for some farm types, but the largest effect was seen when combining <b>biosecurity</b> <b>measures</b> with more planned contact patterns. Conclusions: The risk assessment model proved useful for illustrating the risk of introduction of endemic diseases and the mitigating effect of different <b>biosecurity</b> <b>measures</b> on farm level. Model outputs could be used to justify prioritisation of measures or adapting contact patterns. The theoretic exercise of adjusting model inputs and comparing outputs may help veterinary advisors to understand farm-specific risks and motivate farmers to improve biosecurity in their individual farm, as it can be tailored to each farmer's needs and preferences...|$|E

The indigenous chickens had no records of vaccination and were all on free range. Marek’s disease virus (HPRS- 16) positive standard antigen and serum were commercially obtained from Veterinary Laboratory Agency (VLA–UK). Analysis of risk factors associated with seropositivity of MDV antibodies in commercial and indigenous chickens; univariate and multivariate logistic regression was done.

40|$|During the 2014 - 2016 West Africa Ebola epidemic, {{transmission}} chains {{were controlled}} through contact tracing, i. e., identification and follow-up of people exposed to Ebola cases.

This article aims to analyze contact cases perceptions and acceptance of contact monitoring at the field level. In Senegal, an imported case of Ebola virus disease in September 2014 resulted in placing 74 contact cases in home containment with daily visits by volunteers. An ethnographic study based on in-depth interviews with all stakeholders performed in September-October 2014 showed four main perceptions of monitoring: a <b>biosecurity</b> preventive <b>measure,</b> suspension of professional activity, stigma attached to Ebola, and a social obligation. Contacts demonstrated diverse attitudes. Initially, most contacts agreed to comply because they feared being infected. They adhered to the national Ebola response measures and appreciated the empathy shown by volunteers. Later, acceptance was improved by the provision of moral, economic, and social support, and by the final lack of any new contamination. But it was limited by the socio-economic impact on fulfilling basic needs, the fear of being infected, how contacts' family members interpreted monitoring, conflation of contacts as Ebola cases, and challenging the rationale for containment. Acceptance was also related to individual aspects, such as the professional status of women and health workers who had been exposed, and contextual aspects, such as the media's role in the social production of stigma. Ethnographic results show that, even when contacts adhere rather than comply to containment through coercion, contact monitoring raises several ethical issues.

40|$|Purpose - Holistic {{approaches}} {{to public health}} such as ‘One Health’ emphasize the interconnectedness between people, animals, ecosystems, and epidemic risk, and many advocate for this philosophy to be adopted within disaster risk management (DRM). Historically, animal and human diseases have been managed separately from each other, and apart from other hazards considered for DRM. Shifts in DRM, however, may complement a One Health approach. The taxonomy of hazards considered under DRM has expanded to include medical and social crises such as epizootics and terrorism. However, there is a gap in understanding how epidemic risk is integrated into DRM at the community-level. Approach - TACTIC adopts a participatory case study approach examining preparedness for multiple hazard types (floods, epidemics, earthquakes, and terrorism) at the community-level. This article reports on findings from the epidemic case study which took as its focus the 2001 Foot-and-Mouth Disease (FMD) epidemic in the UK because of the diverse human, social, and environmental impacts of this ‘animal’ disease. Findings - Epizootic preparedness tends to focus on <b>biosecurity</b> and phytosanitary <b>measures,</b> and is geared towards agriculture and farming. Greater engagement with public health and behavioral sciences to manage public health impacts of animal disease epidemics, and activities for citizen engagement to improve preparedness are discussed. The impermeability of boundaries (hazard, institutional, disciplinary, etc.) is a key constraint to integrating One Health into DRM. Originality - This work helps to situate the One Health discussion within the community-level DRM context...|$|R
