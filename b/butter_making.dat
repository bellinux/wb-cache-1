25|$|The {{earliest}} butter {{would have}} been from sheep or goat's milk; cattle are not {{thought to have been}} domesticated for another thousand years. An ancient method of <b>butter</b> <b>making,</b> still used today in parts of Africa and the Near East, involves a goat skin half filled with milk, and inflated with air before being sealed. The skin is then hung with ropes on a tripod of sticks, and rocked until the movement leads to the formation of butter.|$|E
25|$|Yellow flowers such as primrose, rowan, hawthorn, gorse, hazel, and marsh {{marigold}} were placed at doorways and windows in 19th century Ireland, Scotland and Mann. Sometimes loose flowers were strewn {{at the doors}} and windows and sometimes they were made into bouquets, garlands or crosses and fastened to them. They would also be fastened to cows and equipment for milking and <b>butter</b> <b>making.</b> It is likely that such flowers were used because they evoked fire. Similar May Day customs are found across Europe.|$|E
2500|$|Pigs are omnivores, {{which means}} that they consume both plants and animals. In the wild, they are {{foraging}} animals, primarily eating leaves, grasses, roots, fruits, and flowers. [...] In confinement, pigs are fed mostly corn and soybean meal with a mixture of vitamins and minerals added to the diet. Traditionally they were raised on dairy farms and called [...] "mortgage lifters" [...] due to their ability to use the excess milk as well as whey from cheese and <b>butter</b> <b>making</b> combined with pasture. Older pigs will consume three to five gallons of water per day.|$|E

2500|$|Before modern factory <b>butter</b> <b>making,</b> cream {{was usually}} {{collected}} from several milkings {{and was therefore}} several days old and somewhat fermented {{by the time it}} was made into butter. Butter made from a fermented cream is known as cultured butter. During fermentation, the cream naturally sours as bacteria convert milk sugars into lactic acid. The fermentation process produces additional aroma compounds, including diacetyl, which makes for a fuller-flavored and more [...] "buttery" [...] tasting product. Today, cultured butter is usually made from pasteurized cream whose fermentation is produced by the introduction of Lactococcus and Leuconostoc bacteria.|$|E

50|$|The farm {{remained}} in the ownership of the Kelley family until 1901. The National Grange bought the farm in 1935 and donated it to the Minnesota Historical Society in 1961.

In 2003, state budget shortfalls threatened closure for the historical site. In response, the group Friends of the Kelley Farm was organized to help raise money to close the funding gap.
