5|$|Since {{the late}} 20th century, the MTA has started several {{projects}} to maintain and improve the subway. In the 1990s, it started converting the BMT Canarsie Line to use communications-based train control, utilizing a moving <b>block</b> <b>signal</b> <b>system</b> that allowed more trains to use the tracks and thus increasing passenger capacity. After the Canarsie Line tests were successful, the MTA expanded the automation program in the 2000s and 2010s to include other lines. As part of another program called FASTRACK, the MTA started closing certain lines during weekday nights in 2012, {{with each of the}} lines closing overnight for a week in order to allow workers to clean these lines without being hindered by train movements. It expanded the program beyond Manhattan the next year after noticing how efficient the FASTRACK program was compared to previous service diversions. In 2015, the MTA announced a wide-ranging improvement program as part of the 2015–2019 Capital Program. Thirty stations would be extensively rebuilt under the Enhanced Station Initiative, and new R211 subway cars would be able to fit more passengers.|$|E
25|$|The TTC is {{converting}} its <b>block</b> <b>signal</b> <b>system</b> to {{automatic train}} control on Line 1 Yonge–University {{at a cost of}} $562.3 million. With ATC, the TTC will be able to reduce the headway between trains on Line 1 from 2.5 minutes to 1 minute and 55 seconds during rush hours, and allow a 25 per cent {{increase in the number of}} trains operating on Line 1. ATC will be introduced to Line 1 in phases. The first phase is to activate ATC between Spadina and Wilson stations by fall 2017. With the opening of the Toronto–York Spadina Subway Extension in December 2017, ATC will be extended north from Wilson Station to Vaughan Metropolitan Centre. The entire line would be converted to ATC in 2019. By November 6, 2017, the TTC had successfully tested ATC in regular service over a 13-day period between Dupont and Yorkdale stations.|$|E
25|$|The CBTC {{project was}} first {{proposed}} in 1994 {{and approved by}} the MTA in 1997. Installation of the signal system was begun in 2000. Initial testing began in 2004, and installation was mostly completed by December 2006, with all CBTC-equipped R143 subway cars in service by that date. Due to an unexpected ridership increase on the Canarsie Line, the MTA ordered more R160 cars and these were put into service in 2010. This enabled the agency to operate up to 26 trains per hour up from the May 2007 service level of 15 trains per hour, an achievement that would not be possible without the CBTC technology or a redesign of the previous automatic <b>block</b> <b>signal</b> <b>system.</b> The R143s and R160s both use Trainguard MT CBTC, supplied by Siemens. In the 2015–2019 Capital Program, funding was provided for three more electrical substations for the line so that it could accommodate even more trains per hour. Also included in the Capital Program is the installation of automatic signals on the line to facilitate the movement of work trains between interlockings.|$|E
30|$|Moving <b>block</b> <b>signaling</b> <b>system</b> {{can achieve}} a larger line {{capacity}} {{when compared with}} the fixed <b>block</b> <b>signaling</b> <b>system</b> because a train can be allowed to move to the tail of the front train with a certain safety distance. The CBTC system with moving block could secure safe, fast, reliable, punctual, comfort, and energy-efficient operation of trains.|$|R

25|$|Early in 2013, SEPTA {{began to}} {{undertake}} major operational improvements and physical rehabilitation on the Manayunk/Norristown Line. Central to {{this project is}} {{the replacement of the}} 80-year-old wayside automatic <b>block</b> <b>signal</b> <b>system</b> with one that displays only in the operating cab, and operates in both directions on both tracks, thereby allowing greater operational flexibility. Two new remotely controlled interlockings are being constructed to facilitate bidirectional operation, one at Miquon, the other in Norristown between the main station and the Ford Street crossing. An electrified storage track is also being constructed at Miquon to allow for temporary turnback of trains at that station, as the line is periodically subjected to flooding from the Schuylkill River around Spring Mill and Conshohocken. Ongoing replacement of the line's overhead catenary, most of which is 80 years old, will continue along with the signal replacement. Also occurring in conjunction with these projects are the replacement of crossties, renewal of grade crossing surfaces, and trimming of brush and trees alongside the right-of-way. The entire program is scheduled for completion in fall 2015, tying in with the FRA-mandated nationwide implementation of Positive Train Control (PTC) on American railroads by the end of 2015.|$|E
2500|$|Construction of the San Diego Trolley {{proceeded}} incrementally. [...] The initial {{construction of}} new track focused mainly in downtown San Diego. [...] The work on the SD railroad track is best described as ‘rehabilitation’. [...] The MTDB replaced 40% of all ties, cropped and welded the jointed rail, constructed electric catenaries, and installed an absolute <b>block</b> <b>signal</b> <b>system.</b> [...] To control costs, the San Diego Trolley ordered only 14 cars, and did not install ‘mimic’ boards or the on-train location equipment until after the East Line was completed in 1989. [...] No new sidings were initially installed on the SD segment, which had three passing sidings between San Diego and San Ysidro. [...] Service started at 15-minute headways using the rehabilitated single-track line.|$|E
2500|$|The LIRR {{also took}} other steps {{to improve its}} {{physical}} image and its operations. In the 1950s they started a new publicity campaign, adopting a new [...] "Dashing Dan" [...] and [...] "Dashing Dottie" [...] logo and painted its trains in a gray color scheme.The railroad also continued to perform major capital improvement projects. During the 1950s and 1960s the Montauk Branch between Jamaica and Babylon continued going through a massive grade crossing elimination project, with the line being elevated from street level {{over a number of}} years. Mandated by federal and state agencies after the 1950 Kew Gardens (Richmond Hill) train collision, the railroad began to install an Automatic Speed Control system to supplement (and later replace) the wayside automatic <b>block</b> <b>signal</b> <b>system</b> on a majority of its lines. Finally, the LIRR was able to completely replace its steam locomotives with diesels, with the last steam-hauled trains running on October 8, 1955. Two of these PRR G5 class locomotives survive today.|$|E
30|$|Implementing uniform formats of <b>signaling</b> <b>system.</b> As long as {{we follow}} the {{principles}} of safe operation, different <b>signaling</b> <b>systems</b> will all have alternative choices all over the world.

Although the moving <b>block</b> <b>signaling</b> <b>system</b> is relatively advanced, we suggest that moving <b>block</b> <b>signaling</b> <b>system</b> be applied to the modification of the existing lines and the construction of new lines gradually.|$|R

5000|$|Typically, {{the signal}} at Peachtree Jct. {{displayed}} an [...] "approach" [...] (yellow) aspect. The <b>block</b> <b>signal</b> <b>system</b> was fully operational and provided three-block protection (red-yellow-green). Signals protected the entire line from Centerville yard to Peachtree Jct. Crossbucks and flashing lights protected the two grade crossings, with gates also in operation at the station's grade crossing.|$|E
5000|$|The {{investigation}} {{recommended that}} the Automatic <b>Block</b> <b>Signal</b> <b>system</b> be extended across {{the whole of the}} route. It found that [...] "this accident was caused by failure to provide adequate protection for the preceding train". A coroner's jury found the flagman and conductor of the lead train to be responsible for the accident and they were dismissed from service.|$|E
5000|$|Track {{warrants}} {{are issued}} granting main track use between two named points (i.e. milepost sign, station, and/or any fixed physical point, {{such as a}} switch). The dispatcher may also issue time constraints (known as [...] "Box 6" [...] on a standard form), although the track warrants remain in effect until cleared {{by a member of}} the receiving crew. Track warrants are sometimes used in conjunction with a <b>block</b> <b>signal</b> <b>system</b> to provide rear-end protection against following trains.|$|E
50|$|The line is dark territory, {{meaning that}} it is not signalled and not {{equipped}} with centralized traffic control or automatic <b>block</b> <b>signalling</b> <b>systems.</b> The line is dispatched via radio using track warrant control.|$|R
30|$|The use of ATO {{makes it}} more {{practical}} to implement moving <b>block</b> <b>signalling</b> [22, 32], and the two technologies are frequently implemented together on driverless metro systems around the world.

50|$|The TTC is {{replacing}} the <b>block</b> <b>signal</b> <b>system</b> on Line 1 Yonge-University with communications-based train control (CBTC), an implementation of automatic train control. A phased implementation of CBTC on Line 1 {{will begin in}} late 2017 be completed by 2019. With CBTC, the TTC hopes to increase {{the maximum number of}} trains it can run on Line 1 from 25 to ideally 32. However, this goal depends on how well the TTC can manage dwell time in stations, crew changeovers and turnaround at terminals.|$|E
50|$|Extensive {{wind tunnel}} {{research}} - {{the first in}} the railway industry - was done before J.G.Brill in 1931 built the Bullet cars for Philadelphia and Western Railroad (P&W). They were capable of running at 92 mph. Some of them were almost 60 years in service. P&W's Norristown High Speed Line is still in use, almost 110 years after P&W in 1907 opened their double-track Upper Darby-Strafford line without a single grade crossing with roads or other railways. The entire line was governed by an absolute <b>block</b> <b>signal</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E
5000|$|... 1913 There are {{now three}} round trips {{scheduled}} between Whitings and Beach Haven as passenger traffic slowly increases.

50|$|Post World War II, from 1946 the USSR army {{engineers}} {{with the}} prospect of connection to their system introduced modern communications, automatisation and Automatic <b>Block</b> <b>Signalling</b> <b>systems.</b> This was followed by the introduction of on train and guard radio communication systems, a process which was completed by 1949.|$|R
50|$|The Miami Seaquarium Spacerail was a {{monorail}} at Miami Seaquarium. It was {{the first}} hanging monorail in North America. It existed solely for entertainment, not transportation, as it had only one station. It offered views {{not only of the}} Seaquarium exhibits and buildings, but also of the Miami skyline. There were six cars, though only five were run at a time, and the cars had names after fish. The cars had unique styling until they were redesigned in 1978 to be rectangular and their names were removed. The cars operated around the loop counterclockwise, and had an Automatic <b>Block</b> <b>Signal</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E
50|$|The P&W was {{originally}} conceived to be a Class I railroad which would compete for east-west traffic with the mighty Pennsylvania Railroad. Already in 1907, the P&W had laid trackage with a quality {{never seen before}} by an interurban - free from grade crossings with both railroads and roads, and with a color-light <b>block</b> <b>signal</b> <b>system,</b> like most Class I railroads of the day. Nearly the entire line was double track to improve safety and capacity (the deadliest interurban wrecks were caused by head-on collisions). To further utilize the Bullets' potential, more improvements were made to track and signal systems to permit extremely high speeds on the Norristown line.|$|E
50|$|On July 25, 1949 the Hirosaki Electric Railway (Hirosaki Denki-Tetsudō Kabushika-kaisha) was established, and {{connected}} Ōwani Station with Chuo-Hirosaki Station by January 26, 1952. The company {{was founded by}} a combination of capital from the Hirosaki city government, and Mitsubishi Electric, with the line intended by Mitsubishi to be a test platform for future local train systems. On October 1, 1970, the Hirosaki Electric Railway was acquired by the Kōnan Railway Company, and its line became the Kōnan Railway Ōwani Line. At the same time all freight operations were suspended. A new Automatic <b>Block</b> <b>Signal</b> <b>system</b> became operational from November 1, 2003. Express services were suspended from November 2006.|$|E
