5|$|For part of 31 October, Derrick assumed {{command of}} his company after all of the unit's {{officers}} had been killed or wounded in fierce fighting. On 21 November 1942, Derrick was briefly admitted to the 2/3rd Australian Field Ambulance with slight shrapnel wounds to {{his right hand and}} <b>buttock.</b> Twelve days later, the 2/48th Battalion left El Alamein and returned to Gaza in Palestine, where, later that month, Derrick attended a corps patrolling course. In January 1943, the 2/48th Battalion sailed home to Australia, aboard the S.S. Nieuw Amsterdam, {{along with the rest of}} the 9th Division.|$|E
5|$|On 14 February, Totti was sidelined {{for about}} a month after {{sustaining}} a bruised right <b>buttock.</b> He returned to the pitch on 17 March against Udinese, scoring the first goal of the match as he helped his team to a 3–2 win. Eight days later, Totti celebrated 700 overall appearances with Roma against Torino. On 2 April, he scored his 20th career goal against Parma (a personal record against any side) in a 4–2 victory. He finished the season with eight goals and ten assists, ending the year as the top assist provider of the 2013–14 Serie A season.|$|E
5|$|At trial, crucial {{testimony}} {{came from}} Chi Omega sorority members Connie Hastings, who placed Bundy {{in the vicinity}} of the Chi Omega House that evening, and Nita Neary, who saw him leaving the sorority house clutching the oak murder weapon. Incriminating physical evidence included impressions of the bite wounds Bundy had inflicted on Lisa Levy's left <b>buttock,</b> which forensic odontologists Richard Souviron and Lowell Levine matched to castings of Bundy's teeth. The jury deliberated for less than seven hours before convicting him on July 24, 1979 of the Bowman and Levy murders, three counts of attempted first degree murder (for the assaults on Kleiner, Chandler and Thomas) and two counts of burglary. Trial judge Edward Cowart imposed death sentences for the murder convictions.|$|E
50|$|A <b>buttocks</b> fetish or <b>buttocks</b> partialism {{refers to}} a {{condition}} wherein the <b>buttocks</b> becomes a primary focus of sexual attention. It may be associated with coprophilia, panty fetishism, eproctophilia, and sadomasochistic corporal punishment involving the <b>buttocks.</b> Pygophilia refers to sexual arousal caused by the <b>buttocks.</b>|$|R
50|$|In humans, females {{generally}} have more round and voluptuous <b>buttocks,</b> caused by estrogen that encourages {{the body to}} store fat in the <b>buttocks,</b> hips, and thighs. Testosterone discourages fat storage in these areas. The <b>buttocks</b> in human females thus contain more adipose tissue than in males, especially after puberty. Evolutionary psychologists suggest that rounded <b>buttocks</b> may have evolved as a desirable trait because they provide a visual indication of the woman's youth and fertility. They signal the presence of estrogen {{and the presence of}} sufficient fat stores for pregnancy and lactation. Additionally, the <b>buttocks</b> give an indication of the shape and size of the pelvis, which impacts reproductive capability. Since development and pronunciation of the <b>buttocks</b> begins at menarche and declines with age, full <b>buttocks</b> are also a symbol of youth.|$|R

5|$|One {{particularly}} infamous oceanic whitetip was {{implicated in}} several bites on tourists in the Red Sea near Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt, in 2010. This oceanic whitetip was recognized individually by the bite mark {{taken out of}} its upper tail lobe. Accumulating evidence revealed this shark to have been conditioned to being hand fed. Upon associating the divers with an easy supply of food, it bit the divers and snorkelers where it had seen the fish being kept; fanny packs the divers carried. This caused the shark to target the divers' <b>buttock</b> and thigh regions {{in the hope of}} obtaining a meal. The 2010 Sharm El Sheikh bites resulted in one death and four injuries to humans. The attacks might have been instigated by the overfishing in that area of the Red Sea, effectively forcing the shark closer to shore where the bites took place.|$|E
25|$|Piriformis {{syndrome}} is often left undiagnosed and mistaken with other pains due to similar symptoms with back pain, quadriceps pain, lower leg pain, and <b>buttock</b> pain. These symptoms include tenderness, tingling and numbness initiating in lower back and <b>buttock</b> area and then radiating {{down to the}} thigh and to the leg.|$|E
25|$|Relatively long {{vascular}} pedicle. Scar {{is hidden}} in lower <b>buttock</b> crease.|$|E
5000|$|The English word of Greek origin [...] "callipygian" [...] {{indicates}} {{someone who}} has beautiful <b>buttocks.</b> However, the qualities that make <b>buttocks</b> beautiful or well-formed are not fixed, as sexual aesthetics of the <b>buttocks</b> vary considerably from culture to culture, from one period of fashion to another and even from person to person. Depending on the context, exposure of the <b>buttocks</b> in non-intimate situations can cause feelings of embarrassment or humiliation, and embarrassment or amusement in an onlooker (see pantsing). Willfully exposing one's own bare <b>buttocks</b> as a protest, a provocation, or just for fun is called mooning.|$|R
5000|$|The {{student can}} only be caned on the <b>buttocks</b> (over clothing) or the palm. He cannot be caned on the bare <b>buttocks.</b>|$|R
50|$|While female <b>buttocks</b> {{are often}} eroticized in {{heterosexual}} erotica, men's <b>buttocks</b> are considered erogenous by many women, {{and are also}} eroticized in gay male circles. Much of gay male sexuality centres on anal intercourse and penetration, so the <b>buttocks</b> are eroticized in that sector due to their proximity to the anus and the genitals.|$|R
25|$|Insufficient <b>buttock</b> tissue. Damage to the perforators, {{because of}} a {{previous}} surgical operation, such as liposuction.|$|E
25|$|Longer {{vascular}} pedicle {{compared to}} the SGAP flap. The scar is hidden in the <b>buttock</b> crease.|$|E
25|$|Sciatic nerve injury {{may also}} occur from {{improperly}} performed injections into the <b>buttock,</b> and {{may result in}} sensory loss.|$|E
5000|$|See WikiSaurus:buttocks {{for a list}} of {{synonyms}} and slang {{words for}} <b>buttocks</b> in many languages. For unrelated homophones of <b>butt(ocks),</b> see also butt (disambiguation) and bud (disambiguation) ...|$|R
50|$|Estrogen causes fat to {{be stored}} in the <b>buttocks,</b> thighs, and hips in women. When women reach {{menopause}} and the estrogen produced by ovaries declines, fat migrates from their <b>buttocks,</b> hips and thighs to their waists. Later fat is stored in the belly. Thus females generally have relatively narrow waists and large <b>buttocks,</b> and this along with wide hips make for a wider hip section and a lower waist-hip ratio compared to men. Hormonal and genetic factors may produce male-like distribution of fat in women i.e. around the belly instead of <b>buttocks</b> and thighs.|$|R
5000|$|The erotic {{beauty of}} the female <b>buttocks</b> was {{important}} to the ancient Greeks, thought to have built such statues as Venus Kallipygos (although only a possible Roman copy survives), that emphasize the <b>buttocks.</b> Bare <b>buttocks</b> were also considered erotic in Ming China, where they were often compared to the bright full moon. [...] Many artists pose models to emphasize the <b>buttocks.</b> 19th Century Europeans sought to profit from this unique feature of African women through objectification and exploitation by placing Saartjie Baartman on display in a Human zoo.|$|R
25|$|If {{there is}} a {{contraindication}} for an abdominal flap or in case the patient refuses an abdominal or <b>buttock</b> scar. Small to medium-sized breasts. Primary bilateral reconstruction after skin sparing mastectomy.|$|E
25|$|Both autopsy reports mention severe {{swelling}} at external genitals {{as well as}} abrasions on {{the left}} <b>buttock.</b> Jansen-Schroder's report also mentioned contusions in the right hip area and fluid accumulation in the lungs.|$|E
25|$|Harvesting of the IGAP flap {{is similar}} to raising the SGAP flap, however, the flap is taken from the lower <b>buttock</b> area {{including}} one or more perforators of the inferior gluteal vessels.|$|E
50|$|In Western {{and some}} other cultures, many comedians, writers and others rely on the <b>buttocks</b> {{as a source of}} amusement, camaraderie and fun. There are {{numerous}} colloquial terms for the <b>buttocks.</b>|$|R
50|$|The female <b>buttocks</b> {{have been}} a symbol of {{fertility}} and beauty since early human history. Statues created as early as 24,000 BC, such as the Venus of Willendorf, have exaggerated <b>buttocks,</b> hips, and thighs.|$|R
5000|$|Again in 2017 Vasudeva used profane {{language}} and after government MP Harsha de Silva {{advised him to}} mind his language Vasudeva began insulting the PM, IGP, Attorney General and the Bribery Department claiming everything is under the Prime minister's <b>buttocks</b> which led to government ministers questioning if he was under Mahinda Rajapaksa's <b>buttocks</b> for whichreplied [...] "That’s okay. That was a blessing. Being under Mahinda’s <b>buttocks</b> was a great blessing.” ...|$|R
25|$|At Western Illinois University in January 1999, a Delta pledge {{was hospitalized}} due to torn skin on her lower back and <b>buttock</b> from severe beatings by Delta women. She sued the {{sorority}} {{for an undisclosed}} amount.|$|E
25|$|The SGAP flap {{includes}} {{skin and}} fat from the upper <b>buttock</b> {{with one or more}} perforators of the superior gluteal artery and vein, which perfuse the tissue. The flap is usually harvested in the prone or lateral decubitus position necessitating turning of the patient during surgery.|$|E
25|$|A {{circumferential}} abdominoplasty is {{an extended}} abdominoplasty plus a <b>buttock</b> lift. The resulting scar runs {{all the way}} around the body, and the operation is also called a Belt Lipectomy or lower body lift. This operation is most appropriate for patients who have undergone massive weight loss.|$|E
60|$|There are two {{fields of}} touch, however, where the {{distribution}} {{is not so}} simple: the face and the <b>buttocks.</b> Neither in the face nor in the <b>buttocks</b> is there one single mode of sense communication.|$|R
50|$|<b>Buttocks</b> {{are often}} {{emphasized}} in pornography. Patricia Hill Collins, an African-American post-modern feminist writer, theorizes {{that this is}} derived from a stereotype that black women are promiscuous, and their <b>buttocks</b> are objectified by pornography as a result.|$|R
50|$|Some baboons and all gibbons, though {{otherwise}} fur-covered, have characteristic naked callosities {{on their}} <b>buttocks.</b> While human children generally have smooth <b>buttocks,</b> mature {{males and females}} have varying degrees of hair growth, as on other parts of their body. Females may have hair growth in the gluteal cleft (including around the anus), sometimes extending laterally onto the lower aspect of the cheeks. Males may have hair growth over {{some or all of}} the <b>buttocks.</b>|$|R
25|$|A {{view of the}} {{ensemble}} indicates that, (seen from behind), {{the point of the}} <b>buttock,</b> the middle of the leg, the hock, the metatarsal and the foot are on the same vertical line. Its upper thighs are let down and well muscled. Its hock joints are strong and moderately angulated, and the metatarsals are short and strong.|$|E
25|$|Three of {{the women}} claimed he had grabbed their breasts, a fourth said he placed his hand under her skirt on her <b>buttock.</b> A fifth woman claimed Schwarzenegger tried to take off her bathing suit in a hotel elevator, and the last said he pulled her onto his lap and asked her about a sex act.|$|E
25|$|Rather tedious {{dissection}} of {{the flap}} and possibility {{of damage to}} the posterior femoral cutaneous nerve. Need to turn the patient during surgery. Scar tenderness causing problems with sitting. Visibility of the scar lateral to underwear/swimwear. Need to turn the patient during surgery. Possibility of a donor site contour deformity of the <b>buttock</b> area. Asymmetrical buttocks {{in case of a}} unilateral breast reconstruction.|$|E
50|$|Intergluteal sex: {{stimulation}} of the penis using the <b>buttocks,</b> often used {{as a form of}} mutual masturbation. It differs from anal sex because no penetration of the anus occurs. The penis is stimulated by moving between the <b>buttocks.</b>|$|R
25|$|The septocutaneous {{perforator}} is {{not always}} present; the requirement to rotate the patient during the surgery; {{the possibility of a}} donor-site contour deformity high upon the <b>buttocks</b> area; and an asymmetrical <b>buttocks</b> region {{in the case of a}} unilateral breast reconstruction.|$|R
50|$|Sexologist Alfred Kind {{suggested}} that the <b>buttocks</b> is the primary sexual presentation site in primates. Some anthropologists and sociobiologists believe that breast fetishism derives from the breasts' similarity to <b>buttocks,</b> but instead provide sexual attraction {{from the front of}} the body.|$|R
