5|$|Portland had {{strongly}} desired Washington, {{and their}} general manager Stu Inman, {{was a close}} friend of Pete Newell's. Inman had worked hard through Newell to let Washington know that they intended this to be the last time he was traded. This was important as the media coverage and re-locations had <b>been</b> <b>hard</b> on Pat and the children. To his great relief, the city of Portland welcomed Washington with open arms. Portland had one of the more rabid fan bases in the league, and everywhere Washington went he was treated like a beloved celebrity.|$|E
5|$|Until the 1950s, the {{diagnosis}} of pituitary disease remained based on clinical features and visual field examination, sometimes aided by pneumoencephalography and X-ray tomography. Nevertheless, the field of pituitary surgery developed during this time. The major breakthrough in diagnosis came {{with the discovery of}} radioimmunoassay by Rosalyn Yalow and Solomon Berson in the late 1950s. This allowed the direct measurement of the hormones of the pituitary, which {{as a result of their}} low concentrations in blood had previously <b>been</b> <b>hard</b> to measure. Stimulation tests were developed in the 1960s, and in 1973 the triple bolus test was introduced, a test that combined stimulation testing with insulin, GnRH and TRH. Imaging of the pituitary, and therefore identification of tumors and other structural causes, improved radically with the introduction of computed tomography in the late 1970s and magnetic resonance imaging in the 1980s.|$|E

25|$|Red wine {{has always}} <b>been</b> <b>hard</b> to produce in the German climate, {{and in the}} past was usually light colored, closer to rosé or the red wines of Alsace.

Among the Irish population, however, there was an element of support for the Third Reich due to resentment of British rule.

Although the Official History of New Zealand in the Second World War 1939–45 refers to the Italo-German infantry action as simply 'feints', Captain Cyril Falls, a British military historian, wrote {{that it was a}} strong counter-attack requiring an equal response.|$|E
25|$|Maglev {{systems have}} been much more {{expensive}} to construct than conventional train systems, although the simpler construction of maglev vehicles makes them cheaper to manufacture and maintain.

25|$|Some {{companies}} {{included a}} complimentary blank cassette with their portable cassette recorders {{in the early}} 1980s.

Home taping enthusiasts may have found certain lengths useful for fitting an album neatly on one or both sides of a tape. For instance, the initial maximum playback time of Compact Discs was 74 minutes, explaining the relative popularity of C74 cassettes.|$|E
25|$|As {{stated the}} 1775 Armstrong map of Ayrshire clearly shows a 'Chapel' marked, {{so it was}} known to exist at this time, however the remains would have been mined/removed {{over the years by}} local farmers and used for {{building}} work, etc. The remains of the chapel would have <b>been</b> <b>hard</b> to locate by the early 18th century. Arrowsmith's 1807 map shows Chapel marked near Linshaw (Lainshaw) and no Laigh mentioned, while Ainslie's 1821 map shows a Chapel and a Laigh. It is likely that the term Chapel on most maps could be referring to a dwelling or farm and not the Chapel on the mound.|$|E

40|$|In {{this thesis}} we present the {{following}} results. • Learning theory, {{and in particular}} PAC learning, was introduced by Valiant [CACM 1984] and has since become a major area of research in theoretical and applied computer science. One natural question that was posed at the very inception of the field is whether there are classes of functions that <b>are</b> <b>hard</b> to learn. PAC learning <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> under widely held conjectures such as the existence of one-way functions, {{and on the other}} hand it is known that if PAC learning <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> then P ̸ = NP. We further study sufficient and necessary conditions for PAC learning to <b>be</b> <b>hard,</b> and we prove that: 1. ZK ̸ = BPP implies that PAC learning <b>is</b> <b>hard.</b> 2. It <b>is</b> unlikely using standard techniques that one can prove that PAC learning <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> implies that ZK ̸ = BPP. 3. It is unlikely using standard techniques that one can prove that P ̸ = NP implies that ZK ̸ = BPP...|$|R
25|$|The {{victories}} had <b>been</b> <b>hard</b> won, {{but growing}} Soviet resistance and increased counterattacks brought the Smolensk-Moscow front to a stalemate. Hitler wavered, and on 30 July ordered Army Group Centre {{to assume the}} strategic defensive. In Directive 34, he refocused the main effort of Barbarossa on Leningrad because of strong concentrations of enemy forces west of Moscow. To this end, Richthofen and his Fliegerkorps was assigned to Luftflotte 1 (Air Fleet 1). During July 1941, the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht (OKW, or German High Command) displayed a lack of coherent strategy. It shifted from pursuing one objective to the next. It first wanted to advance to Moscow, then Leningrad, before shifting operations further south.|$|E
25|$|He {{also became}} Director, Schools Training, Army Administration Schools, and was {{promoted}} to Brigadier General in early 1942. In this position Holdridge was responsible for implementing the opening of Officer Candidate Schools at colleges around the country, to provide twelve-week courses of instruction for the massive increase in the US Army's officer corps during 1942-1944. Holdridge saw {{that many of these}} schools were opened at smaller public and private colleges and universities that had <b>been</b> <b>hard</b> hit by loss of students to military service, helping to ensure their financial viability during the war years. For his efforts, he was awarded a Doctor of Laws degree by Grinnell College on January 24, 1943.|$|E
25|$|Others, like Sir Robert Thompson, {{himself an}} ex-Chindit, have {{asserted}} that the idea behind the Chindits was a sound one, but {{that they were just}} badly handled and used in operations for which they were not properly equipped or trained, for example in static defence. A third view is that, despite the relatively insignificant losses that the Chindits were able to inflict, their propaganda value in 1943, {{at a time when the}} Army was on the defensive, was a morale boost to the people of India and Britain, and helping to dispel the image of Japanese invincibility. It has <b>been</b> <b>hard</b> to reach a consensus on any of these issues due to the partisan nature of the discussions surrounding Wingate himself.|$|E
