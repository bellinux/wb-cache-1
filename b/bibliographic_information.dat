500|$|Motivated by his {{interest}} in botanical history and taxonomy, Stearn devoted a considerable part of his output to botanical bibliography, including numerous papers and catalogues establishing the exact publication dates of books on natural history, particularly from the early nineteenth century, including William Herbert's work on Amaryllidaceae (1821, 1837) and complete bibliographies of botanists such as John Gilmour (1989). At the RHS library he transformed the minimalist card indexing by introducing British Museum rules and adding extensive <b>bibliographic</b> <b>information.</b> He quickly realised {{that one of the}} major deficits in contemporary taxonomic nomenclature was a lack of precise dates of all the names, and set about rectifying this over a fifteen-year period, resulting in 86 publications, which was a major step in stabilising nomenclature. The importance of this lay in the rules of botanical nomenclature, which gives botanical names priority based on dates of publication. He considered his most important contribution in this regard to be his elucidation of the dating of the early 19th century collection of studies of Canary Islands flora by Webb and Berthelot (1836–1850). Another important work from this period was on Ventenat's Jardin de la Malmaison (1803–1804), also published in the new Journal of the Society for the Bibliography of Natural History. In a number of instances his contributions to others' work went unacknowledged, particularly when he was younger, even though his introductions (often with the title [...] "Revised and enlarged by W. T. Stearn") could be as lengthy as the texts they preceded. His contributions to botanical bibliography and in particular the correct interpretation of historical texts from Linnaeus to Arber are considered of central importance to the field of taxonomy.|$|E

Its earliest recognizable component is Fata-n grădina de aur ("Girl in the Garden of Gold"), written ca. 1873, when Eminescu was in Berlin. It was the ottava rima version of Romanian folklore prose-piece—retrieved by the Silesian Richard Kunisch and published in 1861 Das Mädchen im goldenen Garten.

2500|$|Mathematical Reviews {{was founded}} by Otto E. Neugebauer in 1940 as an {{alternative}} to the German journal Zentralblatt für Mathematik, which Neugebauer had also founded a decade earlier, but which under the Nazis had begun censoring reviews by and of Jewish mathematicians. The goal of the new journal was to give reviews of every mathematical research publication. As of November 2007, the Mathematical Reviews database contained information on over 2.2 million articles. The authors of reviews are volunteers, usually chosen by the editors because of some expertise in the area of the article. It and Zentralblatt für Mathematik are the only comprehensive resources of this type. (The Mathematics section of Referativny Zhurnal is available only in Russian and is smaller in scale and difficult to access.) Often reviews give detailed summaries of the contents of the paper, sometimes with critical comments by the reviewer and references to related work. However, reviewers are not encouraged to criticize the paper, because the author does not have an opportunity to respond. The author's summary may be quoted when it is not possible to give an independent review, or when the summary is deemed adequate by the reviewer or the editors. Only <b>bibliographic</b> <b>information</b> may be given when a work is in an unusual language, when it is a brief paper in a conference volume, or when it is outside the primary scope of the Reviews. Originally the reviews were written in several languages, but later an [...] "English only" [...] policy was introduced. Selected reviews (called [...] "featured reviews") were also published as a book by the AMS, but this program has been discontinued.|$|E
2500|$|In January 1988, Cosmopolitan {{magazine}} {{published an}} article by Robert E. Gould, a psychiatrist, entitled [...] "Reassuring News About AIDS: A Doctor Tells Why You May Not Be At Risk." [...] The main contention of the article was that in unprotected vaginal sex {{between a man and}} a woman who both had [...] "healthy genitals" [...] the risk of HIV transmission was negligible, even if the male partner was infected. Women from ACT UP who had been having informal [...] "dyke dinners" [...] met with Dr. Gould in person, questioning him about several misleading facts (that penis to vagina transmission is impossible, for example) and questionable journalistic methods (no peer review, <b>bibliographic</b> <b>information,</b> failing to disclose that he was a psychiatrist and not a practitioner of internal medicine), and demanded a retraction and apology. When he refused, in the words of Maria Maggenti, they decided that they [...] "had to shut down Cosmo." [...] According to those who were involved in organizing the action, it was significant in that it was the first time the women in ACT UP organized separately from the main body of the group. Additionally, filming the action itself, the preparation and the aftermath were all consciously planned and resulted in a video short directed by Jean Carlomusto and Maria Maggenti, titled, [...] "Doctor, Liars, and Women: AIDS Activists Say No To Cosmo." [...] The action consisted of approximately 150 activists protesting in front of the Hearst building (parent company of Cosmopolitan) chanting [...] "Say no to Cosmo!" [...] and holding signs with slogans such as [...] "Yes, the Cosmo Girl CAN get AIDS!" [...] Although the action did not result in any arrests, it brought significant television media attention to the controversy surrounding the article. Phil Donahue, Nightline, and a local talk show called [...] "People Are Talking" [...] all hosted discussions of the article. On the latter, two women, Chris Norwood and Denise Ribble took the stage after the host, Richard Bey, cut Norwood off during an exchange about whether heterosexual women are at risk from AIDS. Footage from all of these media appearances was edited into [...] "Doctors, Liars, and Women." [...] Cosmopolitan eventually issued a partial retraction of the contents of the article.|$|E
