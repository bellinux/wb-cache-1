5|$|Brazilian flex {{cars are}} capable of running on just {{hydrated}} ethanol (E100), or just on a blend of gasoline with 20 to 25%anhydrous ethanol, or on any arbitrary combination of <b>both</b> <b>fuels.</b> Pure gasoline is no longer sold in the country because these high ethanol blends are mandatory since 1993. Therefore, all Brazilian automakers have optimized flex vehicles to run with gasoline blends from E20 to E25, so these FFVs are unable to run smoothly with pure gasoline {{with the exception of}} two models are specifically built with a flex-fuel engine optimized to operate also with pure gasoline (E0), the Renault Clio Hi-Flex and the Fiat Siena Tetrafuel.|$|E
5|$|Flexible-fuel {{vehicles}} (FFVs) {{are based}} on dual-fuel systems that supply <b>both</b> <b>fuels</b> into the combustion chamber {{at the same time}} in various calibrated proportions. The most common fuels used by FFVs today are unleaded gasoline and ethanol fuel. Ethanol FFVs can run on pure gasoline, pure ethanol (E100) or any combination of both. Methanol has also been blended with gasoline in flex-fuel vehicles known as M85 FFVs, but their use has been limited mainly to demonstration projects and small government fleets, particularly in California.|$|E

5|$|A {{flexible-fuel vehicle}} (FFV) or dual-fuel vehicle (colloquially called a flex-fuel vehicle) is an {{alternative}} fuel vehicle with an internal combustion engine designed to run {{on more than one}} fuel, usually gasoline blended with either ethanol or methanol fuel, and <b>both</b> <b>fuels</b> are stored in the same common tank. Modern flex-fuel engines are capable of burning any proportion of the resulting blend in the combustion chamber as fuel injection and spark timing are adjusted automatically according to the actual blend detected by a fuel composition sensor. Flex-fuel vehicles are distinguished from bi-fuel vehicles, where two fuels are stored in separate tanks and the engine runs on one fuel at a time, for example, compressed natural gas (CNG), liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), or hydrogen.|$|E
500|$|The American E85 flex-fuel {{vehicle was}} {{developed}} to run on any mixture of unleaded gasoline and ethanol, anywhere from 0% to 85% ethanol by volume. <b>Both</b> <b>fuels</b> are mixed in the same tank, and E85 is sold already blended. In order to reduce ethanol evaporative emissions and to avoid problems starting the engine during cold weather, the maximum blend of ethanol was set to 85%. There is also a seasonal reduction of the ethanol content to E70 (called winter E85 blend) in very cold regions, where temperatures fall below [...] during the winter. In Wyoming for example, E70 is sold as E85 from October to May.|$|E

500|$|Flexible-fuel {{technology}} started {{being developed}} by Brazilian engineers {{near the end of}} the 1990s. The Brazilian flexible fuel car is built with an ethanol-ready engine and one fuel tank for <b>both</b> <b>fuels.</b> The small gasoline reservoir for starting the engine with pure ethanol in cold weather, used in earlier neat ethanol vehicles, was kept to avoid start up problems in the central and southern regions, where winter temperatures normally drop below [...] An improved flex motor generation was launched in 2009 and allowed to eliminate the need for this secondary gas reservoir tank. Another improvement was the reduction of fuel consumption and tailpipe emissions, between 10% to 15% as compared to flex motors sold in 2008. In March 2009 Volkswagen do Brasil launched the Polo E-Flex, the first flex fuel model without an auxiliary tank for cold start.|$|E

5000|$|Alternative fuels are {{becoming}} more widespread on ferries.

30|$|In this paper, the {{electrochemical}} {{performance of a}} H 2 electrode-supported Ni–YSZ/YSZ/LSM–YSZ RSOFC with LSM infiltrated oxygen electrode was investigated under <b>both</b> <b>fuel</b> cell and electrolysis modes.

50|$|When calculating {{specific}} impulse, only propellant that {{is carried}} with the vehicle before use is counted.

50|$|Since {{the use of}} <b>both</b> <b>fuel</b> and {{oxidizer}} preburners {{results in}} full gasification of each propellant before entering the combustion chamber, FFSC engines belong to a border class of rocket engines called gas-gas engines. Full gasification of components leads to faster chemical reactions in the combustion chamber, which improves performance.|$|R
50|$|A petrol-paraffin engine {{differs from}} a single-fuel petrol engine in that two {{independent}} fuel tanks containing petrol and paraffin (respectively) are required, but <b>both</b> <b>fuels</b> may be supplied {{through the same}} carburetor or fuel injection system.
