Historians debate whether there was much long-term impact on the postwar roles of women.|$|E

500|$|Feeling {{much more}} confident, D'Oliveira {{expected}} {{to be successful in}} the Oval Test match. Before the game, an unnamed MCC official circulated a story that D'Oliveira had been offered thousands of pounds to keep himself available for the South Africa tour. This was a similar story to that which D'Oliveira had told Oosthuizen; it had probably travelled back to the MCC via South Africa, but was not true. When the game began, Australia held a 1–0 lead after four Tests; England needed a win to level the series. England made a reasonable start on the first day, but a late wicket brought D'Oliveira in to bat with the game delicately poised. Oborne observes that D'Oliveira was under huge pressure, both for simple cricketing reasons and <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> was watching to see if he would be successful. Wisden reported: [...] "In the last hour D'Oliveira began his fine effort. He hooked the short ball superbly". At {{the end of the first}} day, he had scored 23 runs.|$|E

Mukasakindi attained qualification into the Games because her fastest time of two hours, 40 minutes and 18 minutes, set at the 2012 Cagliari Marathon, was two minutes and 42 seconds faster than the [...] "B" [...] qualifying standard for her event, the marathon. She was initially denied entry into the Games <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> athletics governing body, the International Association of Athletics Federations, did not recognise the Cagliari Marathon as an eligible event for qualification. Injuries and poor performances from other athletes allowed her to enter the Olympics. Mukasakindi participated in the marathon, held on 5 August, finishing 101st out of 107 competitors, with a time of two hours, 51 minutes and seven seconds. She finished ahead of Luvsanlkhündegiin Otgonbayar of Mongolia (two hours, 52 minutes and 15 seconds) and Evelin Talts from Estonia (two hours, 54 minutes and 15 seconds) but behind Australia's Benita Willis (two hours, 49 minutes and 38 seconds).

2500|$|According to Kant, the {{categorical}} imperative {{is possible}} because whilst {{we can be}} thought of as members of both of these worlds (understanding and appearance), it is the world of understanding that “contains the ground of the world of sense [...] and so too of its laws.” What this means is that the world of understanding is more fundamental than or ‘grounds’ the world of sense. Because of this, the moral law, which clearly applies to the world of understanding, also applies to the world of sense as well, <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> of understanding has priority. To put the point slightly differently: <b>Because</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> of understanding is more fundamental and primary, its laws hold for the world of sense too. So the moral law binds us even in the world of appearances.|$|E

[...] Therefore, evils and imperfections persist <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> is fallen. [...] William A. Dembski argues that the effects of Adam's sin recorded in the Book of Genesis were 'back-dated' by God, and hence applied to the earlier history of the universe.|$|E

2500|$|Māyā—defined as a {{temporary}} illusion or [...] "unreality"—is one of the core deviations from the pursuit of God and salvation: where worldly attractions which give only illusory temporary satisfaction and pain which distract {{the process of the}} devotion of God. However, Nanak emphasised māyā as not a reference to the unreality of the world, but of its values. In Sikhism, the influences of ego, anger, greed, attachment, and lust—known as the Five Thieves—are believed to be particularly distracting and hurtful. Sikhs believe the world is currently in a state of Kali Yuga (Age of Darkness) <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> is led astray by the love of and attachment to Maya. The fate of people vulnerable to the Five Thieves ('Pānj Chor'), is separation from God, and the situation may be remedied only after intensive and relentless devotion.|$|E
2500|$|Early American Kierkegaard {{scholars}} {{tried to}} reduce the complexity of Kierkegaard's authorship by focusing on three levels of individual existence, which are named in passing by one of Kierkegaard's pseudonyms, Johannes Climacus, who wrote Concluding Unscientific Postscript.

2500|$|Taṇhā, states Peter Harvey, {{is the key}} {{origin of}} dukkha in Buddhism. It {{reflects}} a mental state of craving. Greater the craving, more is the frustration <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> is always changing and innately unsatisfactory; craving also brings about pain through conflict and quarrels between individuals, which are all a state of Dukkha. It is such taṇhā that leads to rebirth and endless Samsara, stated Buddha as the second reality, and it is marked by three types of craving: sensory, being or non-existence. In Buddhist theosophy, there are right view and wrong view. The wrong views, it ultimately traces to Taṇhā, but it also asserts that [...] "ordinary right view" [...] such as giving and donations to monks, is also a form of clinging. The end of Taṇhā occurs when the person has accepted the [...] "transcendent right view" [...] through the insight into impermanence and non-self.|$|E

2500|$|According to Mullin, on {{the other}} hand, it is {{improbable}} that the Manchus would have murdered any of these four for being 'unmanageable' since {{it would have been}} in their best interests to have strong Dalai Lamas ruling in Lhasa, he argues, agreeing with Richardson that it was rather [...] "the ambition and greed for power of Tibetans" [...] that might have caused the Lamas' early deaths. Further, if Tibetan nobles murdered any of them, which is quite possible, it would {{more likely to have been}} in order to protect or enhance their personal family interests rather than out of suspicion that the Dalai Lamas were seen as Chinese-appointed imposters as suggested by Norbu. They could have also easily died from illnesses, possibly contracted from diseases to which they had no immunity, carried to Lhasa by the multitudes of pilgrims visiting him from nearby countries for personal blessings. Finally, from the Buddhist point of view, Mullin says, [...] "Simply stated, these four Dalai Lamas died young <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> did not have enough good karma to deserve their presence".|$|E
2500|$|According to {{a report}} {{conducted}} by the University of Pennsylvania, anywhere from 100,000 up to 300,000 American children {{at any given time}} may be at risk of exploitation due to factors such as drug use, homelessness, or other factors connected with increased risk for commercial sexual exploitation. However, the report emphasized, [...] "The numbers presented in these exhibits do not, therefore, reflect the actual number of cases of CSEC in the United States but, rather, what we estimate to be the number of children ‘at risk’ of commercial sexual exploitation." [...] Richard J. Estes, one of the report's authors, noted that the report was based on 25 year old data, and was out of date <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> of the 1990s [...] "was quite a different one from that in which we live today." [...] A report from the University of New Hampshire says that only 1,700 kids reported having engaged in prostitution.

2500|$|In other dialogues, the Sophist, Statesman, Republic, and the Parmenides, Plato himself {{associates}} {{knowledge with}} the apprehension of unchanging Forms and their relationships {{to one another}} (which he calls [...] "expertise" [...] in Dialectic), including through the processes of collection and division. More explicitly, Plato himself argues in the Timaeus that knowledge is always proportionate to the realm from which it is gained. In other words, if one derives one's account of something experientially, <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> of sense is in flux, the views therein attained will be mere opinions. And opinions are characterized {{by a lack of}} necessity and stability. On the other hand, if one derives one's account of something by way of the non-sensible forms, because these forms are unchanging, so too is the account derived from them. That apprehension of forms is required for knowledge may be taken to cohere with Plato's theory in the Theaetetus and Meno. Indeed, the apprehension of Forms may be {{at the base of the}} [...] "account" [...] required for justification, in that it offers foundational knowledge which itself needs no account, thereby avoiding an infinite regression.|$|E
