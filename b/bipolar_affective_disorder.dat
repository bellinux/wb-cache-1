25|$|John Carthy {{was born}} the only son of John and Rose Carthy on 9 October 1972. He had one sister, Marie, who was two years his junior. He was an avid Handballer and member of Abbeylara Handball Club. His father, with whom he was very close, died on 12 April 1990. In 1992 John was {{diagnosed}} with clinical depression and, subsequently with <b>bipolar</b> <b>affective</b> <b>disorder.</b> John's general employment was in the construction industry. He resided with his mother in an old, three-bedroom house in Toneymore, Abbeylara. She and John were due to move from this old house to a new home which had been built on their land by Longford County Council {{as part of a}} rural housing scheme. The old house was due to be demolished. On 19 April 2000, the day prior to his death, John stayed in the family home all day with his mother. His mother's testimony to the Barr Tribunal indicated that John was very hostile to the move and that this was the primary topic of their discussions that day.|$|E

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{determine}} the rate of unipolar mania and compare its characteristics {{with those of other}} <b>bipolar</b> <b>affective</b> <b>disorders</b> in a psychiatric hospital in the Fiji Islands. Fifty-one patients with unipolar mania seen between January 1999 and October 2000, had their diagnosis confirmed using the Schedules for Clinical Assessment in Neuropsychiatry and the International Classification of Diseases, 10 th edition. Their demographic and clinical characteristics were compared with those of 31 manic-depressive patients seen during the period under review. Unipolar mania constituted 47. 2 % of the <b>bipolar</b> <b>affective</b> <b>disorders</b> in this sample. The frequency of episodes, duration of affective illness, mean age at onset, gender distribution, marital status, employment status and race were not significantly different for the unipolar manic and manic-depressive groups (p > 0. 05). Family history of major psychiatric morbidity was 9. 8 % for the unipolar manic patients and 22. 6 % for the manic-depressive group (p > 0. 05).

Both mania and depression bring risks of substance misuse and disrupted relationships. Management requires an optimal therapeutic alliance with good communication, appropriate treatment and sometimes compulsory care during crises. Preventive strategies are invaluable...|$|R

40|$|It is {{generally}} accepted that electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) {{is an effective}} treatment of major depressive episodes in patients with both unipolar and <b>bipolar</b> <b>affective</b> <b>disorders</b> (1). Yet, repeated relapse of depression occurs in some patients, even with vigorous maintenance therapy on antidepressant drugs (2 - 4). This often necessitates rehospitalization for ECT. In past decades, several authors suggested that periodic outpatient ECT was efficacious as a maintenance therapy (5 - 7). Recently, maintenance ECT was recommended by Fink (8), and Maletzky (9), but barely mentioned in two reviews (10, 11), and discouraged in another (12). However, a recent nationwide survey has disclosed that such therapy is widely practiced (13) ...|$|R

In addition, these two groups showed frequent relapses after termination of the prophylaxis. The number of episodes preceding the prophylaxis and the absence of unipolar depression are found to be predictors of effectiveness.
