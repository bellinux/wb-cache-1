25|$|The 1st Buckinghamshire Battalion, a Territorial {{unit of the}} Ox and Bucks, was {{converted}} to a <b>Beach</b> <b>Group</b> battalion in March 1943 and was to provide the infantry support for the 6th <b>Beach</b> <b>Group.</b> In April 1943 the battalion moved to Scotland to commence training for its new role. The 1st Bucks formed part of the 6th <b>Beach</b> <b>Group</b> landing on Sword Beach on D-Day, 6 June 1944. An anti-tank platoon of 1st Bucks landed on the first tide of the invasion on D-Day, 6 June 1944. The remainder of 1st Bucks landed on the second tide of the invasion on D-Day. German gunners fired at the 1st Bucks from Lebisey wood and from the high ground at Houlgate; there was also much sniping from houses along the beachfront. The 1st Bucks established themselves on Queen Red and Queen White sectors of Sword Beach opposite La Breche on the eastern most landing site of the invasion. The role of the 1st Bucks was to organise the units on the landing beaches and was also deployed to defend the beachhead area from German counter-attacks as troops from the 3rd British Infantry Division moved inland. The 1st Bucks became part of 101 Beach Sub Area of No 6 <b>Beach</b> <b>Group,</b> 3rd Infantry Division and {{took part in the}} defence of Ouistreham in June. Lieutenant Colonel RDR Sale commanded both 1st Bucks and 6th <b>Beach</b> <b>Group</b> and after the Commander of No 5 <b>Beach</b> <b>Group</b> Lieutenant Colonel DHV Board was killed soon after landing, Sale assumed command of both Beach Groups approximately 7,000 men. Sale was awarded the George Medal for his role in limiting the damage caused by a German air attack, on an ammunition dump at La Breche, near Ouistreham, on 8 June. In July companies and platoons of 1st Bucks were transferred to other British divisions, including to the 2nd Ox and Bucks (the 52nd) in the 6th Airborne Division and to the Black Watch (Royal Highland Regiment) and other units in the 51st (Highland) Infantry Division, as replacements for the defence of the Normandy bridgehead. The battalion was later reformed but remained, {{for the rest of the}} war, on lines of communication duties. The 1st Bucks was placed into suspended animation in June 1946 and the battalion was finally disbanded on 7 August 1946.|$|E
25|$|There {{was little}} enemy air {{activity}} during the night. For example, F Troop fired 50 rounds without success, but at 06.30 on D + 1 a lone Focke-Wulf Fw 190 crossed {{the beach and}} was shot down by the first round from Sergeant Appleby's No 3 Detachment. Later, No 2 Detachment shelled a German strongpoint that had caused casualties to 2nd Battalion Hertfordshire Regiment of No 9 <b>Beach</b> <b>Group.</b>|$|E
25|$|The 2/4th Pioneer Battalion was {{a unit of}} the Australian Army {{raised for}} service during the Second World War. A pioneer unit, the {{battalion}} undertook both infantry and engineer tasks. Despite being raised early in the war, the battalion did not see action until the final months, taking part in the Borneo campaign where, as part of the 1st <b>Beach</b> <b>Group,</b> it fought against the Japanese in support of the 9th Division. It was disbanded in early 1946 following the end of hostilities.|$|E

25|$|On 30 May 1944, the Liverpool Irish {{moved from}} its camp in {{southern}} England {{to the port}} of Southampton, where the 8th embarked aboard troopships and landing ship tanks in early June. Elements of the Liverpool Irish embarked aboard the Ulster Monarch, formerly a passenger ship on the Belfast-Liverpool line. After a delay of 24 hours, the invasion fleet proceeded to Normandy on 5 June. The 7th <b>Beach</b> <b>Group</b> landed at Juno Beach with the 3rd Canadian Infantry Division on 6 June 1944, D-Day.|$|E
25|$|The Allied plans also {{expected}} that Tarakan would {{be transformed into}} a major base within days of the landing. Under the pre-invasion planning it was intended that a wing of fighter aircraft would be based at Tarakan six days after the landing and this force would be expanded to include an attack wing nine days later and staging facilities for a further four squadrons of aircraft within 21 days of the landing. It was {{also expected}} that the 26th Brigade Group and its supporting <b>beach</b> <b>group</b> would be ready to leave Tarakan by 21 May and the RAAF units could be redeployed in mid-June after providing support for the landing at Balikpapan.|$|E
25|$|Liverpool's large Irish {{community}} {{formed the}} 64th Lancashire Rifle Volunteer Corps on 25 April 1860, {{one of many}} volunteer corps raised in Lancashire in response to heightened tension with France. The Liverpool Irish became a volunteer (later Territorial Force) battalion of the King's (Liverpool Regiment) in July 1881. As such, it fought in the Second Boer War and First World War, sustaining thousands of casualties in numerous battles that prominently included Givenchy, Guillemont, Third Ypres, and the Hundred Days Offensive. Disbanded after the Great War in 1922, the Liverpool Irish reformed in 1939 before the Second World War and constituted {{the nucleus of the}} 7th <b>Beach</b> <b>Group</b> that landed at Juno Beach on 6 June 1944, D-Day.|$|E

25|$|In March and April the {{regiment}} handed over its 3.7-inch guns to active regiments in AA Command and re-equipped with the obsolescent 3-inch gun for mobile training. This included beach landing demonstrations and training with the Beach groups {{that had been}} formed for Overlord. 220 Battery of 73rd LAA Rgt, assigned to the same <b>beach</b> <b>group,</b> also joined {{the regiment}} for training. During the summer of 1943, the regiment trained intensively, attending gunnery practice camps at Redesdale and Ramsgate, training for beach landings in Scotland and Pembrokeshire, and then another practice camp at Whitby in November. That month the regiment handed in its 3-inch guns and was fully equipped with 24 of the modern 3.7-inch gun. At {{the end of the}} year the regiment was stationed across Ross & Cromarty and Renfrewshire.|$|E
25|$|The 2nd Battalion {{was formed}} around {{the core of}} 1 and 2 {{companies}} of the 1st Battalion. It joined 162nd Infantry Brigade of the 54th (East Anglian) Division alongside the 1st Battalion and was employed in anti-invasion duties {{until the end of}} 1942. In July 1943 it re-rolled to become the infantry element of a ‘Beach Group’. The task of these new units was to provide local defence and communications on the landing beaches during the invasion of Europe. Alongside the infantry, they comprised a number of specialist sections drawn from the technical branches, as well as balloon and anti-aircraft artillery detachments, the total force amounting to around 5,000 men. The 2nd Hertfordshires joined 9 <b>Beach</b> <b>Group,</b> and the commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel J.R. Harper, was appointed overall commander.|$|E
25|$|The {{regiment}} {{moved its}} base to Ardrossan in Scotland in mid-May, {{but during the}} spring and summer of 1943 the unit took part in practice camps in various parts of the country and in training exercises simulating assault landings on a hostile shore. 220 Bty trained with No 6 <b>Beach</b> <b>Group</b> and 103rd Heavy AA Rgt, with which it would land on D-Day. When not training, the mobile regiments could be deployed to assist AA Command. In late August, on completion of a beach landing exercise in Pembrokeshire, 73rd LAA Rgt was attached to 5th AA Bde at Eastbourne, Brighton, Pevensey and Seaford, East Sussex on the South Coast, which was still subject to 'hit and run' attacks by the Luftwaffe. During the winter of 1943–44 the regiment was stationed in Ross and Cromarty and Morayshire in Scotland, with RHQ at Gordon Castle.|$|E
5|$|Under fire, the <b>beach</b> <b>groups</b> {{collected}} the wounded and dead, located and marked minefields, attempted to maintain organisation, and directed vehicles and troops inland. The two battalions operated with the <b>beach</b> <b>groups</b> {{for a further}} six weeks. While the depleted Liverpool Irish disbanded in August, much of its strength having been transferred to other units as reinforcements, the 5th King's survived as a reduced cadre. Disbandment had only been avoided through the determination of Lieutenant Colonel G.D. Wreford-Brown, who argued that the 5th Battalion was nearly the most senior unit active in the Territorial Army.|$|R
50|$|From spring 1942, on the {{formation}} of the beach commandos, training was begun at Ardentinny, with amphibious training on Loch Long. R.A.F. units and other formations destined for the <b>beach</b> <b>groups</b> were trained at Gailes Camp near Irvine, North Ayrshire.|$|R
50|$|On 8 June, a German fighter plane {{dropped a}} bomb on the petrol and {{ammunition}} depot on Sword, with the ensuing fire threatening to destroy {{large quantities of}} supplies. Men of 5 and 6 <b>Beach</b> <b>Groups</b> worked to save the supplies; seven of whom were awarded the George Medal.|$|R
25|$|The battalion's final {{involvement}} in the war came in mid-1945 when it deployed to support both the 7th and 9th Divisions in Operation Oboe {{as part of the}} 2nd <b>Beach</b> <b>Group.</b> In this role they participated in both the Battle of Tarakan and the Battle of Balikpapan during the Borneo campaign. During this campaign, the battalion was used primarily as a labour force around the beachhead, unloading stores and equipment, maintaining defensive positions and guarding prisoners. Following the end of hostilities in August 1945, the battalion was disbanded in late 1945. The 2/2nd's casualties during the war amounted to 394 killed in action or died on active service, and 121 wounded. Members of the battalion received the following decorations: two Distinguished Service Orders, five Officers of the Order of the British Empire, two Military Crosses, two British Empire Medals, 13 Military Medals and 13 Mentions in Despatches.|$|E
25|$|On 12 March 1965 Terrell County {{departed}} the Ryūkyū Islands, {{bound for}} South Vietnam. She arrived at Da Nang four days later, unloaded embarked men and cargo, {{and then returned}} to Yokosuka for major overhaul. The ship returned to Vietnamese waters following the refit and transported Marine Air Control Squadron 9 to the American base at Chu Lai, South Vietnam, before returning to Japanese waters. Operational commitments subsequently overrode refresher training out of Yokosuka in July, forcing the ship to embark Naval <b>Beach</b> <b>Group</b> 1. Dispatched to Okinawa on 1 August 1965, Terrell County evaded a typhoon en route and made port to load Regimental Landing Team 7 before sailing on 9 August 1965 for Chu Lai. Remaining at that American base from 15 to 17 August, the ship evaded two typhoons en route back to Japanese waters before she reached Yokosuka on 25 August.|$|E
25|$|The Territorial Army was {{expanded}} in March 1939 and the Liverpool Irish resultingly reformed with headquarters at the Embassy Rooms, Mount Pleasant. Recruitment commenced in May {{under the supervision}} of the battalion's first commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Ernest Michael Murphy. Upon Murphy's retirement in 1940, Lieutenant Colonel William Henry Hynes transferred from the Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers and assumed command. The battalion was assigned to the 198th Infantry Brigade, alongside the 6th and 7th Border Regiment, which was assigned to the 66th Infantry Division until late June 1940 when it was disbanded and later assigned to the 1st London Infantry Division until December, and finally to the 54th (East Anglian) Infantry Division. For three years, the battalion trained and was assigned various duties across Britain, initially in Morecambe and Yorkshire. As the Allies made plans to invade occupied France in 1943, the Liverpool Irish was selected to form the nucleus of the 7th <b>Beach</b> <b>Group.</b> The group's objectives on an invasion beach were to maintain organisation, secure positions, and provide defence against counter-attack. Extensive specialist training occurred in Ayrshire and other parts of Britain under the command of Lieutenant Colonel W.J. Humphrey.|$|E

25|$|The Allied force {{responsible}} for capturing Tarakan was centred around the very experienced Australian 26th Brigade Group of nearly 12,000 soldiers. The 26th Brigade had been formed in 1940 {{and had seen}} action in North Africa and New Guinea. The brigade's infantry component was the 2/23rd, 2/24th and 2/48th Battalions, also with much war experience. These battalions were joined by the 2/4th Commando Squadron and the 2/3rd Pioneer Battalion, which fought as infantry in this battle. The brigade group also included the 2/7th Field Regiment equipped with 24 25-pounder guns, a squadron from the 2/9th Armoured Regiment operating 18 Matilda tanks, a company of the 2/2nd Machine Gun Battalion, the 53rd Composite Anti-Aircraft Regiment and two engineer field squadrons. These combat units were supported by {{a large number of}} logistics and medical units, including the 2nd <b>Beach</b> <b>Group</b> whose role was to land supplies from the invasion fleet. While the 26th Brigade Group greatly outnumbered the known strength of Tarakan's Japanese defenders, the Allies committed this large force as their previous experience indicated that {{it would be difficult to}} defeat the Japanese force if it retreated into Tarakan's rugged interior.|$|E
500|$|Mackay became {{convinced}} that Herring was becoming increasingly difficult to work with {{as a result of}} stress and fatigue and asked Blamey for permission to relieve him. Blamey's response was characteristic: Morshead would be on the next plane. Yet Blamey maintained his faith in Herring, who retained command of I Corps on the Atherton Tableland, where he trained his men for the next operation. He did not know when or where this would be, so he focused on amphibious warfare. He created the 1st <b>Beach</b> <b>Group</b> and developed tactics and doctrine for amphibious operations based on his own experience in the New Guinea Campaign and reports from the Allied invasion of Sicily. [...] The benefits of his work would be realised in the Borneo Campaign.|$|E
