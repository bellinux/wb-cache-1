25|$|Most of Smith's {{stories are}} set in an era {{starting}} some 14,000 years in the future. The Instrumentality of Mankind rules Earth {{and goes on to}} control other planets later inhabited by humanity. The Instrumentality attempts to revive old cultures and languages in a process known as the Rediscovery of Man. This rediscovery {{can be seen as the}} initial period when humankind emerges from a mundane utopia and the nonhuman Underpeople gain freedom from slavery. It may also be viewed as part of a continuing process begun by the Instrumentality, encompassing the whole cycle, where mankind is constantly at risk of falling back into <b>bad</b> <b>old</b> ways.|$|E
500|$|There is {{much debate}} whether a public–private divide in {{administrative}} law is necessary. It has been contended {{that such a}} division has [...] "turned {{the law in the}} wrong direction, away from flexibility of procedure and towards a rigidity reminiscent of the <b>bad</b> <b>old</b> days...". Peter Leyland and Gordon Anthony have suggested that a more desirable alternative presents itself in Northern Ireland, where the test for amenability to review is dependent on the [...] "public interest" [...] in the issue. Thus, the public–private divide does not function {{at the expense of the}} legitimate interests of individuals.|$|E
500|$|MacPhisto {{was created}} to parody the devil and was named after Mephistopheles of the Faust legend. Initially called [...] "Mr. Gold", MacPhisto wore a gold lamé suit with gold {{platform}} shoes, pale makeup, lipstick, and devil's horns atop his head. As MacPhisto, Bono spoke with an exaggerated upper-class English accent, {{similar to that of}} a down-on-his-luck character actor. The character was created as a European replacement for the American-influenced Mirror Ball Man. The initial inspiration for MacPhisto came from the stage musical The Black Rider. Realisation of the character did not come about until rehearsal the night before the first of the 1993 shows. According to Bono, [...] "We came up with a sort of old English Devil, a pop star long past his prime returning regularly from sessions on The Strip in Vegas and regaling anyone who would listen to him at cocktail hour with stories from the good old, <b>bad</b> <b>old</b> days." [...] MacPhisto sang the closing [...] "Can't Help Falling in Love" [...] with an oddly childlike manner that many reviewers found one of the most poignant moments of the show.|$|E

500|$|Robert Bianco of USA Today praised Fox's performance, {{saying that}} it was almost worthy of an Emmy Award nomination. [...] The Star-Ledgers Alan Sepinwall of gave the episode a mixed review, saying that [...] "I find [...] and his love life {{simultaneously}} boring and obnoxious … [...] insufferable"; however, he enjoyed the subplots and commended the acting by Matthew Fox and Jorge Garcia. [...] James Poniewozik of Time did not enjoy the flashforwards, commenting that they were [...] "the first of the flashforwards that resembled one of the <b>bad</b> <b>old</b> flashbacks, in that it just reconfirmed character traits we already knew and showed Jack and Kate falling into patterns we knew from the past … I didn't get much from it". [...] IGN's Chris Carabott gave the episode a 7.5/10, making it his least favorite episode of the season. [...] Carabott wrote that [...] "this season [...] seems to have been relegated to playing second fiddle … oddly enough, even in his own episode, Jack really isn't given much to do" [...] and stated that [...] "the possible rekindling of Jack and Kate's romantic relationship on the island is juxtaposed quite well with their relationship during the flashforward." [...] Dan Compora of SyFy Portal wrote that [...] "the pace … was a bit too slow" [...] and [...] "I usually like the Jack-centered episodes, but a bout of appendicitis simply does not make for high drama or stimulating action"; however, he noted that [...] "all in all, this was a good episode, but it was nothing special." [...] Compora praised Fox's increasingly good acting, but said that [...] "this season has seen much stronger lead performances from Michael Emerson [...] and Henry Ian Cusick [...]" [...] Erin Martell of AOL's TV Squad called [...] "Something Nice Back Home" [...] "a break after last week's action- and information-packed episode", argued that Rousseau was not given a proper death and enjoyed Rose and Bernard's roles. [...] UGO's Sara shared Martell's sentiments in regard to Rose and Bernard's appearances and speculated that [...] "Something Nice Back Home" [...] would not be enjoyed by fans who like Rousseau or do not like Jack. [...] Ben Rawson-Jones of Digital Spy gave the episode three out of five stars, saying that [...] "the Jack-Kate romantic intrigue is rather dull, while the appendix plot feels like an unnecessary narrative obstacle for viewers to surmount." ...|$|E

2500|$|In February 2006, Tutu {{repeated}} {{these statements}} after a UN report was published {{which called for}} {{the closure of the}} camp. Tutu stated that the Guantanamo camp was a stain on the character of the United States, while the legislation in Britain which gave a 28-day detention period for terror suspects was [...] "excessive" [...] and [...] "untenable". Tutu claimed that arguments being made in Britain and the United States were similar to those the South African apartheid regime had used. [...] "It is disgraceful and one cannot find strong enough words to condemn what Britain and the United States and some of their allies have accepted," [...] said Tutu. Tutu also spoke against Tony Blair's failed attempt to hold terrorist suspects in Britain for up to 90 days without charge. [...] "Ninety days for a South African is an awful déjà-vu because we had in South Africa in the <b>bad</b> <b>old</b> days a 90-day detention law," [...] he said. Under apartheid, as at Guantanamo, people were held for [...] "unconscionably long periods" [...] and then released, he said.|$|E
