This method is used to implement arrays and table look-ups; since the addition was done on both whole words, it was also used to modify the op. code in a following (extracode) instruction, and on rare occasions both functions at once.|$|E
2500|$|The {{most common}} {{practice}} throughout human {{history has been}} to start counting at one, {{and this is the}} practice in early classic computer science programming languages such as Fortran and COBOL. However, in the late 1950s LISP introduced zero-based numbering for arrays while Algol 58 introduced completely flexible basing for array subscripts (allowing any positive, negative, or zero integer as base for array subscripts), and most subsequent programming languages adopted one or other of these positions. For example, the elements of an array are numbered starting from 0 in C, so that for an array of n items the sequence of array indices runs from 0 to [...] This permits an array element's location to be calculated by adding the index directly to address of the array, whereas 1-based languages precalculate the array's <b>base</b> <b>address</b> to be the position one element before the first.|$|E

For that purpose, efficient address translation of virtual address to physical address is critical. In this study, we propose a system call <b>based</b> <b>address</b> translation scheme where every translation {{is done by the}} kernel instead of a translation cache on a network interface controller as in the previous cache <b>based</b> <b>address</b> translation.

50|$|Under the {{relative}} addressing scheme, {{to obtain an}} absolute address, the relevant <b>base</b> <b>address</b> is taken and offset (aka displacement) is added to it.

40|$|Ethernet {{has gained}} {{popularity}} for deploying in Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs) {{due to its}} ease of management and highly cost effective. While the flat addressing scheme (i. e., nonhierarchical MAC addresses) and the broadcast <b>based</b> <b>address</b> resolution scheme simplify many aspects of configuration, they also bring poor scalability. This paper aims at developing an efficient and scalable Metro-Ethernet architecture. To achieve this goal, we propose a Distributed Registration <b>based</b> <b>Address</b> Resolution Protocol (DRARP) and an End user enabled Mac-in-Mac (EMiM) encapsulation scheme. DRARP solves an unknown address through unicast, and hence eliminates the broadcast messages. EMiM does Mac-in-Mac (MiM) encapsulation by end users instead of the Provider Edge (PE) nodes, thus significantly reducing the PE node’s forwarding table size. The proposed architecture sustains the Ethernet’s plug-and-play feature and provides high scalability. The simulation {{results show that the}} proposed schemes can save more than 60 % communication messages for address resolution and up to 80 % forwarding table size in PE nodes.
