25|$|Caution {{number seven}} waved around lap 220, after David Gilliland turned Alex Bowman into the wall. Earnhardt, Allmendinger, and Kurt Busch stayed out, but {{everyone}} else pitted, with Logano coming off of pit road first. After another quick caution and restart for debris, Kurt Busch {{took the lead}} from Earnhardt on lap 243, and Johnson took over from Busch two laps later. The ninth caution waved at lap 250 after Ryan Truex go turned into the wall, {{and all of the}} leaders made pit stops. Kenseth, however, stayed out and reassumed the lead, with Tony Stewart taking second. Johnson and Earnhardt would come out of pit road first to restart third and fourth, respectively. Earnhardt took the lead on lap 260, Johnson took over once again on lap 265, and then Clint Bowyer charged to the front and took the lead on lap 284 but gave it back to Johnson four laps later and faded <b>back</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit.</b> Meanwhile, Kenseth and Stewart, who both stayed out during the previous caution, would fall back quickly, with Kenseth being lapped on lap 304 and Stewart losing a lap ten laps later. Other drivers had problems as well, with Alex Bowman cutting a tire and Denny Hamlin getting a windshield tear-off stuck over the opening to his left-front brake duct. Lap 316 saw the tenth caution as Joe Nemechek slammed the wall, and all of the leaders pitted and retained their positions. The eleventh caution flew on lap 341 as 20th-place Kyle Larson spun out of turn two, and the leaders pitted once again, with Johnson and Bowyer keeping their first and second-place positions. Bowyer nosed ahead on the restart and led a lap, but Johnson retook the lead the next lap as another caution waved for debris. Edwards would nose ahead on the next restart but fail to lead a lap before Johnson pulled away. The 13th caution flew on lap 411 as Brad Keselowski spun Martin Truex, Jr. in turn two, and on the ensuing pit stops, an exiting Edwards hit an entering Matt Kenseth, spinning Kenseth around backwards into his pit stall. Johnson retained the lead on the restart, ahead of Bowyer and Edwards. Kurt Busch would then move up second and challenge Johnson but fell back and was passed by Bowyer. Bowyer then chased Johnson down, and, after a slip by Johnson, took the lead on lap 449. On lap 459, Carl Edwards spun to bring out the 14th caution, and Bowyer fell back to tenth during pit stops, allowing Johnson to retake the lead ahead of Joey Logano. Johnson barely retained the lead on the lap 465 restart, but began to pull away as Kurt Busch slipped into second. Busch would then run down and pass Johnson in about five laps, but Johnson would once again retake the lead on lap 482, with that pass setting a new track record with 32 lead changes. Busch retook the lead on lap 488 (the 33rd lead change) and held off Johnson to break a winless drought dating back to the 2011 AAA 400, ironically another race that Johnson led the most laps in but was beaten late by Busch. Earnhardt finished third, Joey Logano fourth, Marcos Ambrose fifth, and Matt Kenseth sixth.|$|E
500|$|Dreams {{differed}} to Evermore's earlier [...] "retro-sounding, riff-based pop-rock" [...] works, {{and instead}} contained a more [...] "spacious" [...] sound according to Jon. He said he drew inspiration and {{was influenced by}} Silverchair and Muse, as well as Pink Floyd. Jon {{also noted that the}} band initially wanted to create a concept album, but stated that [...] "we sort of had to tone it <b>back</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit,</b> because we wanted to make a double album". Soundgenerator.com reviewer Eleanor Goodman described Dreams as [...] "clear rather than grungy, soulful rather than angsty".|$|E
500|$|Seamus Blackley {{designed}} the game's physics system, {{which is a}} modified version of the one he wrote for Looking Glass's flight simulator Flight Unlimited. At the time, Church described it as [...] "far more sophisticated than what you would normally use for an indoor game". The system governs, among other things, weapon recoil and the arc of thrown objects; the latter behave differently based on their weight and velocity. The game's most complex physics model is that of the player character. Church explained that the character's head [...] "tilts forward when you start to run, and jerks <b>back</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> when you stop", and that, after an impact against a surface or object, its [...] "head is knocked in the direction opposite the hit, with proportion to [...] mass and velocity of the objects involved". On coding physics for Looking Glass Technologies games, Blackley later said, [...] "If games don't obey physics, we somehow feel that something isn't right", and that [...] "the biggest compliment to me is when a gamer doesn't notice the physics, but only notices that things feel the way they should".|$|E

500|$|On race day California Chrome did {{not break}} boldly. Espinoza later {{explained}} something felt [...] "off" [...] and he held the horse <b>back</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> {{instead of going to}} the lead. When asked to move to the front, the horse did not unleash his usual burst of speed. Immediately following the race, Espinoza said [...] "He was just a little bit empty today". [...] Tonalist won the race, and California Chrome finished fourth in a dead heat with Wicked Strong. [...] Initial post-race analysts criticized Espinoza for not taking the horse to the front early on, but noticed that California Chrome had had some blood on his right front heel. After the race, review of photos taken at the start showed that the horse next to him, Matterhorn, moved too far to the left and stepped on California Chrome's heel as both horses broke from the gate. [...] As a result, California Chrome had run the race with a [...] "chunk" [...] of tissue taken out of his right front heel and a small cut on his tendon. The tendon injury was superficial, but the heel injury may have been a factor in his loss. [...] Sherman explained that he knew that something was not right when he saw the horse throw his head up in the homestretch, and speculated later that the sand and dirt of the racetrack caused pain in the open wound. [...] The following day, Sherman assured the press that both injuries would heal.|$|E
500|$|Paul Brannigan of Q {{gave the}} album {{four out of}} five stars. He said that the album is [...] "largely characterised by joyous new wave-influenced rock'n'roll, {{and for the first time}} in their 19-year career, Pearl Jam {{actually}} sound—whisper it—fun. No, honestly." [...] Josh Modell of Spin gave the album {{four out of five}} stars. He said, [...] "For the first time in years, Pearl Jam are seizing the moment rather than wallowing in it." [...] Time reviewer Josh Tyrangiel said, [...] "The songs here are built on hooks, covered with guitar fuzz, and then trimmed <b>back</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> so the melody abides." [...] Tyrangiel added, [...] "Nothing revolutionary, but Backspacer provides an adrenaline jolt that shouldn't be underestimated either." [...] Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly gave the album a B, saying that Backspacer is [...] "the sort of sweaty rock & roll that belongs in a bar with cracked-leather booths and $2 beers," [...] and that it [...] "grows same-y, but tracks like the surfing-as-life-metaphor anthem 'Amongst the Waves' do indeed make something old feel, if not new, good again." [...] The New York Times said that [...] "Pearl Jam... —mostly—to equate maturity with slowing down," [...] but added, [...] "Pearl Jam's quandary is that with fewer outside targets or frustrations to rail against, it risks turning sanctimonious... Pearl Jam's music doesn't align well with satisfaction." [...] Joshua Love of Pitchfork said that the album [...] "seems to suggest in its tossed-off 37 minutes that Pearl Jam have no greater concern and regard for what they do than the rest of the world can muster," [...] and he added that [...] "with the spotlights long since extinguished, Pearl Jam seem content to do things by the book." ...|$|E

2500|$|The bishops {{agreed that}} the pope {{exercises}} supreme authority over the church, but defined [...] "collegiality", meaning that all bishops share in this authority. Local bishops have equal authority as successors of the Apostles and {{as members of a}} larger organization, the Church founded by Jesus Christ and entrusted to the apostles. The pope serves as a symbol of unity and has additional authority to ensure the continuation of that unity. During the Second Vatican Council, Catholic bishops drew <b>back</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> from statements which might anger Christians of other faiths. Cardinal Augustin Bea, the President of the Christian Unity Secretariat had always the full support of Pope Paul VI in his attempts to ensure that the Council language is friendly and open to the sensitivities of Protestant and Orthodox Churches, whom he had invited to all sessions at the request of Pope John XXIII. Bea also was strongly involved in the passage of Nostra aetate, which regulates relation of the Church with the Jewish faith and members of other religions ...|$|E
2500|$|Recording process {{started in}} May 2009 and {{took place in}} four {{different}} recording studios. Main recording was done at Scorpio Sound Studio in Hannover, Germany. Vocals were done in The Garage Studios in Stockholm, while additional vocals were recorded in Vocal Land Studio. Drum parts were recorded at Atlantisstudion in Stockholm. By the mid-December 2009, the band had finished with the recording of the album. Just before Christmas, they invited people from the European record company people to a listening session. After they listened to the whole album {{the next day the}} management told the band that the record company loved it and that it was the best record in years. The management proposed the idea of this album being the last studio album and announcing a final tour. Matthias Jabs explained [...] "We had never spent a second thinking about this. For us, subconsciously, we thought it would go on forever. We were taken <b>back</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit,</b> but after a couple days living with the thought we decided together – that would be the right thing to do.
