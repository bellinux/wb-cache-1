Meanwhile, Huey and Jazmine Dubois are <b>busy</b> <b>testing</b> out a generator in the Freemans' garage. The power at the Freeman house then goes out as a result of Huey's generator bursting, causing an infuriated Granddad and Riley to leave for KFC to buy chicken. It is revealed that he has been testing the generator as a part of his survival plan for his family in the event that a pandemic sweeps the nation. Later, Jazmine asks if she can be included in the plan as well, and eventually convinces a reluctant Huey to do so.|$|R

It {{is one of the}} world's largest integrated range telemetry systems, and certainly the most versatile in weapons support capability. The system supports one of the world's <b>busiest</b> <b>test</b> ranges, serving all U. S. Military Services as well as NASA and others. This paper looks at the White Sands system from the user's view, examining the ways in which it is configured for several weapons tests in a typical day, {{and the way in which}} it can run foreground launch support and background pre-launch activities simultaneously. This system has grown in functional capability since its installation, both in hardware and in software. This paper analyzes that growth to see the reasons and methods. Also, near-term additional growth is addressed...|$|R

Commander Byrd was the last man to climb into the plane. It taxied {{to the end of the}} field and turned for the takeoff. Every man in camp stood silent, watching. When she finally took off we all let out a roar. It was 3;29 p.m. The plane had 1,600 miles to go to the pole. The men left behind {{gathered}} in the radio shack to listen to the sounds of the engines over the loudspeaker. The temperature was 15 degrees above zero. Finally at 1:32 a.m. June’s voice relayed this message from Byrd: ‘My calculations indicate that we have reached the vicinity of the South Pole.’ The camp went wild with joy. The expedition was a success. It was 18 hours and 39 minutes from the time the plane left until it returned. Then the celebration started. We were a happy lot, “ said Bursey.|$|R

40|$|Sexual {{reproduction}} {{is perhaps the}} greatest of all evolutionary puzzles. It's a puzzle because sexually reproducing species pay the cost of spending half their resources (over and above what is needed for vegetative growth) in producing males, whereas parthenogenetic species utilize all their resources meant for reproduction in producing only females (or hermaphrodites) like themselves. This twofold cost of sexual reproduction [1, 2] is sometimes referred to as the twofold cost of producing males. Three advantages of sexual reproduction that might offset this cost have been proposed. Genetic recombination and cross fertilization permit sexually reproducing species to (1) bring together, in the same individual, mutations arising in different individuals [3, 4]; (2) generate genetic variability and thus adapt to changing environments[2, 5, 6]; and (3) shuffle their genes in every generation and thus keep parasites at bay [7, 8, 9]. While evolutionary biologists are <b>busy</b> <b>testing</b> their favourite ideas for offsetting the twofold cost of producing males, recent work by Craig LaMunyon and Samuel Ward[10] shows that a nematode, Caenorhabditis briggsae, appears to have found a way of gaining the benefits of sexual reproduction without paying the cost of producing males...|$|R
5|$|Eichengrün sent ASA to Dreser's {{pharmacology}} {{group for}} testing, {{and the initial}} results were very positive. The next step would normally have been clinical trials, but Dreser opposed further investigation of ASA because of salicylic acid's reputation for weakening the heart—possibly {{a side effect of}} the high doses often used to treat rheumatism. Dreser's group was soon <b>busy</b> <b>testing</b> Felix Hoffmann's next chemical success: diacetylmorphine (which the Bayer team soon branded as heroin because of the heroic feeling it gave them). Eichengrün, frustrated by Dreser's rejection of ASA, went directly to Bayer's Berlin representative Felix Goldmann to arrange low-profile trials with doctors. Though the results of those trials were also very positive, with no reports of the typical salicylic acid complications, Dreser still demurred. However, Carl Duisberg intervened and scheduled full testing. Soon, Dreser admitted ASA's potential and Bayer decided to proceed with production. Dreser wrote a report of the findings to publicize the new drug; in it, he omitted any mention of Hoffmann or Eichengrün. He would also be {{the only one of the}} three to receive royalties for the drug (for testing it), since it was ineligible for any patent the chemists might have taken out for creating it. For many years, however, he attributed Aspirin's discovery solely to Hoffmann.|$|R

50|$|Philip {{continues}} to work on Flubber into the early morning, looking to stabilize the rubber's movement as opposed to stimulation. Philip's watch alarm goes off at 6 a.m. (set wrong) and Weebo informs him that he has missed the third wedding. Philip goes to Sara's office and unsuccessfully attempts to explain the situation to her. Meanwhile, Medfield College sponsor Chester Hoenicker (Raymond J. Barry) is unhappy that Philip failed his son Bennett (Wil Wheaton) in chemistry class. That night, Hoenicker sends his two security guards Smith (Clancy Brown) and Wesson (Ted Levine) to Philip's house {{in an attempt to}} persuade Philip into giving Bennett a better grade. However, Philip is too <b>busy</b> <b>testing</b> the Flubber to even notice them and suddenly knocks them out unconscious with a Flubber-coated golf ball and bowling ball. He uses Flubber to give his vintage Ford Thunderbird flight. During a test run, he discovers Wilson making the moves on Sara (making a bet that she'll buy him dinner if Medfield wins, or join him for a weekend in the mountains if they lose). Afterward, Weebo attempts to confess her love of Philip, only to be shrugged off as a computer. In response, she secretly creates a holographic human version of herself named Sylvia (Leslie Stefanson) in hopes of winning him over. Before Weebo can make out with Philip in this form as he sleeps, Philip awakens with another idea for Flubber. He enters an empty basketball arena and tests the effects of Flubber on a basketball. Later, he gives Flubber-padded shoes to the unskilled Medfield basketball team to increase their abilities.|$|R

Laboratories in the US, UK, Germany and France soon came {{to the same conclusion}} - that CCA was a highly effective treatment and that the chemicals would ‘fix’ in the timber to give long-lasting protection against decay.|$|R
30|$|From a {{practical}} perspective that considers physics lessons lasting 40 – 45  min, crammed curricula, <b>busy</b> teachers, comprehensive <b>test</b> batteries {{in the context}} of educational studies, and respondent fatigue, efficient testing can be highly relevant. A short instrument that provides one index that validly measures conceptual understanding enables quick and exact testing, which is beneficial for both test takers who do not get tired and annoyed and for teachers or researchers who do not have to spend an excessive amount of time on the assessment, the analysis, and the interpretation of the test.|$|R

40|$|In {{this is an}} era of drastic {{evolution}} Telecommunications, packet {{data communication}} has gained paramount attention due to increased internet multimedia usage. One of the challenges faced by telecom companies is to provide robust and powerful network components that are capable to handle the tremendous load of traffic and data on it. Companies evaluate their products performance before releasing them to the market by applying {{a large amount of}} generated traffic in order to measure their capability under traffic load; powerful solutions are hence needed for generating traffic and modeling various telecom protocols.

40|$|There {{is a lack}} of {{knowledge}} regarding in-vehicle concentrations of nitrogen dioxide (NO) during transit through road tunnels in urban environments. Furthermore, previous studies have tended to involve a single vehicle and the range of in-vehicle NO concentrations that vehicle occupants may be exposed to is not well defined. This study describes simultaneous measurements of in-vehicle and outside-vehicle NO concentrations on a route through Sydney, Australia that included several major tunnels, minor tunnels and <b>busy</b> surface roads. <b>Tests</b> were conducted on nine passenger vehicles to assess how vehicle characteristics and ventilation settings affected in-vehicle NO concentrations and the in-vehicle-to-outside vehicle (I/O) concentration ratio. NO was measured directly using a cavity attenuated phase shift (CAPS) technique that gave a high temporal and spatial resolution. In the major tunnels, transit-average in-vehicle NO concentrations were lower than outside-vehicle concentrations for all vehicles with cabin air recirculation either on or off. However, markedly lower I/O ratios were obtained with recirculation on (0. 08 – 0. 36), suggesting that vehicle occupants can significantly lower their exposure to NO in tunnels by switching recirculation on. The highest mean I/O ratios for NO were measured in older vehicles (0. 35 – 0. 36), which is attributed to older vehicles having higher air exchange rates. The results from this study can be used to inform the design and operation of future road tunnels and modelling of personal exposure to NO...|$|R

France, whose artistic identity is the last thing they wish to chuck--their only dismissal is of all material and social over-draping. Nick Dormer in point of fact asks of Miriam nothing but that she shall remain [...] "awfully interesting to paint"; but that is his relation, which, as I say, is quite a matter by itself. He at any rate, luckily for both of them it may be, doesn't put her to the test: he is so busy with his own case, <b>busy</b> with <b>testing</b> himself and feeling his reality. He has seen himself as giving up precious things for an object, and that object has somehow not been the young woman in question, nor anything very nearly like her. She, on the other hand, has asked everything of Peter Sherringham, who has asked everything of her; and it is in so doing that she has really most testified for art and invited him to testify. With his professed interest in the theatre--one of those deep subjections that, in men of [...] "taste," [...] the Comédie Française used in old days to conspire for and some such odd and affecting examples of which were to be noted--he yet offers her his hand and an introduction to the very best society if she will leave the stage.

40|$|As {{tuberculosis}} {{might be}} a problem in the declining Asian elephant population but too {{little is known about the}} exact prevalence of this disease, researchers in Bangkok, Chiang Mai, Utrecht and Pretoria are currently <b>busy</b> developing blood <b>tests</b> for detecting tuberculosis in elephants. During this research project, I participated in the development of an IFNγ assay by working on the expression of glycosylated IFNγ from insect cells, to be used as a positive control in the development of the IFNγ assay. I also evaluated sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value of indirect (i) ELISA tests employing ESAT 6 /CFP 10, CFP 10 & MBP 83 antigens, and the commercial TB STAT-PAK rapid test. The expression of IFNγ has encountered quite some obstacles, but we succeeded in constructing a pMT/BiP/V 5 -HisA vector carrying an IFNγ gene insertion (as assessed by PCR product size). This plasmid has been transferred into Schneider 2 insect cells (Drosophila melanogaster), using the Drosophila Expression System (DES®, Invitrogen). A stable expression of IFNγ by these cells has not been established yet. The comparison of the different diagnostic tests for detecting TB infection in elephants provided some interesting results. Compared to the 100 % sensitivity and 97 % specificity claimed by the producer of the TB STAT-PAK test, in this project a sensitivity of 80 % and a specificity of 87. 23 % were found. The iELISA test employing the immunodominant antigens ESAT 6 & CFP 10, showed a sensitivity of 75 % and a specificity of 97. 82 %, and a positive predictive value of 88. 24 % opposed to a positive predictive value of 57. 14 % of the TB STAT-PAK test. Negative predictive values of these tests were about the same. This ESAT 6 /CFP 10 iELISA test {{might be a}}n alternative test to the expensive TB STAT-PAK test or trunk wash culture when screening for tuberculosis. However, limitations such as low sample size and –variation, growing body of evidence for a low sensitivity of the trunk wash culture (considered as the gold standard in this experiment), suboptimal negative controls used in the iELISA procedure, and the use of near to expiry STAT-PAK tests, suggest that more research has to be done regarding the use of this ESAT 6 /CFP 10 iELISA test...|$|R
