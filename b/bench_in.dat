5|$|On March 16, 2016, Frazier {{signed a}} 10-day {{contract}} with the New Orleans Pelicans to help the team deal with numerous injuries. New Orleans had to use an NBA hardship exemption in order to sign him as he made their roster stand at 17, two over the allowed limited of 15. He made his debut for the Pelicans later that night, recording 14 points and 9 assists in 27 minutes off the <b>bench</b> <b>in</b> a 123–108 win over the Sacramento Kings. On March 20, he scored a season-high 17 points in a 109–105 win over the Los Angeles Clippers. He topped that mark four days later, scoring 18 points in a loss to the Indiana Pacers. On March 26, he signed with the Pelicans {{for the remainder of}} the season. On April 3, he had career highs with 19 points and 13 assists off the <b>bench</b> <b>in</b> a 106–87 win over the Brooklyn Nets. On April 11, he set a new career high with 20 points, along with 11 assists, in a 121–116 loss to the Chicago Bulls.

5|$|Boyd {{received}} his first call-up {{to the senior}} side in March 2013, when he was named in manager Gordon Strachan's squad for the 2014 FIFA World Cup qualifiers against Wales and Serbia. Although he {{did not make the}} substitutes' <b>bench</b> <b>in</b> Scotland's 2–1 home loss to Wales, he earned his first senior cap just four days later in a 2–0 away defeat to Serbia on 26 March 2013. Boyd started the match, playing the whole match at the Karađorđe Stadium in Novi Sad.|$|E

5|$|James was laird {{until his}} death in 1734, after which the estate passed to his eldest son, also called James, who was born at Pitfour soon after it was purchased. A {{solicitor}} like his father, he was promoted to the <b>bench</b> <b>in</b> 1764 and became Lord Pitfour. He continued to expand and improve the estate {{until his death}} in 1777, and set up the planned village of Fetterangus in 1752.|$|E
5|$|The 2011–12 season saw Totti {{initially}} receive few starts under Roma's {{new manager}} Luis Enrique, as the club's early struggles continued. Totti sustained an injury on 1 October 2011 {{in the second}} half of a match against Atalanta, which kept him out of action until the 20 November; he returned to the pitch against Lecce, when he came off the <b>bench</b> <b>in</b> the 66th minute, as Roma won the match 2–1.|$|E

5|$|The {{result was}} the Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1873, which unified the Common Pleas, Exchequer, King's Bench and Court of Chancery into one body, the High Court of Justice, with the {{divisions}} between the courts to remain. Thus, while the reform epitomised by the Bill of Middlesex aided the King's <b>Bench</b> <b>in</b> the short term, it eventually led to its dissolution.|$|E
5|$|When {{designing}} the exterior, Pei {{borrowed from the}} tradition of Japanese temples, particularly those found in nearby Kyoto. He created a concise spaceframe wrapped into French limestone {{and covered with a}} glass roof. Pei also oversaw specific decorative details, including a <b>bench</b> <b>in</b> the entrance lobby, carved from a 350-year-old keyaki tree. Because of Koyama's considerable wealth, money was rarely considered an obstacle; estimates at the time of completion put the cost of the project at US$350million.|$|E

5|$|After four largely injury-free seasons, {{the muscular}} {{injuries}} {{that had previously}} plagued Messi reoccurred. After he suffered a hamstring strain on 2 April, during the first quarter-final against Paris Saint-Germain, his appearances became sporadic. In the second leg against PSG, with an underperforming Barcelona down a goal, Messi came off the <b>bench</b> <b>in</b> the second half and within nine minutes helped create their game-tying goal, which allowed them to progress to the semi-finals. Still unfit, he proved ineffective during the first leg against Bayern Munich {{and was unable to}} play at all during the second, as Barcelona were defeated 7–0 on aggregate by the eventual champions. These matches gave credence to the notion of Messidependencia, Barcelona's perceived tactical and psychological dependence on their star player.|$|E
5|$|As a judge, Hale {{was noted}} for his {{resistance}} to bribery and {{his willingness to}} make politically unpopular decisions which upheld the law. He sat in Parliament, either in the Commons or the Upper House, in every Parliament from the First Protectorate Parliament to the Convention Parliament, and following the Declaration of Breda was the Member of Parliament who moved to consider Charles II's reinstatement as monarch, sparking the English Restoration. Under Charles, Hale was made first Chief Baron of the Exchequer and then Chief Justice of the King's <b>Bench.</b> <b>In</b> both positions, he was again noted for his integrity, although not as a particularly innovative judge. Following a bout of illness he retired on 20 February 1676, dying ten months later on 25 December 1676.|$|E
5|$|Because he {{reported}} late, Berg {{spent the first}} three months of the season on the <b>bench.</b> <b>In</b> August, a series of injuries to catchers Ray Schalk, Harry McCurdy and Buck Crouse left the White Sox in need of somebody to play the position. Schalk, the White Sox player/manager, selected Berg, who did a fine job filling in. Schalk arranged for former Philadelphia Phillies catcher Frank Bruggy to meet the team at their next game, against the New York Yankees. Bruggy was so fat that pitcher Ted Lyons refused to pitch to him. When Schalk asked him whom he wanted to catch, Lyons selected Berg.|$|E

5|$|Benn met Caroline Middleton DeCamp (born 13 October 1926, Cincinnati, Ohio, United States) over tea at Worcester College, Oxford, in 1949 {{and just}} nine days after meeting her; he {{proposed}} to her on a park <b>bench</b> <b>in</b> the city. Later, he bought the bench from Oxford City Council and installed it {{in the garden of}} their home in Holland Park. Tony and Caroline had four children – Stephen, Hilary, Melissa, a feminist writer, and Joshua – and ten grandchildren. Caroline Benn died of cancer on 22 November 2000, aged 74, after a career as an educationalist.|$|E
5|$|Due to Mourinho preferring Ronaldo and Higuaín as his forwards, Benzema {{began the}} {{campaign}} {{as a substitute}} coming off the <b>bench</b> <b>in</b> the team's opening league match of the season against Mallorca. Following the September international break, {{he made his first}} start in a 1–0 win over Osasuna. On 21 September, Benzema made a substitute appearance and scored his first goal of the season in a 3–0 home win against Espanyol. Afterwards, the striker failed to score a domestic goal for nearly two months. The striker did assist on goals in back-to-back weeks against Hércules in the league and Milan in the Champions League.|$|E
5|$|He {{made his}} debut at The Hawthorns as a {{substitute}} in a 2–1 win over Tranmere Rovers on 9 August 1997.

Smith handed Hughes his first start on 28 December, in a 1–1 home draw with Stoke City. He finished his debut season as the club's top-scorer with 14 goals in 41 appearances, and was rewarded with a new four-year contract.|$|E
