[...] However, rather than present {{the use of}} the {{delicate}} artist paint brush, Lichtenstein created the strokes of the broad house-painter's brush.

5000|$|I notice, {{in some of}} your sample programs, {{that you}} are not underlining or stropping anything.-- Mailloux [...] In ALGOL family {{languages}} it is necessary to distinguish between identifiers and <b>basic</b> <b>symbols</b> of the language.

50|$|A categorial grammar {{consists}} of two parts: a lexicon, which assigns a set of types (also called categories) to each <b>basic</b> <b>symbol,</b> and some type inference rules, which determine how the type {{of a string of}} symbols follows from the types of the constituent symbols. It has the advantage that the type inference rules can be fixed once and for all, so that the specification of a particular language grammar is entirely determined by the lexicon.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Telugu {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} and popular {{languages}} of India spoken by more than 66 million people especially in South India. Development of Optical Character Recognition systems for Telugu text is an area of current research. OCR of Indian scripts is much more complicated than the OCR of Roman script because of the use of huge number of combinations of characters and modifiers. <b>Basic</b> <b>Symbols</b> are identified as the unit of recognition in Telugu script. Edge Histograms are used for a feature based recognition scheme for these <b>basic</b> <b>symbols.</b> During recognition, it is observed that, in many cases, the recognizer incorrectly outputs a very similar looking symbol. Special logic and algorithms are developed using simple structural features for improving recognition accuracies considerably without too much additional computational effort. It is shown that recognition accuracies of 98. 5 % can be achieved on laser quality prints with such a procedure. ...|$|R

His work is far, broad, deep, and difficult {{because he has}} pursued the echo of cosmic perception from his early days.

He has employed his artistic indication from attitude, which conveys the representative symbol of quickening perfection from vibration of Biui, which has conceived from the ancient times.

50|$|The Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Examination (BDAE-3) {{provides}} a comprehensive exploration {{of a range}} of communicative abilities. The results of the BDAE are used to classify patient's language profiles into one of the localization based classifications of aphasia: Broca's, Wernicke's, anomic, conduction, transcortical, transcortical motor, transcortical sensory, and global aphasia syndromes, although the test does not always provide a diagnosis or a therapeutic approach. The assessment does provide you with a severity rating. The Examination is designed to go beyond simple functional definitions of aphasia into the components of language dysfunctions (symptoms) that have been shown to underlie the various aphasic syndromes. Thus, this test evaluates various perceptual modalities (e.g., auditory, visual, and gestural), processing functions (e.g., comprehension, analysis, problem-solving), and response modalities (e.g., writing, articulation, and manipulation). This approach allows for the neuropsychological analysis and measurement of language-related skills and abilities from both ideographic and nomothetic bases, as well as a comprehensive approach to the symptom configurations that relate to neuropathologic conditions. The test is divided into five subtests and include assessment of conversation and expository speech (simple social responses, free conversation, and picture description), auditory comprehension (at the word-level, sentence level, and complex ideational material), oral expression (automatized sequences, repetition, and naming) , reading (<b>basic</b> <b>symbol</b> recognition, number matching, word identification-picture-word matching, oral reading, and reading comprehension), and writing (mechanics, encoding skills, written picture naming, and narrative writing).|$|E
