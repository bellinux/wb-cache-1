5|$|Founded in 1891, the Society for the {{improvement}} of New Forest Ponies organised a stallion show and offered financial incentives to encourage owners of good stallions to run them on the Forest. In 1905 the Burley and District NF Pony <b>Breeding</b> <b>and</b> Cattle Society was set up to start the stud book and organise the Breed Show; the two societies merged in 1937 to form the New Forest Pony <b>Breeding</b> <b>and</b> Cattle Society. Overall numbers of livestock grazing the Forest, including ponies, tended to decline in the early twentieth century; in 1945 there were just 571 ponies depastured. By 1956 the number of ponies of all breeds on the Forest had more than doubled to 1,341. Twenty years later pony numbers were up to 3,589, rising to 4,112 in 1994, before dipping back below four thousand until 2005. As of 2011, there were 4,604 ponies grazing on the New Forest.|$|E
5|$|Horse {{racing and}} {{greyhound}} racing are both popular in Ireland. There are frequent horse race meetings and greyhound stadiums are well-attended.

The horse racing sector is largely concentrated in the County Kildare.|$|E

5|$|Most terns breed on open sandy or rocky {{areas on}} coasts and islands. The yellow-billed, large-billed, and black-fronted terns breed only on rivers, and common, least and little terns also {{sometimes}} use inland locations. The marsh terns, Trudeau's tern and some Forster's terns nest in inland marshes. The black noddy {{and the white}} tern nest above ground level on cliffs or in trees. Migratory terns move to the coast after <b>breeding,</b> <b>and</b> most species winter near land, although some marine species, like the Aleutian tern, may wander far from land. The sooty tern is entirely oceanic when not <b>breeding,</b> <b>and</b> healthy young birds are not seen on land {{for up to five}} years after fledging until they return to breed. They lack waterproof plumage, so they cannot rest on the sea. Where they spend the years prior to breeding is unknown.|$|E
5|$|Other {{significant}} areas include stop-over sites {{between the}} wintering and breeding territories. A capture-recapture study of passerine migrants with high fidelity for <b>breeding</b> <b>and</b> wintering sites {{did not show}} similar strict association with stop-over sites.|$|E

5|$|A pond {{is a body}} of {{standing}} water, either natural or man-made, that is usually smaller than a lake. A wide variety of man-made bodies of water are classified as ponds, including water gardens designed for aesthetic ornamentation, fish ponds designed for commercial fish <b>breeding,</b> <b>and</b> solar ponds designed to store thermal energy. Ponds and lakes are distinguished from streams via current speed. While currents in streams are easily observed, ponds and lakes possess thermally driven micro-currents and moderate wind driven currents. These features distinguish a pond from many other aquatic terrain features, such as stream pools and tide pools.|$|E
5|$|After several revisions, the {{studbook}} {{was closed}} in 1922 after registering 424 foundation horses. The {{closing of the}} studbook brought about additional purebred <b>breeding</b> <b>and</b> selection based on conformation, color and working ability. In 1923, an association of Poitevin breeders was founded, but declining livestock production pushed the group to reorganize in 1937 {{in order to gain}} more support from the government, through bonuses and subsidies.|$|E
5|$|As {{with most}} small birds, {{mortality}} {{in the first}} year of life is high, but adults aged three to four years are regularly recorded, and the record is more than seven years. Eggs, chicks and fledglings of this ground-nesting species are taken by stoats, weasels and crows such as the European magpie, and the adults are hunted by birds of prey, particularly the sparrowhawk. Small birds are also at the mercy of the weather, particularly when migrating, but also on the <b>breeding</b> <b>and</b> wintering grounds.|$|E

25|$|A {{cross between}} a {{shedding}} breed and a poodle (which does not shed much) does not reliably produce a nonshedding dog. Traits of puppies from crossbreedings are not as predictable as those from purebred poodle <b>breedings,</b> <b>and</b> the crosses may shed or have unexpected or undesirable qualities from the parent breeds.|$|R
50|$|Conservation {{programs}} are protecting populations <b>and</b> <b>breeding</b> grounds, <b>and</b> also establishing additional populations to reduce risk of extinction. The state of Hawaii and the US Fish and Wildlife Service have protected 23% of the state's coastal wetlands.|$|R
5|$|Bird {{migration}} is the regular seasonal movement, often {{north and south}} along a flyway, between <b>breeding</b> <b>and</b> wintering grounds. Many species of bird migrate. Migration carries high costs in predation and mortality, including from hunting by humans, and is driven primarily by availability of food. It occurs mainly in the northern hemisphere, where birds are funnelled on to specific routes by natural barriers such as the Mediterranean Sea or the Caribbean Sea.|$|E
5|$|Both {{species are}} nocturnal migrants. Most corn crakes migrate through Egypt, with smaller numbers {{crossing}} {{at the western}} end of the Mediterranean. It has been recorded in most countries between its <b>breeding</b> <b>and</b> wintering ranges, including much of west Africa, and those parts of southern Asia that lie between the east of the breeding range and Africa. Further afield, it has been recorded as a vagrant to Sri Lanka, Vietnam and Australia, the Seychelles, Bermuda, Canada, the United States, Greenland, and the North Atlantic islands.|$|E
5|$|During {{the decline}} of the Roman Empire and the Early Middle Ages, much of the quality {{breeding}} stock developed during the classical period was lost due to uncontrolled <b>breeding</b> <b>and</b> had to be built up again over the following centuries.
