5000|$|All {{space suit}} designs try to {{minimize}} or eliminate this problem. The most common {{solution is to}} form the suit out of multiple layers. The <b>bladder</b> <b>layer</b> is a rubbery, airtight layer much like a balloon. The restraint layer goes outside the bladder, and provides a specific shape for the suit. Since the <b>bladder</b> <b>layer</b> {{is larger than the}} restraint layer, the restraint takes all of the stresses caused by the pressure inside the suit. Since the bladder is not under pressure, it will not [...] "pop" [...] like a balloon, even if punctured. The restraint layer is shaped {{in such a way that}} bending a joint causes pockets of fabric, called [...] "gores," [...] to open up on the outside of the joint, while folds called [...] "convolutes" [...] fold up on the inside of the joint. The gores make up for the volume lost on the inside of the joint, and keep the suit at a nearly constant volume. However, once the gores are opened all the way, the joint cannot be bent any further without a considerable amount of work.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The work {{presented}} in this paper details the development of a finite element (FE) model of a soccer ball, allowing for a greater understanding of the performance of soccer balls under dynamic conditions that are representative of play. The model consists of composite shell elements that include a hyperelastic strain energy potential equation to define the latex <b>bladder</b> <b>layer</b> and a plane stress orthotropic elastic material model to define the anisotropic woven fabric outer panels. The model was validated through a series of experimental tests whereby the ball was impacted normal to a rigid plate at an inbound velocity of approximately 34 ms- 1 (76 mph), with each impact recorded using high speed video (HSV) techniques. It was found that the combined effects of ball design and panel material anisotropy caused impact properties such as impact contact time, deformation, and the 2 D shape taken up by the ball at maximum deformation, to vary with pre-impact ball orientation. The model showed good agreement with the experimental measurements and was able to represent the effects of anisotropy in ball design...|$|E
40|$|The {{interaction}} of magnetic fields generated by large superconducting coils has multiple applications in space, including actuation of spacecraft or spacecraft components, wireless power transfer, and shielding of spacecraft from radiation and high energy particles. These applications require coils with major diameters {{as large as}} 20 meters and a thermal management system to maintain the superconducting material of the coil below its critical temperature. Since a rigid thermal management system, such as a heat pipe, is unsuitable for compact stowage inside a 5 meter payload fairing, a thin-walled thermal enclosure is proposed. A 1. 85 meter diameter test article consisting of a <b>bladder</b> <b>layer</b> for containing chilled nitrogen vapor, a restraint layer, and multilayer insulation was tested in a custom toroidal vacuum chamber. The material properties found during laboratory testing are used to predict {{the performance of the}} test article in low Earth orbit. Deployment motion of the same test article was measured using a motion capture system and the results are used to predict the deployment in space. A 20 meter major diameter and coil current of 6. 7 MA is selected as a point design case. This design point represents a single coil in a high energy particle shielding system. Sizing of the thermal and structural components of the enclosure is completed. The thermal and deployment performance is predicted...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: We {{examined}} {{the role of}} annexins in bladder urothelium. We characterized expression and distribution in normal bladders, biopsies from patients with bladder pain syndrome, cultured human urothelium and urothelial TEU- 2 cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Annexin expression in <b>bladder</b> <b>layers</b> was analyzed by quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and immunofluorescence. We assessed cell survival after exposure to the pore forming bacterial toxin streptolysin O by microscopy and alamarBlue® assay. Bladder dome biopsies were obtained from 8 asymptomatic controls and 28 patients with symptoms of bladder pain syndrome. RESULTS: Annexin A 1, A 2, A 5 and A 6 were differentially distributed in <b>bladder</b> <b>layers.</b> Annexin A 6 was abundant in detrusor smooth muscle and low in urothelium, while annexin A 1 was the highest in urothelium. Annexin A 2 was localized to the lateral membrane of umbrella cells but excluded from tight junctions. TEU- 2 cell differentiation caused up-regulation of annexin A 1 and A 2 and down-regulation of annexin A 6 mRNA. Mature urothelium dedifferentiation during culture caused the opposite effect, decreasing annexin A 1 and increasing annexin A 6. Annexin A 2 influenced TEU- 2 cell epithelial permeability. siRNA mediated knockdown of annexin A 1 in TEU- 2 cells caused significantly decreased cell survival after streptolysin O exposure. Annexin A 1 was significantly reduced in biopsies from patients with bladder pain syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: Several annexins are expressed in human bladder and TEU- 2 cells, in which levels are regulated during urothelial differentiation. Annexin A 1 down-regulation in patients with bladder pain syndrome might decrease cell survival and contribute to compromised urothelial function...|$|R
40|$|AbstractFluid–fluid levels {{occur on}} {{computed}} tomography due {{to differences in}} density between the 2 fluids. For example, intravenous (IV) contrast excreted into the urinary <b>bladder</b> <b>layers</b> posterior with gravity in the supine patient with normal, unopacified urine layering anterior, due to their differing densities. The rare presence of inverted fluid-contrast levels in the bladder calls attention to the existence of pathology such as microscopic hematuria, infectious debris, glycosuria, and purulent fluid. In such instances, the hypodense, nonopacified urine is the abnormality and is often only recognized due to the excreted IV contrast “floating” on top of it within the bladder. Here, we describe a case in which the development of inverted fluid-contrast levels in the urinary bladder on computed tomography during a patient’s hospital stay heralded further investigation with urinalysis and urinary culture, with the known, worrisome causes able to be excluded...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{objective}} of this work was to study {{the reduction in the}} capsaicin toxicity by encapsulation in liposomes. Capsaicin was extracted from peppers and characterized with high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). We determined the zeta potential, polydispersivity index (PdI) and vesicle size of liposomes. Wistar rats were submitted to intravesical instillation of liposomes (LIP), capsaicin (CAP) or liposomes with capsaicin (CAPLIP). After 24 hours, bladders were removed for histological analysis. Vesicle size ranged from 68 to 105 nm with PdI smaller than 0. 2 and zeta potential around - 30 mV. The vesicles maintained stability over the 14 -day study. The histological analysis of the CAP group showed intense inflammation in almost all <b>bladder</b> <b>layers,</b> as well as ulcer formation. Conversely, the CAPLIP group showed a smooth inflammatory reaction and hyperemia. In conclusion, the liposomes effectively protected the bladder against the irritative action of capsaicin...|$|R

No {{comparisons}} are available {{of the effects of}} these drugs on prevention of renal and bladder changes in partial urethral obstruction (PUO). Materials and Methods: The rats were divided into six groups (n= 7). The sham-operated rats (group I) only underwent laparotomy and did not receive any treatments. The PUO groups (group II–VI) received normal saline (PUO+NS), pentoxifylline (100 mg/kg/d; PUO+PEN), captopril (35 mg/kg/d; PUO+CAP), simvastatin (15 mg/kg/d; PUO+SIM), or tamoxifen (10 mg/kg/d; PUO+TAM) by gavage for 28 days. Then, the volume and/or length of the kidney components (tubules, vessels, and fibrous tissue) and the bladder components (epithelial and muscular layers, fibrous tissue, fibroblast and fibrocyte number) were quantitatively evaluated on the microscopic sections by use of stereo-logical techniques. Results: The volume of renal and bladder fibrosis was significantly ameliorated in the PUO+PEN group, followed by the PUO+CAP, PUO+SIM, and PUO+TAM groups.

40|$|Characterising the {{integrative}} {{physiology of}} the bladder requires whole organ preparations. The {{purpose of this}} study was to validate an isolated large animal (pig) bladder preparation, through arterial and intravesical drug administration, intravesical pressure recording and filming of surface micromotions. Female pig bladders were obtained from the local abattoir and arterially perfused in vitro. Arterial and intravesical pressures were recorded at varying volumes. Bladder viability was assessed histologically and by monitoring inflow and outflow pH. Arterial drug administration employed boluses introduced into the perfusate. Intravesical administration involved slow instillation and a prolonged dwell-time. Surface micromotions were recorded by filming the separation of surface markers concurrently with intravesical pressure measurement. Adequate perfusion to all <b>bladder</b> <b>layers</b> was achieved for up to eight hours; there was no structural deterioration nor alteration in inflow and effluent perfusate pH. Arterial drug administration (carbachol and potassium chloride) showed consistent dose-dependent responses. Localised movements (micromotions) occurred over the bladder surface, with variable correlation with fluctuations of intravesical pressure. The isolated pig bladder is a valid approach to study integrative bladder physiology. It remains viable when perfused in vitro, responds to different routes of drug administration and provides a model to correlate movements of the bladder wall directly to variation of intravesical pressure...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: In this {{preclinical}} study, {{we examined}} the biodistribution of hypericin formulated as its water-soluble PVP-hypericin complex in the different layers (urothelium, submucosa, muscle) of a normal rat bladder and a rat bladder bearing a malignant urothelium composed of syngeneic AY- 27 tumor cells. The results were compared with the biodistribution of hexaminolevulinate (HAL) -induced protoporphyrin IX (PpIX). METHODS: Freshly prepared PVP-hypericin and HAL solutions were instilled in both normal as well as tumor-bearing rat bladders. Following instillation, bladders were removed and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. Fluorescence of PVP-hypericin or PpIX-induced HAL was measured in the <b>bladder</b> <b>layers</b> and quantified using image analysis software. RESULTS: The results of these experiments show that PVP-hypericin (30 μM) accumulated about 3. 5 -fold more in malignant urothelial tissue when compared to normal urothelium, whereas PpIX accumulated {{to the same extent}} in malignant and normal urothelium, both after intrabladder instillation of 8 or 16 mM HAL. Besides, PVP-hypericin and PpIX accumulated selectively in the urothelium with a tumor-to-muscle ratio of 30. 6 for PVP-hypericin and 3. 7 - 8. 3 for 16 and 8 mM HAL, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that PVP-hypericin appears to have great potential as a photodynamic agent against non-muscle-invasive bladder cancers after intravesical administration, with a limited risk of affecting the deeper <b>layers</b> of the <b>bladder.</b> status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Purpose: To {{evaluate}} continence after radical prostatectomy in {{prostate cancer}} patients, in whom a new method of the bladder neck reconstruction (BNR) using deep dorsal stitch was implemented (deep single stitch through all <b>bladder</b> <b>layers</b> directly dorsal to the bladder opening after “tennis racket” reconstruction) {{and to provide}} justification for its use by means of anatomical study in cadavers. Material and Methods: Open radical retropubic prostatectomy was performed in 84 patients: 39 patients with a new BNR method used to improve continence and control group of 45 patients with standard “tennis racket” BNR. Median follow-up was 14 months in control group and 12 months in study group. Continence recovery was accessed early postoperatively and every 3 months thereafter. Anatomical study was performed on 2 male fresh cadavers reproducing two different BNR techniques to clarify any underlying continence related mechanisms. Results: Patients with new BNR achieved full continence significantly faster (p= 0. 041), but the continence rates after 12 months were similar between groups. The severity of incontinence up to month 9 was significantly reduced in BNR group. The anastomotic stricture rate was not affected. Applying new BNR to the cadaver model revealed effects on early continence, namely presence of proximal passive closure mechanism in area of bladder neck. Conclusions: Continence in patients with the new BNR method using deep dorsal stitch recovered significantly faster. Moreover, a reduced grade of residual incontinence was documented. The effect was non-significant at month 12 of follow-up, meaning that only early effect was present. </sec...|$|R
40|$|We have {{previously}} investigated {{the possibility of}} using hypericin as a diagnostic tool for the fluorescence detection of flat bladder carcinoma. In these clinical studies, it was shown that following intravesical application in humans, hypericin becomes selectively localized in transitional papillary carcinoma and carcinoma in situ (CIS). In the present study, we characterized the biodistribution of hypericin in rat bladder tumor and normal <b>bladder</b> <b>layers</b> after intravesical administration. The biodistribution was evaluated using fluorescence microscopy with computerized image analysis to image and quantify the fluorescence of hypericin across the urothelial tumor and normal bladder wall. The results show that the photosensitizer intravesical administration route provides selective labelling of both the tumor and normal urothelium. A hypericin dose and instillation time-dependent increase in the hypericin fluorescence intensity in both the tumor and urothelium was observed, without significant hypericin fluorescence in the submucosa and muscle layers. The highest fluorescence ratios in hypericin accumulation in the tumor and normal urothelium to the muscle layer were achieved at 4 h with 30 micro M hypericin (20 : 1 for the urothelium to muscle layer and 30 : 1 for the tumor to muscle layer). The difference in fluorescence intensity in tumor tissue to the muscle layer following instillation of 8 micro M hypericin was 11 : 1, 25 : 1 and 28 : 1 at 1, 2 and 4 h, respectively. The difference in fluorescence intensity in tumor tissue to the muscle layer using 30 micro M hypericin was 17 : 1, 27 : 1 and 31 : 1 at 1, 2 and 4 h, respectively. The highest absolute fluorescence levels were observed in the tumor at 4 h with 30 micro M hypericin instillation. The results suggest that under these conditions, PDT with hypericin is likely to produce uniform urothelial tumor eradication, without causing damage to the underlying muscle layers. status: publishe...|$|R

Samples of the urothelium, lamina propria, muscularis, and serosa were prepared from the pigćs urinary bladder body, while samples used for regional mapping of the urothelium were prepared from trigone, ventral and dorsal middle bladder body, and apex region. Activities of superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, and catalase were determined. Concentrations of ascorbic acid and glutathione were also measured. Antioxidant activities, i. e. concentrations of superoxide dismutase,glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase and glutathione, were shown to be highest in the urothelium and progressively lower towards the serosa. Regional mapping of the urothelium singled out apex as the region withthe lowest antioxidant activities, i. e. concentrations of glutathione peroxidase, ascorbic acid, and glutathione. The fact that antioxidants are concentrated in the urothelium implies that urothelium functions as a barrier against reactive species.

The analysis was made {{with the use of}} the method of optical coherent tomography (ОСТ). Dynamic ОСТ was performed in 23 patients after antibacterial treat (after 2 weeks) and in the period of remission. It was 59 ОСТ examinations. After antibacterial treatment the pathologically unchanged mucosa was found in the form of thickening in interu-retericfold in Lieutands triangle, in the neck of urinary <b>bladder.</b> Sub mucosal <b>layer</b> was also think, the structure of fibers was destroyed. Both leucocytic and lymphocytic infiltration in the wall of the bladder was observed. The tissue which reflected the light signal was found in muscle structure in the period of remission. This correspond to fibrosis in the wall of the bladder. In the long process the atrophy of mucosa was found. Thus, pathogenetic therapy should proceed after decrease in expressiveness of clinical displays of diseas...|$|R
40|$|Introduction and {{hypothesis}} We assessed whether urinary excretion of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) may {{be affected}} by a condition of detrusor overactivity (DO). Materials and methods We evaluated 24 -h urinary excretion of GAGs in 25 patients (mean age 63. 81 years) with DO and in 14 healthy controls (mean age 65. 75 years). No patients or controls had urinary tract infection. The excretion of GAGs was measured {{on the basis of}} total urine volume and normalized to creatinine concentration. Student's test was employed to check between the urinary excretion of GAGs in the two groups. Results The urinary content of GAGs discovered in control group was significantly higher than that in pathological group for the ratio GAGs/creatinine concentration. Conclusions The low content of GAGs might be due to relative ischemia of the <b>bladder</b> wall epithelial <b>layer</b> following a chronically increased contractile activity of the detrusor even if further studies are needed to confirm this finding...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{investigate}} histological {{features and}} biocompatibility of a latex biomembrane for bladder augmentation using a rabbit model. MATERIAL AND METHODS: After a partial cystectomy, {{a patch of}} a non-vulcanized latex biomembrane (2 x 4 cm) was sewn to the bladder with 5 / 0 monofilament polydioxanone sulfate in a watertight manner. Groups of 5 animals were sacrificed at 15, 45 and 90 days after surgery and the bladder was removed. The 5 -µm preparations obtained from grafted area and normal bladder were stained with hematoxylin-eosin. Immunohistochemical staining was performed with a primary antibody against alpha-actin to assess muscle regeneration. RESULTS: No death, urinary leakage or graft extrusion occurred in any group. All bladders showed a spherical shape. Macroscopically, after 90 days, the latex biomembrane was not identifiable and the patch was indistinguishable from normal bladder. A bladder stone was found in one animal (6. 6 %). On the 90 th day, histology revealed continuity of transitional epithelium of host bladder tissue on the patch area. At this time, the muscle layers were well organized {{in a similar fashion}} to native <b>bladder</b> muscle <b>layers.</b> The inflammatory process was higher on grafted areas when compared to controls: 15 days - p < 0. 0001, 45 days - p < 0. 001, and 90 days - p < 0. 01. The anti alpha-actin immunoexpression peaked at 45 days, when the graft was observed covered by muscle cells. CONCLUSION: The latex biomembrane is biocompatible and can be used in models for bladder augmentation in rabbits. It promotes epithelium and muscle regeneration without urinary leakage...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: This {{literature}} review presents information relevant to medical radiation technologists {{with respect to}} new knowledge on {{the function of the}} urinary bladder. These new insights are also explored in relation to radiation-induced histopathological effects and the symptoms of bladder dysfunction reported after external beam radiotherapy. Methods and Materials: The peer-reviewed scientific literature was examined using various electronic medical search engines with appropriate keywords and MeSH headings. Inclusion criteria comprised English language articles published between 1999 and January 2010, with full manuscript available. A critical review was then performed, synthesizing the information contained in those multiple sources into the following subject categories: normal urinary bladder function (basic review and new knowledge), and effect of fractionated radiotherapy on normal bladder (histopathological changes and symptoms of dysfunction). Findings: Previously considered an inert vessel for urine storage, the urinary bladder is actually a complex system of morphologically different tissues, which play an interconnected role in its physiological functions. Injury or abnormal repair in any of the <b>bladder</b> cell <b>layers</b> results in a multifaceted display of interrelated manifestations of dysfunction. In this complex environment, not only can a single symptom of dysfunction have multiple histopathological causes, but the presence of one symptom may exacerbate the presentation of another. To date, this new knowledge has had little impact on radiotherapy clinical practice because subjective methods of collecting toxicity data prevent the identification of a link between radiotherapy dose and urinary dysfunction. The new understanding of the histopathological cause of radiation-induced symptoms, however, has led to the preclinical investigation of many promising methods to prevent or reduce radiotherapy toxicity. 9 page(s...|$|R

40|$|More than 430, 000 {{new cases}} of bladder cancer are {{diagnosed}} {{every year in the}} world, and approximately 70 – 80 % of patients present with non-invasive disease. To improve the effectiveness of early detection of bladder cancer, high sensitivity diagnostic tools should be used. In our study we used flow cytometry to determine surface markers in urinary sediment cells of patients with bladder cancer. The analysis of the phenotypic features of urinary sediment cells showed an increase in the relative content of CD 13 + cells in patients with non-invasive bladder cancer in comparison with the control group. In addition, there was a 4. 8 -fold increase in cells expressing CD 15 surface antigen (p< 0. 001) and 4. 9 -fold increase in cells expressing CD 45 surface antigen (p< 0. 001). Considering the fact, that most patients with bladder cancer develop recurrence after treatment, we studied the relationship between the expression level of surface markers of urinary sediment cells and the development of disease recurrence. The absence of differences in the level of CD 15 + cells in urinary sediment of patients with recurrent bladder cancer {{can be explained by the}} absence of differences in proliferative activity of recurrent and non-recurrent tumors. The higher level of CD 13 + cells in patients with recurrent bladder cancer indicates greater depth of tumor invasion. It is obvious that the deeper the tumor invasion into the submucosal <b>layer</b> of the <b>bladder,</b> the greater the likelihood of non-radical transurethral resection and the development of disease recurrence. Thus, the analysis of the level of CD 13 + and CD 45 + cells in the urinary sediment can provide information on tumor invasion into the <b>bladder</b> submucosal <b>layer</b> and the risk of bladder cancer recurrence. </p...|$|R
