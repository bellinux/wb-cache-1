40|$|Downhole {{abnormal}} incidents during {{oil and gas}} drilling cause costly delays, and {{may also}} potentially lead to dangerous scenarios. Different incidents will cause changes to {{different parts of the}} physics of the process. Estimating the changes in physical parameters, and correlating these with changes expected from various defects, can be used to diagnose faults while in development. This paper shows how estimated friction parameters and flow rates can be used to detect and isolate the type of incident, as well as isolating the position of a defect. Estimates are shown to be subjected to non-Gaussian, $t$-distributed noise, and a dedicated multivariate statistical change detection approach is used that detects and isolates faults by detecting simultaneous changes in estimated parameters and flow rates. The properties of the multivariate diagnosis method are analyzed, and it is shown how detection and false alarm probabilities are assessed and optimized using data-based learning to obtain thresholds for hypothesis testing. Data from a 1400 m horizontal flow loop is used to test the method, and successful diagnosis of the incidents drillstring washout (pipe leakage), lost circulation, gas influx, and drill <b>bit</b> <b>nozzle</b> plugging are demonstrated...|$|E
40|$|At present, the aeration-assisted cutting-carrying {{technology}} {{is faced with}} complexities in the drilling of CBM multi-branch horizontal wells. For example, the aerating pressure is hardly maintained, and the borehole instability may happen. In view of these prominent problems, the technology of double casing tubes & a binary cycle system suitable for CBM multi-branch horizontal wells was developed according to the Venturi principle by means of parasitic tube insufflation which is used for well control simulation system. Then, a multiphase flow finite element model was established for the fluid-cutting particle system in this drilling condition. This technology was tested in field. Double-casing tubes cementing is adopted in this technology and a jet generator is installed {{at the bottom of}} the inner casing. In the process of drilling, the drilling fluid injected through double intermediate casing annulus is converted by the jet generator into a high-efficiency steering water jet, which, together with the water jet generated by the <b>bit</b> <b>nozzle,</b> increases the fluid returning rate in the inner annulus space. It is indicated from simulation results that the cutting-carrying effect is the best when the included angle between the nozzle of the jet generator and the vertical direction is 30 °. Besides, the influential laws of cutting size, primary cycle volume, accessory cycle volume and drilling velocity on hole cleaning are figured out. It is concluded that this technology increases the flow rate of drilling fluid in annulus space, the returning rate of drilling fluid significantly and the cutting-carrying capacity. It is currently one of the effective hole cleaning technologies for CBM multi-branch horizontal wells where fresh water is taken as the drilling fluid...|$|E

50|$|Drilling mud {{is usually}} a shear {{thinning}} non-Newtonian fluid of variable viscosity. When it is under more shear, {{such as in the}} pipe to the bit and through the <b>bit</b> <b>nozzles,</b> viscosity is lower which reduces pumping-power requirements. When returning to the surface through the much roomier annulus it is under less shear stress and becomes more viscous, and hence better able to carry the rock cuttings. Bentonite is commonly used as an additive to control and maintain viscosity, and also has the additional benefit of forming a mud-cake (also known as a filter cake) on the bore-hole wall, preventing fluid invasion.|$|R

3000|$|The {{schematic}} {{diagram of the}} laboratory scale (scaled-down) drilling simulator is shown in Fig.  1 a. The rig is powered by an electric drill motor with two rotational speed configurations (300 and 600  rpm) to provide adequate rotary speed and torque to the bit via the drillstring. The loading system consists of a rack-pinion arrangement through which a suspended weight, {{in addition to a}} constant weight, {{can be applied to the}} bit. The rotary head accounts for the constant weight on bit (WOB) and consists of the drill motor and the drillstring. The drillstring components include a cradle, a swivel, a compliant tool, and a drill pipe. The swivel allows the injection of fluid into the drill pipe down to the drill <b>bit</b> <b>nozzles</b> and the complaint tool, which is configured rigidly for the current experiment, provides a relative motion between the top system and the drill pipe using a set of coned-disc springs and rubber-damping elements. The drill pipe connects the drill bit with the top system (i.e. swivel, motor, etc.) [...]...|$|R
40|$|Lost {{circulation}} is {{a problem}} common in both the geothermal and the solution mining industries. In both cases, drilling is on a relatively large scale (geothermal holes can be as large as 26 inches). Lost circulation technology development for geothermal drilling has been in progress at Sandia National Laboratories for more than 15 years. The initial work centered on lost circulation materials, but testing and modeling indicated that if the aperture of a loss zone is very large (larger than the drill <b>bit</b> <b>nozzles)</b> it cannot be plugged by simply adding materials to the drilling fluid. Thus, the lost circulation work evolved to include: (1) Development of metering techniques that accurately measure and characterize drilling fluid inflow and outflow for rapid diagnosis of los circulation and/or fluid balance while drilling. (2) Construction of a laboratory facility for testing drillable straddle packers (to improve the plugging efficiency of cementing operations) and the actual testing of components of the straddle packer. (3) Construction of a laboratory facility for the testing of candidate porous fabrics {{as a part of}} a program to develop a porous packer that places polyurethane foam into a loss zone.

30|$|A multi-objective {{optimization}} of {{oil well}} drilling {{has been carried}} out using a binary coded elitist non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm. A Louisiana offshore field with abnormal formation pressure is considered for optimization. Several multi-objective optimization problems involving two-and three-objective functions were formulated and solved to fix optimal drilling variables. The important objectives are: (i) maximizing drilling depth, (ii) minimizing drilling time and (iii) minimizing drilling cost with fractional drill bit tooth wear as a constraint. Important time dependent decision variables are: (i) equivalent circulation mud density, (ii) drill bit rotation, (iii) weight on bit and (iv) Reynolds number function of circulating mud through drill <b>bit</b> <b>nozzles.</b> A set of non-dominated optimal Pareto frontier is obtained for the two-objective optimization problem whereas a non-dominated optimal Pareto surface is obtained for the three-objective optimization problem. Depending on the trade-offs involved, decision makers may select any point from the optimal Pareto frontier or optimal Pareto surface and hence corresponding values of the decision variables that may be selected for optimal drilling operation. For minimizing drilling time and drilling cost, the optimum values of the decision variables are needed to be kept at the higher values whereas the optimum values of decision variables are at the lower values for the maximization of drilling depth.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{evaluates the}} {{possibility}} for a full mud return, top hole drilling system, applying a concentric dual drill string and an integrated pump. Top holes are usually drilled without mud return, leaving the cuttings on the sea floor. Sea water with barite and other additives are employed as drilling fluid and is released to the sea when used. By employing a dual drill string and a down hole pump to lift the return to top side facilities, full return is enabled. This facilitates the use of high performance mud, which have several advantages, including primary well control before the BOP is set, improved hole stability, elimination of a pilot hole to check for shallow gas influx and extended top hole sections. Possible solutions to obtain a complete and functioning new system have been analyzed. Based on existing technology and its current limitations, two alternative systems are developed on a conceptual level. The first system includes one integrated return pump, the second employs multiple integrated return pumps. The design base case is set to 1000 meter water depth and 500 meter deep well, of which 100 meter is drilled with a 36 ” drill bit, and 400 meter is drilled with a 26 ” drill bit. This base case covers most of the top holes drilled on the Norwegian sector. System pressure estimates are presented, and a mud level regulation solution is developed and analyzed. The mud level regulation system allows the mud level in the well to be controlled to keep the well balanced and stabilized, and to prevent mud discharges to sea floor. The level regulation solution is theoretically proved, and enables reliable regulation of the mud level in the well based on existing technology. Predictions of the system behavior are made, and {{the limitations of the}} systems are presented. The developed systems drilling capacities are analyzed and found not capable of fulfilling the base case requirements, due to the limitations of the selected dual drill pipe. The low flow rate of the pipe limits the ROP, due to high cutting generation with large drill bit diameters. The hydraulic horsepowers at the drill <b>bit</b> <b>nozzles</b> are also too low, due to the lowered available pressure drop, low flow rate, and large drill bit. However, the available pressure drop at the drill <b>bit</b> <b>nozzles</b> are estimated to over 80 bar. It is recommended to employ a larger dual drill pipe, with increased pressure capacity. Then the drilling capacity of the system would be comparable to other full return top hole drilling systems. The systems impact on cost and drilling parameters are discussed and found to be comparable with other innovative solutions for full return top hole drilling. There are uncertainties of both developed systems. The uncertainties regarding the system employing only one return pump concerns the design limitations of the chosen return pump type, a progressive cavity pump. The uncertainties regarding the multiple return pump system, concerns the system behavior with several return pumps distributed throughout the drill string. A full return top hole drilling system employing a concentric dual drill string and an integrated pump is found feasible. But due to existing technology limitations, a mud motor is chosen to power the return pump, this demands a drill pipe with a higher capacity than what exists today, to obtain comparable drilling capacity to other top hole drilling systems. The development of an electric conducting dual drill pipe would expand the possibilities much further, and improve the overall drilling capacity of the system...|$|R
30|$|In {{order to}} apply a {{swirling}} jet to a PDC drill <b>bit,</b> the <b>nozzle</b> performance influenced by nozzle inlet geometric parameters and rock breaking tests under submerged conditions were studied. Numerical simulation was used to study {{the influence of the}} nozzle structure on the swirling intensity and nozzle discharge coefficient. Simulation results indicate that spreading angle of the swirling jet is greater than that of the non-swirling jet, and the swirling intensity of the jet is strongly influenced by the length of the nozzle body but weakly by the number of tangential inlets. Rock breaking tests were conducted to evaluate the performance of the swirling jet. It is found that the swirling jet shows a lower threshold pressure to break the rock samples and could break rock more efficiently compared with the non-swirling jet.|$|R
