50|$|Roland's {{first album}} The Werewolf of London (1980), with {{historical}} and supernatural themes {{was picked up}} by Armageddon Records in the UK. It was there that Roland met Robyn Hitchcock who later appeared on tracks for Roland's second album. After an abortive flirtation with the music business, when he was managed by David Enthoven (manager of Roxy Music) and June Bolan (widow of Marc Bolan), Roland returned to Armageddon Records for the mini-album <b>Burnt</b> <b>Orchids.</b> Its title track was the first to feature Roland backed by a small string and woodwind ensemble, a trademark of many of his albums of the 80s and 90s.|$|R
50|$|The {{site is a}} flat {{bottomed}} valley {{with steep}} sides. The unimproved chalk grassland has several nationally rare plants, including moon carrot, spotted catsear, field fleawort, <b>burnt</b> tip <b>orchid</b> and pasque flower. There are also a variety of wild flowers such as the autumn lady’s tresses, which has been studied on the site for over fifty years. The ancient strip lynchet field system is of archaeological interest.|$|R
50|$|This {{is one of}} {{only two}} {{confirmed}} sites in Wiltshire for musk orchid (Herminium monorchis). Seven other species of orchids are presented including frog orchid (Coeloglossum viride), <b>burnt</b> <b>orchid</b> (Orchis ustulata) and fragrant orchid (Gymnadenia conopsea).|$|E
50|$|The site {{supports}} the nationally rare perfoliate pennycress and other rare plant life such as Curtis' mouse-ear, early gentian, field fleawort and <b>burnt</b> <b>orchid.</b> The Natural England assessment report of July 2011 indicates {{the range of}} orchid species expected for the site.|$|E
50|$|Neotinea ustulata (known as <b>burnt</b> <b>orchid</b> or burnt-tip orchid) is a European {{terrestrial}} orchid {{native to}} mountains {{in central and}} southern Europe, growing at up to 2400 m elevation. The plant is considered Endangered in Great Britain and Least Concern internationally based on IUCN Red List criteria. The burnt-tip orchid was voted the county flower of Wiltshire in 2002 following a poll by the wild flora conservation charity Plantlife.|$|E
50|$|The main chalk {{grassland}} communities are CG4 Brachypodium pinnatum and CG5 Bromus erectus - Brachypodium pinnatum. The reserve supports a rich flora and is notable for its orchids {{which include the}} nationally scarce <b>Burnt</b> <b>Orchid</b> (Neotinea ustulata) and Early Spider Orchid (Ophrys sphegodes). The {{chalk grassland}} is an important site for insects. It is the only site in Kent for the Wart-biter (Decticus verrucivorus) and also supports the Silver-spotted Skipper (Hesperia comma), Adonis Blue (Polyommatus bellargus) and Chalkhill Blue (Polyommatus coridon).|$|E
50|$|Folkestone Downs {{is one of}} {{the largest}} areas of {{unimproved}} chalk downland in Kent. The extensive flora includes many typical species found in chalk grassland including horseshoe vetch (Hippocrepis comosa), squinancywort (Asperula cynanchica) and small scabious, as well as scarce species such as bedstraw broomrape (Orobanche caryophyllacea). Many species of orchid grow on the downs notably the nationally rare late spider orchid (Ophrys fuciflora) as well as the nationally scarce early spider orchid (Ophrys sphegodes) and man orchid (Aceras anthropophorum). The nationally scarce <b>burnt</b> <b>orchid</b> (Neotinea ustulata) has also been recorded in the past. Folkestone Downs is also notable for its extensive lichen flora.|$|E
40|$|This article {{discusses}} problems {{concerning the}} use of colour in botanical illustrations, focusing on a specific species, the Orchis ustulata (<b>Burnt</b> <b>Orchid).</b> In 1901 - 1905 the Swedish botanist Carl Lindman (1856 - 1928) {{was responsible for the}} publication of the Swedish flora Bilder ur Nordens flora, that was, in some ways, a reworking of J. W. Palmstruch’s Svensk botanik (1802 - 1843). Palmstruch’s hand-coloured copper plates were to be transferred to chromolithographs by the artist and scientific illustrator Axel Ekblom. The text was to be completely revised by Lindman, whereas the illustrations were considered to be still valid and the original plan was simply to transfer the pictures to the new medium. Eventually Lindman, who was a skilful painter himself, was not satisfied with the old pictures, and so ended up taking a great part in the pictorial process as well. The old drawings were meticulously examined, corrected and often supplied with new, extremely magnified details. In this context of intensively studying the species Orchis ustulata, and the colouring of it, Lindman discussed its Swedish names with A. G. Nathorst, a botanist colleague. Lindman was not satisfied with the old name, Brunsvedt nyckelblomster, which indicates that the flower is brown. As he saw it, that name did not correspond to the pigments he had to use when colouring the flowers - purple rather than brown. He suggested instead that the old provincial name, Krutbrännare (roughly “burnt gunpowder”), noted by Linnaeus on his tour of the island of Öland in 1741, be applied. Linnaeus sometimes designated the colour of the plant in the text, and/or in the descriptive epithet, but he did not use colour as a distinctive feature for classifying purposes. In spite of this, botanical prints in colour were and are continuously used in publications...|$|E
