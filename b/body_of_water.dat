5|$|Recreational {{and sports}} fishers {{can help to}} prevent the spread of the {{parasite}} by not transporting fish from one <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> to another, not disposing of fish bones or entrails in any <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>water,</b> and ensuring boots and shoes are clean before moving between different bodies of water. Federal, state, provincial, and local regulations on the use of bait should be followed.|$|E
5|$|DNA {{sequencing}} {{can also}} be used more broadly to identify species present in a <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>water,</b> debris filtered from the air, or sample of dirt. This can establish the range of invasive species and endangered species, and track seasonal populations.|$|E
5|$|A {{waterspout}} is {{an intense}} columnar vortex (usually appearing as a funnel-shaped cloud) that occurs over a <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>water.</b> Some {{are connected to}} a cumulus congestus cloud, some to a cumuliform cloud and some to a cumulonimbus cloud. In the common form, it is a non-supercell tornado over water.|$|E

5|$|Additionally, {{civilian}} vessels produce sonar {{waves in}} order to measure the depth of the <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> in which they are. Similar to the navy, some boats produce waves that attract porpoises, while others may repel them. The problem with the waves that attract is that the animal may be injured or even killed by being hit by the vessel or its propeller.|$|E

5|$|The Osprey is a medium-large {{fish-eating}} {{bird of prey}} or raptor.

5|$|The Susquehanna River {{watershed}} {{is immediately}} {{north and west}} of the watershed of Black Creek, while the watershed of Turtle Creek is located immediately south of the watershed.

5|$|After peak intensity, Chapala {{skirted the}} Yemeni island of Socotra on 1November. Drier air and {{increased}} wind shear weakened the cyclone, although it maintained {{much of its}} intensity upon entering the Gulf of Aden on 2November, becoming the strongest known cyclone in that <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>water.</b> After bypassing northern Somalia, Chapala weakened further {{and turned to the}} west-northwest. Early on 3November, the storm made landfall near Mukalla, Yemen, as a very severe cyclonic storm, making it the strongest storm on record to strike the nation. The storm dissipated the next day.|$|E
5|$|All three regiments of the NK 2nd Division-the 4th, 17th, and 6th, in {{line from}} north to south-crossed during the night to {{the east side of}} the Naktong River into the 23rd Regiment sector. The NK 2nd Division, {{concentrated}} in the Sinban-ni area west of the river, had, in effect, attacked straight east across the river and was trying to seize the two avenues of advance into Changnyong above and below Lake U-p'o. On August 31, 1950, Lake U-p'o was a large <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> although in most places very shallow.|$|E

5|$|Almost every {{sizeable}} <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> in Scotland has {{an associated}} kelpie story, {{but the most}} extensively reported is that of Loch Ness. Parallels to the general Germanic neck and the Scandinavian bäckahäst have been observed. More widely, the wihwin of Central America and the Australian bunyip {{have been seen as}} counterparts. The origin of the belief in malevolent water horses has been proposed as originating in human sacrifices once made to appease gods associated with water, but narratives about the kelpie also served a practical purpose in keeping children away from dangerous stretches of water, and warning young women to be wary of handsome strangers.|$|E
5|$|In 82 Agricola crossed an {{unidentified}} <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> and defeated peoples {{unknown to the}} Romans until then. He fortified the coast facing Ireland, and Tacitus recalls that his father-in-law often claimed the island could be conquered with a single legion and a few auxiliaries. He had given refuge to an exiled Irish king whom he hoped he might use as the excuse for conquest. This conquest never happened, but some historians believe that the crossing referred to {{was in fact a}} small-scale exploratory or punitive expedition to Ireland.|$|E

With Chi's rule undone, peace is restored to Patusan. Johnny is seated as the heralded warrior prince with Ro-May as his princess and Adam as a prince. Johnny declares the monarchy to be dissolved and announces that Patusan will operate as a democracy. His reason for doing this is for the people to finally be free of rule, good or evil.|$|E
