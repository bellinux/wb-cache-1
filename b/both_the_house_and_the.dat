5|$|Over time, the Saxbe fix {{has become}} {{politically}} uncontroversial. Both Democratic and Republican Presidents {{have used the}} fix, and indeed Republican outgoing President George H. W. Bush helped Democratic incoming President Bill Clinton execute the fix by signing it into law {{on the eve of}} Clinton's inauguration. The fixes that have been enacted for Obama's cabinet have passed in <b>both</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Senate without amendment and by unanimous consent. Outgoing Republican President George W. Bush signed the Saxbe fixes for both Hillary Clinton and Ken Salazar into law for the incoming Democratic Obama administration.|$|E
5|$|Although {{having the}} same floor plan, the House and Senate {{chambers}} are decorated very differently, with the former in terra cotta and teal colors and the latter in blue and gold. An oval cartouche in the carpet {{at the entrance to}} the House chamber features the state flower, the apple blossom. Presiding over the house is the speaker, whose chair is behind a desk in the center with a plaster and paint version of the state coat of arms. The Senate chamber is somewhat smaller than the House. The president of the Senate is the lieutenant governor, who presides over sessions from a walnut rostrum at the front of the chamber. <b>Both</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Senate use computerized voting systems, including wall-mounted screens that allow visitors to follow the voting and both also contain glass tiled ceilings that allow natural light to shine through etched glass panels to better light the room. These ceiling tiles feature the coats-of-arms of each state in the United States.|$|E
5|$|The Italian {{sculptor}} Emilio Sala {{was responsible}} for both {{the internal and external}} sculptural decorations, such as mermaids, dolphins, and frogs {{on the roof of the}} building, sinking ships and hunting trophies on the exterior walls, and exuberant interior decorations, such as grand stairways and chandeliers depicting huge catfish strangled in the stems of lotus flowers. The exterior sculptures created by Sala were made out of cement. Production of the cement was by the «For» company of which Horodecki was the co-director. Cement was used exclusively as the primary building material by the request of the company's head director, Richter. At the time of the building's construction, cement was not popular as a building material, so its use was employed as publicity for <b>both</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> building material.|$|E

5|$|Willkie {{spent much}} of 1943 {{preparing}} for a second presidential run, addressing Republican and nonpartisan groups. He did not meet with Roosevelt; with the presidential election approaching and with both men likely to run in it as candidates, their continued association would have been awkward. Although they differed with him on many issues, Republican leaders recognized Willkie's appeal and they had wanted him to campaign for the party in the 1942 midterm elections, but he went around the world instead. The huge publicity received by the titular head of the Republican Party as an emissary for a Democratic president frustrated leading Republicans. In spite of this, the Republicans gained seats in <b>both</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Senate, though they still remained in the minority. Few Republican members of Congress were by then willing to support Willkie, and he dropped to second place behind General Douglas MacArthur in polls of likely voters in the party's 1944 presidential primaries. By 1943, even liberal Democrats did not doubt Willkie's progressive credentials. He spoke of appointing an African American to either the cabinet or the Supreme Court, and he warned California's Republican committee that the New Deal was irreversible and he stated that all they would get by opposing it was oblivion.|$|E

25|$|In June 2009, then-Nevada Governor Jim Gibbons {{signed the}} most {{stringent}} punishments nationwide for child prostitution and pandering. The Assembly Bill 380, {{which allows for}} fines of $500,000 for those convicted of trafficking prostitutes younger than 14 and $100,000 for trafficking prostitutes ages 14 to 17. <b>Both</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Senate unanimously approved the bill, that went into effect October 1, 2009.|$|E
25|$|When the 1st Congress {{considered}} {{a series of}} constitutional amendments, {{it was suggested that}} the two houses first adopt a resolution indicating that they deemed amendments necessary. This procedure was not used. Instead, <b>both</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Senate proceeded directly to consideration of a joint resolution, thereby implying that both bodies deemed amendments to be necessary. Also, when initially proposed by James Madison, the amendments were designed to be interwoven into the relevant sections of the original document. Instead, they were approved by Congress and sent to the states for ratification as supplemental additions (s) appended to it. Both these precedents have been followed ever since.|$|E

25|$|Bean's {{victory was}} {{considered}} to be a decisive upset in a district once considered to be reliably conservative. Making Bean's victory even more important for the Democratic Party {{was the fact that the}} Party lost seats in the House elsewhere in the country, meaning Bean's victory somewhat softened the Party's overall net defeat in the 2004 elections, which saw the reelection of Republican President George W. Bush as well as a net Republican gain in <b>both</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Senate. Given their overall dominance in the 2004 elections and a congressional district they still saw as conservative, the Republican Party marked Bean's district as one of their top priorities in the upcoming 2006 House elections.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} prepare for his {{entrance}} into Edinburgh University where he was to study modern languages, Marjoribanks spent 1927–28 in Paris and at the Convitto Maschile Valdese in Torre Pellice, Italy where he became fluent in Italian. This was to prove useful to him later. He graduated from Edinburgh University with a first class honours Master of Arts (Scotland) in 1932 and then studied German further in Bonn and Tübingen, Germany. He stayed for four months with a German newspaper proprietor’s family which coincided with the accession to power of Adolf Hitler in January 1933. Marjoribanks noted that the general attitude was “We’ve tried everything else, so {{we might as well}} try Adolf. If he’s no good we’ll get rid of him.” But, he also noted, it wasn’t as easy as that. After the war, Marjoribanks discovered that a bomb had destroyed <b>both</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> parents. Two of the three sons had died on the Eastern Front.|$|E

25|$|The {{high cost}} of IGCC is the biggest {{obstacle}} to its integration in the power market; however, most energy executives recognize that carbon regulation is coming soon. Bills requiring carbon reduction are being proposed again <b>both</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Senate, and with the Democratic majority {{it seems likely that}} with the next President there will be a greater push for carbon regulation. The Supreme Court decision requiring the EPA to regulate carbon (Commonwealth of Massachusetts et al. v. Environmental Protection Agency et al.) also speaks to the likelihood of future carbon regulations coming sooner, rather than later. With carbon capture, the cost of electricity from an IGCC plant would increase approximately 33%. For a natural gas CC, the increase is approximately 46%. For a pulverized coal plant, the increase is approximately 57%. This potential for less expensive carbon capture makes IGCC an attractive choice for keeping low cost coal an available fuel source in a carbon constrained world. However, the industry needs a lot more experience to reduce the risk premium. IGCC with CCS requires some sort of mandate, higher carbon market price, or regulatory framework to properly incentivize the industry.|$|E

Reagan's agricultural plan consisted primarily of a gradual reduction in farm subsidies. He also attacked the Department of Agriculture for [...] "looking backward" [...] when it dismissed the only expert on organic farming. Also, {{as chairman of the}} subcommittee on Department Operations, Research and Foreign Agriculture, which was in charge of regulating USDA operations, he opposed the proposals Reagan had for reforming the organization. The proposals generally involved shifting costs for meat inspections and other USDA duties from the federal government to the industry.|$|E
