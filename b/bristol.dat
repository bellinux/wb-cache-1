5|$|The city is {{also home}} to <b>Bristol</b> Rugby, formed in 1888 as <b>Bristol</b> Football Club by the merger of the Carlton club with rival Redland Park. Westbury Park {{declined}} the merger and folded, with many of its players joining <b>Bristol.</b> <b>Bristol</b> Rugby has often competed at the highest level of the sport since its formation in 1888. The club played at the Memorial Ground, which it shared with <b>Bristol</b> Rovers from 1996.

In 2014 <b>Bristol</b> Rugby moved to their new home, Ashton Gate Stadium (home to <b>Bristol</b> Rovers' rivals <b>Bristol</b> City), for the 2014–15 season. Dating from 1901, the <b>Bristol</b> Combination and its 53 clubs promote rugby union in the city and help support <b>Bristol</b> Rugby.
