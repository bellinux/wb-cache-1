500|$|The Dreamcast {{version was}} heavily criticized. Ryan Davis of GameSpot stated that [...] "the <b>best</b> <b>bet</b> <b>for</b> all {{involved}} {{would be to}} take your chips elsewhere". Similarly, IGN editor Jeremy Dunham noted that [...] "the blandness of the game's presentation would probably disappoint {{the most basic of}} cavemen. Even the graphics are disappointing. True, those card tables can look very realistic, but what else is there to marvel at? Nothing! Without any type of exploration feature, or other characters there isn't anything to render". Allgame's Bryan Hightower criticized that [...] "there are not enough games, there are annoying wait times, and the help mode is terrible". He also complained that [...] "the dealer deals painfully slow and has to say what cards you have twice. You can already read your hand right on the screen, so you don't need the dealer to waste your time". Hightower also cited that [...] "when you win at slots, the camera always goes {{to the bottom of the}} machine to show you the payout scale" [...] which [...] "becomes frustrating after a few credits because it is so slow. The act of leaving the table or machine is even slower". He also said that the advice the game gives you is [...] "Perhaps the most irritating 'feature' of this game" [...] because [...] "Each time you do something the computer wouldn't have done, a pop-up screen will appear that adds more time to the lengthy procedure of completing a bet". Hightower commented that [...] "The above-par graphics are quickly negated by the rock-bottom enjoyment factor" [...] and that [...] "this game doesn't have any of the character the real casino has".|$|E

40|$|I {{will discuss}} several {{issues related to}} the {{acceleration}} and collimation of jets from AGNs. Hydromagnetic stresses provide the <b>best</b> <b>bet</b> both <b>for</b> accelerating relativistic flows And for providing a certain amount of initial collimation. However, there are limits to how much self-collimation can be achieved without the help of an external pressurised medium. Moreover, existing models which postulate highly organized poloidal magnetic flux over much of the flow may be unrealistic. Instead, a large fraction of the magnetic energy may reside in a highly disorganized "chaotic" field. Such a field can also accelerate the flow to relativistic speeds, in some cases with greater efficiency than highly organized fields, but at the expense of self-collimation. In any case, acceleration to highly relativistic speeds may be a gradual process, occurring over several decades in radius...|$|R

However, lifestyle changes, including reduced PA opportunities in multiple settings, {{have resulted in}} an escalation of overweight and obesity and related health problems. Poor physical and mental health, including metabolic and cardiovascular problems is seen in progressively younger ages, and the systematic decline in school PA has contributed to this trend. Of note, the crowded school curriculum with an intense focus on academic achievement, lack of school leadership support, funding and resources, plus poor quality teaching are barriers to PA promotion in schools. The school setting and physical educators in particular, must embrace their role in public health by adopting a comprehensive school PA program.

40|$|In {{this article}} we study how members of an {{interdisciplinary}} research team use an online forum for communicating about their research project. We use the concepts of “community of practice” and “connectivity” to consider the online interaction within a wider question of how people from different academic traditions “do” interdisciplinarity. The online forum for this Grey and Pleasant Land project did not take off as hoped, even {{after a series of}} interventions and amendments, and we consider what the barriers were and how they might be overcome. Barriers to involvement included participants’ expectations of interaction and collaboration [...] expectation that real interaction happens elsewhere, tensions between academic discourse and forum talk norms, unfamiliarity with the technology, and different conceptions of appropriate academic discussion. We suggest that common academic practice does not prepare us well for creating interdisciplinary research communities through online collaboration tools, whereas such tools are our <b>best</b> <b>bet</b> currently <b>for</b> including geographically dispersed members in collaborative projects. Therefore, careful planning and competence building would be necessary if such tools are to be used in collaborative research. Suggested interventions, based on our experience, include providing a more focused forum, making technical support easily available, and setting up particular tasks or items to debate, within a preset, synchronous timeframe, focusing on issues relevant to the project at that time...|$|R
50|$|The High-Low {{system is}} {{considered}} a level-one count, because the running count never increases or decreases {{by more than a}} single, predetermined value. A multilevel count, such as Zen Count, Wong Halves or Hi-Opt II, makes finer distinctions between card values to gain greater play accuracy. Rather than all cards having a value of +1, 0, or −1, an advanced count might also include card ranks that are counted as +2 and −2, or +0.5 and -0.5. Advanced players might additionally maintain a side count (separate count) of specific cards, such as a side count Aces, to deal with situations where the <b>best</b> count <b>for</b> <b>betting</b> accuracy differs from the best count for playing accuracy.|$|R

The <b>best</b> <b>bet</b> is then evaluated against its associated Resource Requirements, Tradeoffs, Effectiveness, Risks, Framework conditions, Attractiveness and its Cross Cutting relevance as far as biodiversity, climate change adaptation, mitigation, gender, and participation is concerned. This includes a ranking of each <b>best</b> <b>bet</b> on a scale of - 2 to + 2; minus indicating a negative and plus a positive impact. We also highlight cases when farmers redesigned the <b>best</b> <b>bet,</b> as well as proven cases of success and additional literature sources. Resource requirements are further sub-divided into: Organic inputs; Inorganic inputs; Land, land tenure; Labour; Money, cash, loan; Time; Machinery, animal draught, other tools; Market demand; and Others. Each of these requirements is evaluated on a scale of 1 to 10 in terms of the probability that absence or excess of the required item/input jeopardizes the overall success of the <b>best</b> <b>bet,</b> Here, 1 means very little impact and 10 very high impact.

30|$|The cow is {{the most}} {{important}} farm animal in parts of Africa. But climate change is threatening the existence of cattle. The difficulties of raising cattle when rainfall is scarce have seen some pastoralists across the entire country, not only in the traditional arid areas of north eastern Kenya, adopt camel husbandry in the last few years. The value of camels is now becoming increasingly acknowledged by Kenyan policymakers and researchers since climate variability has become a big challenge. The drought of 2005 to 2006 led to a 70 % fall in the size of pastoralists' herds of cattle, goats and sheep. This situation left many pastoralists poor and, as a result, become dependent on relief food (Baird [2008], p. 4). This has led some Kenyans in northern Kenya to abandon cattle rearing in favour of camels. This includes the Rendille pastoralists, while the Borana are heading in the same direction, and the Pokot, Maasai and Samburu groups have begun to introduce camels into their cattle herds. Some development agencies such as Ewaso Nyiro Development Authority, Arid-lands, FARM Africa, Lands Resource Management, CARE-Kenya, Food for the Hungry Kenya and Kenya Agricultural Research Institute (KARI) have started to promote camel rearing in the ASAL of northern Kenya. Camels can contribute to food security, given the lower ability of cattle to withstand the harsh climatic conditions associated with climate variability. It was important to try and understand whether the Borana communities of Isiolo were ready to let go their cattle culture and embrace camel production, which could be the <b>best</b> <b>bet</b> option <b>for</b> reducing poverty and food insecurity in the dry lands of northern Kenya.|$|R
