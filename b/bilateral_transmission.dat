40|$|Asymptotic {{analysis}} and Monte Carlo simulations show that spillover estimates obtained from widely-used bilateral (such as two-country VAR) models are significantly less accurate than those obtained from multilateral (such as global VAR) models. In particular, {{the accuracy of}} spillover estimates obtained from bilateral models depends on two aspects of economies 2 ̆ 019 integration {{with the rest of}} the world. First, accuracy worsens as direct <b>bilateral</b> <b>transmission</b> channels become less important, for example when the spillover-sender accounts only for a small share of the spillover-recipient 2 ̆ 019 s overall integration {{with the rest of the}} world. Second, accuracy worsens as indirect higher-order spillovers and spillbacks become more important, for example when the spillover-recipient is more integrated with the rest of the world overall. Empirical evidence on the global output spillovers from US monetary policy is consistent with these generic results: Spillover estimates obtained from two-country VAR models are systematically smaller than those obtained from a global VAR model; and the differences between spillover estimates obtained from two-country VAR models and a global VAR model are more pronounced for economies for which the US accounts for a smaller share of their overall trade and financial integration with the rest of the world, and for economies which are more integrated with the rest of the world overall...|$|E
40|$|The {{title of}} my Bachelor’s Thesis is The Alteration of the Representation of the Minister for Education and Science Mailis Reps – the Case of Postimees daily. I {{examined}} three periods – 2002 – 2003, 2005 and 2006 – 2007. My {{purpose was to}} study how media represents {{a person who has}} an important institutional role in the society and how media looks in the case of Reps at the person, politician and institution. Main question was – how is the representation of Reps changed from 2002 to 2007 ? My hypotheses were following – Reps is represented in all periods negatively and controversially, the practice of giving labels is used very often, occupational incapacity of Reps is put on the foreground, an image of a young politician is constructed for Reps. To answer my research question, I conducted a quantitative content analysis and qualitative discourse analysis of texts. From the quantitative analysis I found out that: 1. The majority of texts had a negative orientation towards Reps. 2. The majority of texts handled Reps’s occupational failures and incapacities. 3. The conflict of Reps’s incapacity was the biggest in the third period. 4. The orientation of the text’s author was positive in the first period. 5. The majority of texts with negative orientation were published in the second period. 6. The interest towards Reps was the biggest in the second period. From the qualitative analysis I found out that: 1. The most important role in the case of Reps was the role of the institution. It was followed by the role of the person and the politician. 2. An image of a minister-trainee was formed for Reps. A stereotype is used that a young person is weak in the role of a minister because one has no life or administration experience. 3. The negativity of the journalists has disappeared in the third period but the criticism of the institution (Postimees) has increased. 4. Reps has been identified by gender and motherhood, and slightly by appearance. 5. The representation of photos is somewhat positive. 6. In the case of a few caricatures the note of criticism has been increased. Due to this the photo carries a bigger emotional meaning than the text does. 7. The representation of Reps is identified by high appraisal and by low neutrality and objectivity. 8. The practice of giving labels is usual in the case of representing Reps. 9. Reps’s comments are positive. She does not take criticism very seriously. Her use of language is a little naïve and rough around the edges. 10. The conflict of Reps’s failure has increased but the amount of texts which deal with the question of the educational problems has decreased. 11. Negativity towards Reps is increased by her visit to Mari, by her party background and by taking her two week old daughter with her to work. 12. The negativity in the headlines has decreased and the positivism increased. 13. The disappointment in Reps has increased and expectations of her decreased. 14. Reps is not identified through her field but through visit to Mari and through the child topic. On the results of my research I conclude that: 1. In {{spite of the fact that}} Reps as a person is represented positively, some of her personal qualities are not counted as acceptable in the role of the institution. These qualities are her age, mother language and confidence. 2. In the representation of Reps there has been used a constructive model in stead of a cognitive one. Same topics and arguments are being used. 3. There has been formed a myth that Reps has failed in her profession as a minister. 4. The topic of education has been personified. Reps is a sign which has hindered the discussion of educational matters. 5. A <b>bilateral</b> <b>transmission</b> has taken place – the criticism of the educational system in Estonia and the criticism of the Ministry of Education and Science has transferred to the minister and vice versa. 6. Also a bilateral disappointment has occurred – Postimees as the institution, journalists and other authors have been disappointed in Reps and Reps is frustrated by the media. 7. Reps is a sign of the time – she indicates the selectiveness, randomness and exclusion in the media...|$|E

40|$|Abstract – Under a {{deregulated}} environment, electricity {{consumers and}} suppliers {{are permitted to}} establish various <b>bilateral</b> contracts. The <b>transmission</b> company, however, has only to honor and execute these bilateral contracts {{as far as the}} system design and operating conditions permit. A fundamental question is then to what extent these contracts could affect the system loadability and what kinds of sys-tem reinforcements will be required to meet the future contracts needs. This paper describes a series of studies modeling bilateral contracts by means of further con-straints added to an OPF model representing the Maxi-mum Load Increase (MLI). Numerical experiments are then presented to illustrate how the use of FACTS devices installed in the transmission network allows improving the system loadability, conversely eventually limited by the presence of bilateral contracts...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} the volatility transmission between {{credit default swap}} (CDS), bonds and equities for U. S. corporate entities during the recent financial crisis. The study sample covers the 2005 - 2010 period and is separated in two parts – pre-crisis period and crisis period. The separation of the data in two samples is made to facilitate the comparison between the two periods and to provide evidence {{of the behavior of}} the three markets in different credit conditions. The paper utilizes the GARCH-BEKK model and finds evidence of relatively limited volatility transmission during the pre-crisis period mainly from the CDS and equity markets to the bond market. In contrast, during the financial crisis the linkage between the three markets has increased dramatically, with <b>bilateral</b> volatility <b>transmission</b> between all three markets. A further analysis is carried out to investigate the causes for this strong volatility transmission during the crisis period. The companies from the sample are separated in two sub samples – bad potential companies and good potential companies. The main finding is that volatility spillover for bad potential companies is very high, while for good potential companies it is very low. Overall, the strong linkage between the markets that is found in the crisis period implies that none of the markets incorporates new credit information more efficiently than the others. Thus, the main implication of the study is that investors, market participants and regulators should look into all three markets for signs of changing credit conditions. In addition, the limited volatility spillover for good potential companies during the crisis period implies that even though the correlation between markets has increased market participants can still find investments that offer diversification.

40|$|In {{conventional}} <b>bilateral</b> teleoperation, <b>transmission</b> delay {{over the}} Internet can potentially cause instability. The wave variable algorithm guarantees stability under varying transmission delay {{at the cost}} of poor transient performance. Adding a predictor on the master side can reduce this undesirable side-effect, but that would require a slave model. An inaccurate slave model used in the predictor as well as variations in transmission delay, both of which are likely under realistic situations, can result in steady state errors. A direct drift control algorithm is used to drive this error to zero regardless of the source of error. A semi-adaptive predictor that can distinguish between free space and rigid contact environment is used to provide more accurate force feedback on the master side. A full adaptive predictor is also used that estimates the slave environment parameters using recursive least squares with a forgetting factor. This research presents the experimental results and evaluations of the wave variable based methods under a realistic operation environment using a real master and slave. The effectiveness of this algorithm is fully evaluated using human subjects with no previous experience in haptics. Three algorithms are tested using PHANTOM brand haptic devices as master and slave: conventional bilateral teleoperation with no transmission delay as control, wave variable teleoperation with approximately 200 ms transmission delay one way, and wave variables with adaptive predictor and direct drift control with approximately 200 ms transmission delay one way. For each algorithm the human subjects are asked to perform three simple tasks: use the master to force the slave to track a reference trajectory in free space with the least amount of error, identify a contour surface on the slave side as accurately as possible using only haptic information from the master, and navigate a simple maze on the slave side in the least amount of time using haptic information from the master.

40|$|The rapid {{increase}} in the volume of unsolicited commercial e-mails, also known as spam, is beginning to take its toll in system administrators, business corporations and end-users. Widely varying estimates of the cost associated with spam {{are available in the}} literature. However, a quantitative analysis of the determinant characteristics of spam traffic is still an open problem. This work fills this gap and presents what we believe to be the first extensive characterization of a spam traffic. As basis for our characterization, standard spam detection techniques are used to classify over 360 thousand incoming e-mails to a large university into two categories, namely spam and non-spam. For each of the two resulting workloads, {{as well as for the}} aggregate workload, we analyze a set of parameters, aiming at identifying the characteristics that significantly distinguish spam from non-spam traffic, assessing the qualitative impact of spam on the aggregate traffic and, possibly, drawing insights into the design of more effective spam detection techniques. Our characterization reveals significant differences in the spam and non-spam traffic patterns. E-mail arrival process, size distribution as well as the distributions of popularity and temporal locality of e-mail recipients are key workload aspects which distinguish spam from traditional e-mail traffic. We conjecture that these differences are consequence of the inherently different mode of operation of spam and non-spam senders. Whereas non-spam e-mail transmissions are typically driven by social <b>bilateral</b> relationships, spam <b>transmission</b> is usually a unilateral action, based solely on the senders’s will to reach as many users as possible...|$|R
