This paper explores the current status and features of Taiwan’s national systems of innovation (NSI) for its machine tool industry. It is suggested that five major elements of the NSI explain the extensive diffusion of new technologies in the industry, namely: industry clusters, educational system, <b>bridging</b> <b>institutions,</b> government policy, and global business environment. Further, the structural and institutional problems of the innovation system are identified. Future directions of technology development are also discussed...|$|R

30|$|In addition, {{due to the}} {{possibility}} of observing and testing the innovation, or part of it, the transfer and implementation costs were perceived as manageable. On the other hand, decision criteria for investing in an organizational innovation were not discussed in the selected theoretical literature. However, based on the empirical findings in Alänge and Steiber (2011), the assumption that {{there is a lack of}} more traditional calculation models for investments in organizational innovations seemed to be correct. The decision to invest was instead influenced by a number of triggers during different steps in the diffusion process. For example, the desirability was influenced by demand from the corporate group management, perceived crises, fads, awareness of role-model organizations (such as Toyota), market demands, the work of national <b>bridging</b> <b>institutions,</b> and user networks, while perceived feasibility was influenced by aspects such as user networks at a low organizational distance, previously adopted organizational innovations, the CEO’s previous experience, and the work of national <b>bridging</b> <b>institutions.</b> The final decision to test and later implement the innovation was then primarily based on the CEO’s belief in the benefits of the organizational innovation. This belief had to be sustained in order to sustain the innovation. In the empirical studies, the top managements’ beliefs persisted over time, but theoretically this belief could also have been negatively affected by the same triggers as those that created the desire and feasibility for the innovation, or by unreasonably high internal inertia.|$|R
30|$|Furthermore, Alänge and Steiber (2011) {{found that}} the standardizations of the {{innovation}} itself, {{as well as of}} its implementation, were enacted at both national and firm/organization levels. <b>Bridging</b> <b>institutions</b> and consultants (Bessant and Rush 1995; Wright et al. 2012) were found {{to play an important role}} in the process of standardizing (or re-standardizing) the organizational innovation at the national level, while early adopters influenced the initial standardization of the innovation at the level of the firm/organization. In comparison, Ganter and Hecker (2013) did not find that market sources (consultants) were important, while professional sources (industry organizations, professional associations, etc.) played a major role among knowledge-based relations in their German sample.|$|R

30|$|To begin with, both {{categories}} {{have been}} affected by the external context. For both systems, institutional setup has {{played a role in the}} first two steps, desirability and feasibility.

In the case of GIS, the institutional setup of Silicon Valley seems to have influenced the firm in relation to local norms about organizing for openness and networking (Steiber and Alänge 2013 c). Silicon Valley also provides access to knowledge via local universities (Stanford University and the University of California, Berkeley) and to “intelligent” capital via a knowledgeable business angel network and a venture capital industry.|$|R

In doing so, public policies that have brought about a greater need for a greater number of people to rely on personal debt remain largely beyond public view and have instead been reconstituted as problems of access to financial capability training...|$|R
40|$|<b>Bridging</b> <b>institutions</b> or organisations are {{regarded}} as having positive effects in the Sectoral Systems of Innovation (SSI) literature, particularly in compensating for weaknesses in these systems. Yet, we know little about the organisational practices that make their role effective, or the types of innovation paths that they may facilitate within a system. This paper shows how bridging organisations may promote neglected areas of creativity and potential disruptive innovation. These blocked opportunities tend to emerge at the boundaries of SSI: where old sectors overlap and new trajectories form. We draw on the social networks, entrepreneurship and disruptive innovation literature and analyse an intervention in the UK electronic games industry: the evaluation of business propositions exploiting new gaming platforms such as mobile telephones, DVD and film. Using an innovative co-productive research design, the study shows how the effectiveness of bridging organisation activity depends on key design choices and brokerage capabilities...|$|R

They are independent, member-owned and democratically governed businesses, created with equity financed by members who invest in order to benefit through their patronage. Cooperatives are built on a “collective identity and shared destiny. ” This characteristic is the underlying factor in the rise of cooperative networks in the face of national and/or regional conflict and hostile, monopolistic alien enterprises and or middlemen/usurers. 1 This paper details the distinct contributions, attributes and recent examples of how cooperatives achieve economic and social development during conflict and in failing, failed and recovering states including Bosnia, East Timor, Lebanon, Mozambique, Rwanda, Macedonia and Nepal.

Surveys of 232 individuals showed a diversity of formal and informal institutions that relate to most aspects of rural life.

30|$|The two outer {{circles in}} Fig.  1 {{represent}} the external context. The outermost circle signifies {{the external environment}} {{in the form of}} institutional setup, local norms and history, and existing weak ties that the organization has through its employees with networks that are active outside the local context. The external environment also includes factors such as a sector’s characteristic competitive pressure and dynamics—stemming from, say, the pace of technological development. The dotted area represents diffusion channels, such as the movement of people (e.g., a new CEO), board members, user networks, <b>bridging</b> <b>institutions,</b> universities, and consultants. These diffusion channels—or change agents, as Birkinshaw et al. (2008) would call them—could {{play an important role in}} communicating, translating, and “selling” organizational innovations to a firm. These channels act as mechanisms that could trigger one or several of the five steps (visualized as flashes). The triggers may come in the form of an internal perception of crisis, a new market or owner demand (perhaps itself triggered by technological development and a lower entry barrier in a certain sector), a national or international fad, “proof of benefits” in a user network, or a CEO’s or board’s conviction based on previous experience and user competence with respect to the specific innovation.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the changing role of multinationals {{in the global}} generation, adoption and transfer of innovation. It is argued {{that the combination of}} traditional asset exploiting objectives with increasing asset seeking activities entails a transition of multinationals towards a double network structure. On the one hand multinationals are more and more characterised by the interconnection {{of a large number of}} internal units that are deeply involved in the company’s use, generation and absorption of knowledge. On the other hand, units belonging to the internal network tend to develop external networks with other firms and institutions that are located outside the boundaries of the multinational firm, in order to increase the potential for use, generation and absorption of knowledge. Extending the analysis to a more general level, it is suggested that each of the external actors with which multinationals are interconnected across countries are themselves involved in extensive webs of relationships with other firms and institutions. By becoming embedded in different local contexts, multinational firms act as <b>bridging</b> <b>institutions</b> connecting a number of geographically dispersed economic and innovation systems. As a result, they are conditioned by, and contribute to, the evolution of different contexts in which they operate. innovation, multinational firms, networks. ...|$|R

40|$|Food-oriented markets, {{such as food}} {{innovation}} districts (FIDs), {{have been}} touted as potential methods to address complex societal issues involving the environment, poverty, and health. On this front the Grand Rapids Downtown Market (DTM) was created in 2013, envisioned as a vibrant public space for local food, entrepreneurship, community health, and jobs. An innovative, collective response to the interconnected and urgent problems of poverty, access, health, diet, and environment, the DTM {{can serve as a}} case study through which the value and necessity of a wicked problems framework become apparent. Wicked problems literature demonstrates that collaborative and iterative processes are essential to effective and inclusive transformational change of food systems, while also emphasizing {{that there can be no}} final, ideal solution. On the other hand, as an FID intentionally located in a low-income neighborhood, the DTM has been subject to criticism about top-down, expensive, and exclusionary practices aimed at gentrification. In the end, this analysis suggests that while FIDs can address local problems resulting from dominant food systems and practices, they can also function as a gentrifying force. Efforts more directly aimed at bottom-up, participatory engagement are essential to making collectively systemic, equitable changes in current food systems and practices.

40|$|Purpose – Many studies {{emphasize}} the importance of technology brokers in fostering innovation in small and medium enterprises. Despite this acknowledged relevance, the literature does not supply a clear vision of the key activities that characterise the intervention of such intermediaries. This paper aims to identify the key brokers’ activities and their overall process of intervention to clarify the role of technology broker in fostering innovation in Small and Medium Enterprises. Design/methodology/approach – The research process was based on in-depth theoretical and empirical investigations. Firstly, using an approach that combined elements of systematic literature review with focus group meetings, we identified a research framework synthesizing the key activities that characterize the brokers’ intervention. Subsequent, to get a closer insight into brokers’ role, we investigated empirically the activities and intervention process of six <b>bridging</b> <b>institutions.</b> Originality/value – Reviewing literature, we developed a research framework showing the groups of activities the brokers could carry out to support innovation in SMEs. The empirical analysis of the six heterogeneous bridging organizations provides an overview of the brokers’ activities and highlights the presence of different possible level of interventions. Merging theoretical and empirical evidences, the paper synthetizes the overall process of intervention of technology brokers and the presence of three main brokers’ roles, namely networking role, integration role and absorptive role. Practical implications – The identified research framework and the three brokers’ role could be useful to investigate empirically the brokerage institutions operating in the national and international context...|$|R
