He flew to Farnborough in a Vickers F.B.16 to collect his new Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5a before returning to France to lead his new Squadron. On 3 July he flew <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> fighter and over his home in Kingston upon Thames, taking the aircraft to 17,000 feet and circling London for an hour. When he landed he made his last entry into his log book. His total flying time had reached 872 hours and 40 minutes.|$|E
5|$|The {{plan for}} 1711 again called for land and sea-based attacks, but its {{execution}} was a disaster. A fleet of 15 ships {{of the line}} and transports carrying 5,000 troops led by Admiral Hovenden Walker arrived at Boston in June, doubling the town's population and greatly straining the colony's ability to provide necessary provisions. The expedition sailed for Quebec at the end of July, but a number of its ships foundered on the rocky shores near the mouth of the Saint Lawrence in the fog. More than 700 troops were lost, and Walker called off the expedition. In the meantime, Nicholson had departed for Montreal overland but had only reached Lake George when word reached him of Walker's disaster, and he also turned <b>back.</b> <b>In</b> <b>this</b> expedition, the Iroquois provided several hundred warriors to fight with the English colonists, but they simultaneously sent warnings to the French about the expedition, effectively playing both sides of the conflict.|$|E

25|$|Duchamp {{participated in}} the design of the 1938 International Surrealist Exhibition, which was held at the Galerie des Beaux-arts, Paris. The show {{featured}} more than 60 artists from different countries, including approximately 300 paintings, objects, collages, photographs, and installations. The surrealists wanted to create an exhibition which in itself would be a creative act, and André Breton named Duchamp, Wolfgang Paalen, Man Ray, Salvador Dali, and Max Ernst to help him. At the exhibition's entrance he placed Salvador Dalí's Rainy Taxi, a work consisting of a taxicab rigged to produce a drizzle of water down the inside of its windows, with a shark-headed creature in the driver's seat, and a blond mannequin covered with live snails in the <b>back.</b> <b>In</b> <b>this</b> way Duchamp confronted guests entering the exhibition, who were in full evening dress.|$|E
500|$|Writing for The Onions The A.V. Club, Noel Murray {{gave the}} episode a [...] "B", {{remarking}} that he [...] "enjoyed the episode overall—largely because it's {{just such a}} treat to have be [...] <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> world with these people—I'm not sure it was wholly successful {{in its attempt to}} play by the old rules." [...] He added that after the opening exchange between Olivia and Fauxlivia, the episode [...] "settles into a fairly typical" [...] Fringe formula involving a [...] "villain of the week" [...] and a freakish event. Andrew Hanson of the Los Angeles Times praised Anna Torv's two performances and believed [...] "the containment built around 'the Machine'" [...] may [...] "have been my favorite part of the episode." ...|$|E
500|$|In one experiment, Lavoisier {{observed}} {{that there was}} no overall increase in weight when tin and air were heated in a closed container. He noted that air rushed in when he opened the container, which indicated that part of the trapped air had been consumed. He also noted that the tin had increased in weight and that increase was the same as the weight of the air that rushed <b>back</b> <b>in.</b> <b>This</b> and other experiments on combustion were documented in his book Sur la combustion en général, which was published in 1777. In that work, he proved that air is a mixture of two gases; 'vital air', which is essential to combustion and respiration, and azote (Gk. [...] "lifeless"), which did not support either. Azote later became nitrogen in English, although it has kept the earlier name in French and several other European languages.|$|E

500|$|Kim Newton {{wrote the}} episode, but fellow writer Darin Morgan {{provided}} assistance on the script. Several references to previous Morgan-penned episodes {{make an appearance}} in [...] "Quagmire". Scully's dog Queequeg, which {{first appeared in the}} episode [...] "Clyde Bruckman's Final Repose" [...] was killed in this episode. Story editor Frank Spotnitz stated that the dog was brought <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> episode simply to kill it, seeking to incorporate it in an episode in a grisly fashion. Furthermore, [...] "Stoner" [...] kid (Tyler Labine) and hesitant [...] "Chick" [...] (Nicole Parker) both first appeared in the episode [...] "War of the Coprophages". The episode also contained various series in-jokes and pop culture references. Millikan County, where the lake in the episode is located, is named after casting director Rick Millikan. The boat that Mulder and Scully ride on in this episode, the Patricia Rae, is named after the mother of director Kim Manners. Mulder's discussion about having a wooden leg in this episode is a reference to the book Games People Play.|$|E
2500|$|Chamberlain {{continued}} to believe {{right up until}} the end of the war that Germany would win only if the people willed victory enough and this sort of ideological war between [...] "German idealism" [...] vs. [...] "Jewish materialism" [...] could only end with one side utterly crushing the other. In the last two years of the war, Chamberlain became obsessed with defeating the [...] "inner enemy" [...] that he believed was holding Germany <b>back.</b> <b>In</b> <b>this</b> regard, Chamberlain frequently asserted that Germany was not one nation, but two; on one side, the [...] "patriots" [...] like Admiral Alfred von Tirpitz, General Erich Ludendorff, Field Marshal Paul von Hindenburg, Wolfgang Kapp, J. F. Lehmann and Count von Reventlow and on the other the [...] "traitors" [...] which included people like Philipp Scheidemann, Eduard David and Matthias Erzberger. No compromise between these two Germanies was possible or desirable Chamberlain argued, and one would have to be destroyed. Chamberlain's wartime writings against the [...] "inner enemy" [...] anticipated the [...] "stab-in-the-back legend" [...] which emerged after 1918. Chamberlain was a founding member of both the extreme-right, anti-Semitic Deutschlands Erneuerung newspaper, and of the Fatherland Party in 1917. The character of the Fatherland Party was well illustrated by an infamous incident in January 1918 when at a Fatherland Party rally in Berlin, a group of disabled war veterans were invited to debate the Fatherland Party's speakers. The wounded veterans, including men who were paralyzed, blinded, missing limbs, etc. all declared that they were now against the war and had become pacifists. The crippled veterans deplored the Fatherland Party's militarism and demand for war to go until victory, regardless of how many more would have to die or end up living with destroyed bodies. The ultra-nationalists of the Fatherland Party were so enraged by what the crippled veterans had to say that the audience stormed the stage, and savagely beat the disabled veterans senselessly. Chamberlain who lived in Bayreuth was not present during the Berlin rally, but expressed his approval of what happened when he heard of it.|$|E
