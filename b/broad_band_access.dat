40|$|The {{need for}} value added and {{differentiated}} {{services such as}} video-telephony, internet TV. etc in the broadband access hardware continue to increase rapidly nowadays, {{so we need to}} analyze the capabilities of the <b>broad</b> <b>band</b> <b>access</b> network architecture whether it can meet the design challenges for providing triple –play services (e. g. video on demand, voice IP). these services generally consumes very high bandwidth, highly delay sensitive and requires efficient hardware. Most of the service provider based <b>broad</b> <b>band</b> <b>access</b> network has a DSLAM which is a high end network multiplexer; a DSLAM should be completely analyzed based on the following design challenges such as bandwidth scalability, packet scheduling with less complexity, quality of service (QoS) assurance and a good application support. Because implementing triple service in a network needs an intelligent access hardware which adopts itself to meet the requirements. So the ultimate aim {{of this paper is to}} focus on the design challenges and the emerging recent trends in triple-play service deployment and how Intelligent DSLAM facilitates itself to meet the challenges in terms of selecting appropriate network processor and aggregation network migration...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we discuss {{different}} business models for deployment and operation of femtocell networks intended for provisioning of public mobile <b>broad</b> <b>band</b> <b>access</b> services. In these types of business cases the operators use femtocells {{in order to reduce}} investments in "more costly" macro networks since the traffic can be "offloaded" to "less costly" femtocell networks. This is in contrast to the many business cases presented in Femtoforum where femtocells mainly are discussed as a solution to improve indoor coverage for voice services in homes and small offices, usually for closed user groups The main question discussed in this paper is if "operators need to consider new forms of cooperation strategies in order to enable large scale deployment of femtocells for public access?" By looking into existing solutions for indoor wireless access services we claim that the answer is both "Yes" and "No". No, since many types of cooperation are already in place for indoor deployment. Yes, because mobile operators need to re-think the femtocell specific business models, from approaches based on singe operator networks to different forms of cooperation involving multi-operator solutions, e. g. roaming and network sharing.

It {{is characterized by the}} so-called four Vs: volume, velocity, veracity and variety and may bring significant value through the processing of Big Data. The transformation of Big Data's 4 Vs into the 5 th (value) is a grand challenge for processing capacity. Cloud Computing has emerged as a new paradigm to provide computing as a utility service for addressing different processing needs with a) on demand services, b) pooled resources, c) elasticity, d) <b>broad</b> <b>band</b> <b>access</b> and e) measured services.

Quite a number of commendable works have been done to introduce paging in WLAN and, thereby properly manage scarce network resources such as bandwidth and power. In this work, the authors consider it pertinent to go a step further and design a paging algorithm for campus WLAN, which will take advantage of the unique campus setting and activities. We, therefore, propose a User-Activity Dependent Paging Scheme (UADPS) in a Multi-Cell Campus WLAN Environment; a paging algorithm that considers mobile devices in a multi cell WLAN. This is because we believe that such algorithm will not only be simple to implement, but will make a great positive impact on resource savings for on-campus WLAN users. Results obtained shows that the UADPS utilizes less network resources in searching for an MH when compared to the IEEE 802. 11 power save mode algorithm. ...|$|R

By adopting these structures, it can produce four different bands, while maintaining a small size and a simple structure. Furthermore, a prototype of the quad-band antenna is designed and fabricated.

50|$|About CST ShimlaCentral {{school for}} Tibetans earlier known as Tibetan School Society, Chota Shimla {{came into being}} in early 1961 when Tibetan Administration in Dharamsala {{appointed}} Shri Sonam Topjor Tethong as the first principal of the school. Shri Sonam Topjor Tethong and his assistants made the necessary arrangements when {{the first group of}} 155 students arrived from a nursery in Dharamsala. The school was later taken over by CTSA on May 5, 1962, during the tenure of Pt. Shyam Narayan, the first Secretary of CTSA which was earlier called Tibetan Schools' Society (TSS). With the arrival of more and more children, the existing accommodation was inadequate. So a branch school was also opened at Earlsfield near St. Bedes' College. In 1969 the school was affiliated to CBSE and in March 1973, the first batch of Higher Secondary School (Class XI) appeared in the All India Secondary School Examination conducted by Central Board of Secondary Education in Delhi. When the new education system of 10+2 was introduced in 1976, the senior students of CST Shimla were redistributed to augment the strength of other CST's to make them viable as per newly introduced India's education system and CST Shimla, remained Secondary School (Class X). On October 27, 1983, the main Torrentium building which housed the girls' hostel and junior boys' hostel was gutted in a fire accident due to an electric short circuit. Fortunately, no loss of life occurred in the accident although it was a major fire during odd hours. Since then, a hostel building with an intake capacity of 350 children, a class room block and a Library block have been constructed during the tenure of Shri. S.P. Datta, the then Secretary of CTSA. The school was upgraded to Senior Secondary (Class XII) level in the year 1987. Due to the generous funding Central Tibetan Schools Administration, Delhi under the Ministry of Human Resources & Development, Government of India, the school provides all the modern day facilities to students that include Smart Classroom, Computer Lab with Unlimited <b>Broad</b> <b>Band</b> Internet <b>Access,</b> Science laboratories, Library, Sports Facility, etc.At present the school is offering students in the senior classes the choice of studying Humanities and Food and Beverages.|$|R
