He started drinking, and relationships <b>between</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> the rest of the band became strained, particularly with Blackmore. On 6 November 1971, he collapsed with hepatitis while waiting to board a plane in Chicago, cancelling the remainder of a US tour.|$|E

They teleport Gordon away from the scene, much to the G-Man's displeasure.|$|E
5|$|Bush was {{described}} as having especially close personal relationships with Tony Blair of Great Britain and Vicente Fox of Mexico, although formal relations were sometimes strained. Other leaders, such as Afghan president Hamid Karzai, Ugandan president Yoweri Museveni, Spanish prime minister José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, and Venezuelan president Hugo Chávez, openly criticized the president. Later in Bush's presidency, tensions arose <b>between</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> Vladimir Putin, {{which led to a}} cooling of their relationship.|$|E

50|$|Vorphalack {{argued that}} the main change <b>between</b> Worship <b>Him</b> <b>and</b> Blood Ritual was the record {{production}} and not the music. According to him there are songs in their sophomore album that pre-date their debut.|$|R
50|$|The video, {{directed}} by Frank Borin, starts off with Ross standing {{on top of}} a plane with sunset in the background.

5|$|Congress overrode a Johnson veto to {{pass the}} Civil Rights Act of 1866 (also {{introduced}} by Trumbull), granting African-Americans citizenship and equality before the law, and forbidding any action by a state to the contrary.

5|$|Ferguson died in Brooklyn of {{apoplexy}} {{at the age}} of 49. Initially {{buried in}} the Cemetery of the Evergreens in Brooklyn, he was later reinterred in Cypress Hills Cemetery, also in the borough of Brooklyn.

5|$|In 1230 Óláfr fled to Norway to seek {{military}} assistance against Alan {{and members of}} Clann Somairle. The Norwegian king's response was to send a fleet into the Isles {{under the command of}} Óspakr-Hákon, a member of Clann Somairle. Óspakr-Hákon was slain early in the campaign, after which Óláfr took control of the fleet and secured himself on Mann. The island-kingdom was divided <b>between</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> his mutilated nephew Guðrøðr, with the latter ruling the Hebridean portion and Óláfr ruling Mann itself. Guðrøðr was soon after killed on Lewis, and Óláfr ruled the whole Kingdom of Mann and the Isles peacefully, until his death in 1237. Óláfr's restoration on Mann was seen as a success by the Norwegians, and likely favourably viewed by the Scots as well; since the internal struggle <b>between</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> his rivals had been brought to an end. Óláfr was succeeded by his son, Haraldr. In all, three of Óláfr's sons ruled the Crovan dynasty's island-kingdom—the last of which, Magnús Óláfsson, was also the last of the dynasty to rule.|$|E

5|$|The cheering crowds {{greeting}} Jesus as {{he enters}} Jerusalem add to the animosity <b>between</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> the establishment.

5|$|The college's (unopposed) student-union president, J. Durga Rao (known as J. D.) is {{the lowest}} rung in a gang ladder {{reaching}} through the gangster Ganesh to crime boss Bhavani.

Scott Steiner received an unspecified injury at Sacrifice.|$|E
5|$|The most {{comprehensive}} primary source on Van Gogh is the correspondence <b>between</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> his younger brother, Theo.

Theo van Gogh was an art dealer and provided his brother with financial and emotional support, and access to influential people on the contemporary art scene.|$|E
5|$|The robbery {{also made}} the Bolshevik Centre unpopular more widely among European social democrat groups.

5|$|Two American presidents {{had been}} assassinated in the 19th century—Abraham Lincoln in 1865 and James A. Garfield in 1881.
