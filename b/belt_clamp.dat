40|$|The {{technology}} used in surgery for spinal deformity has progressed rapidly in recent years. Commonly used fixation techniques may include monofilament wires, sublaminar wires and cables, and pedicle screws. Unfortunately, neurological complications can occur {{with all of}} these, compromising the patients’ health and quality of life. Recently, an alternative fixation technique using a metal <b>clamp</b> and polyester <b>belt</b> was developed to replace hooks and sublaminar wiring in scoliosis surgery. The goal {{of this study was}} to compare the pull-out strength of this new construct with sublaminar wiring, laminar hooks and pedicle screws. Forty thoracic vertebrae from five fresh frozen human thoracic spines (T 5 – 12) were divided into five groups (8 per group), such that BMD values, pedicle diameter, and vertebral levels were equally distributed. They were then potted in polymethylmethacrylate and anchored with metal screws and polyethylene bands. One of five fixation methods was applied to the right side of the vertebra in each group: Pedicle screw, sublaminar <b>belt</b> with <b>clamp,</b> figure- 8 <b>belt</b> with <b>clamp,</b> sublaminar wire, or laminar hook. Pull-out strength was then assessed using a custom jig in a servohydraulic tester. The mean failure load of the pedicle screw group was significantly larger than that of the figure- 8 clamp (P =  0. 001), sublaminar belt (0. 0172), and sublaminar wire groups (P =  0. 04) with no significant difference in pull-out strength between the latter three constructs. The most common mode of failure was the fracture of the pedicle. BMD was significantly correlated with failure load only in the figure- 8 clamp and pedicle screw constructs. Only the pedicle screw had a statistically significant higher failure load than the sublaminar clamp. The sublaminar method of applying the <b>belt</b> and <b>clamp</b> device was superior to the figure- 8 method. The sublaminar <b>belt</b> and <b>clamp</b> construct compared favorably to the traditional methods of sublaminar wires and laminar hooks, and should be considered as an alternative fixation device in the thoracic spine...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{design of}} Single Acting Pulley Actuator (SAPA) Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT) {{utilizes}} combinations of DC motor system, gear reducers and power cam mechanisms to actuate primary movable pulley sheaves on the transmission shaft. The secondary pulley supported by spring provides a <b>belt</b> <b>clamping</b> force to prevent slips, while the secondary controls the rubber v-belt from slipping. Since {{the methods of}} controlling these are similar, this paper only discusses the primary part. The servomotor regulates the axial movement of primary movable pulley sheaves to shift the rubber v-belt placed between the sheaves, and change the belt-pulley contact radius. Changing this contact radius means changing the CVT ratio. Computer simulation results are presented to demonstrate {{the effectiveness of the}} proposed PD controller. The research outcome gives a significant result to complete 75. 08 ° rotation of the CAM from lower gear ratio to top gear ratio is less than 6. 79 sec, with minimum error and less overshoot with a manual PD tuning contribution to the field of DC motor based electro-mechanical CVT control system...|$|R

40|$|Copyright © 2004 SAE International Apart from {{enabling}} continuous ratio change under load, the Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT) offers, between limits, {{the ability}} to choose engine rotational speed independently of vehicle speed. Here lies a potential efficiency benefit, because the engine can operate more fuel efficiently. There are unfortunately considerable power losses within the CVT itself, causing many CVT equipped cars to be less fuel-efficient than cars with a manual transmission. The internal losses are caused for a substantial part by the CVT’s hydraulic actuation. An electromechanical CVT pulley actuation system was designed to overcome the hydraulic power loss and hence improve CVT efficiency. Spindles are driven from the fixed world through epicyclic gearings by electric motors that are placed outside the transmission housing in a cool environment. A mechanical link between the adjustment mechanisms on the two shafts provides energy exchange, thus lowering shifting power demand and actuator size. Because of this, only one electric motor actuates pulley movement on both shafts for ratio change. A second actuator keeps the belt tensioned and controls <b>belt</b> <b>clamping</b> force. A high degree of independency between ratio- and clamping force actuation can be established. A prototype {{was designed as a}} modification on a commercially available belt type CVT, which is currently in the realization phase. After trials on a test rig, the transmission will be built in to a vehicle to further evaluate the new concept...|$|R

40|$|We have {{developed}} a simple and small thermal link for cooling a cylindrical car-tridge, on which device under test is mounted. It consists of a crown-like ring with an inner diameter of 170 mm or 140 mm and a <b>clamping</b> <b>belt,</b> which is a metal spring or nylon. A thermal conduction of the thermal link is achieved as the crown-like ring clamps the disk-like stage of the cartridge with external force of a <b>clamping</b> <b>belt.</b> This link can be applied at various temperature ranges from 2 K to 100 K. The measured thermal conductance of the 170 mm link is 1. 7, 5. 6 and 3. 3 W K− 1 for 4, 12, and 80 K stages, respectively. These values are consistent with a empirical calculation within 10 % errors. This link is also effective to reduce mechanical vi-bration to be 6 µm (peak-to-peak) in the horizontal direction of the cartridge.

40|$|The RFX {{toroidal}} {{field winding}} consists of 48 coils, {{which can be}} connected in many series/parallel configurations according to the toroidal field programming required for plasma operation. For ease of maintenance each coil consists of two identical half-coils connected at the equatorial plane of the machine. To be in alignment, the half coils are placed into grooves machined in an aluminum shell, which also has the function of withstanding the overturning moment caused by to {{the interaction between the}} current and the poloidal field. Stainless-steel <b>clamping</b> <b>belts</b> are provided around the coils to withstand their electromagnetic expansion forces and to keep them in the grooves. Thermal expansion of the half coils takes place freely along the grooves, due to thin layers of low-friction material placed on the coil surfaces.

40|$|Our {{investigations}} {{aimed at}} the veterinarian and epidemiological-hygienic assessment of the processing procedures for hen's faeces. The following steps were investigated and assessed with bacteriological and physico-chemical methods: drying of faeces on conveyor <b>belts</b> and in <b>clamps,</b> storage of faeces, open composting, reactor composting, fast drying of faeces and their stored final products. From an epidemiological-hygienic-bacteriological point of view, the production of dry faeces by means of ventilated conveyor belts is less favorable than the production of dry faeces in floor management. Faeces from ventilated conveyor belts should not be directly put into the soil for hygienic reasons. The ventilated drying in henhouses is followed by storing and composting before utilization. The at least 12 -week storing of the faeces {{in the open air}} is sufficient for this purpose. If all process parameters -particularly a grain size of #<=# 6 mm; 0. 36 cm" 3 - are observed, a product comes into being after the application of the fast drying procedure of faeces (Wandersleben procedure of treating hen's faeces) which is acceptable from an epidemiological-hygienic point of view.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{how to make}} a finite element model of a scooter CVT. This finite element model will be made in ABAQUS. To check the results from the ABAQUS model an experimental CVT test setup is used. While making a model, different in fluences will be studied and simplified to make a simple but effective model for studying rubber belt CVTs. First some material test are done to achieve the material properties of the belt. The properties of the pulleys and boss are achieved from the manufacturer. From the measurements can be concluded, that the belts material is anisotropic and viscoelastic in the longitudinal direction. Because the belt will be simulated as isotropic and the material behavior in the longitudinal direction is most important, an isotropic viscoelastic model should be used. The reason for choosing isotropic instead of anisotropic is due to its complexity and lack of time. The other parts will be simulated as analytical rigid due to its 200 times larger Young's modulus. The simulation is split into 5 steps, it starts with a model where forces or stresses are not present, converted into a model where the pulleys are rotating and the <b>belt</b> is <b>clamped.</b> The elements used for the model are 20 -node quadratic bricks with reduced integration. To see the difference between the effects, different models are made. The details that are researched in this paper are: - The geometry of the modeled belt - Material behavior (viscoelastic/elastic) - Misalignment of the pulley sets - Symmetric/Asymetric model To see the difference and compare the results of the experiments, 6 models are made. After studying the results of the experiments and the models, {{it became clear that the}} in fluence of the torque on the effciency has the same behavior in the simulation as in the experiments. Only the in uence of the speed on the effciency is not visible in the results. To see the effects of the different details which are investigated, the mean effciency is compared between the models. The highest in uence on the effciency is the belt shape. The in uence of the cogs on the effciency was 3. 7 % on average. The in fluence of viscoelastic and misalignment were respectively 0. 89 % and 0. 33 %, which are remarkably low. In the model with cogs, only simple square cogs are used to compare against a model without cogs. Probably when a exact copy of the belt shape was used even a larger effciency increase was noticed. The difference between a symmetric or asymmetric model in mean effciency is small, only 2 %. When a model without misalignment, clearance and exact pulley positions is suffcient a symmetric model is preferred because of its lower computational costs...|$|R
