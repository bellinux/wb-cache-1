5|$|In 1985, a cinema {{owner in}} Brighton persuaded Hendry to lend him the films, {{so as to}} screen the episodes for profit while the Panopticon VI {{convention}} was being held in the town. Saied Marham, an associate of Hendry's, visited Panopticon to generate interest in the showing, only to <b>be</b> <b>dismissed</b> <b>as</b> a hoaxster, and the screening did not go ahead.|$|E
5|$|Zenobia: {{the wife}} of Odaenathus was accused by the Augustan History of having {{formerly}} conspired with Maeonius, as Hairan I was her stepson {{and she could not}} accept that he was the heir to her husband instead of her own children. However, there is no suggestion in the Augustan History that Zenobia was involved in the event that saw her husband's murder; the act is attributed to Maeonius' degeneracy and jealousy. Those accounts by the Augustan History can <b>be</b> <b>dismissed</b> <b>as</b> fiction. The hints in modern scholarship that Zenobia had a hand in the assassination out of her desire to rule the empire and dismay with her husband's pro-Roman policy can <b>be</b> <b>dismissed</b> <b>as</b> there was no reversal of that policy during the first years following Odaenathus' death.|$|E
5|$|According to the Augustan History, Odaenathus {{was assassinated}} by a cousin named Maeonius. In Augustan History, Odaenathus' son {{from his first}} wife was named Herodes and was crowned co-ruler by his father. The Augustan History claims that Zenobia conspired with Maeonius for a time {{because she did not}} accept her stepson as his father's heir (ahead of her own children). The Augustan History does not suggest that Zenobia was {{involved}} in the events leading to her husband's murder, and the crime is attributed to Maeonius' moral degeneration and jealousy. This account, according to historian Alaric Watson, can <b>be</b> <b>dismissed</b> <b>as</b> fictional. Although some modern scholarship suggests that Zenobia was involved in the assassination due to political ambition and opposition to her husband's pro-Roman policy, she continued Odaenathus' policies during her first years on the throne.|$|E

5|$|Alboin first {{distinguished}} {{himself on}} the battlefield in a clash with the Gepids. At the Battle of Asfeld (552), he killed Turismod, son of the Gepid king Thurisind, in a victory {{that resulted in the}} Emperor Justinian's intervention to maintain equilibrium between the rival regional powers. After the battle, according to a tradition reported by Paul the Deacon, to be granted the right to sit at his father's table, Alboin had to ask for the hospitality of a foreign king and have him donate his weapons, as was customary. For this initiation, he went to the court of Thurisind, where the Gepid king gave him Turismod's arms. Walter Goffart believes it is probable that in this narrative Paul was making use of an oral tradition, and is sceptical that it can <b>be</b> <b>dismissed</b> <b>as</b> merely a typical topos of an epic poem.|$|E
5|$|The {{minister}} {{charged with}} responsibility for the Act is required to publish in the Government Gazette a list stating the Government departments which are authorized departments {{for the purposes of}} the Act, and the names and addresses for service of the solicitors for the departments. As of 7 December 2005, no such list had been published. For this reason, in Chee Siok Chin v. Minister for Home Affairs (2005), decided on that date, the High Court held that instead of instituting the action against the Minister for Home Affairs and the Commissioner of Police, the applicants should have done so against the Attorney-General. Nonetheless, the suit should not <b>be</b> <b>dismissed</b> <b>as</b> this was a procedural irregularity that could be cured by substituting the Attorney-General as the respondent.|$|E
5|$|The other {{executives}} decide to produce Norville's invention {{in hopes that}} it will flop and depress the company's stock. The invention {{turns out to be}} the hula hoop, which initially fails but then turns into an enormous success. Norville allows success to go to his head and becomes yet another uncaring tycoon. Amy, who had fallen for his naive charm, is infuriated over Norville's new attitude and leaves him. Buzz, the eager elevator operator, pitches a new invention: the flexi-straw. Norville dismisses it and fires Buzz. Meanwhile, Aloysius, a Hudsucker janitor, discovers Amy's true identity and informs Mussburger. Mussburger reveals Amy's secret identity to Norville and tells him he will <b>be</b> <b>dismissed</b> <b>as</b> president after the new year. Mussburger also convinces the board that Norville is insane and must be sent to the local psychiatric hospital.|$|E

5|$|While {{the book}} was {{readable}} enough to sell, its dryness ensured that it was seen as aimed at specialist scientists and could not <b>be</b> <b>dismissed</b> <b>as</b> mere journalism or imaginative fiction. Unlike the still-popular Vestiges, it avoided the narrative style of the historical novel and cosmological speculation, though the closing sentence clearly hinted at cosmic progression. Darwin had long been immersed in the literary forms and practices of specialist science, and made effective use of his skills in structuring arguments. David Quammen has described the book as written in everyday language for a wide audience, but noted that Darwin's literary style was uneven: in some places he used convoluted sentences {{that are difficult to}} read, while in other places his writing was beautiful. Quammen advised that later editions were weakened by Darwin making concessions and adding details to address his critics, and recommended the first edition. James T. Costa said that because {{the book was}} an abstract produced in haste in response to Wallace's essay, it was more approachable than the big book on natural selection Darwin had been working on, which would have been encumbered by scholarly footnotes and much more technical detail. He added that some parts of Origin are dense, but other parts are almost lyrical, and the case studies and observations are presented in a narrative style unusual in serious scientific books, which broadened its audience.|$|E

25|$|When Claudius died, {{his brother}} Quintillus seized power with {{support of the}} Senate. With an act typical of the Crisis of the Third Century, the army refused to {{recognize}} the new Emperor, preferring to support {{one of its own}} commanders: Aurelian was proclaimed emperor in September 270 by the legions in Sirmium. Aurelian defeated Quintillus' troops, and was recognized as Emperor by the Senate after Quintillus' death. The claim that Aurelian was chosen by Claudius on his death bed can <b>be</b> <b>dismissed</b> <b>as</b> propaganda; later, probably in 272, Aurelian put his own dies imperii the day of Claudius' death, thus implicitly considering Quintillus a usurper.|$|E
25|$|In March 2013, Abdi Farah Shirdon, Prime Minister in Somalia's newly {{recognized}} Federal Government, {{issued a}} letter to the U.S. Department of State requesting that Washington grant Samatar immunity from prosecution. Samatar was previously denied immunity mainly because there was at the time no strong central authority within Somalia to claim it on his behalf. According to Samatar's attorney, Joseph Peter Drenan, the gesture was an attempt on the Somali government's part to promote reconciliation. He added that the lawsuit was now likely to <b>be</b> <b>dismissed,</b> <b>as</b> the U.S. authorities were expected to honor the Somali administration's request. In March 2015, the US Supreme Court upheld the civil lawsuit against Samatar, dismissing his appeal.|$|E

25|$|Episodes 5–8: Departure lounge. With Jamie on holiday, MDA {{take on a}} {{temporary}} case manager, Dr Andrew Morello (Vince Colosimo), an anaesthetist with strong suspicions about {{the high rate of}} infant deaths at his hospital. So when he and Amanda assist Ted Walsh (Terry Brady), a prominent doctor with similar suspicions, Morello begins to investigate - which leads him to suspect prominent cardiologist Rupert Carr (Frank Gallacher). As Morello confides in Happy, he begins attempting to stop Carr's practices, without coming out and speaking his mind, which will ultimately result in the end of both their careers. When Andrew goes up on his own charges, Happy recalls Jamie back to MDA so that Andrew can <b>be</b> <b>dismissed.</b> <b>As</b> everyone including MDA turns against him, news about his wife Lucy (Jane Allsop) ultimately compels Andrew to make a final decision. Meanwhile, Amanda goes up against Gabrielle Bromley (Wendy Hughes), a fierce prosecuting attorney.|$|E
500|$|To {{succeed in}} the taming of {{arbitrary}} political rule, Russell says, a community's goal ought to be to encourage democracy. Russell insists that the beginning of all ameliorative reforms to government must presuppose democracy as a rule.

500|$|While {{he was in}} London Belcher {{arranged}} for Lieutenant Governor Dummer {{to be replaced by}} William Tailer (whose appointment to that post in 1715 he had ironically managed to supersede by lobbying for Dummer's appointment), and recommended that Jeremiah Dummer (with whom his relations had become seriously strained) <b>be</b> <b>dismissed</b> <b>as</b> colonial agent.

500|$|During the Suez Crisis, Hussein {{requested}} that Syria, Saudi Arabia and Iraq send troops to Jordan as a precautionary measure {{to prevent a}} potential invasion of the country by the tripartite allies. Prime Minister al-Said was reticent to put Iraqi troops under Abu Nuwar's command and suggested that Abu Nuwar <b>be</b> <b>dismissed</b> <b>as</b> a prerequisite to any deployment of troops to Jordan. This did not occur, but the Iraqis nonetheless sent troops to Jordan. However, their deployment was opposed by Nabulsi {{on the grounds that}} Iraq {{was a member of the}} Baghdad Pact, an alliance of Middle Eastern countries with the UK that was condemned by Arab nationalists as a British-led attempt to stifle pan-Arab unity, instead of the Egyptian-Jordanian-Syrian-Saudi alliance known as the [...] "Amman Pact". Despite Hussein's protestations, Nabulsi, using his prerogative as head of the government, succeeded in forcing the Iraqis' withdrawal by the end of November.|$|E
500|$|Far Side Virtual was {{met with}} greater {{critical}} attention than Ferraro's previous releases. Just over a year after its release, Marc Masters at Pitchfork wrote that Far Side Virtual [...] "became Ferraro's most discussed and divisive effort, landing on year-end best-of lists as often as it got dismissed as a joke." [...] At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 77, which indicates [...] "generally favorable reviews", based on seven reviews. Critics tended to agree that Far Side Virtual takes the state of 21st-century consumerism as its subject, {{but there was no}} consensus regarding whether Ferraro intended to satirize, criticize or embrace this condition. Brandon Soderberg said that the album's concept [...] "seemed critic-proof, which was frustrating ... Negative reviews could <b>be</b> <b>dismissed</b> <b>as</b> the listeners simply not getting the joke." ...|$|E
500|$|Justice Thomas also {{clarified}} {{that officers}} need not [...] "rule {{out the possibility}} of innocent conduct" [...] before making a traffic stop based on an anonymous tip. In light of the facts described in the 911 call, Justice Thomas argued that the reckless driving described in the 911 call [...] " [...] too great a resemblance to paradigmatic manifestations of drunk driving to <b>be</b> <b>dismissed</b> <b>as</b> an isolated example of recklessness." [...] He concluded that officers therefore acted reasonably [...] "under these circumstances in stopping a driver whose alleged conduct was a significant indicator of drunk driving". Justice Thomas noted that many drivers will behave more cautiously when followed by police officers, and he concluded that {{there was no need to}} conduct [...] "xtended observation" [...] in this case, because [...] "allowing a drunk driver a second chance for dangerous conduct could have disastrous consequences".|$|E
