25|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} themes of the novel is the comparison between European and American women, which James stresses through the great difference existing between Eugenia and the Wentworth ladies.

The sisters spend most of their free time with the family, until the moment in which Gertrude discovers herself to <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>love</b> with Felix. Her love encourages her to take a new perspective on the world and to resist the presumptions of her family. She reacts against her father's decision regarding Mr. Brand, explaining that she will never marry a man she does not love. Instead, Gertrude will marry Felix and leave America.|$|E
