5|$|A more {{recently}} developed <b>batch</b> <b>production</b> method, the FFC Cambridge process, consumes titanium dioxide powder (a refined form of rutile) as feedstock and produces titanium metal, either powder or sponge. The process involves fewer steps than the Kroll process and takes less time. If mixed oxide powders are used, {{the product is}} an alloy.|$|E
5|$|Titanium powder is {{manufactured}} using a {{flow production}} {{process known as}} the Armstrong process {{that is similar to}} the <b>batch</b> <b>production</b> Hunter process. A stream of titanium tetrachloride gas is added to a stream of molten sodium metal; the products (sodium chloride salt and titanium particles) is filtered from the extra sodium. Titanium is then separated from the salt by water washing. Both sodium and chlorine are recycled to produce and process more titanium tetrachloride.|$|E
5|$|Because it {{cannot be}} readily {{produced}} {{by reduction of}} its dioxide, titanium metal is obtained by reduction of TiCl4 with magnesium metal in the Kroll process. The complexity of this <b>batch</b> <b>production</b> in the Kroll process explains the relatively high market value of titanium, despite the Kroll process being less expensive than the Hunter process. To produce the TiCl4 required by the Kroll process, the dioxide is subjected to carbothermic reduction {{in the presence of}} chlorine. In this process, the chlorine gas is passed over a red-hot mixture of rutile or ilmenite in the presence of carbon. After extensive purification by fractional distillation, the TiCl4 is reduced with 800°C molten magnesium in an argon atmosphere. Titanium metal can be further purified by the van Arkel–de Boer process, which involves thermal decomposition of titanium tetraiodide.|$|E

40|$|The {{progression}} of industry, toward mass personalisation, initiates added complexities {{to the quality}} control and part inspection processes. Mass produced custom parts require varying, and sometimes unique inspection routines, with only certain features of a part requiring inspection. Inspection of these parts must occur at a higher frequency than <b>batched</b> <b>production.</b> This leads {{to an increase in}} the inspection time involved. There is a need for current inspection processes to undergo cost-effective modifications to facilitate flexible inspection of custom parts, whilst maintaining <b>batched</b> <b>production</b> rates. This paper details the modification of an existing Automated Visual Inspection System (AVIS), using Mechatronic Engineering as a design tool, to become more applicable and suited to a Reconfigurable Manufacturing Environment (RME). The AVIS was a constituent of a Computer Integrated Manufacturing (CIM) cell. The modified apparatus was able to perform part inspection at a faster rate than was achieved by the previous design. ...|$|R

5|$|Small <b>batch</b> <b>production</b> of the single-seat, {{single-engine}} JF-17s {{began in}} China in June 2006.

They {{took part in}} an aerial display on 23 March 2007 {{as part of the}} Pakistan Day Joint Services Parade in Islamabad. Another six small-batch-produced aircraft were delivered by March 2008. These were extensively flight-tested and evaluated by the PAF. Two serial production aircraft were delivered from China in 2009 and the first Pakistani-manufactured aircraft was delivered to the PAF in a ceremony on 23 November 2009.|$|E
5|$|The company {{worked on}} tight profit margins {{immediately}} post-war. A {{combination of a}} shortage of skilled labour, outdated <b>batch</b> <b>production</b> methods and increasing costs in materials and payroll were matched by rising overhead, a shortage of materials and issues of absenteeism. The result was that despite a booming order book Redman was struggling to fulfil its commitments to customers, and gross margins on lathes were as low as 2.16%. The company {{was by no means}} unique in facing these difficulties but there was much urging, agonising and recriminating, by Gabriel and A K McKay, the Redman managing director since at least 1936, regarding {{how to deal with the}} issues. Some of this, perhaps inevitably as the war-time command economy reverted, was aimed at the government.|$|E

The Fauvette was available in both flyaway form or as a kit. Some were in private hands by 1959: for example, on 12 June 1959 Tony Goodhart set a new British National Distance record of 617km (343mi) in his Fauvette, the 5th, preproduction, aircraft.

2500|$|All single malt {{goes through}} a similar <b>batch</b> <b>production</b> process, as {{outlined}} below. There are several types of single malts available from distilleries including single barrel single malts which {{are the product of}} a single batch that was stored for three or more years in a single oak barrel. [...] These single barrel variants afford the opportunity for the consumer to see the influence of different types of storage on the same whisky (e.g., first use bourbon whiskey barrels, port pipes, etc.). [...] The more common form of Single Malt is a marrying at bottling time of various batches that are mixed or vatted to achieve consistent flavours from one bottling run to the next.|$|E
50|$|<b>Batch</b> <b>production</b> is {{the method}} used to produce or process any product in groups or batches where the {{products}} in the batch go through the whole production process together. An example would be when a bakery produces each different type of bread separately and each product(in this case, bread) is not produced continuously. <b>Batch</b> <b>production</b> is used {{in many different ways}} and is most suited to when {{there is a need for}} a quality/quantity balance. This technique is probably the most commonly used method for organizing manufacture and promotes specialist labor, as very often <b>batch</b> <b>production</b> involves a small number of persons. <b>Batch</b> <b>production</b> occurs when many similar items are produced together. Each batch goes through one stage of the production before moving onto next stage.|$|E
