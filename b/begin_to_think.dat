5|$|The Jain texts further {{illustrate}} {{the effects of}} leśyās on the mental dispositions of a soul, using {{an example of the}} reactions of six travellers on seeing a fruit-bearing tree. They see a tree laden with fruit and <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of getting those fruits: one of them suggests uprooting the entire tree and eating the fruit; the second one suggests cutting the trunk of the tree; the third one suggests simply cutting the branches; the fourth one suggests cutting the twigs and sparing the branches and the tree; the fifth one suggests plucking only the fruits; the sixth one suggests picking up only the fruits that have fallen down. The thoughts, words and bodily activities of each of these six travellers are different based on their mental dispositions and are respectively illustrative of the six leśyās. At one extreme, the person with the black leśyā, having evil disposition, thinks of uprooting the whole tree even though he wants to eat only one fruit. At the other extreme, the person with the white leśyā, having a pure disposition, thinks of picking up the fallen fruit, in order to spare the tree.|$|E
25|$|Abstraction (or modularity) – Types enable programmers {{to think}} {{at a higher}} level than the bit or byte, not bothering with {{low-level}} implementation. For example, programmers can <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of a string as a set of character values instead of as a mere array of bytes. Higher still, types enable programmers to think about and express interfaces between two of any-sized subsystems. This enables more levels of localization so that the definitions required for interoperability of the subsystems remain consistent when those two subsystems communicate.|$|E
25|$|During sleep, {{a person}} is in an altered state of mind. Aristotle compares a {{sleeping}} person {{to a person who}} is overtaken by strong feelings toward a stimulus. For example, a person who has a strong infatuation with someone may <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> they see that person everywhere because they are so overtaken by their feelings. When {{a person is}} asleep, their senses are not acting as they do when they are awake and this results in them thinking like a person who is influenced by strong feelings. Since a person sleeping is in this suggestible state, they become easily deceived by what appears in their dreams.|$|E

However, after a course of events he <b>begins</b> <b>to</b> change. By the end he is finally ready to accept who he is. He is no longer Zits, misfit boy, he is Michael. And now he finally has a real family."But I'm <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> I've been given a chance. I'm <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> I might get unlonely.

25|$|Isaac became {{blind in}} his old age and decided to bestow {{the blessing of the}} firstborn upon Esau. According to the Midrash, Isaac had reached the age of 132, five years past the age his mother, Sarah, had been at her death. According to Genesis, Isaac had reached the age of 137. At this time, the Sages state that one should <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> he might not exceed the age of {{whichever}} parent died first. Isaac therefore sent Esau out to the fields to trap and cook a piece of savory game for him, so that he could eat it and bless Esau before he died.|$|E
25|$|The Jain texts further {{describe}} the mental dispositions of a soul {{on account of}} leśyās with {{an example of the}} reactions of six persons who are travelers, on seeing a fruit-bearing tree. They see a tree laden with fruits and <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of getting those fruits: one of them suggests uprooting the entire tree and eating the fruits; the second one suggests cutting the trunk of the tree; the third one suggests cutting the branches only; the fourth one suggests cutting the twigs; the fifth one suggests plucking the fruits only; the sixth one suggests picking up only the fruits that have fallen down. The thoughts, words and bodily activities of each of these six travellers are different based on their mental dispositions and are respectively illustrative of the six leśyās. The person with the black leśyā, having evil disposition, thinks of uprooting the whole tree even though he wants to eat only one fruit. The person proposing to cut the tree trunk has blue leśyā, the one suggesting cutting branches has grey leśyā, the person suggesting cutting twigs has red lesya and the person thinking of simply plucking the fruits has yellow leśyā. On the other hand, the person with the white leśyā, having pure disposition, thinks only of picking up fruits fallen on the ground sparing the tree.|$|E
500|$|Looking into Grable's death, {{the agents}} {{find that it}} was he who had hired Roland. They <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> that Grable faked his death and is killing his former colleagues, using Roland as a patsy. Grable's body was never brought to the morgue, nor was a funeral ever held. However, Nollette brings the agents to a neuropreservation {{facility}} where Grable's remains are being stored. When a photo of Grable is found, the agents discover that he is Roland's identical twin brother. Speaking to Roland again, Mulder becomes convinced that the janitor is being periodically controlled by Grable.|$|E

500|$|On July 1, 1951, Feller {{recorded}} his third career no-hitter against the Detroit Tigers. [...] "I was depending on my slider and I didn't <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of a no-hitter until about the seventh inning. I {{tried to keep}} it {{in the back of my}} mind, bearing down and concentrating on one hitter at a time", Feller said. Feller was the third pitcher, after Larry Corcoran and Cy Young, to record three career no-hitters. He became the first pitcher of the 1951 season to reach 20 wins after he pitched a shutout against the Washington Senators on August 21. Along with Early Wynn and Mike Garcia, Feller reached the 20-win mark during the season; they were the first trio of pitchers on the same staff to earn 20 wins since 1931. Feller was named the Sporting News Pitcher of the Year.|$|E
500|$|Zaion: I Wish You Were Here had a mixed reception. Patrick king of Anime Fringe wrote, [...] "On the surface, it {{may appear}} to be merely another sci-fi mecha action show. However, Zaion {{introduced}} apocalyptic themes similar to those found in Michael Crichton's novel Andromeda Strain and the film 28 Days Later". According to King, the real story of Zaion occurs when Yuuji and Ai develop their relationship, and [...] "we <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> less of the nanomachine technology and viral invasion of the planet and focus more upon the potential love between these two lonely people, trapped in a labyrinth devoid of an exit". The series was produced with high audio and visual qualities, and was designed with [...] "plausible technical details". King also praised the fitting soundtrack, which was composed by Kenji Kawai and incorporated the sounds of progressive rock.|$|E
500|$|The Industrial Records website {{explains}} that the musicians wanted to re-invent rock music, and that their uncensored records were about {{their relationship with the}} world. They go on to say that they wanted their music to be an awakening for listeners so that they would <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> for themselves and question the world around them. [...] Industrial Records intended the term industrial to evoke the idea of music created for a new generation, with previous music being more agricultural: P-Orridge stated that [...] "there's an irony in the word 'industrial' because there's the music industry. And then there's the joke we often used to make in interviews about churning out our records like motorcars —that sense of industrial. And ... up till then the music had been kind of based on the blues and slavery, and we thought it was time to update it to at least Victorian times—you know, the Industrial Revolution".|$|E

500|$|In the UK, BBC DJ John Peel called [...] "Ding Dong" [...] "repetitive and dull" [...] {{and accused}} Harrison of complacency, while the NMEs Bob Woffinden derided Dark Horse as [...] "Just stuff and nonsense", adding: [...] "You keep looking for saving graces, for words of enthusiasm {{to pass on}} – 'Ding Dong', you <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> <b>think,</b> for all its inane lyrics, has some spirit, {{but it really is}} very slight." [...] Harrison's {{standing}} there was not helped by the presence of [...] "I Don't Care Anymore" [...] on the B-side, due to its casual delivery and the literal message in the song title. In a more favourable review, for Melody Maker, Chris Irwin wrote of the single: [...] "We’ve come to expect something with more substance than this glorified nursery rhyme from {{one of the most important}} musicians of the decade. True, it’s catchy with a full chunky sound to bounce it along, but with an undeniable infectiousness of the sort normally associated with chicken pox or measles ... Curiously, records of such banality have a habit of selling in their zillions and this is bound to be a biggie. Hit." ...|$|E

2500|$|Richard Schickel of TIME {{magazine}} said [...] "when a {{movie is}} as entertaining as this one, you <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> this formerly beloved genre is {{due for a}} revival." [...] Schickel said the 1957 film [...] "was, in my opinion, {{not as good as}} a lot of people thought" [...] and said Crowe [...] "never settles for predictability when he's on screen and never lets us settle into complacency as we watch him." [...] Schickel wrote that director Mangold [...] "never loses his crispness or his narrative efficiency." [...] Schickel said the comparisons to Unforgiven [...] "are not entirely apt", saying that [...] "Mangold's offering lacks the blackness and absurdity" [...] of that film. [...] He wrote, [...] "It is more in the vein of Anthony Mann's westerns of the 1950s — trim, efficiently paced, full of briskly stated conflicts that edge up to the dark side, but never fully embrace it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Embracing {{the symbols}} of the British {{presence}} in the American colonies, such as the monarchy, the episcopate, and even {{the language of the}} Book of Common Prayer, the Church of England almost drove itself to extinction during the upheaval of the American Revolution. [...] Anglicans leaders realized, in the words of William Smith's 1762 report to the Bishop of London that, [...] "The Church is the firmest Basis of Monarchy and the English Constitution." [...] The danger he saw was that if dissenters of [...] "more Republican ... Principles [...] little affinity to the established Religion and manners" [...] of England ever gained the upper hand, the colonists might <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of [...] "Independency and separate Government". Thus [...] "in a Political as well as religious view", Smith stated emphatically, the church should be strengthened by an American bishop and the appointment of [...] "prudent Governors who are friends of our Establishment". However, republicanism was rapidly gaining strength and opposition to an Anglican bishop in America was fierce.|$|E
2500|$|The USA {{considers}} {{support from}} India – {{which is on}} 35-member board of Governors at the International Atomic Energy Agency – crucial in getting a sizeable majority for its proposal to refer the matter to the Security Council for positive punitive action against Iran. Greg Schulte, US ambassador to the IAEA, said [...] "India's voice will carry particular weight...I hope India joins us in making clear our collective concerns about Iran's nuclear programme". Schulte did not deny that the Indo-US nuclear deal was conditional to India supporting the US on the Iran issue. Appraising of the situation vis-a-vis Iran, a senior US official told the New York Times that The Indians are emerging from their non-aligned status and becoming a global power, {{and they have to}} <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> about their responsibilities. They have to make a basic choice.. The Bush administration, however, recognised India's close relations with Iran and tempered its position, stating that India can [...] "go ahead with a pipeline deal involving Iran and Pakistan. Our beef with Iran is not the pipeline." ...|$|E

2500|$|Fox Atomic {{stated in}} June 2007 {{that they would}} {{consider}} producing a third film if DVD sales of the film did well. In July 2007, while promoting Sunshine, Boyle {{said he had a}} possible story for the next film. [...] "There is an idea for the next one, something which would move the story on. I've got to think about it, whether it's right or not." [...] In October 2010, when Alex Garland was asked what was happening with 28 Months Later, he declared: [...] "I'll answer that completely honestly. When we made 28 Days Later, the rights were frozen between {{a group of people who}} are no longer talking to each other. And so, the film is never going to happen unless those people start talking to each other again. There is no script as far as I'm aware." [...] In January 2011, Danny Boyle said, [...] "There is a good idea for it, and once I've got [...] Frankenstein open, I'll <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> about it a bit more." ...|$|E
2500|$|Yearwood {{has found}} major {{influences}} {{in a variety}} of musical artists. She grew accustomed to influence from Southern rock bands, which include The Allman Brothers, Eagles, as well as country rock artists such as Emmylou Harris, Elvis Presley, and James Taylor. Yearwood stated that her primary musical influence is Linda Ronstadt, whom Yearwood had often been identified and compared within her albums. Yearwood says, [...] "She had a power and an emotion in her voice that made you believe every word she sang. My favorite song was probably 'Love Has No Pride,' but I listened to everything over and over. I knew the albums so well I knew which song it was from the first note." [...] She had recorded some of Ronstadt's compositions, including [...] "Try Me Again" [...] for her 2000 album, Real Live Woman. Yearwood said that she has never considered herself as a songwriter, but is precise about choosing songs that she can relate to. She stated, [...] "I always select music based on emotion, how it makes me feel, even before I made records. My producer, Garth Fundis, and I have to catch ourselves if we <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> about recording a song we don't believe in just because we think it might be a hit." [...] She also stated that even though she does not record any of her own material, she has written music that still has yet to be recorded.|$|E
2500|$|Lynsey {{decides to}} {{temporarily}} leave the village. Hassan revealed Cheryl's brother, Brendan Brady (Emmett J.

The actress said that this leaves Lynsey to fight her own battles, teasing that the situation gets [...] "even worse before it gets better". Lynsey discovers Texas has been speaking to a girl online. Hassan explained that when Texas is telling Lynsey about the girl she realise that the correspondent is actually Silas who is planning to hurt Texas. Lynsey arranges to meet the correspondent in the woods, planning to take journalist Nancy Hayton (Jessica Fox) with her. However, Nancy does not plan to turn up following Silas' intervention. Hassan explained that Lynsey is unaware Nancy is not coming until [...] "the penny drops that she's all alone in the woods with Silas, she's absolutely terrified". Lynsey goes missing, with the actress explaining that nobody knows where her character is. Hassan explained that Brendan finds a note which he believes is from Lynsey telling him to meet her in the woods and because he is already suspicious of Silas he come to rescue Lynsey. Brendan arrives at the woods and discovers the body of Rae Wilson (Alice Barlow) in his car before the police arrive and arrest Brendan. Lynsey soon after returns home.|$|E
