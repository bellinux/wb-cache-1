25|$|In Confucianism, God has {{not created}} man {{in order to}} neglect him, but is always with man, and sustains the order of nature and human society, by {{teaching}} rulers how to <b>be</b> <b>good</b> <b>to</b> secure the peace of countries. The theistic idea of early Confucianism gave later way to a depersonalisation of Heaven, identifying him as the pattern discernible in the unfolding of nature and his will (Tianming) as peoples' consensus, culminating in the Mencius and the Xunzi.|$|E
25|$|Kritiks: The {{negative}} {{can claim}} that the affirmative is guilty of a certain mindset or assumption that should be grounds for rejection or a different mutually exclusive alternative to the Affirmatives plan. Kritiks are sometimes a reason to reject the entire affirmative advocacy without evaluating its policy; other times, kritiks can be evaluated within the same framework for evaluation as the affirmative case. Examples of some areas of literature for kritiks include biopower, racism, centralized government, and anthropocentrism. Kritiks arose in the early 1990s, with the first kritiks based in deconstructionist philosophy about the intrinsic ambiguity of language and were championed by debaters Shane Stafford and Bill Shanahan. Kritiks today have evolved to sometimes include the affirmative advocacy within their alternatives. These kritiks argue that the ontological or epistemological assumptions behind the affirmative are flawed {{and ought to be}} rejected, but the plan itself is fine. For example, an affirmative could argue that it would <b>be</b> <b>good</b> <b>to</b> reduce our nuclear stockpile to avoid global proliferation out of fear of rogue states acquiring nuclear weapons. The negative could respond with an aff-inclusive kritik that argues that it would <b>be</b> <b>good</b> <b>to</b> reduce our nuclear stockpile because nuclear weapons are unethical, but that we ought not conceptualize other states as fundamentally dangerous.|$|E

The band was conceived in 1998, when Chiwaki mentioned to Chara {{that she thought}} it would <b>be</b> <b>good</b> <b>to</b> start up a girls' rock band. One of the tenets of the band was that all members would have to do something they'd never tried before, landing Chara on drums.

25|$|The {{threadfin}} jack is of some {{importance to}} fisheries throughout its range, although individual catch {{statistics for the}} species are not kept. It is often caught by hook-and-line methods or by gill nets and various artisanal traps. It is considered to <b>be</b> <b>good</b> <b>to</b> excellent table fare, and is marketed both fresh and salted. The species has also been found {{at a number of}} archaeological sites in both Panama and Ecuador, indicating it has been caught by humans for food for at least 3450 years. The threadfin jack is also of interest to anglers who catch the species occasionally, and is considered a minor gamefish. Juveniles are occasionally caught from shore, such as piers and breakwaters, while larger individuals are caught over deeper reefs. The species takes a variety of bait, including fish and prawns, but they also take lures, including hard and small, fly-like Sabiki lures.|$|E

Cobain sang progressively [...] "harder" [...] during the recording of the song, which made it difficult for Vig to balance the volume levels between the verses and choruses. Vig recalled that he had to change the input level [...] "on the fly" [...] and hoped that Cobain would not [...] "change the phrasing or do something different" [...] while recording.|$|E

John Levi Martin refers to this [...] "golden age of methodological unity and theoretical calm" [...] as the Pax Wisconsana, as it reflected the composition of the sociology department at the University of Wisconsin–Madison: numerous scholars working on separate projects with little contention. Omar Lizardo describes the Pax Wisconsana as: [...] "a Midwestern flavored, Mertonian resolution of the theory/method wars in which [...] all agreed on at least two working hypotheses: (1) grand theory' is a waste of time; (2) [...] good theory has to <b>be</b> <b>good</b> <b>to</b> think with or goes in the trash bin." [...] Despite the aversion to grand theory in the later half of the 20th century, several new traditions have emerged that propose various syntheses: structuralism, post-structuralism, cultural sociology and systems theory.|$|E
500|$|In {{the time}} after Morning Phases release and general {{critical}} success, Beck {{mentioned that he}} had been working on another album at around the same time, but that the new album would be more of a pop record. Shortly after Morning Phases Grammy wins, on June 15, 2015, Beck released the first single titled [...] "Dreams" [...] off this upcoming thirteenth studio album. [...] "I was really trying to make something that would <b>be</b> <b>good</b> <b>to</b> play live," [...] he said shortly after its release.

In September 2016, the album was delayed with no new release date announced and, on September 24, Beck said he didn't know [...] "when it’s coming out. It’s probably in a few months."

500|$|... "What Have You Done for Me Lately" [...] is {{regarded}} as one of the singer's singles which helped establish her as a known artist. Upon its debut, it was compared favorably to similar recordings of female empowerment released by black women, such as [...] "New Attitude" [...] by Patti LaBelle, [...] "Better <b>Be</b> <b>Good</b> <b>to</b> Me" [...] by Tina Turner and [...] "Sisters Are Doin' It for Themselves" [...] by Aretha Franklin. Oprah Winfrey commented: [...] "What you're seeing in all the areas of arts and entertainment is black women internalizing the idea of black power and pride... Black women started listening to their inner cues, rather than society or even the black community's idea of what they are supposed to be and can be." [...] It ranked number three hundred and forty-one on Blenders list of [...] "The 500 Greatest Songs Since You Were Born".

Slayer members {{wanted to keep the}} use of computer effects to a minimum, only to include a small amount of delay and distortion. As with previous recordings, the drum tracks were recorded first. Drummer Paul Bostaph follows a simple rule suggested by Rubin when in the studio: [...] "The perfect take is the one that felt like it was going to fall apart but never did." [...] Seven-string guitars were used on the tracks [...] "Scarstruck" [...] and [...] "Here Comes the Pain," [...] the first time Slayer had done so. King was at the B.C. Rich guitar company (manufacturer of his signature model, the KKV) and decided to borrow a seven string guitar. After writing one song, King ordered a seven string as he thought [...] "there's no point having one tuning for just one song," [...] so he wrote another, going on to comment [...] "you don't have to <b>be</b> <b>good</b> <b>to</b> make up a seven-string riff." [...] The album features two songs on seven string guitars, four songs with guitars tuned to Drop-B and all other songs in C# Standard.|$|E
500|$|After meeting U2 in 1987, Steinberg {{stayed in}} touch with Bono and when the group was putting the Zoo TV Tour {{together}} in 1992, the lead singer thought it would <b>be</b> <b>good</b> <b>to</b> have a choreographer to critique his moves on stage. Steinberg worked during the tour's pre-production to show the group how to communicate their ideas {{all the way to}} the last rows of a venue. Recognizing Bono was not a dancer, she focused on movements he could do, and sought to help him pace himself and not get lost visually in the show's enormous stage set. The group's hit [...] "Mysterious Ways" [...] had featured a belly dancer in its music video, and the group decided to incorporate one in their on-stage performance of the song. The original dancer left when the tour moved to its outdoor stadium legs. According to Steinberg, having a belly dancer on the tour originated as [...] "a bit of a joke". Steinberg began by training the dancer, and when that dancer left the tour, a replacement was needed. Bono asked Steinberg if she would like to take over and she agreed, although she had never belly danced before and by her own description did not have the voluptuous body usually associated with the form.|$|E

[...] He barked, [...] "This fellow would have a preacher in every parish church!" [...] to which Marbury replied, [...] "so would St. Paul." [...] Then Aylmer asked, [...] "But where is the living for them?" [...] To this Marbury answered, [...] "A man might cut a large thong out of your hide, and that of the other prelates, and it would never be missed." [...] Having lost his patience, the bishop retorted, [...] "Thou are an overthwart, proud, puritan knave." [...] Marbury answered, [...] "I am no puritan. [...] I beseech you to <b>be</b> <b>good</b> <b>to</b> me. [...] I have been twice in prison already, but I know not why. [...] To this, Aylmer was unsympathetic, and he rendered the sentence, [...] "Have him to the Marshalsea. [...] There he shall cope with the papists." [...] Marbury then actually threatened divine retribution upon the bishop by warning him to beware the judgements of God. [...] His daughter Anne would make a similar threat towards the magistrates and ministers at her civil trial before the Massachusetts Court, nearly 60 years later.|$|E
