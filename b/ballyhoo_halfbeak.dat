5000|$|The <b>Ballyhoo</b> <b>halfbeak</b> or Ballyhoo, (Hemiramphus brasiliensis), is a baitfish of the halfbeak family (Hemiramphidae). It {{is similar}} to the Balao halfbeak in most features. Ballyhoo are {{frequently}} used as cut bait and for trolling purposes by saltwater sportsmen,. The fish is known to have reports of ciguatera poisoning to humans [...]|$|E
40|$|Two {{species of}} <b>halfbeaks,</b> <b>ballyhoo,</b> Hemiramphus brasiliensis, and balao, H. balao, {{form the basis}} of a {{relatively}} small but valuable bait fishery in southeastern Florida. Halfbeak landings increased rapidly in the late 1960 's but are now relatively stable (about 450, 000 kg or 1 million lb annually), and their ex-vessel price is about $ 600, 000. Fishing methods, which had changed in the late 1960 's when landings increased, have changed little since the 1970 's. Data from a fishery-dependent survey (1988 - 91) show that catch rates were highest from October to February, when catches were dominated by large ballyhoo (> 200 mm or 8 inches fork length (FL)); rates were lowest from May to September, when catches contained both species in more equal numbers and the size range was greater (about 150 - 250 mm FL) than it was for winter landings. There was little bycatch, and only flyingfishes (Exocoetidae) and needlefishes (Belonidae) occurred consistently. Comparisons of the 1988 - 91 data with similar data reported from 1974 indicated that halfbeak populations have remained relatively stable...|$|R
