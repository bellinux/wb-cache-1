5|$|It is a dance-pop {{song with}} heavy, {{pounding}} synths. The song {{also has a}} fast techno <b>beat</b> <b>with</b> electroclash and Eurodisco influences. Gaga speaks the first verse {{and parts of the}} chorus of the song faux-German, as the name of the song is German. The lyrics have a feminist tone, speaking of female empowerment. The song received positive reviews from contemporary critics, who complimented its heavy dance beat and catchy chorus, despite criticizing the faux-German lyrics and Gaga's accent. The song charted on the South Korean Gaon Music Chart and US Billboard dance charts, as well as entering the component charts in Canada, Germany, and the United States.|$|E

40|$|Background Systolic {{shortening}} {{is known}} to produce mus-cle deactivation. The present {{study was designed to}} analyze whether the velocity and the timing of ejection play a role on end-systolic pressure-volume relations (ESPVR). Methods and Results In isolated rabbit hearts, left ventric-ular pressure and volume were recorded and digitized, and left ventricular volume was controlled by a servosystem (4 -milli-second cycles) to alter the timing of ejection. A significant deficit in end-systolic pressure was observed when ejection was late in systole with respect to earlier ejection. This was associated with a significantly reduced end-systolic elastance. End-systolic pressure of <b>beats</b> <b>with</b> slow ejection was interme-diate between that of the <b>beats</b> <b>with</b> early ejection and that of <b>beats</b> <b>with</b> late ejection with a significantly increased end-systolic volume compared <b>with</b> <b>beats</b> <b>with</b> early rapid ejection...|$|R

25|$|Class II Hemorrhage {{involves}} 15-30% {{of total}} blood volume. A patient is often tachycardic (rapid heart <b>beat)</b> <b>with</b> a narrowing {{of the difference}} between the systolic and diastolic blood pressures. The body attempts to compensate with peripheral vasoconstriction. Skin may start to look pale and be cool to the touch. The patient may exhibit slight changes in behavior. Volume resuscitation with crystalloids (Saline solution or Lactated Ringer's solution) is all that is typically required. Blood transfusion is not typically required.|$|E

40|$|Background: Prior {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} that during atrial fibrillation (AF), <b>beats</b> <b>with</b> equal preceding and pre-preceding R-R intervals, defined as intervals differing less than 5 %, could be used to determine the mean values instead of measuring over 20 cardiac cycles. It is not known whether <b>beats</b> <b>with</b> interval difference less than 10 % could be used in the same way. Methods: In 120 patients with AF, Doppler aortic flow time-velocity integral was determined for at least 20 consecutive cardiac cycles. The values at <b>beats</b> <b>with</b> interval difference of less than 5 % and less than 10 % were chosen. These were then compared with the measured average values over all cardiac cycles. Results: Agreement and mean percentage difference analyses revealed that the accuracy of measurements using inter-beat variability less than 10 % was similar to that using less than 5 % for 2 - and 3 -beat analyses provided the R-R intervals were longer than 500 milliseconds. The values at <b>beats</b> <b>with</b> cycle lengths shorter than 500 milliseconds were usually far below the average values. The mean percentage differences were not significantly different between methods using interval differences of less than 5 % and less than 10 % for 3 -beat analysis (2. 83 % vs. 2. 97 %, p = 0. 269). Moreover, it is relatively easy to obtain <b>beats</b> <b>with</b> interval difference less than 10 %. The median numbers of beats required finding 3 <b>beats</b> <b>with</b> inter-beat variability of less than 10 % and less than 5 % were 9 and 16, respectively. Conclusions: Averaging 3 <b>beats</b> <b>with</b> R-R interval difference less than 10 % and cycle lengths longer than 500 milliseconds can be applied to accurately estimate Doppler-derived aortic flow for patients with AF.

25|$|As {{the band}} and its sound matured over thirty years of touring, playing, and recording, each member's stylistic {{contribution}} became more defined, consistent, and identifiable. Lesh, who was originally a classically trained trumpet player with an extensive background in music theory, did not tend to play traditional blues-based bass forms, but opted for more melodic, symphonic and complex lines, often sounding like a second lead guitar. Weir, too, was not a traditional rhythm guitarist, but tended to play jazz-influenced, unique inversions at {{the upper end of}} the Dead's sound. The two drummers, Mickey Hart and Kreutzmann, developed a unique, complex interplay, balancing Kreutzmann's steady <b>beat</b> <b>with</b> Hart's interest in percussion styles outside the rock tradition. Hart incorporated an 11-count measure to his drumming, bringing a new dimension to the band's sound that became an important part of its emerging style. Garcia's lead lines were fluid, supple and spare, owing a great deal of their character to his training in fingerpicking and banjo.|$|E
25|$|Watchmen, as {{guardians of}} {{the peace of the}} streets, were {{supposed}} to deal within the confines of their <b>beat</b> <b>with</b> drunkenness, soliciting, and petty tumults, and detaining suspicious characters. However, they were often willing to concede privileges to certain prostitutes, consequently provoking parishioners' complains about their inability to enforce the law. Indeed, even the prostitutes taken up by the watch were frequently released after a few hours in the watch house without seeing any magistrate. The circumstances changed when theft or some other kind of crimes were committed. Public opinion, and Moreton too, firmly believed that these women needed to be restrained in their liberties not only for their vices and immoralities but because they represented a real threat to common living. Unfortunately, most of the times this was easier said than done. Watchmen had the power to apprehend criminals within the boundaries of their parish, and they were liable to be reprimanded for leaving their beats. So they might not have been so inclined to chase a woman who crossed into another parish in order to avoid being taken.|$|E
25|$|Rock Band 4 {{now has the}} use of Freestyle Guitar Solos, an {{optional}} feature. If this feature is disabled, guitar solos in songs are presented {{as they were in}} previous Rock Band games with more of the same note-matching aspects in <b>beat</b> <b>with</b> the original song's solo; the player scores as they normally do as during regular song sections, with an added scoring bonus based on the percentage of the solo notes hit correctly. When this feature is enabled, instead of the predefined solo, the game shows suggestions for the solo style to emulate at that time, such as single notes or longer licks, chords, or tremolos, using different patterns to highlight the guitar player's on-screen track. The track markings also indicate which set of fret keys on the instrument control to use, which determine the pitch of the notes. Players cannot fail these freestyle sections, but they are scored on how well they hit the suggested style during the segment, and they can retain their scoring multiplier by performing the proper playing style on each section of the solo. The game includes tutorials to help explain these mechanics to players. Further, the audio feedback from these solos has been refined as to make whatever the player performs stay consistent and in-tune with the other active and backing instruments.|$|E

25|$|Arachne kidnaps Mary Jane, and the Geek Chorus appears once again. They {{argue about}} who Spider-Man's true nemesis is, {{the one he}} can never <b>beat,</b> <b>with</b> some {{thinking}} it must be MJ. But Miss Arrow assures them that it is Arachne, since she is an expert of weaving illusion. Back in the story, we see that Miss Arrow is right: Arachne has trapped Peter in her giant web. MJ is suspended in a cocoon and will die unless Peter pledges to be with Arachne, to share her darkness forever ("Love Me or Kill Me*"). They fight, and eventually Peter agrees to be with Arachne if it means saving MJ. Arachne has a sudden change of heart, realizing {{that there is still}} humanity left in the curse of the spider. She finds her own humanity and spares MJ's life. Arachne spares Peter of a life with her, as she knows he will always only love MJ and will never truly be hers; but in realizing his humanity, she has found her own and is released of her burden of darkness in the shadows. Peter watches as Arachne ascends into the heavens by the same piece of thread she used to take her life. With his suit at the Daily Bugle, MJ sees Peter and finally realizes his secret. She agrees to stand by him as sirens begin wailing and Peter swings away ("Finale").|$|E

Matthew Perpetua, writing for Rolling Stone, compared its Europop sound to that of Kylie Minogue and Goldfrapp. Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine claimed it [...] "juxtaposes a driving 4/4 <b>beat</b> <b>with</b> accompanying madrigal-style vocal harmonies". while Fraser McAlpine of BBC opined that it [...] "appropriates some of the primal chanting and hollering of Tune-Yards, but brings in a big pop chorus".|$|E

500|$|The song is a midtempo R and hip hop ballad that [...] "mixes a soft <b>beat</b> <b>with</b> piano accompaniment." [...] Its lyrics {{convey a}} message of self-worth and perseverance, with Carey urging {{listeners}} to [...] "Reach for the stars/ Be all that you are." [...] The song made little impact commercially; many felt the singer was overshadowed by the hip-hop duo, and should have had more presence on her comeback single. Two accompanying versions were released alongside the original, titled the [...] "Pulse Club" [...] and [...] "Vintage Throwback" [...] remixes. Like the reception, commercial impact has been generally low. Most critics attribute this to the song's low appeal to Top 40 formats and mainstream channels.|$|E
