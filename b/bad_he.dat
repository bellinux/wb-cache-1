5|$|Mr. Mackey, {{the school}} counselor, is giving {{a drug and}} alcohol {{prevention}} lecture to the class, emphasizing that smoking, drinking, marijuana, and LSD are <b>bad.</b> <b>He</b> passes a sample of marijuana around the class so that the children can learn its smell, but it is never returned. As a result, Mackey is fired, and is later kicked out of his house, leaving him homeless. A desperate Mackey gives in to trying marijuana one night in an alley, and later, LSD. Soon enough, Mr. Mackey becomes a drug-addled hippie, and meets a female hippie, with whom he decides to get married. While on honeymoon in India, Mr. Mackey is captured and taken into rehab. Mr. Mackey emerges clean from rehab and is given his job back.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, even as {{the battle}} had {{continued}} the evacuation of the Australian casualties had begun, {{with a number of}} Iroquois helicopters from No. 9 Squadron, Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) under Squadron Leader Jim Cox, flying through heavy ground fire to complete the dust-off. Hindered by artillery fire and the dense foliage the operation proved difficult and Cox's aircraft was hit by heavy machine-gun fire, wounding him and an orderly on board. Safely landing the damaged aircraft he then directed the operation by radio from the ground. Among the worst of the casualties was Sergeant Alexander Sutherland, from 2 Platoon. Losing an eye and suffering heavy blood loss from multiple shrapnel wounds after a Viet Cong rocket exploded within a metre of him, he was evacuated to 8 Field Ambulance in Vung Tau with no pulse. His left leg later amputated, his wounds were so <b>bad</b> <b>he</b> had to be given a general anaesthetic each time his bandages were changed. Making a miraculous recovery however, he was personally recommended for the US Medal of Honor by Westmoreland for his resolute spirit, although this was later reduced to a lesser Australian award. Many casualties were beyond help however, and the battalion chaplain was inserted by winch from a helicopter to administer last rites.|$|E

Worried about the impact such details might have on his career, Presley, through his father, asked Parker to stop the {{publication}} of the book. Parker made attempts to have it stopped, but failed to do so. According to Presley's friend, Larry Geller, Parker secretly wanted the book to be published, hoping that it would open Presley's eyes to how <b>bad</b> <b>he</b> had gotten and persuade him to do something about it. The book would eventually be published in August 1977, two weeks before Presley's death.|$|E
25|$|When Hayworth and Dick Haymes first met, he {{was still}} married and his singing career was waning. When she {{showed up at the}} clubs, he got a larger audience. Haymes was desperate for money, because two of his former wives were taking legal action against him for unpaid child support. His {{financial}} problems were so <b>bad,</b> <b>he</b> could not return to California without being arrested. On July 7, 1954, his ex-wife Nora Haymes got a bench warrant for his arrest, because he owed her $3,800 in alimony. Less than a week earlier, his other ex-wife, Joanne Dru, also got a bench warrant because she said he owed $4,800 in support payments for their three children. Hayworth ended up paying most of Haymes's debts.|$|E
25|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 2007 Apertura season, Paraguayan legend José Cardozo took the helm as coach. His tenure did not last long, as Olimpia were unable to win the championship. For the Clausura tournament, former star player Alicio Solalinde was back at the helm. Though his record was not <b>bad,</b> <b>he</b> was replaced by Carlos Jara Saguier halfway through the tournament. This sparked a lot of controversy, as Saguier was a former player of Cerro Porteño, and an admitted fan of that club. Olimpia finished third in the Clausura tournament, behind Libertad and Cerro Porteño. A fourth-place finish in the global tabulation (adding both Apertura and Clausura tournaments) has allowed Olimpia to return to international play in the Copa Sudamericana of 2008 after 4 years of absence.|$|E

500|$|I'm writing {{short stories}} right now, that's what I do between novels, and I love them. I'm very devoted to it. You know, it's funny. There {{seems to be}} some sort of law that you only get to be celebrated for one or the other. And then a couple of people will break it. Updike did. They didn't review his story {{collections}} by saying, [...] "Well, these are nice, but he's a novelist." [...] Or review his novels by saying, [...] "Well, too <b>bad</b> <b>he</b> can't do the longer stuff." [...] Other people tend to get patronized on one end or the other—and I'll take it. I have a very happy life as a novelist. But the story collections I've published are tremendously important to me. And many of the uncollected stories—or yet-to-be-collected stories—are among my proudest writings. They're very closely allied, obviously, to novel writing. But also very distinct, and, you know, there's no need to choose.|$|E

500|$|Namath did {{not start}} the January 1965 Orange Bowl, as he was nursing an injured knee. He came off the bench {{in the second quarter}} with Alabama down by two touchdowns, and led his team to within a foot of victory, falling short in a run on the game's final play. Despite the loss, he was voted the game's Most Valuable Player. The {{following}} day, Namath officially signed with New York for an unprecedented contract worth $427,000 over three years. The total included bonuses yet to be earned as well as a convertible given to Namath as a signing bonus. The Jets had been aware that Namath had knee problems, but when team doctor Nicholas examined Namath in the restroom at a party held to celebrate his signing, he told the quarterback that had he known Namath's knees were that <b>bad,</b> <b>he</b> would have advised Werblin not to sign him. The Jets scheduled Namath for surgery amid considerable public interest; the media asked to photograph the operation, but were refused permission. The Jets hedged their bets by signing three other quarterbacks for a total of $400,000, including Notre Dame quarterback and Heisman Trophy winner John Huarte. There was an intense media spotlight on Namath, who became known for a playboy lifestyle; he was dubbed [...] "Broadway Joe".|$|E
500|$|The press-boxes of Kilburn's time, {{particularly}} in Yorkshire, were unfriendly and serious places. According to Wisden, [...] " [...] was a tall, austere {{man who had}} little truck with press-box banter." [...] According to writer Derek Hodgson, Kilburn was shy. However, his views and methods were regarded as old-fashioned in the later stages of his career. Kilburn was often compared to his contemporary from Lancashire, Neville Cardus, but his style was dissimilar. Cardus wrote in a romantic style whereas Kilburn preferred factual accuracy; according to Wisden, Kilburn was [...] "harder, less flashy, more punctilious". Journalist Frank Keating writes: [...] "Neville Cardus was acclaimed the Wordsworth of cricket writing, while across the Pennines they hailed Kilburn as the Coleridge. With good reason." [...] Kilburn's writings on the Yorkshire players of the 1930s and 1940s made them well-known {{to the public as}} personalities, and he wrote several pieces for the Yorkshire Post which became famous. Kilburn had a deep love of cricket, and worried it was losing its way in embracing one-day matches and sponsorship, although he did not believe that progress was necessarily <b>bad.</b> <b>He</b> believed that cricketers should be chivalrous, and greatly admired stylish play. He severely criticised anything on the field which he believed fell short of acceptable standards, including the occasion in 1967 when Yorkshire won the County Championship after engaging in time-wasting tactics to avoid losing a game. He retired in 1976, but continued to follow the sport very closely.|$|E

500|$|Writer Novak {{cites the}} episode as the [...] "most conceptually ambitious" [...] in the show's history. More {{than half the}} episode {{consisted}} of footage from the film. Originally, the producers considered showing just the movie, but they felt that it [...] "would feel like a gimmick or experiment", {{and so it was}} decided that the film would be intercut with shots of the office reacting to the film. In order to make the film seem as if Michael had created it, the film used was colorized in post-production to make it seem as if it were of a cheaper quality than the normal high-quality film that the series used. Certain shooting methods, like hand-held and zooms, were nixed, except for in cases where they could be presented in a [...] "poorly-executed" [...] manner. This was done in a way to make it appear that Michael at least knew what he was doing; Novak explained that the crew [...] "didn't want the joke of the episode to be how <b>bad</b> <b>he</b> was at filmmaking" [...] because it would [...] "be a little easy and a little out of character". To create the fake dummy of Toby that exploded, Paul Lieberstein was required to spend several hours in a full-face mold that reportedly [...] "unnerved him greatly". Two molds were taken. Both were filled with explosives, but one was filled with fake blood. Both were shot with slow-motion cameras. However, the dummy with the fake blood in it was considered [...] "too disturbing for us and arguably too disturbing for Michael", and so the tamer explosion was used.|$|E

[...] His team has a physical advantage {{and with the help of}} Mr. Widmore, they have a tactical advantage as well. [...] Keamy is like a bulldog being thrown into a cage full of kittens (except for [...] Sayid)". [...] Jay Glatfelter of The Huffington Post, stated that [...] "Keamy is Crazy! … out of all the bad guys on the Island—past, present, and future—Keamy has to be one of the most dangerous ones. [...] Not because of how big he is, or the weaponry, but his willingness to kill at the drop of a hat. [...] That doesn't bode well for our Losties [...]" [...] Co-show runner/executive producer/writer Carlton Cuse has stated that he and the other writers create [...] "complex" [...] characters because they [...] "are interested in exploring how good and evil can be embodied in the same characters and [...] the struggles we all have to overcome the dark parts of our souls"; however, he later clarified that there is an exception: [...] "Keamy's <b>bad,</b> <b>he</b> knows he's bad, but he's ... a guy that does the job." [...] Damon Lindelof stated that [...] "the great thing about Keamy is that he is like a ... merciless survivor. [...] 's this great moment [...] where he just sort of hackie-sacks [...] over to where [...] Omar is standing. [...] Omar is certainly an acceptable casualty as far as Keamy is concerned."
