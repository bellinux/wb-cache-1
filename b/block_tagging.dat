40|$|It {{is widely}} {{hoped that the}} study of {{sequence}} variation in the human genome will provide a means of elucidating the genetic component of complex diseases and variable drug responses. A major stumbling block to the successful design and execution of genome-wide disease association studies using single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and linkage disequilibrium is the enormous number of SNPs in the human genome. This results in unacceptably high costs for exhaustive genotyping and presents a challenging problem of statistical inference. Here, we present a new method for optimally selecting minimum informative subsets of SNPs, also known as “tagging ” SNPs, that is efficient for genome-wide selection. We contrast this method to published methods including haplotype <b>block</b> <b>tagging,</b> that is, grouping SNPs into segments of low haplotype diversity and typing a subset of the SNPs that can discriminate all common haplotypes within the blocks. Because our method does not rely on a predefined haplotype block structure and makes use of the weaker correlations that occur across neighboring blocks, it can be effectively applied across chromosomal regions with both high and low local linkage disequilibrium. We show that the number of tagging SNPs selected is substantially smaller than previously reported using block-based approaches and that selecting tagging SNPs optimally can result in a two- to threefold savings over selecting random SNPs.

40|$|Recent {{processors}} issue multiple instructions per {{cycle and}} employ multiple functional units and hardware scheduling techniques to achieve maximum parallelism at the instruction level. To exploit maximum efficiency such multiple issue processors must be fed by high instruction fetch bandwidth. The instruction fetch unit must fetch enough instructions every cycle {{to keep the}} functional units busy. No clock cycle should go idle and thus several instructions need to be fetched at every clock cycle. In conventional multi-way set-associative I-cache, an instruction is read in the following way. The address generated by the processor {{is divided into two}} parts- tag and index. The index selects the set of the I-cache to be accessed. The tag is compared simultaneously with the cache <b>blocks</b> <b>tags</b> of all the blocks in the set. The data is read from the <b>block</b> whose <b>tag</b> matches with the instruction tag. If none of the stored tags matches with the instruction tag, then a cache miss occurs and the instruction is read from the other levels of the memory hierarchy. With very fast clock cycles, this whole procedure requires more than one clock cycle to complete. It is expected that the future processors, which are likely to have a very deep pipeline, will require several pipeline stages to fetch instructions. The two main factors that affect the performance of a multi-issue processor are: cache access time and fetching correct instructions every cycle. In this paper we will address both these problems by predicting the address of the Instruction cache from where the next instruction has to be fetched. 1...|$|R

A small fraction of SNPs (tag SNPs) is sufficient to capture most of the haplotype structure of the human genome. In this paper, we develop a method to partition haplotypes into blocks and to identify tag SNPs based on genotype data by combining a dynamic programming algorithm for haplotype <b>block</b> partitioning and <b>tag</b> SNP selection based on haplotype data with {{a variation of the}} expectation maximization (EM) algorithm for haplotype inference. We assess the effects of using either haplotype or genotype data in haplotype <b>block</b> identification and <b>tag</b> SNP selection as a function of several factors, including sample size, density or number of SNPs studied, allele frequencies, fraction of missing data, and genotyping error rate, using extensive simulations.

The power of association studies based on tag SNPs using genotype data is similar to that using haplotype data.

Several methods were proposed for haplotype block partitioning and for tagging single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) identification. In population genetics studies, several research groups compared block structures across human populations. However, the measures used to quantify population similarity are either less than satisfactory or nonexistent. In this article, we propose several similarity measures to facilitate the comparisons of haplotype structures, namely <b>block</b> boundaries and <b>tagging</b> SNPs, across populations. With these measures, we can more objectively compare haplotype <b>block</b> structures and <b>tagging</b> SNP sets between different populations. In addition, these measures allow us to compare the results of different methods for <b>block</b> partition and <b>tagging</b> SNP identification. When we applied these measures to a real data set on chromosome 10 in 16 worldwide populations, we found that in this genome region: 1) haplotype block boundaries vary among populations, with European and some African populations showing similar boundaries but other populations showing other patterns; 2) tagging SNP sets are generally similar for populations with similar haplotype block structures but differ if the block structures differ; and 3) {{all but one of}} the block finding methods we tested yield consistent results, although variations exist regarding consistency.

In this paper we, therefore, propose a cache organization called the Unified Dual Data Cache that employs only one (unified) cache unit. If a cache miss occurs and the locality prediction is temporal, only the missing block is fetched from the next memory level. If on the other hand spatial locality is predicted, adjacent blocks are also brought to the cache.

In cloud, shared resources, softwares and information is provided as a metered service over the network. By data outsourcing, users can be relieved from the burden of local data storage and maintenance. However, the fact that users no longer have physical possession of the possibly large size of outsourced data makes the data integrity protection in Cloud Computing a very challenging and potentially formidable task, especially for users with constrained computing resources and capabilities. Thus, enabling public auditability for cloud data storage security is of critical importance so that users can resort to an external audit party to check the integrity of outsourced data when needed.

40|$|The {{performance}} of a cache of a given size depends significantly on the cache block size. Previous {{studies have shown that}} insufficient memory bandwidth, rather than raw memory latencies, will be the major obstacle to improving system performance. The cache block size has a large and varying impact on memory traffic and hit rate across programs, suggesting the need for variable block size caches. We propose sub-tagged caches, which extend sub-blocked caches by breaking up the address tag into a common <b>block</b> <b>tag</b> shared by all sub-blocks and a sub-tag unique to the specific sub-block. Sub-tagged caches allow words from different memory blocks to co-reside in a cache block, without changing the critical hit access path, and thus emulate variable address block sizes. Typically only a few address tag bits differ between the blocks involved in a cache conflict, thus motivating sub-tagged caches. Performance evaluation with SPEC 2000 benchmarks shows that the miss ratio and memory traffic ratio of a column-associative sub-tagged cache is comparable to that of a four-way set-associative sub-blocked cache, while its average memory access time is 18 % better on average. Dynamic sub-block prefetching in conjunction with a sub-tagged cache emulates variable address and fetch block sizes. A comparative study of different variable block caches shows that while no single cache organization is best across all benchmarks, variable block size caches outperform fixed block size caches for seven of the twelve benchmarks.

30|$|Verification schemes {{based on}} {{remotely}} stored data. Deswarte Y. et al. [5] first proposed two data integrity verification schemes for remotely stored data. One is to preprocess the files which {{are going to}} be verified with hash, and then, multiple challenge-response modes are mainly applied in the verification process. This scheme needs to store a large amount of checksum in order to prevent replay attacks of malicious servers. The other is based on the Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol. But with the amount of data increasing, the cost of the server’s calculation will grow at exponential rates. In 2007, Ateniese et al. [3] proposed PDP, and they applied homomorphic verifiable tag in this scheme. Users generate a tag for each data block, servers then store these data <b>blocks</b> and <b>tags.</b> When users ask for data verification, servers generate the proofs for pairs of data <b>blocks</b> and <b>tags</b> that needed to be verified according to challenge information. Users can verify the data integrity by verifying the proofs returned from servers without getting the data back. In 2008, Ateniese et al. [6] improved their scheme by adding symmetric key. They proposed a dynamic provable data possession protocol based on cryptographic hash function and symmetric key encryption. A certain number of metadata need to be calculated in advance during the initialization phase, so that the number of updates and challenges is limited and fixed. Each update operation needs to recreate the existing metadata which is not applicable to large files. Moreover, their protocol only allows append-type insertions. Erway et al.

Recent work shows that genotype data from the International HapMap Project have a high degree of transferability to the wider population. This implies that the design of genotyping studies on local populations may be facilitated through inferences drawn from information contained in HapMap populations. Results To facilitate analysis of HapMap data for characterizing the haplotype structure of genes or any chromosomal regions, we have developed an integrated web-based resource, iHAP. In addition to incorporating genotype and haplotype data from the International HapMap Project and gene information from the UCSC Genome Browser Database, iHAP also provides capabilities for inferring haplotype <b>blocks</b> and selecting <b>tag</b> SNPs that are representative of haplotype patterns. These include block partitioning algorithms, <b>block</b> definitions, <b>tag</b> SNP definitions, as well as SNPs to be "force included" as tags.

To facilitate analysis, intermediate and final result files can be downloaded.

Cloud Computing has been moves the application software and databases to the centralized large data centers, where the management of the data and services may not be fully trustworthy. This brings the problem of ensuring the integrity of data storage in Cloud. Cloud computing share distributed resources via network in the open environment thus it makes security problem. we consider the task of allowing a third party auditor (TPA), on behalf of the cloud client, to verify the integrity of the dynamic data stored in the cloud. The introduction of TPA eliminates the involvement of the client through the auditing of whether his data stored in the cloud are indeed intact, which can be important in achieving economies of scale for Cloud Computing. The support for data dynamics via the most general forms of data operation, such as block modification, insertion, and deletion, is also a significant step toward practicality, since services in Cloud Computing are not limited to archive or backup data only. While prior works on ensuring remote data integrity often lacks the support of either public auditability or dynamic data operations, this paper achieves both. We first identify the difficulties and potential security problems of direct extensions with fully dynamic data updates from prior works and then show how to construct an elegant verification scheme for the seamless integration of these two salient features in our protocol design. In particular, to achieve efficient data dynamics, we improve the existing proof of storage models by manipulating the classic Merkle Hash Tree construction for <b>block</b> <b>tag</b> authentication.
