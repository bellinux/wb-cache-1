5|$|After 1939 {{the firm}} <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> forced labour {{extensively}} on its projects, as did many other German industrial concerns at the time. Hochtief's slave workers suffered from malnutrition, beating and constant abuse. The consortium-led nature of construction projects obscures the firm's exact involvement, {{as does the}} destruction of many records.|$|E

In 2008, the park <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> the herbicides glyphosate and aminopyralid to augment manual methods {{to manage the}} most threatening plants.|$|E
5|$|Ivan Sratsimir was proclaimed emperor in Vidin in 1356 and <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> {{the title}} Emperor of Bulgarians and Greeks, as his father. In {{order to secure}} the {{alliance}} of Wallachia, he married his first cousin Anna, {{the daughter of the}} Wallachian voivode Nicholas Alexander, in 1356 or 1357, a move that was probably arranged with the help of Ivan Sratsimir's mother Theodora as a reaction to the actions of Ivan Alexander.|$|E

5|$|New Labour {{also used}} the party's brand to {{continue}} this modernisation, and {{it was used to}} communicate the modernisation of the party to the public; the party also <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> focus groups to test whether their policy ideas were attractive to swing voters. Its purpose was to reassure the public that the party would provide a new kind of governance and mitigate fears that a Labour government would return to the labour unrest that had characterised its past.|$|E

5|$|After the American Civil War, {{returning}} residents {{found that}} their slaves, livestock and farm equipment had been taken. Most residents relocated. However, in the early 20th century, farmers returned {{and the town of}} Green Lake modestly grew to an approximate population of 300 in 1914. At the time, much of the land in the vicinity was used for livestock grazing. The only profitable commercial uses for the lake itself included transportation of lumber and fishing. Approximately US$100,000 worth of fish were caught in the lake from 1900 to 1915. Nevertheless, the lake bed remained dry for extended periods and vegetation covered certain areas. Local residents soon <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> the bed to grow cotton.|$|E
5|$|Ashby de la Zouch was {{converted}} into a castle by William, Lord Hastings, a favourite of Edward IV; as a minor nobleman he had fought alongside Edward at Towton, but was then knighted and later became the chamberlain of the royal household and the Lieutenant of Calais. William acquired extensive estates across the Midlands during the wars, much of them confiscated from his enemies. Amongst these was Ashby de la Zouch, which was given to William in 1462. His father, Sir Leonard, had maintained the family seat at nearby Kirby Muxloe, but after 1471 William <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> Ashby de la Zouch as his primary residence.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} the 16th century, the House of Lords <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> {{the tower}} to store its {{parliamentary}} records, building a house alongside it {{for the use of the}} parliamentary clerk, and extensive improvements followed in 1621. The tower continued as the Lords' records office through the 18th century, and several sets of renovations and building work were carried out to improve its fire-proofing and comfort, creating the current appearance of the tower. In 1834, the tower was one of only four buildings to survive a terrible fire in Westminster, and in the aftermath the records were moved to a new, purpose-built archive.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the 19th century {{there was}} a surge in {{historical}} interest in the Peasants' Revolt, spurred by the contemporary growth of the labour and socialist movements. Work by Charles Oman, Edgar Powell, André Réville and G. M. Trevelyan established the course of the revolt. By 1907 the accounts of the chroniclers were all widely available in print and the main public records concerning the events had been identified. Réville <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> the legal indictments that had been used against suspected rebels after the revolt as a fresh source of historical information, and over the next century extensive research was carried out into the local economic and social history of the revolt, using scattered local sources across south-east England.|$|E
5|$|Bone, {{both human}} and animal, was also sculpted; human bones may have been trophies, or relics of ancestors. The Maya valued Spondylus shells, and worked them to remove the white {{exterior}} and spines, to reveal the fine orange interior. Around the 10th century AD, metallurgy arrived in Mesoamerica from South America, and the Maya began to make small objects in gold, silver and copper. The Maya generally hammered sheet metal into objects such as beads, bells, and discs. In the last centuries before the Spanish Conquest, the Maya <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> the lost-wax method to cast small metal pieces.|$|E

5|$|By 1931, {{more than}} 80percent of the {{services}} offered by industrial laundries were sold to individual families. However, as the Great Depression continued, many people {{could no longer afford}} the services, and business declined. The decline continued after World War II when electric washers and dryers meant for home use became affordable to {{a large percentage of the}} populace. As individual customers disappeared, factory laundries turned to specialized services such as washing diapers or linens. In 1950, the American Linen Supply Company bought the Yale Laundry Company. In 1959, Perfect Fit Manufacturing <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> the building to make auto seat covers, tire covers, and other automotive fabrics. Perfect Fit remained in the building through 2006.|$|E
5|$|By the 1980s, protein {{sequencing}} had already transformed methods of scientific classification of organisms (especially cladistics) but biologists soon <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> RNA and DNA sequences as characters; this expanded {{the significance of}} molecular evolution within evolutionary biology, as the results of molecular systematics could be compared with traditional evolutionary trees based on morphology. Following the pioneering ideas of Lynn Margulis on endosymbiotic theory, which holds {{that some of the}} organelles of eukaryotic cells originated from free living prokaryotic organisms through symbiotic relationships, even the overall division of the tree of life was revised. Into the 1990s, the five domains (Plants, Animals, Fungi, Protists, and Monerans) became three (the Archaea, the Bacteria, and the Eukarya) based on Carl Woese's pioneering molecular systematics work with 16S rRNA sequencing.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{completion}} of I-287's New Jersey portion in 1993, more out-of-state tractor trailer drivers <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> the alignment of Route31 as a toll-free alternative to the New Jersey Turnpike. On July 16, 1999, oversize trucks were banned from using Route31 {{as part of a}} larger statewide ban imposed on New Jersey roads not a part of the National Highway System by then-governor Christine Todd Whitman. The legislation had a significant effect on trucks that followed Route31 as it forced them to use I-287 and the New Jersey Turnpike instead. In themid-2000s, the portion of Route31 was widened during extensive construction between Flemington and Clinton that widened the road to four lanes.|$|E
