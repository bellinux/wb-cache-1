It first calculates a margin of safety (the point which the revenue exceeds the break-even point) as that is the [...] "safe" [...] amount which the revenue can fall whilst still remaining to be above the break-even point. The graph on the right shows a typical <b>break-even</b> <b>chart.</b> Contribution refers to sales of the product or service, it can also be interpreted as the business's revenue stream. Fixed costs in this case serves the same purpose as business overheads, it will simply be shown as a straight horizontal line on the graph as shown.|$|E
40|$|At the {{beginning}} of the nineteenth century the former glory of Italian accounting was overshadowed by its decline during the eighteenth century, and literature from France, England, Germany, America and other countries took centre-stage. 'Theories of accounts' (rather than 'accounting theories') dominated not merely the early but also the later part of this century when Italian accounting had regained a prominent position beside other countries. The relation of those theories to the 'charts of accounts'-which later became so prominent in Continental Europe is historically important. The controversies over personalistic versus materialistic accounts and that between entity versus proprietary theories, as well as the emergence of other theories are discussed with reference to individual authors. Diverse topics from railroad accounting and auditing to various aspects of cost accounting are investigated. Particularly important are the pioneering efforts of this period that anticipated further developments. These manifested themselves in the following ideas: entity theory, flow of funds statement, matrix accounting, different aspects of valuation, allocation and depreciation, price-level adjustments and indexation, current values, exit values, residual income valuation, managerial control, the emergence of competing accounting (and Bilanz) theories, the separation of fixed from variable costs, fixed and flexible budgeting, zero-based budgeting, PERT, transfer prices, <b>break-even</b> <b>charts,</b> variance analysis, job-order costing, labour and machine hour rates, standard costing, price determination, integrating financial and cost accounting, clean surplus theory, agricultural accounting, holding gains, and other topics. Appendix A offers an overview of Nineteenth century scholars concerned with accounting history (together with one representative work of each), and Appendix B lists the nationally (and often internationally) prominent names of accounting authors born in the nineteenth century but also or exclusively active during the twentieth century. The paper integrates approximately 400 publications of which less than half are of the English tongue. Accounting research, history, nineteenth century, Twentieth century (beginning), innovations, international,...|$|R

Economic {{evaluation}} of investment proposals is attracting {{a great deal}} of attention from many businesspeople including engineers and management executives as well as academicians who find themselves in today's uncertain economic environment. Methods typically employed to evaluate profitability and risk require sophisticated mathematical skills and therefore do not meet practical needs. The purpose of this paper is to propose graphic analytical methods for evaluating mutually exclusive investment alternatives from the perspective of trade-off between profitability and risk. The paper takes into consideration uncertainties in those factors, such as the amount of initial investment, annual return, annual expenses, interest rate, and product and machinery life. The paper proposes such visual charts as modified annual return domain, modified annual cost domain, <b>break-even</b> line <b>chart,</b> and slice cut chart, all of which facilitate quantitative trade-off analysis on uncertainties among the listed factors. Procedures for describing these charts are illustrated with a practical numerical example, followed by a discussion on how to utilize them in practice...|$|R
