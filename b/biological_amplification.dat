40|$|Abstract Background The {{ability to}} measure T-cell {{responses}} to antigens is proving {{critical in the}} field of vaccine development and for understanding immunity to pathogens, allergens and self-antigens. Although a variety of technologies exist for this purpose IFNγ-ELISpot assays are widely used because of their sensitivity and simplicity. However, ELISpot assays cannot be performed on whole blood, and require relatively large volumes of blood to yield sufficient numbers of peripheral blood mononuclear cells. To address these deficiencies, we describe an assay that measures antigen-specific T cell responses through changes in monokine gene transcription. The <b>biological</b> <b>amplification</b> of the IFNγ signal generated by this assay provides sensitivity comparable to ELISpot, but with the advantage that responses can be quantified using small volumes of whole blood. Methods Whole blood or peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from healthy controls and immunosuppressed recipients of solid organ transplants were incubated with peptide pools covering viral and control antigens or mitogen for 20 hours. Total RNA was extracted and reverse transcribed before amplification in a TaqMan qPCR reaction using primers and probes specific for MIG (CXCL 9), IP- 10 (CXCL 10) and HPRT. The induction of MIG and IP- 10 in response to stimuli was analysed and the results were compared with those obtained by ELISpot. Results Antigen-specific T cell responses can be measured through the induction of MIG or IP- 10 gene expression in PBMCs or whole blood with results comparable to those achieved in ELISpot assays. The <b>biological</b> <b>amplification</b> generated by IFNγ-R signaling allows responses to be detected in as little as 25 μL of whole blood and enables the assay to retain sensitivity despite storage of samples for up to 48 hours prior to processing. Conclusions A monokine-based reporter assay provides a sensitive measure of antigen-specific T cell activation. Assays can be performed on small volumes of whole blood and remain accurate despite delays in processing.

The event-free survival rate (EFS) was also compared between the two groups. Among 143 neuroblastomas, 115 tumors originated from the abdomen, 26 from extra-abdominal sites and 2 from unknown primary sites.

40|$|Electroencephalography is {{a medical}} {{diagnosis}} technique. It consists in measuring the biopotentials produced by the upper layers of the brain at various standardized places on the skull. Since the biopotentials produced by the upper {{parts of the brain}} have an amplitude of about one microvolt, the measurements performed by an EEG are exposed to many risks. Moreover, since the present tendency is measure those signals over periods of several hours, or even several days, human analysis of the recording becomes extremely long and difficult. The use of signal analysis techniques for the help of paroxysm detection with clinical interest within the electroencephalogram becomes therefore almost essential. However the performance of many automatic detection algorithms becomes significantly degraded by the presence of interference: the quality of the recordings is therefore fundamental. This thesis explores the benefits that electronics and signal processing could bring to electroencephalography, aiming at improving the signal quality and semi-automating the data processing. These two aspects are interdependent because the performance of any semi-automation of the data processing depends {{on the quality of the}} acquired signal. Special attention is focused on the interaction between these two goals and attaining the optimal hardware/software pair. This thesis offers an overview of the medical electroencephalographic acquisition chain and also of its possible improvements. The conclusions of this work may be extended to some other cases of <b>biological</b> signal <b>amplification</b> such as the electrocardiogram (ECG) and the electromyogram (EMG). Moreover, such a generalization would be easier, because their signals have a wider amplitude and are therefore more resistant toward interference.

40|$|SummaryThe {{effectiveness}} of RNA interference (RNAi) in many organisms is potentiated through the signal-amplifying activity of a targeted RNA-directed RNA polymerase (RdRP) {{system that can}} convert a small population of exogenously-encountered dsRNA fragments into an abundant internal pool of small interfering RNA (siRNA). As for any <b>biological</b> <b>amplification</b> system, we expect an underlying architecture that will limit {{the ability of a}} randomly encountered trigger to produce an uncontrolled and self-escalating response. Investigating such limits in Caenorhabditis elegans, we find that feed-forward amplification is limited by biosynthetic and structural distinctions at the RNA level between (1) triggers that can produce amplification and (2) siRNA products of the amplification reaction. By assuring that initial (primary) siRNAs can act as triggers but not templates for activation, and that the resulting (secondary) siRNAs can enforce gene silencing on additional targets without unbridled trigger amplification, the system achieves substantial but fundamentally limited signal amplification...|$|E

40|$|It {{has been}} argued that {{bacterial}} cells may use their temperate viruses as biological weapons. For instance, a few bacterial cells among a population of lysogenic cells could release the virus and kill susceptible non-lysogenic competitors, while their clone mates would be immune. Because viruses replicate inside their victims upon infection, this process would amplify their number in the arena. Sometimes, however, temperate viruses spare recipient cells from death by establishing themselves in a dormant state inside cells. This phenomenon is called lysogenization and, for some viruses such as the l virus, the probability of lysogenization increases with the multiplicity of infection. Therefore, the amplification of viruses leads to conflicting predictions about the efficacy of temperate viruses as <b>biological</b> weapons: <b>amplification</b> can increase the relative advantage of clone mates of lysogens but also the likelihood of saving susceptible cells from death, because the probability of lysogenization is higher. To test the usefulness of viruses as biological weapons, we performed competition experiments between lysogenic Escherichia coli cells carrying the l virus and susceptible l-free E. coli cells, either in a structured or unstructured habitat. In structured and sometimes in unstructured habitats, the l virus qualitatively behaved as a ‘‘replicating toxin’’. However, such toxic effect of l viruses ceased after a few days of competition. This was {{due to the fact that}} many of initially susceptible cells became lysogenic. Massive lysogenization of susceptible cells occurred precisely under the conditions where the amplification of the virus was substantial. From then on, these cells and their descendant...|$|R

In this report, we use next-generation sequencing to analyze phage-displayed libraries and uncover a strong bias induced by amplification preferences of phage in bacteria. This bias favors fast-growing sequences that collectively constitute < 0. 01 % of the available diversity. Specifically, a library of 10 [superscript 9] random 7 -mer peptides (Ph. D. - 7) includes a few thousand sequences that grow quickly (the ‘parasites’), which are the sequences that are typically identified in phage display screens published to date. A similar collapse was observed in other libraries. Using Illumina and Ion Torrent sequencing and multiple <b>biological</b> replicates of <b>amplification</b> of Ph.

Many of these enriched sequences have confirmed function (e. g. target binding capacity). The bias in the literature, thus, {{can be viewed as a}} selection with two different selection pressures: (i) target-binding selection, and (ii) amplification-induced selection. Enrichment of parasitic sequences could be minimized if amplification bias is removed.

30|$|Contrast agents can {{be divided}} into two types {{according}} to the mechanism of MR imaging: Gd compounds (T 1 -positive contrast agent) and paramagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (T 2 -negative contrast agent). Compared with other contrast agents, Gd compounds have unparalleled advantages in clinical practice [17]. The Gd ion, which is a superparamagnetic material, provides a high-intensity signal in T 1 -weighted images. Gd can also bind to a variety of substances to form stable complexes with a high spatial resolution and a high signal-to-noise ratio. However, each type of contrast agent has its own limitations (namely, the short blood circulation time of T 1 contrast agents and the magnetic susceptibility artifacts of T 2 contrast agents) [18 – 21]. Traditional Gd compounds have the following limitations. (1) Traditional Gd chelates have no targeting effect. (2) The signal intensity of Gd chelate contrast agents is lower than that of ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxide particles (USPIOs) at the same concentration. To solve the above issues, Gd ions are linked to macromolecular structures (such as liposomes, dendritic molecules, and dextran) to enhance the T 1 relaxation effect [22], and the complex is then linked to the ligand of tumor targets to prepare molecular probes and achieve tumor-targeted imaging [23]. In this study, liposomes were selected as the carrier molecule that links MR contrast agents to fluorescent contrast agents. The special spatial structure of liposomes has a <b>biological</b> signal <b>amplification</b> effect, and it effectively improves the concentration of Gd ions in local tissues, thereby enhancing the MR signal intensity. Zhou et al. [24] employed β-cyclodextrin-linked polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (POSS) nanoparticles as the carrier to couple RGD to Gd compounds to successfully obtain a molecular probe, cRGD-POSS-βCD-(DOTA-Gd), with a T 1 relaxation rate of 9.50  mM− 1  S− 1. The liposome-cRGD-Gd-Cy 5 complex obtained in this study was found to have a T 1 relaxation rate of 10.515  mM− 1  S− 1, which is more than twice the T 1 relaxation rate of the Gd agent currently in clinical use (Magnevist), and this complex also exhibited excellent MR imaging properties.|$|R

For technical realizations, digital systems have become the most relevant systems in signal processing applications. The underlying continuous-time systems are transferred to the discrete-time domain using numerical integration methods. Within this contribution, effects on the qualitative behavior of the Andronov-Hopf bifurcation based systems concerning numerical integration methods are analyzed. It is shown exemplarily that explicit Runge-Kutta methods transform the truncated normalform equation of the Andronov-Hopf bifurcation into the normalform equation of the Neimark-Sacker bifurcation. Dependent {{on the order of}} the integration method, higher order terms are added during this transformation. A rescaled normalform equation of the Neimark-Sacker bifurcation is introduced that allows a parametric design of a discrete-time system which corresponds to the rescaled Andronov-Hopf system. This system approximates the characteristics of the rescaled Hopf-type amplifier for a large range of parameters. The natural frequency and the peak amplitude are preserved for every set of parameters. The Neimark-Sacker bifurcation based systems avoid large computational effort that would be caused by applying higher order integration methods to the continuous-time normalform equations. © Author(s) 2017...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. At present, {{although}} seasonal sea-ice cover mit-igates atmosphere-ocean gas exchange, the Arctic Ocean {{takes up}} carbon dioxide (CO 2) {{on the order}} of − 66 to − 199 Tg C year− 1 (1012 g C), contributing 5 – 14 % to the global balance of CO 2 sinks and sources. Because of this, the Arctic Ocean has an important influence on the global carbon cycle, with the marine carbon cycle and atmosphere-ocean CO 2 exchanges sensitive to Arctic Ocean and global climate change feedbacks. In the near-term, further sea-ice loss and increases in phytoplankton growth rates are expected to in-crease the uptake of CO 2 by Arctic Ocean surface waters, al-though mitigated somewhat by surface warming in the Arc-tic. Thus, the capacity of the Arctic Ocean to uptake CO 2 is expected to alter in response to environmental changes driven largely by climate. These changes are likely to con-tinue to modify the physics, biogeochemistry, and ecology of the Arctic Ocean in ways that are not yet fully understood.

40|$|Introduction: During {{workflow}} in Laboratories {{the most}} delicate and important step is pre-analytic sample treatment because it involves more than one operator of the same structure and often different health services. In fact, the biological materials used for the diagnosis should be collected, sent and properly treated before the analytic phase. Correct methods for collecting and handling biological materials, including guidelines to users of laboratory services, improve performance of Laboratory testing activity. In the pre-analytic phase the operators check sample integrity, and prepare the sample for the subsequent analytic phase: in all these steps monitoring and control of “non- compliance” is crucial. Methods: During 2007 - 2008 we created a “non- compliance” check-list, to monitor errors which occurred in different sectors of the preanalytic phase, particularly in the nucleic acid extraction step. These “non-compliances” are analysed to identify and to remove errors, adopting preventive and corrective proceedings. Since 2008 we have been using DNA/RNA internal controls synthesized in our Laboratory. They can be amplified by the same primers and recognized by different probes. Results: Examination of the “non compliance” check-list for molecular biology investigations shows {{that the percentage of}} urine repeat samples decreased from 17 % to 2 % and the percentage of stool repeat samples from 27 % to 2 %. Regarding use of internal controls, they allow the assessment of inhibitory factors that can prevent gene amplification. Conclusions: Monitoring “non-compliance” cases and dividing them by typology allow us identifying the most frequent causes of incorrect sample handling, as a non optimal procedure of pre-treatment, thus improving the pre-analytic phase. Therefore by monitoring the preanalytic phase we can prevent the introduction of confounding factors that may negatively influence the accuracy of results and their interpretation. Before proceeding to gene <b>amplification,</b> <b>biological</b> samples must be properly purified to eliminate lipids, proteins, polysaccharides and other potential inhibitors of DNA polymerase...|$|R

40|$|In the WHO 1996 {{classification}} of cardiomyopathies, myocarditis {{is defined as}} an "inflammatory disease of the myocardium associated with cardiac dysfunction" and is listed among "specific cardiomyopathies". Myocarditis is diagnosed on endomyocardial biopsy (EMB) by established histological, immunological, and immunohistochemical criteria, and molecular techniques are recommended to identify viral etiology. Infectious, autoimmune, and idiopathic forms of inflammatory cardiomyopathy are recognized {{that may lead to}} dilated cardiomyopathy. According to Dallas criteria, myocarditis is diagnosed in the setting of an "inflammatory infiltrate of the myocardium with necrosis and/or degeneration of adjacent myocytes, not typical of ischemic damage associated with coronary artery disease". The majority of experts in the field agree that an actual increase in sensitivity of EMB has now been reached by using immunohistochemistry together with histology. A value of > 14 leukocytes/mm(2) with the presence of T lymphocytes > 7 cells/mm(2) has been considered a realistic cut off to reach a diagnosis of myocarditis. The development of molecular <b>biological</b> techniques, particularly <b>amplification</b> methods like polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or nested-PCR, allows the detection of low copy viral genomes even from an extremely small amount of tissue such as in EMB specimens. Positive PCR results obtained on EMB should always be accompanied by a parallel investigation on blood samples collected {{at the time of the}} EMB. According to the recent Association for European Cardiovascular Pathology guidelines, optimal specimen procurement and triage indicates at least three, preferably four, EMB fragments, each 1 - 2 mm in size, that should immediately be fixed in 10 % buffered formalin at room temperature for light microscopic examination.

Moreover, one or two specimens should be snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at - 80 °C or alternatively stored in RNA-later for possible molecular tests or specific stains.

In this context, the detection of anti-bodies to tumor cell autologous antigens possesses great potential. The humoral immune response represents a form of <b>biological</b> <b>amplification</b> of signals that are otherwise weak because of very low concentrations of antigen, especially {{in the early stages}} of cancers. Herein we present the use of integral microarrays spotted with tumor-derived proteins to investigate the antibody repertoire in the sera of lung cancer patients and controls. The use of two-dimensional liquid chromatography allowed us to separate proteins from the lung adenocarcinoma cell line A 549 into 1760 fractions, which were printed in duplicate, along with various controls, onto nitrocellulose coated slides. The sensitivity and specificity of the microarrays to detect singular antibodies in fluids were first validated through the recognition of fractions containing a lung marker antigen by antibody probing. Twenty fractions were initially selected as highly reactive against the anti-PGP 9. 5 antibody, and subsequent mass spectrometry analyses confirmed the identity of PGP 9. 5 protein in four of them. As a result, the importance of neighboring fractions in microarray detection was revealed due to the spreading of proteins during the separation process. Next, the microarrays; were individually incubated with 14 serum samples from patients with lung cancer patients, 14 sera from colon cancer patients, and 14 control sera from normal subjects. The reactivity of the selected fractions was analyzed, and the level of immunoglobulin bound to each fraction by each serum sample was quantified. Eight of the 20 fractions offered p values < 0. 01 and were recognized by an average of four reacting patients, whereas no serum from normal individuals was positive for those fractions. Protein microarrays from tumor-derived fractions hold the diagnostic potential of uncovering antigens that induce an immune response in patients with certain types of cancers. © 2008 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.

40|$|Abstract Background Mechanistic models play an {{important}} role in many biological disciplines, and they can effectively contribute to evaluate the spatial-temporal evolution of mosquito populations, in the light of the increasing knowledge of the crucial driving role on vector dynamics played by meteo-climatic features as well as other physical-biological characteristics of the landscape. Methods In malaria eco-epidemiology landscape components (atmosphere, water bodies, land use) interact with the epidemiological system (interacting populations of vector, human, and parasite). In the background of the eco-epidemiological approach, a mosquito population model is here proposed to evaluate the sensitivity of An. gambiae s. s. population to some peculiar thermal-pluviometric scenarios. The scenarios are obtained perturbing meteorological time series data referred to four Kenyan sites (Nairobi, Nyabondo, Kibwesi, and Malindi) representing four different eco-epidemiological settings. Results Simulations highlight a strong dependence of mosquito population abundance on temperature variation with well-defined site-specific patterns. The upper extreme of thermal perturbation interval (+ 3 °C) gives rise to an increase in adult population abundance at Nairobi (+ 111 %) and Nyabondo (+ 61 %), and a decrease at Kibwezi (- 2 %) and Malindi (- 36 %). At the lower extreme perturbation (- 3 °C) is observed a reduction in both immature and adult mosquito population in three sites (Nairobi - 74 %, Nyabondo - 66 %, Kibwezi - 39 %), and an increase in Malindi (+ 11 %). A coherent non-linear pattern of population variation emerges. The maximum rate of variation is + 30 % population abundance for + 1 °C of temperature change, but also almost null and negative values are obtained. Mosquitoes are less sensitive to rainfall and both adults and immature populations display a positive quasi-linear response pattern to rainfall variation. Conclusions The non-linear temperature-dependent response is in agreement with the non-linear patterns of temperature-response of the basic bio-demographic processes. This non-linearity makes the hypothesized <b>biological</b> <b>amplification</b> of temperature effects valid only for a limited range of temperatures. As a consequence, no simple extrapolations can be done linking temperature rise with increase in mosquito distribution and abundance, and projections of An. gambiae s. s. populations should be produced only in the light of the local meteo-climatic features as well as other physical and biological characteristics of the landscape. </p...|$|E
40|$|Positron {{emission}} tomography (PET), single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), and the combined imaging modalities realised in the en-vogue hybrid technologies PET/CT and PET/MR represent the state-of-the-art diagnostic imaging technologies in nuclear medicine {{which are used}} for the highly sensitive non-invasive imaging of biological processes at the subcellular and molecular level in a respective patient for the visualisation of rather early disease states or for early inspection of treatment response after chemotherapy, radiation- or radioendotherapy. Radiolabelled molecules, bearing a “radioactive lantern”, function as so called Radiopharmaceuticals which have {{to be compliant with}} the pharmaceuticals act, and can be termed as “food” of nuclear medicine. In general, the specialised field Radiopharmaceutical Chemistry focusses on the development, synthesis and radiolabelling of aforementioned “food”, such as small molecules, biotechnology-derived antibodies or (cyclised) (oligo) peptides which are used to address clinically relevant biological “downstream” targets such as receptors, enzymes, transport systems and others. Addressing “upstream” targets such as DNA- and RNA-fragments using corresponding radioactive substrates represents a further feasible strategy. Originally, Radiopharmaceutical Chemistry descends from radiochemistry and radiopharmacy as well as nuclear chemistry and uses methods finally aiming at the production of radioactive substances for human application which are essential for non-invasive in vivo imaging by means of the aforementioned scintigraphic methods PET or SPECT. The cornerstone for applicable radiochemistry in nuclear medicine was set by the Hungarian chemist George Charles de Hevesy who received the Nobel Prize in 1943 for his work on the radioindicator principle. This principle is {{based on the idea that}} the absolute amount of the administered substance is below the dose needed to induce a pharmacodynamic effect. Nowadays, a radioactive substance that can be traced in vivo as it moves through the living organism is termed radiotracer or radiopharmaceutical. As mentioned above, the biodistribution of radiopharmaceuticals is measured non-invasively reflecting functional or molecular disorders without pharmacologically affecting the organism. In the era of personalised medicine the diagnostic potential of radiopharmaceuticals is directly linked to a subsequent individual therapeutic approach called radioendotherapy. Depending on the “radioactive lantern” (gamma or particle emitter) used for radiolabelling of the respective tracer molecule, the field Radiopharmaceutical Chemistry can contribute to the set-up of an in vivo “theranostic” approach especially in tumour patients by offering tailor-made (radio) chemical entities labelled either with a diagnostic or a therapeutic radionuclide. To succeed in the design of targeted high-affinity radiopharmaceuticals that can measure the alteration of receptors serving at the same time as biological targets for individualised radioendotherapy several aspects need to be considered: (i) reasonable pharmacological behaviour (especially pharmacokinetics adjusted to the physical half-life of the used radionuclide), (ii) ability to penetrate and cross biological membranes, (iii) usage of chemical as well as <b>biological</b> <b>amplification</b> strategies (e. g. pretargeting, biological trapping of converted ligands, change of the physicochemical behaviour of the radiopharmaceutical after target interaction, combination with biotransporters and heterodimer approaches), (iv) availability of radiopharmaceuticals with high specific activities and in vivo stability...|$|E
