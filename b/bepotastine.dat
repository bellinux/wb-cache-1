50|$|It is marketed in Japan by Tanabe Seiyaku {{under the}} brand name Talion. Talion was co-developed by Tanabe Seiyaku and Ube Industries, the latter of which {{discovered}} <b>bepotastine.</b> In 2001, Tanabe Seiyaku granted Senju, now owned by Allergan, exclusive worldwide rights, {{with the exception of}} certain Asian countries, to develop, manufacture and market <b>bepotastine</b> for ophthalmic use. Senju, in turn, has granted the United States rights for the ophthalmic preparation to ISTA Pharmaceuticals.|$|E
50|$|A Phase III {{clinical}} trial {{was carried out}} in 2010 {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} <b>bepotastine</b> besilate ophthalmic solutions 1.0% and 1.5%. These solutions were compared to a placebo and evaluated for their ability to reduce ocular itchiness. The study was carried out with 130 individuals and evaluated after 15 minutes, 8 hours, or 16 hours. There was a reduction in itchiness at all-time points for both ophthalmic solutions. The study concluded that <b>bepotastine</b> besilate ophthalmic formulations reduced ocular itchiness for at least 8 hours after dosing compared to placebo. Phase I and II trials were carried out in Japan.|$|E
50|$|<b>Bepotastine</b> (Talion, Bepreve) is a 2nd {{generation}} antihistamine. It {{was approved}} in Japan {{for use in}} the treatment of allergic rhinitis and urticaria/pruritus in July 2000 and January 2002, respectively. It is currently marketed in the United States under the brand-name Bepreve, by ISTA Pharmaceuticals.|$|E
50|$|<b>Bepotastine</b> is {{available}} as an ophthalmic solution and oral tablet. It {{is a direct}} H1-receptor antagonist that inhibits the release of histamine from mast cells. The ophthalmic formulation has shown minimal systemic absorption, between 1 and 1.5% in healthy adults. Common side effects are eye irritation, headache, unpleasant taste, and nasopharyngitis. The main route of elimination is urinary excretion, 75-90% excreted unchanged.|$|E
5000|$|Studies {{have been}} {{performed}} in animals and <b>bepotastine</b> besilate was {{not found to be}} teratogenic in rats during fetal development, even at 3,300 times more that typical use in humans. [...] Evidence of infertility was seen in rats at 3,3000 times the typical ocular does in humans. The safety and efficacy has not been established in patients under 2 years of age and has been extrapolated from adults for patients under 10 years of age.|$|E
50|$|In 2011, ISTA {{pharmaceuticals}} {{experienced a}} 2.4% increase in net revenues from 2010, which {{was driven by}} the sales of Bepreve. Their net revenue for 2011 was $160.3 million. ISTA Pharmaceuticals was acquired by Bausch & Lomb in March 2012 for $500 million. Bausch & Lomb hold the patent for <b>bepotastine</b> besilate (https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/ob/docs/temptn.cfm. On November 26, 2014, Bausch & Lomb sue Micro Labs USA for patent infringement. Bausch & Lomb was recently bought out by Valeant Pharmaceuticals in May 2013 for $8.57 billion, Valeant's largest acquisition to date, causing the company's stock to rise 25% when the deal was announced.|$|E
40|$|Craig F McCabe, Shannon E McCabeMcCabe Vision Center, Murfreesboro, TN, USABackground: The aim of {{this study}} was to compare patient-perceived relief of ocular itch, nasal symptoms, and eye drop comfort when {{allergic}} conjunctivitis was treated with <b>bepotastine</b> besilate 1. 5 % versus olopatadine hydrochloride 0. 2 %. Methods: This randomized, observer-masked, single-center, crossover study included 30 patients with ocular itching associated with allergic conjunctivitis accompanied by nasal symptoms. Patients were treated with <b>bepotastine</b> besilate 1. 5 % twice daily (7 am and 4 pm) or olopatadine hydrochloride 0. 2 % once daily (7 am) for 14 days. Following a 7 -day washout period during which only preservative-free artificial tears were used twice daily, patients were crossed over to the alternative treatment for 14 days. Parameters evaluated by twice-daily patient diaries included each treatment&# 39;s ability to relieve ocular itch, ability to relieve itchy/runny nose, ability to relieve ocular allergy symptoms, and eye drop comfort. At the conclusion of the study, patients were also asked to identify which agent provided better all-day relief of ocular itching, better all-day relief of itchy/runny nose, superior comfort, and for which treatment they would prefer a prescription. Results: According to the mean daily diary responses, <b>bepotastine</b> besilate 1. 5 % provided significantly better relief of evening ocular itch, relief of morning and evening itchy/runny nose, and relief of morning and evening ocular allergy symptoms. At study end, 63. 3 % and 66. 7 % of patients preferred <b>bepotastine</b> besilate 1. 5 % for all-day relief of ocular itching and all-day relief of itchy/runny nose, respectively. At study end, there was no significant difference in the number of patients preferring one treatment over the other for comfort. Overall, 66. 7 % of patients stated that they would prefer to treat their allergic conjunctivitis with <b>bepotastine</b> besilate 1. 5 % over olopatadine hydrochloride 0. 2 %. Conclusion: Based on their evaluation of therapeutic performance, patients preferred <b>bepotastine</b> besilate 1. 5 % over olopatadine hydrochloride 0. 2 % by two-to-one for the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis.

40|$|Besides histamine, {{substance}} P (SP) {{has been}} demonstrated to {{play a crucial role}} in pruritic skin diseases. Although antihistamines are frequently used for pruritic skin diseases, little is known concerning the effect on an SP-induced event such as mast cell degranulation and the upregulation of adhesion molecules or the nitric oxide (NO) synthesis in endothelial cells. Our aim was to study the effect of <b>bepotastine</b> besilate on SP-induced degranulation of rat basophillic leukemia (RBL- 2 H 3) cells and expression of adhesion molecules and NO synthesis in human dermal microvascular endothelial cells (HMVECs). <b>Bepotastine</b> besilate significantly inhibited SP-induced degranulation of RBL- 2 H 3 cells and NO synthesis in HMVECs. <b>Bepotastine</b> besilate significantly inhibited expression of adhesion molecules in HMVESs, while it failed to suppress SP-induced upregulation of the adhesion molecules in HMVECs. Therefore, <b>bepotastine</b> besilate is assumed to act favorably on SP-induced basophil degranulation and NO synthesis in HMVECs. Copyright © 2009 Shun Kitaba et al.

Methods: Two Phase III, placebo-controlled, double-masked, randomized clinical trials were conducted at {{a total of six}} separate centers using the CAC model of allergic conjunctivitis. The same study design was employed for both clinical trials, with subjects randomly assigned to either BBOS 1. 5 % (n= 78) or placebo (n= 79) treatment. Each subject received one eye drop of the test agent bilaterally at different study visits 15  minutes, 8  hours, or 16  hours prior to a CAC. Primary ocular end points included changes in ocular itching reported at 3, 5, and 7  minutes and conjunctival hyperemia assessed at 7, 15, and 20  minutes following each CAC. Secondary ocular end points included chemosis as well as episcleral and ciliary hyperemia judged by investigators, and tearing (scored as either absent or present) and eyelid swelling judged by subjects. Results: A statistically significant reduction in ocular itching was observed for BBOS 1. 5 % treatment compared to placebo at all time points (P< 0. 0001), while measures for onset and 8 -hour persistence of action also reached clinical significance (ie, ≥ 1. 0  unit difference) at a majority of time points. In addition, a significant reduction in conjunctival hyperemia was achieved at a majority of time points during the onset of action CAC test. Secondary end points were also significantly improved compared to placebo, most prominently for reduced tearing at all study visits and reduced eyelid swelling at the onset of action and 8 -hour study visits. Adverse events were generally mild and transient. Conclusion: BBOS 1. 5 % rapidly reduced CAC-induced ocular itching with duration of effectiveness of at least 8  hours after dosing. Certain secondary signs of inflammation were also significantly reduced. Keywords: allergen challenge, antihistamine, itching, Beprev...|$|E
40|$|Objective - Histamine {{is one of}} the {{chemical}} mediators released during the acute phase of allergic rhinitis and is considered to cause the increase in epithelial permeability observed. We tried to examine the effect of histamine on nasal mucosal permeability in vivo. Material and methods - Histamine at different concentrations was administered to the nostrils of healthy subjects and the nasal transepithelial potential difference (PD) was measured. We also examined nasal mucosal permeability by means of a histochemical technique using horseradish peroxidase (HRP) in guinea pigs. Results - Administration of 10 - 1 M histamine significantly reduced the nasal PD in healthy subjects. After administration of 5. 4 × 10 - 1 M histamine to the noses of guinea pigs, most of the intercellular spaces showed positive reactions to HRP and this effect was significantly inhibited by pretreatment with mepyramine and the antihistamine <b>bepotastine</b> besilate. Conclusion - These results indicate that histamine {{plays an important role in}} the change in mucosal permeability observed in allergic rhinitis in vivo via the histamine H 1 receptor...|$|E
40|$|Aims. To measure {{blood and}} tissue {{concentrations}} of the H 1 -receptor antagonist, <b>bepotastine</b> besilate (BB). Methods. Participants included 14 men and six women, whose age ranged from 13 to 76 years, with chronic rhinosinusitis, who underwent endoscopic sinus surgery at our university hospital. Among them, 10 participants had allergic rhinitis (AR) (Group I), and {{others did not}} have AR (Group II). Nasal mucosa and blood were collected 55 to 130 minutes after oral administration of BB 10 &#x 2009;mg. Concentrations of the agent in the serum and nasal mucosa were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. Results. Concentrations of BB of the serum in Group I and II were 98 &#x 00 B 1; 32 &#x 2009;ng/mL and 112 &#x 00 B 1; 39 &#x 2009;ng/mL. Those of the nasal mucosa tissue in Groups I and II were 101 &#x 00 B 1; 36 &#x 2009;ng/g and 132 &#x 00 B 1; 44 &#x 2009;ng/g. There {{was no significant difference}} in the values of concentration of BB between the serum and the nasal mucosa in either Group I or II (P=. 757 and P=. 2662, resp., Paired t-test). Conclusion. This preliminary study is considered the first report on the concentration of H 1 -receptor antagonists in nasal mucosa. The prompt absorption and transition to the nasal mucosa of BB seems to have an effect on allergic rhinitis...|$|E
40|$|Background: H 1 antihistamines {{are widely}} used as {{therapeutics}} for allergic diseases. Sedation is a well-known side effect of H 1 antihistamines and sometimes it is life-threatening for patients. Thus {{it is important to}} evaluate the sedative properties of H 1 antihistamines to avoid side effects. For this purpose, histamine H 1 receptor (H 1 R) occupancy and proportional impairment ratios (PIR) are now being used. However, {{it is not easy to}} obtain these parameters. Here, we sought to evaluate the sedative properties of H 1 antihistamines by means of a large-scale surveillance at health insurance pharmacies. Methods: The survey was conducted at 37 health insurance pharmacies. The therapeutic efficacy and the degree of sleepiness were quantified through a questionnaire using the visual analog scale (VAS) directly from 1742 patients who received H 1 antihistamines. Results: The degree of sleepiness caused by the first-generation antihistamines was significantly higher than that of the second-generation antihistamines. The high VAS score in case of efficacy was found in d-chlorpheniramine, olopatadine, and ebastine. Among the mean values of efficacy, all second-generation antihistamines except for loratadine, <b>bepotastine,</b> and mequitazine were significantly higher than that of clemastine. Regarding the degree of sleepiness, clemastine scored the highest VAS score, and significantly lower scores were obtained in all second-generation antihistamines. Conclusions: The sedative properties of the H 1 antihistamines obtained from VAS analysis were very similar to those of H 1 R occupancy from positron emission tomography (PET) studies and PIR from meta-analysis. Our results indicate that large-scale surveillance using VAS might be useful to evaluate the profiles of H 1 antihistamines...|$|E
