50|$|This theory {{draws on}} the {{philosophical}} monism and empiricism of Deleuze and Guattari and a theory of technology from actor-network theory. It offers an interpretive framework to trace unbroken connections between the lowest technical levels of computer operations through the experience of users, the conceptual frameworks in discourse, and political and economic structures, {{all of which are}} increasingly mediated by information technologies. The first order of invocation is the fetch-execute cycle, which puts command and memory into the same circuit. The second order of the invocation is the invocationary act by which users compose invocations to do things, but in doing so depend upon avocations and invocable domains that pre-exist that event.

40|$|The present diploma thesis {{deals with}} the process of {{creating}} a decision model that helps in a decision making process. The main problem of the process is the selection of a scenario for setting up/upgrading a <b>business</b> <b>information</b> <b>system.</b> At the start of the thesis,information systems are presented, focusing on ERP systems, which are {{the most common form of}} <b>business</b> <b>information</b> <b>system</b> in mid- and big-sized companies. In the next part,the DEX methodology, on which the DEXi program is based, is presented. It is a combination of multi-attribute decision making and expert systems, which are explained in detail in chapter 3. 1. The model was created using the DEXi program. Main part of the thesis is chapter 4, in which the process of creating a decision making model is described and explained in detail. Furthermore, my choice of the criteria for the model and the description of how the utility functions were set were presented and explained. End result is a working decision model, that can be very useful for selecting a <b>business</b> <b>information</b> <b>system.</b> The model was also used in practice.

40|$|Transparency {{is defined}} as the open flow of high quality {{information}} in a meaningful and useful manner amongst stakeholders in a <b>business</b> <b>information</b> <b>system.</b> Therefore transparency is a requirement of businesses and their information systems. It is typically linked to positive ethical and economic attributes, such as trust and accountability. Despite its importance, transparency is often studied as a secondary concept and viewed through the lenses of adjacent concepts such as security, privacy and regulatory requirements. This has led to a reduced ability to manage transparency and deal with its peculiarities as a first-class requirement. Ad-hoc introduction of transparency may have adverse effects, such as information overload and reduced collaboration. The thesis contributes to the knowledge on transparency requirements by proposing the following. First, this thesis proposes four reference models for transparency. These reference models are based on an extensive literature study in multiple disciplines and provide a foundation for the engineering of transparency requirements in a <b>business</b> <b>information</b> <b>system.</b> Second, this thesis proposes a modelling language for modelling and analysing transparency requirements amongst stakeholders in a <b>business</b> <b>information</b> <b>system.</b> This modelling language is based on the proposed four reference models for transparency. Third, this thesis proposes a method for the elicitation and adaptation of transparency requirements in a <b>business</b> <b>information</b> <b>system.</b> It covers the entire life cycle of transparency requirements and utilises the transparency modelling language for modelling and analysis of transparency requirements. It benefits from three concepts of crowdsourcing, structured feedback acquisition and social adaptation for the elicitation and adaptation of transparency requirements. The thesis also evaluates the transparency modelling language in terms of its usefulness and quality using two different case studies. Then, the feedback acquisition section in the transparency elicitation and adaptation method is evaluated using a third case study. The results of these case studies illustrate the potentials and applicability of both the modelling language and the method in the engineering of transparency requirements in business information systems...|$|E
