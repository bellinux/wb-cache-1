5|$|Mole crickets are {{relatively}} common, <b>but</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> nocturnal and spend nearly {{all their lives}} underground in extensive tunnel systems, they are rarely seen. They inhabit agricultural fields and grassy areas. They are present in every continent {{with the exception of}} Antarctica; by 2014, one hundred and seven species had been described and more species are likely to be discovered, especially in Asia. Neoscapteriscus didactylus is a widespread pest species, originating in South America it has spread to the West Indies and New South Wales in Australia. Gryllotalpa africana is a major pest in South Africa; other Gryllotalpa species are widely distributed in Europe, Asia and Australia. They are native to Britain (as to western Europe), but the former population of G. gryllotalpa may now be extinct in mainland Britain, surviving in the Channel Islands.|$|E

25|$|SeaWorld {{is home to}} 'More than 200 stingrays- {{some with}} wingspans up to 5-feet'. Within the main SeaWorld park there are small pools where {{people are able to}} {{interact}} with and feed the stingrays. They also have small nurseries which are home to the stingrays' pups; these are also open for interactions, <b>but</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> young, they tend to hide beneath the sand.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} forms of aptychus, varying in shape and the {{sculpture}} of {{the inner and outer}} surfaces, <b>but</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> so rarely found in position within the shell of the ammonite it is often unclear to which species of ammonite one kind of aptychus belongs. A number of aptychi have been given their own genus and even species names independent of their unknown owners' genus and species, pending future discovery of verified occurrences within ammonite shells.|$|E

25|$|Ranks are {{assigned}} based on subjective dissimilarity, {{and do not}} fully reflect the gradational nature of variation within nature. In most cases, higher taxonomic groupings arise further back in time: not because the rate of diversification was higher in the past, but because each subsequent diversification event results in an increase of diversity and thus increases the taxonomic rank assigned by present-day taxonomists. Furthermore, some groups have many described species {{not because they are}} more diverse than other species, <b>but</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> more easily sampled and studied than other group.|$|E
25|$|In recent years, women wearing hijab {{have been}} subject of verbal and {{physical}} attacks in Western countries, particularly following terrorist attacks. Louis A. Cainkar writes that the data suggest that women in hijab rather than men are the predominant target of anti-Muslim attacks {{not because they are}} more easily identifiable as Muslims, <b>but</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> seen to represent a threat to the local moral order that the attackers are seeking to defend. Some women stop wearing hijab out of fear or following perceived pressure from their acquaintances, but many refuse to stop wearing it out of religious conviction even when they are urged to do so for self-protection.|$|E
25|$|After new {{segments}} of rail are laid, or defective rails replaced (welded-in), the rails can be artificially stressed if {{the temperature of}} the rail during laying is cooler than what is desired. The stressing process involves either heating the rails, causing them to expand, or stretching the rails with hydraulic equipment. They are then fastened (clipped) to the sleepers in their expanded form. This process ensures that the rail will not expand much further in subsequent hot weather. In cold weather the rails try to contract, <b>but</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> firmly fastened, cannot do so. In effect, stressed rails are a bit like a piece of stretched elastic firmly fastened down.|$|E

500|$|Bishop Desmond Tutu, who Bilheimer had {{previously}} interviewed for The Cry of Reason, appears {{towards the end}} of the film, saying, [...] "Each of us has the capacity to be a saint." [...] Bilheimer included Tutu in Not My Life because he felt that audiences might be in need of pastoral counseling after watching the film. The final scene of Not My Life returns to the boy holding his breath underwater in Ghana. His name is revealed to be Etse, and it is stated that he and six other trafficking victims shown in the film have been rescued. Some of the last words in the film are spoken by Brazilian human rights advocate Leo Sakomoto: [...] "I can't see a good life while there are people living like animals. Not because I'm a good person, not because it's my duty, <b>but</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> human—like me." ...|$|E

30|$|The {{presence}} of extraordinary beings, different and even abominable, {{as is the}} case of toads, frogs and snakes, is a classic in anthropological research and has been studied in depth by Douglas (1996) who points out that these beings should be respected, not merely <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> filthy and disgusting <b>but</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> emblematic victims.|$|R
500|$|Only {{vertebrate}} {{animals have}} ears, though many invertebrates detect sound using {{other kinds of}} sense organs. In insects, tympanal organs are used to hear distant sounds. They are located either on the head or elsewhere, depending on the insect family. The tympanal organs of some insects are extremely sensitive, offering acute hearing beyond that of most other animals. The female cricket fly Ormia ochracea has tympanal organs {{on each side of}} her abdomen. They are connected by a thin bridge of exoskeleton and they function like a tiny pair of eardrums, <b>but,</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> linked, they provide acute directional information. The fly uses her [...] "ears" [...] to detect the call of her host, a male cricket. Depending on where the song of the cricket is coming from, the fly's hearing organs will reverberate at slightly different frequencies. This difference may be as little as 50billionths of a second, but it is enough to allow the fly to home in directly on a singing male cricket and parasitise it.|$|E
500|$|The Rice Owls and Texas met in 2005for the 88thtime. Texas held a 65–21–1lead in the series, {{which began}} in 1914. For the Longhorns this series ranks fourth in number of games played, behind Texas A, Oklahoma, and Baylor. The two schools were once conference foes in the Southwest Conference and have {{maintained}} a rivalry {{despite the fact that}} Texas enjoys a sizable lead in the series. President John F. Kennedy alluded to the lopsidedness of the rivalry in his 1962 speech on America's space program: [...] "But why, some say, the moon? ... And they may well ask why climb the highest mountain. Why, 35 years ago, fly the Atlantic? Why does Rice play Texas?... We choose to go to the moon... and do the other things, not because they are easy, <b>but</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> hard." [...] In addition to continuing a traditional rivalry, playing Rice in a home and away series allows for Texas to play games in Houston, Texas, an important recruiting base for UT, which has a significant Texas Exes alumni population.|$|E
500|$|Despite being poor pets {{that are}} {{difficult}} to care for, with a dangerous toxic bite and a sleep cycle opposite to that of humans, a large number of slow lorises are traded as pets, both locally and internationally. Although it is illegal to import slow lorises for commercial sale, they are popular exotic pets in Japan, the United States, and Europe. This is mainly because of their [...] "cute" [...] appearance, popularized in highly viewed YouTube videos, which {{is due in part to}} their large eyes, adaptations to a nocturnal lifestyle. Hundreds of slow lorises have been confiscated at airports, <b>but</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> easy to hide, these numbers are likely to be only a small fraction of the total number being trafficked. Traders cut or pull the teeth of slow lorises to make them appear to be an appropriate pet for small children, but this practice often leads to extreme blood loss, infection, and death. Slow lorises lacking their teeth would be unable to fend for themselves and therefore are not reintroduced into the wild. Most captive lorises in the pet trade also receive improper care and die from poor nutrition, stress, or infection. Despite this, demand has risen, and slow lorises are no longer captured opportunistically, but are now hunted on a commercial scale using flashlights, from which the animals do not flee.|$|E
5|$|Many educated Sudanese were {{suspicious}} of the Council and drifted towards the Khatmiyya side in the 1944 elections, not for religious reasons <b>but</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> hostile to the government, wanted to retain links with Egypt as a counterpoise to British influence {{and did not want}} a monarchy under Sayyid Abd al-Rahman.|$|R
50|$|The years 1888 to 1898 {{marked a}} {{positive}} {{turning point for}} the Polish settlement. During this span, 150 Polish families immigrated to Wyandotte.

2500|$|In {{this same}} essay, Sainte-Beuve quoted Goethe (referring to the 'classics' concept): [...] "Ancient works are {{classical}} {{not because they}} are old, <b>but</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> powerful, fresh, and healthy." ...|$|E
2500|$|Johnson {{began his}} elected presidential term with similar motives {{as he had}} upon {{succeeding}} to the office, ready to [...] "carry forward the plans and programs of John Fitzgerald Kennedy.

[...] He was reticent to push southern congressmen even further after passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and suspected their support may have been temporarily tapped out. Nevertheless, the Selma to Montgomery marches in Alabama led by Martin Luther King ultimately led Johnson to initiate debate on a voting rights bill in February 1965.|$|E
2500|$|House dust mites {{are present}} indoors {{wherever}} humans live. Positive tests for dust mite allergies are extremely common {{among people with}} asthma. Dust mites are microscopic arachnids whose primary food is dead human skin cells, {{but they do not}} live on living people. They and their feces and other allergens they produce are major constituents of house dust, <b>but</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> so heavy they are not suspended for long in the air. [...] They are generally found on the floor and other surfaces until disturbed (by walking, for example). It could take somewhere between twenty minutes and two hours for dust mites to settle back down out of the air.|$|E
