5000|$|In 1977, {{while playing}} at a Sweetheart gig {{at a bar}} in Nashville called [...] "Fanny's", <b>Belew</b> was {{discovered}} by Frank Zappa, who had been tipped off regarding the band's talents by his chauffeur.

During this time Sweetheart split up. Once the formal invitation came, <b>Belew</b> flew out to Los Angeles and found himself auditioning alongside more formally trained musicians. Believing that he'd messed up his first audition, <b>Belew</b> persuaded Zappa to give him a second one. Belew's second audition was a more intimate one-on-one experience which took place in Zappa's living room. Zappa was impressed enough to hire <b>Belew</b> on a handshake deal for a year.|$|R
