5|$|The game's story {{focuses on}} the Yoshi clan {{as they attempt to}} rescue newborn {{children}} who have been kidnapped by Kamek. Yoshi's Island DS uses the same updated graphical style as Yoshi Touch & Go but retains the same core gameplay as its Super Nintendo Entertainment System predecessor; but whereas the SNES game featured only <b>Baby</b> Mario and <b>Baby</b> Luigi, DS introduces <b>Baby</b> Peach, <b>Baby</b> Donkey Kong, and <b>Baby</b> Wario, while allowing the player to control <b>Baby</b> Bowser. Each <b>baby</b> bestows a different ability upon Yoshi. The objective of the game is to use these abilities to progress through various themed worlds.|$|E
5|$|As in , <b>Baby</b> Mario and the Yoshi clan must rescue <b>Baby</b> Luigi, who was {{snatched}} by Bowser's minion, Kamek, {{who also}} wanted to kidnap every <b>baby</b> around the world. However, this time the Yoshis have the combined assistance of both <b>Baby</b> Peach and <b>Baby</b> Donkey Kong, {{as well as the}} stork, who escaped the botched capture by the Magikoopa. They later join with <b>Baby</b> Wario and <b>Baby</b> Bowser, who offer their specialized abilities so that the group may proceed. However, <b>Baby</b> Wario's lust for treasure leads him to abandon his duties while <b>Baby</b> Bowser was captured by Kamek (who is actually the future Kamek that appears throughout the forts and castles), and later kicked out by the Adult Bowser, who came from the future, for his <b>baby</b> counterpart insults him. <b>Baby</b> Bowser then joined the group until he noticed Kamek and after him, leaving Yoshi and the other babies to continue their journey. Much later in the game, Kamek's sinister plan for kidnapping the babies around the world has been revealed. He and Bowser travels back in time in search of the star children—seven babies whose hearts possess unimaginable power necessary for him to conquer the universe. Despite kidnapping all of the babies, they couldn't find a single star child. Yoshi's group later arrives at Bowser's castle and <b>Baby</b> Wario and <b>Baby</b> Bowser, arguing for after the treasure from Bowser's castle. They later joined the group and as they arrived at the final room, <b>Baby</b> Bowser betrays them, claiming that Yoshi and the other babies wanted Bowser's treasure in his castle. Yoshi easily defeated him and Kamek arrives, along with Bowser, angered at what Yoshi did to his infant self. Despite this, the babies and Yoshis prevail, in both defeating Bowser, forces Kamek and Bowser retreats to their present time. Yoshi and the babies then retrieving <b>Baby</b> Luigi and the other babies. Bowser's castle then self-destructs but Yoshi and the other babies (with the help of the other storks carrying all of the babies) escaped unharmed and the storks continues to bring all the babies back to their respective home.|$|E

5|$|At 08:30 Robertson and Lalor {{decided to}} take their {{companies}} up <b>Baby</b> 700. Instead of going round to the right like Tulloch, they went straight up the centre, crossed over the summit onto the northern slope and went to ground. A spur on their left, leading to Suvla Bay, was defended by a Turkish trench system. At 09:15 Turkish troops started moving down Battleship Hill, {{and for the next}} hour they exchanged fire. Where the spur joined <b>Baby</b> 700, a group of Australians from the 9th, 11th, and 12th Battalions crossed Malone's Gully and charged the Turkish trench. A Turkish machine-gun on <b>Baby</b> 700 opened fire on them, forcing them back, followed by a general withdrawal of Australian troops. The Turks had secured Battleship Hill and were now driving the Australians off <b>Baby</b> 700.

5|$|Benny Chan {{described}} the filming process {{as some of}} the darkest days of his career, explaining that the <b>baby</b> was a factor beyond his control, and could not work more than eight hours a day. Whenever a scene involving the <b>baby</b> was shot, the crew members had to be silent, communicating in sign language. Benny Chan stated it took time, patience, and money to guide the <b>baby</b> through each shot, and numerous retakes were required due to the baby's constant crying and napping. As a result, production went over budget. Special methods were sometimes used to coax the <b>baby</b> into co-operation. One scene required the <b>baby</b> to suckle Chan's nipple. The <b>baby</b> was initially hesitant, but relented after the crew brushed a large amount of honey onto the nipple.|$|E

40|$|A cross {{sectional}} pilot study using convenient sampling method {{was conducted to}} evaluate various immunological parameters in preterm <b>babies</b> and term <b>babies.</b> Cord blood from 36 preterm and 36 term <b>babies</b> was taken and the following parameters were determined: Immunoglobulin G, A and M, Complement 3 and 4 and NBT. The results showed that NBT was significantly reduced in preterm <b>babies</b> compared to term <b>babies</b> (7. 5 % versus 12. 0 %; p= 0. 001). The complement levels, C 3 (0. 5114 versus 0. 7192 g/l; p< 0. 001) and C 4 (0. 07 versus 0. 14 g/l; p< 0. 001) were significantly lower in preterm <b>babies</b> than in the term <b>babies.</b> The mean IgG level in preterm <b>babies</b> was significantly lower than in term <b>babies</b> (9. 5583 versus 14. 2806 g/l, p< 0. 001). IgM (0. 1 versus 0. 2 g/l; p< 0. 001) and IgA (0. 210 versus 0. 225 g/l; p= 0. 036 l) levels were significantly lower in the preterm than in term <b>babies.</b> In conclusion, we found that NBT reduction, IgG, IgA, IgM, C 3 and C 4 levels were significantly lower in the preterm compared to term <b>babies...</b>|$|R

40|$|Despite the {{extensive}} modifications of cows' milk {{to make an}} infant formula resemble human breast milk, we showed in a previous study that the faecal flora of breast fed <b>babies</b> still differs substantially from that of formula fed <b>babies.</b> This paper describes the effects that differences {{in the distribution of}} whey proteins and caseins exert on the faecal flora. Faecal flora was examined in 33 <b>babies</b> receiving a whey formula, 29 <b>babies</b> receiving a casein formula, and 38 breast fed <b>babies.</b> Subsequently fewer <b>babies</b> in each group were studied at weeks 7, 11, and 15. More whey fed <b>babies</b> were colonised with bifidobacteria at 14 days compared with the casein fed group, more casein fed <b>babies</b> were colonised with bacteroides (at 14 days), and more had a dominant growth of enterococci (at week 7).

5|$|The goal of {{each level}} {{is to protect}} <b>Baby</b> Mario, who rides on Yoshi's back. If Yoshi is hit by an enemy or obstacle, <b>Baby</b> Mario will float off into a bubble and a timer will start {{counting}} down. If the player fails to recover <b>Baby</b> Mario before the counter reaches zero, <b>Baby</b> Mario will be taken away by Koopas and Yoshi will lose a life. The timer can recover up to ten seconds, and Yoshi can collect stars {{to increase the amount}} of time on the counter. However, if Yoshi falls into a bottomless pit, gets crushed, or comes into contact with spikes or lava, he will automatically lose a life. In some areas, players can collect a Starman that transforms <b>Baby</b> Mario into Super <b>Baby</b> Mario. During these areas, players take control of <b>Baby</b> Mario who, for a short period, is invincible, can run on walls and ceilings, and can float using his cape. Additionally, some areas transform Yoshi into various vehicles, such as a helicopter or digger, allowing him to reach otherwise inaccessible areas for a short amount of time.|$|E

The last three babies tend to make the timing for Yoshi's flutter jumping less forgiving and slow down his movement a little bit. The need to switch babies at key points adds a puzzle element to the game.|$|E
