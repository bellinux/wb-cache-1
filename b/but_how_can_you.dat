Weiner criticized the episode's review by Alessandra Stanley of the New York Times, expressing that the publication revealed too much information. [...] He continued: [...] "I'm kind of powerless. It's the bargain you make. I wanted to have press, and {{it was nice to}} get that kind of space with those pictures. The alternative is not to share these things with the press any more – <b>but</b> <b>how</b> <b>can</b> <b>you</b> expect journalists to write about the show if you don’t? It was all very disappointing to me.|$|E
2500|$|When {{asked if}} the sequel will be shot in real time, Reeves stated, [...] "You see, that's a {{difficult}} part: {{we want it to}} be shot like the first <b>but</b> <b>how</b> <b>can</b> <b>you</b> continue that idea successfully for a second time?... We have a lot of affection for the original and the sequel can't just be the same thing. But that is tricky when you need to have a monster destroying stuff once again." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "It wouldn't be very pleasant, I'll admit; <b>but</b> <b>how</b> <b>can</b> <b>you</b> {{prove that}} {{such was the}} case? Who saw the {{beginning}} of the trouble?" ...|$|E

"No doubt English {{are better}} than French--at least I hate them less; but they are all pale-faced liars and Christians, {{and none of them}} shall remain in my land. <b>But</b> <b>how</b> <b>can</b> <b>you</b> tell, boy, that they are good and true men?

6000|$|... "Perhaps you were," [...] he admitted, [...] "for {{the man in}} {{the picture}} was about your style of make-up. <b>But</b> <b>how</b> <b>can</b> <b>you</b> prove it was not a put-up job with the Corona people? How do I know you are not all in the employ of the Corona people?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'Besides, {{it really}} is a very absurd title,' remarked Mrs. Beecher, who was fond of generalising from her six months' {{experience}} of matrimony. 'A husband to A wife' would be intelligible, <b>but</b> <b>how</b> <b>can</b> <b>you</b> know what ANY husband would say to ANY wife? No one can really foretell what a man will do. They really are such extraordinary creatures.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'God {{knows you}} have, ma'am,' {{returned}} Peggotty. 'Then, {{how can you}} dare,' said my mother--'you know I don't mean how can you dare, Peggotty, <b>but</b> <b>how</b> <b>can</b> <b>you</b> have the heart--to make me so uncomfortable and say such bitter things to me, when you {{are well aware that}} I haven't, out of this place, a single friend to turn to?' ...|$|E

I'm compelled to seek your protection from even worse men. You're different from these others. You're educated. You must have had--a--a good mother. Now you're bitter, desperate, terrible. You hate life. You seem to think this charm you see in me will bring you something.

6000|$|... "Oh! I {{hope that}} it may not be war," [...] she said. [...] "I had hoped always that diplomacy, backed by a waiting army, would be sufficient. France at heart is true, I know.

6000|$|It is this,--"when {{the wicked}} man turneth {{away from his}} wickedness that he hath committed, and doeth that which is lawful and right, he shall save his soul alive." [...] It is not said that his soul shall come in a moment to perfect health and strength. No. There are old bad habits to be got rid of, old ties to be broken, old debts (often worse debts than any money debts) to be paid. But he shall save his soul alive. His soul shall not die of its disease. It shall be saved. It shall come to life, and {{gradually}} mend and be cured, and grow from strength to strength, as a sick man mends day by day after a deadly illness, slowly it may be, <b>but</b> surely:--for <b>how</b> <b>can</b> <b>you</b> fail of being cured if your physician {{is none other than}} Jesus Christ your Lord and your God? ...|$|R
6000|$|The Urbane Old Gentleman {{came forward}} with his hat in his hand. He {{looked as if he}} had just landed from the Eighteenth Century. His figure was that of Mr. Edward Gibbon. 'Yes, madam,' he said, in a {{markedly}} deferential tone, fussing about with the rim of his hat as he spoke, and adjusting his pince-nez. 'I was recommended to your--ur--your establishment for shorthand and typewriting. I have some work which I wish done, if it falls within your province. But I am rather particular.

500|$|The boy was curious, {{he was a}} big Munnabhai fan {{and kept}} asking the name of the film. The first working title was 'Munnabhai Meets Mahatma Gandhi,' and Shantanu (Moitra, the music director) told him. So he said, 'Munnabhai to theek hai, yeh Mahatma Gandhi kaun hai?' ('Munnabhai is fine, but who is this Mahatma Gandhi?') So this is the sad state of affairs today. I was shocked. And it's not just the chai-wallah. A few days ago on TV a lot of {{politicians}} were asked India-related questions on the news channels, and I can't believe a lot of them don't know 2 October is Gandhiji's birthday! Many didn't know his first name. They kept saying, 'what's in a name, we respect his ideals,' <b>but</b> come on! <b>How</b> <b>can</b> <b>you</b> not know his name? ...|$|R
6000|$|It {{is a very}} {{inconvenient}} {{habit of}} kittens (Alice had once made the remark) that, whatever you say to them, they ALWAYS purr. 'If they would only purr for [...] "yes" [...] and mew for [...] "no," [...] or any rule of that sort,' she had said, 'so that one could keep up a conversation! <b>But</b> <b>how</b> <b>CAN</b> <b>you</b> talk with a person if they always say the same thing?' ...|$|E
6000|$|P. <b>But</b> <b>how</b> <b>can</b> <b>you</b> {{connect with}} such men and such actions that {{dependence}} of thousands {{on the fate}} of one, which gives so lofty an interest to the personages of Shakespeare, and the Greek Tragedians?

6000|$|... "I 'm sorry, sir; <b>but</b> <b>how</b> <b>can</b> <b>you</b> expect women {{nowadays}} to {{have the}} same views as our grandmothers? We men, by our commercial enterprise, have brought about a different state of things; yet, {{for the sake of our}} own comfort, we try to keep women where they were.

6000|$|... 'Not so, Mr. Waverley,' she replied, {{with great}} sweetness. 'Why should I refuse my brother's valued friend a boon which I am distributing to his whole clan? Most willingly would I enlist every man of honour {{in the cause}} to which my brother has devoted himself. But Fergus has taken his {{measures}} with his eyes open.

5000|$|Silent Night, Bloody Night played {{primarily}} at drive-in theaters beginning in November 1972 before disappearing into obscurity. The film was later shown on Elvira's Movie Macabre, part of WWOR-TV's Fright Night beginning in 1978, {{and became a}} staple of late-night television in the November and December months. Despite the film's dark subject matter and depictions of violence, the network chose to air it at Christmastime each year. Executive Larry Casey commented on it, saying, [...] "Don't get me wrong. I loved White Christmas and traditional holiday movies. <b>But</b> <b>how</b> many times <b>can</b> <b>you</b> watch those things? We always pushed the envelope on Fright Night, and Silent Night, Bloody Night was a great fit. WOR never got any complaints for showing it that I heard about." ...|$|R
40|$|American {{businesses}} spent {{billions of}} dollars on various re-engineering initiatives in the last decade. Re-engineering efforts have produced a wide range of results. While some companies labeled re-engineering efforts as successful, it was an unfulfilled promise for many. As we enter into the digital age, information technology is playing a principal role in bringing process improvement to the forefront of business management consciousness. This rebirth of re-engineering, called 2 ̆ 2 X-engineering, 2 ̆ 2 is the process of redesigning work between a company and its customers, suppliers and partners. This paper argues that those aspiring to do business process redesign must begin to apply the capabilities of the Internet and its related technologies. As with re-engineering, companies have no choice <b>but</b> to X-engineer. <b>How</b> <b>can</b> <b>you</b> increase the odds for success? Here are a few lessons from the front...|$|R
