40|$|Many filed {{inspections}} and steel bridge surveys report that steel plate girder bridges {{are more susceptible}} to corrode at the end due to the accumulation of the water at bearing region. This water pools at the bearing is the result of rain shower and water leakage from the construction joints, which cause the corrosion of <b>bearing</b> <b>stiffener</b> and nearby web. The statistical data shows that only in Japan in more than 70 % corroded steel bridges, corrosion was found near the girder ends, which is primarily due to very aggressive environmental and severe topographical conditions of Japan (Chapter 2). Corrosion at plate girder ends damages the <b>bearing</b> <b>stiffener</b> and nearby web locally and in most of the cases rest of the girder part remains intact. Bearing stiffeners have a very important role in resisting the compressive load. Moreover, besides resisting the compressive load bearing stiffeners are also designed as anchor to balance the horizontal component of tension field action developed in the exterior web and resist the moment transferred by the in plane bending. Thus, any significant damage on <b>bearing</b> <b>stiffener</b> and nearby web may cause the buckling/crushing near the bearing and may also cause a significant loss in the bearing and shear capacity. Further, some field inspection data regarding the steel bridge damages was also collected from the Pakistan (Chapter 3) to assess the feasibility of required action to deal with these steel bridges. The inspection data also depicts the similar plate girder ends damages as reported in Japan. As number old of steel brides are increasing day by day in Japan and all around the world and {{it is very difficult to}} replace the all old brides at the same time along with the construction of the new bridges due to many constraints, i. e. economy of the country, traffic switching problem, lack of expertise and resources, manpower and machinery etc. Moreover, many bridges may have the adequate capacity to be used (Chapter 1). Therefore, all the corroded and old bridges demand the proper evaluation to assess their current performance level e. g. residual bearing and shear capacity so that suitable measure regarding the repair, retrofitting or replacement of these steel bridges can be adopted. The present study focusesiion the experimental and analytical evaluation of bearing and shear capacity of corroded bridges affected by the end panel corrosion. The chapter 4 discusses the experimental program conducted on the large scale plate girder ends specimens, simulated with local corrosion damage on the <b>bearing</b> <b>stiffener.</b> In all, total five plate girder end specimens were used. On one specimen no damage is considered and regarded as the healthy specimen and on the rest of two pair, 50 % thickness of the <b>bearing</b> <b>stiffener</b> is reduced within the damage height “Dh” of 20 mm and 60 mm uniformly and non-uniformly starting from the top face of the bottom flange near the weld seam. The study reported that 20 mm damage height does not change either the ultimate capacity or buckling failure mode. However, a relatively large damage of 60 mm shift the buckling of the stiffener within the damage zones along with the normal buckling within the normal web buckling. The chapter 5 deals with the extension of study to evaluate the bearing capacity of the plate girder ends analytically. For this purpose the test results obtained through the experimental program (conducted and mention in chapter 4) are modeled in a powerful finite element (FE) software ABAQUS. The comparison of the experimental and analytical results are made in term of the load-displacement relationships and deformed buckling modes and analytical results show the good agreement. Four various damage groups, Stiffener damage only, stiffener damage plus the free web end damage, stiffener damage plus interior web damage and stiffener damage plus the web damage at both side of the <b>bearing</b> <b>stiffener</b> were considered in the analytical program. Various residual thicknesses i. e. 75 %, 50 % and 25 etc. were assumed within the different damage heights zones. As the study is targeted to study the effect of the local damage, the maximum damage height is considered as 100 mm (10 % of girder height). True stress-strain relationships are determined by performing the tension test on the coupon cut from the used specimens with isotropic strain hardening rule are utilized in the analytical study. Initial deflections and welding residual stresses are also considered in the finite element (FE) study. Many trial analyses with different damage shapes and forms suggest that a simple uniform rectangular type of the damage with minimum thickness can be utilized in the FE simulation. Further, analytical results conclude that <b>bearing</b> <b>stiffener</b> has very important role in resisting the bearing load and any severe damage may reduce its radiusiiiof gyration along the week axis which may give rise to the stability problem by causing the buckling/ crippling failure at bearing. The results also revealed that the web damage alone does not affect the load carrying capacity significantly however; it reduces the load carrying capacity substantially when web damage is combined with the stiffener damage. The Chapter 6 describes the effect of local corrosion damages at the girder end on its shear capacity. An extensive analytical study is conducted on a four panel plate girder model and similar damage cases are assumed as considered (in Chapter 5) for the bearing capacity analysis. A mild steel with yield stresses equal to 345 Mpa with elastics perfectly plastics (EPP) characteristics under kinematics plasticity rule is used. A small initial out-of-plane deflection is also incorporated while; no residual stresses are considered in the study as they have no effect on the shear capacity. Analytical results indicate that a loss of the <b>bearing</b> <b>stiffener</b> more than 50 % can be fatal for the plate girder and it reduces the anchorage for the tension field action and thus refrains the girder to achieve its full post buckling strength. Also, complete loss of stiffener thickness shifts the failure mode of the girder from shear to buckling. The Chapter 7 comprises of some proposed empirical relationships to estimate ultimate capacity under the shear and compressive loads application. This section also discusses a proposed damage parameter named the “Reduced Thickness Ratio” to assess the buckling failure mode of the plate girder specimen under compressive loadFinally, Chapter 8 consists of a summary of conclusions and recommendations that are drawn from the above mentioned work. Subsequently some recommendations are also made for future research...|$|E

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. The goal of the project was to investigate the shear capacity of dapped ended steel plate girders. Dapped girders with no intermediate transverse-stiffeners between the <b>bearing</b> <b>stiffener</b> and the first interior diaphragm were the focus of this project. The motivation for minimizing the number of stiffeners is to reduce cost and fatigue sensitivity of the girder. The finite element method was used to estimate the ultimate shear capacity. A linear eigenvalue analysis was used to estimate the buckling capacity and to find the buckled mode shape. The mode shape was used to generate a mesh with an imperfection used to run a nonlinear Riks analysis. The Riks analysis resulted in estimated capacities that accounted for material properties and large deformations. Buckling capacities were found for three particular cases. However, several computer codes are presented that allow for the analysis to be completed {{for a wide variety of}} dapped girders. Three main conclusions were drawn from this study. First, it is conservative to assume a full height panel for design purposes. Second, dapped girders without intermediate stiffeners can generate substantial shear capacities. Finally, dapped end panels develop post-buckling strength. This post-buckling strength accounts for a large portion of the shear capacity generated in the dapped end panel...|$|E
40|$|Abstract This paper {{presents}} an investigation on interaction equation between the required flexural strength, M, and the required shear strength, V, of cold-formed C-channels with web holes and <b>bearing</b> <b>stiffeners.</b> The primarily shear condition test {{was employed to}} study total 8 back to back lipped C channel sections of 95 and 100 mm depth when <b>bearing</b> <b>stiffeners</b> and circular holes were placed at center and both ends of specimens. The interaction equation were evaluated via Direct Strength Method, DSM, {{in accordance with the}} American Iron and Steel Institute for the design of cold-formed steel structural members, AISI 2007. A nonlinear finite element model was developed and verified against the test results in terms of failure buckling modes. It was concluded that the M-V interaction equation for specimens with web stiffeners was conservative where these specimens experienced plastic failure mode rather than local (Msl) or distortional (Msd) buckling mode. Moreover, the results indicated that proposed M-V interaction equation calculated by local buckling strength (Msl) adequately predicted the behavior of specimens with circular web holes...|$|R
40|$|Generally, {{the main}} {{objective}} of this thesis has been completed {{for the improvement of}} previous master thesis work. The preparation and background review are accomplished quite sufficient and reflects a good understanding of ice-structure interaction. The nonlinear simulation based on ABAQUS takes a long time, with efforts in model error checking, including material property setting, boundary conditions and tremendous amount of data extract and analysis. The six chosen models could be referred to Chapter 8 about optimization analysis, which gives different strength capacities due to slightly different local scantlings. The comparison indicates it is effective to consider the load <b>bearing</b> with <b>stiffener</b> shear and plate membrane forces as the governing parameters under small/moderate stiffener deflections. In the strength design process, it is recommended to strengthen the stiffener&# 146;s plastic bending capacity by increasing its shear capacity before the plate membrane tensile stress grows greatly. Design guidelines have been developed for preliminary estimation of strength capacity with regards to plastic analysis. The comparison with NLFEA reflects that the hand calculations may roughly offer an efficient way for capacity design. But overestimation shall be dismissed in certain degree by introducing a safety factor. </p...|$|R
50|$|Acceleration (0-60) for the 4-cylinder {{models is}} {{improved}} (around the mid-9-second mark), with comparable fuel efficiency to its predecessor: 23 mpg/city and 30 mpg/hwy for LX and EX models with automatic transmissions. Emissions of Non-Methane Organic Gases (NMOG), {{also known as}} unburned hydrocarbons, produced during engine warm-up are considerably lower. The LX and EX engines produce less than 0.0075 grams per mile, qualifying them for California LEV (Low-Emission Vehicle) status. In California, the Accord EX with the available automatic transmission will produce less than 0.003 grams per mile of NMOG, qualifying it as the first gasoline-powered vehicle to reach ULEV (Ultra-Low Emission Vehicle) status. The five-main bearing block is high-pressure die-cast from aluminum alloy. The walls of the block extend below the centerline of the crankshaft, which helps stiffen the bottom end. FEM (Finite Element Method) computer {{analysis was used to}} arrive at optimum thicknesses for the block ribs and walls in order to minimize engine vibration. Additional bottom-end rigidity comes from a larger, stronger bearing-cap beam that ties directly into the cylinder-block skirt. An aluminum-alloy stiffener has been added between the transmission case and the block, just behind the <b>bearing</b> carrier. The <b>stiffener</b> serves to tie the block and transmission together into a single, reinforced unit. FEM was also used to design this stiffener so that it would not only stiffen the area, but also help minimize high-frequency engine vibration. Finite-element analysis of the Accord's piston design by Honda engineers yielded a new ultra-short, lightweight skirt design, which is very rigid and resistant to vibration and piston slap. Like the V-6 engine the pistons are gravity-cast aluminum alloy and utilize full-floating wrist pins in order to minimize noise. The engine's drop-forged single-plane steel crankshaft and connecting rods have been designed to be stronger and operate with less friction, much like the V-6 components. The I-section, drop-forged steel connecting rods have a completely new design and are considerably lighter than their predecessors (475 g vs. 578 g), which helps to minimize vibration. Big end-bearing journal diameter has been reduced from 48 mm to 45 mm. Rod thickness is down from 24 mm to 20 mm and the bolt size is smaller. Like the V-6 rod bolts, those of the 4-cylinder engine are torqued to the plastic region of the bolt material in order to ensure a solid union between the bearing cap and the connecting rod. The engine block incorporates the Honda-designed second-order balance system that cancels the inertial forces common to large-displacement 4-cylinder engines. The system consists of two parallel shafts {{on either side of the}} crank-shaft, 81 mm (3.19 in.) above its centerline. Driven by a toothed belt, the balance shafts rotate in opposite directions at twice engine speed. Eccentric weights built into the shafts generate inertial forces that counteract the second-order forces created by the motion of the pistons and connecting rods. This Honda system minimizes vibration in the entire rpm range.|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{comprises}} six {{papers with}} the overall theme of measurement, assessment and control of diesel engine noise, with an emphasize on control. The radiation of noise is shown {{to be dominated by}} {{the low end of the}} engine sides and by the engine front. The mode shapes of the crankcase, the oil sump and the timing transmission cover are investigated. The vibrations are measured and analysed through running mode, modal analyses and SEA. The noise radiation is explored in detail with near-field measurements of sound intensity. In the engine front, the noise radiation is shown to have contributions from the timing casing, the oil-sump front and the crankshaft torsion vibration damper. The radiation from the torsion damper is analysed by a regression analysis of measured intensity data and the vibrations of the damper are investigated with a laser-doppler vibrometer. The results show that the damper vibrates in the axial directions with vibration modes that both radiate noise and interfere with the radiation from the engine structure. It is shown that there in the engine front are strong coupled vibration modes between the timing cover and the oil sump front m the frequency range 500 Hz - 1 kHz. The importance of the strong vibration modes in the crankcase and the oil-sump sides is shown. The propagation paths of noise and vibration to the engine front have been examined with an SEA powerflow analysis and by opening the front cover to measure the sound power from the timing gears. The main excitations of the front cover are found to be by engine block vibrations below 1. 25 kHz and by tuning gears noise above 2 kHz. Various constructions to control the noise are tested. Two stiffeners are designed and tested to reduce vibrations m the engine low end, one ladder frame introducing stiffness at the crankcase flange and one bearing beam introducing stiffness at the main <b>bearing</b> caps. The <b>stiffeners</b> have hem evaluated by sound intensity measurements and mobility measurements. The ladder frame gave good noise reductions but the bearing beam merely caused frequency shifts of the bearing modes. A decoupling of the oil sump resulted in significant noise and vibration reductions. The timing cover is modified by increasing the damping and by decrease the radiation efficiency. Various interior panels are tested, like plexiglass and aluminium panels of different thicknesses, a rubber damping layer and a combined rubber/steel-sheet damping layer. A thin plastic sheet has low radiation efficiency and may thereby lower the noise emission. A slightly improved model for calculation of radiation efficiency of small irregularly shaped plates is suggested. The traditional SEA prediction model is shown to be ill-conditioned for engine applications. An improved model using geometric averaging is suggested and evaluated. The results show that the new SEA model is working well for frequencies down to 800 Hz for predictions of damping treatments, decoupling of the oil sump and for power-flow determinations. The concept of equivalent mass is found valuable and validations are made according to the consistency and reciprocity theories. A hemi-anechoic engine laboratory is constructed and evaluated. New efficient low-cost diffusing absorbers have been designed, the performance is evaluated with standard deviation analysis of sound pressure measurements. The performance of the absorbers is found to be compeatable with much more expensive commercial designs. Measured sound intensity in three-dimensional vectors is a powerful tool to identify and illustrate sound fields. When used in near-fields to identify complex noise sources large errors may occur. It is shown that the low relative levels of vector components and the reactivity of the sound field give large errors m repeated measurements. Analyses and comparisons are performed on a simple source and on an engine. A two- and a six-microphone probe were used that were hand-held and robot-controlled. It is concluded dig in point-intensity measurements on engineering noise sources, a 4 - 6 microphone probe and a precision positioner should be used to get reliable measurements.
