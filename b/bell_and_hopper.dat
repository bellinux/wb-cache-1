Bell returns [...] "with a bat in his hand, followed by DeWolf <b>Hopper</b> <b>and</b> De Angelis. The latter has a ball, <b>and</b> as <b>Hopper</b> takes the bat in hand <b>and</b> <b>Bell</b> acts as catcher the former goes through the customary contortion act in pitching, <b>and</b> as <b>Hopper</b> hits the ball he runs off the stage, as if running the bases, and presently returns chased by De Angelis, who passes the ball to Bell as catcher just as Hopper makes a big slide for home base. The slider tumbles <b>Bell,</b> <b>and</b> when he rises from the somersault all three yell out to the audience for judgment ruling, and go off kicking like Anson and York captain Buck Ewing. It is a rich gag and takes immediately", the Brooklyn Eagle said.That year, Bell called Hopper [...] "the biggest baseball crank that ever lived. Physically, of course, he is a corker, but when I say big I mean big morally and intellectually. Why, he goes up to the baseball Polo grounds at One Hundred and Fifty-fifth street after the matinees on Saturday, and he travels this six miles simply to see, perhaps, the two final innings, and any one can imagine the rapidity with which he must scrape off the makeup and get into his street clothes {{in order to secure}} even this much. But he says the Garrison finishes are worth it, and he is perfectly right. Hopper always was a baseball crank, long before the public knew anything about it." ...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{provides}} {{a report on}} the numerical analysis of stress distributions within granular materials held in silos <b>and</b> <b>hoppers.</b> Stress distributions within granular materials stored in silos <b>and</b> <b>hoppers</b> {{have been the subject of}} research for over 100 years, work starting in this field in 1895 (Janssen). Knowledge of stress distributions within the granular materials contained is essential to allow structural design of the silo <b>and</b> <b>hopper</b> shell <b>and</b> attachments, and to allow estimation of likelihood and location of cohesive arch formation. National design codes for silos <b>and</b> <b>hoppers</b> (including BS EN 1993 - 4 - 1 : 2007 Eurocode 3 and DIN 1055 - 6 : 2005 - 03) are based on approximate techniques that assume vertical and horizontal directions of principal stresses, with constant horizontal stress across the silos. According to the knowledge of the author there are no industrial standards that allow calculation of loading on inserts within hoppers. The objective of the research project is to develop algorithms to predict stresses in <b>hoppers</b> <b>and</b> silos using principal stress arc geometry methods, and implementation of these methods in various silo <b>and</b> <b>hopper</b> configurations including those with inserts for the purposes of aiding flow. The research project algorithms are spreadsheet- and QB 64 platform-based, and are able to produce stress distributions within silos <b>and</b> <b>hoppers.</b> This is achieved by extension of the principal stress arc method of analysis. The new algorithms allow prediction of common flow problems and provide new information on structural loading of silos <b>and</b> <b>hoppers,</b> including inserts used to promote flow. The research project models allow estimation of azimuthal stresses within three-dimensional case studies...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Silo {{structure}} {{has been widely}} used in the industries in China, such as chemical engineering, coal industry, light industry, fodder industry and grain industry. Nowadays, reinforced concrete silo structures {{have been the most}} general form. Due to the special features of silo structure, there have been some particular part such as baseboard <b>and</b> <b>hopper.</b> Meanwhile, the level of the baseboard is always high and the configuration of the hopper is complex. Therefore, a lot of construction difficulties and problems have been generated in the progress of silo construction. Based on practical engineering, a series of construction technologies for ultra-high baseboard <b>and</b> <b>hopper</b> of silo were proposed in this paper. With a review to the structure features of the ultra-high baseboard <b>and</b> <b>hopper,</b> an applicative formwork scheme was designed and carried out in the construction. By means of the proposed formwork scheme, some key problems were well solved and the whole engineering quality were ensured. And it has certain reference significance to the construction of this engineering...|$|R
