Error-correcting codes are common especially in wireless communication systems, <b>broadband</b> <b>modem</b> standards and modern copper-based high-speed LANs. The physical layer net bitrate is the datarate measured at a reference point in the interface between the datalink layer and physical layer, and may consequently include data link and higher layer overhead.|$|E

50|$|However, the {{increasing}} popularity of home networking limited {{the prospects for}} DSL softmodems. Many households and small businesses have a router connected to the DSL modem, and all their computers are connected by various types of wired or wireless networks to that router. For that reason, most <b>broadband</b> <b>modems</b> today (cable as well as DSL) are external devices with either Ethernet connections for single PCs or routers, or built-in routers of their own; these interfaces require a full-hardware implementation. Most current <b>broadband</b> <b>modems</b> with USB jacks also have Ethernet jacks, and thus are full-hardware modems.|$|R

To fully utilize the available bandwidth of these DACs, new techniques in modem design must be considered.

50|$|Most {{consumers}} did {{not know}} about networking and routers when broadband became available. However, many people knew that a modem connected a computer to the Internet over a telephone line. To take advantage of consumers' familiarity with modems, companies called these devices <b>broadband</b> <b>modems</b> rather than using less familiar terms such as adapter, interface, transceiver, or bridge. In fact, <b>broadband</b> <b>modems</b> fit the definition of modem because they use complex waveforms to carry digital data. They use more advanced technology than dial-up modems: typically they can modulate and demodulate hundreds of channels simultaneously or use much wider channels than dial-up modems.|$|R
