60|$|I {{snatched}} {{up one of}} their spears and glanced behind me. Marie was climbing on to the chest; I could just see her through the thickening smoke. Another Quabie rushed on. Hans and I received him on the points of our assegais, but so fierce was his charge that they went through him {{as though he were}} nothing, and being but light, both of us were thrown backwards to the ground. I scrambled to my feet again, defenceless now, for the spear was broken in the Kaffir, and awaited the end. Looking back once more I saw that Marie had either failed to get through the window or abandoned the attempt. At any rate she was standing near the chest supporting herself by her right hand. In my despair I seized the <b>blade</b> <b>end</b> of the broken assegai and dragged it from the body of the Kaffir, thinking that it would serve to kill her, then turned to do the deed.|$|E

50|$|This is a normal, usually wooden oar {{to which}} weight {{has been added}} at the inboard end so that the <b>blade</b> <b>end</b> is noticeably lighter and easier for a rower to operate without fatigue. The two methods of adding weight are to either have a much larger section in the oar {{immediately}} next to the handle for {{a distance of about}} 450 mm or to drill an 18 mm hole inside the handle for a distance of about 150 mm and add about 12 oz of lead secured by epoxy resin glue. For a 7 ft oar the balance point is about 12 inches outboard of the rowlock. Often surplus wood is removed from the blade's width and thickness and at the neck between the blade and the shaft to further reduce outboard weight. This type of oar is much better for long-range rowing.|$|E
5000|$|Helicopters also vibrate; an {{unadjusted}} helicopter {{can easily}} vibrate {{so much that}} it will shake itself apart. To reduce vibration, all helicopters have rotor adjustments for height and weight. Blade height is adjusted by changing the pitch of the blade. Weight is adjusted by adding or removing weights on the rotor head and/or at the <b>blade</b> <b>end</b> caps. Most also have vibration dampers for height and pitch. Some also use mechanical feedback systems to sense and counter vibration. Usually the feedback system uses a mass as a [...] "stable reference" [...] and a linkage from the mass operates a flap to adjust the rotor's angle of attack to counter the vibration. Adjustment is difficult in part because measurement of the vibration is hard, usually requiring sophisticated accelerometers mounted throughout the airframe and gearboxes. The most common blade vibration adjustment measurement system is to use a stroboscopic flash lamp, and observe painted markings or coloured reflectors {{on the underside of the}} rotor blades. The traditional low-tech system is to mount coloured chalk on the rotor tips, and see how they mark a linen sheet. Gearbox vibration most often requires a gearbox overhaul or replacement. Gearbox or drive train vibrations can be extremely harmful to a pilot. The most severe being pain, numbness, loss of tactile discrimination and dexterity.|$|E

40|$|Tip {{clearance}} between <b>blade</b> <b>end</b> and shroud {{is inevitable}} in pump operation and {{of great importance}} on pump energy performance and pressure fluctuation. As the tip clearance size increases, the head and efficiency of the mixed flow pump drop accordingly. The simulation {{results show that the}} development of a leakage vortex is observed as the tip clearance increases, and the trajectory of this leakage vortex remains in the same direction along the blade suction side for different tip clearances. With the increase in tip clearance size, the intensity of the leakage vortex is enhanced, and the separation between the main leakage vortex and the secondary leakage vortex is also strengthened. The leakage separation angle near the blade tip remains at the same value of 10 ° for different tip clearance sizes. As for the spectrum analysis, the maximum amplitudes of pressure fluctuations dramatically increase in the impeller when the tip clearance increases from 0. 0 mm to 1. 0 mm, and the dominant frequencies go from 145 Hz to 184 Hz due to the considerable leakage flow...|$|E
40|$|With {{the gradual}} {{increase}} of the thermal power unit capacity, the inlet steam parameters and flow of the turbine also increase gradually, which causes considerable secondary flow loss. Therefore, studying the causes and distribution of secondary flow loss within the level is of great significance to effectively improve the stage internal efficiency of turbine. Take high-pressure stage moving blade of a turbine as the research object, and adopt the k-ωSST model, the SIMPLEC algorithm to numerically simulate the formation and development process of leakage vortex between the tip clearance of the positive bending twisted blade {{and its effect on}} the secondary flow of cascade passage. Results show that relative to the conventional twisted blade, the scope of influence of leakage vortex which the steam flow formed near the suction surface of positive bending twisted blade and the disturbance to passage mainstream become smaller, and the increase of tip clearance has weakened the „C“ type pressure gradient of suction surface of the positive bending twisted blade, increased the thickness of the boundary layer at both ends of blades and the loss of the <b>blade</b> <b>end...</b>|$|E

A small metal brush or optical sensor is positioned so that, as each card goes through the sorter, one column passes under the brush or optical sensor. The holes sensed in that column together with the settings of the sorter controls determine which pocket the card is to be directed to. This directing is done by slipping the card into a stack of metal strips (or chute blades) that run {{the length of the}} sorter feed mechanism. Each <b>blade</b> <b>ends</b> above one of the output pockets, and the card is thus routed to the designated pocket.|$|R
40|$|The {{three-dimensional}} flow {{physical model}} of any {{stage of the}} 20 BZ 4 multistage centrifugal pump is built which includes inlet region, impeller flow region, guide-vane flow region and exit region. The three-dimensional unsteady turbulent flow numerical model is created based on Navier-Stoke solver and standard k-ε turbulent equations. The method of multireference frame (MRF) and SIMPLE algorithm are used to simulate the flow in multistage centrifugal pump based on FLUENT software. The distributions of relative velocity, absolute velocity, static pressure, and total pressure in guide vanes and impellers under design condition are analyzed. The simulation {{results show that the}} flow in impeller is mostly uniform, without eddy, backflow, and separation flow, and jet-wake phenomenon appears only along individual blades. There is secondary flow at <b>blade</b> <b>end</b> and exit of guide vane. Due to the different blade numbers of guide vane and impeller, the total pressure distribution is asymmetric. This paper also simulates the flow under different working conditions to predict the hydraulic performances of centrifugal pump and external characteristics including flow-lift, flow-shaft power, and flow-efficiency are attained. The simulation results are compared with the experimental results, and because of the mechanical losses and volume loss ignored, there is a little difference between them...|$|E
40|$|Studies were {{undertaken}} {{to determine the}} structure of the flow in the <b>blade</b> <b>end</b> wall corner region simulated by attaching two uncambered airfoils on either side of a flat plate with a semicircular leading edge. Detailed measurements of the corner flow were obtained with conventional pressure probes, hot wire anemometry, and flow visualization. The mean velocity profiles and six components of the Reynolds stress tensor were obtained with an inclined single sensor hot wire probe whereas power spectra were obtained with a single sensor oriented normal to the flow. Three streamwise vortices were identified based on the surface streamlines, distortion of total pressure profiles, and variation of mean velocity components in the corner. A horseshoe vortex formed near {{the leading edge of the}} airfoil. Within a short distance downstream, a corner vortex was detected between the horseshoe vortex and the surfaces forming the corner. A third vortex was formed at the rear portion of the corner between the corner vortex and the surface of the flat plate. Turbulent shear stress and production of turbulence are negligibly small. A region of negative turbulent shear stress was also observed near the region of low turbulence intensity from the vicinity of the flat plate...|$|E

Subsequently, steaks from each group were broiled in a General Electric industrial broiler grill to an internal temperature of 63 §C. Steaks were held overnight at 2 §C. Two steaks from each rib were placed into each instrument/core treatment group. Steaks were then divided into three sections identified as: a) lateral, b) medial, and c) central. Three 1. 27 centimeter cores from each section were taken from each steak for a total of nine cores per steak and sheared once through the center. The results indicated that there was a significant difference (p 3 ̆e. 05) between round and square cores for both Warner- Bratzler and Instron. In all mean groups tested, square cores had higher shear values than did round cores.
