60|$|So, for instance, {{having with}} a Lens 4-1/4 Inches broad, and two Prisms on either hand 6-1/4 Feet {{distant from the}} Lens, made such a beam of {{compounded}} Light; to examine the reason of the Colours made by Prisms, I refracted this compounded beam of Light XY with another Prism HIK kh, and thereby cast the usual Prismatick Colours PQRST upon the Paper LV placed behind. And then by stopping any of the Colours p, q, r, s, t, at the Lens, I found that the same Colour would vanish at the Paper. So if the Purple p was stopp'd at the Lens, the Purple P upon the Paper would vanish, {{and the rest of}} the Colours would remain unalter'd, unless perhaps the blue, so far as some purple latent in it at the Lens might be separated from it by the following Refractions. And so by intercepting the green upon the Lens, the green R upon the Paper would vanish, and so of the rest; which plainly shews, that as the white beam of Light XY was compounded of several Lights variously colour'd at the Lens, so the Colours which afterwards emerge out of it by new Refractions are no other than those of which its Whiteness was compounded. The Refraction of the Prism HIK kh generates the Colours PQRST upon the Paper, not by changing the colorific Qualities of the Rays, but by separating the Rays which had the very same colorific Qualities before they enter'd the Composition of the refracted <b>beam</b> <b>of</b> <b>white</b> <b>Light</b> XY. For otherwise the Rays which were of one Colour at the Lens might be of another upon the Paper, contrary to what we find.|$|E

The three horizontal lines represent the soul's three bonds: maya, karma, and anava. Traditionally, the lines are drawn with consecrated ash from burnt cow dung, {{as a reminder that}} merging with the divine is urgent since the physical body is transitory. The dot {{in the center of the}} tripundra is a bindu. When placed on the forehead, the bindu indicates the third eye. It also symbolizes the unmanifest, from which the cosmos emerges, as well as the point at which the many becomes one - the point of concrescence.|$|R

When the comparison is an involved one, the greater force of the metaphor, consequent on its greater brevity, becomes much more conspicuous. If, drawing an analogy between mental and physical phenomena, we say, [...] "As, in passing through the crystal, <b>beams</b> <b>of</b> <b>white</b> <b>light</b> are decomposed into the colours of the rainbow; so, in traversing the soul of the poet, the colourless rays of truth are transformed into brightly tinted poetry"; it is clear that in receiving the double set of words expressing the two halves of the comparison, and in carrying the one half to the other, considerable attention is absorbed. Most of this is saved, however, by putting the comparison in a metaphorical form, thus: [...] "The <b>white</b> <b>light</b> <b>of</b> truth, in traversing the many sided transparent soul of the poet, is refracted into iris-hued poetry." ...|$|R
60|$|Exper. 3. Such another Experiment may be {{more easily}} tried as follows. Let a broad beam of the Sun's Light coming into a dark Chamber {{through a hole in}} the Window-shut be refracted by a large Prism ABC, [in Fig. 3.] whose refracting Angle C is more than 60 Degrees, and so soon as it comes out of the Prism, let it fall upon the white Paper DE glewed upon a stiff Plane; and this Light, when the Paper is {{perpendicular}} to it, as 'tis represented in DE, will appear perfectly white upon the Paper; but when the Paper is very much inclin'd to it in such a manner as to keep always parallel to the Axis of the Prism, the whiteness of the whole Light upon the Paper will according to the inclination of the Paper this way or that way, change either into yellow and red, as in the posture de, or into blue and violet, as in the posture [Greek: de]. And if the Light before it fall upon the Paper be twice refracted the same way by two parallel Prisms, these Colours will become the more conspicuous. Here all the middle parts of the broad <b>beam</b> <b>of</b> <b>white</b> <b>Light</b> which fell upon the Paper, did without any Confine of Shadow to modify it, become colour'd all over with one uniform Colour, the Colour being always the same in the middle of the Paper as at the edges, and this Colour changed according to the various Obliquity of the reflecting Paper, without any change in the Refractions or Shadow, or in the Light which fell upon the Paper. And therefore these Colours are to be derived from some other Cause than the new Modifications of Light by Refractions and Shadows.|$|E
60|$|Let ABC abc [in Fig. 16.] {{represent}} a Prism, {{by which the}} Sun's Light let into a dark Chamber through the Hole F, may be refracted towards the Lens MN, and paint upon it at p, q, r, s, and t, the usual Colours violet, blue, green, yellow, and red, and let the diverging Rays by the Refraction of this Lens converge again towards X, and there, by the mixture of all those their Colours, compound a white according to what was shewn above. Then let another Prism DEG deg, parallel to the former, be placed at X, to refract that white Light upwards towards Y. Let the refracting Angles of the Prisms, and their distances from the Lens be equal, so that the Rays which converged from the Lens towards X, and without Refraction, would there have crossed and diverged again, may by the Refraction of the second Prism be reduced into Parallelism and diverge no more. For then those Rays will recompose a <b>beam</b> <b>of</b> <b>white</b> <b>Light</b> XY. If the refracting Angle of either Prism be the bigger, that Prism must be so much the nearer to the Lens. You will know when the Prisms and the Lens are well set together, by observing if the beam of Light XY, which {{comes out of the}} second Prism be perfectly white to the very edges of the Light, and at all distances from the Prism continue perfectly and totally white like a beam of the Sun's Light. For till this happens, the Position of the Prisms and Lens to one another must be corrected; and then if by the help of a long beam of Wood, as is represented in the Figure, or by a Tube, or some other such Instrument, made for that Purpose, they be made fast in that Situation, you may try all the same Experiments in this compounded beam of Light XY, which {{have been made in the}} Sun's direct Light. For this compounded beam of Light has the same appearance, and is endow'd with all the same Properties with a direct beam of the Sun's Light, so far as my Observation reaches. And in trying Experiments in this beam you may by stopping any of the Colours, p, q, r, s, and t, at the Lens, see how the Colours produced in the Experiments are no other than those which the Rays had at the Lens before they entered the Composition of this Beam: And by consequence, that they arise not from any new Modifications of the Light by Refractions and Reflexions, but from the various Separations and Mixtures of the Rays originally endow'd with their colour-making Qualities.|$|E

40|$|An {{improved}} {{method of}} dot-projection photogrammetry and {{an extension of}} the method to encompass dot-projection videogrammetry overcome some deficiencies of dot-projection photogrammetry as previously practiced. The improved method makes it possible to perform dot-projection photogrammetry or videogrammetry on targets that have previously not been amenable to dot-projection photogrammetry because they do not scatter enough light. Such targets include ones that are transparent, specularly reflective, or dark. In standard dot-projection photogrammetry, multiple <b>beams</b> <b>of</b> <b>white</b> <b>light</b> are projected onto the surface of an object of interest (denoted the target) to form a known pattern of bright dots. The illuminated surface is imaged in one or more cameras oriented at a nonzero angle or angles with respect to a central axis <b>of</b> the illuminating <b>beams.</b> The locations <b>of</b> the dots in the image(s) contain stereoscopic information on the locations of the dots, and, hence, on the location, shape, and orientation of the illuminated surface of the target. The images are digitized and processed to extract this information. Hardware and software to implement standard dot-projection photogrammetry are commercially available. Success in dot-projection photogrammetry depends on achieving sufficient signal-to-noise ratios: that is, it depends on scattering of enough light by the target so that the dots as imaged in the camera(s) stand out clearly against the ambient-illumination component of the image of the target. In one technique used previously to increase the signal-to-noise ratio, the target is illuminated by intense, pulsed laser light and the light entering the camera(s) is band-pass filtered at the laser wavelength. Unfortunately, speckle caused by the coherence of the laser light engenders apparent movement in the projected dots, thereby giving rise to errors in the measurement of the centroids of the dots and corresponding errors in the computed shape and location of the surface of the target. The improved method is denoted laser-induced-fluorescence photogrammetry...|$|R
5000|$|<b>White</b> <b>light</b> is {{directed}} vertically onto a multiple-layer system of a SiO2, a high-refractive Ta2O5 {{and an additional}} SiO2 layer (this additional layer can be chemically modified). The partial <b>beams</b> <b>of</b> the <b>white</b> <b>light</b> are reflected at each phase boundary and then refracted (transmitted). These reflected partial beams superimpose which results in an interference spectrum that is detected using a diode array spectrometer.Through chemical modification the upper SiO2 layer is changed {{in a way to}} allow interaction with target molecules. This interaction causes a change in the thickness of the physical layer d and the refractive index n within this layer. The product of both defines the optical thickness of the layer: n • d.A change in the optical thickness results in a modulation of the interference spectrum. Monitoring this change over time allows to observe the binding behaviour of the target molecules.|$|R

50|$|An {{excitation}} filter is a {{high quality}} optical-glass filter commonly used in fluorescence microscopy and spectroscopic applications for selection of the excitation wavelength of light from a light source. Most excitation filters select light of relatively short wavelengths from an excitation light source, as only those wavelengths would carry enough energy to cause the object the microscope is examining to fluoresce sufficiently. The excitation filters used may come in two main types — short pass filters and band pass filters. Variations of these filters exist {{in the form of}} notch filters or deep blocking filters (commonly employed as emission filters). Other forms of excitation filters include the use of monochromators, wedge prisms coupled with a narrow slit (for selection of the excitation light) and the use of holographic diffraction gratings, etc. <b>beam</b> diffraction <b>of</b> <b>white</b> laser <b>light</b> into the required excitation wavelength (selected for by a narrow slit).|$|R

50|$|Light changes {{speed as}} it moves from one medium to another (for example, from air into {{the glass of the}} prism). This speed change causes the light to be refracted and to enter the new medium at a {{different}} angle (Huygens principle). The degree of bending of the light's path depends on the angle that the incident beam of light makes with the surface, and on the ratio between the refractive indices of the two media (Snell's law). The refractive index of many materials (such as glass) varies with the wavelength or color of the light used, a phenomenon known as dispersion. This causes light of different colors to be refracted differently and to leave the prism at different angles, creating an effect similar to a rainbow. This can be used to separate a <b>beam</b> <b>of</b> <b>white</b> <b>light</b> into its constituent spectrum of colors. A similar separation happens with iridescent materials, such as a soap bubble. Prisms will generally disperse light over a much larger frequency bandwidth than diffraction gratings, making them useful for broad-spectrum spectroscopy. Furthermore, prisms do not suffer from complications arising from overlapping spectral orders, which all gratings have.|$|E
50|$|The diagram on {{the right}} shows an example of {{refraction}} in water waves. Ripples travel from the left and pass over a shallower region inclined {{at an angle to}} the wavefront. The waves travel slower in the more shallow water, so the wavelength decreases and the wave bends at the boundary. The dotted line represents the normal to the boundary. The dashed line represents the original direction of the waves. This phenomenon explains why waves on a shoreline tend to strike the shore close to a perpendicular angle. As the waves travel from deep water into shallower water near the shore, they are refracted from their original direction of travel to an angle more normal to the shoreline.Refraction is also responsible for rainbows and for the splitting of white light into a rainbow-spectrum as it passes through a glass prism. Glass has a higher refractive index than air. When a <b>beam</b> <b>of</b> <b>white</b> <b>light</b> passes from air into a material having an index of refraction that varies with frequency, a phenomenon known as dispersion occurs, in which different coloured components of the white light are refracted at different angles, i.e., they bend by different amounts at the interface, so that they become separated. The different colors correspond to different frequencies.|$|E
