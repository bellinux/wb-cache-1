40|$|This study {{analyzes}} the financial crises in Argentina and Turkey {{in order to}} find out whether a set of six major macroeconomic indicators account for these crises or not. Evidence suggests that in Turkey, an increase in domestic credit <b>is</b> <b>associated</b> with the 1992, 1994 and 2001 financial crises, whereas an increase in CPI <b>is</b> <b>associated</b> with all crisis episodes. Similarly, a decrease in exchange rate <b>is</b> <b>associated</b> with all crises. A fall in the market index <b>is</b> <b>associated</b> with financial crises in 1991, 1992 and 1994. An increase in M 1 <b>is</b> <b>associated</b> only with the crisis in 1992 and a fall in the volume of exports relative to volume of imports <b>is</b> <b>associated</b> with the crisis in 1994. In Argentina, an increase in neither CPI nor domestic credit <b>is</b> <b>associated</b> with any of the financial crises. A decrease in exchange rate <b>is</b> <b>associated</b> with all crises, whereas a fall in the market index <b>is</b> <b>associated</b> with financial crises in 1991 and 2000.

5|$|The stylised lily, or fleur-de-lis (lily flower) {{has long}} <b>been</b> <b>associated</b> with royalty, {{although}} it may originally have been derived from {{the form of an}} iris.

Whatever its exact derivation, it has come to be associated with France and the French monarchy since the earliest Frankish kings. Consequently, it became incorporated into not only French heraldry but also that of many heraldic devices in jurisdictions where there had been historic French influence, such as Quebec and New Orleans. In modern times it appears in many forms, symbolic and decorative, and can be used on compasses to indicate the direction north, as well as the Scouting movement.|$|E
