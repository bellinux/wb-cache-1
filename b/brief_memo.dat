40|$|John and I {{have put}} {{together}} a <b>brief</b> <b>memo</b> which looks at the problem of trying to set a rate for purchase of the geothermal energy. We've taken one situation (three cables, ten year development and high equipment availability) and analyzed the annual rates that HECO could {{afford to pay for}} the geothermal energy under different oil price forecasts. These are breakeven prices that utilize all of the net savings. The interpretation is given in tenus of the ratio of these breakeven prices to reach 75 % of HECO's average production costs. These data highlight the difficulties in establishing rates for this type of large energy development. I've seen similar situations with regard to the importation of Canadian energy into the U. S. With the James Bay hydro plants, prior to the commitment to build the generation and transmssion facilities, the rate situation looked similar to what we are seeing now for the geothermal [...] HWDC projects.

He is the legal force behind over 750 signing statements that President George W. Bush issued when signing bills passed by Congress, expanding the practice relative to other Presidents.

40|$|The Regional Steering Committee (RSC) {{has focused}} {{for over two}} decades on {{estimating}} the number of homeless people in each county and the region. We have often discussed the challenge of finding data to back the trends that providers see every day in shelters, housing and service centers. Early efforts centered on capturing a census of bed use and turn-aways. Statistical efforts using the AFDC-HAP program were done annually during the 1990 's. With more wide-spread use of technology, and after substantial review of research methodologies, HUD began requiring that jurisdictions receiving federal funding for homeless assistance through the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act conduct a point-in-time (PIT) homeless count every two years. But how much do these PIT counts reflect {{what we see in}} our communities? And how do they fit with the other data we see, from HMIS, national studies, and other sources? The RSC has discussed completing the homeless census and evaluating the resulting data several times over the years. In June 2002, we discussed methodologies and the cost-effectiveness of counting the homeless. In May 2004, we looked into the value of HMIS in this effort. In November of the same year, HomeBase presented a <b>briefing</b> <b>memo</b> to the RSC on HUD's suggested methodologies for conducting homeless counts. In March 2005, April 2007, and March 2009, and January 2010 the RSC discussed the homeless count results for those years and provided feedback and impressions of the counts conducted in members' communities. In July 2007, we discussed methodologies for enumerating the homeless population. In 2012, HUD began requiring CoCs to conduct sheltered point-in-time counts in even-numbered years in addition to the existing biennial sheltered/unsheltered count; the RSC discussed approaches to sheltered point-in-time counts in that year. Most recently, in May of this year, we debriefed community processes for the 2013 point-in-time and housing inventory counts as well as plans for 2014.

An AED should ideally be {{designed so that}} minimally trained bystanders can effectively and safely operate the device and deliver the necessary shock. This study evaluates the usability of five AEDs by bystanders with only {{a basic understanding of}} AED functionality and use. Methods- 125 subjects were recruited to participate as bystander rescuers. Each of the five AEDs was evaluated by a different set of 25 randomly assigned subjects. Subjects were first asked to review a <b>brief</b> <b>memo</b> that provided generic AED instructions. Subjects then deployed the assigned AED and delivered a shock to a simulated victim of cardiac arrest. The principle outcome was successful use of the AED, defined as safe and effective defibrillation shock delivery.

As such, we were curious to see how the latest AEO reference-case gas price forecast compares to the NYMEX natural gas futures strip. This <b>brief</b> <b>memo</b> presents our findings. Note that this memo pertains only to natural gas fuel price risk (i. e., the risk that natural gas prices might differ over the life of a gas-fired generation asset from what was expected when the decision to build the gas-fired unit was made). We do not take into consideration any of the other distinct attributes of gas-fired and renewable generation, such as dispatchability (or lack thereof) or environmental externalities. A comprehensive comparison of different resource types [...] which is well {{beyond the scope of this}} memo [...] would need to account for differences in all such attributes, including fuel price risk. Furthermore, our analysis focuses solely on natural-gas-fired generation (as opposed to coal-fired generation, for example), for several reasons: (1) price volatility has been more of a concern for natural gas than for other fuels used to generate power; (2) for environmental and other reasons, natural gas has, in recent years, been the fuel of choice among power plant developers (though its appeal has diminished somewhat as prices have increased); and (3) natural gas-fired generators often set the market clearing price in competitive wholesale power markets throughout the United States. That said, a more-complete analysis of how renewables mitigate fuel price risk would also need to consider coal and other fuel prices.

For the sake of brevity, we do not rehash information (on methodology, potential explanations for the premiums, etc.) contained in our earlier reports on this topic; readers interested in such information are encouraged to download that work from [URL] or, more recently (and briefly), [URL] As was the case in the past four AEO releases (AEO 2001 -AE 0 2004), we once again find that the AEO 2005 reference case gas price forecast falls well below where NYMEX natural gas futures contracts were trading at the time the EIA finalized its gas price forecast. In fact, the NYMEXAEO 2005 reference case comparison yields by far the largest premium [...] $ 1. 11 /MMBtu levelized over six years [...] that we have seen over the last five years. In other words, on average, one would have to pay $ 1. 11 /MMBtu more than the AEO 2005 reference case natural gas price forecast in order to lock in natural gas prices over the coming six years and thereby replicate the price stability provided intrinsically by fixed-price renewable generation. Fixed-price renewables obviously need not bear this added cost, and moreover can provide price stability for terms well in excess of six years...|$|E
40|$|Although {{both the}} {{sensibility}} to kinderschema (baby schema) and the nurturing instinct are biologically innate, {{the formulation of}} the concept of “cute”, and its first cultural manifestations, are relatively new: they date {{back to the beginning of}} the 20 th century, along with a subtle, yet significant, reformulation of the social role of the child and infancy. With the emergence of the kawaii culture in Japan, in the early 70 s, the concept gains a newfound vigor, rising to the status of a national obsession that reveals the intrinsic relation between cuteness and the traumas that shaped the post-war Japanese identity. In Bukimi-tan, I design a personal itinerary whose goal is to compile some aesthetic categories and plastic strategies through which the concept of kawaii becomes an operational model in contemporary artistic production. This “itinerary” – a series of observations, notes, examples, <b>brief</b> considerations, hints, <b>memos,</b> impressions, and small comments – reflects my own preferences and interests at the time the text was written. It aims at outlining affinities and links between the fine arts (focusing mainly on Japanese artists), and Japanse pop (sub) culture(s) – a manga and anime such as Neon Genesis Evangelion or Puella Magika Madoka Magika, subcultures like otaku or rorikon, street fashion like kogyaru and roriita, etc. – based on the connection between cuteness and concepts like “ignoble” (Sianne Ngai), “formless” (Yve-Alain Bois and Rosalind Krauss), “abject” (Julia Kristeva), “uncanny” (Freud, Lacan), “queerness” (Lee Edelman), “kyara” and “database” (Azuma Hiroki). On the other hand, in applying the poetical principles analyzed throughout the text to the dissertation’s own material and conceptual structure, I attempt at a convergence of the artistic praxis and the theoretical investigation in the same physical support, thus integrating this project in a larger reflection on the methodological specificities of a thesis in the field of Paintin...|$|R
