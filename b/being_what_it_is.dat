500|$|The song, if not {{the title}} alone, {{was a source of}} {{irritation}} for those critics who deemed Living in the Material World overly preachy and didactic. In a full-page album review in Melody Maker, Michael Watts summarised his impression of Harrison's spiritual message: [...] "One gets this feeling of George, somewhat remote and rarefied, indicting the world for <b>being</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is,</b> although if anybody could change the world it would be an old Beatle." [...] While noting the song as an autobiographical statement on the singer's [...] "struggle to retain personal dignity and peace of mind", Watts wrote: [...] "He's dealing in lofty sentiments and abstractions; not everyone will want to drink of the cup." ...|$|E
500|$|Opening in 2,362 theaters on March 2, 2007, {{the film}} grossed US$13.3 {{million in its}} opening weekend, placing second and posting a per-theater average of $5,671. The film was outgrossed by fellow opener Wild Hogs and saw a decline of over 50% in its second weekend, losing out to the record-breaking 300. It grossed $33 million in North America and $51 million {{in the rest of}} the world, {{bringing}} its current total to $84 million, above its estimated $65 million production budget. In an interview with Sight & Sound magazine, Fincher addressed the film's low gross at the North American box office: [...] "Even with the box office <b>being</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is,</b> I still think there's an audience out there for this movie. Everyone has a different idea about marketing, but my philosophy is that if you market a movie to 16-year-old boys and don't deliver Saw or Seven, they're going to be the most vociferous ones coming out of the screening saying 'This movie sucks.' And you're saying goodbye to the audience who would get it because they're going to look at the ads and say, 'I don't want to see some slasher movie.'" ...|$|E

2500|$|In a poem on Southey, Landor praised his friend, [...] "In Thalaba, Kehama and Roderick {{the most}} inventive Poet/ In lighter {{compositions}} the most diversified." [...] An anonymous {{review in the}} February 1811 Monthly Mirror claimed [...] "The plot is ... powerfully spirit-stirring, but not interesting... because it is utterly impossible for the feelings to travel with the persons of a drama so constituted as the present... It seems Mr. Southey labours under a great disadvantage, through the choice of his machinery." [...] It continued, [...] "Having given this opinion, we are now free to confess that the poet's art is, in the terrific, prodigiously displayed throughout, {{and we have no}} doubt that if Mr. Southey's love of eccentricity had not overcome his better taste, he would have chosen such a machinery, and so conducted his story, as not only to have agitated the nerves, but to have come home to heart, and rested there. <b>Being</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is,</b> however, we pronounce it a splendid specimen of a daring poetical imagination, fed and supported by vast sources of knowledge and observation." ...|$|E

Houbraken felt he received less for a painting than he deserved, because his work was of a very high quality.

This is a completely wrong line of thinking: to view propaganda as still <b>being</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> in 1850 is to cling to an obsolete concept of man and of the means to influence him; <b>it</b> <b>is</b> to condemn oneself to understand nothing about propaganda.

[...] "No country where the saboteurs find shelter and through whose territory they pass {{on their way to}} Israel can be exempt from responsibility." [...] What Eshkol left unsaid was his certainty that, with the so-called Arab unity <b>being</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>was,</b> Jordan would find itself with far less Arab support than Syria, which was much closer to Egypt's Gamal Abdel Nasser. Jordan's Arab partners did wait until the Israelis had withdrawn before making indignant vows of support.|$|R
