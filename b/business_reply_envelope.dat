40|$|Following {{a number}} of studies on the factors that might affect {{response}} rates in cross-national research, this work examines the types of incentives mentioned by international business scholars in mail surveys as well as how the use of such incentives affects the response rate. This work uses a content analysis of articles published in four leading international business journals in the period of 2000 - 2009. The results show that out of 217 studies under examination only 42 mentioned any type of incentives for enhancing the response rate. The most common incentives used by authors are confidentiality and anonymity, followed by a <b>business</b> <b>reply</b> <b>envelope</b> and a free report. Generally speaking, the results demonstrate that studies reporting incentives achieve, on average, a lower response rate from those that do not report them...|$|E
40|$|Registered nurses (RN's) {{were chosen}} as {{relevant}} subects {{for a study}} of the social psychological consequences of shift work. Most nurses work in hospitals which are staff-ed 24 hours a day in three shifts: daytime, 7 am- 3 pm; evening, 3 - 11 pm; and night, 11 pm- 7 am. Nurses are convenient subjects for survey research since an RN must be registered in the state where they reside and are employed, and the Registry is a public document. Two probability samples of 300 each were drawn from the Oklahoma Registry, and those living in the Tulsa area were included in the sampling frame. The first group was surveyed in October 1975, and 300 more were con-tacted in January 1976, by mailed question-naire. The mailed packet included a question-naire, a cover letter, a <b>business</b> <b>reply</b> <b>envelope</b> and a return postcard preaddressed to the author, to be returned independently of the questionnaire. Its function was to show that the respondent had returned the question-naire without breaching anonymity. Tw...|$|E
40|$|Objective. This {{study is}} being {{conducted}} to assess pharmacists’ attitudes towards prescription monitoring programs (PMPs) and their utility in Florida. Background. Florida’s drug abuse problem has reached new levels with six people dying each day due to prescription drug overdoses. Florida recently became the 39 th state to enact legislature {{to implement a}} PMP. Methods. For this study, 5, 000 Florida licensed pharmacists will be randomly selected through the Florida Department of Health Licensee Data Center {{to participate in a}} ten-question voluntary and anonymous self-administered survey. The survey was pre-tested by a small group of 35 Florida pharmacists to validate the instrument. Attitudes towards implementation of a PMP will be correlated with years of practice, primary area of practice, and prior knowledge of PMPs. The survey will be mailed to individuals with a <b>business</b> <b>reply</b> <b>envelope</b> provided to maintain anonymity and increase the response rate. Participants will have approximately eight weeks to complete the survey. Reminder postcards will be sent three weeks after the surveys are mailed. A mixed model will be utilized for the statistical analysis. Grants. This study is funded by an HPD internal research grant...|$|E

40|$|Twins {{taking part}} in two {{unrelated}} studies were sent aquestionnaire together with a self-addressed envelope that either carried one or multiple (up to 5) stamps to the same value. The unprompted proportion of questionnaires returned (before commencement of telephone reminder calls) was increased from 62 % to 71 % in one study, and from 43 % to 52 % in the other study (test for common odds ratio in studies, p = 0. 04). A large number of procedures to improve response rate to mailed questionnaire surveys are described in the survey lit-erature (Linsky, 1975; Moser & Kalton, 1979; Fowler, 1993). These include optimisation of questionnaire layout and length, {{the use of an}} introductory or approach letter which can be separately mailed or mailed under the same cover, introductory telephone calls, and the provision of prepaid return envelopes. It has been shown in several experiments that subjects are more likely to return a ques-tionnaire if a stamped return envelope is provided, as opposed to a <b>business</b> <b>reply</b> <b>envelope</b> (Linsky, 1975). Presumably in the latter case the perception is that the researcher does not lose financially if the subject fails to return the envelope. In a similar vein, increasing the number of stamps on the questionnaire mail-out envelope has been shown to increase the response rate over those sent with a single stamp (Linsky, 1975). In the present study, we compare the response rate to a “supranormal ” stimulus by increasing the number of postage stamps from one up to five per pre-addressed return envelope...|$|E
40|$|Survey {{research}} with the study population of the National Athletic Trainers 2 ̆ 7 Association membership is increasing in prevalence. Unfortunately, many researchers have not achieved optimal response rates necessary for unbiased generalization to the population. The {{primary purpose of the}} study was to determine if characteristics and responses of non-respondents are comparable to that of respondents. A secondary purpose is to determine if mail and web-based modes produce different response rates, responses, and characteristics of responders. One thousand Certified Athletic Trainers were asked to complete a survey with 30 Likert scale questions about their attitudes regarding continuing education and seven demographic questions. For the mail group, the first contact included a cover letter, the survey, and a <b>business</b> <b>reply</b> <b>envelope.</b> This was followed by a reminder postcard fourteen days later. After another two weeks, the survey and letter was re-mailed. Finally, an additional reminder postcard was distributed after fourteen more days passed. The web-based group received a message every two weeks for the two-month period via e-mail. Completion of the survey required entering an access code as specified in the first and third e-mails at the identified website. Non-responders were contacted a fifth time and presented with the survey administered via the opposite mode. A percentage of individuals that still did not respond were contacted via telephone to obtain information on non-response. Logistic regression analyses revealed that the treatment condition was the most consistent at predicting version of survey response (early (first contact or reminder), middle (third or fourth contact), mixed (fifth contact via opposite mode), or non-response). The mail group was more likely to respond to the early and middle versions, while the web-based group was more likely to return the mixed method version. Some demographic variables, gender and highest degree earned, played a role in survey version returned, however; the survey responses did not influence survey version response. Overall, response rate is higher for mail surveys compared to Internet surveys, females compared to males, and individuals with terminal or master 2 ̆ 7 s degrees compared to bachelor 2 ̆ 7 s, however; response rate or time did not influence the survey results. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Studies {{largely from}} the market {{research}} field suggest that {{the inclusion of a}} stamped addressed envelope, rather than a pre-paid <b>business</b> <b>reply,</b> increases the response rate to mail surveys. The evidence that this is also the case regarding patient mail surveys is limited. Methods The aim {{of this study is to}} investigate whether stamped addressed envelopes increase response rates to patient mail surveys compared to pre-paid <b>business</b> <b>reply</b> <b>envelopes</b> and compare the relative costs. A sample of 477 initial non-responders to a mail survey of patients attending breast clinics in Greater Manchester between 1 / 10 / 2002 – 31 / 7 / 2003 were entered into the trial: 239 were randomly allocated to receive a stamped envelope and 238 to receive a pre-paid envelope in with their reminder surveys. Overall cost and per item returned were calculated. Results The response to the stamped envelope group was 31. 8 % (95 % CI: 25. 9 % – 37. 7 %) compared to 26. 9 % (21. 3 % – 32. 5 %) for the pre-paid group. The difference (4. 9 % 95 % CI: - 3. 3 % – 13. 1 %) is not significant at α = 0. 05 (χ 2 = 1. 39; 2 tailed test, d. f. = 1; P = 0. 239). The stamped envelopes were cheaper in terms of cost per returned item (£ 1. 20) than the pre-paid envelopes (£ 1. 67). However if the set up cost for the licence to use the pre-paid service is excluded, the cost of the stamped envelopes is more expensive than pre-paid returns (£ 1. 20 versus £ 0. 73). Conclusion Compared with pre-paid <b>business</b> <b>replies,</b> stamped <b>envelopes</b> did not produce a statistically significant increase in response rate to this patient survey. However, the response gain of the stamped strategy (4. 9 %) is similar to that demonstrated in a Cochrane review (5. 3 %) of strategies to increase response to general mail surveys. Further studies and meta analyses of patient responses to mail surveys via stamped versus pre-paid envelopes are needed with sufficient power to detect response gains of this magnitude in a patient population. </p...|$|R
