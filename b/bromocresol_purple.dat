40|$|International {{audience}} Problem statement: Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB) {{is characterized}} by fastidious nutritional requirements leading {{to the need for}} complex and rich media to allow growth. Owing to their complex requirements which also varied significantly with species, the formulation of selective media for LAB is difficult. Approach: A culture medium for LAB was previously developed based on deproteinated whey supplemented with yeast autolysate and de-lipidated egg yolk. Based on this previously developed medium, some selective media were formulated and their potential for LAB selection and enumeration was examined. Results: In this study, it was considered as a basis to define a selective medium, by adding a pH indicator and some inhibitory compounds to select the LAB flora of various dairy products including milk, disinfected or not, fermented milk and yoghurt. The addition of sodium azide to inhibit the contamination flora, including Gram negative floraand <b>purple</b> <b>bromocresol</b> allowed a direct selection of the Gram + and lactose + flora. An acidic pH (5. 0) can also be helpfully considered after protein hydrolysis to avoid protein denaturation. Conclusion: To complete this study, additional work is needed concerning the improvement of culture medium selectivity by considering other inhibitors, of the Gram negative flora (like lithium chloride for instance), of fungi (like actidione), of the Gram positive flora (excepting the LAB flora) and an association of these inhibitors...|$|R

For indicator stop bath - a stop bath that changes colours to indicate when the stop bath is exhausted and no longer effective - a pH indicator like <b>bromocresol</b> <b>purple</b> is used to determine when the solution has become too alkaline to use.

5000|$|As a {{preliminary}} test indicating infection, plucked hairs and skin and nail scrapings {{can be directly}} viewed under a microscope for detection of fungal elements. T. rubrum cannot be distinguished from other dermatophytes in this direct examination. It can distinguished in vitro from other dermatophytes by means of characteristic micromorphology in culture, usually consisting of small, tear-drop-shaped microconidia, {{as well as its}} usual blood-red colony reverse pigmentation on most growth media. In addition, the <b>Bromocresol</b> <b>purple</b> (BCP) milk solid glucose agar test can be used to distinguish it. Different Trichophyton species release different amounts of ammonium ion, altering the pH of this medium. In this test, medium supporting T. rubrum remains sky blue, indicating neutral pH, until 7 to 10 days after inoculation. In primary outgrowth on Sabouraud dextrose agar with cycloheximide and antibacterials, contaminating organisms may cause confusion, as T. rubrum colonies deprived of glucose by competing contaminants may grow without forming the species' distinctive red pigment. Both antibiotic-resistant bacteria and saprotrophic fungi may outcompete T. rubrum for glucose if they contaminate the sample. Red pigment production can be restored in such contaminated isolates using casamino acids erythritol albumin agar (CEA). T. rubrum cultures can be isolated on both cycloheximide-containing media and cycloheximide-free media. The latter are conventionally used for the detection of nail infections caused by non-dermatophytes such as Neoscytalidium dimidiatum. A skin test is ineffective in diagnosing active infection and often yields false negative results.|$|E
50|$|In {{preparing}} {{samples for}} diagnosis, a scraping {{of the skin}} from the active border of infection is taken, and is inoculated directly onto the test medium. Trichophyton verrucosum is auxotrophic for inositol and thiamine, and as such can be distinguished from other dermatophytes by observing strong growth on Trichophyton agar 3 (a medium rich in thiamine and inositol) and none to weak growth on Trichophyton agars 1 and 2 (deficient in these nutrients). It will also grow on Sabouraud agar, but only {{with the addition of}} yeast extract (which provides the inositol and thiamine it requires). In <b>Bromocresol</b> <b>purple</b> (BCP) milk solids glucose agar, a medium used to distinguish the dermatophytes from bacteria and other organisms by evaluating ammonium production during proteolysis, T. verrucosum produces a weakly alkaline result (faint purple) and clearing of milk solids with a characteristic halo on the periphery. Negative test results occur for the urease test, hair perforation test, and casamino acids erythritol albumin agar. In conjunction to physiological tests, contact with cattle should also be used as a criterion due to the zoophilic and occupational nature of the disease. Otherwise, misdiagnosis as pyoderma or bacterial folliculitis can occur, with the prescribed antibacterial treatment having no effect. Indeed, one study found that people infected with T. verrucosum had to visit a physician on average of 2.5 times, with 25 days elapsing, before a proper diagnosis was obtained. This may lead to an underestimation of the true number of cases, as many people will recover from the disease before obtaining a proper diagnosis. Looking at the stratum corneum under a microscope may also aid in diagnosis, which is done by adding 10% KOH solution and a Periodic acid-Schiff stain. Swollen chlamydospores 5-10 μm in diameter will appear outside the hair shaft, while skin samples will have swollen spores mixed with dermatophyte filaments.|$|E
40|$|Summary: The {{determination}} of serum albumin with the dye reagent <b>bromocresol</b> <b>purple</b> was investigated. We found that <b>bromocresol</b> <b>purple</b> {{is not a}} specific reagent for albumin, but that serum proteins in the a-, 0 -, and 7 -globulin fractions also react with this dye. Similar results were obtained for bromocresol green. Furthermore {{there is a great}} difference in absorbance between human and bovine albumin solutions (having the same concentration) when using the <b>bromocresol</b> <b>purple</b> reagent. Most probably this {{is a result of the}} difference in interaction of the reagent with the substrate. Although the standard curves with the <b>bromocresol</b> <b>purple</b> method were more linear (especially at higher albumin concentrations) than those obtained with the bromocresol green method, we still prefer the bromocresol green technique to the bromooresol purple technique, because its results are more comparable with those of other methods. Moreover in quality control and calibration procedures, strong deviations from the recommended values are obtained when non-human sera are analyzed with the <b>bromocresol</b> <b>purple</b> method.

30|$|<b>Bromocresol</b> <b>Purple</b> (BCP or 5 ’, 5 ”-dibromo-o-cresolsulfophthalein pKa 6.3), is a halo chromic {{chemical}} compound which causes {{the color of}} the solution to change depending on the pH and therefore is used to determine pH (acidity or basicity) of the substrate visually. <b>Bromocresol</b> <b>Purple</b> is a detector for hydronium ions (H 3 O+) or hydrogen ions (H+) in the Arrhenius model. For pH indicators that are weak proteolytes, the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation derived from the acidity constant, states that when pH equals the pKa value of the indicator, both species are present in 1 : 1 ratio. If pH is above the pKa value, the concentration of the conjugate base is greater than the concentration of the acid, and the color associated with the conjugate base dominates. If pH is below the pKa value, the converse is true.|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY. Pooled patient's serum {{selected}} {{to have a}} wide range of albumin concentrations was analysed for albumin by bromocresol green with both long and short incubation times and also by <b>bromocresol</b> <b>purple.</b> Total protein. colloid osmotic pressure. calcium and magnesium were also measured. There were strong linear correlations between albumin measured by the three methods. Albumin values by bromocresol green with a short incubation time (1 · 5 min) averaged 5 giL higher than those by <b>bromocresol</b> <b>purple</b> at all albumin concentrations. Colloid osmotic pressure correlated less strongly with total protein and with albumin by <b>bromocresol</b> <b>purple</b> than with albumin by the two bromocresol green methods. There {{were no significant differences between}} the correlation coefficients of calcium or magnesium with total protein and with albumin measured by the three methods. <b>Bromocresol</b> <b>purple</b> has no advantage over bromocresol green with a short incubation time for the clinical purposes for which albumin is measured: to detect abnormality. monitor change. predict colloid osmotic pressure and adjust calcium and magnesium for abnormal protein concentrations. A recent review of the measurement of albumin in serum and plasma concluded that bromocre-sol purple (BCP) is the dye-binding method of choice for analysers with individual channel calibration I because a major problem with bromocresol green (BCG) is the overestimation of albumin due to dye-binding by other plasma proteins. ?
