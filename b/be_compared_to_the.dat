5|$|After World War II, Skopje greatly {{benefited from}} Socialist Yugoslav {{policies}} which encouraged {{industry and the}} development of Macedonian cultural institutions. Consequently, Skopje became home to a national library, a national philharmonic orchestra, a university and the Macedonian Academy. However, its post-war development was altered by the 1963 earthquake which occurred 26 July. Although relatively weak in magnitude, it caused enormous damage in the city and can <b>be</b> <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> 1960 Agadir earthquake. The disaster killed 1,070 people, injuring 3,300 others. 16,000 people were buried alive in ruins and 70% of the population lost their home. Many educational facilities, factories and historical buildings were destroyed.|$|E
5|$|As their landscapes {{have similar}} scenic qualities, AONBs may <b>be</b> <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{national}} parks of England and Wales. AONBs are created {{under the same}} legislation as the national parks, the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949. In contrast to national parks, which have their own authorities and legal power to prevent unsympathetic development, very few statutory duties are imposed on the local authorities within an AONB. However, further regulation and protection of AONBs was added by the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000.|$|E
5|$|At {{the tenth}} RA I {{tropical}} cyclone committee held during 1991, it was {{recommended that the}} intensity classifications be changed ahead of the 1993–94 tropical cyclone season. Specifically {{it was decided that}} the classifications: Weak Tropical Depression, Moderate Tropical Depression and Severe Tropical Depression would be changed to Tropical Depression, Moderate Tropical Storm and Severe Tropical Storm. This change was implemented ahead of the 1993–94 tropical cyclone season. The United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center also monitors the basin, and issues warnings on significant tropical cyclones on behalf of the United States Government. These warnings use a 1-minute sustained wind speed and can <b>be</b> <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale, however, regardless of intensity in this basin the JTWC labels all systems as tropical cyclones.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to the national meteorological services of each nation, the United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center monitors the basin, and issues warnings on significant tropical cyclones for the United States Government. These warnings use a 1-minute sustained wind speed and can <b>be</b> <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale, however, the JTWC uses their own scale for intensity classifications in this basin. These classifications are Tropical Depression, Tropical Storm, Typhoon and Super Typhoon. In addition, the Taiwan Central Weather Bureau has its own scale in Chinese but uses the Typhoon Committee scale in English.|$|E
5|$|The Blackdown Hills have, since 1991, been {{designated}} as an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB). As {{they have the}} same landscape quality, AONBs may <b>be</b> <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> national parks of England and Wales. AONBs are created under the same legislation as the national parks: the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949. However, National Parks, unlike AONBs, have their own authorities and have special legal powers to prevent unsympathetic development. By contrast, there are very limited statutory duties imposed on local authorities within an AONB. Further regulation and protection of AONBs was added by the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000.|$|E
5|$|Woodward {{asserts that}} the U.S. is {{implementing}} a secret killing program in Iraq targeting designated terrorists and that this program in large parts accounts for the significant drop in violence in the country. This program may have been being carried out by Task Force 77. The secrecy surrounding the program can, according to Woodward, in some ways <b>be</b> <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Manhattan Project during World War II in which the atomic bomb was developed amidst an unprecedented veil of secrecy. Following {{the publication of the}} book, U.S. National security adviser Stephen Hadley acknowledged the existence of the described strategy.|$|E

5|$|Bird {{collections}} {{are used for}} a wide variety of purposes. All biological species including those of birds are represented by a holotype, the vast majority of which are full specimens (mostly skins) and in modern times explicitly designated in the original description of the taxon. All other putative members of the species may <b>be</b> <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> holotype to confirm their identification. Rigorous studies of avian taxonomy are based on specimens from bird collections. Taxonomic studies rely on morphological and genetic characters to determine species limits and evolutionary relationships. Museum specimens have been the preferred source for scoring these s, as they allow studies to be replicated – anyone may go back and repeat the study using the same specimens to verify the conclusions. However, it has alternatively been argued that such re-examination can be undertaken from archived photographs without killing the study piece.|$|E
5|$|Development of the I-6 (Istrebitel—fighter) {{began in}} September 1928 with a {{deadline}} for delivery for the first prototype of 1 August 1929 after the first prototypes of the Polikarpov I-3 were completed. Although the new fighter shared many {{of the characteristics of}} the earlier design, including the staggered sesquiplane, single-bay, layout of the wings, it was a new design which used a nine-cylinder, single-row, air-cooled Bristol Jupiter radial engine rather the water-cooled inline engine of its predecessor. It was designed by the OSS (—Landplane Department), later redesignated as OPO-1 (—Experimental Department) of Aviatrest ("Aviation Trust") under the supervision of Nikolai Polikarpov, head designer of the department. It was originally intended to <b>be</b> <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> I-3, but this was changed to an evaluation of construction methods with the wooden construction I-6 compared to the mixed construction Polikarpov I-5. Both aircraft used the Jupiter VI engine for which a license had recently been negotiated.|$|E
5|$|The {{architecture}} of the tomb is praised and also derided; it is derided {{for the lack of}} proportioning of its various units and use of poor material for construction. Reginald Heber, who was Bishop of Calcutta between 1823 and 1826, based on the light brown colour of the stone used, had observed that the tomb has the “colour of potted meat”. Even ASI has observed that the marble used for ornamentation in the towers though pleasing is “rather florid”. Another observation is that the tomb can not <b>be</b> <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Taj Mahal or the Humayun Tomb, as, {{at the time it was}} built, the Mughal Empire was on the decline and sandstone had to be used and lines were set improperly and the quality appeared “thread bare”.|$|E
