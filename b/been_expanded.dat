Mendeleev's periodic table has since <b>been</b> <b>expanded</b> and refined with the discovery or synthesis of further new elements and the development of new theoretical models to explain chemical behaviour.|$|E

5|$|The {{native forest}} in the Canberra region was almost wholly {{eucalypt}} species and provided a resource for fuel and domestic purposes. By the early 1960s, logging had depleted the eucalypt, and concern about water quality led to the forests being closed.

Since then, plantations have <b>been</b> <b>expanded,</b> with the benefit of reducing erosion in the Cotter catchment, and the forests are also popular recreation areas.|$|E
