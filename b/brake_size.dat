50|$|Upon hearing Richardsons assessment, Black {{asked him}} to help {{redesign}} the car. Richardson tuned and modified the engine and worked with Triumph engineers to increase the <b>brake</b> <b>size,</b> modify the front suspension, and experiment with rear springs and shocks. A stronger frame with improved torsional rigidity was designed. Meanwhile, the stylists widened and lengthened the car for more interior room and boot space, mounting the spare wheel inside the boot. The result was the Triumph TR2, introduced in March 1953 at the Geneva Motor Show.|$|E

5000|$|For 1968, all new US {{cars were}} {{equipped}} with {{front and rear}} side marker lights. Chrysler bumpers, grille, hood, deck lid, rear fascia and lamps all changed significantly, although side sheet metal, wagon tailgate and rear lamps remained the same.

50|$|Standard {{road drop}} {{handlebars}} (including track, cyclocross and touring bars) use a 23.8 mm grip/lever diameter, which is matched only to road bike type shifters or brake levers. This diameter {{is usually not}} important for grips since these bars most often are wrapped in tape. An exception are one-piece track grips, which are sized to fit the 23.8 mm bar diameter (and, therefore, would not fit a mountain bike handlebar). Cyclocross <b>brake</b> levers are <b>sized</b> to fit drop style bars, and would also not fit a mountain bike handlebar.|$|R
50|$|For 1967, Town & Country {{would become}} a model {{designation}} for {{the one and only}} wagon in the Chrysler lineup. Torqueflite AT, power steering and power brakes were standard, as were exterior trim and vinyl bench seat interior shared with the Newport series. Individual buckets with center armrest and passenger recliner from the New Yorker option list remained available for one more model year. Chrysler’s 2BBL regular fuel 383 V8 became the standard engine, with the 4BBL, dual exhaust, premium fuel 383 V8 available as an option. New in all Chryslers for 1966, the 3.75” stroke RB engine was bored to 4.32” yielding 440 cubic inches. With a 10.0:1 compression ratio, premium fuel, a 4BBL carb and dual exhausts, the 440 cu. in. V8 produced 350 HP and was the top power option for Town & Country. Also available {{for the first time on}} all large Chryslers were front disc brakes, which required 15” wheels with unique wheel covers. With optional front discs, T&C wagons wore size 8.45x15 extra load range tires. With standard drum <b>brakes,</b> tire <b>size</b> was 9.00x14.|$|R
40|$|Wear {{and related}} {{characteristics}} of friction and temperature developed during <b>braking</b> of <b>size</b> 22 x 5. 5, type aircraft tires are studied. The testing technique involved gearing the tire to a driving {{wheel of a}} ground vehicle to provide operations at constant slip ratios on asphalt, concrete, and slurry-seal surfaces. Data were obtained over the range of slip ratios generally attributed to an aircraft braking system during dry runway operations. The {{results show that the}} cumulative tire wear varies linearly with distance traveled and the wear rate increases with increasing slip ratio and is influenced by the runway-surface character. Differences in the wear rates associated with the various surfaces suggest that runways can be rated on the basis of tire wear. The results also show that the friction coefficients developed during fixed-slip-ratio operations are in good agreement with those obtained by other investigators during cyclic braking, in that the dry friction is insensitive to the tire tread temperature is shown to increase with increasing slip ratio and, at the higher ratios, to be greater during braking on asphalt and slurry seal than on concrete...|$|R
40|$|A {{critical}} aspects for {{the reliability}} of the braking system of rail vehicles is the brake performance under wet conditions. Especially in case of modern disc brake systems that are designed for high performance braking in order to increase the max. speed i. e. for coaches, high speed train or modern freight waggons the wet performance becomes a most critical issue. Therefore the goal of the project was to get {{a better understanding of the}} friction behaviour under wet conditions and to develop friction materials that show nearly no wet sensitivity. Wet friction tests have been performed on small samples as well as on full <b>size</b> <b>brake</b> pads. Based on these investigations three different friction materials for various applications on rail vehicles have been developed and presented to sundry rail authorities. (orig.)

5000|$|By 1970, Excalibur {{was well}} {{established}} but had engendered {{the birth of}} numerous imitators who were helping satisfy {{the demands of a}} market that the limited Excalibur production alone could not. The Stevens brothers didn't want to increase their production rate for fear it would adversely affect the impeccable build quality that they wanted the public to enjoy. So they launched the Excalibur Series II, an all new car {{despite the fact that it}} perpetuated the S1 styling. As the old Studebaker Lark chassis was no longer built, David designed a new ladder chassis which had a two-inch longer wheelbase. The suspension components were borrowed from the Corvette, as was the four-disc <b>braking</b> system. Tire <b>size</b> went up and the rubbers were mounted on wheels especially designed for the car. The 327 ci. inch (5400 cc) V-8 engine was replaced by a new 350 cu. inch (5700 cc) unit which, with its anti-pollution equipment still managed to develop a healthy 300 hp. The Muncie four-speed manual transmission became standard, with a Turbo-Hydramatic three-speed unit available as an option.|$|R
40|$|Purpose. As {{part of the}} {{scientific}} paper {{it is necessary to}} study the waveform impact of the braking cylinders filling on longitudinal train dynamics at different modes of braking. At this one should estimate the level of maximum longitudinal forces and <b>braking</b> distance <b>size</b> in freight cars of various lengths. Methodology. In this paper we attempt to approximate the actual diagram of braking cylinders filling with rational functions of varying degrees. In selection of coefficients in the required functions the highest values of the longitudinal forces and braking distances were used as controlled parameters. They were compared with similar values obtained as a result of experimental rides. The level of longitudinal forces and braking distances amount were evaluated by means of mathematical modeling of train longitudinal vibrations, caused by different braking modes. Findings. At mathematical modeling was assumed that the train consists of 60 uniform four-axle gondola cars, weight of 80 tons, equipped with air dispenser No. 483 included in the median operation, composite braking blocks, and one locomotive VL- 8. Train before braking has been pre-stretched. Various types of pneumatic braking (emergency, full service and adjusting braking) of the freight train on the horizontal section of the track were simulated. As the calculation results were obtained values of the longitudinal forces, braking distances amounts and reduction time in speed at various braking modes. Originality. Waveform impact of the braking cylinders filling on the longitudinal forces level and braking distances amount in freight trains were investigated. Also the longitudinal loading of freight trains at various pneumatic braking was investigated. Practical value. Obtained results can be used to assess the level of largest longitudinal forces and braking distances in the freight trains of different lengths by mathematical modeling of different braking modes...|$|R
40|$|The thermal {{behaviour}} of a {{disc brake}} {{is a critical}} factor {{that needs to be}} considered at the design phase. Most researchers utilise a full <b>size</b> <b>brake</b> dynamometer or a simple pin-on-disc rig to experimentally evaluate the performance of a friction pair (disc and pad). In the current paper, a scaling methodology is proposed to evaluate the thermal performance of a disc brake at a reduced scale. The resulting small scale disc brake has the advantage of low cost and reduced development time. The proposed scaling methodology was validated by comparing the results for the full and small scale discs using a conventional brake dynamometer. In addition, a two dimensional axisymmetric transient thermal finite element model was developed using Abaqus software to assist in the validation of the scaling methodology. The numerical simulations confirmed the equivalence between the full and small scale disc thermal performance using the proposed scaling methodology and also gave good agreement with the experimental results. It is concluded that the scaling methodology is an important tool with which to evaluate the thermal performance of disc brakes in the early design phase...|$|R
40|$|Brake rotors play a {{significant}} role in converting the vehicle kinetic energy into heat energy that is dissipated through conduction and convection. The automotive industry has been looking for many years to develop lightweight brake rotors to reduce vehicle weight and subsequently improve fuel efficiency and vehicle emissions targets. Uncoated wrought aluminium alloys and metal matrix composite (Al-MMC) rotors have been reported to have insufficient safety margin for most passenger car applications. In this study, the thermal performance of coated and uncoated lightweight aluminium disc brake rotors was investigated numerically and experimentally, using both small scale and full <b>size</b> <b>brake</b> dynamometers. Five small scale solid brake rotors were investigated: grey cast iron, forged aluminium alloy (6082), the same 6082 alloy but with an alumina surface layer applied by plasma electrolytic oxidation (PEO), cast aluminium MMC (AMC 640 XA), and the same MMC again with PEO alumina surface layer. The disc and pad temperatures, brake pressure, coefficient of friction and brake torque were monitored during the tests for each disc brake material. In addition, a two dimensional axisymmetric finite element model was developed using Abaqus software in order to investigate the temperature distribution through the disc. The 2 D FE model demonstrated good overall agreement with the experimental results and showed the same general trends. It was found that the PEO coated aluminium alloy has the best overall performance of the lightweight rotors tested in terms of friction and structural integrity at elevated temperature...|$|R
40|$|Melt-infiltrated carbon/carbon {{composites}} (C/C-SiC) {{have already}} proven their applicability to different light-weight structures in thermal protection systems of spacecraft and rockets. One new {{application of these}} composites is their use as brake pads in high performance brake systems of lifts, cranes and other transport systems. In this case, the brake system does not act as a service brake as it is used in passenger cars and high speed trains, but acts as an emergency brake system in case of power failure for example. The main requirements on the brake system are to reduce the velocity constantly, {{and to keep the}} load reliably in position. The tribological counterpart is a metallic guide rail whose surface can be contaminated with dust, oil and preservative agents. Conventional braking materials like organic or sintermetallic pads reached their limits with respect to thermal stability, wear resistance and frictional behavior. Novel modifications of C/C-SiC composites have been developed with high thermal and mechanical shock resistance, extremely low wear rates and high coefficients of friction under dynamic as well as stationary conditions. The tests have been conducted with small test samples as well as originally <b>sized</b> <b>brake</b> pads under practically relevant conditions. It could be shown, that the initial state of the metallic guide rail surface influences the friction coefficient essentially. Also, the phase composition of the C/C-SiC composite, namely on the friction surface, determines the friction behavior. High amounts of silicon carbide increase the wear resistance and friction coefficient, but reduce the impact resistance and mechanical strength of the material. As a compromise, graded composites with a symmetrical lay-up of fabric layers have been developed and were tested successfully. They consist of high amounts of carbon fibers in the center, resulting in quasi-ductile cores and surfaces with high SiC contents, resulting in outstanding tribological properties. From an economical point of view, short fiber reinforced C/C-SiC composites are of high interest. Also, modifications of the Liquid Silicon Infiltration process (LSI) with respect to shorter process times have been investigated. Corresponding samples were tested tribologically, showing a high potential for further cost reductions. This paper deals with the correlations between microstructure and mechanical and thermal as well as tribological properties of different C/C-SiC composites...|$|R
