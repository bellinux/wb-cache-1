Using speed-combined method, the random speed model of wind was established {{and the wind}} loading was obtained. The helical gear system model of wind turbine was built under <b>flexible</b> <b>supporting</b> of the tower. The vibration displacement responses of each shaft were simulated and compared with response under rigid supporting. The results shows that the amplitude of vibration displacements under <b>flexible</b> <b>supporting</b> are generally higher {{and closer to the}} actual working condition, and considering the effects of <b>flexible</b> <b>supporting</b> of tower on system is necessary to the dynamic analysis...|$|R

40|$|LecturePg. 69 - 78 The {{importance}} of including <b>flexible</b> <b>supports</b> in rotordynamic analyses is discussed. Various methods of including the support in rotordynamic calculations are reviewed. A method {{is described in}} which actual compliance frequency response function, FRF, data are used directly in a rotordynamic forced response computer program to accurately predict a steam turbine rotor's critical speed. The <b>flexible</b> <b>support</b> model is described as two single degree of freedom, SDOF, spring-mass-damper systems per bearing support. The methodology of acquiring the FRF data via impact hammer testing is described, and the equations are summarized that incorporate the FRF data into the <b>flexible</b> <b>support</b> model.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a comprehensive numerical procedure {{to treat the}} blast response of laminated glass (LG) panels and investigates the effects of two important parameters: the negative phase of the blast loading and support flexibility on the blast performance of LG. The influence of the negative phase is examined on the blast response of LG panels fixed to rigid and <b>flexible</b> <b>supports.</b> Findings indicate that the negative phase has negligible impact on the centre deflection, energy absorption and the support reactions of LG panels with rigid supports while it has significant impact on those with <b>flexible</b> <b>supports.</b> The support flexibility is varied by changing the cross-section dimensions of the steel cables used with the <b>flexible</b> <b>supports.</b> Results show that blast performance of flexible facades can be further improved by using steel cables with smaller cross-sections as they increase the energy absorption while reducing reaction forces at the steel cables. <b>Flexible</b> <b>supports</b> seem to delay the failure of LG panels which {{are more likely to}} fail after dissipation of the blast pressure and hence reduce the injuries occurring from direct blast pressure and the broken glass fragments. The new information generated in this paper will therefore encourage engineers to come up with innovative flexible façade systems which will minimise the hazards from potential near field explosions...|$|R

The gyroscope is formed using substrate material having lower and upper layers sandwiching a sacrificial insulating layer. An exemplary gyroscope comprises a low-resistivity single-crystal silicon substrate having a lower support layer and an upper <b>flexible</b> <b>support</b> layer.

40|$|A {{device in}} the <b>flexible</b> <b>support</b> {{system for the}} Central Calorimeter is the Liquid Argon Heat Intercept. The purpose of this {{apparatus}} is to intercept heat outside the inner vessel so that bubbles do not form inside. If bubbles did happen to form inside the vessel, they would cause an electric arc between the read-out board and the absorption plates, thus destroying the pre-amplifier. Since this heat intercept {{is located in the}} center of the <b>flexible</b> <b>support,</b> it must also support the load of the Central Caloimeter. Figure 1 shows how the intercept works. The subcooled liquid argon is driven through a 1 / 4 -inch x 0. 049 -inch w tube by hydrostatic pressure. the ambient heat boils the subcooled argon. The gaseous argon flows through the tube and is condensed at the top of the vessel by a 100 kW cooling coil. This process is rpesent in all four <b>flexible</b> <b>support</b> systems...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} an analysis in attachment spacing of tower cranes. Both the support spacing under the rigid <b>support</b> and the <b>flexible</b> <b>support</b> are obtained for this purpose. For deriving the rigid support spacing, differential equation is used. The principle {{is used for}} calculating the support spacing, which the extended segment has the same Euler critical force with the independent segment. The <b>flexible</b> <b>support</b> distance is obtained by setting the integrated stiffness matrix zero, which is equivalent to structural instability. The order of the overall stiffness matrix is big when the tower crane is attached many times. In order to calculate more convenient for solving the matrix determinant, a transfer matrix method is adopted. To verify {{the influence of the}} flexibility caused by the support device, an example is carried out by both rigid and <b>flexible</b> <b>support</b> situations for this purpose, and the support spacing is computed numerically. Numerical results for the support distances of a tower crane will be presented and discussed...|$|R

A thin-walled, integrated, squirrel-cage <b>flexible</b> <b>support</b> roller bearing, quasi-dynamic iterative finite element analysis (FEA) model is established in this paper. The FEA model is used to calculate the structural deformation of the thin-wall rings and support structures; the dynamic characteristics of the bearing are analyzed using the noncircular bearing modified quasi-dynamic model. The influence of the integrated <b>flexible</b> <b>support</b> structure on the internal load distribution and the dynamic characteristics of the roller bearing are analyzed. The results indicate that with the <b>support</b> of a <b>flexible</b> squirrel-cage, the maximum contact load is decreased by 14. 2 %, the loading region is enlarged by 25 %, the cage slide ratio is reduced by 24 %, and the fatigue life is increased by more than 50 %.

40|$|In {{structural}} engineering ceilings affect both the building technique {{and the economic}} construction. Using precast prestressed hollow core slabs meets the demands of modern design and construction to a high extent. However, the shear resistance of hollow core slabs is considerably reduced if the slabs are bedded on slender beams or girders instead of rigid walls. According to investigations in Finland stresses in transverse direction of the slabs due to <b>flexible</b> <b>supports</b> {{may lead to a}} decrease in shear resistance of up to 60 %. The reduction in shear resistance depends on the composite action between the beam and the slabs, the beam deflection and the slabs’ cross section. No generally accepted design model allowing for a standardised and accurate shear design of prestressed hollow core slabs has been established in Europe so far. Further¬more, the differentiation between rigid and <b>flexible</b> <b>supports</b> is often not clear. Uncertainties in the design and open questions regarding the load bearing behaviour on <b>flexible</b> <b>supports</b> in general limit the application of prestressed hollow core slabs. The aim of the present thesis is a thorough analysis of the load bearing behaviour of prestressed hollow core slabs on <b>flexible</b> <b>supports.</b> At first, {{the state of the art}} is summarised. Own experimental and numerical investigations on vital parameters affecting the load bearing behaviour are described in the following. The experimental investigations comprise eight full-scale tests on two-span floor systems with <b>flexible</b> <b>supports</b> and accompanying reference tests on single slabs with rigid supports. Continuative three-dimensional nonlinear FE-analyses provide deep insight into the failure mechanism and the influence of the beam’s bending stiffness on the load bearing behaviour. Based on the experimental and numerical results measures to enhance the shear resistance can be evaluated. A database of international tests with prestressed hollow core slabs on <b>flexible</b> <b>supports</b> from literature is generated to develop a realistic design model for shear. After evaluating the data an existing design model from Finland is used to recalculate the existing tests. An own design model is derived in the next step, whereas especially findings regarding the slabs’ load bearing behaviour and their composite action with the beam at the ultimate limit state are considered. Based on the results of 21 full-scale tests with different types of beams and slabs as well as a parametric study the own model is validated. It accounts for all important factors affecting the load bearing behaviour and hence contributes to an accurate and safe design of prestressed hollow core slabs on <b>flexible</b> <b>supports...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Strain rate {{is a vital}} {{factor for}} the design of a RC (Reinforced Concrete) member under blast loading. At pre-sent, it is not {{scientific}} and cut down the believability to assume the strain rate is a constant or to take the loading rate in-stead of the strain rate. In this paper, an analytical model of RC beams with <b>flexible</b> <b>supports</b> is presented, in which the elasticity, damping, and lumped mass of <b>flexible</b> <b>support</b> are taken into account. Theoretical method of strain rate for RC beam with <b>flexible</b> <b>supports</b> under blast loading is developed based on Euler-Bernoulli beams. It is indicated that the maximal values of strain rate are increased as the blast impulses and the overpressures increased, but the loading rates have not obvious influences on the strain rates. The maximal values and the vibration frequencies of strain rate are in-creased as support stiffness increased. The maximal values of strain rate are decreased as support damping increased, and the attenuation values of strain rate are accelerated. Calculations show that it will result in an overestimation of DIF (Dy-namic Increase Factor) to take the loading rate instead of the strain rate...|$|R

In this paper, by employing the principle of energy equivalence, rigorous theoretical solutions of the tangential and rotational equivalent stiffness are derived based on the Boussinesq’s and Cerruti’s displacement equations. The non-dimensional differential partial equation of the motion, as well as coupled boundary conditions, are solved analytically using the method of multiple time scales.
