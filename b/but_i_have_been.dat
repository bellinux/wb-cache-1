God knows I have endeavored to fulfill what I conceived to be an honest duty. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> mistaken. My motives have been misconstrued, and my feelings most grossly outraged.|$|E
500|$|Epstein {{added his}} name to an {{advertisement}} that appeared in The Times on 24 July 1967, which called for the legalisation of cannabis, the release of all prisoners imprisoned because of possession, and research into marijuana's medical uses. The advertisement was sponsored by a group called Soma and was signed by sixty-five people, including the Beatles, Scottish psychiatrist R. D. Laing, sixteen doctors, and two members of parliament. Epstein responded to questions about the advertisement by saying, [...] "My opinion is that pot smoking is definitely less harmful than drinking alcohol. I am not addicted to either, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> very drunk and very 'high'." [...] In June 1967, after McCartney had admitted to LSD use, Epstein defended him to the media, stating {{that he had taken}} the drug, too.|$|E
2500|$|By 1933, {{the tide}} began to turn, with Pope Pius XI {{ordering}} the Holy See to reverse its ban on Padre Pio’s public celebration of Mass. The pope said, [...] "I {{have not been}} badly disposed toward Padre Pio, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> badly informed." [...] In 1934, the friar was again allowed to hear confessions. He was also given honorary permission to preach despite never having taken the exam for the preaching license. Pope Pius XII, who assumed the papacy in 1939, encouraged devotees to visit Padre Pio.|$|E

2500|$|In Congressional {{testimony}} on October 23, 2008, Greenspan {{acknowledged that he}} was [...] "partially" [...] wrong in opposing regulation and stated [...] "Those {{of us who have}} looked to the self-interest of lending institutions to protect shareholder's equity—myself especially—are in a state of shocked disbelief." [...] Referring to his free-market ideology, Greenspan said: [...] "I have found a flaw. I don't know how significant or permanent it is. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> very distressed by that fact." [...] When Representative Henry Waxman (D-CA) pressed him to clarify his words. [...] "In other words, you found that your view of the world, your ideology, was not right, it was not working," [...] Waxman said. [...] "Absolutely, precisely," [...] Greenspan replied. [...] "You know, that's precisely the reason I was shocked, because I have been going for 40 years or more with very considerable evidence that it was working exceptionally well." [...] Greenspan admitted fault in opposing regulation of derivatives and acknowledged that financial institutions didn't protect shareholders and investments as well as he expected.|$|E
