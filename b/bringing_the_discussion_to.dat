Matriz da história, a memória é abordada aqui nas suas complexas injunções, trazendo-se a discussão para o âmbito da cultura brasileira. A oficina do historiador constitui-se no arcabouço do texto que faz dialogar fundamentos teórico metodológicos e aspectos concretos da pesquisa histórica. A história como discurso de representação da realidade é objeto de discussões, inserindo-se o debate na panorâmica da pós-modernidade. Alerta-se o historiador para o uso crítico das fontes em um cenário marcado pela reconstrução constante das identidades nacionais e pelo caráter fronteiriço do campo de conhecimento.

40|$|An {{analysis}} of traditional authoritarian preservice teacher development approaches in Pakistan demonstrates that they develop teachers as technicians who carbon copy the same authoritarian training model in their classrooms. The more contemporary approaches to teacher education with leadership development focus are mostly limited to in-service teacher education programs. The key dilemma with in-service education {{is that once}} the teachers have received higher qualification they tend {{to move out of}} the classrooms to assume management positions. What Pakistan requires is classroom teacher leaders who have the capacity to initiate and sustain school improvement. I propose the pedagogy of transformation, which is based on the principles of participation and emancipation suited to develop preservice teachers as active professionals who have the capacity to influence and drive improvements in their own learning and in the learning of the children. The transformation pedagogy encompasses five specific instructional strategies for nurturing teachers’ leadership skills in the current preservice teacher preparation program in Pakistan. These are: encourage active involvement and delegation of authority among preservice teachers, engage preservice teachers in critical analysis and meta-cognitive tasks, building collaborative teams and professional networks among preservice teachers, providing preservice teachers with experience of working with real-life teacher leaders, and develop preservice teachers’ moral and ethical reasoning.

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>discussion</b> around {{allowing}} CO 2 {{capture and}} geological storage (CCS) into the Kyoto Protocol's Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) is important, as the CDM {{is currently the}} only structural incentive for reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the developing world. Without the potential incentives given by the CDM, CCS in developing countries will only take place sporadically in niche sectors. The debate around CCS in the CDM has developed into a highly polarised discussion, with a deep divide between proponents and opponents and no view on reconciliation between the various perspectives. Environmental organisations and several developing-country parties in the climate negotiations are increasingly vehemently opposed against CCS in the CDM, and industrialised countries, several large fossil-fuel-dependent developing countries and industry view CCS as a natural option under the CDM, provided some surmountable technical and procedural barriers are taken care of. This paper argues that the efforts of those trying <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>the</b> <b>discussion</b> <b>to</b> a close by solving technical and procedural issues around CCS in the CDM will not lead to agreement because of underlying convictions of all stakeholders.

The research needs are primarily {{in the field of}} the CDM market impacts of CCS, the issue of enhanced oil emission accounting, and sustainable development aspects, and particularly whether developing countries could actually benefit from technological leadership in the field of CCS, or whether they will be worse off. Devoting attention to the identified convictions could provide information for a more acceptable negotiation package on CCS in the CDM. ...|$|R

40|$|What role {{does and}} should {{religion}} {{play in the}} legal sphere of a modern liberal democracy? Does religion threaten to create divisions that would undermine {{the stability of the}} constitutional order? Or is religious disagreement itself a force that works to create consensus on some of the core commitments of constitutionalism [...] liberty of conscience, toleration, limited government, and the rule of law? This essay explores these questions from the perspectives of contemporary political philosophy and constitutional theory. The thesis of the essay is that pluralism [...] the diversity of religious and secular conceptions of the good [...] can and should work as a force for constitutional consensus and that such a consensus is best realized through commitment to an ideal of public legal reason instantiated by the practice of legal formalism. The case for these claims is made in six parts. After the introduction, Part II, The Fact of Pluralism in the Context of Contemporary Religious Division, explores the idea of religious division in light of an important notion in political philosophy [...] the idea that John Rawls calls the fact of reasonable pluralism. Part III, Public Legal Reason, argues that the fact of pluralism has important normative consequences for the foundations of normative legal theory and argues for an ideal of public legal reason. Part IV, Legal Formalism, contends that this idea is best realized in constitutional practice through a formalist approach to constitutional interpretation [...] one that deliberately eschews direct reliance on religious and secular comprehensive conceptions of the good. Part V, Feasibility and Positive Theory, discusses the question whether this ideal of public legal reason and corresponding conception of constitutional formalism are realistic, given the constraints imposed by democratic politics under contemporary conditions.

40|$|This thesis aims {{to define}} the {{foundation}} and nature of contemporary liberalism. Chapter 1 will {{provide an overview of}} different interpretations of what liberalism is, followed by a general definition of liberalism as a political doctrine with four distinct features: importance of liberty, centrality of persons, commitment to ethical pluralism, and suspicious attitude towards state power. Chapter 2 will propose that the foundation of liberalism thus conceived is an understanding of persons as free and equal. Persons being free means that there is no normative authority over persons in politics except the one which is properly justified; this is the justification thesis. Persons being equal means that there is no normative authority over persons in ethics. This implies a committed openness to pluralism, since there is no normative position from which to adjudicate. Chapters 3 and 4 will establish that we have good reasons to believe persons are free and equal - or at least that we have reason to treat them as such. In Chapter 5 I present the idea of perfectionism and distinguish perfectionist liberalisms from political liberalisms, as well as considering some ways in which one might make the case for perfectionist liberalism. Finally in Chapter 6 I <b>bring</b> <b>the</b> <b>discussion</b> <b>to</b> a close, first by looking at some objections to perfectionism found in the literature, and then demonstrating that if we take the idea of persons as free and equal as a foundation of liberalism, then we cannot be perfectionist, since these two notions are in conflict with one another. More specifically a perfectionist approach to liberalism cannot meet the justification thesis and cannot be open to ethical pluralism. The thesis provides a comprehensive view of liberalism and its foundation and thus helps to settle an important debate within contemporary liberalism between perfectionism and anti-perfectionism...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{explores the}} experience of modernity outside of Europe by considering the portrayal of the railway in selected literature of Africa, the Middle East, and South Asia. I examine what I see as a mutually constitutive process: the way subjectivity is constructed within modernity, and the way modernity, in turn, transforms as it travels to the “periphery. ” My dissertation explores these transformations {{by looking at the}} way people inhabit, resist and remake the spaces in and around the railway. Using literary works by Senegalese writer Sembène Ousmane, Turkish poet Nâzim Hikmet, and selected South Asian writers, I consider the place of aesthetics and representation in this process. I argue that all these authors contribute to a genre that might be called postcolonial modernism, literature from the Third World that is both creating and responding to the advent of modernity. ^ Chapter One provides an overview of theories of modernity. My discussion brings together those critics who theorize modernity primarily within the Western context and those who have opened a discussion of alternative modernities. Chapter Two introduces contemporary theories of space as a way to explore how modernity travels. Looking specifically at spaces of the railway, I consider how modernity is realized through material and imaginative practices. Chapter Three focuses on Sembène Ousmane 2 ̆ 7 s God 2 ̆ 7 s Bits of Wood (1960), and demonstrates how the novel 2 ̆ 7 s conflict between generations during the colonial period reveals two relationships to modernity that coexist in the colonial setting. My fourth chapter <b>brings</b> <b>the</b> <b>discussion</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> context of South Asia and the literature of partition, including Khushwant Singh 2 ̆ 7 s novel Train to Pakistan (1956). I argue that these Indian and Pakistani writers represent the railway as a contradictory space traversing a geography fragmented by communal allegiances. Chapter Five analyzes Turkish poet Nâzim Hikmet 2 ̆ 7 s epic poem Human Landscapes (1950), written during a period of intense national modernization. I present Hikmet 2 ̆ 7 s view of modernity as an ambivalent one, representing the altered modes of perception brought by modern technology at the same time underscoring, through his portrayal of the Turkish peasantry, the fact that modernity has not fulfilled its promise of emancipation. ...|$|R
40|$|Part 4 : Infrastructure and TechnologyInternational audienceStandardisation is one {{of tools}} of Electronic Government (EGov). It refers to the {{development}} where individuals and organizations develop and/or adhere to standard IT solutions and associated work processes. Studies on standardization in information technology (IT) emphasize either only the technical side of standard construction (the ‘what’ and ‘how’), or the socio-organizational side of the contextual processes in which standards emerge (the ‘who’ and ‘when’). Our article has an alternative, socio-technical, approach, which emphasizes ‘where’ standards crystallize. Our empirical field to find where crystallization occurs concerns the geoIT sector. Through a qualitative approach, {{the data show that}} standard crystallization occurs at the hubs of inter-organizational relations, rather than at the top or the bottom of formal organizations. This claim is important because it contradicts the common strategy of standardization, which is largely centralized. Even though government has centralized the creation and distribution of geoIT standards, their actual creation and crystallization occurs at a more decentralized level: across municipalities. The conclusion is that <b>bringing</b> <b>the</b> standardization <b>discussion</b> <b>to</b> a point of where standardization actually happens, provides {{a better understanding of the}} socio-technical dynamic of governance of inter-organizational IT...|$|R
40|$|International audienceLifting as {{geometric}} operation can {{be defined}} as a pseudo-inverse of orthogonal projection. It has received attention in different fields and applications (mechanics, geometry, control, etc). Numerous studies have been dedicated to the existence conditions of a convex lifting in a higher dimension for a given cell complex. It is worth noting that this notion can be extended for a polyhedral partition for applications in control theory, and it is recently shown to be the key step in solving the inverse parametric linear/quadratic programming problems. The present paper presents in a succinct manner the main elements of this topological problem with specific attention to the case of polyhedral partitions and their liftings. Furthermore, we are interested from the practical point of view, in the use of these concepts in control system design. Practically, a construction for the Voronoi diagram class is presented. Secondly, a methodological result is presented which leads to the modification of partitions guaranteeing a theoretically liftable result. In addition, a generic constructive procedure for the partitions based on convexity, continuity and linear (or quadratic) programming is proposed. In order <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>the</b> <b>discussion</b> closer <b>to</b> <b>the</b> control related formulations, the correspondence between convex liftings of a given partition in ℝd onto (d+ 1) -space and n-space with n > d+ 1 is provided. Finally an analysis with respect to predictive control related problems will conclude our contribution...|$|R
40|$|This article aims to {{show how}} the metaphorical and metonymical {{portrayal}} of character perception in film can give rise to two distinct but interrelated percepts of causality in the viewer, namely (1) the percept that the viewer sees that an object perceived by a character causes the character’s percep- tion of that object and (2) the percept that the viewer sees that character perception in turn causes a change of state in the perceiving character’s mind (e. g., knowing, remembering). We start our discussion with a brief epistemological overview. Thereby two questions are central: (1) How do people conceptualize perception and causality? and (2) When do people perceive causality in perception? Answers will be given, respectively, by considering insights from cognitive linguistics and experimental psychol- ogy. In the next section, then, we <b>bring</b> <b>the</b> theoretical <b>discussion</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> foreground of Film Studies by showing how the conceptual solutions, as suggested in the prior part, can manifest themselves in cinematic terms. It is through the forced movements of film making (e. g., framing, editing and camera movement), that, we will argue, the viewer is encouraged to see a causal relationship between (1) the object perceived and the character’s visual experience and (2) the character’s visual experience and the change of mental state in the perceiving character. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Fan {{studies has}} been {{critical}} and groundbreaking {{in a number of}} respects. However, in regard <b>to</b> methodology, <b>discussion</b> seems decidedly thin on the ground. Such a missing discourse has wider implications, raising questions such as: what kinds of knowledge do fan studies researchers want to produce? What are the objects being studied? How does fan studies inform a general approach to research? And how is the area going to maintain itself, if we don’t start talking about our methodology and world - view? This paper is an attempt <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>the</b> <b>discussion</b> of methodology <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fore in fan studies. In doing so, we show how the history of methodology in media and cultural studies implies certain methods. We then turn to newer methodologies in interpretative qualitative research. From here, we argue that there is room for mutual dialogue between fan studies and methodology: namely in work around the ‘aca-fan’ subject position of the researcher; and in digital research opened up by online modes of fandom and fan activism...|$|R
40|$|Most {{patients}} with pancreatic cancer present {{with a mass}} on radiologic studies, however, not every pancreatic mass is cancer. Since radiological studies alone are insufficient to establish the diagnosis of a pancreatic mass and patient management depends on a definitive diagnosis; confirmatory cytology or histology is usually required. As a minimally invasive procedure, EUS and EUS FNA avoid the risk of cutaneous or peritoneal contamination that may occur with CT or US-guided investigations and is less invasive than surgical interventions. As a result, EUS FNA of pancreatic masses is becoming the standard for obtaining cytological diagnosis. This chapter presents an EUS-based diagnostic algorithm {{for the evaluation of}} pancreatic lesions and is based upon a review of the pertinent literature in the field of pancreatic endosonography that has been the most influential in helping to guide this evolving field. Realizing there is much overlap among the EUS characteristics of various pancreatic lesions, for the sake of simplicity we have structured our discussion in broad terms of solid versus cystic lesions and discuss various pancreatic lesions within this framework. The additional contributors to this round table discussion have been asked to provide a more dedicated, focused <b>discussion</b> of <b>the</b> various subcategories of pancreatic lesions in greater detail than we could hope to achieve here. We provide this final contribution to the round table as a means of <b>bringing</b> <b>the</b> <b>discussion</b> back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> big picture of pancreatic lesions, rather than trying to hone in on the fine details of any one subclass...|$|R
