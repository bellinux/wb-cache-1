5|$|The lungs are {{supplied}} by nerves of the autonomic nervous system. Input from the {{parasympathetic nervous system}} occurs via the vagus nerve. When stimulated by acetylcholine, this causes constriction of the smooth muscle lining the bronchus and bronchioles, and increases the secretions from glands. The lungs also have a sympathetic tone from norepinephrine acting on the beta 2 receptors in the respiratory tract, which causes <b>bronchodilation.</b>|$|E

25|$|Caffeine can {{increase}} {{blood pressure and}} cause vasoconstriction. Long-term consumption at sufficiently high doses {{has been associated with}} chronic arterial stiffness. Coffee and caffeine can affect gastrointestinal motility and gastric acid secretion. Caffeine in low doses may cause weak <b>bronchodilation</b> for up to four hours in asthmatics. Caffeine increases basal metabolic rate in adults. In postmenopausal women, high caffeine consumption can accelerate bone loss.|$|E
25|$|Catecholamine receptors {{persisted in}} this {{wavering}} state {{for more than}} forty years. Additional blocking agents were found such as tolazoline in Switzerland and phenoxybenzamine in the United States, but like the ergot alkaloids they blocked only the smooth muscle excitatory receptors. Additional agonists also were synthesized. Outstanding among them became isoprenaline, N-isopropyl-noradrenaline, of Boehringer Ingelheim, studied pharmacologically along with adrenaline and other N-substituted noradrenaline derivatives by Richard Rössler (1897–1945) and Heribert Konzett (1912–2004) in Vienna. The Viennese pharmacologists used their own Konzett-Rössler test to examine <b>bronchodilation.</b> Intravenous injection of pilocarpine to induce bronchospasm was followed by intravenous injection of the agonists. “Arrangement of all amines according to their bronchodilator effect yields a series from the most potent, isopropyl-adrenaline, via the approximately equipotent bodies adrenaline, propyl-adrenaline and butyl-adrenaline, to the weakly active isobutyl-adrenaline.” Isoprenaline also exerted marked positive chronotropic and inotropic effects. Boehringer introduced it for use in asthma in 1940. After the war it became available to Germany’s former enemies {{and over the years}} was traded under about 50 names. In addition to this therapeutic success {{it was one of the}} agonists with which Raymond P. Ahlquist solved the ″myoneural junction″ riddle. “By virtue of this property the reputation of the substance spread all over the world and it became a tool for many investigations on different aspects of pharmacology and therapeutics.” The story had a dark side: overdosage caused numerous deaths due to cardiac side effects, an estaimated three thousands in the United Kingdom alone.|$|E

[...] In the 1950s, dichloroisoproterenol (DCI) was discovered to be a β-antagonist that blocked the effects of sympathomimetic amines on <b>bronchodilation,</b> uterine relaxation and heart stimulation. Although DCI had no clinical utility, a change in the compound did provide a clinical candidate, pronethalol, which was introduced in 1962.|$|E
2500|$|Ahlquist {{was head}} of the Department of Pharmacology of the University of Georgia School of Medicine, now Georgia Regents University. In 1948 he saw what had escaped Dale in 1906. “The adrenotropic receptors have been {{considered}} to be of two classes, those whose action results in excitation and those whose action results in inhibition of the effector cells. Experiments described in this paper indicate that although {{there are two kinds of}} adrenotropic receptors they cannot be classified simply as excitatory or inhibitory since each kind of receptor may have either action depending on where it is found.” Ahlquist chose six agonists, including adrenaline, noradrenaline, α-methylnoradrenaline and isoprenaline, and examined their effects on several organs. He found that the six substances possessed two – and only two – rank orders of potency in these organs. For example, the rank order of potency was ″adrenaline > noradrenaline > α-methylnoradrenaline > isoprenaline″ in promoting contraction of blood vessels, but ″isoprenaline > adrenaline > α-methylnoradrenaline > noradrenaline″ in stimulating the heart. The receptor with the first rank order (for example for blood vessel contraction) he called alpha adrenotropic receptor (now α-adrenoceptor or α-adrenergic receptor), while the receptor with the second rank order (for instance for stimulation of the heart, but also for <b>bronchodilation)</b> he called beta adrenotropic receptor (now β-adrenoceptor or β-adrenergic receptor). ″This concept of two fundamental types of receptors is directly opposed to the concept of two mediator substances (sympathin E and sympathin I) as propounded by Cannon and Rosenblueth and now widely quoted as ‘law’ of physiology. … There is only one adrenergic neuro-hormone, or sympathin, and that sympathin is identical with epinephrine.” ...|$|E

50|$|As the {{differential}} diagnosis is made, certain other tests may be necessary, including toxicological screening and imaging of the kidneys.

50|$|The beta-2 {{adrenergic}} receptor (β2 adrenoreceptor), {{also known as}} ADRB2, is a cell membrane-spanning beta-{{adrenergic receptor}} that interacts with (binds) epinephrine, a hormone and neurotransmitter (ligand synonym, adrenaline) whose signaling, via a downstream L-type calcium channel interaction, mediates physiologic responses such as smooth muscle relaxation and <b>bronchodilation.</b>|$|E
50|$|Additionally some {{psychostimulant}} {{drugs that}} have an amphetamine like mode of action, such as amphetamine, methamphetamine, and cocaine, have bronchodilating effects and were used often for asthma {{due to the lack}} of effective β2-adrenergic agonists for use as bronchodilator, but are now rarely, if ever, used medically for their <b>bronchodilation</b> effect.|$|E
50|$|TAS2R10 is also {{expressed}} in the smooth muscle of human airways, along with several other bitter taste receptors. Their activation in these cells causes an increase in intracellular calcium ion, which in turn triggers the opening of potassium channels which hyperpolarize the membrane and cause the smooth muscle to relax. Hence, activation of these receptors leads to <b>bronchodilation.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Methylhexanamine is an {{indirect}} sympathomimetic drug that constricts {{blood vessels and}} thus has effects on the heart, lungs, and reproductive organs. It also causes <b>bronchodilation,</b> inhibits peristalsis in the intestines, and has diuretic effects. Most {{studies have been done}} on pharmacological effects when the drug is inhaled; our understanding of what methylhexanamine does when taken orally are mostly based on extrapolating from the activities of similar compounds. A 2013 review concluded that: [...] "Pharmacological effects after oral intake can be expected on the lungs (<b>bronchodilation)</b> and the nasal mucosa following a single oral dose of about 4-15 mg. Pharmacological effects on the heart can be expected following a single oral dose of about 50-75 mg. Pharmacological effects on the blood pressure can be expected after a single oral dose of about 100 mg. Because of the long half-life, there is a risk that repeated doses within 24-36 hours could lead to steadily stronger pharmacological effects (build-up)." ...|$|E

50|$|The {{diameter}} of the bronchioles {{plays an important role}} in air flow. The bronchioles change diameter to either increase or reduce air flow. An increase in diameter is called <b>bronchodilation</b> and is stimulated by either epinephrine or sympathetic nerves to increase air flow. A decrease in diameter is called bronchoconstriction and is stimulated by histamine, parasympathetic nerves, cold air, chemical irritants and other factors to decrease air flow.|$|E
50|$|In 1967, it {{was shown}} that the β2-receptor was {{responsible}} for <b>bronchodilation</b> and this led to development of more selective drugs. In 1961 orciprenaline, a longer acting β2-agonist was found, {{but it was not}} as potent as isoproterenol. Orciprenaline does not have the catechol structure which was the reason for the longer action time. In the mid-1960s, albuterol or salbutamol was discovered, followed by terbutalin and fenoterol a few years later. Albuterol and terbutaline gave fewer side effects, such as increased heart rate, than isoproterenol. The pharmaceutical company Glaxo discovered salmeterol, a long-acting β2-agonist that had <b>bronchodilation</b> activity for up to 12 hours. It was marketed in 1990. Formoterol, another long-acting β2-agonist, was marketed shortly after. This long duration of action made the treatment for severe asthma and COPD more convenient for the patients because it is inhaled twice a day.In 2013 an extra long-acting β2-agonist, vilanterol, was marketed. Its duration of action lasts for 24 hours which should improve patients' compliance and make the treatment more convenient.|$|E
50|$|Activation of EP2 also {{influences}} allergic inflammatory reactions. It dilates airways (<b>bronchodilation)</b> contracted by the allergic mediator, histamine; inhibits Immunoglobulin E-activated {{mast cells}} from releasing histamine and leukotrienes (viz., LTC4, LTD4, and LTE4), {{all of which}} have bronchoconstricting and otherwise pro-allergic actions; inhibits pro-allergic eosinophil apoptosis, chemotaxis, and release of pro-allergic granule contents; and reduces release of the pro-allergic cytokines Interleukin 5, Interleukin 4, and interleukin 13 from human blood mononuclear cells.|$|E
50|$|In human studies, PGI2 {{failed to}} alter bronchoconstriction {{responses}} to allergen but did protect against exercise-induced and ultrasonic water-induced bronchoconstriction in asthmatic patients. It also caused <b>bronchodilation</b> in two asthmatic patients. However, these studies were done before {{the availability of}} potent and selective IP agonists. These agonists might produce more effective inhibitor results on airways allergic diseases but their toxicity (e.g. pulmonary edema, hypotension) has tended to restrict there study in asthmatic patients.|$|E
50|$|Pindolol is a nonselective {{beta blocker}} with partial beta-adrenergic {{receptor}} agonist activity and also possesses intrinsic sympathomimetic activity. This means that pindolol, particularly in high doses, exerts effects like epinephrine or isoprenaline (increased pulse rate, increased blood pressure, <b>bronchodilation),</b> but these effects are limited. Pindolol also shows membrane stabilizing effects like quinidine, possibly accounting for its antiarrhythmic effects. It also {{functions as a}} 5-HT1A receptor weak partial agonist / antagonist (Ki = 33 nM).|$|E
50|$|There are {{two types}} of β2-agonists, long- and short-acting. They are both inhaled and given by aerosol {{delivery}} devices.Long-lasting β2-agonists are often given in a combination with corticosteroids to treat asthma. Short-acting β2-agonists are used to treat exercise-induced asthma, and for asthma patients to get a quick relief of symptoms. Long-lasting β2-agonists are not used to treat exercise-induced asthma. They are taken 10-15 minutes before exercise. The <b>bronchodilation</b> begins few minutes after inhalation of short-acting β2-agonists and lasts from 4 to 8 hours.|$|E

5000|$|Muscarinic antagonists (anti-cholinergics): Blocking the muscarinic {{acetylcholine}} receptors in pulmonary {{smooth muscle}} tissue {{results in a}} decrease in smooth muscle tone and <b>bronchodilation.</b> These medications include short-acting muscarinic antagonists (SAMAs) such as ipratropium, and long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMA) such as tiotropium. Onset of action for SAMAs is typically between 30-60 minutes, making these drugs less efficacious in treating acute asthma attacks and bronchospasm. Most common side effects for these drugs may include dry mouth, headache, urinary tract infection, and bronchitis.|$|E
5000|$|... β {{adrenergic}} receptors are {{coupled to}} a stimulatory G protein of adenylyl cyclase. This enzyme produces the second messenger {{cyclic adenosine monophosphate}} (cAMP). In the lung, cAMP decreases calcium concentrations within cells and activates protein kinase A. Both of these changes , inactivate myosin light-chain kinase and activate myosin light-chain phosphatase. In addition, β2 agonists open large conductance calcium-activated potassium channels and thereby tend to hyperpolarize airway smooth muscle cells. The combination of decreased intracellular calcium, increased membrane potassium conductance, and decreased myosin light chain kinase activity leads to smooth muscle relaxation and <b>bronchodilation.</b>|$|E
5000|$|... β2-adrenoceptor {{agonists}} is a {{group of}} drugs that act selectively on β2-receptors in the lungs causing <b>bronchodilation.</b> β2-agonists are used to treat asthma and COPD, diseases that cause obstruction in the airways. The first β2-agonist isoproterenol, an unselective agonist which was discovered in the 1940s. The aim of the drug development through the years has been to minimise side effects, achieve selectivity and longer duration of action. The mechanism of action is well understood and has facilitated the development. The structure of the binding site {{and the nature of the}} binding is also well known, as is the structure activity relationship.|$|E
50|$|Examples of isomers having {{different}} medical properties can {{be easily}} found. For example, in the placement of methyl groups. In substituted xanthines, theobromine, found in chocolate, is a vasodilator with some effects in common with caffeine; but, {{if one of the}} two methyl groups is moved to a different position on the two-ring core, the isomer is theophylline, which has a variety of effects, including <b>bronchodilation</b> and anti-inflammatory action. Another example of this occurs in the phenethylamine-based stimulant drugs. Phentermine is a non-chiral compound with a weaker effect than that of amphetamine. It is used as an appetite-reducing medication and has mild or no stimulant properties. However, a different atomic arrangement gives dextromethamphetamine, which is a stronger stimulant than amphetamine.|$|E
