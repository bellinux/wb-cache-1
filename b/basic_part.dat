5|$|The {{pelagic zone}} {{contains}} macro- and microfauna and myriad zooplankton which drift with the currents. Most {{of the smallest}} organisms are the larvae of fish and marine invertebrates which liberate eggs in vast numbers because the chance of any one embryo surviving to maturity is so minute. The zooplankton feed on phytoplankton and on each other and form a <b>basic</b> <b>part</b> of the complex food chain that extends through variously-sized fish and other nektonic organisms, which are in turn eaten by larger squids, sharks, porpoises, dolphins, and whales. Some marine creatures make large migrations, either to {{other regions of the}} ocean on a seasonal basis or up and down its vertical layers, often ascending to feed at night before descending to safety by day. Ships can introduce or spread invasive species through the discharge of ballast water or through the transport of organisms that have accumulated as part of the fouling community on the hulls of vessels.|$|E
25|$|Mao {{considered}} terrorism a <b>basic</b> <b>part</b> of {{his first}} part of the three phases of revolutionary warfare. Several insurgency models recognize that completed acts of terrorism widen the security gap; the Marxist guerrilla theoretician Carlos Marighella specifically recommended acts of terror, as a means of accomplishing something that fits the concept of opening the security gap. Mao considered terrorism to be part of forming a guerilla movement.|$|E
25|$|The reptilian {{nervous system}} {{contains}} the same <b>basic</b> <b>part</b> of the amphibian brain, but the reptile cerebrum and cerebellum are slightly larger. Most typical sense organs are well developed with certain exceptions, {{most notably the}} snake's lack of external ears (middle and inner ears are present). There are twelve pairs of cranial nerves. Due to their short cochlea, reptiles use electrical tuning to expand their range of audible frequencies.|$|E

25|$|Animal-assisted therapy, {{where an}} animal {{such as a}} dog or a horse becomes a <b>basic</b> <b>part</b> of a person's treatment, is a {{controversial}} treatment for some symptoms. A 2007 meta-analysis found that animal-assisted therapy {{is associated with a}} moderate improvement in autism spectrum symptoms. Reviews of published dolphin-assisted therapy (DAT) studies have found important methodological flaws and have concluded that there is no compelling scientific evidence that DAT is a legitimate therapy or that it affords any more than fleeting improvements in mood.|$|E

25|$|Wine was a <b>basic</b> <b>part</b> of the Parisian diet, ranking {{with bread}} and meat. Fine wines arrived from Bordeaux, {{ordinary}} wines {{were brought to}} the city in large casks from Burgundy and Provence; lesser quality wines came from vineyards just outside the city, in Montmartre and Belleville. Beer consumption was small, was only eight percent of that of wine, and cider only three percent. The most common strong alcoholic beverage was eau-de-vie, with as much as twenty-seven percent alcohol. It was most popular among the working class Parisians.|$|E

25|$|In 1990, {{after having}} been CEO for Continental and Texas International for 18 years, Lorenzo sold his {{controlling}} interest in Continental Airlines to Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS), and stepped down from his CEO role to pursue other entrepreneurial and investment ventures. Lorenzo’s departure from Continental was a <b>basic</b> <b>part</b> of the deal, required by both Lorenzo and SAS, although he remained a director of Continental for two years afterwards {{as part of the}} arrangements. During his eighteen-year tenure, his airline empire grew from 15 jet aircraft (at Texas International) with revenues of $73 million, to Continental's combined fleet of 350 jet aircraft and revenues of over $5 billion. After the sale of his interest in Continental, Lorenzo founded Savoy Capital, Inc. in 1990 in Houston, TX. Savoy is a private investment firm largely investing for its own account, but which also invests on behalf of accredited outside investors.|$|E
25|$|Then, Apple {{decided that}} most of its {{application}} software packages, including HyperCard, would be the property of a wholly owned subsidiary called Claris. Many of the HyperCard developers chose to stay at Apple rather than move to Claris, causing the development team to be split. Claris, {{in the business of}} selling software for a profit, attempted to create a business model where HyperCard could also generate revenues. At first the freely-distributed versions of HyperCard shipped with authoring disabled. Early versions of Claris HyperCard contained an Easter Egg: typing 'magic' into the message box would convert the player into a full HyperCard authoring environment. When this trick became nearly-universal they wrote a new viewer only version, the HyperCard Player which Apple distributed with the Macintosh operating system, while Claris sold the full version commercially. Many users were upset that they had to pay to use software that had traditionally been supplied free and which many considered a <b>basic</b> <b>part</b> of the Mac.|$|E
500|$|The Canadian, Norwegian and Australian Defence Forces train their {{personnel}} with CS gas in {{a manner}} similar to that of the USA, as it is a <b>basic</b> <b>part</b> of CBRN (Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear) training. Gas is released by burning tablets, usually in a building reserved for this purpose (a [...] "gas hut"). In the training, the person enters the building unprotected, and must fit and clear the gas mask before leaving. Other drills such as drinking and under-mask decontamination are also practised. Some Norwegian units are exposed to CS gas while engaged in mental and physical activity such as addressing the officer in command by stating name, rank and troop before doing 30 push-ups.|$|E

They also introduced their Gullah staple of rice to the Seminole, and continued {{to use it as a}} <b>basic</b> <b>part</b> of their diets.

Additionally, simulations indicate that if molecular-scale implementations could be realized, they would be far more energy-efficient than conventional electronic computers...|$|R
