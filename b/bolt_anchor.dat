This paper aims {{to reveal}} the {{mechanical}} effects of metal holder and <b>bolt</b> (<b>anchor)</b> in anchor frame combination structure, then shows existing problems of anchor frame combination supporting structure being used in present coal mine, and gives corresponding solution {{on the basis of}} modern mechanics theory. By specify examples and on the basis of having administered the pull test of <b>bolt</b> (<b>anchor),</b> the article has calculated and analyzed the stress distribution rule of metal holder in anchor frame combination supporting structure according to the statically indeterminate principle in solid mechanics. In contrast to single metal holder structure, the consequence comes to be that the bearing capacity was significantly increased. However, the actual stress values of <b>bolt</b> (<b>anchor)</b> in field measurement shows that the bearing capacity of <b>bolt</b> (<b>anchor)</b> has hot been given full work. So the essay not only reveals the good bearing capacity of anchor frame combination structure but also points out that there is plenty of scope for optimization in anchor frame combination structure, and its research results have a certain reference for supporting theory and technology research in deep level and high ground pressure soft rock roadway...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{anchorage}} {{formed by}} the post-installed steel chemical anchors {{can be used for}} new buildings. Thanks to easy and fast installation can be used particularly for reconstructions. Chemical anchors are the most frequently used with concrete and reinforced concrete. On the trade of anchoring, the chemical anchor systems are represented by a number of variants of this anchorage type but, in fact, they always consist of a steel <b>bolt</b> (<b>anchor)</b> installed in a pre-drilled hole. The connection between a steel bolt and concrete or masonry (most frequently) is done by glue, i. e. usually by different types of epoxy. The research presented in this article is focused on a possible application of these anchor types, namely in the connection of a steel beam with a face plate to different types of columns. The analysis of a connection steel beam cantilever stressed by bending moment to the construction of the column with bonded anchors. The loading capacity of anchors connected (bonded) to steel HEB concreted column will be compared to loading capacity of anchors bonded to reinforced concrete column. Comparisons will be done on the basis of experimental tests and subsequently validated by numerical models. Compared resistance of the anchors is different for columns and the rigidity of joints...|$|E

40|$|Generally, L <b>anchor</b> <b>bolt</b> {{system has}} been used {{for a long period of}} time in {{construction}} industry as one of the distributing load structures. However, there are some weaknesses in L <b>anchor</b> <b>bolt</b> which may straighten and pullup when charged with tensile load. Current practices prefer to use other types of <b>anchor</b> <b>bolt</b> systems, such as headed studs <b>anchor</b> <b>bolt</b> system to replace the L <b>anchor</b> <b>bolt</b> design. There has been lack of studies to prove that it is more effective in terms of performance. A new T <b>anchor</b> <b>bolt</b> which was basically modified from headed studs <b>anchor</b> <b>bolt</b> was proposed in this study to compare its performance of tensile loading in concrete failure to typical L design. This study aims to determine whether the T <b>anchor</b> <b>bolt</b> system gives better performance as compared to an L <b>anchor</b> <b>bolt</b> system. The performance was rated based on tensile loading on concrete failure pattern. A pullout test was conducted on two different <b>anchor</b> <b>bolt</b> systems, namely L and T. The <b>anchor</b> <b>bolt</b> embedded depth, h in concrete were varied according to their hook or bend radius. Each sample was repeated twice. There were totally eight samples. The hook or bend radius used were 50 mm and 57. 5 mm for sample L 1 and L 2, respectively. 90 -degree bend were used on sample T 1 and T 2. Based on test results, it can be seen that the performance of concrete failure pattern under tensile load on both L and T <b>anchor</b> <b>bolt</b> design samples with 200 mm embedment depth was better than deeper embedment depth of 230 mm. But the L <b>anchor</b> <b>bolt</b> design gives the best results as compared to T design.

The specimen used for the experiment have the real-sized diameters ranging from 120 mm to 180 mm.

40|$|Abstract. Rock bolting {{is one of}} {{the most}} common methods of rock reinforcement. To {{optimize}} bolt parameters for reasonably playing its properties under safe support condition, it’s a must to study the mechanical characteristics of roadway and bolt. This paper shows that <b>anchor</b> <b>bolts</b> at the top of the rise side has the maximum force, middle of the two sides minimal. Middle of two sides has the largest displacement, top and bottom smallest by using flac 3 d to simulate the force of special-shaped roadway under the support of <b>anchor</b> <b>bolts,</b> combined with field observance of <b>anchor</b> <b>bolts</b> force. Therefore, by optimizing <b>anchor</b> <b>bolts</b> supporting parameters, we can effectively control the deformation of surrounding rocks and improve the whole stability through strengthening support and changing partial <b>anchor</b> <b>bolts</b> supporting parameters...|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation of}} <b>anchor</b> <b>bolts</b> embedded in unreinforced concrete, monotonically loaded in shear is described. The <b>anchor</b> <b>bolts</b> are embedded sufficiently {{to develop the}} minimum tensile strength of the bolt steel. Pairs of <b>anchor</b> <b>bolts</b> (double-bolt anchorages) with varying spacings and edge distances are loaded in shear in the direction perpendicular {{to the line of}} the bolts. Single-bolt anchorages are also tested in shear with varying edge distances and compared with the results of the double-bolt anchorage tests. Concrete failure with wedge cone is observed in most cases. The effects of the edge distance and bolt spacing on the shear resistance of <b>anchor</b> <b>bolts</b> are discussed. The ACI Committee 349 shear resistance formula has been found to give good estimates of the singlebolt anchorage tests. However, the concept of wedge cone interaction, commonly used for calculating the tensile pull-out capacity of <b>anchor</b> <b>bolt</b> groups, is found not directly applicable to double-bolt anchorages under shear. The influence of the support conditions of the concrete test blocks on <b>anchor</b> <b>bolt</b> shear strengths is also investigated...|$|R

First, the movements of an existing wind turbine tower-foundation system were measured using accelerometers {{at the top and}} middle of a 20 m tower.

The spectrum of the strain of the <b>anchor</b> <b>bolts</b> generally agreed with the acceleration spectrum. Next, three-dimensional nonlinear FE analyses were performed to identify stress states of various parts of the system. The FE model was verified through data obtained from a field-based free vibration test. Then, the model was examined with a displacing obtained by processing the field measurement data. The obtained accelerations of the tower were consistent with the measured data; however, the calculated strain of the <b>anchor</b> <b>bolts</b> was larger than the measured strain. Further analysis was conducted to predict the ultimate state at failure.

40|$|<b>Anchor</b> <b>bolts</b> {{are often}} used in {{concrete}} or steel structures. Nevertheless still empirical design procedures are used {{in order to determine}} the dimensions of the structure. Non linear fracture mechanics tries to describe fracture of heterogeneous materials like concrete. In the classical representation of concrete fracturing (figure 1. 1), cohesive forces in the micro-crack-zone (ahead of the cracktip) contribute to the carrying capacity of the structure and cause softening of concrete. This concretesoftening can also be explained by discontinuous cracks that grow along aggregate particles and cause bridging of the cracks (crack-face bridging, see Van Mier (1991)).
