5|$|As {{with other}} British cities, there was {{immigration}} from various Commonwealth {{countries in the}} post war years, which did lead to some racist tension. In 1963, a colour bar operated by Bristol Omnibus Company, which at that time refused to employ Black or Asian bus crews, was successfully challenged in the Bristol Bus Boycott, which was considered to have <b>been</b> <b>instrumental</b> <b>in</b> the eventual passage of the Race Relations Act 1968.

5|$|Pedro II may be {{considered}} a rare instance of a head of state who, despite being overwhelmingly beloved by his people, despite international admiration and acclamation, despite having <b>been</b> <b>instrumental</b> <b>in</b> driving forward major liberal social and economic reforms, despite overseeing a period of outstanding prosperity and influence during a reign covering nearly six decades, and despite being considered a highly successful ruler to the end, was ultimately subjected to overthrow and exile. The republican revolution which replaced the Empire led to decades of disruption and dictatorship.|$|E

5|$|Sigurd {{was the son}} of Hlodvir Thorfinnson and (according to the Norse sagas) {{a direct}} descendent of Torf-Einarr Rognvaldson. Sigurd's tenure as earl was {{apparently}} free of the kin-strife that beset some other incumbents of this title {{and he was able to}} pursue his military ambitions over a wide area. He also held lands in the north of mainland Scotland and in the Sudrøyar, and he may have <b>been</b> <b>instrumental</b> <b>in</b> the defeat of Gofraid mac Arailt, King of the Isles. The Annals of Ulster record his death at the Battle of Clontarf in 1014, the earliest known reference to the earldom of Orkney.|$|E

5|$|The Chartered Company's native commissioners {{began to}} fear a {{possible}} tribal rebellion during early 1915. Herbert Taylor, the chief native commissioner, believed that foreign missionaries were secretly encouraging rural black people {{to emulate the}} Chilembwe revolt in Nyasaland, and telling them (falsely) that the British were exterminating the natives there. There were few actual attempts to topple the administration in Southern Rhodesia, but the Company still took precautions. Aware that Mashona svikiro (spirit mediums) had <b>been</b> <b>instrumental</b> <b>in</b> inciting and leading insurgencies against Company rule during the late 1890s, the native commissioners enacted new legislation designed to imprison any svikiro who gained significant popularity.|$|E

Some of the stones used in construction of the building was purchased from the Industrial Plantation, where poor Jews assisted in quarrying and shaping the blocks. On May 7, 1856 Consul Finn inspected the site after receiving complaints from Muslims who suspected the opening of windows towards a mosque.|$|E
5|$|A special {{election}} {{was scheduled for}} January 19, 2010, for the U.S. Senate seat from Massachusetts left vacant by Kennedy's death. Shortly before his death, Kennedy had written to Democratic Governor of Massachusetts Deval Patrick and the Massachusetts legislature to change state law to allow an appointee to fill a U.S. Senate vacancy, for a term expiring upon the {{special election}}. (Kennedy had <b>been</b> <b>instrumental</b> <b>in</b> the prior 2004 alteration of this law to prevent Governor Mitt Romney from appointing a Republican senator should John Kerry's presidential campaign succeed.) The law was amended, and on September 24, 2009, Paul G. Kirk, former Democratic National Committee chairman and former aide to Kennedy, was appointed to occupy the Senate seat until {{the completion of the}} special election. Kirk announced {{that he would not be}} a candidate in the special election.
