40|$|This {{paper is}} an {{analysis}} of the impact of different <b>bargaining</b> regimes on firm-specific wages and wage dispersion. In recent years, firms in Germany favored flexible to collective <b>bargained</b> wages. Opening clauses were introduced to combine collective <b>bargaining</b> and flexible adaptation of e. g. wages to firm-specific needs. An own survey evaluated whether central collective agreements contain these opening clauses. Then, the gathered information about opening clauses were linked to the Salary and Wage Structure Survey 2001. Focussing on central <b>bargaining</b> agreements, it has been tested whether <b>bargained</b> wages and wage dispersion differ under opened central <b>bargaining</b> coverage from that of non-opened central <b>bargaining</b> regimes. While wages with collective <b>bargaining</b> regimes tend to be higher, it could be found that wage dispersion under opened central collective <b>bargaining</b> coverage is slightly wider compared to non-opened central <b>bargaining</b> regime...|$|R

In this chapter, we conceptualise the key aspects of collective <b>bargaining.</b> We cite examples from many industrialised market economies (IMEs) to demonstrate the diversity of approaches to studying and working in this important field.
