5|$|Homer {{stops by}} the Kwik-E-Mart {{on the way}} home from work, and {{witnesses}} a robbery committed by a masked clown, resembling Krusty. He identifies the clown as Krusty to the police, and Krusty is arrested, upsetting Bart, who considers him to be his idol. During his trial the next day, Krusty is revealed to be illiterate. After being called out to the stand, Homer points out Krusty as the robber, and he is convicted and sentenced to jail. The community then gathers up in a public burning as they <b>burn</b> <b>up</b> all of Krusty's merchandise. Krusty's sidekick Sideshow Bob becomes the new host of his show, making it a more educational program. Still refusing to accept that his hero could have committed the crime, Bart enlists the help of a reluctant Lisa and they set out to prove Krusty's innocence.|$|E
5|$|Natalya accompanies Bond to the Caribbean. Surveying the Cuban jungle aerially, {{their light}} {{aircraft}} is shot down. Unscathed, Bond and Natalya perform a ground {{search of the}} area's heavily guarded jungle terrain, but are ambushed by Xenia, who is quickly killed by Bond. Bond sneaks Natalya into the control centre to disrupt transmissions to the GoldenEye satellite and force it to <b>burn</b> <b>up</b> in the Earth's atmosphere. He then follows the fleeing Trevelyan {{through a series of}} flooded caverns, eventually arriving at the antenna of the control centre's radio telescope. Trevelyan attempts to re-align it in a final attempt to restore contact with the GoldenEye, but Bond ultimately destroys machinery vital to controlling the antenna and defeats Trevelyan in a gunfight on a platform above the dish.|$|E
5|$|Earth's {{biosphere}} {{has significantly}} altered its atmosphere. Oxygenic photosynthesis evolved , forming the primarily nitrogen–oxygen atmosphere of today. This change enabled {{the proliferation of}} aerobic organisms and, indirectly, {{the formation of the}} ozone layer due to the subsequent conversion of atmospheric O2 into O3. The ozone layer blocks ultraviolet solar radiation, permitting life on land. Other atmospheric functions important to life include transporting water vapor, providing useful gases, causing small meteors to <b>burn</b> <b>up</b> before they strike the surface, and moderating temperature. This last phenomenon is known as the greenhouse effect: trace molecules within the atmosphere serve to capture thermal energy emitted from the ground, thereby raising the average temperature. Water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and ozone are the primary greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Without this heat-retention effect, the average surface temperature would be −18°C, in contrast to the current +15°C, and life on Earth probably would not exist in its current form. In May 2017, glints of light, seen as twinkling from an orbiting satellite a million miles away, were found to be reflected light from ice crystals in the atmosphere.|$|E

5|$|On July 4, David {{demonstrates}} {{that the key to}} defeating the aliens lies in deactivating their force fields, and devises a way to do so by uploading a computer virus into the mothership. He proposes using the refurbished alien fighter to implement the plan, which Steven volunteers to pilot. The two are able to upload the virus and deploy a nuclear weapon on board the mothership. With military pilots in short supply, Thomas enlists the help of volunteers with flight experience, including Russell, and leads an attack on a saucer bearing down on Area 51. With the aliens' shields deactivated, the fighters are able to inflict damage, but their supply of missiles is quickly exhausted. As the saucer prepares to fire on the base, Russell has one last missile to spare, but his attempt of firing it jams, leaving him no choice but to sacrifice his own life. He flies his plane kamikaze-style into the directed-energy weapon port, which results in an explosion that destroys the saucer. Human resistance forces around the world successfully destroy the other saucers using this vulnerability. As humankind is rejoicing in victory, Steven and David return to Area 51 unharmed and reunite with their families. They and military officers nearby accompany Thomas and his daughter in watching the wreckage from the mothership <b>burn</b> <b>up,</b> resembling a fireworks display as it enters Earth's atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|The station {{started to}} trial the {{co-firing}} of petcoke (petroleum coke) {{in one of}} its boilers in June 2005, ending in June 2007, burning 15% petcoke and 85% coal. Petcoke was burned to make the electricity more competitive as the price of running the FGD equipment was making the electricity more expensive. The Environment Agency (EA) granted permission for the trial in June 2004, despite the plans being opposed by Friends of the Earth and Selby Council. To meet their concerns, emissions were constantly monitored through the trial, and they were not allowed to burn petcoke without operating the FGD plant to remove the high sulphur content of the emissions. The trial proved that there were no significant negative effects on the environment, and so in late 2007 Drax Group applied to move from trial conditions to commercial burn. The EA granted permission in early 2008 after agreeing with Drax's findings that the fuel had no significant negative effects on the environment. The station can now <b>burn</b> <b>up</b> to 300,000 tonnes of the fuel a year, and stock up to 6,000 tonnes on site.|$|E

25|$|To improve {{environmental}} emissions, Longannet {{was fitted}} with 'Low-NOx' burners {{to limit the}} formation of oxides of nitrogen and a 'gas reburn system' that used natural gas to convert NOx into nitrogen and water vapour. Longannet used to <b>burn</b> <b>up</b> to 65,000 tonnes of treated and dried sewage sludge per year, which has a similar calorific value to low-quality brown coal. In 2005, a judge ruled the burning of sludge as illegal, but the SEPA continued to allow Scottish Power to burn the sludge illegally {{as part of an}} agreement which originally required Scottish Power to construct, and have in operation, a biomass plant in 2010.
