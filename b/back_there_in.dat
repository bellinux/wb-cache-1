25|$|Just {{behind the}} presumed {{position}} of the stomach a very conspicuous large and thick intestine is visible, that {{has been identified as}} the duodenum. It is preserved partly {{in the form of a}} natural endocast, partly as a petrification still showing the cellular structure, including the mucosa and connective tissue. Some mesenteric blood vessels cover the intestine in the form of up to a centimetre long and 0.02 to 0.1 millimetre wide hollow tubes. The duodenum forms a large loop, the descending part of which first is directed downwards towards the gastralia and then runs to the <b>back.</b> <b>There</b> <b>in</b> a sharp bend, the folds of which are clearly visible, it turns to the front, proceeding as an ascending tract, its visible part ending near the stomach. At this point the tract is directed to the left of the body, perpendicular to the fossil slab, and its course can thus no longer be followed. Nearby and slightly above, a subsequent intestine part surfaces that has been interpreted as the jejunum. This thinner intestine turns to the back, running parallel to the ascending tract of the duodenum and ultimately disappearing under it, at the level of the twelfth dorsal vertebra. Apparently a loop to the front is made because it resurfaces below the tenth dorsal vertebra, first running upwards and then turning to the back below the hind vertebral column — or at places even over it: probably after death its position partly shifted upwards. The jejunum seems to blend with an exceptionally short ileum. A contraction below the thirteenth dorsal vertebra might indicate the transition to the rectum. A caecum seems absent. The rectum runs to the back between the upper shafts of the pubes and ischia. Then it bends downwards parallel to the ischium shaft, at the end of it turning upwards again. In this final part faeces are still present. The cloaca is lacking. Dal Sasso & Maganuco suggested the cloaca exit was rather low, at the level of the ischial feet and that a rectocoprodaeal valve separated faeces and urine.|$|E

500|$|For the 30th {{anniversary of}} The Joshua Tree, U2 staged a 2017 concert tour in North America, Europe, and Latin America, {{on which the}} album was played in its {{entirety}} at each show. It {{was the first time}} the group toured in promotion of an album from their back catalogue, rather than a new release. As part of the tour, U2 headlined the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Manchester, Tennessee in June. In rationalising the tour, the Edge cited the 2016 US presidential election and other world events for what he judged to be renewed resonance of The Joshua Trees subject matter. He said that in looking at the record's anniversary, [...] "things have kind of come full circle, if you want. That record was written in the mid-Eighties, during the Reagan–Thatcher era of British and U.S. politics. It was a period when there was a lot of unrest. Thatcher was in the throes of trying to put down the miners' strike; there was all kinds of shenanigans going on in Central America. It feels like we're right <b>back</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> a way. I don't think any of our work has ever come full circle to that extent. It just felt like, 'Wow, these songs have a new meaning and a new resonance today that they didn't have three years ago, four years ago.'" ...|$|E

500|$|Shortly {{after leaving}} his car, Martin felt the {{championship}} was an achievement {{that he was}} unable to secure: [...] "They tell me {{a lot of people are}} having trouble anyway, but we didn't need to throw that away," [...] He said he was unaware that Yeley intended to make a pit stop and, from his viewpoint, it allowed Kenseth to pass him while Yeley was coming from the centre of the track. Yeley said the pit stop was planned and signalled his intentions to Martin for over a mile. He felt Martin placed him in a position to hit the backstretch wall. Hamlin said the first-lap crash that he was involved in was part of auto racing, and stated it was problematic being involved in difficulties in the Chase for the Nextel Cup: [...] "We checked up and somebody else (Waltrip) didn't. I put myself <b>back</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> qualifying. We'll take our lumps and go on." [...] Seventh-place finisher Raines was happy to hold the first position for 28 laps saying it was [...] "extra special" [...] to lead a race at Charlotte. Tom Bowles of Frontstretch opined that had the caution flag not been displayed for the three safety vehicles on lap nine, it could have resulted in [...] "one of the most disastrous accidents in NASCAR history." ...|$|E
2500|$|During {{a lull in}} the riot, a young {{officer on}} Patterson's video appealed for {{understanding}} from the protesters. He tried to calmly tell them how unhappy the police were with the assignment and its aftermath. [...] "We've got cops <b>back</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> ambulances who've been hit." [...] But the lull ended. Thirty to seventy protesters re-entered the park. A witness said the mob rammed a police barricade through the glass door of the Christodora House, a high-rise luxury building on Avenue B. They overturned planters and tore a lamp out of the wall, threatened residents and staff with bodily harm, and screamed and chanted [...] "Die Yuppie Scum". At 6 a.m., the last protesters dispersed, vowing to demonstrate again.|$|E
2500|$|In April 1983 the Federal Government tasked a Mirage jet {{and later}} an RF-111, from the Royal Australian Air Force, {{to perform a}} {{reconnaissance}} mission over the dam {{as part of its}} case that the Tasmanian Government was not complying with Federal legislation to stop work. A photograph of the Franklin River taken on one of these missions (and showing the construction road) was signed after the case by all the judges involved and a copy is displayed in the Australian National University College of Law staff library. On 1 July 2008, twenty five years after the High Court decision that saved the Franklin River an anniversary dinner was held at Hobart's Grand Chancellor Hotel where former Australian Prime Minister Bob Hawke stated that the campaign to protect the Franklin River had important lessons for the struggle against global warming: [...] "And as you look at the arguments and the positions of political parties today you see a complete replication of what we experienced <b>back</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> 1983. The conservatives: they never change, they never learn. What was their argument back then? You can't do this, it will cost jobs. It will cost economic growth. You can't do it, you mustn't do it." ...|$|E

2500|$|The band {{subsequently}} started afresh {{in early}} 2012, returning to Droste's mother's home in Cape Cod, where the band had previously recorded its second studio album, Yellow House (2006). Commenting {{on the return}} to Yellow House, Droste noted, [...] "It's so funny that we went <b>back</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> the end. It's my grandmother's house, we know it, and we can use it for free. And {{as soon as we}} got there, things started happening. [...] We just sat by the fire, Dan strumming, me singing, and it happened. Some of the best songs on the record, like [...] "Speak in Rounds" [...] and [...] "Half Gate", came out of that. We stayed there in isolation for two months straight." [...] Droste stated that he and Rossen decided to [...] "'try writing from the bottom up. We've never done it before.' There's a little bit of fear there because it's a new process we've never tried. We've never sat side by side and said, 'Let's literally, out of the ether, start writing songs together.' A couple of songs came that way, and that's why they're verse me, chorus Dan. [...] Suddenly the synergy hit, and the momentum struck, and then everyone got excited. And that's when the ball started to roll, and then we just started playing around, and people were much more open."" ...|$|E
2500|$|... 20 trams {{were built}} by Brush in 1937. These are {{single-deck}} cars that closely resemble the original English Electric railcoaches, but have more pointed ends. They were originally numbered 284–303, with eighteen survivors being renumbered 621–638 in 1968 (301 and 303 having been mothballed and scrapped without being renumbered). 638 was experimentally converted as a driver-only operated tram in 1969 with doors {{built at the}} ends for entry, but the experiment was deemed a failure due to the layout and seating capacity reduction; 638 was converted back into a conventional Brush railcoach. 638 was withdrawn from service in 1980 requiring an overhaul, but was scrapped in 1984 after being deemed surplus to requirements. 629 was withdrawn in 1972 requiring an overhaul, but was scrapped in 1980 due to Rigby Road workshops working throughout the 1970s on the OMO rebuild programme. 628 was withdrawn in 1969 due to a collision with Balloon car 726. The body of 628 was scrapped, but the underframe was converted into a rail carrying trailer with a rail crane installed. 628 was renumbered to 748 and then 260. 633 was rebuilt as the illuminated Trawler and was renumbered to 737 in 2008. One Brush car, No. 631, was retained by Blackpool Transport for their heritage fleet of trams and has been restored back to its 1950s condition. Although its restoration {{has not yet been}} completed and some features of its 1990s rebuild remain, it re-entered service in May 2013. 622 was given to Anchorsholme Primary School for use as a static classroom. 626 was sold to Peel Holdings. 636 was sold to Stored Energy Technology to test experimental equipment. All of the other Brush cars were acquired for preservation due to the modernisation of the tramway in 2011-2012. In December 2013, former Permanent Way car 259 (624, originally 287) and 632 which were preserved by the Lancastrian Transport Trust, returned to Rigby Road Depot from outside storage and await repaints and repairs before they can re-enter service as part of the heritage fleet. 621 was preserved at Beamish museum until 2016 when the tram was donated to the heritage fleet in Blackpool and moved <b>back</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> December 2016. 621 will return to service in September 2017, painted in 1950s green and cream livery. 623, painted in 1940s wartime green and cream livery, is in operation at Heaton Park Tramway, Manchester. In 2017, it went on loan to the Blackpool Tramway for the 80th anniversary of the Brush railcoach cars. 625 is privately preserved and is currently stored in Rigby Road Depot. 290 (627) is preserved by Fleetwood Heritage Leisure Trust. 630 is in operation at the National Tramway Museum, Crich. 630 was rebuilt in the 1990s with modern indicator headlamps, electrical equipment and bus-type seats. It remains in this condition as a reminder of this period of Blackpool's tramway history. 634 was privately sold and was on static display at the North Eastern Electrical Traction Trust museum painted in 1990s green and cream livery until 2016 when the tram was donated to the heritage fleet in Blackpool by its owner and returned to Blackpool in February 2016 and will re-enter service in the future. 298 (635) was preserved by the National Tramway Museum, Crich and remains stored. 637 is privately preserved and is currently stored in Fleetwood.|$|E
