5000|$|A “balance sheet mechanism” {{focuses on}} {{institutional}} features of financial markets. It provides {{an explanation for}} feedback loop mechanisms between the asset prices and balance sheets, and investors' preference for liquidity. The idea is that if investors' <b>balance</b> sheets depend <b>on</b> <b>asset</b> prices under delegated investment management, then a negative asset price shock tightens the investors' balance sheets, forcing them to liquidate assets, and makes investors prefer more liquid and less risky assets. Forced liquidation and changes in investors' preferences further lower asset prices and deteriorate the balance sheets, amplifying the initial shock. Vayanos models how a relationship between fund managers and clients can lead to effective risk aversion when illiquidity risk rises due to asset price volatility. He and Krishnamurthy introduce principal-agent problem to a model to show how specialists’ capital investments are pro-cyclical. Brunnermeier and [...] Pedersen model margin requirement and show how volatility of asset prices tightens the requirement that lead to asset sales.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we study {{acquired}} credit unions and analyze their financial performance {{up to six}} years prior to merger, on a quarterly basis. The primary focus is <b>on</b> <b>balance</b> sheet (<b>asset</b> liability management) and profitability variables (return <b>on</b> <b>assets).</b> We find that acquired credit unions during the period 2008 (third quarter) to 2014 (first quarter) experienced negative return <b>on</b> <b>assets</b> for several quarters prior to their takeover. This {{was the result of}} a declining loan portfolio and increasing charge offs. In spite of decreasing lending activity, such credit unions continued to increase their deposits, i. e., adding to their cost base. Due to declining loans, their net interest margin as a proportion of deposits was also in decline. We argue that this is an indicator of poor management ability. Furthermore, our analysis finds that operating expenses were increasing over time, something that has been documented in previous literature also for smaller credit unions and is attributable to lack of economies of scale. The average asset size of the acquired credit unions in our sample is about $ 22 million just before acquisition. We attribute our findings to poor business strategy followed by such credit unions. We also conclude that signs of trouble are evident up to two years before merger on average and regulatory policy may have to become more proactive to manage the consolidation challenge faced by the credit union industry in general...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Title: The exact title used in {{the thesis}} will be {{mentioned}} here. Level: Bachelor thesis in BusinessAuthor: Mattias Lindqvist & Jonas TesfaySupervisor: Peter LindbergDate: 2011 – JuneAim: In Sweden the representation of women on company boards is discussed extensively. It has also been suggested that regulations such as quotas should be imposed, in hopes of getting the gender <b>balance</b> <b>on</b> the board of directors. Measures such as these have been presented when this problem attacks our democratic values about how a society should look like. The aim is to study and analyze whether there is any connection between the return <b>on</b> <b>assets</b> {{and the proportion of}} women on company boards. Method: The paper is made from a quantitative with a deductive approach. We have collected our data between the years 2005 - 2009 for all listed companies on the Stockholm Stock Exchange with headquarters in Sweden. Using the databases Retriever and SIS Ägarservice, all collected secondary data have been validated. We have done a regression analysis using TSP Version 5. 0. Result & Conclusions: We have in this study demonstrated that there is no correlation between the return <b>on</b> <b>assets</b> and the share of women in the board of directors. However one reason for the increase of women in the board of directors could be caused by the public debate about women. Suggestions for future research: Our proposal for further research is to locate the variables that have a higher coefficient of determination. Another proposal is to investigate the reasons for more women appointed to the board because the company already has a high profitability. A third issue is to measure non-visible variables. Contribution of the thesis: We believe that the contribution is the non-correlation result between the percentage of women on the board and return <b>on</b> <b>assets.</b> Key words: Return <b>on</b> total <b>assets,</b> Women, Boards of companies, Risk Aversio...|$|R

50|$|This {{technique}} is often employed {{in a year}} when sales are down from other external factors and the company would report a loss in any event. For example, inventory valued on the books at $100 per item is written down to $50 per item resulting in a net loss of $50 per item in the current year. Note there is no cash impact to this write-down. When that same inventory is sold in later years for $75 per item, the company reports an income of $25 per item in the future period. This process takes an inventory loss and turns it into a ‘profit’. Corporations will often wait until a bad year to employ this ‘big bath’ technique to ‘clean up’ the balance sheet. Although the process is discouraged by auditors, it is still used. In recent times, General Motors and other US Corporations have taken huge write downs <b>on</b> <b>balance</b> sheet <b>assets</b> resulting in massive losses. The same result can be achieved by recording in one year the future cash costs of expected plant closing or employee layoffs. The objective is to take these loses all at once, so future periods can show positive net income.|$|R
