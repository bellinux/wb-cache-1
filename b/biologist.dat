5|$|In the 19th century, Belgian {{physicist}} Joseph Plateau examined soap films, {{leading him}} to formulate {{the concept of}} a minimal surface. German <b>biologist</b> and artist Ernst Haeckel painted hundreds of marine organisms to emphasise their symmetry. Scottish <b>biologist</b> D'Arcy Thompson pioneered the study of growth patterns in both plants and animals, showing that simple equations could explain spiral growth. In the 20th century, British mathematician Alan Turing predicted mechanisms of morphogenesis which give rise to patterns of spots and stripes. Hungarian <b>biologist</b> Aristid Lindenmayer and French American mathematician Benoît Mandelbrot showed how the mathematics of fractals could create plant growth patterns.|$|E

5|$|Born in October 1901 in Wyndmere, North Dakota, Hilliard {{received}} his B.S. degree from Hamline University in St. Paul, Minnesota at 24 years of age.

5|$|Catherine Hicks plays Doctor Gillian Taylor, a <b>biologist</b> on 20th century Earth. During {{production}} a rumor circulated {{that the}} part {{had been created}} after Shatner demanded a love interest, a regular aspect of the television series that was absent from the first three films. Writer Nicholas Meyer denied this, saying that the inspiration for Taylor came from a woman <b>biologist</b> featured in a National Geographic documentary about whales. Nimoy chose Hicks after inviting her to lunch with Shatner and witnessing a chemistry between the two. The role was originally written for Eddie Murphy as an astrophysicist at Berkeley.|$|E
5|$|Examining both {{morphological}} {{and genetic}} (cytochrome b) characters in 2008, German <b>biologist</b> Michael Wink and colleagues {{concluded that the}} southern boobook is distinct from the morepork and Tasmanian boobook (which they proposed to be raised to species status as Ninox leucopsis), {{and that it is}} instead the sister taxon to the barking owl (N. connivens). A 2017 study by Singapore-based <b>biologist</b> Chyi Yin Gwee and colleagues analysing both multi-locus DNA and boobook calls confirmed a sister relationship of leucopsis and novaeseelandiae and their close relationship to connivens. Additionally, genetic and call analysis show the Christmas boobook (N. natalis) to be very close to the Australian populations of the southern boobook, leading Gwee and colleagues to suggest it be reclassified within this species.|$|E
40|$|High-throughput omics {{technologies}} generate huge datasets on the protein, transcript, lipid, and metabolite {{content of}} cells. By integrating and analyzing these data, systems <b>biologists</b> study complex networks {{of physical and}} functional interactions that go beyond the traditional focus on individual proteins or linear pathways. Many cell <b>biologists</b> have greeted these developments with healthy skepticism, complaining that long lists of genes or “hairballs” of interactions provide little insight into biological questions of genuine meaning. As omics techniques move beyond acquisition into hypothesis-driven applications, the chasm between systems <b>biologists</b> and cell <b>biologists</b> is narrowing {{and the benefits of}} working together are increasingly clear. While cell <b>biologists</b> need omics and computer analyses to extend their understanding of biological processes, omics scientists need cell <b>biologists</b> to help them interpret and use their vast amounts of data...|$|R
25|$|GenMAPP was {{developed}} by <b>biologists</b> and is focused on pathway visualization for bench <b>biologists.</b> Unlike many other computational systems biology tools, GenMAPP is not designed for cell/systems modeling; it focuses on the immediate needs of bench <b>biologists</b> by enabling them to rapidly interpret genomic data with an intuitive, easy-to-use interface.|$|R
5000|$|While [...] "biologist" [...] {{can apply}} to any {{scientist}} studying biology, most <b>biologists</b> research and specialise in specific fields. In this way, <b>biologists</b> investigate large-scale organism interactions (ecology), whole multicellular organisms, organs, tissues, cells, and small-scale cellular and molecular processes. Other <b>biologists</b> study less direct aspects of life, such as phylogeny and evolution.|$|R

40|$|Images (e. g., figures) are {{important}} experimental {{results that are}} typically reported in bioscience full-text articles. <b>Biologists</b> need to access images to validate research facts and to formulate or to test novel research hypotheses. On the other hand, <b>biologists</b> live {{in an age of}} information explosion. As thousands of biomedical articles are published every day, systems that help <b>biologists</b> efficiently access images in literature would greatly facilitate biomedical research. We hypothesize that much of image content reported in a full-text article can be summarized by the sentences in the abstract of the article. In our study, more than one hundred <b>biologists</b> had tested this hypothesis and more than 40 <b>biologists</b> had evaluated a novel user-interface BioEx that allows <b>biologists</b> to access images directly from abstract sentences. Our results show that 87. 8 % <b>biologists</b> were in favor of BioEx over two other baseline user-interfaces. We further developed systems that explored hierarchical clustering algorithms to automatically identify abstract sentences that summarize the images. One of the systems achieves a precision of 100 % that corresponds to a recall of 4. 6 %. Contact...|$|R
40|$|Teaching physics to <b>biologists</b> {{requires}} {{far more}} than making the course for engineers mathematically less rigorous and adding in a few superficial biological problems. What is needed is for physicists {{to work closely with}} <b>biologists</b> to learn not only what physics topics and habits of mind that are useful to <b>biologists,</b> but how <b>biologists</b> work is fundamentally different from ours, and how to bridge that gap. In this article, we discussed what we have learned about these issues from years of conversations with colleagues in biology...|$|R

50|$|A similar {{problem is}} faced by {{evolutionary}} <b>biologists.</b> Just as cosmologists have {{a sample size}} of one universe, <b>biologists</b> have a sample size of one fossil record. The problem {{is closely related to}} the anthropic principle.|$|R
5|$|Readers of Aristotle {{have found}} the four causes that he uses in his {{biological}} explanations opaque, something not helped by many centuries of confused exegesis. For a biological system, these are however straightforward enough. The material cause is simply what a system is constructed from. The goal (final cause) and formal cause are what something is for, its function: to a modern <b>biologist,</b> such teleology describes adaptation {{under the pressure of}} natural selection. The efficient cause is how a system moves and develops: to a modern <b>biologist,</b> those are explained by developmental biology and physiology. Biologists continue to offer explanations of these same kinds.|$|E

30|$|A large {{proportion}} of faculty from at least two different departments were relatively well aware of formative assessment (chemists and <b>biologists),</b> case studies (<b>biologists</b> and physicists), and computer simulations (chemists and physicists).

SALG, concept maps, and SCALE-UP were among the least well-known EBIPs across all three departments.
