In 2011, Rajinikanth announced his support for the anti-corruption movement led by Gandhian Anna Hazare and offered his marriage hall, the Raghavendra Kalyana Mandapam, in Chennai free of cost for the India Against Corruption members to hold their fast.

This paper provides an empirical test of how material incentives aect <b>blood</b> <b>donations</b> in a large-scale eld experiment spanning three months and involving more than 10, 000 previous donors. We examine two types of incentive: a lottery ticket and a free cholesterol test. Lottery tickets signicantly increase donations, in particular among less motivated donors.

His blood type, double O negative, is very rare, however, {{and none of the}} employees at Springfield Nuclear Power Plant have it. Homer discovers that Bart has double O negative blood and urges his son to donate, promising that he will be handsomely rewarded. Bart reluctantly agrees and his <b>blood</b> <b>donation</b> saves Mr. Burns' life. Mr. Burns is rejuvenated by the blood and he sends the Simpson family a thank you card. Enraged at Mr. Burns' paltry gesture, Homer writes an insulting reply, but Marge convinces him at the last minute not to send it. The next morning, Homer discovers that the letter is gone as Bart has mailed it.|$|E

25|$|The {{history of}} {{voluntary}} <b>blood</b> <b>donation</b> in India {{dates back to}} 1942 {{during the second world}} war, when blood donors were required to help the wounded soldiers. The first blood bank was established in Kolkata, West Bengal in March 1942 at the All India Institute of Hygiene and Public Health and was managed by the Red Cross. The donors were mostly government employees and people from the Anglo-Indian community who donated blood for a humanitarian cause. The number of voluntary donors declined after the war and donors had to be paid for the blood. Leela Moolgaonkar, a social reformer, initiated voluntary <b>blood</b> <b>donation</b> camps in Mumbai from 1954. The 1960s saw many blood banks open in different cities.
