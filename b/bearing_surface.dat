Solid-sawn timber and glulam posts are generally notched to form a truss <b>bearing</b> <b>surface.</b> The truss is rested on the notches and bolted into place. A special plate/bracket may be added to increase connection load transfer capabilities. With mechanically-laminated posts, the truss may rest on a shortened outer-ply or on a shortened inner-ply. The later scenario places the bolts in double shear and is a very effective connection.|$|E

The steam turbine generator, being rotating equipment, generally has a heavy, large-diameter shaft.

The Romans are credited with the invention of the solid-treed saddle, possibly as early as the 1st century BC, and it was widespread by the 2nd century AD.

The development of the solid saddle tree was significant; it raised the rider above the horse's back, and distributed the rider's weight, reducing the pounds per square inch carried on any one part of the horse's back, thus [...] greatly increasing the comfort of the horse and prolonging its useful life. Horses could carry more weight when distributed across a solid saddle tree. [...] It also allowed a more built up seat to give the rider greater security in the saddle. [...] From the 12th century on, the high war-saddle became more common, providing protection as well as added security. The built up cantle of a solid-treed saddle enabled horsemen to use lance more effectively.|$|E

2500|$|When fired, {{a portion}} of the {{propellant}} gases are evacuated into the gas cylinder through a [...] port, drilled at a 30° angle in the barrel, and a channel in the gas block. The high-pressure gases drive the piston rod (which is attached to the bolt carrier) rearward. During this rearward movement, a cam slot machined into the bolt carrier engages a cam pin on the bolt and rotates the bolt, unlocking the action. The arrangement of parts on the bolt carrier assembly provides for a degree of free travel, allowing gas pressure in the barrel to drop to a safe level before unlocking. To the immediate rear of the chrome-plated piston head is a notched ring which provides a reduced <b>bearing</b> <b>surface</b> and alleviates excess gas build-up. As the bolt carrier travels back, it compresses the return spring guided in a hollowed section of the bolt carrier and the return energy contained in the spring drives the moving assembly back forward, stripping a new round from the magazine and locking the action. The cocking handle is attached to the bolt carrier {{on the right side of}} the receiver and reciprocates with each shot; the handle is bent upwards allowing for operation with the left hand while the shooting hand remains on the pistol grip.|$|E

The goal of this research is to develop a better fundamental understanding of all of the complex modes of failure in <b>bearing</b> <b>surfaces</b> which can then be used to design new materials with sufficient longevity for use in a total joint replacement or other bearing applications. It has been proposed to use elastomeric composites as artificial joints <b>bearing</b> <b>surfaces</b> to increase their fluid film lubrication and therefore reduce their failure attributed to wear mechanisms. The fluid generated between the surfaces supports part of the load and prevents direct contact of the <b>bearing</b> <b>surfaces.</b> However, permanent deformation or failure of elastomeric composites has been observed following debonding between fiber and matrix. It is hypothesized that heat generated at the contact between the elastomeric composite and the reciprocating counter part contributes significantly to failure of the elastomer. A preliminary study was conducted to determine the effectiveness of a tribological experimental model to verify this hypothesis. The coefficient of friction between UHMWPE and metal and an unreinforced polyurethane elastomer bearing against metal was measured using reciprocating motion. The next phase of this project will consist of using this experimental model to analyze the effect of friction on the failure of elastomeric composites composed of polyurethane matrix and fibers...|$|R
40|$|Summary The taper {{junction}} is {{an important}} source of implant-derived metal debris but in the majority of cases contributes significantly less to the overall volumetric material loss than the <b>bearing</b> <b>surfaces.</b> Introduction There have been several reports of higher failure rates for stemmed large head metal-on-metal (LH-MOM) hip arthroplasties when compared to the same bearing used as a resurfacing. This has been attributed to material loss from the head-stem taper junction. The contribution of the taper junction to the total material loss remains poorly understood. The {{purpose of this study was}} to quantify the volumetric wear of both <b>bearing</b> <b>surfaces</b> and the taper junction, and investigate any relationships with blood metal ion levels and commonly reported clinical variables. Methods This was a study of 48 consecutively collected stemmed LH-MOM retrieval cases. The series included several contemporary designs of MOM hip. We recorded all relevant clinical data, including pre-revision whole blood cobalt and chromium ion levels and component position. Volumetric wear of the <b>bearing</b> <b>surfaces</b> was measured using a coordinate measuring machine, and of the taper surface (Figure 1) using a roundness measuring machine. Results The mean volumetric wear of the <b>bearing</b> <b>surfaces</b> (combined head and cup) was significantly higher than the volumetric material loss at the taper (Table 1). Similarly the mean contribution of the <b>bearing</b> <b>surfaces</b> to the total material loss was significantly greater than that from the taper (Table 1). In only 13 (27...|$|R
