50|$|In {{batch drying}} methods, {{certain amount of}} grain is placed first, usually 2 to 4 inches, the batch is dried and cooled later, then drying is stopped and batch is removed. The <b>batch</b> <b>dryers</b> are usually {{operating}} under this sequence and repeating this sequence for several times. The bin-batch drying methods employ a full perforated floor as the dryer. Without stirring, large variety of equipment is available and the batch {{can be used as}} both dryer and cooler, but there may be large moisture gradient from top to bottom and losing time in loading and unloading process. When adding stirring system, unequilibrium moisture content problem is avoided, however, stirrer is an added expense. When using bin-batch roof dryer, time losing problem can be solved. There is a drying floor under the bin roof and the drying fan and burner is installed high on the bin wall. When the drying process is completed, grain is put in the regular bin floor, thus unloading time is reduced. However, there is no wet grain holding in bin-batch roof dryers and there is more expense on machines.|$|R
5000|$|USFA {{reported}} {{that there were a}} total of seven explosions during the accident. Eyewitness testimony and the Dennis Todd video which began after the first detonation and other resources indicated there were five high order detonations, one north of the <b>batch</b> <b>dryer,</b> one in the storage area south of the administration building, two on the loading dock and the final largest detonation in the eastern storage area, where the gas line burned after the detonations occurred. [...] The two largest produced waves measuring 3.0 and 3.5 on the Richter scale. Much of the approximately 4,500 metric tons of AP either burned/decomposed in combination with a fuel or exploded, with the final detonation creating a crater 15 ft deep and 200 ft long in the eastern storage area. [...] A significant quantity of AP remained on the ground after the incident and material was subsequently recovered and recycled within 1 year. [...] The largest explosion released estimated energy of approximately 1.0 kilotons of TNT according to one source.|$|E
5000|$|The USDOL report, however, {{discounted}} {{this theory}} while relying upon eyewitness testimony and scientific burn tests. [...] There were ten individuals who provided testimony that {{indicated that they}} had observed the fire and/or participated in fire-fighting activities early on.

USDOL stated that sparks from such operations would not present enough energy to ignite ordinary combustibles in close proximity, let alone at distances of up to 70 ft and concluded that the possibility of welding and cutting operations as a source of ignition is considered very low, in the author's professional opinion ...|$|E
5000|$|Both the USFA and USDOL reports {{noted that}} the flames spread to 55 gal plastic drums {{containing}} the product that were stored next to the building as employees {{tried in vain to}} put the fire out inside the building with water hoses.

USDOL reported this differently stating that the fire spread rapidly to the north side of the partition, northeast and south walls by radiative and convective heat transfer. [...] The extremely rapid fire spread in the process building and subsequent growth to other buildings was primarily due to the highly combustible fiberglass reinforced siding panels and close spacing of adjacent buildings. [...] High winds blowing in a northeasterly direction were a contributing factor. [...] Product stored in an area north of the process building heated up and approximately 7 minutes later at 11:51 a.m., an aluminum econobin containing approximately 4000 lb of AP, located about 30 ft west of the northwest corner of the building detonated causing damage to the surrounding structures and <b>batch</b> <b>dryer.</b>|$|E

Then, genetic algorithm is employed to tune the parameters of the controller to minimize the value of the performance function. In this paper, different performance functions are defined based on the importance of energy consumption for the designer; consequently, different controllers are designed.

To improve the understanding of drying mechanisms, the penetration theory developed by Schlünder and co-workers for mono and multi dispersed packing is used to represent the experimental results from a laboratory scale dryer. For granular packing, the only adjustment parameter of the model is the mixing number, which characterizes the dryer and its stirrer. For pasty-like materials, the pasty phase is assumed to be a saturated particulate phase. As the calculation of the effective properties calculation is cumbersome for a multi-granular packing, the particulate phase is considered as a mono-dispersed packing, whose dimension is unknown. To identify the two adjustment parameters, the mixing number was quantified from experiments performed on activated alumina balls, for which physical and thermal characteristics are known, and then the characteristic dimension of the sludge was determined by adjustment of experimental drying kinetics measured in a <b>batch</b> agitated <b>dryer.</b> According to this model, drying is exclusively controlled by the contact resistance between the wall and the biggest particles contained in the dewatered sludge.

Relative humidity of hot air was kept at 15 % in all drying temperatures. Several empirical relationships were developed for the determination of changes in densities with the moisture content. Simple mathematical models were obtained to relate apparent density and bulk density with moisture content...|$|R

Model parameter sensitivity analysis has indicated that the performance characteristics of a bath fluidized bed dryer are affected not only by the inlet gas superficial velocity and temperature, but also by the features of particle and bubble phases, in particular, the particle and bubble sizes. Experimental validation shows that the proposed lumped dynamic model can be used to predict the particle moisture content and temperature profiles during the drying process in a fluidized bed dryer. © 2008 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbHand Co.

40|$|In this paper, the {{modeling}} {{and control of}} the moisture content of the particles in a <b>batch</b> fluidized bed <b>dryer</b> are studied. First, a lumped mechanistic model is developed to describe the heat and mass transfer between solid, gas and bubble phases and experimental validation shows that the model can be used to predict the particle moisture content and temperature profiles during the drying process in the bed dryer. By validating the model both with and without an insulator {{on the wall of the}} dryer, it is shown that the wall temperature has a major effect on the process. Feedback control of material moisture content in a bed dryer is studied with tomographic sensors included in the control loop. A controller is designed to achieve a desired drying rate for wet materials. Simulations show that it is possible to control the drying rate. © 2008 AACC...|$|R
