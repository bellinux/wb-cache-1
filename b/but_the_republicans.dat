To drive their point home, they hired young partisans {{to pretend to}} be peddlers, who went door to door offering 25-cent tinware to housewives for 50 cents, explaining the rise in prices was due to the McKinley Tariff. In the end, McKinley lost by 300 votes, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> won a statewide majority and claimed a moral victory.|$|E
5|$|On April 24, 1861, Morton {{addressed}} {{a special session}} of the Indiana General Assembly to obtain the legislature's approval to borrow and spend funds to purchase arms and supplies for Indiana's troops. Morton also urged Indiana's legislators to set aside party considerations {{for the duration of}} the war and unite in defense of the Union, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> and Democrats did not cooperate for long. Initially, the Democratic-controlled legislature was supportive of Morton's measures and passed the legislation he requested. After the state legislature adjourned in May, however, some of the state's prominent Democrats changed their opinion about the war. In January 1862 the Democrats clarified their position at a state convention chaired by Thomas Hendricks. Indiana's Democrats stated that their support for the integrity of the Union and the war effort, but opposed emancipation of black and the abolition of slavery.|$|E
5|$|While the {{election}} results remained in dispute, Goebel, despite being warned of a rumored assassination plot against him, walked flanked by two bodyguards to the Old State Capitol {{on the morning of}} January 30, 1900. Reports conflict about what happened, but some five or six shots were fired from the nearby State Building, one striking Goebel in the chest and wounding him seriously. Taylor, serving as governor pending a final decision on {{the election}}, called out the militia and ordered the General Assembly into a special session, not in Frankfort, but in London, Kentucky, a Republican area. The Republican minority obeyed the call and went to London. Democrats resisted the move, many going instead to Louisville. Both groups claimed authority, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> were too few to muster a quorum.|$|E

50|$|Levi Morton was Governor of New York in 1895 and 1896.

5|$|The {{candidates}} were the same, but {{the issues of}} the campaign had shifted: free silver was still a question that animated many voters, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> focused on victory in war and prosperity at home as issues they believed favored their party. Democrats knew the war had been popular, even if the imperialism issue was less sure, so they focused on the issue of trusts and corporate power, painting McKinley as the servant of capital and big business. As in 1896, Bryan embarked on a speaking tour around the country while McKinley stayed at home, this time making only one speech, to accept his nomination. Roosevelt emerged as the campaign's primary speaker and Hanna helped the cause working to settle a coal miners strike in Pennsylvania. Bryan's campaigning failed to excite the voters as it had in 1896, and McKinley never doubted that he would be re-elected. On November 6, 1900, he was proven correct, winning the largest victory for any Republican since 1872. Bryan carried only four states outside the solid South, and McKinley even won Bryan's home state of Nebraska.|$|E
25|$|After Roosevelt's {{death in}} 1919, many of Roosevelt's former {{supporters}} backed Wood {{for the presidential}} nomination at the 1920 Republican National Convention. Wood received the most votes on the first four ballots of the convention, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> nominated Warren G. Harding for president. Wood retired from the Army in 1921 and was appointed Governor General of the Philippines later that year. He held that position {{until his death in}} 1927.|$|E
25|$|The party's {{official}} {{opposition to}} same-sex marriage came under attack. Meanwhile, social conservatives such as Rick Santorum and Mike Huckabee remained opposed to same-sex marriage {{and warned that}} evangelicals would desert if the GOP dropped the issue. Many leaders from different factions spoke out in 2013 {{on the need for}} a new immigration policy in the wake of election results showing a sharp move away from the GOP among Hispanics and Asians, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> in Congress could not agree on a program and nothing was done.

25|$|As the 1894 mid-term {{elections}} neared, Republicans {{were able}} to secure blame for the poor economic situation on the Democrats, and swept into power in the statehouse, taking strong majorities in both houses. The legislative districts created in 1890 were a subject of intense debate at the time; the legislature during the term of Governor Isaac P. Gray had created several gerrymander districts that favored Democrats. Republicans had contested the districting in the courts, who ruled the state must be redistricted. The Democrats had done so in 1893, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> overrode their redistricting upon taking power, and created their own plan which effectively reversed the situation and created pro-Republican gerrymander districts.|$|E
25|$|STV {{has some}} {{history in the}} United States. Many cities, {{including}} New York City, once used it {{to break up the}} Democratic Party monopolies on elective office. Cincinnati, Ohio, adopted STV in 1925 {{to get rid of a}} Republican Party monopoly, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> returned the city to FPTP in 1957. From 1870 to 1980, Illinois used a semi-proportional cumulative voting system to elect its House of Representatives. Each district across the state elected both Republicans and Democrats year-after-year. Cambridge, Massachusetts, (STV) and Peoria, Illinois, (cumulative voting) continue to use PR. San Francisco had citywide elections in which people would cast votes for five or six candidates simultaneously, delivering some of the benefits of proportional representation.|$|E
25|$|All {{the while}} the Delaware General Assembly was {{attempting}} to elect a U.S. Senator. Since the two houses voted together, the more numerous Republicans held an overall majority and attempted to elect Henry A. du Pont to the office. <b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> were divided and enough supported the candidacy of Addicks to barely prevent a majority from electing du Pont. Then, with accession of Watson to the Governor's office, {{the total number of}} members seemed to be reduced and du Pont had a majority. The Delaware General Assembly went to vote only to find Watson had returned to his old State Senate seat, casting his vote for the Democratic candidate, but more importantly preventing du Pont from receiving a majority. This was an unprecedented action by an Acting Governor, but the Delaware Constitution of 1831, then in effect, did not address the question. The Republican Speaker of the State House disallowed the vote and certified the election of du Pont, but the Democratic controlled U.S. Senate rejected his credentials, thereby preserving its own majority. This, of course, was the real purpose behind Watson's action. The soon to be drafted, Delaware Constitution of 1897, resolved the issue for good by creating the independent office of Lieutenant Governor.|$|E

500|$|On September 12, Willkie began a whistle-stop tour by train, {{and between}} then and November 2, he reached 31 of the 48 states. He did not visit the Solid South, though he spoke in Texas, hoping to win it as Hoover had in 1928. Willkie filled the Los Angeles Coliseum with 70,000 middle-class supporters, but reporters saw few working-class people at his rallies, and he {{cancelled}} some appearances at auto plants in the Midwest. [...] Other people in working-class areas booed the candidate, held up signs in support of Roosevelt, or pelted his motorcade with overripe fruit. Although Edith Willkie accompanied her husband on his tour (he had little time for contact with Van Doren), she disliked the media attention and did not give interviews, completing the campaign without ever giving a speech. On one occasion, {{she looked at her}} husband and stated, [...] "Politics makes strange bedfellows". The Democrats knew of Willkie's affair with Van Doren, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> had letters from Henry A. Wallace, the Democratic vice presidential nominee, to his former guru, Russian mystic Nicholas Roerich, and neither issue became a factor in the campaign.|$|E
500|$|Regarding Cleveland, {{commentator}} Jeff Jacoby notes that, [...] "Not since George Washington had {{a candidate}} for President been so renowned for his rectitude." [...] <b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> found a refutation buried in Cleveland's past. Aided by the sermons of Reverend George H. Ball, a minister from Buffalo, they made public the allegation that Cleveland had fathered an illegitimate child {{while he was a}} lawyer there, with their rallies even subsequently including the chant [...] "Ma, Ma, where's my Pa?" [...] When confronted with the scandal, Cleveland immediately instructed his supporters to [...] "Above all, tell the truth." [...] Cleveland admitted to paying child support in 1874 to Maria Crofts Halpin, the woman who asserted he had fathered her son Oscar Folsom Cleveland and he assumed responsibility. Shortly before the 1884 election, the Republican media published an affidavit from Halpin in which she stated that until she met Cleveland, her [...] "life was pure and spotless", and [...] "there is not, and never was, a doubt as to the paternity of our child, and the attempt of Grover Cleveland, or his friends, to couple the name of Oscar Folsom, or any one else, with that boy, for that purpose is simply infamous and false." ...|$|E

Mundy called it [...] "extremely insightful" [...] and said it offered [...] "a sound basis for discussion of the issue". The murder of gay U.S. Navy petty officer Allen R.
