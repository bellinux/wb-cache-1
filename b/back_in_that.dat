He doesn't necessarily think he's got his friend back, but he thinks the matters are settled. From the look of Shane in that car, I don't know that he's necessarily thinking that. For the most part, this conflict may be put on the back burner for the time being. It definitely seems like Shane still has a bone to pick.|$|E

25|$|After Greif {{had left}} Arendal, Lieutenant Holthe took Jo {{out of the}} harbour and set up an ambush east of the town in case the German warship came <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> direction. Some time later on 9 April, Jo steamed to Lyngør where she met up with Grib and Ravn. The three torpedo boats spent the next eight days trying to support the Norwegian land forces being mobilized in Telemark county, {{surviving}} several air attacks during the time. After considering evacuating the torpedo boats to the United Kingdom, and dismissing the idea as infeasible, Lieutenant Holthe and the other commanders scuttled their vessels off Lyngør on 17 April. The crews went home and the ship commanders tried to join Norwegian forces in Western Norway.|$|E

25|$|Blücher {{assigned}} {{only the}} corps of Yorck and Friedrich Graf Kleist von Nollendorf to follow Marmont. By 19 March, Blucher had established two bridges over the Aisne and sent Ferdinand von Wintzingerode's corps south to capture Reims. Wintzingerode occupied Reims at daybreak on 20 March after it was evacuated by Augustin Daniel Belliard who led Mortier's cavalry. At this hour, Louis Alexandre Andrault de Langeron's Russian corps was at Berry-au-Bac while Fabian Gottlieb von Osten-Sacken's Russian corps was nearby at Pontavert. Blücher ordered Wintzingerode to hold Reims with his infantry and send his cavalry to Épernay and Vitry-le-François. Charpentier left a 2,800-man garrison in Soissons before pulling out to join Marmont and Mortier. On 21 March, there was a cavalry scuffle at Oulchy-le-Château between Yorck and Kleist's cavalry and the French, but the Prussians did not pursue. Having picked up Charpentier's division, Marmont and Mortier crossed the Marne at Château-Thierry and destroyed the bridge. Also on the 21st, Marmont received a dispatch from Napoleon rebuking him for not retreating from Reims toward Châlons-sur-Marne and ordering him to move <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> direction. On 22 March, the two marshals headed east toward Étoges. That day Friedrich Wilhelm Freiherr von Bülow's Prussian corps appeared before Soissons and began bombarding the place.|$|E
500|$|The {{financial}} and critical success of X-Men persuaded 20th Century Fox to immediately commission a sequel. Starting in November 2000, Bryan Singer researched various storylines (one {{of them being}} the Legacy Virus) of the X-Men comic book series. Singer wanted to study, [...] "the human perspective, the kind of blind rage that feeds into warmongering and terrorism," [...] citing {{a need for a}} [...] "human villain". Bryan and producer Tom DeSanto envisioned X2 as the film series' The Empire Strikes <b>Back,</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> the characters are [...] "all split apart, and then dissected, and revelations occur that are significant… the romance comes to fruition and a lot of things happen." [...] Producer Avi Arad announced a planned November 2002 theatrical release date, while David Hayter and Zak Penn were hired to write separate scripts. Hayter and Penn combined what they felt to be the best elements of both scripts into one screenplay. Singer and Hayter worked on another script, finishing in October 2001.|$|E
500|$|Reviewing the premiere, Terri Schwartz of IGN {{praised the}} {{introduction}} of Ghost Rider and subsequent darker tone which [...] "will eventually allow [...] to sit more comfortably beside its corporate cousins over on Netflix", but did feel {{that there were some}} [...] "growing pains" [...] with the transition to more mature material. The A.V. Clubs Alex McCown-Levy called it [...] "a standard first episode <b>back,</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> it once again does a lot of table-setting, and not always in the most compelling manner". Levy felt that Ghost Rider's introduction was handled well for non-comic fans discovering the character with the show, but that the new positions of the series' main characters were more interesting and should have been focused on more. Kevin Fitzpatrick of Screen Crush said, [...] "I’m nervous for Season 4 overall, especially if said reinvention doesn’t goose the ratings like Marvel and ABC hope, but “The Ghost” is reason enough for some casual optimism." [...] He was positive about the new similarities to the darker series Daredevil, but felt that the series [...] "doesn’t have the firmest handle" [...] on Ghost Rider yet. Evan Valentine, writing for Collider.com, said that the series [...] "certainly benefits somewhat from taking a page from" [...] the Marvel Netflix series, highlighting the number of more mature elements in the episode's opening as [...] "a nice introduction that shows you this may not exactly be the same show you’ve gotten to know over the years." ...|$|E
50|$|Thornton {{was traded}} to the Toronto Argonauts in 1967 and played with them up to 1972 {{as one of the best}} {{defensive}} <b>backs</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> era. Notably, he intercepted 7 passes in 1969 from the cornerback position. He was a CFL all-star and played in the rainy 59th Grey Cup game in 1971. Despite his return of an interception of 54 yards, Toronto lost a defensive struggle to the Calgary Stampeders 14 to 11.|$|R

500|$|The A.V. Clubs Alex McCown-Levy graded {{the episode}} a [...] "B", calling it [...] "a {{standard}} first episode <b>back,</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> it once again {{does a lot}} of table-setting, and not always in the most compelling manner".

[...] He was positive about the new similarities to the darker series Daredevil, but felt that the series [...] "doesn’t have the firmest handle" [...] on Ghost Rider, either [...] "who Reyes himself is in relation to his murderous alter-ego", or in the blend of practical and digital effects—"the finished product isn't seamless just yet". He said, [...] "The junkyard battle with Daisy [...] was an understandable highlight", and praised the episode's smaller character moments like [...] "the moment of Daisy feeling as though she deserves to lose her life in battle, only for the Rider to silently disagree." [...] Rob Leane at Den of Geek compared the series' new status quo to Red Dwarf VIII and called it and many of the season's storylines being set up as [...] "pretty strong", but [...] "nothing grabbed [...] attention" [...] like the introduction of Ghost Rider, which Leane felt was [...] "a complete slam-dunk". He praised the effects for Ghost Rider and his car, and Luna's performance.|$|E
500|$|Mercedes and Riley reunite {{but when}} she discovers Riley does not love her she kidnaps Bobby in revenge and blames it on a Mitzeee, who has {{recently}} escaped from prison. Metcalfe said Mercedes does not have [...] "any regrets whatsoever. I think she does what she does at {{the time for a}} reason and she'll deal with the consequences later". Mercedes is arrested when Myra reports her to the police. Riley is shortly after shot dead. Mercedes is put on trial for two counts of perverting the course of justice, one for the kidnap and one for stabbing herself. Digital Spy's Kilkelly reported that Mercedes lawyer Jim McGinn (Dan Tetsell) would advise Mercedes to blame Riley for the crimes as he can not defend himself. Mercedes reluctantly agrees and tells the courtroom that Riley stabbed her and was abusive towards her. Metcalfe felt the scenes were [...] "great to film", adding that [...] "the writers came up with some brilliant material". However, she felt the scenes were [...] "challenging" [...] to film as Mercedes [...] "completely breaks down and says how bad Riley was. From the audience's point of view, it's really going to be quite shocking". The actress added that Mercedes [...] "does feel guilty about it, but only as guilty as Mercedes can ever feel. So she gets over it very quickly!" [...] During the trial Jim suggests that Riley killed Lynsey and that Doctor Browning is innocent. Doctor Browning appears at the trial to give evidence, which Metcalfe revealed is [...] "a total surprise. I don't think she knows how she'll react until she actually sees him, and when she does they're <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> moment when he was dragged away from her. She really did fall for him hook, line and sinker".|$|E
2500|$|According to Gough, {{they had}} a {{specific}} intention for {{the ending of the}} second season: [...] "Season one ended with the height of heroism, with Clark running into a tornado to save Lana. For season two, we wanted to see the nadir of that, which is Clark running away [...] from his problems." [...] Gough likens the finale to the ending of The Empire Strikes <b>Back,</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> Clark leaves Smallville and everyone he loves because he is scared. According to Gough, in order to do [...] "the character justice", you have to take his journey through the darkness, with him failing along the way.|$|E

2500|$|On 7 July 1994, the Fraunhofer Society {{released}} the first software MP3 encoder called l3enc. The filename extension [...]mp3 {{was chosen by}} the Fraunhofer team on 14 July 1995 (previously, the files had been named [...]bit). With the first real-time software MP3 player WinPlay3 (released 9 September 1995) many people were able to encode and play back MP3 files on their PCs. Because of the relatively small hard drives <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> time (~ 500–1000 MB) lossy compression was essential to store non-instrument based (see tracker and MIDI) music for playback on computer. As sound scholar Jonathan Sterne notes, [...] "An Australian hacker acquired l3enc using a stolen credit card. The hacker then reverse-engineered the software, wrote a new user interface, and redistributed it for free, naming it [...] "thank you Fraunhofer"".|$|E
2500|$|However, {{his start}} of {{secondary}} studies {{coincided with the}} beginning of World War I in September 1914 shortly followed with the school's financial problems, managed by a severe headmaster. Bourguiba stated that <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> time, food was terrible: They served them a stew with squash and a macaroni at lunch while giving them a donut wrapped in newspaper and smelling oil, at breakfast. These terrible conditions led the students to protest, despite the headmaster's efforts to end the revolt. When he questioned Bourguiba, the young Habib denounced these horrible conditions, declaring that he did not deserve to be treated in this manner. Thinking {{that he was about to}} be punished, nothing happened and the young boy learned to dare, speak and denounce. He was also marked by the education he had and which started in him the germs of revolt. In his before final year, Bourguiba admired a talented student named Habib Jaouahdou. Jaouahdo explained to the pupils what was happening outside the walls of Sadiki and telling them all about the nationalist movement. His Arabic skills are reinforced by a marking professor: Mohamed Lasrem, who was as old as Bach Hamba and that Bourguiba remembered by saying: [...] "I have to recognize that it is thanks to him that we have learned, since then, to express ourselves and write in classical arabic. This language was, at first, taught, mainly in the form of various versions. We had to translate administrative letters".|$|E
