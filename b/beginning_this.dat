5|$|The Byzantine success {{had another}} corollary: {{deliverance}} from constant Arab {{pressure on the}} eastern frontier allowed the Byzantine government to concentrate on affairs in Europe, and, in particular, neighboring Bulgaria.

5|$|Hergé first {{devised the}} idea of sending Tintin {{on a mission to}} the Moon while he was working on Prisoners of the Sun (1949). His {{decision}} to move into the field of science fiction might have been influenced by his friendly rivalry with his colleague Edgar P. Jacobs, who had recently had success with his own science fiction comic, The Secret of the Swordfish (1950–53). He decided {{that it would be a}} two-volume story arc, as had proved successful with his earlier arcs, The Secret of the Unicorn (1943) and Red Rackham's Treasure (1944), and The Seven Crystal Balls (1948) and Prisoners of the Sun. He had initially intended on <b>beginning</b> <b>this</b> story after the culmination of Prisoners of the Sun, but both his wife Germaine Remi and his close friend Marcel Dehaye convinced him to proceed with Land of Black Gold (1950), a story that he had previously left unfinished, instead.|$|E
5|$|Miyamoto {{created a}} greatly {{simplified}} version for the Game & Watch multiscreen. Other ports include the Amiga, Apple II, Atari 7800, Intellivision, Commodore 64, Commodore VIC-20, Famicom Disk System, IBM PC booter, ZX Spectrum, Amstrad CPC, MSX, Atari 8-bit family and Mini-Arcade versions. The game was ported to Nintendo's Family Computer (Famicom) console in 1983 {{as one of}} the system's three launch titles; the same version was an early title for the Famicom's North American version, the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES). However, the cement factory level is not included, nor are most of the cutscenes since Nintendo did not have large enough cartridge ROMs available in the <b>beginning.</b> <b>This</b> port includes a new song composed by Yukio Kaneoka for the title screen; an arrangement of the tune appears in Donkey Kong Country for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. Both Donkey Kong and its sequel, Donkey Kong Jr., are included in the 1988 NES compilation Donkey Kong Classics. The NES version was re-released as an unlockable game in Animal Crossing for the GameCube and as an item for purchase on the Virtual Console for the Wii, Wii U and Nintendo 3DS. The Wii U version is also the last game that was released to celebrate the 30-year anniversary of the Japanese version of the NES, the Famicom. The original arcade version of the game appears in the Nintendo 64 game Donkey Kong 64. Nintendo released the NES version on the e-Reader and for the Game Boy Advance Classic NES series in 2002 and 2004, respectively. The Famicom version of the game sold 840,000 units in Japan.|$|E

25|$|The iambic octonarius has two kinds, {{one with}} {{a break in the}} middle of the line, as the first pattern above. But often, instead of a mid-line break, there is a caesura or word-break 7 {{elements}} before the end of the line, so that apart from the extra syllable at the <b>beginning,</b> <b>this</b> kind somewhat resembles a trochaic septenarius.|$|E
25|$|According to {{an ancient}} {{metrical}} theory, the Greek version of this metre (trochaic tetrameter catalectic) was composed of an iambic trimeter with a cretic foot (– u –) added at the <b>beginning.</b> <b>This</b> seems to be true of the Latin trochaic septenarius too: the word break (dieresis or caesura) {{is in the same}} place seven elements {{before the end of the}} line, and Meyer's law and the locus Jacobsohnianus apply in the same way to both lines.|$|E
25|$|Important {{members of}} the {{scientific}} community were spared from Stalin's usual amount of wrath and their punishments were often lessened from what one usually would expect from the regime. In the <b>beginning</b> <b>this</b> was mainly because of ideological reasons to not harm the party by punishing someone who had received a major award or had international accreditation. Scientists were given more chances to explain their behavior or prove their innocents than average citizens because they were seen as valuable. Later, though it would be for more practical reasons as scientists became the leaders in the arms race which played a major part in the Cold War. The Soviet Science Academy would become the dominant institute where these scientists were educated and often worked.|$|E

25|$|Finally the British {{adopted the}} {{strategy}} which the locals had been recommending from the <b>beginning.</b> <b>This</b> involved dividing the vast territory into 11 military provinces and stationing a mounted garrison in each. If a rebel regiment was encountered it was chased, until it entered the next military province, {{where the next}} garrison (fresh and close to supplies) would take over the pursuit. The valley exits from the range were then fortified. Under this uninterrupted pressure the rebel forces quickly splintered and began to surrender, Sandile himself fled down into {{the valley of the}} Fish River where he was intercepted by a Fengu commando. In the final shoot out he was accidentally killed by a stray bullet. The surviving rebels were granted an amnesty.|$|E
25|$|Jewish {{religious}} tradition does not distinguish clearly between religious, national, racial, or ethnic identities. Nonetheless, during two millennia of exile {{and with a}} continuous yet small Jewish presence in the land, {{a strong sense of}} bondedness exists throughout this tradition, expressed in terms of people-hood; from the very <b>beginning,</b> <b>this</b> concept was identified with that ancestral biblical land or, to use the traditional religious and modern Hebrew term, Eretz Yisrael. Religiously and culturally the area was seen broadly as a land of destiny, and always with hope for some form of redemption and return. It was later seen as a national home and refuge, intimately related to that traditional sense of people-hood, and meant to show continuity that this land was always seen as central to Jewish life, in theory if not in practice.|$|E
25|$|<b>Beginning</b> <b>this</b> year, NASCAR {{eliminated}} traditional single car qualifying in its top 3 {{series for}} all races except the Daytona 500, the Mudsummer Classic, and non-points events. Qualifying {{will now be}} done in a Formula One-style knockout qualifying. For all tracks larger than 1.25 miles in length, qualifying will consist of all entered cars on track for 25 minutes. The fastest 24 move onto a 10-minute session, while the final 12 drivers compete for the overall pole in a 5-minute session. For tracks shorter than 1.25 miles as well as road courses, all entered cars will qualify in a 30-minute session, while the 12 fastest will compete in a final 10 minute session. A similar system involving groups of cars being released at five-second intervals was used at Sonoma Raceway and Watkins Glen International in 2013.|$|E

25|$|During {{the second}} stage (1951–1975) {{the focal point of}} {{development}} was the Faculty of Engineering, also known as the Polytechnic Faculty. At the <b>beginning,</b> <b>this</b> faculty constituted an independent institute also called the Polytechnic or Technical University. Therefore, for the first fifty years of its operation the Aristotle University consisted of two distinct institutes which operated independently. Subsequently, these two educational institutes where unified. The various Schools within the Faculty of Engineering were founded in the following order: School of Civil Engineering (1955–56), School of Architecture (1956–57), School of Rural and Surveying Engineering (1962–63), School of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering (1972–73), School of Chemical Engineering (1972–73), School of Mathematics, Physics and Computational Sciences (1982–83) and School of Urban-Regional Planning and Development Engineering (2004). The School of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering was split in two independent schools (School of Mechanical Engineering and School of Electrical and Computer Engineering) in 1976.|$|E

In the third season, the theme song was remixed in a softer piano style with dark and vibrant electronic beats to reflect the more noir-influenced opening credits.|$|E

500|$|Independence {{also did}} not result in stable {{political}} regimes, save in a few countries. First, the new nations did not have well-defined identities, but rather the process of creating identities was only <b>beginning.</b> <b>This</b> would be carried out through newspapers and the creation of national symbols, including new names for the countries ("Mexico", [...] "Colombia", [...] "Ecuador", [...] "Bolivia", [...] "Argentina"), that broke with the past. In addition, the borders were not firmly established, and the struggle between federalism and centralism, which began in independence, continued {{throughout the rest of the}} century. Two large states that emerged from the wars—Gran Colombia and the Federal Republic of Central America—collapsed after a decade or two, and Argentina would not consolidate politically until the 1860s.|$|E
500|$|From the <b>beginning,</b> <b>this</b> game went {{heavily in}} the Sooner's favor. [...] Both {{defenses}} played well, but Oklahoma's squad was able to limit Colorado to only 113total yards, 51of which came on the Buff's only scoring drive late in the fourth quarter. Oklahoma's offense was also held down, totaling only 271yards mostly on runs and short underneath passes. Allen Patrick, filling in for the injured Adrian Peterson, was the player {{of the game and}} was the first person all season to run for over 100yards against Colorado. [...] He managed 110yards on 35carries with one touchdown run early in the fourth. [...] For 218consecutive games across 18years, the Buffaloes had not been shut out; kicker Mason Crosby saved the streak with a 39yard field goal into the wind late in the game.|$|E
500|$|The {{player has}} access to a {{flowchart}} {{that allows them to}} immediately revisit or [...] "jump" [...] to any previously completed Novel or Escape section without replaying the game from the <b>beginning.</b> <b>This</b> allows the player to transition to an earlier branching point in the story and choose a different option that causes the story to progress in another direction. For example, the player can jump to a previous decision and ally with their opponent instead of betraying them, and vice versa. While there are 24 endings available, many endings are inaccessible initially and must be unlocked by experiencing events or learning information in other plotlines. For example, if a particular plotline cannot progress because a required password is unknown, the player must jump to another plotline and learn the password there before returning to the original one.|$|E
