25|$|Belgium {{switched}} from the <b>Belgian</b> <b>franc</b> to the Euro as its currency after 1 January 2002. Belgian per capita GDP {{ranks among the}} world's highest. In 2008, the per capita income (PPP) was $37,500. The federal government has managed to present balanced budgets in recent years, but public debt remains high, at 99% of 2009 GDP.

The company reported losses of over 4 billion <b>Belgian</b> <b>francs</b> (BF) in 1986, and over 500million loss in 1987. In 1988 {{the company was}} still in very poor financial condition; {{in the first half}} of 1988 it lost 570million BF on revenues of nearly 4billion <b>Belgian</b> <b>francs.</b> The main shareholders of ACEC's owner SGB (Suez group and Carlo De Benedetti) announced that the company was to be sold.|$|R

25|$|The {{conquest of}} most of western Europe by Revolutionary and Napoleonic France led to the franc's wide circulation. Following {{independence}} from the Kingdom of the Netherlands, the new Kingdom of Belgium in 1832 adopted its own <b>Belgian</b> <b>franc,</b> equivalent to the French one, followed by Luxembourg adopting the Luxembourgish franc in 1848 and Switzerland in 1850. Newly unified Italy adopted the lira on a similar basis in 1862.|$|E
25|$|The {{conquest of}} most of western Europe by Revolutionary and Napoleonic France led to the French franc's wide circulation, {{including}} in Luxembourg. However, incorporation into the Netherlands in 1815 resulted in the Dutch guilder becoming Luxembourg's currency. Following Belgium's independence from the Netherlands, the <b>Belgian</b> <b>franc</b> was adopted in 1839 and circulated in Luxembourg until 1842 and again from 1848. Between 1842 and 1848, Luxembourg (as part of the German Zollverein) used the Prussian Thaler.|$|E
25|$|In May 1940, the franc was pegged to the German Reichsmark {{at a rate}} of 4 francs = 1 Reichsmark. This {{was changed}} to 10 francs = 1 Reichsmark in July 1940. On 26 August 1940, the Reichsmark was {{declared}} legal tender in Luxembourg and on 20 January 1941, the Reichsmark was declared the only legal tender and the franc was abolished. The Luxembourg franc was reestablished in 1944, once more tied to the <b>Belgian</b> <b>franc</b> at par.|$|E

25|$|Between 1944 and 2002, 1 Luxembourg franc {{was equal}} to 1 <b>Belgian</b> <b>franc.</b> Belgian francs were legal tender inside Luxembourg and Luxembourg francs were legal tender in Belgium. Nevertheless, {{payments}} in Luxembourg banknotes were commonly refused by shopkeepers in Belgium, either through ignorance or from fear that their other customers would refuse the banknotes (again, either through ignorance or from {{fear of being}} denied payment with it later), forcing them {{to go through the}} hassle of a trip to their bank to redeem the value of the banknote.|$|E
25|$|Against this grim backdrop, in 1982, Prime Minister Martens' center-right {{coalition}} government formulated {{an economic recovery}} program to promote export-led growth by enhancing the competitiveness of Belgium's export industries through an 8.5% devaluation. Economic growth rose from 2% in 1984 to a peak of 4% in 1989. In May 1990, the government linked the <b>Belgian</b> <b>franc</b> to the Deutsche Mark, primarily through closely tracking German interest rates. Consequently, as German interest rates rose after 1990, Belgian rates have increased and contributed {{to a decline in}} the economic growth rate. In 1992–93, the Belgian economy suffered the worst recession since World War II, with the real GDP declining 1.7% in 1993.|$|E
25|$|By {{the end of}} the 1980s, Belgian {{macroeconomic}} policies had resulted in a cumulative government debt of about 120% of GDP. , the budget was balanced and public debt was equal to 90.30% of GDP. In 2005 and 2006, real GDP growth rates of 1.5% and 3.0%, respectively, were slightly above the average for the Euro area. Unemployment rates of 8.4% in 2005 and 8.2% in 2006 were close to the area average. By , this had grown to 8.5% compared to an average rate of 9.6% for the European Union as a whole (EU 27). From 1832 until 2002, Belgium's currency was the <b>Belgian</b> <b>franc.</b> Belgium switched to the euro in 2002, with the first sets of euro coins being minted in 1999. The standard Belgian euro coins designated for circulation show the portrait of the monarch (first King AlbertII, since 2013 King Philippe).|$|E
50|$|In 1992 Jan De Clerck's eleven-year-old son, Anthony De Clerck, {{was kidnapped}} by {{the gang of}} Danny Vanhamel. A ransom of 250 million <b>Belgian</b> <b>francs</b> was demanded, but after a month Anthony was freed and the kidnappers arrested.|$|R
50|$|In 1998, after {{takeover}} by Bombardier, {{the company}} obtained an order {{with a total}} value of 22.2 billion <b>Belgian</b> <b>francs</b> to produce 78 Bombardier Voyager class trains for the railways in the United Kingdom at the Bruges and Manage plants; BN's value share of the contract was estimated at 8 to 10 billion <b>Belgian</b> <b>francs.</b> Deliveries {{took place in the}} early 2000s. Also as part of Bombardier, the company also produced Flexity Outlook and Flexity Swift vehicles for Brussels and Rotterdam respectively, the bodyshells of the Autorail à grande capacité for the SNCF, and B09 vehicles for the Docklands Light Railway. Finally, the company continues to supply the Belgian Railways (NMBS/SNCB) with passenger rail vehicles.|$|R
2500|$|Belgium [...] In 1982 an Esperanto {{postage stamp}} {{with a face}} value of 12 <b>Belgian</b> <b>francs</b> was issued. Several dozen other {{countries}} have also issued stamps, especially in 1987 for the 100th anniversary of the publication by L. L. Zamenhof of Unua Libro.|$|R
25|$|The Irish {{government}} had {{to decide whether or}} not to participate in the EMS. If the EMS had included all the European Community's currencies, it would have provided stability for 75% of Ireland's external trade, but in the event Britain, which still accounted for 50% of Ireland's external trade, decided to stay out of the EMS. Despite this, on 15 December 1978 it was announced that Ireland would participate in the EMS. Countries were given the option of either a 2.25% or 6% margin of fluctuation within the EMS' Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM), and Ireland took the narrower margin. The EMS started on 13 March 1979, and towards the end of the month Sterling started to gain in value against the EMS currencies because of rising oil prices, and by 30 March Sterling breached the upper fluctuation band limit of the <b>Belgian</b> <b>franc</b> and the Irish currency could no longer track Sterling. After over 50 years, the parity of the Irish and British currencies was broken, and the Irish currency became known as the Irish pound (or Punt).|$|E
500|$|The German {{government}} levied {{the costs}} of the military occupation on the Belgians through taxes, while also demanding [...] "external occupation costs" [...] (or [...] "Anti-Bolshevik charges") to support operations elsewhere. In total, Belgium was forced to pay nearly two-thirds of its national income for these charges, equalling 5.7 billion Reichsmarks {{over the course of the}} occupation. The value of the <b>Belgian</b> <b>franc</b> was artificially suppressed, further increasing the size of the Anti-Bolshevik charge and benefitting German companies exporting to the occupied country.|$|E
500|$|At {{the start}} of the war, the Belgian {{government}} hurriedly removed silver coins from circulation and replace them with banknotes. With the German occupation, these banknotes remained legal and their production continued. To offset the costs of occupation, the German administration demanded regular [...] "war contributions" [...] of 35 million Belgian francs each month. The contribution considerably exceeded Belgium's pre-war tax income and so, in order to pay it, Belgian banks used new paper money to buy bonds. The excessive printing of money, coupled with large amounts of German money brought into the country by soldiers, led to considerable inflation. The Germans also artificially fixed the exchange rate between the German mark and the <b>Belgian</b> <b>franc</b> to benefit their own economy at a ratio of 1:1.25. To cope with the economic conditions, large numbers of individual communes and regions began to print and issue their own money, known as Necessity Money (monnaie de nécessité), which could be used locally.|$|E
50|$|Each {{show had}} three {{candidates}} and four thematical rounds. One candidate {{remained in the}} finale and had to answer one very detailed question correctly. The prize was 100.000 <b>Belgian</b> <b>francs,</b> {{though most of the}} time the winner just received a kitchen device.|$|R

2500|$|In 1854, Luxembourg began issuing its own franc, at {{par with}} the <b>Belgian</b> <b>franc.</b> The Luxembourg franc {{followed}} the <b>Belgian</b> <b>franc</b> into the Latin Monetary Union in 1865. In 1926, Belgium withdrew from the Latin Monetary Union. However, the 1921 monetary union of Belgium and Luxembourg survived, forming {{the basis for the}} full Belgium-Luxembourg Economic Union in 1932. In 1935, the link between the Luxembourg and Belgian francs was revised, with 1 Luxembourg franc = [...] Belgian francs.|$|E
2500|$|... 1 Luxembourgish franc {{was equal}} to 1 <b>Belgian</b> <b>franc.</b> Belgian francs were legal tender inside Luxembourg, and Luxembourgish francs were legal tender {{in the whole}} of Belgium.

2500|$|One franc is {{typically}} divided into 100 centimes. The French franc symbol was an F {{with a line}} through it (₣) or, more frequently, only an F. For practical reasons, the banks and the financial markets used the abbreviation FF for the French franc in order to distinguish it from the <b>Belgian</b> <b>franc</b> (FB), the Luxembourgish franc (FL or FLux) etcetera (In the Luxembourgish language, the word for franc is Frang, plural form Frangen.) ...|$|E
