The ointment base composition determines not only the extent of penetration but also controls the transfer of medicaments from the base to the body tissues.

40|$|The crude rice <b>bran</b> <b>wax</b> was {{obtained}} from M/S Bajaj rice mills, Gondia (MS) which was dark brown in color & contains nonwaxy impurities & fixed oil. After purification around 38 gm wax obtained which was almost white, light in weight and non-sticky. No instances of skin irritation or sensitization symptoms such as edema / rending of the skin were observed on the skin of Albino rabbits even after 24 hrs. Therefore wax was nontoxic & safe to use in pharmaceutical preparations. In the present study the melting range of rice <b>bran</b> <b>wax</b> {{was found to be}} 78 – 840 which is higher, may reduce the diffusion of drug across the layers of skin. Therefore, in the present study efforts will be made later on to reduce the melting range by addition of low melting point fats like mango kernel fat (M. P. 34. 7 oC). Solubility studies reveal that the wax is soluble in organic solvents like chloroform & petroleum ether showing typical solubility properties of waxes. Refractive index of a compound gives an idea of purity of the compound & the refractive index of the test sample was found to be 1. 44 at 70 oc. Sap value of rice <b>bran</b> <b>wax</b> is 68 – 72. The acid value of rice <b>bran</b> <b>wax</b> is 12 – 14. The iodine value of rice <b>bran</b> <b>wax</b> is 9 – 11. From the above data the physicochemical properties of rice <b>bran</b> <b>wax</b> was found to be within the range of other waxes used in topical preparations. Therefore rice <b>bran</b> <b>wax</b> may be utilized as a base in topical preparations. Different topical formulations such as ointments (oleaginous, modified hydrophilic ointment and modified bellers ointment base) were formulated with purified rice <b>bran</b> <b>wax</b> and compared with simple ointment (control) and marketed formulation. All these formulations contain 2 % diclofenac sodium. All the formulations were evaluated for p H rheological studies like apparent viscosity, spread ability and diclofenac sodium content. P H of all formulations was found to be 5. 98 – 7. 30, thus indicating the suitability for application on the skin. Diclofenac sodium content of all the formulations was found to be above 95 % indicating the suitability of the method adopted for preparing the formulations. Shelf life and release of diclofenac sodium content in vivo study will be made further...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to develop a {{pharmaceutical}} formulation containing fatty acid extract rich in free omega- 3 fatty acids such as eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid for topical use. Although the health benefits of cod liver oil and other fish oils taken orally as a dietary supplement have been acknowledged and exploited, it is clear that their use can be extended further to cover their antibacterial properties. In vitro evaluation showed that 20 % (v/v) fatty acid extract exhibits good activity against strains of the Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptoccoccus pyogenes and Streptoccoccus pneumonia. Therefore, free polyunsaturated fatty acids from cod liver oil or other fish oils can be used as safe and natural antibacterial agents. In this study, ointment compositions containing free fatty acids as active antibacterial agents were prepared by using various natural waxes and characterized. The effects of different waxes, such as carnauba wax, ozokerite wax, laurel wax, beeswax, rice <b>bran</b> <b>wax,</b> candelilla wax and microcrystalline wax, in the concentration range of 1 % to 5 % (w/w) on the ointment texture, consistency and stability were evaluated. The results showed significant variations in texture, sensory and rheological profiles. This was attributed to the wax’s nature and chain composition. Microcrystalline wax gave the best results but laurel wax, beeswax and rice <b>bran</b> <b>wax</b> exhibited excellent texturing, similar sensory profiles and well-balanced rheological properties.

40|$|Themain {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the effect of combining a high-melting wax (sunflower wax or rice <b>bran</b> <b>wax)</b> with a low-melting wax (berrywax or BEW) on the crystallization and gelation behavior of the corresponding wax-based oleogels in rice bran oil (RBO). Sunflower wax (SW) and rice <b>bran</b> <b>wax</b> (RBW) have a similar chemical composition but a very different crystallization behavior. Therefore, SWand RBW were also combined in a wax-based oleogel to examine the occurrence of co-crystallization and/or crystal coexistence. The thermal and gelation behavior of the binary blends in rice bran oil (5 % w/w total concentration of wax) were investigated with differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and rheological measurements, showing sequential crystallization and gelation for the SW/RBW : BEW wax-based oleogels and simultaneous crystallization and gelation for the SW : RBW wax-based oleogels. Oscillatory shear and hardness measurements revealed the reinforcement of the high-melting wax crystal network with the addition of the low-melting berry wax. X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements in both the long-spacing and the short-spacing region showed the occurrence of crystal co-existence, rather than co-crystallization, which was confirmed with polarized light microscopy (PLM). Two different crystal morphologies could be discerned for all three combinations (RBW : SW, SW : BEW and RBW : BEW). We hypothesized that the improved rheological properties could be attributed to sintering, a process in which the low-melting BEW crystals form solid bonds between the crystals of the high-melting waxes. As such, a cohesive network is formed, resulting in an increased hardness of the bi-wax-based oleogels. This research provides the opportunity to minimize the amount of wax necessary in creating semi-solid materials with a wide variety in rheological and textural properties. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{encapsulate}} ethylhexyl methoxycinnamate (EMC), a commonly used UVB filter, in a solid lipid matrix in order to obtain microparticles and then nanoparticles to reduce its photo-instability under UV light exposure. Glyceryl behenate, rice <b>bran</b> <b>wax</b> and ozokerite were investigated for encapsulating EMC. The suspensions of nanoparticles contained 70 % encapsulated EMC (relative to the lipid mass). The absorbance level at 310 [*]nm of suspensions containing nanoparticles was more than twice that of those containing microparticles. So, decreasing the size of particles improved the efficiency of light protection, regardless of the lipid material used. Moreover, free EMC presented a 30 % loss of its efficiency after 2 [*]h of irradiation, whereas the three NLC formulations showed a loss of absorbency between 10 % and 21 %. The in vitro cutaneous penetration test did not show a higher potential penetration for EMC contained in nanosuspensions compared to free EMC.

40|$|This {{work is a}} {{step towards}} the {{solution}} of both environmental safety and energy crisis. Tremendous use of plastic wares also leads to produce huge amount of plastics wastes. It is also pretty known that,plastics are non-biodegradable and possibly release toxic and greenhouse gases during incineration. Therefore,the investigation was the production and characterization of the oil obtained from co-pyrolysis of waste polypropylene and rice <b>bran</b> <b>wax.</b> The co-pyrolysis experiments were conducted in a semi-batch reactor within a temperature range of 400 ? to 650 ? which was obtained by Thermogravimetric analysis. The optimum pyrolytic oil at 550 ? i. e. 1 : 3 ratio(PP: RBW) has liquid yield of 80. 5 %,calorific value of 43. 73 MJ/Kg. From physical characterization of oil, 800. 8 kg/m 3 density, 40. 75 ? flash point and 43 ?fire point,shows a very close resemblance to diesel. The chemical composition of PP,RBW and 1 : 3 ratio analyzed by FTIR,GC-MS and NMR spectroscopy shows that the composition of all the three oils mainly contains aliphatic compounds and small amounts of oxygenated compounds. By determining the physical and chemical characterization,it can be stated that 1 : 3 ratio {{is a mixture of}} diesel and gasoline. After proper treatment and refining,the pyrolytic oil {{can be used as a}} substitute of fossil fuel. The solid residue of 1 : 3 ratio obtained after pyrolysis was characterized for its calorific value,SEM and BET analysis.
