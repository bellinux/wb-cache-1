5000|$|In 1981 Gibson {{realized}} that there was a consumer demand for the sound of original PAF pickups. Engineer Tim Shaw designed a pickup that aimed to replicate the early design, reversing changes made in the 1960s and 1970s: a new bobbin without the [...] "T", a correct small square hole back in both <b>bobbins,</b> enamel <b>wire,</b> and thicker Alnico magnets. Shaw's efforts are generally considered to be the first of many recreations of the PAF humbucking pickup.|$|R

In 2011, this took {{a new direction}} following her personal exhibition at the Freud Museum in London, where she worked on Anna Freud's loom and initiated geometrical works of lines and grids. This is also when Anderson began to use copper-coloured wire in her studio. ‘I took objects apart {{and put them back}} together again, and during one of these dismantling sessions I came across an alarm clock with a <b>bobbin</b> of copper <b>wire</b> inside it’.|$|R
40|$|High field common coil magnets [1, 2] using brittle High Temperature Superconductors (HTS) or Nb{sub 3 }Sn cables {{provide new}} {{challenges}} {{with respect to}} the design and manufacturing of coils. We are developing the scaleable techniques {{that can be used in}} the production of common coil or other magnets with similar designs [3, 4]. By utilizing a cost-effective rapid turnaround short coil program, it is possible to quickly develop and test the new conductors and learn the design and manufacturing concepts needed for them. The flexible nature of a rapid turnaround program required the development of a standard coil cassette for different size cable, allowing coils to be used as building blocks for testing in different magnet configurations. Careful attention is given to the design of the coil structure: The inner <b>bobbin</b> the <b>wire</b> is wound on, the coil winding process, insulation integrity, epoxy vacuum impregnation, and final assembly into a test magnet. This paper will discuss the manufacturing techniques and design rules learned from the rapid turnaround program, and test results to date...|$|R
2500|$|The P-90 (sometimes written P90) is {{a single}} coil {{electric}} guitar pickup produced by Gibson since 1946. Gibson is still producing P-90s, and there are outside companies that manufacture replacement versions. [...] Compared to other single coil designs, such as the ubiquitous Fender single coil, the bobbin for a P-90 is wider but shorter. [...] The Fender style single coil is wound in a taller <b>bobbin</b> but the <b>wires</b> are closer to the individual poles. [...] This makes the P-90 produce {{a different type of}} tone, somewhat warmer with less edge and brightness. [...] The P-90 is still subject to 60 cycle hum unless some form of hum cancelling is used.|$|R
5000|$|An {{inductor}} usually {{consists of}} a coil of conducting material, typically insulated copper wire, wrapped around a core either of plastic or of a ferromagnetic (or ferrimagnetic) material; the latter is called an [...] "iron core" [...] inductor. Since power inductors require high induction levels, high permeability and low saturation points in the core materials are not ideal. The high permeability of the ferromagnetic core increases the magnetic field and confines it closely to the inductor, thereby increasing the inductance. Low frequency inductors are constructed like transformers, with cores of electrical steel laminated to prevent eddy currents. 'Soft' ferrites are widely used for cores above audio frequencies, since they do not cause the large energy losses at high frequencies that ordinary iron alloys do. Inductors come in many shapes. Most are constructed as enamel coated wire (magnet wire) wrapped around a ferrite <b>bobbin</b> with <b>wire</b> exposed on the outside, while some enclose the wire completely in ferrite and {{are referred to as}} [...] "shielded". Some inductors have an adjustable core, which enables changing of the inductance. Inductors used to block very high frequencies are sometimes made by stringing a ferrite bead on a wire.|$|R
25|$|This {{primitive}} telephone {{was rapidly}} improved. The double electromagnet {{was replaced by}} a single permanently magnetized bar magnet having a small coil or <b>bobbin</b> of fine <b>wire</b> surrounding one pole, in front of which a thin disc of iron was fixed in a circular mouthpiece. The disc served as a combined diaphragm and armature. On speaking into the mouthpiece, the iron diaphragm vibrated with the voice in the magnetic field of the bar-magnet pole, and thereby caused undulatory currents in the coil. These currents, after traveling through the wire to the distant receiver, were received in an identical apparatus. This design was patented by Bell on January 30, 1877. The sounds were weak and could only be heard when the ear was close to the earphone/mouthpiece, but they were distinct.|$|R
50|$|See drawing at right. The Marconi version {{consisted}} of an endless iron band (B) built up of 70 strands of number 40 gage silk-covered iron wire. In operation, the band passes over two grooved pulleys rotated by a wind-up clockwork motor. The iron band {{passes through the}} center of a glass tube which is close wound with a single layer along several millimeters with number 36 gage silk-covered copper wire. This coil (C) functions as the radio frequency excitation coil. Over this winding is a small <b>bobbin</b> wound with <b>wire</b> of the same gauge to a resistance of about 140 ohms. This coil (D) functions as the audio pickup coil. Around these coils two permanent horseshoe magnets are arranged to magnetize the iron band as it passes through the glass tube.|$|R

50|$|After Faradays {{discovery}} that electric currents {{could be developed}} in a wire by causing it to cut across the lines of force of a magnet, {{it was to be}} expected that attempts would be made to construct machines to avail of this fact in the development of voltaic currents. The first machine of this kind was due to Hippolyte Pixii, 1832. It consisted of two <b>bobbins</b> of iron <b>wire,</b> opposite which the poles of a horseshoe magnet were caused to rotate. As this produced in the coils of the wire an alternating current, Pixii arranged a commutating device (commutator) that converted the alternating current of the coils or armature into a direct current in the external circuit. This machine was followed by improved forms of magneto-electric machines due to Ritchie, Saxton, Clarke 1834, Stohrer 1843, Nollet 1849, Shepperd 1856, Van Maldern, Siemens, Wilde and others.|$|R
5000|$|Cryostats used in MRI {{machines}} {{are designed to}} hold a cryogen, typically helium, in a liquid state with minimal evaporation (boil-off). The liquid helium bath is designed to keep the superconducting magnet's <b>bobbin</b> of superconductive <b>wire</b> in its superconductive state. In this state the wire has no electrical resistance and very large currents are maintained with a low power input. To maintain superconductivity, the bobbin must be kept below its transition temperature by being immersed in the liquid helium. If, for any reason, the wire becomes resistive, i.e. loses superconductivity, a condition known as a [...] "quench", the liquid helium evaporates, instantly raising pressure within the vessel. A burst disk, usually made of carbon, is placed within the chimney or vent pipe so that during a pressure excursion, the gaseous helium can be safely vented out of the MRI suite. Modern MRI cryostats use a mechanical refrigerator (cryocooler) to re-condense the helium gas {{and return it to}} the bath, to maintain cryogenic conditions and to conserve helium.|$|R
50|$|During 1837-38 Professor Page of Massachusetts had {{discovered}} that a needle or thin bar of iron, placed {{in the hollow of}} a coil or <b>bobbin</b> of insulated <b>wire,</b> would emit an audible 'tick' at each interruption of a current, flowing in the coil, and if these separate ticks followed each other fast enough, by a rapid interruption of the current, they would run together into a continuous hum, to which he gave the name galvanic music. He also found that the pitch of this note corresponded to the rate of the current's interruption. These faint sounds were due to magnetostriction. From these and other discoveries by Noad, Wertheim, Marrian, and others, Reis knew that if the current which had been interrupted by his vibrating diaphragm were conveyed to a distance by wires and then passed through a coil like that of Page's, the iron needle would emit notes like those which had caused the oscillation of the transmitting diaphragm. Acting on this knowledge, he constructed his rudimentary telephone. Reis' prototype is now in the museum of the Reichs Post-Amt, Berlin.|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{prominent}} applications of superconductivity is high field magnet. Mechanical disturbance such as abrupt conductor motion {{is one of the main}} origin of premature quench (transition from superconducting state to the normal resistive state) in high current density superconducting coils. The wire motion occurs when electromagnetic force to conductor exceeds constrain force including frictional force on the surface of conductor. Behavior of superconducting wire motion depends on the electromagnetic force acting on it, frictional property of the insulating material and thrust force applied to the superconducting wire. 　　　The experiments for superconducting wire motion in magnetic field was carried out using small coil wound on stainless steel (SUS) bobbin using Polyimide film as an insulating material and high strength polyethylene fiber (Dyneema: DF) reinforced plastic (DFRP) bobbin [1]. The Dyneema fiber has negative thermal expansion [2] and low coefficient of friction [3]. It was found that voltage spikes generated due to sudden wire motion in case of DFRP bobbin are a few and small in amplitude. The speculations are; the negative thermal expansion of the DFRP <b>bobbin</b> restrains the <b>wire</b> motion and low coefficient of friction between superconducting <b>wire</b> and DFRP <b>bobbin</b> reduces sudden motion. 　　　In order to study the effect of frictional coefficient of insulating material on superconducting wire motion under the influence of electromagnetic force, a special experimental setup was designed and fabricated. The main distinctiveness of the experimental setup is that the tension of the superconducting wire can be changed during the experiments. The experimental set up consists of a cryostat, superconducting solenoid magnet, sample holder, tensional unit to apply tension to the superconducting wire, power supplies and pen recorder or a 16 -bit data recorder to measure the voltage tap signal. The sample holder consists of two parts, a semi- circular head and a body part. Experiments were conducted at 4. 2 K by varying the experimental conditions such as the tension to the superconducting wire, superconducting wire current ramp rate and different insulating materials at the interface of the superconducting wire and semi-circular head. 　　　Voltage taps to measure the signal generated due to the superconducting wire motion are connected at the end of the semi-circular head. To reduce the voltage tap loop area, a groove was incorporated in the semi-circular head and the voltage tap wire was passed through it. The voltage tap signal is measured by a pen recorder or a 16 -bit data recorder with a sampling rate of 1 MS/s. Sudden wire motion was indicated by observing the voltage spikes. 　　　In order to examine the effect of the current ramp rate on the superconducting wire motion, ramp rate was changed from 0. 4 A/s to 1. 69 A/s. The superconducting wire tension was varied from 7. 1 N to 35. 8 N to study the effect of tension on the superconducting wire motion. During all experiments, a constant magnetic field of 6 T was applied by superconducting solenoid magnet. 　　　In the thesis work, different types of insulating material were used to study superconducting wire motion under electromagnetic force. They are Polyimide film, cloth / sheet material fabricated using Dyneema fiber, Zylon fiber and Teflon. The Dyneema / Zylon fiber has negative thermal expansion and a low coefficient of friction. 　　　We have verified the effectiveness of this system. We could measure the pattern of voltage spikes. The time duration of voltage spikes are of the same order for all the samples. The peak voltage tap signal amplitude, velocity of wire motion, distance moved by wire and energy dissipated due to wire motion in case of Polyimide film is more than 2 order of magnitude larger than Dyneema based insulating materials and Zylon cloth. Hence use of Dyneema / Zylon based materials as an interface material between layers of superconducting wire may reduce the frictional heat generated due to wire motion and could make superconducting magnet performance more reliable...|$|R
