40|$|Abstract: Metallic {{particle}} {{contamination in}} a compressed Gas Insulated Busduct (GIB) system may substantially lower the corona onset and breakdown voltages of the system. The random movement of metallic particles in a GIB system plays {{a crucial role}} in determining the insulation performance of the system. In this study a statistical approach has been used to evaluate the probability of SF 6 insulation breakdown due to the presence of contaminating metallic particles. Under 50 -Hz AC voltage, the particle motion is complex, and under appropriate conditions, the particle may cross the gaseous gap from the low-field region near the outer enclosure to the high-field region near the central conductor. For the commonly encountered size of metallic particles in practical Gas Insulated systems, such a crossing of the gaseous gap takes several cycles of the 50 -Hz voltage. In order to determine the particle trajectories in a three-phase common enclosure Gas Insulated <b>Bus</b> <b>duct</b> (GIB) an outer enclosure of diameter 500 mm and inner conductors of diameters 64 mm spaced equilaterally are considered.

In order to improve the insulation performance of the solid insulators, two technical points should be considered, the first is the improvement of the insulation performance and the second is the control of the electric field distribution in and around the solid insulating spacers.
