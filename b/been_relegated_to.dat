5|$|The list {{includes}} clubs that are current {{members of the}} Premier League, who lost their Football League status upon promotion, and those which lost their status by other means.

5|$|Arsenal {{were the}} reigning champions of England having won the Football League First Division title in 1990–91. The team had only lost one match in their {{successful}} league campaign, to Chelsea in February 1991. Arsenal's opponents Wrexham had finished {{bottom of the}} entire Football League the previous season. In normal circumstances this meant the club would have <b>been</b> <b>relegated</b> <b>to</b> the Football Conference, but the Football League's plan to expand its competition {{in time for the}} 1991–92 season meant there was to be no demotion.|$|E
5|$|Giovanni Bausan {{frequently}} served abroad. She {{participated in}} the conquest of Eritrea in 188788 as the flagship of the Italian squadron during the campaign. She {{took part in the}} Venezuelan crisis of 1902–03 alongside British and German warships. During the Italo-Turkish War of 191112, she provided gunfire support to Italian troops ashore in North Africa. By the outbreak of the First World War, Giovanni Bausan had <b>been</b> <b>relegated</b> <b>to</b> secondary duties, first as a distilling ship, and later as a depot ship for seaplanes. The ship was disarmed during the conflict and ultimately was sold to ship-breakers in March 1920.|$|E

5|$|In {{many modern}} Islamist movements, women have <b>been</b> <b>relegated</b> <b>to</b> a {{domestic}} role. Tablighi Jamaat tends {{to blur the}} boundaries of gender roles and both genders share a common behavioural model and their commitment to tabligh. The emphasis is on a common nature and responsibilities shared by both genders. Just as men redraw the gender roles when they wash and cook {{during the course of}} da'wa tours, women undertake the male responsibility of sustaining the household. Women do not play any role in the higher echelons of the movement, but their opinions are taken into due considerations.|$|E
5|$|Tatuidris tatusia is {{the only}} species in Tatuidris, a {{monotypic}} genus and {{one of only two}} extant genera in the subfamily Agroecomyrmecinae. A new species, T. kapasi, was described by Lacau & Groc in 2012, but has now <b>been</b> <b>relegated</b> <b>to</b> a junior synonym under T. tatusia based on the extent of the morphological variability encountered throughout this broad geographic range. Analysis of DNA barcodes indicated a pattern of genetic isolation by distance, suggesting the presence of a single species undergoing allopatric differentiation.|$|E
5|$|The 1947–48 season brought Max Bentley to Toronto from Chicago in {{what has}} been called the biggest trade in NHL history as the Leafs gave up five regular players for the league's scoring leader. Evincing the depth of the team at centre, Bentley played on the team's third line, behind Apps and Kennedy. Decades later, Hap Day argued that this team was the strongest NHL team ever and Globe and Mail {{reporter}} Dick Beddoes also stirred up controversy by saying Wayne Gretzky would have <b>been</b> <b>relegated</b> <b>to</b> the fourth line on this Leaf team.|$|E

5|$|Two {{drawings}} {{on paper}} in the British Museum and the École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts were at times thought to be studies for the Munich Nativity. The lines of the folds in the garments closely match those of the painting, although the technical ability does not. The Paris drawing has blotches of paint indicating {{that it was a}} study piece for workshop members. The London piece is superior, but its lines are more rigid, lacking Lochner's fluidity, and so its attribution has <b>been</b> <b>relegated</b> <b>to</b> a draughtsman closely associated with Lochner.|$|E
5|$|After {{the line}} had <b>been</b> <b>relegated</b> <b>to</b> a branch line, traffic fell considerably. Another factor was car traffic, {{which did not}} exist in Flekkefjord until 1918, but {{thereafter}} became widespread. After the war, Class 20 steam locomotives were used on the line. During the 1940, several railcars of Class 87 were taken into use, and soon all passenger trains were operated using such units. From 1956 to 1966, also Class 86 units were used on the line, but the narrow profile of the tunnels made operations problematic. Class 87 remained in service until 1981, when used Class 89 units were bought from Sweden. At first, two Y7 units were brought to Norway on 23 January and taken into service on 24 February. After they proved to work well, NSB bought them for 95,000 Swedish kronor plus freight. Two more units were bought in 1986.|$|E
5|$|An {{alternative}} approach was {{the development of}} the ADS or armoured suit, which isolates the diver from the pressure at depth, at the cost of mechanical complexity and limited dexterity. The technology first became practicable in the middle 20th century. Isolation of the diver from the environment was taken further by the development of remotely operated underwater vehicles in the late 20th century, where the operator controls the ROV from the surface, and autonomous underwater vehicles, which dispense with an operator altogether. All of these modes are still in use and each has a range of applications where it has advantages over the others, though diving bells have largely <b>been</b> <b>relegated</b> <b>to</b> a means of transport for surface supplied divers. In some cases combinations are particularly effective, such as the simultaneous use of surface orientated or saturation surface supplied diving equipment and work or observation class remotely operated vehicles.|$|E

5|$|Attempts {{were now}} made {{to find a}} role for the {{remaining}} 19 locomotives. By now many had <b>been</b> <b>relegated</b> <b>to</b> hauling trains in what were once seen as remote outposts of the LMS. Often they were reduced to pulling stopping trains, empty stock trains, or even goods trains. Only one realistic mainline role was contemplated: to replace the Scottish Region A4 Class on the testing route between Edinburgh Waverley and Aberdeen. This idea was discarded largely {{because it would be}} excessively problematic to train the A4 crews to operate the Coronations. With no credible role, only one option remained: in July 1964 it was resolved that the remaining 19 locomotives were to be withdrawn from 12 September.|$|E
5|$|Beyond French fries, {{the company}} has {{introduced}} several other side products {{over the course of}} its existence. Onion rings {{have been part of the}} menu for the majority of BK history. Originally made from whole, sliced onions, they were reformulated into a formed product made from onion paste in 2001 as part of a menu revamp. In the same 2001 menu revamp, the company added an onion ring-specific dipping sauce, and emphasized it again during its 99¢ BK Value Menu introduction in 2002. As part of its BK Cravers value menu introduction in 2005, the company briefly sold jalapeño poppers accompanied by a side of ranch dressing as part of its national menu. The same menu added mozzarella sticks with a side of marinara sauce; the mozzarella sticks have since <b>been</b> <b>relegated</b> <b>to</b> a regional menu item in the United States, but are sold on the national menu in Canada.|$|E
5|$|Cardiff {{qualified}} for 1927 FA Charity Shield, where they defeated amateur team Corinthian by two goals to {{one with the}} winning goal once again by Ferguson. Their fortunes subsequently declined occurred quickly afterwards. Within four years, they had <b>been</b> <b>relegated</b> <b>to</b> the Football League Third Division South. Keenor remained captain during this period, and left the club after 19 years to transfer to Crewe Alexandra F.C. during the 1930–31 football season. In 1934, Cardiff slipped further and were required to petition the Football Association {{to allow them to}} remain in the league after they finished last and were eligible to be removed from the competition. Cardiff's Ernie Curtis, who died in November 1992 at the age of 85, was the last surviving player from the final. He had been the youngest player in the match, aged 19 years and 317 days. Cardiff reached the FA Cup Final once more in 2008 FA Cup Final; where they lost by one goal to nil against Portsmouth.|$|E
50|$|The two losers of the playout <b>are</b> <b>relegated</b> <b>to</b> Eccellenza, {{while the}} two winners remain in Serie D. In total, 36 teams <b>are</b> <b>relegated</b> <b>to</b> Eccellenza.|$|R

5|$|Giovanni Bausan {{frequently}} served abroad. She {{participated in}} the conquest of Eritrea in 1887–1888 as the flagship of the Italian squadron during the campaign. She {{took part in the}} Venezuelan crisis of 1902–1903 alongside several other Italian, British, and German warships. The ship was withdrawn from front-line service by 1905 and was employed as a training ship. During the Italo-Turkish War of 1911–1912, she provided gunfire support to Italian troops ashore in North Africa. By the outbreak of World War I, Giovanni Bausan had <b>been</b> <b>relegated</b> <b>to</b> secondary duties, first as a distilling ship, and later as a depot ship for seaplanes.

5|$|Hull's first {{play-off}} campaign ended unsuccessfully, {{being beaten}} by Leyton Orient in the semi-final in the 2000–01 season. However, successive promotions in the 2003–04 and 2004–05 seasons saw Hull {{rise from the}} fourth tier to the second tier in a space of two years. After 104 years of existence, Hull were promoted to the Premier League {{for the first time}} in their history, beating Watford in the play-off semi-finals and Bristol City in the 2008 Football League Championship play-off Final. Hull's first Premier League season saw safety from relegation ensured on the last day of the season, although the club was relegated the following season after finishing 19th in the league. Three years later, Hull returned to the Premier League after finishing the 2012–13 season as Championship runners-up. In the 2013–14 season they achieved their highest ever league finish of 16th and were runners-up to Arsenal in their first ever FA Cup Final appearance. Since then, they have <b>been</b> <b>relegated</b> <b>to</b> the Championship and promoted again.|$|E
5|$|In 1952, McNicoll was {{appointed}} {{chairman of the}} planning committee for the British nuclear tests on the Montebello Islands, {{off the coast of}} Western Australia. Later that year, he was made commanding officer of the heavy cruiser , a post he held for the next two years. As commander of Australia, McNicoll also served as Chief Staff Officer to the Flag Officer Commanding HM Australian Fleet. HMAS Australia was near the end of its naval service and had <b>been</b> <b>relegated</b> <b>to</b> training duties from 1950. As such, the cruiser was primarily consigned to Australian waters, though a brief trip to New Zealand did occur in October 1953. McNicoll {{was appointed}} a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 1954 New Year Honours List for his involvement in the British atomic program; he was presented with the decoration three months later by Queen Elizabeth II in a ceremony at Government House, Melbourne.|$|E

5|$|In August 2009, he was loaned {{out to the}} First Division side Hønefoss {{until the}} end of the season, with an option to buy. In his first match for Hønefoss, Tegström scored a goal against Alta; the game ended with a 2–0 victory. He scored a four goals in 12 matches for Hønefoss. After the season, he {{returned}} to Fredrikstad, which had <b>been</b> <b>relegated</b> <b>to</b> the First Division. He was troubled by injuries in his last season with Fredrikstad, and he started only nine matches. Jönköpings Södra wanted to buy Tegström during the summer, but he did not join the club until his contract with Fredrikstad expired after the 2010 season. After playing two seasons for the Superettan side, Tegström returned to Husqvarna ahead of the 2013 season, where in addition to playing for the team, he was hired as chief of marketing.|$|E
5|$|Malmö FF {{have been}} the subject of several films. Some {{examples}} are Swedish football documentaries Blådårar1 and Blådårar2, which portray the club from both supporter and player perspectives during the 1997 and 2000 seasons. Blådårar1 is set in 1997, when the club finished third in Allsvenskan. The film focuses on devoted fan Lasse, player Anders Andersson, former chairman Hans Cavalli-Björkman and other individuals. Blådårar2 is set in 2000, the year after the club had <b>been</b> <b>relegated</b> <b>to</b> Superettan, and follows the team as they fight for Malmö FF's return to Allsvenskan. The second film continues to follow Lasse, but also has a significant focus on Zlatan Ibrahimović, his progress and how he was eventually sold to AFC Ajax during the 2001 season.|$|E
5|$|Paul {{joined a}} Manchester City side which had just <b>been</b> <b>relegated</b> <b>to</b> the Second Division, and were thus {{playing at the}} same level as Swansea. Paul made his debut for the club on the opening day of the 1950–51 season, a 4–2 victory against a Preston North End side {{featuring}} Tom Finney. Manchester City went ten matches unbeaten {{at the start of the}} season, until a 4–3 defeat at Doncaster Rovers, where City blew a 3–0 half-time lead. Paul played in all but one match that season, becoming club captain and helping his club win promotion, as runners-up behind champions Preston. Writer HD Davies, under his pen name Old International, attributed much of City's cohesive play over the season to the addition of Paul to the side.|$|E
