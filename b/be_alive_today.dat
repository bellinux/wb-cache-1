25|$|Despite {{the success}} of {{chemotherapy}} for osteosarcoma, it {{has one of the}} lowest survival rates for pediatric cancer. The best reported 10-year survival rate is 92%; the protocol used is an aggressive intra-arterial regimen that individualizes therapy based on arteriographic response. Three-year event-free survival ranges from 50% to 75%, and five-year survival ranges from 60% to 85+% in some studies. Overall, 65–70% patients treated five years ago will <b>be</b> <b>alive</b> <b>today.</b> These survival rates are overall averages and vary greatly depending on the individual necrosis rate.|$|E
500|$|Norway {{parliament}} member Inga Marte Thorkildsen {{weighed in}} on the situation, and stated to the Oslo, Norway newspaper Dagbladet, [...] "All indications are that the Scientologist sect has played a direct role in Kaja's choice to take her own life." [...] Ballo's friend and study partner Henry Møinichen told Dagbladet, [...] "I think Kaja would <b>be</b> <b>alive</b> <b>today</b> {{if she had not}} gone to the Scientologists." [...] Psychologist Rudy Myrvang told Aftenposten that testing procedures such as the personality test conducted by Scientology could have negative consequences; he said the goal was focused on [...] "breaking you down, and then they'll offer to build you up again". Myrvang characterized the Scientology personality test as a recruitment tactic for the organization. Dagbladet consulted an expert on the subject of assessment tests, Ole I. Iversen, who characterized the Scientology personality test as [...] "unethical and junk".|$|E

500|$|The fandom is {{considered}} to be charitable, raising money for a number of different efforts. The Brony Thank You Fund was originally established to create a fan-funded advertisement to air on Hub Network as a thank you to the show's creators in November 2012. The charitable drive far exceeded its goal, with additional funds used to give money to provide toys for children through Toys For Tots. The fund has since incorporated in the state of New Hampshire, and successfully registered as a non-profit 501(c)(3) organization under United States law. They claim to be the first such media-related fandom to achieve this status. In December 2013, the Fund donated $50,000 to endow an animation scholarship in perpetuity at the California Institute of the Arts. [...] Similarly, a group called [...] "Bronies for Good" [...] ran blood drives and raised over $60,000 during 2012 for charities like the Children's Cancer Association, Room to Read, CureSearch, and Your Siblings. Voice actress Tara Strong has gained help from the fandom for her [...] "Kiki's Cancer Fund" [...] to help the daughter of a close friend who had been diagnosed with a brain tumor, and has stated that the child [...] "wouldn't <b>be</b> <b>alive</b> <b>today</b> without the My Little Pony fans"; raising $100,000 to help [...] however, the girl subsequently died of her illness. Faust enlisted help from the bronies {{to raise money for the}} Wildlife Learning Center in California, with the Center offering to name some of its animals after characters in the show when certain donation levels were raised.|$|E
500|$|The moral panic was not {{confined}} {{solely to the}} gender of the murderers, but also the role played by so-called [...] "video nasties". The news media immediately made a connection between the Bulger murder trial and the Capper murder trial when the horror movie [...] was mentioned as part of the testimonies. D.I. Wall said [...] "throughout interviews with the accused there was no suggestion that the reason Suzanne was killed {{had anything to do with}} [...] "Child's Play" [...] but this was overlooked by more sensationalist headlines (Demonic doll Chucky links the horror crimes; The curse of Chucky). Neither Powell or McNeilly owned a video recorder, and the Child's Play–inspired music that had been used to torture Capper was a popular track at the time, taped direct from Manchester's Piccadilly Radio. Broadcaster David Elstein called the video connection [...] "a false story... branded into the consciousness of the media," [...] and questioned the news media's fascination with the film: [...] "There is no reason to believe that Suzanne Capper [...] would <b>be</b> <b>alive</b> <b>today</b> if the audiotape had instead contained the torture scene from King Lear, or a catchphrase from Bruce Forsyth... But the Child's Play hare has been running ever since the last day of the James Bulger murder trial." [...] Elstein argued that the film was simply a scapegoat which the press [...] "made a three-course meal out of." [...] The Guardian reported that 21,000 four–nine-year-olds watched each of BSkyB's two transmissions of Child's Play 3 – but Elstein explained the figure was [...] "simply a projection based on an average of just two actual viewers from BARB's reporting panel, and that the margin of error means even the two may have been just one. But why spoil a good running story by asking what the figures mean?" ...|$|E
2500|$|The ocean chemist Peter Brewer queries {{whether it}} is [...] "truly useful to create a list of {{environmental}} limits without serious plans for how they may be achieved [...] they may become just another stick to beat citizens with. Disruption of the global nitrogen cycle is one clear example: {{it is likely that}} a large fraction of people on Earth would not <b>be</b> <b>alive</b> <b>today</b> without the artificial production of fertilizer. How can such ethical and economic issues be matched with a simple call to set limits? [...] food is not optional." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "Had it {{not been}} for the Tartars I would not <b>be</b> <b>alive</b> <b>today.</b> They were the nomads of the Crimea, in what was then no man's land between the Russian and German fronts, and favoured neither side. I had already struck up a good {{relationship}} with them, and often wandered off to sit with them. ‘Du nix njemcky’ they would say, ‘du Tartar,’ and try to persuade me to join their clan. Their nomadic ways attracted me of course, although by that time their movements had been restricted. Yet, it was they who discovered me in the snow after the crash, when the German search parties had given up. I was still unconscious then and only came round completely after twelve days or so, and by then I was back in a German field hospital. So the memories I have of that time are images that penetrated my consciousness. The last thing I remember was that it was too late to jump, too late for the parachutes to open. That must have been a couple of seconds before hitting the ground. Luckily I was not strapped in – I always preferred free movement to safety belts… My friend was strapped in and he was atomized on impact – there was almost nothing to be found of him afterwards. But I must have shot through the windscreen as it flew back at the same speed as the plane hit the ground and that saved me, though I had bad skull and jaw injuries. Then the tail flipped over and I was completely buried in the snow. That's how the Tartars found me days later. I remember voices saying ‘Voda’ (Water), then the felt of their tents, and the dense pungent smell of cheese, fat and milk. They covered my body in fat to help it regenerate warmth, and wrapped it in felt as an insulator to keep warmth in." ...|$|E

50|$|Steven A. Benner, Alonso Ricardo, and Matthew A.

5000|$|Historically, {{this has}} been one of the most {{difficult}} passages to resolve with a literal interpretation of the text. At face value it would seem to imply that the disciples would still <b>be</b> <b>alive</b> <b>today.</b> Awkward legends arose suggesting that the disciples to whom Jesus was speaking did not die but remain alive, eventually developing into legends like those of the Wandering Jew and Prester John. C. S. Lewis called this [...] "the most embarrassing verse in the Bible".|$|E
