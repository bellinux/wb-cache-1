50|$|The {{importance}} of the freight road waned as the Oregon Short Line Railroad and the Utah Northern Railroad pushed into Oregon, Idaho, and Montana. By July 1884 the stage route was defunct, but Kelton still had the transcontinental railroad. Even that was taken away in 1903 - 1904, when the main line was relocated to the south to a route called the Lucin Cutoff, across the Great Salt Lake itself. Kelton's former section was relegated to a mere <b>backup</b> <b>line,</b> used in case of high water, and to service local farmers and ranchers. There was so little traffic on the line that the weekly local train would often stop for a half-hour of rabbit hunting.|$|E
5000|$|After Hindenburg and Ludendorff {{took over}} OHL on 29 August 1916, Loßberg {{was delighted to}} watch {{the spirit of the}} army revive. The German attacks on Verdun were stopped immediately. Unlike their {{predecessors}} Moltke and Falkenhayn, the new team solicited and freely discussed ideas. Loßberg was asked for a report describing his defensive tactics. In September construction began on a new <b>backup</b> <b>line</b> well behind the current front, which the enemy called the Hindenburg line. It was built with all recent refinements, including shallow dugouts with concrete roofs that could be left quickly when attacks began. When Loßberg motored through the almost completed line he saw that the artillery observation posts were built into the front line trenches, which therefore were on a forward slope exposed to enemy ground observers. Supported by Below and their Army Group Commander the Crown Prince Rupprecht of Bavaria, Loßberg successfully argued for building a new front line, wherever possible on a reverse slope, with positions for a light line of first resistance on the crest, so now the artillery observers were in the second line, overlooking the enemy. OHL issued a paper the [...] "Conduct of the Defensive Battle" [...] on 1 December 1916. Mostly written by junior staff officers, it incorporated many of Loßberg's ideas for mobile defense in depth but also recommended elasticity: permitting the defenders of the front line to retreat if forced. Loßberg still strongly opposed elasticity in his report that OHL published on 30 January 1917.|$|E

40|$|We report {{evidence}} from the equity market that unused loan commitments expose banks to systematic liquidity risk, especially during crises {{such as the one}} observed in the fall of 1998. We also find, however, that banks with higher levels of transactions deposits had lower risk during the 1998 crisis than other banks. These banks experienced large inflows of funds just as they were needed [...] when liquidity demanded by firms taking down funds from commercial paper <b>backup</b> <b>lines</b> of credit peaked. Our evidence suggests that combining loan commitments with deposits mitigates liquidity risk, and that this deposit-lending synergy is especially powerful during period of crises as nervous investors move funds into their banks. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{argues that}} banks {{have a unique}} ability to hedge against market-wide {{liquidity}} shocks. Deposit inflows provide funding for loan demand shocks that follow declines in market liquidity. Consequently, one dimension of bank specialness' is that banks can insure firms against systematic declines in market liquidity at lower cost than other financial institutions. We provide supporting empirical evidence from the commercial paper (CP) market. When market liquidity dries up and CP spreads increase, banks experience funding inflows. These flows allow banks to meet increased loan demand from borrowers drawing funds from pre-existing commercial paper <b>backup</b> <b>lines,</b> without running down their holdings of liquid assets. Moreover, the supply of cheap funds is sufficiently large so that pricing on new lines of credit actually falls as market spreads widen. ...|$|R
30|$|In Hunan province, each highway toll station must {{transfer}} the collected information on vehicles and roads to the Management Center located in Changsha city {{from time to}} time. The Management Center (MC) plays a role as centralized data center for highway information computing, storage, and monitoring. A toll station can {{transfer the}} traffic information by private highway fiber network or by VPN rented from China Telecom as a <b>backup</b> <b>line.</b> While in some areas, especially the mountainous areas, the wired channel to MC is very disruption prone due to disrepair and aging of lines. Toll stations would have to choose the wireless broadband service rented from China Mobile when the wired channel failed and toll stations were disconnected from the MC. But in these areas, all stations are not equipped with access points connecting RRHs, and those with access points may have a different wireless channel QoS due to the difference of distance, terrain, and devices. One of possible solutions under this condition is to select a toll station as a relay node, which should have the best wireless QoS compared to other stations nearby. The nearby stations could transfer the traffic information to the relay node by wired channel (providing the wired channel between them is working well) or by D 2 D communications. After that, the relay node would transfer the traffic information to MC by wireless broadband channel. Thus, it is desirable for the relay node to be dynamically configured to choose an optimal solution for reducing communication cost while subject to time constraints. The service provided by this relay node is the data service in this context. The relay node is a service provider who should take responsibilities of configuring and optimizing the data transferring procedure.|$|E

30|$|As an {{artificial}} network, the main task {{of a power}} system is to deliver electrical energy to customers, which means connecting the power sources and loads through power lines. Hence the connectivity is a key feature of power system topologies. Reviewing the history of power systems, we find the power system topologies in the past can only meet the requirement of connectivity. From {{the point of view}} of graph theory, the earliest power system topology is a tree-like structure. We can easily define the power source and the loads as the root node and the leaf nodes, respectively. There is only one path between the root node and each leaf node. As power system technology was developed, and customers required more reliable electricity, the topology of power systems began to change. Transmission systems are designed as reticular structures. A number of tie lines or tie switches are installed in distribution systems, which are implemented as <b>backup</b> <b>lines</b> or switches to transfer loads when faults occur. Through the above analysis, we design an algorithm to obtain connected random topologies for simulating real-world power grids. Firstly, we stochastically generate a spanning tree that contains all the nodes in the power grid, and then add a certain number of lines to meet the requirement of the average degree of the power grid topology.|$|R
40|$|The {{catalyst}} of {{the current}} financial turmoil has been the losses on the subprime mortgage market. However, the low quality of these partly collateralised housing loans was known {{for a while and}} the default on subprime mortgages largely expected. Therefore, how to account for the fact that an expected shock on a small segment of the US mortgage market turned into a major financial crisis, causing the near-collapse of the Commercial Paper and of the interbank lending markets, that is to say of two of the most liquid financial markets? Banks have transferred risks to special entities, the so-called “conduits”, SIV (Special Investment Vehicles) and SPV (Special Purpose Vehicles). Such a practice gave the false impression that credit risk was transferred from banks outside the financial system. This was indeed not the case. The funding needs associated in particular with <b>backup</b> <b>lines</b> of credit for off-balance sheet vehicles generated pressures on the the interbank markets and led central banks to massively intervene. The roots {{of the current}} turmoil are therefore of a deeper and structural nature. For that reason, it is necessary to assess, from a longer term perspective, what are the main consequences of the recent structural changes on financial markets {{in order to have a}} good grasp on the current financial market dynamics and clarify what is meant nowadays by liquidity. ...|$|R
