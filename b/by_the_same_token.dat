40|$|The "delayed hypersensitive" {{reactivity}} {{induced by}} antigen-antibody complexes {{has been studied}} from the standpoints {{of the role of}} such complexes in establishing this state, and the relationship of this state to classical delayed hypersensitivity. It has been shown that <b>the</b> reactivity established <b>by</b> antigen-antibody complexes appears early after injection, disappears within a few days, and is characterized by several properties which make it appear similar to true delayed hypersensitivity, including its appearance, its relative persistence for 48 hours, and its occurrence in the absence of antibodies. <b>By</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>tokens,</b> it may be distinguished from hypersensitive reactions of the immediate type. It is referred to here as reactivity of the Jones-Mote type.

If sufficiently small doses of antigen are employed, however, the "monophasic" reaction which follows antigen-antibody complexes consisting of the Jones-Mote type of skin responsiveness may be seen. The dermal reactivity under discussion is unlike classical delayed hypersensitivity chiefly in its evanescent character; it is present only during a few days early after antigen administration. It is suggested that this kind of reactivity, which may perhaps require a category of its own, {{may be related to the}} "tissue immunity" to tumor transplants which has been observed in mice...|$|R

5|$|Theophrastus {{was barely}} known to western Europe in the Middle Ages; his {{writings}} were popularized there {{only in the}} 15th century, when Greek manuscripts in the Vatican, possibly, like many other ancient Vatican Greek manuscripts, brought from the Byzantine Empire during its fall to the Ottomans in the 15th century, were translated into Latin by the Byzantine Greek refugee Theodorus Gaza {{at the request of}} pope Nicholas V. The effect was to stimulate Renaissance scholars to restart the exploration of plant taxonomy. The science of botany was founded as these scholars engaged with the accounts of plants, and especially of their medicinal uses, together with a newly critical reaction to mediaeval pharmacology, which was based on unthinking acceptance of the Natural History of Pliny the Elder and the De Materia Medica of Dioscorides. <b>By</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>token,</b> however, Theophrastus (and Aristotle) fell abruptly out of use around 1550, as classical botany and zoology were effectively assimilated into Renaissance thought in the form of illustrated encyclopedias—which were still heavily based on classical writings.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{present a}} new type system and {{associated}} type checker, analysis, and model extraction algorithms for automatically extracting models that capture aspects of a program’s design. Our type system enables the developer to place a token on each object; this token serves as the object’s representative during the analysis and model extraction. The polymorphism in our type system {{enables the use of}} general-purpose classes whose instances may serve different purposes in the computation; programmers may also hide the details of internal data structures <b>by</b> placing <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>token</b> on all of the objects in these data structures. Our combined type system and analysis provide the model extraction algorithms with sound heap aliasing information. Our algorithms can therefore extract both structural models that characterize object referencing relationships and behavioral models that capture indirect interactions mediated <b>by</b> objects in <b>the</b> heap. Previous approaches, in contrast, limited by an absence of aliasing information, have focused on controlflow interactions that take place at procedure call boundaries. We have implemented our type checker, analysis, and model extraction algorithms and used them to automatically extract design models. Our experience indicates that it is straightforward to produce the token annotations and that the extracted models provide useful insight into the structure and behavior of the program. ...|$|R
40|$|The lawyer {{of today}} takes vicarious {{liability}} {{as a matter}} of course. And, <b>by</b> pretty much <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>token,</b> he takes <b>the</b> idea of imputed contributory negligence {{as a matter of}} course. By general American law, Truck Owner - although altogether free from any personal fault - is liable to Highway Traveler who is injured <b>by</b> <b>the</b> negligence of Truck Owner 2 ̆ 7 s employee, Driver, while Driver is acting in the scope of his employment. And if Highway Traveler negligently damages the truck, Owner will be barred from recovering for this damage if Driver 2 ̆ 7 s negligence also contributes to causing it. This is all perfectly familiar doctrine, and it therefore seems natural. But upon further analysis and after a longer look at history, several things about this situation will loom up as passing strange. These things in turn will raise the inquiries of whether vicarious liability or imputed contributory negligence may be justified at all; and, if either of them may be, whether they should go hand in hand as they generally do now...|$|R
5|$|Though it is {{the least}} {{reactive}} of the halogens, iodine {{is still one of}} the more reactive elements. For example, while chlorine gas will halogenate carbon monoxide, nitrogen monoxide, and sulfur dioxide to phosgene, nitrosyl chloride, and sulfuryl chloride respectively, iodine will not do so. Furthermore, iodination of metals tends to result in lower oxidation states than chlorination or bromination; for example, rhenium metal reacts with chlorine to form rhenium hexachloride, but with bromine it forms only rhenium pentabromide and iodine can achieve only rhenium tetraiodide. <b>By</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>token,</b> however, since iodine has the lowest ionisation energy among the halogens and is the most easily oxidised of them, it has a more significant cationic chemistry and its higher oxidation states are rather more stable than those of bromine and chlorine, for example in iodine heptafluoride.|$|E
5|$|Nitrogen may be usefully {{compared}} to its horizontal neighbours carbon and oxygen {{as well as}} its vertical neighbours in the pnictogen column (phosphorus, arsenic, antimony, and bismuth). Although each period 2 element from lithium to nitrogen shows some similarities to the period 3 element in the next group from magnesium to sulfur (known as the diagonal relationships), their degree drops off quite abruptly past the boron–silicon pair, so that the similarities of nitrogen to sulfur are mostly limited to sulfur nitride ring compounds when both elements are the only ones present. Nitrogen resembles oxygen far more than it does carbon with its high electronegativity and concomitant capability for hydrogen bonding and the ability to form coordination complexes by donating its lone pairs of electrons. It does not share carbon's proclivity for catenation, with the longest chain of nitrogen yet discovered being composed of only eight nitrogen atoms (PhN=N–N(Ph)–N=N–N(Ph)–N=NPh). One property nitrogen does share with both its horizontal neighbours is its preferentially forming multiple bonds, typically with carbon, nitrogen, or oxygen atoms, through pπ–pπ interactions; thus, for example, nitrogen occurs as diatomic molecules and thus has very much lower melting (−210°C) and boiling points (−196°C) than the rest of its group, as the N2 molecules are only held together by weak van der Waals interactions and there are very few electrons available to create significant instantaneous dipoles. This is not possible for its vertical neighbours; thus, the nitrogen oxides, nitrites, nitrates, nitro-, nitroso-, azo-, and diazo-compounds, azides, cyanates, thiocyanates, and imino-derivatives find no echo with phosphorus, arsenic, antimony, or bismuth. <b>By</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>token,</b> however, the complexity of the phosphorus oxoacids finds no echo with nitrogen.|$|E

40|$|Access to {{affordable}} {{prescription drug}} {{is the critical}} mass of any meaningful public health policy. However, the spiralling prescription drug costs and the concomitant access problems are transcendent, posing a daunting challenge for governments of both rich and poor countries. Arguably the greatest challenge for policy makers is how best to secure affordable prescription drug {{in the name of}} welfare and equity, without trammelling innovative medicine. However, the combustible mixture of patents, markets, and the pharmaceutical industry’s penchant for maximising profits, has helped shape the current trajectory of pharmaceutical R&D disproportionate targeting of profitable drug representing just ten per cent of the world’s disease burden. <b>By</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> markets <b>token,</b> <b>the</b> United States, the country with the most competitive pharmaceutical industry, still struggles against the tide of cross-border purchase of cheaper prescription drug by her citizens in Canada and Mexico. In Britain, as in most European countries, the highly regulated prescription drug pricing regime under the national health insurance scheme, often excludes expensive ‘drug of last resort’ albeit with proven clinical benefits. India has been regulating drug prices since the 1950 s, and the recent spike in cheaper generics of patented drugs, has exacerbated tensions, and set local and foreign pharmaceutical industry on a collision course. Using empirical data and relevant literature, the paper critically reviews the cumulative effects of the legal and socio-economic externalities that shape the current global pharmaceutical production trajectory. While noting the imperatives of equitably balancing the inherent conflicts between the pharmaceutical industry’s profit-maximising objectives and public health needs, the paper canvasses for the supplementation of the current patents and markets driven monocultural prescription drug economics, with a normative, non-market, internationally mediated drug production paradigm that is cognisant of the overriding public health needs...|$|R
