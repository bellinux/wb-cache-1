40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to explore the issues {{surrounding}} a long planned expansion of Payment by Results (PbR) into mental health services and to highlight the factors responsible for the delay. Design/methodology/approach – PbR relies upon “standardisation” of conditions and treatments. This depends upon a scheme of classification that can realistically predict resources required to execute treatment of any one case. Plans to fund NHS mental health services on the <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>tariffs</b> derived in this way have been delayed, and a key reason is the lack of high-quality data. This would require effective “standardisation-to the-average” of both a system of classification and a repertoire of costed treatment pathways. This paper investigated the delay implementation by exploring the difficulties in applying standardisation principles to service provision and tariff calculation. Findings – The paper identified the fundamental difficulty with PbR’s implementation in applying “standardisation” to practice. This is defining the mental disorder that the patient is suffering and designing care pathways at clinical level considering the balance between practical applicability and conceptual/constructional validity. This is necessary to enable the calculation of a national tariff. The conceptual flaws of the Health of the Nation Outcome Scale led to the constructional shortcomings which compromised the credibility and validity of Mental Health Clustering Tool regarding making accurate classification in a standardised way. The validity and credibility of calculating a national tariff thus became contentious on the basis of this inaccurate clinical classification system. Originality/value – This paper explored the driving factors of delay in implementing PbR in mental health through connecting the recent reform with the fundamental assumptions of “standardisation-to the-average”, which provided another perspective to illustrate the current obstacles...|$|E

The statutory Scheme retained the occasions for compensation but broke the link with common law damages, providing instead for payments to be made on the <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> a <b>tariff</b> <b>of</b> injury awards. But it continued to make payments for loss of earnings, special expenses and additional compensation in fatal cases. Minor revisions were made in 2001 and 2008, but following the government's consultation, ‘Getting it Right for Victims and Witnesses’, a major revision took effect in November 2012. Made largely to reduce public expenditure, this revision substantially limits both the numbers of victims of violent crime to be compensated and the levels of their awards. While this marks a further shift away from the original common law model, the 2012 Scheme remains a unique taxpayer-funded response to victims of violent crime, again prompting the question: why, and to what, extent should the state make financial provision for victims of violent crime that goes beyond welfare?

This argument has been long-term applied as an assumption in many theoretical trade models. Feenstra (2004) shows that the theoretical optimal tariff is equal to the inverse foreign export supply elasticity which implies if we can get the value of inverse export elasticity for each good then we can set up the optimal tariff to maximized our national welfare. Compared with the development in theory, the progress in the empirical study of terms-of-trade argument has been a bit stagnant until recent years. Christian Broda, Nuno Limão and David Weinstein (2008) show us an important empirical evidence that countries use market power when they set up tariff in their non-cooperative trade policy.

The EPHESUS pharmacoeconomic analysis was performed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of eplerenone in the Swiss setting. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 6, 632 patients with LVSD and heart failure after AMI were randomized to eplerenone or placebo and followed for a mean of 16 months. The co-primary endpoints were all-cause death and the composite of cardiovascular death/cardiovascular hospitalization. The evaluation of resource use included hospitalizations, outpatient services, and medications. Survival beyond the trial period was estimated {{using data from the}} Framingham Heart Study, the Saskatchewan Health database, and the Worcester Heart Attack Registry. The incremental cost-effectiveness of eplerenone in cost per life-year and quality-adjusted life-year gained was estimated. The perspective of the Swiss third party payers was used. Daily treatment costs of eplerenone were set at CHF 3. 88. All other resources were valued on the <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> official <b>tariffs.</b> Discounting <b>of</b> the results was performed at a rate of 3 %. RESULTS: The number of life-years gained with eplerenone was 0. 1083 based on Framingham, 0. 0661 with Saskatchewan and 0. 1518 with Worcester survival estimates. Total costs were CHF 1, 028 higher over the trial period in the eplerenone arm, due to drug cost. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was CHF 10, 145 per life-year gained with Framingham, CHF 16, 178 with Saskatchewan, and CHF 7, 693 with Worcester survival estimates. The corresponding costs per QALY were CHF 15, 219, CHF 23, 965 and CHF 11, 337, respectively.
