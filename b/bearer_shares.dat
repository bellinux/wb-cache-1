40|$|It is {{difficult}} for organizations to effectively manage personal knowledge {{so it can be}} mobilized, shared, and rewarded to benefit the organization. The difficulties are compounded in large organizations where people with potentially valuable knowledge are unknown to one another and dispersed geographically.

A large engineering and project management organization ("EPMO") has prototyped a methodology to graphically codify, index and map staff knowledge using mind mapping technologies.

40|$|After {{democracy}} (1994) {{the doors}} {{of teaching and learning}} in music opened widely to include local indigenous music and culture in South Africa. Since 2005, African music has been a vibrant aspect of the music curriculum within the School of Music, North West University, South Africa. Globally tertiary music educators are challenged to include informal pedagogy of indigenous musics within the formal context of university courses. University music courses in South Africa are still predisposed towards ‘western’ music pedagogies. In October 2012, the School of Music invited a visiting expert in African music and dance to offer onsite teaching and learning of Ugandan dance songs to tertiary students. The initiative to include Ugandan music as part of the teaching and learning workshops on African music at the School of Music was funded by the South African Music Rights Organization. The School of Music has an ongoing policy to invite and include culture <b>bearers</b> to <b>share</b> their skills and expertise with students and academics.

40|$|In today’s economy, {{organizational}} {{knowledge is}} a fundamental factor for remaining competitive and managing intellectual capital. Knowledge Management aims to improve organizational performance by designing the work environment with necessary tools. Yet, significant amount of knowledge resides within the people in different forms such as experience or abilities. Transferring individual knowledge within members or into organizational repositories is so difficult. Knowledge sharing only occurs under certain circumstances: People share knowledge when they believe it is beneficial for them, when they feel safe and secure, and when they trust. Since knowledge is power, and brings respect to its <b>bearer,</b> knowledge <b>sharing</b> needs suitable environment. In this context, this study investigates intention to knowledge sharing among forensics in the Turkish National Police (TNP) and the factors -such as perceived organizational justice, organizational citizenship behaviors, subjective norms, and attitudes toward knowledge sharing- affecting their intentions. The researcher utilized a model developed from Ajzen and Fishbein’s (1975; 1980) theory of reasoned action (TRA). To test this model, a self-administered questionnaire survey was administered in Turkey In order to analyze the quantitative data; SPSS version 19 was used for all preliminary analyses and LISREL 8. 8 was used for Regression Analysis and Path Analysis The fit of the data to this proposed model was not adequate.

40|$|In {{the last}} twenty years, the {{squatting}} movement in Rome has witnessed a steady increase of foreign participants as regular members but a scarce presence among the leadership. Moreover, the incidence of immigrants among squatters is typically not marked in the public self-representation of the movement yet overemphasized and disputed by mainstream media. The essay attempts an interpretation of this peculiar distribution of foreign immigrants among squatters. On the one side, their being foreigners within Italian welfare puts them at risk of higher exclusion; on the other, political leaders in the squats may see the foreigners (as <b>bearers</b> of a <b>shared</b> class condition) as a suitable pool for the wider political aim of squatting, namely the implementation of an alternative urban lifestyle. Furthermore, foreigners may take part into squats just as a self-attained form of social emancipation, since the act of squatting may equal an otherwise inaccessible house possession. Within these apparently contradictory aims, multi-ethnic squats turn into cosmopolitan spaces of identities that accept transcending their specificities to pour into a common kiln of class identity, between revolutionary proletariat and pity bourgeoisie seeking full social integration...|$|R
40|$|It is {{difficult}} for organizations to effectively manage personal knowledge {{so it can be}} mobilized, shared, and rewarded to benefit the organization. These difficulties occur particularly in large geographically dispersed, hierarchical organizations. The management of developing, identifying successful practices, building up and maintaining tacit knowledge, requires an understanding of how these ideas have emerged within the organization through a Tacit Knowledge Exchange (TKE) process. Identification and understanding of TKE characteristics {{is difficult}} as they are invisible (tacit). The TKE process in action requires the adoption of multiple methods and approaches employed simultaneously. A series of cases study instances were used as a basis for the methodology, each contributing specific aspects of the methodology. The initial three case study instances, each yielded specific characteristics regarding tacit knowledge exchange and networking. The findings from the initial three case study instances were tested in a large hierarchical, complex engineering organization. This final case study instance, prototyped a methodology to graphically codify, index and build up in-house tacit knowledge abilities through mapping staff knowledge. The final case study instance allowed for investigations into what these TKE characteristics of a complex organization would utilize To date, specific TKE characteristics have not been well understood. This research contributed to specific understanding of the identification TKE characteristics and network structures. The outcome of the research provided a graphical structure identifying who would be likely to possess the kind of knowledge they need to find. The interview process was an important facilitator to precondition the knowledge <b>bearers</b> for <b>sharing,</b> thus locating key "human attractors" within and between working groups and communities with experts sharing the same issues and interests. The research also focused on the tacit knowledge sharing which occurred as a transition period, prior the formation of Communities of Practice (CoPs) evolving from Communities of Interest" (CoI). Previous research and case studies have focused primarily on the CoP phenomena within larger organizations and not the areas of transition. New strategies were adopted to highlight characteristics and previously unidentified attributes that support sustainable, successful Tacit Knowledge Exchange (TKE) in relation to explicit structures preventing any unnecessary re-invention through emerging lessons learnt from previous experiences. Through mapping lessons of tacit knowledge protocols and frameworks, the relationship between tacit explicit knowledge management strategies could be understood. These Tacit Knowledge Networking (TKN) strategies were important as they ensured sustainable long-term success, through well-integrated explicit and tacit knowledge management capabilities...|$|R

These warrants are easily transferable without any need for a transfer document; that is, they can simply be passed from hand to hand.
