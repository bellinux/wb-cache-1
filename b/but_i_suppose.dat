500|$|Between 1901 and 1903, Leno {{recorded}} {{more than}} twenty-five songs and monologues on the Gramophone and Typewriter Company label. He also made 14 short films {{towards the end of}} his life, in which he portrayed a bumbling buffoon who struggles to carry out everyday tasks, such as riding a bicycle or opening a bottle of champagne. On 26 November 1901, Leno, along with Seymour Hicks and his wife, the actress Ellaline Terriss, was invited to Sandringham House {{to take part in a}} Royal Command Performance to entertain King Edward VII, Queen Alexandra, their son George and his wife, Mary, the Prince and Princess of Wales. [...] Leno performed a thirty-five-minute solo act that included two of his best-known songs: [...] "How to Buy a House" [...] and [...] "The Huntsman". After the performance, Leno reported, [...] "The King, the Queen and the Prince of Wales all very kindly shook hands with me and told me how much they had enjoyed it. The Princess of Wales was just going to shake hands with me, when she looked at my face, and couldn't do it for some time, because she laughed so much. I wasn't intending to look funny– I was really trying to look dignified and courtly; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> I couldn't help myself." [...] As a memento, the king presented Leno with a jewel-encrusted royal tie pin, and thereafter, Leno became known as [...] "the King's Jester". Leno was the first music hall performer to give a Royal Command Performance during the king's reign.|$|E

Dudek has won them the cup. He deserved to be man of the match. We didn't get a break. Dudek's performance encouraged them to stay near their penalty box. In tough games like that the first goal is very important. It's a test for us. We can either accept defeat or we can fight back." [...] Captain Keane was disappointed with the defeat: [...] "The players, managers, staff are all upset <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> nowhere near as bad as the fans, if you don't win a match in football you feel as though you have let the fans down." [...] His focus turned to United's participation in the UEFA Champions League, as they looked to end the season with a trophy: [...] "It would have been nice {{to get a piece of}} silverware in the cabinet, especially with the opposition being Liverpool, we've just got to lick our wounds. We've got a game against Leeds on Wednesday and we'll get on with training for Wednesday. The players know we'll have to get together, get ready and try to keep the pressure on Arsenal. But we are eight points behind them, which puts them in a very strong position and again we are pinning our hopes on the European Cup, which is a dangerous game to play as we saw last season." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1832, {{commercial}} shipper Edmund Roberts began {{acting as}} an envoy to Asia {{on behalf of}} the United States government, with the intent of negotiating trade deals in the region. During his mission, he reached deals both with Said bin Sultan, the Sultan of Muscat and Oman, and the Phra Khlang of Siam (modern Thailand), an important financial minister of that nation. Roberts was given items which were to be presented as gifts to the officials with whom he was negotiating, but described them as being of [...] "very mean quality, and of inconsiderable value". After the treaties were ratified in the United States, Roberts had to return to Siam and Muscat to receive approval from the representatives of those nations. In a letter to the Department of State dated October 8, 1834, Roberts decried the gifts of his previous journey as inadequate and insulting to his hosts in the Orient. In addition to several other items, he requested a set of coins as an appropriate offering to Said bin Sultan: I am rather at a loss to know what articles will be most acceptable to the Sultan, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> a complete set of new gold & silver & copper coins of the U.S. neatly arranged in a morocco case & then to have an outward covering would be proper to send not only to the sultan, but to other Asiatics. In a November 11, 1834, letter sent to Mint Director Samuel Moore, Secretary of State John Forsyth approved Roberts' suggestion, writing: The President [...] has directed that a complete set of the coins of the United States be sent to the King of Siam, and another to the Sultan of Muscat. You are requested, therefore, to forward to the Department for that purpose, duplicate specimens of each kind now in use, whether of gold, silver, or copper. He also directed Moore to have two Morocco leather boxes made to house the coins. He stated that one should be yellow in color, and the other crimson, and that funds could be drawn from the Treasury for the value of the boxes and coins. Later, in a letter dated December 2, 1834, Forsyth directed Moore to include [...] "national emblems" [...] (including an eagle and stars) on the exterior of the cases.|$|E
500|$|Robert K. Elder of the Chicago Tribune praised Rick Heinrichs's {{production}} design and Jim Carrey {{for having a}} balanced performance as a scene stealer. Elder called the film [...] "exceptionally clever, hilariously gloomy and bitingly subversive." [...] Desson Thomson from The Washington Post reasoned over a fellow film-goer's characterization of Count Olaf, [...] "Olaf is a humorless villain in the book. He's not amusing like Carrey at all. To which I would counter: If you can't let Carrey be Carrey, put someone boring and less expensive in the role. In his various disguises he's rubbery, inventive and improvisationally inspired. I particularly liked his passing imitation of a dinosaur." [...] Ty Burr, writing in The Boston Globe, observed, [...] "Director Brad Silberling has essentially made a Tim Burton movie without the weird shafts of adolescent pain. At the same time, Silberling's not a hack like Chris Columbus, and Snicket has more zip and inspired filmcraft than the first two Harry Potter films. The film's no masterpiece, but at least you're {{in the hands of}} people who know what they're doing. The movie, like the books, flatters children's innate sense that the world is not a perfect place and that anyone who insists otherwise is trying to sell you something. How you deal with the cognitive dissonance of a $125 million Hollywood picture telling you this is up to you. At least there are no Lemony Snicket Happy Meals. Yet." [...] Internet reviewer James Berardinelli felt that [...] "the film is first and foremost a fantasy, but there are dark currents running just beneath the surface. I give Silberling credit for not allowing them to swallow the film. Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events manages to remain witty throughout." [...] Roger Ebert gave a mixed review: [...] "Jim Carrey is over the top as Count Olaf, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> a character named Count Olaf is over the top by definition. I liked the film, but I'll tell you what. I think this one is a tune-up for the series, a trial run in which they figure out what works and what needs to be tweaked. The original Spider-Man was a disappointment, but the same team came back and made Spider-Man 2, the best superhero movie ever made." [...] Scott Foundas of Variety gave a negative review, criticizing the filmmakers for sacrificing the storyline in favor of visual elements such as set design and cinematography. He wrote, [...] "A Series of Unfortunate Events suggests what Mary Poppins might have looked like had Tim Burton directed it. Not surprisingly, Burton's longtime {{production design}}er Rick Heinrichs was responsible for the sets, while ace Emmanuel Lubezki (Burton's Sleepy Hollow) contributed the expressionistic lighting schemes." ...|$|E

Another logician John Venn, however, in his 1881 Symbolic Logic, turned a jaundiced eye to this effort: [...] "I have no high estimate myself {{of the interest}} or importance of what are sometimes called logical machines ... {{it does not seem}} to me that any contrivances at present known or likely to be discovered really deserve the name of logical machines"; see more at Algorithm characterizations. But not to be outdone he too presented [...] "a plan somewhat analogous, I apprehend, to Prof. Jevon's abacus ... gain, corresponding to Prof. Jevons's logical machine, the following contrivance may be described.

2500|$|Being {{the record}} a more {{developed}} and mature set of songs, [...] "Subject to Change" [...] also {{proved to be}} The Faith's swan song, as the group disbanded {{by the summer of}} 1983. Drummer Ivor Hanson announced he would soon leave for college. Finding a replacement was not an option. According to guitarist Mike Hampton, the rest of the band was having trouble getting along. [...] "It was a good time to stop, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> it’s a shame that we flamed out before getting a solid tour set up and executed, but it’s also a wonder and a success that we did what we did." [...] Alec declared that it was getting more difficult to be productive and creative together, although the end was also a beginning. After The Faith broke up, guitarist Eddie Janney formed Rites of Spring with Guy Picciotto; while Hampton, Bald, and Hanson went on to join Embrace with Ian MacKaye on vocals. When Embrace broke up in early 1986, Chris Bald rejoined Alec MacKaye in Ignition (with Alec on vocals;) meanwhile, Janney reunited with Michael Hampton for One Last Wish following Rites of Spring's breakup (later reformed as Happy Go Licky.) Finally, Hampton and Hanson reunited in Manifesto in 1991, while Alec MacKaye sang with The Warmers during the mid-'90s.|$|E
2500|$|Taking {{his seat}} in the House of Lords, Fitzwilliam {{attended}} almost every notable debate, signing nearly every protest which the opposition used but never made a speech during Lord North's premiership. He supported John Wilkes in his fight to keep the seat {{he was elected to}} and supported the American Colonies in their dispute with Britain. On 8 July 1776 he asked Lord Rockingham to arrange for a remonstrance to be sent to the King when war broke out in America, so the Americans would see [...] "that there is still in the country a body of men of the first rank and importance, who would still wish to govern them according to the old policy". George Selwyn MP recorded that on 6 March 1782 he had been confronted by Fitzwilliam at the Brooks's and had to listen to Fitzwilliam on the dire state of the nation: [...] "I do not know if he was in earnest, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> that he was. He had worked himself up to commiserate the state of the country, nay, that of the king himself, [...] that I expected every instant that his heart would have burst". When Selwyn asked Fitzwilliam [...] "if there was a possibility of salvation in any position in which our affairs could be placed", Fitzwilliam [...] "asked me...with the utmost impetuosity, what objection I had to Lord Rock being sent for. You may be pretty sure, that if I had any, I should not have made it".|$|E
2500|$|As to the radula of this species, it is a {{very small}} and rather obscure object, and only by teasing it to pieces, I could get an idea of the shape of the teeth. The uncini quite cover the median rows, and cross even the uncini of the {{opposite}} side. The rhachidian or median tooth has a subquadrate basal part, with rounded, convex posterior and less convex lateral margins. It has a broad, triangular cusp, with one small median denticle and about 6 smaller ones on each side. The laterals one on each side, have a transversely triangular shape, with an unarmed, arched upper and concave proximal and basal margin, with blunt points at the proximal and distal extremities of the basal margin. On each side I see at least 3, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> there are 4 uncini which are long, slender and strongly curved. Though this radula has some resemblance with that of Aporrhais, like Verrill (Mollusca of the New England coast. Transact. Connecticut Acad, of arts and sciences, Vol. VI, May 1884, p. 1S6 and 188) has stated, and like his figure (I.e. pi. 31, fig. 14b) affirms, I cannot agree without doubt with his view that it should be taenioglossate, as the [...] "Siboga"-specimen has a radula with at least 9 rows of teeth and probably 11. The nacreous character of the shell agrees with the Rhipidoglossa, and so does the larger number of uncini. I should think the genus will belong to the Rhipidoglossa with a restricted number of teeth, such as Basilissa. As however only a knowledge of other anatomical particulars, the position and structure of the gills, of the heart etc. can decide the question I have left the family near Trichotropis in accordance with the newest systematic arrangement of Paul Pelseneer (A treatise on Zoology, edited by Ray Lankester, Part V, Mollusca, 1906, p.156) ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{historian}} Tony Joseph wrote: [...] "But Green was not {{the only}} member of the Company to leave.... Ella Halman left too. [...] So did Richard Watson ... Margaret Mitchell ... Radley Flynn and no fewer than twenty-two other small part players and choristers. [...] It was the largest single exodus of performers in D'Oyly Carte history, and that was why the sense of sadness that hovered over the season was so marked.... August 1951 was the end of an era. Cynthia Morey, who joined the Company just before the defections, wrote: [...] "I have never found out precisely why this great exodus took place.... We were always under the impression that we should feel honoured to be in the employ of the D’Oyly Carte Opera Company; it was patently obvious that the management held firmly to the policy that nobody is indispensable". [...] Morey noted that Evans had played several roles with the company and commented, [...] "In 1927 she was apparently demoted to the chorus, and there she remained for [...] ... I should not have thought these qualifications sufficient for such an important post; to spend all those years as a chorister seems to signify a lack of ambition or achievement. [...] <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> a 'Director of Productions' in those days merely needed to know every move and every gesture, and exactly when they occurred, for no departure from the set production was ever permitted." [...] Richard Walker, Kenneth Sandford and others also criticised Evans's temperament and methods. [...] She retired as stage director in 1953, the year that her husband died, but she was engaged to coach new D'Oyly Carte principals in their roles for some years thereafter.|$|E
2500|$|In 1966 Gary Sobers' {{powerful}} West Indian team toured England and Snow was recalled {{after his}} 7/29 and 4/18 destroyed them before 10,000 people at Hove when Sussex beat the tourists by 9 wickets. He took 4/84 and 0/117 in the Third Test at Trent Bridge and 3/143 in the Fourth at Headingley but the West Indies won {{them both to}} go 3–0 up in the series and the formidable Brian Close was made captain for the final Test. Snow was initially dropped for [...] The Oval, but was recalled due to the injury to the recalled John Price, then considered the fastest bowler in England. It was the turning point of his career as England collapsed to 166 for 7, before Tom Graveney 165 and John Murray 112 consolidated, but it still left England a little short of a commanding score until Snow hit eight boundaries in his 59 not out and added 128 with fellow bowler Ken Higgs, who made 63. This was two runs short of the then Test record for the tenth wicket, and is still a Test record for the last wicket between England and the West Indies. It remains as the all-time Test match record partnership between batsmen 10 and 11. They retired to the pavilion for a beer afterwards, but had their pints hurriedly replaced by teacups for their newspaper picture by officials concerned {{with the image of}} the game. Snow's 59 not out was the first test 50 by an England number 11 batsman and remained a record until Jimmy Anderson made 81 against India in 2014. Snow (2/66 & 3/40) removed the West Indian openers Conrad Hunte and Easton McMorris for 12 runs in the second innings, Brian Close caught Sobers off him for a first ball duck and England won a stunning victory by an innings and 34 runs. Sobers explained that [...] "the ball from Snow bounced a bit <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> I was beaten by the speed more than anything. I didn't get hold of it properly, edged it into my body. It flew out to Brian and that was that". John Snow became a national hero and until 1973 was England's premier fast bowler and a regular player in the England Test team. This Test was the first of a run of 40 with only one defeat in 1966–71, of which Snow played 32. There was no tour in 1966–67 and in the summer of 1967 he took 13 wickets (30.00) against India and Pakistan, but missed the last two tests because of an inflammation of his sacroiliac joint.|$|E
