5|$|In 1792 {{over the}} 25 {{days of the}} first {{landfall}} in Recherche Bay, Tasmania, Delahaye established a European vegetable garden. Its purpose was {{as a source of}} food and propagation material for the indigenous people, and also as a supply of provisions for future visiting European vessels. This was the first European garden on mainland Tasmania, planted just north of where the ships were anchored and, until recently, was last sighted by Lady Jane Franklin in the 1840s. Offshore, on Bruny Island, a small orchard had been planted a few months previously by Englishman William Bligh's expedition, presumably planted by Bligh's gardener David Nelson. Delahaye's journal reports that he planted celery, chervil, chicory, cabbages, grey romaine lettuce, different kinds of turnip, white onion, radishes, sorrel, peas, <b>black</b> <b>salsify</b> and potatoes; he also had large quantities sewn in the woods, thrown at random where they might grow. Returning on 21 January 1793 the garden had not been productive, the seed having been planted in dry and sandy soil. This time Delahaye tried explaining to the Aboriginal people, referred to today as the Lyluequonny, that the tubers, when cooked in fire embers, made fine eating. Calling in on the Adventure Bay side of Bruny Island Delahaye examined and tended the two pomegranate, one quince and three fig trees planted by Bligh’s expedition in 1792.|$|E

50|$|They are {{distributed}} in Europe, Asia, and Africa. Its center of diversity {{is in the}} Mediterranean. Well-known species include the edible <b>black</b> <b>salsify</b> (Scorzonera hispanica). Scorzonera tau-saghyz {{is a source of}} natural rubber.|$|E
50|$|This {{organism}} causes {{white rust}} or white blister diseases in above-ground plant tissues. While these organisms affect {{many types of}} plants, the destructive aspect of infection {{is limited to a}} few agricultural crops, including: beets (garden and sugar), Brussels sprouts, cabbages, Chinese cabbage, cauliflower, collards, garden cress, kale, lettuce, mustards, parsnip, radish, horseradish, rape, <b>salsify</b> (<b>black</b> or white), spinach, sweet potatoes, turnips, watercress, and perhaps water-spinach.|$|R
5000|$|The {{vegetable}} called salsify {{is usually}} {{the root of the}} purple salsify, Tragopogon porrifolius; the root is described as having the taste of oysters (hence the alternative common name [...] "oyster plant" [...] for some species in this genus), but more insipid with a touch of sweetness. The young shoots of purple salsify can also be eaten, as well as young leaves http://www.northernbushcraft.com/plants/salsify/notes.htm. Other species are also used in the same way, including the <b>black</b> or Spanish <b>salsify,</b> Scorzonera hispanica, which is closely related though {{not a member of the}} genus Tragopogon.|$|R
50|$|The <b>black</b> <b>salsify</b> {{plant has}} heads of yellow ray flowers. The thin black taproot grows {{up to one}} meter long and up to 2 cm in diameter. It has a black skin with white {{internal}} flesh.|$|E
50|$|Skirret has {{a cluster}} of bright white, sweetish, {{somewhat}} aromatic roots, each approximately 15-20 cm in length. These are used as a vegetable {{in the same manner}} as the common salsify, <b>black</b> <b>salsify</b> and the parsnip.|$|E
50|$|The roots can {{be eaten}} raw or cooked like potatoes. They {{can be used}} from the young plant, from September until the first {{flowering}} stem is developed. If soaked in water and boiled the taste is similar to <b>black</b> <b>salsify</b> root.|$|E
50|$|<b>Black</b> <b>salsify</b> {{is often}} eaten {{together}} with other vegetables, such as peas and carrots. But it is also popular served like asparagus in a white sauce, such as bechamel sauce, mustard sauce or hollandaise sauce. Boiled salsify roots may also be coated with batter and deep fried.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>black</b> <b>salsify</b> is {{considered}} nutritious: it contains proteins, fats, asparagine, choline, laevulin, {{as well as}} minerals such as potassium, calcium, phosphorus, iron, sodium, and vitamins A, B1, E and C. It also contains the polysaccharide inulin, conferring a mild sweetness that is suitable for diabetics [...]|$|E
5000|$|Meloidogyne chitwoodi is a plant {{pathogenic}} root-knot nematode {{that is a}} {{crop pest}} of potatoes, carrots, and <b>black</b> <b>salsify.</b> [...] Root-knot nematodes such as M. chitwoodi cause the production of root-knot galls when their larvae infect the plant's roots and capture nutrients stored in the roots.|$|E
5000|$|Tillage-based crops include potatoes, kale, beetroot, green beans, carrots, celeriac, onions, {{all kind}} of cabbages, Brussels sprouts, cauliflower, endive, spinach, Belgian endive, {{asparagus}} and lettuce. Recently some initiatives have been started to encourage interest in such [...] "forgotten" [...] vegetables as common purslane, medlars, parsnips, and <b>black</b> <b>salsify</b> ...|$|E
50|$|Scorzonera hispanica, <b>black</b> <b>salsify</b> or Spanish salsify, {{also known}} as black oyster plant, serpent root, viper's herb, viper's grass or simply scorzonera, is a {{perennial}} member of the genus Scorzonera in the sunflower family (Asteraceae), cultivated as a root vegetable {{in the same way}} as purple salsify (Tragopogon porrifolius), also in the sunflower family.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Black</b> <b>salsify</b> is {{native to}} Southern Europe and the Near East. As is {{indicated}} by its binomial name, it is generally thought to have spread {{to the rest of}} Europe from Spain, but the first mention of the vegetable by a Western writer came from Leonhard Rudolf, who reported seeing scorzonera at the market of Aleppo in Syria, in 1575. Although it is often claimed that the name of the genus Scorzonera probably derives from the Old French word scorzon, meaning snake (or [...] "adder" [...] to be exact), {{it is more likely that}} the name is derived from the Italian [...] "scorza negra" [...] meaning [...] "black bark"/"black peel" [...] and obviously indicating the dark brown to black skin of the root. The Celtic and Germanic peoples are believed to have eaten the <b>black</b> <b>salsify,</b> which was considered efficacious against the bubonic plague and snake bites until the 16th century. The plant was being cultivated as a vegetable in Italy and France by 1660 and, soon after, the Belgians were growing vast fields of it.|$|E
50|$|<b>Black</b> <b>salsify</b> is {{hitherto}} {{mainly a}} European crop. Belgium, France and the Netherlands are the world's largest producers of black salsify; significant amounts are also produced in Germany. In the latter country, 'Hoffmanns Schwarzer Pfahl' is a cultivar widely used by commercial growers, while 'Duplex' is popular among small-scale gardeners. Some other cultivars are widely available, {{but because it}} was rather a localized crop before being produced for a wider market there are comparatively few landraces.|$|E
50|$|Orvietan was a {{concoction}} of partially toxic herbs, wine, and dissolved honey, but {{existed in}} powdered form too (sold in lead boxes). Patrizia Catellani and Renzo Console analyzed 35 different recipes for mixing orvietan, published between 1655 and 1857. The number of ingredients varies from 9 to 57. The most frequent 26 ingredients are: garden angelica, healing wolfsbane, birthwort, bistort, sweet flag, Carline thistle, dittany, gentian, masterwort, <b>black</b> <b>salsify,</b> tormentil, valerian, blessed thistle, dittany of Crete, rue, germander, laurel berries, juniper berries, cinnamon, cloves, viper meat, {{and the two}} concoctions mithridate and theriac, as well as white wine and honey.|$|E
50|$|Each layer may {{consist of}} one or many vegetables, fishes, or seafoods. All recipes include boiled white fish, a lobster, green beans, celery, carrots, beets, and potatoes. Some {{authorities}} insist that <b>black</b> <b>salsify</b> is essential. Other seafoods and vegetables may also be included. Each ingredient is boiled separately, cut up, and seasoned with oil and vinegar. Each layer is dressed {{with a sort of}} cross between salsa verde and mayonnaise; it consists of parsley, garlic, capers, anchovies, the yolks of hard-boiled eggs, and green olives ground together in a mortar with olive oil and vinegar. The pyramid is topped with a lobster capped with its coral. The sides of the pyramid are garnished with green olives, botargo, capers, anchovy filets, crayfish, artichokes, and quartered hard-boiled eggs.|$|E

40|$|Scorzonera hispanica L. {{is a very}} {{interesting}} vegetable species. It is grown in Poland, Germany, Belgium, Netherlands, and other countries. Growing of <b>black</b> <b>salsify</b> in the Czech Republic is almost nonexistent. Due to its nutritional value and taste it is vegetable worthy of including into our diet. In terms of positive health effects of <b>black</b> <b>salsify,</b> it is important to accentuate high inulin content. This makes it suitable for diabetics, whose numbers are increasing nowadays. <b>Black</b> <b>salsify</b> can be widely used for food preparation. For the purpose of this bachelor thesis, there was a degustation arranged. Apparently, there is a demand for meals containing the <b>black</b> <b>salsify,</b> as well as <b>black</b> <b>salsify</b> by itself. We can certainly say that <b>black</b> <b>salsify</b> is perspective vegetable for Czech Republic, both for farmers and the food industry, partly for the pharmaceutical industry and, last but not least, for consumers. It is worthy to research new ways of <b>black</b> <b>salsify</b> use for the pharmaceutical industry as well as the development of methods and use of special mechanization for cultivation and harvesting simplification...|$|E
40|$|The {{vertical}} distribution of Pratylenchus penetrans was monitored in four fields cropped with maize, <b>black</b> <b>salsify,</b> carrot, or potato. Soil {{samples were collected}} at 21 -day intervals from May 2002 until April 2003 from five plots (2 × 5 m(^ 2)) per field. Per plot, 15 cores were taken {{to a depth of}} 70 cm and split into seven segments of 10 cm each. Within the plots, segments from corresponding depths were pooled. After mixing, 200 -g subsamples were taken and nematodes were extracted by zonal centrifugation from the root fraction and the mineral soil fraction separately. In most crops, the root fraction contained more than 50 % {{of the total number of}} P. penetrans. Because the ratio between the numbers of nematodes in the root fraction and mineral soil fraction changes during the growing season, numbers of P. penetrans found in the mineral soil fraction cannot be used to estimate the total number in the soil. Therefore, both fractions have to be processed to obtain a reliable estimate of the density. No nematodes were recovered below 50 cm soil depth, except in the maize field where nematodes were found at 70 cm. The optimum sampling depth for maize, <b>black</b> <b>salsify,</b> carrot, and potato was 45, 25, 25, and 35 cm, respectively. The percentage of nematodes per soil layer was independent of the sampling date, indicating that a defined optimum sampling depth will be applicable throughout all seasons. The cumulative {{vertical distribution}}, modeled with a logistic equation, can be used to estimate the sampling error when samples are collected at different depth...|$|E
40|$|The SUNNIVA project aims to {{increase}} the overall sustainability of vegetable processing by providing valorisation strategies to reduce waste and limiting environmental impact, while improving the nutritional properties of vegetable food products. Results obtained during the first project year indicate that; (i) The waste and by-product fractions of cabbage, tomato and <b>black</b> <b>salsify</b> have a great potential to be better utilized in the food processing chain and to serve as valuable sources for health beneficial phytochemicals (HBPC), and (ii) that tomato and grape seed press cakes have an interesting plant nutritional (NPK) profile, which makes them suitable candidates as raw material in soil amendments. Further, raw materials from tomato and cabbage, in terms of cultivars and morphological parts, has been assessed for HBPC and nutritional value as an effect of N-fertilization and processing. Experimental data for deriving numerical thermal models for agitated and static retort are obtained. Mapping {{of the most important}} underutilized vegetable biomass streams in partnering countries are under way. The development of non-destructive tools for rapid HBPC measurements in cabbage and tomato is promising, but some more calibration/validation of the method is necessary. One year into the 3 -year project, we conclude that progress has been satisfactory...|$|E
40|$|Soil loss due to crop {{harvesting}} (SLCH) is a {{soil erosion}} process that occurs during {{the harvest of}} crops such as sugar beet, potato, chicory root, carrot and <b>black</b> <b>salsify.</b> Soil adhering to these crops and loose soil are harvested and exported from the field together with these crops, which consequently leads to lowering of the soil profile. Some studies report on the intensities and determining factors of SLCH for sugar beet and chicory roots. Only few studies, however, tried to estimate SLCH values for potato and no studies were found that investigated the determining factors of SLCH for this crop, although potato is, from an a real point of view, the most important crop in Europe and the Russian Federation and {{the second most important}} crop in the world leading to SLCH. This study tried to fill this knowledge gap by conducting field measurements (n = 51) on potato harvesting machines on 29 field plots located in central and northern Belgium, with soil textures ranging from loamy sand to silt loam. The main objectives of the study were to assess SLCH for potato and to get more insight into the factors determining the spatial and temporal variability in SLCH. As soil clods are sometimes selectively removed by people at the sorting table of the harvesting machine and as the processes leading to soil adhering to potatoes and to soil clods were expected to differ, total soil losses were divided into soil adhering to potatoes (adhering SLCH) and soil clods (loose SLCH). Total soil loss during potato harvest was on average 3. 2 Mg ha(- 1) harvest(- 1) and ranged from 0. 2 to 21. 4 Mg ha(- 1) harvest(- 1). The presence of soil clods induces the largest variability in total SLCH as adhering SLCH varied only between 0. 2 and 3. 6 Mg ha(- 1) harvest(- 1). About half of the variability in adhering SLCH could be explained by soil moisture content at harvesting time, while loose and total SLCH appeared to increase by increasing content of clay or particles < 16 mu m (R- 2 = 0. 27 for loose and +/- 0. 40 for total SLCH). Loose and total SLCH intensities are thus more difficult to predict than adhering SLCH, which is attributed to complex clod formation and destruction processes. No good multiple regression equations could be found due to strong interaction amongst the independent variables. SLCH for potatoes appeared to be lower than for sugar beet and chicory root, which can be attributed to crop morphology and planting of potatoes in ridges. (c) 2005 Elsevier B. V.
