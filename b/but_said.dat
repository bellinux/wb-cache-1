5|$|At {{the end of}} the 1962 season, Shaughnessy {{tendered}} {{his resignation}} with a year remaining on his contract. He expressed regret in his departure and admiration for Halas, <b>but</b> <b>said</b> that he felt {{it was time for a}} change.|$|E

5|$|American {{experts in}} {{military}} law {{agreed that the}} 1950 events violated {{the laws of war}} prohibiting targeting of noncombatants, <b>but</b> <b>said</b> that prosecuting ex-soldiers a half-century later was a practical impossibility. Nevertheless, Army Secretary Caldera said early in the investigation that he couldn't rule out prosecutions, a statement that survivors later complained may have deterred some 7th Cavalry veterans from testifying.|$|E
6000|$|... "Rude, <b>but</b> honest," [...] <b>said</b> Miss Fosbrook; and Susan's honest eyes twinkled, {{as much as}} to say, [...] "I like that;" [...] <b>but</b> she <b>said,</b> [...] "I don't believe Hal meant it." ...|$|R

5|$|Birmingham's fire {{department}} refused orders from Connor {{to turn the}} hoses on demonstrators again, and waded through {{the basement of the}} Sixteenth Street Baptist Church to clean up water from earlier fire-hose flooding. White business leaders met with protest organizers to try and arrange an economic solution <b>but</b> <b>said</b> they had no control over politics. Protest organizers disagreed, saying that business leaders were positioned to pressure political leaders.|$|E
5|$|DiBiase's only {{televised}} {{match in}} 2013 saw him defeat Michael McGillicutty on the May 9 episode of Superstars. On August 26, DiBiase {{announced that he}} was not renewing his WWE contract, which expired on September 1. DiBiase complimented his time with WWE, <b>but</b> <b>said</b> he wanted {{to spend more time with}} his family.|$|E
5|$|During the campaign, Old Court {{supporters}} again {{raised the}} issue of Sharp's seduction and abandonment of Anna Cooke. Old Court supporter John Upshaw Waring printed handbills that not only accused Sharp of fathering Cooke's child, <b>but</b> <b>said</b> that Sharp had denied paternity of the child {{on the grounds that it}} was a mulatto and the son of a Cooke family slave. Whether Sharp made such a claim has never been determined. Despite the allegations, Sharp won the election.|$|E

5|$|Eurogamer {{noted the}} {{annoyance}} {{of returning to}} defend over 20 towns each with recurring zombie problems, <b>but</b> <b>said</b> that the game mechanic is never too bothersome and even appreciated its element of time management, {{similar to that of}} the Dead Rising game series. IGN thought that the lack of fast travel was an impediment. Reviewers also noted technical issues with moving Marston's character, especially when climbing ladders and outrunning zombies.|$|E
5|$|Fed up {{with the}} {{attitude}} {{that he had to}} prove himself in the NFL, McKay once drunkenly needled Don Shula by saying, “I think pro coaches should have to prove themselves by winning four national championships in the colleges”. He later admitted to having ruffled some feathers in the NFL, <b>but</b> <b>said,</b> “it wasn’t as if they didn’t deserve it”.|$|E
5|$|In March 2013, Network World tested eight {{social media}} {{management}} tools. The reviewer found that Viralheat {{was the lowest}} cost, and supported more social media sites than competitors, but lacked the features to support multi-user accounts needed for large (enterprise) customers. The reviewer also praised Viralheat for its user interface and easy cross-posting across different social networks, <b>but</b> <b>said</b> its reporting and analytics were limited. For example, only three date-ranges could be selected when generating a report.|$|E

5|$|The {{game was}} {{positively}} received by reviewers and won two awards at the 2010 GDC Independent Games Festival. Reviewers praised the cooperative gameplay highly <b>but</b> <b>said</b> that the single-player was less fun {{because there was}} less to do. Many comparisons were made between Monaco and other media; the most common being the 1960 heist film Oceans 11. Reviewers liked the art style {{and said that the}} gameplay suited the minimalistic design.|$|E
5|$|After {{four years}} as Hershey's {{assistant}} coach, Mann accepted a job as head coach of ECHL's Bakersfield Condors on June 21. Mann had reinterviewed for his position with the Bears and felt it went well, <b>but</b> <b>said</b> he faced a deadline to accept the Bakersfield job and could not turn it down. Ryan Mougenel was signed as Mann's replacement on July 5. He had previously worked with Haviland, when Mougenel was alternate captain on and Haviland was {{head coach of the}} ECHL's Atlantic City Boardwalk Bullies in 2002–03, the year the team won the Kelly Cup.|$|E
5|$|An English fan {{translation}} of Ace Attorney Investigations 2, subtitled Prosecutor's Path, has been developed, and includes localized names for new {{characters in the}} style of Capcom's Ace Attorney localizations. The translation project was done on the Ace Attorney fan site Court-Records, where a user asked people who were interested in the project to send in applications, which had to be approved for them {{to become part of the}} project. Alexa Ray Corriea at Polygon described this approach as uncommon, with most fan translation projects letting anyone help if they want, <b>but</b> <b>said</b> that it made the project more professional. A patch translating the game's first two episodes was released in 2013, and a complete patch for the game was released in 2014. A final patch was later released in 2015.|$|E

5|$|Bayliss's counsel, Rufus Isaacs, called Starling as {{his first}} witness. Starling {{admitted}} that he had broken the law by using the dog twice, <b>but</b> <b>said</b> that he had done so to avoid sacrificing two dogs. Bayliss testified that the dog had been given one-and-a-half grains of morphia earlier in the day, then six ounces of alcohol, chloroform and ether, delivered from an ante room to a tube connected to the dog's trachea. Bayliss said the tubes were fragile, and that had the dog been struggling they would have broken.|$|E
5|$|Chandler {{was found}} guilty of the murders, and was sentenced to death on November 4, 1994. He {{maintained}} his innocence, and continued to pursue legal appeals while on Florida's Death Row. He admitted to the Madeira Beach incident <b>but</b> <b>said</b> the sex was consensual, and that the victim changed her mind during the act. Since Chandler had already been sentenced to death for the Rogers family murders, and prosecutors did not want to subject Blair to the emotional trauma of a rape trial, he was never prosecuted for Blair's rape.|$|E
5|$|Diệm's {{officials}} {{gave the}} Americans an unsubtle warning not to interfere. The official prosecutor {{claimed to have}} documents proving that a foreign power was behind the failed coup <b>but</b> <b>said</b> {{that he could not}} publicly name the nation in question. It was later revealed in secret proceedings that he pinpointed two Americans: George Carver, an employee of the United States Operations Mission (an economic mission) who was later revealed to be a CIA agent, and Howard C. Elting, described as the deputy chief of the American mission in Saigon.|$|E

5|$|He {{also promised}} to seek income tax law changes {{that he said}} would help to lower federal deficits and would stimulate {{economic}} growth. These included: reducing individual income tax rates across the board by 20percent, maintaining the Bush administration-era tax rate of 15percent on investment income from dividends and capital gains (and eliminating this tax entirely for those with annual incomes less than $200,000), cutting the top tax rate on corporations from 35 to 25percent, and eliminating the estate tax and the Alternative Minimum Tax. He promised {{that the loss of}} government revenue from these tax cuts would be offset by closing loopholes and placing limits on tax deductions and credits available to taxpayers with the highest incomes, <b>but</b> <b>said</b> that that aspect of the plan could not yet be evaluated because details would have to be worked out with Congress.|$|E
5|$|He used actors {{of diverse}} backgrounds, from famous film stars {{to people who}} {{had never seen a}} film (as in Aparajito). Robin Wood and others have lauded him as the best {{director}} of children, pointing out memorable performances in the roles of Apu and Durga (Pather Panchali), Ratan (Postmaster) and Mukul (Sonar Kella). Depending on the talent or experience of the actor, Ray varied the intensity of his direction, from virtually nothing with actors such as Utpal Dutt, to using the actor as a puppet (Subir Banerjee as young Apu or Sharmila Tagore as Aparna). Actors who had worked for Ray praised his customary trust <b>but</b> <b>said</b> he could also treat incompetence with total contempt.|$|E
5|$|Hoping {{to attract}} a {{proposed}} ZAP electric vehicle manufacturing plant {{to the city of}} Franklin, Kentucky, Beshear issued an executive order permitting low-speed vehicles on many Kentucky roads in August 2008. The state also offered the company $48 million in tax incentives, contingent upon its delivering a promised 4,000 jobs. Construction of the proposed plant stalled, however, when GE Capital, a primary investor, pulled out of the project. ZAP officials maintained their intention to build the plant, <b>but</b> <b>said</b> they would also consider other states' proposals if they could not replace the $125 million commitment from GE.|$|E
