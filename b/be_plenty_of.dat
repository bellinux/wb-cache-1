25|$|Crickets are {{a common}} subject of children's books on nature and advice on keeping pet crickets are plentiful. An ideal home habitat for a cricket is a large {{transparent}} jar or a small terrarium {{with at least two}} inches of damp soil on the bottom. There must <b>be</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> shelter where the crickets can hide; children's books and industrial breeders recommend egg-crate shells. The top of the terrarium must be tightly covered with a lid or nylon mesh.|$|E

25|$|Juan Vives (1493–1540) {{proposed}} induction as {{the method}} of study and believed in the direct observation and investigation {{of the study of}} nature. His studies focus of humanistic learning, which opposed scholasticism and was influenced by a variety of sources including philosophy, psychology, politics, religion, and history. He {{was one of the first}} to emphasize that the location of the school is important to learning. He suggested that the school should be located away from disturbing noises; the air quality should be good and there should <b>be</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> food for the students and teachers. Vives emphasized the importance of understanding individual differences of the students and suggested practice as an important tool for learning.|$|E
25|$|The {{ruling is}} controversial. Representatives of the US ethanol {{industry}} complained that this rule overstates the {{environmental effects of}} corn ethanol, and also criticized the inclusion of indirect effects of land-use changes as an unfair penalty to home-made corn ethanol because deforestation {{in the developing world}} is being tied to US ethanol production. The initial reference value set for 2011 for LCFS means that Mid-west corn ethanol will not meet the California standard unless current carbon intensity is reduced. Oil industry representatives complained that there is a cost associated to the new standard, as the LCFS will limit the use of corn ethanol blended in gasoline, thus leaving oil refiners with few available and viable options, such as sugarcane ethanol from Brazil, but this option means paying costly U.S. import tariffs. CARB officials and environmentalists reject such scenario because they think there will <b>be</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> time and economic incentive to developed inexpensive biofuels, hydrogen-based fuels, even ethanol from such cellulosic materials, or new ways to make ethanol out of corn with a smaller carbon footprint.|$|E
25|$|Through {{much of the}} {{few minutes}} {{after the big bang}} during which {{nucleosynthesis}} could have occurred, the temperature was high enough that the mean energy per particle was greater than the binding energy of weakly bound deuterium; therefore any deuterium that was formed was immediately destroyed. This situation is known as the deuterium bottleneck. The bottleneck delayed formation of any helium-4 until the universe became cool enough to form deuterium (at about a temperature equivalent to 100 keV). At this point, there was a sudden burst of element formation (first deuterium, which immediately fused to helium). However, very shortly thereafter, at twenty minutes after the Big Bang, the universe became too cool for any further nuclear fusion and nucleosynthesis to occur. At this point, the elemental abundances were nearly fixed, with the only change as some of the radioactive products of big bang nucleosynthesis (such as tritium) decay. The deuterium bottleneck in the formation of helium, together with the lack of stable ways for helium to combine with hydrogen or with itself (there are no stable nuclei with mass numbers of five or eight) meant that an insignificant amount of carbon, or any elements heavier than carbon, formed in the Big Bang. These elements thus required formation in stars. At the same time, the failure of much nucleogenesis during the Big Bang ensured that there would <b>be</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> hydrogen in the later universe available to form long-lived stars, such as our Sun.|$|E

There will <b>be</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> time to argue about the film's (or films') political relevance or lack thereof, to call Soderbergh names for this or that historical omission, for this or that ideological error.

Entertainment Weekly notes that it [...] "show off Justin Bieber in an all-white suit and in a leather-jacket outfit. Ludacris appears for a guest-verse, indicating that this may all be a stealth prequel to Fast & Furious 6".

Nelson Piquet Jr. felt {{it would be a}} fast circuit because it was purpose-built for motor racing and other series had visited the track before. He described it as seeming like it would be slightly wider and easier along with relying less on driver skill and making competitive racing closer. Heidfeld stated that the track layout would mean the drivers would be challenged on electrical energy management and there would a high chance of a full course yellow flag being shown or a safety car being deployed because of the large amount of barriers lining the circuit. José María López, who raced on the track in the WTCC, said it would be [...] "tricky" [...] having been used to touring cars which require more space and it would feel wider with Formula E vehicles and there would <b>be</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> space for overtaking manoeuvres.|$|E

500|$|In {{developing}} the storyline {{of the series}} Featherstone said that [...] "the team took what was wonderful from [...] and then forgot about it, in the nicest possible way, and made their own show." [...] While working for the series, Richards worked with Hans Rosenfeldt, the Swedish writer who created The Bridge. Many aspects of the first episode are virtual copies of the first episode of the Scandinavian series, including: the female lead [...] "stripping unselfconsciously to her underwear in the office", the male lead's relationship with his teenage son, and the [...] "sleazy journalist [...] held captive in his own car with a ticking bomb", the last {{of which was a}} sequence Richards wanted to repeat in the remake. However, Richards said that as the series progressed and the drama unfolded the storylines would diverge from the original. Featherstone also noted there would <b>be</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> changes, saying that many had [...] "seen both , who feel that they get satisfaction because the characters go on different journeys and the actors all bring a whole new level of interest in it".|$|E
500|$|In January 1973, Representative Richard C. White {{introduced}} legislation for commemorative dollars and half {{dollars for the}} 1976 United States Bicentennial. [...] On June 6, Mint Director Mary Brooks testified before a congressional committee, and responding to concerns that only the two least-popular denominations would be changed, agreed to support the temporary redesign of the quarter as well. On October 18, 1973, President Richard Nixon signed legislation mandating a temporary redesign of the three denominations for all coins issued after July 4, 1975 and struck before January 1, 1977. [...] These pieces would bear the double date 1776–1976. [...] In addition to circulation pieces, Congress mandated that 45million Bicentennial coins be struck in 40%silver. [...] Fearful of creating low-mintage pieces which might be hoarded as the cent recently had been, thus creating a shortage of quarters, in December 1974 the Mint obtained congressional approval to continue striking 1974-dated quarters, half dollars and dollars until Bicentennial coinage began. [...] Accordingly, there are no 1975-dated quarters. Almost two billion Bicentennial quarters were struck, as the Mint sought to assure that there would <b>be</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> souvenirs of the anniversary. [...] The Mint sold the silver sets, in both uncirculated and proof, {{for more than a}} decade before ending sales at the end of 1986. [...] Jack L. Ahr's colonial drummer, which had appeared on the Bicentennial quarter, was replaced after 1976 by Flanagan's original reverse.|$|E
