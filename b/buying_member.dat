40|$|In the {{marketplace}} the salesperson is {{the eyes and}} ears of the company, an essential element in {{the success or failure}} of the business and in the perception of many customers the salesperson is the business. Primarily this thesis attempted to establish the criteria of Irish manufacturing sector <b>buying</b> centre <b>members</b> in selecting suppliers, the relative importance they attach to various sources of information in choosing between alternative products, their opinion of the essential qualities of a good salesperson and their rating of the Irish sales force on the basis of twenty two personal attributes and selling skills identified from the literature as being of particular importance. <b>Buying</b> centre <b>members</b> were classified as Professional Purchasers, and Other <b>Buying</b> Centre <b>Members,</b> made up of managing directors, production executives and production/design/maintenance engineers. Two independent samples (80 Professional Purchasers and 164 Other <b>Buying</b> Centre <b>Members)</b> were selected in order to establish whether or not a statistically significant difference existed between the opinions of the two classifications. Use of chi-square tests, t-tests and f-tests proved that, except in the case of a minority of minor issues, no such difference existed. This finding is contrary to the findings of much research cited in the literature. The research established that the essential qualities of a good salesperson from the perception of <b>buying</b> centre <b>members</b> are product knowledge, personal impression and customer understanding in that order. The most important criteria used in selecting a supplier are product quality, price and delivery and the most important source of information in selecting a new product is the salesperson. In addition the research further established that Irish salespeople are perceived by buyers as being in particular need of improvement in follow-up, sales call preparation, customer understanding, appreciation of buyers time and technical competence...|$|R

50|$|Cooperatives {{can exist}} {{both at the}} farmer end of food {{production}} and the consumer end. Farming cooperatives refer to arrangements where farmers pool resources, either to cultivate their crops or get their crops to market. Consumer cooperatives often refer to food cooperatives where <b>members</b> <b>buy</b> {{a share in the}} store. Co-operative grocery stores, unlike corporate grocery stores, are socially owned and thus surpluses cannot be taken from the store as profit. As a result, food co-ops do not work for profit, potentially keeping prices more cost representative. Other forms of cooperatives that have developed more recently include community-supported agriculture, where community <b>members</b> <b>buy</b> a share in a farm’s harvest, and may also be engaged in farm labour, operating at both the consumer and producer end of food systems. Garden sharing pairs individual landowners and food growers, while variations on this approach organize groups of food gardeners for mutual assistance.|$|R
