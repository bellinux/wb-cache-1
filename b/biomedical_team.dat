40|$|Human {{schistosomiasis}} is {{the second}} most prevalent parasitic disease in the tropics, and has a huge impact on public health and socio-economic development. It is estimated that 652 million people live at risk of infection and that 193 million people are actually infected. Of the 120 million symptomatic cases, 20 million are suffering from severe disease. At present, 85 % of all these cases are concentrated in sub-Saharan Africa and they cause an estimated morbidity burden of 3. 5 million disability adjusted live years (DALYs). Since the advent of safe, effective, single dose drugs, the emphasis in schistosomiasis control has been on morbidity control. Since praziquantel is active against all schistosome species and has become relatively inexpensive, it is used as the drug of choice. For effective control of schistosomiasis, it is now of central importance to make the drug available to the communities at highest risk of infection. The distribution of schistosomiasis is extremely focal and since resources for health are seriously limited in most schistosomiasis endemic countries, there is a great need to identify high risk communities, so that resources can be better allocated. Due to the focal nature of the disease, neighbouring villages often show different patterns of schistosomiasis morbidity, resulting in large inter-village variation in perceived disease and actual public health importance. A simple procedure using questionnaires has been developed for rapid screening for Schistosoma haematobium infection and it proved to be reliable, non-intrusive and highly cost-effective in 8 African countries. Based on these experiences, WHO published guidelines for district health managers {{to be used as a}} first stage in the process of schistosomiasis control. Côte d’Ivoire is now the first country, that has taken advantage of these guidelines and translated them into direct application. In a first step, the feasibility and diagnostic performance of the questionnaire was rigorously validated in an S. haematobium endemic area in central Côte d’Ivoire. Correctly completed questionnaires were obtained from 124 schools (return rate: 91 %), with 12, 479 children interviewed. Following, previously trained teachers screened 5, 959 children with reagent sticks. The questionnaire showed a good diagnostic performance with sensitivity and specificity values between 79 % and 96 % to detect correctly those schools where the pupils were at high risk of infection. These findings were in agreement with previous studies from other African countries, and the questionnaire approach was recommended for use at the national level. At present, the questionnaires are already being applied in 5 out of 16 districts. The active involvement of University students in distributing and collecting questionnaires in this survey, is a promising innovative approach. Based on the excellent performance of questionnaires for rapid screening of S. haematobium and linked to the ongoing process in Côte d’Ivoire, there was a demand asking for support with implementing this technique also in the Niger State of north-western Nigeria. Questionnaires were returned from 58 schools (return rate: 97 %). A total of 3, 033 children were interviewed and 2, 479 children were screened with reagent sticks by previously trained teachers. Questionnaires also proved to be reliable in this setting, and identified schools at high risk of S. haematobium with sensitivity and specificity values ranging between 64 % and 96 %. The identification of high risk communities is an important component in the management and implementation of cost-effective schistosomiasis control programmes. For S. mansoni infection, reliable rapid methods have not yet been developed. Therefore possible ways of extending the questionnaire method for S. mansoni were assessed in Côte d’Ivoire. In a first study, perceived signs and symptoms for intestinal morbidity were assessed in focus group discussions with schoolchildren in an area highly endemic for S. mansoni. The most frequently perceived signs and symptoms were then used in a preliminary questionnaire in three schools. Comparison of the results with levels of S. mansoni infection revealed that reported blood in stool was the most reliable symptom to predict an infection (adjusted odds ratio: 2. 87; 95 % confidence interval (CI) : 1. 56 - 5. 31). Based on these findings, a questionnaire was developed and distributed to 134 schools. Correctly filled-in questionnaires were returned from 121 schools (90 %), with 12, 227 children interviewed. 5, 047 children were screened by a <b>biomedical</b> <b>team</b> with two consecutive Kato- Katz thick smears. For an individual diagnosis, the two symptoms “blood in stool” and “bloody diarrhoea” were significantly correlated with an S. mansoni infection: adjusted odds ratio 1. 59 (95 % CI: 1. 38 - 1. 83) and 1. 34 (95 % CI: 1. 14 - 1. 58), respectively. For community diagnosis, these two symptoms showed a high sensitivity (88 %) and a moderate specificity (58 %). Subsequently, it was assessed whether the diagnostic performance of the questionnaire could be improved by asking questions about water contact patterns. Although a positive response to a particular water contact pattern correlated significantly with an infection with S. mansoni, the diagnostic performance was again only moderate. In view of these findings, it was concluded that there is still a considerable amount of research needed before questionnaires can be adopted as a tool to screen for S. mansoni at the community level. Morbidity control in schistosomiasis requires effective initial treatment and the prevention of re-infection. In view of recent concern that praziquantel-tolerance/resistance might develop, there is a great need for research and development of novel substances with antischistosomal properties. Artemether has been identified in China as a promising product for early treatment and prophylaxis. It showed prophylactic effects in animals experimentally infected with S. japonicum, and was a successful prophylactic agent in humans exposed to S. japonicum. Further laboratory experiments showed a prophylactic effect also against S. mansoni. We conducted the first randomised double-blind placebo-controlled trial of oral artemether to prevent S. mansoni infections. 354 schoolchildren were enrolled. Stool samples were examined over four consecutive days, followed by two mass treatments with praziquantel four weeks apart. All S. mansoni negative children were randomly assigned to receive 6 repeated doses of a placebo (n= 151) or artemether (n= 138) at a dose of 6 mg/kg, spaced by 3 weeks. At the end of the study, the incidence and mean intensity of S. mansoni infection were assessed by examining four consecutive stool samples from the children. The group that received artemether had a significantly lower incidence of S. mansoni infection (31 / 128 vs. 68 / 140, relative risk: 0. 50, 95 % CI: 0. 35 - 0. 71, p< 0. 001). Furthermore, the geometric mean egg output among positive children in the artemether group (19 eggs/g stool) was significantly lower than in placebo recipients (32 eggs/g, p= 0. 017). Oral artemether was found to be safe and no adverse events occurred. Since artemether is already widely and effectively used against malaria, the use of artemether against schistosomiasis should not be recommended for widespread application in areas where malaria is endemic because of the potential risk of developing drug resistance in the malaria parasite. However, the use of artemether might contribute to a more effective schistosomiasis control in particular epidemiological settings. The findings of the present investigations clearly contributed to means of rapid identification of high risk areas of urinary and intestinal schistosomiasis in general and to the development and management of a national schistosomiasis control programme in Côte d’Ivoire in particular. We are optimistic that in the years to come considerable progress will be seen with the use of artemether (and hopefully also other drugs yet to be discovered) and that these products will take a promising place in a comprehensive strategy for schistosomiasis control...|$|E

40|$|Background: Librarians conduct {{research}} {{to better understand}} the communities they serve and to develop new services. For librarians in rapidly evolving dataintensive settings, research is especially crucial. However, librarians regularly encounter obstacles that stymie their abilities to complete necessary research projects. To address these barriers, librarian researchers at Loyola Marymount University developed The Institute for Research Design in Librarianship (IRDL). Setting/Participants: In June 2014, a data librarian (D. B.) was accepted into the inaugural class of scholars attending the IRDL in Los Angeles, CA. During IRDL, scholars received training in research processes, including topics surrounding the formation of research questions, qualitative and quantitative research methodology, as well as mixed-methods research. Purpose: Using the skills and network acquired during the IRDL, library researchers have been able to pursue studies for which they previously had little support. One such study is a protocol designed by a data librarian (D. B.) at Weill Cornell Medical College to assess perceptions of data literacy competencies and socio-technical barriers impeding data literacy and data management practices among <b>biomedical</b> research <b>teams.</b> The study makes use of a novel interview protocol designed to rapidly assess these issues and their impact on research data workflows. The Weill Cornell Medical College Institutional Review Board has approved this library study. Conclusion: Participation in the IRDL has been instrumental in facilitating the execution of research aimed at examining socio-technical barriers impeding data literacy and hindering data management practices among <b>biomedical</b> research <b>teams</b> at academic medical centers...|$|R

40|$|During {{the period}} 15 September 1968 to 14 December 1968, the NASA {{supported}} <b>Biomedical</b> Application <b>Team</b> at the Research Triangle Institute has identified 6 new problems, performed significant activities on 15 {{of the active}} problems identified previously, performed 5 computer searches of the NASA aerospace literature, and maintained one current awareness search. As a partial result of these activities, one technology transfer was accomplished. As a part of continuing problem review, 13 problems were classified inactive. Activities during the quarter involved all phases of team activity with respect to biomedical problems. As has been observed in preceding years, it has been exceedingly difficult to arrange meetings with medical investigators during {{the fourth quarter of}} the calendar year. This is a result of a combination of factors. Teaching requirements, submission of grant applications and holidays are the most significant factors involved. As a result, the numbers of new problems identified and of transfers and potential transfers are relatively low during this quarter. Most of our activities have thus been directed toward obtaining information related to problems already identified. Consequently, during the next quarter we will follow up on these activities with the expectation that transfers will be accomplished on a number of them. In addition, the normal availability of researchers to the team is expected to be restored during this quarter, permitting an increase in new problem identification activities as well as follow-up with other researchers on old problems. Another activity scheduled for the next quarter is consultation with several interested biomedical equipment manufacturers to explore means of effective interaction between the <b>Biomedical</b> Application <b>Team</b> and these companies...|$|R

40|$|In the United States, {{more than}} 12, 000 homes of deaf people are {{equipped}} with a system that enables the deaf to communicate by telephone. It consists of a teletype machine hooked up to an "acoustic coupler. " The deaf person taps out {{a message on the}} teletype keyboard and the acoustic coupler converts teletype pulses into audio signals that can be sent over phone lines. At the other end, another coupler reconverts the signals to activate the teletype's printer and provide a readable message. Though a boon to the deaf, the system presents a problem when something goes wrong. It is difficult to pinpoint the trouble because of the multiple units involved-the teletype's keyboard or its printer, the coupler's sending circuit or its receiving circuit. Finding the trouble is time-consuming and it usually involves removing the equipment from service, leaving the deaf person temporarily without communication.

40|$|Researchers {{need to be}} able to take {{advantage}} of the torrents of data being produced by computational tools, making it imperative that libraries contribute to data literacy as part of their mission to facilitate knowledge creation and innovation among their patrons. However, determining what data services should be and accessing the effectiveness of those services are new challenges. In order to offer meaningful, effective services and resources, librarians must assess how their patrons value data literacy skills and the note the language researchers use in discussing these issues. Without this, data librarians will be unable to adequately address the needs of their communities. Instruments currently exist to examine data literacy and data curation practices in academic settings. However, the application of such instruments in biomedical research settings is cumbersome [...] often times requiring lengthy interviews and worksheets that take many hours and multiple meetings to administer. Additionally, these tools do not aim to probe for information about socio-technical issues impacting data practices. Furthermore, no validated protocols yet exist that overtly address how perceptions and data practices among members of research teams conflict. Therefore, a new assessment tool was developed by the authors. This interview guide, is being administered at Weill Cornell Medical College to enable rapid assessment of perceptions surrounding data literacy competencies, socio-technical issues impacting data management practices, and data-related language used among <b>biomedical</b> research <b>teams...</b>|$|R
