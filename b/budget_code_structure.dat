40|$|Abstract—To {{make the}} {{implementation}} of high-rate STBC realistic in practical systems, group-decodable and fast-decodable <b>code</b> <b>structures</b> have been separately introduced into STBC to reduce the sphere decoding complexity. However, no STBC has both the two <b>code</b> <b>structures</b> until now. In this paper, high-rate fast-group-decodable STBC (FGD-STBC, which has both fastdecodable and group-decodable <b>code</b> <b>structures)</b> is proposed for the first time. We first derive the condition for fast-decodable <b>code</b> <b>structure</b> with the lowest sphere decoding complexity, then we prove that such fast-decodable <b>code</b> <b>structure</b> can be integrated with the group-decodable STBC for FGD-STBC construction. Analysis and simulation show that the proposed FGD-STBC has much lower decoding complexity and comparable performance with the existing fast-decodable STBC (FD-STBC). I...|$|R
40|$|This article clarifies the {{institutional}} framework {{and practice of}} the state budget compilation process in Russia, taking the 2001 federal budget as an example. The budget {{was the first one}} compiled under the new national financial system, including the <b>Budget</b> <b>Code</b> of the Russian Federation, which came into force in January 2000. The <b>Budget</b> <b>Code</b> is greatly superior to the preceding one, in the socialist era, which regulated Russia's financial activities during the initial phase of the transition period. Under the new legal system the 2001 budget was drafted by the Ministry of Finance, approved by the government, submitted to the Federal Assembly, discussed at the State Duma and finally approved by the Federation Council. A detailed analysis of this process shows that a certain order is emerging in the budget compilation process due to the comparatively amicable relationship {{between the government and the}} Federal Assembly and because of the establishment of the new legal system, including the <b>Budget</b> <b>Code.</b> The new financial system, however, has many problems, indicating that Russia will not be able to accomplish institutional changes in this field all at once. ...|$|R

It has four function modules: <b>code</b> <b>structure</b> design, <b>code</b> segment & bit design, visual coding and interpreting, code query. Firstly, code rules are expressed by extendable XML format as data <b>structure.</b> Secondly, <b>code</b> design is regulated into two stages: <b>code</b> <b>structure</b> design and <b>code</b> segment design, {{so as to}} realize separation of <b>code</b> <b>structure</b> logical and contents. finally, <b>code</b> segment <b>structure</b> information is described as graphic nodes, using interactive graphics drawing for visual modeling, finite state machine algorithm are used implementing <b>code</b> <b>structure</b> interpreter...|$|R

40|$|The {{antibacterial}} {{effect of}} the presence of Tilapia hornorum against luminous bacteria in shrimp culture has been reported. This study investigates how the presence of commercially valued marine species such as seabass, snapper and siganid affect the growth of luminous bacteria in shrimp culture water. Results showed that luminous bacterial count of water stocked with seabass, siganid and snapper are significantly lower than those without fish. Therefore this study has demonstrated that seabass, siganid and snapper are alternative species for culture with shrimp to control or inhibit the growth of luminous bacteria in shrimp ponds.

For example, USSGL account number 1010 will become USSGL account number code 101000. Agencies must not modify these six-digit USSGL account number codes. For agency-specific reporting needs, individual agencies may add a two-digit USSGL account extension code that will not be standardized in the USSGL. Use of the two-digit USSGL account extension code is at the discretion of the agency. By fiscal 2013, agencies must provide Treasury central reporting data using the new USSGL account number <b>code</b> <b>structure.</b> The change in the USSGL account number <b>code</b> <b>structure</b> applies throughout the entire TFM.
