The APPO has made his resignation or removal their one non-negotiable demand before they will agree to end the conflict.|$|E
25|$|In January 2008, Swiss {{economics}} magazine Bilanz, {{a subsidiary}} of Groupe Edipresse, published an interview with Le Rosey Director-General Philippe Gudin that revealed the school is seeking to sell its Gstaad winter campus and build a new campus in another location. Gudin is in negotiations with the local authorities in Schönried, a suburb of Gstaad located a few minutes away, to construct a new main campus on an undeveloped piece of land, but has run into difficulties due to zoning restrictions. Reasons for moving to a new campus, according to the Director-General, include {{the fact that the}} school's personnel, who typically live on campus, are at maximum capacity, and that the student body can no longer increase in size {{due to the lack of}} space. Gudin stated that for the moment the new winter campus location will be in Switzerland, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> ruled out the French Alps. The 100,000m² (approximately 25 acres) of prime real estate that the school occupies on Ried Hill in the centre of Gstaad is estimated to be worth several hundreds of millions of USD, considering the International Herald Tribune reports that the price per square meter in Gstaad starts at 20,000 CHF (19,000 US$) and can rise to 45,000 CHF (43,000 US$). Gudin asserts that the high value of the Gstaad winter campus has nothing to do with its planned sale.|$|E

They run into a problem when Tracy cannot remember much about his own life, and turn to English Wikipedia for the answers. They work non-stop on the project, until Tracy remembers that there never was an actual publisher for the book, thus shutting the project down.|$|E
500|$|Wisden Cricketers' Almanack {{recorded}} {{that his}} batting, while highly unorthodox in technique, {{could be very}} effective {{when he was in}} form. Wisden also noted that his bowling was fast. Several English players, including Jack Hobbs, singled out Constantine as an unusually talented cricketer on the strength of his performances in 1923. Pelham Warner, a former England captain and influential journalist and administrator, described Constantine after the tour as the best fielder in the world; his fielding was also praised by the press and in the pages of Wisden. James later wrote: [...] "He is a success, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> set the Thames on fire, and, what is more, he hasn't tried to." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{greatest}} {{criticism of}} Youth and Pleasure came from The Morning Chronicle, a newspaper which had long disliked Etty's female nudes.

He is a laborious draughtsman, and a beautiful colourist; <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> taste or chastity of mind enough to venture on the naked truth."

500|$|After {{graduating from}} Drake, McGugin {{enrolled}} {{in law school}} at the University of Michigan. While there, McGugin played college football for Fielding H. Yost. He was a player on Michigan's [...] "Point-a-Minute" [...] teams that outscored their opponents, 1,211 to 12 in 1901 and 1902, and served as Yost's assistant coach at Michigan in 1903. A profile of McGugin in the 1903 University of Michigan yearbook noted:McGugin is the lightest guard that Michigan has had {{in the last ten}} years, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> met his match during the past two seasons. ... As a guard he is careful yet nervy. [...] He gets the jump on his opponents and keeps the advantage. [...] Although a hard player he goes into each scrimmage with as much composure as if he were walking along the campus. [...] McGugin, although good in every department of his position, has two qualities that are pre-eminent: namely, making interference and opening holes. [...] Heston has been especially fortunate this year in having a good interference, and part of that interference has been McGugin.|$|E
500|$|Between 1820 and 1829 Etty {{exhibited}} 15 paintings, {{of which}} 14 depicted nude figures. While some nude paintings by foreign artists existed in private collections, England had no tradition of nude painting and the display {{and distribution of}} nude material to the public had been suppressed since the 1787 Proclamation for the Discouragement of Vice. Etty was the first British artist to specialise in the nude, and {{the reaction of the}} lower classes to these paintings caused concern throughout the 19th century. Although his portraits of male nudes were generally well received, many critics condemned his repeated depictions of female nudity as indecent. Etty's Youth on the Prow, and Pleasure at the Helm, completed in 1830 and exhibited in 1832, attracted scathing criticism for its supposed seductive and sensual nature, leading The Morning Chronicle to comment that [...] " [...] should not persist, with an unhallowed fancy, to pursue Nature to her holy recesses. He is a laborious draughtsman, and a beautiful colourist; <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> taste or chastity of mind enough to venture on the naked truth." ...|$|E
500|$|Ali Shadman {{is one of}} the few Kurdish people {{remaining}} in Baghdad. His family are struggling financially and resort to siphoning petrol from their car to run their back-up generator when the power grid fails. When the generator breaks down one night, Ali begins to wonder why he is fixing it against a backdrop of gunfire, instead of studying in peace. Another night, he reports the neighbourhood's news but explains there is nothing to speak of other than the usual explosions, violence, and death. Anmar Refat, a Syriac Christian, tries to remain philosophical and hopes that armed gangs will not attack the school. His family, however, are more nervous about any nearby gunfire, as their Christian beliefs increase the threat to their lives if anyone were to find out about them. Anmar has a girlfriend, whom he can contact only via his mobile phone, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> heard from her in several days, leaving him worried about whether she has found another boyfriend, or has been hurt in the violence. Hayder Khalid, a Shia Muslim, hopes to become a famous singer-songwriter. He frequently downloads music videos of English-language pop music so he can learn popular English songs and dance moves. Mohammad Raed, a Sunni Muslim, is the [...] at school, who prefers playing sports and fooling around with his friends to studying. Unaware of his behaviour at school, his mother believes he is hard-working, self-sufficient and mature, and believes he will graduate and go to university.|$|E

500|$|The [...] "Lucy poems" [...] {{have been}} parodied {{numerous}} times since their first publication. These were generally intended to ridicule the simplification of textual complexities and deliberate ambiguities in poetry. They also questioned {{the way many}} 19th-century critics sought to establish definitive readings. According to Jones, such parodies commented in a [...] "meta-critical" [...] manner and themselves present an alternative mode of criticism. Among the more notable is the one by Samuel Taylor Coleridge's son Hartley Coleridge (1796–1849), called [...] "On William Wordsworth" [...] or simply [...] "Imitation", as in the 1827 version published for The Inspector magazine ("He lived amidst th' untrodden ways / To Rydal Lake that lead; / A Bard whom there were none to praise / And very few to read" [...] lines 1–4). Parody also appears in the 1888 murder-mystery reading of the poem by Victorian author Samuel Butler (1835–1902). Butler believed Wordsworth's use of the phrase [...] "the difference to me!" [...] was overly terse, and remarked that the poet was [...] "most careful not to explain {{the nature of the}} difference which the death of Lucy will occasion him to be ... The superficial reader takes it that he is very sorry she was dead... <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> said this." [...] Not every work referring to the [...] "Lucy poems" [...] is intended to mock, however; the novelist and essayist Mary Shelley (1797–1851) drew upon the poems to comment on and re-imagine the Romantic portrayal of femininity.|$|E

The one constant has been the masterful use of great stylistic powers to organize and control his highly original and complex vision of life." ...|$|E

Federal Election Commission when he believed that he was compelled to do so, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> sought to extend its holding. [...] In Wagner v. Federal Election Commission (2015), Garland wrote for the unanimous en banc D.C.

Taylor (2009), Garland wrote for the court in a decision upholding the constitutionality of lobbyist disclosure requirements under the Honest Leadership and Open Government Act. Professor Rick Hasen, an election-law expert, writes that Garland's opinions on election law are characterized by careful application of precedent and indicate that Garland believes in reasonable regulation.|$|E
