40|$|This paper {{presents}} a data compaction/randomization based approach as {{a mode of}} block encryption for ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode) cells. The presented approach converts a plaintext into pseudo-random plaintext before ciphering to conceal patterns in the plaintext. The underlying idea behind this scheme is the Shannon's principles of "confusion" and "diffusion" which involve breaking dependencies and introducing as much randomness as possible into the ciphertext. In this scheme, confusion and diffusion are introduced into the system by first compressing the ATM cell payload and then spreading a continuously changing random data over the entire content of the cell. As a mode of operation for <b>block</b> <b>ciphering,</b> this scheme offers the following attractive features: (i) plaintext patterns are pseudo-randomized and chained with ciphertext (thereby, preventing against "dictionary", "known plaintext", and "statistical analysis" attacks), (ii) it is self-synchronizing, (iii) cell loss has no [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — This paper shows a {{symmetric}} image encryption {{based on}} bit-wise operation (XORing and Shifting). The basic idea is <b>block</b> <b>ciphering</b> (size of each block is 4 bytes) technique to cipher the secret bytes, after that ciphered bytes are again shuffled among N positions (N {{is the size}} of secret file). The scheme is combination of substitution as well as transposition techniques which provides additional protection of the secret data. The substitution and transposition are done using dynamic substitution box (SBOX) and transposition box (TBOX) which are generated using the secret key and made to vary for each block during ciphering. The size of encrypted data is same as the size of secret data and the proposed scheme has been tested using different images. We have also presented the security analysis such as key sensitivity analysis, statistical analysis, and differential analysis to prove the strength of our algorithm against crypto analysis.

To take benefit of workstealing, we propose in this paper a generic way to rewrite loops in a recursive way, involving three complemen-tary levels of parallelism.

40|$|Part 2 : 4 th International Workshop on Security and Cognitive Informatics for Homeland Defense (SeCIHD 2014) International audienceIn recent years, {{parallel}} computing capabilities {{have been more}} powerful than before. Consequently some block cipher standards, such as DES used to protect important electronic messages, have been cracked in the past years. Also due to the rapid development of hardware processing speeds, 3 DES and AES may someday be solved by brute-force attacks. Basically, the common characteristics of these block cipher standards are that each time, when a standard is invoked, the same parent key is used to generate subkeys. The subkeys are then utilized in the standard’s encryption rounds to encrypt data. In fact, the variability of the key values is quite limited. Generally, producing random parameters to encrypt data is an effective method to improve the security of ciphertext. But how to ensure the security level of using and delivering these random parameters and how to avoid information leakage have been a challenge. So in this paper, we propose a novel random parameter protection approach, called the Initialization Cipher Block Method(ICBM for short), which protects random parameters by using a two-dimensional operation and employs random parameters to change {{the value of a}} fixed parent key for <b>block</b> <b>ciphering,</b> thus lowering the security risk of a block cipher algorithm. Security analysis demonstrates that the ICBM effectively improve the security level of a protected system. Of course, this also safely protect our homeland, particularly when it is applied to our governmental document delivery systems...|$|E

This work introduces a new key generation technique {{that can be}} used for enhancing the design of block cipher encryption algorithms, especially for DES to increase its key space; to be applicable in sensitive applications. This is based on the use of biometric key using the voice of speakers, extracting important features as formants and pitch of the speakers because it is unique for each one; in addition it applies crossover operations of genetic algorithm on biometric key to permute it. Finally it combines between stream ciphering and <b>block</b> <b>ciphering</b> algorithms (encryption of the crossover-biometric key using the RC 4). The output Key-Stream bytes from the RC 4 is then introduced to the DES algorithm to obtain the target ciphertext. The paper introduces also the idea of generating multi biometric keys by using different crossover operation types based on a specific time-slice. The paper introduces also the different steps for generating the Biometric-Crossover-Stream Key. Moreover the proposed DES provided added complexity due to the generation of new biometric key than normal DES; it is small, and can be neglected if one considers the trade-off between security and the complexity of the algorithm especially for the critical systems. The paper introduces a comparison between the proposed biometric keys and weak and semiweak keys; the biometric generated keys were neither semiweak nor weak keys so the generated keys are possibly acceptable...|$|E

Most of the time, these modes of operation use a wide variety of techniques to achieve a subgoal necessary for their main goal: instantiation of “essentially different ” instances of the <b>block</b> <b>cipher.</b> We formalize a cryptographic primitive, the “tweakable <b>block</b> <b>cipher.</b> ” Such a cipher has not only the usual inputs—message and cryptographic key—but also a third input, the “tweak. ” The tweak serves much the same purpose that an initialization vector does for CBC mode or that a nonce does for OCB mode.
