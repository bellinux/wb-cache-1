5|$|Trees {{have been}} venerated since time immemorial. To the ancient Celts, certain trees, {{especially}} the oak, ash and thorn, held special significance as providing fuel, building materials, ornamental objects and weaponry. Other cultures have similarly revered trees, often linking {{the lives and}} fortunes of individuals to them or using them as oracles. In Greek mythology, dryads were believed to <b>be</b> <b>shy</b> nymphs who inhabited trees.|$|E
25|$|In {{recent years}} {{correlations}} between birth weight and shyness have been studied. Findings suggest that those born at low birth weights {{are more likely}} to <b>be</b> <b>shy,</b> risk-aversive and cautious compared to those born at normal birth weights. These results do not however imply a cause-and-effect relationship.|$|E
25|$|The Griffon Bruxellois {{is known}} to have a huge heart, and a strong desire to snuggle and be with its master. They display a visible air of self-importance. A Griffon should not <b>be</b> <b>shy</b> or aggressive, but they are very emotionally sensitive, and because of this, should be socialized {{carefully}} at a young age. Griffons should also be alert, inquisitive and interested in their surroundings.|$|E

25|$|In science, one of {{the most}} famous members of the Cypriniformes is the {{zebrafish}} (Danio rerio). The zebrafish is {{one of the}} most important vertebrate model organisms in biological and biochemical sciences, being used in many kinds of experiment. As, during early development, the zebrafish has a nearly transparent body, it is ideal for studying developmental biology. It is also used for the elucidation of biochemical signaling pathways. They are also good pets, but can <b>be</b> <b>shy</b> in bright light and crowded tanks.|$|E
25|$|The Kangal dog is calm, controlled, independent, {{powerful}} and protective. They may be aloof towards strangers, but a well-socialized Kangal Dog is friendly with visitors and especially children. They must never <b>be</b> <b>shy</b> or vicious. A well-trained Kangal is sensitive and alert to changing situations, responding to threats with judicious warnings and courageous action if necessary. They make good guardians of livestock and humans alike, {{but they may}} not be suitable for inexperienced dog owners, as the independent intelligence of the Kangal makes for a difficult pupil.|$|E
25|$|Globally, younger {{children}} are {{at greater risk}} from physical violence while older children are more likely to suffer from sexual violence. Boys are more at risk from physical violence than girls, while girls may face neglect and sexual violence. Patriarchal attitudes perpetuate women's inferior status and increase violence against women. Many of Ethiopia's different ethnic groups share a culture of patriarchal norms and values. Girls are socialized to <b>be</b> <b>shy</b> and obedient and not to speak in front of adults, particularly in front of men. The focus is on her future role as obedient wife and good mother.|$|E

50|$|If the {{individual}} <b>is</b> <b>shy</b> or bashful and appears nervous when talking, {{he or she}} is likely to exhibit nervous laughter. Individuals who <b>are</b> <b>shy</b> and introverted who find themselves the center of conversational attention often become “giddy” with nervous laughter; this is a subconscious response caused by the brain over-thinking due to social anxiety or inexperience.|$|R
25|$|The general {{appearance}} of the Sheltie {{is that of a}} miniature Rough Collie. They are a small, double coated, working dog, agile and sturdy. Blue merle Shelties may have blue eyes or one brown and one blue eye, but all others have dark colored eyes. Their expression should be that of alertness with a gentle and sometimes reserved nature. They are often very good with children. They carry their tail down low, only lifted when alert and never carried over the back. They are an intensely loyal breed, sometimes reserved with strangers but should not <b>be</b> <b>shy</b> or showing timidness as per the AKC breed standard.|$|E
25|$|Earth: The earth {{signs are}} Taurus, Virgo, and Capricorn. A native with mainly earth signs will be {{practical}} and cautious, sensible and capable {{and will be}} happier with concrete things than abstract ideas. They move slowly and carry out their work in a thorough and unhurried manner. Earth subjects are shrewd and careful and need emotional and material security, and will put up with quite {{a lot to get}} it. They are generous to those they love, but are otherwise careful not to waste time or money, though there can be a tendency towards meanness. Earth subjects tend to <b>be</b> <b>shy</b> in social situations, and to be slow to commit in love relationships, but are serious when they do. A subject lacking earth signs will lack common sense and practicality and find it difficult to finish anything they start. They may be scatty, unrealistic and clumsy, hopeless with money and unreliable. Planets in the 2nd, 6th and 10th houses and an emphasis on fixed signs in the chart will help to compensate for this lack.|$|E
25|$|Syed Qutb from a {{young age}} would save up his money for a man called Amsaalih, who used to sell books around the local villages. He would have a big {{collection}} of books, and another small collection specifically for Syed Qutb. If Syed never had the money, he would tell him that I don't have the money now, so let me borrow it and I'll give it you next time you come around. And Amsaalih would let him do that. At the age of 12, {{he had his own}} library collection of 25 books, even though books were really expensive during that time. He would imitate the scholars by reading the books, and then give lectures {{to the rest of the}} village. If any women needed any information, they would wait till Syed Qutb came back from school, and ask him to share the knowledge he had to them. In many occasions he would <b>be</b> <b>shy</b> because he was a young man, but in some occasions he would go and teach the knowledge he had to the people who asked him.|$|E

500|$|The song is midtempo, with {{supported}} by heavy bass beats produced by Polow da Don, which Prefix Magazine called [...] "Jurrasic Park synths". Chris Ryan of MTV News said [...] "Usher pairs off with current queen MC Nicki Minaj, {{and the two}} glide over Polow Da Don's minimal bass beat." [...] Sara D. Anderson of AOL Radio Blog said that the [...] "heavy back-beat tune confirms Usher's old ways: [...] "Yeah you the business / So What's the business / Don't <b>be</b> <b>shy,</b> I'm just talkin' to you girl." [...] Tom Breihan of Pitchfork Media called the heavily manipulated [...] "Living for the City" [...] sample, [...] "a monstrous swirl of orchestral exoticism". Minaj makes several puns in her lines, one of them referring to Santa Claus's reindeer in a runthrough which Prefix Magazine reviewed negatively. She also refers to P. Diddy and Cassie in her lines, that she's [...] "plotting on how I can take Cassie away from Diddy".|$|E
500|$|In the original, non-broadcast pilot, Willow {{was portrayed}} by Riff Regan. However, network {{executives}} requested that Regan be replaced. Willow's character demanded that she <b>be</b> <b>shy</b> and unsure of herself, and the casting department encountered some difficulty finding actresses who could portray this effectively {{and still be}} likable. After seven auditions, Alyson Hannigan was eventually chosen for the role. She was chosen {{for being able to}} spin the character's lines with a self-effacing optimism; she stated, [...] "I didn't want to do Willow as someone who's feeling sorry for herself. Especially in the first season, she couldn't talk to guys, and nobody liked her. I was like, 'I don't want to play somebody who's down on herself." [...] Whedon conceived the character as introverted, saying [...] "I wanted Willow {{to have that kind of}} insanely colorful interior life that truly shy people have. And Alyson has that. She definitely has a loopiness I found creeping into the way Willow talked, which was great. To an extent, all the actors conform to the way I write the character, but it really stands out in Willow's case." ...|$|E
500|$|David Sims of The A.V. Club graded {{the episode}} a 'B-', stating [...] "I've defended this show against {{complaints}} that it’s terminally bland, but formulaic material like this really does expose its flaws. It’s definitely not an unwatchably bad show ... In short: don’t <b>be</b> <b>shy,</b> Agents Of S.H.I.E.L.D. Show {{us what you}} can do." [...] He did praise the visual effects in the episode though, saying, [...] "This week’s episode {{had a couple of}} very nicely-staged set pieces and, especially for broadcast TV, some excellent special effects. Fire is hard to pull off, even in a blockbuster movie, but this episode revolved around a character ... who can generate and manipulate fire, and everything he did looked pretty cool." [...] Morgan Jeffrey at Digital Spy scored the episode 3 stars out of 5, calling it a [...] "slow burn", and concluding that [...] "Skye's arc is easily the weakest aspect of [...] "Girl in the Flower Dress" [...] but there's a decent villain and a strong climax to help compensate." [...] Will Salmon of SFX also scored the episode 3 stars out of 5, stating [...] "a shade more mature than the initial installments. It’s a welcome growth, and it does feel like Agents Of S.H.I.E.L.D. is getting itself together. They found the right levels of warmth and humanity last week, and humour and drama this time around. Now they just need to start going on some genuinely compelling missions against decent enemies." [...] Jim Steranko, known for his work on Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D., felt the series [...] "has settled into a pragmatic, if sometimes predictable comfort zone", and said that the episode [...] "delivered enough premise, pace, and patter to get its audience through a mellow hour — and set the bar higher {{for the rest of the}} season." ...|$|E

2500|$|Matsumoto is {{a self-proclaimed}} hyōi-geinin (憑依芸人). Hyōi means [...] "spiritual possession," [...] and geinin means [...] "entertainer."

Hyōi-geinin tend to <b>be</b> <b>shy</b> and uncomfortable with revealing their true character and find it hard to perform without hiding behind an outrageous personality or appearance. As such, the often silly and oafish Matsumoto is said to be more mild-mannered and serious off screen.|$|E

2500|$|Thomas shot {{dramatic}} {{footage of}} Lawrence and, after the war, toured the world, narrating his film With Allenby in Palestine and Lawrence in Arabia and making Lawrence—and himself—household names. The performances were highly dramatic. At {{the opening of}} Thomas's six-month London run, there were incense braziers, exotically dressed women dancing before images of the Pyramids, and the band of the Welsh Guards playing to provide the accompaniment. Lawrence saw the show several times; he later claimed to dislike it, but it generated valuable publicity for his own book. To strengthen the emphasis on Lawrence in the show, Thomas needed more photographs of him than Chase had taken in 1918. Lawrence claimed to <b>be</b> <b>shy</b> of publicity, but he agreed {{to a series of}} posed portraits in Arab dress in London. Thomas later said of Lawrence, [...] "He had a genius for backing into the limelight." ...|$|E
2500|$|From the {{beginning}} of her career until 1990, Graf regularly played doubles events in Grand Slams and other tournaments, winning a total of 11 titles. In 1986, she formed a partnership with rival Gabriela Sabatini. The pair was moderately successful, winning the 1988 Wimbledon Championships [...] together and reaching the finals of the French Open in 1986, 1987 and 1989. The partnership was the subject of much discussion, as the two women, both known to <b>be</b> <b>shy,</b> usually kept communication to a minimum during changeovers and between points, a highly unusual situation in doubles. Sabatini said of the partnership: [...] "doubles is all about communicating with each other, and we didn't communicate that much. We would just say the basic things, but nothing else." [...] The pair played their last major tournament together at the 1990 Wimbledon Championships, losing in the quarterfinals. From 1991 until the end of her career, Graf would only play doubles sporadically, forming short-term partnerships with a variety of players, including Lori McNeil, Anke Huber and her best friends on the tour, Rennae Stubbs, Patricia Tarabini and Ines Gorrochategui. She played her last Grand Slam doubles tournament at the 1999 Australian Open with Gorrochategui, losing in the second round.|$|E
2500|$|Buffy the Vampire Slayer (often {{simplified}} as Buffy) {{was originally}} conceived by Joss Whedon for a 1992 feature film. However, in its development Whedon felt it {{lost some of}} the quirkiness he considered was {{the heart of the}} project, and it was not received as well as he liked. He began to develop for television the concept of a fashion-conscious girl named Buffy, who is imbued with superhuman abilities and attends a high school situated on a portal to hell. Whedon created a group of friends for the main character, including Willow Rosenberg and Xander Harris. A half-hour pilot was filmed starring Riff Regan as Willow, but it was eventually left unaired and network executives requested that Regan be replaced. Willow's character demanded that she <b>be</b> <b>shy</b> and unsure of herself, and the casting department encountered some difficulty finding actors who could portray this effectively and still be likable.
