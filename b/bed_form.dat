40|$|Experiments to {{simulate}} the formation of aeolian <b>bed</b> <b>forms</b> on Venus show that a high-density atmosphere produces small transverse <b>bed</b> <b>forms</b> with dimensionless similarities to terrestrial dunes but with both dimensional and behavioral similarities to subaqueous current ripples.

40|$|PURPOSE: Large <b>bed</b> <b>forms,</b> such as dunes or sand waves, {{can pose}} a {{navigation}} hazard for inlet channels (Pope 2000). Understanding the conditions causing their formation {{can be an}} aid in navigation channel management. This Coastal and Hydraulics Engineer Technical Note (CHETN) is concerned with large <b>bed</b> <b>forms</b> that chronically or periodically encroach on the authorized navigation depth. Smaller <b>bed</b> <b>forms</b> have been observed in many (perhaps most) other inlets, but {{because they do not}} hinder navigation, they are not discussed in this CHETN. Navigation channels with reported sand waves include the Columbia River, WA/OR; East Pass, Panama City, Fort Pierce, and St. Marys Entrance, FL; Merrimack River, MA, and Kennebec River, ME. This technical note discusses the characteristics of the <b>bed</b> <b>forms</b> found in those areas and conditions responsible for their development. BACKGROUND: Large <b>bed</b> <b>forms,</b> as depicted in Figure 1, are called either sand waves or medium-to-large dunes. They have been documented to pose a navigation hazard if they extend about 1 m or higher above the channel floor (Ashley 1990; Boothroyd and Hubbard 1974). Although <b>bed</b> <b>forms</b> of various dimensions cover much of the seafloor, not all <b>bed</b> <b>forms</b> develop into sand waves.

With the relationship and the characteristics of <b>bed</b> <b>form</b> movement observed in the lower reach of Yellow River, a method to discriminate bed forms is established.

40|$|Two sets of flume {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} examine grain size selective transport and vertical sorting in conditions with migrating <b>bed</b> <b>forms</b> and <b>bed</b> load transport. In {{the two sets of}} experiments we used a sediment mixture from the river Rhine and a trimodal mixture, respectively. The vertical sorting profiles showed a downward coarsening trend within the <b>bed</b> <b>forms,</b> and in some experiments an essentially immobile coarse <b>bed</b> layer <b>formed</b> underneath the migrating <b>bed</b> <b>forms.</b> Three mechanisms contribute to the formation of such a coarse bed layer: (1) the avalanching process at the lee face, (2) conditions of partial transport in which a relatively large amount of coarse material does not participate in the transport process, and (3) the winnowing of fines from the trough surface and subsurface. The experiments show that vertical sorting fluxes not only occur through net degradation or aggradation but also through the migration of <b>bed</b> <b>forms</b> and through the variability in trough elevations. This is contradictory to the way vertical sorting processes are modeled in most existing sediment continuity models for nonuniform sediment.

40|$|Field and {{laboratory}} {{studies indicate that}} changes in riverbed morphology often lag changes in water discharge. This lagged response produces hysteresis {{in the relationship between}} water discharge and <b>bed</b> <b>form</b> geometry. To understand these phenomena, we performed flume experiments to observe the response of a sand bed to step increases and decreases in water discharge. For an abrupt rise in discharge, we observed that bed forms grew rapidly by collision and merger of bed forms migrating with different celerities. Growth rate slowed as bed forms approached equilibrium with the higher discharge regime. After an abrupt discharge drop, <b>bed</b> <b>form</b> decay occurred through formation of smaller secondary bed forms, in equilibrium with the lower discharge, which cannibalized the original, relict features. We present a simple model framework to quantitatively predict time scales of <b>bed</b> <b>form</b> adjustment to flow changes, based on equilibrium <b>bed</b> <b>form</b> heights, lengths, and celerities at low and high flows. For rising discharge, the model assumes that all <b>bed</b> <b>form</b> collisions result in irreversible merger, due to a dispersion of initial celerities. For falling discharge, we derive a diffusion model for the decay of relict high-stage features. Our models predict the form and time scale of experimental <b>bed</b> <b>form</b> adjustments. Additional experiments applying slow and fast triangular flood waves show that <b>bed</b> <b>form</b> hysteresis occurs only when the time scale of flow change is faster than the modeled (and measured) <b>bed</b> <b>form</b> adjustment time.

40|$|An {{idealized}} morphodynamic {{model is}} used to gain further understanding about the formation and characteristics of shoreface-connected sand ridges and tidal sand banks on the continental shelf. The model consists of the 2 D shallow water equations, supplemented with a sediment transport formulation and describes the initial feedback between currents and small amplitude <b>bed</b> <b>forms.</b> The behaviour of <b>bed</b> <b>forms</b> during both storm and fair weather conditions is analyzed. This is relevant in case of coastal seas characterized by tidal motion, where the latter causes continuous transport of sediment as bed load. The new aspects of this work are the incorporation of both steady and tidal currents (represented by an M 2 and M 4 component) in the external forcing, in combination with dominant suspended sediment transport during storms. The {{results indicate that the}} dynamics during storms and fair weather strongly differ, causing different types of <b>bed</b> <b>forms</b> to develop. Shoreface-connected sand ridges mainly form during storm conditions, whereas if fair weather conditions prevail the more offshore located tidal sand banks develop.

The modelling of river processes involves numerous uncertainties, resulting in uncertain model results. Knowledge of the type and magnitude of these uncertainties is crucial for a meaningful interpretation of the model results. Uncertainty in the hydraulic roughness due to bed forms {{is one of the}} main contributors to the uncertainty in the modelled water levels. The aim of this study was to quantify the uncertainty in the <b>bed</b> <b>form</b> roughness under design conditions and quantify the effect on the design water levels in the Dutch river Waal. Five roughness models that predict <b>bed</b> <b>form</b> roughness based on measured <b>bed</b> <b>form</b> and flow characteristics were extrapolated to design conditions. The results show that the 95 % confidence interval of the predicted Nikuradse roughness values under design conditions ranges from 0. 32 to 1. 03 [*]m. This uncertainty was propagated through the two-dimensional hydrodynamic model, WAQUA, by means of a Monte Carlo simulation for an idealized schematization of the Dutch river Waal. The uncertain <b>bed</b> <b>form</b> roughness results in an uncertainty in the design water levels, with a 95 % confidence interval of 0. 53 [*]m, which is significant for Dutch river management practice. The uncertainty in the <b>bed</b> <b>form</b> roughness was mainly caused by a lack of knowledge about the physical process of <b>bed</b> <b>form</b> evolution that causes roughness.

40|$|This paper uses {{particle}} imaging velocimetry {{to provide}} the first measurements detailing the flow field over a porous bed {{in the presence of}} <b>bed</b> <b>forms.</b> The results demonstrate that flow downstream of coarse-grained <b>bed</b> <b>forms</b> on permeable <b>beds</b> is fundamentally different to that over impermeable beds. Most significantly, the leeside flow separation cell is greatly modified by jets of fluid emerging from the subsurface, such that reattachment of the separated flow does not occur and the Reynolds stresses bounding the separation zone are substantially lessened.

In the Danish Knudedyb inlet, very large primary bed forms remain ebb-oriented during a tidal cycle while smaller superimposed bed forms reverse direction with each tidal phase. Hydroacoustic in situ observations reveal pronounced differences in suspended sediment transport patterns between tidal phases caused by the relative orientation of primary bed forms and the mean tidal flow and flow unsteadiness during a single tidal phase. When flow and primary <b>bed</b> <b>form</b> orientation are aligned, water-depth-scale macroturbulence develops in the <b>bed</b> <b>form</b> lee-sides {{in the presence of}} flow separation. Macroturbulent flow structures occur at high flow stages and are coupled to increased amounts of sediment in suspension. When flow and <b>bed</b> <b>form</b> orientation are opposed no evidence of flow separation associated with primary bed forms is found.
