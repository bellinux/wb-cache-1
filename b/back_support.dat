5|$|Initially, Greer {{was capable}} of seating 7,200spectators, but was {{expanded}} to 8,800 {{by the end of}} the inaugural season. Theater-type seats with <b>back</b> <b>support</b> and armrests accounted for 3,000 of the stadium's seats; bleacher seats made up the remainder. The press box included two radio broadcast booths and an organ booth. There were locker rooms for two teams, which each accommodated 25people, as well as a locker room for umpires. The field measured 330feet (100m) down the left and right field lines, 375feet (114m) to left- and right-center fields, and 405feet (123m) to center field. Bullpens are located in foul territory in the outfield, with the home team occupying the third base dugout, and the visitors occupying the first base dugout. Eight lighting grids atop steel poles 100feet (30m) high provided illumination for night games. Amenities for customers at the park included two men's and women's restrooms and seven concession stands.|$|E
25|$|A Slide Away Bed {{is a type}} of {{sofa bed}} that slides to the wall to form a sofa. The {{mattress}} is hinged to form a seating surface and <b>back</b> <b>support.</b> The bed frame support is a telescoping frame that allows the bed platform to recess below the seating cushion. The primitive version of the slide away bed was co-invented by Manning Lane, Warren J. Hauck and Roy O. Sweeney of Cincinnati, Ohio. U.S. patent #4,204,287 was filed on September 5, 1978 and issued on May 27, 1980.|$|E

25|$|The {{rebellion}} {{itself had}} lasted until March 1939, {{when it was}} finally quelled by British troops. It forced Britain to make substantial concessions to Arab demands. Jewish immigration was to continue but under restrictions, with a quota of 75,000 places spread out over the following five years. On the expiry of this period further Jewish immigration would depend on Arab consent. Besides local unrest, another key factor in bringing about a decisive change in British policy was Nazi Germany's preparations for a European war, which would develop into a worldwide conflict. In British strategic thinking, securing the loyalty {{and support of the}} Arab world assumed an importance of some urgency. While Jewish support was unquestioned, Arab backing in a new global conflict was by no means assured. By promising to phase out Jewish immigration into Palestine, Britain hoped to win <b>back</b> <b>support</b> from wavering Arabs. Husseini, allied to radical elements in exile, hailing from provincial Palestinian families, convinced the AHC, against moderate Palestinian families who were minded to accept it, to reject the White Paper of 1939, which had recommended an Arab-majority state and an end to building a Jewish national home. The rejection was based on its perceived failure to promise an end to immigration; the land policy it advocated was thought to provide imperfect remedies: and the promised independence appeared to depend on Jewish assent and cooperation. Husseini, who also had personal interests threatened by these arrangements, also feared that acceptance would strengthen the hand of his political opponents in the Palestine national movement, such as the Nashashibis. Schwanitz and Rubin argued that Husseini was a great influence on Hitler and that his rejectionism was, ironically, the real causal factor for the establishment of the state of Israel, a thesis Mikics, who regards Husseini as a 'radical anti-semite, finds both 'astonishing' and 'silly', since it would logically entail the collateral thesis that the Zionist movement triggered the Holocaust.|$|E
500|$|For {{the scenes}} {{involving}} self-defense courses, the supporting cast underwent stunt training {{with the help}} of stunt coordinator Sean Graham. Ron wears a <b>back</b> <b>support</b> belt during the course, which was actor Nick Offerman's idea. Offerman has many fight choreography skills from his past work in the Chicago theater, and he combined those skills with his training in Kabuki dance and theater. Offerman said, [...] "I threw in a couple of Kabuki moves that we all had a hard time keeping a straight face through." [...] It was a reference to the episode [...] "The Stakeout", in which Ron suffered a hernia, and Muharrar said, [...] "The idea [...] that Ron has the belt in his car trunk and is ready to go at a moment's notice." ...|$|E
2500|$|The long-waisted, heavily boned stays of {{the early}} 1740s with their narrow back, wide front, and {{shoulder}} straps gave way by the 1760s to strapless stays which still were cut high at the armpit, to encourage a woman to stand with her shoulders slightly back, a fashionable posture. [...] The fashionable shape was a rather conical torso, with large hips. [...] The waist was not particularly small. [...] Stays were laced snugly, but comfortably. [...] They offered <b>back</b> <b>support</b> for heavy lifting, and poor and middle class women were able to work comfortably in them.|$|E

2500|$|Strapless stays {{which still}} were cut high at the armpit, to {{encourage}} a woman to stand with her shoulders slightly back, a fashionable posture. [...] The fashionable shape was a rather conical torso, with large hips. [...] The waist was not particularly small. [...] Stays were usually laced snugly, but comfortably; only those interested in extreme fashions laced tightly. [...] They offered <b>back</b> <b>support</b> for heavy lifting, and poor and middle class women were able to work comfortably in them. [...] As the relaxed, country fashion took hold in France, stays were sometimes replaced by a lightly boned garment called [...] "un corset," [...] though this style did not achieve popularity in England, where stays remained standard {{through the end of}} the period.|$|E
