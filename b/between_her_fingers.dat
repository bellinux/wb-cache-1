2500|$|Her direct {{physical}} senses were deadened, and Norma {{no longer}} cared about taste, touch, or smell ... She found it remarkable to see webbing <b>between</b> <b>her</b> <b>fingers</b> and toes. Her face, once blunt-featured and later flawlessly beautiful, {{now had a}} small mouth and tiny eyes surrounded by smooth folds. Her head was immense, {{while the rest of}} her body atrophied to a useless appendage.|$|E
2500|$|However, {{the clue}} which led {{directly}} to RÃ®maru's arrest was a medical diagnosis sheet. On March 4, 1971, a group of six doctors found that he had [...] "suspected periodic epilepsy"; the doctors' note was found beneath the body of Mihaela Ursu, whom he murdered in especially brutal fashion two months later. <b>Between</b> <b>her</b> <b>fingers</b> she had strands of his hair {{that were used to}} identify him (some have suggested that he went to the doctors to eventually be able to claim insanity at trial). Because the note was wet and bloody, only the letterhead from the Bucharest Students' Hospital was visible.|$|E
60|$|There {{was a long}} silence. Joan {{felt the}} tears {{trickling}} <b>between</b> <b>her</b> <b>fingers.</b>|$|E
60|$|Berenice held it <b>between</b> <b>her</b> <b>finger</b> tips. There {{were only}} a few lines, and she read them at a glance.|$|R
6000|$|The woman seized Ball-Carrier <b>between</b> <b>her</b> <b>finger</b> and thumb, and {{was going}} to carry him to the kitchen, when the boy spoke: ...|$|R
60|$|The two of 'em {{stood there}} {{looking at each other}} for a minute, and then my wife, holding the letter <b>between</b> <b>'er</b> <b>finger</b> and thumb as if it was pison, passed it to Mrs. Smithers.|$|R
60|$|She {{felt his}} forehead, altered a bandage for a moment, {{and took his}} wrist <b>between</b> <b>her</b> <b>fingers.</b>|$|E
60|$|She {{held the}} sweet <b>between</b> <b>her</b> <b>fingers.</b> He opened his mouth. She popped it in, and blushed.|$|E
60|$|Lucy {{covered her}} face her hands, and the tears, in spite of her, forced their way <b>between</b> <b>her</b> <b>fingers.</b>|$|E
60|$|She drew {{forth the}} letter, {{unfolded}} it, {{and held it}} up to him, letting it hang by one corner from <b>between</b> <b>her</b> <b>finger</b> and thumb, so that the light from the lamp, though remote, fell directly upon its surface.|$|R
60|$|Elfride {{had closed}} the note-book, and was {{carrying}} it disdainfully by the corner <b>between</b> <b>her</b> <b>finger</b> and thumb; <b>her</b> face wore a nettled look. She silently extended the volume towards him, raising her eyes {{no higher than}} her hand was lifted.|$|R
6000|$|... "So ye're no {{thinking}} {{to let us}} in, Mr Halliday? Weel, weel; gude e'en to you--ye hae seen the last o' me, and o' this bonny die too," [...] said Jenny, holding <b>between</b> <b>her</b> <b>finger</b> and thumb a splendid silver dollar.|$|R
60|$|Elizabeth nodded, and crumbled {{a little}} piece of roll <b>between</b> <b>her</b> <b>fingers.</b> Then she leaned over the table towards Tavernake.|$|E
60|$|One of {{the roses}} had {{remained}} fixed in the stiff fold of her panier. She took it <b>between</b> <b>her</b> <b>fingers</b> and sighed.|$|E
6000|$|Lady Meadowcroft's thumb dived <b>between</b> <b>her</b> <b>fingers</b> again. [...] "What! {{is there}} plague in Bombay?" [...] she asked, innocently, in her nervous fashion.|$|E
60|$|There she {{interrupted}} me--and, oh, in what an impudent manner! She took my chin <b>between</b> <b>her</b> <b>finger</b> and thumb, {{and lifted}} my downcast face, {{and looked at}} me with an appearance of eager expectation which I was quite at a loss to understand.|$|R
60|$|What {{should she}} do? To {{throw it away}} would seem stupid, and to keep it was awkward. She held it <b>between</b> <b>her</b> <b>finger</b> and thumb, twirled it round on its axis and twirled it back again, {{regarding}} and yet not examining it. Just then she saw the trumpet-major coming back.|$|R
50|$|LM was {{to follow}} {{the path of a}} wire mounted onto a board with <b>her</b> right index <b>finger.</b> The test was {{performed}} under purely tactile (blindfolded), purely visual (glass over the board), or tactile-visual condition. The patient performed best in the purely tactile condition and very poorly in the visual condition. She did not benefit from the visual information in the tactile-visual condition either. The patient reported that the difficulty was <b>between</b> <b>her</b> <b>finger</b> and <b>her</b> eyes. She could not follow <b>her</b> <b>finger</b> with <b>her</b> eyes if she moved <b>her</b> <b>finger</b> too fast.|$|R
60|$|The Duchess twirled the {{sprig of}} {{lavender}} <b>between</b> <b>her</b> <b>fingers.</b> She {{could not remember}} ever to have heard her niece so much in earnest.|$|E
6000|$|Jordan did {{not think}} he had, and the girl pressed {{one or two of}} the parcels <b>between</b> <b>her</b> <b>fingers.</b> [...] "Then I wonder where the muslin is?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't know. I {{have nothing}} to do with it," [...] she answered; and taking the upper hinge of the slate <b>between</b> <b>her</b> <b>fingers</b> and thumb she slowly raised it.|$|E
60|$|Henrietta hung back, but her arm {{was linked}} in Agatha's, {{and she was}} drawn along in spite of herself. Smilash did not move. Agatha strolled on coolly, and as she passed him, adroitly caught the apron <b>between</b> <b>her</b> <b>finger</b> and thumb and twitched it from his face. Instantly Henrietta uttered a {{piercing}} scream, and Smilash caught her in his arms.|$|R
60|$|She glided {{round to}} the window, took {{the head of}} the bolt <b>between</b> <b>her</b> <b>finger</b> and thumb, and softly screwed it round until it was entirely {{withdrawn}} from its position. The shutters remained as before, whilst, where the bolt had come out, was now a shining hole three-quarters of an inch in diameter, through which one might see {{into the middle of the}} room. She applied her eye to the orifice.|$|R
60|$|Gudrun seated herself behind him, and as {{he rocked}} back, she caught his hair <b>between</b> <b>her</b> <b>finger</b> and thumb, so that it tugged him as he swung forward again. He took no notice. There was only {{the sound of the}} rockers on the floor. In silence, like a crab, Gudrun caught a strand of his hair each time he rocked back. Ursula flushed, and sat in some pain. She saw the {{irritation}} gathering on his brow.|$|R
60|$|While thus muttering, {{the witch}} had filled a fresh pipe of tobacco, {{and held the}} stem <b>between</b> <b>her</b> <b>fingers,</b> as {{doubtful}} whether to thrust it into her own mouth or Feathertop's.|$|E
60|$|The gypsy peeped at him <b>between</b> <b>her</b> <b>fingers,</b> and {{saw that}} he was of two minds. She let her hands fall from her face, and {{undoubtedly}} there were tears on her cheeks.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then if {{my husband}} has left me all he could--this property," [...] she went on rapidly, {{twisting}} her handkerchief <b>between</b> <b>her</b> <b>fingers,</b> [...] "I can do with it what I like, can't I?" ...|$|E
60|$|Torfrida said humbly {{that she}} would try; and walked with the divining-rod <b>between</b> <b>her</b> pretty <b>fingers</b> for many a mile in wood and wold, {{wherever}} the ground looked red and rusty. But she never found any iron.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{know all}} about it. I have a {{confidential}} little bird," [...] said she, showing very pretty airs of her head over the bit of work held high <b>between</b> <b>her</b> active <b>fingers.</b> [...] "There is a powerful magnet in this neighborhood." ...|$|R
6000|$|Miss Mayfield's quick eye took in its details. Her quick intellect took in {{something}} else. She had seated {{herself on the}} road-bank, and, clasping <b>her</b> knees <b>between</b> <b>her</b> locked <b>fingers,</b> she suddenly looked up at Jeff. [...] "What possessed you to come half-way up a mountain, instead of going on to the top?" ...|$|R
60|$|Now Peter, {{strong as}} he was, turned faint, {{and in his}} {{agitation}} let go her hand which she lifted, the violets still <b>between</b> <b>her</b> <b>fingers,</b> considering it {{as though it were}} a new thing to her.|$|E
6000|$|... "Indeed?" [...] said Jane coldly, {{crumbling}} a bit {{of bread}} <b>between</b> <b>her</b> <b>fingers.</b> Her face was expressionless and her voice ditto; but I had heard her criticize nervous people who did things like that at table.|$|E
6000|$|... "No!" [...] she said. [...] "Only I feel I'd {{like to talk}} to you for {{a little}} time, if you don't mind. It's nothing very much," [...] she continued, nervously {{twisting}} her handkerchief <b>between</b> <b>her</b> <b>fingers.</b>|$|E
60|$|Edie {{looked at}} the cheque intently and sighed a deep sigh of regret. How could she do otherwise? They were so very poor, and {{it was such an}} immense sum of money! Then she rose quietly without saying a word, and lighted a match from the box on the mantelpiece. She held the cheque firmly <b>between</b> <b>her</b> <b>finger</b> and thumb till it was nearly burnt, end let it drop slowly at last into the empty fireplace. Ernest rose up and kissed her tenderly. The leaden weight of the thirty pieces of silver was fairly off their united conscience. They had made what {{reparation}} they could for the evil of that unhappy, undesigned leader. After all Ernest had wasted the last remnant of his energy on one eventful evening, all for nothing.|$|R
60|$|Camilla was in ecstasies. She seized Vetranio's cheeks <b>between</b> <b>her</b> rosy little <b>fingers,</b> {{kissed him}} as enthusiastically {{as a child}} kisses a new toy, and darted gaily off to prepare for her departure.|$|R
6000|$|Then she {{returned}} quietly, {{took off her}} hat and shawl, and taking the unresisting hand of her brother, led {{him back to his}} former seat by the fire. Drawing a low stool in front of him, she proceeded to nestle between his knees--an old trick of hers--and once more taking his hand, stroked it <b>between</b> <b>her</b> brown <b>fingers,</b> looked up into his face, and said-- ...|$|R
