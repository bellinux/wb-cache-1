50|$|Process speeds are {{generally}} not as fast as conventional dry abrasive blasting when using the equivalent size and type of media. However the presence of water between {{the media and the}} substrate being processed creates a lubricating cushion that can protect both the media and the surface from excess damage. This has the dual advantage of lowering media breakdown rates and preventing impregnation of foreign materials into the surface. Hence surfaces after wet blasting are extremely clean, there is no embedded secondary contamination from the media or from previous blasting processes, and there is no static cling of dust to the <b>blasted</b> <b>surface.</b> Subsequent coating or bonding operations are not effected by the use of wet blasting or dry blasting because of the cleanliness levels achieved are identical. However wet blasting of mild steel will result in immediate or 'flash' corrosion of the blasted steel substrate due to the presence of water. The lack of surface recontamination also allows the use of single equipment for multiple blasting operations—e.g., stainless steel and carbon (mild) steel items can be processed in the same equipment with the same media without problems.|$|E

40|$|The {{blasting}} process {{generates a}} renewed surface {{on the surface}} of metallic biomaterials with a different topography and a different chemical composition. The impact of particles on the metallic surface increases both the surface roughness and susceptibility pitting corrosion. The aim of this work is to smoothen the sharp edges of blasted Ti 6 Al 4 V alloy surfaces by means of oxidation treatment and the evaluation of their susceptibility to pitting corrosion after this thermal oxidation. Oxidation treatments were performed at 500 and 700 °C for 1 h on samples blasted with SiO 2 /ZrO 2 and Al 2 O 3 particles. Compositional, microstructural and topographical characterization of the <b>blasted</b> <b>surfaces</b> were carried out by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDAX), and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The surface reactivity and corrosion behaviour of the samples were assessed by scanning Kelvin probe (SKP) and by anodic polarization curves. The susceptibility to pitting corrosion of the Ti 6 Al 4 V <b>blasted</b> <b>surfaces</b> becomes higher as roughness increases. The oxidation treatment of the Ti 6 Al 4 V <b>blasted</b> <b>surfaces</b> causes the presence of nuclei of oxides that cover the area free of particles, especially in the samples treated at 700 °C, giving rise to a higher micro-nano roughness. The presence of the oxide, covering the blasted Ti 6 Al 4 V, decreases the surface reactivity leading to a lower passive current and wider pasivation region, decreasing the susceptibility to pitting corrosion. © 2010 Elsevier B.

40|$|The {{blasting}} {{process to}} increase the roughness of the surface of metallic biomaterials is widely used. As a consequence, one can produce a renewed surface with different topography and chemical composition compared to the original one, which can alter the general corrosion behaviour of the samples. With this idea, {{the aim of this}} work is not only the topographical and compositional characterization of <b>blasted</b> <b>surfaces</b> of Ti 6 Al 4 V alloy but mainly its influence on the corrosion behaviour of these modified surfaces. The surfaces of Ti 6 Al 4 V alloys were blasted with SiO 2 /ZrO 2 and Al 2 O 3 particles of different size in order to obtain different roughnesses. To carry out the microstructural and topographical characterization of the <b>blasted</b> <b>surfaces,</b> the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) coupled with an energy dispersive X-ray (EDX), the contact profilometry method and the 3 D characterization by means of stereo-Fe-SEM have been used. By means of stereo-Fe-SEM, the roughness and the real surface area of the rough surfaces have been calculated. The microstructural, topographical and compositional results have been correlated with the corrosion behaviour of the samples immersed in Hank's solution and studied by means of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The blasting process alters topographical and chemically the surface of the samples. These modifications induce to an increase in the capacitance values of the roughened samples due to the prevalence of the effect of electrochemically active areas of Ti 6 Al 4 V surface over the effect of the presence of Al 2 O 3 and ZrO 2 particles on the <b>blasted</b> <b>surfaces.</b> However, the general corrosion behaviour of the samples is not drastically changed. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|The {{main problem}} facing the {{longevity}} of total joint replacements is wear particle-induced osteolysis, particularly around the acetabular component. Ovine Total Hip Replacement surgery was performed with roughened femoral heads {{in order to enhance}} wear debris generation in vivo. The resistance to aseptic loosening of acetabular components with different surface coatings was investigated. Implants remained in vivo for 1 year. Sheep were {{randomly assigned to one of}} six experimental groups where the acetabular cup was fixed utilising an: (a) cemented polyethylene acetabular cup, (b) metal backed grit <b>blasted</b> <b>surface,</b> (c) metal backed plasma sprayed titanium porous coating, (d) metal backed sintered beaded coating, (e) Hydroxyapatite (HA) -coated grit <b>blasted</b> <b>surface</b> (f) and HA-coated porous components. Ground Reaction Force (GRF) was used to asses the functional performance of the implants and data was collected pre-operatively and at 12, 24, 36 and 52 weeks post op. Wear debris generated was analysed and radiographs taken prior to preparation of thin sections. Fibrous tissue (FT) thickness and bone contact at 1 mm intervals along the acetabular bone-implant interface was calculated. GRF data demonstrated significant differences between experimental groups. In all groups there was an increase in the function of the hip after surgery and up to 24 weeks but thereafter the function of the group with the grit <b>blasted</b> <b>surface</b> reduced whereas the function of the other groups did not significantly change. Average wear particles generated were < 1 microm in size. The cemented group demonstrated a significantly thicker average FT layer (2. 69 mm) when compared with all other groups (p< 0. 05 in all cases) except the grit blasted group (1. 56 mm). HA porous coated cups demonstrated significantly least fibrous tissue adjacent to its interface when compared with all other groups (cemented p< 0. 05, grit blasted p= 0. 029, porous p< 0. 05, sintered beads p< 0. 05 and HA grit blasted p< 0. 05). Significantly increased bone contact to HA-coated porous cups (73. 33 %) when compared with all groups was identified except HA-coated grit blasted cups where no significant difference was demonstrated. Radiographic signs of loosening were visible in all groups except the HA-coated porous group. Results demonstrated that HA porous coated acetabular components significantly enhanced bone ingrowth in the presence of wear particles, preventing their migration and reducing osteolysis.

40|$|Objectives: The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{evaluate}} calcium phosphate precipitation and the amount of precipitated protein on three potentially bioactive surfaces when adding laminin in simulated body fluid. Material and Methods: Blasted titanium discs were prepared by three different techniques claimed to provide bioactivity: alkali and heat treatment (AH), anodic oxidation (AO) or hydroxyapatite coating (HA). A <b>blasted</b> <b>surface</b> incubated in laminin-containing simulated body fuid served as a positive control (B) while a <b>blasted</b> <b>surface</b> incubated in non laminin-containing simulated body fuid served as a negative control (B-). The immersion time was 1 hour, 24 hours, 72 hours and 1 week. Surface topography was investigated by interferometry and morphology by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). Analysis of the precipitated calcium and phosphorous was performed by Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDX) and the adsorbed laminin was quantified by iodine (125 I) labeling. Results: SEM demonstrated that all specimens except for the negative control were totally covered with calcium phosphate (CaP) after 1 week. EDX revealed that B- demonstrated lower sum of Ca and P levels compared to the other groups after 1 week. Iodine labeling demonstrated that laminin precipitated in a similar manner on the possibly bioactive surfaces as on the positive control surface. Conclusions: Our results indicate that laminin precipitates equally on all tested titanium surfaces and may function as a nucleation center thus locally elevating the calcium concentration.

Furthermore, to evaluate the significance of the SBF formed CaP coat on bone cell response. The surfaces were characterized by Optical Interferometry, Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS). CaP formation was evaluated after 12, 24 and 72 h in simulated body fluid (SBF). Primary human mandibular osteoblast-like cells were cultured on the various surfaces subjected to SBF for 72 h. Cellular attachment, differentiation (osteocalcin) and protein production (TGF-beta(1)) was evaluated after 3 h and 10 days respectively. Despite different morphological appearances, the roughness of the differently modified surfaces was similar. The possibly bioactive surfaces gave rise to an earlier CaP formation than the <b>blasted</b> <b>surface,</b> however, after 72 h the <b>blasted</b> <b>surface</b> demonstrated increased CaP formation compared to the possibly bioactive surfaces. Subsequent bone cell attachment was correlated to neither surface roughness nor the amount of formed CaP after SBF treatment.

However, bone response (cell attachment, osteocalcin and TGF-F production) on the blasted controls were similar or increased compared to the SBF treated fluoridated, AH and TiMgO surface.

40|$|A major {{determinant}} of successful osseointegration of endosseous implants is the surface topography of the implant, which influences the cellular {{response of the}} surrounding tissues. This series of experimental studies investigated cellular responses to surface modifications of titanium implant material. With machined (turned) surfaces as controls, the topography was altered by blasting with Ti 02 particles of varying size. Surface roughness increased with increasing particle size, up to 106 - 180 µm. Further increasing particle size to 300 gm did not significantly increase surface roughness. Cellular response was studied in two cell types: primary cultures of human gingival fibroblasts and osteoblast-like cells. The following responses were investigated: attachment, proliferation, differentiation and production of transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) and prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2). In study 1, turned surfaces favored fibroblast attachment, least attachment occurring on the <b>surfaces</b> <b>blasted</b> with 63 - 90 µm particles, whereas in study II, turned <b>surfaces</b> and those <b>blasted</b> with 63 - 90 gm particles provided the most favorable attachment for osteoblast-like cells. This strongly suggests that in contact with implant surfaces, bonederived cells behave differently from fibroblasts. Hence the results highlight the importance of using the relevant cell system for evaluation of dental implant material. Blasting with larger particles (300 gm) did not further enhance the initial attachment of osteoblast-like cells compared to the turned surfaces (study III). Studies III & IV concerned the effect of surface roughness on attachment, proliferation and differentiation of human osteoblast-like cells, {{as well as the}} production of two factors known to have potent effects on tissues surrounding an implant: TGF-beta 1, and PGE 2. Incorporation of [3 H]-thymidine and osteocalcin synthesis were significantly increased on all <b>blasted</b> <b>surfaces</b> compared to the turned surfaces. The production of TGFbeta 1, and PGE 2 was also higher on the <b>blasted</b> <b>surfaces.</b> In study V, the different surfaces subjected to cell culture tests were characterized by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Compared to the turned surfaces, the effective surface area is several times larger on the <b>blasted</b> <b>surfaces,</b> with less carbon contamination. Corrosion resistance was unaffected by blasting the normal machined titanium surfaces with titanium dioxide particles or exposing the samples to the culture conditions for 28 days. Osteoblast-like cells enhance ion incorporation and precipitation processes, whereas the amount of calcium adsorption is independent of surface roughness. In summary, the results show that the technique used for isolation of human osteoblast-like cells from mandibular bone is useful for investigating the biocompatibility of dental implant materials in vitro. Attachment of fibroblasts may be enhanced on turned surfaces and inhibited on <b>surfaces</b> roughened by <b>blasting.</b> <b>Surface</b> roughness, achieved by <b>blasting</b> titanium <b>surfaces</b> with various sizes of Ti 02 particles significantly favored proliferation, differentiation and production of TGFbeta 1 and PGE 2.

40|$|Introduction The {{quality of}} a sprayed metal deposit {{is known to be}} related to the nature of the {{prepared}} surface of the base metal. Grit blasting is a common method of surface preparation, and the actual profile or surface contour of the prepared surface can be varied considerably by variation in blasting conditions. The exact requirements of an acceptable surface have never been accurately stated, although a degree of undercut is. considered essential. The object of the present work is to develop a non-destructive method for the assessment of <b>blasted</b> mild steel <b>surfaces</b> in terms of suitability for metal spraying. Such a method needs to combine simplicity and speed, so that it can be used by normal inspection personnel without delaying production. Preferably the method should incorporate a 'failsafe! mechanism [...] A number of possible assessment methods have been considered, but attention has been largely concentrated on measurement of the diffuse reflectivity of <b>blasted</b> <b>surfaces.</b> In reality, of course, this is simply an attempt to replace the eye in visual inspection with an instrument, and so remove the human element. Results have been reasonably encouraging, but it is obvious that many more samples need to be examined before a true judgement can be made. Some difficulty has been encountered in deciding the requirements for an acceptable surface. For this reason, a part of the experimental effort has been devoted to the examination of <b>blasted</b> <b>surfaces,</b> and to the measurement of bond strength after metal spraying.

However, such a degree of surface roughness may enhance adhesion of bacteria and hinder their removal, thus increasing the risk of chronic infections at implant sites. Objective: To determine how surface roughness affects the adhesion of different clinical strains of S. oralis (isolated from peri-implant infections) to titanium surfaces used in dental implants. Methods: Mid-exponential growth phase cultures (OD 600 = 0. 5) of three fresh isolates of S. oralis (LA 11, 89 C and 192 B) were passed over titanium plates with Sa = 0. 1 µm (turned) or 1. 4 µm (blasted) in a flow-cell system for 2 hours. Numbers and viability of adhered bacteria were assessed using confocal microscopy after staining with the Live/Dead Baclight viability kit. Results: The bacteria showed {{a high degree of}} viability (> 95 %) and overall adhesion of all three strains was 2 to 5 times greater to <b>blasted</b> <b>surfaces</b> than that to turned ones, even after correction for the greater surface area (Sdr value of 58 %) of the <b>blasted</b> <b>surfaces.</b> Strain 192 B displayed the lowest number of adherent cells whereas binding of strain 89 C was 5 times greater on both surfaces.

Nuclear fallout predictions for Koa were larger and covered a broader range than Cactus, with significantly higher radiation levels, an order of magnitude larger, in the immediate region surrounding the blast. There had been a larger nuclear barge detonation, the 1.85 MT Apache test, off the island of Dridrilbwij two years prior in 1956, during which the island survived. The detonation of the Koa device, however, caused complete destruction of the island.|$|R
40|$|In {{this work}} we {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} laser irradiation on the bond toughness of aluminum/epoxy bonded joints. The evolution of substrate surface morphology and wettability, for various sets of laser process parameters (i. e. laser power, line spacing, scan speed), was investigated by means of Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and contact angle measurements. A proper combination of power, line spacing and scan speed was then selected and adhesive bonded Al/epoxy T-peel joints were prepared and tested. For comparison, similar samples were produced using substrates with classical grit <b>blasting</b> <b>surface</b> treatment. Finally, post-failure SEM analyses of fracture surfaces were performed, {{and in order to}} typify the increase in bond toughness of the joints, finite element simulations were carried out using a potential based cohesive zone model of fracture. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R
40|$|The main aim of {{this work}} is to monitor the surface {{treatment}} impact on the corrosion resistance of the welded stainless steel AISI 316 L to local corrosion forms. The excellent corrosion resistance of austenitic stainless steel {{is caused by the}} existence of stable, thin and well adhering passive layer which quality is strongly influenced by welding. Therefore surface treatment of stainless steel is very important with regard to its local corrosion susceptibility Surfaces of welded stainless steel were treated by various mechanical methods (grinding, garnet <b>blasting).</b> <b>Surface</b> properties were studied by SEM, corrosion resistance was evaluated after exposition tests in chlorides environment using weight and metalographic analysis. The experimental outcomes confirmed that the mechanical finishing has a significant effect on the corrosion behavior of welded stainless steel AISI 316 L. </span...|$|R
