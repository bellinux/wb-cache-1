5|$|In-game {{characters}} {{were inspired by}} illustrations from adventure and pirate stories such as Captain Blood (1922), the work of Charles Dana Gibson, and mugshots from Edwardian London and Australia. An anatomy expert helped ensure the morphology of character faces represented Great Britain, while Arkane maintained a sense of realism and political incorrectness. Mitton established defining groups for characters such as rich, poor, and hostile with specific anatomy and posture designs, and animators created stylized movements for each social class and specific characters to help convey emotions. The city guards, for example, have small heads, low shoulders, and <b>big</b> <b>hands,</b> with animations that blend human and monkey movements. Antonov and Mitton employed a textile carpet designer in Russia to design and paint some of the in-game art.|$|E

500|$|On {{the first}} day of the tournament, Moon was dealt pocket aces six times and got three-of-a-kind on the flop three times. He {{performed}} well on {{the first day}} and continued a successful streak throughout the tournament, although he himself proclaimed it was luck. He eliminated several professional poker players during the tournament, including David Benyamine. He eventually obtained the chip lead and kept it until the seventh day of play.

500|$|Harald is {{described}} by Snorri Sturluson to have been physically [...] "larger than other men and stronger". He {{is said to have}} had light hair and beard, a long [...] "upper beard" [...] (moustache), and that one of his eyebrows was somewhat higher situated than the other. He also reportedly had <b>big</b> <b>hands</b> and feet, and could measure five ells in height. It is not known whether Snorri's description of Harald's physical appearance actually represents historical facts. The tall stature of Harald is also substantiated by a story that relates that before the Battle of Stamford Bridge, Harold Godwinson offered Tostig back the earldom of Northumbria, and Harald [...] "six feet of the ground of England, or perhaps more seeing that he is taller than most men" [...] (according to Henry of Huntingdon) or [...] "six feet of English ground, or seven feet as he was taller than other men" [...] (according to Snorri Sturluson).|$|E
500|$|In {{the fall}} of 1944, Rifenburg {{enrolled}} at the University of Michigan. The United Press syndicate ran a feature article about Rifenburg in September 1944 that opened as follows: [...] "Another great end has made his appearance on the Big Ten football horizon {{in the person of}} Dick Rifenburg, 18-year-old Michigan freshman. Every so often a great offensive end comes along, a player who has to learn how to play defense, but who has the natural speed, smooth actions, height and <b>big</b> <b>hands</b> that is the mark of an outstanding pass receiver. Rifenburg has laid claim to that rating. A loose-limbed 180-pound freshman from Saginaw, Mich., Rifenberg is being boomed as the Big Ten's next 'freshman sensation.'" [...] As a freshman, he caught two touchdown passes in his first college football game against Iowa. In an article titled [...] "Teens and TNT," [...] Time reported on Rifenburg's performance: [...] "Of the few teams already in action, Michigan's teens rang the freshman bell loudest last week by winning their opener, 12 -to-7, against the strong Iowa Seahawks (Naval Pre-Flight); 6-ft. 4 Freshman End Dick Rifenburg caught passes and ran for both Michigan touchdowns." ...|$|E

500|$|Raleigh's {{commanding}} officer. On selecting Elba, del Toro stated: [...] "This is a {{movie where}} I have {{had to deal with}} more dialogue than ever, and the way I cast the movie was—who do I want to hear say these things? Who do I want Charlie Hunnam to go against? Who can really tell Charlie Hunnam 'sit down and listen'?" [...] In another interview, the director said: [...] "I wanted to have Idris not be the blonde, square-jawed, Anglo, super hip marine that knows [...] I wanted somebody that could bring a lot of authority, but that you could feel {{the weight of the world}} on his shoulders. When I watched Luther, that's the essence of the character… Luther is carrying literally the evils of the world on his shoulders. He's doing penance for all humanity… Idris is one of those actors that is capable of embodying humanity, in almost like a Rodin sculpture-type, larger than life, almost like a Russian realism statue, you know, <b>big</b> <b>hands,</b> all the turmoil of humanity in his eyes. I wanted somebody that you could have doubts internally, and very few guys can do that." [...] To prepare for the role, Elba watched footage of politicians David Cameron and Barack Obama, as well as Russell Crowe in Gladiator and Mel Gibson in Braveheart. Del Toro initially offered the role to Tom Cruise, who declined because of scheduling conflicts.|$|E

[...] Ron has the trademark red hair of the Weasleys and is indeed one of Harry's tallest schoolmates, even outgrowing some of his older brothers.

2500|$|Sports writer Tim Murnane in 1894 {{declared}} Bennett [...] "unquestionably {{the greatest}} back stop the game ever produced, taking his throwing and batting into consideration [...] [...] [...] [...] Year after year Bennett led the catchers of the League and country until it seemed {{impossible to get}} a player to head him off. It made no difference to him who pitched the ball, {{he was there to}} catch it, and always with <b>big</b> <b>hands.</b> [...] Who can remember Bennett dropping a pitched ball? Passed balls were a lost art when this man was behind the stick, and he was the ideal back stop. [...] Nichols always insisted on having him do his catching, saying that Bennett knew every batsman's weak points, and made easy work for the pitcher." ...|$|E

David Longfield resigned from the regiment on 21 November 1865, with the honorary rank of Captain. He took up residence with Katrine in Cheshire and in 1869 sold his commission. David Longfield was unable to marry Katrine until Katrine had obtained a divorce on 21 February 1871, after the birth of their first two sons. Beatty's birth certificate recorded his mother's surname as Beatty, and his parents' eventual marriage at St Michael's Church in Liverpool was kept secret.|$|E
