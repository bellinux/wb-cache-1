5|$|After {{a futile}} attempt to {{approach}} Herald Island, the ship began the journey back to Alaska; {{next day she}} encountered <b>Bear,</b> <b>with</b> Bartlett aboard. McConnell records that the party were unanimous in their desire to remain with the ship that had effected their rescue, but Bartlett ordered them aboard Bear. Before returning to Alaska, Bear made a final attempt to reach Herald Island; ice limited their approach to , and they saw no signs of life. The reunited party arrived at Nome on 13 September, to a great welcome from the local population.|$|E
5|$|Mark Antony was {{amassing}} political support, but Octavian {{still had}} opportunity to rival {{him as the}} leading member of the faction supporting Caesar. Mark Antony had lost the support of many Romans and supporters of Caesar when he initially opposed the motion to elevate Caesar to divine status. Octavian failed to persuade Antony to relinquish Caesar's money to him. During the summer, he managed to win support from Caesarian sympathizers, however, who saw the younger heir as the lesser evil and hoped to manipulate him, or to <b>bear</b> <b>with</b> him during their efforts {{to get rid of}} Antony.|$|E
5|$|Taurus {{became an}} {{important}} object of worship among the Druids. Their Tauric religious festival was held while the Sun passed through the constellation. Among the arctic people known as the Inuit, the constellation is called Sakiattiat and the Hyades is Nanurjuk, with the latter representing {{the spirit of the}} polar bear. Aldebaran represents the <b>bear,</b> <b>with</b> the remainder of the stars in the Hyades being dogs that are holding the beast at bay. In Buddhism, legends hold that Gautama Buddha was born when the Full Moon was in Vaisakha, or Taurus. Buddha's birthday is celebrated with the Wesak Festival, or Vesākha, which occurs on the first or second Full Moon when the Sun is in Taurus.|$|E

Pescara is the capital of Province of Pescara which is situated in the Abruzzo region. The official mascot was a Marsican brown bear, called Aua`, wearing a diving mask and flip-flops with swimfins in his hands. The Marsican brown bear is a highly threatened, unrecognised subspecies of the Brown <b>bear,</b> <b>with</b> a range restricted to the Abruzzo National Park.

5|$|As the {{two ships}} closed Truxtun's ship held the weather gauge, the {{position}} upwind from his opponent which {{allowed him to}} close or break off. However the heavy winds caused Constellation to heel so much that her leeward gunports had to remain closed. Truxtun decided to cede the weather gauge to the French by sailing past L'Insurgentes to reach her leeward side. From there Constellation could bring more of her guns to <b>bear.</b> <b>With</b> Constellation approaching his frigate fast, Barreaut tried {{to communicate with the}} Americans. The American frigate ignored the French hail, closing to within fifty yards of L'Insurgente before opening up with a broadside. Loaded with double shot, the opening American salvo struck the French frigate's quarterdeck. Barreaut's vessel replied with her own broadside that damaged Constellation's fore topmast. Midshipman David Porter, stationed in the rigging of Constellations damaged mast, managed to relieve pressure from it and prevented its collapse. L'Insurgente attempted to close on the American frigate to board her, but Constellation held the weather gage and had less damage to her rigging, enabling her to avoid Barreaut's attempt to draw alongside.|$|E
5|$|The revenue cutter Bear {{arrived in}} St Michael, Alaska, midway through June. Her master, Captain Cochran, {{agreed to go}} to Wrangel Island {{as soon as he}} got {{permission}} from the United States government. It would be impossible, in any event, to attempt the rescue before mid-July; ice conditions in the Arctic that year were reported as severe. After receiving permission, <b>Bear,</b> <b>with</b> Bartlett aboard, left St Michael on 13 July; the ship had many calls to make along the Alaskan coast before she could proceed with the rescue. On 5 August, at Port Hope, Bartlett met with Kataktovik and gave him his expedition wages and a new suit of clothing. At Point Barrow on 21 August Bartlett encountered Burt McConnell, Stefansson's erstwhile secretary, who gave details of Stefansson's movements after leaving Karluk the previous September. In April 1914, McConnell reported, Stefansson had headed north with two companions, searching for new lands.|$|E

Toyota Elephant Passage, which opened on June 1, 2012, is divided into five areas for rotating the various species.|$|E

25|$|A black <b>bear</b> <b>with</b> broken {{hind legs}} can still climb effectively.
