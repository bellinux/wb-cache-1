The player's job is to repel an alien force using the recourses that you are given by each region and country that {{is a part of the}} organization. The game is played through confrontations with the alien force using a squad of 4 to 6 soldiers with periods of time in between where the player is able to even the odds placed against them by upgrading weapons and armor for the soldiers using technology that is recovered from the aliens. These upgrades result in boosted health as well as laser and plasma based weapons and are necessary to achieve if the player wishes to complete the game.

40|$|A novel {{statistical}} model {{is presented to}} quantify situation awareness {{in the operation of}} small civilian Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS).
