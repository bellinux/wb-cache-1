She was quickly rushed to a hospital. Although her physical injuries took only a few weeks to heal, she did not return to competitive tennis for more than two years. Initially, there was speculation that the attack might have been politically motivated because Seles was from Yugoslavia. She was known to have received death threats in relation to the ongoing conflict in her native Yugoslavia. However, German authorities were quick to rule this out, describing her attacker as confused and possibly mentally disturbed.|$|E
50|$|A <b>boning</b> <b>knife</b> is used {{to remove}} bones from cuts of meat. It has a thin, {{flexible}} blade, usually about 12 cm to 15 cm (5 or 6 inches) long, that allows it to get in to small spaces. A stiff <b>boning</b> <b>knife</b> is good for beef and pork, and a flexible one is preferred for poultry and fish.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>boning</b> <b>knife</b> {{is a type}} {{of kitchen}} knife with a sharp point and a narrow blade. It is used in food {{preparation}} for removing the bones of poultry, meat, and fish. Generally 12 cm to 17 cm (5 to 6 ½ in) in length (although many brands, such as Samoan Cutlery, have been known to extend up to 9 ½ inches), it features a very narrow blade. Boning knives are not as [...] "thick" [...] as some of other popular kitchen or butcher knives, as this makes precision boning, especially in deep cuts and holes, much less difficult. A stiff <b>boning</b> <b>knife</b> is good for boning beef and pork, but a very flexible <b>boning</b> <b>knife</b> is preferred for poultry and fish.|$|E

50|$|Fillet knives {{are like}} very {{flexible}} <b>boning</b> <b>knives</b> {{that are used}} to fillet and prepare fish. They have blades about 15 cm to 28 cm (6 to 11 inches) long, allowing them to move easily along the backbone and under the skin of fish.|$|R
50|$|Usually about 5 cm to 8 cm (2 to 3 inches) long, a {{trimming}} knife has a small, curved blade that is shaped somewhat like a <b>boning</b> <b>knife.</b> Trimming knives {{are ideal for}} small tasks such as decorating and peeling.|$|E
50|$|Congost told {{authorities}} that Martí {{was in the}} habit of leaving them alone and that one day they risked exploring the rooms that Martí forbade them from entering. They found a sack with girl’s clothes covered in blood and a <b>boning</b> <b>knife</b> also covered with blood. Congost never left the flat during her captivity.|$|E
5000|$|Few {{companies}} {{continue to}} produce sticking knives. Firearms have generally replaced the sticking knife in home livestock processing. Most slaughterhouses use humane killers, which project a steel rod through {{the skull of}} the animal. Because sticking knives are so infrequently used, a home butcher may choose another type of knife that would serve other purposes as well. A <b>boning</b> <b>knife</b> or narrow hunting knife is commonly used {{in place of the}} more specialized sticking knife.|$|E
25|$|Many {{artifacts}} such as arrowheads, {{pieces of}} pottery, <b>bone</b> <b>knives,</b> and <b>bone</b> scrapers {{can be found}} exposed or only slightly buried at First Peoples Buffalo Jump State Park. It is illegal to disturb these items, dig them up, or remove them from the park. Park rangers should be alerted {{to the location of}} these items when they are discovered.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the autumn}} of 1879, I made a {{discovery}} {{in connection with this}} matter, for in an old grave at Ekaluit ... I found 9 pieces of basalt containing round balls and irregular pieces of metallic iron. These pieces were lying together with <b>bone</b> <b>knives,</b> similar to those brought home by John Ross, {{as well as with the}} usual stone tools ... whereas the 9 pieces of basalt with the iron balls were evidently the material for the <b>bone</b> <b>knives.</b> This iron is soft and keeps well in the air, from which reason it is fit for use in the manner described by Ross. The rock in which the iron appears is a typical, large-grained felspar-basalt, and the discovery has a double significance, firstly, because it is the first time we have seen the material out of which the Esquimaux Eskimo made artificial knives, and secondly, because it showed that they have used telluric iron for that purpose." ...|$|R
50|$|A fillet knife (also {{called a}} {{filleting}} knife) is a kitchen knife used for filleting. It gives good control and aids in filleting. It is very flexible <b>boning</b> <b>knives</b> {{that are used}} to filet and prepare fish. They have blades about 15 cm to 28 cm (6 to 11 inches) long, allowing them to move easily along the backbone and under the skin of fish.|$|R
50|$|On January 5, 2005, Marrufo {{was arrested}} for beating, {{slashing}} and stabbing his mother to death with two meat cleavers and a <b>boning</b> <b>knife.</b> Marrufo informed detectives that he believed his mother was possessed by Satan {{and that he was}} trying to save her soul. He was convicted in 2006 of first degree murder with an enhancement for the personal use of a deadly weapon. Marrufo was subsequently found not guilty by reason of insanity and was placed into a state mental institution.|$|E
50|$|Martí {{was also}} {{questioned}} {{about the presence}} of bones, human remains, creams, potions, poultices, ointments, blood bottles, as well as the <b>boning</b> <b>knife.</b> Interrogators asked if she had subjected the bones to be burned or cooked, as forensics suggested. Martí claimed that she studied human anatomy, but under pressure from the interrogators she confessed that she was a healer and used children as raw material for the production of her remedies. She claimed to be an expert, and knew how to make the best remedies and preparations that were highly sought after by wealthy people of good social position.|$|E
50|$|On {{the night}} of Saturday 6 June 1962, MacDonald went to a wine saloon in Pitt Street, Sydney, where he met 42-year-old James Hackett, a thief and {{derelict}} who had just recently been released from prison. They went back to MacDonald's new residence where they continued to drink alcohol. After a short period, Hackett fell asleep on the floor. MacDonald then got out a <b>boning</b> <b>knife</b> that he used in his delicatessen. He stabbed Hackett in the neck, the blow passing straight through. After the first blow, Hackett woke up and tried to shield himself, pushing the knife back into MacDonald's other hand and cutting it severely. MacDonald then unleashed a renewed attack, eventually striking the knife into Hackett's heart, killing him instantly. He continued to stab his victim until {{he had to stop}} for breath. Hackett's blood was splattered all over the walls and floor.|$|E

50|$|The archaeological finds {{consisted}} of shells and animal <b>bones,</b> <b>knives</b> {{and an array}} of pottery ranging over several centuries. Large quantities of modern glass were found, in addition to flint and pot shards. The excavations revealed that the foundation of the tower was on an artificial terrace which was created for the purpose on the northeastern end of a drumlin. The rear end of this terrace had been stabilised by a buttress retaining wall built in 1923, 4 m from the tower's southwestern end.|$|R

50|$|Nanza {{comprises}} numerous earth lodge sites {{encircled by}} a protective wall perhaps six feet high. Today the fortification is still visible. Archeological excavations have determined there was originally a ditch three feet deep and ten feet wide surrounding the berm. An earth embankment supporting a post palisade was discovered inside the ditch. Guns, hatchets, knives, beads, kettles, cloth and other European goods {{have been recovered}} from Ponca Fort, {{and serve as a}} testimony to the village's important position in the local fur trade. There is also evidence of extensive trade with other tribes.

50|$|The first archaeological {{visit to}} San Nicolas was by Paul Schumacher for the Smithsonian Institution in 1875. His team {{uncovered}} numerous artifacts from surface sites, {{assumed to be}} from a later period of Nicoleño culture, as the island's climate is not well suited for preservation. Artifacts collected by these early visitors include grass matting and clothing fragments, <b>bone</b> <b>knives</b> and fishhooks, and soapstone fish and bird effigies. Nicoleño culture was entirely dependent on the ocean for sustenance, as the island was home to only four types of land animals, none of which were valuable for food. The island {{is home to a}} large abundance of fish and sea mammals, as well as birds, which the Nicoleño were skilled at catching.|$|R
5000|$|A Chinese chef's knife — {{sometimes}} referred to as a Caidao, which literally mean [...] "vegetable knife", [...] "Chinese cleaver" [...] or [...] "chopper"— is the rectangular-bladed, all-purpose knife traditionally used in China, Vietnam, Cambodia, and many other Asian countries to prepare a variety of meats, fish, and vegetables. The popularity of this style of knife has spread with the associated cuisines. They resemble Western cleavers in appearance, but most Chinese chef's knives are relatively thin-bladed and designed for slicing, chopping, and mincing vegetables, fish, and boneless meats. Heavier Gudao or <b>bone</b> <b>knives</b> are produced and are used much like Western-type meat cleavers to prepare large sides of beef, pork, and other boned meats. However, Chinese-style knives of this weight are not common in the West.|$|R
50|$|A cleaver {{is a large}} knife that {{varies in}} its shape but usually resembles a rectangular-bladed hatchet. It is largely used as a kitchen or butcher knife {{intended}} for hacking through <b>bone.</b> The <b>knife's</b> broad side {{can also be used}} for crushing in food preparation (such as garlic).|$|R
50|$|Very sharp knives sharpen {{at about}} 10 dps (degrees per side) (which {{implies that the}} knife's edge has an {{included}} angle of 20-degrees). Generally speaking, razors, paring knives, and fillet knives should be the sharpest knives at an angle of 12° - 18°. Most kitchen knives, like utility/slicing <b>knives,</b> chef’s <b>knives,</b> <b>boning</b> <b>knives,</b> carving knives, should be sharpened to 15° - 25°. The exceptions are Japanese style knives that are usually sharpened to 14° - 16° depending on the knife maker. Japanese style knives utilize a much harder steel, {{and are therefore more}} brittle than their Western style counterparts. This means care should be taken when handling these knives as they are susceptible to chipping and breaking. The sporting knife category, including pocket knives, survival knives, and hunting knives, sees more intense action and should be sharpened to the 25° - 30° angle range. The less sharp angle means there is more metal there to cut, thus providing more durability out in the field. For an extremely durable edge, a machete, chisel, drawknife or ax should be sharpened down to 30° - 40° providing even more ruggedness and longer lasting sharpness.|$|R
50|$|From about 1700 to the 1870s, Comanche, Tonkawa, Lipan Apache, Kickapoo and Kiowa {{roamed the}} county. These tribes settled in rockshelters {{in the river}} and creek valleys, leaving behind {{artifacts}} and caches of seeds, implements, burial sites, and petroglyphs, river shells, turkey and deer <b>bones,</b> flint <b>knives,</b> scrapers, and points.|$|R
50|$|Sea-lions, harbor seals, {{and the sea}} otters are {{the most}} {{abundant}} marine mammals. The men brought home the skins and prepared them by soaking them in urine and stretching them. The women undertook the sewing (Enthnohistory: Gross & Khera pg. 32). Preparation of the gut for clothing involved several steps. The prepared intestines were turned inside out. A <b>bone</b> <b>knife</b> {{was used to remove}} the muscle tissue and fat from the walls of the intestine. The gut was cut and stretched, and fastened to stakes to dry. It was then cut and sewn to make waterproof parkas, bags, and other receptacles (Turner, Ch. 5, pg. 70). On some hunting trips, the men would take several women with them. They would catch birds and prepare the carcasses and feathers for future use. They caught Puffins, Lunda Cirrhata, Fratercula Corniculata, Guillemots, and Cephus & Murres.|$|R

50|$|The barbs {{would open}} wounds and the {{resulting}} blood loss would kill the prey faster and with less loss of hunting equipment than traditional spears. These weapons helped increase the rate of making weapons and killing animals. These changes in lithic technology {{appear to have been}} adaptations to reduced resource availability due to climate changes during the Last Glacial Maximum and Younger Dryas allowing for more efficient sustenance strategies. An important site for learning more about the diverse adaptations of the microblade is Shuidonggou Locality 12 (SDG12). It was at this site that microblades were found along with diverse artifacts: needles, awls, and a <b>bone</b> <b>knife</b> handle. This handle is a big indicator that microblades were used for multiple purposes, and no longer were exclusive to hunting. In at least one site in Northern China, microblades are also found in context with heat shattered and burned stone, usually evidence for stone-boiling practices, another resource intensification strategy aimed at recovering more nutrients from a food resource via cooking.|$|R

40|$|Introduction. Intraosseous {{vascular}} malformation {{could be}} life-threatening due to uncontrolled hemorrhage after tooth extraction. According to biological behavior of this lesion, adequate diagnostic and treatment strategies are {{necessary in order}} to avoid possible complications. We reported cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) planning of an urgent en bloc resection of an intraosseous venous malformation by piezoelectric knife. Case report. A 55 -year-old man was submitted to CBCT planning followed by piezoelectric knife resection of an intraosseous focal venous malformation of the mandibular body. Immediate reconstruction of the defect using iliac bone free graft was performed. The surgical treatment was uneventful and a 2 -year follow-up revealed no signs of recurrence. Conclusion. Piezoelectric knife could provide precise, safe and bloodless procedure which is especially important in this pathology. Advantages of this technique are: lower risk of damaging soft tissue structures, precise osteotomy and bloodless surgery. Moreover, using piezosurgery <b>bone</b> <b>knife,</b> blood transfusion and blood transmitted diseases could be avoided. This case highlights the importance of CBCT as planning tool for resection of the mandible, using piezoelectric knife as safe method to achieve bloodless surgery.
