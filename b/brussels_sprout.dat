5|$|The series—presented {{as if it}} were a real documentary—depicts the {{everyday}} lives of office employees in the Scranton, Pennsylvania, branch of the fictional Dunder Mifflin Paper Company. In this episode, everyone in the office is excited when international promos for the documentary surface, but are soon horrified to discover how much candid filming has taken place. While everyone panics about their secrets being revealed, Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) reflects upon how much she and Jim (John Krasinski) have changed over the past nine years. Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) makes Angela Lipton (Angela Kinsey) jealous when he starts dating a <b>Brussels</b> <b>sprout</b> farmer. Meanwhile, at Athlead's office in Philadelphia, Jim and Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) have a big meeting with baseball player Ryan Howard, who pitches a bizarre sci-fi sports movie about himself.|$|E
5|$|Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) starts {{dating a}} <b>Brussels</b> <b>sprout</b> farmer, Esther Bruegger (Nora Kirkpatrick), while {{negotiating}} {{the purchase of}} a tractor with her father Henry (Allan Havey). Dwight does poorly in the negotiations, yielding to all of Henry's terms. During the haggling, Esther's sisters flirt with Clark Green (Clark Duke) and try to coax him into buying farming equipment. Clark stops Dwight from signing the papers and takes him aside to tell him that he thinks Esther and her sisters are too physically attractive to be interested in men like them, and that Esther is probably just dating him so that her father can take advantage of him on the tractor deal. Dwight sees the logic in Clark's suspicion. However, Esther appears and tells Dwight that he should not sign the contract and negotiate for a better deal. Dwight realizes that Esther does care for him after all, much to Angela's dismay.|$|E

The best quality <b>Brussels</b> <b>sprouts</b> are produced in sunny weather conditions, but high temperatures (over 65 ° F) result in poor quality produce.

6000|$|De Candolle (28/12. 'Geographie Botan.' 1855 page 989.) has fully {{discussed}} the antiquity of various races of plants; {{he states that}} the black seeded poppy was known {{in the time of}} Homer, the white-seeded sesamum by the ancient Egyptians, and almonds with sweet and bitter kernels by the Hebrews; but it does not seem improbable that some of these varieties may have been lost and reappeared. One variety of barley and apparently one of wheat, both of which were cultivated at an immensely remote period by the Lake-inhabitants of Switzerland, still exist. It is said (28/13. Pickering 'Races of Man' 1850 page 318.) that [...] "specimens of a small variety of gourd which is still common in the market of Lima were exhumed from an ancient cemetery in Peru." [...] De Candolle remarks that, in the books and drawings of the sixteenth century, the principal races of the cabbage, turnip, and gourd can be recognised: this might have been expected at so late a period, but whether any of these plants are absolutely identical with our present sub-varieties is not certain. It is, however, said that the <b>Brussels</b> <b>sprout,</b> a variety which in some places is liable to degeneration, has remained genuine for more than four centuries in the district where it is believed to have originated.

6000|$|In {{these two}} cases flowers were fertilised with pollen from a {{distinct}} variety, {{and this was}} shown to be prepotent by {{the character of the}} offspring. Nearly similar results often follow when two or more self-fertile varieties are allowed to grow near one another and are visited by insects. The common cabbage produces a large number of flowers on the same stalk, and when insects are excluded these set many capsules, moderately rich in seeds. I planted a white Kohl-rabi, a purple Kohl-rabi, a Portsmouth broccoli, a <b>Brussels</b> <b>sprout,</b> and a Sugar-loaf cabbage near together and left them uncovered. Seeds collected from each kind were sown in separate beds; and the majority of the seedlings in all five beds were mongrelised in the most complicated manner, some taking more after one variety, and some after another. The effects of the Kohl-rabi were particularly plain in the enlarged stems of many of the seedlings. Altogether 233 plants were raised, of which 155 were mongrelised in the plainest manner, and of the remaining 78 not half were absolutely pure. I repeated the experiment by planting near together two varieties of cabbage with purple-green and white-green lacinated leaves; and of the 325 seedlings raised from the purple-green variety, 165 had white-green and 160 purple-green leaves. Of the 466 seedlings raised from the white-green variety, 220 had purple-green and 246 white-green leaves. These cases show how largely pollen from a neighbouring variety of the cabbage effaces the action of the plant's own pollen. We should bear in mind that pollen must be carried by the bees from flower to flower on the same large branching stem much more abundantly than from plant to plant; {{and in the case of}} plants the flowers of which are in some degree dichogamous, those on the same stem would be of different ages, and would thus be as ready for mutual fertilisation as the flowers on distinct plants, were it not for the prepotency of pollen from another variety. (10/36. A writer in the 'Gardeners' Chronicle' 1855 page 730, says that he planted a bed of turnips (Brassica rapa) and of rape (B. napus) close together, and sowed the seeds of the former. The result was that scarcely one seedling was true to its kind, and several closely resembled rape.) ...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the chemoprotective effects of <b>Brussels</b> <b>sprouts</b> juice towards benzo[a]pyrene (B(a) P) -induced DNA damage in the single-cell gel electrophoresis (SCGE) /Hep G 2 test system. This assay combines the advantages of the SCGE assay with that of the use of human-derived cells possessing inducible phase I and phase 11 enzymes. Co-treatment of Hep G 2 cells with small amounts of <b>Brussels</b> <b>sprouts</b> juice (0. 25 - 2. 0 mul/ml) and B(a) P reduced the genotoxic effect of the latter in a dose-dependent manner. Contrary to the results with the crude juice, unexpected synergistic effects were observed with allyl isothiocyanate (AITC, 1. 0 - 6. 0 muM), a breakdown product of sinigrin, which is the most abundant glucosinolate in <b>Brussels</b> <b>sprouts.</b> Although these concentrations of AITC did not cause DNA damage per se, at higher concentrations (greater than or equal to 25 muM), the compound caused a pronounced dose-dependent DNA damage by itself. Mechanistic studies showed that <b>Brussels</b> <b>sprouts</b> juice causes induction of activities of ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase (EROD) and glutathione S-transferase (GST) at dose levels which were protective towards B(a) P. In combined treatment experiments with (+/-) -anti-benzo[a]pyrene- 7, 8 -dihydrodiol- 9, 10 -epoxide (BPDE, 5. 0 muM), the main genotoxic metabolite of B(a) P, and <b>Brussels</b> <b>sprouts</b> juice, only weak protection was found indicating that the mechanism of chemoprotection of <b>Brussels</b> <b>sprouts</b> is not mediated through inactivation of this metabolite. In conclusion, our findings show that <b>Brussels</b> <b>sprouts</b> are highly protective against B(a) P-induced DNA damage in human-derived cells. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.
