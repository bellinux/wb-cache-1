5|$|A typical year in {{the life}} of a Senate {{legislation}} committee will see it conduct eight days of hearings around <b>budget</b> <b>estimates,</b> in three sessions: February (additional estimates), May/June (the main <b>budget</b> <b>estimates)</b> and October/November (supplementary <b>budget</b> <b>estimates).</b> In addition, it will typically conduct several inquiries into pieces of legislation being considered by the parliament. A references committee will conduct inquiries into policy issues referred to it by the Senate. Each of these inquiries will usually result in a report tabled in the Senate (there may be exceptions if an election intervenes during the committee's deliberations). A consolidated list of the reports prepared by all Senate committees since 1970 is published by the Department of the Senate.|$|E

5|$|These {{reforms were}} also {{significant}} {{in that they}} gave to Senate committees the role of examining the budget (what {{is referred to as}} the estimates process or estimates hearings), which had hitherto been confined to the Senate and its committee of the whole. The role of the committees was enhanced by three subsequent developments. First, in 1982 the Scrutiny of Bills Committee was established, which, in examining all bills, played a role that complemented that of the examination of all delegated legislation by the Regulations and Ordinances Committee. Second, in 1989 the Senate adopted procedures for the systematic referral of bills to committees, increasing the level of legislative scrutiny taking place within parliament. Third, in 1993, the committees adopted a more extensive procedure for consideration of the budget, creating a second opportunity each year for Senators to follow up issues identified during the initial <b>budget</b> <b>estimates</b> hearings. These second hearings are referred to as supplementary <b>budget</b> <b>estimates.</b> Though the committee system was restructured in 1994, 2006 and again in 2009, the range of functions has remained essentially the same.|$|E
25|$|A 2006 {{article in}} the journal Nature noted a study in 1984 by the Space Science Board, which {{estimated}} that a next generation infrared observatory would cost $4 billion (about $7 billion in 2006 dollars).

The Veterans Health Care Budget Reform and Transparency Act of 2009 requires GAO to assess whether the funding requested for VA health care in the President's budget requests submitted to Congress in 2011, 2012, and 2013 is consistent with VA's estimates of the resources needed to provide health care services. In anticipation of these future studies, GAO was asked to obtain information on how VA prepares its health care <b>budget</b> <b>estimate.</b> In this report, GAO describes (1) how VA develops its health care <b>budget</b> <b>estimate,</b> and (2) how VA's health care <b>budget</b> <b>estimate</b> is used in the President's budget request to Congress.

25|$|The JWST has {{a history}} of major cost overruns and delays which have {{resulted}} from outside factors such as delays in deciding on a launch vehicle and adding extra funding for contingencies. The first <b>budget</b> <b>estimates</b> were that the observatory would cost $1.6 billion and launch in 2011, but NASA has now scheduled the telescope for a 2019 launch on a budget that has grown to $8.8 billion. In 2011, the United States House of Representatives voted to terminate funding, after about $3 billion had been spent and 75% of its hardware was in production. Funding was restored and capped at $8 billion. , the telescope remained on schedule for a spring 2019 launch and within the 2011 revised budget. One of the reasons why the cost grew so much is {{that it is difficult to}} forecast the cost of development, and in general budget predictability improved when initial development milestones were achieved.|$|E
25|$|Tanaka {{initially}} planned out 50 songs, {{but this}} was far too many to record and fit into the game within allotted time and <b>budget</b> <b>estimates,</b> so the number was cut down to 24. The number was further cut down toe seven, but Hiroi was brought close to tears by this. Faced with this issue, Tanaka asked how much music the team could manage, {{and was told that}} one CD's worth of content was enough. Tanaka eventually settled on between eleven and twelve songs which made it into the final game. The lyrics of all the songs were written by Hiroi, despite his repeated protests about not being a professional lyricist. Due to Hiroi's self-professed inexperience, Tanaka ended up being a teacher figure for him. As part of his training, Hiroi went to karaoke sessions, studied the work of famous songwriter Yū Aku, and bought old records of vintage songs. The learning process took between one and two months before Hiroi was competent at writing song lyrics. The songs of Sakura Wars all started with Hiroi creating the lyrics and then handing his work to Tanaka for polishing and to be set to music.|$|E

40|$|A {{model for}} {{estimating}} the cost {{required to do}} a cost estimate for Deep Space Network (DSN) projects that range from $ 0. 1 to $ 100 million is presented. The cost of the cost estimate in thousands of dollars, C(sub E), {{is found to be}} approximately given by C(sub E) = K((C(sub p)) (sup 0. 35)) where C(sub p) is the cost of the project being estimated in millions of dollars and K is a constant depending on the accuracy of the estimate. For an order-of-magnitude estimate, K = 24; for a <b>budget</b> <b>estimate,</b> K = 60; and for a definitive estimate, K = 115. That is, for a specific project, the cost of doing a <b>budget</b> <b>estimate</b> is about 2. 5 times as much as that for an order-of-magnitude estimate, and a definitive estimate costs about twice as much as a <b>budget</b> <b>estimate.</b> Use of this model should help provide the level of resources required for doing cost estimates and, as a result, provide insights towards more accurate estimates with less potential for cost overruns...|$|R
