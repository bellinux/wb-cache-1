[...] "I didn't {{think he was}} the prototype leadoff hitter, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>guy</b> proved me wrong", Washington said. [...] "He'll take a walk, or get one run for us with one swing of the bat. He can bunt, he can run, and he can hit {{the ball to the}} other side." ...|$|E
500|$|In December 2010, {{the band}} began {{composing}} songs {{together for the}} first time. They announced on December 20 that they would go to Orlando, Florida to record a full-length debut album over a period of two months with a tentative release date of the first quarter of 2011.

500|$|Urlacher dislocated {{his wrist}} in the 2009 season opener against the Packers. He {{underwent}} surgery, {{and went on}} to miss the remainder of the season. [...] Urlacher had severely damaged a bone in his wrist that was adjacent to a major nerve. Urlacher was forced to wear a cast on his wrist for 12 weeks and spend a month in therapy to recover from the injury. The Bears began to struggle on offense and defense. As frustration built, Urlacher criticized the Bears offense, stating that the addition of quarterback Jay Cutler had changed the team's identity. The Bears, who have historically employed a strong running game, were beginning to rely more on the pass on offense. He went on to say, [...] "Kyle Orton might not be the flashiest quarterback, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>guy</b> is a winner, and that formula worked for us. I hate to say it, but that's the truth." [...] Urlacher and Cutler later made amends. The Bears finished the season with a 7–9 record, and missed the playoffs for the third consecutive year.|$|E

500|$|Rhys forces Erin {{to miss a}} {{class and}} Barber {{revealed}} that Rhys feels no guilt about what he has done. He quipped [...] "His plan is falling into place perfectly. You'll see that Kate later tries to tell Erin what Rhys is up to. <b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>guy</b> is a charmer {{and is able to}} make Erin believe that Kate is the one with the problem."

[...] Erin quits the program, giving Rhys the chance to successfully apply for her place.|$|E
2500|$|While the {{departure}} of Arkansas would hasten {{the demise of the}} SWC altogether in the longer term, it immediately consigned the conference—one not regarded as a significant player in college basketball for several decades—to virtual irrelevance in the college basketball landscape. Texas would play just three games against ranked conference opponents—all against the same team, and all occurring in the same season—in the remaining five seasons of the league's existence. Houston was the only remaining program that had resided among the nation's elite in recent years, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>Guy</b> Lewis era had ended six years prior, and UH had only advanced to the NCAA Tournament twice—winning no games on either occasion—since its famed [...] "Phi Slama Jama" [...] teams had reached three consecutive Final Fours and two national championship games from 1982 to 1984. Penders' revived Texas program, by default, became the weakened SWC's bell cow, winning or sharing three of the final five SWC championships.|$|E

5000|$|He {{also worked}} with Marciano to shorten his punches and narrow his stance. Goldman tied Marciano's ankles {{together}} with a string to help him to narrow his stance. He taught him to throw combinations, rather than one big bomb at a time. Although the finished product was still crude and clumsy, compared to the style of many boxers, Marciano became a formidable offensive and defensive fighter.

50|$|According to {{lead singer}} Sully Erna, {{the song is}} {{about a guy who}} was his friend. When Godsmack became popular, the guy was going with Erna to clubs and parties. They quit hanging out as much <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>guy</b> {{continued}} to go out to places where people knew that he knew the band. He would hang out in the VIP rooms and tell people that Godsmack was coming. Toward the end of the night, he would make up an excuse as to why Godsmack wasn't showing up. Sully Erna felt betrayed by somebody using his name and image to acquire their own fame.|$|E
5000|$|Mickey may {{be based}} on Charley Goldman. Both were bantamweights, had Jewish ancestry, and have similar-sounding names. In addition, Goldman was the boxing trainer of Rocky Marciano, on whom Rocky Balboa is based. Goldman trained Marciano in many ways similar to how Goldmill trained Balboa, such as tying their ankles {{together}} with string {{to teach them to}} spread their feet at the appropriate width. Goldman was (again like Goldmill) well known for making wise remarks (ex. [...] "A lot of people say Rocky Marciano don't look too good in there, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>guy</b> on the ground don't look too good either.").|$|E
