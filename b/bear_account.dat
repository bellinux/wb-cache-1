A joint study by the University of Oxford and Lausanne's Cantonal Museum of Zoology and published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B in 2014, the team used a previously published cleaning method to remove all surface contamination and the ribosomal mitochondrial DNA 12S fragment of the sample was sequenced and then compared to GenBank to identify the species origin.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} how historical and geographical relations of injustice are ‘made present’ through {{the activities of}} the City of Sanctuary network in Sheffield, the UK. In so doing, it exposes the limitations of conceptualising and enacting sanctuary through the frame of hospitality, and proposes an analytics of ‘rightful presence’ as an alternative frame by which to address contemporary sanctuary practices. In contrast to a body of scholarship and activism that has focused on hospitably as potentially extending the bounds of citizenship to ‘include’ those seeking refuge, we consider how the ‘minor’ politics of City of Sanctuary potentially trouble the assumptions on which such claims to inclusion rest. Specifically, we claim that an analysis that pays attention to the ‘minor’ politics of sanctuary raises questions about the statist relations of guest-host that such an approach takes as its starting point. The paper develops this argument by emphasising the importance of practices that ‘make present’ injustices. This is conceived of as important in bringing to <b>bear</b> an <b>account</b> of justice that is grounded in concrete political struggles, in contrast to the more abstract notion of a justice ‘to come’. To explore sanctuary practices through a relational account of justice, we thus conclude, brings to <b>bear</b> a politically-attuned <b>account</b> of rightful presence in terms that challenge pastoral relations of guest-host as well as the statist framing of sanctuary with which such relations are intimately bound...|$|R

This paper models the modulation effects of bearing faults on the stator currents of a direct-drive wind turbine equipped with a permanent-magnet synchronous generator (PMSG) operating with a variable shaft rotating frequency. Based on the analysis, a method consisting of appropriate current frequency and amplitude demodulation algorithms and a 1 P-invariant power spectrum density algorithm is proposed for bearing fault diagnosis of variable-speed direct-drive wind turbines using only one-phase stator current measurements, where 1 P frequency stands for the shaft rotating frequency of a wind turbine. Experimental results on a direct-drive wind turbine equipped with a PMSG operating in a wind tunnel are provided to verify the proposed fault diagnosis method. The proposed method is demonstrated to have advantages over the method of directly using stator current measurements for WTG bearing fault diagnosis...|$|R

In this paper, the bearing faults are estimated by means of current frequency spectral subtraction using discrete wavelet transform. In addition to this, the current signature analysis after spectral subtraction is carried out using Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), Stationary Wavelet Transform (SWT) and Wavelet Packet Decomposition (WPD) and a comparative analysis is presented to estimate fault severity using statistical parameters.
