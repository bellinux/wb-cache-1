25|$|However, the War Office {{judged the}} Tett turret {{to be too}} cramped and not {{bulletproof}} against heavy fire, its isolated nature did not allow adequate command and control and the open top was vulnerable to a well-thrown grenade.

Burbridge went <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>drawing</b> <b>board</b> and came up with a new version that instead of being positioned over a pipe was placed on a concrete slab over an underground chamber of brick or concrete slabs.

25|$|After {{analyzing}} {{hundreds of}} designs, and finally {{coming up with}} what {{was believed to be}} the best design, Bostich finally released the nail in 2005 and labeled it the Sheather Plus. Even though the new nail was stronger than most nails, the barbs, which added the much needed strength to the nail's holding power, weakened the strength of the joint by opening the hole too far. This caused the joint to be sloppy and wobbly, so the team went <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>drawing</b> <b>board</b> where the final feature was added to the nail. To compensate for the extra width of the nail hole, due to the ring shanks, Sutt decided to add a thicker screw-shank to the portion of the nail directly under the head. This addition thickened the top portion of the nail giving it a tighter joint, as well as enhancing its overall holding power.|$|E
25|$|Munroe {{had then}} made a {{business}} out of making lead pencils. He made the graphite formula for his pencils in secret, with only {{the help of his}} wife. The business was quite successful. By 1814 he had made nearly 175,000 pencils, which sold for about six thousand dollars, a very large amount of money at the time. When the war with England ended there were better pencils available from Europe and his profits were erased by these better imports. Munroe figured it was pointless to try to compete against these superior products so took up his normal trade of cabinet-making. He also made tooth brushes and watchmaker's brushes, also the first made in the United States. During this interim time he went <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>drawing</b> <b>board</b> to do further experimenting with his secret lead pencil paste. One thing led to another until he came up with a powdered graphite paste product that would make its mark.|$|E

[...] The USS O'Brien was fitted with receiving equipment {{and attempted to}} follow the cable out of the Channel. Unfortunately, it was unable to detect a signal past the 1,000 foot mark, where {{a break in the}} cable prevented the signal from continuing. [...] The break in the cable was repaired, but {{over the course of the}} winter of 1919-1920, crews found that the cable had broken in a total of fifty-two different places due to the strain placed on it while it was being laid. The damage was irreparable. [...] Going <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>drawing</b> <b>board,</b> engineers tested 150-foot segments of three different types of cable and used the results to design a new full-size pilot cable.
