40|$|The paper {{analyses}} {{the cost}} and effectiveness of bank restructuring policies in 11 transition countries during 1991 - 98. It argues that country-specific banking sector features, the size of bad loans inherited from the centrally planned system, and weaknesses in the restructuring policies implemented were the main factors affecting the overall fiscal costs, with the latter two being more significant. The paper finds no significant relationship between the size of restructuring costs and overall improvement in banking sector performance for the sample countries as a whole.

Especially for life insurance companies, the current low interest rate environment poses a key risk since declining returns on investments jeopardize the guaranteed return on life insurance contracts, a core component of traditional life insurance contracts in several European countries. I consider a contingent claim framework with a direct financial connection between banks and life insurers via <b>bank</b> <b>bonds.</b> The results indicate that life insurers' demand for <b>bank</b> <b>bonds</b> increases over the mid-term but ultimately declines in the long-run. Since life insurers are the largest purchasers of <b>bank</b> <b>bonds</b> in Europe, <b>banks</b> could lose one of their main funding sources. In addition, I show that shareholder value driven life insurers' appetite for risk increases when the gap between asset return and liability growth diminishes. To check the robustness of the findings, I calibrate a prolonged low interest rate scenario. The results show that the insurer's risk appetite is even higher when interest rates remain persistently low. A sensitivity analysis regarding industry-specific regulatory safety levels reveals that contagion between bank and life insurer is driven by the insurers' demand for <b>bank</b> <b>bonds</b> which itself depends on the regulatory safety level of banks...|$|R

40|$|In {{this thesis}} the {{behavior}} of banks in financial markets which banks frequently use to obtain short-term as well as long-term financing is studied. In the first chapter we incorporate an interbank market for collateralized lending among banks into a dynamic, stochastic, general equilibrium (DSGE) framework to analyze the impact of variations in the expected value of the collateral on the interbank lending volume. We find that a central bank which decides to lower the haircut on eligible collateral in repurchase agreements is able to stimulate interbank markets. In the second chapter a microeconomic model of bank behavior on the interbank market is set up to analyze the impact of risk-taking behavior of interbank borrowing banks and uncertainty about their balance sheet quality on the lending behavior of interbank lending banks. It is found that the disruptions on the interbank market {{are the result of}} optimal behavior on the part of interbank lending banks in response to the uncertainty about the balance sheet quality of an interbank borrowing bank. In the third chapter we use monthly data on German <b>bank</b> <b>bond</b> spreads and regress it on bank-specific risk factors to assess the degree of market discipline in the German <b>bank</b> <b>bond</b> market. The regression results for the whole German <b>bank</b> <b>bond</b> market indicate that the bond spread does not show signs of market discipline.

To estimate the multifactor latent structure, we link the market risk (the covariance of the LCFIs'' equity) to credit risk (the default probability of the CDS basket) in a coherent manner. In addition, to analyze the response of the probabilities of default to changing macroeconomic conditions, we run a stress test by generating shocks to the latent multifactor structure. The results unveil a rich set of default probability dynamics and help in identifying the most relevant sources of risk. We anticipate that this approach could be of value to financial supervisors and risk managers alike.

Using spreads on nearly 500 <b>bank</b> <b>bond</b> issues between 1993 and 1998, this paper investigates {{the relationship between the}} spreads on those bonds and the full portfolio of assets held by the issuing bank. Our results show that bond spreads reflect the overall mix of banks ’ assets at the time of issuance, even after controlling for the standard measures of risk and performance used in earlier studies. Banks contemplating a shift into riskier activities like trading, for example, can expect to pay higher spreads as a result. Credit card and commercial and industrial lending also carry a penalty in terms of higher spreads. Overall, these results suggest that investors do price the ex ante credit and other risks implicit in banks’ asset portfolios. Their vigilance should help to deter excessive or inefficient risk taking by banks...|$|E
