5|$|The {{international}} space station Horizon sends a distress signal to the ISIS agency, stating that the spaceship has been under attack. Anthony Drake (Bryan Cranston), {{the commander of the}} station, has urged ISIS to assist the crew in controlling the situation. A reluctant Lana Kane (Aisha Tyler) is the first one to voice concern over the issue, as none of them have undergone training in preparation for a flight. Despite these concerns, Malory Archer (Jessica Walter) is quick to take the job for financial gain. The field agents of ISIS—except Sterling Archer (H. Jon Benjamin), who is <b>being</b> <b>evaluated</b> by Doctor Algernop Krieger (Lucky Yates) for medical purposes—are subjected to basic astronaut regimens in anticipation for the flight, including a flight simulator (which Archer makes Cyril crash), and weightlessness training, which causes Lana to vomit copiously {{because of the lack of}} gravity.|$|E
5|$|The use of {{antimicrobial}} peptides against P. acnes {{is under}} investigation {{as a treatment for}} acne to overcoming antibiotic resistance. In 2007, the first genome sequencing of a P. acnes bacteriophage (PA6) was reported. The authors proposed applying this research toward development of bacteriophage therapy as an acne treatment in order to overcome the problems associated with long-term antibiotic therapy such as bacterial resistance. Oral and topical probiotics are also <b>being</b> <b>evaluated</b> as treatments for acne. Probiotics have been hypothesized to have therapeutic effects for those affected by acne due to their ability to decrease skin inflammation and improve skin moisture by increasing the skin's ceramide content. As of 2014, studies examining the effects of probiotics on acne in humans were limited.|$|E

40|$|Fear of {{negative}} evaluations from others {{is known to}} consist of fears of <b>being</b> negatively <b>evaluated</b> by friends, by parents, and by teachers. This study investigates the roles of parental attitudes and social experiences in controlling such fears. Fifth- through ninth-grade students (N= 350) participated in a questionnaire survey. Multiple-group structural equation modeling of the responses was conducted to investigate gender differences within {{a model of the}} relationships between this fear and its controlling factors. The results indicate that the model is applicable for both genders. They also reveal that autonomy-granting parenting is negatively correlated factor against fears {{of negative}} evaluations by parents. Accordingly, such parenting may be an effective controlling factor against fears of negative evaluations from parents. On the other hand, the results also indicate that there were no significant relationships between experiences of being accepted by parents, peers or teachers and fears of <b>being</b> negatively <b>evaluated</b> by others. Thus, this study failed to illuminate any social experiences that can control the fears of <b>being</b> negatively <b>evaluated</b> by others...|$|R

For example, zirconium is a primary component of the sorbent column dependent dialysate regeneration and recirculation system known as the REDY system, which was first introduced in 1973. More than 2,000,000 dialysis treatments have been performed using the sorbent column in the REDY system. Although the REDY system was superseded in the 1990s by less expensive alternatives, new sorbent-based dialysis systems are <b>being</b> <b>evaluated</b> and approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Renal Solutions developed the DIALISORB technology, a portable, low water dialysis system.

5|$|In 1974, Thomas Henry Flewett {{suggested}} the name rotavirus after observing that, when viewed through an electron microscope, a rotavirus particle {{looks like a}} wheel (rota in Latin); the name was officially recognised by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses four years later. In 1976, related viruses were described in several other species of animals. These viruses, all causing acute gastroenteritis, were recognised as a collective pathogen affecting humans and animals worldwide. Rotavirus serotypes were first described in 1980, and in the following year, rotavirus from humans was first grown in cell cultures derived from monkey kidneys, by adding trypsin (an enzyme found in the duodenum of mammals and now known to be essential for rotavirus to replicate) to the culture medium. The ability to grow rotavirus in culture accelerated the pace of research, and by the mid-1980s the first candidate vaccines were <b>being</b> <b>evaluated.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Police Directorate {{sees the}} use of the {{encrypted}} communication as the system's greatest benefit, and has stated that it sees no reason for the implementation to stop while it is <b>being</b> <b>evaluated,</b> and that there is no alternative to implementing it nationally. The system was first taken into use in Østfold and Follo in December 2009, and by Oslo in March 2010. In Oslo, the police chose to close the analog network down before the TETRA system had been installed in all vehicles, and instead give all officers hand-held devices, to speed up the closing of the old network, which is regarded as a security hazard. Traditionally, journalists have learned about events by listening to the police radios. The police have appointed press officers who will inform the press about newsworthy incidents. The alarm center for the fire departments in Østfold and Follo started using the system in June 2010.|$|E

40|$|The {{paper offers}} a scientific-phylosophical {{reflection}} on the ecological relations among living <b>beings,</b> <b>evaluated</b> {{in the framework of}} Darwinian evolutionism. Starting with the fact of extinction as a recurrent factor in the history of life, we point out the possible human role in the massive loss of biodiversity we can observe at present time. Then we try to introduce the basis for a behavioural change which would allow us to stop this process. Our argument is centred on the crucial concept of dependence as primary condition of life: as a result, we can reach a new idea about the identity of a living being, intended in a specific ecological value. This innovative concept of identity may represent, for human beings, the starting point {{for the development of a}} more conscious behaviour, both on moral and ecological perspective...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Acoustic sonic and {{ultrasonic}} resonance {{analysis is}} a new non-destructive testing technique that allows 100 % testing {{of a wide range}} of test objects quickly and at low cost. After an impact, a specimen vibrates in certain characteristic modes and frequencies that can be measured by a microphone or laser vibrometer. Typical faults that can be detected are cracks, cavities, detached layers, material inconsistencies, hardness deviation and nodularity in iron castings. This test method supplements the volume-oriented NDT methods and possesses some important advantages. Introduction: Sound testing by tapping a specimen is said to be one of the oldest NDT methods and still used in many applications, not only with chinaware or glassware. In all cases human <b>beings</b> <b>evaluate</b> the sound subjectively on the basis of their experience. In mass production this procedure is � far too costly, � not reliable, especially with safety parts and in loud environments...|$|R
