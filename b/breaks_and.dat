5|$|Murphy {{has been}} outspoken about several other of his rivals, criticising them for having too many toilet <b>breaks</b> <b>and</b> {{complaining}} about table conditions among other things. Murphy also makes collective criticisms {{of his fellow}} professionals for not attending events and has branded other players' concerns over prize money as a joke. Murphy's harshest criticism has been reserved for Ronnie O'Sullivan. Murphy highlights what he perceives to be O'Sullivan's lack of professionalism.|$|E
5|$|On February 17, 2009, Obama {{signed the}} American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, a $787billion {{economic}} stimulus package aimed at helping the economy recover from the deepening worldwide recession.

The most common penalty imposed on an offender convicted of <b>break</b> <b>and</b> enter was a prison sentence. Prison penalties were imposed on 64 per cent of offenders {{convicted of a}}n aggravated <b>break</b> <b>and</b> enter offence and 49 per cent of offenders convicted of a non-aggravated <b>break</b> <b>and</b> enter offence. The average aggregate sentence for aggravated <b>break</b> <b>and</b> enter was 40 months, with an average minimum term of 22 months.

5|$|Work on Siti Akbari was {{completed}} {{over a period}} of several years. Lie stated that the story had taken him three years, writing sporadically. Tio, however, reports rumours that the writing took some seven years, with Lie sometimes taking long <b>breaks</b> <b>and</b> sometimes writing in a fervor, writing from dawn until dusk.|$|E
5|$|After DNA damage, {{cell cycle}} checkpoints are activated. Checkpoint {{activation}} pauses the cell cycle {{and gives the}} cell time {{to repair the damage}} before continuing to divide. DNA damage checkpoints occur at the G1/S and G2/M boundaries. An intra-S checkpoint also exists. Checkpoint activation is controlled by two master kinases, ATM and ATR. ATM responds to DNA double-strand <b>breaks</b> <b>and</b> disruptions in chromatin structure, whereas ATR primarily responds to stalled replication forks. These kinases phosphorylate downstream targets in a signal transduction cascade, eventually leading to cell cycle arrest. A class of checkpoint mediator proteins including BRCA1, MDC1, and 53BP1 has also been identified. These proteins seem to be required for transmitting the checkpoint activation signal to downstream proteins.|$|E
5|$|Human {{productivity}} routinely {{decreases in}} the afternoon. Power plants have shown significant reductions in productivity {{in the afternoon}} compared to the morning, the largest differences occurring on Saturdays and the smallest on Mondays. One 1950s study covering two female factory workers for six months found that their productivity was 13 percent lower in the afternoon, the least productive time being their last hour at work. It was summarized that the differences came from personal <b>breaks</b> <b>and</b> unproductive activities at the workplace. Another, larger study found that afternoon declines in productivity were greater during longer work shifts.|$|E

5|$|In {{the next}} over, Compton greatly troubled Bradman, who edged two balls and was dropped once. At the other end, Morris {{continued}} {{to take advantage}} of Hutton's inaccurate leg <b>breaks,</b> <b>and</b> Australia reached lunch at 1/121, with the opener on 63 and his captain on 35. Hutton had conceded 30 runs in four overs, and in the half-hour preceding the interval, Australia had added 64 runs. Although Australia had scored at a reasonable rate, they had also been troubled by many of the deliveries and were expected to face further difficulty if they were to avoid defeat.|$|E
5|$|One of Fletcher's {{priorities}} {{that was}} not resolved during the session was the correction of unintended tax increases on businesses that resulted from the tax reform plan passed in 2005. Fletcher called a special legislative session for mid-June so that the legislature could amend the plan and also authorize tax breaks designed to lure a proposed FutureGen power plant to Henderson. Republican Senate President David L. Williams asked Fletcher to include tax breaks for other businesses as well, but Fletcher insisted on a sparse legislative agenda. The session convened for five days and passed the tax <b>breaks</b> <b>and</b> amended tax reform plan unanimously in both houses. Fletcher applauded the legislature's efficiency.|$|E
5|$|The 808 was {{the first}} drum machine {{with the ability to}} program an entire {{percussion}} track from beginning to end, complete with <b>breaks</b> <b>and</b> rolls. It includes volume knobs for each voice, numerous audio outputs, and a DIN sync port (a precursor to MIDI) to synchronize with other devices through the Digital Control Bus interface, which was considered groundbreaking. The machine has three trigger outputs, which can be used to synchronize with synthesizers and other equipment.|$|E

5|$|The Test series {{moved to}} Lord's. Miller resumed bowling, sending down 42overs {{and taking a}} total of 1/74. He managed 25 in the first innings, but {{promoted}} to number three in the second innings, he batted patiently to reach stumps before reaching his first Test century on English soil the following morning, but England held on for a draw. More {{than half of the}} Third Test at Old Trafford was washed out, resulting in another draw. Miller took 1/38 bowling fast off <b>breaks</b> <b>and</b> scored 17 and six. Australia then played Middlesex at Lord's, where Miller scored a hard-hitting 71.|$|E
5|$|The codex {{consists}} of parchment, originally in double sheets, {{which may have}} measured about 40 by 70cm. The whole codex consists, with a few exceptions, of quires of eight leaves, a format popular throughout the Middle Ages. Each line of the text has some twelve to fourteen Greek uncial letters, arranged in four columns (48 lines per column) with carefully chosen line <b>breaks</b> <b>and</b> slightly ragged right edges. When opened, the eight columns thus presented to the reader have much the same appearance as the succession of columns in a papyrus roll. The poetical books of the Old Testament are written stichometrically, in only two columns per page. The codex has almost 4,000,000 uncial letters.|$|E
5|$|Towards {{the end of}} the session, Rice {{prominently}} {{broke with}} Democrats to oppose the removal of capital gains tax <b>breaks</b> <b>and</b> to oppose granting unemployment benefits to locked-out workers. Rice also sponsored legislation backed by the South Metro Denver Chamber of Commerce to create a hybrid public-private health insurance system to cover all Colorado residents; however, these plans were put on hold after proponents of a single payer health care system advanced their competing proposal in the state legislature.|$|E

5|$|A major concept used in {{the series}} {{was the idea of}} a running clock. This {{initially}} came from Joel Surnow, who wanted the audience to always know what time it was in the show's fictional timeline. This was done by an on-screen digital clock that appears before and after commercial <b>breaks,</b> <b>and</b> a smaller clock also appears at other points in the narrative. The time shown is the in-universe time of the story. When the running clock is shown full screen, an alternating pulsating beeping noise (like the kind seen on a time bomb) for each second can usually be heard. On rare occasions, a silent clock is used. This usually follows the death of a major character or an otherwise dramatic event.|$|E
5|$|Adam, a photographer, awakens in {{a bathtub}} {{in a large}} {{dilapidated}} bathroom, and finds himself chained at the ankle to a pipe. Lawrence Gordon, an oncologist, is similarly shackled across the room, and between them is a corpse holding a revolver and a microcassette recorder. Each man has a tape in his pocket, and Adam is able to retrieve the recorder. Adam's tape urges him to escape the bathroom, while Lawrence's tape tells him to kill Adam by six o'clock, or {{his wife and daughter}} will be killed and he will be left to die. Adam finds a bag containing two hacksaws inside a toilet tank; they attempt to cut through the chains, but Adam's saw <b>breaks</b> <b>and</b> he throws it at the mirror in frustration, revealing a hidden camera behind the mirror. Lawrence realizes that the hacksaws weren't meant for the chains, but for their feet and identifies their captor as the Jigsaw Killer, whom Lawrence knows of because he was a suspect five months before.|$|E
5|$|All {{weapons and}} apparel {{found within the}} Wastelands, {{regardless}} of whether they are a makeshift-weapon such as a lead pipe, or a gun, degrade over time the more they are used, and thus become less effective. For firearms, degrading into poor condition causes them to do less damage and possibly jam when reloading, while apparel that reduces damage becomes less protective as it gradually absorbs damage from attacks. When too much damage is taken, the items <b>breaks</b> <b>and</b> cannot be used. To ensure weapons and apparel are working effectively, such items require constant maintenance and repairs which can be done in one of two ways. The first method is find certain vendors that repair items, though how much they can repair an item depends on their skill level, while the cost of the repairs depends upon the item itself. The second method is for players to find a second of the same item that needs repairs (or a comparable item), and salvaging parts from it for the repair, though how much they can do depends on their character's own skill level in repairs.|$|E

5|$|Diagnosis and {{treatment}} cost patients money, and the player can change hospital policy, including {{the amount of}} diagnosis patients require. This can be set to over 100 per cent to force patients to have further unnecessary diagnoses. Other policies include when staff can go on <b>breaks</b> <b>and</b> whether they can leave rooms, and loans can be taken out. From time to time, events such as emergencies (in which patients arrive and must be cured within a time limit or they will die), and epidemics (in which a disease spreads rapidly) occur. During the latter, the player can attempt {{to cover it up}} by curing all affected patients before a health inspector turns up. If the player fails, he or she is fined and must face a damaged reputation, a statistic that shows how well the hospital is doing and affects the flow of patients. VIPs may also occasionally ask to tour the hospital; if impressed, the player is granted a cash bonus, a reputation increase, or both. There is an advisor who keeps the player informed about what is going on. Rats may infest the hospital, and the player is able to shoot them with the cursor.|$|E
5|$|If Crash, Coco or Crunch win the race, Velo, {{having lost}} his {{influence}} over his subjects, dejectedly relinquishes his empire to the Bandicoots. Crash considers becoming the next emperor of the galaxy, but decides otherwise and gives control back to Velo {{in exchange for}} sending the Bandicoots back to Earth. If Cortex, N. Gin or Tiny win the race, Velo struggles with Cortex over the possession of his scepter, only to be stopped by Tiny. Cortex uses the scepter's power {{in an attempt to}} return to Earth, but the scepter <b>breaks</b> <b>and</b> sends Cortex, N. Gin and Tiny to Terra instead. When they are confronted by the natives (all of which resemble Krunk), Tiny repairs the scepter and is subsequently revered as a king, much to Cortex's annoyance.|$|E
5|$|In {{anticipation}} of an NBA team, {{and led by}} Mayor Mick Cornett, who had successfully lobbied for the previous temporary relocation of the New Orleans Hornets to Oklahoma City, the voters of that city approved a $120 million renovation of the Ford Center on March 3, 2008, including {{construction of a new}} NBA practice facility. After a tour of downtown Oklahoma City, a subcommittee of three NBA owners recommended that the league approve the move. On March 14, Bennett reached a preliminary agreement with Oklahoma City on a 15-year lease of the Ford Center that was finalized by the Oklahoma City Council and the Sonics’ ownership group two weeks later. The Oklahoma State Legislature later approved a bill to provide tax <b>breaks</b> <b>and</b> other incentives if the team relocated.|$|E
