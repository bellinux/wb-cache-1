40|$|Abstract. Branch-and-Check, {{introduced}} {{ten years}} ago, is a generaliza-tion of logic-based <b>Benders</b> decomposition. The key extension is {{to solve the}} <b>Benders</b> sub-problems at each feasible solution of the master problem rather than only at an optimal solution. We perform the first systematic empirical comparison of logic-based <b>Benders</b> decomposition and branch-and-check. On four problem types {{the results indicate that}} either <b>Benders</b> or branch-and-check may perform best, depending on the relative diffi-culty of solving the master problem and the sub-problems. We identify a characteristic of the logic-based <b>Benders</b> decomposition runs, the pro-portion of run-time spent solving the master problem, that is valuable in predicting the performance of branch-and-check. We also introduce a variation of branch-and-check to address difficult sub-problems. Empir-ical results show that this variation leads to more robust performance than both logic-based <b>Benders</b> decomposition and branch-and-check on the problems investigated. ...|$|R

In this paper, we compare three sets of inequalities that have been widely used in this context: <b>Benders,</b> metric and cutset inequalities.

We also show how to strengthen <b>Benders</b> inequalities associated to non-extreme rays to obtain metric inequalities. We show that cutset inequalities are <b>Benders</b> inequalities, but not necessarily metric inequalities.

5000|$|Canton's biggest {{years of}} growth {{occurred}} {{around the turn}} of the twentieth century, and Guy Tilden was the city's leading architect of the period. In the 1890s and early 1900s, Tilden favored the Romanesque Revival style, but <b>Bender's</b> represents a transition in his thinking away from revivalism and toward simpler, newer modes of construction. He was responsible for the original <b>Bender's</b> building, constructed in 1899 as the Belmont Buffet, although the present structure is significantly larger than the original building as purchased by the <b>Benders</b> firm in 1908. Soon after obtaining the Belmont, <b>Benders</b> bought two buildings next door, and before long the restaurant had displaced the former occupants, a livery and barbershop.

30|$|In this section, <b>Benders</b> {{decomposition}} algorithm [5] {{is applied}} to solve the mixed integer programming formulation. <b>Benders</b> decomposition is an approach to solve complicated mathematical programming problems by splitting them into a master problem and multiple subproblems that can be solved in parallel.

The classic approach of <b>Benders</b> decomposition algorithm is implemented, and it solves an alternative sequence of master and subproblems.|$|R
5|$|During the 1999 NBA draft, {{believing that}} the Raptors still lacked a strong frontcourt presence, Grunwald traded first-round draft pick Jonathan <b>Bender</b> for power forward Antonio Davis of the Indiana Pacers. Davis quickly entered the Raptors {{starting}} lineup and he would develop into an All-Star in the coming years. Conversely, <b>Bender</b> would only play nine seasons and {{would be out of}} the league by age 29. In the backcourt, Carter, Christie and Dell Curry played at the shooting guard position and Alvin Williams and Muggsy Bogues at point guard. The rotation of Davis, Oakley and Willis in the frontcourt and Carter's and McGrady's improvement helped the team make its first ever playoff appearance, fulfilling a promise Carter had made to fans in the previous season. Lacking significant post-season experience, Toronto was defeated 3–0 by the New York Knicks in the first round. Nonetheless, team improvements and the rise of Carter—who emphatically won the 2000 NBA Slam Dunk Contest—attracted many fans around Toronto, many of whom were previously not basketball fans. The season was also the first full year played at the Air Canada Centre, after having played four years at the cavernous SkyDome, which was better suited to baseball and Canadian football. Overall, the Raptors concluded the season with a 45–37 record.|$|E

40|$|<b>Benders</b> {{decomposition}} is {{a solution}} method for solving certain large-scale optimization problems. Instead of considering all decision variables and constraints of a large-scale problem simultaneously, <b>Benders</b> decomposition partitions the problem into multiple smaller problems. Since computational difficulty of optimization problems increases significantly {{with the number of}} variables and constraints, solving these smaller prob-lems iteratively can be more efficient than solving a single large problem. In this chap-ter, we first formally describe <b>Benders</b> decomposition. We then briefly describe some extensions and generalizations of <b>Benders</b> decomposition. We conclude our chapter by illustrating how the decomposition decomposition works on a problem encountered in Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT) treatment planning and giving a numerical example...|$|R

Computational experiments for randomly generated networks of up to 700 sourcing sites, 100 candidate sites for locating reprocessing facilities, and 50 reclamation facilities are presented. In general, according to our computational results, the <b>Benders</b> decomposition scheme based on the quasi Pareto-optimal cuts outperforms the classical algorithm with valid inequalities...|$|R
