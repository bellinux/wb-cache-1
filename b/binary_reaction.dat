5000|$|The use of {{catalysts}} is {{of paramount}} importance in delivering reliable methods of SiO ALD. Without catalysts, surface reactions leading to the formation of SiO are generally very slow and only occur at exceptionally high temperatures. Typical catalysts for SiO ALD include Lewis bases such as NH or pyridine and SiO ALD can also be initiated when these Lewis bases are coupled with other silicon precursors such as tetraethoxysilane (TEOS). Hydrogen bonding is believed to occur between the Lewis base and the SiOH* surface species or between the HO based reactant and the Lewis base. Oxygen becomes a stronger nucleophile when the Lewis base hydrogen bonds with the SiOH* surface species because the SiO-H bond is effectively weakened. As such, the electropositive Si atom in the SiCl reactant is more susceptible to nucleophilic attack. Similarly, hydrogen bonding between a Lewis base and an HO reactant make the electronegative O in HO a strong nucleophile that is able to attack the Si in an existing SiCl* surface species. The use of a Lewis base catalyst is more or less a requirement for SiO ALD, as without a Lewis base catalyst, reaction temperatures must exceed 325 °C and pressures must exceed 10 torr. Generally, the most favorable temperature to perform SiO ALD is at 32 °C and a common deposition rate is 1.35 Angstroms per <b>binary</b> <b>reaction</b> sequence. Two surface reactions for SiO ALD, an overall reaction, and a schematic illustrating Lewis base catalysis in SiO ALD are provided below.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the production of}} charmed baryons and mesons in the proton-antiproton <b>binary</b> <b>reactions</b> at the energies of the future P̅ANDA experiment.
