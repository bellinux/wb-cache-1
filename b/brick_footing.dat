50|$|The Canberra monocrete {{homes are}} built on brick piers and {{surrounding}} <b>brick</b> <b>footing.</b> All of the walls are of monocrete construction including interior ones. They are precast with steel windows and door frames set directly into the concrete. Steel plates in the ceiling space bolt the individual wall panels together. The floor and roof are of normal construction - wood and tile respectively. The gaps between the wall panels are filled with a flexible gap-filling compound and covered with tape on the interior. Unfortunately the panels tend to move separately to one another, opening up cracks in between them. The houses {{also tend to be}} susceptible to condensation build up and mold growth {{on the inside of the}} walls.|$|E
40|$|In November and December 1991, the Jeffrey L. Brown Institute of Archaeology {{undertook}} a limited testing {{program in the}} casting shed area of the antebellum blast furnace site, Bluff Furnace (40 HA 221). The objectives of the testing were to obtain information concerning the southern limits of the casting shed and to explore additional areas of the casting shed floor. Limestone piers exposed along the south wall line of the casting shed indicate that this wall line was not parallel to the north wall of the shed, and that a doorway or similar opening was present south and west of the furnace base. Partially reduced iron in a pit feature near the wall piers may {{be interpreted as a}} run-off area during the blast failure of November 1860. A test pit in the west central area of the casting shed further exposed a <b>brick</b> <b>footing</b> partially uncovered during excavations in the shed in 1983. Structural similarities with a <b>brick</b> <b>footing</b> exposed in 1981 suggest the brick features were elements of a brick partition wall associated with a room in the northwest corner of the casting shed. This room was probably inexistence during the charcoal-fired furnace operations prior to 1859, but had been abandoned when the coke-fired furnace operations began in 1860. A casting gate present in the casting sand level, found with a concentration of splash iron, indicated some direct iron casting in boxed molds or casting flasks was taking place in the final period of the furnace.

60|$|Our city, though {{laid out}} with a {{beautiful}} regularity, the streets large, straight, and crossing each other at right angles, had the disgrace of suffering those streets to remain long unpaved, and in wet weather the wheels of heavy carriages plowed them into a quagmire, {{so that it was}} difficult to cross them, and in dry weather the dust was offensive. I had lived near what was called the Jersey Market, and saw with pain the inhabitants wading in mud while purchasing their provisions. A strip of ground down the middle of that market was at length paved with brick, so that, being once in the market, they had firm footing, but were often over shoes in dirt to get there. By talking and writing on the subject I was at length instrumental in getting the street paved with stone between the market and the <b>bricked</b> <b>foot</b> pavement that was on each side next the houses. This for some time gave an easy access to the market, dry-shod; but, the rest of the street not being paved, whenever a carriage came out of the mud upon this pavement, it shook off and left its dirt upon it, and it was soon covered with mire, which was not removed, the city as yet having no scavengers.|$|R

50|$|In 1875 French {{financier}} Jean Baptiste Paulin Caperon, {{better known}} as Peter Coutts, purchased land in Mayfield and four other parcels around three sides of today's College Terrace - {{more than a thousand}} acres extending from today's Page Mill Road to Serra Street and from El Camino Real to the foothills. Coutts named his property Ayrshire Farm. His fanciful <b>brick</b> 50 <b>foot</b> tall <b>brick</b> tower near Matadero Creek likely marked the south corner of his property. Leland Stanford started buying land in the area in 1876 for a horse farm, called the Palo Alto Stock Farm. Stanford bought Ayrshire Farm in 1882.|$|R
