25|$|During his {{academic}} years Larramendi met a sister of his university colleague Mariano de Montiano, María de Montiano y Uriarte (1886-1976), originating from Bilbao. Daughter of a physician, descendant to a noble prestigious family {{and considered the}} most handsome girl in the city, she was also fanatically Basque. They married at unspecified time, though prior to 1904; he tended to <b>be</b> <b>quiet</b> <b>and</b> unassuming, she was also introvert, but of a decisive and bold character. The couple settled at Calle Valázquez; they had 9 children, 6 boys and 3 girls. The oldest son, Ignacio Hernando de Larramendi, became known nationwide as longtime manager and the moving spirit behind MAPFRE, a corporate insurance giant; other children did not grow to prominence nationwide.

Then he starts to date Ivy Slade. By the end of Scandal, he and Reed are a couple again. However, halfway through Vanished Reed is forced to break up with Josh, because someone is holding Noelle hostage and is giving Reed tasks to win her life back. Josh is appalled at first, but then later realizes {{that it was the}} kidnappers doing and gets back together with Reed.|$|E
25|$|The {{striping}} {{pattern of}} the zebra is unique among sympatric ungulates. One suggested function for the stripes is to provide crypsis for the animal in tall grass or in the dappled shade beneath bushes and trees. However, cryptically coloured species, such as the kudu and bushbuck, tend to <b>be</b> <b>quiet</b> <b>and</b> stealthy. They freeze when there is danger and flee only at the last moment. By contrast, the zebra is active and noisy, and makes no attempt to hide itself. Another suggestion is motion camouflage, that the stripes affect a predator's judgement of the zebra's size, distance and what direction it is going in. A 2014 study supports this hypothesis, finding that, when moving, the stripes may confuse observers, such as mammalian predators and biting insects, via two visual illusions, the wagon wheel effect, where the perceived motion is inverted, and the barber pole illusion, where the perceived motion is in a wrong direction. A related hypothesis is that the stripes {{make it difficult for}} a predator to single out and learn about an individual during a chase.|$|E
500|$|After the Gunpowder Plot, James sanctioned harsh {{measures}} to control non-conforming English Catholics. In May 1606, Parliament passed the Popish Recusants Act, which could require any citizen {{to take an}} Oath of Allegiance denying the Pope's authority over the king. James was conciliatory towards Catholics who took the Oath of Allegiance, and tolerated crypto-Catholicism even at court. Henry Howard, for example, was a crypto-Catholic, received back into the Catholic Church in his final months. On ascending the English throne, James suspected that he might need the support of Catholics in England, so he assured the Earl of Northumberland, a prominent sympathiser of the old religion, {{that he would not}} persecute [...] "any that will <b>be</b> <b>quiet</b> <b>and</b> give but an outward obedience to the law".|$|E

500|$|The breed {{is often}} {{described}} by the Latin phrase multum in parvo, or [...] "much in little" [...] or [...] "a lot of dog in a small space", alluding to the Pug's remarkable and charming personality, despite its small size. Pugs are strong willed but rarely aggressive, and are suitable for families with children. The majority of the breed is very fond of children and sturdy enough to properly play with them. Depending on their owner's mood, they can <b>be</b> <b>quiet</b> <b>and</b> docile but also vivacious and teasing. Pugs tend to be intuitive and sensitive to the moods of their owners and are usually eager to please them. Pugs are playful and thrive on human companionship. They also {{tend to have a}} snoozy nature and {{spend a lot of time}} napping. Pugs are often called [...] "shadows" [...] because they follow their owners around and like to stay close to the action, craving attention and affection from their owners.|$|E
500|$|Rob Maier, {{construction}} {{coordinator and}} production designer for [...] "Tempest" [...] was very busy for this episode, as scenes were filmed at the Andalinis farm, and Zero Avenue (which {{is the name}} of the road that runs along the Canada–US border) for the scene where the three tornadoes touch down beside Lana. He also had to work on shattering the windows at the Luthor Mansion for Lex and Lionel’s final confrontation. The band Remy Zero, whose single [...] "Save Me" [...] is the opening theme for the show, was asked to perform for the episode. The band quickly learned that filming a live performance for a television show is not as straight forward as its sounds. In order to be able to film everything, Beeman could not have the band playing full volume throughout the scene. There were times when everyone had to <b>be</b> <b>quiet</b> <b>and</b> pretend to play, or dance, while the actors exchanged their dialogue. There were other times when they had to be as loud as they could.|$|E
500|$|James's {{attitude}} towards Catholics was more moderate {{than that of}} his predecessor, perhaps even tolerant. He promised {{that he would not}} [...] "persecute any that will <b>be</b> <b>quiet</b> <b>and</b> give an outward obedience to the law", and believed that exile was a better solution than capital punishment: [...] "I would be glad to have both their heads and their bodies separated from this whole island and transported beyond seas." [...] Some Catholics believed that the martyrdom of James's mother, Mary, Queen of Scots, would encourage James to convert to the Catholic faith, and the Catholic houses of Europe may also have shared that hope. [...] James received an envoy from the Habsburg Archduke Albert of the Southern Netherlands, ruler of the remaining Catholic territories after over 30years of war in the Dutch Revolt by English-supported Protestant rebels. [...] For the Catholic expatriates engaged in that struggle, the restoration by force of a Catholic monarchy was an intriguing possibility, but following the failed Spanish invasion of England in 1588 the papacy had taken a longer-term view on the return of a Catholic monarch to the English throne.|$|E

500|$|After the king's {{commission}} {{had been}} read aloud, {{the crowd was}} normally asked to move back from the scaffold before being addressed by the convict. [...] While these speeches were mostly an admission of guilt (although few admitted treason), still they were carefully monitored by the sheriff and chaplain, who were occasionally forced to act; in 1588, Catholic priest William Dean's address to the crowd was considered so inappropriate that he was gagged {{almost to the point}} of suffocation. [...] Questions on matters of allegiance and politics were sometimes put to the prisoner, as happened to Edmund Gennings in 1591. [...] He was asked by priest hunter Richard Topcliffe to [...] "confess his treason", but when Gennings responded [...] "if to say Mass be treason, I confess to have done it and glory in it", Topcliffe ordered him to <b>be</b> <b>quiet</b> <b>and</b> instructed the hangman to push him off the ladder. [...] Sometimes the witness responsible for the condemned man's execution was also present. [...] A government spy, John Munday, was in 1582 present for the execution of Thomas Ford. [...] Munday supported the sheriff, who had reminded the priest of his confession when he protested his innocence. [...] The sentiments expressed in such speeches may be related to the conditions encountered during imprisonment. [...] Many Jesuit priests suffered badly at the hands of their captors but were frequently the most defiant; conversely, those of a higher station were often the most apologetic. [...] Such contrition may have arisen from the sheer terror felt by those who thought they might be disembowelled rather than simply beheaded as they would normally expect, and any apparent acceptance of their fate may have stemmed from the belief that a serious, but not treasonable act, had been committed. [...] Good behaviour at the gallows may also have been due to a convict's desire for his heirs not to be disinherited.|$|E

2500|$|To the end, Guiteau {{was making}} plans to start a lecture tour after his {{perceived}} imminent release and {{to run for president}} himself in 1884, {{while at the same time}} continuing to delight in the media circus surrounding his trial.

After the guilty verdict was read, Guiteau stepped forward, despite his lawyers' efforts to tell him to <b>be</b> <b>quiet,</b> <b>and</b> yelled at the jury saying [...] "You are all low, consummate jackasses!" [...] plus a further stream of curses and obscenities before he was taken away by guards to his cell to await execution.

2500|$|Snow {{and nine}} or ten Harrison {{businessmen}} formed Recreation Enterprises, Incorporated (REI) to develop the land. Their {{first step was to}} get permission from Al Capp, the creator of Li'l Abner, for a park based on his work. According to an Arkansas Gazette article, Snow sent Capp home movies of the property and descriptions of the attractions. In addition to the trout farm and Mystic Caverns cave, Snow planned a variety of attractions and activities, including horseback riding, paddle boats, train rides, local arts and crafts shops, family-oriented theatrical presentations, a botanical garden, an apiary, and honey and fudge shops. Li'l Abner comic-strip characters who would roam the park and perform skits for the patrons. Snow also assured Capp that the park would <b>be</b> <b>quiet</b> <b>and</b> dignified and would not include roller coasters or thrill rides that would conflict with the rustic Li'l Abner theme. Capp, who had turned down other offers to use his characters in theme parks, accepted this one and became a partner, claiming he had once driven through the Ozarks and had pictured just such an area for the setting of his fictional [...] "Dogpatch" [...] town. On January 4, 1967, an article in the Northwest Arkansas Times stated that Capp's attorneys were finalizing the agreement. Capp approved of the plans for the park and granted REI the rights to use his characters.|$|E
2500|$|As Eva and Walther retreat {{further into}} the shadows, Beckmesser begins his serenade.

Annoyed, Beckmesser tells Sachs to stop, but the cobbler replies {{that he has to}} finish tempering the soles of the shoes, whose lateness Beckmesser had publicly complained about in Act 1. Sachs offers a compromise: he will <b>be</b> <b>quiet</b> <b>and</b> let Beckmesser sing, but he (Sachs) will be Beckmesser's [...] "marker", and mark each of Beckmesser's musical/poetical errors by striking one of the soles with his hammer. Beckmesser, who has spotted someone at Eva's window (Magdalena in disguise), has no time to argue. He tries to sing his serenade, but he makes so many mistakes (his tune repeatedly places accents on the wrong syllables of the words) that from the repeated knocks Sachs finishes the shoes. David wakes up and sees Beckmesser apparently serenading Magdalena. He attacks Beckmesser in a fit of jealous rage. The entire [...] neighborhood is awakened by the noise. The other apprentices rush into the fray, and the situation degenerates into a full-blown riot. In the confusion, Walther tries to escape with Eva, but Sachs pushes Eva into her home and drags Walther into his own workshop. Quiet is restored as abruptly as it was broken. A lone figure walks through the street – the nightwatchman, calling out the hour.|$|E
2500|$|Morton's book {{describes}} Cruise's {{relationship with}} Katie Holmes, his sexuality, and Cruise and Holmes' beliefs. [...] Morton also asserts {{in the book}} that Holmes had to [...] "audition" [...] for the status of Cruise's girlfriend, and won the part over other actresses. [...] The book also discusses details about Cruise's marriages to Mimi Rogers and Nicole Kidman, his relationship with Penélope Cruz, his behavior on The Oprah Winfrey Show, and his denunciation of Brooke Shields for using anti-depressants to help her cope with postpartum depression. Morton consulted a former senior Scientologist, who asserted that Kidman's lawyer had advised her not to publicly discuss Scientology or to speak out against it, even though she [...] "hated" [...] Scientology when Cruise left her in 2000. [...] Morton's source stated [...] "I told the lawyer if she wants to stay with the children she will have to <b>be</b> <b>quiet</b> <b>and</b> not speak out about Scientology." [...] Morton writes that Holmes joined Scientology in June 2006, and agreed that [...] "if she or any of her children were ever to suffer mental or terminal illness, they must turn only to Scientology's treatments." [...] Morton asserts that model Sofia Vergara stopped seeing Cruise in 2005 weeks before he met Holmes, and Vergara felt [...] "she had been deliberately targeted not only as a possible bride for Tom, but as a high-profile Scientology recruit who would be an alluring figurehead for a future recruitment drive in Latin America." ...|$|E
