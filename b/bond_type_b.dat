40|$|Abstract: Fly ash brick (FAB) is a {{building}} material, specifically masonry units, containing class C fly ash and water, compressed at 28 MPa and cured for 24 hrs in a 66 °C steam bath, then toughened {{with an air}} entrainment agent, the bricks last for more than 100 freeze-thaw cycles. Owing to the high concentration of calcium oxide in class C fly ash, the brick is described as "self-cementing". The manufacturing method saves energy, reduces mercury pollution, and costs 20 % less than traditional clay brick manufacturing. In the present study three types of FAB masonry referred as Type A (conventional masonry in English <b>bond),</b> <b>Type</b> <b>B</b> (odd course of bricks on edge and even course on bed) and Type C (all bricks on edge in Flemish bond) had been considered. Since Type B and C masonry consist of inside cavity {{that resulted in the}} saving of number of bricks by 25 %. The reduction in the manufacturing cost of fly ash bricks and saving in the number of bricks resulted in the considerable reduction in the overall cost of masonry structure...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{formation}} of monohydrates of capped phenylalanine model peptides, CH(3) -CO-Phe-NH(2) and CH(3) -CO-Phe-NH-CH(3), in a supersonic: expansion {{has been investigated}} using laser spectroscopy and quantum chemistry methods. Conformational distributions of the monohydrates have been revealed by IR/UV double-resonance spectroscopy and their structures assigned by comparison with DFT-D calculations. A careful analysis of the final hydrate distribution together with a detailed theoretical investigation of the potential energy surface of the monohydrates demonstrates that solvation occurs from the conformational distribution of the isolated peptide monomers. The distribution of the monohydrates appears to be strongly dependent on both the initial monomer conformation (extended or folded backbone) and the solvation site initially occupied by the water molecule. The solvation processes taking place during the cooling can be categorized as follows: (a) solvation without significant structural changes of the peptide, (b) solvation inducing significant distortions of the backbone but retaining the secondary structure, and (c) solvation triggering backbone isomerizations, leading to a modification of the peptide secondary structure. It is observed that solvation by a single water molecule can fold a beta-strand into a gamma-turn structure (type c) or induce a significant opening of a gamma-turn characterized by an elongated C(7) hydrogen <b>bond</b> (<b>type</b> <b>b).</b> These structural changes {{can be considered as}} a first step toward the polyproline II condensed-phase structure, illustrating the role played by the very first wate...|$|E

40|$|A {{method is}} {{presented}} for covalently <b>bonding</b> Haemophilus influenzae <b>type</b> <b>b</b> capsular polysaccharide (HIB Ps) to several proteins. The method is efficient and relies upon {{the use of}} adipic dihydrazide as a spacer between the capsular polysaccharide and the carrier protein. In contrast to the poor immunogenicity of the purified HIB Ps in mice and rabbits, the HIB Ps-protein conjugates induced serum anti-type b antibodies having bactericidal activity at levels shown to be protective in humans when low doses were injected subcutaneously in a saline solution. The antibody response in mice {{was related to the}} dose of the conjugates, increased with the number of injections, and could be primed by the previous injection of the carrier protein. The HIB Ps- protein conjugates were immunogenic in three different mouse strains. The importance of the carrier molecule for the enhanced immunogenicity of the HIB Ps-protein conjugates was shown by the failure of HIB Ps hybrids prepared with either the homologous polysaccharide or pneumococcus type 3 polysaccharide to induce antibodie in mice. Rabbits injected with the HIB Ps-protein conjugates emulsified in Freund's adjuvant produced high levels of serum anti-type b antibodies which induced a bactericidal effect upon H. influenzae <b>type</b> <b>b</b> organisms. It is proposed that the HIB Ps component of the polysaccharide protein conjugates has been converted to a thymic-dependent immunogen. This method may be used to prepare protein-polysaccharide conjugates with HIB Ps and other polysaccharides to be considered for human use...|$|R

40|$|A {{remarkable}} {{improvement is}} {{introduced into the}} description of the <b>bonding</b> <b>types</b> of mixtures NiSnut, PdSnui, and PtSnM by considering the <b>bonding</b> <b>type</b> rules of confluence, collectivity, and spin compensation. The number of bonding figures has decreased to two in each mixture, namely to FU 2 of Pt, Pd, Ni and FB 2 C 4 of Sn. The stability of the FB 2 C 4 figure with increasing valence electron concentration always begins in the NiAs homeo- type. While the structures at lower valence electron concentrations are ho- meotypes of close packings, the structures at higher valence electron concentrations exhibit an anionic partial structure into which the A 10 atoms are inserted. Structural features like lacuna homeotypism, stacking homeoty- pism, or deformation homeotypism may be explained by the <b>bonding</b> <b>type.</b> The proposed improved <b>bonding</b> <b>types</b> confirm that the electron correlations model is a useful valence model for intermetallic phases.

The {{objective of this}} study was to evaluate the utility of World Health Organization (WHO) classification in patients with <b>type</b> <b>B</b> thymoma. MethodsThis was a retrospective review of 100 patients who underwent thymectomy for WHO <b>type</b> <b>B</b> thymoma. Recurrence patterns and survival were compared among subtypes. ResultsThere were 22 <b>type</b> <b>B</b> 1 tumors, 43 <b>type</b> <b>B</b> 2 tumors, and 35 <b>type</b> <b>B</b> 3 tumors. Incomplete resection occurred in 5 patients with <b>type</b> <b>B</b> 1 thymoma, 8 with <b>type</b> <b>B</b> 2 thymoma, and 8 with <b>type</b> <b>B</b> 3 thymoma (P = . 87). Of the 79 patients with complete resection, tumor recurrence occurred in 1 (5. 9 %) patient with <b>type</b> <b>B</b> 1 thymoma, 2 (5. 7 %) with <b>type</b> <b>B</b> 2 thymoma, and 2 (7. 4 %) with <b>type</b> <b>B</b> 3 thymoma, and all of these patients had Masaoka stage III disease. Disease-free survival at 5 years was 93 %, 85 %, and 82 % in <b>type</b> <b>B</b> 1, B 2, and B 3, respectively (B 1 vs B 2; P =. 79; B 2 vs B 3; P = 0. 6).

ConclusionsTumor recurrence was significantly associated with advanced Masaoka stage regardless of the WHO subtype of <b>type</b> <b>B</b> thymomas.
