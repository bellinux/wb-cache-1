To combat this, the rules of most systems allow the tax authorities to challenge whether the services allegedly performed actually benefit the member charged. The inquiry may focus on whether services were indeed performed as well as who benefited from the services. [...] For this purpose, some rules differentiate stewardship services from other services. Stewardship services are generally those that an investor would incur for its own benefit in managing its investments. Charges to the investee for such services are generally inappropriate. Where services were not performed or where the related party bearing the charge derived no direct <b>benefit,</b> <b>tax</b> authorities may disallow the charge altogether.|$|E
40|$|Two views {{dominate}} {{the debate about}} property tax incidence — the “capital tax” or “new” view, under which the tax distorts capital allocation and is borne primarily by capital owners, and the “benefit tax” view, under which the tax is an efficient user charge. Evidence of both interjurisdictional and intrajurisdictional capitalization of property taxes and public services has been argued to provide compelling evidence for the <b>benefit</b> <b>tax</b> view. This paper focuses on the latter — the intra-jurisdictional capitalization effects that underlie what {{is arguably the most}} plausible derivation of the <b>benefit</b> <b>tax</b> view of the property tax. The analysis provides a model in which the capital reallocations that characterize the capital tax view induce intrajurisdictional capitalization effects that are generally similar — indeed, in the benchmark case, identical — to those that arise under the <b>benefit</b> <b>tax</b> view, suggesting that empirical evidence supporting such capitalization effects cannot distinguish between the two views. In addition, the analysis shows that these capitalization effects imply that even under the stringent assumptions of the benefit view, the property tax is not a <b>benefit</b> <b>tax</b> for a property-tax-financed increase in local public services; rather, it only becomes a <b>benefit</b> <b>tax</b> for future home purchasers — after the modeled intrajurisdictional capitalization effects occur...|$|E

40|$|Abstract- Is the {{property}} tax a <b>benefit</b> <b>tax?</b> This paper tests the benefit-tax hy-pothesis for rental housing. In the case most favorable to this hypothesis, namely with mobile tenants, relatively high prop-erty taxes cannot be directly reflected in rents but can be indirectly reflected {{to the extent that}} they lead to relatively high-quality public services. This indirect shifting equals tenants ’ willingness to pay for the public service increment. Even in this case, however, {{the property}} tax is not a <b>benefit</b> <b>tax</b> unless the tax rate is set so indirect shifting equals a landlord’s tax in-crease. This second condition is not met in the Boston area in 1980; on average, indirect shifting covers only about $ 0. 7 7 of a $ 1. 00 increase in property taxes...|$|E

40|$|An {{allocation}} {{is said to}} be ``weakly envy-free'' {{if there}} is no individual who envies others with the same or smaller endowments. The requirement is a necessary condition for an allocation to be envy-free [Foley (1967) ]. We show that competitive equilibrium allocations in exchange economies are weakly envy-free, i. e., this weak notion of fairness is achieved in markets. Since governments are expected to improve fairness in economies, it seems natural to require government policies satisfy this minimum requirement, which we refer to as no-envy criterion. We show that well-known equity criteria for government policies need not satisfy the no-envy criterion. Since the <b>benefit</b> <b>tax</b> (e. g., Lindahl tax) in general does not satisfy the no-envy criterion either, we argue {{that it is not a}} fair tax to finance pure public goods and show a result which supports income tax and commodity tax as fair taxes. The result suggests that the no-envy criterion may be indeed adopted by governments as an equity criterion. It is also argued that when public goods are not pure the <b>benefit</b> <b>tax</b> must be introduced because the income tax and the commodity tax no longer satisfy the no-envy criterion.

40|$|A‘fringe benefit’ is {{described}} as a benefit other than salary and wages accruing to a person because of an employment relationship. Taxation law assesses employees on cash payments of salary and wages and similar amounts received as a result of employment.

Fringe <b>benefits</b> <b>tax</b> (‘FBT’) was implemented from 1 July 1986 to combat this difficulty.

40|$|Enlightened by {{the theory}} of Tiebout and Hamilton about {{property}} tax as a <b>benefit</b> <b>tax</b> and the new view reformulated by George R. Zodrow and Peter Mieszkowski, this dissertation seeks to study the capitalization and regressivity of Government Rates in Hong Kong, which have already existed for 165 years {{in the city and}} are equivalent to property tax mentioned in western literature. Since both Hong Kong and Mainland China share the same structure of land lease system, it is meaningful to study the implications of Rates in the property market in Hong Kong at the juncture of a new wave of property tax reform in China commencing with the latest property tax experiment in two major cities: Chongqing and Shanghai. 　　This dissertation first reviews the history and describes the roles of Government Rates in the financial revenue and expenditure system of the Hong Kong Government to get a clear picture of where Rates are from, how they are collected and where they have been spent on. Meanwhile, effects of Rates and public expenditures on local residential property values of different classes during the year 1974 - 2008 are examine by applying time series of housing price index, percentage of Rates charge, and public expenditure, etc. Furthermore, in order to test whether Hamilton’s intra-jurisdictional capitalization exists, transaction data of the year 2000 from EPRC are employed to examine whether low income housing (small units) sells at relatively higher price compared with high income housing (large units) due to the fiscal surplus. The empirical results show no capitalization of Rates but capitalization of public goods exists and the Rates payment is shifted forward into the housing price. We find out that Rates in Hong Kong is not a capital tax, and actually it is a <b>benefit</b> <b>tax</b> and user fee paid for public goods. The last part of the dissertation concludes valuable lessons for the property tax reform in Mainland China. ii 2 published_or_final_versionReal Estate and ConstructionMasterMaster of Philosoph...|$|E
