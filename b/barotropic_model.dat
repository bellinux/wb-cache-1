This <b>barotropic</b> <b>model</b> climate has reasonable approximations of the Arctic Oscillation (AO) and Pacific/North America (PNA) teleconnections as its two leading principal patterns of low-frequency variability. The systematic strategy consists {{first of the}} identification of slowly evolving climate modes and faster evolving nonclimate modes by use of an empirical orthogonal function (EOF) decomposition. The low-order stochastic climate model predicts the evolution of these climate modes a priori without any regression fitting of the resolved modes. The systematic stochastic mode reduction strategy determines all correction terms and noises with minimal regression fitting of the vari-ances and correlation times of the unresolved modes. These correction terms and noises account for the neglected interactions between the resolved climate modes and the unresolved nonclimate modes. Low-order stochastic models with only four resolved modes capture the statistics of the original <b>barotropic</b> <b>model</b> modes quite well.
