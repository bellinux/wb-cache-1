5|$|After the Jacobite rising of 1745, Adam's {{position}} as Mason to the Board of Ordnance <b>brought</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> {{number of large}} military contracts in the Highlands. In 1746, the position of Master Carpenter to the Board of Ordnance became vacant, and Adam was quick to put forward his son John's name for consideration, although he was unsuccessful in securing him the post. His three eldest sons were all involved in the family business by 1746, James and John both leaving Edinburgh University early to join their father.|$|E

5|$|Sir Hugh Seymour Walpole, CBE (13 March 18841 June 1941) was an English novelist. He {{was the son}} of an Anglican clergyman, {{intended}} for a career in the church but drawn instead to writing. Among those who encouraged him were the authors Henry James and Arnold Bennett. His skill at scene-setting and vivid plots, as well as his high profile as a lecturer, <b>brought</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> large readership in the United Kingdom and North America. He was a best-selling author in the 1920s and 1930s but has been largely neglected since his death.|$|E
5|$|Thomas first {{travelled}} to the United States in the 1950s. His readings there <b>brought</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> {{degree of}} fame, while his erratic behaviour and drinking worsened. His time in America cemented his legend, however, {{and he went}} on to record to vinyl such works as A Child's Christmas in Wales. During his fourth trip to New York in 1953, Thomas became gravely ill and fell into a coma, from which he never recovered. He died on 9 November 1953. His body was returned to Wales, where he was interred at the village churchyard in Laugharne on 25 November 1953.|$|E
5|$|Mehldau {{was born}} on August 23, 1970, in Jacksonville, Florida. His father, Craig Mehldau, was a doctor, and his mother, Annette, was a homemaker. His sister, Leigh Anne, became a social worker. There was always a piano in the house during Mehldau's childhood, and he {{initially}} listened to pop and rock music on the radio. His family moved to West Hartford, Connecticut, when Mehldau was 10. Up to this point he had played mostly simple pop tunes and exercises from books, but the move <b>brought</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> new piano teacher, who introduced him to classical music. This new interest lasted for a few years, but {{by the age of}} 14 he was listening more to jazz, including recordings by saxophonist John Coltrane and pianist Oscar Peterson.|$|E

50|$|His {{financial}} situation improved only {{later in his}} life. His mother's death in 1846 <b>brought</b> <b>him</b> <b>an</b> income of £200 per year. When his daughters matured, they managed his budget more responsibly than he ever had himself.|$|R
5|$|On lap 46, Vettel {{went past}} Hülkenberg for eighth {{at the final}} chicane. There was no contact between the two drivers, but the Force India car spun {{in order to avoid}} the wall on the outside of the final corner. Two laps later, Fernando Alonso was the first driver to retire from the race, his third {{consecutive}} retirement. On lap 52, Romain Grosjean tried to lap Will Stevens, cutting his rear left tyre in the process. The incident also <b>brought</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> five-second time penalty. The other Lotus of Pastor Maldonado also lost a position when Vettel moved past him for fifth on lap 56. Jenson Button joined his teammate in retirement two laps later, being called into the pit lane by his team. Felipe Massa went up into sixth overtaking Maldonado on lap 64. For the remaining laps, Hamilton managed to control the lead and went on to win in Montreal for the fourth time, finishing 2.2 seconds ahead of Rosberg, with Bottas in third a further 38 seconds behind.|$|E
5|$|Peel {{had gained}} a {{reputation}} for trying new methods within the industry, {{being one of the}} first textile manufacturers to use carding cylinders. He began experimenting at his home with different forms of printing until, according to family tradition, his young daughter Anne <b>brought</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> sprig of parsley and begged him {{to use it as a}} pattern. He etched this design onto a pewter plate to allow the printing, which was then finished with an iron by one of the women of the household. There are other versions of the tale, which dispute whether the experiments happened at the farm at Peel Fold or his house in Fish Lane and suggest a poor neighbour, Mrs. Milton, calendered the cloth to finish it.|$|E
5|$|With the victory, the White Sox {{earned their}} first playoff berth since their {{win in the}} 2005 World Series. However, they lost to the {{eventual}} pennant-winning Tampa Bay Rays, 3 games to 1. Statistically, the game counted as the 163rd regular season game. Thome's home run, for example, was his 34th of the season. This total <b>brought</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> tie for fourth most in the league. Danks lowered his earned run average from 3.47 to 3.32 in the game, which moved him from a tie for tenth-best in the league with Zack Greinke to fifth place. Mauer, Morneau, and White Sox outfielder Carlos Quentin won Silver Slugger Awards for their offensive performances in the 2008 regular season. Mauer also won a Rawlings Gold Glove Award that year. This was the last tie-breaker with home field determined by a coin flip. Following the 2008 season MLB amended their rules, leaving future tie-breaker sites to be determined {{on a series of}} performance-based criteria beginning with the head-to-head record between the teams.|$|E

6000|$|The next day, however, <b>brought</b> <b>him</b> further misery, for his {{perceptions}} were clearer now, and {{the difficulties}} he must meet more apparent, while he had also a horrible suspense to struggle with when the man he had sent with the note <b>brought</b> <b>him</b> <b>an</b> answer. It was very brief: “I will try to see you this evening.” ...|$|R

5|$|Cyril Washbrook's benefit match <b>brought</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> then record sum, £14,000, {{but it was}} a mixed {{experience}} {{because he}} injured his right thumb whilst facing Lindwall and withdrew from the England team for the Fifth Test. The Australians scored 321 in their first innings with only Barnes (67) reaching 50. Nine of the Australians made a start, reaching 14, but could not capitalise on their opportunities, and they lost wickets at regular intervals after an opening stand of 123. The slow left-arm bowler William Roberts took 6/73. Lancashire replied with 130 of which Washbrook made 38, while Lindwall and Johnson took three wickets apiece, but the Australians did not enforce the follow on. Australia made 265/5 declared and Bradman scored an unbeaten 133, his highest at Old Trafford, with 90 for Barnes. Bradman declared at lunch on the third day after batting the hosts out of the match, but they held on with three wickets in hand after losing two late in the day. Ikin had reached 99 after being repeatedly hit by bouncers. Bradman took the second new ball and gave it to Miller, who refused to bowl, saying that he felt Ikin deserved a century. Lindwall (4/27) was then given the ball and promptly removed Ikin one run short of his century.|$|E
5|$|George Villiers (23 November 1759 – 21 March 1827), styled The Honourable, was a British courtier and {{politician}} {{from the}} Villiers family. The youngest {{son of the}} diplomat Lord Hyde (later Earl of Clarendon), he was an intimate of Princess Amelia and personal supporter of her father, George III. His favour within the Royal Family and his father's influence <b>brought</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> number of sinecures to support him. However, Villiers {{was more interested in}} the operation of the royal farms at Windsor Castle than in politics or the duties of his offices. When his bookkeeping as Paymaster of the Marines was carefully examined in 1810, Villiers' carelessness and the speculation of his clerk had left him in debt to the Crown by more than £250,000. This exposure touched off a public scandal; Villiers promptly surrendered all his property to the Crown and threw himself on the king's mercy. The misconduct of Joseph Hunt as Treasurer of the Ordnance to some extent obscured Villiers' own misconduct, {{and he was able to}} retain other sinecures and a stable, if reduced, income from them until his death in 1827.|$|E
25|$|Keeble was {{assigned}} to George Company, 2nd Battalion, 19th Infantry Regiment, 24th Infantry Division. His combat experience and a genuine gift of leadership <b>brought</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> quick series of promotions {{to the level of}} master sergeant, leading the 1st Platoon.|$|E

After choosing three random passages to be read, Akbar decided that this report had been false.|$|E
25|$|Gray {{was little}} {{affected}} by {{the stock market crash}} of 1929. The strip was more popular than ever and <b>brought</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> good income, which was only enhanced when the strip became the basis for a radio program in 1930 and two films in 1932 and 1938. Predictably, Gray was reviled by some for preaching in the strip to the poor about hard work, initiative, and motivation while living well on his income.|$|E
