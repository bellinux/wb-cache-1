5|$|The Georgia Tech administration's {{position}} on stealing the 'T' from Tech Tower has varied over the years. When the 'T' was first stolen in 1969, interim Institute President Vernon Crawford {{was so upset}} he considered canceling classes until it was returned. Afterwards, subsequent presidents opted to turn a <b>blind</b> <b>eye</b> <b>to</b> the practice, with one president, John Patrick Crecine, {{going so far as}} to endorse it.|$|E

Hartmann and his unit were led by the Americans to a large open-air compound to await the transfer. The number of prisoners grew to 50,000. Living conditions deteriorated, and some American guards turned a <b>blind</b> <b>eye</b> <b>to</b> escapes. In some cases they assisted by providing food and maps.|$|E
5|$|After {{the failed}} coup, Đông, Thi, Lieu {{and several other}} {{prominent}} officers fled to Tan Son Nhut and climbed aboard a C-47. They fled to Cambodia, where they were happily given asylum by Prince Norodom Sihanouk. Cambodia and South Vietnam had been on bad terms; Cambodia turned a <b>blind</b> <b>eye</b> <b>to</b> Vietnamese communists using their territory as a staging ground, while Diệm and Nhu had tried to foment opposition and had supported attempts to overthrow the Cambodian leader. Nhu had failed in a 1959 attempt to assassinate Sihanouk with a parcel bomb, and both nations' leaders despised one another.|$|E

Corruption was so bad that although many supervising officers did not participate, they turned <b>blind</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>to</b> other officers committing unlawful acts.|$|R

50|$|The UK {{merchant}} fleet arriving from the Americas amounted to the 15 {{percent of the}} total of their global commerce. British trade with Latin America was not totally legal. But it was tolerated as they were an allied power in the Napoleonic Wars and later, with the mediation of the UK, in the colonial Americas conflict. The Royal Navy tried to protect their trade without interfering in the local conflicts of independence. The US Government turned <b>blind</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>to</b> North American privateers, trying to force Spain to accelerate the cession of Florida (Adams-Onís Treaty).

5|$|Detractors further {{blamed the}} school for the accident, saying that, {{in the name of}} tradition, administrators turned a <b>blind</b> <b>eye</b> <b>to</b> an unsafe {{structure}} being constructed with minimal engineering and safety protocols. Before the collapse, some people expressed concerns about the safety of the Bonfire, citing the partial collapse that occurred in a previous Bonfire, the progressively shorter Bonfire burn times (collapse of the stack after lighting) which had dropped from several hours to less than 20minutes, and numerous incidents involving alcohol or unsafe horseplay at the Bonfire site. One of the students killed in the 1999 Bonfire collapse was under the legal drinking age yet a toxicology test showed high blood-alcohol levels; however, lower readings in a second test and inconsistencies in the initial sampling and annotation methods led to questions about the accuracy of the original tests.|$|E
5|$|Pilcher's {{marriage}} {{was not a}} happy one; a gambler and womaniser, he expected his independently wealthy wife to bail out his debts and turn a <b>blind</b> <b>eye</b> <b>to</b> his mistresses. The two gradually drifted into separate lives, and after finally confronted with an affair becoming public, Kathleen sued for divorce. The precipitating event was Pilcher having been named as co-respondent in a divorce suit; it was alleged that he had committed adultery with Millicent Knight-Bruce, the wife of Major James Knight-Bruce. The case dragged on through 1910, delayed by Pilcher's inability to return from India to attend the court. Pilcher did not contest his wife's suit, and his own divorce was granted in 1911; he married Millicent, now divorced, in 1913.|$|E
5|$|In late January 1965, Buddhist {{protests against}} junta-appointed {{civilian}} Prime Minister Trần Văn Hương broke out across South Vietnam. The unrest came after Huong had unveiled {{plans to expand}} conscription and {{the war against the}} communists, and demonstrations were at their largest in I Corps, a Buddhist and anti-war escalation stronghold. In Huế, matters degenerated into a riot as 5,000 demonstrators attacked the United States Information Service Library and burned 8,000 books. Khánh and Thi were thought to have turned a <b>blind</b> <b>eye</b> <b>to</b> the rioting in order to allow the disorder to ruin the Huong government and allow them to inherit power. Khánh decided to have the armed forces replace Huong, and on the morning of 27 January, Khánh staged a bloodless putsch with the support of Thi and Kỳ. However, many of the officers had agreed to Khánh's plan in hopes he would fail and discredit himself.|$|E

Yes, I wept in my weakness, till I remembered that I had no longer any wish to be the death of men.

Whatever their subjective longings, how can they turn a <b>blind</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>to</b> the expectations of their next of kin that are anchored in tradition? We see that these expectations are in turn influenced by social customs and by fear of gossip among neighbors.

5|$|Pound was 36 {{when he met}} the 26-year-old American violinist Olga Rudge in Paris in late 1922, {{beginning}} a love affair that lasted 50 years. Biographer John Tytell believes Pound had always felt that his creativity and ability to seduce women were linked, something Dorothy had turned a <b>blind</b> <b>eye</b> <b>to</b> over the years. Shortly after arriving in Paris, he complained {{that he had been}} there for three months without having managed to find a mistress. He was introduced to Olga at a musical salon hosted by American heiress Natalie Barney in her home at 20 Rue Jacob, near the Boulevard Saint-Germain. The two moved in different social circles: Olga was the daughter of a wealthy Youngstown, Ohio, steel family, living in her mother's Parisian apartment on the Right Bank, socializing with aristocrats, while his friends were mostly impoverished writers of the Left Bank. They spent the following summer in the south of France, where Pound worked with George Antheil to apply the concept of Vorticism to music, and managed to write two operas, including Le Testament de Villon. He wrote pieces for solo violin, which Olga performed.|$|E

However, when Abi finds a present that Ben has got for Paul, she realises he has feelings for Paul and confides in Babe, who helps her to publicly announce that she is pregnant. Ben asks Abi to have a termination but then changes his mind, saying he wants the baby. Abi then goes to Babe, panicking because she has lied and is not really pregnant. When Ben accompanies her to a doctor's appointment, she gets him {{out of the room and}} confesses her lie to the doctor, who encourages her to be honest, but she then tells Ben the baby is due in October. Abi plans to get pregnant by Ben, but when he admits he may have caught an STI from a stranger, she is unable to have sex with him, so Babe tells her to get pregnant by another man. Babe forces her into getting drunk, and after a drunk Lee Carter (Danny-Boy Hatchard) compliments her, they have unprotected sex. However, Abi does not get pregnant. She decides to tell Ben the truth, but as she is about to do so, he tells her he has caught chlamydia. Abi later tests positive for chlamydia and realises that Lee may have caught it too. Abi panics to Babe that Ben will discover she is not pregnant, so during an argument between Ben and Phil, Babe pushes Abi into Ben as he is pushed by Phil, knocking her to the ground. Babe takes Abi away from the square, and on their return, Abi tells Ben she has had a miscarriage. When she later sees Ben being comforted by Paul, she feels uneasy.|$|E
