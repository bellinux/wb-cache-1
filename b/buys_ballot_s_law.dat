40|$|SUMMARY: The {{concept of}} {{matter in the}} work of <b>Buys</b> <b>Ballot.</b> In this paper the dynamico-atomistical concept of matter of the Dutch {{scientist}} C. H. D. <b>Buys</b> <b>Ballot</b> (1817 - 1890), chiefly known as founder of meteorology as a science, will be discussed. <b>Buys</b> <b>Ballot</b> published his ideas on matter in his «Schets eener physiologie van het onbewerktuigde rijk der natuur», which appeared in 1849. Analysis of his publications shows clearly that <b>Buys</b> <b>Ballot</b> was very interested in philosophical reflections during his whole life. He was strongly influenced by his teacher in mathematics, logic metaphysics and moral philosophy J. F. L. Schroder (1774 - 1845), who undoubtly stimulated <b>Buys</b> <b>Ballot</b> in his philosophical interest. The philosopher C. W. Opzoomer (1821 - 1892) brought <b>Buys</b> <b>Ballot</b> {{under the influence of the}} philosophical ideas of K. C. F. Krause (1781 - 1832). Unlike the majority of German scientists no philosophical reasons led <b>Buys</b> <b>Ballot</b> to his dynamico-atomistical ideas. It was rather Laplace's work, which brought him to his concept of matter, in which however his colleagues in the Netherlands and abroad were hardly interested...|$|R
50|$|<b>Buys</b> <b>Ballot's</b> law, {{which was}} first deduced by the American meteorologists J.H. Coffin and William Ferrel, {{is a direct}} {{consequence}} of Ferrel's law. The law takes its name from C. H. D. <b>Buys</b> <b>Ballot,</b> a Dutch meteorologist, who published it in the Comptes Rendus, November 1857. While William Ferrel theorized this first in 1856, <b>Buys</b> <b>Ballot</b> was the first to provide an empirical validation.|$|R
40|$|Since 1893, the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences has awarded, {{once every}} 10 years, a golden <b>Buys</b> <b>Ballot</b> Medal to a {{scientist}} who has made outstanding contributions {{to the development of}} meteorology. The award was instituted in 1888 in honor of C. H. D. <b>Buys</b> <b>Ballot</b> (1817 – 90), upon his retirement as professor of physics at the University of Utrecht. Today, <b>Buys</b> <b>Ballot</b> is remembered best by <b>Buys</b> <b>Ballot’s</b> law, which gives the relation between wind and pressure. He derived this law from observations and published it in 1857. 1 <b>Buys</b> <b>Ballot</b> was a pioneer both in weather forecasting and in recognizing the need for international cooperation in meteorology. He founded the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute (KNMI) in 1854 and served as its chief director until his death, and was first president (1873 – 79) of the International Meteorological Committee, a predecessor of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) ...|$|R

40|$|SUMMARY: The {{reaction}} of <b>Buys</b> <b>Ballot</b> on van ‘t Hoff’s «Proposal for {{the extension of}} the formulas now in use in chemistry into space». In September 1874, Jacobus Henricus van 't Hoff published in his «Proposal for the Extension of the Formulas now in use in chemistry into space, together with a related remark on the relation between the optical rotating power and the chemical constitution of organic compounds-, the theory of the asymmetric carbon atom. The Dutch pamphlet — which consisted of only twelve pages in print — was soon translated into French. However, van 't Hoff’s ideas drew but few interest. He got warm acknowledgments of the chemists Spring, Wurtz and Henry, but they made no attempt to discuss or to criticize his ideas. Wislicenus and von Baeyer were very enthusiastic about the theory and Landolt wrote that he couldn't gave any case which was contrary against it. The most sharp and destructive criticism came from Kolbe, who castigated van ‘t Hoff {{as an example of the}} «Naturphilosophen». Also in the Netherlands the ideas of van 't Hoff were received with skepticism and indifference. Bremer used it in his dissertation (1875), Gunning was enthusiastic about it, but the first who gave serious attention to the theory of the asymmetric carbon atom was <b>Buys</b> <b>Ballot</b> (1875), who sill defended his dynamical atomism (published In 1849) and believed that on theoretical grounds the hydrogen atoms in the methane molecule are to be placed on the planes of the regular tetraeder and not at the corners. Van 't Hoff rightly answered <b>Buys</b> <b>Ballot</b> that in fact this is the same view. Both <b>Buys</b> <b>Ballot</b> and van 't Hoff were disappointed on the reception of their ideas, but, contrary to <b>Buys</b> <b>Ballot,</b> van 't Hoff soon got all honours which he deserved and his ideas were elucidated and extended within a few years...|$|R

50|$|After {{graduating from}} Amherst, Coffin became {{a teacher at}} various schools and colleges. His career in {{meteorology}} began in 1838. He worked at Williams College in Williamstown, Massachusetts, from 1840 to 1843, during which he installed an apparatus for detecting the wind's direction and velocity, atop Mount Greylock, the highest point in Massachusetts. Together with William Ferrel, he deduced the <b>Buys</b> <b>Ballot's</b> law, which was named after the Dutch meteorologist C. H. D. <b>Buys</b> <b>Ballot.</b> He collaborated on meteorological studies with the Smithsonian Institution beginning in 1846. That same year, he acquired a chair at Lafayette College in Easton, Pennsylvania, in mathematics and natural philosophy, a position he held until his death.|$|R
5000|$|The {{underlying}} {{principles of}} <b>Buys</b> <b>Ballot's</b> law state that for anyone ashore in the Northern Hemisphere {{and in the}} path of a hurricane, the most dangerous place to be is in the right front quadrant of the storm. There, the observed wind speed of the storm is the sum of the speed of wind in the storm circulation plus the velocity of the storms forward movement. <b>Buys</b> <b>Ballot's</b> Law calls this the [...] "Dangerous Quadrant". Likewise, in the left front quadrant of the storm the observed wind is the difference between the storm's wind velocity and its forward speed. This is called the [...] "Safe Quadrant" [...] due to the lower observed wind speeds.|$|R
50|$|<b>Buys</b> <b>Ballot</b> {{devised a}} tabular method for {{investigating}} periodicity in time series. In 1847 {{he used the}} table now named after him to determine {{the period of the}} sun's rotation from daily observations of temperature in the Netherlands from 1729 to 1846.|$|R

By then, when more computing power was available {{and the first}} steps of numerical weather prediction were taken, {{the value of the}} work done by the Chicago School 10-20 years earlier was really appreciated.|$|R
50|$|<b>Buys</b> <b>Ballot's</b> law first {{appeared}} in early versions (prior to 1900) of Bowditch's American Practical Navigator and other publications written to assist in passage planning and the safe conduct of ships at sea and is still included today both in Bowditch and in Sailing Directions (see following reference) as an item of practical reference and information.|$|R
50|$|This {{meeting was}} {{followed}} by an International Meteorological Congress in Vienna, Austria-Hungary, in September 1873 which agreed to prepare for an International Meteorological Organization (IMO). The members of that organization would be the directors of national meteorological services. A Permanent Meteorological Committee was established with <b>Buys</b> <b>Ballot,</b> director of the Dutch meteorological service, becoming the first president.|$|R
50|$|Elections were {{generally}} peaceful {{although there were}} reports of vote <b>buying,</b> <b>ballot</b> snatching and presence of armed groups of candidates notably in Abra and Antipolo City.

50|$|These {{are very}} general rules that {{are subject to}} many other factors, {{including}} shapes of the coastline, and topography in any location. Although the principles apply to a very limited extent to a coastal observer during the approach and passage of a storm in any location, <b>Buys</b> <b>Ballot's</b> law was primarily formulated from empirical data to assist ships at sea.|$|R
50|$|<b>Buys</b> <b>Ballot</b> {{was the son}} of a Dutch Reformed minister, born in Kloetinge, Netherlands.

After receiving his doctorate in 1844, he became lecturer in mineralogy and geology at Utrecht; he added theoretical chemistry in 1846. In 1847 he was appointed professor of mathematics and from 1867 until his retirement he was professor of physics.|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to put the {{foundation}} of the Royal Dutch Meteorological Institute in 1854 in a broader context. It focusses on large foreign projects of a Humboldtean nature, such as the the rising magnetic and meteorological networks of the thirties and fourties, the role of universities, local societies and the government, and the practical dimensions of meteorology. It deals with the pioneering work on meteorology of Willem Wenckebach an his ally Richard van Rees, both of whom had participated in international networks. When <b>Buys</b> <b>Ballot</b> succeeded Wenckebach as the Utrecht professor of mathematics, he also adopted the latter's role as the main representant of Dutch meteorology. His primary aim was to raise meteorology to the level of an exact science. In 1848 he founded a meteorological observatory with the help of his friend Krecke. It was in every respect a private enterprise. Its primary aim was to become the centre of a national, and eventually an international, network. Financial support came from local societies. In his attempts to gain government recognition and support, <b>Buys</b> <b>Ballot</b> joined forces with the Dutch naval officer Jansen. The latter's contacts with Maury in Washington enabled <b>Buys</b> <b>Ballot</b> to convince the government of the practical meaning of meteorology. Charts of winds and seacurrents promised a considerable shortening of sailing passages. Hesitations of the Duch government to create a state institution were eventually overcome after the Brussels international conference on maritime meteorology. Comparison with a contemporaneous Humboldtean project, the geological charting of the Netherlands, allows for some generalisations with regard to the role of professors, experts, societies and the government in midcentury scientific projects of a national character...|$|R
5|$|The {{flags and}} pennants point to the low pressure, so it is {{possible}} to determine at which hemisphere the station is standing. The barbs in the figure at the right are located at the Northern Hemisphere, because the wind is circling counter clock-wise around a low-pressure area at the Northern Hemisphere (the wind is blowing in the opposite direction at the Southern Hemisphere, see also <b>Buys</b> <b>Ballot's</b> law).|$|R
5000|$|Utrecht {{played a}} {{prominent}} role in the golden age of Dutch science. Around 1850 the [...] "Utrechtian School" [...] of science formed, with Pieter Harting, Gerardus J. Mulder, Christophorus H. D. <b>Buys</b> <b>Ballot</b> and Franciscus Donders among the leading scientists. They introduced the educational laboratory (onderwijslaboratorium) as a practical learning place for their students. The University is represented in the Stichting Academisch Erfgoed, a foundation with the goal of preserving university collections.|$|R
50|$|<b>Buys</b> <b>Ballot</b> is {{best known}} for his accomplishments in the field of meteorology, {{specifically}} the explanation of the direction of air flow in large weather systems. Furthermore, he founded the Royal Dutch Meteorological Institute in 1854 and he remained its chief director until his death. He was one of the first to see the need for international cooperation, and in 1873 became the first chairman of the International Meteorological Organization, a precursor of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO).|$|R
5000|$|In meteorology, <b>Buys</b> <b>Ballot's</b> law (...) may be {{expressed}} as follows: In the Northern Hemisphere, {{if a person}} stands {{with his back to}} the wind, the atmospheric pressure is low to the left, high to the right. This is because wind travels counterclockwise around low pressure zones in the Northern Hemisphere. It is approximately true in the higher latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere, and is reversed in the Southern Hemisphere, but the angle between the pressure gradient force and wind is not a right angle in low latitudes.|$|R
50|$|<b>Buys</b> <b>Ballot's</b> law {{states that}} if {{a person in the}} Northern Hemisphere stands {{with his back to the}} wind, the {{atmospheric}} pressure is low to the left, high to the right. His main research effort in meteorology went into examining long-time series for regularities; he was more concerned with establishing the regularities than in explaining them. He made no contributions to the theory of meteorology which is perhaps surprising given his training in physics. The contrast with his American contemporary, William Ferrel, who discovered Buys-Ballot's law slightly earlier, is striking.|$|R
