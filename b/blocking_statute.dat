40|$|The Third Circuit {{recently}} {{held that}} the Foreign Trade Antitrust Improvement Act (FTAIA) creates a substantive element of a plaintiffs claim for extraterritorial application of U.

40|$|To {{place the}} Shipping Act of 1984 in context, this Comment begins by {{outlining}} {{the development of}} ocean liner conferences and the economics of liner operations.

The major portion of the Comment then analyzes the Shipping Act of 1984 and compares the provisions that are responsive to international shipping practices with those that remain in conflict with generally accepted shipping policies. Finally, to illustrate how the Act will operate, the key provisions are applied to a fact situation based on the shipping cases credited with provoking foreign retaliation...|$|R
40|$|In {{recognition}} of these deficiencies of comparative interest balancing, this note proposes not a better rule of law, {{but rather a}} more realistic and coherent process for extraterritorial decisionmaking in cases involving conflict between discovery and foreign <b>blocking</b> <b>statutes.</b> This note focuses on the distinction between interest balancing {{within the realm of}} 2 ̆ 2 private law 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 public law. 2 ̆ 2 The critical difference {{lies in the fact that}} interest balancing in public law cases has operated as a means of asserting the primacy of U. S. interests 2 ̆ 72 ̆ 7 in the guise of applying a 2 ̆ 2 jurisdictional rule of reason. 2 ̆ 2 Although courts profess to apply a comparative interest balancing approach, in public law cases they actually exercise enforcement jurisdiction whenever more than a de minimis U. S. interest is present; consideration of foreign interests is rarely more than perfunctory. Only in private law cases are courts willing to defer to foreign interests. This note seeks to conform the courts 2 ̆ 7 rhetoric to reality by providing an analytical framework which acknowledges that interest analysis has actually been, by necessity, unilateral and non-comparative...|$|R
40|$|The {{extraterritorial}} {{application of}} antitrust {{law has been}} extensively developped since 1957. In {{the same way as}} the United States have tried to apply antitrust laws to Europe, the EC now wishes to apply this kind of legislation to companies outside the EC, using the criteria of jurisdictional competence in conformity with public international law. Three successive theories have been put forward: The "Effect theory" which has been much debated on its concordance with international law. The theory of "Enterprise Unity" has the desadvantaye that it cannot be applied to all foreign undertakings. Finally, the Commission and the Court of Justice have recently relied on the theory of the "Location of Anticompetitive Conduct". This last theory stands as a compromise between the first two and has broader potential application. As the competence of jurisdiction, the "enforcement jurisdiction over foreign undertakings is governed by international principles and is also constrained by <b>blocking</b> <b>statutes.</b> Nevertheless, the EC Commission knows how to make the most of its enforcement powers and most of the time, foreign companies submit to its decisions because the jurisdictional competence is well established.

40|$|Sovereignty is {{the reason}} why States seek to apply their jurisdictions. All States like to extend their jurisdictions as far as they can, so some of them have adopted {{extraterritorial}} policies in exercising their jurisdictions. In this manner the United States has approved several extraterritorial Laws in respect of competition law and sanctions, causing some coercion to non-target states. In response to this long-arm jurisdiction by the U. S., some countries, such as the U. K., Canada, Australia, Mexico etc., as well as the E. U., took actions of their own in order to nullify these extraterritorial laws. These measures, which are mostly applied to the jurisdictional field, could be described as jurisdictional countermeasures. They can be divided into prescriptive, adjudicative and executive measures, which include <b>blocking</b> <b>statutes,</b> claw-back statutes, non-recognition, procedural restrictions, non-execution and retaliatory measures. Not all of these measures are prohibited by international law and some {{can be viewed as a}} just retorsion against that State. However, where the application of these measures is prohibited by international law – in cases such as the non-recognition of foreign judgments and other jurisdictional regulations in international treaties like mutual judicial assistance agreements – they are countermeasures. If these actions are in response to an illegal extraterritorial law, they should comply with the conditions for countermeasures as cited in the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts 2001 as approved by the International Law Commission...|$|R

As you can see the installation is based on simple principles resulting from the abilities of a material. It is about two blocks of asphalt which spontanously produce a pressure on the glass. In this case the glass has the importance of imaginary dividing level which prevents a physical contact. A glass obstacle makes the fusion of the two asphalt blocks impossible. Despite a volatile character, asphalt will run down. The installation results from a human standard because the blocks of asphalt have a human proportion.

5000|$|In {{most states}} of the United States, {{engagement}} rings are considered [...] "conditional gifts" [...] under the legal rules of property. This is {{an exception to the}} general rule that gifts cannot be revoked once properly given. See, for example, the case of Meyer v. Mitnick, 625 N.W.2d 136 (Michigan, 2001), whose ruling found the following reasoning persuasive: [...] "the so-called 'modern trend' holds that because an engagement ring is an inherently conditional gift, once the engagement has been broken, the ring should be returned to the donor. Thus, the question of who broke the engagement and why, or who was 'at fault,' is irrelevant. This is the no-fault line of cases." [...] Though in certain states, whether a judicial action can be maintained at all to require return of an engagement ring is <b>blocked</b> by <b>statute,</b> as many states have statutes which state that no civil action shall be maintained for breach of promise to marry.|$|R
