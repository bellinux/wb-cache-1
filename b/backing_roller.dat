40|$|A {{discussion}} {{covers the}} web test facility at the Technical University of Dresden and {{an example of}} its use, namely that of a high performance ultrasound module to smooth paper and paperboard surfaces. Topics include introduction; description of the test facility; the ultrasound smoothing module; integration of the ultrasound smoothing model into the web test stand; smoothing magazine paper; summary and outlook. The web test facility can run from 0. 1 to 120 m/min, can have a web width up to 500 mm and can handle roll diameters up to 650 mm at an automatically controlled web tension from 5 to 1, 000 N. The ultrasound roller is pneumatically pressed on the counter or impression roller so that in operation configuration without ultrasound control it {{is similar to a}} hard nip calender. A generator of up to 4 kw at 20 kHz frequency stimulates vibration at up to an effective work-piece width of 350 mm. In operation the following signals can be registered and evaluated, namely, s tress between ultrasound and <b>backing</b> <b>roller,</b> web speed at the nip, input and output moisture of the web (microwave sensor), web pull, and electrical output of the generator...|$|E

50|$|<b>Back</b> <b>roller</b> - A broad {{reversal}} such as {{that formed}} below a dam or ledge. Rafts can be particularly vulnerable to <b>back</b> <b>rollers,</b> because they can quickly fill a raft and then push it down at the back. If there are snags {{at the bottom of}} the river, dumped rafters can be caught and drowned in the aerated and therefore less buoyant water.|$|R

50|$|The paper {{passes through}} rollers in the fuser assembly, where {{temperatures}} up to 200 C and pressure {{are used to}} permanently bond the toner to the paper. One roller is usually a hollow tube (heat roller) {{and the other is}} a rubber <b>backed</b> <b>roller</b> (pressure roller). A radiant heat lamp is suspended in the centre of the hollow tube, and its infrared energy uniformly heats the roller from the inside. For proper bonding of the toner, the fuser roller must be uniformly hot.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Genetic {{programming}} {{was used}} to find out a mathematical model for drafting force from drafting process parameters on the drawing frame, which fits the experimental data as much as possible. The study used rayon fibers as the raw material in the mini-draw frame. The process parameters on the draw frame such as front roller speed, front <b>roller</b> draft, <b>back</b> <b>roller</b> speed and <b>back</b> <b>roller</b> draft as variables were investigated. The paper used the principle that there is linear relationship between drafting force and deformation from the strain gauges in the sensor. The data obtained from online measurement device was used for training and testing on the genetic programming. A comparison between experimental and predicted data was done. The results show very good agreement between the experimental and predicted values. Furthermore, this article shows that genetic programming can provide further use for setting up the machine process parameters without requiring {{an expert in the}} field...|$|R

50|$|Figure 8 roller {{coasters}} are {{a category of}} {{roller coasters}} where the train runs through a figure 8 shaped course {{before returning to the}} boarding station. This design {{was one of the first}} designs to be featured in roller coaster design, along with the out and <b>back</b> <b>roller</b> coaster. The figure 8 design allowed for more turns than the out and back design, offering riders an alternative experience.|$|R
25|$|Preparing is {{the process}} used in place of carding for long wools and hairs which would break on the card and {{therefore}} greatly reduce {{the quality of the}} worsted yarn produced. The maker-up or double-screw sheeting preparer is the first machine. This passes the fibre to and from delivery sheets via rollers, and ends with a lap of wool from six to eight feet long. The single screw can preparer is the most important machine of these, as it is here that the laps of wool or hair taken from the preceding boxes are prepared into a continuous sliver. The lap is placed on the feed sheet and carried forward to the <b>back</b> <b>rollers.</b> From the <b>back</b> <b>rollers</b> the fibres are delivered to the fallers, which with the aid of the front rollers, draw out the material into a continuous sliver. From the front rollers the sliver of fibres passes through a funnel, through the calender rollers and into a can which is placed directly underneath them. The material is now ready for the combing machine.|$|R
50|$|A twister {{roller coaster}} is the generic name given to any roller coaster layout {{which tends to}} twist or {{interweave}} its track within itself several times. It is essentially the opposite of an Out and <b>Back</b> <b>roller</b> coaster, which is often a much more simplistic layout. Twister roller coasters often have the illusion of having small or tight clearances due to the track usually travelling through several support structures. This {{is known as a}} head chopper effect.|$|R

25|$|The machines, {{known as}} boxes, {{in the drawing}} section reduce the combed tops from thick slivers to thinner roving ready for spinning. This is done by {{drafting}} them between slow <b>back</b> <b>rollers</b> to faster front rollers, and controlling the fibres between these rollers. The first boxes where the ends are thickest are the double head can gill box (where the wool ends up in a can) and the 2-spindle gill box (where the wool ends up twisted and on spindles). On these machines the rollers are heavily fluted to control the sliver, and the front rollers padded with leather to cushion the wool. Between the front and <b>back</b> <b>rollers</b> are fallers or bars which control the roving by holding it with fine pins. The roving is now called slubbing which needs twist for strength, and is dealt with by {{a second set of}} boxes: a 2-spindle draw-box, 4-spindle weigh box, 8-spindle finisher/reducer and 8-spindle rover. In these boxes the principle of two sets of rollers with controlled fibre in between is the same, but the yarn is now twisted onto a bobbin via a flyer.|$|R
50|$|The Racer is an out and <b>back</b> <b>roller</b> coaster design {{featuring}} two identical {{tracks that}} run parallel to each other. The design allows for two trains to race {{in similar fashion}} from start to finish. A unique design element that wasn't prevalent in 1972 was the splitting apart of both tracks into separate, standalone structures that rejoin again near the end. Previously, racing roller coasters were typically designed with both tracks remaining side-by-side throughout the entire course of the ride.|$|R
5000|$|Big Dipper is {{a wooden}} out and <b>back</b> <b>roller</b> coaster at Blackpool Pleasure Beach, Blackpool, England.

50|$|Minebuster is an out and <b>back</b> <b>roller</b> coaster, {{and uses}} two trains, with five cars holding six riders (in rows of two) each. The ride was {{designed}} by Curtis D. Summers and built in-house. The coaster was not built by PTC despite a plaque at the operator's booth and several published reports that claim it was. PTC stopped building coasters in 1979. It is likely however, that the construction crew consisted of workers who had previously built coasters for PTC. The two 30-passenger trains were supplied by the Philadelphia Toboggan Coasters. Canada's Wonderland's water park, Splash Works, has two sets of slides that pass over the Mighty Canadian Minebuster.|$|R

50|$|A {{ring frame}} was {{constructed}} from cast iron, and later pressed steel. On {{each side of}} the frame are the spindles, above them are draughting (drafting) rollers and on top is a creel loaded with bobbins of roving. The roving (unspun thread) passes downwards from the bobbins to the draughting <b>rollers.</b> Here the <b>back</b> <b>roller</b> steadied the incoming thread, while the front rollers rotated faster, pulling the roving out and making the fibres more parallel. The rollers are individually adjustable, originally by mean of levers and weights. The attenuated roving now passes through a thread guide that is adjusted to be centred above the spindle. Thread guides are on a thread rail which allows them to be hinged out of the way for doffing or piecing a broken thread. The attenuated roving passes down to the spindle assembly, where it is threaded though a small D ring called the traveller. The traveller moves along the ring. It is this that gives the ring frame its name. From here the thread is attached to the existing thread on the spindle.|$|R
40|$|The present {{research}} work {{was carried out}} to develop the prediction models for blended ring spun yarn evenness and tensile parameters using artificial neural networks (ANNs) and multiple linear regression (MLR). Polyester/cotton blend ratio, twist multiplier, <b>back</b> <b>roller</b> hardness and break draft ratio were used as input parameters to predict yarn evenness in terms of CVm% and yarn tensile properties in terms of tenacity and elongation. Feed forward neural networks with Bayesian regularisation support were successfully trained and tested using the available experimental data. The coefficients of determination of ANN and regression models indicate {{that there is a}} strong correlation between the measured and predicted yarn characteristics with an acceptable mean absolute error values. The comparative analysis of two modelling techniques shows that the ANNs perform better than the MLR models. The relative importance of input variables was determined using rank analysis through input saliency test on optimised ANN models and standardised coefficients of regression models. These models are suitable for yarn manufacturers and can be used within the investigated knowledge domain...|$|R

Late in 2011, they meet with three professional roller-coaster salesmen. Ground was broken in 2012 for the expansion that tripled the size of Fun Spot Action Park, turning it into Fun Spot America - Orlando. $25 million was spent on two new roller coasters, the world's second tallest Skycoaster (second only to their Kissimmee location), and numerous other attractions. The brand new two coasters are the wooden out and <b>back</b> <b>roller</b> coaster White Lightning, and the steel Suspended Family Coaster Freedom Flyer. The skycoaster came from MGM Grand Adventures in Las Vegas, {{where it had been}} disassembled in storage for 8 years. It is now the centerpiece of the park. Additional improvements include three new thrill rides, new multi-level go-kart track new food court, new ticket booth, additional parking and rest rooms.

The gun's barrel slid <b>back</b> on <b>rollers,</b> pushing a piston into an oil filled cylinder. This action absorbed the recoil progressively as the internal air pressure rose and, at the end of recoil, generated a strong but decreasing back pressure that returned the gun forward to its original position. By this time smokeless powder had replaced gunpowder as the standard propellant.|$|R
