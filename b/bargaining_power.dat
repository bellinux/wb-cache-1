Amartya Sen shows how social norms that devalue women's unpaid work in the household often disadvantage women in intra-household bargaining. These feminist economists argue that such claims have important economic outcomes which must be recognized within economic frameworks.|$|E
5|$|A case {{in which}} the Taft Court struck down {{regulation}} that generated a dissent from the chief justice was Adkins v. Children's Hospital. Congress had decreed a minimum wage for women in the District of Columbia. A 5–3 majority of the Supreme Court struck it down. Justice Sutherland wrote for the majority that the recently ratified Nineteenth Amendment, guaranteeing women the vote, meant that the sexes were equal when it came to <b>bargaining</b> <b>power</b> over working conditions; Taft, in dissent, deemed this unrealistic. Taft's dissent in Adkins was rare both because he authored few dissents, and because {{it was one of the}} few times he took an expansive view of the police power of the government.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} factors contributed to the {{collapse}} of this initial resistance and to nearly all non-Muslim majority princely states agreeing to accede to India. An important factor was the lack of unity among the princes. The smaller states did not trust the larger states to protect their interests, and many Hindu rulers did not trust Muslim princes, in particular Hamidullah Khan, the Nawab of Bhopal and a leading proponent of independence, whom they viewed as an agent for Pakistan. Others, believing integration to be inevitable, sought to build bridges with the Congress, hoping thereby to gain a say in shaping the final settlement. The resultant inability to present a united front or agree on a common position significantly reduced their <b>bargaining</b> <b>power</b> in negotiations with the Congress. The decision by the Muslim League {{to stay out of the}} Constituent Assembly was also fatal to the princes' plan to build an alliance with it to counter the Congress, and attempts to boycott the Constituent Assembly altogether failed on 28 April 1947, when the states of Baroda, Bikaner, Cochin, Gwalior, Jaipur, Jodhpur, Patiala and Rewa took their seats in the Assembly.|$|E
25|$|The union {{movement}} saw AWAs as {{an attempt}} to undermine the collective <b>bargaining</b> <b>power</b> of trade unions in the negotiation of pay and conditions of their members. Unions argued that the ordinary working person has little to no <b>bargaining</b> <b>power</b> by themselves to effectively negotiate an agreement with an employer, hence there is inherently unequal <b>bargaining</b> <b>power</b> for the contract. For exceptional individuals in a workplace, or industries with a labor shortage, the union movement argues that common law contracts are sufficient. They also believe that while commercial law and common law provides for fairness and equality of <b>bargaining</b> <b>power,</b> AWAs were designed to entrench inequality between an employer and their workforce with regard to pay and conditions. The policy of the ACTU was that AWAs should be abolished and that the bargaining system should contain collective bargaining rights.|$|E

Two commodities were chosen as detailed case studies: organic carrots and iceberg lettuce. By combining qualitative and quantitative data <b>bargain</b> <b>power</b> was revealed to be growing at the retailer node, and producer-retailer relations were examined in detail. Retailers use various control mechanisms that are being tightened in relation to fees and period of credit payment. Terms of trade as well as price premiums for organic carrots have been examined showing decline and contraction in comparison with the conventional carrots. The space for future producer opportunities countervailing the <b>bargain</b> <b>power</b> of the retailers, it is argued, lies in promoting an ‘organic product basket’ with relatively high utility and scarcity for the retailers. This is the case in the National Organic Association promotion through the discount chain ‘Netto’ together with various organic producers, and the planning of some producers/packagers to cooperate trans-nationally in order to countervail the growing <b>bargain</b> <b>power</b> of the Pan-European buyer organizations within the European supermarket chains...|$|R

40|$|The {{success of}} the South African {{automotive}} production industry relies on the industry support programs from the Government. The industry’s seven Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) of passenger vehicles are wholly owned by respective Multinational Companies (MNCs) and they, together with the Components suppliers, engage with the Department of Trade and Industry, as Host Country (HC), {{in the development of}} the automotive industry support programs. The research tested the Obsolescing Bargain Theory (Vernon, 1971) within the South African Automotive Industry context of three bargain cycles of the industry programmes, viz. 1989 Local Content Phase VI, the MIDP of 1995 and APDP introduced in 2013. The study explored the longitudinal interaction between automotive MNCs and the Host Country in terms of relative <b>bargain</b> <b>power</b> during the three bargain cycles. Using the qualitative single case study method, nine industry stakeholders were interviewed, and responses were triangulated with secondary data. The findings provided the following insights into the automotive industry’s <b>bargain</b> <b>power</b> relations between government and multinational companies: The relative <b>bargain</b> <b>power</b> shifted towards MNCs due to the locational disadvantage of the HC, FDI spill-over effects on components suppliers, employment and technology, as well as due to investments driven by short product cycles. Further insights emerged in terms of the collaborative nature of MNC-HC relations during the three bargain cycles due to industry significance. This research was of value in extending research on the obsolescing bargain theory, particularly in the manufacturing industry. It was also of value to the future of bargain relations between the automotive and manufacturing industries with the government, in general.

40|$|We analyze retail space-exchange {{problems}} {{where two}} or more retailers exchange their excess retail spaces to improve the utilization of their space resource. We first investigate the two-retailer space exchange problem. In order to entice both retailers with different <b>bargaining</b> <b>powers</b> to exchange their spaces, we use the generalized Nash bargaining scheme to allocate the total profit surplus between the two retailers. Next, we consider the space-exchange problem involving three or more retailers, and construct a cooperative game in characteristic function form. We show that the game is essential and superadditive, and also prove that the core is non-empty. Moreover, {{in order to find}} a unique allocation scheme that ensures the stability of the grand coalition, we propose a new approach to compute a weighted Shapley value that satisfies the core conditions and also reflects retailers’ <b>bargaining</b> <b>powers.</b> Our analysis indicates that the space exchange by more retailers can result in a higher system-wide profit surplus and thus a higher allocation to each retailer under a fair scheme...|$|R
40|$|The {{heterogeneity}} of {{services in the}} freight transport market and the presence of, imperfect information motivate {{the development of an}} empirical model for detecting market imperfection and <b>bargaining</b> <b>powers</b> of the two agents concluding a contract. The fact that agents typically bargain simultaneously on price and attributes leads to models without exogeneity assumption. The model is accordingly based on estimation of the support of the joint distribution of the price and of the attributes of the transport rather than on expectation of the price conditional to the attributes. The model proposes an innovative and, integrated approach for measuring market imperfection and <b>bargaining</b> <b>powers.</b> Furthermore, the paper examines the sensitivity of the results to the choice of attributes and, in order to detect potential market segmentation, to selection of the data. The empirical work is based on a new dataset obtained from a survey based on face-to-face interviews, providing data on the price and qualitative attributes of a set of actual contracts negotiated on the Belgian freight market.
