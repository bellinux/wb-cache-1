Another <b>ionospheric</b> <b>sounding</b> station was established at Palmas (10. 2 ° S, 48. 2 ° W; dip latitude 5. 5 ° S), Brazil, in April 2002, by UNIVAP {{in collaboration with}} the Lutheran University Center of Palmas (CEULP), Lutheran University of Brazil (ULBRA). Both the stations are equipped with digital ionosonde of the type known as Canadian Advanced Digital Ionosonde (CADI). In order to study the effects of geomagnetic storms on equatorial spread-F, we present and discuss three case studies, two from the <b>ionospheric</b> <b>sounding</b> observations at Sao Jose dos Campos (September and November 2000) and one from the simultaneous <b>ionospheric</b> <b>sounding</b> observations at Sao Jose dos Campos and Palmas (July 2003). Salient features from these ionospheric observations are presented and discussed in this paper. It has been observed that sometimes (e. g. 4 - 5 November 2000) the geomagnetic storm acts as an inhibitor (high strong spread-F season), whereas at other times (e. g. 11 - 12 July 2003) they act as an initiator (low strong spread-F season), possibly due to corresponding changes in the quiet and disturbed drift patterns during different seasons...|$|R

30|$|After {{the devastating}} 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami, {{scientific}} communities pay many interests on observing tsunami by <b>ionospheric</b> <b>sounding</b> (Artru et al. 2005; Liu et al. 2006; Occhipinti et al. 2006; Mai and Kiang 2009; Hickey et al. 2010; Rolland et al. 2010; Galvan et al. 2011; Liu et al. 2011; Makela et al. 2011; Iyemori et al. 2013; Occhipinti et al. 2013). Due {{to the high}} spatial and temporal resolution, total electron content (TEC) derived from ground-based GPS has widely been used as the observations in the studies. The tsunami-driven TIDs are observed in ionosphere TEC after many tsunami events using ground-based GPS stations, suggesting that the ionosphere is sensitive to the tsunami waves and the <b>ionospheric</b> <b>sounding</b> has the potential application in tsunami warning.

These measurements are obtained through the use of both passive and active (sounding) means over broad frequency ranges. The frequency range of interest extends from less than 1 Hz to 40 MHz for passive measurements, from approximately 1 kHz to a few MHz for magnetospheric and <b>ionospheric</b> <b>sounding,</b> and between 1 and approximately 10 MHz for subsurface radar sounding.

The dominant mechanism for the transverse bulk heating is resonant ion heating by wave-particle ion trapping. Using a linear kinetic dispersion relation for a magnetized, collisional, homogenous, and multiion plasma, it is found that collisional electrostatic ion cyclotron waves near the NO(+), O 2 (+), and O(+) gyrofrequencies are unstable to field-aligned currents of 50 microA/sq m for a typical bottomside ionosphere...|$|R

40|$|A new <b>ionospheric</b> <b>sounding</b> station using a Canadian Advanced Digital Ionosonde (CADI) was {{established}} for routine measurements by the "Universidade do Vale do Paraiba (UNIVAP) " at S&# 227;o Jos&# 233; dos Campos (23. 2 ° S, 45. 9 ° W), Brazil, in August 2000. A major geomagnetic storm with gradual commencement at about 01 : 00  UT was observed on 31  March  2001. In this paper, we present and discuss salient features from the <b>ionospheric</b> <b>sounding</b> measurements {{carried out at}} S. J. Campos on the three consecutive UT days 30  March (quiet), 31  March (disturbed) and 1  April (recovery) 2001. During most of the storm period, the fo F 2 values showed negative phase, whereas during the two storm-time peaks, large F-region height variations were observed. In order to study the longitudinal differences observed in the F-region during the storm, the simultaneous <b>ionospheric</b> <b>sounding</b> measurements carried out at S. J. Campos, El Arenosillo (37. 1 ° N, 6. 7 ° W), Spain, Okinawa (26. 3 ° N, 127. 8 ° E), Japan and Wakkanai (45. 5 ° N, 141. 7 ° E), Japan, during the period 30  March- 1  April 2001, have been analyzed. A comparison of the observed ionospheric parameters (h'F and fo F 2) in the two longitudinal zones (1. Japanese and 2. Brazilian-Spanish) shows both similarities and differences associated with the geomagnetic disturbances. Some latitudinal differences are also observed in the two longitudinal zones. In addition, global ionospheric TEC maps from the worldwide network of GPS receivers are presented, showing widespread TEC changes during both the main and recovery phases of the storm. The <b>ionospheric</b> <b>sounding</b> measurements are compared with the ASPEN-TIMEGCM model runs appropriate for the storm conditions. The model results produce better agreement during the quiet period. During the disturbed period, some of the observed F-region height variations are well reproduced by the model results. The model fo F 2 and TEC results differ considerably during the recovery period and indicate much stronger negative phase at all the stations, particularly at the low-latitude ones...|$|R

40|$|A {{very intense}} {{geomagnetic}} storm (superstorm) began with storm sudden commencement (SSC) at 08 : 03 UT on 20 November 2003, {{as a result}} of the coronal mass ejection (CME) by sunspot 484 hurled into space on 18 November 2003. The geomagnetic storm attained | D st | max = 472 nT at 20 : 00 UT (20 November). In this paper we present the simultaneous <b>ionospheric</b> <b>sounding</b> observations, using the Canadian Advanced Digital Ionosondes (CADIs), carried out from Palmas (PAL; 10. 2 ° S, 48. 2 ° W; dip latitude 5. 5 ° S; a near equatorial station) and São José dos Campos (SJC; 23. 2 ° S, 45. 9 ° W; dip latitude 17. 6 ° S; station located under the crest of equatorial ionospheric anomaly), Brazil. In addition, total electron content (TEC) measurements from several GPS receiving stations in the Brazilian sector during this storm are presented. The simultaneous <b>ionospheric</b> <b>sounding</b> observations carried out at SJC and PAL, and TEC observations on 3 consecutive days viz., 19 November (quiet), 20 November (disturbed) and 21 November (recovery phase) are presented. Salient features from the ionospheric observations in the Brazilian sector during the superstorm are discussed. The difference in the observed ionospheric response at the two stations (PAL and SJC) is considerable. This is not surprising given that PAL is close to the magnetic equator and SJC is near the crest of the equatorial ionospheric anomaly (EIA). It should be pointed out that soon after the SSC (about 4 h later), the F-region critical frequency (fo F 2), the F-region peak height (hp F 2), and variations of virtual heights at different frequencies (iso-frequency plots) all show wavelike oscillations of the F-region during daytime at both the <b>ionospheric</b> <b>sounding</b> stations.

50|$|The most {{prominent}} instrument at the HAARP Station is the Ionospheric Research Instrument (IRI), a high-power radio frequency transmitter facility {{operating in the}} high frequency (HF) band.

30|$|The {{motivation}} {{behind this}} study {{lies on the}} importance of the K and related planetary Kp indices in space weather modeling. The ability to predict the K index can find application, for example, in predicting geomagnetically induced currents (GICs) (Virjanen et al. 2008). On the other hand, the K-derived planetary Kp index {{plays a key role in}} the magnetospheric and ionospheric modeling (Wing et al. 2005). Regional ionospheric models, e.g. TEC prediction models and the South African <b>Bottomside</b> <b>Ionospheric</b> Model (SABIM), take into account the local magnetic conditions by using the a index, which are directly derived from the locally recorded K index (Habarulema 2010; McKinnell 2002). An accurate model to predict the local storm time K index might, therefore, make a significant contribution towards improving ionospheric and other regional space weather models that consider magnetic activity as input.|$|R

Since the peak power of the FM/CW ionosonde is 20 W, continuous observation was possible without disturbing other radio observations and HF radio communications. The continuous observation at a fixed frequency 2. 6 MHz shows periodic variations in the virtual height and echo intensity with periods of one to several tens of minutes.
