5|$|HDMI 1.0 was {{released}} on December 9, 2002 and is a single-cable digital audio/video connector interface. The link architecture is based on DVI, using exactly the same video transmission format but sending audio and other auxiliary data during the <b>blanking</b> intervals of the video stream. HDMI 1.0 allows a maximum TMDS clock of 165MHz (4.95 Gbit/s), the same as DVI. It defined two connectors called Type A and Type B, with pinouts based on the Single-Link DVI-D and Dual-Link DVI-D connectors respectively, though the Type B connector was never used in any commercial products. HDMI 1.0 uses 8b/10b encoding for video transmission, giving it 3.96Gbit/s of video bandwidth (1920×1080 or 1920×1200 at 60Hz) and 8channel LPCM/192kHz/24-bit audio. HDMI 1.0 supported only 24bit/px color depth and required support for RGB video, with optional support for YCBCR 4:4:4 and 4:2:2 (mandatory if the device had support for YCBCR on other interfaces). Only the Rec. 601 and Rec. 709 color spaces were supported. HDMI 1.0 allowed only specific pre-defined video formats to be transmitted, including all the formats defined in EIA/CEA-861-B {{as well as some}} additional formats listed in the HDMI Specification itself. All HDMI sources are also required to be capable of sending or receiving native Single-Link DVI video and be fully compliant with the DVI Specification.|$|E
5|$|Since {{being brought}} to London Belfast has twice been drydocked {{as part of the}} ship’s {{long-term}} preservation. In 1982 she was docked at Tilbury, and in June 1999 Belfast was towed to Portsmouth. This {{was the first time she}} had been to sea in 28 years and thus required a Certificate of Seaworthiness from the Maritime and Coastguard Agency. While in dock, her entire hull was cleaned, blasted, and repainted, her hull <b>blanking</b> plates inspected and an ultrasonic survey carried out. She is not expected to require further drydocking until 2020. While under tow to Portsmouth she was delayed by bad weather and arrived a day late: it had been intended that she would arrive on 6 June 1999, the fifty-fifth anniversary of the Normandy landings. During the maintenance work, Belfast hull and topsides were repainted in her specific camouflage scheme officially known as Admiralty Disruptive Camouflage Type 25, which she had worn from November 1942 to July 1944. This was objected to by some, due to the anachronistic conflict between her camouflage, which reflects the majority of her active Second World War service, and her present configuration, which was the result of the ship's extended refit from January 1956 to May 1959. With the establishment of the Department for Culture, Media and Sport's (DCMS) Advisory Committee on National Historic Ships in 2006, Belfast was listed as part of the National Historic Fleet.|$|E

40|$|Tailor-welded <b>blanks</b> made of dissimilar, uniform or {{non-uniform}} thickness {{materials have}} potential applications in automobile industries. Compared {{to the base}} metal, the formability of tailor-welded <b>blank</b> is less due {{to the presence of}} weld area and strength mismatch between component <b>blanks.</b> Most sheet metals used to produce tailor-welded <b>blanks</b> have anisotropy induced during pre-processing stage due to large deformation. The orientation of the <b>blank</b> sheet rolling direction and the combination of the <b>blank</b> sheet materials has significant influence on the deformation behaviour. The effect of anisotropy in the tailor-welded <b>blank</b> and the orientation of <b>blank</b> sheets rolling direction during deep-drawing process are investigated in this study. Finite element analysis of deep-drawing mild steel and dual-phase steel tailor-welded <b>blank</b> models was carried out using research purpose FE code DD 3 IMP; to form a basis for tailor-welded <b>blank</b> design and development for a part. Anisotropy in the <b>blank</b> sheets has moderate influence and its contribution to increased material flow depends on the mechanical properties of the <b>blank</b> sheets.

40|$|<b>Blank</b> {{design is}} an {{important}} task in sheet metal forming process optimization. The initial <b>blank</b> shape has direct effect on the part quality. This paper presents a deformation based <b>blank</b> design approach to determine the initial <b>blank</b> shape for a formed part. The <b>blank</b> design approach is integrated separately into ABAQUS, and DD 3 IMP, a research purpose in-house FEA code, to demonstrate its compatibility with any FEA code. The algorithm uses FE results to optimize the <b>blank</b> shape for a part. Deep drawing simulation of a rectangular cup geometry was carried out with an initial <b>blank</b> shape determined empirically. The <b>blank</b> shape was iteratively modified, based on the deformation history, until an optimal <b>blank</b> shape for the part is achieved. The optimal <b>blank</b> shapes predicted by the algorithm using both FEA softwares were similar. Marginal differences in the shape error indicate that the deformation history based push/pull technique can effectively determine an optimal <b>blank</b> shape for a part with any FEA software. For the shape error selected, both procedures estimate the optimal <b>blank</b> shape for the part within five iterations. Peer reviewe...|$|R
