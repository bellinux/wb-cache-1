5|$|In 1847, King Kamehameha III {{issued a}} one-cent coin, most likely {{struck by a}} firm in New England. It was unpopular with merchants, who {{preferred}} not {{to deal with such}} small amounts. Some were issued in change in government transactions, <b>but</b> <b>only</b> <b>about</b> 12,000 ever circulated. The failure caused the government to reconsider plans to issue more denominations of coins.|$|E
5|$|Nintendo sold 383,642 {{units of}} F-Zero X in North America and 97,684 units in Japan. In its {{first week of}} sale in Japan, 56,457 copies were sold, <b>but</b> <b>only</b> <b>about</b> one fifth {{of that in the}} {{following}} week reportedly due to the Nintendo 64 having had a small dedicated fanbase there.|$|E
5|$|Studies suggest {{antiparasitic}} treatment {{leads to}} parasitological cure {{in more than}} 90% of infants <b>but</b> <b>only</b> <b>about</b> 60–85% of adults treated {{in the first year}} of acute phase Chagas disease. Children aged six to 12 years with chronic disease have a cure rate of about 60% with benznidazole. While the rate of cure declines the longer an adult has been infected with Chagas, treatment with benznidazole has been shown to slow the onset of heart disease in adults with chronic Chagas infections.|$|E

5|$|The {{bodies of}} those killed in the {{massacre}} were exhumed in 1942 by the French, <b>but</b> <b>only</b> <b>about</b> 50 of the 97 were successfully identified. The bodies were then reburied in Le Paradis churchyard, which now forms part of the Le Paradis War Cemetery administered by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission. In 1970, a memorial plaque {{was placed on the}} barn wall where the massacre took place and a large memorial was subsequently erected beside the church.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to a lack}} of {{cartridge}} space, {{many ideas}} were abandoned during development, such as an alternate ending that the Lorasia Prince is killed by the Prince of Cannock's sister if he dies in the final battle. Some elements were later used in remakes or sequels: a subplot about the Prince of Cannock being cursed was added to the Super Famicom remake and later remakes. Also, the Promontory of Olivia in Dragon Quest III was initially an idea for Dragon Quest II. The game cartridge's ROM capacity is 1 Mbit, <b>but</b> <b>only</b> <b>about</b> 10 bytes of free space remains in final products.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{outbreak}} of the First World War in August 1914, an Expeditionary Force of seven regular divisions was mobilised for service in France. At the same time, the Territorial Force was activated to replace them for home defence duties. The Expeditionary Force represented almost all the regular units stationed in the United Kingdom, <b>but</b> <b>only</b> <b>about</b> half the strength of the regular Army; the remainder was scattered in various stations around the Empire, mainly in India and the Mediterranean. These units were withdrawn as quickly as they could be replaced by Indian or Territorial units, and formed into new divisions to reinforce the Expeditionary Force.|$|E

5|$|While {{none of the}} {{affected}} counties or cities {{declared a state of}} emergency following the event, the Small Business Administration did approve a request by the Office of Emergency Services for a disaster declaration in late September. This formality paved the way for low interest loans for commercial or residential properties that suffered damage, <b>but</b> <b>only</b> <b>about</b> 50 claims were expected. Local authorities had trained for disasters on a regular basis, and the response to the light damage was considered smooth, though some officials sought room for improvement. Discussions followed the event, with local governments focusing on telecommunication problems, emergency power systems, and seismic safety.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} reasons for the {{reluctance}} of some dealers to sell plug-in electric vehicles. PEVs do not offer car dealers the same profits as gasoline-powered car. Plug-in electric vehicles take more time to sell because of the explaining required, which hurts overall sales and sales people commissions. Electric vehicles also may require less maintenance, resulting in loss of service revenue, and thus undermining the biggest source of dealer profits, their service departments. According to the National Automobile Dealers Association (NADS), dealers on average make {{three times as much}} profit from service as they do from new car sales. However, a NADS spokesman said there was not sufficient data to prove that electric cars would require less maintenance. According to the New York Times, BMW and Nissan are among the companies whose dealers tend to be more enthusiastic and informed, <b>but</b> <b>only</b> <b>about</b> 10% of dealers are knowledgeable on the new technology.|$|E
5|$|While the {{vocational}} proposal would not survive Khrushchev's downfall, a longer-lasting change was a related establishment of specialized high schools {{for gifted students}} or those wishing to study a specific subject. These schools were modeled after the foreign-language schools that had been established in Moscow and Leningrad beginning in 1949. In 1962, a special summer school was established in Novosibirsk {{to prepare students for}} a Siberian math and science Olympiad. The following year, the Novosibirsk Maths and Science Boarding-School became the first permanent residential school specializing in math and science. Other such schools were soon established in Moscow, Leningrad, and Kiev. By the early 1970s, over 100 specialized schools had been established, in mathematics, the sciences, art, music, and sport. Preschool education was increased as part of Khrushchev's reforms, {{and by the time he}} left office, about 22% of Soviet children attended preschool—about half of urban children, <b>but</b> <b>only</b> <b>about</b> 12% of rural children.|$|E
