5000|$|Halesowen Assembly & Pressworks Ltd was a {{small company}} based in Halesowen, West Midlands. They had an account with National Westminster Bank which in February 1968 <b>was</b> <b>overdraw</b> by £11,339. The bank was concerned, and a meeting was held. An {{agreement}} was reached whereby the bank account (which was {{to be called the}} [...] "No. 1 account") would be frozen, and a new account (the [...] "No. 2 account") would be opened. All of the company's business would go through the No. 2 account, which needed to kept in credit. The bank agreed that that arrangement should continue for four months [...] "in the absence of materially changed circumstances in the meantime." ...|$|R

The tongah allows you to draw a short arrow at a full draw length with a full sized bow, it <b>is</b> an <b>overdraw</b> device. A tongah used with a bow looks {{somewhat}} similar to a crossbow.|$|R
40|$|The morphol. and mech. {{properties}} of melt-spun and post-drawn isotactic polypropylene (iPP) tapes {{have been studied}} {{in order to examine}} their dependence on the post-draw ratio applied. Special attention is focused on the characterization of the so-called overdrawing behavior of the tapes; at a certain draw ratio, a change of the optical appearance of the tape from transparent to opaque <b>is</b> obsd. <b>Overdrawing</b> <b>is</b> accompanied with changes in the mech. properties, surface, and morphol. of the tapes. For post-draw ratios without overdrawing, and for highly overdrawn tapes, the variation in the mech. properties measured is very small, but for slightly overdrawn tapes, a large scattering of mech. properties has been measured. In the latter case, this behavior is related to the start of internal delamination of the tapes during post drawing. It is shown that strongly overdrawn tapes have excellent mech. properties, in particular, high specific stiffness and strength...|$|R
60|$|On {{the next}} day he went into the City, and changed his mother's cheque. This was done after a little hesitation: The money was given to him, but a gentleman from behind the desks begged him to remind Lady Carbury that she <b>was</b> <b>overdrawing</b> her account. 'Dear, dear;' said Sir Felix, as he {{pocketed}} the notes, 'I'm sure she was unaware of it.' Then he paid for his passage from Liverpool to New York under the name of Walter Jones, and felt as he did so that the intrigue was becoming very deep. This was on Tuesday. He dined again at the club, alone, and in the evening went to the Music Hall. There he remained, from ten till nearly twelve, very angry at the non-appearance of Ruby Ruggles. As he smoked and drank in solitude, he almost made up his mind that he had intended to tell her of his departure for New York. Of course he would have done no such thing. But now, should she ever complain on that head he would have his answer ready. He had devoted his last night in England to the purpose of telling her, and she had broken her appointment. Everything would now be her fault. Whatever might happen to her she could not blame him.|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2017 Mexico City is sinking quickly, {{in parts}} up to nine inches {{a year and}} in total thirty feet since its {{foundation}} in 1325. Mexico City {{was built on the}} lake bed of Lake Texcoco. The original inhabitants of the city, the Méxica, worked with the water and worshiped the water god, Tlaloc, often through sacrifice. The city then fell to the Spaniards who in ignorance attempted to control the water and drained the lake, allowing for further expansion of the city. Mexico City continued to grow and drill wells that <b>are</b> <b>overdrawing</b> potable water from the aquifer; {{this is one of the}} main reasons the city is sinking. The city experiences seasonal flooding, which residents of Mexico City call, the "revenge of the lake. " There are no measures in place to capture the rain or try and use it to help any of the city's problems with water. In order to end the cyclical nature of revenge, the city must sacrifice drawing water from their aquifer and look to alternative solutions for potable water. This design explores natural treatment of rain and waste water, recycling water, and storing treated water. Through a number of explorations, the design provides a precedent for how the city should re-examine its relationship with water: water as a source of value, not only as a resource...|$|R
50|$|Another {{practice}} which {{contributed to}} the scandal was that House members <b>were</b> allowed to <b>overdraw</b> their accounts, provided that the overdraft did not exceed the member's next paycheck. Many House members used this practice to take unauthorized advances on their paychecks which they would repay in the future. In a corporate context the practice of drawing {{money out of the}} corporation's accounts for personal use is a violation of fiduciary duty to the corporation's shareholders.|$|R
5000|$|Some audits have {{revealed}} financial mismanagement, {{especially at the}} local level. In fiscal year 2000, {{more than half of}} the local agencies either did not get a [...] "clean audit" [...] or didn't spend the required percentage of funds on child care subsidies. Also in fiscal year 2000, the program <b>was</b> cited for <b>overdrawing</b> its bank accounts by $5.5 million. Karen Ponder, the director of the program at the time, responded that the issues were [...] "the kinds of things young organizations always have".|$|R
30|$|Power Miniser Sushil Kumar Shinde, who was {{promoted}} to Minister of Home Affairs exactly {{on the day of}} the blackout, stated that the long-term overdraw of power by some states may be responsible for this massive accident. He, however, did not explain why such severe <b>overdraw</b> <b>was</b> not prevented. The government investigation report summarized the causes of the blackouts, which include: poor grid infrastructure, overloading of interconnection lines, mal-operations of protection systems, the absence of authoritative top-level to state-level control, etc. Suggestions were also given by the report to encourage better coordination between the top and region level controls, forced primary frequency regulation and effective under-frequency and under-voltage load shedding, etc. [5].|$|R
5000|$|Scene {{complexity}} can <b>be</b> {{increased by}} <b>overdrawing,</b> which happens when [...] "an object {{is drawn to}} the frame buffer, and then another object (such as a wall) is drawn on top of it, covering it up. The time spent drawing the first object was wasted because it isn't visible." [...] When a sequence of scenes is extremely complex (many pixels have to be drawn for each scene), the frame rate for the sequence may drop. When designing graphics intensive applications, one can determine whether the application is fillrate-limited (or shader limited) by seeing if the frame rate increases dramatically when the application runs at a lower resolution or in a smaller window.|$|R
5000|$|In India, banks offer {{cash credit}} {{accounts}} to businesses {{to finance their}} [...] "working capital" [...] requirements (requirements to buy raw materials or [...] "current assets", as opposed to machinery or buildings, which would be called [...] "fixed assets"). The cash credit account is similar to current accounts {{as it is a}} running account (i.e., payable on demand) with cheque book facility. But unlike ordinary current accounts, which are supposed to be overdrawn only occasionally, the cash credit account is supposed to be overdrawn almost continuously. The extent of <b>overdrawing</b> <b>is</b> limited to the cash credit limit that the bank sanctioned. This sanction is based on an assessment of the maximum working capital requirement of the organization minus the margin. The organization finances the margin amount from its own funds.|$|R
5000|$|The {{choice of}} Daszyński as Speaker of the Sejm aggravated {{relations}} {{between the government and}} parliament. The reason for the conflict was the [...] "Czechowicz case", named after Treasury Minister Gabriel Czechowicz, who <b>was</b> accused of <b>overdrawing</b> the budget for 1928. Some money came from the disposable fund of the Prime Minister. However, it was used by the BBWR during the election campaign. The Sejm passed a proposal to bring Czechowicz before the Polish State Tribunal, but did not venture to bring Piłsudski himself to account for it. Despite this, in June 1928 Daszyński met Piłsudski with a proposal to form a coalition of the BBWR, the PPS and the Polish People's Party [...] "Wyzwolenie" [...] (PSL [...] "Liberation"). However, Piłsudski rejected this offer. As a result, in mid-September 1929, the Centrolew, an alliance of six parliamentary groups opposing rehabilitation was created.|$|R

They have been very much heavier than I expected. As it <b>is,</b> I <b>overdrew</b> my account at my brother's, and have been obliged to draw money from my agents in Calcutta. A year sooner or later (unless two of our senior {{officers}} had died, when I should have got my promotion and full colonel's pay with it, and proposed to remain in this country)--a year sooner or later, what does it matter? Clive will go away and work at his art, and see the great schools of painting while I am absent. I thought at one time how pleasant {{it would be to}} accompany him. But l'homme propose, Pendennis. I fancy now a lad is not the better for being always tied to his parent's apron-string. You young fellows are too clever for me. I haven't learned your ideas or read your books. I feel myself very often an old damper in your company. I will go back, sir, where I have some friends, where I am somebody still. I know an honest face or two, white and brown, that will lighten up in the old regiment when they see Tom Newcome again. God bless you, Arthur. You young fellows in this country have such cold ways that we old ones hardly know how to like you at first. James Binnie and I, when we first came home, used to talk you over, and think you laughed at us. But you didn't, I know. God Almighty bless you, and send you a good wife, and make a good man of you. I have bought a watch, which I would like you to wear in remembrance of me and my boy, to whom you were so kind when you were boys together in the old Grey Friars." [...] I took his hand, and uttered some incoherent words of affection and respect. Did not Thomas Newcome merit both from all who knew him? ...|$|R
50|$|AOP {{is usually}} treated by blood {{transfusion}} but the indications for this are still unclear. Blood transfusions have {{the risk of}} incompatibility and transfusion reactions as well as viral infections. Also, blood transfusions are costly and add to parental anxiety. The best treatment in prevention is minimizing the amount of blood drawn from the infant. It is found that since blood loss attributable to laboratory testing is {{the primary cause of}} anemia among preterm infants during the first weeks of life, we quantified blood lost attributable to phlebotomy overdraw, something that might be avoided. A study was done to see when and if <b>overdraw</b> <b>was</b> a problem. They recorded all of the data that could be of influence such as the test performed, the blood collection container used, the infants location (neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) and intermediate intensive care unit), the infant’s weight sampling and the phlebotomist’s level of experience, work shift, and clinical role. Infants were classified by weight into 3 groups: <1 kg, 1 to 2 kg, and >2 kg. The volume of blood removed was calculated by subtracting the weight of the empty collection container from that of the container filled with blood. They found that the mean volume of blood drawn for the 578 tests exceeded that requested by the hospital laboratory by 19.0% ± 1.8% per test. The main factors of overdraw was: collection in blood containers without fill-lines, lighter weight infants and critically ill infants being cared for in the NICU.|$|R
50|$|Overblowing is an {{important}} modern technique among players of some harmonica types, notably the standard Richter-tuned harmonica or blues harp. Combined with note bending, it yields the full chromatic scale across the instrument's range. Though pioneered on Richter-tuned harps, overblowing, or the related <b>overdrawing,</b> <b>is</b> possible on any harmonica having both a blow reed and a draw reed mounted in the same airway (i.e., behind the same mouthpiece hole), but no windsaver valve on the higher-pitched of the two reeds. While superficially resembling in its pitch-jumping effect the overblowing of other (beating-reed, aerophone, brass) wind instruments, harmonica overblowing is completely unrelated {{from the standpoint of}} the underlying physics. It does not induce the sounding reed to sound a higher overtone - free reed overtones do not even begin to approximate the harmonic series nor are they particularly musical - nor does it induce a higher vibrational mode in air in a pipe or other resonator - harmonicas generally have no such resonator. Rather, it silences the sounding reed while eliciting sound from the formerly silent one - the one that normally responds to air flowing in the opposite direction. A key fact for understanding both overblowing and bending on such an instrument: a free reed mounted over a reedplate slot will normally respond to air flows that pull it initially into the slot, i.e., as a closing reed, but, at only slightly higher air pressure from the opposite side, will also respond as an opening reed; the resulting pitch is generally just less than a semitone higher than the closing-reed pitch.|$|R
40|$|Prepaid {{products}} {{can become an}} effective instrument for banking the poor, {{as they can be}} used for collecting microdeposits and so operate as a low-cost account. Prepaid platforms have characteristics that make them especially useful for developing low-cost microfinance business models. Indeed, customers using prepaid systems do not need bank accounts or debit or credit cards. Prepaid issuers do not need to develop or invest in new technologies, as this mechanism can be used on a range of platforms, including PCs, mobile phones, hand-held and set-top boxes. Furthermore, prepaid products are specially designed for offering services demanded by the poor, such as micropayments, microdeposits and even microcredits. Lastly, they allow users to monitor their cash flow by receiving statements (some providers offer this feature online, others provide physical statements) or accessing balances through PCs, mobile phones, hand-held and set-top boxes. Besides collecting microdeposits, prepaid products (or SVCs as they are called in the United States) offer other services that can be very valuable for serving the unbanked population. As explained in this paper, prepaid products generally lack the identification and credit requirements that effectively bar millions of individuals from opening traditional bank accounts, especially in the United States. Moreover, prepaid {{products can}} be purchased and reloaded at a growing number of locations other than bank branches, such as check cashers, convenience stores and other retailers. Prepaid instruments can also provide immediate availability of funds at a cost that, in some cases, is lower than other alternatives for unbanked consumers. Also, prepaid products <b>are</b> difficult to <b>overdraw,</b> thus reducing the likelihood of unexpected fees. Lastly, many prepaid issuers offer some sort of bill pay option, especially branded cards that enable signature-based transactions, and a significant number of them offer remittances.
