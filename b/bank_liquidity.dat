40|$|This paper studies <b>banking</b> <b>liquidity</b> crises {{under the}} {{assumption}} that the government may have private benefits in bailing-out a collapsing banking sector for reputation concerns. This political distortion feeds political uncertainty, as citizens may not agree with a bailout decision and overthrow the government. This paper shows that higher political uncertainty increases both financial and political instabilities as it enlarges the set of parameters for which bank runs and the dismissal of the government are optimal. Higher political uncertainty may stem from the occurrence of a politico-financial crisis in another similar country. Contagion takes place if citizens update their beliefs on the type of their government. Doing so, they may reinforce their beliefs that the government is self-interested and bank bailouts are not socially optimal.

40|$|The {{excess of}} <b>banks</b> <b>liquidity</b> in the CEMAC zone, {{following}} the banking restructuring, brought the monetary authorities {{to undertake a}} certain number of reforms.

It is evident from results of the evaluation that this phenomenon depends strongly on the economic and financial structures of every CEMAC’s country. To the level of the zone, only the credit to the private sector could reduce the liquidity in excess. In the same way, this situation reduces the efficiency of the monetary channel. This inefficiency of the monetary channel explains itself by the weak adjustment of the rate of the inter-bank market following an expansive monetary policy. These results confirms the necessity for the monetary authorities to implement actions aiming to increase the offer of credit to the private sector. ...|$|R
40|$|In the rst essay {{we look at}} the Danish {{interbank market}} and how it functioned during the nancial crisis. Prior to the nancial crisis the view seemed to be that the money markets were well {{functioning}} and capable of handling stress in nancial markets. This is the conclusion in Fur ne (2001, 2002) who analysis the US money market during the crisis in the autumn of 1998 where Russia e ectively defaulted on its sovereign debt. However, the recent nancial crisis was a lot more severe than the one in 1998. During the recent crisis we have seen the volatility of money market rates spike and many central banks have conducted unconventional monetary policies. Whether the interbank markets are robust is thus a relevant question again. A key element in our analysis is that the total amount of liquidity in the interbank market is constant when central bank interventions are absent. A negative shock to one <b>bank's</b> <b>liquidity</b> holdings should correspond with a positive shock for another <b>bank's</b> <b>liquidity</b> holding. In a market with no frictions, <b>banks</b> faced with <b>liquidity</b> shocks should be able to absorb these by borrowing from those with surplus liquidity...|$|R

40|$|Liquidity risk is {{a crucial}} and {{inherent}} feature of the business model of banks. While banks and regulators use sophisticated mathematical methods to measure a bank's solvency risk, they use relatively simple tools for a <b>bank's</b> <b>liquidity</b> risk such as coverage ratios, sensitivity analyses, and scenario analyses. In this thesis we present a more rigorous framework {{that allows us to}} measure a <b>bank's</b> <b>liquidity</b> risk within the standard economic capital and RAROC setting. In particular, we introduce the concept of liquidity cost profiles as a quantification of a bank's illiquidity at balance sheet level, which leads subsequently to the concept of liquidity-adjusted risk measures defined on the vector space of balance sheet positions under liquidity call functions. We study the model-free effects of adding, scaling, and mixing balance sheets. In particular, we show that convexity and positive super-homogeneity of the underlying risk measures is preserved in terms of positions under the liquidity adjustment, given certain moderate conditions are met, while coherence is not, reflecting the common idea that size does matter in the face of liquidity risk. We also show that a liquidity-adjustment of the well-known Euler capital allocation principle is possible without losing the soundness property that justifies the principle. However, it is in general not possible to combine soundness with the total allocation property for both the numerator and the denominator in liquidity-adjusted RAROC. Liquidity-adjusted risk measures could be a useful addition to banking regulation and bank management as they capture essential features of a <b>bank's</b> <b>liquidity</b> risk, can be combined with existing risk management systems, possess reasonable properties under portfolio manipulations, and lead to an intuitive risk ranking of banks...|$|R
