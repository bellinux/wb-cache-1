In quadrant II, consumption data are considered relatively accurate since the investigation data are more detailed and frequent.

In other words, the data quality of these two items is not a concern of the statistical system. It is not difficult to explain why their coherencies are questioned by IS indicators.|$|R

In this paper, the long-term water <b>balance</b> <b>items</b> of the Poyang Lake have been analyzed to reveal the coupling effects of Three Gorges Dam (TGD) and droughts on the water balance of Poyang Lake. The results indicate that: (1) the water <b>balance</b> <b>items</b> of Poyang Lake vary greatly, e.g. lake precipitation and inflow decrease during the past several decades while evaporation and water consumption increase significantly; (2) the water balance of Poyang Lake has been affected by the operation of TGD. Negative lake water balance in recent years leads to a serious {{water shortage}} problem in the Poyang Lake. Moreover, the operation of TGD also changed the river–lake relationship in the lower Yangtze River basin; (3) the coupling effects of drought and TGD on the lake water balance has been analyzed by using composite analysis method and it can be found that the operation of TGD has significantly altered the lake water balance. But it is not the only factor that affects the lake water balance, and the droughts might cause their relations to be much more complicated.|$|R

5000|$|GNI {{is defined}} in {{accordance}} with the European system of national and regional accounts. GNI represents total primary income receivable by resident institutional units: compensation of employees, taxes on production and imports less subsidies, property income (interest, dividends and reinvested earnings from foreign direct investment receivable less payable), gross operating surplus and gross mixed income. It corresponds to the better known gross domestic product (GDP) minus primary income payable by resident units to non-resident units, plus primary income receivable by resident units {{from the rest of the}} world. Technically speaking, the GNI is a <b>balancing</b> <b>item</b> of the allocation of primary income account in the sequence of accounts for the total economy. Loosely speaking, it is the sum of domestic and foreign income earned by the resident population of a country. It is worth noting that GNI is income from productive activities excluding any capital gains and losses (also known as [...] "holding gains and losses") resulting from price changes of fixed or financial assets (for example: price changes on the stock market have no direct impact on GNI).|$|E
50|$|Transactions can {{be grouped}} broadly {{according}} to {{purpose in the}} following accounts;the production account displays the transactions involved in the generation of income by the production of goods and services. For {{each of the four}} sectors (the rest of the world does not have a production account), the <b>balancing</b> <b>item,</b> gross value added, is shown as output less intermediate consumption.Gross value added at basic prices for each sector differs from gross domestic product for the UK total economy. The difference occurs because taxes less subsidies on products are not included in the production account by sector and are instead included within resources for the UK total economy. The sum of gross value added and taxes less subsidies on products for the UK economy is equal to GDP at market prices.The distribution and use of income accounts exist for all the institutional sectors. These accounts describe the distribution and redistribution of income and its use in the form of final consumption. The distribution and use of income are analysed in four stages, each of which is presented as a separate account.|$|E
