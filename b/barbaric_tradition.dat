5000|$|... "Bad Luck" [...] {{received}} positive reviews. Les Chappell from The A.V. Club {{gave the}} episode a [...] "B+" [...] rating and wrote, [...] "'Bad Luck,' the show's return after a month-long hiatus, is an episode that {{is representative of}} the groove that Grimm has found itself in. The episode is largely a monster-of-the-week affair, in this case establishing the <b>barbaric</b> <b>tradition</b> that the left feet of a rabbit-like Wesen called Villeharra are considered potent symbols of luck and fertility. A hunter is doing good business marketing to desperate couples looking to conceive, farming a Villeharra family whenever he gets a new client. For an episode that's got an innately silly idea behind it, there's some genuinely good horror beats it gets — particularly early on, when the combination of axe-wielding murderer and teenager in letter jacket recreates the slasher movie beats and does so without being campy." ...|$|E
5000|$|If Collé {{represents}} African {{women who}} awaken to resist patriarchal control, then her daughter's fiance Ibrahima, a rich, upstanding, and open-minded young man living in France, one of Africa's former colonizers, who returns, filmically representing the enlightened elite educated abroad who is welcomed home and observes the <b>barbaric</b> <b>tradition</b> of his village home. His knowledge, money and {{technologies such as}} television are appreciated. He witnesses a funeral of two little girls, who desperately drowned themselves in a well to avoid the mutilation of their genitals. The girls' relatives are sad, but the incident does not lead the villagers to question the tradition. Ibrahima is shocked and worried by this scene which keeps fermenting in his mind. Meanwhile, Ibrahima's father wants him to renounce his engagement to Amasatou, and marry his innocent eleven-year-old cousin instead, who has already undergone female genital cutting. Ibrahima refuses to do so, recognizing such an act as child abuse, and visits Amasatou's house despite what the villagers say. He confirms her as his fiancée, regardless of her [...] "impure" [...] status according to the local tradition.|$|E
5000|$|Sepúlveda {{put forward}} {{many of the}} {{arguments}} from his Latin dialogue Democrates Secundus sive de justi belli causis, to assert that the <b>barbaric</b> <b>traditions</b> of the Indians justified waging war against them. The Spaniards, according to Sepúlveda, were entitled to punish other peoples for performing such vicious practices as idolatry, sodomy, and cannibalism. Wars had to be waged [...] "in order to uproot crimes that offend nature". This was an obligation to which every Spaniard, whether secular or religious, had to conform.|$|R
5000|$|Nawa {{describes}} {{the story of}} Darya, a 12-year-old opium bride in the Ghoryan district given by her father to a creditor 34 years her senior to liquidate his opium debts. The girl is initially resistant to the marriage, telling Nawa, [...] "I {{do not want to}} go with this man. Can you please help me?" [...] She ultimately concedes to her father's wishes and marries the smuggler who lives hours away. After several months of no contact between Darya and the family, her mother beseeches Nawa to search for her. Nawa attempts to find the child, saying, [...] "I was immediately attracted to the young girl because she was a mystery and a victim who needed to be saved from <b>barbaric</b> <b>traditions.</b> I thought it was my job as an outsider from the West to rescue her." [...] But ultimately, she must give up because of danger from the child's husband and because the search takes her to the Helmand Province, a perilous place. Nawa believes that Darya will save herself by standing up to her husband, escaping him, or discovering how to cope with her situation. She writes, [...] "Darya offers hope for change. I will always {{want to know what happened}} to her, and perhaps someday I will." ...|$|R
60|$|It was {{no longer}} a riddle that little {{immediate}} things should seem of more importance than great and final things. For man is a creature thrusting his way up from the beast to divinity, from the blindness of individuality to the knowledge of a common end. We stand deep in the engagements of our individual lives looking up to God, and only realizing in our moments of exaltation that through God we can escape from and rule and alter the whole world-wide scheme of individual lives. Only in phases of illumination do we realize the creative powers that lie ready to man's hand. Personal affections, immediate obligations, ambitions, self-seeking, these are among the natural and essential things of our individual lives, as intimate almost as our primordial lusts and needs; God, the true God, is a later revelation, a newer, less natural thing in us; a knowledge still remote, uncertain, and confused with superstition; an apprehension as yet entangled with <b>barbaric</b> <b>traditions</b> of fear and with ceremonial surgeries, blood sacrifices, and the maddest barbarities of thought. We are only beginning to realize that God is here; so far as our minds go he is still not here continually; we perceive him and then again we are blind to him. God is the last thing added to the completeness of human life. To most His presence is imperceptible throughout their lives; they know as little of him as a savage knows of the electric waves that beat through us for ever from the sun. All this appeared now so clear and necessary to Scrope that he was astonished he had ever found the quality of contradiction in these manifest facts.|$|R
60|$|Among {{the various}} forms of science which are {{reaching}} and affecting the new popular tradition, we have reckoned Anthropology. Pleasantly enough, Anthropology has herself but recently emerged from that limbo of the unrecognised in which Psychical Research is pining. The British Association used to reject anthropological papers as 'vain dreams based on travellers' tales.' No doubt the British Association would reject a paper on clairvoyance as a vain dream based on old wives' fables, or on hysterical imposture. Undeniably the study of such themes is hampered by fable and fraud, just as anthropology has to be ceaselessly on its guard against 'travellers' tales,' against European misunderstandings of savage ideas, and against civilised notions and scientific theories unconsciously read into <b>barbaric</b> customs, rites, <b>traditions,</b> and usages. Man, ondoyant et divers, is the subject alike of anthropology and of psychical research. Man (especially savage man) cannot be secluded from disturbing influences, and watched, like the materials of a chemical experiment in a laboratory. Nor can man be caught in a 'primitive' state: his intellectual beginnings lie very far behind the stage of culture in which we find the lowest known races. Consequently the matter on which anthropology works is fluctuating; the evidence on which it rests needs the most sceptical criticism, and many of its conclusions, in the necessary absence of historical testimony as to times far behind the lowest known savages, must be hypothetical.|$|R
