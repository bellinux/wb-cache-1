5|$|In September 1987, B-1B (s/n 84-0052) {{from the}} 96th Bomb Wing, 338th Combat Crew Training Squadron, Dyess AFB crashed near La Junta, Colorado while flying on a {{low-level}} training route. This {{was the only}} B-1B crash to occur with six crew members aboard. The two crew members in jump seats, {{and one of the}} four crew members in ejection seats perished. The root cause of the accident was thought to be a <b>bird</b> <b>strike</b> on a wing's leading edge during the low-level flight. The impact was severe enough to sever fuel and hydraulic lines {{on one side of the}} aircraft, the other side's engines functioned long enough to allow for ejection. The B-1B fleet was later modified to protect these supply lines.|$|E

40|$|<b>Bird</b> <b>strikes</b> are an {{increasing}} concern for military and civil aviation as airport operations and bird populations continue to increase. The number of reported <b>bird</b> <b>strikes</b> by civil aviation has escalated more than three-fold {{in the last}} decade, {{with the majority of}} <b>bird</b> <b>strikes</b> occurring in the immediate vicinity of the airport [...] below 3, 000 ft and within 5 miles (Cleary, et al., 2000) ...|$|R
40|$|Management {{of problem}} {{wildlife}} within the airfield environment {{is a difficult}} job. Today’s Bird–Animal Aircraft Strike Hazard (BASH) program managers require {{as much information as}} possible to accomplish their tasks. Bird censuses and actual bird-strike events in and around the air operations area are used to make airfield management decisions and to assess the risk of bird hazards to aircraft. Both types of information are sampled rather sparsely. Avian radar is now being used as a new tool to provide continuous sampling of bird activity that significantly supplements visual censuses. The measure of risk used today is commonly expressed as the ratio of the number of <b>bird</b> <b>strikes</b> per 100, 000 flying hours. While important, this measure of risk is relatively insensitive to improvements in safety measures that do not result in dramatically fewer <b>bird</b> <b>strikes.</b> Stated differently, a reduction in safety or an increase in risk (which reflects an increased likelihood of <b>bird</b> <b>strikes</b> occurring) is not anticipated, but, rather, it is calculated after the fact when increases in <b>bird</b> <b>strikes</b> have been experienced. As a result, BASH managers are at a disadvantage because they can respond only after <b>bird</b> <b>strikes</b> occur. To address this deficiency, we introduce a new method for assessing risk that is based on near-miss events that complements risk calculations based on reported <b>bird</b> <b>strikes.</b> Recent advances in commercially available, digital avian tracking radars enabled biologists to automatically monitor and assess near-miss events. Near-miss events occur much more frequently than <b>bird</b> <b>strikes.</b> A combined dataset of <b>bird</b> <b>strikes</b> and near-misses provides BASH managers with a more responsive metric to evaluate the success of their program over time than by using only the bird-strike dataset...|$|R

40|$|The hazards birds pose to {{aircraft}} {{has been}} of concern to the Air Force for more than 20 years. After losing several aircraft due to <b>bird</b> <b>strikes</b> in the early 19602 ̆ 7 s, the Air Force formed a team to evaluate bird hazards to Air Force aircraft. The team, from the Air Force Weapons Laboratory (AFWL) at Kirtland AFB NM, handed over this mission to the <b>Bird</b> Aircraft <b>Strike</b> Hazard (BASH) Team at HQ Air Force Engineering and Services Center (AFESC) at Tyndall AFB in 1975. In 1986 (October) the BASH team moved to Boiling AFB, Washington DC. The Air Force sustains significant losses each year to <b>bird</b> <b>strikes.</b> Since 1964 we have had 25 <b>bird</b> <b>strikes</b> that resulted in aircraft losses. In the last 12 months alone we have lost an F- 16, two F- 42 ̆ 7 s, a B-l, and six crewmen to birds on low level missions. All aircraft are susceptible to <b>bird</b> <b>strikes</b> in every flight profile. Smaller, high-speed aircraft {{are the most likely}} victims, but even large planes can be knocked down by <b>bird</b> <b>strikes.</b> <b>Birds</b> are not entirely unpredictable, however, and strikes are more likely to occur at particular times of year or times of day and around bird concentration areas. We can reduce losses by controlling or avoiding the predictable bird hazard...|$|R

40|$|<b>Bird</b> <b>strikes</b> have {{operational}} impacts {{and cause}} economic {{loss to the}} aviation industry. In the worst case, the damages resulting from <b>bird</b> <b>strikes</b> lead to crashes. The highest risk for <b>bird</b> <b>strikes</b> is in the area below 3000 ft and thus mainly in airport environments. Despite intense efforts from the airports in controlling the local bird populations, the number of <b>bird</b> <b>strikes</b> in these environments is still very high. Usually, Air Traffic Control is neither integrated into the process for reducing <b>bird</b> <b>strikes</b> nor do the controllers receive any precise information about the current bird traffic situation at the airport. For the project described in this paper, we assume a different situation: Air Traffic Control is provided with a tool informing the controller about the current and predicted bird traffic at the airport. Based on this information, the controller can decide to delay departing air traffic {{in order to avoid}} potential collisions between birds and the aircraft taking off. When implementing this procedure at an airport, we expect an increase in airport safety and, due to the delaying of traffic, a reduction in runway capacity. We hypothesize, that the Relations between the settings of the alerting systems and the effects on safety and capacity are deterministic. To test this hypothesis, we will perform fast-time simulations under varying conditions. This paper describes the simulation environment created for this purpose...|$|R

25|$|The {{greatest}} {{loss of life}} {{directly linked}} to a <b>bird</b> <b>strike</b> was on October 4, 1960, when a Lockheed L-188 Electra, flying from Boston as Eastern Air Lines Flight 375, flew through a flock of common starlings during take-off, damaging all four engines.

25|$|On 19 September 2011, an AH-1W crashed during {{training}} exercises at Camp Pendleton, California, killing the two Marine crewmembers on board.

25|$|The National Transportation Safety Board {{ruled that}} Sullenberger made the correct {{decision}} in {{landing on the}} river instead of attempting return to LaGuardia because the normal procedures for engine loss are designed for cruising altitudes, not immediately after takeoff.

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{indicated}} more birds collide with communication towers equipped with red warning lights than with towers equipped with lights of shorter wavelengths. We used the U.

For both underwing- and fuselage-mounted engines, more (P ≤ 0. 04) strikes were reported for engine # 1 compared to engine # 2 during Day, Night, and Dawn/Dusk flights. These findings suggest that modifying red navigation lights to include shorter wavelengths and the use of supplemental lights specifically designed for avian vision could enhance detection and reduce <b>bird</b> <b>strikes...</b>|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a fast-time simulation environment {{for assessing the}} risk of <b>bird</b> <b>strikes</b> in aviation. An existing air traffic simulator was enhanced in order to simulate air and bird traffic simultaneously and to recognize collisions between birds and aircraft. Furthermore, a method was developed to generate bird movement information from different radar sources. The resulting set-up represents the first simulation environment to perform fast-time simulations including air traffic and bird movements. A verification with real data revealed that approximately thrice as many <b>bird</b> <b>strikes</b> occur in the simulation as in reality. When considering bird reaction to approaching aircraft, which is not covered in the simulation as well as unreported strikes, this implies an adequate result. For this reason, the simulator can serve as valuable tool to analyse the risk of <b>bird</b> <b>strikes</b> and to evaluate new Air Traffic Management concepts {{to reduce the number}} of these events.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that, {{at least in the}} Northern Hemisphere, there is a strong {{seasonal}} element in the annual pattern of <b>bird</b> <b>strikes.</b> This study undertakes a statistical analysis of an 11 year data set collected at Dublin Airport, Ireland.

Hypotheses relating to the idea of “open” (i. e. intervals of through-put of naïve and young birds) and “closed” (i. e. intervals when throughput is declining or at a minimum) periods are tested. The results are discussed {{in the context of the}} probable ability of birds to learn to avoid aircraft.
