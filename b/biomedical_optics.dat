However, certain factors limit the work-piece materials that can be processed using mechanical micromachining methods. For difficult-to-machine materials such as mold and die steels and ceramics, limitations in cutting tool and stage stiffness and strength of the micro-tool are significant problems facing the successful application of mechanical micromachining methods. In addition, in microscale cutting, the effects of tool and pre-cision motion stage deflections on part dimensional accuracy can be significant. This paper presents a novel hybrid Laser Assisted Mechanical Micromachining (LAMM) process that makes use of highly localized thermal softening of the hard material by continuous wave laser irradiation (2 - 35 W Yb-fiber laser, wavelength 1064 nm) in front of a miniature (100 - 500 µm wide) TiAlN-coated tung-sten carbide grooving tool. By suitably controlling the laser power, location, and spot size, it is pos-sible to bring about a sufficiently large decrease in the work material strength and thereby minimize catastrophic tool failure, and lower the tool forces and deflection. Despite these advantages, the LAMM process may produce a heat affected zone (HAZ) that can result in potentially undesirabl...|$|R

40|$|Light {{focusing}} plays {{a central}} role in biomedical imaging, manipulation and therapy. In scattering media, direct light focusing becomes infeasible beyond one transport mean free path. All previous methods used to overcome this diffusion limit lack a practical internal ‘guide star’. Here, we propose and experimentally validate a novel concept called time-reversed ultrasonically encoded (TRUE) optical focusing to deliver light into any dynamically defined location inside a scattering medium. First, diffused coherent light is encoded by a focused ultrasonic wave to provide a virtual internal guide star. Only the encoded light is time-reversed and transmitted back to the ultrasonic focus. The time-reversed ultrasonically encoded optical focus—defined by the ultrasonic wave—is unaffected by multiple scattering of light. Such focusing is particularly desirable in biological tissue, where ultrasonic scattering is ~ 1, 000 times weaker than optical scattering. Various fields, including <b>biomedical</b> and colloidal <b>optics,</b> can benefit from TRUE optical focusing...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Ultrafast pulsed lasers {{can be used}} {{to achieve}} remark-able {{precision}} during surgical ablation. Through nonlinear interac-tions with tissue, ultrafast lasers can provide a largely non-thermal mechanism of ablation and a unique ability to create targeted dam-age within bulk tissue. These advantages have made ultrafast lasers the ideal surgical tool for various novel applications in ophthalmol-ogy. Clinical adoption of ultrafast lasers in other surgical applica-tions remains limited in part {{due to the lack of}} a means for fiber delivery of ultrafast laser pulses as a flexible, hand-held surgical endoscope. This review provides an overview of the recent advances in bringing this unique surgical tool into the clinic. We discuss fun-damental mechanisms and limitations of ultrafast laser ablation, novel techniques for overcoming these limitations, the current state of clinical applications, and conclude with our recent efforts in de-veloping fiber-coupled probes for flexible ultrafast laser surgery and imaging.

40|$|International audienceContinuous-wave (CW) is {{the most}} widely used and commercially {{available}} technique for performing <b>biomedical</b> diffuse <b>optics</b> tomography. Nevertheless, CW has been proved to suffer from non-uniqueness problems and large source-detector distances have to be used in order to detect inclusions that are deep from the surface. In order to overcome the former drawback frequency-domain approach has been developed although it also suffers from the latter deficiency. Recently, time domain (TD) diffuse optics has attracted huge interest from the scientific community due to its inherit capacity to associate photons arrival time with the maximum depth that they have reached; the late arrival photons are the photons that have travelled most and presumably have gone deeper in the tissue. Moreover, not long ago it was proved that in TD there is no need of large source-detector distances for the reconstruction of deep layers of human tissue; in fact small source-detector separations (s. d. s.) improve the contrast and the absolute number of detected photons. However, no comparison analysis has been done in terms of reconstruction quality when using small s. d. s. In this work finite element method is used to do a computational comparison between CW and TD approaches where special emphasis is put on the quality of reconstructions 1) with an inclusion at deep levels and 2) when using small s. d. s. TD reconstructions were done using Mellin-Laplace (TD-ML) transform which is fast to calculate and stable to noise.

The model takes into account the spatially inhomogeneous distribution of skin fluorophores and their photophysical characteristics. Both the spatial distribution of fluorescence of skin tissues and the possibility of localization of a detected fluorescence signal are studied. The spatial distribution of fluorescence centers (fluorophores) in the medium is assumed to closely follow the spatial distribution of collagen fibers of the skin. The equalization of the refractive indices at the air–skin interface is shown to lead to a higher degree of localization of the fluorescence signal detected from a biosensor located in a near-surface skin lay...|$|R

The deterministic {{approach is a}} generalization of radiative transport theoryfor solving inelastic scattering problems in random media. We use the radiative transporttheory to study light propagation in luminescent media. Based on this theory, we also studythe optically thick medium. Using perturbation methods, a corrected diffusion approximation with asymptotically accurate boundary conditions and a boundary layer solution arederived. The accuracy and the efficacy {{of this approach is}} verified for a plane-parallel slabproblem.

30|$|The {{essential}} of nanotechnology is {{to synthesize}} dispersed nanoparticles for potential applications in <b>optics,</b> <b>biomedical</b> sciences, drug delivery, catalysis and electronics. In the past, number of {{methods such as}} chemical [1, 2, 3, 4], photochemical [5, 6, 7, 8] and thermal [9, 10] {{have been developed to}} synthesize metallic nanoparticles. Recently an efficient method for fabrication of metallic nanoparticles from metallomicelles is reported [11]. Among these methods, photochemical method has gained considerable attention due to its convenience, but it employs toxic chemicals as reducing and stabilizing agent [12]. To avoid the utilization of highly toxic chemicals, the use of microorganisms and plant parts for nanoparticles synthesis has been explored [13]. Previous reports mention the use of microorganisms such as Alternaria alternate [14], and Amylomyces rouxii [15] for the synthesis of nanoparticles. Recently, several plants extracts such as Annona squamosa [16], Arbutus unedo [17], Cassia angustifolia [18] and many others [19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27] have been used to synthesize silver (Ag) and gold (Au) nanoparticles (NPs). However, these natural sources, which have active ingredients, produce nanoparticles at slower rate. To overcome this, photo-assisted biosynthesis of Ag and AuNPs using many plants has been qualitatively investigated [28]. The sunlight irradiation technique has been formerly reported for the synthesis of nanoparticles using few plant materials such as Allium sativum [29], Andrachnea chordifolia [30], Piper betle [31], Bacillus amyloliquefaciens [32] and Achyranthus aspera [33]. Apart from plant materials, dendrimers and starch are also used as reducing/stabilizing agents in the sunlight-induced synthesis of nanoparticles [34, 35]. The nanoparticles produced by bio route have good stability due to the presence of capping agents like alkaloids, flavonoids and polyphenols, which are the major constituents present in the natural sources.|$|R

40|$|Functionally graded {{materials}} (FGMs) {{have been}} developed for general purpose structural components such as rocket engine components or turbine blades where the components are exposed to extreme temperatures. The earliest FGMs were introduced by Japanese scientists in the mid- 1980 s as ultra-high temperature-resistant materials for aerospace applications. Recently, these materials have found other uses in electrical devices, energy transformation, <b>biomedical</b> engineering, <b>optics,</b> etc. FGMs are microscopically inhomogeneous spatial composite materials, typically composed of a ceramic-metal or ceramic-polymer pair of materials. Therefore, it is important to investigate the behaviors of engineering structures such as beams and plates made from FGMs when they are subjected to thermal and dynamic loads for appropriate design. The material property profiles of FGMs vary across the graded direction. Therefore, using an improved third order shear deformation theory (TSDT) based on more rigorous kinetics of displacements to predict the behaviors of functionally graded beams and plates is expected to be more suitable than using other theories. Thus, in this research, the improved TSDT is used to investigate thermal buckling and elastic vibration response of functionally graded beams and plates. For the first time in this research temperature dependent material property solutions, are adopted to investigate thermal buckling results of functionally graded beams and plates. Additionally, the research includes natural frequency and forced vibration analysis of functionally graded plates subjected to a uniformly distributed dynamic load acting over the plate domain. To obtain the solutions, the Ritz method using polynomial and trigonometric functions for defining admissible displacements and rotations is applied to solve the governing equations. The numerical results are validated by published and experimental results. To clearly understand functionally graded materials beam specimens were manufactured from alumina-epoxy using a multi-step sequential infiltration technique. These beams were then subject to microscopic analysis to determine the profiles of the constituents. Finally experiments were conducted to determine the vibration characteristics and the results were compared to analysis using the improved TSDT. To compute theoretical parts in this research, the material compositions of the functionally graded beams and plates are assumed to vary smoothly and continuously throughout the thickness according to the power law distribution. Several significant aspects such as thickness and aspect ratios, materials, temperature, added mass etc. which affect analytical results are taken into account and discussed in detail. The original work in this thesis includes the application of the improved TSDT to thermal buckling and elastic vibration problems of functionally graded beams and plates. New critical buckling temperature results for the case of temperature dependent material properties have been solved by an iterative calculation technique. The results reveal that the effect of temperature dependent material on reduced buckling temperatures is more profound for a thicker beam and plate than a thinner one. The relationship between the critical temperatures and natural frequencies of the beam and plate structures are also presented and discussed...|$|R
40|$|The ongoing {{merger of}} the digital and optical {{components}} of the modern microscope is creating opportunities for new measurement techniques, along with new challenges for optical modelling. This thesis investigates several such opportunities and challenges which are particularly relevant to <b>biomedical</b> imaging. Fourier <b>optics</b> is used throughout the thesis as the underlying conceptual model, with a particular emphasis on three [...] dimensional Fourier optics. A new challenge for optical modelling provided by digital microscopy is the relaxation of traditional symmetry constraints on optical design. An extension of optical transfer function theory to deal with arbitrary lens pupil functions is presented in this thesis. This is used to chart the 3 D vectorial structure of the spatial frequency spectrum of the intensity in the focal region of a high aperture lens when illuminated by linearly polarised beam. Wavefront coding has been used successfully in paraxial imaging systems to extend the depth of field. This is achieved by controlling the pupil phase with a cubic phase mask, and thereby balancing optical behaviour with digital processing. In this thesis I present a high aperture vectorial model for focusing with a cubic phase mask, and compare it with results calculated using the paraxial approximation. The effect of a refractive index change is also explored. High aperture measurements of the point spread function are reported, along with experimental confirmation of high aperture extended depth of field imaging of a biological specimen. Differential interference contrast is a popular method for imaging phase changes in otherwise transparent biological specimens. In this thesis I report on a new isotropic algorithm for retrieving the phase from differential interference contrast images of the phase gradient, using phase shifting, two directions of shear, and non [...] iterative Fourier phase integration incorporating a modified spiral phase transform. This method does not assume that the specimen has a constant amplitude. A simulation is presented which demonstrates good agreement between the retrieved phase and the phase of the simulated object, with excellent immunity to imaging noise...|$|R
