5|$|At {{the drivers}} meeting held the Friday before the event, the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) Race Director Charlie Whiting {{announced}} that any potential blocking manoeuvres that {{interfered with the}} World Championship battle {{would result in a}} driver being shown a waved black and white flag, before giving a black flag to signal disqualification from the race. The penalty also had a potential ban for up to three Formula One World Championship events for any driver found to have breached the new ruling. Ralf Schumacher agreed with the penalties. However, McLaren team principal Ron Dennis was more vocal in opposing the new rules as he believed they were arbitrary and were against choosing team tactics. He was also unhappy with the inclusion of Italian lawyer Roberto Causo as a race steward because Dennis held the view that any decision would <b>be</b> <b>biased</b> towards Ferrari.|$|E
25|$|Playlists can {{be played}} {{randomly}} or sequentially. The randomness of the shuffle algorithm can <b>be</b> <b>biased</b> for or against playing multiple tracks from the same album or artists in sequence (a feature introduced in iTunes 5.0, and later discontinued in iTunes 8.0). iTunes DJ can also <b>be</b> <b>biased</b> towards selecting tracks with a higher star rating.|$|E

50|$|Jonathan M. Ladd, who has {{conducted}} intensive studies of media trust and media bias, {{concluded that the}} primary cause of belief in media <b>bias</b> <b>is</b> media telling their audience that particular media <b>are</b> <b>biased.</b> People who <b>are</b> told that a medium <b>is</b> <b>biased</b> tend to believe that it <b>is</b> <b>biased,</b> and this belief is unrelated to whether that medium <b>is</b> actually <b>biased</b> or not. The only other factor with as strong an influence on belief that media <b>is</b> <b>biased</b> <b>is</b> extensive coverage of celebrities. A majority of people see such media as biased, {{while at the same time}} preferring media with extensive coverage of celebrities.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{starts with}} the basic premise that the {{conventional}} measures of productivity growth, which ignore joint production of good and bad outputs, <b>are</b> <b>biased.</b> We then construct an alternative productivity growth measure using activity analysis. An application to U. S. agriculture demonstrates its usefulness. More specifically, we show that the Tornqvist index of productivity <b>is</b> <b>biased</b> upward when production of undesirable outputs or "bads" is increasing. Conversely, this same measure of productivity <b>is</b> <b>biased</b> downward when externalities in production are decreasing. Productivity Analysis,...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{estimate}} {{a model of}} the determinants of economic and social development that takes seriously three of the criticisms of panel data models in the existing growth literature: that long run coefficients <b>are</b> <b>biased</b> because the lagged dependent variable is not strictly exogenous; that they <b>are</b> <b>biased</b> because of slope coefficient heterogeneity; and that they <b>are</b> <b>biased</b> because of explanatory variable endogeneity. The model indicates that there are strong causal relationships in both directions between on the one hand, economic development, and on the other, social and political development. ...|$|R

25|$|Data {{shows that}} the {{application}} of the death penalty is strongly influenced by racial bias. Furthermore, some opponents argue that it is applied in an arbitrary manner by a criminal justice system that has been shown to <b>be</b> <b>biased</b> through the systemic influence of socio-economic, geographic, and gender factors.

25|$|A {{double-blind}} study with only objective measures {{is less likely}} to <b>be</b> <b>biased</b> to support a given conclusion. However, the researchers or the sponsors still have opportunities to skew the results by discarding or ignoring undesirable data, qualitatively characterizing the results, and ultimately deciding whether to publish at all. Also, not all studies are possible to conduct double-blind.|$|E
25|$|Media {{coverage}} of the Arab–Israeli conflict by journalists in international news media has been said to <b>be</b> <b>biased</b> by both sides and independent observers. These perceptions of bias, possibly exacerbated by the hostile media effect, have generated more complaints of partisan reporting than any other news topic and {{have led to a}} proliferation of media watchdog groups.|$|E
25|$|For example, when {{estimating}} {{a location}} parameter, for a symmetric distribution a symmetric L-estimator (such as the median or midhinge) will be unbiased. However, if the distribution has skew, symmetric L-estimators will generally <b>be</b> <b>biased</b> and require adjustment. For example, in a skewed distribution, the nonparametric skew (and Pearson's skewness coefficients) measure the bias of the median as an estimator of the mean.|$|E
50|$|Research <b>is</b> <b>biased</b> and {{therefore}} not objective. Whilst the sociologist would be distant, {{it is argued that}} a hypothesis means the research <b>is</b> <b>biased</b> towards a pre-set conclusion (Rosenhan experiment in 1973). This is again rejected by Interactionists, who claim it is artificial, and also raises ethical issues to experiment on people.|$|R

40|$|We {{experimentally}} investigate information aggregation through majority voting {{when some}} voters <b>are</b> <b>biased.</b> In such situations, majority voting {{can have a}} dark side, that is, result in groups making choices inferior to those made by individuals acting alone. In line with theoretical predictions, information on the popularity of policy choices is beneficial when a minority of voters <b>are</b> <b>biased,</b> but harmful when a majority <b>is</b> <b>biased.</b> In theory, information {{on the success of}} policy choices elsewhere de-biases voters and alleviates the inefficiency. However, in the experiment, providing social information on success is ineffective and does not de-bias voters. (author's abstract...|$|R

While the peak of Laver was in the late 60s, the peak of Gonzales {{was in the middle}} 50s. Gonzales had a great {{longevity}} that made possible this rivalry. However, the overall record could <b>be</b> <b>biased</b> in favor of Laver because of the difference of 10 years between them.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the images}} on {{the two sides of}} actual coins are made of raised metal, the toss is likely to {{slightly}} favor one face or the other if the coin is allowed to roll on one edge upon landing. Coin spinning is much more likely to <b>be</b> <b>biased</b> than flipping, and conjurers trim the edges of coins so that when spun they usually land on a particular face.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the twin}} {{elements}} of natural justice is the rule against bias or nemo iudex in causa sua, which means {{that no one should}} be a judge {{in his or her own}} cause. The rule ensures that decision-makers will not <b>be</b> <b>biased</b> or prejudiced in a way that precludes a genuine and fair consideration of the arguments or evidence presented by the parties. Bias may be actual, imputed or apparent.|$|E
50|$|Pronin and Kugler's {{interpretation}} {{is that when}} people decide whether someone else <b>is</b> <b>biased,</b> they use overt behavior. On the other hand, when assessing {{whether or not they}} themselves <b>are</b> <b>biased,</b> people look inward, searching their own thoughts and feelings for biased motives. Since biases operate unconsciously, these introspections are not informative, but people wrongly treat them as reliable indication that they themselves, unlike other people, <b>are</b> immune to <b>bias.</b>|$|R

25|$|It is {{this second}} step {{which makes the}} {{technique}} one of non-probability sampling. In quota sampling {{the selection of the}} sample is non-random.
