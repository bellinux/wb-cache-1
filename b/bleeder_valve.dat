500|$|On July 13, 1944, the {{day that}} the E. A. Bryan docked at Port Chicago, the ship's [...] winch brakes were found stuck in the [...] "off" [...] position, meaning that the winch could be {{operated}} freely, but lacked the critical stopping capability if steam pressure was interrupted. The ship's chief mate and chief engineer were called to examine the winch but it was never determined whether the brake was made operational. During loading operations on July 15 the winch at [...] hold began making a hammering noise. A steady application of grease quieted it through the night until its main bearing could be replaced the next morning on July 16. On the afternoon of July 17, a <b>bleeder</b> <b>valve</b> on winch [...] required immediate repair. Albert Carr, a civil service plumber from Pittsburg, California, was called to replace it; it was his first day at Port Chicago. Carr pulled a broken nipple out of the <b>bleeder</b> <b>valve</b> and replaced both the nipple and the valve from new stock taken from Port Chicago's shop. While at work he witnessed a man accidentally drop a naval artillery shell two feet onto the wooden pier but there was no detonation. Carr waited until the African-American winch operator tested the newly repaired winch then hurriedly left the pier, thinking that the whole operation appeared unsafe.|$|E
2500|$|... "The Time Ball {{consists}} of a cast iron cylinder, piston, rack and pinion lifting mechanism, safety lock, electric motor and ball. The cylinder is 30cm diameter and 3 m long. Approximately 7 litres of soapy water fills {{the bottom of the}} cylinder to act as a buffer for the piston. The piston is a 10cm thick block of rubber with a <b>bleeder</b> <b>valve</b> to adjust the rate of descent. The rack extends from the piston to the Time Ball and is 7.5 meters long. A pinion engages into the rack by a slide gear, which enables the electric motor to raise the rack. A large hand wheel is also attached with a pawl gear to prevent back-slipping. The Time Ball is attached {{to the top of the}} rack and is raised 2.7 metres.|$|E
50|$|In {{the vacuum}} method, a {{specialized}} vacuum pump {{is attached to}} the <b>bleeder</b> <b>valve,</b> which is opened and fluid extracted with the pump until it runs clear of bubbles.|$|E
50|$|In the {{pressure}} method, a specialized pressure pump {{is attached to}} the master cylinder, pressurizing the system, and the <b>bleeder</b> <b>valves</b> are opened one at a time until the fluid is clear of air.|$|R
50|$|On a {{hydraulic}} vehicle braking systems, the bleed screws (sometimes known as bleed nipples or <b>bleeder</b> <b>valves)</b> are {{located at the}} top of each brake caliper to allow bleeding of the braking system. Whenever service work has been performed on the braking system which might have introduced air into the system (i.e. the hydraulic system has been opened), the air must be bled out. This is necessary for correct operation of the system, because air compresses (as opposed to brake fluid which is not compressible). Air in the system reduces the maximum pressure applied to the brake pistons and can lead to loss of braking ability.|$|R
40|$|A {{method and}} {{apparatus}} are presented for pressure testing the static pressure orifices and associated connections used in wind tunnels. A cylindrical module, having in one end an open hemispherical calibration pressure chamber separated from {{and surrounded by}} an annular vacuum chamber is placed over the orifice of the system to be tested. O-rings ensure seating and a vacuum seal between the chambered end of the module and the surface around the orifice: one O-ring separates the outer chamber from the outside environment. Ports lead {{from each of the}} chambers out {{the other end of the}} module to tubes connected to a control box consisting of calibration pressure and vacuum supply lines, <b>bleeder</b> <b>valves,</b> and gauges...|$|R
50|$|In {{the reverse}} method, a pump {{is used to}} force fluid through the <b>bleeder</b> <b>valve</b> to the master cylinder. This method uses the concept that air rises in liquid and {{naturally}} wants to escape {{up and out of}} the brake system.|$|E

The ship's chief mate and chief engineer were called to examine the winch but it was never determined whether the brake was made operational.

50|$|At {{the time}} when the race was about to resume after the rain delay, Sprint Cup Series {{officials}} noticed that the rear tires of Travis Kvapil's Ford were nearly flat. They made a pit stop {{while the rest of the}} field were under the pace laps. After the race, their car went under inspection which showed that the car was using <b>bleeder</b> <b>valves,</b> which were installed on the valve stems to regulate tire pressure. The infraction has one of the severest penalties in NASCAR. The infraction cost the Front Row Motorsports #38 team 150 owner points (Doug Yates is listed as the owner of the #38), Kvapil 150 driver points, USD $100,000, and the suspension of three crew members for twelve weeks. Front Row Motorsports appealed the decision, which knocked the team from 32nd to 36th, forcing the team to qualify on time. The penalties were upheld by NASCAR on June 22, 2010. In an unusual move, the penalty moved the #7 Robby Gordon Motorsports entry back into the Top 35, despite failing to qualify with Ted Musgrave. The penalty had a season-long effect on the #38 team, as they were never able to get back into the Top 35 and failed to qualify for three races.|$|R
40|$|A control {{technique}} based on Reinforcement Learning is {{proposed for the}} thermal sterilization of canned foods. The proposed controller has the objective of ensuring a given degree of sterilization during Heating (by providing a minimum temperature inside the cans during a given time) and then a smooth Cooling, avoiding sudden pressure variations. For this, three automatic control valves are manipulated by the controller: a valve that regulates the admission of steam during Heating, and a valve that regulate the admission of air, together with a <b>bleeder</b> <b>valve,</b> during Cooling. As dynamical models {{of this kind of}} processes are too complex and involve many uncertainties, controllers based on learning are proposed. Thus, based on the control objectives and the constraints on input and output variables, the proposed controllers learn the most adequate control actions by looking up a certain matrix that contains the state-action mapping, starting from a preselected state-action space. This state-action matrix is constantly updated based on the performance obtained with the applied control actions. Experimental results at laboratory scale show the advantages of the proposed technique for this kind of processes.
