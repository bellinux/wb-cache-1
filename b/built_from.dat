40|$|The {{fabrication}} of layers of copper sulphide within multilayers of copper complexes of the amphiphile 4 -(10, 12 -pentacosadiynamido methyl pyridine, by diffusion of H 2 S into the multilayers, was studied by UV–VIS spectroscopy. XPS measurements revealed that copper sulphides can be synthesised which differ in stoichiometry when multilayers are used, which were <b>built</b> up <b>from</b> different subphases (CuCl 2 or Cu(ClO 4) 2). The distinct layer {{pattern of the}} Langmuir–Blodgett (LB) films is preserved during {{the formation of the}} copper sulphide layers and the bilayer distance increases slightly by about 1. 8 Å for the multilayers <b>built</b> up <b>from</b> a 5 mM CuCl 2 subphase, whereas for the multilayers <b>built</b> up <b>from</b> a 5 mM Cu(ClO 4) 2 subphase the bilayer distance decreases a little by about 0. 6 Å after the formation of copper sulphide inside these LB films. After polymerisation the multilayer structure is destroyed in the case of LB films <b>built</b> up <b>from</b> the CuCl 2 subphase, whereas the layer structure is preserved during the polymerisation process in the case of multilayers <b>built</b> up <b>from</b> a 5 mM Cu(ClO 4) 2 subphase. ...|$|R
