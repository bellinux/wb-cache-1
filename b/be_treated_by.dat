5|$|As calcium {{is heavily}} {{involved}} in bone manufacture, many bone diseases {{can be traced to}} problems with the organic matrix or the hydroxyapatite in molecular structure or organisation. For example, osteoporosis is a reduction in mineral content of bone per unit volume, and can <b>be</b> <b>treated</b> <b>by</b> supplementation of calcium, vitamin D, and biphosphates. Calcium supplements may benefit the serum lipids in women who have passed menopause as well as older men; in post-menopausal women calcium supplementation also appears to be inversely correlated with cardiovascular disease. Inadequate amounts of calcium, vitamin D, or phosphates can lead to the softening of bones, known as osteomalacia.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to determine the effect of the learning models TSTS with Concept Mapping (TSTS CM) on mathematics learning achievement viewed from students Mathematical Reasoning Ability (MRA). This research was quasi experimental research with 3 x 3 factorial design. The population were the eighth-grade students of junior high schools in Kebumen Regency in the academic year of 2015 / 2016. Instruments used for data collection were mathematics achievement test and MRA test. The data analysis technique used was the two-way ANAVA with unbalanced cell. Based on the hypothesis test, it was concluded as follows. 1) The mathematics learning achievement of the students who <b>were</b> <b>treated</b> <b>by</b> TSTS CM <b>was</b> better than the students who <b>were</b> <b>treated</b> <b>by</b> TSTS and Direct Learning (DL), the mathematics learning achievement of the students who <b>were</b> <b>treated</b> <b>by</b> TSTS <b>was</b> better than the students who <b>were</b> <b>treated</b> <b>by</b> DL; 2) The mathematics learning achievement of the students with high MRA was better than the students with moderate or low MRA, and the mathematics learning achievement of the students with moderate MRA was better than the students with low MRA; 3) In TSTS CM, the mathematics learning achievement of the students who had high MRA was better than the students who had moderate or low MRA, while the mathematics learning achievement of the students who had moderate MRA was same as the students who had low MRA; in TSTS, the mathematics learning achievement of the students who had high MRA was same as the students who had moderate MRA and was better than the students who had low MRA, while the mathematics learning achievement of the student who had moderate MRA was better than the students who had low MRA; in DL, the mathematics learning achievement of the students who had high MRA was better than the students who had moderate or low MRA, while the mathematics learning achievement of the students who had moderate MRA was same as the students who had low MRA; 4) The high MRA students who <b>were</b> <b>treated</b> <b>by</b> TSTS CM, TSTS, and DL had same mathematics learning achievement; the moderate MRA students who <b>were</b> <b>treated</b> <b>by</b> TSTS CM had same mathematics learning achievement as the students <b>were</b> <b>treated</b> <b>by</b> TSTS but had better than the students <b>were</b> <b>treated</b> <b>by</b> DL, while the students <b>were</b> <b>treated</b> <b>by</b> TSTS had better mathematics learning achievement than the students <b>were</b> <b>treated</b> <b>by</b> DL; The low MRA students who <b>were</b> <b>treated</b> <b>by</b> TSTS CM had better mathematics learning achievement than the students <b>were</b> <b>treated</b> <b>by</b> TSTS or DL, while the students <b>were</b> <b>treated</b> <b>by</b> TSTS had same mathematics learning achievement as the students <b>were</b> <b>treated</b> <b>by</b> DL.

5|$|Pyridoxine, {{also known}} as vitamin B6, {{can be used to}} {{counteract}} the inhibition by MMH on the pyridoxine-dependent step in the synthesis of the neurotransmitter GABA. Thus GABA synthesis can continue and symptoms are relieved. Pyridoxine, which is only useful for the neurological symptoms and does not decrease hepatic toxicity, is given at a dose of 25mg/kg; this can be repeated up to a maximum total of 15 to 30g daily if symptoms do not improve. Benzodiazepines are given to control seizures; as they also modulate GABA receptors they may potentially increase the effect of pyridoxine. Additionally MMH inhibits the chemical transformation of folic acid into its active form, folinic acid, this can <b>be</b> <b>treated</b> <b>by</b> folinic acid given at 20–200mg daily.|$|E
5|$|The {{ketogenic}} diet {{is not a}} benign, holistic {{or natural}} treatment for epilepsy; as with any serious medical therapy, there may be complications. These are generally less severe and less frequent than with anticonvulsant medication or surgery. Common but easily treatable short-term side effects include constipation, low-grade acidosis and hypoglycaemia {{if there is an}} initial fast. Raised levels of lipids in the blood affect up to 60% of children and cholesterol levels may increase by around 30%. This can <b>be</b> <b>treated</b> <b>by</b> changes to the fat content of the diet, such as from saturated fats towards polyunsaturated fats, and, if persistent, by lowering the ketogenic ratio. Supplements are necessary to counter the dietary deficiency of many micronutrients.|$|E

5|$|The {{electric}} {{shock of the}} common torpedo can be severe, but is not life-threatening. In classical antiquity, the electrogenic properties of this species led it (and other strongly electric fishes) {{to be used in}} medicine for the treatment of pain and diseases such as gout. For example, the Roman physician Scribonius Largus, in his Compositiones medicae (c. 50 AD), recommended that chronic headaches <b>be</b> <b>treated</b> <b>by</b> the application of a live torpedo to the affected area. The common torpedo is edible, but is little-valued by commercial or artisanal fisheries and is mostly discarded when caught. Because of its shallow-water habits, it may survive being captured and discarded relatively well. It is susceptible to several types of demersal fishing gear, including bottom trawls and trammel nets; fishing activity is heavy within its range but no specific data regarding this species are available. As a result, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed it under Data Deficient. The common torpedo has been kept in aquariums, but requires live fish for food.|$|E
5|$|There is no antidote, and {{supportive}} care is {{the mainstay of}} further treatment for intoxication. Though {{sometimes referred to as}} a deliriant and while muscarine was first isolated from A. muscaria and as such is its namesake, muscimol does not have action, either as an agonist or antagonist, at the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor site, and therefore atropine or physostigmine as an antidote is not recommended. If a patient is delirious or agitated, this can usually <b>be</b> <b>treated</b> <b>by</b> reassurance and, if necessary, physical restraints. A benzodiazepine such as diazepam or lorazepam can be used to control combativeness, agitation, muscular overactivity, and seizures. Only small doses should be used, as they may worsen the respiratory depressant effects of muscimol. Recurrent vomiting is rare, but if present may lead to fluid and electrolyte imbalances; intravenous rehydration or electrolyte replacement may be required. Serious cases may develop loss of consciousness or coma, and may need intubation and artificial ventilation. Hemodialysis can remove the toxins, although this intervention is generally considered unnecessary. With modern medical treatment the prognosis is typically good following supportive treatment.|$|E
