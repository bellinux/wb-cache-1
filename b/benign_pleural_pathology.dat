40|$|BACKGROUND: Until recently, {{asbestos}} {{was widely}} used {{in a variety of}} industrial processes. Workers exposed to asbestos may develop lung and pleural diseases such as asbestosis, lung cancer, <b>benign</b> <b>pleural</b> effusion, pleural plaques and mesothelioma. OBJECTIVE: To describe a clinical case of lung cancer in a female non-smoker with occupational exposure to asbestos. METHODS: The clinical and occupational history was based on the information kindly provided by the Occupational Unit of the National Health Service and on the case history of a hospital admittance in 2001, when the patient underwent surgery for lung cancer. RESULTS: The patient worked for 6 years in an asbestos manufacturing industry where she was exposed to high concentrations of asbestos, and then worked for 14 years in a sugar refinery only during the summer. She had <b>benign</b> <b>pleural</b> effusion, pleural plaques, asbestosis and lung cancer.

In this pilot study, we investigate the role of 18 F-FDG positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) for differentiating asbestos-related <b>benign</b> <b>pleural</b> disease from malignant mesothelioma. Materials and MethodsThe study population comprised 31 consecutive patients (17 malignant mesotheliomas, nine benign asbestos pleurisies, and five diffuse pleural fibrosis) {{with a mean age}} of 61 years between January 2006 and December 2008. Thoracoscopy or image-guided pleural needle biopsy were systematically performed to reveal pathologic diagnosis and/or clinical follow-up for at least 3 years for presence or absence of malignant pleural effusion. ROCs analyses for standardized uptake value (SUV) adjusted to body weight were calculated between <b>benign</b> and malignant <b>pleural</b> diseases. Results 18 F-FDG PET/CT imaging correctly detected the presence of malignancies in 15 of 17 patients with malignant mesothelioma for sensitivity, specificity, and overall accuracy of 88. 2 %, 92. 9 %, and 90. 3 %, respectively. 18 F-FDG PET/CT imaging correctly identified 13 of 14 cases of <b>benign</b> <b>pleural</b> disease. The mean SUV values were 6. 5 ± 3. 4 for malignant mesothelioma cases and 0. 8 ± 0. 6 for <b>benign</b> <b>pleural</b> diseases (p < 0. 001). When we compared the two groups of pleural disease, a cut-off value of 2. 2 for SUV gave the best accuracy with 94. 1 %, 100 %, 100 %, and 93. 3 % for sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value, respectively.

40|$|Purpose: In {{malignant}} {{pleural mesothelioma}} (MPM), early assessment of disease status is important. We evaluated {{the role of}} mesothelin and osteopontin biomarkers in distinguishing MPM from <b>benign</b> <b>pleural</b> disease. We also, evaluated whether mesothelin and osteopontin were related to successful pleurodesis or not. Materials and methods: Mesothelin and osteopontin were assayed in blood and pleural fluid with commercial ELISA kits {{in a series of}} 20 patients with malignant mesothelioma and 20 patients with <b>benign</b> <b>pleural</b> effusion (10 patients with tuberculous pleural effusion and 10 patients with <b>benign</b> asbestos <b>pleural</b> effusion). Results were correlated with histological subtypes and pleurodesis outcome. Results: Both mesothelin and osteopontin in blood and pleural fluid showed statistically high levels in malignant <b>pleural</b> mesothelioma than <b>benign</b> <b>pleural</b> effusion with a cutoff point of 3. 5  nmol/L for pleural mesothelin and 3. 3  nmol/L for serum mesothelin and of 280  ng/ml for pleural osteopontin and 260  ng/ml for serum osteopontin. Also, there are statistically significant high levels of mesothelin in epitheliod subtype than sarcomatoid and mixed mesothelioma.

40|$|Introduction. We {{investigated}} {{the expression of}} microRNAs and mRNAs in pleural tissues from patients with either malignant <b>pleural</b> mesothelioma or <b>benign</b> asbestos-related <b>pleural</b> effusion. Methods. Fresh frozen tissues from a total of 18 malignant pleural mesothelioma and 6 <b>benign</b> asbestos-related <b>pleural</b> effusion patients were studied. Expression profiling of mRNA and microRNA was performed using standard protocols. Results. We discovered significant upregulation of multiple microRNAs in malignant pleural mesothelioma compared to <b>benign</b> asbestos-related <b>pleural</b> effusion. Hsa-miR- 484, hsa-miR- 320, hsa-let- 7 a, and hsa-miR- 125 a- 5 p were able to discriminate malignant from benign disease. Dynamically regulated mRNAs were also identified.

40|$|Early {{discrimination}} between <b>benign</b> and malignant <b>pleural</b> diseases {{is vital}} for the treatment and prognosis of a patient. Imaging is traditionally performed with CT or MRI, with an accuracy of 50 %- 75 %. PET {{has proven to be}} superior as a diagnostic tool in several malignancies. In this prospective study, PET results in patients with pleural abnormalities on CT were compared with histologic results. Methods: Eligible patients had pleural thickening on CT and were medically fit for surgical diagnostic procedures. All patients underwent PET. Qualitative assessment led to a PET score of 1 (definitely normal), 2 (probably normal), 3 (probably abnormal), or 4 (definitely abnormal). PET scores of 1 or 2 indicated a negative finding, whereas PET scores of 3 or 4 indicated a positive PET finding. Pathologic verification techniques included thoracocentesis, thoracoscopy, or open pleural biopsy at thoracotomy. Results: Thirty-two patients were enrolled, 19 with malignant and 13 with <b>benign</b> <b>pleural</b> disease. PET was true positive in 18 and true negative in 12 patients, with an accuracy and negative predictive value of 94 % and 92 %, respectively. PET was false negative in a patient with a slowly growing malignant solitary fibrous tumor and false positive in a patient with infectious pleuritis.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The aim of {{this study}} was to analyze the {{potential}} usefulness of MR signal intensity in differentiating malignant from <b>benign</b> <b>pleural</b> disease. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Forty-five patients with pleural lesions identified on CT scans were subsequently examined by MR imaging at 0. 5 T. T 1 -weighted, proton density-weighted, T 2 -weighted, and enhanced T 1 -weighted spin-echo images were obtained. For 34 patients, a diagnosis of malignant (n = 18) or benign (n = 16) disease was established. The morphologic features of the pleural lesions and MR signal intensity on T 1 -weighted, proton density-weighted, T 2 -weighted, and enhanced T 1 -weighted images were evaluated, and the ratio of lesion to muscle signal intensity was computed. RESULTS: Assessment of morphologic features by MR imaging and CT was not significantly different. High signal intensity on proton density-weighted and T 2 -weighted images was observed in all malignant lesions and in two benign lesions (sensitivity, 100 %; specificity, 87 %; negative predictive value, 100 %). The ratio of lesion to muscle signal intensity on T 1 -weighted, proton density-weighted, T 2 -weighted, and enhanced T 1 -weighted images discriminated between malignant and benign lesions (p <. 0001). For the subgroup of lesions misinterpreted by CT (n = 6), the evaluation of MR signal intensity on long-TR images made it possible to differentiate malignant from benign conditions. CONCLUSION: MR signal intensity is a valuable additional feature for differentiating malignant from <b>benign</b> <b>pleural</b> disease.

Microsatellite analyses of pleural fluid supernatants showed genetic alterations in tumor patients only. However, 50 % of pleural effusions that were considered negative for malignancy by routine cytological analysis showed either loss of heterozygosity or microsatellite instability. The sensitivity of pleural fluid examination rose to 79 % when routine cytological assessment was supplemented by molecular studies. Our data suggest that microsatellite analysis increases the sensitivity of cytological pleural fluid examination in assessing potential malignancy and that combining cytological and molecular methods may improve yield and certainty in diagnostically challenging cases...|$|R

40|$|The {{diagnosis}} of malignant pleural mesothelioma is difficult, {{with the most}} common differential diagnoses being <b>benign</b> <b>pleural</b> diseases and metastatic adenocarcinomas (ADCA). To identify novel markers that {{would be able to}} improve diagnostic accuracy, we performed a genome-wide gene expression analysis on tumor cell lines established from pleural effusions (malignant pleural mesothelioma and lung ADCA). This analysis led to the identification of genes encoding novel and pertinent cellular and soluble markers, for which the expression was validated by real-time RT-PCR. Immunohistochemical staining of tumor biopsy specimens with anti–type III collagen antibodies showed positive labeling for mesothelioma cells but not for ADCA cells. Using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, we showed that the C-C motif chemokine 2 (CCL 2) concentration was significantly higher in pleural effusions from patients with mesothelioma (n = 61) than in subjects with ADCA (n = 25) or with <b>benign</b> <b>pleural</b> effusions (n = 15) : median (interquartile range) = 2. 99 ng/ml (1. 76 to 6. 01) vs 0. 99 ng/ml (0. 51 to 1. 83) and 1. 47 ng/ml (0. 80 to 1. 56), respectively, P < 0. 0001. Conversely, the galectin- 3 concentration was lower in mesothelioma: 11. 50 ng/ml (6. 73 to 23. 53) vs 24. 74 ng/ml (20. 42 to 70. 35) and 17. 64 ng/ml (14. 81 to 24. 68), respectively, P < 0. 0001.

5000|$|Rounded atelectasis (also {{known as}} Blesovsky’s or folded lung syndrome) {{develops}} from infolding of thickened visceral pleura with {{collapse of the}} intervening lung parenchyma. It presents radiographically as a mass and may {{be mistaken for a}} tumour. On a CT scan of the chest it appears as a rounded mass like opacity in the peripheral lung adjacent to thickened pleura and with curvilinear opacities which are the bronchi and vessels (comet tail). [...] Rounded atelectasis is the least common asbestos-related <b>benign</b> <b>pleural</b> disease. Exposure to asbestos is the most likely cause today but it can occur following other medical conditions. It is a chronic condition and usually asymptomatic.|$|R
40|$|RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: To {{systematically}} {{review and}} meta-analyze published {{data about the}} diagnostic accuracy of fluorine- 18 -fluorodeoxyglucose ((18) F-FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) and PET/computed tomography (CT) in the differential diagnosis between malignant and <b>benign</b> <b>pleural</b> lesions. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A comprehensive literature search of studies published through June 2013 regarding the diagnostic performance of (18) F-FDG-PET and PET/CT in the differential diagnosis of pleural lesions was carried out. All retrieved studies were reviewed and qualitatively analyzed. Pooled sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative likelihood ratio (LR+ and LR-) and diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) of (18) F-FDG-PET or PET/CT in the differential diagnosis of pleural lesions on a per-patient-based analysis were calculated. The area under the summary receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was calculated to measure the accuracy of these methods. Subanalyses considering device used (PET or PET/CT) were performed. RESULTS: Sixteen studies including 745 patients {{were included in the}} systematic review. The meta-analysis of 11 selected studies provided the following results: sensitivity 95 % (95 % confidence interval [95 %CI]: 92 - 97 %), specificity 82 % (95 %CI: 76 - 88 %), LR+ 5. 3 (95 %CI: 2. 4 - 11. 8), LR- 0. 09 (95 %CI: 0. 05 - 0. 14), DOR 74 (95 %CI: 34 - 161). The AUC was 0. 95. No significant improvement of the diagnostic accuracy considering PET/CT studies only was found. CONCLUSIONS: (18) F-FDG-PET and PET/CT demonstrated to be accurate diagnostic imaging methods in the differential diagnosis between malignant and <b>benign</b> <b>pleural</b> lesions; nevertheless, possible sources of false-negative and false-positive results should be kept in mind...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Malignant pleural {{effusion}} (MPE) {{is a common}} clinical problem with described investigation pathways. While thoracic ultrasound (TUS) {{has been shown to}} be accurate in pleural fluid detection, its use in the diagnosis of malignant pleural disease has not been assessed. A study was undertaken to assess the diagnostic accuracy of TUS in differentiating malignant and <b>benign</b> <b>pleural</b> disease. METHODS: 52 consecutive patients with suspected MPE underwent TUS and contrast-enhanced CT (CECT). TUS was used to assess pleural surfaces using previously published CT imaging criteria for malignancy, diaphragmatic thickness/nodularity, effusion size/nature and presence of hepatic metastasis (in right-sided effusions). A TUS diagnosis of malignant or benign disease was made blind to clinical data/other investigations by a second blinded operator using anonymised TUS video clips. The TUS diagnosis was compared with the definitive clinical diagnosis and in addition to the diagnosis found at CECT. RESULTS: A definitive malignant diagnosis was based on histocytology (30 / 33; 91 %) and clinical/CT follow-up (3 / 33; 9 %). Benign diagnoses were based on negative histocytology and follow-up over 12 months in 19 / 19 patients. TUS correctly diagnosed malignancy in 26 / 33 patients (sensitivity 73 %, specificity 100 %, positive predictive value 100 %, negative predictive value 79 %) and benign disease in 19 / 19. Pleural thickening > 1 cm, pleural nodularity and diaphragmatic thickening > 7 mm were highly suggestive of malignant disease. CONCLUSION: TUS is useful in differentiating malignant from <b>benign</b> <b>pleural</b> disease in patients presenting with suspected MPE and may become an important adjunct in the diagnostic pathway...|$|R
40|$|Background: Malignant pleural {{mesothelioma}} (MPM) results from malignant transformation of mesothelial cells. Past asbestos exposure represents a {{major risk factor}} for MPM and other <b>benign</b> <b>pleural</b> disease. Soluble mesothelin-related peptides (SMRP) have been regarded as a promising serum biomarker for MPM. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate serum levels of SMRP in malignant and nonmalignant asbestos-related pleural disease. Patients: Four groups of patients were investigated: group 1 composed of 48 healthy subjects, group 2 composed of 177 patients with previous asbestos exposure and no pleural disease, group 3 composed of 36 patients with MPM, and group 4 composed of 101 patients with previous asbestos exposure and <b>benign</b> <b>pleural</b> disease. Serum SMRP levels were determined by ELISA. Results: Serum SMRP levels were significantly higher among group 3 than the other three groups. There were no differences in SMRP concentrations between groups 2 and 4. Subjects exposed to asbestos had higher SMRP concentrations than normal control subjects regardless of the presence of pleural disease. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for SMRP values was 0. 75 (95 % confidence interval, 0. 68 - 0. 83). The SMRP level at 0. 55 nmol/L/L was determined as the most optimal cutoff value with resulting sensitivity and specificity of 72 % and 72 % for the diagnosis of MPM. Conclusions: These data attest to good diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of SMRP for the diagnosis of malignant mesothelioma. We have also shown that serum SMRP levels might serve as a marker of asbesto...|$|R
