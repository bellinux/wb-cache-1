25|$|The Union {{military}} command in the West, however, {{suffered from a}} lack of unified command, organized by November into three separate departments: the Department of Kansas, under Maj. Gen. David Hunter, the Department of the Missouri, under Maj. Gen. Henry Halleck, and the Department of the Ohio, under Brig. Gen. Don Carlos Buell (who had replaced Brig. Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman). By January 1862, this disunity of command was apparent because no strategy for operations in the Western theater could be agreed upon. Buell, under political pressure to invade and hold pro-Union East Tennessee, moved slowly in the direction of Nashville, but achieved nothing more substantial toward his goal than minor victories at Middle Creek (January 10, 1862) under Col. James A. Garfield and Mill Springs (January 19) under Brig. Gen. George Henry Thomas. (Mill Springs was a significant victory in a strategic sense because it broke the end of the Confederate Western defensive line and opened the Cumberland Gap to East Tennessee, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>got</b> Buell no closer to Nashville.) In Halleck's department, Grant demonstrated up the Tennessee River by attacking the Confederate camp at Belmont to divert attention from Buell's intended advance, which did not occur. On February 1, 1862, after repeated requests by Grant, Halleck authorized Grant to move against Fort Henry on the Tennessee.|$|E
25|$|At that time, {{there was}} extreme {{illiteracy}} and ignorance in the Sikh community. Lyallpuri realised {{the urgent need}} to awaken and educate the community. He therefore started a weekly newspaper Sacha Dhandora and started publishing patriotic songs and Sikh-ideology related nationalistic articles. In those days, Tika Sahib (Wali Ahid) Ripudaman Singh of erstwhile Nabha State was making outstanding contributions towards Sikhism and his views on Sikhism were routinely published in Sacha Dhandora. This had brought Master Lyallpuri and Tika Sahib together. Tika Sahib was {{also a member of}} the Imperial Council from 1906 to 1908. Together they worked on the draft for Anand Marriage Act which was later submitted to the Special Committee for review. Since Tika Sahib ceased to be member of the Council after 1908, and in the meanwhile, Sardar Sunder Singh Majithia had become a member of the Imperial Council in his place, therefore, Majithia continued to pursue the matter and the Bill got finally enacted on 22 October 1909. The Sikh marriage called Anand Karaj was introduced from the time of the Sikh Gurus <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>got</b> statutory recognition only after the passage of the Anand Marriage Act 1909. According to the centrally approved Sikh Code (Sikh Reht Maryada), persons not professing the Sikh faith cannot be joined in wedlock by the Anand Karaj ceremony.|$|E
25|$|This series {{marked the}} return of Billy Murdoch as Australia’s leader, and pitched him against The Champion, WG Grace. The Australian side was good, {{but they were still}} without some of their best players. 1890 was a wet summer, and the rain {{affected}} all of the three planned Tests. The first Test was the most eagerly anticipated match of the English summer, with 30,279 spectators watching it over the 3 days, though Stoddart and Briggs did not play. Rain on the 2 days before the match left the pitch slow, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>got</b> steadily better and better, and was at its best on the last day, when England scored 137 to win by 7 wickets, with Grace, who was out for a duck in the first innings, scoring 75 not out. The second Test at the Oval was particularly tense, partly, no doubt, because Andrew Stoddart (an amateur) chose to play for Middlesex, whilst Peel and Ulyett (professionals) were claimed by Yorkshire. Rain before the first day’s play contributed to 22 wickets falling for 197 runs on day 1. On day 2, England only needed 95 to win, they lost eight wickets to Charles Turner and Ferris before getting them, with the winning run being scampered as Australia missed a clear run out chance. A planned third Test match at Old Trafford, Manchester was washed out, thereby becoming the first Test to be abandoned entirely because of the weather.|$|E

A number of Premier League and Championship clubs showed interest in signing Jarvis, and Plymouth Argyle made an unsuccessful bid for the player, manager Ian Holloway commenting that [...] "we did make a bid <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>got</b> knocked back".

500|$|Starbucks founder Howard Schultz {{reached out}} to Turlington to support her {{foundation}} Every Mother Counts, which seeks to make pregnancy and childbirth safe for mothers. David Legry, who served as Starbucks' editorial manager, helped shape the compilation after reading about Turlington's humanitarian work, and later worked with artists to select suitable songs. Turlington then recruited several artists, including: Carla Bruni, Sheryl Crow, Jennifer Lopez, Madonna, her friend Gwyneth Paltrow, and Martha Wainwright, {{to contribute to the}} project. She contacted all participating artists, and recalled: We already had our soundtrack, and I already had Martha Wainwright singing [...] "No Woman, No Cry," [...] which was great, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>got</b> us all thinking that a compilation CD would be a great way to target women who are artists and also mothers and see what they're willing to contribute.

500|$|Behind Yuhuatai the 88th Division had {{stationed}} its barely trained {{new recruits}} atop Nanking's Zhonghua Gate. The Japanese had already tried {{the previous night}} to infiltrate a [...] "suicide squadron" [...] bearing explosive picric acid up to this gate to blow a hole in it, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>got</b> lost in the morning fog and failed to reach the wall. At noon on December 12 a team of just six Japanese soldiers made it across the moat in a small boat and succeeded in scaling the wall at Zhonghua Gate on a shaky bamboo ladder and raising the Japanese flag there. Five of them were killed by gunfire but the last man grabbed a Chinese machine gun and held the position singlehandedly. Soon after another Japanese team set a fire {{in front of the}} gate to create a smokescreen. By 5:00 pm more and more Japanese troops were crossing the moat and swarming Zhonghua Gate by fording makeshift bridges so rickety their engineers had to hold them aloft with their own bodies, {{and with the help of}} some well aimed Japanese artillery fire from atop Yuhuatai parts of the wall finally crumbled. Meanwhile, just west of Zhonghua Gate, other soldiers also of Japan's 10th Army had punched a hole through Chinese lines in the wetlands south of Shuixi Gate and were launching a violent drive on that gate with the support of a fleet of tanks.|$|E
