5|$|Bodyline was {{a tactic}} devised for and {{primarily}} {{used in the}} Ashes series between England and Australia in 1932—33. The tactic involved bowling at leg stump or just outside it, pitching the ball short so that it reared at {{the body of a}} batsman stood in an orthodox batting position. A ring of fielders ranged on the leg side would catch any defensive deflections from the bat. The batsman's options were to evade the ball through ducking or moving aside, allow the ball to strike their body or play the ball with his bat. The latter course carried additional risks. Defensive shots brought few runs and could carry far enough to <b>be</b> <b>caught</b> by the fielders on the leg side; pull and hook shots could <b>be</b> <b>caught</b> {{on the edge of the}} field where two men were usually placed for such a shot.|$|E
5|$|Bus {{services}} run to Inverness and Glasgow, {{and there}} are local services on the island, mainly starting from Portree or Broadford. Train services run from Kyle of Lochalsh at the mainland end of the Skye Bridge to Inverness, {{as well as from}} Glasgow to Mallaig from where the ferry can <b>be</b> <b>caught</b> to Armadale.|$|E
5|$|Large {{fish are}} caught with the bill-tip, then tossed {{up in the}} air to <b>be</b> <b>caught</b> and slid into the gullet head-first. A gull will {{sometimes}} stand on the pelican's head, peck it to distraction, and grab a fish from the open bill. Pelicans in their turn sometimes snatch prey from other waterbirds.|$|E

5|$|Pokémon Red and Blue {{take place}} in the region of Kanto. This is one {{distinct}} region shown in later games, with different geographical habitats for the 151 existing Pokémon species, along with human-populated towns and cities, and Routes connecting locations with one another. Some areas are only accessible once the player learns a special ability or gains a special item. Areas in which the player can catch Pokémon range from caves to the sea, where the kinds of Pokémon available to catch varies. For example, Tentacool can only <b>be</b> <b>caught</b> either through fishing or when the player is in a body of water, while Zubat can only <b>be</b> <b>caught</b> in a cave.|$|E
5|$|Red foxes feature {{prominently}} in the folklore and mythology of human cultures {{with which they are}} sympatric. In Greek mythology, the Teumessian fox or Cadmean vixen, was a gigantic fox that was destined never to <b>be</b> <b>caught.</b> The fox was one of the children of Echidna.|$|E

5|$|A bodyline {{delivery}} was {{one where}} the cricket ball was bowled at {{the body of the}} batsman, in the hope that when he defended himself with his bat, a resulting deflection could <b>be</b> <b>caught</b> by one of several fielders standing close by. This was considered by critics to be intimidatory and physically threatening, {{to the point of being}} unfair in a game that was supposed to uphold gentlemanly traditions.|$|E
5|$|Aberdaron hosts {{numerous}} sailing regattas featuring clinker built boats {{unique to}} the area; there is a popular regatta every August where the races are open to everyone. Sea angling trips are operated from Porth Meudwy, fishing for pollock, coley and mackerel; wrasse, bass, mullet and gurnard are also possible. Bass and coley can <b>be</b> <b>caught</b> from the rocks at Porth Iago; and wrasse, pollock and mackerel are plentiful. Access is difficult at Uwchmynydd, but pollock, mackerel, wrasse and conger are caught; huss are plentiful; and ling are found occasionally.|$|E

5|$|Another {{indication}} that feet and other tetrapod traits evolved while {{the animals were}} still aquatic is how they were feeding. They {{did not have the}} modifications of the skull and jaw that allowed them to swallow prey on land. Prey could <b>be</b> <b>caught</b> in the shallows, at the water's edge or on land, but had to be eaten in water where hydrodynamic forces from the expansion of their buccal cavity would force the food into their esophagus.|$|E
5|$|Every year, {{visitors}} in the Muskrat Lake area search for Mussie in the lake; none have yet captured evidence of its existence. In the 1990s, a tourism marketing {{campaign for the}} area offered CAN$1 million to anyone who could capture a live specimen, but no one did. Mussie is referenced in travel pamphlets for the Whitewater Region area; one suggests that it can <b>be</b> <b>caught</b> by a fishing rod.|$|E
5|$|Max Eckhardt's Shiny Brite company {{manufactured}} colorful glass ornaments in {{a variety}} of sizes and shapes through the era.

5000|$|An {{estimated}} 1 in 2 million lobsters are blue. A {{genetic mutation}} causes a blue lobster {{to produce an}} excessive amount of a particular protein. The protein and a red carotenoid molecule known as astaxanthin combine to form a blue complex known as crustacyanin, giving the lobster its blue color. In 2009 a blue lobster <b>was</b> <b>caught</b> in New Hampshire; in 2011, two blue lobsters <b>were</b> <b>caught</b> in Canada, one off of Prince Edward Island, and another in the Esgenoôpetitj First Nation territory in New Brunswick; another <b>was</b> <b>caught</b> in May 2012 off Nova Scotia. A blue lobster <b>was</b> <b>caught</b> off Pine Point in Scarborough, Maine in August 2014, and was donated to a local aquarium to join three other blue lobsters. In August, 2016, one <b>was</b> <b>caught</b> in Massachusetts {{off the coast of}} Cape Cod. In July 2017, a blue lobster <b>was</b> <b>caught</b> near the New Hampshire-Maine border and was donated to the Seacoast Science Center in Rye, New Hampshire.|$|R

5|$|Morris found batting {{difficult}} {{for the first few}} weeks of the tour, as he struggled to adapt to the unfamiliar batting conditions. He reached 50 only twice in the nine innings after the Worcestershire match, totalling only 223 runs at 24.77; Morris sometimes attempted to drive balls pitched just short of a good length, and if they reared suddenly, he was liable to <b>be</b> <b>caught.</b> Morris was worried about edging the ball to the slips cordon and had become fidgety and shuffled across the crease.|$|E
5|$|On 30 June 1907 Tiku {{and two of}} his {{men were}} caught by the Dutch forces; he was the last guerrilla leader to <b>be</b> <b>caught.</b> After several days in prison, on 10 July 1907 Tiku was shot and killed by the Dutch {{soldiers}} near the Sa'dan River; some reports have him bathing at the time. He was buried {{with the rest of his}} family in Tondol, while his cousin Tandibua' became the native rule of Pangala', serving under the Dutch.|$|E
5|$|Other risks {{associated}} with the crinoline were that it could get caught in other people's feet, carriage wheels or furniture, or <b>be</b> <b>caught</b> by sudden gusts of wind, blowing the wearer off their feet. In 1859, while participating in a paper chase, Louisa, Duchess of Manchester, caught her hoop while climbing over a stile, and was left with the entirety of her crinoline and skirts thrown over her head, revealing her scarlet drawers to the assembled company.|$|E

5|$|Smith's third {{victim was}} Carol Jordan, a 39-year-old care home worker {{and mother of}} six from Balsall Heath, who was killed as she walked to work. Smith hit her from behind with his car while driving back from Worcestershire, {{fracturing}} her hip. Fearing that he would <b>be</b> <b>caught,</b> Smith moved her to another location and beat her so much that dental records were required to identify her corpse. The body was discovered at 8:50am on 12 November on parkland next to Bell Barn Road, Lee Bank.|$|E
5|$|The Earth's {{magnetic}} field serves to deflect {{most of the}} solar wind, whose charged particles would otherwise strip away the ozone layer that protects the Earth from harmful ultraviolet radiation. One stripping mechanism is for gas to <b>be</b> <b>caught</b> in bubbles of {{magnetic field}}, which are ripped off by solar winds. Calculations {{of the loss of}} carbon dioxide from the atmosphere of Mars, resulting from scavenging of ions by the solar wind, indicate that the dissipation of the magnetic field of Mars caused a near total loss of its atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|The concept, which {{originated}} in castles such as Krak des Chevaliers, was {{to remove the}} reliance on a central strongpoint and to emphasise the defence of the curtain walls. There would be multiple rings of defensive walls, one inside the other, with the inner ring rising above the outer so that its field of fire was not completely obscured. If assailants made it past {{the first line of}} defence they would <b>be</b> <b>caught</b> in the killing ground between the inner and outer walls and have to assault the second wall.|$|E
