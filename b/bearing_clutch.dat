40|$|The {{goals of}} this thesis {{were to make}} final design {{modifications}} and perform static testing to prepare the Hummingbird, a 150 pound, remotely piloted helicopter (RPH), for untethered flight. The major elements involved were: (1) The adaptation of a suitable, permanently-dedicated test stand for use with large-scale RPH/RPV (remotely piloted vehicle) aircraft; (2) A major rotor drivetrain improvement to the helicopter to enable it to autorotate and safely land {{in the event of}} an in-flight engine failure, thus avoiding potential loss of the helicopter due to crash; (3) Complete break-in and testing of a replacement engine for a mechanically-seized first engine; and (4) Limited hover testing while secured to the tether test stand. Test stand modifications include design and implementation of a compression spring to offset the weight of the new mounting assembly and a restricting collar to confine mobility of the stand's universal joint. The mechanical change to the drivetrain consists of replacement of a conventional belt-drive sprocket with a one-way sprague <b>clutch</b> <b>bearing</b> inside the gear. This provides the Hummingbird with the critical capability to autorotate.

5000|$|The VTM-4 system's {{electronic}} control unit (ECU) determines torque {{which is to be}} distributed to the rear wheels, then electric current is sent to the two electromagnetic coils. The resulting magnetic field moves a rotating steel plate toward each fixed coil. Friction between that steel plate and an adjoining cam plate causes the cam plate to begin turning. As it does, three balls per clutch roll up curved ramps, creating an axial thrust against a clutch-engagement plate. This thrust force compresses the wet clutch plates, thereby engaging drive to the corresponding rear wheel. [...] Unlike mechanically actuated four-wheel drive systems, the VTM-4 system is infinitely variable. The amount of torque provided to the rear wheels is directly proportional to the electric current sent from the ECU and can be adjusted from zero to a preset maximum. This current constantly changes to deliver the optimum rear torque calculated by the ECU. An internal gear pump circulates VTM-4 fluid to cool and lubricate the <b>clutches,</b> <b>bearings,</b> and gears within the rear drive unit. Use of high-strength, low-weight materials such as diecast aluminum for the housing minimizes the bulk and weight of this hardware, helping to keep the weight of the entire all-wheel-drive system to about 212-pounds.|$|R
5000|$|The TRX250R was {{introduced}} for the 1986 model year to answer Suzuki’s LT250R, released the year prior. Honda borrowed many parts from its 3 wheel ATC250R for the Fourtrax’s design, including {{the engine and}} rear suspension. Although mechanically similar, Honda detuned the engine {{for use in the}} Fourtrax, through reduced compression and less aggressive porting, to ensure that the added weight of the quad would not adversely affect the reliability of the engine. [...] The 1987 model year, now absent the three-wheelers due to the CPSC ban, saw the engine receive a five-millimeter longer connecting rod, accompanied by a piston with a wrist pin bore raised five millimeters. Additionally, the cylinder was changed to include a bridged intake. Most of the chassis of the 1987 Fourtrax remained the same. The 1988 model year brought the most dramatic changes to the TRX250R. The compression ratio of the engine was raised to generate more power, bringing it nearly on par with Kawasaki’s powervalved Tecate-4. It was the chassis, however, that received the greatest attention, shedding 25 pounds over the previous year’s model. Additionally a shorter aluminum swing arm was added, but the frame lengthened such that the overall wheelbase was slightly greater. This shifted the weight bias rearward, curing the Fourtrax’s “loop out” problem. Aesthetically, the Fourtrax’s headlight was moved from the handlebars to a mount molded into the hood. This was also the only year to be available with red fenders. For 1989 the TRX250R received few changes. Most notable was the use of a needle <b>bearing</b> in the <b>clutch</b> pressure plate, for smoother action. This needle bearing was a necessary upgrade for the 1988 TRX250R, as well 3. The color was returned to white for its final year.|$|R
40|$|A clutch {{actuator}} {{is used in}} a vehicle to transmit movement and force from the clutch pedal to the release <b>bearing</b> of the <b>clutch.</b> A pneumatic {{clutch actuator}} consists of an anodised aluminium cylinder, inside of which a piston, with a rubber lip seal and a PTFE guiding ring, slides. The system is lubricated with silicone grease before assembly. A commercial clutch actuator of this type, has a service life of 3 million actuations and must function in a wide temperature range, from - 40 ºC to 140 ºC. In this thesis, the complex tribological system of pneumatic clutch actuators has been studied. Field worn actuators have been disassembled and investigated. A laboratory test method has been developed to understand the tribomechanisms present in pneumatic clutch actuators. The test method's capability of simulating the real contact has been verified, by the comparison with studied actuators from the field. The influence of contact parameters: temperature, load, lubrication and particle contamination, has been investigated. In addition, different anodised aluminium surfaces have been studied. The manufacturing method of the aluminium cylinder influences surface topography {{and structure of the}} oxide, resulting in different mechanical and frictional properties. The wear during tests with only silicone grease is reminiscent, but on a lower scale, to the wear during tests with a mixture of silicone grease and standard dust. The initially applied amount of silicone grease is not important, the friction seems to depend on the amount of silicone grease that is dragged into or pushed out from the contact area during testing. Silicone grease lubrication reduces wear of the lip seal. However, during some tests, an adhesive layer, composed of  grease residuals and some PTFE, was formed on the lip. A triple PTFE transfer, from guiding ring to aluminium surface, to lip seal, to aluminium surface, occurred. Such transfer of material from the PTFE guiding ring was detected from the unlubricated tests, and also from the silicone grease lubricated tests, i. e. silicone grease lubrication does not prevent PTFE material transfer...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, {{there has}} been a growing concern {{regarding}} the increasing prices and requirements of energy around the globe. One of the largest and cost effective ways to tackle this issue is by improving the energy efficiency of components/systems. This leads to a reduced total cost of ownership of machines, lower fossil fuel dependency and reduced greenhouse gas emissions. In this thesis two critical high-dynamic components, namely <b>bearings</b> and wet <b>clutches</b> are subjected to detailed energy analysis. Bearings are commonly used component in machines/systems, whereas the wet clutches find application in most of the transmission devices. In addition, these components are considered as significant contributors to the overall energy losses in machines/systems. In view of the critical nature of these two components with regard to energy losses, research is still ongoing to understand the loss mechanisms and to improve the energy efficiency of these components. The needle roller bearing lubricated with a solid-grease is popularly used in applications where there is a demand for high load-carrying capacity, low space requirements and where access to bearings are difficult for maintenance purpose. Nevertheless an appropriate model for calculating the energy losses in needle roller bearings lubricated with solid-grease does not exist. In case of the wet clutch, the mechanisms causing energy losses differ according to the state (engaged or disengaged) of the clutch. When a wet clutch undergoes engagement, the frictional effect (asperity contact torque) is mostly dominant and governs the energy losses. On the other hand, when the wet clutch is in disengaged condition, the viscous effect responsible for producing drag torque is considered as energy loss. The energetic behavior of wet clutches can be examined through modeling and dedicated experiments. For modeling wet clutch engagement cycles, the required characteristics/parameters of the friction model for capturing the dynamic friction phenomena along with the realization of variation in normal force as well as ATF (automatic transmission fluid) temperature observed in wet clutches are unknown. On the other hand, the existing models as well as the experimental data related to drag torque in disengaged wet clutches do not consider the real operating conditions such as variable ATF flow rate and rotational states of the disks for the higher clutch speed range. To overcome these short-comings, this thesis aims to study the energy losses in these two critical components through model development and experimental characterization. This work is helpful in building energy efficient machines/systems. The first contribution redefines the parameters of the Palmgren and SKF® models for predicting power losses in needle roller bearings lubricated with solid-grease. The updated models are applicable for both constant and varying speed profiles under constant loading conditions. In addition, a generic methodology has been proposed in order to verify and update the state-of-the-art models for predicting the power losses of any bearing type with any lubrication condition. The second contribution proposes an extended Reset-Integrator friction model for investigating the energetic (power and energy flow) behavior of wet clutches. The adaptation includes the experimentally determined stribeck function, viscous effect and the delay in actuation pressure signal. The friction torque generated by the extended model is dependent on the relative velocity, normal load and the ATF temperature. The model is validated with experimental results in both the time and the frequency domain. The developed model {{can also be used to}} study wet clutch vibration characteristics. By further analyzing the sets of experimental results, it is confirmed that the amplitude of shudder vibration is independent of the amplitude of applied contact pressure fluctuation. The third contribution through experiments and modeling provides a global view on the performance and energetic behavior of wet clutches with degradation and different initial driving energy levels. For this purpose, experiments are performed using an advanced SAE# 2 test setup designed and built by our industrial collaborator, Dana Spicer Off Highway, Belgium. The simulation model incorporates an existing adapted form of the GMS friction model (for studying effects of degradation) and the developed extended Reset-Integrator friction model (for studying effects of initial driving energy levels). On the basis of the obtained results, some important conclusions are drawn regarding the design aspects of wet clutches such as COF (coefficient of friction), engagement duration, engagement torque, power and energy. Experimental characterization of drag torque in disengaged wet clutches is carried out, constituting a fourth contribution. For this purpose, experiments are performed using an advanced SAE# 2 test setup designed and built by our industrial collaborator, Dana Spicer Off Highway, Belgium considering real operating conditions of wet clutches. By analyzing the obtained experimental results, the relationship between the amount by which the parameters such as ATF flow rate, ATF temperature, disk size and disks rotational states are varied and the corresponding change in the drag torque is established. In addition, a general description of the qualitative behavior of the drag torque in function of clutch speed is proposed and the associated physical phenomena are explained. A mathematical model based on continuity and Navier-Stokes equations, considering laminar flow in the gap between the disks, is developed as the fifth contribution to estimate the drag torque in disengaged wet clutches. The model validation results suggest that the model is capable of predicting the drag torque under real clutch conditions of variable flow rate and disks rotation states for the higher clutch speedrange. status: publishe...|$|R
