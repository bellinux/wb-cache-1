50|$|Coriolis density meters, {{also known}} as mass flow meters or {{inertial}} flow meters, work {{on the principle of}} vibration to measure phase shifts in the vibration of a bent thin walled tube. The bent thin walled tube is rotated around a central axis. When there is no mass in the bent section, the tube remains untwisted. However, when the density inside the bent section increases, the inbound flow portion of the <b>bent</b> <b>pipe</b> drags behind the out flow portion. This twisting causes phase shifts which result in changes in the resonant frequency of the thin walled tube. Therefore, the resonant frequency is directly affected by the density. Higher density media causes a larger coriolis effect if the volumetric flow rate is constant. Flowing media causes a frequency and a phase shift of the <b>bent</b> <b>pipe,</b> which are proportional to the mass flow rate of the sample.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: If ground {{subsidence}} or {{seismic load}} acts on piping that includes bent pipes, the highest stress often occurs {{not in a}} straight section but in a bent section. The author has therefore developed a method of estimating the stress generated by a change in diameter by adding an equation for the diameter change and bending moment to the <b>bent</b> <b>pipe</b> stress calculation equations proposed by Rodabaugh and George. To investigate the validity of this method, two kinds of <b>bent</b> <b>pipe</b> made using typical <b>bent</b> <b>pipe</b> manufacturing methods and having representative section wall thickness distributions were tested to determine {{the relationship between the}} diameter change and the stress generated when in-plane bending moment is applied. As a result, it was confirmed that the stress estimated from the diameter change closely agrees with the measured value. Introduction: It is essential to determine the stress generated in pipelines in order to maintain their safety against external forces, and to do so by non-destructive diagnosis for pipelines that are in service. However, the method involves measuring deformation after installing strain gauges, so it is impossible to diagnose stress over time unless strain gauges are installed when the pipelines are laid.

40|$|Wall-bounded {{turbulent}} dispersed multiphase flows {{occur in}} a variety of industrial, biological and environmental applications. The complex nature of the carrier and the particulate phase is elevated to a higher level when introducing geometrical complexities such as curved walls. Realising such flows and dispersed phases poses challenging problems both from computational and also physical point of view. The present thesis addresses some of these issues by studying a coupled Eulerian–Lagrangian computational framework. The content of the thesis addresses both turbulent wall flows and coupled particle motion. In the first part, turbulent flow in straight pipes is simulated by means of direct numerical simulation (DNS) with the spectrally accurate code nek 5000   to examine the Reynolds-number effect on turbulence statistics. The effect of the curvature to these canonical turbulent pipe flows is then added to generate Prandtl’s secondary motion of first kind. These configurations, as primary complex geometries in this study, are examined by means of statistical analysis to unfold the evolution of turbulence characteristics from a straight pipe. A fundamentally different Prandtl’s secondary motion of the second kind is also put to test by adding side-walls to a canonical turbulent channel flow and analysing the evolution of various statistical quantities with varying the duct width-to-height aspect ratios. Having obtained a characterisation of the turbulent flow in the geometries of <b>bent</b> <b>pipes</b> and ducts, the dispersion of small heavy particles is modelled in these configurations by means of point particles which are one-way coupled to the flow. For this purpose a parallel Lagrangian Particle Tracking (LPT) scheme is implemented in the spectral-element code nek 5000. Its numerical accuracy, parallel scalability and general performance in realistic situations is scrutinised. The analysis of the resulting particle fields shows that even a small amount of secondary motion has a profound impact on the particle phase dynamics and its concentration maps. For each of the aforementioned turbulent flow cases new and challenging questions have arisen to be addressed in the present research works. The goal of extending understanding of the particle dispersion in turbulent <b>bent</b> <b>pipes</b> and rectangular ducts are also achieved. QC 20151118 </p...|$|R
40|$|This work is {{concerned}} with the numerical investigation of the linear stability properties of the viscous, incompressible flow inside a toroidal <b>pipe.</b> <b>Bent</b> <b>pipes</b> are omnipresent: going from industry where they are employed in devices ranging from heat exchangers, to exhausts, to junctions between pieces of straight pipe (for a review see Ref.

In this work we start by analysing a toroidal pipe, which di↵ers from a straight pipe by the addition of one single parameter, the curvature. Despite its relatively simple configuration, the flow inside a toroidal pipe cannot be described analytically. This has lead to the use of approximations to derive a closed-form solution to the Navier–Stokes equations in this geometry. The first solution has been proposed by Dean [2] who treated the problem in the limit of vanishing curvature and computed the first steady state solutions.

Advanced systems are needed for an effective boosting of the engine and today 1 D engine simulation tools are often used for their optimization. This thesis concerns 1 D engine simulation of a turbocharged SI engine and the introduction of CFD computations on components as a way to assess inaccuracies in the 1 D model. 1 D engine simulations have been performed on a turbocharged SI engine and the results have been validated by on-engine measurements in test cell. The operating points considered have been in the engine’s low speed and load region, with the turbocharger’s waste-gate closed. The instantaneous on-engine turbine efficiency was calculated for two different turbochargers based on high frequency measurements in test cell. Unfortunately the instantaneous mass flow rates and temperatures directly upstream and downstream of the turbine could not be measured and simulated values from the calibrated engine model were used. The on-engine turbine efficiency was compared with the efficiency computed by the 1 D code using steady flow data to describe the turbine performance. The results show that the on-engine turbine efficiency shows a hysteretic effect over the exhaust pulse so that the discrepancy between measured and quasi-steady values increases for decreasing mass flow rate after a pulse peak. Flow modeling in pipe geometries that can be representative to those of an exhaust manifold, single <b>bent</b> <b>pipes</b> and double <b>bent</b> <b>pipes</b> and also the outer runners of an exhaust manifold, have been computed in both 1 D and 3 D under steady and pulsating flow conditions. The results have been compared in terms of pressure losses. The results show that calculated pressure gradient for a straight pipe under steady flow is similar using either 1 D or 3 D computations. The calculated pressure drop over a bend is clearly higher 1 D engine simulations of turbocharged engines are difficult to using 1 D computations compared to 3 D computations, both for steady and pulsating flow. Also, the slow decay of the secondary flow structure that develops over a bend, gives a higher pressure gradient in the 3 D calculations compared to the 1 D calculation in the straight pipe parts downstream of a bend.

Usually, concentric pipe structures are used to transmit the rotational motion of the proximal end to the distal end of the gripper. In this method, the shape of the <b>bent</b> inner <b>pipe</b> is {{different from that of the}} outer pipe. This causes strong contact between the outer and inner pipes if the inner pipe has strong flexural rigidity. This causes a large friction torque and a large angle difference (twist angle) between the distal end and the proximal end of the inner pipe. A low friction and elastic plastic-tube for the inner pipe would be valid to reduce the required torque. However, the Young’s modulus of plastic is significantly lower than that of metal and the torsional rigidity is also low, which results in a large twist angle. This paper proposes a procedure to fit the <b>bent</b> inner <b>pipe</b> to the outer pipe such that only the ends of the pipes are in contact with each other. The inner pipe with slits adjusts its flexural rigidity. The proposed method can be applied to various curves.|$|R
