500|$|Early in the {{development}} of XIII, Serah {{was meant to be a}} playable character, but was eventually delegated to a supporting character <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>technical</b> <b>issues.</b> Tetsuya Nomura, in an interview, said that he designed Serah's hair so that her silhouette would mirror Lightning's. For XIII-2, the developers decided to change Serah and Lightning's roles, with Serah becoming the game's main protagonist, while Lightning was the object of her quest. Yusuke Naora was told to design Serah's new costume like the [...] "plug suit" [...] outfits from Neon Genesis Evangelion and was asked to give her a necklace for plot reasons. Part of the challenge for the game was making Serah more active, but maintaining her femininity, which is the reason she was given a bow as her weapon. Another reason behind the design of her weapon was the fact that the developers wanted to give the characters means to attack both up close and at long range. Aside from Naora's design, Yuko Oshima of AKB48 was asked to design two potential DLC outfits for Serah: a black combat outfit titled [...] "Exposure and Defense" [...] (later retitled [...] "Style and Steel"), and a second red-and-white outfit titled [...] "Little Red Riding Hood", meant to be indicative of Serah's change into an adult. After a popular vote, the former costume was chosen and released in April 2012. Serah is voiced by Laura Bailey in English and by Minako Kotobuki in Japanese.|$|E

Di Grassi, Piquet and Jérôme d'Ambrosio rounded out the top five. The third qualifying beginning was delayed when Vergne and Piquet were placed under investigation by the stewards for an irregularity. Félix da Costa stopped his car on the racing line at the turn one exit and the yellow flag was shown until he performed a restart, enabling him to keep driving. Rosenqvist was the fastest driver in the third group, with Stéphane Sarrazin and Duval finishing behind the Mahindra driver. López pushed hard and oversteered through the seventh turn, impacting the barrier, and damaging the rear-right corner of his vehicle. He stopped further down the track and the session was temporarily stopped. Félix da Costa was granted permission by race control to complete his timed lap but damaged his front-right suspension in an impact with the chicane's inside barrier.
