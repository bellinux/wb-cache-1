25|$|There are {{two basic}} molding methods for PET bottles, {{one-step}} and two-step. In two-step molding, two separate machines are used. The first machine injection molds the preform, which resembles a test tube, with the bottle-cap threads already molded into place. The body of the tube is significantly thicker, as it will be inflated into its final shape in the second step using stretch <b>blow</b> <b>molding.</b>|$|E
25|$|Such {{copolymers}} are advantageous {{for certain}} molding applications, such as thermoforming, {{which is used}} for example to make tray or blister packaging from co-PET film, or amorphous PET sheet (A-PET/PETA) or PETG sheet. On the other hand, crystallization is important in other applications where mechanical and dimensional stability are important, such as seat belts. For PET bottles, the use of small amounts of isophthalic acid, CHDM, diethylene glycol (DEG) or other comonomers can be useful: if only small amounts of comonomers are used, crystallization is slowed but not prevented entirely. As a result, bottles are obtainable via stretch <b>blow</b> <b>molding</b> ("SBM"), which are both clear and crystalline enough to be an adequate barrier to aromas and even gases, such as carbon dioxide in carbonated beverages.|$|E

Material that have been used is aluminum, which is the same material used for the real industrial mold. Overall, this project was run based on three main steps; design using Solid Work, running a simulation on Master CAM and fabricate using CNC Milling Machine. As for the research process, it starts off with an introduction on <b>blow</b> <b>mold,</b> which includes mold material and design; and a review on the software package being used which is a Master CAM commercial package. Then a further introduction focused on details about CNC Milling Machine. The method of conducting a Design and Simulation is presented; step by step.

A conclusion on project simulation and accuracy of the models used, as well as the problem that occur during completing it, is then presented...|$|R

5000|$|<b>Blow</b> <b>molding</b> ( [...] BrE {{moulding}} [...] ) is {{a manufacturing}} {{process by which}} hollow plastic parts are formed: It is also used for forming glass bottles.

50|$|The process {{principle}} {{comes from}} the idea of glassblowing. Someone produced a <b>blow</b> <b>molding</b> machine and sold it to Hartford Empire Company in 1938. This {{was the beginning of the}} commercial <b>blow</b> <b>molding</b> process.

50|$|The {{process of}} {{injection}} <b>blow</b> <b>molding</b> (IBM) {{is used for}} the production of hollow glass and plastic objects in large quantities.

This is the least-used of the three <b>blow</b> <b>molding</b> processes, and is typically used to make small medical and single serve bottles. The process is divided into three steps: injection, blowing and ejection.|$|E
