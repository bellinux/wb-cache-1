25|$|Evgenii is accorded equal {{status with}} Peter in purely human terms, and his {{rebellion}} against state power {{is shown to}} be as admirable and significant in its way {{as that of the}} Decembrists. Yet turning now to the question of Evgenii’s role in the wider scheme of things, we have to admit that he seems an insignificant third factor in the equation when viewed {{against the backdrop of the}} titanic struggle taking place between Peter and the elements. Evgenii is utterly and completely helpless against both. The flood sweeps away all his dreams of happiness, and it is in the river that he meets his death. Peter’s statue, which at their first ‘encounter’ during the flood had its back turned to Evgenii as if ignoring him, late hounds him mercilessly when he dares to protest at Peter’s role in his suffering. The vast, impersonal forces of order and chaos, locked in an unending struggle– these,Pushkin seems to be saying, are the reality: these are the millstones of destiny or of the historical process to which Evgenii and his kind are <b>but</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> grist.|$|E

[...] He also praised the episode's guest voice actors, citing in particular Bill Hader's character Mickey as [...] "very odd, <b>but</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> fun"; Bonaime gave [...] "Bob Fires the Kids" [...] an overall grade of 8.3 out of 10. Jen Johnson, writing for Den of Geek, also cited Mickey as a highlight of the episode, stating: [...] "I would say that I hope {{this is the end of}} Mickey and the chaos he brings to the Belcher family, but [...] was just too much fun. I hope he comes back." ...|$|E

500|$|Actress Jasika Nicole {{explained}} in a May 2009 interview that the scariest episode for her {{at the time was}} [...] "Unleashed". She described the episode's production, [...] "The props people had these big buckets of earth worms, but they were thicker and meatier and longer. They had teeny little bitty faces... So the guy's chest is cut open and he’s been in make-up for hours {{to make it look like}} he’s been torn open and he’s all bloody and stuff. So then they pour these worms and this goopy, syrupy stuff and this fake blood onto this guy’s chest... We had to zip him up in the body bag. It takes a few minutes to get to 'action' after he's zipped up. We unzip him and we see the worms and it’s so gross–and the look on his face. The worms are crawling up and their in his armpits and starting to crawl toward his face and he can’t move at all because he’s supposed to be dead." [...] Nicole continued that this scene had to be shot [...] "three or four times. We kept trying to get faster and faster but we were all laughing [...] It was like a Fear Factor episode with no chance of getting money... It was so gross <b>but</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> fun. The guy was such a trooper." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{first two}} {{volumes of the}} Japanese edition were {{described}} by Anime News Network (ANN) as [...] "quietly brilliant" [...] and [...] "the slice-of-life genre at its best", saying that despite some [...] "storytelling goofs", there is [...] "no matching the pleasant feelings that come from reading this series." [...] The French edition was praised by Manga News as a [...] "great success" [...] and [...] "a pure delight as usual," [...] citing as key ingredients the [...] "appealing and funny characters" [...] put in funny situations, accessible drawing style, and Adachi's talent for staging baseball scenes; Adachi was praised {{for his ability to}} mix [...] "the sports world which he cherishes so much and the love relationships that are not yet real <b>but</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> implied and awaited" [...] and his skill at rendering moving scenes without dialogue. The reviewer noted that while Adachi's art style has not changed much since Touch, his layouts are cleaner and his action scenes more dynamic than before. Anime Land praised Adachi for his [...] "sense of the elliptical and staging", the verisimilitude of his stories, appealing secondary characters, and ability to develop comedy in just one panel. The reviewer claimed Adachi's handling of Wakaba's death is [...] "remarkable" [...] and that the event [...] "gave real meaning" [...] to the story.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} critics. HitFix Senior Editor Alan Sepinwall wrote, [...] "It wasn't a perfect episode, mainly because Vivian remains a fairly muddled, bratty villain, and because I don't {{feel like the}} show ever really used Ray Wise to his full potential. <b>But</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> of it was so satisfying, both emotionally and comedically, that, until Vivian called Chuck during the rehearsal dinner, I actually thought to myself, 'You know, {{this would be a}} pretty damn good finale in and of itself. Ryan McGee of The A.V. Club rated the episode a B on an A+ to F scale. McGee wrote, [...] "The last act was fairly phenomenal, but we had to get through a lot of troubling material in order to achieve true liftoff on the hour. With so many loose ends to wrap up, the hour felt overstuffed: the impending wedding, The Norseman, Agent X, Morgan's first field assignment...I mean, that's a lot of stuff. And it doesn't help that Vivian Volkoff {{is at the center of}} three of those things, and inserted herself into the fourth at the last moment. And in thinking about the clunkiness of aspects of this episode, I thought about the clunkiness of this latter half of the season as a whole." [...] Eric Goldman of IGN gave this episode a score of 8.5 out of 10, writing that it was a mistake not to include Timothy Dalton as Alexei Volkoff after the plot twists of the previous episode. Sarah Stegall of SFScope wrote, [...] "Chuck is killing me by inches. So close, so close to the Chuck/Sarah wedding, but things keep going wrong." ...|$|E

2500|$|Yoko Ono {{also noted}} Bowie's {{friendship}} with herself and John Lennon, and {{thanked him for}} being a [...] "father figure" [...] to her son following Lennon's death. Kate Bush, noted for rarely giving public statements, told The Guardian in an interview: [...] "David Bowie had everything. He was intelligent, imaginative, brave, charismatic, cool, sexy and truly inspirational both visually and musically. He created such staggeringly brilliant work, yes, <b>but</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> of {{it and it was}} so good. There are great people who make great work but who else has left a mark like his? No one like him". The Who honoured Bowie during their concert of 3 March 2016 at New York's Madison Square Garden with images of Bowie and noting [...] "We'll miss our friend, a true icon of music and art, and a brilliant innovator." ...|$|E
2500|$|Returning to Boston in July 1832, Howe began {{receiving}} a few blind children at his father’s house in Pleasant Street. He gradually developed {{what became the}} noted Perkins Institution. In January 1833 the funds available were all spent, <b>but</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> progress had been shown that the legislature approved funding, later increased to $30,000 a year, to the institution on condition that it should educate gratuitously twenty poor blind from the state. Collections of funds were also contributed from Salem and Boston. Colonel Thomas Handasyd Perkins, a prominent Boston trader in slaves, furs, and opium, presented his mansion and grounds in Pearl Street {{as a location for}} the school in perpetuity. This building was later found unsuitable and Colonel Perkins consented to its sale. In 1839 the institution was moved to the former Mount Washington House Hotel in South Boston. It was henceforth known as the Perkins Institution and Massachusetts Asylum (or, since 1877, School for the Blind.) ...|$|E
