5|$|In {{the early}} {{afternoon}} <b>Burke</b> <b>and</b> McDougal {{pleaded not guilty to}} the murder of Docherty. The first witnesses were then called from a list of 55 that included Hare and Knox; not all the witnesses on the list were called and Knox, with three of his assistants, avoided being questioned in court. One of Knox's assistants, David Paterson—who had been the main person <b>Burke</b> <b>and</b> Hare had dealt with at Knox's surgery—was called and confirmed the pair had supplied the doctor with several corpses.|$|E

Burke checked with Knox, who confirmed Hare had sold a woman's body for £8. It led to an argument {{between the two men}} and they came to blows. <b>Burke</b> <b>and</b> his wife moved into the home of his cousin, John Broggan (or Brogan), two streets away from Tanner's Close.|$|E

5|$|The {{next day}} the Grays returned, and Ann became {{suspicious}} when Burke would not let her approach a bed where she had left her stockings. When they were left {{alone in the house}} in the early evening, the Grays searched the straw and found Docherty's body, showing blood and saliva on the face. On their way to alert the police, they ran into McDougal who tried to bribe them with an offer of £10 a week; they refused. While the Grays reported the murder to the police, <b>Burke</b> <b>and</b> Hare removed the body and took it to Knox's surgery. The police search located Docherty's bloodstained clothing hidden under the bed. <b>Burke</b> <b>and</b> his wife gave different times for Docherty's departure from the house, which raised enough suspicion for the police to take them in for questioning. Early the following morning the police went to Knox's dissecting-rooms where they found Docherty's body; James Gray identified her as the woman he had seen with <b>Burke</b> <b>and</b> Hare. Hare and his wife were arrested that day, as was Broggan; all denied any knowledge of the events.|$|E
