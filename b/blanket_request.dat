5000|$|Elites’ {{concern about}} racial purity or [...] "limpieza de sangre" [...] (purity of blood), which in Spain largely {{revolved}} around whether one was of pure Christian heritage, in Spanish America encompassed the [...] "taint" [...] of non-white admixture. A key work is María Elena Martínez’s Genealogical Fictions, showing {{the extent to}} which elite families sought erase blemishes from genealogies. [...] Another essential work to understand the workings of race in Spanish America is Ann Twinam’s work on petitions to the crown by mulattos and pardos for dispensation from their non-white status, to pursue education or a profession, and later as a <b>blanket</b> <b>request</b> not tied to professional rules prohibiting non-whites to practice. In the decades following Tannenbaum's work, there were few of these documents, known cédulas de gracias al sacar,, with just four cases identified, but the possibility of upward social mobility {{played an important role in}} framing scholarly analysis of dynamics of race in Spanish America. [...] Considerable work on social mobility preceded that work, with R. Douglas Cope’s The Limits of Racial Domination remaining important.|$|E

50|$|After {{the lawsuit}} was filed, Pigford <b>requested</b> <b>blanket</b> {{mediation}} to cover what {{was thought to be}} about 2,000 farmers who may have been discriminated against. The U.S. Department of Justice opposed the mediation, saying that each case had to be investigated separately. As the case moved toward trial, the presiding judge certified as a class all black farmers who filed discrimination complaints against the USDA between 1983 and 1997.|$|R
5000|$|A speaker {{providing}} a U.S. business perspective stated that his company, {{in common with}} other ICT companies effected by government requests to access and monitor user data, did not accept <b>blanket</b> <b>requests</b> for access. However, they were subject {{to the rule of}} law and treated each individual request from the government on its merits. He also commented that surveillance revelations were a major problem for the Internet industry; if users didn't trust a company's products they would go elsewhere. A comment from a remote participant referred to reports that U.S. cloud companies can expect to lose business from non-U.S. customers to the tune of many billions of dollars, with the overall negative impact on the IT industry even greater because of this loss of trust. A speaker from the Internet technical community echoed these concerns about the loss of trust in Internet products and services. He pointed out that there was an understanding that intelligence activities targeted individuals and groups, but the very large scale of the alleged monitoring shocked and surprised many. This observation about the massive scale of the monitoring was shared by many, and led to questions about the central role of a single country in many aspects of the Internet; from the control of infrastructure and the success and global spread of commercial services, to positions of oversight over critical Internet functions. Concern over these issues was one of the motivations behind the proposed Internet governance summit to be held in Brazil in May 2014. A commenter noted that Brazil intends for the meeting to be a [...] "Summit" [...] in the sense that it will be high level and will have authority enough to make decisions.|$|R

The Gulf Stream Hotel in Lake Worth was converted into a hospital. A total of 1,274people slept in shelters in West Palm Beach on September17. With the need for additional cots and <b>blankets,</b> a <b>request</b> for them was sent to the United States Army, which promptly sent 2,000cots and 1,000blankets from Fort McPherson in Georgia to relief centers in Belle Glade, Boynton Beach, Canal Point, Jupiter, Kelsey City, Pahokee, Riviera Beach, and West Palm Beach. Many other cots and blankets were later transported to the area. A number of winter residents allowed their homes to be used as shelters.|$|R

Claxton, chief of the Miami Department of Public Welfare, requested antitoxin, typhoid serum, and at least 200 tetanus serums. The Florida Department of Health granted the request. Of the inoculations distributed, there were 10,349 for typhoid, 1,025 for smallpox, and 337 for tetanus. A health bulletin issued on September 28 indicated that due to vaccinations and other efforts by state and local health departments, there was [...] "no outbreak of typhoid, malaria, influenza, or any other communicable diseases, and we do no anticipate any." [...] Overall, 210 doctors and 78 nurses worked in the disaster area, each accumulating more than 50 hours of service. [...] Many other individuals and organizations contributed to relief efforts. A group of men with trucks were dispatched northward from Miami to clear trees and other debris from the roads. They worked quickly enough to reach West Palm Beach by the night of September 17. Early on September 18, a train leaving Miami carried 20 doctors and 20 nurses to West Palm Beach. At least 100 people were brought to Miami for medical treatment. In addition to trains, supplies were transported to Palm Beach County by 93 vehicles making an average of 553 trips per day and 51 trucks recording a mean of 206 trips daily. Thirty-eight motor boats and 4 airplanes also delivered supplies. On September 23, then-Governor of Georgia Lamartine Griffin Hardman offered aid to Florida, urging his state to assist [...] "in every possible way." [...] On November 18, every Catholic church in the United States contributed a portion of their offering, with $84,200 in aid given to Florida and Puerto Rico. Masonic lodges throughout the United States collectively donated more than $107,000.|$|R
5000|$|The 45th and Colonel McCray's brigade, was {{assigned}} to Maj. Gen. James F. Fagan's division, of Sterling Price's Army of Missouri, for Price's Missouri Expedition (commonly referred to a Price's Raid). [...] The 45th fought {{in some of the}} most fierce combat operations on Price's Raid. Its war record is mixed. It was hampered due to lack of ammunition, food, blankets weapons, and uniforms. It also was hampered by leadership who were used to operating as Infantry, and several of the men were conscripts, and deserters. Colonel Baber was captured in the fight near Independence, Missouri, on October 22, 1864. Upon Colonel Baber's capture, Lieutenant Colonel John W. Clark assumed command of the regiment. Major George R. James was promoted to Lieutenant Colonel and Captain C. J. Wasburn, who had previously commanded Company A, was advanced to the rank of Major. According to John Edward's [...] "Shelby and his Men", and the book [...] "Action Before Westport", the crossing of the Little Blue on the afternoon and evening of the 21st of October 1864 was met with fierce Federal resistance. Elements of Fagan's Division (which the 45th belonged to) were trying to protect the crossing and Price's very long train. Cabell's brigade was ordered to protect the train in order to allow Fagan's troops to concentrate on forcing the crossing. Somewhere during that time frame Colonel Baber was captured, however the records are not clear as to exactly when or how Colonel Baber was captured. Colonel Baber was sent first to Alton prison and then transferred to Camp Douglas. While a prisoner of war, Colonel Baber wrote letters on behalf of the enlisted prisoners <b>requesting</b> <b>blankets.</b>|$|R
