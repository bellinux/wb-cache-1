5|$|Devin Hester {{was born}} to Juanita Brown and Lenorris Hester, Sr. in Riviera Beach, Florida. His parents {{separated}} {{when he was a}} toddler. <b>Before</b> <b>he</b> <b>became</b> <b>a</b> teenager, his mother was severely injured in a car accident, while his father died of cancer two years later. His step-father, Derrick Brown, and brother, Lenorris, Jr., helped Hester escape his depression and rebuild his life by introducing him to football. He soon returned to his normal life and began to excel in sports and academics.|$|E
5|$|On 15 January 1911, Bielovucic {{returned}} to Peru, bringing with him {{an airplane and}} the technical staff requested by the Peruvian Aviation League. In Santa Beatriz, he took off piloting the first aircraft flight in Peru, flying over Lima, Callao and above the Pacific Ocean coast. The flight was witnessed by the President of Peru Augusto B. Leguía and other dignitaries. On 29 January he completed a 20-minute flight from Lima to Ancón, a day <b>before</b> <b>he</b> <b>became</b> <b>a</b> flight instructor in the first flying school in South America. In early 1911 he became Peruvian Aviation Corps (PAC) colonel and {{returned to}} France as an air force envoy.|$|E
5|$|Since {{his early}} youth {{he was very}} {{enthusiastic}} about flying and volunteered for military service in the Luftwaffe of the Third Reich on 10 December 1935. There he participated {{in a number of}} exercises and was promoted to Leutnant (second lieutenant) of the Reserves on 1 December 1936. In his civilian life, Brändle attained a pilot license and worked as a flight instructor. As an instructor, he trained roughly 150 students and logged more than 6,000 starts and 8,000 flight hours <b>before</b> <b>he</b> <b>became</b> <b>a</b> military aviator. In addition to his passion for motor power flight, he also was a glider pilot.|$|E

5|$|The 1784 Enclosure Act allowed Henry Bankes the Younger, {{grandson}} of Ralph Bankes, {{to create the}} current estate and parkland footprint. He demolished the hamlet of Kingston which was situated adjacent to the 16th-century Keeper's Lodge, diverted the Blandford road (now the B3082) and converted former agricultural land to parkland. He undertook further minor alterations in the 1820s, <b>before</b> <b>he</b> <b>became</b> <b>a</b> Member of Parliament for the rotten borough of Corfe. He was a trustee for the British Museum and its parliamentary advocate, {{and some of his}} collections which were once part of the house, are now in the museum. Bankes entertained his friends at the house, including William Pitt the Younger and Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington.|$|E
5|$|The Eucharist {{was a key}} {{center of}} {{controversy}} in the Reformation as it not only focused differences between the reformers and the church but also between themselves. For Zwingli {{it was a matter}} of attacking a doctrine that imperiled the understanding and reception of God's gift of salvation, while for Luther {{it was a matter of}} defending a doctrine that embodied that gift. It is not known what Zwingli's eucharistic theology was <b>before</b> <b>he</b> <b>became</b> <b>a</b> reformer and there is disagreement among scholars about his views during his first few years as a priest. In the eighteenth article of The Sixty-seven Articles (1523) which concerns the sacrifice of the mass, he states that it is a memorial of the sacrifice. He expounds on this in An Exposition of the Articles (1523).|$|E
5|$|The {{interpersonal}} {{conflicts and}} feuds {{leading to the}} gunfight were complex. Each side had strong family ties. The brothers James, Virgil, Wyatt, Morgan, and Warren Earp were a tight-knit family, working together as pimps, lawmen, and saloon owners in several frontier towns, among other occupations, and had moved together from one town to another. Virgil served in the Union Army during the American Civil War and in 1877 became {{a police officer in}} Prescott, Arizona. He followed that with a job as a night watchman <b>before</b> <b>he</b> <b>became</b> <b>a</b> constable. Wyatt had held two jobs as a police officer in the cattle-drive towns of Wichita and Dodge City, Kansas.|$|E

5|$|The {{son of a}} publisher, Waugh {{was educated}} at Lancing College and then at Hertford College, Oxford, and briefly worked as a {{schoolmaster}} <b>before</b> <b>he</b> <b>became</b> <b>a</b> full-time writer. As a young man, he acquired many fashionable and aristocratic friends, and developed a taste for country house society. In the 1930s, he travelled extensively, often as a special newspaper correspondent in which capacity he reported from Abyssinia {{at the time of}} the 1935 Italian invasion. He served in the British armed forces throughout the Second World War (1939–1945), first in the Royal Marines and then in the Royal Horse Guards. He was a perceptive writer who used the experiences and the wide range of people he encountered in his works of fiction, generally to humorous effect. Waugh's detachment was such that he fictionalised his own mental breakdown, which occurred in the early 1950s.|$|E
5|$|Earl Ralph {{had secured}} {{control of the}} castle at Dol, and in September 1076 William {{advanced}} into Brittany and laid siege to the castle. King Philip of France later relieved the siege and defeated William at Dol, forcing him to retreat back to Normandy. Although this was William's first defeat in battle, it did little to change things. An Angevin attack on Maine was defeated in late 1076 or 1077, with Count Fulk le Rechin wounded in the unsuccessful attack. More serious was the retirement of Simon de Crépy, the Count of Amiens, to a monastery. <b>Before</b> <b>he</b> <b>became</b> <b>a</b> monk, Simon handed his county of the Vexin over to King Philip. The Vexin was a buffer state between Normandy and the lands of the French king, and Simon had been a supporter of William. William {{was able to make}} peace with Philip in 1077 and secured a truce with Count Fulk in late 1077 or early 1078.|$|E
5|$|The now {{recurring}} character Professor Frink {{makes his}} first appearance on the show in this episode. Frink was originally written as a mad scientist, but when cast member Hank Azaria ad-libbed a voice for Frink, he did an impression of Jerry Lewis's The Nutty Professor character, and the writing staff started making Frink more of a parody of Lewis. Frink was named after The Simpsons writer John Frink; however, that was <b>before</b> <b>he</b> <b>became</b> <b>a</b> writer for the show. The episode features a guest appearance from American actress Audrey Meadows as Bea. Al Jean, a writer on the show, said Meadows was perfect for the role because she was very sweet, and the staff {{had a lot of}} fun during the recording sessions with her. This is the only episode to date where the closing credits actually states which characters each actor voices. This was done because the staff often received questions from fans regarding what characters each voice actor provided the voice for.|$|E

5|$|The {{relation}} {{of church and}} state in Zwingli's mind is best represented in a statue by the Wasserkirche, where he stands with a Bible {{in one hand and a}} sword in the other. For him, the church and state are one under the sovereign rule of God. The development of the complex relationship between church and state in Zwingli's view can only be understood by examining the context of his life, the city of Zürich, and the wider Swiss Confederation. His earliest writings <b>before</b> <b>he</b> <b>became</b> <b>a</b> reformer, such as The Ox (1510) and The Labyrinth (1516), reveal a patriotic love of his land, a longing for liberty, and opposition to the mercenary service where young Swiss citizens were sent to fight in foreign wars for the financial benefit of the state government. His life as a parish priest and an army chaplain helped to develop his concern for morality and justice. He saw his ministry not limited to a private sphere, but to the people as a whole.|$|E
5|$|Yorkshire's run {{of success}} ended in 1926 as fierce rivals Lancashire relegated them into second place. Kilner had some {{successful}} matches {{in the season}} and achieved at a consistent level, but his performance showed signs of deteriorating. He scored 1,187 runs at 37.09, the highest seasonal average of his career. He completed the double for the fourth and final time by taking 107 wickets, but his bowling average of 22.52 was his worst since 1920, <b>before</b> <b>he</b> <b>became</b> <b>a</b> regular bowler. He finished sixth in the Yorkshire batting and third in the bowling averages. He played for the Players for the final time at Lord's, scoring 72, but failed to take a wicket. His final first-class century came against Middlesex, when he compiled 150 {{out of a total}} of 415, dominating the scoring while he was at the crease. During the summer's Ashes series, he was selected for the first four Tests. He only batted twice with a highest score of 36. With the ball, he took seven wickets at 39.42, but the editor of Wisden criticised much of the English bowling; he described Kilner's only notable achievement as quickly ending Australia's innings in the second Test at Lord's. For the final Test, Kilner was dropped in favour of 48-year-old Wilfred Rhodes. According to the chairman of selectors, Pelham Warner, Rhodes was recalled because of the lack of an effective alternative left-arm spinner. Rhodes had a successful match and England defeated Australia to win the Ashes for the first time since 1912, but Kilner had played his last Test. In nine Tests, he scored 233 runs at an average of 33.28 and took 24 wickets at 30.58.|$|E
25|$|Gourley {{first took}} an active {{interest}} in politics in 1857, {{when he became}} a town councillor. It was a role he was to continue until 1865, just three years <b>before</b> <b>he</b> <b>became</b> <b>a</b> Member of Parliament for Sunderland.|$|E

25|$|Little {{is known}} of his life <b>before</b> <b>he</b> <b>became</b> <b>a</b> bishop; the {{assignment}} of his birth to the year 315 rests on conjecture.

25|$|Young Mark Twain deserted long <b>before</b> <b>he</b> <b>became</b> <b>a</b> famous {{writer and}} lecturer, but he often commented upon the episode in comic fashion. Beneath his {{desertion}} from a Missouri State Guard unit was his deep unease about losing his personal honor, {{his fear of}} facing death as a soldier, and his rejection of a Southern identity as a professional author.|$|E

25|$|In 1518, when {{he became}} the pastor of the Grossmünster in Zürich, Huldrych Zwingli began to preach ideas on {{reforming}} the Catholic Church. Zwingli who was a Catholic priest <b>before</b> <b>he</b> <b>became</b> <b>a</b> Reformer, often referred to the Pope as the antichrist. He wrote: “I know that in it works the might {{and power of the}} Devil, that is, of the Antichrist”.|$|E
25|$|Born in Christchurch, King {{worked in}} {{surveying}} and farming <b>before</b> <b>he</b> <b>became</b> <b>a</b> professional soldier in New Zealand's Permanent Forces in 1910.

25|$|Noel Malcolm and Cees Leijenhorst {{deny the}} {{political}} {{background of the}} Hobbes-Boyle controversy. They argue that Hobbes’ rejection of the void has no political agenda and {{has nothing to do}} with his attack on incorporeal substances, as Shapin and Schaffer claim. Both Malcolm and Leijenhorst call attention to the remarkable fact that Hobbes was already attacking incorporeal substances when he was a vacuist, and long <b>before</b> <b>he</b> <b>became</b> <b>a</b> plenist.|$|E
