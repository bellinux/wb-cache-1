500|$|The rowing {{correspondent}} for The Times suggested that [...] "for Oxford {{it was a}} sad day, and for Cooper a tragedy", while for Cambridge it was [...] "a splendid victory". [...] Cambridge's stroke Hoffman said [...] "it was a tough race ... <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> that one of the Oxford crew was in distress, I knew we could not help winning." [...] It was the third time since the war that Oxford had lost the event {{as a result of a}} crew member collapsing mid-race. [...] Oxford's bow Richard Bate confessed that he [...] "didn't even know anything had been wrong until after the race. [...] I only knew we were not at our best." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2007, Gene Wilder said {{he chose}} not to see the film. [...] "The thing that put me off ... I like Johnny Depp, I like him, as an actor I like him very much ... <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> little pieces in the {{promotion}} of what he was doing, I said I don't want to see the film, because I don't want to be disappointed in him." [...] In 2013, when Wilder was asked about the Burton remake, he said [...] "I think it's an insult. It's probably Warner Bros.' insult." [...] He also criticized the choices that Burton made as a director, saying [...] "I don't care for that director. He's a talented man, but I don't care for him doing stuff like he did." ...|$|E
500|$|On 14 December 2002, Waddle, {{accompanied}} by Charles Gittins, traveled to Japan to apologize personally to the victims' families. [...] On 15 December, Waddle visited the Ehime Maru memorial at Uwajima Fisheries High School {{and placed a}} wreath of white lilies before {{a monument to the}} dead, bowed in silence and then read the victims' names aloud. [...] No local officials were present during Waddle's visit, citing statements from some victims' families that they did not want Waddle to visit. [...] Later that day, Waddle met with some of {{the families of the victims}} and with some of the survivors. [...] The next day, in Tokyo, Waddle met with Masumi Terata. [...] Speaking of her meeting with Waddle, Terata stated, [...] "I am first and foremost the family member of a victim and Mr. Waddle is first and foremost a victimizer. <b>But</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> Mr. Waddle as a person who was crying and apologizing, I thought he was apologizing from the heart." ...|$|E

60|$|I {{wondered}} why these agile creatures required connecting bridges between the trees, <b>but</b> later <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> the motley aggregation of half-savage beasts which they kept within their village I realized {{the necessity for}} the pathways. There {{were a number of}} the same vicious wolf-dogs which we had left worrying the dyryth, and many goatlike animals whose distended udders explained the reasons for their presence.|$|R
500|$|Downey {{acknowledged}} the potential controversy over his role: [...] "At {{the end of}} the day, it's always about how well you commit to the character. If I didn't feel it was morally sound, or that it would be easily misinterpreted that I'm just C. Thomas Howell , I would've stayed home." [...] Jackson stated: [...] "When I first read the script, I was like: What? Blackface? <b>But</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> him [...] he, like, became a black man ...It was just good acting. It was weird on the set because he would keep going with the character. He's a method actor." [...] Stiller commented on Downey's portrayal of a white actor playing a black man: [...] "When people see the movie— {{in the context of the}} film, he's playing a method actor who's gone to great lengths to play a black guy. The movie is skewering actors and how they take themselves so seriously." [...] Stiller previewed the film before the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, and several black journalists reacted positively to the character.|$|E
500|$|The {{video is}} {{structured}} as a cinematic peep show and voyeurism that portrays Madonna as a stripper. According to Mondino, the peep show {{was his idea}} since at that time, [...] "we were into a period where we were experimenting [...] some kind of freedom about the body, about sexuality and stuff". He {{wanted to have a}} [...] "naive and sweet" [...] feel with the portrayal of a boy waiting outside for Madonna. They built the set from scratch, including the frontal part with the ticket booth. Although it looked fake, Mondino liked it saying [...] "I like the fakeness of it. I haven't seen it for a long time, <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> it once again, I said, 'It's so naïve'. It's kind of badly done, which I like, compared to today. We didn't have the same equipment, people are more skillful today, but there's something sweet about it." [...] Madonna was initially asked by him to wear a black wig, and the initial reaction to the whole wardrobe was positive. But Madonna wanted Mondino's opinion on the whole ensemble, who replied that she would look better as a blonde. So the wig was kept for the initial scenes of the video only.|$|E
2500|$|Both {{participants}} and {{observers of the}} Cedar Revolution demonstrations have asked if the movement was influenced by recent local and regional events supporting democracy. Lebanese Druze leader Walid Jumblatt remarked to a reporter of the Washington Post, [...] "It's strange {{for me to say}} it, but this process of change has started because of the American invasion of Iraq. I was cynical about Iraq. <b>But</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> the Iraqi people voting three weeks ago, 8 million of them, it was {{the start of a new}} Arab world".|$|E

2500|$|On 1 November 1894, Alexander III died aged just 49 at Livadia. In {{her diary}} Maria wrote, [...] "I am utterly heartbroken and despondent, <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> the blissful smile {{and the peace}} in his face that came after, it gave me strength." [...] Two days later, the Prince and Princess of Wales arrived at Livadia from London. While the Prince of Wales {{took it upon himself}} to involve himself in the {{preparations}} for the funeral, the Princess of Wales spent her time comforting grieving Maria, including praying with her and sleeping at her bedside.|$|E
2500|$|The {{video for}} [...] "Sweet Guy" [...] was {{directed}} by Claudia Castle, who had earlier directed Kelly's [...] "To Her Door", which won 'Best Video' at the ARIA Music Awards of 1988. The video is shot {{in black and white}} and switches between Kelly and his band, and a couple fighting and making up. Kelly later wrote that he was disappointed in the video, [...] "this one looked like an ad for coffee or sheets... had worked with us on a couple of videos previously ... that had turned out really well. We'd talked this one through and made a plan ... <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> the rough cut my heart sank. And there wasn't much I could do to change it".|$|E
2500|$|The idea of {{the cover}} was Siouxsie's. Photographer Paul Wakefield met her and the band to discuss the project: [...] "The idea was to shoot disquieting and unnerving images {{underwater}} {{in a swimming pool}} – you can’t scream underwater. I {{wanted to be able to}} completely control the lighting, and so an indoor pool was the only option. I scouted quite a few pools, <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> this pool in the YMCA in Central London, which was dark blue tiled with light blue lane stripes instead of the normal reverse colors, I knew it was the ideal location. I wanted to give it an eerie underwater night-time feel, and this setting was perfect. We used a number of 1000K and 2000K lights around the pool edge. I used school kids as models and they pretty well ran riot." ...|$|E

He's {{motivated}} by his film a lot and does not believe in any compromises." [...] She also stated that, at one point she had worked twenty-eight hours at a stretch, <b>but</b> that <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> the result on the screen afterwards, I was in tears because it was clearly worth it." ...|$|R
2500|$|On August 6, 2013, Taco Bell {{announced}} it was expanding its test market of waffle tacos to about 100 restaurants in Fresno, California, Omaha, Nebraska and Chattanooga, Tennessee, starting August 8. The waffle taco includes scrambled eggs, sausage and a side of syrup. It was the top selling item during breakfast hours at the five Southern California restaurants where they were tested earlier in 2013. The breakfast menu started on March 27, 2014. Other items include A.M. Crunchwrap, Cinnabon Delights, breakfast burrito, A.M. grilled sausage flatbread melt, hash browns, coffee and orange juice. The ad campaign which began March 27 used twenty-five men who were named Ronald McDonald, {{a reference to the}} famous clown of a rival chain. Another commercial advertising the Waffle Taco has the narrator singing [...] "I've been eating Egg McMuffins since 1984. [...] <b>But</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> Taco Bell made a Waffle Taco, I figured I would get with the times" [...] set to the tune of [...] "Old MacDonald Had a Farm", another shot at the rival hamburger chain.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{it was not}} planned, Zsa Zsa {{was given}} a {{personality}} {{similar to that of}} her on-screen aunt, Shirley Carter (Linda Henry), an established character in EastEnders. During the development of the character, she changed a lot and was fluid until filming started, when Kenny had a full day on set with Henry. She explained: [...] "The words were there and I knew what she was like <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> Linda [...] speak and when I engaged with her, I realised that it was like looking in a mirror." [...] When the character was announced, she was described as beautiful, funky, an outspoken tomboy, very bright, but likes to think she does not need anybody's help. Kenny said of the character in an interview with Soaplife magazine: [...] "Zsa Zsa doesn't like authority or anyone who messes with her. She's a lone wolf and doesn't care about anyone." [...] She told entertainment website Digital Spy that Zsa Zsa is [...] "a real bitch" [...] and [...] "very mean and cold", while a profile for the character on the official EastEnders website says she is sarcastic, a rebel and [...] "desperately wants the security that comes with a family but is terrified of being dependent on anyone. Her experience has taught her that adults let you down." ...|$|E
2500|$|For nearly 30 years, Kiedis and Faith No More/Mr. Bungle singer Mike Patton {{have been}} {{involved}} in an ongoing feud. Faith No More (then fronted by Chuck Mosley) and The Red Hot Chili Peppers prior to the feud had toured together in support of their 1987 funk metal albums The Uplift Mofo Party Plan and Introduce Yourself. However things turned ugly between the two in 1989 when Kiedis accused Mosley's replacement Patton of imitating his style on stage and in their music video for their biggest hit [...] "Epic" [...] (from 1989's follow up to Introduce Yourself, The Real Thing). Kiedis stated “I watched [...] “Epic” video, and I see him jumping up and down, rapping, and it looked like I was looking in a mirror. I love The Real Thing, and I liked his vocals on that record. I mean, when I heard the record I noticed subtle similarities, <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> that video it was like, 'Wait a second here, what the fuck?'". The feud between the two was reignited in 1999 when Mr. Bungle was scheduled to release their album California on June 8, 1999 but Warner Bros. Records pushed it back a week so as not to coincide with the Red Hot Chili Peppers similarly titled album, Californication, which was to be released on the same day. Following the album release date clash, Mr. Bungle claimed that Kiedis had them removed from a series of summer festivals in Europe claiming that as the headlining act at the festivals, the Red Hot Chili Peppers had final word on the bands that would appear.|$|E
5000|$|From Nelson, FitzRoy and his {{officials}} {{sailed to}} Waikanae in the North Island, where he conducted a one-man {{inquiry into the}} incident. He opened proceedings by telling a meeting of 500 Māori: [...] "When I first heard of the Wairau massacre ... I was exceedingly angry ... My first thought was to revenge the deaths of my friends, and the other Pākehā who had been killed, and for that purpose to bring many ships of war ... with many soldiers; and had I done so, {{you would have been}} sacrificed and your pa destroyed. <b>But</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> considered, <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> that the Pakeha had in the first instance been very much to blame; and I determined to come down and inquire into all the circumstances and see who was really in the wrong." ...|$|R

2500|$|After {{the release}} of The Real Thing, Faith No More {{developed}} somewhat of a rivalry with fellow Californian funk rock group Red Hot Chili Peppers, whom they had previously played with on The Uplift Mofo Party Tour. Singer Anthony Kiedis accused Mike Patton of stealing his [...] "style" [...] in the [...] "Epic" [...] music video. He told Kerrang! magazine [...] "My drummer says he’s gonna kidnap , shave his hair off and cut off one of his feet, just so he’ll be forced to find a style of his own". In a separate interview, he clarified his comment, remarking [...] "I love The Real Thing, and I liked his vocals on that record. I mean, when I heard the record I noticed subtle similarities, <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> that video it was like, 'Wait a second here, what the fuck?.'" [...] Roddy Bottum responded by saying [...] "To me, our band sounds nothing like Red Hot Chili Peppers. If you're talking about long hair, rapping with his shirt off, then yeah, I can see similarities. But beyond that, I can't see any. I haven't talked to them since this whole thing started. We're really good friends with that band and i'd like to think they're doing it... like as a favour". Mike Patton finally addressed the allegations from Kiedis in 1990, commenting that [...] "It just kind of {{came out of the}} blue. It doesn't bother me a bit. I got a real big kick out of it to tell you the truth. I mean, if he's gonna talk about me in interviews, that's fine - it's free press! Either he's feeling inadequate or old or I don't know, but I have no reason to talk shit about him." [...] Later in 2001, Patton also theorized that [...] "I think Anthony, deep down, feels like I'm a better dancer than he is. I think I shake my booty just a little bit fresher than he does. And if he would stop doing drugs I think he could outdance me. Maybe one day we'll have a breakoff, just breakdance." ...|$|E

5000|$|Erik Skjoldbjærg, the {{director}} of the original film, said of Nolan's reinterpretation: [...] "Well I haven't seen it for quite a while, <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> first <b>saw</b> it was a very strange experience because it was quite close, stylistically, to the original. I felt lucky that it's such a well crafted, smart film and that it had a really good director handling it, because as a remake I think it did really well and it doesn't hurt any original if a remake is well done. So I felt I was lucky that Christopher Nolan took it upon himself to do it." ...|$|R
60|$|Peter had {{at first}} tormented me mercilessly about the affair, <b>but</b> <b>when</b> he <b>saw</b> <b>I</b> {{did not like}} his chaff he stopped it. Peter was always a good fellow.

60|$|His {{eyes were}} bright but crafty, and his {{features}} denoted both sensuality and cruelness. In his youth {{he may have}} been a rather fine looking black, <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> him his appearance was revolting--to me, at least.|$|E
6000|$|... 'It was not that,' said Nell, glancing {{round with}} a slight shudder. 'Indeed I cannot {{tell you what it}} was, <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> the outside, from the church porch, the same feeling came over me. It is its being so old and grey perhaps.' ...|$|E

The plague I am told is in Constantinople, perhaps I have imbibed its effluvia--perhaps disease is the real cause of my prognostications. It matters little why or wherefore I am affected, no power can avert the stroke, and the shadow of Fate's uplifted hand already darkens me.|$|R
500|$|At the {{conclusion}} of the episode, several physicians played a game of baseball to cheer up. Rater called it [...] "her favorite scene", explaining: [...] "I loved the scene where Owen, Derek and Mark take Cristina, Meredith and Lexie to the baseball field. This {{is one of the first}} times Owen has seen Cristina's intensity. And I love that he makes her leave the hospital, focus on something else. That's why he's so good for her. The scene was actually inspired by Shonda saying, let's do a scene where they're all playing baseball. <b>But</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> finally <b>saw</b> it, it makes me want to write more scenes like that, with our doctors outside of the hospital, little glimpses of them in real life." ...|$|R
