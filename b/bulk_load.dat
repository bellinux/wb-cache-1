40|$|<b>Bulk</b> <b>loading</b> {{refers to}} the process of {{creating}} an index from scratch for a given data set. This problem is well understood for B-trees, but so far, non-traditional index structures received modest attention. We are particularly interested in fast generic <b>bulk</b> <b>loading</b> techniques whose implementations only employ a small interface that is satisfied by a broad class of index structures. Generic techniques are very attractive to extensible database systems since different user-implemented index structures implementing that small interface can be bulk-loaded without any modification of the generic code. The main contribution of the paper is the proposal of two new generic and conceptually simple <b>bulk</b> <b>loading</b> algorithms. These algorithms recursively partition the input by using a main-memory index of the same type as the target index to be build. In contrast to previous generic <b>bulk</b> <b>loading</b> algorithms, the implementation of our new algorithms turns out to be much easier. Another advantage is that our new algorithms possess fewer parameters whose settings have to be taken into consideration. An experimental performance comparison is presented where different <b>bulk</b> <b>loading</b> algorithms are investigated in a system-like scenario. Our experiments are unique {{in the sense that we}} examine the same code for different index structures (R-tree and Slim-tree). The results consistently indicate that our new algorithms outperform asymptotically worst-case optimal competitors. Moreover, the search quality of the target index will be better when our new <b>bulk</b> <b>loading</b> algorithms are used. *This work has been supported by grant no. SE 553 / 2 - 1 from DFG...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the issue of}} <b>bulk</b> <b>loading</b> large data sets for the UB-Tree, a multidimensional index structure. Especially in dataware housing (DW), data mining and OLAP {{it is necessary to}} have efficient <b>bulk</b> <b>loading</b> techniques, because loading occurs not continuously, but only from time to time with usually large data sets. We propose two techniques, one for initial loading, which creates a new UB-Tree, and one for incremental loading, which adds data to an existing UB-Tree. Both techniques try to minimize I/O and CPU cost. Measurements with artificial data and data of a commercial data warehouse demonstrate that our algorithms are efficient and able to handle large data sets. As well as the UB-Tree, they are easily integrated into a RDBMS.

The extended finite element method combined with the cyclic cohesive zone model is adopted to model fretting fatigue crack growth behavior.

Crack initiation angle, depth of knee point, crack initiation life, crack propagation life and total life are greater for specimens with residual stress compared to specimens without residual stress.

40|$|Fretting fatigue is a {{mechanical}} failure process, {{which consists of}} two complex failure mechanisms. Fretting is caused by small relative movement between connected parts and fatigue is due to alternating <b>bulk</b> <b>load.</b> Fretting fatigue is highly non-linear and subjected to non-proportional loading condition. The multiaxial nature of stress at contact interface can be highly influenced by different phase difference between axial, tangential and contact load. In this study, the effect of different phase difference between axial and tangential load on fretting fatigue behaviour is investigated. Moreover, by applying cyclic contact load instead of constant contact load, its effect on fretting fatigue response and crack initiation lifetime is investigated. It {{was found that the}} phase difference affects the maximum location of dissipated energy along with fretting fatigue crack initiation lifetime...|$|E

40|$|Detailed {{analysis}} {{of all the}} fretting fatigue test results available in the literature is carried out by employing refined asymptotic solutions. Several different criteria are used and it is shown that two give an improvement over stress-based criteria. These procedures provide a practical method for both designing against fretting fatigue failure and quantifying the nucleation time when fretting is unavoidable. The reduced stiffness method is developed together with the evolutionary algorithm which is the direct implementation of the Signorini and Coulomb friction contact inequalities. This method is capable of solving two dimensional frictional contact problems in significantly less time and is more accurately than a traditional FE approach. In addition, algorithms for determining shakedown limit of coupled contacts have also been developed. A problem of a plane receding contact was considered where a strip is pressed against an elastically similar half-plane by normal pressure extending along the strip surface but stopping short of the end. These phenomena are analysed, together with the behaviour of the system when the pressure is removed. Interfacial characteristics of a lap joint formed using friction grip bolts is also considered as these produce a receding contact. The joints consist of two elastically similar laps pressed in contact by a constant normal force and subject to oscillatory <b>bulk</b> <b>load</b> at the free end of the laps. <b>Bulk</b> <b>load</b> applied at the free ends causes a smooth change {{in the size of}} contact and the development of the slip zones. The trend of energy dissipation with the extent of contact and magnitude of remote tension, at various friction coefficients, has been found. Lastly, axisymmetric receding contact between a circular elastic disc pressed against a half-space has been studied. The disc is first subjected to normal pressure followed by torsion. Normal pressure alone causes a contact interface to separate, if the loaded area is sufficiently small. Torsion is subsequently applied which causes a change in the size of contact and has a significant effect on the direction of the resultant slip displacement and the stick/slip boundaries. </p...|$|E
