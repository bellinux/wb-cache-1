25|$|The Maize Control Board (MCB) {{formed in}} 1947 was {{supposed}} to ensure that Malawi’s maize supplies were maintained and to guarantee minimum prices to farmers. It was given wide powers of control over maize marketing, but as maize could be grown or almost anywhere, its objectives were unattainable with the limited organisation it had. The MCB was hampered by lack of funds; it was reluctant to promote higher maize production for the local market on grounds of cost, and up to 1949 it also discouraged growing for export. To {{cover the cost of}} a country-wide network, the Board fixed a very low <b>buying</b> <b>price</b> and sold maize at double this price. The low prices that the MCB paid in the period 1945-1951 discouraged farmers from growing maize in excess of their own requirements, and inhibited the development of commercial grain markets. By paying the same price in remote areas as in accessible ones and by maintaining price floors in years of surplus, the MCB hoped to create grain reserves. However, as it paid only a penny for two to three pounds of maize against a market price of at least a penny a pound, growers lacked any incentive to produce for it and withheld their surpluses from their market. The quantities of maize available for the home market dropped significantly at a time of growing demand caused by poor harvests in the run up to the major famine in 1949.|$|E

40|$|In English auctions, {{introducing}} a <b>buy</b> <b>price,</b> i. e., the seller’s maximum price bid at which any bidder {{at any time}} can immediately win the auction, allows the seller to gain higher expected utility than that in a traditional auction when either the seller or the buyers are risk-averse.

Under this condition, the expected utilities of uniformly risk-averse buyers with CARA utilities remain {{the same as in}} a traditional auction, and the buy-price and traditional auctions are revenue equivalent when both the seller and the buyers are risk neutral.

40|$|The major {{internet}} auction sites eBay and Yahoo have developed innovative hybrid auction designs that incorporate <b>buy</b> <b>prices.</b> My dissertation {{focuses on the}} Buy It Now (BIN, hereafter) version of the auctions on eBay, the largest online auction site. The BIN hybrid auction combines a standard ascending bid auction with a posted-price offer. A seller in a BIN auction lists his auction with a "buy price". A bidder may purchase the item immediately at the <b>buy</b> <b>price</b> and end the auction. If he places a bid instead, the option to purchase the item at the <b>buy</b> <b>price</b> disappears and the subsequent bidders participate in the standard eBay auction. This auction format has been very popular with both buyers and sellers. In 2005 eBay's sales in fixed price platform (BIN and Half. com) totaled $ 13. 8 billion, which was 33. 1 % of eBay's total sales. The dissertation explores the BIN auctions using theory, experiments and field data. Chapter 1 theoretically analyzes BIN auctions within the common values framework. An equilibrium is characterized, shown to exist, and the revenues generated by BIN and standard eBay auctions are compared. Chapter 2 compares the bidding behavior and the revenue implications of BIN auctions in lab experiments under common and private value assumptions. The third develops an "incomplete" theoretical model of BIN auctions within the private values framework. An "incomplete" empirical specification is derived and then field data collected from eBay's BIN auctions are used to estimate the primitives of the model, including the bidders' risk aversion and time preference. I then explore how heterogeneity of sellers and items influence these primitives. Chapter 1 (Common Values Auctions with a Buy Price: the case of eBay) : Several explanations for the popularity of <b>buy</b> <b>price</b> have been provided for independent private value auctions. Risk aversion and impatience of either the bidders or the seller have mainly been used to explain the popularity of <b>buy</b> <b>prices</b> in IPV models. This paper, using a pure common value framework, models auctions with eBay-style "temporary" <b>buy</b> <b>prices,</b> when the bidders and the seller are either risk neutral or risk averse. It characterizes equilibrium bidding strategies in a general setup and then analyzes a seller's incentive to post a <b>buy</b> <b>price</b> when there are two bidders. When bidders are either risk neutral or risk averse there is no incentive to post a <b>buy</b> <b>price</b> for a risk neutral seller. But when the seller is risk averse, a suitably chosen <b>buy</b> <b>price</b> can raise the seller's expected utility when the bidders are either risk neutral or risk averse. Chapter 2 (An Experimental Study of Auctions with a <b>Buy</b> <b>Price</b> Under Private and Common Values) : We use experiments to examine several predictions from the theoretical studies of <b>buy</b> <b>prices.</b> The theoretical predictions from Wooders and Reynolds (2003) and Chapter 1 show that {{the introduction of a}} <b>buy</b> <b>price</b> causes the seller's revenue to move in opposite directions in private value and common value settings. Meanwhile, Mathews and Katzman (2006) find that risk averse sellers might find <b>buy</b> <b>prices</b> advantageous because they reduce the variance in seller revenue in eBay auctions with risk-neutral bidders. The lab experiments are used to answer three key questions. (a) Can a <b>buy</b> <b>price</b> raise seller revenue and lower the variance of seller revenue in an independent private value auction? (b) Does a <b>buy</b> <b>price</b> lower seller revenue in common value auctions? (c) If the theoretical predictions do not hold, can a behavioral model explain the patterns observed in the data? Using a between-subjects design the results show that the use of a <b>buy</b> <b>price</b> has a positive and statistically significant effect on seller revenue in private value auctions. The buyers are risk averse. The estimate of the Constant Absolute Risk Aversion (CARA) index of 1. 11 for the bidders is equivalent to a Constant Relative Risk Aversion (CRRA) index of 0. 62 which is centered within the range of other estimates of relative risk aversion. As predicted by the theory when buyers are risk averse, the use of a <b>buy</b> <b>price</b> yields a statistically significant reduction in the variance of seller revenue. Hence, as predicted, the use of a <b>buy</b> <b>price</b> is advantageous to the seller when either the bidders or the seller are risk averse. The results for common value auctions are inconsistent with the theoretical predictions. Use of a <b>buy</b> <b>price</b> did not lower seller revenue, and the bidders' behavior departed from theoretical predictions in several respects. As a result, we develop and estimate a behavioral model of common value BIN auctions based on the winner's curse and overweighting of a bidder's private information. We find statistically significant evidence of overweighting of the bidder's own signal and estimated a CARA index of 0. 001. This behavioral model explains all the departures from the rational model we found in the common values experiments. Chapter 3 (The Buy-it-now Option, Risk Aversion, and Impatience in an Empirical Model of eBay Bidding) : Haile and Tamer (2003) first used an incomplete econometric model in an auction context, assuming that bidders bid up to their values and do not allow an opponent to win at a price they are willing to beat. Canals-Cerda and Pearcy (2004) used a similar incomplete econometric model to study eBay auctions while adding the assumption that the maximum of all the bids placed by the bidder with the second highest value is exactly equal to his value. Chapter 3 extends these incomplete models to eBay's BIN auctions. We develop and estimate an equilibrium model for BIN independent private value auctions with a stochastic and unknown number of potential bidders who enter the auction sequentially. In the model risk averse and time impatient bidders buy at the BIN price because it allows them to avoid the uncertainties and delay of the ascending bid auction that takes place if no one chooses the BIN option. As a result, the bidders' decisions to choose the BIN option in BIN auctions of different lengths can be used to identify the bidders' risk aversion and time preference parameters. Our model is "incomplete" {{in the sense that we}} do not impose any stylized structure on bidding in the ascending bid auction and, although bid revision is allowed, the process is not explicitly described. Our "incomplete" econometric model uses a partial likelihood approach proposed by Cox (1975) that allows the analysis to bypass modeling bidding and the bid revision process. The model is estimated using a new data set of 3245 eBay auctions of Pentium- 3 laptops that ran between 22 July to 10 August 2005...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{contains a}} series of theoretical investigations of auction markets. The essays it contains cover wholesale electricity markets, a popular selling mechanism on eBay, and supplier entry into multi-unit procurement auctions. The study in Chapter 1 compares the procurement cost-minimizing and productive efficiency performance of the auction mechanism used by independent system operators in wholesale electricity auction markets in the U. S. {{with that of a}} proposed alternative. The current practice allocates energy contracts as if the auction featured a discriminatory final payment method when, in fact, the markets are uniform price auctions. The proposed alternative explicitly accounts for the market-clearing price during the allocation phase. We find that the proposed alternative largely outperforms the current practice on the basis of procurement costs in the context of simple auction markets featuring both day-ahead and real-time auctions and that the procurement cost advantage of the alternative is complete when we simulate the effects of increased competition. We also find that a tradeoff between the objectives of procurement cost minimization and productive efficiency emerges in our simple auction markets and persists in the face of increased competition. ^ The study in Chapter 2 considers a possible rationale for an auction with a <b>buy</b> <b>price.</b> In an auction with a <b>buy</b> <b>price,</b> the seller provides bidders with an option to end the auction early by accepting a transaction at a posted price. The 2 ̆ 2 Buy-It-Now 2 ̆ 2 option on eBay is a leading example of an auction with a <b>buy</b> <b>price.</b> The study develops a model of an auction with a <b>buy</b> <b>price</b> in which bidders use the auction 2 ̆ 7 s reserve <b>price</b> and <b>buy</b> <b>price</b> to formulate a reference price. The model both explains why a revenue-maximizing seller would want to augment her auction with a <b>buy</b> <b>price</b> and demonstrates that the seller sets a higher reserve price when she can affect the bidders 2 ̆ 7 reference price through the auction 2 ̆ 7 s reserve <b>price</b> and <b>buy</b> <b>price</b> than when she can affect the bidders 2 ̆ 7 reference price through the auction 2 ̆ 7 s reserve price only. Introducing a small reference-price effect can shrink the range of <b>buy</b> <b>prices</b> bidders are willing to exercise. The comparative statics properties of bidding behavior are in sharp contrast to equilibrium behavior in other models where the existence and size of the auction 2 ̆ 7 s <b>buy</b> <b>price</b> have no effect on bidding behavior. ^ The study in Chapter 3 investigates endogenous entry in multi-unit auctions. We formulate and study models of multi-unit discriminatory and uniform price auctions and investigate the entry incentives and procurement costs they generate in equilibrium. We study two types of endogenous entry: in auctions with 2 ̆ 2 interim entry costs, 2 ̆ 2 suppliers know their private cost information before deciding whether or not to undertake entry; in auctions with ex ante entry costs, suppliers do not know their private cost information before deciding whether or not to enter. The discriminatory and uniform price auctions are efficient and procurement cost equivalent in all the environments we study. With interim entry costs, the two auctions provide identical entry incentives. In contrast, with ex ante entry costs, suppliers enter the discriminatory auction at a higher rate than they enter the uniform price auction. ...|$|R
