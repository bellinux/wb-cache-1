40|$|Abstract. A <b>benefit</b> <b>transfer</b> {{approach}} to recreation economic valuation using meta-analysis is examined. Since the meta- regression model {{takes into account}} some of the study specific effects on willingness to pay (WTP) estimates, <b>benefit</b> <b>transfer</b> using meta-analysis could yield a valid WTP estimate of unstudied recreation resources. The convergent validity of the meta-analytic <b>benefit</b> <b>transfer</b> is tested using out-of-sample original studies from the U. S. The analyses are performed using percentage difference, paired t-test, regression and correlation tests. The tests reveal mixed results on convergence between estimated WTP using meta-analytic <b>benefit</b> <b>transfer</b> function (BTF) and out-of-sample original WTP values. There is a fairly high percentage difference between the estimated and original WTP values (80 – 88 %), and the mean differences are statistically significant as shown by paired t-tests. However, correlation and regression results consistently show significant positive relationships between national BTF estimated and original WTP values indicating some level of convergence.

40|$|<b>Benefit</b> <b>transfer</b> entails using {{estimates}} of non-market values derived at one site as approximations to benefits at other sites. The method finds favour {{because it can}} be applied quickly and cheaply, however the validity of <b>benefit</b> <b>transfer</b> is frequently questioned. Published studies generally indicate that errors from the approach can be extremely large and could result in significant resource misallocations. Assessing the validity of <b>benefit</b> <b>transfer</b> is complicated by differences in the nature of study and policy sites, the changes being valued, valuation methods, time of study, availability of substitutes and complements, and demographic, social and cultural differences. A choice experiment was used to evaluate the transferability of benefit estimates for identical goods between two different populations. The study design allowed most of the confounding factors to be controlled, so provides a strong test of <b>benefit</b> <b>transfer</b> validity.
