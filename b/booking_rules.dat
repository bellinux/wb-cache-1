40|$|Environmental impacts {{are caused}} the by {{consumption}} {{of material and}} energy or the release of emissions. They can be reduced by optimizing corporate material and energy flows based {{on the principles of}} eco-efficiency management. The basis for this is a higher transparency on corporate material flows. It can be reached by setting up an environmental controlling. The most practicable instrument within environmental controlling is the application of Environmental Performance Indicators (EPI). They can be used to efficiently monitor and control material and energy efficiently on a continuous basis. In the presented dissertation, a procedure model is described for the introduction of an integrative environmental controlling and the development of the required information supply using an Enterprise Resource Planning System (ERP System). The development of the EPI system’s information supply uses the ERP System as an information source and as a basis to implement the IT support of the EPI system. The material master data in the ERP System is enhanced by an EPI key. Booking locations (cost center groups, cost centers or storage locations) are attributed to EPIs. Existing material bookings are classified according to their movement type and are attributed to the respective EPIs with <b>booking</b> <b>rules.</b> The material bookings goods receipt/good issue, confirmed production order, overhead order, capital spending order, and inventory difference adjustment are used. Information not available in the ERP System is identified in other information systems and imported into the ERP System. Additional data required is acquired separately. Finally, an IT support for the EPI system is implemented using functionalities in the ERP System to administrate corporate performance indicators. The practical implementation of the procedure model is described based on its application with two industrial companies. In both cases, the ERP System SAP R/ 3 by SAP AG was used. It was shown that the developed EPI System supplies structured information on corporate material flows and increases the transparency on material and enegry flows in the company. Thus, a basis for the systematic reduction of material and energy consumption and the emission of pollutants was created. The achieved solution also serves to give account to stakeholders customers, shareholders, employees and public authorities. Internal reports (to inform cost center responsibles or employees) as well as external reports (e. g. on CO 2 or VOC emissions or on the consumption of substances containing heavy metals) can be generated more easily...|$|E
40|$|Although {{the free}} {{movement}} of persons (or more precisely of employees and their families) {{is considered to be}} one of the major pillars of the EU's internal market, there still isn't real pension portability. This has to do with the characteristics of a quilt (or patchwork) the different member-states of the EU form in the area of pension schemes. Considering the differences with regard to - the rules of affiliation : obligatory, voluntary, mixed, sectoral, [...] .; - the level of organization: national, industry-wide, enterprise or individual; - the actors such as pension funds, insurers, banks or mutual funds, [...] .; - the <b>booking</b> <b>rules</b> and their evolution towards the IAAS norms; - the level of coverage: going from nearly 100 % of the population to nearly 0 % of the population; - the diversity in fiscal treatment of occupational pensions in the different stages (going from EEE (exemption, exemption, exemption) to TTT (taxation, taxation taxation), regardless the Commission's idea of the EET model; - the prudential control: going from the prudent man principle to the strict state supervision; - the level of participation of the employees: managing, voting right, supervising, [...] . - the risk bearing with regard to the shift from Defined Benefit to Defined Contribution, the idea of a legally binding minimum return guarantee in DC plans, the longevity risk, the obsolete mortality tables in quite a lot European countries, [...] .; - the cost structure: from strictly regulated to no rules; - the financing techniques: repartition, capitalization, closed or open capitalization, mixed systems, [...] .; - the role of the government: organizing, controlling, managing, regulating, [...] .; - [...] . Bearing all these differences in mind and knowing that the social aspects of pensions are still a national prerogative, it is clear that coordination of occupational pensions towards a unified pension portability platform is a burdensome task. Not only the limited scope of the 1998 directive is already a clear indication, but also the different national strategy reports laid in September 2002 point in that direction. Furthermore the Commission's first evaluation of national strategies for adequate and sustainable pensions of the 17 th of December 2002 gives little to none options for fast solutions. We have to look elsewhere. Currently there are two major paths: 1. What can we expect from the European Court of Justice after the Danner case, knowing that the PEPGO test case is going full steam ahead ? 2. What can we expect from the so called "Bolkenstein directive" ? I believe both options are rather slim. Fiscally, the theory on the national coherency still stands and prudentially, some countries have smartly seen their way out of the directive. So the question we have to ask is the following: can the method of open coordination form a solution towards the pension portability problem ? Legally, I consider open coordination not to be an option when it comes to solving the portability question. Politically however, it might be a first step towards the right direction. However I strongly believe the anglo-saxon occupational pension model is taking the overhand in continental European. This makes me believe that we have to start broadening the social competences of the EU within the EU. Apart from looking at the fiscal, financial, prudential and competition elements in the debate on portability the social aspects should be taken into consideration. These aspects are not a mere consequence or subsidiary of the other elements. Things are often presented otherwise. We should recognize that the portability of occupational pensions form an element in the social pension problem of the net replacement income ratio for the future elder in Europe. By recognizing that occupational pensions have an imminent social goal: bringing insured welfare to ALL pensioners in Europe, we can move ahead. Improving the private market for pension providers or installing a fiscal uniformity within the EU should therefore not be a goal on its own, but a derivative of social policy.

40|$|AIM—To compare three {{different}} strategies for determining admission dates for patients awaiting cataract extraction after scoring for visual impairment.  METHODS— 357 patients attending for assessment for cataract surgery were scored for visual impairment. These scores {{were used as}} a basis for ranking patients into three impairment strata. A computer simulation was used to compare 3  years' operation of different admission strategies—a first come first served booking system, a triage booking system, and a waiting list system in which admissions were strictly ordered according to priority stratum. Differences in priority weighted delays before treatment were analysed.  RESULTS—Both the triage system and the priority based waiting list system gave considerable reduction in priority weighted delay compared with a first come first served admission policy. The percentage reduction achieved (30 %- 60 %) is strongly influenced by the number of weeks fully booked when the booking systems are introduced. The priority weighted delay of the triage system, where booking decisions were made {{at the time of the}} outpatient assessment, was consistently and substantially outperformed by the priority based waiting list system where the decision to allocate an admission date was delayed as long as possible.  CONCLUSIONS—There is considerable scope for reducing delays to high priority patients if simple rules are used to determine admission dates. Using these <b>rules,</b> <b>booking</b> patients at the time of the outpatient assessment gives substantially less benefit in terms of reducing delays to high priority patients than if the decision about the admission date is deferred. ...|$|R
