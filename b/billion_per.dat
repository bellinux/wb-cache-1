5|$|The {{economic}} impact of the common cold is not well understood in much of the world. In the United States, the common cold leads to 75–100 million physician visits annually at a conservative cost estimate of $7.7 <b>billion</b> <b>per</b> year. Americans spend $2.9 billion on over-the-counter drugs and another $400 million on prescription medicines for symptom relief. More than one-third of people who saw a doctor received an antibiotic prescription, which has implications for antibiotic resistance. An estimated 22–189 million school days are missed annually due to a cold. As a result, parents missed 126 million workdays to stay home to care for their children. When added to the 150 million workdays missed by employees suffering from a cold, the total {{economic impact}} of cold-related work loss exceeds $20 <b>billion</b> <b>per</b> year. This accounts for 40% of time lost from work in the United States.|$|E

5|$|An {{estimated}} 13 {{million people}} went whale watching globally in 2008, in all oceans except the Arctic. Rules and {{codes of conduct}} have been created to minimize harassment of the whales. Iceland, Japan and Norway have both whaling and whale watching industries. Whale watching lobbyists {{are concerned that the}} most inquisitive whales, which approach boats closely and provide much of the entertainment on whale-watching trips, {{will be the first to}} be taken if whaling is resumed in the same areas. Whale watching generated US$2.1 billion (UK£1.4 <b>billion)</b> <b>per</b> annum in tourism revenue worldwide, employing around 13,000 workers. In contrast, the whaling industry, with the moratorium in place, generates US$31 million (UK£20 million) per year. The size and rapid growth of the industry has led to complex and continuing debates with the whaling industry about the best use of whales as a natural resource.|$|E
5|$|Water {{supply and}} {{sanitation}} in Turkey is characterised by achievements and challenges. Over the past decades access to drinking water {{has become almost}} universal and access to adequate sanitation has also increased substantially. Autonomous utilities have been created in the 16 metropolitan cities of Turkey and cost recovery has been increased, thus providing {{the basis for the}} sustainability of service provision. Intermittent supply, which was common in many cities, has become less frequent. In 2004, 61% of the wastewater collected through sewers was being treated. Remaining challenges include the need to further increase wastewater treatment, to reduce the high level of non-revenue water hovering around 50% and to expand access to adequate sanitation in rural areas. The investment required to comply with EU standards in the sector, especially in wastewater treatment, is estimated to be in the order of €2 <b>billion</b> <b>per</b> year, more than double the current level of investment.|$|E

However, most of the economic costs would come in indirect forms, such as delays in trade routes. One estimate predicts the effect due to reduced trade to be a drop of 0.8% in overall economic output, a loss of €110 billion by 2025, representing a 10-20% decrease in trade between Schengen countries. For example, in France the GDP would be lowered by 0.5% compared to 2015, a cumulative loss of about €10 billion. Other estimated costs include up to €5.2 <b>billion</b> <b>per</b> year for commuters and other travelers, €7.5 <b>billion</b> <b>per</b> year for waiting time for trucks at borders, and €20 <b>billion</b> <b>per</b> year in losses for the European tourism industry.|$|E
