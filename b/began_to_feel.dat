5|$|I {{realized}} {{that for a}} long time I had been holding onto this whole dogma of nonracism almost like a religion... But in the course of that debate I <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> there was a lot lacking in the proponents of the nonracist idea... they had this problem, you know, of superiority, and they tended to take us for granted and wanted us to accept things that were second-class. They could not see why we could not consider staying in that church, and I <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> that our understanding of our own situation in this country was not coincidental with that of these liberal whites.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the twentieth century, the different ethnic groups of the Dutch East Indies– modern day Indonesia– <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> a sense of national unity, as eventually formulated in the 1928 Youth Pledge. These native groups founded political parties to further their goals and represent their political ideologies, including the Indonesian Communist Party and Indonesian National Party.|$|E

As resistance attacks against them escalated, collaborationist parties became more violent and launched reprisals against civilians, including the Courcelles Massacre in August 1944.|$|E

5|$|After {{months of}} not {{working on the}} poem, Eliot <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> {{compelled}} to finish it; {{it was not until}} August 1942, however, that he started working on it again. In total, there were five drafts. The poem was finished by 19 September 1942 and published in the October New English Weekly. Little Gidding was intended to conclude the Four Quartets series, summarising Eliot's views expressed in this series of poems.|$|E
5|$|After the diagnosis, Ryan White was too ill {{to return}} to school, but by early 1985 he <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> better. His mother {{asked if he could}} return to school, but was told by school {{officials}} that he could not. On June 30, 1985, a formal request to permit re-admittance to school was denied by Western School Corporation superintendent James O. Smith, sparking an administrative appeal process that lasted for eight months.|$|E
30|$|The survey {{asked about}} participants’ {{propensity}} to seek treatment after feeling ill. Specifically, the questionnaire asked “When you are ill you usually seek medical assistance,” and participants indicated “immediately”, “the next day”, 2 – 3  days after <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> ill”, “ 4 – 7  days after <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> ill”, “only after 1  week”, or “never”.|$|R

5|$|Beginning {{around the}} year 350 BC, the {{senators}} and the plebeian tribunes began to grow closer. The Senate began giving tribunes more power, and the tribunes <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> indebted to the Senate. As the tribunes and the senators grew closer, plebeian senators began to routinely secure the office of tribune for {{members of their own}} families. Also, this period saw the enacting of the plebiscitum Ovinium, which transferred the power to appoint new senators from the consuls to the censors. This law also required the censors to appoint any newly elected magistrate to the Senate, which probably resulted in {{a significant increase in the}} number of plebeian senators.|$|E
5|$|By mid-February the {{symptoms}} of those involved were deteriorating; their symptoms included burn wounds, swollen hands, diarrhoea, fever, and hair loss. One of the scrap collectors went to Samut Prakan Hospital on 15 February and was admitted the next day, while the two scrapyard employees were also admitted, on 16 and 17 February. The scrapyard owner's husband was admitted to Bangkok General Hospital on 17 February due to epistaxis (nosebleeds), while the scrapyard owner, her mother, and her maid (all of whom {{lived across the street}} from the scrapyard and sometimes entered) also <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> ill. A stray dog that was often seen in the scrapyard also died.|$|E
5|$|He <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> pain in {{his lower}} back shortly {{after the end of}} his junior season. In May 2011, while {{attending}} a basketball camp at the Deron Williams Academy in Chicago, Arcidiacono complained of poor mobility and soreness. He was diagnosed with a herniated disk in his back, forcing him to miss his senior season. Arcidiacono had surgery to repair the disk on December 21, and he could not leave his house for two weeks thereafter. Arcidiacono finished his career at Neshaminy High School as the program's all-time leading scorer. He tallied 1,498 points, 449 rebounds, 378 assists, 178 steals, and 160 three-pointers. Despite missing the season, ESPNU ranked him among the top 50 seniors in the country.|$|E

5|$|In {{the middle}} of 1864 the Beetons again visited the Goubauds in Paris—the couple's third visit to the city—and Isabella was {{pregnant}} during the visit, {{just as she had}} been the previous year. On her return to Britain she began working on an abridged version of the Book of Household Management , which was to be titled The Dictionary of Every-Day Cookery. On 29 January 1865, while working on the proofs of the dictionary, she went into labour; the baby—Mayson Moss—was born that day. Isabella <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> feverish the following day and died of puerperal fever on 6 February at the age of 28.|$|E
5|$|Plymouth Colony {{was founded}} {{by a group of}} English Puritans who later {{came to be known as}} the Pilgrims. The core group (roughly 40% of the adults and 56% of the family groupings) were part of a {{congregation}} led by William Bradford. They <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> the pressures of religious persecution while still in the English village of Scrooby, near East Retford, Nottinghamshire. In 1607, Archbishop Tobias Matthew raided homes and imprisoned several members of the congregation. The congregation left England in 1609 and emigrated to the Netherlands, settling first in Amsterdam and then in Leiden.|$|E
5|$|That same day, {{the four}} men present when the {{cylinder}} was opened (two of the scrap collectors and two scrapyard employees) <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> ill, experiencing headaches, nausea and vomiting. The scrap collectors succeeded in taking the lead cylinder apart, and took the parts to sell at the scrapyard the next day. The scrapyard employees continued to feel sick during the following week, and on 12 February the scrapyard owner, believing the metal to be causing the illness, asked the scrap collector to take it elsewhere, and had the two smaller metal pieces thrown away.|$|E

5|$|After the consulship {{had been}} {{opened to the}} plebeians, the plebeians were able to hold both the {{dictatorship}} and the censorship. Plebiscites of 342 BC placed limits on political offices; an individual could hold only one office at a time, and ten years must elapse {{between the end of}} his official term and his re-election. Further laws attempted to relieve the burden of debt from plebeians by banning interest on loans. In 337 BC, the first plebeian praetor was elected. During these years, the tribunes and the senators grew increasingly close. The senate realised the need to use plebeian officials to accomplish desired goals. To win over the tribunes, the senators gave the tribunes a great deal of power and the tribunes <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> obligated to the senate. As the tribunes and the senators grew closer, plebeian senators were often able to secure the tribunate for members of their own families. In time, the tribunate became a stepping stone to higher office.|$|E
5|$|In {{the other}} races of the 1935 season, Caracciola won the Eifelrennen at the Nürburgring and {{finished}} second at the Penya Rhin Grand Prix in Barcelona. He {{also won the}} Tripoli Grand Prix, organised by the Libyan Governor-General Italo Balbo. The Grand Prix {{was held in the}} desert, around a salt lake, and because of the intense heat Neubauer was concerned that the tyres on the Mercedes-Benz cars would not last. Caracciola started poorly, but moved to third, after four pit stops to change tyres, by lap30 of 40. He inherited the lead from Nuvolari and Varzi when the two Italians pitted, and held it to the finish, despite a late charge from Varzi. Caracciola later wrote that this was the race where he <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> he had recovered from his crash in Monaco two years before, and he was now back among the contenders.|$|E
5|$|Kikuta {{was born}} in Aichi Prefecture, Japan. He first became {{interested}} in music {{at the age of}} ten after hearing songs by Emerson, Lake & Palmer. He began writing his own songs two years later, after listening to country blues music; it inspired him to study acoustic guitar and write his own songs in hope of one day becoming a singer/songwriter. He was also inspired as a child by music from movies. It was not until he got a synthesizer, however, that he <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> his potential as a composer. Kikuta went on to earn an interdisciplinary degree in Religious Studies, Philosophy, and Cultural Anthropology from Kansai University, which he attended from 1981 to 1984. He never received any form of formal musical training, and instead taught himself by reading music theory books and listening {{to a wide variety of}} musical genres.|$|E

5|$|In 1982, Waters {{suggested}} a new musical project with the working title Spare Bricks, originally conceived as the soundtrack album for Pink Floyd – The Wall. With {{the onset of}} the Falklands War, Waters changed direction and began writing new material. He saw Margaret Thatcher's response to the invasion of the Falklands as jingoistic and unnecessary, and dedicated the album to his late father. Immediately arguments arose between Waters and Gilmour, who felt that the album should include all new material, rather than recycle songs passed over for The Wall. Waters felt that Gilmour had contributed little to the band's lyrical repertoire. Michael Kamen, a contributor to the orchestral arrangements of The Wall, mediated between the two, also performing the role traditionally occupied by the then-absent Wright. The tension within the band grew. Waters and Gilmour worked independently; however, Gilmour <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> the strain, sometimes barely maintaining his composure. After a final confrontation, Gilmour's name disappeared from the credit list, reflecting what Waters felt was his lack of songwriting contributions.|$|E
5|$|Malmö FF's move to Malmö IP {{occurred}} {{during the second half}} of the 1999 Allsvenskan. It soon became apparent to the club that Malmö IP was too small, and lacked the safety facilities that Malmö Stadion offered. When Malmö FF were relegated to the second tier of Swedish football at the end of the 1999 season, the club board decided to move the team back to Malmö Stadion before the next season started. IFK Malmö, however stayed at Malmö IP. After Malmö FF were promoted back to Allsvenskan after one season in the second division, Superettan, the average attendance began to rise. Malmö FF's average crowd during the 2001 Allsvenskan season was 11,315; it was the first time since the 1970s that the club had drawn an average crowd of more than 10,000 spectators. Average attendances then increased year on year as Malmö FF experienced a successful period. In the 2004 Allsvenskan season, as Malmö FF won their first Swedish championship since 1988, the team also set a new club record for attendances over a season, with an average of 20,061 spectators watching Malmö FF matches. Around this time, both club and fans <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> that Malmö Stadion had served it purpose, as the ageing stadium began to deteriorate. Some fans also expressed their discontent with the distance between the pitch and the stands, necessitated by the running tracks surrounding the playing area.|$|E
5|$|Some {{academics}} {{suggest that}} the insurgency in Kashmir is at least partly {{a result of the}} manner in which it was integrated into India. Kashmir, uniquely amongst princely states, was not required to sign either a Merger Agreement or a revised Instrument of Accession giving India control over a larger number of issues than the three originally provided for. Instead, the power to make laws relating to Kashmir was granted to the Government of India by Article 5 of the Constitution of Jammu and Kashmir and was, under Article 370 of the Constitution of India, somewhat more restricted than in relation to other states. Widmalm argues that during the 1980s, a number of Kashmiri youth <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> that the Indian government was increasingly interfering in the politics of Jammu and Kashmir. The elections of 1987 caused them to lose faith in the political process and begin the violent insurgency which is still ongoing. Similarly, Ganguly suggests that the policies of the Indian government towards Kashmir meant that the state, unlike other parts of India, never developed the solid political institutions associated with a modern multi-ethnic democracy. As a result, the growing dissatisfaction with the status quo felt by an increasingly politically aware youth was expressed through non-political channels which Pakistan, seeking to weaken India's hold over Kashmir, transformed into an active insurgency.|$|E
