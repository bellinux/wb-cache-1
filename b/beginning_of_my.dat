In retrospect, {{he has said that}} this represented his [...] "real entry into the world of politics and the <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> second career as a public servant."

500|$|Bizet's {{next major}} {{assignment}} came from Carvalho, {{who was now}} managing Paris' Vaudeville theatre and wanted incidental music for Alphonse Daudet's play L'Arlésienne. When the play opened on 1 October, the music was dismissed by critics as too complex for popular taste. However, encouraged by Reyer and Massenet, Bizet fashioned a four-movement suite from the music, which was performed under Pasdeloup on 10 November to an enthusiastic reception. In the winter of 1872–73, Bizet supervised preparations for {{a revival of the}} still-absent Gounod's Roméo et Juliette at the Opéra-Comique. Relations between the two had been cool for some years, but Bizet responded positively to his former mentor's request for help, writing: [...] "You were the <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> life as an artist. I spring from you".|$|E
500|$|McCormack {{was born}} in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, the son of Doris (1932–2006), a homemaker, and Keith McCormack, an oil company {{financial}} analyst who died from cancer in 2008. [...] He is the oldest of three siblings. McCormack has Scottish ancestry. McCormack states while he was growing up, he was shy and did not play sports. McCormack attended Stephen Leacock Collegiate Institute High School in Scarborough, Ontario. There, he enrolled in theatre and performed in high school productions of Godspell and Pippin, and decided {{to pursue a career}} in acting. McCormack recalls after performing in Godspell, his feelings towards becoming an actor solidified. [...] "...I remember after the first performance of that... I knew where to fit in. That was the <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> life as an actor. It changed me in that the concept of any other options disappeared. From that moment there was no question. I knew exactly what I was going to do. I'm lucky that way." [...] He admits that he never felt cool growing up. [...] "I was a bit of an outsider, but I discovered theatre very early on, which got me through." [...] He then transferred to Sir John A. Macdonald Collegiate Institute in Scarborough, where he went to school with David Furnish. He graduated in 1982.|$|E

500|$|Following {{the release}} of the album, Madonna was {{dismissed}} by some critics. They called her voice sounding as [...] "Minnie Mouse on helium", while the other detractors suggested that she was [...] "almost entirely helium, a gas-filled, lighter-than-air creation of MTV and other sinister media packagers." [...] Madonna said: [...] "From the very <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> career, people have been writing shit about me and saying, 'She's a one-hit wonder, she'll disappear after a year'." [...] She responded to the comment [...] "Minnie Mouse on helium" [...] by doing a photoshoot with Alberto Tolot, where she flirted with a giant Mickey Mouse toy, putting its hand inside her dress and looking at it with an admonishing glare. Author Debbi Voller noted that [...] "such provocative imagery at a young age of her career, could have hurt her too much. But it went on to shut those twerps who dared to take a swag at her voice again." [...] Twenty-five years later, in her acceptance speech of Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction, Madonna thanked the critics who snubbed her in the early years, [...] "The ones that said I was talentless, that I was chubby, that I couldn't sing, that I was a one-hit wonder. They pushed me to be better, and I am grateful for their resistance." ...|$|E
500|$|As {{executive}} producer, Price {{was responsible}} for [...] "shaping the album's sound", deciding its track listing, and mixing the songs {{in order to ensure}} that they [...] "feel like they're part of the same album". Popjustice commented that every song on the album has [...] "gone through a bit of a Stuart Price filter so that it doesn't sound like some dickhead [...] A has just aimlessly scooped a load of tracks off a shelf". Aphrodite marked the first time Minogue enlisted an executive producer; discussing the process, she said [...] "It was just the best experience, and funnily enough I think it's the most cohesive album I've had since the <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> career, back in the PWL days, where by its very nature made it cohesive. There's a lot to be said for working with different producers and trying different stuff which has worked really well for me in the past but I definitely wanted someone to tie this together as Stuart has done so beautifully [...] so that it existed as a real body of work". Minogue and Price subjected songs on Aphrodite to a [...] "Parton Test", as they [...] "knew a song would work if it made sense when sung in the style of Dolly Parton". Shears also contributed to the album, while two of Pallot's collaborations with Minogue were kept. Additional collaborators on the album include Scottish disc jockey Calvin Harris, Swedish disc jockey Sebastian Ingrosso and Belgian musician Pascal Gabriel.|$|E
500|$|As {{his tenure}} with VA-174 was ending, McCain was {{assigned}} to a low-profile desk job within the Naval Air Systems Command. Chief of Naval Operations Admiral James L. Holloway III thought this assignment a waste of McCain's social talents, and instead in July 1977 McCain {{was appointed to the}} Senate Liaison Office within the Navy's Office of Legislative Affairs (an assignment Jack McCain had once held). The office's role mostly consisted of providing constituent service and acting as a facilitator among legislators, the Department of Defense, and lobbyists. McCain later said the liaison job represented [...] " [...] real entry into the world of politics and the <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> second career as a public servant". McCain's lively personality and knowledge of military matters made his post in the Russell Senate Office Building a popular gathering spot for senators and staff. He also frequently escorted congressional delegations on overseas trips, where he arranged entertaining side escapades. McCain was influenced by senators of both parties, and formed an especially strong bond with John Tower of Texas, the ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. During 1978 and 1979, McCain played a key behind-the-scenes role in gaining congressional funding for a new supercarrier against the wishes of the Carter administration and Navy Secretary W. Graham Claytor Jr. In August 1979, McCain was promoted to naval captain, and became Director of the Senate Liaison Office. [...] During McCain's time there, the Senate Liaison Office enjoyed one of its few periods of high influence.|$|E

500|$|Sandy George from Australian Screen Online {{said that}} Vidler's long {{career as an}} actor helped him [...] "draw the terrific performances" [...] from the film's young actors. 17-year-old Laurence Breuls was {{literally}} {{the first person to}} audition for the role of Jared. Hundred of others auditioned though Breuls remained the favourite choice. Vidler chose Simon Lyndon, who played the role of Jared in the original stage production of Blackrock, for the role of Ricko, stating that Lyndon had the looks, charisma, and complexity to play the role. Rebecca Smart, who also portrayed Cherie in the original stage production, was the only person to reprise their role from the play. Blackrock is often considered to be Heath Ledger's debut film, but he had an uncredited minor role in the 1991 film Clowning Around. While Ledger's role in Blackrock is small, it is credited with garnering him attention in Australia, leading to more prominent acting roles. 15-year-old Bojana Novakovic was given the role of Tracy partly because she was a competitive gymnast and was considered mentally and physically strong enough to film the rape scene. Vidler discussed the role with her parents before filming commenced, who despite initial reservations, eventually gave permission for her to film the scene. Novakovic said the experience was traumatic and she began to tremble uncontrollably once the shoot ended, though recovered shortly afterwards, concluding, [...] "In a way, I feel lucky to have had such a role at the <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> career. I don't think I'll ever be scared by an emotional scene again." [...] The boys involved in the scene showed up at her door the following day and gave her a bunch of flowers and a T-shirt that said [...] "shit happens". Vidler said he found the performance so powerful that when he first watched the rushes of the scene alone, he burst into tears.|$|E
