5|$|Although the weapon's {{designers}} {{thought that}} simply bringing {{a critical mass}} together would <b>be</b> <b>sufficient,</b> Serber suggested that the design should also include an initiator.

Oppenheimer requested that it also be manufactured in the X-10 Graphite Reactor at Oak Ridge, Tennessee or, when they became available, the reactors at the Hanford Site.|$|E
5|$|At {{a conference}} in September 1906, many of the {{disagreements}} over the ship's design were resolved. The Naval Constructor, von Eickstedt, argued that since the explosive trials for the proposed protection systems for the new battlecruiser had not been completed, the construction should be postponed, to allow for any alterations to the design. He also argued that guns of 21cm(8.3in) or 24cm(9.4in) caliber would <b>be</b> <b>sufficient</b> to penetrate the armor of the new British battlecruisers. However, Admiral August von Heeringen, of the General Navy Department, stated that for the ship {{to be able to}} engage battleships, the 28cm(11in) caliber guns were necessary.|$|E
5|$|Chess {{players and}} theoreticians have long debated whether, given perfect play by both sides, the game should {{end in a}} win for White, or a draw.

However, a few notable players have argued that White's advantage may <b>be</b> <b>sufficient</b> to force a win: Weaver Adams and Vsevolod Rauzer claimed that White is winning after the first move 1.e4, while Hans Berliner argued that 1.d4 may win for White.|$|E

In humans there are no defined lithium deficiency diseases, but low lithium intakes from water supplies were associated with increased rates of suicides, homicides and the arrest rates for drug use and other crimes. The biochemical mechanisms of action of lithium appear to be multifactorial and are intercorrelated with the functions of several enzymes, hormones and vitamins, {{as well as with}} growth and transforming factors. Evidence now appears to <b>be</b> <b>sufficient</b> to accept lithium as essential; a provisional RDA of 1,000µg/day is suggested for a 70kg adult.|$|E
