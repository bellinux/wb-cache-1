25|$|The ephemeral {{qualities of}} operatic success are once more {{exemplified}} by the case of Emilie Ambre. In {{the early days of}} the Mapleson regime she made something of a sensation in New York, particularly as Aida, a role to which her very dark complexion was well suited. Now she is dead. Not long ago her effects were auctioned off at the Hotel Drouot. The whole civilized world heard the news, but there was scarcely a sigh from the public, for the singer had <b>been</b> <b>absolutely</b> forgotten.|$|E

500|$|In mid-2013, guitarist John Petrucci {{began writing}} {{a story for}} a concept album, {{presenting}} it {{to the rest of}} Dream Theater about a year later. The band and the record label were receptive to the idea, with Petrucci recalling, [...] "Everybody had the 'go for it' mentality. And from the very first meeting that we had with Dave Rath at Roadrunner, when I presented this and even just said the title, he was 100 percent on board. The involvement of everybody at Roadrunner has <b>been</b> <b>absolutely</b> unbelievable, so supportive. It kind of ignited the secret nerd in all of us that loves this sort of stuff, because it's fun, it's different." [...] From its conception, Petrucci envisioned the story as eventually being re-worked into a film, play, or video game.|$|E
500|$|Within {{his first}} year on Coronation Street, Thompson had acted out scenes that {{involved}} his character stealing a car, graffiting {{the wall of the}} local newsagents, and discovering that his mother's fiancée was having a gay affair with her male best friend. Still impressed with Thompson's acting ability, producers of the series had his contract extended to 2009. Reflecting on {{his first year}} in the soap, Thompson said: [...] "It's been a really strange year and a lot of things have happened. It's <b>been</b> <b>absolutely</b> brilliant. The filming is everything that I could have wanted it to be. It's fantastic and I enjoy it more than anything." [...] He added: [...] "My favourite story lines so far have been doing the graffiti and stealing the car. I really enjoyed filming those two." ...|$|E

500|$|The islands saw no {{military}} activity during the Second World War, remaining uninhabited, but three aircraft crash sites remain from that period. A Beaufighter LX798 based at Port Ellen on Islay crashed into Conachair within [...] {{of the summit}} {{on the night of}} 3–4 June 1943. A year later, just before midnight on 7 June 1944, the day after D-Day, a Sunderland flying boat ML858 was wrecked at the head of Gleann Mòr. A small plaque in the church is dedicated to those who died in this accident. A Wellington bomber crashed on the south coast of Soay in 1942 or 1943. Not until 1978 was any formal attempt made to investigate the wreck, and its identity has not <b>been</b> <b>absolutely</b> determined. Amongst the wreckage, a Royal Canadian Air Force cap badge was discovered, which suggests it may have been HX448 of 7 OTU which went missing on a navigation exercise on 28 September 1942. Alternatively, {{it has been suggested that}} the Wellington is LA995 of 303 FTU which was lost on 23 February 1943.|$|E
500|$|In 1957, {{she made}} a state visit to the United States, where she {{addressed}} the United Nations General Assembly {{on behalf of the}} Commonwealth. On the same tour, she opened the 23rd Canadian Parliament, becoming the first monarch of Canada to open a parliamentary session. Two years later, solely in her capacity as Queen of Canada, she revisited the United States and toured Canada. In 1961, she toured Cyprus, India, Pakistan, Nepal, and Iran. On a visit to Ghana the same year, she dismissed fears for her safety, even though her host, President Kwame Nkrumah, who had replaced her as head of state, was a target for assassins. Harold Macmillan wrote, [...] "The Queen has <b>been</b> <b>absolutely</b> determined all through... She is impatient of the attitude towards her to treat her as... a film star... She has indeed 'the heart and stomach of a man'... She loves her duty and means to be a Queen." [...] Before her tour through parts of Quebec in 1964, the press reported that extremists within the Quebec separatist movement were plotting Elizabeth's assassination. No attempt was made, but a riot did break out while she was in Montreal; the Queen's [...] "calmness and courage {{in the face of the}} violence" [...] was noted.|$|E
500|$|Edwards {{opted to}} remain at Accrington ahead of the 2007–08 season, signing a {{contract}} extension in May 2007. He played his {{first game of the}} campaign in late August 2007, a 2–0 defeat at Lincoln City. Following Accrington's 4–1 home win against Grimsby Town in September 2007, a game in which Edwards appeared as a 90th-minute substitute, he did not feature in the first-team for two months. He returned to first-team action on 17 November 2007, playing in the club's 1–0 home defeat to Rotherham United. Following a spate of late substitute appearances, Edwards was ever present in the first-team from December 2007 onwards. He scored his first goal of the 2007–08 season on 4 April 2008, scoring the winner in a 1–0 win against Dagenham & Redbridge. The goal all but guaranteed League Two survival for Accrington. It was Edwards' only goal of the season, playing 32 games in all competitions. Edwards started in Accrington's first game of the 2008–09 season, a 1–0 home loss to newly promoted Aldershot Town. In October 2008, Accrington manager John Coleman praised Edwards for his form during the start of the season, [...] "I couldn't pay him enough compliments. I think the last six months he has <b>been</b> <b>absolutely</b> magnificent. I am convinced if he was three inches bigger he would be playing in the Premier League. He is our best defender and hopefully he'll continue to be a great player for us for a long time". Edwards remained ever present in the Accrington first-team, but was taken off after 17 minutes in Accrington's 2–1 win against Shrewsbury Town. Despite needing eight stitches in his knee, Edwards played in Accrington's following league match four days later, a 1–0 home defeat to Wycombe Wanderers. He provided the assist for Paul Mullin's goal in a defeat at Wycombe Wanderers, as well as assisting Jamie Clarke's second goal in a 3–1 home win over Grimsby Town. Edwards played in every one of Accrington's 50 games during the 2008–09 season, with the club finishing 16th in the league table.|$|E

In other words, where one researcher may say their experiment suggests evidence of absence, another researcher might argue that the experiment failed to detect a phenomenon for other reasons.|$|E
