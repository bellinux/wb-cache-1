5|$|Astrophysicist Alice C. Quillen and her student Stephen Thorndike {{performed}} {{computer simulations}} {{of the structure}} of the dust disk around Epsilon Eridani. Their model suggested that the clumping of the dust particles could <b>be</b> <b>explained</b> <b>by</b> the presence of a second planet in an eccentric orbit, which they announced in 2002.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of {{discovery}} in 2001, 47 Ursae Majoris was already known to host one extrasolar planet, designated 47 Ursae Majoris b. Further measurements of the radial velocity revealed another periodicity in the data unaccounted for by the first planet. This periodicity could <b>be</b> <b>explained</b> <b>by</b> assuming that a second planet, designated 47 Ursae Majoris c, existed in the system with an orbital period close to 7 years. Observations of the photosphere of 47 Ursae Majoris suggested that the periodicity could not <b>be</b> <b>explained</b> <b>by</b> stellar activity, making the planet interpretation more likely. The planet was announced in 2002.|$|E

5|$|At {{the time}} of its discovery, WASP-43b had an orbital period of {{approximately}} 0.8 days (19.2 hours), the second-shortest orbit ever detected, surpassed only by WASP-19b. In addition, at {{the time of}} discovery, WASP-43b was the most closely orbiting Hot Jupiter known, a phenomenon that can most likely <b>be</b> <b>explained</b> <b>by</b> its host star's low mass.|$|E
5|$|From {{national}} hospital admission databases {{it appears}} that the need for neurosurgical intervention for IIH has increased markedly over the period between 1988 and 2002. This has been attributed at least in part to the rising prevalence of obesity, although some of this increase may <b>be</b> <b>explained</b> <b>by</b> the increased popularity of shunting over optic nerve sheath fenestration.|$|E
5|$|In 1874, Jacobus Henricus van 't Hoff and Joseph Achille Le Bel {{independently}} {{proposed that}} the phenomenon of optical activity could <b>be</b> <b>explained</b> <b>by</b> assuming that the chemical bonds between carbon atoms and their neighbors were directed towards the corners of a regular tetrahedron. This led {{to a better understanding}} of the three-dimensional nature of molecules.|$|E
30|$|Figure  2, {{illustrates}} graphically {{the taxonomy}} proposed by Cao et al. (1997) to classify existing works on cooperative {{tasks such as}} box pushing, traffic control and foraging. This taxonomy contains five principal axes: Group Architecture, Resource Conflicts, Origins of Cooperation, Learning and Geometric Problems. Each axis is described by multiple features. The axis Group Architecture <b>is</b> <b>explained</b> by: Organization of the control,Difference between teammates, Communication medium, Modeling of Teammates. The axis Resource Conflicts <b>is</b> <b>explained</b> <b>by</b> the Source of conflict. The axis Origins of Cooperation <b>is</b> <b>explained</b> <b>by</b> the Motivation to execute a cooperation.

5|$|It {{has been}} shown that {{environmental}} parameters like changes in temperature and prior residence may affect the cichlid's territorial aggression. The convict cichlids are more aggressive at 30°C as opposed to 26°C, which may <b>be</b> <b>explained</b> <b>by</b> the fact that convict cichlids tend to set up their breeding sites and spawn at 30°C.|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} {{developed}} and examined a conceptual model of working through self-defeating patterns. Participants were 390 college {{students at a}} large midwestern university. Results indicated that self-defeating patterns mediated the relations between attachment and distress. Also, self-esteem medi-ated the link between self-defeating patterns and depression, whereas social self-efficacy mediated the association between self-defeating patterns and interpersonal distress. A total of 33 % {{of the variance in}} self-defeating patterns <b>was</b> <b>explained</b> <b>by</b> attachment anxiety and avoidance; 39 % of the variance in self-esteem and 13 % of the variance in social self-efficacy <b>were</b> <b>explained</b> <b>by</b> self-defeating patterns and/or attachment anxiety; 50 % of the variance in depression <b>was</b> <b>explained</b> <b>by</b> attachment anxiety, self-defeating patterns, and self-esteem; 45 % of the variance in interpersonal distress <b>was</b> <b>explained</b> <b>by</b> attachment anxiety and avoidance, self-defeating patterns, and social self-efficacy...|$|R
5|$|One study {{published}} in 2003 suggested that curve-billed speciation was due to climate, which could <b>be</b> <b>explained</b> <b>by</b> molt and feather wear. The same study suggested that the Sierra Madre Occidental acts {{as a barrier to}} initiate differentiation within the species.|$|E

5|$|Subarachnoid hemorrage due to {{arterial}} rupture typically occurs if the dissection extends {{into the}} V4 {{section of the}} artery. This may <b>be</b> <b>explained</b> <b>by</b> {{the fact that the}} arterial wall is thinner and lacks a number of structural supports in this section.|$|E
40|$|Latin American {{students}} consistently score low {{on international}} tests of cognitive skills. In the PISA 2012 results, students in seven Latin American countries {{had an average}} score of 395, or about 100 points lower than the average score of 497 in four Scandinavian countries. We examine why Latin American scores are lower and conclude that 50 points <b>are</b> <b>explained</b> <b>by</b> Latin American families’ lower average educational and socioeconomic characteristics, 25 points <b>are</b> <b>explained</b> <b>by</b> Latin America’s weak cultural orientation toward reading books, and the remaining 25 points <b>are</b> <b>explained</b> <b>by</b> the lower effectiveness of educational systems in teaching cognitive skills...|$|R

5|$|The Planet Nine {{hypothesis}} {{suggests that}} the orbits of several detached objects can <b>be</b> <b>explained</b> <b>by</b> the gravitational influence of a large, unobserved planet between 200 AU and 1200 AU from the Sun and/or the influence of Neptune.|$|E
5|$|The {{properties}} of the main ring can <b>be</b> <b>explained</b> <b>by</b> the hypothesis that it contains significant amounts of dust with 0.1–10μm particle sizes. This explains the stronger forward-scattering of light as compared to back-scattering. However, larger bodies are required to explain the strong back-scattering and fine structure in the bright outer part of the main ring.|$|E

5|$|Their {{longevity}} may <b>be</b> <b>explained</b> <b>by</b> {{the fact}} that the builders used a relatively dry mix of mortar and aggregate and compacted it by pounding it down to eliminate air pockets.

5|$|Additionally, {{there is}} a {{relative}} absence of objects with semi-major axes below 39 AU that cannot apparently <b>be</b> <b>explained</b> <b>by</b> the present resonances. The currently accepted hypothesis {{for the cause of}} this is that as Neptune migrated outward, unstable orbital resonances moved gradually through this region, and thus any objects within it were swept up, or gravitationally ejected from it.|$|E
5|$|Although {{observations}} using {{adaptive optics}} in late 1997 and early 1998 showed a double {{peak in the}} brightness of the nucleus, controversy still exists over whether such observations can only <b>be</b> <b>explained</b> <b>by</b> a binary nucleus. The discovery of the satellite was not confirmed by other observations. Also, while comets have been observed to break up before, no case has previously been found of a stable binary nucleus. Given the very small mass of this comet, the orbit of the binary nucleus would be easily disrupted by the gravity of the Sun and planets.|$|E
