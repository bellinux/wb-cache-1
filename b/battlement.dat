5|$|Three {{prominent}} ridges {{descend from}} {{the east side of}} the mountain. The Ridge of Wonders is furthest south and ends at an area away from the mountain called The Island. <b>Battlement</b> Ridge is very rugged and descends from high on the mountain. The furthest ridge north on the east side, Victory Ridge, descends from a lower elevation on the mountain than <b>Battlement</b> Ridge beneath the precipitous Roosevelt Cliff. Lava Ridge, starting at about the same location as the North Cleaver, descends slightly east of north.|$|E
5|$|Several rock {{prominences}} {{exist on}} the lower flanks of Adams. The Spearhead is an abrupt rocky prominence {{near the bottom of}} <b>Battlement</b> Ridge. Burnt Rock, The Hump, and The Bumper are three smaller rocky prominences at or below the tree line on the west side.|$|E
5|$|The Dutch {{municipality}} of Sint-Oedenrode, {{named after the}} Scottish princess Saint Oda, uses {{a version of the}} flag of Scotland, defaced with a gold castle having on both sides a <b>battlement.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Battlements</b> {{have been}} used for {{thousands}} of years; the earliest known example is in the fortress at Buhen in Egypt. <b>Battlements</b> were used in the walls surrounding Assyrian towns, as shown on bas reliefs from Nimrud and elsewhere. Traces of them remain at Mycenae in Greece, and some ancient Greek vases suggest the existence of <b>battlements.</b> The Great Wall of China has <b>battlements.</b>|$|R
50|$|On the tower, the buttresses rise {{two stories}} to a stone cornice, which {{separates}} the two stages. It has a slight {{rise above the}} pointed-arch window below corresponding to {{the width of the}} round-arched window above. Above that story, another cornice sets off the <b>battlements</b> at the roofline. The turret has two narrow windows. It, too, is topped by <b>battlements</b> but not divided into stages. The extension on the north wall also has <b>battlements.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{main section}} of the {{building}} is topped by <b>battlements</b> over a series of corbels. The clock tower above also features such an arrangement with <b>battlements</b> and corbels. The overall design {{is similar to the}} Palazzo Vecchio in Florence, but on a much smaller scale.|$|R
5|$|The Westons {{have carried}} out {{substantial}} landscaping at the fort, and recruited Rosemary Verey {{to help with}} the design of the gardens at Fort Belvedere in the early 1980s. Verey's designs for the rose garden and the 120ft long borders along the <b>battlement</b> remain, and have been reworked and maintained by garden designer Tom Stuart-Smith.|$|E
5|$|At {{one point}} during the battle, the flag Moultrie had {{designed}} and raised over the fort was shot down. Sergeant William Jasper reportedly ran to the <b>battlement</b> and raised the flag again, holding it up and rallying the troops until a flag stand could be provided. He was credited by Moultrie with reviving the troops' spirits, and later given commendations for bravery. A painting of this event (pictured above) depicts Jasper's actions.|$|E
5|$|I-70 {{exits the}} valley through De Beque Canyon, a path carved by the Colorado River that {{separates}} the Book Cliffs from <b>Battlement</b> Mesa. The river and its tributaries provide the course for the ascent up the Rocky Mountains. In the canyon, I-70 enters the Beavertail Mountain Tunnel, {{the first of several}} tunnels built to route the freeway across the Rockies. This tunnel design features a curved sidewall, unusual for tunnels in the United States, where most tunnels feature a curved roof and flat side-walls. Engineers borrowed a European design to give the tunnel added strength. After the canyon winds past the Book Cliffs, the highway follows the Colorado River through a valley containing the communities of Parachute and Rifle.|$|E
50|$|The {{top part}} is {{surrounded}} by <b>battlements.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{structure}} of the fort is easily identifiable, with its <b>battlements</b> serving as positioning batteries. It was designed vertically, in order to permit visibility both from its <b>battlements,</b> and from sea. Its height, makes {{it one of the}} more interesting features of the structure, permitting observation.|$|R
5000|$|In J.R.R Tolkien’s The Fellowship of the Ring, the Dark Tower is {{described}} as being composed of iron, being black in colour and having <b>battlements</b> and gates. [...] In the painting the walls are of mainly grey stone and brick, and <b>battlements,</b> gates and towers are not visible.|$|R
5|$|Ben Youssef Mosque, {{distinguished}} by its green tiled roof and minaret, {{is located in}} the medina and is Marrakesh's oldest mosque. It was originally built in the 12th century by the Almoravid Sultan Ali ibn Yusuf in honor of Yusuf ibn Ali al-Sanhaji. When built it was the city's largest mosque but today it is half its original size. It was rebuilt in the 1560s by Saadian Sultan Abdallah al-Ghalib, as the original had fallen into ruin. He also built a madrasa with a large library beside the mosque, but this also deteriorated over time, leaving only the 19th-century mosque intact. The Almoravid Koubba Ba’adiyn, a two-storied kiosk, was discovered in a sunken location on the mosque site in 1948. In the Moroccan architectural style, its arches are scalloped on the first floor, while those on the second floor bear a twin horseshoe shape embellished with a turban motif. The dome of the kiosk is framed by a <b>battlement</b> decorated with arches and seven-pointed stars. The interior of the octagonally arched dome is decorated with distinctive carvings bordered by a Kufic frieze inscribed with the name of its patron, Sultan Ali ibn Yusuf. The quinches at the corners of the dome are covered with muqarnas. The kiosk has motifs of pine cones, palms and acanthus leaves which are also replicated in the Ben Youssef Madrasa.|$|E
5|$|While {{the north}} and south faces of Adams are climbed easily, the west and east faces of the {{mountain}} were deemed impossible to climb because of the steep cliffs and ice cascades. To some, this assumption was a challenge and for years, C. E. Rusk searched for a way to climb the east face. On one of these excursions, in 1919, Rusk named the Wilson Glacier, Victory Ridge, and the Roosevelt Cliff. It was on this trip that Rusk decided that the Castle held the easiest route up. In 1921, 67 years after the first ascent of Adams, a group from the Cascadians mountaineering club, led by Rusk, completed the first ascent of the precipitous east face of the mountain. Their route took them up the Rusk Glacier, onto <b>Battlement</b> Ridge, up and over The Castle, and across the vast, heavily crevassed eastern side of the summit ice cap. One of the party, Edgar E. Coursen, said that the route was “thrilling to the point of extreme danger.” Others in the party were Wayne E. Richardson, Clarence Truitt, Rolland Whitmore, Robert E. Williams, and Clarence Starcher. Three years later, in 1924, a group of three men from the Mazamas finally climbed the west face of Adams. This route is straightforward, but made difficult by icefalls, mud slips, and easily started rock avalanches.|$|E

25|$|The {{coat of arms}} {{displays}} a red brick wall with three towers in a blue field. Each tower, the middle one taller and wider than the other two, is topped with a <b>battlement</b> with three crenels and has a black vertical loophole and a black window. In the wall there is a gate {{with a pair of}} open golden doors with fleur-de-lis-shaped metalwork and a raised golden grate. Inside the gate there is the White Eagle with a golden crown , beak and talons. The escutcheon has a typically Renaissance shape and is topped with a golden Crown of Bolesław I the Brave with fleurs-de-lis, closed with a globus cruciger (an orb with a cross).|$|E
25|$|At St John's {{the design}} is even more complex, because, {{near the top of}} the upper window, the tower itself {{suddenly}} appears to become octagonal in horizontal section, before the spire is reached. The change to the section is masked by the presence of four large pinnacles which rise from the corners at this point, as if they were sitting on the buttresses but are in line with the tower itself. Behind the pinnacles, once again Blacket has placed an encircling <b>battlement</b> which appears to mark the point where the tower ceases to be tower and becomes spire, or vice versa. Harmonious with the four crocketed pinnacles, and on the same level, are little dormer windows.|$|E
25|$|On 29 September 1996, the keep's machicolations were destroyed. As a result, {{there was}} an {{expanded}} attempt to recuperate, clean and repair existing damage to the site, which included: the repair of the roofing, including reinforcement of existing structures; the placement of an undulating asphalt sub-tile and then re-tiling the coverage; repair to the trapdoor access to the <b>battlement</b> with a metal structure; repaires to the interior and exterior parapets; treatment of cracks and joints; weather-proofing of the battlements; repairs to all staircases, pavements, landings, handrails and tiling floors; the repair of the main gate, execution of a second gate in glass, replacement of windows and frames; and the substitution of the electrical system.|$|E

25|$|At St Stephen's (1871), {{the tower}} has an {{accompanying}} stair turret that {{rises to the}} level below the tall upper belfry window. At that level, both the tower {{and the top of}} the turret are encircled by a <b>battlement,</b> as if the tower itself might well end there, as it does at St Paul's, Redfern. But it does not; it rises, somewhat narrower, and visually reduced by the clever play of overlapping forms. Each of the tall windows on the four sides is set into a slightly projecting plane, with its own gable, very similar in form to that which Blacket often used around doors. These rise like dormers between the broaches, overlapping the meeting of the spire and the tower, so the horizontal definition between the two occurs only at the corners. Unfortunately, in the 1990s the large poppyhead {{on the top of the}} spire became unsafe and was removed which has lessened the visual impact.|$|E
25|$|Denethor, the Steward of Gondor, {{was a more}} tragic {{character}} in the book. In the film, overwhelming grief {{over the death of}} Boromir has driven him to despair, and he has given up any hope of defeating Sauron before Gandalf arrives in Minas Tirith. Thus, the muster of Gondor is absent from the film, and major captains and generals (including Imrahil of the Tower Guard and the Knights of Dol Amroth) are not present. In the book, he has already ordered the lighting of the beacons before Gandalf's arrival, while he refuses to light them in the film, and the sequence where Pippin secretly lights them himself was invented for the movie. The film only hints at Denethor's use of the palantír which drives him mad, information revealed in the Pyre scene, which includes Shadowfax and is more violent than the book. Aware of the very long distance between Rath Dínen and the front of the out-thrust <b>battlement,</b> Jackson has Denethor jump off the Citadel in addition to burning himself on the Pyre, one of the earliest changes.|$|E
25|$|The terrace or {{fighting}} {{platform of}} a bergfried was originally often surrounded by <b>battlement.</b> Occasionally these crenellations have survived {{in their original}} state, especially where they were protected by subsequent roof or other superstructures (Wellheim Castle). The fighting platform could be either open or covered by a roof or spire. Depending on the floor plan of the tower, the latter would frequently either be a tented or a conical roof. The roof comprised a wooden truss covered with tiles or slates or, alternatively, was of solid stone. It often covered the entire fighting platform, so that the roof rested on the battlements. In other cases it was set back, creating an open gangway between roof and battlements (e.g. the Rudelsburg and Osterburg). In covered fighting platforms there were similarly located window openings {{in place of the}} merlons that gave a panoramic view of the surrounding area and enabled the use of long-distance weapons (Idstein Castle, Sayn Castle). Some surviving ledges or beam holes on bergfrieds indicate, in some cases, that wooden superstructures were used. In the late Middle Ages, the tower roofs were often embellished with bartizans and other similar structures.|$|E
