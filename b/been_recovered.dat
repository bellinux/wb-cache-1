5|$|Although much of Britain {{from this}} time is now beneath the sea, remains have been {{discovered}} on land that show horses were present, and being hunted, in this period. Significant finds include a horse tooth dating from between 55,000 and 47,000BC and horse bones dating from between 50,000 and 45,000BC, recovered from Pin Hole Cave, in the Creswell Crags ravine in the North Midlands; further horse remains from the same era have <b>been</b> <b>recovered</b> from Kent's Cavern.

5|$|It is {{speculated that}} cowrie shells {{may have been}} the {{principal}} currency at Gedi. Cowrie shells have <b>been</b> <b>recovered</b> in the store rooms of the houses and found in greater abundance than struck coins, represented by only two coins of Chinese origin. The use of cowries as currency is supported by their historical use as tender in various parts of Africa, and Kirkman estimated the exchange rate of cowrie shells to the gold dinar to be 400,000 to 1. However, there are examples of locally struck coins at contemporary sites, but none have <b>been</b> <b>recovered</b> at Gedi. The use of beads as a currency has also been proposed by J. F. Schofield, who claims that a {{decline in the number of}} beads recovered in the upper stratigraphic layers reflects a decline in their value around the fifteenth century.|$|E

40|$|An {{evaluation}} of two commercially available swab transport systems, Port-A-Cul (PAC; BBL Microbiology Systems, Cockeysville, Md.) and Anaerobic Specimen Collector (ASC; Becton Dickinson Vacutainer Systems, Rutherford, N. J.), {{in the recovery}} of organisms from clinical specimens was done. Fifteen abscesses were drained, and swabs of their contents {{were placed in the}} transport systems until they were inoculated for detection of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. The swabs were plated immediately after collection and after delays of 4, 24, 48, and 72 h. A total of 70 bacterial isolates, 47 anaerobes and 23 aerobes, <b>were</b> <b>recovered</b> from specimens inoculated immediately after collection. The survival of anaerobic bacteria was better in the PAC system than in the ASC system. This was evident as the length of delay in cultivation was extended. At 4 h, 46 anaerobic isolates <b>were</b> <b>recovered</b> in the PAC system, compared with 39 in the ASC system (P less than 0. 1). At 24 h, 45 isolates <b>were</b> <b>recovered</b> in the PAC system and 26 isolates <b>were</b> <b>recovered</b> in ASC (P less than 0. 001); at 48 h, 40 <b>were</b> <b>recovered</b> in PAC and 15 <b>were</b> <b>recovered</b> in ASC; and at 72 h, 32 <b>were</b> <b>recovered</b> in PAC and 6 <b>were</b> <b>recovered</b> in ASC. There were no differences between the systems in the recovery of aerobic bacteria. These data demonstrate the usefulness of the PAC system in the recovery of anaerobes and the need for quality control of all transport systems for anaerobic bacteria...|$|R
