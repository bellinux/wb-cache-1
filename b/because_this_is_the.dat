25|$|The {{children}} of any vertex in the Calkin–Wilf tree may be computed by inverting {{the formula for}} {{the parents of a}} vertex. Each vertex a/b has one child whose value is less than 1, a/(a+b), <b>because</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> only value less than 1 whose parent formula leads back to a/b. Similarly, each vertex a/b has one child whose value is greater than 1, (a+b)/b.|$|E
25|$|In the Weekly Maqam, Sephardi Jews {{each week}} base {{the songs of}} the {{services}} {{on the content of}} that week's parashah. For parashah Devarim, Sephardi Jews apply Maqam Hijaz, the maqam that expresses mourning and sadness. This maqam is appropriate not due to the content of the parashah, but <b>because</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> parashah that falls on the Shabbat prior to Tisha B'Av, the date that marks the destruction of the Temples.|$|E
50|$|Carneades {{is known}} as an Academic skeptic. Academic skeptics (so called <b>because</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> type of {{skepticism}} taught in Plato's Academy in Athens) hold that all knowledge is impossible, except for the knowledge that all other knowledge is impossible.|$|R

25|$|E.U. {{member state}} {{requirements}} that bank accounts be opened. Many EU countries require banks to open accounts for applicants (<b>because</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> only method to receive salary). FATCA's mechanism to close bank accounts if FATCA demands are not met violates such laws (see insättnings garanti in Sweden). New FATCA IGA requirements demand that banks shall not open accounts for U.S. persons or accounts for non-U.S. persons {{if the individual}} refuses to declare U.S.-person status upon bank account applications.|$|E
25|$|The virus circulates between ticks and rodents, {{with humans}} being the {{secondary}} hosts. People {{at risk for}} catching the disease are hikers and campers {{that are in the}} risk areas. Also, April, May, and June are when the infections mainly occur, <b>because</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> time when the adult ticks are prevalent in the environment. Unfortunately, this is also when the weather is pleasant for hiking and camping. The best way to avoid getting bitten and catching this disease is wearing long sleeves or pants, avoiding high tick-infested areas, and wearing tick repellent.|$|E
25|$|Although fire {{can occur}} {{during the growing}} or the dormant seasons, managed fire during the dormant season is most {{effective}} at increasing the grass and forb cover, biodiversity and plant nutrient uptake in shortgrass prairies. Managers must also take into account, however, how invasive and non-native species respond to fire {{if they want to}} restore the integrity of a native ecosystem. For example, fire can only control the invasive spotted knapweed (Centaurea maculosa) on the Michigan tallgrass prairie in the summer, <b>because</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> time in the knapweed's life cycle that is most important to its reproductive growth.|$|E
50|$|Constance Naish and Gillian Story {{developed}} their orthography {{for use in}} their Bible translations and related works. <b>Because</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> first system that could accurately represent all the Tlingit phonemes, and due to the pair's emphasis on native literacy, the Naish-Story system became very widespread {{within a few years}} of its introduction.|$|R
2500|$|<b>This</b> {{broadcast}} <b>was</b> considered <b>the</b> [...] "return" [...] of ABS-CBN on air <b>because</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> {{time when}} former employees of <b>the</b> network <b>were</b> inside <b>the</b> complex after 14 years of closure since Marcos {{took it over}} during the Martial Law of 1972. Radio Bandido ended broadcasting that afternoon, while Radio Veritas resumed transmissions, this time from the ABS-CBN Broadcasting Center's radio studios.|$|R
50|$|<b>Because</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> first eroge ever {{released}} in North America {{and the first}} in English, it garnered attention from the small anime community at the time. However, the release itself had many problems in localization in terms of translation and dialog. Metaphors for genitals were used for virtually every sex scene and misspellings and bad grammar were very common.|$|R
25|$|The final Environmental Improvement Score is {{determined}} through the average (and rounded {{to the nearest}} tenth) of the values for global warming emissions reductions and tailpipe emissions. As an example, the 2011 Lincoln MKZ Hybrid achieved a 46% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions compared with its sibling gasoline-only model. <b>Because</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> largest percent reduction achieved among all hybrids the MKZ Hybrid earns a global warming emissions score of 10. As a California certified Partial Zero Emission Vehicle, the MKZ Hybrid earns an EPA air pollution score of 9.0. When both scores are combined, the MKZ Hybrid earns an overall Environmental Improvement Score of 9.5.|$|E
25|$|A final {{spectrum}} of SN 2002cx was taken on July 16, 56 days after B-band maximum. SN 2002cx was by {{then in the}} nebular phase, with emission lines dominating over absorption lines. The lines were far narrower than previously observed type Ia supernovae and are less pronounced as well. SN 2002cx most clearly differs from other type Ia supernovae in the region between 6500 Å and 8500 Å where it has a primarily flat continuum and weak Ca II infrared triplet absorption. <b>Because</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> region covered by the R and I-bands, it may explain the odd color evolution of SN 2002cx in these bands.|$|E
25|$|Counter-intuitively, {{the best}} {{approach}} for a fast bowler is not to bowl constantly at the wicket as such predictability allows the batsman to simply defend his or her wicket and pick off the occasional bad ball. A far more effective approach is to introduce variation of line and length, leaving the batsman unsure as to whether to attack, defend or leave. The majority of balls in a well-bowled spell will usually be swinging or seaming balls that pass at waist height, just outside the off stump and {{move away from the}} batsman <b>because</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> area where it is most difficult for the batsman to choose the most appropriate response. Common variations and their tactical application are discussed below.|$|E

50|$|In 1896 twenty smaller private banks {{formed a}} new joint-stock bank. The leading {{partners}} {{of the new}} bank, which was named Barclay and Company, were already connected by a web of family, business and religious relationships.

25|$|His wife Mary has {{recently}} returned from treatment for drug addiction and has put on weight as a result. She is looking much healthier than the family has been accustomed to, and they remark frequently on her improved appearance. However, she still retains the haggard facial features of a long-time addict. As a recovering addict, she is restless and anxious. She also suffers from insomnia, which is not made any easier by her husband and children's loud snoring. When Edmund, her younger son, hears her moving around at night and entering the spare bedroom, he becomes alarmed, <b>because</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> room where, in the past, she would satisfy her morphine addiction. He questions her about it indirectly. She reassures him that she just went there {{to get away from}} her husband's snoring.|$|E
25|$|Sometimes {{called the}} 'patrol method.' Scouts are {{organised}} {{in small groups}} (about five to seven Scouts) <b>because</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> natural way boys work together. These patrols are therefore {{more important than the}} Scout troop. Patrols must be kept intact under all circumstances, including working, tenting, learning, cooking, and surviving together. In a Patrol the Scouts learn to work with others, while the Patrol leader learns responsibility for others. Both have to give up part of their personal interest for this. However, Scouting deals with the individual, not with the Company. A Scout has his own identity within the group and learns as an individual. The Patrol serves as the character school for the individual. Younger sections, such as Cub Scouts and Beaver Scouts, are divided into sixes (Cubs) or lodges (Beavers). While Beaver lodges have no leader structure, Cub sixes have a sixer and seconder.|$|E
25|$|Bone {{metabolism}} also changes. Normally, bone is {{laid down}} {{in the direction of}} mechanical stress. However, in a microgravity environment there is very little mechanical stress. This results in a loss of bone tissue approximately 1.5% per month especially from the lower vertebrae, hip and femur. Due to microgravity and the decreased load on the bones, there is a rapid increase in bone loss, from 3% cortical bone loss per decade to about 1% every month the body is exposed to microgravity, for an otherwise healthy adult. The rapid change in bone density is dramatic, making bones frail and resulting in symptoms which resemble those of osteoporosis. On Earth, the bones are constantly being shed and regenerated through a well-balanced system which involves signaling of osteoblasts and osteoclasts. These systems are coupled, so that whenever bone is broken down, newly formed layers take its place—neither should happen without the other, in a healthy adult. In space, however, there is an increase in osteoclast activity due to microgravity. This is a problem, because osteoclasts break down the bones into minerals that are reabsorbed by the body. Osteoblasts are not consecutively active with the osteoclasts, causing the bone to be constantly diminished with no recovery. This increase in osteoclasts activity has been seen particularly in the pelvic region, <b>because</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> region which carries the biggest load with gravity present. A study demonstrated that in healthy mice, osteoclasts appearance increased by 197%, accompanied by a down-regulation of osteoblasts and growth factors that are known to help with the formation of new bone, after only sixteen days of exposure to microgravity. Elevated blood calcium levels from the lost bone result in dangerous calcification of soft tissues and potential kidney stone formation. It is still unknown whether bone recovers completely. Unlike people with osteoporosis, astronauts eventually regain their bone density. After a 3–4 month trip into space, it takes about 2–3 years to regain lost bone density. New techniques are being developed to help astronauts recover faster. Research on diet, exercise and medication may hold the potential to aid the process of growing new bone.|$|E
25|$|According to Ayesha Jalal, David Gimartin {{believes}} {{that a number of}} pirs developed a personal stake in the League's election campaign; not <b>because</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> most appropriate tactical response to the prospect of a British transfer of power but because the pirs saw in the Pakistan movement an opportunity {{to break out of the}} colonial structures that had for so long thwarted their religious interests.|$|R
50|$|Friedrich König {{claimed that}} Xenophon was {{confused}} about Cyaxares <b>because</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> {{name of the}} father of Astyages. However, it was not unusual, especially among kings, for an individual to have the same name as his grandfather. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> case with both Cyrus the Great and Cambyses II.

500|$|According to the Irenaean tradition, {{humans are}} not created perfectly, {{but in a}} state of imperfection. The theodicy teaches that {{creation}} has two stages: humans were first created in the image of God, and will then be created in the likeness of God. Humans are imperfect because the second stage is incomplete, entailing the potential, not yet actualised, for humans to reach perfection. To achieve this likeness of God, humans must be refined and developed. The theodicy proposes that evil and suffering exists in the world <b>because</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> best way for humans to develop. As such, the Irenaean theodicy is sometimes referred to as the [...] "soul-making theodicy", a phrase taken from the poet John Keats.|$|E
500|$|Robinson fought 19 {{times in}} 1950. He {{successfully}} defended his welterweight {{title for the}} last time against Charley Fusari. Robinson won a lopsided 15-round decision, knocking Fusari down once. Robinson donated all but $1 of his purse for the Fusari fight to cancer research. In 1950 Robinson fought George Costner, who had also taken to calling himself [...] "Sugar" [...] and stated in {{the weeks leading up to}} the fight that he was the rightful possessor of the name.

500|$|Tone clusters...on {{the piano}} [...] whole scales of tones used as chords, {{or at least}} three {{contiguous}} tones along a scale {{being used as a}} chord. And, at times, if these chords exceed the number of tones that you have fingers on your hand, {{it may be necessary to}} play these either with the flat of the hand or sometimes with the full forearm. This is not done from the standpoint of trying to devise a new piano technique, although it actually amounts to that, but rather <b>because</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> only practicable method of playing such large chords. It should be obvious that these chords are exact and that one practices diligently in order to play them with the desired tone quality and to have them absolutely precise in nature.|$|E
500|$|Columbia Records {{released}} The Basement Tapes on June 26, 1975. The album {{peaked at}} number seven on the Billboard chart, and reached number {{eight in the}} UK. It was acclaimed by critics. John Rockwell of The New York Times hailed it as [...] "one of the greatest albums {{in the history of}} American popular music." [...] Rolling Stones Paul Nelson called its contents [...] "the hardest, toughest, sweetest, saddest, funniest, wisest songs I know". The review in The Washington Post declared, [...] "He may perplex, irritate, and disappoint, but Dylan has to rank as the single greatest artist modern American pop music has produced." [...] The Basement Tapes topped the Voices Pazz & Jop Critics Poll. Robert Christgau, the poll's creator and supervisor, said the recordings sounded richer and stranger in 1975 than when they were made and concluded, [...] "We don't have to bow our heads in shame <b>because</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> best album of 1975. It would have been the best album of 1967, too." ...|$|E
500|$|Tupelo Honey {{was well}} {{received}} by critics upon the album's release. Jon Landau wrote in Rolling Stone: [...] "Tupelo Honey {{is in one}} sense but {{another example of the}} artist making increased use of the album as the unit of communication as opposed to merely the song or the cut. Everything on it is perfectly integrated." [...] ZigZag magazine reviewer John Tobler, who also reviewed the album just after its release, gave the album high praise, saying [...] "If all music were as good as this, there wouldn't be any reason to make any more, <b>because</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> real thing." [...] Critic Dave Marsh called it [...] "the perfect album for Van: he does everything...so incredibly well. There isn't a bad cut on it, of that I'm really sure." [...] Robert Christgau from The Village Voice voiced reservations in his praise of the album, writing that it was [...] "almost as rich in cute tunes as The Shirelles' Greatest Hits, but I worry that domestic bliss with Janet Planet has been softening Van's noodle more than the joy of cooking requires." [...] Tupelo Honey was later ranked the fourth best album {{of the year in the}} Village Voice's first annual Pazz & Jop Critics Poll.|$|E
