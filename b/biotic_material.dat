5|$|Chemical {{reactions}} led to {{the first}} self-replicating molecules about four billion years ago. A half billion years later, the last common ancestor of all life arose. The evolution of photosynthesis allowed the Sun's energy to be harvested directly by life forms. The resultant molecular oxygen (O2) accumulated in the atmosphere and due to interaction with ultraviolet solar radiation, formed a protective ozone layer (O3) in the upper atmosphere. The incorporation of smaller cells within larger ones resulted {{in the development of}} complex cells called eukaryotes. True multicellular organisms formed as cells within colonies became increasingly specialized. Aided by the absorption of harmful ultraviolet radiation by the ozone layer, life colonized Earth's surface.

40|$|Availability of abiotic {{resources}} {{has been}} a topic of concern in recent years, resulting in several approaches being published to determine their availability on country and product level. However, the availability of <b>biotic</b> <b>materials</b> has not been analyzed to this extent yet. Therefore, an approach to determine possible limitations to availability of terrestrial <b>biotic</b> <b>materials</b> over the entire supply chain is introduced. The approach considers 24 categories overall as well as associated category indicators for the five dimensions: physical, socio-economic, abiotic, social and environmental constraints. This ensures a comprehensive availability assessment of bio-based product systems. The approach is applied to a case study comparing biodiesel produced from rapeseed and soy beans. The study shows that the determination of indicator values is feasible for most categories and their interpretation leads to meaningful conclusions. Thus, the approach leads to a more comprehensive assessment of availability aspects and supports better informed decision making in industry and policy.

40|$|Background: Global {{targets for}} {{reducing}} resource use {{have been set}} by {{organizations such as the}} International Resource Panel and the European Commission. However, these targets exist only at the macro level, e. g., for individual countries. When conducting an environmental analysis at the micro level, resource use is often neglected as an indicator. No sum parameter indicating all abiotic and <b>biotic</b> raw <b>materials</b> has been considered for life cycle assessment, as yet. In fact, life cycle assessment databases even lack some of the specific input flows required to calculate all abiotic and <b>biotic</b> raw <b>materials.</b> In contrast, the cumulative energy demand, an input-based indicator assessing the use of energy resources, is commonly used, particularly when analyzing energy-intensive product systems. Methods: In view of this, we analyze the environmental relevance of the sum parameter abiotic and <b>biotic</b> raw <b>material</b> demand, which we call the material footprint. First, we show how abiotic and <b>biotic</b> raw <b>material</b> demand can be implemented in the Ecoinvent life cycle assessment database. Employing the adapted database, the material footprint is calculated for 12 individual datasets of chosen materials and crops. The results are compared to those of the cumulated energy demand and four selected impact categories: climate change, ozone depletion, acidification, and terrestrial eutrophication. Results: The material footprint is generally high in the case of extracted metals and other materials where extraction is associated with a large amount of overburden. This fact can lead to different conclusions being drawn compared to common impact categories or the cumulative energy demand. However, the results show that both the range between the impacts of the different materials and the trends can be similar. Conclusions: The material footprint is very easy to apply and calculate. It can be implemented in life cycle assessment databases with a few adaptions. Furthermore, an initial comparison with common impact indicators suggests that the material footprint can be used as an input-based indicator to evaluate the environmental burden, without the uncertainty associated with the assessment of emission-based impacts...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{questionable}} issues in wetting is the vertical force balance that is excluded in Young's law. On soft deformable solids, such as <b>biotic</b> <b>materials</b> and synthetic polymers, the vertical force of liquid leads to a microscopic protrusion of the contact line, i. e. a "wetting ridge". The wetting principle that determines the geometry of the ridge-tip {{is at the heart}} of the issues over the past half century. Here, we reveal a universal wetting principle by directly visualizing ridge-tips with high spatio-temporal resolution using x-ray microscopy. We find that the tip-geometry is asymmetric and bent, and invariant during ridge growth or by surface softness. This singular geometry is explained by linking the macroscopic and microscopic contact angles to Young's and Neumann's laws, respectively. Our dual-scale model would be applicable to a general framework in wetting and give new clues to various issues in cell-substrate interaction and elasto-capillary problems.

It gives {{a point of}} comparison with modern nation-wide material flow accounting. The aim is to test the feasibility of indicators of dematerialization {{of the economy in}} poor economies. We measured the annual material flows within the Sarowar village (670 inhabitants) in 1982 - 1983. The method was a combination of surveys, real time measurements, indirect measurements and laboratory dry matter measurements. The results were translated into recent concepts of material flow accounting (MFA), and compared with nation-wide studies. The total material requirement (TMR) of Sarowar (excluding air and water), USA, Japan, Germany and The Netherlands is respectively about 5, 84, 46, 86 and 84 tons per capita per year. The input (all <b>biotic</b> <b>materials</b> are expressed in tons of dry matter per capita per year) totalised 15. 8 t DM cap y in Sarowar, which consists mainly of air (11 t cap y) and <b>biotic</b> primary <b>materials</b> (4. 1 t DM cap y). The latest was composed of 29 % of pastures, 25 % of branches for field burning, 35 % of fuel wood, 6 % fodder, 1 % of construction wood and 4 % of grains. The outputs (15. 8 t cap y) were dominated by CO 2 (15. 1 t cap y). In contrast, the output of The Netherlands (66. 8 t cap y) is dominated by export with air emissions (19 t cap y), export (16 t cap y) and embedded export (29 t cap y). The apparent eco-efficiency (kg per US dollar, excluding air and water, including hidden flows) is 70, 3, 3, 3 and 3 kg $ respectively for Sarowar, Japan, USA, Germany and The Netherlands. The corrected eco-efficiency using Purchasing Power Parity is less contrasted with respectively 18, 3, 3, 4 and 3 kg $. Traditional human ecosystem measurements can serve as a basic comparison point, and as a test for dematerialization indicators. The limit of the indicator of eco-efficiency resides in the different degrees of monetization of the economies. In less monetized economies, this indicator is highly biased by the underlying non-market material flows.

However, {{the role of}} black bear-created canopy gaps has not been evaluated {{in the context of}} multiple forest dynamics. Our hypothesis was that small canopy gaps created by black bears improve light conditions, which facilitates fruiting of adult fleshy-fruited plants located beneath the gaps, and also that this chain interaction depends on interactions among the size of gaps, improved light conditions, forest layers, and life form of plants. The rPPFD, size of black bear-created canopy gaps, and fruiting/non-fruiting of fleshy-fruited plants were investigated in five forest layers beneath black-bear-created canopy gaps and closed canopies of Mongolian oak (Quercus crispula). We found that light conditions improved beneath black bear-disturbed trees with canopy gaps of large size, and the effect of improvement of light conditions was reduced with descending forest layers. Fruiting of fleshy-fruited plants, especially woody lianas and trees, was facilitated by the improvement of light conditions accompanied by an increase in the size of black-bear-created gaps. Data from this study revealed that canopy disturbance by black bears was key for improving light conditions and accelerating fruiting of fleshy-fruited trees and woody lianas in the canopy layers in particular. Therefore, our hypothesis was mostly supported. Our results provide evidence that Japanese black bears have high potential as ecosystem engineers that increase the availability of resources (light and fruit in this study) to other species by causing physical state changes in <b>biotic</b> <b>materials</b> (branches of Q. crispula in this study) ...|$|R

These two surface proteins were characterized to {{gain insight into}} their function, since they may have favored the rapid emergence of this nosocomial pathogen. We {{are the first to}} identify a surface adhesin among bacteria (SgrA) that binds to the extracellular matrix molecules nidogen 1 and nidogen 2, which are constituents of the basal lamina. EcbA is a novel E. faecium MSCRAMM (microbial surface component recognizing adhesive matrix molecules) that binds to collagen type V. In addition, both SgrA and EcbA bound to fibrinogen; however, SgrA targeted the alpha and beta chains, whereas EcbA bound to the gamma chain of fibrinogen. An E. faecium sgrA insertion mutant displayed reduced binding to both nidogens and fibrinogen. SgrA did not mediate binding of E. faecium cells to <b>biotic</b> <b>materials,</b> such as human intestinal epithelial cells, human bladder cells, and kidney cells, while this LPXTG surface adhesin is implicated in E. faecium biofilm formation.

Mice were provided with uncontaminated food supplies, ensuring that uptake of radionuclides was through soil ingestion, inhalation, or water. Mice were sampled before introduction and were reanalyzed every 10 d for 137 Cs uptake. Levels of 90 Sr were assessed in subsamples from the native populations and in experimental animals at the termination of the study. Uptake rates in house mice were greater than those in voles for both 137 Cs and 90 Sr. Daily uptake rates in house mice were estimated at 2. 72 � 10 12 unstable atoms per gram (whole body) for 137 Cs and 4. 04 � 10 10 unstable atoms per gram for 90 Sr. Comparable rates in voles were 2. 26 � 10 11 unstable atoms per gram for 137 Cs and 1. 94 � 10 10 unstable atoms per gram for 90 Sr. By comparing values from voles in the enclosures to those from wild voles caught within 50 m of the enclosures, {{it was estimated that}} only 8. 5 % of 137 Cs was incorporated from abiotic sources, leaving 91. 5 % being incorporated by uptake from <b>biotic</b> <b>materials.</b> The fraction of 90 Sr uptake from abiotic sources was at least 66. 7 % (and was probably much higher).

This requires an (resource) efficient and renewable supply of operating reserve. In this article, a possible {{solution to this problem}} is analysed: the Desertec concept. It is meant to convert solar energy in areas with high solar irradiation into electrical energy by means of Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) transferring this energy by High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) lines into the whole European Union Middle East and North Africa (EU-MENA) area. In order to assess the resource efficiency potential of Desertec, three different kinds of CSP plants (parabolic trough, Fresnel collector and central receiver of the building classes Inditep, Novatec and Solar Tres) including heat storage systems (Molten Salt and Phase-Changing-Material) and the necessary HVDC are analysed using the Material Input per Service Unit (MIPS) methodology. The assessment is accomplished for three different locations (Morocco, Tunisia and Egypt) and two points of time (2025 and 2050). With these results, a scenario of electricity supply in Germany in 2050 with a 20 % share of solar power import is calculated. Central receivers are the most resource efficient ones: their consumption of abiotic materials is only half of parabolic trough plants and two thirds of Fresnel trough plants. Water and air consumption is the lowest of all analyzed CSP plants as well. The scenario for Germany's fuel mix in 2050 shows that a predominantly renewable fuel mix reduces the consumption of abiotic materials by 75 %, of water by 60 % and of air by 45 %.
