5|$|All {{ethnic groups}} speak <b>Bulgarian,</b> {{either as a}} first or as a second {{language}}. <b>Bulgarian</b> is the only language with official status and native for 85.2 percent of the population. The oldest written Slavic language, <b>Bulgarian</b> is distinguishable from the other languages in this group through certain grammatical peculiarities such as the lack of noun cases and infinitives, and a suffixed definite article.|$|E
5|$|Although his {{links to}} <b>Bulgarian</b> culture were {{weakened}} by his father's departure, Cerna, who was baptized in the <b>Bulgarian</b> Greek Catholic Church, became fluent in <b>Bulgarian.</b> According to literary critic George Călinescu, {{he always had}} some difficulties conversing in Romanian, but could write it with ease.|$|E
5|$|As a {{regional}} group in Bulgaria, Macedonians {{refers to the}} inhabitants of <b>Bulgarian</b> Macedonia, who in their vast majority self-identify as Bulgarians at a national level and as Macedonians at {{a regional}}, but not ethnic level. As of 2001, {{the total population of}} <b>Bulgarian</b> Macedonia is 341,245, while the ethnic Macedonians living in the same region are 3,117. The <b>Bulgarian</b> Macedonians also self-identify as Piriners (пиринци, pirintsi) to avoid confusion with the neighboring ethnic group.|$|E

50|$|Because some <b>Bulgarians</b> are not Canadian citizens, {{others are}} dual citizens, and still others' {{ancestors}} {{have come to}} Canada several generations ago, {{some of these people}} consider themselves to be simply Canadians, <b>Bulgarians,</b> <b>Bulgarians</b> living in Canada or Canadian <b>Bulgarians.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Bulgarians</b> in Lithuania {{refers to}} ethnic <b>Bulgarians</b> living in Lithuania. It {{is a very}} small minority; {{according}} to the 2001 Census, only 171 people identified themselves as <b>Bulgarians.</b> The number has decreased since 1989, when Soviet 1989 census identified 237 <b>Bulgarians</b> in Lithuania.|$|R
5|$|At {{the head}} of his army, Simeon I marched from Preslav through the Balkan Mountains and the valley of the river Tundzha and besieged Adrianople. While the bulk of the <b>Bulgarian</b> forces were {{concentrated}} in Thrace, the Byzantines bribed the Serbian prince Pavle Branović, who was a <b>Bulgarian</b> protégé, to switch sides. The Bulgarians answered with a successful intervention in Serbia, easily gained control of the country and placed in power another <b>Bulgarian</b> candidate, Zaharija Pribisavljević. The conflict in Serbia distracted the <b>Bulgarian</b> military operations against the Byzantine Empire for the rest of 921.|$|E
5|$|Despite being outnumbered {{and poorly}} equipped, certain <b>Bulgarian</b> units offered fierce resistance, delaying the Entente advance in Zborsko. However, the {{collapse}} of the front line enabled the Allies to assault <b>Bulgarian</b> positions from multiple directions and eventually quell the last pockets of resistance. The Central Powers' defeat at the Dobro Pole {{played a role in the}} <b>Bulgarian</b> withdrawal from the war and opened the way for the subsequent capture of Vardar Macedonia.|$|E
5|$|In May 1916, the {{submarine}} {{was transferred to}} the <b>Bulgarian</b> Navy as Podvodnik No. 18 and commissioned in a ceremony that was attended by Crown Prince Boris and Prince Kiril. In <b>Bulgarian</b> service, {{the submarine}} patrolled the <b>Bulgarian</b> Black Sea coast and had encounters with Russian vessels on several occasions. After the war ended, the submarine was surrendered to France in February 1919 and scrapped at Bizerta in August 1921. However, in July 2011 Viceadmiral Manushev, Commander of the <b>Bulgarian</b> Navy, announced that the submarine, discovered in 2010 at the sea bottom near the town of Varna, is UB-8. Divers discovered manufacturer numbers and according to them the identity is confirmed.|$|E

5|$|On 7 November, Turgut Reis shelled <b>Bulgarian</b> troops around Tekirdağ. On 17 November, she {{supported}} the Ottoman III Corps by bombarding the attacking <b>Bulgarian</b> forces. The ship was aided by artillery observers ashore. The battleship's gunnery was largely ineffective, though {{it provided a}} morale boost for the besieged Ottoman army dug in at Çatalca. By 17:00, the <b>Bulgarian</b> infantry had largely been forced back to their starting positions, {{in part due to}} the psychological effect of the battleships' bombardment. On 22 November, Turgut Reis sortied from the Bosporus to cover the withdrawal of Hamidiye, which had been torpedoed by a <b>Bulgarian</b> torpedo boat earlier that morning.|$|E
5|$|Out {{of respect}} for Momchil, Kantakouzenos spared his wife, a <b>Bulgarian</b> woman he had {{captured}} during his conquest of Xanthi. He allowed her to flee to Bulgaria along with all of her property. However, it is unknown whether Momchil had any children from this marriage or a previous one, if any. Pavlov presents the hypothesis that Momchil's wife was a noblewoman from the <b>Bulgarian</b> capital Tarnovo, whom he married {{as part of an}} agreement with the <b>Bulgarian</b> court.|$|E
5|$|Saved {{from death}} by his cousin Gavril Radomir, the <b>Bulgarian</b> Emperor, in 976, Ivan Vladislav murdered him in October 1015 and seized the <b>Bulgarian</b> throne. Due to the desperate {{situation}} of the country following the decades-long war with the Byzantine Empire, and {{in an attempt to}} consolidate his position, he tried to negotiate truce with the Byzantine emperor Basil II. After the failure of the negotiations he continued the resistance, attempting unsuccessfully to push the Byzantines back. During his period of rule, Ivan Vladislav tried to strengthen the <b>Bulgarian</b> army, reconstructed many <b>Bulgarian</b> fortresses and even carried out a counter-offensive, but he died at the Battle of Dyrrhachium in 1018. After his death his widow, Empress Maria, the Patriarch and most of the nobility finally surrendered to Basil II, who soon suppressed the last remnants of resistance and brought {{about the end of the}} First <b>Bulgarian</b> Empire.|$|E

50|$|The {{fighting}} was hard in Saint Sofia, where sergeant Avatzos's unit had {{the task of}} capturing the <b>Bulgarians</b> who were {{holed up in the}} church. At one point in the battle the <b>Bulgarians</b> raised a white flag. As soon as the Cretans advanced in order to arrest them the <b>Bulgarians</b> started firing again, wounding two gendarmes. Then the Cretans assaulted with fixed bayonets and captured all the surviving <b>Bulgarians.</b>|$|R
5|$|The Byzantine army, led by Tzimiskes {{in person}} and {{numbering}} 30,000–40,000, advanced quickly and reached Preslav unmolested. The Rus' army was defeated in a battle before the city walls, and the Byzantines proceeded to lay siege. The Rus' and <b>Bulgarian</b> garrison under the Rus' noble Sphangel put up a determined resistance, but the city was stormed on 13 April. Among the captives were Boris II and his family, who were brought to Constantinople along with the <b>Bulgarian</b> imperial regalia. The main Rus' force under Sviatoslav withdrew before the imperial army towards Dorostolon on the Danube. As Sviatoslav feared a <b>Bulgarian</b> uprising, he had 300 <b>Bulgarian</b> nobles executed, and imprisoned many others. The imperial army advanced without hindrance; the <b>Bulgarian</b> garrisons of the various forts and strongholds along the way surrendered peacefully.|$|E
5|$|With {{the arrival}} of the Seven Slavic tribes and the Bulgars in the 6th–7th century and the {{establishment}} of the First <b>Bulgarian</b> Empire in 680 in the former lands of the Eastern Roman Empire (Byzantine Empire), the entire region was soon incorporated into the <b>Bulgarian</b> realm. After a period of renewed Byzantine rule in 1018–1185, {{it was part of the}} Second <b>Bulgarian</b> Empire until its conquest by the Ottomans in the late 14th or early 15th century.|$|E
5|$|A {{new round}} of snap {{elections}} in October 2014 resulted in a third GERB victory with around {{a third of the}} vote. A record of eight parties won seats, {{the first time since the}} beginning of democratic elections in 1990 that more than seven parties entered parliament. After being tasked by President Rosen Plevneliev to form a government, Borisov's GERB formed a coalition and members of the parties in the Reformist Bloc (Democrats for a Strong Bulgaria (DSB), Union of Democratic Forces (SDS), Bulgaria for Citizens Movement (DBG), Alternative for <b>Bulgarian</b> Revival and <b>Bulgarian</b> Agrarian National Union (BZNS)) were chosen for Minister positions. However, Boyko Borisov made a vow in 2016 – should GERB President nominee Tsetska Tsacheva does not win the <b>Bulgarian</b> presidential election, 2016, he would resign as a Prime Minister. GERB lost at this election from the independent candidate Rumen Radev who was, nevertheless, supported by the <b>Bulgarian</b> Socialist Party. Subsequently, Boyko Borisov resigned for the second time.|$|E
50|$|According to the 2011 census, {{there were}} 18,543 <b>Bulgarians</b> in Serbia.

5|$|According {{to local}} legend Marko's mother was Evrosiya (Евросия), {{sister of the}} <b>Bulgarian</b> voivoda Momchil (who ruled {{territory}} in the Rhodope Mountains). At Marko's birth three narecnitsi (fairy sorceresses) appeared, predicting {{that he would be}} a hero and replace his father (King Vukašin). When the king heard this, he threw his son into the river in a basket to get rid of him. A samodiva named Vila found Marko and brought him up, becoming his foster mother. Because Marko drank the samodivas milk, he acquired supernatural powers and became a <b>Bulgarian</b> freedom fighter against the Turks. He has a winged horse named Sharkolia ("dappled") and a stepsister, the samodiva Gyura. <b>Bulgarian</b> legends incorporate fragments of pagan mythology and beliefs, although the Marko epic was created as late as the 14–18th centuries. Among <b>Bulgarian</b> epic songs, songs about Krali Marko are common and pivotal.|$|E
5|$|According to the Ukrainian Census of 2001, ethnic Ukrainians {{comprised}} 62.8% of {{the population}} of Odessa Oblast, whilst ethnic Russians comprised 20.7%. Significant <b>Bulgarian</b> and Moldavian communities are present, centred on the historical region of Budjak. These comprised 6.1% and 5% {{of the population}} of Odessa Oblast respectively. 46.3% of the population reported that their native language was Ukrainian, whilst 41.9% reported that it was Russian. 11.8% specified other languages, mainly <b>Bulgarian</b> and Moldavian.|$|E

25|$|The <b>Bulgarians</b> {{under the}} command of Ivan Vladislav marched to the Byzantine camp. Basil II sent strong units under Diogenes to repulse the <b>Bulgarians</b> but the troops of the Byzantine {{commander}} were ambushed and cornered. To save Diogenes, the 60-year-old Byzantine Emperor moved on {{with the rest of his}} army. When the <b>Bulgarians</b> understood that they retreated chased by Diogenes. According to the Byzantine historian John Skylitzes the <b>Bulgarians</b> had many casualties and 200 were taken prisoners.|$|R
50|$|During {{the night}} of the 27th of November, the Serbs regrouped. In the morning, the <b>Bulgarians</b> {{continued}} their advance. The column of Major Gudzhev attacked the Šumadija Division and, despite being outnumbered 2 to 1, the <b>Bulgarians</b> managed to push the Serbs to the river Temska. The retreat of the Šumadija Division forced the Drina Division to pull back as well and the <b>Bulgarians</b> pursued after them. On the left flank, the <b>Bulgarians</b> were also successful and the Serbs were defeated.|$|R
5|$|After his {{conquest of}} Bulgaria, Basil II {{prevented}} revolts and discontent by retaining {{the rule of}} the local nobility and by relieving the newly conquered lands of the obligation to pay taxes in gold, allowing them to be paid in kind instead. He also allowed the <b>Bulgarian</b> Patriarchate to retain its autocephalous status and all its dioceses, but reduced it to an archbishopric. After his death Byzantine domestic policies changed and a series of unsuccessful rebellions broke out, the largest being led by Peter Delyan. In 1185 Asen dynasty nobles Ivan Asen I and Peter IV organised a major uprising which resulted in the re-establishment of the <b>Bulgarian</b> state. Ivan Asen and Peter laid the foundations of the Second <b>Bulgarian</b> Empire with Tarnovo as the capital.|$|E
5|$|After the {{surprise}} death of Malamir in 836, the <b>Bulgarian</b> throne passed to Presian I (836–852), who too was likely underage. As {{evidenced by the}} Presian Inscription from Philippi, Isbul retained his position as kavhan and his decisive influence in the <b>Bulgarian</b> court. In 837, the Slavic tribe of the Smolyani (Smolenoi), who inhabited the lower Nestos (Mesta) River and Western Thrace near Drama, rose against their Byzantine rulers. The inscription of Philippi mentions large-scale <b>Bulgarian</b> activity in the lands of the Smolyani. The <b>Bulgarian</b> forces were led by Isbul, {{as well as the}} ichirgu-boil (commander of the capital garrison) and the head priest. As the inscription is damaged, it is unclear who Presian and Isbul supported in that conflict. However, during this campaign the <b>Bulgarian</b> army conquered most of Macedonia including Philippi, where the inscription was found. From that point on, Isbul disappears from the sources, and there is no information about the date and circumstances of his death.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{engagement}} {{did not end}} the First <b>Bulgarian</b> Empire, the Battle of Kleidion reduced its ability to resist Byzantine advances and can be considered the pivotal encounter of the war with Byzantium. The heirs of Samuel could not subsequently hold off the Byzantine advance, and in 1018 the <b>Bulgarian</b> Empire was finally destroyed by Basil II.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{will ask}} why I speak of {{breaking}} {{away from the}} <b>Bulgarians</b> when in the past we have even called ourselves <b>Bulgarians</b> {{and when it is}} generally accepted that unification creates strength, and not separation. And, anyway, what sort of new Macedonian nation can this be when we and our fathers and grandfathers and great-grandfathers have always been called <b>Bulgarians?</b> ...|$|R
30|$|Polish {{migrants}} {{have jobs}} after migration {{more often than}} they did in Poland, but that is mainly because a proportion of them were still at school before migration. The vast majority of the other Polish migrants had work in Poland before migrating. <b>Bulgarians</b> have a job after migrating more often than before migrating, although the proportion with a job is still very low (approximately half). Why the <b>Bulgarians</b> have a so much lower labour market participation remains unclear. However, an overview of the occupations in which the <b>Bulgarians</b> work, mainly in cleaning, construction and food and beverage sector, suggests that informal work is common. Engbersen et al. (2011) showed that many <b>Bulgarians</b> in their study had informal contracts. It might have been the case that <b>Bulgarians</b> working in the informal sector were not willing to give information on them holding this job position. If this indeed is the case, then the occupational status of <b>Bulgarians</b> is probably overestimated, and will the decline in status for the <b>Bulgarians</b> have been more sharply. Yet the labour market position of <b>Bulgarians</b> in the Netherlands can be described as worrying because a high proportion of even those migrants who came in order to work report {{that they do not have}} a job in the Netherlands. Work permits were introduced in order to regulate the influx of migrants from the new accession countries. The measure does not appear to have constrained migration by <b>Bulgarians</b> without work, however; even worse, it poses a serious obstacle for jobless <b>Bulgarians</b> in the Netherlands to finding (formal) employment. A multi-migrant group to more destination countries perspective should provide more insight in the consequences of these specific labour market regulations. Based on our findings, we anticipate that the scrapping of the work permit in January 2014 will have contributed to the labour market integration of <b>Bulgarians</b> in the Netherlands, by increasing their (formal) labour participation rate.|$|R
