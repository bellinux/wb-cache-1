50|$|The {{softness}} of carbon brushes permits direct radial end-contact with the commutator without {{damage to the}} segments, permitting easy reversal of rotor direction, without the need to reorient the <b>brush</b> <b>holders</b> for operation in the opposite direction. Although never reversed, common appliance motors that use wound rotors, commutators and brushes have radial-contact brushes. In {{the case of a}} reaction-type carbon <b>brush</b> <b>holder,</b> carbon <b>brushes</b> may be reversely inclined with the commutator so that the commutator tends to push against the carbon for firm contact.|$|R

40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} a <b>holder</b> <b>assembly</b> for cooperating with an environmental cell (101) and an electron microscope, the environmental cell showing a fluid inlet (103), the electron microscope showing a vacuum wall (110) for separating an evacuable {{part of the}} electron microscope from {{the outside of the}} electron microscope, the <b>holder</b> <b>assembly</b> comprising an electron microscope interface for forming a sealing interface with the electron microscope, the <b>holder</b> <b>assembly</b> comprising an environmental cell interface for forming a sealing interfacing with the fluid inlet (103) of the environmental cell (101), and the <b>holder</b> <b>assembly</b> comprising a tube (126) for connecting a fluid supply to the fluid inlet (103) of the environmental cell (101), characterized in that the <b>holder</b> <b>assembly</b> comprises a first and a second part, the first part detachable from the second part, the first part comprising the tube (126) and the environmental cell interface and the second part comprising the electron microscope interface, as a result of which the first part can be cleaned at high temperatures without exposing the second part to said high temperature. By forming the <b>holder</b> <b>assembly</b> from to detachable parts, one part can be cleaned by heating it to a high temperature of, for example, 1000 DEG C, clogging in the tubes can be removed by reduction of carbon, while keeping the other part (often comprising mechanical fittings, ball bearing, sliders, or such like) cool. The cleaning can be enhanced by blowing, for example, oxygen or hydrogen through the tubes. QN/Quantum NanoscienceApplied Science...|$|R

50|$|A {{spring is}} {{typically}} {{used with the}} brush, to maintain constant contact with the commutator. As the brush and commutator wear down, the spring steadily pushes the brush downwards towards the commutator. Eventually the brush wears small and thin enough that steady contact {{is no longer possible}} or it is no longer securely held in the <b>brush</b> <b>holder,</b> and so the brush must be replaced.|$|R

50|$|When a commutated motor or {{generator}} uses {{more power}} than a single brush is capable of conducting, an <b>assembly</b> of several <b>brush</b> <b>holders</b> is mounted in parallel {{across the surface of}} the very large commutator.

40|$|The {{electro-optic}} {{properties of}} lanthanum-modified {{lead zirconate titanate}} (PLZT) ferroelectric ceramic material are evaluated when utilized as a variable density and/or spectral filter {{in conjunction with a}} television scanning system. Emphasis was placed on the development of techniques and procedures for processing the PLZT disks and for applying efficient electrode structures. A number of samples were processed using different combinations of cleaning, electrode material, and deposition process. Best overall performance resulted from the direct evaporation of gold over chrome electrodes. A ruggedized mounting <b>holder</b> <b>assembly</b> was designed, fabricated, and tested. The assembly provides electrical contacts, high voltage protection, and support for the fragile PLZT disk, and permits mounting and optical alignment of the associated polarizers.

40|$|Ever {{since its}} development, the {{induction}} motor has been mainly used for constant speed application. Three phase squirrel cage induction motors {{have been widely}} preferred due to simplicity, robustness and maintenance free operation. However, in variable speed applications, preference is always given to dc motors. The reason for using separately exited dc motor as a variable speed drives is the simplicity in control as {{the field and the}} armature current are electrically decoupled from each other. However the main problem with dc motor is the maintenance of commutators, <b>brushes</b> and <b>brush</b> <b>holders.</b> The rapid developments in power electronics and powerful digital signal processor (DSPs) have made the implementation of new control schemes possible to realiz...|$|R

50|$|Like {{his successors}} after him, the company founder Ludwig Schunk {{endeavored}} {{to expand and}} shore up his company through diversification into related fields of technology. To that end, he in 1923 acquired a carbon <b>brush</b> <b>holder</b> factory and integrated it into his operations in Heuchelheim. In 1932 the production of sintered bearings was started. The carbon orientation had already previously been expanded with products for mechanical applications. The increasingly difficult economic environment could not prevent Ludwig Schunk's life work from advancing. As the Reichsmark lost ever more of its value and the concomitant heavy inflation increased as well, Schunk successfully sought new sales markets abroad from which stable currency flowed in. By boosting his export business he succeeded in avoiding losses of real assets for his company.|$|R

50|$|The early 1990s {{recession}} severely {{affected the}} company, especially in its main market, Europe. The difficult situation led to Groupe Pechiney to seek divest of Carbone Lorraine's stock. In 1995, Pechiney sold a 21 percent stake to Paribas Affaires Industrielles. Carbone Lorraine was starting {{the recovery process}} and in the following years strengthened its electrical components sector by purchasing UGIMAG and Dietrich of Germany, which converted it in the European leader in electric motor's <b>brush</b> <b>holders.</b> During the next years, {{the expansion of the}} company continued, with the acquisitions of ferrite magnet divisions of Philips and ITT-Automotive and the American corrosion resistant materials' manufacturer Autocosmos. At the same time, Paribas sold its shares and the company became independent, with a large percentage of its stock on free float.

5000|$|Twin Pagodas (Chinese:苏州双塔) {{lie in the}} Dinghui Temple Lane in {{the southeastern}} corner of the city proper of Suzhou. They are artistic and natural as they are close at hand.

It is charming that the {{exquisite}} and straight Twin Pagoda look like two inserted writing brushes. There was originally a single-storey house with three rooms just like a writing <b>brush</b> <b>holder</b> with the shadows of the two pagodas reclining on its roof at sunset.
