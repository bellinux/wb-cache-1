The workshop introduced these measurement development initiatives, the measures created and the NIH-supported resource (Assessment Center) for internet or tablet-based test administration and scoring. Presentations covered item response theory and assessment of test <b>bias,</b> <b>construction</b> of item banks and computerized adaptive testing, and the different ways in which qualitative analyses contribute to the definition of construct domains and the refinement of outcome constructs. The panel discussion included questions about representativeness of samples and the assessment of cultural bias. © 2013 Expert Reviews Ltd...|$|E
40|$|A {{research}} program has investigated {{the use of}} the von Schlippe string-type tire model for predicting the dynamic behavior of aircraft tires. The transfer-function method was used for theory evaluation. A more flexible two-constant modification to the string theory tire model is presented. Experiments were conducted on four types of scale model aircraft tires. Two types were of conventional <b>bias</b> <b>construction,</b> one type was an isotropic toroid, and one type was of unbelted radial construction. The conventional string theory and model gave predictions that were in good agreement with experimental data for bias constructed tires. The two-constant modification to string theory provided better agreement between predictions and experiment for the unconventional tires. The results indicate that the string theory tire model using static and slow-rolling tire properties predicts dynamic aircraft tire properties that have the same trends as the measured dynamic properties and, in most cases, provides good quantitative agreement...|$|E

I took two aims - first, {{to find out if}} any opinion inclination or political orientation is expressed in articles about Czech governments published in the periodical Tyden, second, to compare media image of all three governments among themselves and to trace potential differences. The theoretical section focuses on objectivity and <b>bias,</b> <b>construction</b> and representation. Substantial part of the theory is comprised of specific political communication and mediatisation together with trends in this field recognized in last decades. The empirical section is composed by quantitative analysis that compares representative articles and it is added by an content analysis of front pages of the periodical Tyden. Regardless of a fact, that the Jan Fischer government was very popular in public, the media picture of this particular government is rather negative comparing others. On the contrary there were found specific features showing that the Mirek Topolanek government was pictured more substantially. In generally the periodical Tyden uses negativity and stereotypes in articles about governments but in no case this is a predominant procedure of media products construct.

40|$|A {{particular}} {{version of}} Rwanda’s pre-colonial Iron Age past was constructed during colonial rule and {{influenced by a}} racial world-view. This ethnicised and racialised past was used by successive Rwandan rulers to divide the population along newcomer/latecomer lines and eventually became a central tenet of the propaganda {{that contributed to the}} genocide in Rwanda in 1994. More recently this racial presentation of Rwanda’s past has since been successfully deconstructed by social historians such as Mamdani (2002), Chrétien (2003), Eltringham (2004) Vansina (2004 and Newbury (2009), and {{has been shown to be}} a heavily <b>biased</b> <b>construction</b> based on colonial values. Yet, the ethno-racial presentation of the past continues to be problematic for history education in Rwanda. This thesis follows on from the work of these authors. It suggests that archaeology can usefully engage with contemporary political contexts, involving the deconstruction and reconstruction of Rwanda’s pre-colonial past in a climate of reconciliation. Following this introduction this thesis explores the concept of ethnicity in relation to Rwandan archaeology before reconsidering the tangible evidence for the Iron Age in Rwanda through a critical review of the existing literature. Furthermore, through the application of a politically aware and sensitive theoretical and methodological framework, this thesis explores non-ethno-racial historical narratives in pre-colonial Rwanda through a new body of archaeological data generated during twelve months of recent fieldwork in southern, central and northern Rwanda. Finally this thesis concludes with a summary of the archaeological outcomes of this research and some speculation on future research directions. ...|$|R

All these together eventually conformed a “dual economy”, with some large firms highly productive and competitive in international markets, and a large number of small and medium sized firms with low productivity and low growth potential.|$|R

40|$|The new 2 ̆ 2 ontological 2 ̆ 2 work of {{professional}} and management education attempts to incorporate critical pedagogy to stimulate 2 ̆ 2 critical self-reflection 2 ̆ 2 by students to help stimulate more 2 ̆ 2 mindful 2 ̆ 2 interaction. Many graduate classrooms and professional seminars have significantly increased {{their use of}} experiential and discussion-oriented learning methods to accomplish these goals. The underlying assumption being that if {{students are encouraged to}} experience or recall problematic situations, they will use these 2 ̆ 2 mindful moments 2 ̆ 2 to consider other perspectives and, in turn, become more accepting of, comfortable with, and socially effective in diverse contexts. However, both my personal experience and academic literature suggest that participants construct reflections of problematic events in ways that present a positive construction of self and negative construction of problematic others and/or events. This study attempts to quantifiably identify the degree to which self-serving constructions influence professional and management students 2 ̆ 7 critical self-reflections. ^ It seems reasonable to suggest that if students maintain a strong self-serving <b>bias</b> in their <b>constructions</b> of self and others in everyday problematic events, then {{it would be helpful to}} determine if and how our pedagogy impacts this bias. Encouraging students to recognize and accept the possibility of multiple social constructions does not ensure that students actually allow others 2 ̆ 7 point of views to be the accepted version when ultimately making sense of perceived 2 ̆ 2 problematic 2 ̆ 2 events. In fact, just the opposite could be true; the ability to recognize and analyze multiple perspectives may give students a false sense of self-criticality when ultimately defending their, own <b>biased</b> <b>constructions</b> of self and other. ^ Strong tendencies of bias raise questions about how we teach 2 ̆ 2 critical self-reflection 2 ̆ 2 and to what degree we actually minimize self-serving constructions of everyday problematic events. The paper suggests that most professional and management education programs take an informational, social psychological approach to understanding problematic events. This approach makes it difficult for students to recognize the social constructionist nature of difference and perceived problematic interactions. ^ Although, a few programs do incorporate methods more consistent with a communication or constructionist approach, they only report an increase in awareness of multiple constructions. The tendency for self-serving constructions to minimize openness to multiple perspectives has not been investigated. The paper concludes with a few questions about the current practice of critical pedagogy in professional and management education. ...|$|R

40|$|Ant colony {{optimisation}} is {{a constructive}} metaheuristic in which solutions are built probabilistically {{influenced by the}} parameters of a pheromone model—an analogue of the trail pheromones used by real ants when foraging for food. Recent studies have uncovered the presence of biases in the solution construction process, the existence and nature of which depend {{on the characteristics of}} the problem being solved. The presence of these solution <b>construction</b> <b>biases</b> induces biases in the pheromone model used, so selecting an appropriate model is highly important.

The article addresses them by highlighting three main characteristics of the Spanish economy in the pre-crisis period: (1) a composition of economic activity increasingly <b>biased</b> towards <b>construction,</b> real state, and other non-tradeable sectors, (2) a banking system that was able to satisfy the huge increase in credit demand arising from households and firms, in a context of very low real interest rates, excessive optimism about growth, and large facilities for using real assets as loan collateral, and (3) the recourse to external funding that originated an unprecedented increase in liabilities with respect {{to the rest of the}} world.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this essay is to examine if {{theories}} that derive from Comparative Religion {{can be applied to}} horror films. Can theories such as Victor Turner ’s liminal stages or Mary Douglas’ theories on anomalies clarify, to some extent, why horror movies construct unholy scenarios where filth and the breaking of taboo is essential, or why monsters tend to dwell in, as well as being, a liminal phase or a grey area? Can these theories shed some light on why monsters tend to be twofold? We also aim to examine how gender roles are constructed and portrayed in horror films. As a means of reaching our agenda we have chosen four horror films in a span of ten years, between 1984 - 1994.

The algorithm is based on simulating first arrival times in a doubly stochastic Poisson process using the thinning method, and allows efficient sampling of Bayesian posteriors in big datasets. We prove that in the BPS no bias is introduced by noisy evaluations of the log-likelihood gradient. On the other hand, we argue that efficiency considerations favor a small, controllable <b>bias</b> in the <b>construction</b> of the thinning proposals, in exchange for faster mixing.
