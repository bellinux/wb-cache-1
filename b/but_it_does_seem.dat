25|$|Awareness {{in species}} is {{difficult}} to determine. Learned behaviors that have been demonstrated in laboratories have provided good evidence that animals have instinct and a reward system. The behavior of laboratory animals demonstrates a mental experience wherein the animal's instincts tell it if it carries out a certain action, it will then receive what it needs. For example, the lab rat will push the lever because it knows food will {{fall out of the}} hole in the wall. It doesn’t need awareness, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>seem</b> to work on a reward system. The lab rat learned the action needed to be fed.|$|E
25|$|In June 2004 {{the first}} {{performances}} for about 70 years {{took place in}} the theatre, first in its foyer then in July in the theatre itself. Although conditions were far from ideal, the audience was able to see the potential of this very large space – originally seating 3,000, it cannot currently be licensed for {{more than a couple of}} hundred. It is intended that the theatre will one day reopen, but much costly restoration will be required first. It will never again reach a seating capacity of 3,000 (not least because one balcony was removed in the early part of the 20th century as a fire precaution, when films started to be shown there), <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>seem</b> likely that a capacity of more than 1,000 may one day be achieved. A major season of the theatre company Complicite was planned for 2005 but the project, which would have included some repair and access work, was cancelled due to higher-than-anticipated costs.|$|E
500|$|After all, {{the carpet}} {{was only one}} of a number of disputed items, and the real issue lay not in the mere money value of these things, but in whether Carte could be trusted with the {{financial}} affairs of Gilbert and Sullivan. Gilbert contended that Carte had at best made a series of serious blunders in the accounts, and at worst deliberately attempted to swindle the others. It is not easy to settle the rights and wrongs of the issue at this distance, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>seem</b> fairly clear that there was something very wrong with the accounts at this time. Gilbert wrote to Sullivan on 28 May 1891, a year after the end of the [...] "Quarrel", that Carte had admitted [...] "an unintentional overcharge of nearly £1,000 in the electric lighting accounts alone." ...|$|E

2500|$|During the 2010–11 season, Young became vice-captain of {{the club}} and played in a new free role behind the striker, {{allowing}} him to move from wing to wing and through the centre. Young scored his first goal of the 2010–11 season with a direct free-kick in the Premier League match at home to Bolton Wanderers on 18 September 2010. He ended the season with nine goals and fourteen assists in 39 appearances for Villa in all competitions. With one year left to run on his current contract, Young stated {{that he would not}} make a decision on his future {{until the end of the}} season. On 20 June 2011, new Villa manager Alex McLeish admitted that he was resigned to losing Young, stating, [...] "It's not confirmed yet <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>seem</b> likely." ...|$|E
2500|$|De Mello, with Grant Govan, {{was also}} {{instrumental}} in founding the Cricket Club of India (CCI). As for BCCI, De Mello {{served as the}} founder secretary. Delhi was planned as the headquarters and location of the ground for the club, but it was eventually set up in Bombay (now Mumbai). Guha [...] considers this as an attempt {{on the part of}} De Mello and Grant Govan to shift the headquarters of cricket in India from Bombay, but the book brought out by the CCI for the Golden Jubilee of the Brabourne Stadium [...] attributes this to the non-availability of land in Bombay. <b>But</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>seem</b> that De Mello played a prominent role in selecting the site and convincing Lord Brabourne, the Governor of Bombay, to allot the land for the stadium at a cheap rate.|$|E
6000|$|Under the {{influence}} of this threat he spoke. [...] "Well," [...] said he, [...] "I should not feel warranted in calling you a flirt, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>seem</b> {{to me that you}} have been flirting." ...|$|E
60|$|Our {{intercourse}} {{ended in}} a quarrel. No doubt it was my fault. <b>But</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> <b>seem</b> to me that Great-grandfather, who {{had been one of}} the greatest English lawyers of his day, might have handed out an opinion.|$|R
60|$|I couldn't help {{thinking}} {{that it would be}} rather a fine thing to <b>do,</b> <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> <b>seem</b> rather foolish to risk our necks to get over the walls at night, when we could walk in, whenever we pleased, all day.|$|R
50|$|In The Worlds of Science Fiction, {{the author}} wroteIt's quite unlike {{anything}} else I've done...I have no pretensions {{to being a}} Kafka or a Capek, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> <b>seem</b> to me <b>it</b> {{would be interesting to}} use, or attempt to use, some of their techniques.|$|R
6000|$|... "But, say, I wish I could 've let {{her know}} I was going earlier, Miss Zapp. I didn't know it myself, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>seem</b> like a mean trick. I s'pose I ought to pay her {{something}} extra." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'And no wonder,' said Lancelot; 'at all events, I {{should not}} {{think they got}} much of it. <b>But</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>seem</b> strange that no other {{amusement}} can be found for them than the beer-shop.

60|$|Bertie Stanhope was not {{prone to}} be very diffident of his own {{conversational}} powers, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> <b>seem</b> {{to him that he}} was about to tax them almost too far. He hardly knew where to begin, and he hardly knew where he should end.|$|R
50|$|In March 1984, then-Terre Haute mayor P. Pete Chalos {{threatened}} {{to condemn the}} hotel property {{in an attempt to}} force the Hulman family into selling it.

5000|$|He is a circumspect {{fellow and}} clearly {{to this day}} has no wish to anger Blinky. Thus, though he told how Blinky brought him offer after offer to throw fights for bribes as big as $100,000, he insisted that Blinky advised him to turn the offers down. It was a fatherly picture <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> <b>seem</b> out of character.|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't judge without evidence. <b>But</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>seem</b> as if {{the water}} at the well at Pettitt's houses had done much of the harm.

6000|$|... "You {{always were}} a lucky little dog, Steve. I don't begrudge you a {{particle}} of your happiness, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>seem</b> as if things weren't quite fair sometimes," [...] said Archie, suppressing an envious sigh, for, though he seldom complained, {{it was impossible}} to contrast his own and his cousin's prospects with perfect equanimity.|$|E

60|$|I may be mistaken, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>seem</b> {{to me that}} Deerslayer is not {{a work of art}} in any sense; it {{does seem}} to me that it is {{destitute}} of every detail that goes to the making of a work of art; in truth, {{it seems to me that}} Deerslayer is just simply a literary delirium tremens.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, really!" [...] said Lillie, in a dry, cool tone, [...] "I {{suppose it}} was very good of you, {{perfectly}} saint-like and all that; <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>seem</b> a great pity.

6000|$|... "Judas! <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> <b>seem</b> {{nice and}} familiar. It {{was all so}} green and flowery after camp.

Say, it nearly had me snifflin'. It sure did." ...|$|R
6000|$|When he {{came down}} to the drawing-room, Anna in her moonlight-coloured frock was sitting on the sofa talking to--Sylvia. He kept away from them; they could neither of them want him. <b>But</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> <b>seem</b> odd to him, who knew not too much {{concerning}} women, that she could be talking so gaily, when only half an hour ago she had said: [...] "Is it that girl?" ...|$|R

60|$|<b>But</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>seem</b> hard on Raleigh, {{after having}} laboured in this Guiana {{business}} for years, and after having spent his money in vain attempts to deliver these Guianians from their oppressors.

40|$|The Hindu has {{no sense}} of history', said Mr Ratan on my last evening in Bombay. It was not a new {{statement}} since I had been reminded of it many times before.
