50|$|Conditions {{that affect}} the {{installed}} stress arise through lots of activities. It is accepted that any action that disturbs the ballast, track components, geometry and rails will affect the 'Critical Rail Temperature' and cause {{the stability of the}} track to be subject to adverse thermal forces. A typical example would be when a piece of rail has been removed due to a defect, or when an Insulated <b>block</b> <b>joint</b> (IBJ) is to be replaced. In cases such as these, the stressing engineer would ensure that the old rail is measured and marked with 'TellTale' indicators on the foot of the rail at the extremities of the replaced length. The rail would then be 'Flame Cut', and the clips securing it to the sleepers/ties are removed starting at the point of the cut outward to the limit of renewal. The existing defective rail is then cut out and movement at the 'tell tales' noted for re-instatement. The stressing engineer will then calculate the 'Original Stress free temperature' of the removed section and determine how much stress, if any has been lost and needs replacing. The new rail is fitted and welded at one end. The new rail is then cut to suit the Calculated length and a stressing kit is then fitted at the end still to be welded. The kit is clamped to the rail and it pulls the gap together, leaving enough space for a second weld. Once the rail is stressed to the appropriate temperature the weld is made. After setting the weld and an appropriate cooling period of time has elapsed, the stress kit is removed.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACTDuring ship design, welding-induced distortions {{are roughly}} {{estimated}} {{as a function}} of the size of the component as well as the welding process and residual stresses are assumed to be locally in the range of the yield stress. Existing welding simulation methods are very complex and time-consuming and therefore not applicable to large structures like ships. Simplified methods for the estimation of welding effects were and still are subject of several research projects, but mostly concerning smaller structures. The main goal of this paper is the application of a multi-layer welding simulation to the <b>block</b> <b>joint</b> of a ship structure. When welding block joints, high constraints occur due to the ship structure which are assumed to result in accordingly high residual stresses. Constraints measured during construction were realized in a test plant for small-scale welding specimens in order to investigate their and other effects on the residual stresses. Associated welding simulations were successfully performed with fine-mesh finite element models. Further analyses showed that a courser mesh was also able to reproduce the welding-induced reaction forces and hence the residual stresses after some calibration. Based on the coarse modeling it was possible to perform the welding simulation at a <b>block</b> <b>joint</b> in order to investigate the influence of the resulting residual stresses on the behavior of the real structure, showing quite interesting stress distributions. Finally it is discussed whether smaller and idealized models of definite areas of the <b>block</b> <b>joint</b> can be used to achieve the same results offering possibilities to consider residual stresses in the design process...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{the factors}} {{controlling}} the deformation of drystone retaining walls are investigated {{by means of}} discrete element analyses. It is shown that toppling failure of unweathered drystone retaining walls is {{likely to occur in}} a brittle manner, with wall crest deflections not exceeding 1 % of the backtill height until the factor of safety (based on soil strength) falls below 1. 05. A compressible sub-base and weathering of the blocks will both tend to reduce the backfill height at failure to below that indicated by a limit equilibrium analysis. Bulging failure {{is more likely to be}} associated with a deterioration in <b>block</b> <b>joint</b> stiffness due to weathering than a compressible sub-base, although the latter will decrease the reduction in joint stiffness needed to cause bulging failure. Bulging is much less brittle than toppling, and the proximity to failure of bulging walls could in some circumstances be assessed on the basis of the size of the bulge...|$|E

40|$|This paper proposes {{and compares}} four <b>block</b> <b>joint</b> {{detection}} algorithms for the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) -code {{division multiple access}} (CDMA) communication systems. The performance of the proposed OFDM-CDMA joint detectors with orthogonal and non-orthogonal spreading sequences are investigated in mobile radio channels. The proposed OFDM-CDMA detectors are zero forcing (ZF) and {{minimum mean square error}} (MMSE) detectors with decision feedback (DF) structures. The proposed joint detectors do not require discrete Fourier transform (DFT) or fast Fourier transform (FFT) operations and can be used to compensate the channel distortion. Hence for hardware implementation, the proposed detectors are more efficient than the conventional methods. The channel sorting method offers approximately 2 dB gain for the DF joint detectors and reduces the impairing effect of error propagation. The bit error rate (BER) performance of orthogonal codes is better than that of non-orthogonal ones in time varying channels. Simulation examples are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed detectors. (C) 2009 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} a central estimating officer (CEO) scenario, where sensors observe a noisy {{version of a}} binary sequence generated by a single hidden source (the phenomenon). Distributed source coding is not used; rather, the correlation is exploited at the access point (AP), whose goal is to estimate, by properly fusing the data received through AWGN or block fading channels, this sequence. We assume that each node uses a classical channel code to transmit its information to the AP, where decoding is followed by fusion. In the decoding <b>block,</b> <b>joint</b> channel decoding (JCD) or separate channel decoding (SCD) are considered: in the former case, correlation is exploited in the decoding process, whereas {{in the latter case}} it is not. We first investigate the ultimate achievable performance limits with JCD (i. e., considering the multiple access channel), in terms of: (i) feasible capacity region in the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel case; (ii) outage feasible capacity region, in block faded channel case. This analysis provides preliminary insights on the impact of the number of observations. Then, we investigate the overall system performance in terms of bit error rate (BER), probability of outage (only in the block faded case), and probability of decision error (after fusion) ...|$|E
40|$|An {{insulated}} <b>block</b> <b>joint</b> (IBJ) is {{a mechanical}} joint which joins two abutting railway rails whilst keeping them electrically separate from each other. They {{are an integral}} component of block signalling systems as they allow for train detection within the network, however, they are a weak point in the system where failures can occur. The aims of this research work were to develop test regimes to enable life cycle analysis of IBJs and use these tests to assess the performance of different materials and designs. This has been achieved {{by the use of}} specimen, component and full assembly level testing. Specimen and component level shear testing has been carried out which has allowed for the assessment of different glues and insulating materials that are used in an IBJ and also has tested differing design principles. These experiments have been monitored using ultrasound techniques to investigate how failures within the insulating materials occur. It has been found that by using a full fit design with a glass fibre lining material an improvement in the shear strength of the IBJ can be obtained in comparison to a standard UK design. A full scale testing regime was developed in order to cyclically load assembled IBJs and compare a new joint design with the standard design. The new test method enabled testing of the IBJs to failure and gave a good comparison between two joints. Ultrasonic monitoring techniques have been implemented based on knowledge gained in component level testing which has allowed for the assessment of de-bonding within the IBJs as the test is carried out. Further specimen and full scale testing was carried out and a novel test regime was used to experimentally model lipping, the plastic flow of steel over the end of an IBJ causing electrical failure. This test regime allowed for the testing of different materials in both the endpost and the rail. By using a hardened rail steel or a hardened laser clad layer on the running surface of the rail it has been found that lipping performance can be improved greatly. The work has {{led to the development of}} a new design of IBJ that incorporates material and design changes and aims to increase the life cycle of the IBJ by increasing static and dynamic stiffness and improving the rail material with respect to lipping performance. Further work on in service testing of laser cladding technology could be performed to further the work that has been achieved using twin disc testing...|$|E

5000|$|Plucking, also {{referred}} to as quarrying, is a glacial phenomenon that is responsible for the erosion and transportation of individual pieces of bedrock, especially large [...] "joint blocks".

The freezing and thawing action of the ice enlarges, widens, or causes further cracks in the bedrock as it changes volume across the ice/water phase transition (a form of hydraulic wedging), gradually loosening the rock between the joints. This produces large pieces of rock called <b>joint</b> <b>blocks.</b> Eventually these <b>joint</b> <b>blocks</b> come loose and become trapped in the glacier.|$|R

To understand the mechanism of this essential genome maintenance event, we analyzed the structure of RAD 51 –DNA complexes representing strand exchange intermediates at nanometer resolution by scanning force microscopy. Joint molecules were formed between substrates with a defined ssDNA segment and homologous region on a double-stranded (ds) partner.
