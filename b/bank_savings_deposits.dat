This is evidence that excess sensitivity of consumption in aggregate US data is driven {{to a large extent}} by US-wide effects since, in the aggregate, demand. Ordering states by the persistence of income shocks, we find that removal states by the same amount and that the excess sensitivity of consumption is greater in states with more persistent income shocks. We also find that state-specific disposable income and consumption exhibit excess smoothness in the sense of Campbell and to current state-specific income; in particular for positive shocks. Finally, we study patterns of consumption smoothing via <b>bank</b> <b>savings</b> <b>deposits</b> and loans. Our results point to credit market imperfections as the most plausible explanation for excess smoothness and the remaining excess sensitivity. ...|$|E

Originally, seven rating agencies were recognized as NRSROs, a number that dwindled {{as a result of}} mergers to six by the mid-1990s and then to three by 2003. [...] As of March 2015, ten organizations were designated as NRSROs.Ratings by NRSROs are used for a variety of regulatory purposes in the United States. In addition to net capital requirements (described in more detail below), the SEC permits certain bond issuers to use a shorter prospectus form when issuing bonds if the issuer is older, has issued bonds before, and has a credit rating above a certain level. SEC regulations also require that money market funds (mutual funds that mimic the safety and liquidity of a <b>bank</b> <b>savings</b> <b>deposit,</b> but without U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance) comprise only securities with a very high rating from an NRSRO. Likewise, insurance regulators use credit ratings from NRSROs to ascertain the strength of the reserves held by insurance companies.|$|R
