Michelle {{promises}} to obey Radu if he teaches her everything that he knows. Radu takes Michelle out hunting so she can enhance her powers, while Mel contacts a former operative of the CIA for help. While trying to rescue Michelle, Radu's mother quickly kills Mel's CIA friend, and knocks Mel unconscious. In an effort to get Michelle to stay with him forever, Radu kills his mother when she attacks Michelle. Becky arrives to save Michelle, but before everyone leaves, Michelle takes a gun from Becky, which contains silver bullets, and shoots Radu. The rising sun slows Michelle, so she is placed inside a <b>body</b> <b>bag</b> that was brought along; the delay allows Radu time to catch up to the group. Wanting the Bloodstone, which was taken by Michelle, Radu attempts to barter the group's lives in exchange for it. Becky throws it over the roof's edge, and when Radu attempts to follow it he is engulfed in the rays of the Sun. Radu's body bursts into flames and falls from the castle wall. Becky and the group make it to their car and drive off. Radu's burning corpse is left smoldering and impaled on tree branches, with his burning blood dropping to the ground; the flames go out and the blood morphs into new subspecies.|$|E

The <b>body</b> <b>bag</b> was placed on a white table at the rail of the ship, and the table was tipped to let the <b>body</b> <b>bag</b> slide into the sea, but the <b>body</b> <b>bag</b> did not slide and took the table with it.

50|$|<b>Body</b> <b>Bags</b> is an American {{comic book}} series created, written and {{illustrated}} by Jason Pearson.|$|R
5000|$|The initial series, simply {{entitled}} <b>Body</b> <b>Bags,</b> was {{a launch}} title for Dark Horse Comics' Blanc Noir line of books. Produced by Gaijin Studios in 1996, <b>Body</b> <b>Bags</b> includes {{a large amount}} of blood, violence and characters who enjoy killing and cursing, which is displayed in a number of scenes in the book that have been deemed [...] "shocking". Pearson's use of an extremely buxom 14-year-old girl caused the series to face a certain amount of controversy in the comics industry, thus <b>Body</b> <b>Bags</b> is promoted as [...] "the most controversial comic of the 1990s". The final issues of the series were delayed for several months because of Jason Pearson falling ill.|$|R

500|$|Actress Jasika Nicole {{explained}} in a May 2009 interview that the scariest episode for her {{at the time was}} [...] "Unleashed". She described the episode's production, [...] "The props people had these big buckets of earth worms, but they were thicker and meatier and longer. They had teeny little bitty faces... So the guy's chest is cut open and he’s been in make-up for hours {{to make it look like}} he’s been torn open and he’s all bloody and stuff. So then they pour these worms and this goopy, syrupy stuff and this fake blood onto this guy’s chest... We had to zip him up in the <b>body</b> <b>bag.</b> It takes a few minutes to get to 'action' after he's zipped up. We unzip him and we see the worms and it’s so gross–and the look on his face. The worms are crawling up and their in his armpits and starting to crawl toward his face and he can’t move at all because he’s supposed to be dead." [...] Nicole continued that this scene had to be shot [...] "three or four times. We kept trying to get faster and faster but we were all laughing [...] It was like a Fear Factor episode with no chance of getting money... It was so gross but so much fun. The guy was such a trooper." ...|$|E
500|$|The [...] "Dual Spires enhanced" [...] video at the Psych website lists further {{references}} to Twin Peaks. Shawn's name for Gus in this episode is [...] "Lodge Blackmunn", a direct {{reference to the}} Black and White Lodge. Leo the Cinnamon Owl is a reference to Killer BOB, who possessed Leland Palmer and often {{took the form of}} an owl. The sheriff's deputy is Deputy Frost, named after Twin Peaks co-creator Mark Frost. The doctors of both Dual Spires and Twin Peaks have coconuts in their offices. Both Paula's and Laura's diaries described meetings with [...] "J". Sheriff Jackson tells Bob he needs to be strong for his wife. Dr Hayward says the same thing to Leland Palmer in Twin Peaks. Upon entering the town Gus mentions that the residents are looking {{at him as if he}} were the first black man they had ever seen. There are very few black men in Twin Peaks. When they enter the Sawmill Diner Bob Barker says [...] "Top of the morning to you." [...] In the first season of Twin Peaks, Pete Martell corrected Josie Packard on the saying. Maudette wears an orchid in her hair; Harold grew orchids in Twin Peaks. In the library Shawn asks if they can [...] "poke around" [...] but he and Gus immediately say [...] "peek" [...] in correction. Thus [...] "peek", as in Twin Peaks, is spoken twice. A man wearing a hat in the Sawmill Diner gives Shawn and Gus a thumbs up. The older room service attendant did the same thing to Agent Cooper in Twin Peaks. A record player is featured prominently in both the Barker and Palmer homes. The Roadhouse was also a location in Twin Peaks. Both Maudette and Audrey Horne love to dance. Paula's friend Jack is completely blind in one eye, referencing Twin Peaks' brothel named [...] "One Eyed Jacks". In the library Shawn and Gus find a book entitled [...] "Putt Your Way to a Better Future." [...] After Leland Palmer killed Maddy Ferguson he was seen putting golf balls around in his living room. When Randy is using the table saw it resembles the sawmill scene from the extended opening credits of Twin Peaks. When Maudette is placed in the <b>body</b> <b>bag</b> it is bent in such a way that it resembles a smile, like the smiling bag clue Agent Cooper found. On Maudette's desk beside her computer is a roll of green tape like the kind used by Leland Palmer to tie up Jacques Renault. In the cabin Bob Barker lights a match and holds it up like Leland Palmer did when describing BOB to Agent Cooper. Bob Barker wears a gold ring on his pinky, something Agent Cooper did in Twin Peaks. In the cabin the walls are red with red drapes as an allusion to the [...] "Red Room" [...] in Agent Cooper's dream.|$|E

2500|$|Another {{game that}} is well-remembered by Eagles fans {{was known as}} [...] "The <b>Body</b> <b>Bag</b> Game", which took place on November 12, 1990, when the Washington Redskins visited the stadium for a Monday Night Football game. The Eagles' head coach at that time, Buddy Ryan, {{was quoted as saying}} that the Redskins' offense would [...] "have to be carted off in body bags." [...] The Eagles' number-one defense scored two touchdowns in a 28–14 win and knocked nine Redskin players out of the game, {{including}} both of their quarterbacks. The Redskins were forced to finish the game using running back/returner Brian Mitchell (who would become an Eagles player over a decade later) at quarterback.|$|E

2500|$|It {{was noted}} that Sabrie had been {{carrying}} a ceremonial dagger in his clothing. When the unit {{was ordered to}} bring the dead body of Arush be brought over to {{the same position as}} Sabrie, the soldiers radioed back that they couldn't move the body without it falling apart. So the body of Arush was loaded into a <b>body</b> <b>bag</b> and placed inside a Bison personnel carrier. There, medical technician MCpl Petersen re-opened the bag and took Polaroid photographs for an unknown reason, some suggest to document the shooting, others suggest as a [...] "trophy". [...] The photos showed gaping wounds in Arush's neck and the side of his face, with his skull twisted out of shape by the force of the gunblast. His intestines protruded from his stomach, and his right eye was missing.|$|E
2500|$|Since his {{killing in}} 2011, the U.S. media has {{reported}} that bin Laden was given a perfunctory naval funeral off the deck of an aircraft carrier, to prevent any gravesite from becoming a symbol of martyrdom. According to Hersh's account of the assassination, bin Laden's corpse {{never made it to}} the USS Carl Vinson, because it had been torn apart by automatic fire at point-blank range before the CIA took whatever shreds were left: [...] "Some members of the SEAL team had bragged to colleagues and others that they had torn bin Laden's body to pieces with rifle fire. The remains, including his head, which had only a few bullet holes in it, were thrown into a <b>body</b> <b>bag</b> and, during the helicopter flight back to Jalalabad, some body parts were tossed out over the Hindu Kush mountains." [...] And bin Laden's wives and children were never turned over to the Americans for questioning.|$|E

Gary loves the food and even Patrick loves it as well. Eventually, the door rings and SpongeBob answers but is stashed into a <b>body</b> <b>bag</b> shaped like a hot dog bun and taken back to the hot dog restaurant, where he is forced to work, because, as it turns out, the customers actually loved the weenie patties that SpongeBob created.
