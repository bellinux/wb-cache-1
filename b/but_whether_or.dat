In the city-state of Charondas' laws, an epikleros had {{to be given a}} dowry if her nearest kin did not wish to marry her. During the time of Alexander the Great, Tegean law deals with the inheritance of returning exiles, limiting them to inheriting only their paternal estate or an estate of their mother if she had become an epikleros while in exile. The city-states of Naupactus and Thermus allowed women to inherit property, <b>but</b> <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> not the daughters were considered epikleroi is unknown from the surviving fragments of the laws from those cities.|$|E

Duchamp's brothers did approach him with Gleizes' request, but Duchamp quietly refused. However, there was no jury at the Salon des Indépendants and Gleizes was in no position to reject the painting. The controversy, according to art historian Peter Brooke, was not whether the work should be hung or not, <b>but</b> <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> not it should be hung with the Cubist group.|$|E
25|$|Versions of {{the life}} of young Thaddeus vary. He was the second child in a family of five and was named Thaddeus Sobieski Constantine, more than likely after the {{character}} Thaddeus Constantine Sobieski (Tadeusz Kosciuszko) in an 1803 novel ‘’Thaddeus of Warsaw’’ by Scottish author Jane Porter. It is confused about his life around the age of ten whether his mother had died and Clovis married Mary Randall, or if Lowe was sent away to another farm during which time his mother died and his father remarried. He apparently did work for another farm owned by the Plaisted’s, <b>but</b> <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> not he lived there is uncertain. Clovis and Mary had seven more children, but there is a timeline confusion that may indicate she already had children when she married Clovis.|$|E
25|$|There have {{recently}} been discoveries of tortoise-shell carvings dating back to c. 6000 BC, like Jiahu Script, Banpo Script, <b>but</b> <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> not the carvings are complex enough to qualify as writing is under debate. At Damaidi in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, 3,172 cliff carvings dating to 6000–5000 BC have been discovered, featuring 8,453 individual characters, such as the sun, moon, stars, gods, and scenes of hunting or grazing. These pictographs are reputed {{to be similar to}} the earliest characters confirmed to be written Chinese. If it is deemed to be a written language, writing in China will predate Mesopotamian cuneiform, long acknowledged as the first appearance of writing, by some 2,000 years; however {{it is more likely that}} the inscriptions are rather a form of proto-writing, similar to the contemporary European Vinca script.|$|E

At Bachelor's Cottage, Sandringham, Albert Victor was expected to cram before arriving at university {{in the company of}} Dalton, French instructor Monsieur Hua, and a newly chosen tutor/companion James Kenneth Stephen. Some biographers have said that Stephen was a misogynist, although this has recently been questioned, and he may have felt emotionally attached to Albert Victor, <b>but</b> <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> not his feelings were overtly homosexual is open to question. Stephen was initially optimistic about tutoring the prince, {{but by the time the}} party were to move to Cambridge had concluded, [...] "I do not think he can possibly derive much benefit from attending lectures at Cambridge...

2500|$|It is {{possible}} that he chose Commodus simply {{in the absence of}} other candidates, or {{as a result of the}} fear of succession issues and the possibility of civil war. Michael Grant, in The Climax of Rome (1968), writes of Commodus: [...] "The youth turned out to be very erratic or at least so anti-traditional that disaster was inevitable. <b>But</b> <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> not Marcus ought to have known this to be so, the rejections of his son's claims in favour of someone else would almost certainly involved one of the civil wars which were to proliferate so disastrous around future successions." ...|$|E
2500|$|Following {{the arrest}} of several men in Britain in September 2004, on {{suspicion}} {{that they were trying}} to buy a kilogram of red mercury for £300,000, the International Atomic Energy Agency made a statement dismissing claims that the substance is real. [...] "Red mercury doesn't exist," [...] said the spokesman. [...] "The whole thing is a bunch of [...]" [...] When the case came to trial at the Old Bailey in April 2006, it became apparent that News of the Worlds [...] "fake sheikh" [...] Mazher Mahmood had worked with the police to catch the three men, Dominic Martins, Roque Fernandes and Abdurahman Kanyare. They were tried for [...] "trying to set up funding or property for terrorism" [...] and [...] "having an article (a highly dangerous mercury based substance) for terrorism". According to the prosecutor, red mercury was believed to be a material which could cause a large explosion, possibly even a nuclear reaction, <b>but</b> <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> not red mercury actually existed was irrelevant to the prosecution. All three men were acquitted in July 2006.|$|E

2500|$|In {{support of}} inclusivism he {{provides}} {{several types of}} arguments. First, he cites biblical texts which he takes to affirm “God’s radical love” for humanity such as {{the parable of the}} prodigal son (Luke 15). God ignores our insults and longs to embrace us. God genuinely wants all people to be redeemed (2 Peter 3:9). Second, Sanders holds that all people are included in God’s grace and those who are excluded are those who exclude themselves as in the story of the king’s son’s wedding (Matthew 22). Third, he speaks about the “great reversal” in Jesus’ teaching in which Jesus “gave hope for those considered outsiders while challenging the assurance of those who considered themselves insiders.” Fourth, Sanders argues that people in the Old Testament era were saved if they responded in trust to God. He calls this “the faith principle.” It is not how much you know <b>but</b> <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> not one responds positively to the revelation they have. He says that God reaches out to people “via general revelation, conscience and human culture. God does not leave himself without witness to any people. Salvation for the unevangelized is made possible only by the redemptive work of Jesus, but God applies that work even to those who are ignorant of the atonement.” The Holy Spirit is actively seeking people even where Christians are not present. He cites C.S. Lewis: “every prayer which is sincerely made even to a false god…is accepted by the true God,” and “Christ saves many who do not think they know him.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Attenborough {{starts the}} second {{programme}} {{by looking at}} potential future events, before warning that what happens {{over the next few}} years is crucial. A BBC weather forecast for the year 2050 shows that summer temperatures of 38°C for the UK are [...] "par for the course". The probable range by which the planet will warm over the next century is between 1.4°C and 5.8°C. Or, says Attenborough, [...] "to put it another way, the impact of global warming will be somewhere between severe and catastrophic." [...] The naturalist is invited to watch a film that illustrates regional change over the next 100 years. A 2°C rise for the south of England, for example, may not seem to be much but that is not all there is to it. Rainfall is also predicted to be more intense and storms could be five times more frequent than they are at the moment. This makes extreme events, such as the 2004 Boscastle flood, much more likely. Current defences for severe wind or rain will shortly become inadequate. Even Hurricane Katrina, with the devastation it caused, is described as [...] "not particularly powerful". In Australia, a new approach is needed to combat brush fires after the hottest year on record. If the Amazon tropical rainforest were to disappear, not only would an entire ecosystem vanish, but a valuable way of cooling the planet would go as well. Meanwhile, the glaciers continue to melt: one scientist reveals that an area the size of Texas has been lost over the last 20 years. Attenborough is told that a warming of 2°C is inevitable, as a consequence of our actions over the last 25 years, <b>but</b> <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> not we end up at 6°C is still very much within our control.|$|E
