40|$|New {{environmental}} regulations {{all over the}} world encourage the use of alternatives to <b>cadmium</b> <b>plating</b> for corrosion-protection systems used on steels. Boeing patents are pending on a non-cyanide replacement zinc nickel alloy electroplating process with superior properties, including low hydrogen embrittlement and good corrosion protection, for use on highstrength steels and other substrates. Another advantage of this process is low cost because conventional electroplating tank facilities can be used and waste treatment cost can be reduced. The feasibility of this zinc-nickel plating process has been successfully demonstrated in the laboratory and is scheduled for manufacturing scale-up during 1983. ALTHOUGH THE CADMIUM AND CYANIDE HAZARDS to human health are well known and documented W*, cyanide cadmium electroplating is widely used on steel for its many beneficial properties (2, 3, 4).

This study examined the use of zinc as a potential substitute for the cadmium protective surface finish. Tests were performed with an R and RMA flux and test temperatures of 230 C, 245 C, and 260 C.

An equal number of age-sex matched subjects working in administrative section formed the control group. Urinary cadmium levels were determined by using a flameless atomic absorption spectrophotometer. Urinary N-acetyl-beta -D-glucosaminidase and its isoenzymes A and B were determined by using spectrophotmetric method. Results A significant increase of urinary total N-acetyl-beta -D-glucosaminidase and its isoenzymes A and B profiles were noted in study as compared to controls. The levels of urinary N-acetyl-beta -D-glucosaminidase and its isoenzymes A and B profiles were positively and significantly correlated with cadmium levels in urine. Multiple regression analysis was used to assess the effect of urinary cadmium or life style confounding factors (age, BMI, smoking and alcohol consumption) on urinary N-acetyl-beta -D-glucosaminidase and its isoenzymes A and B. The analysis showed that the study subjects who had urine cadmium levels greater than 5 μg/g of creatinine, work duration > 15 years, smoking and body mass index variables were significantly associated with urinary total N-acetyl-beta -D-glucosaminidase but not on isoenzymes A&B.
