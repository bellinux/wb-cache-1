The in-depth explanation of proteins from a quantitative point of view and the variety of level of exercises (including physical experiments) {{at the end of each}} chapter will appeal to graduate and senior undergraduate students in mathematics, computer science, mechanical engineering, and physics, wanting to learn about the biophysics of proteins.  L.
