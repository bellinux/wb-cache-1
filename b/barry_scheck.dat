25|$|Simpson hired {{a team of}} {{high-profile}} lawyers, including F. Lee Bailey, Robert Kardashian, Robert Shapiro, Alan Dershowitz, Johnnie Cochran, Gerald Uelmen (then the dean of law at Santa Clara University), Carl E. Douglas and Shawn Holley. Two attorneys specializing in DNA evidence, <b>Barry</b> <b>Scheck</b> and Peter Neufeld, were hired to attempt to discredit the prosecution's DNA evidence. They argued that Simpson {{was the victim of}} police fraud and what they termed as sloppy internal procedures, which had contaminated the DNA evidence.|$|E
25|$|Samples from bloody shoe prints leading {{away from}} the bodies and from the back gate of the {{condominium}} were tested for DNA matches. Initial polymerase chain reaction testing did not rule out Simpson as a suspect. In more precise {{restriction fragment length polymorphism}} tests, matches were found between Simpson's blood and blood samples taken from the crime scene (both the shoe prints in blood and the gate samples). Police criminalist Dennis Fung testified that this DNA evidence put Simpson at Brown's townhouse {{at the time of the}} murders. But defense expert <b>Barry</b> <b>Scheck</b> conducted an eight-day cross-examination, questioning most of the DNA evidence. Dr. Robin Cotton, of Cellmark Diagnostics, testified for six days. Blood evidence had been tested at two separate laboratories, each conducting different tests. At this time, the general population was still unfamiliar with the precision and significance of DNA matching.|$|E

2500|$|A Colorado {{grand jury}} had voted in 1999 to indict the parents. The {{indictment}} cited [...] "two counts each of child abuse" [...] {{and said the}} parents [...] "did unlawfully, knowingly, recklessly and feloniously permit a child to be unreasonably placed {{in a situation that}} posed a threat of injury to the child's life or health, which resulted in the death of JonBen√©t Ramsey, a child under the age of sixteen." [...] Among the experts in the case were DNA specialist <b>Barry</b> <b>Scheck</b> and forensic expert Dr. Henry Lee. On October 13, 1999, Alex Hunter, who was the district attorney at the time, refused to sign the indictment, saying that the evidence was insufficient. This left the impression that the grand jury investigation had been inconclusive. In 2002, the statute of limitations on the charges expired. The indictment was not known publicly until October 25, 2013, when previously sealed court documents were released.|$|E

50|$|Wilkinson's {{hopes were}} {{manifested}} {{with the passage}} of the bipartisan Innocence Protection Act in 2004. On February 10, 2000, Senator Patrick Leahy (D-VT) introduced the act after devoting nearly a year to evaluating flaws in the administration of the death penalty nationwide. A few months later, the bill is introduced in the House by Bill Delahunt (D-MA) and Ray LaHood (R-IL). Innocence Project co-founders Neufeld and <b>Barry</b> C. <b>Scheck</b> testified several times over the next few years as witnesses before hearings of committee on the Act. Both mentioned the Harvey v. Horan case in their testimony, saying that it was significant for being the first federal court decision in the country to recognize a constitutional right of access to post-conviction DNA testing. The Innocence Protection Act eventually passed in the House of Representatives by an overwhelming majority (393-14) on November 5, 2003. On October 9, 2004, the legislation, which was sponsored by Senator Patrick Leahy, passed unanimously in the United States Senate after narrowly moving through the Senate Judiciary Committee.|$|R

The school {{is also home to}} the Innocence Project, run by Cardozo Professor <b>Barry</b> <b>Scheck,</b> which has used DNA profiling to help free innocent prisoners. The project's work has been instrumental in some high-profile cases. In 1999 Cardozo {{became a member of the}} Order of the Coif, an honor society for law scholars. Cardozo has seven faculty members who have clerked for U.S. Supreme Court Justices, and Cardozo has had two graduates chosen to clerk for the U.S. Supreme Court. Cardozo was the second U.S. law school to secure an invitation to The European Law Moot Court Competition, and the first American law school to be invited twice consecutively. [...] Many of Cardozo's 12,000 alumni reside in the New York metropolitan area, while many pursue their careers internationally and can be found across the country. In 2013, 88% of the law school's first-time test takers passed the bar exam, placing the law school sixth-best among New York's 15 law schools.
