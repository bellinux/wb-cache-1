The Birmingham Back to Backs are the last surviving court of <b>back-to-back</b> <b>houses</b> {{in the city}}. Cadbury World is a museum showing visitors the stages and steps of chocolate production {{and the history of}} chocolate and the company. The Ikon Gallery hosts displays of contemporary art, as does Eastside Projects.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} Georgian {{buildings}} survive, including St Philip's Cathedral, Soho House, Perrott's Folly, the Town Hall {{and much of}} St Paul's Square. The Victorian era saw extensive building across the city. Major civic buildings such as the Victoria Law Courts (in characteristic red brick and terracotta), the Council House and the Museum & Art Gallery were constructed. St Chad's Cathedral was the first Roman Catholic cathedral {{to be built in}} the UK since the Reformation. Across the city, the need to house the industrial workers gave rise to miles of redbrick streets and terraces, many of <b>back-to-back</b> <b>houses,</b> some of which were later to become inner-city slums.|$|E
25|$|Numerous <b>back-to-back</b> <b>houses,</b> two {{or three}} storeys high, were built in Birmingham during the 19th century. Most of these houses were {{concentrated}} in inner-city areas such as Ladywood, Handsworth, Aston, Small Heath and Highgate. Most were still in quite good condition in the early 20th century and also prior to their demolition. By the early 1970s, almost all of Birmingham's <b>back-to-back</b> <b>houses</b> had been demolished. The occupants were rehoused in new council houses and flats, some in redeveloped inner-city areas, while the majority moved to new housing estates such as Castle Vale and Chelmsley Wood.|$|E
50|$|There is much council housing, {{although}} most of the housing stock is privately built and dates from the 1960s. <b>Back-to-back</b> <b>housing</b> has been converted to through terraces.|$|R
5000|$|Hyde Park was {{the site}} of the {{earliest}} large scale slum clearance in Britain, the previous <b>back-to-back</b> <b>housing</b> having been known as [...] "Little Chicago" [...] in the 1930s, due to the violent crimes sometimes committed there. The area was partially razed before the Second World War.|$|R
5000|$|Over {{recent years}} {{efforts have been}} made to {{regenerate}} the Holbeck area. The most notable scheme is the Holbeck Urban Village, which is expected to attract investment of around £800 million and create around 5,000 jobs. However, the area surrounding the 'Village' is deprived and run down. From 2007, Leeds City Council began vacating the <b>back-to-back</b> <b>housing</b> and in 2010 began demolition.|$|R
25|$|This name {{which was}} the formalised name given to the small RAAF Intercept Station {{operating}} in two <b>back-to-back</b> <b>houses</b> at 21 Sycamore Street and 24 French Street in the suburb of Pimlico in Townsville established by Wing Commander Booth in March 1942.|$|E
25|$|Perry Bridge, {{built in}} 1711 in Perry Barr to replace an earlier bridge, {{is another example}} of a {{structure}} built during this time. The industrial expansion of Birmingham attracted industrialists to the city and Soho House, in Handsworth, completed in 1796 to a design by brothers Samuel Wyatt and James Wyatt as the home for the wealthy industrialist Matthew Boulton, is a well-preserved example of what the industrialists constructed for themselves. The Industrial Revolution did not just attract wealthy industrialists to Birmingham. The need to house the many industrial workers who flocked to the city from elsewhere in the United Kingdom during the Industrial Revolution led to the construction of many streets and terraces of <b>back-to-back</b> <b>houses,</b> some of which were later to become inner-city slums. Remaining examples of inner-city domestic buildings are located on Kingston Row, which was built around 1780 and modernised by J. A. Maudsley, the City Architect of Birmingham, in 1969. A later example of <b>back-to-back</b> <b>houses</b> are the Birmingham Back to Backs, the last remaining <b>back-to-back</b> <b>houses</b> in the city, which were built in 1830 and recently renovated and turned into a museum run by the National Trust. Many residential properties dating from around this period are listed buildings.|$|E
25|$|As in many {{industrial}} towns {{during the}} 19th century, many of Birmingham's residents lived in overcrowded and unsanitary conditions. During the early-to-mid-19th century, thousands of <b>back-to-back</b> <b>houses</b> were built {{to house the}} growing population, {{many of which were}} poorly built and badly drained, and many soon became slums.|$|E
50|$|At {{the height}} of the Industrial Revolution there was less {{industry}} here than in Bradford village and consequently <b>back-to-back</b> terraced <b>houses</b> abounded everywhere. Two open spaces were the David Lewis Play Ground and Bradford Recreation Ground.|$|R
50|$|Burmantofts {{has changed}} {{very little in}} the last forty years, the only area of change is a St James' Hospital, which {{separated}} Harehills and Burmantofts. St Bridgets R.C. Secondary Modern School on Torre Road closed down in the 1980s and is now St. Patrick's Primary School, while the transport depot opposite is now the site of Benfield Ford. In September 2006, the area's main secondary school, Primrose High School moved into new premises. With regards to housing, Leeds City Council has not proposed any regeneration in the area, and in recent years is focusing on areas of early-twentieth century <b>back-to-back</b> <b>housing</b> such as Beeston and Holbeck. There has however been refurbishment of a number of blocks.|$|R
50|$|From 1673 to 1819, the {{majority}} of Burnley Wood was glebe land in the ownership of St Peter's Church, and as such could not be developed. However, by 1825, as Burnley began to expand rapidly as a burgeoning cotton manufacturing town, spurred on by {{the completion of the}} Leeds and Liverpool Canal in 1801, back-to-back cottages and mills began to develop along the canal at Lane Bridge around Finsley Gate. Between 1825 and 1844 Spring Gardens Mill, together with <b>back-to-back</b> <b>housing</b> were built between Plumbe Street and Eastgate (now Yorkshire Street) and coal mining also began to take place on the north bank of the River Calder between Plumbe Street and Oxford Road.|$|R
25|$|The Birmingham Back to Backs (also {{known as}} Court 15) are the city's last {{surviving}} court of <b>back-to-back</b> <b>houses.</b> They are preserved {{as examples of}} the thousands of similar houses that were built around shared courtyards, for the rapidly increasing population of Britain's expanding industrial towns. They are a very particular sort of British terraced housing. This sort of housing was deemed unsatisfactory, and the passage of the Public Health Act 1875 meant that no more were built; instead byelaw terraced houses took their place. This court, at 50–54 Inge Street and 55–63 Hurst Street, is now operated as a museum by the National Trust.|$|E
25|$|However the 1901 Census records W.M. Scott aged {{seven years}} {{with his parents}} and no {{siblings}} close to the tannery again at 20 Stonefield Terrace, in the All Souls parish of north Leeds, Yorkshire, and only four streets away from the Scotts' previous home in Clayfield Street. It was a four-room corner house in a back-to-back row on the corner with Cambridge Road. This was a street of <b>back-to-back</b> <b>houses,</b> but is now a row of trees on a playing field. In the 1911 Census he was aged 17 years, he had no siblings {{and he was a}} lithographic artist apprentice, living with his parents in a back-to-back house at 49 Ganton Mount at Woodhouse, Leeds; the street is now rebuilt as modern houses. In 1911 his father was a journeyman joiner, and his mother a housewife. The 1911 census enumerator recorded that the house had eight rooms instead of the regular back-to-back four rooms, so no. 49 must have been a larger corner house.|$|E
500|$|Of Winson Green, Chinn {{writes that}} it was {{originally}} developed as a [...] "better-off working class district", but that by {{the latter part of}} the 20th century many of the properties in the area were falling into decay. Dr Chris Upton, reader in public history at the city's Newman University, has described the street as part of a [...] "ribbon development" [...] of suburban districts built as Birmingham expanded during {{the latter part of the}} 19th century. While many of the street's original residents were locals who moved from the inner city <b>back-to-back</b> <b>houses,</b> some had moved from as far away as London and Cornwall to work in Birmingham. Upton describes them as [...] "the respectable working class"skilled workers who earned around 30 shillings (£1.50) per week, and who in many cases could even afford to employ a maid. Those who grew prosperous moved to wealthier areas, and were replaced by immigrants from Asia and the West Indies, who came to the UK during the years after World War II. A high proportion of those who lived in the area were employed by Birmingham's industrial economy, which enjoyed prosperity until the collapse of the city's manufacturing industry during the early 1980s, resulting in mass unemployment. Professor Steven McCabe of Birmingham City Business School has noted that Birmingham lost 200,000 manufacturing jobs between 1971 and 1981, and that the city's GDP per capita, which in 1976 was the highest for a UK city outside the south east region, had fallen to become the lowest in England seven years later.|$|E
40|$|PERFORMANCE VIDEO - 45 : 00 MINS] Sitting in my student, <b>back-to-back</b> <b>house</b> in Beeston, Leeds in {{the early}} 80 s, I {{experienced}} an extraordinary sonic phenomenon: 40, 000 voices raised in a vast cheer burst into the sitting room, followed by urgent chanting and a massively disappointed "ohhh [...] " It was unexpected (did I even {{know there was a}} football ground nearby?) and chilling yet very moving. These voices, raw, in atavistic unison impinged on the mundane activities of my everyday life. This surreal incongruity of hearing but not seeing the source of so many voices erupting uninvited into my house occurred on many subsequent Saturdays and I came to quite enjoy the unsolicited mass companionship. The memory has stayed with me ever since...|$|R
50|$|The area is {{situated}} {{in the vicinity of}} the A64 York Road, east Leeds' main thoroughfare, and is also home to a large park dating back from Victorian times which was purchased by Leeds City Council in the late 19th century, when it was waste land. Housing in the area is made up of nineteenth-century through terraced <b>housing,</b> some <b>back-to-back</b> terraced <b>housing.</b> Semi-detached and detached houses are also found in the area.Many of the <b>back-to-back</b> terraced <b>houses</b> in the area were due to be demolished as part of the £1.3 billion EASEL regeneration scheme in east and south east Leeds. However these plans were withdrawn in 2010 with Leeds City Council citing the recession debilitating the private sector's ability to build as the main reason.|$|R
50|$|The area {{developed}} {{around an}} area {{then known as}} The Leylands in the 18th century. Originally a largely working class residential area housing workers for the areas textile industry. In 1865 the Carlton Barracks opened {{in the area and}} is still open. By the 1950s the area had become dilapidated with many of the areas <b>back-to-back</b> <b>housing</b> were considered unfit for human habitation and was redeveloped in a slum clearance scheme, around the same town the layout of the area was changed by the construction of the Leeds Inner Ring Road and the Sheepscar Interchange. As part of the areas redevelopment the main thoroughfare Camp Road was renamed Lovell Park Road and Oatlands Lane. There are few buildings in the area that predate the redevelopment during the 1960s and 1970s; All Souls' Church being one of them. A more modest redevelopment of the area was undertaken in the 2010s.|$|R
2500|$|The court {{consists}} of three pairs of <b>back-to-back</b> <b>houses</b> on Inge Street and a terrace of five blind back houses on Hurst Street, {{in the form of}} an L-shaped footprint. All the buildings are three storeys tall with one room on each floor.|$|E
2500|$|The {{other major}} effect of {{industrialisation}} was the vast expansion in housing stock. [...] Titus Salt's Saltaire {{is an example}} of a model village, and Hargreaves had cottages built for his workers around the town centre and his mill. [...] He built 92 <b>back-to-back</b> <b>houses</b> along Market Street and Central Avenue in an area which came to be called Hargreaves Square or The Square. [...] The houses were built by filling in the old courtyards. [...] The population of the township grew from 1,214 in 1822 to just over 3,000 in 1851 to 10,000 by 1869.|$|E
2500|$|In 1908, a {{shipbuilding}} programme {{for that}} year was accelerated to boost labour demand, while loans sanctioned by the Local Government Board since the early summer for ‘works of public utility’ (such as street improvements, waterworks, and sewerage) had exceeded £700,000. Spending on relief work and public works was also significantly increased to alleviate unemployment, while the Local Government Board regulations governing the type of work provided by distress committees and local authorities, together with the eligibility of applicants for relief, were both relaxed. In 1909, the construction of <b>back-to-back</b> <b>houses</b> was finally forbidden. For those in Ireland, the Labourers (Ireland) Act of 1906 empowered Rural Councils to acquire land for labourers’ cottages and plots, while the Town Tenants Act extended “the principle of compensation for improvements at the termination of a lease to the urban tenant.” ...|$|E
50|$|Historically, {{the area}} {{consisted}} of Victorian <b>back-to-back</b> slum <b>housing.</b> Unlike most industrial {{cities of the}} time these properties {{took the form of}} 3 and 4 storey courtyard based housing (with several families sharing one house). In the early 1930s, the notion of slum clearances had become popular in the country, however, clearing Lee Bank was delayed until after World War II.|$|R
50|$|In 1875, the Public Health Act was introduced. It {{required}} urban {{authorities to}} make byelaws for new streets, to ensure structural stability of houses and prevent fires, {{and to provide}} for the drainage of buildings and the provision of air space around buildings. Section 57 determined that all houses must be through houses - no more <b>back-to-back</b> <b>housing.</b> Three years later the Building Act of 1878 provided more detail with constructions, defining foundations, damp proof courses, thickness of walls, ceiling heights, space between dwellings, under floor ventilation, ventilation of rooms, size of windows. The Local Government Board, established in 1871, issued the first Model Bye-laws in 1877/78. Urban authorities either adopted them, or wrote their own versions adapted to local conditions. While local versions were frequently not so rigorous, they could be generous by modern standards as regards ceiling heights. The importance of the Act was that it defined building standards for the housing of the working class.|$|R
50|$|Miles Platting {{certainly}} did have many mills {{by the middle}} of the 19th century: Holland Mill, Victoria Mill and Ducie Mill were among the largest. By the 1870s a chemical works, timber yard, gas works and a tannery were also operating in the area alongside the many mills. This volume of industry in such a relatively small area inevitably led to the construction of densely packed <b>back-to-back</b> <b>housing</b> to provide homes for the necessary workforce. By the middle of the 20th century, with the decline in manufacturing industry and the closure of its local industries, Miles Platting had become a slum area inhabited by a deprived, largely white, community. Today, Miles Platting contains just under 2,000 housing units, many of them managed by Adactus Housing Association on behalf of Manchester City Council, including 12 multi-storey blocks. The area, once recognised as being amongst the most deprived in the UK, has benefited greatly from the very substantial urban regeneration scheme for east Manchester initiated in the late 1990s.|$|R

5000|$|Built [...] for James Brown, a wool merchant, Potternewton Mansion was {{originally}} called Harehills Grove. In 1861 it {{was bought by}} the Jowitt family and the 750 acre estate was, like the Newton Park Estate, sold to build <b>back-to-back</b> terraced <b>houses</b> while the 30 acre park {{at the front of}} the mansion was kept.

50|$|Armley is a {{district}} in the west of Leeds, West Yorkshire, England. It starts less than 1 mi from Leeds city centre. Like much of Leeds, Armley grew in the Industrial Revolution and had several mills, one of which houses now the Leeds Industrial Museum at Armley Mills. Armley is predominantly and historically a largely working class area of the city, still retains many smaller industrial businesses, and has many rows of <b>back-to-back</b> terraced <b>houses.</b>|$|R
50|$|Much of Thamesmead was {{initially}} {{built by the}} Greater London Council (GLC) for rent to families moving from overcrowded <b>back-to-back</b> Victorian <b>housing</b> (also referred to as slums) in south eastern parts of Inner London. The area had been inundated in the North Sea Flood of 1953, so the original design placed living accommodation at first floor level or above, used overhead walkways and left the ground level of buildings as garage space.|$|R
50|$|A pit or {{model village}} {{of more than}} 150 <b>back-to-back</b> <b>houses</b> was built at New Sharlston from 1864 to house Sharlston Colliery Company workers. The houses cost just over £100 each and the streets were named Long Row, Crossley Street and High Street. A Methodist chapel and a day school were built on Crossley Street. The {{properties}} became {{the property of the}} National Coal Board in 1947. In 1961 twenty eight <b>back-to-back</b> <b>houses</b> were converted into 14 through houses. The school and the chapel have been demolished.|$|E
50|$|The {{advent of}} council housing after the First World War {{resulted}} in councils organising programmes of slum clearances which were {{all part of}} post-war redevelopment programmes (see Statutory slum clearance plans). These procedures saw the beginning of mass demolition of <b>back-to-back</b> <b>houses</b> in the 1920s. The process started again in the 1950s and continued through the 1960s, and the 1970s, leaving most towns and cities with few or no <b>back-to-back</b> <b>houses</b> by the 1980s. However, {{in cities such as}} Leeds and Bradford significant numbers remain and are still being used as housing.|$|E
50|$|Numerous <b>back-to-back</b> <b>houses,</b> two {{or three}} storeys high, were built in Birmingham during the 19th century. Most of these houses were {{concentrated}} in inner-city areas such as Ladywood, Handsworth, Aston, Small Heath and Highgate. Most were still in quite good condition in the early 20th century and also prior to their demolition. By the early 1970s, almost all of Birmingham's <b>back-to-back</b> <b>houses</b> had been demolished. The occupants were rehoused in new council houses and flats, some in redeveloped inner-city areas, while the majority moved to new housing estates such as Castle Vale and Chelmsley Wood.|$|E
5|$|It {{was in the}} 19th {{century that}} Leeds began to grow into one of Britain's largest cities. This led to {{widespread}} building across the city. Leeds' wool and cloth trades resulted {{in the building of}} many industrial buildings during this era. The resulting workforce which migrated to the city from rural areas brought about the building of many houses. Leeds has perhaps the most surviving examples of <b>back-to-back</b> terrace <b>housing</b> in the UK, particularly in Holbeck and Harehills.|$|R
50|$|Gilbert {{was the son}} of Phineas Briggs, a mill {{worker who}} was descended from a line of Yorkshire weavers and textile mill workers. Phineas died of pleuro-pneumonia, aged 36, leaving Gilbert, aged nine, and three young siblings, to be brought up by their mother, Mary Anne Emsley, who {{abandoned}} their <b>back-to-back</b> <b>house</b> to move the family in with her mother. Despite these desperate circumstances, Gilbert later wrote that they were happy, and he was very soon to move to Kings Lynn to attend technical school. Later he attended Crossley and Porter Orphan School in Halifax, where he acquired a love of classical music. He was then to spend 27 years in the textile industry, often travelling as a merchant. In 1914 he was rejected for army service following a medical screening in which he was considered to have a heart condition, though this was never to affect him in any way. This rather spurious and hurried diagnosis saved him from fighting in the First World War, in which one in seven of men under 25 were to die, and he continued in textiles at Holdworth Lund and Co.|$|R

Avenham contains some of Preston’s oldest streets, as well as the shining new build which followed city status.
