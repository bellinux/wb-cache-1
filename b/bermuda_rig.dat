25|$|The 470 (Four-Seventy) is a {{double-handed}} monohull planing dinghy with a centreboard, <b>Bermuda</b> <b>rig,</b> and centre sheeting. Equipped with a spinnaker, trapeze {{and a large}} sail-area-to-weight ratio, it {{is designed}} to plane easily, and good teamwork necessary to sail it well. The name comes from the overall length of the boat in centimetres (i.e., the boat is 4.70 metres long).|$|E
25|$|Potential restorers {{of older}} boats {{who wanted to}} race were {{potentially}} faced with a dilemma of whether to restore a boat to its original specification or make modifications to make an older design competitive with a newer design. For example, a yacht designed under the First International Rule would have a wooden mast, gaff rig, and sails made of cotton; whereas yachts designed under the Third International Rule, such as Vim, had a metal mast, <b>Bermuda</b> <b>rig,</b> and sails made from Dacron.|$|E
25|$|The {{services}} of Charles Ernest Nicholson {{were once again}} employed to design the challenger and she was constructed at the Camper and Nicholsons yard in Gosport. Shamrock V was built from wood, with mahogany planking over steel frames and, most significantly, a hollow spruce mast. As a result of rule changes, {{she was the first}} British contender for the America's Cup to carry the <b>Bermuda</b> <b>rig.</b> Following her launch on 14 April 1930 she showed early promise on the British Regatta circuit winning 15 of 22 races. She also underwent continuous upgrading with changes to her hull shape, rudder, and modifications to the rig to create a more effective racing sail plan before departing to America in time for the 15th America's Cup.|$|E

50|$|A <b>Bermuda</b> <b>rigged</b> sloop with {{exactly one}} jib {{is known as}} a Bermuda sloop, a Marconi sloop, or a Marconi <b>rig.</b> A <b>Bermuda</b> sloop may also be a more {{specific}} type of vessel such as a small sailing ships traditional in Bermuda {{which may or may not}} be <b>Bermuda</b> <b>rigged.</b>|$|R

2500|$|Shamrock IV {{was never}} raced again, but the {{universal}} rule drew significant appeal, {{especially in the}} small M-Class. Believing that the new rule offered a serious opportunity for the British to take the Cup, Lipton challenged for the fifth and last time at age 79, in 1929. The J-Class was chosen for the contest, to which were added Lloyds' A1 scantling rules {{in order to ensure}} that the yachts would be seaworthy and evenly matched, given the Deed of Gift requirement for yachts to sail to the match on their [...] "own bottom." [...] The waterline length was set between [...] and , and there would be no time allowance. Novel rigging technology now permitted the <b>Bermuda</b> <b>rig</b> to replace the gaff rig. Nicholson was chosen to design challenger Shamrock V, and despite the Wall Street Crash, four NYYC syndicates responded to the threat and built a cup contender each. The venue was moved to Newport, Rhode Island, where, the Herreshoff Manufacturing Company's new naval architect Starling Burgess used his success in the M-Class and his experience as a wartime plane designer to build the Vanderbilt syndicate's defender Enterprise, the smallest J-Class. Meanwhile, Herreshoff's son, Lewis Francis Herreshoff, designed a radical boat: The Whirlwind, despite being the most advanced boat with her double-ended [...] "canoe" [...] build and electronic instruments, maneuvered too clumsily. The old 75-footers Resolute and Vanitie were rebuilt and converted to the J-Class to serve as trial horses. The Enterprises skipper Harold Vanderbilt won the selection trials with great difficulty. When Shamrock V was revealed, she was an outdated wooden boat with a wooden mast and performed poorly to windward. Enterprise was then fitted with the World's first duralumin mast, very lightweight at , and beat her opponent soundly.|$|E
50|$|The term Marconi rig {{was first}} {{applied to the}} tall <b>Bermuda</b> <b>rig</b> used on larger racing yachts, such as the J class used since 1914 for the America's Cup {{international}} yacht races, as - with the many supporting cables required - it reminded observers of Guglielmo Marconi's mast-like wireless antennas (Marconi's first demonstrations in the United States {{took place in the}} autumn of 1899, with the reporting of the America's Cup at New York). Although sometimes treated as interchangeable with <b>Bermuda</b> <b>rig</b> generally, some purists insist that Marconi rig refers only to the very tall <b>Bermuda</b> <b>rig</b> used on yachts like the J-class.|$|E

50|$|The junk rig {{typically}} produces less drive than {{a similarly}} sized <b>Bermuda</b> <b>rig</b> at low angles of attack (e.g. when sailing upwind, close-hauled) {{and this is}} especially pronounced in light wind.

50|$|The base {{models are}} rowing boats, but each model is also {{available}} as a sailing boat. The Scamp can be sailed with just a Holt rig main sail, or with a lug sail. Similarly, the Lighter can be sailed with a Holt rig with just a main sail, or as a <b>bermuda</b> <b>rig,</b> or alternatively {{it can be used}} with a lug sail. The Kondor can only be sailed with a Holt rig as a <b>Bermuda</b> <b>rig.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} modern {{sailboat}} is the sloop, which features one mast and two sails, typically a <b>Bermuda</b> <b>rigged</b> main, and a headsail. This simple configuration is very efficient for sailing into the wind.|$|R
50|$|The Wayfarer is {{a wooden}} or {{fibreglass}} hulled fractional <b>Bermuda</b> <b>rigged</b> sailing dinghy of great versatility; used for short 'day boat' trips, longer cruises and for racing. Over 11,000 {{have been produced}} as of 2016.|$|R
50|$|In sailing, a {{cunningham}} or cunningham's eye {{is a type}} of downhaul used on a <b>Bermuda</b> <b>rigged</b> sailboat {{to change}} the shape of a sail. It is named after its inventor, Briggs Cunningham, a victorious America's Cup skipper and yacht builder.|$|R

50|$|In their heyday, square-rigged vessels {{ranged in}} size from small boats to full rigged ships. But this rig fell from favour to fore-and-aft gaff <b>rigs</b> and <b>bermuda</b> <b>rigs</b> after the {{development}} of steam power and new materials. Ocean-going sailing ships stayed mostly square-rigged.|$|R
50|$|The Melges17 is a <b>Bermuda</b> <b>rigged</b> racing scow first {{launched}} in January 2004 by Melges Performance Sailboats. The boat's rig {{consists of a}} main with a large roach, a roller furling jib and an asymmetrical spinnaker {{used in conjunction with}} the retractable bowsprit.|$|R
5000|$|Square-rigged masts {{may also}} have {{triangular}} staysails that are deployed fore-and-aft between masts.The term [...] "square-rigged" [...] can also describe individual, four-cornered sails suspended from the horizontal yards, and carried on either a square-rigged or a mainly fore-and-aft rigged vessel, such as one with a <b>bermuda</b> <b>rigged</b> or gaff rigged mainsail.|$|R
50|$|Most are gaff rigged {{but some}} have a <b>Bermuda</b> <b>rig.</b> The beam {{of the classic}} Cape Cod Cat's beam {{measurement}} is almost half the waterline length, making it very stable.|$|E
50|$|The lateen rig {{was also}} the {{ancestor}} of the <b>Bermuda</b> <b>rig,</b> {{by way of the}} Dutch bezaan rig. In the 16th century, when Spain ruled the Netherlands, the lateen rigs were introduced to Dutch boat builders, who soon modified the design by omitting the mast and fastening {{the lower end of the}} yard directly to the deck, the yard becoming a raked mast with a full-length, triangular (leg-of-mutton) mainsail aft. Introduced to Bermuda early in the 17th century, this developed into the <b>Bermuda</b> <b>rig,</b> which, in the 20th century, was adopted almost universally for small sailing vessels.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Bermuda</b> <b>rig</b> can {{be split}} into two groups: the {{masthead}} rig and the fractional rig. The masthead rig has larger and more headsails, and a smaller mainsail, compared to the fractional rig.|$|E
50|$|The boat is crewed by {{two people}} and sails with a <b>bermuda</b> <b>rigged</b> mainsail, jib and spinnaker. The Cadet {{is the only}} {{recognised}} two persons youth-boat by the International Sailing Federation (ISAF) as an International Competitive Youth Sailing Class since 1958. Over 10000 Cadets have been built worldwide by registered builders on three continents.|$|R
25|$|A {{schooner}} has a mainmast {{taller than}} its foremast, distinguishing {{it from a}} ketch or a yawl. A schooner can have more than two masts, with the foremast always lower than the foremost main. Traditional topsail schooners have topmasts allowing triangular topsails sails to be flown above their gaff sails; many modern schooners are <b>Bermuda</b> <b>rigged.</b>|$|R
50|$|In sailing, {{the peak}} halyard (or peak for short) {{is a line}} that raises {{the end of a}} gaff further from the mast, as opposed to the throat halyard which raises the end nearer to the mast. Such rigging was normal in classic gaff-rigged schooners and in other ships with fore-and-aft rigging. It is absent in <b>Bermuda</b> <b>rigged</b> boats.|$|R
