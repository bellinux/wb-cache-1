The <b>block</b> <b>output</b> lines are labeled with pairs of numbers (i; j) which correspond to pairs (x; y) as described in [2] and [4], to which correspond representations as de…ned in [6]. Although a pair (x; y) determines a standard module and an irreducible representation uniquely, the <b>block</b> <b>output</b> only contains su ¢ cient information to make an assignment up to outer automorphisms of G(R), and, if G(R) is disconnected, up to tensoring by a character which is trivial on the identity component. In addition, the user will have his or her own realization of the group G(R) in mind, with a choice of representatives of Cartan subgroups, and a choice of isomorphisms of those CSG’s with abstract tori. The parameterization of representations will depend on those choices. For example, if we realize SL(2; R) as the set of 2 2 real matrices of determinant 1, and the compact Cartan as k = cos () sin () sin () cos () ' S 1; then the two natural choices of isomorphism k 7 ! e i and k 7 ! e i (1) lead to di¤erent parametrizations of representations of SL(2; R); making a di¤erent choice amounts to switching the holomorphic and antiholomorphic discrete series.

Through the moving vehicle information, we can avoid the crash caused by sudden break of front one or acquire to real time traffic data to check the detour road. To be connecting the wireless communication between the vehicles, fast timing synchronization can be a key factor. Finding out the sync point fast is able to have more marginal time to compensate the distorted signals caused by channel variance. Thus, we introduce the combination method which helps find out the start of frame quickly. It is executed by auto-correlation and cross-correlation simultaneously using only short preambles.

40|$|An {{approach}} combining genetic, proteomic, computational, {{and physiological}} {{analysis was used}} to define a protein network that regulates fat storage in budding yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae). A computational analysis of this network shows that it is not scale-free, and is best approximated by the Watts-Strogatz model, which generates "small-world" networks with high clustering and short path lengths. The network is also modular, containing energy level sensing proteins that connect to four output processes: autophagy, fatty acid synthesis, mRNA processing, and MAP kinase signaling. The importance of each protein to network function is dependent on its Katz centrality score, which is related both to the protein's position within a module and to the module's relationship to the network as a whole. The network is also divisible into subnetworks that span modular boundaries and regulate different aspects of fat metabolism. We used a combination of genetics and pharmacology to simultaneously <b>block</b> <b>output</b> from multiple network nodes. The phenotypic results of this blockage define patterns of communication among distant network nodes, and these patterns are consistent with the Watts-Strogatz model...|$|E

40|$|Abstract- Spectrum {{analysis}} is very essential requirement in instrumentation and communication signal interception. Spectrum {{analysis is}} normally {{carried out by}} online or offline FFT processing. The Goertzel algorithm is a digital signal processing (DSP) technique for identifying frequency components of a signal. While the general Fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithm computes evenly across the bandwidth of the incoming signal, the Goertzel algorithm looks at specific, predetermined frequency. The FPGA being capable of offering high frequency data paths become suitable for realizing high speed spectrum analysis algorithms. The objective of this thesis is implementing Goertzel algorithm as high Q band pass filter on FPGA reconfigurable architecture. A digital frequency synthesizer produces frequency sweep which will drive the digital mixer. The digital mixer output {{is given to the}} Goertzel algorithm block. This algorithm output will be given to peak detection logic. The peak detector <b>block</b> <b>output</b> will be used for spectrum computation.

40|$|While FPGA {{programmable}} routing {{networks are}} designed to connect logic <b>block</b> <b>output</b> pins to input pins, FPGA users and architects sometimes become motivated to create connections between pins and specific wires in an FPGA. We call these pin-to-wire connections, and they are motivated by several reasons: first, a desire to employ routing-by-abutment, as commonly done in custom VLSI, to build modular, pre-laid out systems. Second, partial reconfiguration of FPGAs often requires that circuits in the FPGA connect by abutment. Third, pin-to-wire routing is required {{to make use of}} resources that reside within the routing network itself, such as the plentiful multiplexers in the network, or even the configuration bits themselves. In this paper we attempt to understand and measure {{how difficult it is to}} form such pin-to-wire connections. We show, for example, under an experimental scenario close to routing-by-abutment, that the total routed wirelength compared to a flat placement of the complete system increases by about 6 %, that the critical path delay increases by 15 % and the router effort goes up by a factor of 3. 5. To achieve this result, it is important to be careful in selecting the specific target wires. Overall we demonstrate that while pin-to-wire connections definitely impose increased stress on the routing architecture and router, it is possible to route some reasonable number of them, and so they can be used under some circumstances. 1...|$|E
40|$|Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) {{are defined}} as the {{combination}} of computational elements with physical components. Systems that require communication, computation, and control are by definition CPSs. The complexity of these systems often grows exponentially as they incorporate more elements into their design. As such, many approaches to designing CPSs revolve around the development of Domain Specific Modeling Languages (DSMLs). DSMLs drastically reduce the development time for CPSs by abstracting elements of the development process to a high level. DSMLs can be constrained {{in such a way}} that it is impossible to construct structurally invalid models of CPSs. This allows designers to think abstractly and ignore time consuming low level implementation details. However, these methods do not prevent designers from constructing systems that can be invalid in other, more dynamic, ways. That is, structural constraints on a DSML for a CPS do not prevent constraint violations where some analysis must be performed on the system to verify that the constraint has been satisfied. In the state-of-the-art, it is violations on these dynamic constraints that modelers must spend their time designing around. Dynamic constraints can be incorporated into the framework of a DSML by integrating the concepts of automatic feedback control into the DSML with model transformations. The methodology that describes this new approach to Domain Specific Modeling (DSM) is called Dynamic Constraint Feedback (DCF). At a glance: first a DSML is created for a CPS. Next, an interface is developed for two-way interaction between the DSML and external tools. Third, an expert block that can perform analysis on the models is created. The expert block is responsible for determining constraint violations and solutions. Lastly, model transformations are generated based on expert <b>block</b> <b>output</b> and applied to the existing models. This process repeats until a solution is either found or declared to be unreachable...|$|E
40|$|The LMS {{algorithm}} {{is one of}} the most successful adaptive filtering algorithms. It uses the instantaneous value of the square of the error signal as an estimate of the mean-square error (MSE). The LMS algorithm changes (adapts) the filter tap weights so that the error signal is minimized in the mean square sense. In Trigonometric LMS (TLMS) and Hyperbolic LMS (HLMS), two new versions of LMS algorithms, same formulations are performed as in the LMS algorithm with the exception that filter tap weights are now expressed using trigonometric and hyperbolic formulations, in cases for TLMS and HLMS respectively. Hence appears the CORDIC algorithm as it can efficiently perform trigonometric, hyperbolic, linear and logarithmic functions. While hardware-efficient algorithms often exist, the dominance of the software systems has kept those algorithms out of the spotlight. Among these hardware- efficient algorithms, CORDIC is an iterative solution for trigonometric and other transcendental functions. Former researches worked on CORDIC algorithm to observe the convergence behavior of Trigonometric LMS (TLMS) algorithm and obtained a satisfactory result in the context of convergence performance of TLMS algorithm. But revious researches directly used the CORDIC <b>block</b> <b>output</b> in their simulation ignoring the internal step-by-step rotations of the CORDIC processor. This gives rise to a need for verification of the convergence performance of the TLMS algorithm to investigate if it actually performs satisfactorily if implemented with step-by-step CORDIC rotation. This research work has done this job. It focuses on the internal operations of the CORDIC hardware, implements the Trigonometric LMS (TLMS) and Hyperbolic LMS (HLMS) algorithms using actual CORDIC rotations. The obtained simulation results are highly satisfactory and also it shows that convergence behavior of HLMS is much better than TLMS. Comment: 12 pages, 5 figures, 1 table.
