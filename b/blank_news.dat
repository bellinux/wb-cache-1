2500|$|Idema and Scurka again worked {{together}} as consultants for the 48 Hours story about Colonel George Marecek, a highly decorated Special Forces soldier accused and later {{convicted of murdering}} his wife. The two were fired from the project because they were determined to be taking an advocacy role for the defense. They opened a [...] "Free Marecek" [...] office in the town where the trial was taking place. In December 2000, 48 Hours ran the story on Marecek which included material from Idema, and Scurka's research. Idema also took a leading part {{in the formation of}} Point <b>Blank</b> <b>News</b> (PBN) to support Marecek.|$|E
50|$|On 4 May 2005 the U.S. Marine Corps {{recalled}} 5,277 Interceptor combat vests made by DHB's Point <b>Blank</b> unit after <b>news</b> {{reports about}} the vests' inability to stop 9mm bullets. In November 2005, the Marine Corps ordered 10,342 Interceptor Outer Tactical Vests pulled from the operating forces after media reports indicated some samples tested by the manufacturer and by the U.S. Army's Aberdeen Proving Ground in Maryland failed to fully comply with ballistics standards.|$|R
2500|$|The World War ended {{a golden}} era for the press. Their younger staff members were drafted and male {{replacements}} {{could not be}} found (women were not considered). Rail transportation was rationed and less paper and ink came in, and fewer copies could be shipped out. Inflation raised the price of newsprint, which was always in short supply. The cover price went up, circulation fell and many of the 242 dailies published outside Paris closed down. The government set up the Interministerial Press Commission to closely supervise newspapers. [...] A separate agency imposed tight censorship that led to <b>blank</b> spaces where <b>news</b> reports or editorials were disallowed. The dailies sometimes were limited to only two pages instead of the usual four, leading one satirical paper to try to report the war news in the same spirit: ...|$|R
60|$|The debate {{would now}} have run higher than ever, {{but they were}} {{interrupted}} by intelligence that the Duke of Monmouth had commenced his march towards the west, and was already advanced half way from Edinburgh. This news silenced their divisions for the moment, and {{it was agreed that}} the next day should be held as a fast of general humiliation for the sins of the land; that the Reverend Mr Poundtext should preach to the army in the morning, and Kettledrummle in the afternoon; that neither should touch upon any topics of schism or of division, but animate the soldiers to resist to the blood, like brethren in a good cause. This healing overture having been agreed to, the moderate party ventured upon another proposal, confiding that it would have the support of Langcale, who looked extremely <b>blank</b> at the <b>news</b> which they had just received, and might be supposed reconverted to moderate measures. It was to be presumed, they said, that since the King had not intrusted the command of his forces upon the present occasion to any of their active oppressors, but, on the contrary, had employed a nobleman distinguished by gentleness of temper, and a disposition favourable to their cause, there must be some better intention entertained towards them than they had yet experienced. They contended, that it was not only prudent but necessary to ascertain, from a communication with the Duke of Monmouth, whether he was not charged with some secret instructions in their favour. This could only be learned by dispatching an envoy to his army.|$|R
