50|$|The {{blast furnace}} method is {{expected}} to survive into the 22nd century because of its efficient rate of iron production at competitive costs compared with other iron making methods. Blast furnaces keep on improving with adaptations arising from new technologies driven by rising global demand, yet the main chemical process remains same. But process improvement cannot solve {{many of the problems}} associated with blast furnaces. The rate of iron production is highly influenced by fluctuations in the world economy, and improving the operational efficiency of the process is of major concern. However, the biggest drawback of <b>blast</b> <b>furnace</b> <b>operation</b> is the inevitable carbon dioxide production from iron reduction processes, which {{is considered one of the}} major contributors in global warming. Accordingly, the Pulverized Coal Injection (PCI) method is becoming an internationally popular method for improving <b>blast</b> <b>furnace</b> <b>operation.</b>|$|E

50|$|Many countries, {{including}} India, France and Germany, have underground {{deposits of}} iron ore in dust form (blue dust). Such iron ore cannot be directly charged in a blast furnace.

40|$|A recent {{empirical}} {{literature has}} shaken economists' {{confidence in the}} value of aggregate (industry-level) data to illuminate production relationships. But the statistical finding 'you can't aggregate,' however well documented, is not an economic explanation. Plant-level relationships do aggregate in Depression-era <b>blast</b> <b>furnace</b> <b>operations</b> despite the presence of very substantial interplant heterogeneity, the most common economic cause of nonaggregability. The economic explanation of this lies in poor short-run substitutability of one plant's output for another's.

The major chemical components of the iron <b>blast</b> <b>furnace</b> slag are Al 2 O 3, CaO, MgO and SiO 2. Recent years more and more high-Al 2 O 3 iron ores have been used for the ironmaking which results in high Al 2 O 3 concentration in the iron <b>blast</b> <b>furnace</b> slag. Inspection of the compositions of the iron <b>blast</b> <b>furnace</b> slag in Shougang indicated that the Al 2 O 3 concentration in the slag has increased from 7 - 8 wt% in 1980 s to 15 - 16 wt% now.
