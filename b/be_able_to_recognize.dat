5|$|In archaeology, {{the study}} of {{mortuary}} context, that is, {{the interpretation of the}} postmortem treatment of the dead, whether an individual or as pertains to patterns within a group, has {{led to the development of}} hypotheses on social status and/or hierarchy regarding many cultures, ancient and extant. In addition, the determination of whether or not delivery actually occurred prior to death has a bearing on analyses of the mother's population, as the concentration of trace elements differ markedly between the skeletons of prepartum adult women (before giving birth) and women who are lactating; the identification of coffin birth would lead to more accurate analyses of the number of lactating women in a population or the rate of maternal mortality. It is therefore necessary for investigators to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>recognize</b> postmortem fetal extrusion when encountered in an excavated burial.|$|E
5|$|Seoul unit {{director}} Dan Glass and Jim Mitchell {{were the}} visual effects supervisors {{of the first}} season. The season had a total VFX shot count of about 1200. An in-house VFX team was established in Chicago which completed over 700 shots. The major external VFX vendors were Locktix VFX (160-180 shots), Technicolor VFX (over 100 shots) and Encore VFX. Additional work was done by Studio 8 FX, Trace VFX and Almost Gold. Because of the series' tight budget and timeline the production {{made the decision to}} do most of the effects in-camera and only enhance them digitally where appropriate. In fact for a great number of shots which involved the sensates communicating and visiting each other telepathically the cast were simply moving {{in and out of the}} frame in timely fashion requiring no additional work. According to Glass, most of the VFX work that was done is invisible in the final show and consisted mostly of split-screens, crew and rig removal, weather augmentation and screen inserts. Executive producer Grant Hill commented he would be impressed if one would <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>recognize</b> as many as 150 of the 1200 VFX shots, because most of them consisted of small things used to help the narrative, and they do not call attention to themselves. Of the more visible work done, Glass provided the examples of age manipulation of actors, dramatic enhancement of the weather in the car scenes in Iceland, a few greenscreens, and computer generated blades, blood and wounds.|$|E

25|$|An IoT-enabled {{intelligent}} system of such cases was proposed in 2001 and later demonstrated in 2014 by the National Science Foundation Industry/University Collaborative Research Center for Intelligent Maintenance Systems (IMS) at the University of Cincinnati on {{a band saw}} machine in IMTS 2014 in Chicago. Band saw machines are not necessarily expensive, but the band saw belt expenses are enormous since they degrade much faster. However, without sensing and intelligent analytics, it can be only determined by experience when the band saw belt will actually break. The developed prognostics system will <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>recognize</b> and monitor the degradation of band saw belts even if the condition is changing, advising users when {{is the best time}} to replace band saw. This will significantly improve user experience and operator safety and ultimately save on costs.|$|E
25|$|As {{early as}} 1972 Genie scored between the level an 8-year-old and an adult on all right-hemisphere tasks the {{scientists}} tested her on, and showed extraordinarily rapid improvement on them. Her ability {{to piece together}} objects solely from tactile information was exceptionally good, and on spatial awareness tests her scores were reportedly the highest ever recorded. Similarly, on a Mooney Face Test in May 1975 she had {{the highest score in}} medical literature at that time, and on a separate gestalt perception test her extrapolated score was in the 95th percentile for adults. On several other tests involving right-hemisphere tasks, her results were markedly better than other people in equivalent phases of mental development; in 1977 the scientists measured her capacity for stereognosis at approximately the level of a typical 10-year-old, significantly higher than her estimated mental age. The scientists also noted in 1974 that Genie seemed to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>recognize</b> the location she was in and was good at getting from one place to another, an ability which primarily involves the right hemisphere.|$|E

500|$|The art {{style was}} {{influenced}} by a simplification approach, eliminating enough details but keeping overall shapes to make objects clearly recognizable. According to Antonio, they took inspiration for simplification from real-world photography, artwork, and from the environments of the games Journey, Team Fortress 2, and Mirror's Edge. They still wanted {{to ensure that a}} player would <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>recognize</b> an area of the island they were in based on the visual appearance, such as by the types of trees around them, and assured there was enough distinction while simplifying the assets to make this possible. Blow's team was also able to engage with Fourm Design Studio, a real-world architecture firm, and Fletcher Studio, a landscape architecture team, to help develop the environments for The Witness. According to Fourm's founder, Deanna Van Buren, they developed the various manmade and cultivated areas based on the concept of three different civilization periods, with later civilizations building on the structures from earlier ones and repurposing these structures as needed. Their studios helped to bring design principles to the main development team, allowing them to then extrapolate their own ideas for the final game. Blow said that the guidance and advice of the architects helped to craft the island in a way that [...] "feels more immersive just because the details are in place, and your brain kind of picks up on it". Blow gives an example of how many of the buildings on the island are in various states of deterioration, but were designed as fully detailed and complete structures and purposely worn down to create the ruined look; the resulting structures retain logically-consistent details, such as the remains of wooden support posts for rotted-away stairways in a castle, that aid in immersion for the player.|$|E

40|$|Aberrant {{blood vessels}} enable tumor growth, provide {{a barrier to}} immune infiltration, {{and serve as a}} source of pro-tumorigenic signals. Targeting tumor blood vessels for destruction, or tumor {{vascular}} disruption therapy, can therefore provide significant therapeutic benefit. Here I describe the development of two chimeric antigen receptors (CAR) s against the tumor vasculature, targeting either tumor endothelial marker 1 (TEM 1) or prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA). CAR T cells incorporating scFv 78, an scFv isolated against TEM 1, <b>were</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>recognize</b> immobilized plate-bound TEM 1 protein, but were unable <b>to</b> <b>recognize</b> TEM 1 on the surface of endothelial cell targets. In contrast, anti-PSMA CAR T cells, which incorporate the J 591 scFv, <b>were</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>recognize</b> human PSMA (hPSMA) both in vitro and in vivo. To elucidate the role of intracellular signaling domains on endothelial cell killing, a panel of the J 591 -based CAR T cells was characterized, each harboring a different combination of the intracellular signaling domains, CD 3 zeta (z), CD 28 (28), and CD 137 / 4 - 1 BB (BB). I found that all anti-hPSMA CAR T cells <b>were</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>recognize</b> and eliminate PSMA+ endothelial targets in vitro, regardless of signaling domain. Furthermore, T cells bearing the 3 rd generation anti-hPSMA CAR, P 28 BBz, <b>were</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>recognize</b> and kill primary human endothelial cells isolated from gynecological cancers. In addition, the P 28 BBz CAR T cells <b>were</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> mediate regression of hPSMA-expressing vascular neoplasms in mice. Finally, in murine ovarian cancers models populated by murine vessels expressing hPSMA, the P 28 BBz CAR T cells <b>were</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> ablate PSMA+ vessels, cause secondary depletion of tumor cells, and reduce tumor burden. Taken together, these results provide strong rationale for the use of CAR T cells as agents of tumor vascular disruption, specifically those targeting PSMA...|$|R
