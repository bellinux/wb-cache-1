50|$|<b>Boarfishes</b> {{are a small}} family, Caproidae, {{of marine}} fishes {{comprising}} two genera and 12 species. They were formerly placed in the order Zeiformes with the dories, but are now placed with the Perciformes since they have many perciform characteristics, for instance in the caudal skeleton. <b>Boarfishes</b> are native to the Indian, Atlantic, and Pacific Oceans, where they are mainly found at depths below 50 m.|$|E
50|$|The <b>boarfishes</b> (Caproidae) {{have been}} {{included}} in this order though they are currently included in the Perciformes.|$|E
50|$|<b>Boarfishes</b> {{have deep}} and thin bodies. They are small, {{with only a}} few species known to reach a maximum total length of 30 cm. Their {{coloration}} is red, pink, and silvery.|$|E

40|$|The <b>Boarfish</b> (Capros aper, Linnaeus) is a {{relatively}} small deep bodied fish growing up to 23 cm in total length. Typically reddish in colour with large eyes and a highly protrusible mouth <b>boarfish</b> are known to inhabit shallow shelf seas to shelf slopes from 40 - 600 m. <b>Boarfish</b> are a mesopelagic shoaling species distributed in the eastern Atlantic from Norway to Senegal including the Mediterranean. Exploratory fishing for <b>boarfish</b> by Irish vessels began in the later 1980 s when commercial quantities were encountered during the spring horse mackerel (Trachurus trachurus) and mackerel (Scrombrus scomber) fishery in northern Biscay. During the early 2000 s the Irish landings were relatively small ( 99 %) which {{is in contrast to}} the primarily on-shelf distribution of commercial catches. The biomass and abundance estimates presented here were calculated using a modelled TS-length relationship, from as yet unpublished data for <b>boarfish</b> and applied retrospectively to acoustic data.

50|$|Spawning {{primarily}} {{occurs in}} the summer along both the Atlantic and the U. Gulf of Mexico coasts, with peaks during July and August. Large congregations of tripletails {{during the summer months}} in the inshore and nearshore waters of coastal Georgia suggest this area is a critical estuarian spawning habitat for the species. Larval Atlantic tripletails go though four levels of development; preflexion, flexion, postflexion, and transformation. By the time the larvae reach 0.16 in (4 mm), they have large eyes and concave heads. The larval forms of Atlantic tripletails resemble those of <b>boarfishes,</b> some jacks, spadefishes, and bass.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Boarfish</b> {{sailed to}} the South China Sea {{to patrol the}} coast of French Indochina. Early on 21 January, the submarine's radar picked up a small convoy {{of five or six}} small ships. <b>Boarfish</b> closed the convoy three times in three hours, firing 16 torpedoes, all of which {{apparently}} passed under the targets. She broke off the attack at daybreak and did not regain contact. On 31 January, the boat made another radar contact on two cargo ships under escort. During <b>Boarfish’s</b> initial approach, an escort sighted the submarine and chased her away. The boat then fired her torpedoes at periscope depth and scored hits on both ships. When <b>Boarfish</b> submerged to avoid the escorts, she left Enki Maru (6,968 tons) sinking and Taietsu Maru (6,890 tons) burning fiercely and beached nearby. Even while avoiding depth charges, <b>Boarfish</b> tried to close the beach to finish the job. She abandoned the attempt after 36 hours because fire had so ravaged the cargo ship that she seemed unsalvageable. Taietsu Maru was destroyed completely by American planes of the 14th Air Force later that same day, and <b>Boarfish</b> received partial credit for the sinking. The submarine ended her first patrol on 15 February when she pulled into Fremantle, Australia, for refit alongside submarine tender [...]|$|R

40|$|<b>Boarfish</b> (Capros aper) {{abundance}} {{has increased}} dramatically in the Northeast Atlantic from the early 1970 s after successive years of good recruitment attributed {{to an increase in}} sea surface temperature. Due to increased commercial fishing over recent years, an acoustic <b>boarfish</b> survey funded by the Killybegs Fishermen's Organisation was initiated by the Marine Institute to establish a baseline for the future management of this stock. In the absence of any species-specific <b>boarfish</b> target strength (TS), acoustic backscatter was estimated by a Kirchhoff-ray mode model using reconstructed three-dimensional swimbladder shapes which were computed from magnetic resonance imaging scans of whole fish. The model predicted TS as a function of size, fish tilt angle, and operating frequency. Standardized directivity patterns revealed the increasing importance of changes in the inclination of the dorsal swimbladder surface at higher frequencies (120 and 200 kHz) and a less directive response at lower frequencies (18 and 38 kHz). The model predicted a TS-to-total fish length relationship of TS = 20 log 10 (L) - 66. 2. The intercept is ~ 1 dB higher than in the general physoclist relationship, potentially reflecting the bulky nature of the <b>boarfish</b> swimbladder with its relatively large circumference...|$|R

40|$|The feeding {{behaviour}} of two potentially competing species, the longspine snipefish, Macroramphosus scolopax, and the <b>boarfish</b> Capros aper was examined. While both species are very abundant along the Mediterranean coast and are regularly caught by demersal trawlers, {{they are of}} no commercial value. The diets of <b>boarfish</b> and longspine snipefish were investigated from samples collected between January 2001 and May 2002. Variations in the diet with fish size and season, as well as diet overlap and diversity were explored. Mysid shrimps, amphipods and gastropods {{were the most important}} food items in the diet of longspine snipefish. During ontogenetic development, M. scolopax occupies different trophic levels: the diet shifts from being predominantly composed of mysids (Anchialina agilis, Lophogaster typicus, Erythrops sp., Leptomysis spp.) in the smaller longspine snipefish [ 6. 5 cm TL). Crustacean decapods and copepods were the most important prey in the stomachs of <b>boarfish.</b> Mysids (Lo. typicus), euphausiids and nematodes were present in the larger individuals (> 8 cm TL). A more generalist diet, still containing copepods, crustacean decapods, gastropods (Limacina retroversa) and a large variety of amphipods (e. g. Phtysica marina, Stenotoe bosphorana) and mysids (e. g. A. agilis, Leptomysis spp., Erythrops sp.), dominated the diet of C. aper between 2 and 8 cm TL. Diet overlap between longspine snipefish and <b>boarfish</b> was very low and the differences in stomach species diversity were explained by season and fish size...|$|R
50|$|<b>Boarfish</b> {{remained}} in the San Diego area until 15 November 1947 except for one cruise to Pearl Harbor in February 1947 and another to Alaska and Canada between July and November. Commensing 30 July 1947 <b>Boarfish</b> was the flagship of the first exploration under the Polar Ice Cap in the Bering Strait, this mission designated as Task Group 17.3 Operation Blue Nose {{under the command of}} R. Adm. Allan Rockwell McCann for the purpose of testing the under-ice use of Sonar, developed by Dr. Waldo K. Lyon, director of the Arctic Submarine Laboratory, who was also aboard. On 15 November, the submarine entered the Mare Island Naval Shipyard for overhaul before transfer to the Turkish Navy. She left Mare Island on 21 February 1948 and steamed via San Diego, Panama, New London, Malta, and Port Argostoli, Greece, to Izmir, Turkey. On 23 May, <b>Boarfish</b> was decommissioned and immediately recommissioned in the Turkish Navy as TCG Sakarya (S 332), the second submarine named in honor of the 1921 Battle of Sakarya.|$|R

The commercial fishing vessel MFV Felucca was employed for the survey and the vessels hull mounted transducer was calibrated for scientific output.
