5|$|A {{total of}} eight boxers qualified. David Price and Tony Jeffries both won bronze {{medals in the}} super heavyweight and light heavyweight {{divisions}} respectively. Middleweight James DeGale {{won a gold medal}} in the middleweight class. It {{was the first time that}} Great <b>Britain</b> <b>has</b> won more than one medal in boxing in a single games since 1972, and the best result for Great Britain in boxing since 1956.|$|E
5|$|Great <b>Britain</b> <b>has</b> 19 {{operating}} reactors, producing about 20% of its electricity. It processes {{much of its}} {{spent fuel}} at Sellafield on the northwest coast across from Ireland, where nuclear waste is vitrified and sealed in stainless steel canisters for dry storage above ground for at least 50 years before eventual deep geologic disposal. Sellafield {{has a history of}} environmental and safety problems, including a fire in a nuclear plant in Windscale, and a significant incident in 2005 at the main reprocessing plant (THORP).|$|E
50|$|Introduced at the 1996 Olympics, the {{two women}} that <b>Britain</b> <b>had</b> of any calibre, Audrey Cooper (aged 31) and Amanda Glover (aged 25), had to train in Amsterdam as <b>Britain</b> <b>had</b> no court for beach volleyball. They {{qualified}} that year to reach the Olympics. This {{was the first time}} that <b>Britain</b> <b>had</b> ever qualified for volleyball in the Olympics, having qualified in March 1996. They had practised on Bournemouth beach.|$|R

5|$|Inscriptions for the {{practice}} of magic in Gaul show the characteristic use of Greek for spells in the Imperial period. A 2nd-century curse tablet from Autun (Augustodunum) lists the names of those to be cursed in Latin, two magic words in Greek, and a series of voces magicae. A defixio (binding spell) from Amélie-les-Bains seems composed in Celtic with bits of Latin. A lamella from Roman <b>Britain</b> <b>has</b> been interpreted as Hebrew written in Greek characters.|$|E
5|$|Women's {{literature}} in <b>Britain</b> <b>has</b> {{had a long}} and often troubled history, with many female writers producing work under a pen name, such as George Eliot. Other great female novelists that have contributed to world literature are Frances Burney, Frances Hodgson Burnett, Jane Austen and the Brontë sisters, Emily, Charlotte and Anne.|$|E
5|$|Great <b>Britain</b> <b>has</b> been {{challenged}} by other powers, primarily the German Empire and the Third Reich during the 20th century. A century earlier it vied with Napoleonic France for global pre-eminence, and Hannoverian Britain's natural allies were the kingdoms and principalities of northern Germany. By {{the middle of}} the 19th century, Britain and France were allies in preventing Russia's appropriation of the Ottoman Empire (although the fear of French invasion led shortly afterwards {{to the creation of the}} Volunteer Force. By the first decade of the 20th century, the United Kingdom was allied with France (by the Entente Cordiale) and Russia (which had a secret agreement with France for mutual support in a war against the Prussian-led German Empire and the Austro-Hungarian Empire).|$|E

5|$|Great Britain's medal {{performance}} at the 2008 Summer Olympics was its best in a century; only its {{performance at}} the 1908 Summer Olympics, which Britain hosted in London, resulted in more gold medals being awarded. The total medal count, 47, is also the fourth highest Great <b>Britain</b> <b>has</b> ever achieved, with only the 1908, 2012 and 2016 Games resulting in more medals. Following retests of doping samples in 2016 {{in connection with the}} Russian doping scandal, 4 further medals, all bronze, are expected to be awarded in athletics, retrospectively bringing the total gained to 51. As of October 2017, the award of the bronze medals to the Men's and Women's 4 x 400 metres relay teams has brought the official medal total to 49. Goldie Sayers and Kelly Sotherton await reallocation of further medals.|$|E
5|$|Characteristics {{typically}} {{used in the}} field to distinguish Hygrophoropsis aurantiaca from lookalike species include: the soft, dry consistency of its cap; the crowded, decurrent, and forked gills that are saffron to orange coloured; and the lack of any distinctive taste or odour. The false chanterelle can be distinguished from the true chanterelle (Cantharellus cibarius) by its deeper orange colour, brown base to the stipe, velvety cap surface, forked gills rather than gill-like ridges, softer (and thinner) flesh, and lack of the characteristic apricot-smell. The cap surface of Hygrophoropsis fuscosquamula, found in <b>Britain,</b> <b>has</b> fine brown scales overlaying a dull orange background. H.rufa has velvety brown fur covering its cap, while H.macrospora has cream gills and stipe. Microscopically, these three species have larger spores than H.aurantiaca. H.tapinia, found in a range extending from southern Florida to Central America, is set apart from H.aurantiaca by its growth on or under deciduous trees (never conifers), and smaller spores, which measure 3.3–4.8 by 2.5–3.3µm.|$|E
5|$|Skara Brae, Maeshowe, the Ring of Brodgar and the Stones of Stenness {{together}} {{form the}} Heart of Neolithic Orkney UNESCO World Heritage Site {{in the western}} part of the Orkney Mainland and which was inscribed in 1999. This small area has provided a rich archaeological heritage in a location that is relatively remote from both the main centres of population in Scotland and from more densely populated parts of Europe. However, it would be a mistake to imagine that because Orkney is so placed today that this was always so. There is a substantial amount of evidence that suggests that a variety of the smaller islands in the British Isles developed an advanced society in the Neolithic that took several centuries longer to develop on the mainland of Great Britain. It is also clear that whilst the flow of ideas and technologies in <b>Britain</b> <b>has</b> often been from the south to the north, that at this time, it is evident that Orkney played a significant role in the development of British Neolithic culture.|$|E

Austria had been defeated by France twice in recent memory and wanted revenge, so it joined the coalition a few months later.|$|R
50|$|Kenya's {{relations}} with the UK were debated in Britain's parliament.

5000|$|In this context, Great Britain's perfidy was political: in {{the early}} days of the French Revolution many in Great <b>Britain</b> <b>had</b> looked upon the Revolution with mild favour, but {{following}} the overthrow and execution of Louis XVI, <b>Britain</b> <b>had</b> allied herself with the other monarchies of Europe against the Revolution in France.
