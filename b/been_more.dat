For example, teak <b>is</b> <b>more</b> expensive than cherry, which <b>is</b> <b>more</b> expensive than maple, which <b>is</b> <b>more</b> expensive than oak.

Singlewomen may have <b>been</b> much <b>more</b> prevalent in cities because sex ratios <b>were</b> <b>more</b> equal in rural areas.

5|$|A full-grown Scelidosaurus {{was rather}} small {{compared}} to most later non-avian dinosaurs, {{but it was a}} medium-sized species in the Early Jurassic. Some scientists have estimated a length of 4metres (13ft). In 2010, Gregory S. Paul gave a body length of 3.8 metres (12.5ft) and a weight of 270 kilogrammes. Scelidosaurus was quadrupedal, with the hindlimbs longer than the forelimbs. It may have reared up on its hind legs to browse on foliage from trees, but its arms were relatively long, indicating a mostly quadrupedal posture. A trackway from the Holy Cross Mountains of Poland shows a scelidosaur like animal walking in a bipedal manner, hinting that Scelidosaurus may have <b>been</b> <b>more</b> proficient at bipedalism than previously thought.|$|E
5|$|A {{new line}} to Rodeløkka was opened on 3 January 1955.

The balloon loop was built around the block of Dælenengata, Fagerheimgata, Marstrandgata and Københavngata. The line {{was connected to the}} old Rodeløkka Line with a triangular loop in Københavngata. On 23 April 1961, all traffic on the Rodeløkka Line was terminated.
