As he has only had two stories in the first season before his character was cut, there is no visible theme in his storytelling <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>seem</b> to be about incredibly powerful evil forces (ones never proved innocent or misunderstood like some others).

25|$|The {{excursions}} sometimes {{evolved into}} rowdy gatherings and legislation was passed to prevent this. A commission established in 1805 issued instructions which prohibited {{the consumption of}} food or drink as well as music or {{any other kind of}} cheerful behaviour in the cemetery. The gravediggers, who lived on the premises, were to enforce these restrictions <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>seem</b> to have taken their duties lightly. Legislation from 1813 prohibited them to sell alcohol to visitors to the cemetery. Despite all these efforts, the desired peace and quiet was a long time in coming. For particularly grand funerals, crowds of spectators would gather, and people would festoon the cemetery walls to get a better view. To reduce numbers of visitors, there was talk of introducing admission fees, but this was never carried out.|$|E
500|$|The exact {{origins of}} the Poitou breed are unknown, but donkeys and their use in the {{breeding}} of mules may have been introduced to the Poitou region of France by the Roman Empire. The Baudet de Poitou (donkey of Poitou), and the Mulassière (mule breeder) horse breed (also known as the Poitevin) were developed together {{for the use of}} producing superior mules. In the Middle Ages, owning a Poitou donkey may have been a status symbol among the local French nobility. It is not known when the Poitou's distinctive characteristics were gained <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>seem</b> to have been well-developed by 1717 when an advisor to King Louis XV described: ...|$|E

500|$|On {{the evening}} of 15 November Malcolm ordered the ship's boats of the {{squadron}} to approach the anchorage under cover of darkness, commanded by Lieutenant Joseph Needham Taylor. The boats had been equipped with Congreve rockets, a recently invented artillery system which was not then widely in use by the Royal Navy. None of the rockets fired during the night appeared to have hit their targets, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>seem</b> to have panicked the French crews; dawn the following morning revealed that both frigates had cut their anchors and drifted onto the shore, Elisa in particular had struck hard and heeled over onto her side. Both ships were however [...] successfully refloated by the rising tide on 16 November, and the situation reached an impasse, with Malcolm's forces blockading Saint-Vaast-la-Hougue to prevent the French from sailing.|$|E
500|$|During {{preparations}} [...] for {{the first}} German performance of Noye's Fludde in Ettal, planned for May 1959, {{the problem of the}} scarcity of handbells [...] became acute. Britten suggested that in the absence of handbells a set of tubular bells in E flat in groups of twos and threes could be played by four or six children with two hammers each to enable them to strike the chords. Britten was not present in Ettal, but he learned from Ernst Roth, of Boosey & Hawkes, that the Ettal production had substituted glockenspiel and metallophone for the handbells; according to Roth the bells in Carl Orff's Schulwerk percussion ensembles were [...] "too weak" [...] for the purpose. Britten later wrote to a friend: [...] "I am rather relieved that I wasn't there! – no church, no bugles, no handbells, no recorders – <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>seem</b> to have done it {{with a great deal of}} care all the same. Still I rather hanker after doing it in Darmstadt as we want it – even importing handbells for instance." ...|$|E
500|$|Both of Richard's illegitimate {{children}} survived him, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>seem</b> to {{have died}} without issue and their fate after Richard's demise at Bosworth is not certain. John received a £20 annuity from Henry VII, {{but there are no}} mentions of him in contemporary records after 1487 (the year of the Battle of Stoke Field). He may have been executed in 1499, though no record of this exists beyond an assertion by George Buck over a century later. Katherine apparently died before her cousin Elizabeth of York's coronation on 25 November 1487, since her husband Sir William Herbert is described as a widower by that time. Katherine's burial place was located in the London parish church of St James Garlickhithe, between Skinner's Lane and Upper Thames Street. The mysterious Richard Plantagenet, who was first mentioned in Francis Peck's Desiderata Curiosa (a two-volume miscellany published 1732–1735) was said to be a possible illegitimate child of Richard III and is sometimes referred to as [...] "Richard the Master-Builder" [...] or [...] "Richard of Eastwell", but it has also been suggested he could have been Richard, Duke of York, one of the missing Princes in the Tower. He died in 1550.|$|E

500|$|Sean Kinney {{said about}} the new album and the fans' mixed {{reactions}} about the band moving on after Staley's death: [...] "Look, it’s a big move to fucking stand up and move on. Some people, the music connected with them so strongly, their opinions, {{how they feel about}} it... It’s amazing that they have such a connection <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>seem</b> to act like it happened to them. This happened to us and Layne’s family, not them. This is actually our lives. If we’re okay with it, why can’t you be? This happened to us, this didn’t happen to you. But this album isn’t about that, it’s a bigger universal point. We’re all going to fucking die, we’re all going to lose somebody, and it fucking hurts. How do you move on? This record is us moving on, and hurting. That, to me, is a victory. I already feel like I’ve won." [...] "Sometimes people ask us, ‘Wouldn’t Layne have been pissed off that we did this?’ And I tell them {{it would have been the}} opposite: he would have been pissed off that it took us so long to do this. We’re not doing this for money; there is no money in the music business anymore. Jerry and I funded the whole album, and we spent lots of our own money, because we believe in this. And one of the reasons I’m doing this is so more light is turned on to something where the light was turned off." [...] And Cantrell added: [...] "We’ve toured around the world, we’ve lost some friends, we buried a dear friend, and somebody that you just can’t fucking replace, and then we’ve chosen by circumstance to get together again. That turned into ‘maybe we can fucking do this.’ And that turned into this".|$|E
2500|$|The Founding of Caunus: two {{comments}} in Parthenius's Love Stories {{are the only}} testament to this poem <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>seem</b> to give conflicting accounts. According to one, it deals {{with the story of}} Lyrcus; according to the other, it deals with the story of Byblis. This might indicate a loose, episodic structure, rather than a unified narrative. It might then be inferred that this kind of treatment was typical of his other foundation poems as well (the question of unity {{is one of the main}} issues even in Argonautica, which is sometimes termed an [...] "episodic epic"). Five hexameter verses attributed to Apollonius may be a fragment of this poem <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>seem</b> unrelated to the stories of Lyrcus and Byblis and some scholars think they come from the next poem.|$|E

2500|$|The Perioikoi {{came from}} similar origins as the helots but {{occupied}} a significantly different position in Spartan society. [...] Although {{they did not}} enjoy full citizen-rights, they were free and not subjected to the same restrictions as the helots. [...] The exact nature of their subjection to the Spartans is not clear, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>seem</b> to have served partly {{as a kind of}} military reserve, partly as skilled craftsmen and partly as agents of foreign trade. [...] Perioikoic hoplites served increasingly with the Spartan army, explicitly at the Battle of Plataea, and although they may also have fulfilled functions such as the manufacture and repair of armour and weapons, they were increasingly integrated into the combat units of the Spartan army as the Spartiate population declined.|$|E
2500|$|Multi-story {{apartment}} blocks called insulae catered {{to a range}} of residential needs. The cheapest rooms were at the top owing to the inability to escape {{in the event of a}} fire and the lack of piped water. Windows were mostly small, facing the street, with iron security bars. Insulae were often dangerous, unhealthy, and prone to fires because of overcrowding and haphazard cooking arrangements. There are examples in the Roman port town of Ostia, that date back to the reign of Trajan, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>seem</b> to have been found only in Rome and a few other places. [...] Elsewhere writers report them as something remarkable, but Livy and Vituvius refer to them in Rome. [...] External walls were in [...] "Opus Reticulatum" [...] and interiors in [...] "Opus Incertum", which would then be plastered and sometimes painted.|$|E
2500|$|Moose lack {{upper front}} teeth, but have eight sharp incisors {{on the lower}} jaw. They also have a tough tongue, lips and gums, which aid in the eating of woody vegetation. Moose have six pairs of large, flat molars and, ahead of those, six pairs of premolars, to grind up their food. A moose's upper lip is very sensitive, to help {{distinguish}} between fresh shoots and harder twigs, and the lip is prehensile, for grasping their food. In the summer, moose may use this prehensile lip for grabbing branches and pulling, stripping the entire branch of leaves in a single mouthful, or for pulling forbs, like dandelions, or aquatic plants up by the base, roots and all. A moose's diet often depends on its location, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>seem</b> to prefer the new growths from deciduous trees with a high sugar content, such as white birch, trembling aspen and striped maple, among many others. To reach high branches, a moose may bend small saplings down, using its prehensile lip, mouth or body. For larger trees a moose may stand erect and walk upright on its hind legs, allowing it to reach branches up to [...] or higher above the ground.|$|E

2500|$|On {{the next}} four slabs, BM 525, BM 530, BM 528, and BM 527, the Greeks are meeting with little success. Each of the Greeks in this section bears some [...] armour or weapon, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>seem</b> to have been taken by {{surprise}} and are hard pressed to hold their own. One hero, BM 525:3, has lost his sword and now futilely arms himself with a small rock while retreating before a centaur. Elsewhere warriors hurry {{to the aid of}} comrades: 530:2, 52814. None of the Greeks achieves an unqualified victory. Rather than pitched duels, the mêlée breaks into multiple figure groups (BM 530:2, 3, 4, 5; BM 528:1, 2, 3; BM 527:1, 2, 3, 4) in which the distinction between victor and vanquished is often clouded. Appropriately for this kind of disorganized fight, the centaur attack employs weapons and tactics alien to the hoplites’ traditional mode of combat. One centaur (BM 525:2) swings a tree branch; others (BM 53(1) and 5) use huge stones; still another (BM 527:2) kicks and bites. Emblematic of this portion of the Centauromachy is the death of Kaineus, BM 530, where the hero, invulnerable to conventional weapons, is disposed of by being buried alive.|$|E
2500|$|The {{music video}} was filmed on March 30, 2010, in Beverly Hills, California, and was {{directed}} by Ray Kay, director of Bieber's [...] "Baby" [...] video. On the topic of choosing the lead girl, Kingston told MTV News, [...] "I picked the main girl, basically, because Justin is 16 and I'm 20 years old, so {{it had to be}} a girl that fit the both of us, because in the video and song, she's trying to play the both of us. So there had to be a contrast. She fit it perfectly." [...] Additionally, Kingston explained the plot of the video to Rap-Up, commenting, [...] "The video is basically about this girl trying to play both of us and at the end... we end up both at the same place at one time, and she's left with a stupid look on her face." [...] Appearances are made by Bieber's friend, Christian Beadles, as well as rapper Lil Romeo and singer/actress Jasmine Villegas, whose appearance further fuelled media speculation Villegas and Bieber were romantically involved after a previous appearance in his music video for 'Baby'. Jocelyn Vena of MTV News reviewed the video, [...] "Here's the play-by-play: While Kingston and the lady in question are flirting out on the deck, Bieber is chilling inside. But, wait — there she is flirting with Bieber while Kingston is hanging out, wondering where she went. The fickle girl eventually leaves Bieber to chill with Kingston, and then — boom — there she is with Bieber again. And, well, you get it. Of course, the 'eenie-meenie-miny-moe lover' eventually gets caught. While she's chatting up Kingston, along comes Bieber, and her game is blown. The dudes are cool with it. Well, they're not cool with her playing them, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>seem</b> to remain friends despite both going for the same girl." ...|$|E
