5|$|Chad's {{legal system}} {{is based on}} French civil law and Chadian {{customary}} law where the latter does not interfere with public order or constitutional guarantees of equality. Despite the constitution's guarantee of judicial independence, the president names most key judicial officials. The legal system's highest jurisdictions, the Supreme Court and the Constitutional Council, have become fully operational since 2000. The Supreme Court {{is made up of}} a chief justice, named <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>president,</b> <b>and</b> 15 councillors, appointed for life <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>and</b> the National Assembly. The Constitutional Court is headed by nine judges elected to nine-year terms. It has the power to review legislation, treaties and international agreements prior to their adoption.|$|E

The Tribunal may direct that the hearing of a reference be notified to any interested person or, where there is an interested class of persons, to one or more representatives of the class. If there is any interest that is affected which is not represented by counsel, the Tribunal may request that counsel argue the case for this interest.|$|E

5|$|Malawi is a democratic, multi-party government, {{currently}} {{under the leadership}} of Arthur Peter Mutharika, who defeated former president Joyce Banda in the 2014 elections, despite alleged poll rigging. The current constitution was put into place on 18 May 1995. The branches of the government consist of executive, legislative and judicial. The executive includes a president who is both chief of state and head of government, first and second vice presidents and a cabinet. The president is elected every five years, and the vice president is chosen by the president. A second vice president may be appointed by the president if so chosen, although they must be from a different party. The members of the cabinet are appointed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>and</b> can be from either inside or outside of the legislature.|$|E
5|$|The Court {{held that}} the {{exercises}} of discretion <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>and</b> the Minister under sections 8 and 10 of the ISA are reviewable by the courts because the subjective test that had been adopted in the 1969 Malaysian case Karam Singh v. Menteri Hal Ehwal Dalam Negeri (Minister of Home Affairs), Malaysia, which had been adopted locally in 1971 in Lee Mau Seng v. Minister for Home Affairs, {{could no longer be}} supported and should be replaced by an objective test. Furthermore, although a court would not question the executive's decision as to what national security required, the court could examine whether the executive's decision was indeed based on national security considerations.|$|E

The Chief of the General Staff is appointed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>and</b> is responsible to the Prime Minister. The Council of Ministers is responsible to the Parliament for matters of national security and the adequate preparation {{of the armed forces}} to defend the country.

5|$|Under the {{subjective}} test applied in Karam Singh and Lee Mau Seng, {{the exercise of}} discretion <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>and</b> the Minister under sections 8 and 10 of the ISA is not open to review.

In contrast, under the objective test, the exercise of discretion is reviewable by {{a court of law}} and the executive has to satisfy the court that there are objective facts justifying the executive's decision.|$|E
5|$|As the Supreme Commander-in-Chief of the Belarusian Armed Forces, the President has {{the duty}} to protect the Belarusian {{territory}} from internal and external forces. The president can call for {{a state of emergency}} in the following cases: natural disasters, a catastrophe, or unrest involving violence or the threat of violence. Regardless if the declaration affects the entire country or sections of it, the Council of the Republic must be notified <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>and</b> must seek their approval within three days of notification.

5|$|It {{should be}} made clear also that Joseph Kabila does not trust the military; the Republican Guard is the only {{component}} he trusts. Major General John Numbi, former Air Force chief, now inspector general of police, ran a parallel chain of command in the east to direct the 2009 Eastern Congo offensive, Operation Umoja Wetu; the regular chain of command was by-passed. Previously Numbi negotiated the agreement {{to carry out the}} mixage process with Laurent Nkunda. Commenting on a proposed vote of no confidence in the Minister of Defence in September 2012, Baoudin Amba Wetshi of lecongolais.cd described Ntolo as a 'scapegoat'. Wetshi said that all key military and security questions were handled in total secrecy <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>and</b> other civil and military personalities trusted by him, such as John Numbi, Gabriel Amisi Kumba ('Tango Four'), Delphin Kahimbi, and others such as Kalev Mutond and Pierre Lumbi Okongo.|$|E
5|$|Legislation {{defines the}} {{appearance}} {{and use of}} the Presidential Standard of Croatia {{as a symbol of the}} President of Croatia, and the appearance {{and use of the}} presidential sash as a symbol of honour of the office of the president. The presidential standard is a square, blue field with a thin border of alternating red and white squares on each side. In the centre of the blue field is the main shield of the coat of arms of Croatia with the historical arms of Croatia surrounding the main shield. From left to right, these are the oldest known coats of arms of Croatia, the Republic of Dubrovnik, Dalmatia, Istria and Slavonia, adorned with bands of gold, red and white stripes extending down vertically. Atop the shield there is a Croatian tricolour ribbon with golden letters RH that stand for the Republic of Croatia, executed in Roman square capitals. The presidential standard is flown on buildings of the Office of the President of Croatia, the residence of the president, transportation vehicles when in use <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>president,</b> <b>and</b> in other ceremonial occasions. The presidential standard was designed by Miroslav Šutej in 1990.|$|E
5|$|The Assistant Commandant is {{nominated}} for appointment <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>and</b> must be confirmed via majority {{vote by the}} Senate. In {{the event that the}} Commandant is absent or is unable to perform his duties, the Assistant Commandant assumes the duties and responsibilities of the Commandant. For this reason, the Assistant Commandant is appointed to a rank equal to the sitting Commandant; since 1971, each Assistant Commandant has been, by statute, a four-star general, making it the most common rank held among Marines serving this position. Additionally, he may perform other duties that the CMC assigns to him. Historically, the Assistant Comandant has served for two to three years. In recent decades, the Assistant Commandant has frequently been a Marine aviator. James F. Amos is the first aviator to serve as Assistant Commandant and then be promoted to Commandant.|$|E

5|$|The {{constitution}} of East Timor {{states that the}} president is the supreme commander of the defence force and has the power to appoint the F-FDTL's commander and chief of staff. The Council of Ministers and National Parliament are responsible for funding the F-FDTL and setting policy relating to East Timor's security. Cirilo José Cristovão serves as the current minister of Defence and Security, and Julio Tomas Pinto is the Secretary of State for Defense. Both men were sworn into these roles on 8 August 2012. A Superior Council for Defence and Security was established in 2005 to advise the president on defence and security policy and legislation and the appointment and dismissal of senior military personnel. The council is chaired <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>and</b> includes the prime minister, the defence, justice, interior and foreign affairs ministers, the heads of the F-FDTL and PNTL a national state security officer and three representatives from the national parliament. The council's role is not clear, however, and neither it nor the parliament served as a check against the decision to sack large numbers of F-FDTL personnel in 2006. A parliamentary committee also provides oversight of East Timor's security sector. Major General Lere Anan Timor is the current commander of the F-FDTL, and was appointed to this position on 6 October 2011.|$|E
5|$|The detainee {{is also to}} be {{informed}} within 14 days {{of his or her}} right to make representations against the order to an advisory board, which is required to hear and consider the detainee's representations. Each advisory board is chaired by a Supreme Court judge appointed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>President,</b> <b>and</b> has two other members appointed by the President in consultation with the Chief Justice. The board has the powers of a court to summon and examine witnesses, and to order that documents be produced. It evaluates the evidence and must make recommendations to the President concerning the matter within three months of the date of detention. When the advisory board recommends the release of the detainee against the Minister's decision, the President exercises personal discretion whether the detainee should be released. Before exercising his discretion, the President is required to consult the Council of Presidential Advisers.|$|E
5|$|The provincial {{administration}} {{is set up}} purely for administrative purposes. The province is headed by a minister appointed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>and</b> there are ministries of central government for each province. The administrative head of the province is the Permanent Secretary, appointed by the President. There is a Deputy Permanent Secretary, heads of government departments and civil servants at the provincial level. Central Province is divided into six districts: Chibombo District, Kabwe District, Kapiri Mposhi District, Mkushi District, Mumbwa District and Serenje District. All of the district headquarters {{are the same as}} the district names. There are six councils in the province, each of which is headed by an elected representative, called a councilor. Each councilor holds office for three years. The administrative staff of the council is selected based on the Local Government Service Commission from within or outside the district. The office of the provincial government is located in each of the district headquarters and has provincial local government officers and auditors. Each council is responsible for raising and collecting local taxes and the budgets of the council are audited and submitted every year after the annual budget. The elected members of the council do not draw salaries, but are paid allowances from the council. Central Province is predominantly rural and hence there are no city or municipal councils. The government stipulates 63 different functions for the councils, with the majority of them being infrastructure management and local administration. Councils are mandated to maintain each of their community centres, zoos, local parks, drainage systems, playgrounds, cemeteries, caravan sites, libraries, museums and art galleries. They also work with specific government departments for helping in agriculture, conservation of natural resources, providing postal service, and establishing and maintaining hospitals, schools and colleges. The councils prepare schemes that encourage community participation.|$|E
