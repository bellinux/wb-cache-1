40|$|ABSTRACT: Composites and hybrid {{composites}} were manufactured from renewable materials {{based on}} jute fibers, regenerated cellulose fibers (Lyocell), and thermo-setting polymer from soybean oil. Three {{different types of}} jute fabrics with <b>biaxial</b> <b>weave</b> architecture but different surface weights, and carded Lyocell fiber were used as reinforcements. Hybrid composites were also manufac-tured by combining the jute reinforcements with the Lyo-cell. The Lyocell composite {{was found to have}} better mechanical properties than other composites. It has ten-sile strength and modulus of about 144 MPa and 18 GPa, respectively. The jute composites also have relatively good mechanical properties, as their tensile strengths and moduli were found to be between 65 and 84 MPa, and between 14 and 19 GPa, respectively. The Lyocell-rein-forced composite showed the highest flexural strength and modulus, of about 217 MPa and 13 GPa, respectively. In all cases, the hybrid composites in this study showed improved mechanical properties but lower storage modu-lus. The Lyocell fiber gave the highest impact strength of about 35 kJ/m 2, which could be a result of its mor-phology. Dynamic mechanical analysis showed that the Lyocell reinforced composite has the best viscoelasti...|$|E
40|$|An {{overall goal}} of this {{research}} has been to enhance {{our understanding of the}} scientific principles necessary to develop advanced ultrasonic nondestructive techniques for the quantitative characterization of advanced composite structures. To this end, we have investigated a thin woven composite (5 -harness <b>biaxial</b> <b>weave).</b> We have studied the effects that variations of the physical parameters of the experimental setup can have on the ultrasonic determination of the material properties for this thin composite. In particular, we have considered the variation of the nominal center frequency and the f-number of the transmitting transducer which in turn address issues such as focusing and beam spread of ultrasonic fields. This study has employed a planar, two-dimensional, receiving pseudo-array that has permitted investigation of the diffraction patterns of ultrasonic fields. Distortion of the ultrasonic field due to the spatial anisotropy of the thin composite has prompted investigation of the phenomenon of phase cancellation at the face of a finite-aperture, piezoelectric receiver. We have performed phase-sensitive and phase-insensitive analyses to provide a measure of the amount of phase cancellation at the face of a finite-aperture, piezoelectric receiver. The pursuit of robust measurements of received energy (i. e., those not susceptible to phase cancellation at the face of a finite-aperture, piezoelectric receiver) supports the development of robust techniques to determine material properties from measure ultrasonic parameters...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reports the}} results of the {{assessment}} of the effect of damage during installation (DDI) on the short-term mechanical behaviour and on the soil-geosynthetics interface strength of a <b>biaxial</b> <b>woven</b> polyester ge-ogrid. This material has been subjected to field damage tests, using two different soils and two compaction energies. To characterize the effect of the damage induced in the mechanical behaviour of geosynthetics, ten-sile tests (short-term behaviour), were carried out, according with the procedures described in EN ISO 10319. Simultaneously a test program was implemented to carry out pullout tests (according with EN 13738) and in-clined plane shear tests (EN ISO 12957 - 2) to characterize the strength of the soil-geosynthetic interface. The results of the study are presented and analysed. The values of the corresponding reduction factors to consid-erer the effects of DDI are also presented. Finally, the main conclusions are put forward...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe dynamic {{frictional}} {{properties of}} the soil-geosynthetic interface {{play an important role}} in the design and stability analysis of geosynthetic-reinforced soil structures under repeated loadings, such as those induced by compaction, traffic and earthquakes. This paper describes a laboratory study carried out using a large-scale direct shear test device, aiming to investigate the cyclic and post-cyclic behaviour of an interface between a granite residual soil and a <b>biaxial</b> <b>woven</b> geogrid. In the cyclic direct shear tests, the interface was subjected to 40 cycles of sinusoidal displacement, with semi-amplitude and frequency ranging from 1 - 10 mm and 0. 05 - 0. 5 Hz, respectively. To evaluate the effect of the cyclic loading on the interface shear strength, monotonic direct shear tests were performed immediately following the cyclic tests. The results indicated that the loading frequency has little impact on the interface shear stiffness during the loading cycles. In contrast, the influence of the displacement semi-amplitude on the interface stiffness was found to be significant. The cyclic loading did not lead to the degradation of the post-cyclic interface shear strength. The post-cyclic peak shear strength tended to increase with the semi-amplitude of the shear displacement, which may be associated with an increase in soil density...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{response}} {{to the relationship between}} perform structural parameters and the composites properties, a newly geometrical modeling of 2 D <b>biaxial</b> orthogonal <b>woven</b> fabric was established in this paper. Based on the yarn’s true configuration, the SEM image of the yarn cross-section was taken, geometrical parameters (the individual tow geometry and weaving pattern of the fabrics) are introduced in order to describe the general families of woven fabrics. The tow waviness can be described by combinations between undulated and straight segments and the tow cross-section can be described by lenticular shape. When the geometrical model was used to predict the structural properties of the fabric, the predicted values show good agreement with the measured ones. The geometrical model proposed here is intended as the foundation for further design and analytical of the mechanical properties of the composite materials reinforced with these fabrics...|$|R
40|$|Architectural fabric, or tensile fabric, {{structural}} fabric has become popular {{over the last}} decades. The {{structural fabric}} is used for shading public areas such as airport, boat docks, sport areas, public bus stops, and car parking. The most important advantages of the architectural fabric structure are low weight and more economical designs. In this research, three different fabric materials were studied to investigate the strain and stress in the fabric during time of using in the shading. The present work focuses on 2 D <b>biaxial</b> orthogonal <b>woven</b> structure, among which plain weave is the distinct category. 2 D means that the woven fabric features only in-plane reinforcing properties. Biaxial means that yarns are aligned along two directions: the warp and weft directions. Orthogonal means that the warp and weft yarns are laid down at 90 ° with respect to each other. The present work is aimed at developing a theoretical approach for prediction of fabric strain–stress relation {{based on the results}} achieved by experimental studies...|$|R
40|$|Most {{commercial}} available {{natural fibre}} composites {{are based on}} random discontinuous fibre composite systems. The development of continuous natural fibre reinforced polymers is essential for manufacturing materials {{that can be used}} in load bearing applications. Similar to traditional composite polymer materials, high-performance natural fibre composite systems should be based on continuous textile reinforcements like unidirectional tapes or woven fabrics. The first problem to be addressed in this process is the optimisation of the yarn to be used in the manufacturing of the textile reinforcement. Subsequently, a number of different fabric types (i. e. <b>biaxial</b> plain <b>weaves,</b> unidirectional fabrics and non-crimp fabrics) were produced and evaluated as reinforcement in composites manufactured by well established manufacturing techniques such as hand lay-up, vacuum infusion, pultrusion and resin transfer moulding (RTM). As expected, the developed materials can not directly compete in terms of strength with unidirectional glass fibre composites. However, they are clearly able to compete with these materials in terms of stiffness, especially if the low density of flax is taken into account. High mechanical properties were obtained for unidirectional flax composite material...|$|R
40|$|Lock-in {{induction}} thermography {{was carried}} out on uniaxial, <b>biaxial,</b> and multi-ply <b>woven</b> carbon fiber reinforced polymers (CFRPs) at an induction frequency of approximately 300 kHz and at modulation frequencies of 0. 4 – 36 Hz to detect defects in them. The measurements were performed in reflection and transmission modes. In the uniaxial material, heating occurred {{far away from the}} excitation coil. Lines of minimal heating were observed. The modulation frequency dependence of the amplitude showed an inverse proportionality, indicating volume heating. The multiply woven CFRP plates with impacts of 3 and 5 J showed distinct contrast because of cracked fibers. The results were compared with those obtained using optically excited thermography and X-ray tomography...|$|R
40|$|The {{relationship}} between fiber geometry {{and the damage}} sequence under tensile loading has been investigated for a composite material reinforced with different textiles architectures such as mat (random fibers) and <b>woven</b> (<b>biaxial).</b> These composites are based on epoxy resin matrix cured with high temperature hardener. The system chosen for this work consists of a bifunctional epoxy, diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A (DGEBA), cured with a tetrafunctional amine, diaminodiphenyl sulfone (DDS). This system ensures the obtaining of a rigid transparent material with excellent mechanical properties in order to observe, analyze and identify the process and progress of the generated damage and the failure mechanism {{which leads to the}} materials fracture. Results demonstrated that the reinforcement textile architecture/geometry affects the generation of stress concentration sites augmenting the possibility of failure initiation and cracks propagation...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT – A major aspect in {{geosynthetics}} creep {{analysis is}} the load level {{applied to the}} specimen, usually referred {{as a percentage of}} the geosynthetic ultimate tensile strength (UTS). Since both tensile and creep standard tests are performed with in-isolation specimens, they may not reproduce the possibly significant effect of soil-geosynthetic interaction. A new creep testing machine was recently developed and successfully addressed this concern. However, further developments allowed tensile tests to be performed in the same conditions used in nonconventional creep ones. This paper presents the results of nonconventional tensile tests performed with a <b>woven</b> <b>biaxial</b> polyester geogrid. They were used to define its UTS in the same conditions employed in creep tests performed with the new equipment. Despite changes in tensile curves shapes were found, the UTS from confined, accelerated and confined-accelerated tensile tests were quite similar to those obtained with standard tensile test procedure...|$|R
40|$|Geosynthetic {{is one of}} {{reinforcement}} materials which is widely used in earth retaining structures. Previous researchers have carried out many studies on the soil-geosynthetic interaction. However, research on shear band is limited because o f its presence in micro scales which also {{makes it difficult to}} be determined and predicted. This research is a new contribution for Malaysia's engineering practice. There is no such research has been conducted in our country, on the local soil. In this study, three types o f silica sand were used. The coarse sand (D 5 o=l. 357 mm), medium sand (D 50 = 0. 571 mm) and fine sand (Dso^O. 286 mm). Pullout test were conducted for different governing parameters such as porosity, density, mean size and normal pressure at lOOkPa, 150 kPa and 200 kPa. There are two types of geosynthetics which were used as reinforcement. They are <b>biaxial</b> geogrids and <b>woven</b> geotextiles. The conventional machine used is Pull out box test where size o f box is 700 mm (length) X 550 mm (height) X 400 mm (width). The simulations of Pullout Tests were made and calibrated with the experimental study. Using Discrete Element Method (DEM), {{it was found that the}} shear bands existed in soil structure during movement of geosynthetics. Shear bands were predicted equivalent with sheared zone at the reinforced region. The higher thickness value was recorded by the simulation o f sand-geotextile interaction in coarse sand at 200 kPa. The shear band is 232 mm width and has a pore space at the tail o f the geotextile. Meanwhile, the lower thickness value was stated by the simulation o f geotextile-pullout in fine sand at lOOkPawhereby the band is just 88 mm width. Comparatively, the percentage different is 62. 07 % for the wider to small shear band thickness. It can be concluded that, the higher pullout force, the thicker shear band produced...|$|R
