5|$|Weaver {{embarked}} on a speaking tour across the northern plains and Pacific coast states. In late August, he turned South, hoping to break the Democrats' grip on those states. As in 1880, {{the issue of race}} hurt Weaver among white Southern voters, as he sought to attract <b>black</b> <b>voters</b> by urging cooperation between white and black farmers and calling for an end to lynchings. Weaver drew good crowds in the South, but {{he and his wife were}} also subjected to abuse from hecklers. Southern Democrats depicted Weaver as a threat to the conservative Democrats in power there; with the increasing disenfranchisement of <b>black</b> <b>voters,</b> this was to prove fatal to the Populists' hopes in the South.|$|E
5|$|During the campaign, Taylor was {{attacked}} by Democratic opponents because of his party's support from <b>black</b> <b>voters</b> and its ties to big business, including the Louisville and Nashville Railroad. They also charged that Governor Bradley had run a corrupt administration. Republicans answered with charges of factionalism and use of political machinery by Democrats. In particular, they derided the Goebel Election Law, which Taylor claimed subverted {{the will of the}} people.|$|E
5|$|The black {{nationalist}} movement in Southern Rhodesia, founded and organised by urban black elites {{during the late}} 1950s, was repeatedly banned by the colonial government because of the political violence, industrial sabotage and intimidation of potential <b>black</b> <b>voters</b> that characterised its campaign. The principal nationalist group, led by the Bulawayo trade unionist Joshua Nkomo, renamed itself with each post-ban reorganisation, and {{by the start of}} 1962 was called the Zimbabwe African People's Union (ZAPU). Attempting to win black political support, Whitehead proposed a number of reforms to racially discriminatory legislation, including the Land Apportionment Act, and promised to implement these if his UFP won the next Southern Rhodesian election. But intimidation by ZAPU of prospective <b>black</b> <b>voters</b> impeded the UFP's efforts to win their support, and much of the white community saw Whitehead as too radical, and soft on what they saw as black extremism. In the December 1962 Southern Rhodesian election, the UFP was defeated by the Rhodesian Front (RF), a newly formed alliance of conservative voices headed by Winston Field and Ian Smith, in what was widely considered a shock result. Field became Prime Minister, with Smith as his deputy.|$|E
5|$|The {{first known}} <b>black</b> <b>voter</b> after the amendment's {{adoption}} was Thomas Mundy Peterson, who cast his ballot on March 31, 1870, in a Perth Amboy, New Jersey referendum election adopting a revised city charter.|$|R
50|$|In 1955, Lamar Smith, a U.S. {{civil rights}} figure, black farmer, World War I veteran and an {{organizer}} of <b>black</b> <b>voter</b> registration, {{was shot to}} death mid-day on the lawn of the county courthouse in Brookhaven.|$|R
5000|$|In 2000, a {{proposed}} neighborhood within Columbia, Maryland's Kings Contrivance section {{was to have}} been named [...] "Gorman's Promise", though when the former U.S. senator's attempts at <b>black</b> <b>voter</b> disenfranchisement were made known, the naming was canceled.|$|R
5|$|United States Supreme Court {{decisions}} {{in the late nineteenth}} century interpreted the amendment narrowly. From 1890 to 1910, most <b>black</b> <b>voters</b> in the South were effectively disenfranchised by new state constitutions and state laws incorporating such obstacles as poll taxes and discriminatory literacy tests, from which white male voters were exempted by grandfather clauses. A system of whites-only primaries and violent intimidation by white groups also suppressed black participation.|$|E
5|$|In 1896, the National Association of Colored Women {{was formed}} to promote the needs of black women. Bethune served as the Florida chapter {{president}} of the NACW from 1917 to 1925. She worked to register <b>black</b> <b>voters,</b> which was resisted by white society and had been made almost impossible {{by a variety of}} obstacles in Florida law and practices controlled by white administrators. She was threatened by members of the resurgent Ku Klux Klan in those years. Bethune also served {{as the president of the}} Southeastern Federation of Colored Women's Clubs from 1920 to 1925, which worked to improve opportunities for black women.|$|E
5|$|Racial {{violence}} {{at the time}} was common throughout the nation, manifested as individual incidents of extra-legal actions, or attacks on entire communities. Lynchings reached a peak around the start of the 20th century as southern states were disenfranchising <b>black</b> <b>voters</b> and imposing white supremacy; white supremacists used it as a means of social control throughout the South. In 1866 Florida, as did many Southern states, passed laws called Black Codes disenfranchising black citizens. Although these were quickly overturned, and black citizens enjoyed a brief period of improved social standing, by the late 19th century black political influence was virtually nil. The white Democrat-dominated legislature passed a poll tax in 1885, which largely served to disenfranchise all poor voters. Losing political power, <b>black</b> <b>voters</b> suffered a deterioration of their legal and political rights in the years following. Without the right to vote, they were excluded as jurors and could not run for office, effectively excluding them from the political process. The United States as a whole was experiencing rapid social changes: an influx of European immigrants, industrialization and the growth of cities, and political experimentation in the North. In the South, black Americans grew increasingly dissatisfied with their lack of economic opportunity and status as second-class citizens.|$|E
50|$|Blacks {{were most}} {{adversely}} affected, {{and in many}} southern states <b>black</b> <b>voter</b> turnout dropped to zero. Poor whites were also disfranchised. In Alabama, for instance, by 1941, 600,000 poor whites had been disfranchised, as well as 520,000 blacks.|$|R
50|$|By {{the end of}} 1867 {{it seemed}} that {{virtually}} every <b>black</b> <b>voter</b> in the South had enrolled in the Union League, the Loyal League, or some equivalent local political organization. Meetings were generally held in a black church or school.|$|R
50|$|Although Baraka had {{personal}} criticisms {{reserved for}} Jesse Jackson, {{he believed that}} the Jackson campaign overall shifted the election towards the left. Baraka called for a focus on <b>black</b> <b>voter</b> registration and pushed the Rainbow Party in the direction of independent politics.|$|R
5|$|The later 19th {{century was}} a high point {{in the history of}} civil rights for African Americans. Reconstruction for a time limited the power of former slaveholders in Texas. Leaders, such as George T. Ruby and Norris Wright Cuney, worked to {{establish}} educational and employment opportunities for blacks and organize <b>black</b> <b>voters</b> to support the Republican Party, then the main party supporting black rights in the South. Cuney's efforts led to higher employment and higher wages for blacks in the city, especially on the wharves, and eventually led to combined black and white trade unions during the 1890s and early 1900s. Cuney himself rose to the chairmanship of the Texas Republican Party, the most powerful position held by any black American in the 19th century.|$|E
5|$|Hayes's later {{attempts}} {{to protect the}} rights of southern blacks were ineffective, as were his {{attempts to}} rebuild Republican strength in the South. He did, however, defeat Congress's efforts to curtail federal power to monitor federal elections. Democrats in Congress passed an army appropriation bill in 1879 with a rider that repealed the Enforcement Acts, which had been used to suppress the Ku Klux Klan. Those Acts, passed during Reconstruction, made it a crime to prevent someone from voting because of his race. Hayes was determined to preserve the law protecting <b>black</b> <b>voters,</b> and he vetoed the appropriation. The Democrats did not have enough votes to override the veto, but they passed a new bill with the same rider. Hayes vetoed this as well, and the process was repeated three times more. Finally, Hayes signed an appropriation without the offensive rider, but Congress refused to pass another bill to fund federal marshals, who were vital to the enforcement of the Enforcement Acts. The election laws remained in effect, but the funds to enforce them were curtailed for the time being.|$|E
5|$|Post-war Kentucky Democrats {{had split}} into two factionsâ€”the more {{conservative}} Bourbon Democrats and the more progressive New Departure Democrats. Stevenson governed moderately, giving concessions to both sides. He urged the immediate restoration of all rights to ex-Confederates and denounced Congress for failing to seat {{a portion of the}} Kentucky delegation because they had sided with the Confederacy. A champion of states' rights, he resisted federal measures he saw as violating the sovereignty of the states and vehemently denounced the proposed Fifteenth Amendment. Following Stevenson's lead, the General Assembly refused to pass either the Fourteenth or Fifteenth Amendment, but after their passage by a constitutional majority of the states Stevenson generally insisted that blacks' newly granted rights not be infringed upon. He was silent, however, when state legislators and officials from various cities used lengthy residency restrictions and redrawn district and municipal boundaries to exclude <b>black</b> <b>voters</b> from specific elections. His 1867 plea for legislators to call a constitutional convention to revise the state's pro-slavery constitution to better conform to post-war reality was completely ignored.|$|E
50|$|By 1904, <b>black</b> <b>voter</b> turnout {{had been}} utterly reduced in North Carolina. Contemporary {{accounts}} estimated that 75,000 black male citizens lost the vote. In 1900 blacks numbered 630,207 citizens, about 33% of the state's total population and {{were unable to}} elect representatives.|$|R
2500|$|In 1985, Sessions prosecuted three African American {{community}} organizers in the Black Belt of Alabama, including Martin Luther King Jr.'s {{former aide}} Albert Turner, for voter fraud, alleging tampering with 14 absentee ballots. The prosecution stirred charges of selective prosecution of <b>black</b> <b>voter</b> registration. The defendants, {{known as the}} Marion Three, were acquitted of all charges by a jury after three hours of deliberation. Historian Wayne Flynt told The Washington Post he regarded concerns about tactics employed in the 1984 election and by Turner in particular as legitimate, but also noted Sessions had no history of advocating for <b>black</b> <b>voter</b> rights before 1984. Interviewed in 2009, Sessions said he remained convinced that he did the right thing, but admitted he [...] "failed to make the case".|$|R
50|$|Because of the Supreme Court {{decision}} in 1915, similar grandfather clause {{provisions in the}} constitutions of Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, North Carolina, and Virginia were struck down as unconstitutional. In most of those states, legislators also quickly devised other statutory approaches to limit <b>black</b> <b>voter</b> registration and voting.|$|R
5|$|Randall's {{determination}} to cut spending, combined with Southern Democrats' desire to reduce federal power {{in their home}} states, led the House to pass an army appropriation bill with a rider that repealed the Enforcement Acts, which {{had been used to}} suppress the Ku Klux Klan. The Enforcement Acts, passed during Reconstruction over Democratic opposition, made it a crime to prevent someone from voting because of his race. Hayes was determined to preserve the law protecting <b>black</b> <b>voters,</b> and he vetoed the appropriation. The Democrats did not have enough votes to override the veto, but they passed a new bill with the same rider. Hayes vetoed this as well, and the process was repeated three times more. Finally, Hayes signed an appropriation without the rider, but Congress refused to pass another bill to fund federal marshals, who were vital to the enforcement of the Enforcement Acts. The election laws remained in effect, but the funds to enforce them were curtailed. Randall's role in the process was limited, but the Democrats' failure to force Hayes's acquiescence weakened his appeal as a potential presidential candidate in 1880.|$|E
5|$|The Greenbackers saw {{the impact}} of Civil War loyalties more acutely as they vied for Southern votes. Weaver {{embarked}} on a speaking tour of the South in July and August. Although the local Greenback parties had seen some recent success, the national party, with an ex-Republican Union general {{at the head of}} the ticket, faced more opposition. The party's courtship of <b>black</b> <b>voters,</b> too, threatened the white Democratic establishment, leading to violent outbursts at Weaver's rallies and threats against his supporters. As Weaver campaigned in the North in September and October, Republicans accused him of purposely dividing the vote to help Democrats win a plurality in marginal states. Although Weaver refused to cooperate with Democrats in running fusion slates of presidential electors, in state-level races, Greenback candidates did often combine with Democrats to defeat Republican candidates. In the September gubernatorial race in Maine, one such fusion ticket nominated Harris M. Plaisted, who narrowly defeated the incumbent Republican in what was thought to be a safe state for that party. The surprise defeat sent a shock through the Garfield campaign, and caused them to rethink their strategy of waving the bloody shirt.|$|E
5|$|Tillman believed, {{and often}} stated as senator, that blacks must submit to either white {{domination}} or extermination. He {{was reluctant to}} undertake the latter, fearing hundreds of whites would die accomplishing it. He campaigned in the violent 1898 North Carolina elections, in which white Democrats were determined to take back control from a biracial Populist-Republican coalition elected in 1894 and 1896 on a fusion ticket. He spoke widely in North Carolina {{in the fall of}} 1898, often to crowds wearing red shirts, disheartening his Populist supporters. Terror and intimidation again won the day for the Democrats, who were elected statewide. They failed to win in the coastal city of Wilmington, but white supremacists took over by force. South Carolina saw violence as well: an effort to register <b>black</b> <b>voters</b> in Phoenix led whites to provoke a confrontation, after which a number of African Americans were murdered. Tillman warned African Americans and those who might combine with them that black political activism would provoke a murderous response from whites.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Estimates {{of voter}} turnout {{indicate}} that African Americans cast ballots at unprecedented {{rates in the}} 2008 presidential election. Given {{the presence of the}} first Black major party presidential nominee, this should be no surprise. But were heightened interest, efficacy, and a sense of racial identity due to the candidacy of Barack Obama the main factors contributing to the surge in <b>Black</b> <b>voter</b> turnout? Using data from the 1984 and 1996 National Black Election Studies and the 2008 American National Election Study, which contains a stratified random over-sample of blacks, we argue that party mobilization was a critical force in boosting Black turnout. Attitudinal factors, in contrast, appear to have been less robust in this election than one would assume. Based on estimates of voter turnout in the 2008 election, the downward trend in voting since the 1960 s appears to have reversed itself. 1 Overall, voter turnout among eligible voters was estimated to be 63. 6 percent, the highest it has been since 1968 (Lopez and Taylor 2009). Contributing greatly to this boost was the highly mobilized <b>Black</b> electorate. <b>Black</b> <b>voter</b> turnout in 2008 was 65. 2 percentâ€”an all-time highâ€”with about 15. 9 million Blacks casting ballots. In fact, {{for the first time in}} history, <b>Black</b> <b>voter</b> turnout almost matched White voter turnout (66. 1 percent), even without controlling for socioeconomic status (Lopez and Taylor 2009) ...|$|R
50|$|Lamar Smith (1892 - August 13, 1955) was a U.S. {{civil rights}} figure, black farmer, World War I veteran and an {{organizer}} of <b>black</b> <b>voter</b> registration. In 1955, {{he was shot}} dead in broad daylight around 10 a.m. at close range on the lawn of the Lincoln County courthouse in Brookhaven, Mississippi.|$|R
25|$|Axelrod {{first met}} Obama in 1992, when Bettylu Saltzman, a Chicago democrat, {{introduced}} {{the two of}} them after Obama had impressed her at a <b>black</b> <b>voter</b> registration drive that he ran. Obama consulted Axelrod before he delivered a 2002 anti-war speech, and asked him to read drafts of his book, The Audacity of Hope.|$|R
25|$|Democrats {{recognized}} the black {{majority in the}} state and realized that the only way for them to win the election was through violent suppression of <b>black</b> <b>voters</b> or intimidating <b>black</b> <b>voters</b> to vote Democratic. This was a tricky problem for the party because they were known for upholding slavery and introducing the black codes. Furthermore, it angered many blacks that a former slave trader, Joe Crews, was elected as a Republican to the General Assembly.|$|E
25|$|In the 1950s {{the state}} created new {{requirements}} for a citizenship test for voter registration. Despite opposition by the States Rights Party, downstate <b>black</b> <b>voters</b> began {{to increase their}} rate of registration, which also reflected the growth of their middle classes. Gradually black voter registration and turnout increased to 20% and more, and it was 32% in 1964, when the first national civil rights legislation of the era was passed. The percentage of <b>black</b> <b>voters</b> ranged widely in the state during these years, from 93.8% in Evangeline Parish to 1.7% in Tensas Parish, for instance.|$|E
25|$|In 1946, the Supreme Court {{ruled in}} King v. Chapman that Georgia's white primary {{violated}} the rights guaranteed in the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Hamilton and Thompson organized a voter registration drive in 1946 that registered 24,137 new <b>black</b> <b>voters</b> in Atlanta.|$|E
50|$|Most significantly, in 1902 Virginia joined other Southern {{states in}} {{creating}} a new constitution that effectively disfranchised all African Americans through creating new blocks to voter registration that were selectively and subjectively applied against them. White supremacists achieved their goal: from 1900 to 1904, estimated <b>black</b> <b>voter</b> turnout in the Presidential elections in Virginia dropped to zero.|$|R
50|$|The {{party has}} {{its origins in}} the Lincoln League, which was founded by Robert Church, Jr. in 1916 to promote <b>black</b> <b>voter</b> registration. Church {{was one of the}} most {{prominent}} African-American businessmen in the nation and is credited with the early development of Beale Street. By the 1950s conservative Democrats were joining the party as blacks were leaving.|$|R
5000|$|Texas {{promptly}} {{enacted a}} new provision to continue restrictions on <b>black</b> <b>voter</b> participation, granting authority to political parties {{to determine who}} should vote in their primaries. Within four months the Executive Committee of the Democratic Party passed a resolution that [...] "all white Democrats ... and none other" [...] be allowed {{to participate in the}} approaching primary of 1927.|$|R
25|$|Following these events, the North Carolina {{legislature}} {{passed a}} new constitution with voter registration requirements for poll taxes and literacy tests that effectively disfranchised <b>black</b> <b>voters,</b> following {{the example of the}} state of Mississippi. Blacks were essentially disfranchised until after Congressional passage of the civil rights acts of the mid-1960s.|$|E
25|$|The state {{population}} in 1900 was 47% African-American: {{a total of}} 652,013 citizens. Many in New Orleans were descendants of Creoles of color, the sizeable population of free people of color before the Civil War. By 1900, {{two years after the}} new constitution, only 5,320 <b>black</b> <b>voters</b> were registered in the state. Because of disfranchisement, by 1910 there were only 730 <b>black</b> <b>voters</b> (less than 0.5 percent of eligible African-American men), despite advances in education and literacy among blacks and people of color. Blacks were excluded from the political system and also unable to serve on juries. White Democrats had established one-party Democratic rule, which they maintained in the state for decades deep into the 20th century until after Congressional passage of the 1965 Voting Rights Act provided federal oversight and enforcement of the constitutional right to vote.|$|E
25|$|Walker met Martin Luther King Jr. {{when she}} was a student at Spelman College in the early 1960s. She credits King for her {{decision}} to return to the American South as an activist in the Civil Rights Movement. She took part in the 1963 March on Washington. Later, she volunteered to register <b>black</b> <b>voters</b> in Georgia and Mississippi.|$|E
50|$|Berry {{worked with}} black ministers in Rapides Parish to {{register}} African-American citizens under the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Passage of the law, signed by U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson, {{led to a}} large increase in <b>black</b> <b>voter</b> participation in Alexandria. The former civics test covering highlights of the Constitution of the United States was dropped {{as a condition for}} registration.|$|R
40|$|Excerpt] On {{the heels}} of the Democratic victory in the 1995 Kentucky Governor 2 Ì† 7 s race, the Kentucky Republican Party filed a {{complaint}} with the stale Registry of Election Finance. The complaint alleges collusion between the Democratic Party, the Patton campaign, various unions, and the A. Philip Randolph Institute (APRI), a <b>Black</b> <b>voter</b> education group based in Louisville, Kentucky...|$|R
5000|$|Often {{politically}} active, {{he campaigned}} in 1958 to elect the Democrat, Edmund Sixtus Muskie, {{as governor of}} Maine. Merrill also {{took part in the}} Selma to Montgomery marches in 1965 to promote <b>Black</b> <b>voter</b> registration. In response to U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson's Vietnam War policy, he unsuccessfully sought nomination to the Maine legislature as an anti-war, pro-environmentalist primary candidate.|$|R
