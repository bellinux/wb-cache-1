5|$|The Army was {{nonetheless}} overruled by Hitler, {{who had a}} long-standing preference for huge, grandiose constructions. He preferred fixed installations {{along the lines of}} the virtually impregnable U-boat pens that had been built to protect Germany's U-boat fleet. In March 1943, he ordered the construction of a massive bunker (now known as the <b>Blockhaus</b> d'Éperlecques) in the Forest of Éperlecques near Watten, north of Saint-Omer. The bunker was soon spotted by Allied reconnaissance, and on 27 August 1943, a raid by 187 Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress bombers wrecked the construction site before it could be completed. A surviving portion was reused by the Germans as a LOX production facility.|$|E
5|$|No further {{military}} use {{was made}} of the bunker and the land on which it stands reverted to private ownership. It was left abandoned for many years before the owners decided to redevelop the site. In 1973, the bunker was opened to the public for the first time under the name of Le <b>Blockhaus</b> d'Éperlecques. The ownership was taken over by Hubert de Mégille in the mid-1980s and on 3 September 1986 the French state declared it a monument historique. The area around the bunker has been re-forested, though it is still heavily scarred by bomb craters, and various items of Second World War military equipment (including a V-1 on a launch ramp) are on display alongside paths around the site. An open-air trail leads to and around the bunker with interpretative signs posted at various points {{to tell the story of}} the site and the German V-weapons programme. In 2009, the museum welcomed 45,000 visitors.|$|E
5|$|Testing of the Disney bombs {{began in}} early 1945. Bombs were {{initially}} dropped on a bombing range near Southampton to photographically record their trajectory and calibrate bombsights. This was necessary as the flight-path of a rocket-accelerated bomb differed considerably {{from that of}} a free–falling bomb. Test drops were then conducted on the Watten bunker, German codename Kraftwerk Nord West (now known as the <b>Blockhaus</b> d'Éperlecques), a large German concrete bunker near Watten in northern France. This was ideal for the purpose as the area had been captured by Allied forces in September 1944, so damage to the structure could be inspected after bomb tests. Four bombs, carried by two B-17s, were used and two hits scored on the target. The resultant damage was considered satisfactory by Royal Navy observers on the ground.|$|E
25|$|Two blockhouses {{are near}} the fort, {{constructed}} in the 1930s {{as part of the}} Defensive Sector of the Ardennes: the <b>Blockhaus</b> du Fort des Ayvelles Sud, and the <b>Blockhaus</b> de Villers-Semeuse. Both were lightly armed.|$|E

500|$|After {{the second}} rest day, the peloton faced the Giro's {{shortest}} stage. It was originally scheduled {{to include the}} highest point in the 2009 Giro, but the route was changed from the published maps due {{to the amount of}} snow {{at the top of the}} <b>Blockhaus</b> mountain pass, with [...] of climbing replaced by an equivalent addition to the flat section at the beginning of the stage. The first [...] of this course were almost perfectly flat, followed by a slight increase in gradient for the next , followed by an exceptionally steep final [...]|$|E
500|$|La Coupole (...) , {{also known}} as the Coupole d'Helfaut-Wizernes and {{originally}} codenamed Bauvorhaben 21 (Building Project 21) or Schotterwerk Nordwest (Northwest Gravel Works), is a Second World War bunker complex in the Pas-de-Calais department of northern France, about [...] from Saint-Omer, and some 14.4 kilometers (8.9 miles) south-southeast from the less developed <b>Blockhaus</b> d'Eperlecques V-2 launch installation in the same area. It was built by the forces of Nazi Germany between 1943 and 1944 to serve as a launch base for V-2 rockets directed against London and southern England, and is the earliest known precursor to modern underground missile silos still in existence.|$|E
500|$|The <b>Blockhaus</b> d'Éperlecques ( [...] , also {{referred}} to as [...] "the Watten bunker" [...] or simply [...] "Watten") is a Second World War bunker, now part of a museum, near Saint-Omer in the northern Pas-de-Calais département of France, and only some 14.4 kilometers (8.9 miles) north-northwest from the more developed La Coupole V-2 launch facility, in the same general area. The bunker, built by Nazi Germany under the codename Kraftwerk Nord West (Powerplant Northwest) between March 1943 and July 1944, was originally intended to be a launching facility for the V-2 (A-4) ballistic missile. It was designed to accommodate over 100 missiles at a time and to launch up to 36 daily.|$|E
500|$|Liquigas {{tried the}} same tactic they had {{employed}} on the <b>Blockhaus,</b> when Franco Pellizotti {{took the stage}} win, as Valerio Agnoli {{was the first to}} attack and get clear of the pink jersey group. He was joined soon after not by one of his team leaders, Pellizotti or Ivan Basso, but by [...] rider Paolo Tiralongo, as the overall contenders did not respond. These two wound up being absorbed by the subsequent attack from Carlos José Ochoa, who drew Basso and Stefano Garzelli with him, as they took an appreciable lead on the pink jersey group. Carlos Sastre attacked solo from the pink jersey group next and quickly passed all other riders on the road, and stayed out front to claim his second stage win of this Giro.|$|E
500|$|Thomas Voeckler {{started the}} day's {{breakaway}} after about [...] Nine riders followed him, and their maximum advantage was just under three minutes, with the chase beginning in earnest {{very early on}} this stage due to its short length. Many of the riders in the break were unable to maintain the pace set by Voeckler {{at the foot of}} the <b>Blockhaus</b> for very long, as only Voeckler, Félix Cárdenas, and Giuseppe Palumbo were left out front as the climb began. The subsequent attacks from the pink jersey group absorbed the three of them. When Sylwester Szmyd attacked from the pink jersey group as the climb began, Franco Pellizotti followed him and was able to get clear, as Szmyd paced him to sizable gap over the pink jersey group before hitting the wall. Lance Armstrong tried to follow, but could not reach Pellizotti, as Pellizotti decided not to wait for Armstrong and chose to race the climb like a time trial. His strong, steady climb was good for the stage win. Armstrong finished the stage in the third group on the road, along with Levi Leipheimer and Carlos Sastre.|$|E

2500|$|Much of the {{destructive}} and counter-battery bombardment in the X and XXXV corps sectors had been ineffective, against defences which the Germans had improved and reinforced with more infantry.

German troops in front line dugouts that had not been mopped-up, had emerged and stopped the supporting waves in no man's land. More ground was taken, preparatory to an attack on the second objective but the offensive was suspended on 7 September, after large German counter-attacks.

2500|$|Thomas and Mikel Landa were {{appointed}} the team's joint leaders for the Giro d'Italia. At {{one point in}} the race, Thomas was sitting second in the general classification, however on the 9th stage to <b>Blockhaus</b> a fair chunk of the peloton was involved in a crash involving a stopped motorbike, which took down Thomas, Landa and most of {{the other members of the}} team. Thomas attempted a comeback after placing second in the following day's time trial, but the extent of his injuries were as such that he abandoned the race prior to stage 11. Landa continued as sole leader, taking several top-3 finishes on several mountain stages before finally winning stage 19 to Piancavallo. He went on to win the mountains classification and the super-combativity prize, also winning the Cima Coppi for being the first to cross the summit of the Stelvio Pass on stage 16.. [...] The team then participated in the inaugural Hammer Series, a three-day event pitting teams against each other in various skills competitions. [...] Impressive performances by Tao Geoghegan Hart in the climbing event and Elia Viviani in the sprint event gave the team enough points to take the overall lead. [...] In the team time trial-style Chase event, they held on by one second over Team Sunweb to win the entire competition. Froome returned to action at the Critérium du Dauphiné and finished fourth overall, just one second off the podium. Teammate Peter Kennaugh won the penultimate stage at Alpe d'Huez.|$|E
2500|$|To {{the modern}} eye, the tank is hardly {{recognizable}} as such and appears as an armoured steel box resting {{on top of}} a caterpillar tractor. [...] It has no turret, and its inconspicuous main armament is a fortification 75mm <b>Blockhaus</b> Schneider, placed in a barbette in the right front corner of the tank. [...] The right side had been chosen because the gunner had to stand {{to the left of the}} barrel to operate the gun. [...] The cannon type was developed from a 75mm trench mortar that had been adapted to fire from a fixed fortification position by adding a recoil compensator and a gun shield; in this configuration it weighed 210 kilogrammes. [...] This short-barrelled cannon had a length of just 9.5 calibres. It fired the standard French HE Model 1915 75mm shell but with a reduced propelling charge, shortening the length of the round from 350 to 241 millimetres, allowing for a muzzle velocity of only two hundred metres per second. This limited the maximum range to 2200 metres, the practical range was six hundred metres and the tank needed to close within two hundred metres of a point target to allow for precision shooting. [...] The gun has a traverse of 60°, a depression of -10° and an elevation of 30°. [...] The ammunition stock is ninety vertically stowed rounds. [...] Two 8mm Hotchkiss Model 1914 machine guns, projecting from the flanks in large hemispherical ballmounts, and resting on pintles, complement the short 75mm gun. The right machine gun is, because of the room needed for the main gun, positioned more to the rear than the left one. [...] The machine guns have a traverse of 106°, a depression of -45° and an elevation of 20°. [...] To the right of the cannon there is a bin for twenty readily accessible 75mm rounds. [...] Three other bins are positioned respectively at the extreme right rear corner (fourteen rounds), to the left of the engine (thirty-two) and at the left rear corner (twenty-four). The latter is situated to the right of a bin, at the extreme left corner, for the stock of four thousand rounds of 8mm ammunition. In 1918, in practice fifty belts with ninety-six rounds were carried, for a total of 4800 rounds.|$|E

50|$|The Maiella, {{particularly}} the <b>Blockhaus</b> peak, {{is a popular}} ride for amateur cyclists and is also sometimes used for a stage of the Giro d'Italia. The first use by the race was in 1967, when Eddy Merckx won the stage.Merckx subsequently went on to establish a cycle manufacturing company and named one of his cycles after the <b>Blockhaus.</b> Subsequent <b>Blockhaus</b> stage victors were Franco Bitossi (1968), José Manuel Fuente (1972), Moreno Argentin (1984), Ivan Basso (2006), and Franco Pellizotti (2009, subsequently disqualified).The most recent inclusion of the <b>Blockhaus</b> on the Giro d'Italia was on 14 May, 2017, when the stage was won by the Colombian rider Nairo Quintana.|$|E
