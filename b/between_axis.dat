25|$|On 11 June, the 3rd Indian Motor Brigade moved {{west from}} Buq Buq and formed three columns under the 7th Armoured Division, with the 13th Duke of Connaught's Own Lancers {{armoured}} car regiment attached. After {{the fall of}} Tobruk the brigade formed part of the rearguard operating between Sidi Rezegh and Bir el Gubi. The brigade retired {{with the rest of}} the 7th Armoured Division to Sofafi over the border in Egypt and then to Mersa Matruh. Two columns arrived safely but the PAVO column ran into a minefield and then the 90th Light Division. The column broke away only to bog in soft sand; the troops managed to dig the vehicles out overnight and then ran into yet another Axis force at close range, then drove off north-east, only to find its way blocked by minefields with gaps covered by Axis forces and was caught in crossfire. Part of the PAVO column found a way through the minefield but the rest were captured. The 13th Lancers column found themselves caught <b>between</b> <b>Axis</b> forces to the north and a minefield to the south, shot their way out to the west, then turned south-west through Axis formations, during which the armoured cars ran into an Axis column, charged, knocked out four guns and took many prisoners.|$|E

Some units retained some form of unity and managed to escape east through the New Zealand and Indian fronts. Against the German tanks, the South African infantry had no real means of defence with limited Anti-Tank capabilities, they were compelled to use 25-pounders in a direct fire role. By the time the panzers had broken into {{the rear of the}} brigade, the artillery had been subdued and all anti-tank capabilities had been destroyed. By nightfall, all that remained of 5 SA Brigade was [...] "...little groups of disconsolate prisoners.....between frequent flares and the light of burning ammunition." ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. It {{is shown}} that the slow {{glitches}} in the spin rate of the pulsar B 1822 - 09 {{can be explained by}} the reconstruction of the neutron star shape, which is not matched with the star rotation axis. Owing to the evolution of the inclination angle, i. e. the angle <b>between</b> the rotation <b>axis</b> and the axis of the magnetic dipole, under the action of the braking torque, there appears the disagreement <b>between</b> the rotation <b>axis</b> and the symmetry axis. After the angle <b>between</b> the <b>axis</b> of symmetry and the axis of the rotation achieves the maximum value of α ≃ 2 · 10 − 4 the shape of the neutron star becomes matching with the rotation axis. Such reconstruction is observed as the slow glitch. 1...|$|R

To establish XY table model that easily calculated and suitable for free-form curves, real-time contour error estimate method was adopted. In order to reduce uncertainty external disturbance and dynamic matching <b>between</b> X <b>axis</b> and Y axis, the iterative learning cross-coupled controller (ILCCC) was designed for current compensation on X axis and Y axis. Simulation results show that the control scheme can enhance the robustness of the system, and effectively improve the XY table of contour precision...|$|R
