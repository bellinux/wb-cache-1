40|$|The {{increasing}} {{volumes of}} road transportation contribute to congestion on road, {{which leads to}} delays and other negative impacts on the reliability of transportation. Moreover, transportation {{is one of the}} main contributors to the growth of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions, where the impact of road transportation is significant. Therefore, governmental organizations and private commercial companies are looking for greener transportation solutions to eliminate the negative externalities of road transportation. In this paper, we present a novel solution framework to support the operational-level decisions for intermodal transportation networks using a combination of an optimization model and simulation. The simulation model includes stochastic elements in form of uncertain travel times, whereas the optimization model represents a deterministic and linear multi-commodity service network design formulation. The intermodal transportation plan can be optimized according to different objectives, including costs, time and CO 2 e emissions. The proposed approach is successfully implemented to real-life scenarios where differences in transportation plans for alternative objectives are presented. The solutions for transportation networks with up to 250 services and 20 orders show that the approach is capable of <b>delivering</b> <b>reliable</b> <b>solutions</b> and identifying possible disruptions and alternatives for adapting the unreliable transportation plans...|$|R

As a 130 megawatt (MW) power plant generated by steam and gas (PLTGU), it strengthens Bekasi - Karawang electricity system through Cibatu substation owned by PT Perusahaan Listrik Negara (PLN).

40|$|Micro Electro Mechanical System (MEMS) -based {{inertial}} sensors {{have made}} possible {{the development of a}} civilian land vehicle navigation system by offering a low-cost solution. However, the accurate modeling of the MEMS sensor errors {{is one of the most}} challenging tasks in the design of low-cost navigation systems. These sensors exhibit significant errors like biases, drift, noises; which are negligible for higher grade units. Different conventional techniques utilizing the Gauss Markov model and neural network method have been previously utilized to model the errors. However, Gauss Markov model works unsatisfactorily in the case of MEMS units due to the presence of high inherent sensor errors. On the other hand, modeling the random drift utilizing Neural Network (NN) is time consuming, thereby affecting its real-time implementation. We overcome these existing drawbacks by developing an enhanced Support Vector Machine (SVM) based error model. Unlike NN, SVMs do not suffer from local minimisation or over-fitting problems and <b>delivers</b> a <b>reliable</b> global <b>solution.</b> Experimental results proved that the proposed SVM approach reduced the noise standard deviation by 10 – 35 % for gyroscopes and 61 – 76 % for accelerometers.

40|$|Shale gas {{involves}} a technology {{which is a}} controversial method of energy production mainly because there are uncertainties about the possible environmental and human health impacts. The article aims to identify the level of knowledge {{in relation to the}} impact of environmental risks attached to shale gas exploitation in the academic and scientifi c community. It does so by employing the expert elicitation approach which has the benefi t of quantifying the judgment of individual experts. We have revealed a consistency among researchers in assessing the level of uncertainty of the main environmental risks and a preferred policy option in dealing with uncertainty, a vow for improved transparency, openness and ease of access to information. Shale gas policy-making in Europe needs a science- based approach as science informs policy <b>by</b> <b>delivering</b> objective and <b>reliable</b> knowledge. The article concludes that developing a comprehensive approach based on scientifi c data and an appropriate regulatory framework will provide a path forward for the future development of contested policies like shale gas. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{technical}} breakthroughs {{of multiple}} detectors developed by Daya Bay and RENO collaborations have gotten great attention. Yet the optimal determination of neutrino mixing parameters from reactor data {{depends on the}} statistical method and demands equal attention. We find that a straightforward method using a minimal parameters will generally outperform a multi-parameter method <b>by</b> <b>delivering</b> more <b>reliable</b> values with sharper resolution. We review standard confidence levels and statistical penalties for models using extra parameters, and apply those rules to our analysis. We find that the methods used in recent work of the Daya Bay and RENO collaborations have several undesirable properties. The existing work also uses non-standard measures of significance which {{we are unable to}} explain. A central element of the current methods consists of variationally fitting many more parameters than data points. As a result the experimental resolution of sin ^ 2 (2 θ _ 13) is degraded. The results also become extremely sensitive to certain model parameters that can be adjusted arbitrarily. The number of parameters to include in evaluating significance is an important issue that has generally been overlooked. The measures of significance applied previously would be consistent if and only if all parameters but one were considered to have no physical relevance for the experiment's hypothesis test. Simpler, more transparent methods can improve the determination of the mixing angle θ _ 13 from reactor data, and exploit the advantages from superb hardware technique of the experiments. We anticipate that future experimental analysis will fully exploit those advantages. Comment: New text, new figure and new references revise the thrust of the paper to improve determination of the mixing angle. New title reflects this improvemen...|$|R
