Romero Barceló {{admitted}} in a public radio interview that it was “an error of judgment” and “a premature declaration” to laud the police officers, since at that time he <b>believed</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> {{telling the truth about}} their self-defense. However, he has publicly denied any wrongdoing regarding the alleged cover-up during the first investigations.|$|E
5|$|From the {{earliest}} times, the Chinese {{were concerned with}} the destructive force of earthquakes. It was recorded in Sima Qian's Records of the Grand Historian of 91BC that in 780BC an earthquake had been powerful enough to divert the courses of three rivers. It was not known {{at the time that}} earthquakes were caused by the shifting of tectonic plates in the Earth's crust; instead, the people of the ancient Zhou Dynasty explained them as disturbances with cosmic yin and yang, along with the heavens' displeasure with acts committed (or the common peoples' grievances ignored) by the current ruling dynasty. These theories were ultimately derived from the ancient text of the Yijing (Book of Changes), in its fifty-first hexagram. There were other early theories about earthquakes, developed by those such as the ancient Greeks. Anaxagoras (c.500–428BC) believed that they were caused by excess water near the surface crust of the earth bursting into the Earth's hollows; Democritus (c. 460–370BC) believed that the saturation of the Earth with water caused them; Anaximenes (c.585–c.525BC) <b>believed</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> the result of massive pieces of the Earth falling into the cavernous hollows due to drying; and Aristotle (384–322BC) <b>believed</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> caused by instability of vapor (pneuma) caused by the drying of the moist Earth by the Sun's rays.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, {{students}} from the Art Institute of Portland used stencils to advertise a concert for the Oregon Food Bank. The students <b>believed</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> using spray chalk, but after completion, they learned they were actually using spray paint. The students were told that even temporary markings count as graffiti, and the students offered to remove the paint and apologize to businesses affected. Criminal charges were not filed.|$|E

5|$|On {{the morning}} of July 1, Union cavalry in the {{division}} of Brig. Gen. John Buford were awaiting the approach of Confederate infantry forces {{from the direction of}} Cashtown, to the northwest. Confederate forces from the brigade of Brig. Gen. J. Johnston Pettigrew had briefly clashed with Union forces the day before but <b>believed</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> Pennsylvania militia of little consequence, not the regular army cavalry that was screening the approach of the Army of the Potomac.|$|E
5|$|The {{rejection}} of their protest greatly upset the German forces, because they <b>believed</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> treated unjustly in the war. Shortly after the protest was rejected, Germany issued threats {{that they would}} punish all captured American soldiers that {{were found to be}} armed with a shotgun. This led to the United States issuing a retaliation threat, stating that any measures unjustly taken against captured American soldiers would lead to an equal act by the United States on captured German soldiers.|$|E
5|$|A {{crowd of}} several {{thousand}} gathered outside the courthouse while Lockett's trial was underway. A cameraman asked {{a large group of}} those gathered to shake their fists and yell so he could get a picture. The rest of the crowd mistakenly <b>believed</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> storming the courthouse and rushed forward. In the ensuing skirmish, one policeman was injured so badly that his arm later had to be amputated. The National Guard opened fire, killing six people and wounding approximately fifty. Some members of the mob looted nearby stores in search of weapons to retaliate, but reinforcements arrived from a nearby army post by mid-afternoon. Martial law was declared, and no further violence was perpetrated. A month later, Lockett was executed at the Kentucky State Penitentiary in Eddyville.|$|E

5|$|A few teams {{expressed}} interest in St. Louis. He chose to sign with the Tampa Bay Lightning as he <b>believed</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> {{the most likely to}} give him playing time in the NHL. He made his debut with the team on October 6, 2000. He struggled at first, failing to score a goal in the first six weeks of the season and again found himself out of the lineup at times. Realizing that he was at a career crossroads, St. Louis abandoned the changes to his game that his NHL coaches had impressed on him, trusting his own instincts. He scored his first goal of the season in late November, and finished the season with 18 goals and 40 points – 34 of which came after December 1.|$|E
5|$|Bedsitcom {{documented}} {{the lives of}} six young adults living in a loft flat in London. Eight episodes in total were created, which {{were divided into two}} distinct halves. The first four episodes centred on the lives of Mel, Paul and Rufus, the three actors, as they lived in the flat with Bob, Dave and Shirine, the three unaware members of the public who <b>believed</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> taking part in a genuine reality TV show. After Bob, Dave and Shirine had learnt {{the true nature of the}} show at the end of episode four, they moved out and were replaced by three new members of the public named Barrington, David and Jessica. These three new cast members remained on Bedsitcom for the final four episodes.|$|E
5|$|During 1548, England {{was subject}} to social unrest. After April 1549, a series of armed revolts broke out, fuelled by various {{religious}} and agrarian grievances. The two most serious rebellions, which required major military intervention to put down, were in Devon and Cornwall and in Norfolk. The first, sometimes called the Prayer Book Rebellion, arose from the imposition of Protestantism, and the second, led by a tradesman called Robert Kett, mainly from the encroachment of landlords on common grazing ground. A complex aspect of the social unrest was that the protesters <b>believed</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> acting legitimately against enclosing landlords with the Protector's support, convinced that the landlords were the lawbreakers.|$|E

5|$|Humans {{have known}} about the heart since ancient times, {{although}} its precise function and anatomy were not clearly understood. From the primarily religious views of earlier societies towards the heart, ancient Greeks are considered {{to have been the}} primary seat of scientific understanding of the heart in the ancient world. Aristotle considered the heart to be organ responsible for creating blood; Plato considered the heart as the source of circulating blood and Hippocrates noted blood circulating cyclically from the body through the heart to the lungs. Erasistratos (304–250 BCE) noted the heart as a pump, causing dilation of blood vessels, and noted that arteries and veins both radiate from the heart, becoming progressively smaller with distance, although he <b>believed</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> filled with air and not blood. He also discovered the heart valves.|$|E
5|$|In April 1952 Sihanouk married Paule Monique Izzi, the {{daughter}} of Pomme Peanga Cambodian lady, and Jean-François Izzi, a French banker of Italian ancestry. Monique became Sihanouk's lifelong partner, and in the 1990s she changed her name to Monineath. Before his marriage to Monique, Sihanouk had married five other women including Phat Kanhol, Sisowath Pongsanmoni, Sisowath Monikessan, Mam Manivan Phanivong, and Thavet Norleak. Monikessan died of childbirth in 1946, and his marriages to the other women all ended in divorce. Sihanouk sired fourteen children with five different wives except for Thavet Norleak, who bore him no children. During the Khmer Rouge years, five children and fourteen grandchildren disappeared; Sihanouk <b>believed</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> killed by the Khmer Rouge.|$|E
5|$|Many Muslims {{considered}} this unexpected victory a proof {{that they had}} been favored by God and <b>believed</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> assured such victories in the future. A number of the leading tribesmen of Quraysh had been killed at Badr and so leadership passed to Abu Sufyan. He forbade the mourning of the losses at Badr, for he was eager to exact revenge upon Muhammad, vowing to conduct a retaliatory raid on the city of Medina. Several months later, Abu Sufyan accompanied a party of 200 men to the city, obtaining temporary residence with the chief of the Jewish tribe Banu Nadir and learning more of the current situation in Medina. He and his party then left Medina, burning down two houses and laying waste to some fields in fulfillment of his vow. Further skirmishes between the Meccans and the Muslims would occur thereafter.|$|E

5|$|On 4/5 May the Luftwaffe hit Exeter severely. That night MacLachlan claimed {{destroyed}} two He 111s of Küstenfliegergruppe 506. He trailed the German bombers back to France {{and attacked}} {{them where they}} <b>believed</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> safe. In fact both of his victims were Ju 88s which crashed near Dinard. From Feldwebel Robert Bogel's Wrk Nr. 1528, only the gunner was able to bail out, while observer Leutnant zur See (naval rank) Roman Wallner and Obergefreiter Johan Beibl were killed. There was only one survivor from Unteroffizier Josef Palmer's Ju 88D-4 Wrk Nr. 1154; Unteroffizier Karl Schorn managed to bail out but Leutnant zur See Ernst Tramp and Richard Staub were killed.|$|E
5|$|On October 10, as the {{precursor}} extratropical storm was forming, the Bermuda Weather Service issued a gale {{and later a}} storm warning for the island, expecting winds of 50 to 60mph (60 to 95km/h). Several radio interviews and television stations issued information on the expected storm. Many residents <b>believed</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> insufficiently warned, though it is acknowledged that emergency managers and citizens pay less attention to gale warnings then they do for tropical cyclone warnings. On October 12, as the storm was passing {{to the south of}} the island, officials closed all schools and government offices. Many private businesses closed as well.|$|E
5|$|Planning for the {{demobilisation}} of the Australian military {{began at}} the end of 1942 when the Department of Post-War Reconstruction was formed. The department was involved with drawing up plans for determining veterans' entitlements and the assistance which would be provided to discharged personnel to help them settle into civilian life. This included planning the delivery of training, housing and ensuring that jobs were available. An important consideration was to ensure that civilian employment opportunities were created at an appropriate rate as the size of the military was reduced. In order to achieve this, it was decided to continue many wartime economic regulations such as price controls in order to limit inflation and direct resources to where the Australian Government <b>believed</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> most needed.|$|E

5|$|Preparations for the {{disposal}} of equipment began {{in the second half}} of 1944 when the War Cabinet directed the military to survey all stocks and indicate any surpluses. General Thomas Blamey, the Commander-in-Chief of the Army, hindered these preparations as he <b>believed</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> premature and that the Army's stocks needed to be maintained until Japan was defeated. This position was opposed by the acting Minister for the Army, and the RAAF and RAN made some attempts to identify their surpluses, but was successful in delaying the Disposal Commission's work until July 1945. As a result, relatively little military equipment was sold between September 1944 and June 1945.|$|E
5|$|Protected against double jeopardy, Bryant and Milam {{struck a}} deal with Look {{magazine}} in 1956 to tell their story to journalist William Bradford Huie for between $3,600 and $4,000. The interview took place in the law firm of the attorneys who had defended Bryant and Milam. Huie did not ask the questions; Bryant and Milam's own attorneys did. Neither attorney had heard their clients' accounts of the murder before. According to Huie, the older Milam was more articulate and sure of himself than the younger Bryant. Milam admitted to shooting Till and neither of them <b>believed</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> guilty or that they had done anything wrong.|$|E
5|$|At {{the drivers}} meeting held the Friday before the event, the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) Race Director Charlie Whiting {{announced}} that any potential blocking manoeuvres that {{interfered with the}} World Championship battle {{would result in a}} driver being shown a waved black and white flag, before giving a black flag to signal disqualification from the race. The penalty also had a potential ban for up to three Formula One World Championship events for any driver found to have breached the new ruling. Ralf Schumacher agreed with the penalties. However, McLaren team principal Ron Dennis was more vocal in opposing the new rules as he <b>believed</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> arbitrary and were against choosing team tactics. He was also unhappy with the inclusion of Italian lawyer Roberto Causo as a race steward because Dennis held the view that any decision would be biased towards Ferrari.|$|E
