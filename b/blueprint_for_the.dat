5|$|Fisher {{was part}} of this same working group which {{recommended}} that an internal NSC study be conducted on the overall U.S. foreign policy as it pertained to the newly developing Cold War. This classified study (declassified in 1977) called NSC-68, was the <b>blueprint</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Truman Doctrine for containment of communism, which provided the overall policy concepts for the U.S. participation in the Cold War throughout the 1950s.|$|E
5|$|Music {{journalist}} Stephen Davis {{claims the}} influences of the style {{can be traced back}} to acts like Aerosmith, Kiss, Boston, Cheap Trick, and The New York Dolls. Kiss and to a lesser extent Alice Cooper, were major influences on the genre. Finnish band Hanoi Rocks, heavily influenced themselves by the New York Dolls, have been credited with setting a <b>blueprint</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> look of hair metal.|$|E
5|$|In 1934, Nakayama {{commissioned}} the famed architect Yoshikazu Uchida {{to draw up}} a <b>blueprint</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> area. Uchida arranged ten buildings around Oyasama's Residence. A 50-meter boulevard would come out of the Residence on a north-south axis, along which six school buildings would be lined up. Classrooms and large auditoriums would be built {{at the end of this}} boulevard. The international school and library were to be eventually integrated into this plan. In January 1937, a middle school (now Tenri High School) was built according to Uchida's plan, but as Japan mobilized for the Pacific War the plan had to be temporarily shelved.|$|E

5|$|In 1890 Manson was {{replaced}} as locomotive superintendent by James Johnson, {{the son of}} Samuel W. Johnson, then locomotive superintendent at the Midland Railway. In 1893 Neilsons delivered six new 4-4-0 tender locomotives that were more powerful any previous Great North locomotive and the first not to have Clark's smoke prevention apparatus. Classified as Class S and known for rapid acceleration and sustained high speed, these were the <b>blueprint</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> later Great North tender locomotives. Manson had left a design for a 0-4-4 tank locomotive and Johnson changed the firebox, boiler and value gear so {{they were the same}} as the Class S tender locomotives before ordering nine to work the Deeside Line. These arrived in 1893 and most were transferred to the Aberdeen suburban services in 1900.|$|E
5|$|The Treaty on Increased Integration in the Economic and Humanitarian Fields {{signed in}} 1996 laid the first {{foundation}} for economic convergence. The treaty ensured {{the creation of}} a permanent executive organ to oversee integration of states that later would be part of the EEU. It served as the <b>blueprint</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> future common market for goods, services, capital and labour. The Single Economic Space established a single market across the territory of Belarus, Russia and Kazakhstan. In 2015 with the entry into force of the EEU Agreement, the single market was expanded to include Armenia and Kyrgyzstan. The countries represent a market of some 183 million people and a combined GDP of around $4 trillion.|$|E

25|$|The {{commission}} {{concluded that}} the bridge's engineer, Micha Bar-Ilan, did not submit a <b>blueprint</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> bridge, designed a bridge that was inadequate for its intended use, and did not properly supervise or coordinate the bridge's construction. The commission faulted the Maccabiah Games' organizers for poor coordination and oversight over the bridge's assembly.|$|E
25|$|The Young Turks {{and other}} Ottoman intellectuals asked the {{question}} of the position of the empire regarding the West (primarily taken to mean Christian Europe).

25|$|Melbourne’s {{grid plan}} was {{considered}} dull and monotonous by some people, {{and so the}} architect William Campbell designed a <b>blueprint</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> city.

25|$|DCI Smith {{demonstrated}} {{the type of}} leadership the Dulles Report required of that position. Perhaps Smith's greatest contribution to the Intelligence Community as DCI was that he used his latent authority to lead the intelligence establishment rather than go along with what other agencies had been doing.

And the plan took on a political life of its own, since it offered the opportunity for value-added products to be manufactured in Alberta for export.
