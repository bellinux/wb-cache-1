40|$|About {{four years}} ago, work was {{completed}} on a 36 inch diameter gas to gas carbon ring seal used to buffer low pressure turbine {{air at the}} rim of the forward outer flowpath on the GE 36 unducted fan (UDF) engine. At about the same time, we were developing a long life counter-rotating intershaft air-oil seal of approximately 7. 6 inch diameter for operation at 800 fps, 800 F, and 50 psid. Although we were successful in meeting most program goals with a split ring seal of the axial bushing type, the seal with the greatest payoff in life and air leakage rates, bearing many features in common with the GE 36 seal, could not be successfully tested because of the structural weakness of the primary seal ring carbon material. This was a split ring seal using a hybrid combination of orifice compensated hydrostatic and shrouded hydrodynamic gas bearings. We are presently working to develop this design in conjunction with high strength materials being developed by Pure Carbon Co. In the area of engine secondary gas flow path-sealing for performance improvement, we are currently working with carbon and all metal face seals. A 15 inch diameter all metal 'aspirating' face seal, using self-acting hydrostatic bearings, was successfully tested to 700 fps, 100 psid, and 1000 F, demonstrating long life at flow reduction of 86 percent compared to a 'best' labyrinth. This seal will be developed through 1400 F, 900 fps, and 350 psid. The seal 'aspirates' closed at about idle speed pressure during engine start and reopens at engine shutdown. A hydraulic thrust <b>balance</b> <b>seal,</b> currently using orifice compensated hydrostatics, is under development. Other aspects of these projects are briefly covered...|$|E

In this study, forces on the seal are reviewed to define <b>seal</b> <b>balance</b> ratio and pressure gradient factor.

40|$|The {{design of}} the gas seals used in {{centrifugal}} compressors and axial turbines requires to consider not only their aptitude to reduce leakage, but also their contribution to the overall dynamics of the machine. Honeycomb and hole pattern annular seals are often employed in compressors for the end <b>balance</b> piston <b>seal</b> or as the central <b>balance</b> piston <b>seal</b> in a back-to-back arrangement. In contrast to labyrinth seals, they show a beneficial damping effect. In order to obtain an effective tool for predicting the leakage and the dynamic response of honeycomb seals, a bulk flow model has been devised in the past and, implemented in numerical codes, it is presently used in the design process. This kind of codes, however, require simplifying assumptions: in particular, one reference code available to the authors adopts the hypothesis of isothermal process. As the required level of confidence in seal design is increasing, an experimental validation and possibly some refinement are needed. In this work, the bulk flow model was reviewed and the sensitivity to different hypotheses was explored.

A systematic program was undertaken to identify the problem and correct it. A {{detailed analysis of the}} floating ring annular oil <b>seals,</b> <b>balance</b> piston labyrinth <b>seals</b> and impeller aerodynamic cross coupling was conducted.

40|$|LecturePg. 9 - 20 This paper {{discusses}} the rotordynamic instability problems experienced with two separate centrifugal compressors. While {{the root causes}} of the instabilities are very different, the analysis methodology of reconciling the rotordynamic model with measured vibration data was the same. The first problem occurred with a propylene compressor in a Gulf Coast chemical plant that had experienced high journal bearing temperatures for several years. A modified bearing was installed to alleviate the temperature problem; however, a large subsynchronous vibration appeared after the new bearings were installed. A lateral stability analysis shows that the compressor with the modified bearings was very stable with the aerodynamic destabilizing effect predicted by the Alford and/or Wachel equation. A comparison analysis was made of the stability predicted with the original bearings (which were stable) as well as the modified bearings (which were not). This allowed the user to determine the magnitude of the destabilizing forces present in the compressor and design a new bearing that was both stable and would operate at an acceptable temperature. The new bearing was installed and the compressor has operated without the subsynchronous vibration for {{the past year and a}} half. The second problem occurred with a very similar ethylene compressor in a Midwest ethylene plant. The compressor had operated for over two years after an overhaul with low vibration. Then a subsynchronous vibration appeared that was very erratic, but was slowly increasing in amplitude over time. To solve the problem, a rotordynamic analysis was performed that suggested that replacing the bearing would solve the stability problem However, comparison between the measure field vibration and the rotordynamic model did not agree on all points. A more indepth look at the compressor revealed that the increase in subsynchronous vibration was tracking very closely with the balance line differential pressure. This fact, along with the characteristics of the <b>balance</b> piston <b>seal,</b> suggested that a bearing change alone may not completely address the problem A new <b>balance</b> piston <b>seal</b> was designed to reduce its destabilizing effects on the rotor. The compressor was inspected during the next scheduled downtime to determine the cause of the high vibration and install the new <b>balance</b> piston <b>seal</b> and bearings. Examination of the internals revealed a large seal rub in the compressor, but at the dry gas <b>seals,</b> not the <b>balance</b> piston. The rub was addressed and the subsynchronous vibration was eliminated. While the exact source of the destabilizing force was not correctly ?guessed? before disassembly, the indepth rotordynamic analysis did reveal that there was a large destabilizing force in the compressor, and a bearing change alone would not eliminate the vibration. The compressor has been operating without the subsynchronous problem for the past year since the modification...|$|R

Charles Lamb, for example, came to the old English dramatists with the feeling of a discoverer. He brought with him an alert curiosity, and everything was delightful simply because it was strange. Like other early adventurers, he sometimes mistook shining sand for gold; but he had the great advantage of not feeling himself responsible for the manners of the inhabitants he found there, and not thinking it needful to make them square with any Westminster Catechism of aesthetics. Best of all, he did not feel compelled to compare them with the Greeks, about whom he knew little, and cared less. He took them as he found them, described them in a few pregnant sentences, and displayed his specimens of their growth, and manufacture.

Edge welded metal bellows (EWMB) are an elegant way to manufacture bellows structures out of simple doughnut-like shape disks.

However, there are side effects for using welded bellows that have tormented bellows design engineers and prevented the improvements in the performance and reliability of edge welded metal bellows. ^ The first {{problem is that the}} force-deflection response of welded metal bellows is unpredictable when it is subjected to combined stroke and pressure loading. This information is especially important for the welded metal bellows used in mechanical face seals. The sudden reaction force increase associated with the higher operating pressure (also known as the effective diameter shift problem) will usually destroy a <b>balanced</b> <b>seal</b> design. This study has developed an analytical procedure and demonstrated that the finite element method can be used to solve the mystery of effective diameter shift. ^ The second problem is that the fatigue life prediction of welded metal bellows is difficult caused by its built-in crack-like geometry which creates stress risers in the structures and singularities in the mathematical models. This study first developed a crack propagation model using the fracture mechanics approach to predict the fatigue life and demonstrated that the fatigue life of welded metal bellows associated with crack propagation is {{only a small portion of}} the total life. ^ The model was then modified to include the life associated with crack initiation by using the local stress-strain approach. The local strain has been calculated using finite element procedure, and the calculated local strains were translated to cycle life using Coffin-Manson equation. The complete procedure has been used to analyze a 316 L stainless steel welded bellows and shown good correlation with test data.
