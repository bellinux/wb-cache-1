5|$|The {{history of}} the highway system in Michigan dates <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> Native American trails that crossed the state. These trails were {{pathways}} no wider than approximately , permitting single-file traffic. Many of the modern highways in the state follow the path of these old trails, including the Great Trail from Fort Pitt to Fort Detroit which is now US24 from Detroit to Toledo, Ohio. This trail connected with Braddock's Road {{which led to the}} Atlantic Coast.|$|E

5|$|The {{station was}} first {{proposed}} in the 1980s, although no progress was made until August 2001, when the transportation officials said the official station could be constructed within several years. After several years of proposals, along {{with the passing of}} a high opposer in 2003, the station came up once again in 2008. That year, the proposed Metropark South was brought <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> Bridge council by developer Michael Alfieri. His proposal also brought up the plans for new residential homes, commercial businesses along with the new station. The proposal was conditionally accepted in November of that year. As of 2009, there is no forward on the actual station being constructed.|$|E

5|$|The {{superior}} {{performance of}} the Lexington and Enterprise squadrons that were still equipped with the old SBD compared with those equipped with the new Curtiss SB2C Helldiver caused great concern, and serious consideration was given to going <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> aircraft. For this tour of duty, {{in addition to the}} Navy Cross, Ramage was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross twice and the Air Medal six times. In September 1944, Ramage received his last wartime assignment, as commanding officer of Bombing Squadron Ninety Eight VB-98, a California-based training unit. He remained with VB-98 until July 1946.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} 1957, US131 {{had been}} realigned as an {{expressway}} from the Three Rivers bypass to Moorepark. The section of freeway in the Grand Rapids area opened near the southern county line north to 28th Street. This latter freeway segment was extended further south to Wayland {{by the middle of}} 1958. By the middle of 1960, the freeway was extended to M-118 in Martin, where traffic used M-118 to connect <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> routing. The southern end of US131 was moved to another location on the state line. Instead of running concurrently with US112 between White Pigeon and Mottville, US131 ran directly south of White Pigeon to the state line. In the process, the M-103 designation was swapped with US131.|$|E
5|$|Other {{types of}} {{religious}} texts give {{evidence for the}} myth, such as two Middle Kingdom texts: the Dramatic Ramesseum Papyrus and the Ikhernofret Stela. The papyrus describes the coronation of Senusret I, whereas the stela alludes to events in the annual festival of Khoiak. Rituals in both these festivals reenacted elements of the Osiris myth. The most complete ancient Egyptian account of the myth is the Great Hymn to Osiris, an inscription from the Eighteenth Dynasty (c. 1550–1292 BCE) that gives the general outline of the entire story but includes little detail. Another important source is the Memphite Theology, a religious narrative that includes an account of Osiris's death {{as well as the}} resolution of the dispute between Horus and Set. This narrative associates the kingship that Osiris and Horus represent with Ptah, the creator deity of Memphis. The text was long thought to date <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> Kingdom (c. 2686–2181 BCE) and was treated as a source for information about the early stages {{in the development of the}} myth. Since the 1970s, however, Egyptologists have concluded that the text dates to the New Kingdom at the earliest.|$|E

50|$|As noted, {{the team}} has used Bob Jenkins' franchises as sponsors, {{offering}} a distinctive look to many of their cars. In 2006, the team began using an old-styled font for its car numbers, modeled after the styles used by teams of the 1960s and 1970s. However, the team dropped this style for a more standard rounded block font in 2008. Midway through the year, the Cup cars switched <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>older</b> styled numbers, while the Nationwide Series car used the newer font {{through the end of}} the year (the retro font was used on the team's road course car). In 2009, the Nationwide car also switched <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>older</b> styled numbers. FRM has used the retro style ever since.|$|R
