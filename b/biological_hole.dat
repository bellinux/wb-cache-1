50|$|Permanent and {{temporary}} cavitation cause very different <b>biological</b> effects. A <b>hole</b> {{through the heart}} will cause loss of pumping efficiency, loss of blood, and eventual cardiac arrest. A hole through the liver or lung will be similar, with the lung shot having the added effect of reducing blood oxygenation; these effects however are generally slower to arise than damage to the heart. A hole through the brain can cause instant unconsciousness and will likely kill the recipient. A hole through the spinal cord will instantly interrupt the nerve signals to and from some or all extremities, disabling the target {{and in many cases}} also resulting in death (as the nerve signals to and from the heart and lungs are interrupted by a shot high in the chest or to the neck). By contrast, a hole through an arm or leg which hits only muscle will cause a great deal of pain but is unlikely to be fatal, unless one of the large blood vessels (femoral or brachial arteries, for example) is also severed in the process.|$|R

40|$|The genesis and {{the early}} history of the Woods Hole Laboratory (WHL), to a lesser extent the Marine Biological Laboratory (MBL), and to some degree the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI), were elegantly covered by Paul S.

I will only briefly touch on that portion of the Laboratory's history covered by Galtsoff. Woods Hole, as a center of marine science, was conceived and implemented largely by one man, Spencer Fullerton Baird, at that time Assistant Secretary of the Smithsonian and who was also instrumental in the establishment of the National Museum and Permanent Secretary of the newly established American Association for the Advancement of Science. He was appointed by President Ulysses S. Grant in 1871 as the first U. S. Commissioner of Fisheries.

40|$|TypescriptM. A. University of Missouri 1912 In {{connection}} with the extensive investigation of the Unionidae which has been conducted by the Bureau of Fisheries {{for the past four}} years, with a view to determining the feasibility of artificial propagation of the mussel on a commercial basis, it was thought worthwhile by the writer to make a careful study of the marsupium {{of a large number of}} genera, including as many as possible of the distinctive types, as classified by Simpson in his "Synopsis of the Naiadesu". The method of this investigation has been to study material taken at various intervals, beginning with the marsupium in a pre-gravid condition, arid progressing through the various stages of gravidity to the post-gravid condition. In this manner, it has been found possible to determine just what histological changes occur in the epithelial lining of the water tubes, which, as has long been well known, function as marsupial pouches for the embryos until the latter are discharged as glochidia.

40|$|Agents {{that affect}} nerve excitability may be classed in two large groups {{according}} to their mode of action: those which block excitability by depolarizing the membrane, and those which cause little or no change in membrane potential but alter excitability {{by virtue of their}} ability to affect the mechanisms whereby the nerve membrane con-ductances are increased upon stimulation. Because of their possible specific affinity for the nerve membrane channels through which ions flow during excitation, the latter group of neuroactive agents is of particular interest from the electrophysiological point of view. The present paper is concerned with studies of the manner in which various types of neuroactive agents affect excitability through interactions with the membrane con-ductances, and an attempt is also made to characterize the properties of ionic channels of the nerve membrane by use of these agents.

40|$|Purpose: This poster {{focuses on}} the methods, tools and {{outcomes}} involved in creating two targeted research networks to support large, long-running research programs in the Woods Hole scientific community. Participants: These efforts are managed by librarians from the Marine <b>Biological</b> Laboratory/Woods <b>Hole</b> Oceanographic Institution (MBLWHOI) Library in collaboration with administrators and researchers from two programs: The Whitman Center for Research and Discovery at the Marine Biological Laboratory and the National Ocean Sciences Accelerator Mass Spectrometry Facility (NOSAMS) at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. Description: In 2008, the MBLWHOI Library launched Connected Village ([URL] a research networking and discovery service for the Woods Hole Science Community 1. The community has begun to recognize the Library as experts in promoting up-to-date information about researchers and research activities in Woods Hole. This year, NOSAMS and The Whitman Center have upcoming 10 -year reviews from their respective funding agencies and governing boards. The ability to provide analytics regarding publication output, and demonstrate networking and outreach efforts {{is critical to the}} success of each review. This poster describes the planning, technical implementation, data gathering, deliverables, ongoing support and future directions of the Whitman ([URL] and NOSAMS ([URL] research network tools. Results/Outcome: Whitman Center – 611 researcher profiles created, 2064 published works harvested. NOSAMS – 1030 research profiles created, 1899 published works harvested. Administrators now have the ability to quantify and visualize the research output and impact of their programs. The researchers, who are from institutions all over the globe, now have the ability to discover potential collaborators in their field and get a much better sense of the collective scientific trends and contributions of their affiliated program. The Library is working with each program to develop workflows to systematically harvest new publications and maintain contact with their researchers on a continuous basis. Ongoing development includes refining our process for automated deposits of full-text and supporting data for publications into our Institutional Repository, the Woods Hole Open Access Server. 1 Connected Village runs on the open source software Bibapp ([URL] developed by the University of Wisconsin and the University of Illinois...|$|R
40|$|The {{simplicity}} of maritime Antarctic terrestrial ecosystems, combined with rapid changes in several environmental variables, creates a natural laboratory probably unparalleled worldwide {{in which to}} study biological consequences of climate change. The Antarctic Peninsula and Scotia Arc provide a gradient from oceanic cool temperate to frigid continental desert conditions, giving a natural model of climate change predictions. Biota are limited by the twin environmental factors of low temperature and lack of water, while also facing changes in the timing of UV-B maxima, associated with the spring ozone <b>hole.</b> <b>Biological</b> changes consistent with predictions from climate amelioration are visible {{in the form of}} expansions in range and local population numbers amongst elements of the flora. Field manipulations demonstrate (i) potential for massive species and community responses to climate amelioration, (ii) the importance of existing soil propagule banks, and (iii) biochemical responses to changing radiation environments. Antarctic species possess considerable resistance/resilience and response flexibility to a range of environmental stresses. Wide environmental variability in Antarctic terrestrial habitats also means that predicted levels of change often fall well within the range already experienced. Thus, climate amelioration may generate positive responses from resident biota, at least while they remain protected through isolation from colonization by more effective competitors. Responses are likely to be subtle and multifactorial in origin, arising from changes in resource allocation and energy economics. The integration of subtle responses may lead to greater consequential impacts in communities and ecosystems...|$|R

Since the number of eggs spawned far exceeds the number of 0 -group cod, there must be an enormous mortality during the first half year. The aim of the present project is to test Hjort's hypothesis and to increase out knowledge about the growth and survival of cod larvae. The main area of investigation is Vestfjorden in northwestern Norway. Several aspects of the larvae were examined, such as standard length, functional jaw, yolk sac stages, development of swim-bladder, gut content, etc. The results of bioassay experiments showed that first feeding cod larvae were able to capture nauplii even at very low prey densities. However, feeding incidence never exceeded 80 % at the highest prey densities (50 - 60 nauplii/l) even in the most developed larvae. The size range of nauplii eaten by cod larvae is seemingly uncorrelated to larval length at first-feeding. The larvae seemed to avoid the smallest sized particles and were possibly unable to eat the largest particles. First-feeding cod larvae seem to select nauplii within the size of 120 - 130 mu m (carapax length). The majority of first-feeding cod larvae in Lofoten were distributed in the upper 20 m...|$|R
