From the onset of their interactions the Later Stone Age record began to change. One such change was in stone tool preference; over much of southern Africa scraper frequencies increased whereas <b>backed</b> <b>tools</b> declined. However, between c.

This paper seeks to understand the role of <b>backed</b> <b>tools</b> at Dzombo from before the arrival of farmers until the establishment of the Mapungubwe state, c.

By performing a macro-fracture analysis it was possible to demonstrate an increased occurrence of fractures consistent with impact-related damage between approximately AD 350 and 1200, and it is suggested here that during this time hunting activities were intensified. The factors possibly driving this intensification are discussed and could relate to forager-farmer interactions or a shift in the site’s function. As is shown, the former is more likely. The macro-analysis of <b>backed</b> <b>tools</b> provides greater clarity when viewing Dzombo’s archaeological sequence and to some extent confirms earlier suggestions that in order to augment growing mercantile opportunities spurred on by the arrival of farmers, forager hunting activities increased...|$|R

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis thesis explores the dimensionality of the Defense Language Institute's (DLI) primary student feed <b>back</b> <b>tool</b> - the Automated Student Questionnaire (ASQ). In addition a data set from ASQ 2. 0 (the newest version) is analyzed for trends in student satisfaction across the sub-scales of sex, pay grade, and Defense Language Proficiency Test (DLPT) results. The method of principal components {{is used to}} derive initial factors. Although an interpretation of those factors seems plausible, these are subjected to a factor analysis rotation (varimax) and five factors are determined and interpreted. Each of the five factors are interpreted in terms of student satisfaction with DLI's: (1) academic environment, (2) military environment, (3) nonbarracks dormitory living conditions, (4) official and supplemental course audio tapes, and (5) service unit's computer learning centers. From the factor loading matrix factor scores equations are developed {{for use in a}} subscale trend analysis. Using nonparametric procedures, each factor is checked for differences in central tendency by sex, pay grade, and DLPT score (DLPT consists of three tests DLPTL, DLPTR, DLPTS). From this analysis the following results derive: (1) sex has no effect on any of the factors, (2) pay grade affects satisfaction with the military environment, (3) DLPTL, DLPTR, and DLPTS affect satisfaction with the academic environment, and DLPTS also affects satisfaction with the computer learning centers.

40|$|Background: Low {{back pain}} (LBP) {{is a major}} public health problem and the {{identification}} of individuals at risk of persistent LBP poses substantial challenges to clinical management. The STarT Back questionnaire is a validated nine-item patient self-report questionnaire that classifies patients with LBP at low, medium or high-risk of poor prognosis for persistent non-specific LBP. The objective {{of this study was}} to translate and cross-culturally adapt the English version of the STarT Back questionnaire into French. Methods: The translation was performed using best practice translation guidelines. The following phases were performed: contact with the STarT Back questionnaire developers, initial translations (English into French), synthesis, back translations, expert committee review, test of the pre-final version on 44 individuals with LBP, final version. Results: The linguistic translation required minor semantic alterations. The participants interviewed indicated that all items of the questionnaire were globally clear and comprehensible. However, 6 subjects (14 %) wondered if two questions were related to back pain or general health. After discussion within the expert committee and with the developer of the STarT <b>Back</b> <b>tool,</b> it was decided to modify the questionnaire and to add a reference to back pain in these two questions.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: An {{innovative}} commissioning pathway {{has recently}} been introduced in the United Kingdom allowing chiropractic organizations to provide state-funded chiropractic care to patients through referral from National Health Service (NHS) primary care physicians. The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine the outcomes of NHS and private patient groups presenting with musculoskeletal conditions to chiropractors under the Any Qualified Provider scheme and compare the clinical outcomes of these patients with those presenting privately. METHODS: A prospective cohort design monitoring patient outcomes comparing self-referring and NHS-referred patients undergoing chiropractic care was used. The primary outcome was the change in Bournemouth Questionnaire scores. Within- and between-group analyses were performed to explore differences between outcomes with additional analysis of subgroups as categorized by the STarT <b>back</b> <b>tool.</b> RESULTS: A total of 8222 patients filled in baseline questionnaires. Of these, NHS patients (41 %) had more adverse health measures at baseline and went on to receive more treatment. Using percent change in Bournemouth Questionnaire scores categorized at minimal clinical change cutoffs and adjusting for baseline differences, patients with low back and neck pain presenting privately are more likely to report improvement within 2 weeks and to have slightly better outcomes at 90 days. However, these patients were more likely to be attending consultations beyond 30 days. CONCLUSIONS: This study supports the contention that chiropractic services as provided in United Kingdom are appropriate for both private and NHS-referred patient groups and should be considered when general medical physicians make decisions concerning referral routes and pain pathways for patients with musculoskeletal conditions...|$|E
40|$|It {{is likely}} that {{individuals}} with nonspecific LBP (nsLBP) constitute a heterogenic group and targeting treatment appropriately to those most likely to respond is of major relevance. The STarT <b>Back</b> <b>Tool</b> (SBT) has been developed to stratify patients into risk groups to aid management choices. However, there is controversy over its generalisability and uncertainty as to the timing of use. This study investigated whether SBT categorisation early in a course of treatment would prove more prognostic than categorising patients at baseline. Seven hundred and forty nine patients {{over the age of}} 16 were recruited at 11 chiropractic clinics within the UK. The SBT was used to categorise these patients at presentation and 2 days following initial treatment with patient characteristics and condition specific markers also collected at baseline. The primary outcome was the Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) collected at 14, 30 and 90 days following the initial visit. In this population undergoing chiropractic care, patients had similar outcomes irrespective of their STarT back risk ranking. Multivariate prognostic models included only the post initial visit SBT as an independent predictor of favourable outcome for the medium risk group but only at 30 days. Follow up improvement was dominated by previous improvement in 30 and 90 -day models. Over one third of patients swapped SBT risk groups in the 2 day period between initial stratification and post initial visit although there was little difference in eventual improvement at follow-up.

40|$|Unlike other Gravettian {{contexts}} in Southern Iberian Peninsula, the Early Gravettian lithic assemblage from the archaeological site of Vale Boi (SW Portugal) {{is characterized by}} the absence of typical backed points, such as Gravettian and Microgravette points.

The STarT <b>Back</b> <b>Tool</b> (SBT) was recently validated to subgroup LBP patients into early treatment pathways. AimTo test the SBT’s concurrent validity against an existing, popular LBP subgrouping tool, the Örebro Musculoskeletal Pain Screening Questionnaire (ÖMPSQ), and to compare the clinical characteristics of subgroups identified by each tool. MethodsTwo hundred and forty-four consecutive ‘non-specific’ LBP consulters at 8 UK GP practices aged 18 – 59 years were invited to complete a questionnaire. Measures included the ÖMPSQ and SBT, disability, fear, catastrophising, pain intensity, episode duration and demographics. Instruments were compared using Spearman’s correlations, tests for subgroup agreement and discriminant analysis of subgroup characteristics according to reference standards. ResultsCompleted SBT (9 -items) and ÖMPSQ (24 -items) data was available for 130 / 244 patients (53 %). The correlation of SBT and ÖMPSQ scores was ‘excellent (rs= 0. 80). Subgroup characteristics were similar across the low, medium and high subgroups, but, the proportions allocated to ‘low’, ‘medium’ and ‘high’ risk groups were different, with fewer patients in the SBT’s high risk group. Both instruments similarly discriminated for reference standards such as disability, catastrophising, fear, comorbid pain and time off work. The ÖMPSQ was better at discriminating pain intensity, while the SBT was better for discriminating bothersomeness of back pain and referred leg pain. ConclusionsThe SBT baseline psychometrics performed similarly to the ÖMPSQ, but the SBT is shorter and easier to score and is an appropriate alternative for identifying high risk LBP patients in primary care...|$|E
40|$|The STarT <b>Back</b> <b>Tool</b> (SBT) {{has been}} {{recently}} validated {{for use as}} a prognostic screening tool with Lower Back Pain (LBP) patients in the primary care setting (1). A recent study by Hill et al (2) concluded that LBP outcomes and cost effectiveness could be improved from using the SBT to guide decision making and providing a stratified approach to care. The SBT was introduced to musculoskeletal physiotherapists working in the community setting for Bolton NHS Foundation Trust. This study aims to explore the perceptions and experiences of physiotherapists using the SBT in clinical practice. No study has yet explored this. Method: A qualitative study was conducted. A Nominal Group Technique (NGT) was undertaken to develop an appropriate set of questions for use in a single Focus Group (FG). The FG comprised of eight musculoskeletal physiotherapists. The FG was audio taped and the data obtained was analysed through Grounded Theory Methodology. Results: Physiotherapists felt the SBT acted in a confirmatory manner. Although deemed easy to use, a number of barriers led to only a small impact on decision making. These being, perceived oversimplification of the decision making process, impact on professional reputations and professional development, risks associated with single treatment sessions, patient satisfaction and threats to patient centred care. Conclusion: A number of barriers reduced Physiotherapist confidence in using the SBT to guide decision making and led to physiotherapists questioning whether a stratified approach to LBP management represented the ‘best care’ for their patients. The study highlighted the importance of a robust training prior to and during the implementation of the SBT and a stratified approach to care within physiotherapy departments...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Musculoskeletal {{pain and}} {{low back pain}} (LBP) in {{particular}} {{is one of the}} more costly health challenges to society. The STarT <b>Back</b> <b>Tool</b> (SBT) has been developed in the UK with a view to identifying subgroups of LBP patients in order to guide more cost effective care decisions. The Bournemouth Questionnaire (BQ) is a validated multidimensional patient reported outcome measure (PROM) that is widely used in routine clinical practice settings. This study sets out to describe and compare SBT and BQ scores within and between populations of patients presenting for chiropractic care in Norway and Great Britain. METHODS: Patient demographics, BQ and the 5 -item generic condition SBT data were collected from patients presenting with musculoskeletal pain to 18 Norwegian and 12 English chiropractors. Analysis of correlation between groups was achieved using a 1 -way Chi 2 approximation (p 4). By comparison, Norwegian chiropractic patients are: somewhat younger, have lower BQ scores, are less distressed by the condition and score significantly lower on items relating to catastrophisation and depression than English patients. There was an apparent association between total BQ and SBT scores (correlation 0. 59, p 4) on SBT. Furthermore, patients in "distressed by condition" SBT category who had marked the "low mood" question on SBT also had a high score on the "depression" question of BQ (> 6 (IQR 4 - 8), correlation 0. 54, p <. 0001). CONCLUSION: The BQ and SBT appear to identify the same subgroups in some, but not all of the measured items. It appears that unknown factors result in variations between patients seeking chiropractic care for comparable complaints in primary care in England vs Norway. Comparison of populations from Norway and UK demonstrate that extrapolating and pooling of data in relation to different populations should be done with caution, in regard to these stratification tools...|$|E

The aim of this PhD was to develop and evaluate a new clinical tool (called the STarT <b>Back</b> <b>Tool)</b> to allocate patients with back pain into initial treatment subgroups based on treatmentmodifiable prpgnostic indicators. Methods: The setting was, UK primary care adults consulting with non-specific pack Ã‚Â·Ã‚Â·pain:Constructs that were independent prognostic indicators for persistence were identified from secondary analysis of 2 existing cohorts and published literature and single screening questions identified. Psychometric properties of the tool, including concli. rrent and discriminant validity, internal consistency, repeatabili~y, were assessed. within a 'development' cohort (n= 131) and tool score cut-offs established to enable alloc~tion to three subgrOlJPs ('low', 'medium' and 'high' risk). Predictive and ext~rnal. validity were evaluated within an 'independent external' cohort (n= 500). The tool was. compared to an existing musculoskeletal screening tool (Orebro Musr:;uloskeletal Pain Screening Questionnaire) and to clinical acumen using video taped clinical interviews,. reviewed by primary care clinical-experts. Finally, the practical application of the tool was tested in. a pilot study and demonstrated to be feasible and acceptable to both. patients and clinicians. Results: The Tool included nine items: referred leg pain; comorbid pain; disability (two items); bothersomeness; catastr~phising; fear; anxiety, and depression. The latter 5 items were identified as a psychosocial subscale. The Tool demonstrated good reliability and validity and was acceptable to patients and clinicians.

40|$|Background Low {{back pain}} (LBP) {{is the most}} common {{reported}} musculoskeletal disorder, with large prevalence numbers and high costs. Focus on early identification of patients at risk of developing chronic LBP has increased. The Keele Start <b>Back</b> <b>Tool</b> (SBT) is a questionnaire aiming at screening prognostic indicators in LBP patients, categorizing patients into risk-groups and guide treatment. The aim {{of this study was to}} explore the Norwegian version of the SBT with regard to reliability of the SBT-scoring and the screening ability in LBP patients in primary care physiotherapy. Methods LBP patients answered a package of questionnaires twice, with 1 - 3 days in between, containing SBT, Hannover functional ability questionnaire, pain intensity questions and demographics. The relative and absolute reliability of SBT was calculated using intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and the smallest detectable change respectively. Independent sample t-tests were used for group comparisons. Results Fifty-two patients with LBP. Mean age (SD) was 45 (12) years and 62 % were female. The ICC (95 % CI) for SBT total score and psychosocial subscore was 0. 89 (0. 82, 0. 94) and 0. 82 (0. 70, 0. 90) respectively. None of the participants were allocated to the high risk group. The medium risk group reported significantly more pain last week and more activity limitations than the low risk group at both test and retest (0. 001 [*]≤[*]p[*]≤[*] 0. 003), whereas no significant difference between the groups was found on pain now (0. 05 [*]≤[*]p[*]≤[*] 0. 16). Conclusions The Norwegian version of the SBT was reliable and the screening ability was good as the subgrouping of patients into risk-groups reflected the severity of their back problems.

The present study aimed to evaluate {{the psychometric properties of}} the Japanese version of the tool (STarT-J). An online survey was conducted among Japanese patients with low back pain aged 20 - 64 years. Reliability was assessed by examining {{the internal consistency of the}} overall and psychosocial subscales using Cronbach's alpha coefficients. Spearman's correlation coefficients were used to evaluate the concurrent validity between the STarT-J total score/psychosocial subscore and standard reference questionnaires. Discriminant validity was evaluated by calculating the area under the curves (AUCs) for the total and psychosocial subscale scores against standard reference cases. Known-groups validity was assessed by examining the relationship between low back pain-related disability and STarT-J scores. The analysis included data for 2000 Japanese patients with low back pain; the mean (standard deviation [SD]) age was 47. 7 (9. 3) years, and 54. 1 % were male. The mean (SD) STarT-J score was 2. 2 (2. 1). The Cronbach's alpha coefficient was 0. 75 for the overall scale and 0. 66 for the psychosocial subscale. Spearman's correlation coefficients ranged from 0. 30 to 0. 59, demonstrating moderate to strong concurrent validity. The AUCs for the total score ranged from 0. 65 to 0. 83, mostly demonstrating acceptable discriminative ability. For known-groups validity, participants with more somatic symptoms had higher total scores. Those in higher STarT-J risk groups had experienced more low back pain-related absences. The overall STarT-J scale was internally consistent and had acceptable concurrent, discriminant, and known-groups validity. The STarT-J can be used with Japanese patients with low back pain...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Ocular surface {{squamous}} neoplasia (OSSN) {{is currently}} the commonest ocular malignancy affecting people of child bearing age and is associated with high morbidity and mortality rates in Zimbabwe. Early surgical intervention {{has been shown to}} mitigate the effects of OSSN amongst its victims, however this is hampered by limited histopathological services which should guide the extent of surgical excisions of these tumours. Purpose: The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the accuracy of Slit-lamp Assisted Visual Inspection (SAVI) in diagnosing ocular surface squamous neoplasia with the hope of recommending a fall <b>back</b> <b>tool</b> that ophthalmologists / medical practitioners / ophthalmic nurses or optometrists can use in resource limited situations without readily accessible histopathological services when surgical intervention is contemplated. Method: This was part of a study which screened one hundred and nineteen (119) patients with conjunctival growths and recruited sixty seven (67) patients with ocular surface squamous neoplasia by visual inspection over a period of six months. All patients received a week’s course of topical fluorometholone 0. 1 % and had the lesions excised either completely or partially depending on size of tumour and histology performed on the tissues. The histology results were compared with the results by visual inspection to determine diagnostic accuracy. Outcome measures were specificity, sensitivity and predictive values. Results: Total number of patients with conjunctival growths screened by visual inspection was 119, with median age of 42 years and a range of 18 to 90 years and gender ratio of 1 : 1. 9 in favour of females. There was no significant age difference between confirmed OSSN patients and non-OSSN (pterygia) and the p-value was 0. 617. Sensitivity and specificity of visual inspection in diagnosing OSSN when compared to histology were 94. 3 % and 74. 2 % respectively, with a positive predictive value of 74. 6 %. Histology reports indicated that 24. 5 % of OSSN specimens seen actually arose from pterygia. Conclusions: Slit lamp assisted visual inspection (SAVI) is an accurate method of clinically diagnosing OSSN and can be recommended for use in resource limited settings with hard to access histopathological services. <br /...|$|E
40|$|Background: Current {{research}} {{emphasizes the}} high prevalence {{and costs of}} low back pain (LBP). The STarT <b>Back</b> <b>Tool</b> was designed to support primary care decision making for treatment by helping to determine the treatment {{prognosis of patients with}} non-specific low back pain. The German version is the STarT-G. The cross-cultural translation of the tool followed a structured and widely accepted process but to date it was only partially validated with a small sample. The aim {{of the study was to}} test the psychometric properties construct validity, discriminative ability, internal consistency and test-retest-reliability of the STarT-G and to compare them with values given for the original English version. Methods: A consecutive cohort study with a two-week retest was conducted among patients with non-specific LBP, aged 18 to 60  years, from primary care practices. Questionnaires were collected before the first consultation, and two weeks later by post, using the following reference standards: the Roland and Morris disability questionnaire, the Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia, the Pain Catastrophizing Scale and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Psychometric properties examined included the tool’s discriminative abilities, whether the psychosocial subscale was one factor, internal consistency, item redundancy, test-retest reliability and floor and ceiling effects. Results: There were 228 patients recruited with a mean age of 42. 2 (SD 11. 0) years, and 53  % were female. The areas under the curve (AUC) for discriminative ability ranged from 0. 70 (STarT-G Subscale - Pain Catastrophizing Scale; CI 95 0. 63, 0. 78) to 0. 77 (STarT-G Total - Composite reference standard, CI 95 0. 60, 0. 94). Factor loadings ranged from 0. 49 to 0. 74. Cronbach’s alpha testing the internal consistency and redundancy for the total/subscale scores were α[*]=[*] 0. 52 / 0. 55 respectively. The STarT-G test-retest reliability Kappa values for the total/subscale scores were 0. 67 / 0. 68 respectively. No floor or ceiling effects were present. Conclusions: The STarT-G shows acceptable psychometric properties although not in exact agreement with the original English version. The items previously regarded as a psychosocial subscale may be better seen as an index of different individual psychosocial constructs. The relevance of using the tool at the point of consultation should be further examined...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Guidelines {{are often}} slowly adapted into {{clinical}} practice. However, actively supporting healthcare professionals in evidence-based treatment may speed up guideline implementation. Danish {{low back pain}} (LBP) guidelines focus on primary care treatment of LBP, to reduce referrals from primary care to secondary care. The primary aim of this project was to reduce secondary care referral within 12  weeks by a multifaceted implementation strategy (MuIS). Methods In a cluster randomised design, 189 general practices from the North Denmark Region were invited to participate. Practices were randomised (1 : 1) and stratified by practice size to MuIS (28 practices) or a passive implementation strategy (PaIS; 32 practices). Included were patients with LBP aged 18 to 65  years {{who were able to}} complete questionnaires, had no serious underlying pathology, and were not pregnant. We developed a MuIS including outreach visits, quality reports, and the STarT <b>Back</b> <b>Tool</b> for subgrouping patients with LBP. Both groups were offered the usual dissemination of guidelines, guideline-concordant structuring of the medical record, and a new referral opportunity for patients with psycho-social problems. In an intention-to-treat analysis, the primary and secondary outcomes pertained to the patient, and a cost-effectiveness analysis was performed from a healthcare sector perspective. Patients and the assessment of outcomes were blinded. Practices and caregivers delivering the interventions were not blinded. Results Between January 2013 and July 2014, 60 practices were included, of which 54 practices (28 MuIS, 26 PaIS) included 1101 patients (539 MuIS, 562 PaIS). Follow-up data for the primary outcome were available on 100  % of these patients. Twenty-seven patients (5. 0  %) in the MuIS group were referred to secondary care vs. 59 patients (10. 5  %) in the PaIS group. The adjusted odds ratio (AOR) was 0. 52 [95  % CI 0. 30 to 0. 90; p[*]=[*] 0. 020]. The MuIS was cost-saving £− 93. 20 (£ 406. 51 vs. £ 499. 71 per patient) after 12  weeks. Conversely, the MuIS resulted in less satisfied patients after 52  weeks (AOR 0. 50 [95  % CI 0. 31 to 0. 81; p[*]=[*] 0. 004]). Conclusions Using a MuIS changed general practice referral behaviour and was cost effective, but patients in the MuIS group were less satisfied. This study supports the application of a MuIS when implementing guidelines. Trial registration ClinicalTrials. gov, NCT 0169925...|$|E

40|$|This work {{regards the}} techno-functional {{study of the}} lithic {{industry}} from layer 23 of Grotta Paglicci (Rignano Garganico, Foggia) dated 28. 100 ± 400 BP uncal. and attributed to the Early Gravettian. The châine opératoire, finalized at blade-bladelet production, shows a ramification {{at the point of}} bladelet production, maybe to increase its productivity. Both soft stone and organic hammers were used for the detachments by the direct percussion. Among the lithic implements different techno-functional categories have been identified. The blade assemblage, characterized by a high morpho-technical and dimensional variability, comprises the tool-set referable to “domestic” activities, as shown by the use-wear referable to cutting, scraping and grooving. An interesting aspect is the functional role of many fractures.
