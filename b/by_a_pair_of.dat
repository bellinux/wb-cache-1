The next day Fulmars from 806 Squadron shot down one CANT Z.1007 bomber flying from Cyrenica to Sicily {{and a pair of}} Junkers Ju 52 transports flying fuel to North Africa. On the morning of 21 April, the carrier's aircraft dropped flares to illuminate the port so it could be shelled by three battleships and a light cruiser. On the way home, a pair of Fulmars shot down a Dornier Do 24 flying boat.|$|E

The musculo{{skeletal system}} is strong to enable it to support the head and body. The bones are fully ossified and the vertebrae interlock with each other by means of overlapping processes. The pectoral girdle is supported by muscle, and the well-developed pelvic girdle is attached to the backbone <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> sacral ribs. The ilium slopes forward and the body is held closer to the ground than is the case in mammals.|$|E

In their flight, Candide and Cacambo come across two naked women being chased and bitten <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> monkeys.

King Charles I ordered the capture of the town in early 1644, and sent his nephew, Maurice, with 5,000 troops. The siege was laid on 20 April, but despite a steady bombardment, and three {{attempts}} to storm the town by ground, the earthen defences of the town that had been established by Blake held fast. Lyme Regis was regularly re-provisioned and reinforced by sea, weakening the effectiveness of the siege, and on 14 June, Maurice withdrew from the siege {{in the face of a}} relieving army led by Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex.|$|E

The three of them and Ser Rodrik discuss the attempted murder of Bran. Littlefinger shocks them all by admitting that the assassin's dagger was once his own. He claims that he lost it to Tyrion Lannister, betting on Jaime Lannister to win a previous tourney. Littlefinger arranges a meeting between Eddard and Catelyn, and Eddard reluctantly takes on Littlefinger as an ally who will help them find Bran's assailant.|$|E
5|$|Early {{forms of}} {{xylophone}} {{such as the}} atranatrana are found throughout the island and {{are believed to have}} come across with the original Indonesian settlers.

Each woman strikes the atranatrana with a pair of sticks, one keeping the beat while the second plays a melody. The xylophone bars range from five to seven in number and are made of differing lengths of a rot-resistant wood called hazomalagny. A similar xylophone called katiboky is still played in the southwest among the Vezo and Bara ethnic groups.|$|E

5|$|Kennan {{found it}} {{difficult}} to perform his job in Belgrade. President Josip Broz Tito and his foreign minister, Koča Popović, began to suspect that Kennedy would adopt an anti-Yugoslav policy during his term. Tito and Popović considered Kennedy's decision to observe Captive Nations Week as an indication that the United States would assist anticommunist liberation efforts in Yugoslavia. Tito also believed that the CIA and the Pentagon were the true directors of American foreign policy. Kennan attempted to restore Tito's confidence in the American foreign policy establishment but his efforts were compromised <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> diplomatic blunders, the Bay of Pigs Invasion, and the U-2 spy incident.|$|E
5|$|Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, {{like all}} dinucleotides, {{consists}} of two nucleosides joined <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> bridging phosphate groups. The nucleosides each contain a ribose ring, one with adenine attached to the first carbon atom (the 1' position) {{and the other with}} nicotinamide at this position. The nicotinamide moiety can be attached in two orientations to this anomeric carbon atom. Because of these two possible structures, the compound exists as two diastereomers. It is the β-nicotinamide diastereomer of NAD that is found in organisms. These nucleotides are joined together by a bridge of two phosphate groups through the 5' carbons.|$|E
