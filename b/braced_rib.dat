5000|$|The 494 ft bridge has a 240 ft three-hinged <b>braced</b> <b>rib</b> steel arch, two 14 ft steel towers, and 16 {{timber trestle}} {{approach}} spans. The chords of the ribs {{are composed of}} channels. They are braced with two angles that are latticed in a Warren truss configuration. The vertical members of the towers and spandrel columns are madder up of two latticed channels. The 17.4 ft wide roadway rests on a Warren stiffening truss. The Minneapolis Steel and Machinery Company provided the steel for the project. The arches sit on concrete footings. The approaches and the deck were reconstructed in 1945.The Fairfax Bridge {{is one of two}} three-hinged lattice arches remaining within the State. In his book Bridge Engineering, J.A.L. Waddell explains the reason for the paucity of arches in the United States. [...] "Arches are employed very generally in Europe on account of their superior appearance as compared with simple-truss bridges, and because of the powerful influence of the old masonry arch upon the minds of European bridge designers, regardless of the consideration of economy. American engineers, on the other hand, have been indifferent to the question of aesthetics, and have preferred simple spans to arches mainly for reasons of simplicity and economy, but sometimes on account of their greater rigidity. Another reason why the arch has not been used much in American practice is that the conditions, which make it economical, are not met with as frequently in this country as in Europe. For deep gorges with rocky sides, or for shallow streams with rock bottom and natural abutments, arches are eminently proper and economical." [...] The conditions that made the bridge type economical in Europe were mirrored in the deep canyon of the Carbon River.|$|E
40|$|Dynamical {{characteristics}} of horizontal and torsional vibrations {{are important to}} the structural design against seismic loads and these characteristics must be analysed three-dimensionally. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to make clear the dynamical {{characteristics of}} <b>braced</b> <b>rib</b> arch bridges with long span and to obtain earthquake response of them. From these studies, following statements can be made; (1) the dynamical characteristics of horizontal and torsional vibrations of them must be analysed three-dimensionally, (2) they may be designed by modified seismic coefficient method against seismic loads...|$|E

5000|$|The DB-80's high, {{cantilever}} wing was unusual both in its construction and high aspect ratio of 9. In plan it was straight tapered on both edges but with semi-elliptical tips curved {{particularly on the}} trailing edges, where its ailerons were full span and broad. The wing was built around three spars, rather than the traditional one or two and the detail of their caps or flanges, rather than {{the shape of the}} longitudinal <b>braces</b> or <b>ribs,</b> determined the airfoil profile. [...] A similar but not identical wing structure was used on the Dyle et Bacalan DB-20.|$|R

5000|$|Jean Deschamps was {{entrusted}} with the work. He had already {{worked on the}} cathedrals at Narbonne and Limoges. Inspired by Beauvais and Amiens, he realized original plans in which the windows do not occupy all the available space between the supports {{and do not have}} any <b>bracing</b> arches, the <b>ribs</b> directly penetrate under the arch, the choir-rotunda pillars' elliptical plan allows all the light from the apsidal windows to penetrate into the sanctuary, and flying buttresses allow ingenious d√©bords into the nave aisles [...]|$|R
500|$|There {{were other}} {{considerable}} advancements in hydraulic engineering and nautical technology during the Song dynasty. The 10th-century {{invention of the}} pound lock for canal systems allowed different water levels to be raised and lowered for separated segments of a canal, which significantly aided the safety of canal traffic and allowed for larger barges. There was the Song-era innovation of watertight bulkhead compartments that allowed damage to hulls without sinking the ships. If ships were damaged, the Chinese of the 11th century employed drydocks to repair them while suspended out of the water. The Song used crossbeams to <b>brace</b> the <b>ribs</b> of ships in order to strengthen them in a skeletal-like structure. Stern-mounted rudders had been mounted on Chinese ships since the 1st century, as evidenced with a preserved Han tomb model of a ship. In the Song period, the Chinese devised a way to mechanically raise and lower rudders in order for ships to travel in {{a wider range of}} water depths. The Song arranged the protruding teeth of anchors in a circular pattern instead of in one direction. David Graff and Robin Higham state that this arrangement [...] " [...] them more reliable" [...] for anchoring ships.|$|R
5000|$|Thomas Telford {{worked as}} the County Surveyor of Shropshire between 1787 to 1834, and {{the bridge is}} {{reported}} to have once held a cast iron plate above the centre of the arch inscribed with [...] "Thomas Telford Esqr - Engineer - 1818", which is apparently visible in historic photographs, but has not been in place since at least 1985. The bridge design incorporates dressed red and grey sandstone abutments with ashlar dressings, these are slightly curved and ramped, with chamfered ashlar quoins, string courses, and moulded cornices. The structural cast-iron consists of a single segmental span with four arched lattice <b>ribs,</b> <b>braced</b> by five transverse cast-ironmembers. The road deck is formed from cast-iron metal deck plates, tarmacked over, and now finished with gravel. The original parapets have at some point been replaced with painted cast-iron railings with dograils, dogbars and shaped end balusters.|$|R
5000|$|During the Han Dynasty (202 BC-220 AD), a {{ship with}} a stern-mounted {{steering}} rudder along with masts and sails was innovated, {{known as the}} junk in Western terminology. The Chinese had been sailing through the Indian Ocean since the 2nd century BC, with their travels to Kanchipuram in India. This was followed up by many recorded maritime travelers following the same route to India, including Faxian, Zhiyan, Tanwujie, etc. Like in the Western tradition, the earlier Zhou Dynasty Chinese also made use of the floating pontoon bridge, which became a valuable means to blockade the entire Yangtze River during Gongsun Shu's rebellion against the re-established Han government in 33 AD. Although first described in ancient Ptolemaic Egypt, the Song Dynasty scientist Shen Kuo (1031-1095) {{was the first to}} describe the use of the drydock system in China to repair boats out of water. The canal pound lock was invented in China during the previous century, while Shen Kuo wrote of its effectiveness in his day, writing that ships no longer had the grievances of the old flash lock design and no longer had to be hauled over long distances (meaning heavier ships with heavier cargo of goods could traverse the waterways of China). [...] There were many other improvements to nautical technology during the Song period as well, including crossbeams <b>bracing</b> the <b>ribs</b> of ships to strengthen them, rudders that could be raised or lowered to allow ships to travel in a wider range of water depths, and the teeth of anchors arranged circularly instead of in one direction, [...] "making them more reliable".|$|R
2500|$|When the British fleet {{encountered}} the Chinese during the First Opium War, their officers noted {{the appearance of}} paddle-wheel boats among the Chinese fleet, which they took {{for a copy of}} the Western design. Paddle-wheel boats were actually developed by the Chinese independently in the 5th6th centuries, only a century after their first surviving mention in Roman sources (see Paddle steamer), though that method of propulsion had been abandoned for many centuries and only recently reintroduced before the war. Numerous other innovations were present in Chinese vessels during the Middle Ages that had not yet been adopted by the Western and Islamic worlds, some of which were documented by Marco Polo but which did not enter into other navies until the 18th century, when the British successfully incorporated them into ship designs. For example, medieval Chinese hulls were split into bulkhead sections so that a hull rupture only flooded a fraction of the ship and did not necessarily sink it (see Ship floodability). This was described in the book of the Song Dynasty maritime author Zhu Yu, the Pingzhou Table Talks of 1119 AD. [...] Along with the innovations described in Zhu's book, there were many other improvements to nautical technology in the medieval Song period. These included crossbeams <b>bracing</b> the <b>ribs</b> of ships to strengthen them, rudders that could be raised or lowered to allow ships to travel in a wider range of water depths, and the teeth of anchors arranged circularly instead of in one direction, [...] "making them more reliable". [...] Junks also had their sails staggered by wooden poles so that the crew could raise and lower them with ropes from the deck, like window blinds, without having to climb around and tie or untie various ropes every time the ship needed to turn or adjust speed.|$|R
50|$|Surface Hill Uniting Church is a {{load-bearing}} masonry {{and cement}} rendered building that sits {{with a group}} of other buildings within the Uniting Church precinct on Surface Hill in Gympie. The site also contains a timber hall (the former church, built in 1869), a masonry and fibro hall (1962) and a brick parsonage (1975). The building is an unpretentious interpretation of Gothic style, using Gothic motifs yet simple and restrained in its overall design and composition. The street facade (southern elevation) is the most ornate with towers at each corner, lancet and rose windows and other moulded decorations. The church is rectilinear in form, divided into six bays by stepped buttresses, each bay containing a lancet window. The roof is steeply pitched and clad in colourbonded corrugated steel with lightning conductors at each gable end.The interior of the church is also cement-rendered with a decorative cornice and mouldings around the windows and at dado and picture rail height. Engaged columns with decorative capitals mark each of the bays internally. The lofty space of the interior has a vaulted ceiling lined in timber VJ boarding <b>braced</b> with timber <b>ribs</b> and punctuated with ceiling roses with timber fretwork. Light fittings and ceiling fans are suspended from the ceiling on stiff rods. Lancet windows infilled with diamond-patterned leadlight with glass in pale tones are located along the side walls and the southern elevation has an arrangement of four similar windows highset in the wall, flanked by two stained glass rose windows. Most of the windows are now framed in aluminium.|$|R
