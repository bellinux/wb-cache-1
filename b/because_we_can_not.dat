This, too, represents nature as under incapacities corresponding to those of our intellect; but instead of only asserting that nature can not do a thing <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> conceive it done, goes the still greater length of averring that nature does a particular thing, on the sole ground that we can see no reason why she should not.

A phenomenon must follow a certain law, because we see no reason why it should deviate from that law in one way rather than in another.

60|$|It {{is strange}} that any one, {{after such a}} warning, should rely implicitly on the {{evidence}} a priori of such propositions as these, that matter can not think; that space, or extension, is infinite; that nothing can be made out of nothing (ex nihilo nihil fit). Whether these propositions are true {{or not this is}} not the place to determine, nor even whether the questions are soluble by the human faculties. But such doctrines are no more self-evident truths, than the ancient maxim that a thing can not act where it is not, which probably is not now believed by any educated person in Europe.(236) Matter can not think; why? <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> conceive thought to be annexed to any arrangement of material particles. Space is infinite, because having never known any part of it which had not other parts beyond it, we can not conceive an absolute termination. Ex nihilo nihil fit, because having never known any physical product without a pre-existing physical material, we can not, or think we can not, imagine a creation out of nothing. But these things may in themselves be as conceivable as gravitation without an intervening medium, which Newton thought too great an absurdity for any person of a competent faculty of philosophical thinking to admit: and even supposing them not conceivable, this, for aught we know, may be merely one of the limitations of our very limited minds, and not in nature at all.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Spencer {{would have}} a much {{stronger}} case, if he could really show that the evidence of Reasoning rests on the Postulate, or, in other words, that we believe that a conclusion follows from premises only <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> conceive it not to follow. But this statement {{seems to me to}} be of the same kind as one I have previously commented on, viz., that I believe I see light, because I can not, while the sensation remains, conceive that I am looking into darkness. Both these statements seem to me incompatible with the meaning (as very rightly limited by Mr. Spencer) of the verb to conceive. To say that when I apprehend that A is B and that B is C, I can not conceive that A is not C, is to my mind merely to say that I am compelled to believe that A is C. If to conceive be taken in its proper meaning, viz., to form a mental representation, I may be able to conceive A as not being C. After assenting, with full understanding, to the Copernican proof that it is the earth and not the sun that moves, I not only can conceive, or represent to myself, sunset as a motion of the sun, but almost every one finds this conception of sunset easier to form, than that which they nevertheless know to be the true one.|$|E
60|$|The {{prevailing}} {{hypothesis of}} a luminiferous ether, {{in other respects}} not without analogy to that of Descartes, is not in its own nature entirely {{cut off from the}} possibility of direct evidence in its favor. It is well known that the difference between the calculated and the observed times of the periodical return of Encke’s comet, has led to a conjecture that a medium capable of opposing resistance to motion is diffused through space. If this surmise should be confirmed, in the course of ages, by the gradual accumulation of a similar variance {{in the case of the}} other bodies of the solar system, the luminiferous ether would have made a considerable advance toward the character of a vera causa, since the existence would have been ascertained of a great cosmical agent, possessing some of the attributes which the hypothesis assumes; though there would still remain many difficulties, and the identification of the ether with the resisting medium would even, I imagine, give rise to new ones. At present, however, this supposition can not be looked upon as more than a conjecture; the existence of the ether still rests on the possibility of deducing from its assumed laws a considerable number of actual phenomena; and this evidence I can not regard as conclusive, <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> have, in the case of such an hypothesis, the assurance that if the hypothesis be false it must lead to results at variance with the true facts.|$|E

60|$|The {{phenomena}} {{with which}} this science is conversant being the thoughts, feelings, {{and actions of}} human beings, it would have attained the ideal perfection of a science if it enabled us to foretell how an individual would think, feel, or act throughout life, with the same certainty with which astronomy enables us to predict the places and the occultations of the heavenly bodies. It needs scarcely be stated that nothing approaching to this can be done. The actions of individuals could not be predicted with scientific accuracy, were it only <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> foresee {{the whole of the}} circumstances in which those individuals will be placed. But further, even in any given combination of (present) circumstances, no assertion, which is both precise and universally true, can be made respecting the manner in which human beings will think, feel, or act. This is not, however, because every person’s modes of thinking, feeling, and acting do not depend on causes; nor can we doubt that if, in the case of any individual, our data could be complete, we even now know enough of the ultimate laws by which mental phenomena are determined, to enable us in many cases to predict, with tolerable certainty, what, in the greater number of supposable combinations of circumstances, his conduct or sentiments would be. But the impressions and actions of human beings are not solely the result of their present circumstances, but the joint result of those circumstances and of the characters of the individuals; and the agencies which determine human character are so numerous and diversified (nothing which has happened to the person throughout life being without its portion of influence), that in the aggregate they are never in any two cases exactly similar. Hence, even if our science of human nature were theoretically perfect, that is, if we could calculate any character as we can calculate the orbit of any planet, from given data; still, as the data are never all given, nor ever precisely alike in different cases, we could neither make positive predictions, nor lay down universal propositions.|$|E
6000|$|... § 3. The {{negative}} argument is, that, whether inconceivability be {{good evidence}} or bad, no stronger evidence {{is to be}} obtained. That what is inconceivable can not be true, is postulated in every act of thought. It {{is the foundation of}} all our original premises. Still more it is assumed in all conclusions from those premises. The invariability of belief, tested by the inconceivableness of its negation, “is our sole warrant for every demonstration. Logic is simply a systematization of the process by which we indirectly obtain this warrant for beliefs that do not directly possess it. To gain the strongest conviction possible respecting any complex fact, we either analytically descend from it by successive steps, each of which we unconsciously test by the inconceivableness of its negation, until we reach some axiom or truth which we have similarly tested; or we synthetically ascend from such axiom or truth by such steps. In either case we connect some isolated belief, with a belief which invariably exists, by a series of intermediate beliefs which invariably exist.” The following passage sums up the theory: “When we perceive that the negation of the belief is inconceivable, we have all possible warrant for asserting the invariability of its existence: and in asserting this, we express alike our logical justification of it, and the inexorable necessity we are under of holding it.... We have seen that this is the assumption on which every conclusion whatever ultimately rests. We have no other guarantee for the reality of consciousness, of sensations, of personal existence; we have no other guarantee for any axiom; we have no other guarantee for any step in a demonstration. Hence, as being taken for granted in every act of the understanding, it must be regarded as the Universal Postulate.” But as this postulate, which we are under an “inexorable necessity” of holding true, is sometimes false; as “beliefs that once were shown by the inconceivableness of their negations to invariably exist, have since been found untrue,” and as “beliefs that now possess this character may some day share the same fate;” the canon of belief laid down by Mr. Spencer is, that “the most certain conclusion” is that “which involves the postulate the fewest times.” Reasoning, therefore, never ought to prevail against one of the immediate beliefs (the belief in Matter, in the outward reality of Extension, Space, and the like), because each of these involves the postulate only once; while an argument, besides involving it in the premises, involves it again in every step of the ratiocination, no one of the successive acts of inference being recognized as valid except <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> conceive the conclusion not to follow from the premises.|$|E
60|$|In the {{dissertation}} which Mr. Herbert Spencer has prefixed to his, in many respects, highly philosophical {{treatise on}} the Mind,(91) he criticises {{some of the}} doctrines of the two preceding chapters, and propounds a theory of his own {{on the subject of}} first principles. Mr. Spencer agrees with me in considering axioms to be “simply our earliest inductions from experience.” But he differs from me “widely as to the worth of the test of inconceivableness.” He thinks that it is the ultimate test of all beliefs. He arrives at this conclusion by two steps. First, we never can have any stronger ground for believing any thing, than that the belief of it “invariably exists.” Whenever any fact or proposition is invariably believed; that is, if I understand Mr. Spencer rightly, believed by all persons, and by one’s self at all times; it is entitled to be received as one of the primitive truths, or original premises of our knowledge. Secondly, the criterion by which we decide whether any thing is invariably believed to be true, is our inability to conceive it as false. “The inconceivability of its negation is the test by which we ascertain whether a given belief invariably exists or not.” “For our primary beliefs, the fact of invariable existence, tested by an abortive effort to cause their non-existence, is the only reason assignable.” He thinks this the sole ground of our belief in our own sensations. If I believe that I feel cold, I only receive this as true because I can not conceive that I am not feeling cold. “While the proposition remains true, the negation of it remains inconceivable.” There are numerous other beliefs which Mr. Spencer considers to rest on the same basis; being chiefly those, or a part of those, which the metaphysicians of the Reid and Stewart school consider as truths of immediate intuition. That there exists a material world; that this is the very world which we directly and immediately perceive, and not merely the hidden cause of our perceptions; that Space, Time, Force, Extension, Figure, are not modes of our consciousness, but objective realities; are regarded by Mr. Spencer as truths known by the inconceivableness of their negatives. We can not, he says, by any effort, conceive these objects of thought as mere states of our mind; as not having an existence external to us. Their real existence is, therefore, as certain as our sensations themselves. The truths which are the subject of direct knowledge, being, according to this doctrine, known to be truths only by the inconceivability of their negation; and the truths which are not the object of direct knowledge, being known as inferences from those which are; and those inferences being believed to follow from the premises, only <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> conceive them not to follow; inconceivability is thus the ultimate ground of all assured beliefs.|$|E

If a theory has shown to be essentially correct in some domain (i. e. by thorough validation against the target problem or domain) using it as a framework can be helpful, however, if the theory is not mature or even speculative then it can effectively prevent progress. I argue that, although <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> ever completely avoid this sort of bias, <b>we</b> <b>can</b> minimise its effect.

Mapping of VP/VS provides important information.

The quality of VP/VS map from PS and filtered PP seismic volumes was significantly improved compared with the quality of VP/VS map from PS and unfiltered PP seismic volumes. Meanwhile, the error from surrounding formations was analyzed <b>because</b> <b>we</b> usually <b>can</b> <b>not</b> get reliable reflection pick from the target formation and have to interpret those coherent events from surrounding formations.

40|$|Abstract. It is {{well known}} that the {{standard}} 3 -valued logic programs with con-straints can be inconsistent. <b>Because</b> of that <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> use it for a data integration where mutually inconsistent information comes from different data sources. We argue that a natural way to answer to this challenge, without collapsing all sen-tences into inconsistency, is by passing to 4 -valued bilattice-based logic (with logic values: true, false, unknown and possible), and by interpreting the incon-sistent information with a logic value ”possible”. Differently from the paracon-sistent approach we adopt the belief-revision approach, but in such many-valued repairing of inconsistent information we do not eliminate mutually inconsistent information {{as in the case of}} a 2 -valued database repairing. The original contribution of this paper is an Autoepistemic Many-valued Logic with intuitionistic implication, epistemic negation and Moore’s modal operator: the inference reasoning of this logic is able to change its belief in the truth value of ground facts which come from external sources, and to preserve its internal consistency.

30|$|Complexity, {{emphasizing}} both {{complexity of}} the individual in its cognitive processes and complexity of social systems with their non-linear social interaction property, adds something further to this already well defined picture. From our perspective, it completes it {{by going to the}} interaction structural mechanism underlying the adaptation process. In fact, whereas in the linear framework the element of surprise is missing, the non linearity property makes the element of surprise the functioning and evolution rule of social systems. So, it enables an epilogue that Durkheim could not have suspected and under a specific profile even more pessimistic. We must, in fact, delve within the deeper sense of adaptation. In this case, what does adapting really mean? To what kind of personality does the ability to adapt to individualistic freedom refer to? In conclusion, <b>we</b> <b>can</b> derive two disarming implications. The first is that even if <b>we</b> <b>can</b> show that suicides regress at a certain point in time after industrial development <b>because</b> of adaptation <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> however ‘shout victory’. For, in fact, man has become more and more ‘selfish’, indifferent, and cynical. The second implication concerns the problem of prevention. The prevention problem obsessing Durkheim finds paradoxically, to a certain extent, a solution, and finds it precisely in suicide’s prime cause, in the individualization process itself and in its unexpected, surprising manifestations.|$|R
40|$|Spatial {{variability}} is {{all that}} stands between hydrology and science, forcing us to deal in probabilities and averages. <b>Because</b> of scale, <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> consider forces on individual soil particles, water molecules and solute ions when addressing human size problems. We must therefore look at aggregate properties and mean values for parameters and inputs in computer modeling of hydrologic phenomena. This research explores the impact of spatially variable inputs on the Water Erosion Prediction Project soil erosion computer program. Distributions of input variables are generated and assigned randomly to a grid of homogeneous rangeland hillslope elements. Values for runoff volume and sediment loss from each flow path are recorded and averaged to provide a distribution of outputs {{in the form of}} a sensitivity analysis. Variabilities of slope, slope length, soil textures, soil characteristics, terrain, convex and concave slopes, soil saturation, rainfall amount and vegetation were examined. Results show that use of mean inputs values in the WEPP representative hillslope model yields very similar outputs to the spatially variable research model using a distribution of inputs in all simulations in the case of totally random bare rangeland soils. When a decreasing trend in soil clay content is introduced in the variable model, the hillslope model using average values as inputs no longer provides a good estimate of the sediment loss. When random vegetation is generated and added to the simulation, runoff volume continues to be similar between the two models, but the sediment loss is much higher in the spatially variable model. In addition, the results of the standard hillslope model are much less responsive to changes in slope than those of the spatially variable model. It is concluded that spatial variability of soils must be considered when there is a linear change in input values with slope position. Likewise spatial variability of vegetation needs to be addressed in order to accurately estimate erosion on the rangeland watersheds considered in this dissertation. It is also found that this type of simulation provides a model for sensitivity analysis of a complex computer programs. Physically related inputs can be generated in such a way as to preserve the desired interrationships and distributions of inputs can be directly compared to generated distributions of outputs...|$|R

At that time we measured over 600 structures. Most loading tests of bridges and Viaducts were made. The measurements of movements needed to be as precise and accurate as possible. To do that laboratory test of instruments were made to see which instrument gives us reliable results. Displacements can be determined by geodetic and physical methods, depends of the construction. The use of geodetic methods are still preferable. In the paper the measurements with the total station, the level and rotation level, photogrammetry and solutions on the field by physical methods with inductive transducers are presented. We need to measure displacements as quick as possible but efficiently <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> repeat the measurements under the same conditions. Also the surveying on the bridge and in the lab with the comparison of methods is presented under the different hard terrain conditions - water beneath the construction, big height of the structure, unapproachability, large span structures...|$|E
