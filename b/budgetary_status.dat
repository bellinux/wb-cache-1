40|$|Two {{reports are}} {{presented}} in this document prepared for the Colorado State Legislature. The first, a zero-base budget review presents {{a summary of the}} characteristics of the studerl,t population served by Colorado's 11 junior colleges. The summary includes statistics on age range, state of residence, gender, ethnic background, tyes of fin 4 ncial aid received, and credit hour enrollment. Summary budget data are presented fcr the state system including a description of the <b>budgetary</b> <b>status</b> cf the system for fiscal year (FY) 1978 - 79, and a list of summary conclusions based cn the zero-base budget review reports submitted by the individual colleges. The second document, a budget overview for FY 1978 - 79, consists of an introduction and six narrative sections dealing with: (1) the development of the comprehensive community junior college in general and its specific development in Coloradc; (2) the role...|$|E
40|$|A geomorphic {{assessment}} of reef system calcification is conducted for past (3200 Ka to present), {{present and future}} (2010 - 2100) time periods. Reef platform sediment production is estimated at 569 m 3 yr- 1 using rate laws that express gross community carbonate production {{as a function of}} seawater aragonite saturation, community composition and rugosity and incorporating estimates of carbonate removal from the reef system. Key carbonate producers including hard coral, crustose coralline algae and Halimeda are mapped accurately (mean R 2  =  0. 81). Community net production estimates correspond closely to independent census-based estimates made in-situ (R 2  =  0. 86). Reef-scale outputs are compared with historic rates of production generated from (i) radiocarbon evidence of island deposition initiation around 3200 years ago, and (ii) island volume calculated from a high resolution island digital elevation model. Contemporary carbonate production rates appear to be remarkably similar to historical values of 573 m 3 yr- 1. Anticipated future seawater chemistry parameters associated with an RCP 8. 5 emissions scenario are employed to model rates of net community calcification for the period 2000 - 2100 on the basis of an inorganic aragonite precipitation law, under the assumption of constant benthic community character. Simulations indicate that carbonate production will decrease linearly to a level of 118 m 3 yr- 1 by 2100 and that by 2150 aragonite saturation levels may no longer support the positive <b>budgetary</b> <b>status</b> necessary to sustain island accretion. Novel aspects of this assessment include the development of rate law parameters to realistically represent the variable composition of coral reef benthic carbonate producers, incorporation of three dimensional rugosity of the entire reef platform and the coupling of model outputs with both historical radiocarbon dating evidence and forward hydrochemical projections to conduct an {{assessment of}} island evolution through time. By combining several lines of evidence in a deterministic manner, an assessment of changes in carbonate production is carried out that has tangible geomorphic implications for sediment availability and associated island evolution...|$|E
40|$|Polarization in the European Parliament has mainly been {{attributed}} to the ideological dimension. The economic implications of bills have been only studied {{in relation to the}} Council. However, after the ratification of the Lisbon treaty such questions have become paramount for the Parliament. The aim of this thesis is to investigate whether legislative unity is lower for bills that would affect the budget in a way that, if passed, would change the status quo allocation of resources. I propose that the impact of such budgetary implications is dependent on the initial level of polarization within the European Parliament. In the absence of other polarizing factors, such as defections or splits within the party of the rapporteur, budgetary implications are likely to decrease legislative unity. Nonetheless, the negative effect of budgetary implications on legislative unity is mitigated by defections on behalf of the party of the rapporteur. In order to evaluate these propositions empirically I have collected data on final votes in the 7 th European Parliament. In contrast to datasets that the previous literature has relied on, this dataset contains information on the budgetary implications of the bills. Estimating a series of tobit regression models, I show that budgetary implications affect the level of cohesion in the European Parliament, but this effect is conditional upon the level of initial polarization as captured by defection from the party of the rapporteur. This finding is relatively robust, thus shedding new light on voting patterns in the European Parliament. Yet, some shortcomings remain, namely the differentiation at a theoretical level between partisan and national interests, the small magnitude of the coefficients and a potential endogenity problem. These caveats notwithstanding, it can be concluded that the behaviour of legislators is affected by economic concerns, even if to a certain extent such concerns are masked by ideological variables. It is likely that there is lower legislative unity when bills aim to alter the existing <b>budgetary</b> <b>status</b> quo. Yet, conversely, when both defection by the party of the rapporteur and budgetary implications are observed this effect is alleviated...|$|E
40|$|After 28 {{years of}} federal and state policy development, {{regional}} and local initiatives and various <b>budgetary</b> appropriations, the <b>status</b> of American schools continues to decline. Lyne (2001) reported that Finland, Japan and Korea had the world 2 ̆ 7 s highest literacy in reading, math, and science, while the United States ranked 15 in reading literacy, 19 in mathematical literacy, and 14 in scientific literacy. Many factors may contribute to the decline in America 2 ̆ 7 s schools. However, with the prevailing economic decline in the United States schools continue to struggle with student achievement, especially students with who are low socio-economic. In addition, to meeting the needs of this perverse challenge schools are expected to ensure that all students learn and become proficient by 2014. This qualitative multiple case study explores the instructional leadership behaviors of three principals of elementary schools in Arkansas with a percentage of 50 or above low socio-economic students, in three different geographical regions, and with a student population of 500 or more. In addition, the three schools were ranked 2 ̆ 2 Level 52 ̆ 2 schools of excellence for improvement in 2008. Data were collected through structured in-depth interviews with the principals and teachers to discover the instructional behaviors for leadership. Hoy and Hoy 2 ̆ 7 s (2006, 2009) principals 2 ̆ 7 instructional leadership behaviors were used as the theoretical framework: 1) academic excellence, 2) instructional excellence, 3) instructional improvement, 4) the providing of support, 5) intellectual leaders, and 6) recognition and celebration of academic excellence. This research study describes how the principals 2 ̆ 7 instructional leadership behaviors are articulated in the schools to promote academic excellence in schools with similar factors of poverty...|$|R
