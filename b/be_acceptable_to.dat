5|$|Charles VI had {{instructed}} his {{representative to the}} papal court Maximilian Ulrich von Kaunitz {{to work closely with}} Álvaro Cienfuegos to elect a candidate that he favoured. Cuenfuego's instructions were that cardinals Pamfili, Vallemani, Spada, Piazza, Corradini, Caracciolo, Tanara, Orsini, Ruffo, Colonna, Davia, Boncompagni, Pico, and Pignatelli would <b>be</b> <b>acceptable</b> <b>to</b> the emperor, and that cardinals Paolucci, Olivieri, Bussi, Sagripanti, and Origo were to be excluded.|$|E
5|$|A {{siege of}} the castle was started, but through papal {{intervention}} King Henry later entered on a more conciliatory path. A commission was appointed to draw up an arrangement that would <b>be</b> <b>acceptable</b> <b>to</b> both sides. The resulting Dictum of Kenilworth offered the rebels {{the right to buy}} back forfeited estates, at prices depending on their level of involvement in the rebellion. After initial resistance, the terms were eventually accepted. By the summer of 1267, the country was pacified, and this spirit of reconciliation would last until the 1290s. The Dictum of Kenilworth was later incorporated into the Statute of Marlborough.|$|E
5|$|Cupid conceals himself, as Theseus and Ariadne {{arrive on}} the island a short {{distance}} away. Ariadne muses over her disloyalty to her father, but declares her love for Theseus. She departs to find shelter for the night, after which a fishermen's chorus compares her eyes with the stars of heaven. Theseus, alone with his counsellor, discusses his abandonment of Ariadne, and is advised that this decision is justified, as she will not <b>be</b> <b>acceptable</b> <b>to</b> the people of Athens as their ruler's consort.|$|E

5|$|Lloyd George agreed {{it might}} <b>be</b> <b>acceptable</b> <b>to</b> the British electorate. However, America {{was against the}} plan; the US was then the largest creditor, and by this time Wilson had started {{to believe in the}} merits of a harsh peace and thought that his country had already made {{excessive}} sacrifices. Hence despite his best efforts, the end result of the conference was a treaty which disgusted Keynes both on moral and economic grounds, and led to his resignation from the Treasury.|$|E
5|$|Some {{processes}} {{convert a}} meat or dairy product into a pareve (neither meat nor dairy) one. For example, rennet is sometimes made from stomach linings, yet is acceptable for making kosher cheese, but such cheeses might not <b>be</b> <b>acceptable</b> <b>to</b> some vegetarians, who would eat only cheese {{made from a}} vegetarian rennet. The same applies to kosher gelatin, an animal product, derived from kosher animal sources. Other gelatin-like products from non-animal sources such as agar agar and carrageenan are pareve by nature. Fish gelatin is derived from fish and is therefore (like all kosher fish products) pareve. Eggs are also considered pareve despite being an animal product.|$|E
5|$|The papal {{conclave}} of 1724 {{was called}} upon {{the death of}} Pope Innocent XIII. It began on 20 March 1724 and ended on 28 May that year {{with the election of}} Vincenzo Maria Orsini, a Dominican friar, as Pope Benedict XIII. The conclave was made of largely the same electors that had elected Innocent in 1721 and the same factions dominated it. Multiple attempts were made to elect candidates that would <b>be</b> <b>acceptable</b> <b>to</b> the various Catholic monarchies at the time, but none were successful until May. Benedict resisted his own election for two days before being convinced to accept it.|$|E

5|$|The {{religious}} {{houses were}} dissolved in the Reformation, and their lands broken up. The Priory Church of St John remains, as does St John's Gate, traditionally {{regarded as the}} boundary between Smithfield and Clerkenwell. John Houghton (later canonized by Pope Paul VI as St John Houghton), Prior of Charterhouse, went to Thomas Cromwell accompanied by two other local priors seeking an oath of supremacy that would <b>be</b> <b>acceptable</b> <b>to</b> their communities. This resulted in their being flung into the Tower of London, and on 4 May 1535, they were taken to Tyburn and hanged — becoming the first Catholic martyrs of the Reformation. On 29 May, the remaining twenty monks and eighteen lay brothers were forced to swear the oath of allegiance; the ten who refused were taken to Newgate Prison and left to starve.|$|E
5|$|The Scottish {{education}} system underwent radical change and {{expansion in the}} 20th century. In 1918 Roman Catholic schools were brought into the system, but retained their distinct religious character, access to schools by priests and the requirement that school staff <b>be</b> <b>acceptable</b> <b>to</b> the Church. The school leaving age was raised to 14 in 1901, and although plans to raise it to 15 in the 1940s were never ratified, increasing numbers stayed on beyond elementary education and it was eventually raised to 16 in 1973. As a result, secondary education was the major area {{of growth in the}} inter-war period, particularly for girls, who stayed on in full-time education in increasing numbers throughout the century. New qualifications were developed to cope with changing aspirations and economics, with the Leaving Certificate being replaced by the Scottish Certificate of Education Ordinary Grade ('O-Grade') and Higher Grade ('Higher') qualifications in 1962, which became the basic entry qualification for university study. The centre of the {{education system}} also became more focused on Scotland, with the ministry of education partly moving north in 1918 and then finally having its headquarters relocated to Edinburgh in 1939. After devolution, in 1999 the new Scottish Executive set up an Education Department and an Enterprise, Transport and Lifelong Learning Department, which together took over its functions. One of the major diversions from practice in England, possible because of devolution, was the abolition of student tuition fees in 1999, instead retaining a system of means-tested student grants.|$|E

25|$|G. Wissowa {{advanced}} {{the hypothesis that}} Semo Sancus is the genius of Jupiter. W. W.

Franklin responded by saying that the official separation of Church and State in the United States did not permit the government to have any official opinion on who should govern American Catholics. He suggested privately that perhaps a French bishop might be given oversight of the small but growing Catholic community in the U.S.|$|E
25|$|Between Abrahams’ {{visit to}} Nyasaland and the {{publication}} of his report, Edmund Richards, the governor from 1942 to 1947, strongly advocated to the Colonial Office that the Nyasaland government should purchase the Magomero estare of A L Bruce Estates, a single block of approximately 162,000 acres surrounded by very congested areas of Native Trust Land. The Colonial Office was only prepared to allow the Nyasaland government to offer five shillings an acre, a high price for land which had been over-used and deforested, but too low to <b>be</b> <b>acceptable</b> <b>to</b> the owner.|$|E
25|$|Rage {{has a good}} {{reputation}} among viewers for its minimalist format which has remained largely unchanged {{for more than two}} decades. The program was originally created by executive producer Mark FitzGerald in early 1987 under the working title 'rage til you puke'. This was later shortened to rage, as this was deemed more likely to <b>be</b> <b>acceptable</b> <b>to</b> the ABC board. It debuted in April 1987 – the same month as MTV Australia debuted as a late night programme on the Nine Network and two months after Video Hits debuted on the Ten Network.|$|E

25|$|The {{principles}} of Dhamma were formulated to <b>be</b> <b>acceptable</b> <b>to</b> people belonging to different communities and following any religion. Dhamma {{was not given}} any formal definition or structure. It emphasized tolerance of people {{and the notion of}} showing consideration towards slaves and servants; there is stress on obedience to elders; generosity towards the needy, Brahmans and Sarmanas. Ashoka pleaded for tolerance of different religious sects in an attempt {{to create a sense of}} harmony. The policy of Dhamma also laid stress on non-violence, which was to be practiced by giving up war and conquests and also as a restraint on the killing of animals. However, Ashoka realized that a certain display of his political might may be necessary to keep the primitive forest-dwelling tribes in check.|$|E
