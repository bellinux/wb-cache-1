5000|$|Bismarck {{was built}} by the Blohm & Voss shipbuilders in Hamburg, Germany.

During the launching ceremony Countess Bismarck had difficulty breaking the bottle of champagne herself, and Kaiser Wilhelm II had to assist. The ship {{was to have been}} the flagship of the Hamburg America Line and the final of Albert Ballin's [...] "Big Three" [...] ( [...] , which later became RMS Berengaria, and Vaterland, which later became [...] ). Majestic was intended to be the same size as Vaterland, in both tonnage and length, but a miscommunication that Cunard's [...] would be larger made HAPAG demand an extra 6 ft in length, increasing her gross tonnage. Aquitania was actually 50 ft shorter than both Vaterland and Bismarck.Though Bismarck was third of the [...] "Big Three", she was most similar to her immediate predecessor [...] and was essentially a slightly enlarged version of that ship. There were significant differences between her and the first of the three, [...] Bismarck had an overall length of 956.0 ft, a breadth of 100.1 ft and according to her British registration papers a gross tonnage of 56,551 tons. Excluding the tank-top, there were 11 decks ranging from Deck-A to Deck-L (there was no Deck-I). Decks J and K were only present at the ends of ship. Transversely the ship was divided into 14 watertight compartments. Like her sister Vaterland, the <b>boiler</b> <b>uptakes</b> (used to carry exhaust gases from the boilers to the funnels) instead of coming up through the centre of the ship's width, were divided in two and came up {{on opposite sides of the}} ship's centre line.

They retained the fuel-efficient power plants of the Mahan-class destroyers, and thus had a slightly lower speed than the Gridleys.
