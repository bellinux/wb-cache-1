25|$|To {{clean the}} filter, water is passed quickly upward through the filter, {{opposite}} the normal direction (called backflushing or <b>backwashing)</b> to remove embedded or unwanted particles. Prior to this step, compressed air may be blown {{up through the}} bottom of the filter to break up the compacted filter media to aid the <b>backwashing</b> process; this is known as air scouring. This contaminated water can be disposed of, along with the sludge from the sedimentation basin, or it can be recycled by mixing with the raw water entering the plant although this is often considered poor practice since it re-introduces an elevated concentration of bacteria into the raw water.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{summarizes}} the preliminary {{results of a}} computer model. The model illustrates how <b>backwash</b> class determines biofilm retention {{and whether or not}} it is necessary to consider solids-loading effects. Model results indicate that: (1) In aggressively-washed filters, lower biofilm retention means that SRT and MCRT are nearly equivalent, making it necessary to increase <b>backwash</b> interval to achieve a MCRT capable of supporting a higher nitrification rate; (2) For the longer <b>backwash</b> intervals required by aggressively-washed filters, solids degradation with a concomitant increase in oxygen demand ultimately depresses nitrification; and (3) In gently-washed filters, higher biofilm retention establishes a partition between SRT and MCRT, permitting solids-degradation effects to be diminished with the proper <b>backwash</b> regimen. An appropriate <b>backwash</b> protocol will lead to a regimen that minimizes SRT within the constraints set by MCRT. For aggressively-washed filters, where MCRT and SRT are virtually equivalent, this means extending the <b>backwash</b> interval until the internal loading attenuates nitrification. In gently-washed filters, where MCRT is independent of SRT, <b>backwash</b> protocol will consist of decreasing the <b>backwash</b> interval until nitrification is optimize...|$|R

50|$|Swash {{consists}} of two phases: uprush (onshore flow) and <b>backwash</b> (offshore flow). Generally uprush velocities are greater but of shorter duration compared to the <b>backwash.</b> Onshore velocities are at greatest {{at the start of}} the uprush and then decrease, whereas offshore velocities increase towards the end of the <b>backwash.</b> The direction of the uprush varies with the prevailing wind, whereas the <b>backwash</b> is always perpendicular to the coastline. This asymmetrical motion of swash can cause longshore drift as well as cross-shore sediment transport.|$|R
50|$|<b>Backwashing</b> is an {{important}} operation employed to remove filtered solids as this build up causes resistance to filtration to increase with time. <b>Backwashing</b> involves inverting the direction of liquid flow while using clean liquid. This process is employed for times {{in the range of}} 5-15 minutes with typical flow rates per unit area in the range of 6.8- 13.6 L/m2.s. Most designs typically employ <b>backwashing</b> once per day of operation.The operation of depth filters is inherently cyclic due to the necessity of solids removal build up during the process, as such two or more units are typically used so that <b>backwashing</b> does not interfere with the filtration. Effective <b>backwashing</b> occurs when the filter medium is fluidized. Fluidization flow rates generally fall in the range of 20-50 gpm/ft2.|$|E
50|$|Filter {{media can}} be cleaned by rinsing with {{solvents}} or detergents.

40|$|The {{long-term}} {{performance of}} granular media filters used {{in drinking water}} treatment is ultimately limited by {{the efficiency of the}} <b>backwash</b> process. While a number of <b>backwash</b> studies have yielded important insights into the mechanisms involved in filter cleaning, none have {{led to the development of}} models which can predict what the actual <b>backwash</b> efficiency will be under a given set of conditions and how this will affect the filter in the long term. This paper describes an experimental investigation into the effect of <b>backwash</b> rate, type of coagulant, degree of clogging and accumulation of residual deposits (not removed by <b>backwash)</b> on the efficiency of fluidised bed filter <b>backwash</b> in laboratory scale filters treating a natural raw water coagulated with either alum or a cationic polymer blend. Small variations in the raw water characteristics (manifested as variations in raw water turbidity, temperature, pH, rate of headloss development and turbidity removal efficiency) within each set of experiments appeared to affect the efficiency of <b>backwash</b> in addition to the parameters varied deliberately. Stepwise linear regression and statistical analysis of model significance were used to determine which of several possible filtration and <b>backwash</b> parameters were the best predictors of <b>backwash</b> performance. <b>Backwash</b> rate, filter run time, rate of headloss development and mass of residual deposits accumulated during previous runs were found to be the best predictors of <b>backwash</b> efficiency for any given filter cycle. Floc deposits appeared to become more difficult to remove the longer they remained in the filter, while rate of headloss development appeared to provide some indication of floc adhesiveness for filter runs of similar length. The efficiency of detachment of freshly deposited floc appeared to increase as the mass of residual deposits and mudballs in the filter increased...|$|R

5000|$|As a water {{conservation}} measure, many water purification plants recycle filter <b>backwash</b> water and other product streams from sludge treatment processes {{back to the}} beginning of the plant. On June 8, 2001, the USEPA released a final regulation governing acceptable practices for recycling <b>backwash</b> water. [...] The purpose of the regulation was to improve the control of microbial contaminants such as Cryptosporidium by reducing the potential for recycled product streams to upset the removal efficiency of the main treatment processes. The regulation requires that spent filter <b>backwash</b> water be recycled to the front of the treatment plant so that all available particle removal treatment processes can be employed to remove the microbial and particulate material from the <b>backwash</b> water.|$|R
50|$|Spent <b>backwash</b> {{water is}} either {{discharged}} without treatment to a sanitary sewer system or is treated and recycled within the plant. Historically, <b>backwash</b> water was discharged directly to surface water supplies; however, direct discharge is now highly regulated through NPDES discharge permits {{and is often}} discouraged. Used <b>backwash</b> water contains high concentrations of particulate material. Typical treatment processes include coagulation, flocculation and sedimentation. High molecular weight synthetic organic polymers are sometimes added to facilitate the formation of settleable floc. Failure of a <b>backwash</b> treatment process and reintroduction of the resulting poor quality water into the main water purification plant flow stream can cause overall process upsets and result {{in the production of}} poor quality treated drinking water.|$|R

The evaluations were conducted after filtration processes performed using four filtration rates and three separate sand particle sizes (fine - 0. 55 mm; medium - 0. 77 mm, and coarse sand - 1. 04 mm diameter), repeated in three subsequent cycles. After reaching a fixed expansion of 25 % of the filter bed height, the <b>backwash</b> processes were performed for 15 min. <b>Backwash</b> cleaning efficiency was evaluated in all trials based on the mass of removed solids for different filter bed layers and throughout the entire filter bed.

50|$|To keep a {{sand filter}} working, {{depending}} on the size of the filter you must clean it as often as once a week.

A conventional operation in micro- and ultrafiltration is an in-line coagulation and a frequent hydraulic <b>backwash.</b> The idea about these frequent <b>backwashes</b> is to limit the accumulation of fouling on the membrane. But the cake layer of iron or alum flocks can also protect the membrane for pore blocking and a frequent <b>backwash</b> can expose the membrane for particles that cause pore blocking. The frequent <b>backwash</b> is also using a lot of permeate. In this way the net flux is lower than the actual flux and the recovery can be as low as 60 to 70 %. In this research it was hypothesized that this cake layer worked as a membrane protecting layer and was accumulating on the top of membrane by long filtration <b>backwash</b> intervals (> 6 hours).

40|$|AbstractAssessment is an {{important}} aspect of learning and teaching which enables students to progress to either higher grades of studies or seek for employment, it also helps the teachers to assess the effectiveness of their teaching methodology. Several academicians have emphasized that assessment has strong impact on all aspects of learning. According to Buck, <b>Backwash</b> is influence of examination on learning. We explored presence of <b>backwash</b> effect by questionnaire, rated on 6 point Likert scale with 10 items, in first year medical students and compared with their academic performances. The first year medical students were surveyed by newly developed and validated <b>backwash</b> questionnaire (BAQ) in this study. The questionnaire was based on qualitative studies on <b>backwash</b> effect. All students were categorised into three groups based on their previous exam scores. High achievers were defined as having cGPA of > 3. 5, medium achievers with cGPA ranges between 3. 5 to 3. 0 and low low achievers of cGPA < 3. 0. All three groups were evaluated for the presence of <b>backwash.</b> The first year MBBS students (n= 81) from a designated private medical university in Malaysia participated in this study. The male: female ratio was 1 : 1. High achievers were 39. 5 % (32 / 81), medium achievers 48. 1 % (39 / 81) and low achievers were 12. 3 % (10 / 81). <b>Backwash</b> was present in 46 % (38 / 81), highest in medium achievers 50 % (19 / 38), followed by high achievers 39 % (15 / 38), low achievers 10. 5 % (4 / 38). These results suggest that medium achievers are more prone to adopt learning strategies with the aim to pass assessments only. However, it is also interesting observation that high achievers also tend to have <b>backwash.</b> As far as low achievers are concerned, they have less <b>backwash</b> effect as observed in this study. The presence of negative effect of <b>Backwash</b> in high & medium achievers, suggests that assessment exert great impact on learning of medical students.
