After the county approved building permits in the Everglades, the land flooded as it had for centuries. When homeowners demanded the Army Corps of Engineers drain their neighborhoods, {{she was the only}} opposing voice. At the hearing in 1983, she was booed, jeered, and shouted at by the audience of residents. [...] "Can't you boo any louder than that?" [...] she chided, eventually making them laugh. [...] "Look. I'm an old lady. I've <b>been</b> <b>here</b> <b>since</b> eight o'clock. It's now eleven. I've got all night, and I'm used to the heat," [...] she told them. Later, she wrote, [...] "They're all good souls—they just shouldn't be out there." [...] Dade County commissioners eventually decided not to drain.|$|E

500|$|During {{the start}} of the 2010–11 season, Edwards was key in Accrington's strong {{defensive}} record, with the team conceding just one goal in their first seven league fixtures. In October 2010, Edwards scored his first and second goals of the season when he scored twice from the penalty spot in Accrington's 7–4 home win against Gillingham. He scored his third goal of the 2010–11 season in a 4–2 home defeat to Cheltenham Town, scoring a penalty in the 88th minute, only serving as a consolation with Accrington 4–1 down at the time. Three days later, on 2 November 2010, Edwards scored from the penalty spot again, this time in a 5–2 away defeat at eventual champions Chesterfield. His fifth goal of the season came courtesy of a 21st-minute penalty in a 1–1 draw at Bradford City, before he scored another goal at Morecambe in a 2–1 away win on 1 January 2011. A month later, on 1 February, Edwards scored yet again against Morecambe, this time in a 1–1 home draw, salvaging a point by scoring a late penalty. His eighth goal of the campaign came three weeks later, scoring a header from Charlie Barnett's cross in the 82nd minute to give Accrington a 2–1 away win at Wycombe, their first win in five league matches. Edwards took his goal tally into double figures when he scored two first-half penalties in a 3–0 home win against Stockport County on 8 March 2011. He missed a penalty in a 3–1 defeat at Gillingham four days later, before scoring three days later in a 3–1 home win against Burton Albion — scoring from six yards out following good work from Terry Gornell. He scored his twelfth goal of the season with an 82nd-minute penalty in a 3–1 win against Southend United on 5 April 2011, moving Accrington into the play-off places in League Two. Three days later, Edwards scored again from the penalty spot, scoring a 79th-minute penalty to give Accrington the lead against ten man Macclesfield Town, although a late goal courtesy of Vinny Mukendi earned Macclesfield a point. Accrington cemented a place in the League Two play-offs after finishing fifth, Edwards played in both of the semi-final matches against Stevenage, which Accrington lost by a 3–0 aggregate scoreline. Edwards scored a total of 13 goals from defence in 51 appearances during Accrington's 2010–11 campaign, finishing as Accrington's joint top goalscorer for the season alongside Terry Gornell and Sean McConville. He was offered a two-year contract extension {{at the end of the}} season. Accrington assistant manager Jimmy Bell stated [...] "Phil has been offered a good deal and we're quietly confident, although there have been a few rumours about one or two clubs being interested. But Phil has <b>been</b> <b>here</b> <b>since</b> he was young, he can't drive, he gets looked after by the club and he gets lifts in to training, so he feels quite settled here". Edwards played 257 games for Accrington, scoring 24 goals.|$|E
