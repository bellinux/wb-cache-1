40|$|A {{regenerative}} braking system and hydraulic braking system {{are used in}} conjunction {{in the majority of}} electric vehicles worldwide. We propose a new regenerative <b>braking</b> <b>distribution</b> strategy that is based on multi-input fuzzy control logic while considering the influences of the battery’s state of charge, the brake strength and the motor speed. To verify the braking performance and recovery economy, this strategy was applied to a battery electric vehicle model and compared with two other improved {{regenerative braking}} strategies. The performance simulation was performed using standard driving cycles (NEDC, LA 92, and JP 1015) and a real-world-based urban cycle in China. The tested braking strategies satisfied the general safety requirements of Europe (as specified in ECE- 13 H), and the emergency braking scenario and economic potential were tested. The simulation results demonstrated the differences in the braking force distribution performance of these three regenerative braking strategies, the feasibility of the braking methods for the proposed driving cycles and the energy economic potential of the three strategies...|$|E
40|$|The {{distribution}} of brake forces between {{front and rear}} axles of a vehicle is typically specified such that {{the same level of}} brake force coefficient is imposed at both front and rear wheels. This condition is known as ‘ideal’ distribution and it is required to deliver the maximum vehicle deceleration and minimum braking distance. For subcritical braking conditions, the deceleration demand may be delivered by different distributions between front and rear brak- ing forces. In this research we show how to obtain the optimal distribution which minimises the pitch angle of a vehicle and hence enhances driver subjective feel during braking. A vehi- cle model including suspension geometry features is adopted. The problem of the minimum pitch brake distribution for a varying deceleration level demand is solved by means of a model predictive control technique. To address the problem of the undesirable pitch rebound caused by a full-stop of the vehicle, a second controller is designed and implemented independently from the <b>braking</b> <b>distribution</b> in use. An extended Kalman filter is designed for state esti- mation and implemented in a high fidelity environment together with the model predictive control strategy. The proposed solution is compared with the reference ‘ideal’ distribution as well as another previous feed-forward solution...|$|E

50|$|Slidepad is an Intelligent <b>Brake</b> <b>Distribution</b> (IBD) technology, {{aimed at}} making braking easier for novice or casual cyclists, {{integrates}} into V-brake systems to provide single-lever braking. It modulates the front brake force in real time, {{based on the}} road surface and rider weight position, and avoids front wheel lockup accidents when applying the front brake. It was designed to prevent riders from flipping over their handlebars when applying the front brake. Once the brake pads {{make contact with the}} rear wheel, the Slidepad slides forward, which pulls a cable that is connected to the front brakes. Similar to the anti-lock brake system in cars, the mechanism prevents the front wheel from locking, no matter how hard the brake is pressed or how slippery the road conditions are.|$|R

50|$|The 2WD models {{feature the}} new Electronic <b>Braking</b> Force <b>Distribution</b> (EBD) system that uses {{electronic}} control to optimally distribute braking {{force to the}} front and rear wheels according to changes in the payload (number of passengers) being carried. This system works in tandem with the Braking Assist system (a brake booster with a two-stage mechanical assist mechanism plus ABS) to achieve synergies between effective utilization of front and rear braking force (EBD) and reduced pedal pressure (Braking Assist). As a result, more powerful braking performance is obtained with less pedal pressure in emergency braking situations even when carrying a large payload.
