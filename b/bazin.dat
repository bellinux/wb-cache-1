5|$|The {{assassination}} of Hanoi-based French labour recruiter Hervé <b>Bazin</b> on February 9, 1929, {{was a turning}} point that {{marked the beginning of the}} VNQDD's decline. A graduate of the École Coloniale in Paris, <b>Bazin</b> directed the recruitment of Vietnamese labourers to work on colonial plantations. Recruiting techniques often included beating or coercion, because the foremen who did the recruiting received a commission for each enlisted worker. On the plantations, living conditions were poor and the remuneration was low, leading to widespread indignation. In response, Vietnamese hatred of <b>Bazin</b> led to thoughts of an assassination. A group of workers approached the VNQDD with a proposal to kill <b>Bazin.</b> Học felt that assassinations were pointless because they would only prompt a crackdown by the French Sûreté, thereby weakening the party. He felt that it was better to strengthen the party until the time was ripe to overthrow the French, viewing <b>Bazin</b> as a mere twig on the tree of the colonial apparatus.|$|E
5|$|<b>Bazin</b> {{went on to}} co-found Cahiers du cinéma, whose {{contributors}} (including future film directors François Truffaut and Jean-Luc Godard) also {{praised the}} film. The popularity of Truffaut's auteur theory helped the film's and Welles's reputation.|$|E
5|$|Lashed together, Temeraire and Fougueux {{exchanged}} fire, Temeraire initially {{clearing the}} French ship's upper deck with small arms fire. The French rallied, but the greater {{height of the}} three-decked Temeraire compared to the two-decked Fougueux thwarted their attempts to board. Instead Harvey dispatched his own boarding party, led by First-Lieutenant Thomas Fortescue Kennedy, which entered Fougueux via her main deck ports and chains. The French tried to defend the decks port by port, but were steadily overwhelmed. Fougueuxs captain, Louis Alexis Baudoin, had suffered a fatal wound earlier in the fighting, leaving Commander François <b>Bazin</b> in charge. When he learned that {{nearly all of the}} officers were dead or wounded and that most of the guns were out of action, <b>Bazin</b> surrendered the ship to the boarders.|$|E
5|$|The {{world of}} Citizen Kane, that mysterious, dark, and {{infinitely}} deep world {{of space and}} memory where voices trail off into distant echoes and where meaning dissolves into interpretation, seemed to <b>Bazin</b> to mark the starting point from which all of us try to construct provisionally the sense of our lives.|$|E
5|$|While a {{critical}} success, Citizen Kane failed to recoup its costs {{at the box}} office. The film faded from view after its release but was subsequently returned to the public's attention when it was praised by such French critics as André <b>Bazin</b> and given an American revival in 1956. The film was released on Blu-ray on September 13, 2011, for a special 70th anniversary edition.|$|E
5|$|Turned {{down by the}} VNQDD leadership, one of the assassination's proponentsit {{is unclear}} {{whether or not he}} was a party membercreated his own plot. With an accomplice, he shot and killed <b>Bazin</b> on February 9, 1929, as the Frenchman left his mistress's house. The French {{attributed}} the attack to the VNQDD and reacted by apprehending all the party members they could find: between three and four hundred men were rounded up, including 36government clerks, 13French government officials, 36schoolteachers, 39merchants, 37landowners and 40military personnel. The subsequent trials resulted in 78men being convicted and sentenced to jail terms ranging between five and twenty years. The arrests severely depleted the VNQDD leadership: most of the Central Committee were captured, though Học and Nhu were among the few who escaped from a raid on their hideout at the Vietnam Hotel.|$|E
5|$|Perturbed {{by those}} who betrayed fellow members to the French and the {{problems}} this behaviour caused, Học convened a meeting to tighten regulations in mid-1929 at the village of Lac Dao, along the Gia Lam–Haiphong railway. This was also the occasion for a shift in strategy: Học argued for a general uprising, citing rising discontent among Vietnamese soldiers in the colonial army. More moderate party leaders believed this move to be premature, and cautioned against it, but Học's stature meant he prevailed in shifting the party's orientation towards violent struggle. One of the arguments presented for large-scale violence was that the French response to the <b>Bazin</b> assassination meant that the party's strength could decline in the long term. The plan was to provoke a series of uprisings at military posts around the Red River Delta in early 1930, where VNQDD forces would join Vietnamese soldiers in {{an attack on the}} two major northern cities of Hanoi and Haiphong. The leaders agreed to restrict their uprisings to Tonkin, because the party was weak elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|Vietnam had {{gradually}} {{become a}} French colony between 1859 and 1883. The first phase started in 1859, when French and Spanish] forces began {{an invasion of}} southern Vietnam, leading to the ceding of three southern provinces to form the colony of Cochinchina under the Treaty of Saigon in 1864. In 1867, the French seized three further provinces and by 1883, the process was complete, when northern and central Vietnam were conquered and made into the French protectorates of Tonkin and Annam and incorporated into French Indochina. Initially, military resistance to French rule came through the Cần Vương movement led by Tôn Thất Thuyết and Phan Đình Phùng, which sought to install the boy Emperor Hàm Nghi {{at the head of}} an independent nation. However, with the death of Phùng in 1895, military opposition effectively ended. The only other notable incidents after this came in 1917 with the Thái Nguyên uprising. The lack of militant activity changed in the late 1920s with the formation of the VNQDĐ, or Vietnamese Nationalist Party. The party began to generate attention among French colonial authorities and was blamed for the assassination of <b>Bazin</b> on 9 February 1929, a French labour recruiter despised among the populace, leading to a heavy French crackdown. The French purges caused considerable detriment to the independence movement in general and the VNQDĐ in particular. Nearly 1000 VNQDĐ members were arrested; the demolition of many of the Party's facilities ensued. The VNQDĐ decided to abandon its clandestine philosophy and engage in open attacks against the French, hoping to foment a general uprising among the people. Since the VNQDĐ was only strong in the northern areas of Vietnam, the attacks were to be staged in the Red River Delta, and the garrison at Yen Bay was identified as a key point. The French authorities used Vietnamese soldiers and VNQDĐ members were among the garrison at Yen Bay; they engaged in cajoling their colleagues with revolutionary rhetoric.|$|E
25|$|After {{starting}} his own film club in 1948, Truffaut met André <b>Bazin,</b> {{who would have}} great effect on his professional and personal life. <b>Bazin</b> was a critic {{and the head of}} another film society at the time. He became a personal friend of Truffaut's and helped him out of various financial and criminal situations during his formative years.|$|E
25|$|In 1925 {{he formed}} a {{partnership}} with Léon <b>Bazin</b> that lasted until 1936.|$|E

25|$|Benghazi {{is home to}} many {{distinctive}} {{dishes that}} can be prepared in the home. <b>Bazin</b> {{is one of the}} most well known of these dishes. <b>Bazin</b> is a dish consisting of a small loaf of heated dough and a meat or vegetable sauce. The dough can be ripped into bite-sized pieces and dipped into the sauce. This dish uses essential ingredients such as garlic and oil. Other dishes like Couscous are more well known around the world and adopted by other cultures. One common dessert that can be found in Benghazi is deep fried dates. These are often served with milk.|$|E
25|$|Armand de Lafourcade, Seigneur du Pin, son of Philippe de Lafourcade, Seigneur de la Prade, was {{reconfirmed}} in his nobility on 20 June 1696, {{by order}} of Claude <b>Bazin</b> de Bezons, the Intendant of Guyenne in Bordeaux, Pellot's successor.|$|E
25|$|Libyan cuisine derives {{much from}} the traditions of Mediterranean, North African, and Berber cuisines. One {{of the most popular}} Libyan dishes is <b>Bazin,</b> an unleavened bread {{prepared}} with barley, water and salt. <b>Bazin</b> is prepared by boiling barley flour in water and then beating it to create a dough using a magraf, which is a unique stick designed for this purpose. Pork consumption is forbidden, in accordance with Sharia, the religious laws of Islam. Tripoli is Libya's capital, and the cuisine is particularly influenced by Italian cuisine. Pasta is common, and many seafood dishes are available. Southern Libyan cuisine is more traditionally Arab and Berber. Common fruits and vegetables include figs, dates, oranges, apricots and olives.|$|E
25|$|Bouquet {{created a}} {{painting}} named Souvenir du Musée des Colonies that depicts {{the men who}} worked on the pavilion: Laprade and <b>Bazin,</b> Janniot, Bouquet and Ruhlmann.

25|$|Gyula Németh, {{following}} Zoltán Gombocz, derived Xazar from {{a hypothetical}} *Qasar reflecting a Turkic root qaz- ("to ramble, to roam") being an hypothetical velar variant of Common Turkic kez-. In the fragmentary Tes and Terkhin inscriptions of the Uyğur empire (744–840) the form 'Qasar' is attested, though uncertainty remains whether {{this represents a}} personal or tribal name, gradually other hypotheses emerged. Louis <b>Bazin</b> derived it from Turkic qas- ("tyrannize, oppress, terrorize") {{on the basis of}} its phonetic similarity to the Uyğur tribal name, Qasar. András Róna-Tas connects it with Kesar, the Pahlavi transcription of the Roman title Caesar.|$|E

25|$|Villate {{travelled}} to France {{with the}} purpose to continue his music studies in the Paris Conservatory, where he received classes from François <b>Bazin,</b> Victorien de Joncieres and Adolphe Danhauser. He composed numerous instrumental pieces such as contradanzas, habaneras, romances and waltzes, and in 1877 he premiered with great audience acclaim his opera Zilia in Paris, which was presented in Havana in 1881. Since then, Villate focused his efforts mainly in opera and composed pieces such as La Zarina and Baltazar, premiered at La Haya and Teatro Real de Madrid respectively. It is known that he worked on an opera with a Cuban theme called Cristóbal Colón, but its manuscript has been lost.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} 9 September 1666 order reconfirming Philippe de Lafourcade, Seigneur de la Prade {{and this}} 20 June 1696 order {{would not stop}} Armand from being the target of further persecution by Mr. de la Cour de Beauval, subdelegate of Claude <b>Bazin</b> de Bezons, who alleged that the two orders had been obtained as favors, because the family could not furnish their original letters patent to support their claim of nobility. As a result, Armand was forced to turn to King Louis XIV of France, from whom, in March 1700, he obtained original letters patent. This was widely reported in the Nouveau d'Hozier, who also made the observation that these letters patent resembled more an ennoblement than a confirmation.|$|E
25|$|<b>Bazin</b> is {{a common}} Libyan food made with wheat flour and a little plain flour, which is boiled in salted water to make a hard dough, and then formed into a rounded, smooth dome placed {{in the middle of}} the dish. The sauce around the dough is made by frying chopped onions with lamb meat, turmeric, salt, cayenne pepper, black pepper, fenugreek, sweet paprika, and tomato paste. Potatoes can also be added. Finally, eggs are boiled and {{arranged}} around the dome. The dish is then served with lemon and fresh or pickled chili peppers, known as amsyar. Batata mubattana (filled potato) is another popular dish that consists of fried potato pieces filled with spiced minced meat and covered with egg and breadcrumbs.|$|E
25|$|This {{branch of}} the family was {{maintained}} in their nobility by judgments dated 3 September 1666, by Mr. Dupuy (or du Puy), subdelegate of Claude Pellot, Intendant of Guyenne in Bordeaux, 20 June 1696 by Claude <b>Bazin</b> de Bezons, also the Intendant of Guyenne in Bordeaux, and, lastly by a judgment of the Conseil d'État rendered 29 June 1787 {{in the presence of}} the King. These three judgments leave no doubt about the origins of the branch, in that the family's nobility and filiation was legally established going back to Jean de Forcade, who was qualified as noble, Squire and Governor of the Château d'Auvillar in his marriage contract dated 29 April 1554. The 3 September 1666 judgment further confirms that Philippe de La Forcade, sieur de La Prade, was a squire, a captain in the infantry, that his father had been one of the Henry IV of France's bodyguards, that his grandfather had been Governor of the Château d'Auvillar and that they descended from the noble house of Forcade in Orthez, in Béarn.|$|E
500|$|French {{film critic}} André <b>Bazin</b> defended {{the film and}} wrote that [...] "In this respect, the {{accusation}} of plagiarism {{could very well be}} extended to the film's use of panchromatic film or its exploitation of the properties of gelatinous silver halide." [...] <b>Bazin</b> disagreed with Sadoul's comparison to Lumière's cinematography since Citizen Kane used more sophisticated lenses, but acknowledged that the film had similarities to such previous works as The 49th Parallel and The Power and the Glory. <b>Bazin</b> stated that [...] "even if Welles did not invent the cinematic devices employed in Citizen Kane, one should nevertheless credit him with the invention of their meaning." [...] <b>Bazin</b> championed the techniques in the film for its depiction of heightened reality, but Bordwell believes that the film's use of special effects contradict some of Bazin's theories.|$|E
500|$|In his 1950 essay [...] "The Evolution of the Language of Cinema", <b>Bazin</b> placed Citizen Kane {{center stage}} {{as a work}} which ushered in a new period in cinema. One of the first critics to defend motion {{pictures}} as being on the same artistic level as literature or painting, <b>Bazin</b> often used the film {{as an example of}} cinema as an art form and wrote that [...] "Welles has given the cinema a theoretical restoration. He has enriched his filmic repertory with new or forgotten effects that, in today's artistic context, take on a significance we didn't know they could have." [...] <b>Bazin</b> also compared the film to Roberto Rossellini's Paisà for having [...] "the same aesthetic concept of realism" [...] and to the films of William Wyler shot by Toland (such as The Little Foxes and The Best Years of Our Lives), all of which used deep focus cinematography that <b>Bazin</b> called [...] "a dialectical step forward in film language." ...|$|E
500|$|André <b>Bazin,</b> {{a little-known}} film critic working for Sartre's Les Temps modernes, {{was asked to}} give an impromptu speech about the film after a {{screening}} at the Colisée Theatre {{in the autumn of}} 1946 and changed the opinion of much of the audience. This speech led to Bazin's 1947 article [...] "The Technique of Citizen Kane", which directly influenced public opinion about the film. Carringer wrote that <b>Bazin</b> was [...] "the one who did the most to enhance the film's reputation." [...] Both Bazin's critique of the film and his theories about cinema itself centered around his strong belief in mise en scène. These theories were diametrically opposed to both the popular Soviet montage theory and the politically Marxist and anti-Hollywood beliefs of most French film critics at that time. <b>Bazin</b> believed that a film should depict reality without the filmmaker imposing their [...] "will" [...] on the spectator, which the Soviet theory supported. <b>Bazin</b> wrote that Citizen Kanes mise en scène created a [...] "new conception of filmmaking" [...] and that the freedom given to the audience from the deep focus shots was innovative by changing the entire concept of the cinematic image. <b>Bazin</b> wrote extensively about the mise en scène in the scene where Susan Alexander attempts suicide, which was one long take while other films would have used four or five shots in the scene. <b>Bazin</b> wrote that the film's mise en scène [...] "forces the spectator to participate in the meaning of the film" [...] and creates [...] "a psychological realism which brings the spectator back to the real conditions of perception." ...|$|E

500|$|Bazin's {{praise of}} the film went beyond film theory and {{reflected}} his own philosophy towards life itself. His metaphysical interpretations about the film reflected humankind's place in the universe. <b>Bazin</b> believed that the film examined one person's identity and search for meaning.

500|$|From 1928, the VNQDD {{attracted}} attention {{through its}} assassinations of French officials and Vietnamese collaborators. A turning point [...] came in February 1929 with the <b>Bazin</b> assassination, {{the killing of}} a French labour recruiter widely despised by local Vietnamese people. Although the perpetrators' precise affiliation was unclear, the French colonial authorities held the VNQDD responsible. Between 300 and 400 of the party's approximately 1,500 members were detained in the resulting crackdown. Many of the leaders were arrested, but Học managed to escape.|$|E
