5|$|It's {{really a}} dance-off between a more {{sophisticated}} 'in-fashion' Destiny's Child versus a more 'street' Destiny's Child. And in the end a third Destiny's Child even more fierce takes over. It's {{a lot of hard}} work for us <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> to learn three routines for the same song. People will be shocked because it's different for us. They've never seen us really dance.|$|E
25|$|Thus {{the volume}} is {{four times that}} of a regular {{tetrahedron}} with the same edge length, while the surface area is twice (<b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> 8 rather than 4 triangles).|$|E
25|$|This {{discussion}} {{is not a}} full explanation of Benford's law, <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> not explained why we so often come across data-sets that, when plotted as a probability distribution of the logarithm of the variable, are relatively uniform over several orders of magnitude.|$|E
5000|$|In 2011, Lee said, [...] "People thought <b>we</b> <b>had</b> some {{political}} agenda, <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> {{a lot of}} female characters. Now it's not unusual." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{cool thing}} {{about using the}} Myth II engine from day one is that <b>we</b> already <b>had</b> a {{solution}} for {{how we were going}} to make levels. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> the level designers immediately start cranking out levels. <b>Because</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> Tiki, and access to that, our modelers immediately started making 3D Studio Max models. <b>Because</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> all of these key components in place starting out, we were able to start asset production, and that's how I think we'll be able to ship a literally one-year project.|$|R
5000|$|... "We didn't {{know what}} to expect <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> never seen Indiana. The only {{scouting}} report <b>we</b> <b>had</b> was a letter from a KU alumnus back there Indiana." ...|$|R
25|$|I {{think that}} in some quarters, {{many parts of the}} country, a white male is really disadvantaged… <b>Because</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> {{developed}} this notion of women and minorities being so disadvantaged and we have to help them, that we have, in many cases, twisted the thing so that it's no longer a case of equal opportunity. It's a case of putting a fist on the scale.|$|E
25|$|The most general {{interpretation}} of entropy is {{as a measure}} of our uncertainty about a system. The equilibrium state of a system maximizes the entropy <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> lost all information about the initial conditions except for the conserved variables; maximizing the entropy maximizes our ignorance about the details of the system. This uncertainty is not of the everyday subjective kind, but rather the uncertainty inherent to the experimental method and interpretative model.|$|E
25|$|Model A on {{the left}} shows the raw {{variance}} in height. This is useful as it preserves the absolute effects of genes and environments, and expresses these in natural units, such as mm of height change. Sometimes {{it is helpful to}} standardize the parameters, so each is expressed as percentage of total variance. <b>Because</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> decomposed variance into A, C, and E, the total variance is simply A + C + E. We can then scale each of the single parameters as a proportion of this total, i.e., Standardised–A = A/(A + C + E). Heritability is the standardised genetic effect.|$|E
5000|$|Nobody {{wanted to}} play with us <b>because</b> <b>we</b> did all kinds of strange things...feedbacks and overtones and sounds and rhythms. No drummer {{wanted to work with}} us <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> these {{electronic}} gadgets.|$|R
60|$|Jerry was {{thoroughly}} astonished, after I had told my story, <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> had such plain sailing {{when there was}} nothing to start us on a course for the missing comrade. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> gone out blindly, and by sheer accident ran upon our man without trouble or delay.|$|R
60|$|Meantime, our one-screw tub thumped gingerly toward Port Said, <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> no mails aboard, and the Mediterranean, {{exhausted}} after severe February hysterics, lay {{out like}} oil.|$|R
25|$|Little {{is known}} about Paulus' life. He lived in Alexandria, {{one of the most}} {{scholarly}} cities of the Roman world, where astrology was also at its most sophisticated. In his lifetime, Rome's power was declining and the capital of the Roman Empire had been moved to Constantinople. We know he was regarded as a considerable authority <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> the record of a series of lectures given on his work by the respected Neo-Platonist philosopher Olympiodorus some two centuries later (in 564 AD), in Alexandria. These lectures were preserved in a Commentary and both Paulus' Introduction and Olympiodorus' Commentary have been translated together, giving a view of the development of astrological technique and contemporary attitudes towards astrology from the tumultuous late Empire through the even more unstable early Byzantine Empire.|$|E
25|$|Religion, Unger argues, is {{a vision}} of the world within which we anchor our {{orientation}} to life. It is within this orientation that we deal with our greatest terrors and highest hopes. Because we are doomed to die, we hope for eternal life; because we are unable to grasp to totality of existence or of the universe, we try to dispel the mystery and provide a comprehensible explanation; <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> an insatiable desire, we cry for an object that is worthy of this desire, one that is infinite. Humans initially invested religious discourse in nature and the human susceptibility to nature. But as societies evolved and people developed ways to cope with the unpredictability of nature, the emphasis of religion shifted to social existence and its defects. A new moment in religion will begin, Unger argues, when we stop telling ourselves that all will be fine and we begin to face the incorrigible flaws in human existence. The future of religion lies in embracing our mortality and our groundlessness.|$|E
25|$|In theory, either {{high enough}} energy {{concentrations}} or random chance could trigger the tunneling needed to set this event in motion. However an immense number of ultra-high energy particles and events {{have occurred in}} the history of our universe, dwarfing by many orders of magnitude any events at human disposal. Hut and Rees note that, <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> observed cosmic ray collisions at much higher energies than those produced in terrestrial particle accelerators, these experiments should not, at least for the foreseeable future, pose a threat to our current vacuum. Particle accelerators have reached energies of only approximately eight tera electron volts (8×1012 eV). Cosmic ray collisions have been observed at and beyond energies of 1018 eV, a million times more powerful– the so-called Greisen–Zatsepin–Kuzmin limit – and other cosmic events may be more powerful yet. Against this, John Leslie has argued that if present trends continue, particle accelerators will exceed the energy given off in naturally occurring cosmic ray collisions by the year 2150. Fears of this kind were raised by critics of both the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider and the Large Hadron Collider at the time of their respective proposal, and determined to be unfounded by scientific inquiry.|$|E
60|$|What is {{commonly}} called cheapness of labour, signifies, therefore, in reality, that many obstacles {{have to be}} overcome by it; so that much labour is required to produce a small result. But this should never be spoken of as cheapness of labour, but as dearness of the object wrought for. It {{would be just as}} rational to say that walking was cheap, <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> ten miles to walk home to our dinner, as that labour was cheap, <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> to work ten hours to earn it.|$|R
6000|$|... "And are you willin' to hold enmity simply <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> {{a bit of}} a {{scrimmage}} over {{differences of}} opinion? I thought all that was settled on the spot." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why I {{mentioned}} Mr. Smethurst," [...] she said, [...] "it was <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> {{been talking}} of Ogden. Don't {{you think his}} treatment would be just what Ogden needs?" ...|$|R
500|$|Since the October reports, {{analysis}} of the satellite data has continued to be refined. In March2015, ATSB Chief Commissioner Mark Dolan remarked that he is [...] "slightly more optimistic than six months ago, <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> more confidence in the data".|$|E
500|$|Soon {{after the}} collapse, the owners {{arrived at the}} mall. A {{representative}} spoke {{on behalf of the}} owner, stating [...] "I'd rather not , <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> talked to our lawyers and we’re {{going to be in the}} City Hall to represent ourselves. But nevertheless, we are very much concerned [...] this accident." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{restaurant}} {{was awarded a}} Michelin star for 2012. The list was announced in October 2011, only seven months after the restaurant opened. Borie said [...] "I am very surprised, but it is teamwork obviously, we didn't really expect anything <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> been in business for such {{a small amount of}} time." [...] Following the star, Borie increased the number of kitchen staff from three to six.|$|E

5000|$|.....This {{could not}} be {{achieved}} with iron, and <b>we</b> <b>had</b> to choose a new material...light-weight metal. But not only the choice of iron had resulted in high weight. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> built too heavy <b>because</b> <b>we</b> wanted a safe aircraft and partially <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> not extracted the optimum structural strength from the material".|$|R
5000|$|NATO and Russia {{disagreed}} over Kosovo and {{no consensus}} was reached. Jaap de Hoop Scheffer said that ”The debate on Kosovo should continue <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> {{a round of}} different opinions".|$|R
500|$|In the downhill, Guèye {{finished}} his {{run with a}} time of 1:59.64, in 45th place. He registered times of 1:42.63 and 1:46.04 in the giant slalom, finishing in 57th place. He later said that [...] "We have no word for downhill in Senegalese <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> no mountains. I was so afraid I almost threw up. I have fully tested the safety measures and can tell you that they work." ...|$|E
500|$|On December 8, 2008, {{after the}} Longhorns learned {{they had been}} passed over for the {{national}} championship game, McCoy said {{he would return to}} the team for his senior year. McCoy indicated he wanted to play for a national championship. He also said, [...] "I’m coming back <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> a solid coaching staff, and I’m coming back because I feel like I can develop the young receivers we have." ...|$|E
500|$|Executive {{producer}} David Alpert said in 2014 {{that the}} original comics have given them enough ideas for Rick Grimes and company {{over the next seven}} years. [...] "I happen to love working from source material, specifically <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> {{a pretty good idea of}} what Season 10 is gonna be", Alpert said. [...] "We know where seasons 11 and 12 ... we have benchmarks and milestones for those seasons if we're lucky enough to get there." ...|$|E
60|$|That, also, {{was as far}} as Dick Four could get, <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> to {{sing the}} old song through twice, again and once more, and subsequently, in order to repeat it.|$|R
6000|$|... "What, then?" [...] she cried. [...] "Is he not safer with me than you? How about Henri--Henri {{who came}} over here <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> been deceived, he and I,--poor Henri who died?" ...|$|R
5000|$|... "It {{was kind}} of disappointing (when Britney hurt her knee) <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> this whole media hype behind the tour. It would have worked really well for a lead up for my album." ...|$|R
500|$|In 2012, he rebutted two longstanding rumors: {{one that}} he {{appeared}} as a soldier on a train in Biloxi Blues (1988), saying, [...] "No. I don't know why that's on IMDb, but I never was in that", and the other that he is related to dancer Lacey Schwimmer, saying, [...] "No, not at all. Please set the record straight. I guess it's a natural assumption <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> the same last name, but no. I've never even met her".|$|E
500|$|Oppong {{has seven}} siblings, three sisters and four brothers, ranging from {{about eight years}} older than him to {{approximately}} 15 years younger than him. From youngest to oldest, they are Edwin, Edward, Kevin, Kojo, Nanayaa, Nana, and Olivia. Papa said, [...] "I call my house the zoo <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> so many people living there. There's always something to do... somebody's always home. It's not just my immediate family, we always have people coming through our house. My house is very lively, I like it." ...|$|E
500|$|Upon {{hearing that}} the answer was still [...] "No" [...] over 1000 {{frustrated}} Lafayette students marched to the Centre Square in downtown Easton and held a protest rally against racial intolerance. [...] A number of students rushed to the local Western Union office to wire the news of their protests to prominent individuals to denounce the Sun Bowl Committee's refusal to include Showell. One of the recipients was President Truman. The telegram to Truman read: “Denied Sun Bowl game <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> a Negro on our team. Is that democracy?", signed by the Lafayette College students. Other telegrams were sent to Walter Winchell to join the cause.|$|E
6000|$|There {{was little}} need he should ask whether <b>we</b> <b>had</b> been {{successful}} in our search, <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> returned as <b>we</b> departed; but I could not refrain from acquainting him with our ill fortune by saying in a sorrowful tone: ...|$|R
3000|$|ST 7 : The {{role play}} was cool, really interactive. It was {{especially}} useful <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> to apply what we’d already learned {{to communicate with}} our mates, which was a good laugh! [...]...|$|R
