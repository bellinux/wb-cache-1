2500|$|Tevez {{is known}} for his tango flare goal {{celebrations}} ever since playing for Boca Juniors, as well with Corinthians of Brazil. During his time at Manchester United, he would hide a baby's dummy in his shorts and put it in his mouth after scoring a goal as a commemorative gesture to his baby daughter. After his move to Manchester City, Tevez often performed a dance where he puts his hands together, <b>bends</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> rocks his body; this dance has been named after him as the [...] "Tevez Dance".|$|E
2500|$|Star-like waxy {{flowers are}} {{produced}} on [...] inflorescences {{arising from the}} stem from June to September in the wild with most flowers wilting by August. When cultivated in Europe however, the plant flowers between December and January. This flowering habit is what lends the orchid several of its common names, such as [...] "Comet orchid" [...] due {{to the shape of}} its flower and [...] "Christmas orchid" [...] due to the timing of its flowering. Each flower opens up with a green coloration, but eventually turns white with tones of light green. The amount of green in each flower can vary from plant to plant. It is claimed that the age-dependent color change is more pronounced in wild A.sesquipedale than in greenhouse-grown plants. The sepals tend to stay green for a longer time than the petals. As the flower ages further it goes from white to yellowish and then from orange to brown as it begins to wilt. As the wilting progresses the dorsal sepal <b>bends</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> then the lateral sepals bend inward with the lip remaining fairly stationary. Finally the entire flower closes in on itself. A distinctive feature of the flowers is that they have a long green spur attached. The spur of the flower is [...] from its tip to the tip of the flower's lip. The specific epithet sesquipedale is Latin for [...] "one-and-a-half-feet-long," [...] referring to the distance between the end of the spur and {{the very top of the}} dorsal sepal. At the end of the spur is a small amount of nectar usually about 40–300µl in volume. In general, longer spurs tend to have greater concentrations of nectar. This nectar fills the spur up to within [...] from the bottom of the spur. The nectar has been found to contain the sugars fructose, sucrose, glucose, and raffinose. The flowers produce an extremely intense spicy scent that can easily fill a room; this fragrance is only present during the night and is reminiscent of lily and some nocturnally flowering Nicotiana species. The scent has been found to be composed of approximately 39 different chemical constituents with its greatest concentration consisting of isovaleraldoxime, methyl benzoate, benzyl alcohol, isovaleronitrile, benzyl benzoate, phenylethyl alcohol, isovaleraldehyde, and phenylacetaldoxime. Usually 1 to 5 flowers are produced at a time.|$|E

60|$|MURRAY. And I {{can send}} them out right away. They're all typed, thanks to you. That's what's brought me luck, I know. I {{never had a}} bit by myself. (Then, after a quick glance {{around to make sure}} they are alone, he <b>bends</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> kisses her.) There! A token of gratitude--even if it is against the rules.|$|E
6000|$|EILEEN. I know--you like {{me a lot}} even if you can't love me--don't you? (His arms tighten {{about her}} as he <b>bends</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> forces a kiss on her lips again.) Oh, Stephen! That was for good-bye. You mustn't come to-morrow morning. I couldn't bear having you--with people watching. But you'll write after--often--won't you? (Heart-brokenly.) Oh, please do that, Stephen! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't {{you like}} your boots, Private Montmorency? Oh, I beg your pardon. I thought from {{the way you were}} <b>bending</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> looking at them that perhaps their {{appearance}} was dissatisfying to you. My mistake.|$|R

60|$|The courtier was <b>bending</b> <b>down,</b> <b>and</b> by the {{creaking}} sound that reached him Ercole guessed his occupation {{to be the}} winding of the arbalest string. On the table at his side lay a quarrel swathed in a sheet of paper.|$|R
60|$|You know I don't. I adore you. It'll {{kill me if}} you go. [He <b>bends</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> passionately {{kisses her}} hand.] Ronny, Ronny, don't! What are you doing? [She tears her hand away. She is {{trembling}} with emotion. He is white and cold with passion. They sit opposite one another {{for a while in}} silence.] What a punishment! When you told me this afternoon that you loved me I thought I'd never been happy in my life before, and though it tore my heart to think that you must go I felt--oh, I don't know--as though my joy was so overwhelming, there was no room in my heart for anything else. And now I'm wretched, wretched.|$|E
6000|$|YANK--[With a jerk of {{his head}} back on his shoulders, {{as if he had}} {{received}} a punch full in the face--raging.] I see yuh, all in white! I see yuh, yuh white-faced tart, yuh! Hairy ape, huh? I'll hairy ape yuh! [He <b>bends</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> grips at the street curbing as if to pluck it out and hurl it. Foiled in this, snarling with passion, he leaps to the lamp-post on the corner and tries to pull it up for a club. Just at that moment a bus is heard rumbling up. A fat, high-hatted, spatted gentleman runs out from the side street. He calls out plaintively: [...] "Bus! Bus! Stop there!" [...] and runs full tilt into the bending, straining YANK, who is bowled off his balance.] ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Well, sir, you are {{lighter and}} more active than I am, and I was {{thinking}} that {{if you could get}} {{up to the top of}} this tree you would have a view down over the village. The leaves are pretty thick, and as the niggers are busy there is not much chance of their looking about for a man up a tree. You see the village ain’t above a hundred and fifty yards away, and the ground ain’t more than twenty feet above the river. I should say that this tree was seventy or eighty feet high, so that from the top you can get a view pretty well over the place; if there is one of our chaps there he may be lying tied up somewhere. Of course he might be in a hut, but it is much more likely that they would have just chucked him down until they wanted him. I think if you got on my shoulder you would be able to get hold of that lowest branch where it <b>bends</b> <b>down,</b> <b>and</b> climb along it to the trunk; after that the branches come pretty thick together.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I greet you also, my son," [...] she answered, <b>bending</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> kissing {{me on the}} brow, [...] "who {{have been}} in far lands and passed so many dangers. I greet you and thank the {{guardian}} gods who have brought you safe home again. Rise, my son." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not he. I shouldn't {{say that}} he was very badly hurt either," [...] the Englishman declared, <b>bending</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> {{listening}} to his breathing. [...] "More frightened than anything. He'll get up and be off directly we leave. You will let me see you home?" [...] he continued, speaking to Adrienne.|$|R

6000|$|The bucket is tipped {{into the}} furnace with a thunderous roar and the slag below pours forth more quickly. [...] "An engine," [...] says Experience, reflectively, [...] "can run over herself so to say. After she's broken up she is made into {{sleepers}} for the line. You'll see how she's broken up later." [...] A few paces further on, semi-nude demons are capering over strips of glowing hot iron which {{are put into}} a mill as rails and emerge as thin, shapely tie-bars. The natives wear rough sandals and some pretence of aprons, but {{the greater part of}} them is [...] "all face." [...] "As I said before," [...] says Experience, [...] "a native's cuteness when he's working on ticket is something startling. Beyond occasionally hanging on to a red-hot bar too long and so letting their pincers be drawn through the mills, these men take precious good care not to go wrong. Our machinery is fenced and guard-railed as much as possible, and these men don't get caught up by the belting. In the first place, they're careful--the father warns the son and so on--and in the second, there's nothing about 'em for the belting to catch on unless the man shoves his hand in. Oh, a native's no fool! He knows that it doesn't do to be foolish when he's dealing with a crane or a driving-wheel. You're looking at all those chopped rails? We make our iron as they blend baccy. We mix up all sorts to get the required quality. Those rails have just been chopped by this tobacco-cutter thing." [...] Experience <b>bends</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> sets a vicious-looking, parrot-headed beam to work. There is a quiver--a snap--and a dull smash and a heavy rail is nipped in two like a stick of barley-sugar.|$|E

6000|$|The priest {{spoke the}} {{beautiful}} commendation, [...] "Depart, O Christian soul." [...] There was a faint gesture {{in the midst}} for Christina to lift her in her arms--a sign to <b>bend</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> kiss her brow--but her last look was for her brother, her last murmur, [...] "Come after me; be the Good Baron Ebbo." ...|$|R
60|$|The Princess smiled graciously. It was {{bad enough}} to be ignored, as she {{certainly}} was to some extent, {{but on the other}} hand it was good for De Brensault to see Jeanne held in such esteem. She took his arm <b>and</b> they followed <b>down</b> the room. The Duke was <b>bending</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> talking earnestly to Jeanne; this surprised the Princess.|$|R
60|$|Robin Slidder {{faithfully}} and earnestly pledged himself.
