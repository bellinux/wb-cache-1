In January 2005, an Air Canada <b>baggage</b> <b>handler</b> in Montreal stole Crosby's red Canada jersey {{from the}} World Junior Hockey Championship. It was {{recovered}} later in a mailbox. His white jersey from the tournament was temporarily delisted from an auction while the red one was missing. It eventually sold for $22,100, which went to youth hockey charities and 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake relief.|$|E
5|$|IndiGo {{became one}} of the fastest growing low cost {{carriers}} in the world and was the largest profitable airline in India. The success of IndiGo has been attributed to its unique business model which reduces costs. The airline operates a single type of aircraft (Airbus A320) in similar seating configuration which simplifies crew training and maintenance. The airline strikes bulk deals with Airbus reducing unit costs. The airline targets a quick turn-around time of 20 minutes to get the aircraft ready for the next flight, ensuring planes fly about 12 hours every day. With this it has created an Indian record of more than 900 flights a day. Employees share multiple roles with a check-in staff doubling as a <b>baggage</b> <b>handler.</b>|$|E

25|$|The role of {{the sofa}} in Malian warfare changed {{dramatically}} after the reign of Sundjata from mere <b>baggage</b> <b>handler</b> to full-fledged warriors. A sofa was equipped by the state, whereas the horon brought their weapons. Sofa armies {{could be used to}} intimidate unfaithful governors, and they formed a majority of the infantry by the 15th century. So though imperial Mali was initially a horon-run army, its reliance on jonow as administrators (farimba) and officers (dùùkùnàsi) gradually transformed the character of its military.|$|E

40|$|Baggage {{handling}} is a {{high risk}} job that presents awkward postures, overexertion and repetition in their activities. Ergonomic studies have used biomechanical and psychophysical approaches to evaluate the level of risk of MSDs in <b>baggage</b> <b>handlers.</b> Most of the studies target the activities in the aircraft baggage compartment. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine the risk level of MSDs in <b>baggage</b> <b>handlers</b> of the Quito airport through the application of biomechanical risk factors identification tools, in order to propose control strategies that could reduce the mentioned risk. The study analyzed the manual handling activities performed in the baggage tunnel. Four activities were identified and 95 <b>baggage</b> <b>handlers</b> of the Quito airport were evaluated using the RULA. Also, the Maximum Acceptable Weight of Lift (MAWL) was applied to determine the lift capacity of <b>baggage</b> <b>handlers</b> in the Quito airport. The RULA analysis determined a total score of 7, Action Level 4, for each of the activities evaluated, for the 100 % of the <b>baggage</b> <b>handlers.</b> The activities performed by TAME and ANDES were found to be equal, but their lifting frequencies were not. On the other hand, the MAWL for the population of male <b>baggage</b> <b>handlers</b> in the Quito airport was determined to be 7 kg, which compared to the actual average weight of the bags lifted is much lower. Therefore, this study determined that baggage handling activities performed in the baggage tunnel present a high risk of developing an upper MSD, and work conditions should be changed immediately. Finally, administrative and engineering controls were proposed in order to reduce the biomechanical risk level that result from baggage handling activities...|$|R

25|$|Brown's men {{needed to}} capture the weapons and escape before word could be sent to Washington. The raid was going well for Brown's men. They cut the {{telegraph}} wire and seized a Baltimore & Ohio train passing through. A free black man was the first casualty of the raid. Hayward Shepherd, an African-American <b>baggage</b> <b>handler</b> on the train, confronted the raiders; they shot and killed him. For some reason, Brown let the train continue, and the conductor alerted the authorities down the line. Brown had been sure that he would win the support of local slaves in joining the rebellion, but a massive uprising did not occur, because word had not been spread about the uprising, so the slaves nearby {{did not know about}} it. Although the white townspeople soon began to fight back against the raiders, Brown's men succeeded in capturing the armory that evening.|$|E

40|$|Objective. Flight <b>baggage</b> <b>handlers</b> sort {{and load}} luggage to airplanes. This study aimed at {{investigating}} associations between psychosocial exposures and low back and shoulder musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) among Swedish flight <b>baggage</b> <b>handlers.</b> Methods. A questionnaire addressing MSDs (Standardized Nordic Questionnaire) and psychosocial factors (Copenhagen Psychosocial Questionnaire, COPSOQ) was answered by 525 <b>baggage</b> <b>handlers</b> in six Swedish airports. Results. Low back (LBP) and shoulder pain (SP) {{were reported by}} 70 % and 60 %, respectively. Pain was reported to interfere with work (PIW) by 30 % (low back) and 18 % (shoulders), and intense pain (PINT) occurred in 34 % and 28 % of the population. Quality of leadership was the most dissatisfying psychosocial factor, while the most positive was social community at work. Low ratings in the combined domain Work organization and job content {{were significantly associated with}} PIW in both low back and shoulders (Adjusted Hazard Ratios 3. 65 (95 % CI 1. 67 – 7. 99) and 2. 68 (1. 09 – 6. 61)) while lower ratings in the domain Interpersonal relations and leadership were associated with PIW LBP (HR 2. 18 (1. 06 – 4. 49)) and PINT LBP and SP (HRs 1. 95 (1. 05 – 3. 65) and 2. 11 (1. 08 – 4. 12)). Conclusion. Severity of pain among flight <b>baggage</b> <b>handlers</b> was associated with psychosocial factors at work, suggesting that they may be a relevant target for intervention in this occupation...|$|R
