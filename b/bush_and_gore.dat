50|$|During the 2000 presidential election, the Democrats chose Vice President Al Gore {{to be the}} party's {{candidate}} for the presidency. Gore ran against George W.

Nevertheless, Gore's affiliation with Clinton and the DLC caused critics to assert that <b>Bush</b> <b>and</b> <b>Gore</b> were too similar, especially on free trade, reductions in social welfare, and the death penalty.

On Nov. 1, 2000, {{just days before the}} election, Gore turned down an invitation to come to Washington for the Polish National Alliance's celebration of 20 years of Solidarity, including the AFL-CIO President. The event was non-partisan, and both <b>Bush</b> <b>and</b> <b>Gore</b> were invited. Gore did not come and did not express any regrets, which was perceived as a snub.|$|E

5000|$|Nader {{himself and}} many of his {{supporters}} argued that most Nader voters would either have chosen another minor party candidate or abstained from voting, had Nader not been on the ballot.

A 2006 study found that at least 40% of Nader voters in Florida would have voted for Bush if Nader had not run, while the other 60% would have voted for Gore.

5000|$|Furthermore, the Florida Administrative Code: 1S-2.0031, [...] "Write-in Procedures Governing Electronic Voting Systems", (7) at {{the time}} specified, [...] "An overvote shall occur when an elector casts {{a vote on the}} ballot card and also casts a {{write-in}} vote for a qualified write-in candidate for that same office.

However, an overvote shall not occur when the elector casts a vote on the ballot card but then enters a sham or unqualified name in the write-in space for that same office. In such case, only the write-in vote is void." [...] There were two write-in candidates for president who had been qualified by the state of Florida.

40|$|This study {{analyzes}} {{the effects of}} political talk radio use on the perceived fairness of the 2000 U. S. presidential election. In particular, a process of influence is hypothesized leading from talk radio use to feelings toward the two major-party candidates (<b>Bush</b> <b>and</b> <b>Gore).</b> Citizens ’ affective associations with the candidates are then argued to have competing effects on the perceived fairness of the 2000 election. The influence of per-ceived fairness on subsequent feelings toward Bush is also assessed. This process of political talk radio influence is analyzed in a single structural equation model using 2000 – 02 American National Election Study (ANES) panel data. Political talk radio use leads to negative perceptions of Gore,which negatively influences perceptions of the perceived fairness of the 2000 election. Conversely, talk radio use generates more positive feelings toward Bush, which positively affects perceptions of fairness. Thus, feelings toward both candidates serve as important mediators that allow {{the use of this}} public affairs information source to make citizens feel better about how the fiercely contested 2000 presidential election was decided. Perceived fairness is also found to be a significant positive predictor of post– 2002 election cycle attitudes toward Bush, even after accounting for prior feelings toward both <b>Bush</b> <b>and</b> <b>Gore.</b> Implications for these finding are outlined and future lines of research are detailed...|$|E

40|$|What {{political}} candidates say during their campaign {{and when they}} say it are critical to their success. In three experiments, we show that abstract, “why”-laden appeals are more persuasive than concrete, “how”-laden appeals when voters ’ decision is temporally distant; {{the reverse is true}} when the decision is imminent, and these results are strongest among those who are politically uninformed. These effects seem to be driven by a match between temporal distance and the abstractness of the message that leads to perceptions of fluency, and the ensuing “feels right” experience yields enhanced evaluations of the focal stimulus. With the increased penetration of cable television, talk radio, and Web logs (popularly referred to as blogs), the coverage of political topics and campaigns appears to be ubiquitous and incessant. This expansion of media outlets, with the accompanying increase in media coverage, is having a predictable effect on political expenditures as well. For instance, the Federal Election Commission reports that the 1996 presidential campaign pitting Clinton against Dole cost $ 449 million, the 2000 campaign featuring <b>Bush</b> <b>and</b> <b>Gore</b> cost $ 649. 5 million, and the 2004 contest between Bush and Kerry cost over $ 1 billio...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The 2000 {{election}} raised serious accuracy and/or {{security concerns}} with all current voting systems. After examining these problems we describe criteria any system should meet. We propose a protocol which is technically feasible now and which meets these criteria. Most voters have trusted that the systems provided for casting their votes actually produce {{a reliable and}} precise record of the votes cast. The Florida election fiasco of 2000 has jolted that complacency. The difference {{in the number of}} votes cast for <b>Bush</b> <b>and</b> <b>Gore</b> was less than the margin of error of the system used for casting and counting the ballots, and there was no simple, quick and evenhanded solution available to eliminate that error. The importance of the election publicized the existence of this margin of error, which varied significantly among different voting systems and among different groups of voters. Election professionals have always been aware that there was a margin of error in each system; there are always votes that {{for one reason or another}} are not counted. This error was considered relatively unimportant and easily outweighed by considerations of convenience and cost, because it was generally assumed that the error rate would rarely affect the outcome, that the error was rando...|$|E
40|$|This article {{analyzes}} how Florida 2 ̆ 7 s state election laws operated {{during the}} aftermath of the 2000 presidential election. The intersection of law and politics in this controversy was critical. Political considerations affected decisions in both the <b>Bush</b> <b>and</b> <b>Gore</b> camps. The aftermath of the 2000 election found the federal government, the National Conference of State Legislatures, and the State of Florida (among others) commissioning task forces and committees to investigate and suggest election reforms. Ultimately, the State of Florida passed significant election reform legislation. On May 10, 2001, Florida enacted sweeping election reform legislation entitled the Florida Election Reform Act of 2001. This legislation overhauls and reforms many sections of Florida 2 ̆ 7 s election code and addresses reform of voting equipment, ballot uniformity, and poll worker training. Critics, including the U. S. Commission on Civil Rights, argue that the new legislation fails to address some of the critical issues of voter disenfranchisement. Most importantly, this article analyzes the events in Florida following the litigation that culminated in Bush v. Gore— the aftermath and its consequences—and concludes that the state 2 ̆ 7 s new elections laws will prohibit a future crisis of the kind seen in the 2000 presidential election. In Part II, this article sets out the specific factors that caused Florida to become the epicenter of the 2000 election controversy. In Part III, this article further describes the Florida perspective and the theory of “counting the votes” which is derived from Florida case law and concludes that Bush v. Gore was correctly decided by the Florida Supreme Court as a matter of Florida law. In Part IV, this article discusses the recent electoral reform legislation enacted by the State of Florida, concluding that these changes will improve the election system in Florida. Under these new reforms, there will never again be a “hanging chad” in Florida because punch card ballots have been eliminated from further use in Florida elections. Despite the anger and confusion aroused by the electoral controversy in Florida, these struggles will ultimately improve the election process in the state of Florida and most likely the nation as a whole...|$|E
