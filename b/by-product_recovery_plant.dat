40|$|The U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) {{teamed with}} the National Mining Association (NMA) to select {{research}} projects that could significantly benefit the mining industry. This paper describes one such project—By-Product Recovery from Mining Process Residue—that is {{being conducted by}} Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) and Colorado School of Mines engineers. This project has two objectives: (1) compiling information on the mining industry to identify process residue with <b>by-product</b> <b>recovery</b> opportunities; and (2) engineering development of an innovative <b>by-product</b> <b>recovery</b> system—the SepraDyne ® process—a high vacuum, indirectly heated rotary kiln that operates at temperatures of up to 750 EC.

For simulated and industrial waste-water, chemical oxygen demand, turbidity, and total sol-ids were reduced over 90, 97, and 95 %, respectively, for all coagulants tested. Protein and fat recoveries were over 95 % for all coagulants.

40|$|The U. S. mineral {{processing}} industry produces over 30, 000,OOO metric {{tons per year}} of process residue and waste that may contain hazardous species as well as valuable by-products. Copper, lead, and zinc commodity sectors generate between 23, 300,OOO and 24, 000,OOO metric tons per year of process residue. An evaluation of these sectors resulted in mining process flow diagrams and technical descriptions, and evaluation of major sources of process residue by commodity sector [l]. This survey identified the following process residues and waste as having <b>by-product</b> <b>recovery</b> potential: b copper-dust and fine particles, tailings, slag waste, and gas cleaning sludge; l lead-dust and fine particles, tailings, slag; and l zinc-dust and fine particles, liquor residues, undesirable elements in solution, &slag. 1 Metal concentrations in process residue can exceed metal concentration in the natural ore and may therefore present opportunities for <b>by-product</b> <b>recovery.</b> The economics of <b>by-product</b> <b>recovery</b> {{are influenced by the}} cost of managing process residue as a waste (e. g., storage and/or disposal), the cost of the process residue before additional processing, the value o...|$|R

40|$|Secondary copper smelters, which {{primarily}} {{utilize the}} waste materials that contain organic impurities, and the zinc <b>recovery</b> <b>plant,</b> which handles mostly fly ash and slag from the {{iron and steel}} industry, are major emission sources of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs) in Taiwan. In this study, we compared the levels of erythrocyte glutathione (GSH), erythrocyte superoxide dismutase (SOD) and plasma malondialdehyde (MDA) in workers at a secondary copper smelting plant and a zinc <b>recovery</b> <b>plant</b> {{who may have been}} exposed to PCDD/Fs. Though the PCDD/F levels were higher in workers of zinc <b>recovery</b> <b>plant</b> than those of secondary copper smelting plant, no significant difference was found for serum PCDD/F levels between the two kinds of plants. We observed a significant difference in plasma MDA levels between workers at the zinc <b>recovery</b> <b>plant</b> (2. 54 mu M) and those at the copper smelting plant (1. 79 mu M). There was and a significant positive correlation between plasma MDA levels and the PCDD/Fs levels. In addition, we observed that the MDA levels were not affected by smoking and exercise status. Therefore, the data suggest that the MDA levels of the metal recovery workers are influenced by their PCDD/F exposure. The erythrocyte SOD activity in workers from the zinc <b>recovery</b> <b>plant</b> was marginally higher than that from the secondary copper plant (196 vs. 146 units/ml, p < 0. 06). In both plants, large variations in the MDA and SOD levels were found, especially in the high-PCDD/Fs-exposure group, which may be attributed, at least partially, to the differences in smoking status and the number of cigarettes smoked. Overall, our results indicate a higher oxidative stress in workers of the zinc <b>recovery</b> <b>plant</b> than in workers of the secondary copper smelting plant in Taiwan.
