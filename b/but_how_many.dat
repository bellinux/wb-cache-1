500|$|In a 1980 {{interview}} with Playboy magazine, John Lennon expressed his {{doubts about the}} notion of [...] "subconscious" [...] plagiarism, saying: [...] "He must have known, you know. He's smarter than that... He could have changed a couple of bars in that song and nobody could ever have touched him, but he {{just let it go}} and paid the price. Maybe he thought God would just sort of let him off." [...] Ringo Starr's reaction was more charitable: [...] "There's no doubt that the tune is similar <b>but</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> songs have been written with other melodies in mind? George's version is much heavier than The Chiffons – he might have done it with the original {{in the back of his}} mind, but he's just very unlucky that someone wanted to make it a test case in court." ...|$|E
500|$|Whiteread's agent Karsten Schubert said, [...] "The {{whole affair}} was a non-event. They {{achieved}} nothing {{and they were}} left looking like real prats." [...] Peter Chater, a director of Schubert's agency concurred; he called Drummond and Cauty [...] "cowards". [...] "It was obviously a publicity stunt. What sort of statement {{they were trying to}} make I don't know. If it was {{anything to do with the}} relationship between art and money it was pretty crass. The KLF made a fortune from a couple of successful singles. Artists aren't in that position. Threatening to set light to £40,000 is pretty obscene." [...] Former Factory Records boss Tony Wilson applauded the group, however. [...] "The K Foundation is a very peculiar avant garde group whose ideas are as valid anything the Turner people do," [...] he told NME. [...] "Since when has there been laws governing what constitutes art, or an artistic statement? OK, so a lot of people don't understand what Bill and Jimmy are trying to say, <b>but</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> people know exactly what Rachel Whiteread's trying to say with her art?" ...|$|E

2500|$|Rod McKenzie, {{the editor}} of BBC Radio 1 Newsbeat, {{observed}} on the BBC Editors' weblog (see Further reading) that audience reactions to Brand's and Ross's remarks had been polarised, noting that whilst his colleagues at Radio 4, Radio 5 Live, television, and the BBC World Service had been seeing one thing, the younger audiences of Radio 1 had been reacting quite differently, and were broadly supportive of Ross and Brand. Some were amazed at the comments of the Prime Minister, with one person observing that [...] "he financial markets are wrecked and all {{he can do is}} talk about a petty joke." [...] Others stated that people should [...] "calm down", [...] "get a grip", and that the subject had been [...] "blown out of all proportion". McKenzie also characterised the reaction from the news media as containing [...] "anger: some genuine, some of it synthetic. Some of it comes from the BBC's usual critics." [...] He stated that for the people who worked in the media [...] "profile and salary-envy and [...] may play a part in all this. <b>But</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> heard the original transmission and how many are responding to the newspapers' quotes or others' arguments?" ...|$|E

2500|$|The major {{controversy}} of {{the later}} Chrétien years was the Sponsorship Scandal, which involved more than $100million distributed from the Prime Minister's Office to Quebec's federalist and Liberal Party interests without much accountability. On May 8, 2002, the Sponsorship scandal broke when the Auditor-General, Sheila Fraser, issued a report accusing Public Works bureaucrats of having broken [...] "just about every rule in the book" [...] in awarding $1.6million to the Montreal ad firm Groupaction Marketing Inc. The money awarded to Groupaction in three dubious contracts appeared to have disappeared, and the firm {{had a long history}} of donating to the Liberals. Opposition critics further suggested that the Public Works minister at the time, Alfonso Gagliano, whom Chrétien had praised as a great patriot, was not just a mere by-stander to questionable contacts associated with the sponsorship program that Fraser had identified. In response to the public outrage, Chrétien argued in speech in Winnipeg that all this was necessary to stop Quebec separatism and justified by the results, stating that: [...] "Perhaps there was a few million dollars that might have been stolen in the process. It is possible. <b>But</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> millions of dollars have we saved the country because we have re-established the stability of Canada as an united country? If somebody has stolen the money, they will face the courts. But I will not apologize to Canadians." [...] Chrétien's argument that he had nothing to apologize for in regards to the sponsorship program, and his apparent condoning of corruption as justified by the results of saving Canada fared poorly with the Canadian public, which increasingly started to perceive the Prime Minister as an autocratic leader with a thuggish streak. A poll taken later in May 2002 showed that over half of Canadians believed that the Chrétien government was corrupt.|$|E
2500|$|Similar {{judgments}} {{were issued}} from various {{sides of the}} cultural spectrum. Although himself a collaborator of Perpessicius, Vladimir Streinu once referred to him as [...] "the flower girl of our literature". While Tudor Vianu believed the [...] "discreet" [...] Perpessicius able of [...] "biting irony", he also claimed: [...] "The critic is at times too indulgent and, as a consequence, the contrasts in his appreciations are somewhat toned down. <b>But</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> young people did not absorb fortifying strengths from Perpessicius' benevolent verdicts?" [...] Perpessicius' rejection of [...] "sectarianism" [...] was unfavorably reviewed by Cioculescu in a 1928 article for Adevărul, which prompted a reply from Perpessicius. For Alexandru Al, Philippide, the second volume of Antologia poeţilor de azi was a sample of such leniency, {{to the point of}} becoming [...] "embarrassingly instructive" [...] by including talentless authors. He noted: [...] "Seventy real poets in {{a quarter of a century}} is an a priori impossibility. [...] In such conditions, poetry presents itself as a real scourge, like some dangerous pestilence, almost like a social peril. And in such circumstances an anthology as horrifyingly complete as that of Mr. Pillat and Mr. Perpessicius appears to be disastrous. It is made to implant the belief that poets are to be found in a sum of individuals who, perhaps, had they been lacking such 'consecration', would be growing disillusioned and turn back into decent men, brave citizens and diligent clerks". The dispute touched on Perpessicius' own relationship with the avant-garde. In his account of Voronca's departure from the Surrealist group (part of a 1933 letter addressed to Fondane), Roll sarcastically downplayed his former colleague's success, alleging: [...] "Only Perpessicius smothered [...] in slobbery, grandmotherly, kisses; only Perpessicius showered with gifts, produced licks of the tongue, telephone calls and accolades." ...|$|E
