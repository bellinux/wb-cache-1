25|$|The area {{is known}} for its {{diversity}} of birds, with 212 species having been recorded as of 1987. Of these, 68 commonly breed, 30 breed occasionally, and 14 which have bred previously. Common birds include the black-throated loon, the <b>bean</b> <b>goose</b> and various species of ducks. Egg-gathering was previously popular from the common goldeneye. Common predator birds include the rough-legged buzzard and merlin, while the white-tailed eagle and golden eagle are less common. The short-eared owl is the most common owl. Waders are abundant along the river, the most common being common ringed plover, ruff and spotted redshank. Other common birds are the common gull, Arctic tern and sparrows.|$|E
500|$|Leopards {{are found}} in areas which are {{abundant}} in hills but may also venture into the lowland jungles. Smaller felines include the jungle cat, fishing cat, and leopard cat. Other mammals include four kinds of deer (barking, sambar, hog and chital), sloth and Himalayan black bears, Indian gray mongooses, otters, yellow-throated martens, bharal, Indian pangolins, and langur and rhesus monkeys. In the summer, elephants {{can be seen in}} herds of several hundred. Marsh crocodiles (Crocodylus palustris), gharials (Gavialis gangeticus) and other reptiles are also found in the region. Local crocodiles were saved from extinction by captive breeding programs and subsequently re-released into the Ramganga river. Several freshwater terrapins and turtles like the Indian sawback turtle (Kachuga tecta), brahminy river turtle (Hardella thurgii), and Ganges softshell turtle (Trionyx gangeticus) {{are found in}} the rivers. Butterflies [...] and birds of the region include red Helen (Papilio helenus), the great eggfly (Hypolimnos bolina), common tiger (Danaus genutia), pale wanderer (Pareronia avatar avatar), jungle babbler, tawny-bellied babbler, great slaty woodpecker, red-breasted parakeet, orange-breasted green pigeon and chestnut-winged cuckoo.

2500|$|Although quantitatively {{outnumbered by}} mammals, birds {{are the most}} diverse class of prey in the golden eagle's diet, as more than 200 species have been {{identified}} at eagle nests. Little analysis has gone into how regularly golden eagles will attack the nestling and fledglings of other birds, {{although it has been}} interpreted that this behavior is not uncommon, although adults {{are more likely to be}} golden eagle prey than immatures. Nestling-aged rock pigeons (Columba livia) have been observed as prey in golden eagle nests. The first record of a golden eagle eating eggs was recorded when a golden eagle was observed consuming Canada goose (Branta canadensis) eggs in eastern Idaho. After galliforms, the next most significant group of prey among birds is the corvid family, making up 4.1% of the diet from around the range. Most prevalent among these are magpies and the large-bodied Corvus (crow and raven) genus. On Santa Rosa and Santa Cruz Islands in California, common raven became the most common prey species after feral pigs were eradicated from the latter, making up 24% of a 454 sample size from 14 nests. The raven was also the most prevalent bird prey in central Arizona, in a sampling of 1154 from 119 nests. The black-billed magpie (Pica hudsonia) was an important prey item in Washington state, making up 9.7% of the remains there, and was the most significant avian prey in Montana. In 10 studies in Europe, corvids made up more than 5% of the prey remains, usually represented by carrion crows/hooded crows (Corvus corone/cornix), rooks (Corvus frugilegus), Alpine chough (Pyrrhocorax graculus), ravens or Eurasian magpies (Pica pica). Smaller species such as jays and nutcrackers only occasionally turn up as prey, mainly in North America, though the Eurasian jay (Garrulus glandarius) has also been known as prey. The next best represented family of birds are the waterfowl, making up approximately 1.4% of the golden eagle's breeding season diet. Waterfowl of all sizes from green-winged teal (Anas crecca) to trumpeter swans (Cygnus buccinator), tundra swans (Cygnus columbianus) and mute swans (Cygnus olor) have been successfully hunted by golden eagles. Full-grown swans can weigh well over [...] and are probably the largest birds habitually hunted by golden eagles. Moderately sized species, including larger Anas ducks such as mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) and geese such as <b>bean</b> <b>goose</b> (Anser fabalis) are perhaps most often recorded. Waterfowl are mostly recorded during the nesting season in Northern Europe, comprising 15.4% of prey in Gotland and 14.4% of prey in Belarus. In some years at Malheur-Harney Lakes Basin in Oregon, Anas ducks can make up to 20% of the prey consumed by the locally nesting eagles. Mostly in the United States, wintering golden eagles may become habitually predators of wintering and migrating groups of waterfowl, with species such as Canada geese, cackling geese (Branta hutchinsii), snow geese (Chen caerulescens), and Ross's geese (Chen rossii). Since geese are found in large concentration when seasonal conditions require it, these species can be hunted with relative ease. Waterfowl are typically hunted using the “contour flight with short glide attack” technique, in order to surprise the prey before it can take flight or dive. In one case, a golden eagle was able to capture a mallard as it took off in flight. Other water birds are generally less frequent prey but may become regular in the diet in marsh-like northern regions and coastal areas. Scotland, being surrounded by coasts and possessing quite a wet climate, often hosts water birds which become prey such as colonies of petrels (largely northern fulmar (Fulmarus glacialis)), making up to 17% of the recorded prey in 26 nests with a 119 sample size in the Outer Hebrides, migrating throngs of sandpipers and plovers (up to 5.9% and 2.8% in 25 nest in the northern Inner Hebrides) and gulls (making up a whopping 23% of prey recorded in 25 nests in the West-Central Highlands). Among shorebirds, usually only larger types such as godwits, curlews, Tringa sp., stone-curlews and oystercatchers turn up as prey, although smaller species are probably also taken as prey since they are agile enough to catch them. Eurasian cranes (Grus grus) are regularly predated in Northern Europe, turning up at 6.8% of nests in Estonia and 5.8% of nests in southern Finland. Hooded cranes (Grus monacha) are reportedly prey for golden eagles in China. Demoiselle cranes (Anthropoides virgo) have been caught in mid-air as they migrate over the Himalayas and both sandhill (Grus canadensis) and whooping cranes (Grus americana) may be hunted in North America. The last known breeding pair of golden eagles in Maine (which did not return after 1999) were reported to hunt an unusually large number of herons, specifically great blue herons (Ardea herodias) and American bitterns (Botaurus lentiginosus). Elsewhere, herons are basically negligible in the diet. Other water birds recorded as prey include cormorants (up to 8.6% of the recorded prey in Santa Rosa and Santa Cruz Islands), auks, grebes and loons.|$|E

40|$|Nitrogen {{acquisition}} by Greater White–fronted and <b>Bean</b> <b>geese</b> {{from late}} autumn to early spring, was studied in Japan. Samples of food plants {{were collected from}} eight major locations throughout late autumn 2005 to early spring 2006, and analyzed for nitrogen content. Major food sources were waste rice grains, post-harvest soy beans and corn and secondary rice stems, together with several wild grasses and barley/wheat sprouts growing on rice fields. The nitrogen content of food species eaten by the geese just prior to spring migration was considered sufficiently high for their needs, being comparable to plant nitrogen contents documented from the Arctic breeding areas. The analysis indicates the potential importance of food source nitrogen as a criterion for site selection during migration and wintering. The importance for the geese {{of being able to}} eat foods with high nitrogen content following a long–distance migration is discussed on the basis of existing references...|$|R
40|$|In January 2014, an {{outbreak}} of infection with highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A(H 5 N 8) virus began on a duck farm in South Korea and spread to other poultry farms nearby. During this outbreak, many sick or dead wild birds were found around habitats frequented by migratory birds. To determine the causes of death, we examined 771 wild bird carcasses and identified HPAI A(H 5 N 8) virus in 167. Gross and histologic lesions were observed in pancreas, lung, brain, and kidney of Baikal teals, <b>bean</b> <b>geese,</b> and whooper swans but not mallard ducks. Such lesions are consistent with lethal HPAI A(H 5 N 8) virus infection. However, some HPAI-positive birds had died of gunshot wounds, peritonitis, or agrochemical poisoning rather than virus infection. These findings suggest that susceptibility to HPAI A(H 5 N 8) virus varies among species of migratory birds and that asymptomatic migratory birds could be carriers of this virus...|$|R
40|$|Avian {{paramyxovirus}} serotype 4 (APMV- 4) {{is found}} sporadically in wild birds worldwide, {{and it is}} an economically important poultry pathogen. Despite the existence of several published strains, very {{little is known about the}} distribution, host species, and transmission of APMV- 4 strains. To better understand the relationships among these factors, we conducted an APMV- 4 surveillance of wild birds and domestic poultry in six provinces of China suspected of being intercontinental flyways and sites of interspecies transmission. APMV- 4 surveillance was conducted in 9, 160 wild birds representing seven species, and 1, 461 domestic poultry in live bird markets (LMBs) from December 2013 to June 2016. The rate of APMV- 4 isolation was 0. 10 % (11 / 10, 621), and viruses were isolated from swan <b>geese,</b> <b>bean</b> <b>geese,</b> cormorants, mallards, and chickens. Sequencing and phylogenetic analyses of the 11 isolated viruses indicated that all the isolates belonging to genotype I were epidemiologically connected with wild bird-origin viruses from the Ukraine and Italy. Moreover, chicken-origin APMV- 4 strains isolated from the LBMs were highly similar to wild bird-origin viruses from nearby lakes with free-living wild birds. In additional, a hemagglutination-negative APMV- 4 virus was identified. These findings, together with recent APMV- 4 studies, suggest potential virus interspecies transmission between wild birds and domestic poultry, and reveal possible epidemiological intercontinental connections between APMV- 4 transmission by wild birds...|$|R

50|$|There are few natural predators {{of adult}} cranes, {{although}} white-tailed eagle (Haliaeetus albicilla), Bonelli's eagles (Aquila fasciata) and golden eagles (Aquila chrysaetos) are a potential predatory threat to common cranes of all ages. The crane {{has been known}} to counterattack eagles both on the land and in mid-flight, using their bill as a weapon and kicking with their feet. Common cranes were additionally recorded as prey for Eurasian eagle-owls (Bubo bubo) in the Ukok Plateau of Russia. Mammals such as wild boar (Sus scrofa), wolverine (Gulo gulo) and red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) are attacked at the nest, as they are potential predators. When facing off against mammals, cranes jab with their bill, hit with their wings and kick with their feet. The cranes nimbly avoid strikes against themselves by jumping into the air. It is probable that are threatened by a wider range of large mammalian predators as is the black-necked crane but these have not yet been recorded. Herbivorous mammals such as red deer (Cervus elaphus) may also be attacked at the nest, indicating the high aggressiveness of the birds while nesting. The determined attack of a parent crane often assures safety from predators, but occasional losses to predation are inevitable. The carrion crow (Corvus corone) is locally a successful predator of common cranes' eggs, trickily using distraction displays to steal them. Other species of Corvus may also cause some loss of eggs, with common ravens (Corvus corax) also taking some small chicks. Common cranes may loosely associate with any other crane in the Grus genus in migration or winter as well as greater white-fronted <b>geese</b> and <b>bean</b> <b>geese.</b>|$|R
40|$|In der zweiten Hälfte des 20. Jahrhunderts haben die Bestände vieler Gänsearten im Westen Europas zugenommen. Aufgrund vorliegender Daten scheint es nicht unrealistisch zu sein, dass die westpaläarktischen Bestände der Bless-, Saat- und Graugänse seit Mitte des 19.

Diese Entwicklung zeigt, dass eine regional positive Bestandsentwicklung bei einer wandernden Vogelart nicht unbedingt mit einer positiven Bestandsentwicklung der Gesamtpopulation verbunden ist, und dass die Einschätzung einer Bestandsentwicklung als positiv oder negativ stark von dem berücksichtigten Zeitraum abhängig ist. Die Daten zeigen auch, dass die Gänsejagdstrecke seit den 1950 er Jahren zugenommen hat, während der jährliche Fortpflanzungserfolg bei den meisten arktischen Gänsearten seitdem stetig zurückgegangen ist. Diese Entwicklung lässt befürchten, dass die meisten arktischen Gänsearten in den kommenden Jahren wieder einen Bestandsrückgang zeigen werden. In {{the second}} half of the 20 th century the populations of the majority of the West-European goose species increased. Based on available data it seems not unrealistic that the western Palearctic population of the White-fronted, <b>Bean</b> and Greylag <b>Goose</b> have decreased dramatically since the middle of the 19 th century and have stabilized and shifted within Europe since the middle of the 20 th century. This development shows that a regionally positive population development of a migratory bird species not necessarily means that the whole population of the species shows an increasing tendency. At the same time it shows that the assessment of the population development of a species as being positive or negative strongly depends of the considered space of time. Besides the data showed that the goose bag increased since the 1950 s, whereas the annual reproductive rate of most goose species over the same period declined steadily. This development feeds the fear that the numbers of most arctic goose species could decline again in the coming years...|$|R
