25|$|New South Wales {{began their}} innings {{on the first}} day after Queensland were all out for 137. Callaway came in to bat at around 4 o' clock with the score at 17 for 3. Callaway and opener Frank Farrar added 41 runs. At the fall of Farrar, the NSW captain Charles Macartney joined Callaway. Macartney was usually a very attacking batsman <b>but</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>day</b> he was not well and let Callaway lead the scoring.|$|E
25|$|I {{was at the}} Sydney Cricket Ground in 1982 {{when this}} unknown Canberra teenage fullback was playing in what was {{regarded}} {{as something of a}} trial, a curtain raiser to a Test against a New Zealand Under 21 side, though rarely did anyone from such a trial graduate immediately to much else. People were wandering into the ground and those who were there gave little attention to what was happening on the paddock. <b>But</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>day,</b> and not for the first time, a remarkably gifted and fleet of foot Canberra teenager swept into the backline, received the ball {{at the end of a}} pass, chip-kicked, accelerated, gathered and scored.|$|E
25|$|On {{the night}} of 14 February 1876 a {{domestic}} servant Estelle Faguette lay in Pellevoisin dying of pulmonary tuberculosis, and reportedly saw the Virgin Mary. Four days later, during the fifth apparition, Estelle seemed to be healed instantaneously. Altogether she said she experienced fifteen apparitions {{in the course of}} 1876. On 9 September the apparition drew attention to a small piece of white cloth, a scapular resting over her chest. Faguette had seen it there before, as plain white cloth, <b>but</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>day</b> it bore the red image of the Sacred Heart of Jesus. The following day the lady appeared again, saying she had come to encourage people to pray.|$|E
50|$|Nikolai Krogius vs Viktor Korchnoi, USSR Championship semi-final, Tbilisi 1956, French Defence, Tarrasch Variation (C05), 1-0 These two contemporaries {{would be}} destined to meet many more times, and Korchnoi {{gradually}} established superiority, <b>but</b> not <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>day.</b>|$|R

60|$|Never {{mind the}} quarrel, that's history, {{and you can}} read all about it at your leisure. <b>But</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> June <b>day</b> in the year of our Lord 1243, Henry so forgot himself as to very {{unjustly}} accuse De Montfort of treason {{in the presence of a}} number of the King's gentlemen.|$|R
25|$|On 24 November, Kellermann massed 16,000 French {{troops on}} the Duero near Valdestillas. Badly outnumbered, the French {{prepared}} to defend themselves. <b>But</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>day</b> the Army of the Left received news of the Ocaña disaster. Understanding that this dire event meant that the French could spare plenty of soldiers to track down his army, Del Parque bolted to the south, intending to shelter {{in the mountains of}} central Spain. On 25 November, Del Parque slipped away so suddenly that Kellermann did not even begin his pursuit until the next day. For two days, the French were unable to catch up with their adversaries. But on the afternoon of 28 November, their light cavalry found the Army of the Left camped at Alba de Tormes.|$|E
2500|$|Lombardi's Packers {{hosted the}} Dallas Cowboys in Green Bay on December 31, 1967 in the NFL Championship Game of 1967. This {{became known as}} the [...] "Ice Bowl" [...] because of the −13°F game time temperature. Lombardi had a heating coil {{underneath}} the field <b>but</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>day</b> it was not functioning, some people believe that he turned it off on purpose. With 16 seconds left in the game and down by 3 points, the Packers called their final time-out. It was 3rd and goal on the Dallas 2 foot line. In the huddle, with the game on the line, Starr asked Kramer whether he could get enough traction on the icy turf for a wedge play and Kramer responded with an unequivocal yes. Quarterback Bart Starr came over to Lombardi on the sidelines to discuss the last play and told him he wanted to run a 31 wedge, but with him keeping the ball. Lombardi told Starr to 'Run it! And let's {{get the hell out of}} here!' Lombardi was asked by Pat Peppler what play Starr would call, to which Lombardi replied, 'Damned if I know.' Starr returned to the huddle and called a Brown right 31 Wedge, but with him keeping the ball. Kramer blocked Jethro Pugh low and Ken Bowman hit Pugh high as Starr followed them into the end zone for the Packer lead and eventual victory.|$|E
60|$|Razumov, thus left to himself, {{took the}} {{direction}} of the gate. <b>But</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>day</b> of many conversations, he discovered that very probably he could not leave the grounds without having to hold another one.|$|E
60|$|The {{doctor has}} {{just left the}} house, in some little perplexity about me. He has found me {{reclining}} as usual (latterly) in my arm-chair; <b>but</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> particular <b>day</b> he has detected symptoms of exhaustion, which he finds quite unaccountable under the circumstances, and which warn him to exert his authority by sending {{me back to my}} bed.|$|R
60|$|On Sundays {{they were}} more together; <b>but</b> even <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>day</b> there was cause of separation, for Aaron went to the Episcopalian church, rather to the disgust of Hetta. In the afternoon, however, they were together; and then Phineas Beckard came in to tea on Sundays, and he and Aaron got to talking on religion; and though they {{disagreed}} pretty much, and would not give an inch either one or the other, nevertheless the minister told the widow, and Hetta too probably, that the lad had good stuff in him, though he was so stiff-necked.|$|R
60|$|On {{ordinary}} occasions Herbert {{would listen}} to them, and answer them, and give them, at any rate, the satisfaction which they derived from discoursing with him, if he could give them no other satisfaction. <b>But</b> now, <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>day,</b> with his own burden so heavy at his heart, he could not even do this. He {{could not think of}} their sorrows; his own sorrow seemed to him to be so much the heavier. So he passed on, running the gauntlet through them as best he might, and shaking them off from him, as they attempted to cling round his steps. Nothing is so powerful in making a man selfish as misfortune.|$|R
60|$|There was {{service at}} St. Mary's Church on Wednesday and Friday mornings; <b>but</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>day</b> {{the rain was}} so violent, {{that of all the}} party at the Vicarage, the Mertons, and Elizabeth, Katherine, and Helen, alone ventured to go to church.|$|E
60|$|Now {{it seems}} that Suzanne found Ralph and gave him my message, and that they started {{together}} to look for buck on the strip of land which lies between the seashore and {{the foot of the}} hills, where sometimes the blesbok and springbok used to feed in thousands. <b>But</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>day</b> there were none to be seen, for the dry grass had already been burnt off, so that there was nothing for them to eat.|$|E
60|$|Now, {{strange as}} it may seem, {{it was at this}} moment only that there flashed across my mind the thought of all that I had heard about the Spanish stranger, the report of whose coming to Yarmouth had stirred my father and mother so deeply. At any other time I should have remembered it soon enough, <b>but</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>day</b> I was so set upon my tryst with Lily and what I should say to her, that nothing else could hold a place in my thoughts.|$|E
5000|$|A senior Association {{match was}} played as a curtain-raiser to a League senior match. Western {{suburban}} clubs Werribee and Sunshine played a match at the Western Oval, Footscray as a curtain-raiser to the League match between [...] and Brisbane on Sunday 31 July; the curtain-raiser timeslot was usually filled by a VFL reserves game, <b>but</b> was available <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>day</b> because Brisbane did not field a reserves team.|$|R
60|$|<b>But</b> if <b>on</b> <b>this</b> same <b>day,</b> 1851 years ago, {{instead of}} being in the great city of Rome, we had been in the little village of Bethlehem in Judaea, we might have seen a sight {{stranger}} still; a sight which we could not have fancied {{had anything to do with}} that merrymaking of the slaves at Rome, and yet which had everything to do with it.|$|R
6000|$|... "But he wouldn't be a {{party to}} {{stealing}} a lot of trumpery trinkets, or taking her husband's money. Indeed, I don't think he {{has anything to do}} with it." [...] Then Eames thought over the circumstances of the day, and remembered that he had certainly not seen Cradell since the morning. It was that public servant's practice to saunter into Eames's room in the middle of the day, and there consume bread and cheese and beer,--in spite of an assertion which Johnny had once made as to crumbs of biscuit bathed in ink. <b>But</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> special <b>day</b> he had not done so. [...] "I can't think he has been such a fool as that," [...] said Johnny.|$|R
60|$|Elated {{with this}} strain of feeling, I reached the wood {{not long after}} noon; but no melodious voice gave me {{familiar}} and expected welcome; nor did my invisible companion make itself heard at all on that day, or, at all events, not in its usual bird-like warbling language. <b>But</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>day</b> I met with a curious little adventure and heard something very extraordinary, very mysterious, which I could not avoid connecting in my mind with the unseen warbler that so often followed me in my rambles.|$|E
60|$|Lapham drove {{there with}} his wife after he had set Bartley Hubbard down at the Events office, <b>but</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>day</b> {{something}} happened that interfered with the solid pleasure they usually took in going over the house. As the Colonel turned from casting anchor at the mare's head with the hitching-weight, after helping his wife to alight, he encountered a man to whom {{he could not help}} speaking, though the man seemed to share his hesitation if not his reluctance at the necessity. He was a tallish, thin man, with a dust-coloured face, and a dead, clerical air, which somehow suggested at once feebleness and tenacity.|$|E
60|$|My dear boys, on all days Wisdom {{calls you}} to her feast, by many weighty arguments, by many loving allurements, by many awful threats. <b>But</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>day,</b> {{of all the}} year, she calls you {{by the memory of}} the example of those who sit already and for ever at her feast. By the memory and example of the wise of every age and every land, she bids you enter in and feast with them, on the wealth which she, and they, her {{faithful}} servants, have prepared for you. They have laboured; and they call you, in their mistress's name, to enter into their labours. She taught them wisdom, and she calls on you to learn wisdom of them in turn.|$|E
60|$|It was a {{fortnight}} since Mrs. Bennet had been downstairs; <b>but</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> happy <b>day</b> she again took her {{seat at the}} head of her table, and in spirits oppressively high. No sentiment of shame gave a damp to her triumph. The marriage of a daughter, which had been the first object of her wishes since Jane was sixteen, was now on the point of accomplishment, and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those attendants of elegant nuptials, fine muslins, new carriages, and servants. She was busily searching through the neighbourhood for a proper situation for her daughter, and, without knowing or considering what their income might be, rejected many as deficient in size and importance.|$|R
6000|$|One {{day while}} out {{shooting}} with the colonel, {{with whom he}} was {{doing his best to}} ingratiate himself, with a view to obtaining his consent to the match, he had allowed his sporting instincts to carry him away to such a degree that, in sporting parlance, he wiped his eye badly. Now, the colonel prided himself with justice on his powers as a shot; <b>but</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> particular <b>day</b> he had a touch of liver, which resulted in his shooting over the birds, and under the birds, and {{on each side of the}} birds, but very rarely at the birds. Dallas being in especially good form, it was found, when the bag came to be counted, that, while he had shot seventy brace, the colonel had only managed to secure five and a half! ...|$|R
50|$|Nebraska entirely {{smashed the}} Texas Longhorns as these teams {{met for the}} first time, {{delivering}} a sound shutout defeat that left no doubt as to Nebraska's aspirations for the 1933 season. Not once during the previous 7-1-1 season was coach Bible able to play everyone <b>on</b> the roster, <b>but</b> against Texas <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>day</b> the backups began to cycle onto the field in the third quarter. The Cornhuskers outgained the Longhorns 320 to 85, and Texas never got closer than the Nebraska 30-yard line.|$|R
60|$|The crooked lane {{leading from}} their own parish to Mellstock ran along the lowest levels in a portion of its length, and when the girls reached the most {{depressed}} spot {{they found that the}} result of the rain had been to flood the lane over-shoe to a distance of some fifty yards. This would have been no serious hindrance on a week-day; they would have clicked through it in their high patterns and boots quite unconcerned; <b>but</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>day</b> of vanity, this Sun's-day, when flesh went forth to coquet with flesh while hypocritically affecting business with spiritual things; on this occasion for wearing their white stockings and thin shoes, and their pink, white, and lilac gowns, on which every mud spot would be visible, the pool was an awkward impediment. They could hear the church-bell calling--as yet nearly a mile off.|$|E
60|$|When she {{had eaten}} what she could--it was not much--Beatrice {{went to her}} room, undressed herself, bathed, and put on clean, fresh things. Then she unbound her lovely hair, and did {{it up in a}} coronet upon her head. It was a fashion that she did not often adopt, because it took too much time, <b>but</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>day,</b> of all days, she had a strange fancy to look her best. Also her hair had been done like this on the {{afternoon}} when Geoffrey first met her. Next she put on the grey dress once more which she had worn on her journey to London, and taking the silver Roman ring that Geoffrey had given her from the string by which she wore it about her neck, placed it on the third finger of her left hand.|$|E
60|$|The nest of the Simurgh {{was in the}} {{wonderful}} tree above him, and in it were young birds; the parents were away searching for food. They always told the children, before they left them, not to put their heads out of the nest; but, to-day, at {{the noise of the}} fight below, they looked down and so saw the whole affair. By the time the dragon had been killed they were very hungry and set up a clamour for food. The prince therefore cut up the dragon and fed them with it, bit by bit, till they had eaten the whole. He then washed himself and lay down to rest, and he was still asleep when the Simurgh came home. As a rule, the young birds raised a clamour of welcome when their parents came near, <b>but</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>day</b> they were so full of dragon-meat that they had no choice, they had to go to sleep.|$|E
6000|$|<b>But</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> {{particular}} <b>day</b> {{it seemed}} as if December had remembered {{that it was time for}} winter and had turned suddenly dull and brooding, with a windless hush predictive of coming snow. Nevertheless, Anne keenly enjoyed her walk through the great gray maze of the beechlands; though alone she never found it lonely; her imagination peopled her path with merry companions, and with these she carried on a gay, pretended conversation that was wittier and more fascinating than conversations are apt to be in real life, where people sometimes fail most lamentably to talk up to the requirements. In a [...] "make believe" [...] assembly of choice spirits everybody says just the thing you want her to say and so gives you the chance to say just what YOU want to say. Attended by this invisible company, Anne traversed the woods and arrived at the fir lane just as broad, feathery flakes began to flutter down softly.|$|R
60|$|Mr Moffat {{was a young}} man, {{and there}} was no knowing to what {{proficiency}} in the Parliamentary gift of public talking he might yet attain; but hitherto his proficiency was not great. He had, however, endeavoured to make up by study for any want of readiness of speech, and had come to Barchester daily, for the last four days, fortified with a very pretty harangue, which he had prepared for himself in the solitude of his chamber. On the three previous days matters had been allowed to progress with tolerable smoothness, and he had been permitted to deliver himself of his elaborate eloquence with few other interruptions than those occasioned by his own want of practice. <b>But</b> <b>on</b> <b>this,</b> the <b>day</b> of days, the Barchesterian roughs were not so complaisant. It appeared to Mr Moffat, when he essayed to speak, that he was surrounded by enemies rather than friends; and in his heart he gave great blame to Mr Nearthewinde for not managing matters better for him.|$|R
6000|$|... "You are aware, Mr. Holmes, {{that our}} college doors are double--a green baize one within {{and a heavy}} oak one without. As I {{approached}} my outer door, I was amazed to see a key in it. For an instant I imagined that I had left my own there, <b>but</b> <b>on</b> feeling in my pocket I {{found that it was}} all right. The only duplicate which existed, so far as I knew, was that which belonged to my servant, Bannister--a man who has looked after my room for ten years, and whose honesty is absolutely above suspicion. I found that the key was indeed his, that he had entered my room to know if I wanted tea, and that he had very carelessly left the key in the door when he came out. His visit to my room must have been within a very few minutes of my leaving it. His forgetfulness about the key would have mattered little upon any other occasion, <b>but</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> one <b>day</b> it has produced the most deplorable consequences.|$|R
60|$|Sept. 12th.--During {{the last}} six days, the worms have not been active, though many {{castings}} have been ejected in the neighbouring fields; <b>but</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>day</b> the earth was a little raised over the mouths of the burrows, or castings were ejected, at ten fresh points. These were defaced. It should be understood that when a fresh burrow is spoken of, this generally means only that an old burrow has been re-opened. Mr. Farrer was repeatedly struck with the pertinacity with which the worms re-opened their old burrows, even when no earth was ejected from them. I have often observed the same fact, and generally the mouths of the burrows are protected by an accumulation of pebbles, sticks or leaves. Mr. Farrer likewise observed that the worms living beneath {{the floor of the}} atrium often collected coarse grains of sand, and such little stones as they could find, round the mouths of their burrows.|$|E
60|$|There {{he entered}} an inn {{where he sat}} down in the public room, and got {{something}} to eat. Some under-officers were sitting there, who were out to try to get some one enlisted to stand sentry. They had to go in this way, day after day, and hitherto they had always succeeded in finding one or other reckless fellow. <b>But</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>day</b> they had, as yet, found no one. It was too well known how all the sentinels disappeared, who were set on that post, and all that they had got hold of had refused with thanks. These sat down beside Christian, and ordered drinks, and drank along with him. Now Christian was a merry fellow who liked good company; he could both drink and sing, and talk and boast as well, when he got a little drop in his head. He told these under-officers {{that he was one of}} that kind of folk who never are afraid of anything. Then he was just the kind of man they liked, said they, and he might easily earn a good penny, before he was a day older, for the king paid a hundred dollars to anyone who would stand as sentinel in the church all night, beside his daughter's chest.|$|E
60|$|New Year's is the {{carnival}} of the beggars in Venice. Their business {{is carried on}} briskly throughout the year, <b>but</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>day</b> it is pursued with an unusual degree of perseverance, and an enterprise worthy of all disinterested admiration. At every corner, on every bridge, under every door-way, hideous shapes of poverty, mutilation, and deformity stand waiting, and thrust out palms, plates, and pans, and advance good wishes and blessings to all who pass, It is an immemorial custom, {{and it is one}} in which all but the quite comfortable classes participate. The facchini in every square take up their collections; the gondoliers have their plates prepared for contribution at every ferry; at every caffè and restaurant begging-boxes appeal to charity. Whoever has lifted hand in your service in any way during the past year expects a reward on New Year's for the complaisance, and in some cases the shop-keepers send to wish you a bel capo d'anno, with the same practical end in view. On New Year's Eve and morning bands of facchini and gondoliers go about howling vivas under charitable windows till they open and drop alms. The Piazza is invaded by the legions of beggary, and held in overpowering numbers against all comers; and to traverse it is like a progress through a lazar-house.|$|E
60|$|But {{there was}} {{one member of the}} company whose {{thoughts}} and feelings were very differently affected by the song of this national poet--this Eskimo Burns or Byron--namely the wizard Ujarak. In a moment of reckless anger he had challenged Okiok to combat, and, knowing that they would be called on to enter the arena and measure, not swords, <b>but</b> intellects, <b>on</b> the morrow, he felt ill at ease, for he could not hope to come off victorious. If it had been the ordinary battle of wits in blank verse, he might have had some chance he thought, but with this new and telling jingle at the end of alternate lines, he knew that he must of a surety fail. This was extremely galling, because, by the union of smartness, shrewd common sense, and at times judicious silence, he had managed up to that time to maintain his supremacy among his fellows. <b>But</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> unlucky <b>day</b> he had been physically overcome by his rival Angut, and now there was the prospect of being intellectually beaten by Okiok.|$|R
60|$|Among others, Dick Shand {{was sure}} {{that there was some}} entanglement. Entanglement was the word he always used in {{discussing}} the matter with Mrs. Callander. Between Dick and his friend there had been very little confidential communication of late. Caldigate had forbidden Shand {{to talk to him about}} Mrs. Smith, and thus had naturally closed the man's mouth on other matters. And then they had fallen into different sets. Dick, at least, had fallen into a set, while Caldigate had hardly associated with any but the one dangerous friend. Dick had lived much with a bevy of noisy young men who had been given to games and smoking, and to a good deal of drink. Caldigate had said not a word, even when on one occasion Dick had stumbled down into the cabin very much the worse for what he had taken. How could he find fault with Dick's folly when he would not allow Dick to say a word to him as to his own? <b>But</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> last <b>day</b> at sea it became necessary that they should understand each other.|$|R
60|$|It is {{needless to}} say that O'Riley was an Irishman. We have not {{mentioned}} him until now, because up to this time he had not done anything to distinguish himself beyond his messmates; <b>but</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> particular <b>day</b> O'Riley's star was in the ascendant, and Fortune seemed to have singled him out {{as an object of}} her special attention. He was a short man, and a broad man, and a particularly rugged man--so to speak. He was all angles and corners. His hair stuck about his head in violently rigid and entangled tufts, rendering it a matter of wonder how anything {{in the shape of a}} hat could stick on. His brow was a countless mass of ever-varying wrinkles, which gave to his sly visage an aspect of humorous anxiety that was highly diverting--and all the more diverting when you came to know that the man had not a spark of anxiety in his composition, though he often said he had. His dress, like that of most Jack-tars, was naturally rugged, and he contrived to make it more so than usual.|$|R
