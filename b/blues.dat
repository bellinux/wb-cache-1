5|$|<b>Blues</b> {{became a}} part of American popular music in the 1920s, when classic female <b>blues</b> singers like Bessie Smith grew popular. At the same time, record {{companies}} launched the field of race music, which was mostly <b>blues</b> targeted at African American audiences. The most famous of these acts went on to inspire much of the later popular development of the <b>blues</b> and blues-derived genres, including the legendary delta <b>blues</b> musician Robert Johnson and Piedmont <b>blues</b> musician Blind Willie McTell. By the end of the 1940s, however, pure <b>blues</b> was only a minor part of popular music, having been subsumed by offshoots like rhythm & <b>blues</b> and the nascent rock and roll style. Some styles of electric, piano-driven <b>blues,</b> like boogie-woogie, retained a large audience. A bluesy style of gospel also became popular in mainstream America in the 1950s, led by singer Mahalia Jackson. The <b>blues</b> genre experienced major revivals in the 1950s with Chicago <b>blues</b> musicians such as Muddy Waters and Little Walter, {{as well as in the}} 1960s in the British Invasion and American folk music revival when country <b>blues</b> musicians like Mississippi John Hurt and Reverend Gary Davis were rediscovered. The seminal <b>blues</b> musicians of these periods had tremendous influence on rock musicians such as Chuck Berry in the 1950s, as well as on the British <b>blues</b> and <b>blues</b> rock scenes of the 1960s and 1970s, including Eric Clapton in Britain and Johnny Winter in Texas.|$|E
5|$|<b>Blues</b> harpist Cyril Davies ran the London Skiffle Club at the Roundhouse {{public house}} in London’s Soho, {{which served as}} {{a focal point for}} British skiffle acts. Like guitarist Alexis Korner, he had worked for Chris Barber, playing in the R segment Barber {{introduced}} to his show and as part of the supporting band for visiting US artists. They began to play together as a duo and in 1957, deciding their central interest was <b>blues,</b> they closed the skiffle club and reopened a month later as The London <b>Blues</b> and Barrelhouse Club. It acted as a venue for visiting artists and their own performances. The visit of Muddy Waters in 1958 had a major impact on the duo and on the nature of British R in general. Initially British audiences were shocked by Waters's amplified electric <b>blues,</b> but he was soon playing to ecstatic crowds and receiving rave reviews. Where British <b>blues</b> had often emulated Delta <b>blues</b> and country <b>blues</b> in the emerging British folk revival, Davies and Korner, who had supported Waters on tour, now began to play high-powered electric <b>blues,</b> forming the band <b>Blues</b> Incorporated.|$|E

5|$|Paul Vaughn Butterfield (December 17, 1942May 4, 1987) was an American <b>blues</b> {{harmonica}} {{player and}} singer. After early {{training as a}} classical flautist, he developed an interest in <b>blues</b> harmonica. He explored the <b>blues</b> scene in his native Chicago, where he met Muddy Waters and other <b>blues</b> greats, who provided encouragement and opportunities for him to join in jam sessions.

Waters had already been a well-known <b>blues</b> musician across Europe and the United States in the '50s. His successful performances with his electric <b>blues</b> band, consisting of his half-brother Otis Spann (piano, vocals), Pat Hare (guitar), James Cotton (harmonica), Andrew Stevens (bass) and Francis Clay (drums), increasingly popularized the <b>blues</b> in mainstream music in the United States and Europe, especially among white audiences.|$|E

5|$|<b>Blues</b> is a {{combination}} of African work songs, field hollers, and shouts. It developed in the rural South {{in the first decade of}} the 20th century.

5|$|British {{rhythm and}} <b>blues</b> (or R) was a musical {{movement}} that {{developed in the}} United Kingdom between the late 1950s and the early 1960s, and reached a peak in the mid-1960s.
