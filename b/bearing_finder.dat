40|$|This {{research}} {{discusses the}} problem of development and manufacturing of the ultra-wideband (UWB) antenna element and antenna system {{on the basis of}} such element for mobile <b>bearing</b> <b>finder</b> of radio and television signals with the use of direction bearing quasi Doppler method. Due to the research results the mobile ultra-wideband antenna system was suggested. Its elements are new ultra-wideband emitters, which can belong to disco-cone antenna class. Ultra-wideband emitters are provided by foil form of the antenna element. The round function of the AS element, obtained by theoretical modeling and confirmed by practical experiments, has an exponential form. The fifth degree polynomial provides the required accuracy approximation. The combination of the radiator elements, their alignment and soldering is carried out by means of specially designed equipment. Checking of the transmitter parameter is done by proportional constant measuring of standing wave, which takes the meaning less than three values in the frequency range from 95 to 900 MHz. This satisfies the requirements of the ultra-wideband antenna direction <b>bearing</b> <b>finder</b> sources of radio signals. The basic parameters and design features of AS are presented...|$|E
40|$|NASA has {{recently}} re-confirmed {{their interest in}} autonomous systems as an enabling technology for future missions. In order for autonomous missions to be possible, highly-capable relative sensor systems are needed to determine an object's distance, direction, and orientation. This is true whether the mission is autonomous in-space assembly, rendezvous and docking, or rover surface navigation. Advanced Optical Systems, Inc. has developed a wide-angle laser range and <b>bearing</b> <b>finder</b> (RBF) for autonomous space missions. The laser RBF {{has a number of}} features that make it well-suited for autonomous missions. It has an operating range of 10 m to 5 km, with a 5 deg field of view. Its wide field of view removes the need for scanning systems such as gimbals, eliminating moving parts and making the sensor simpler and space qualification easier. Its range accuracy is 1 % or better. It is designed to operate either as a stand-alone sensor or in tandem with a sensor that returns range, bearing, and orientation at close ranges, such as NASA's Advanced Video Guidance Sensor. We have assembled the initial prototype and are currently testing it. We will discuss the laser RBF's design and specifications.

5000|$|While {{en route}} to Argentia, Newfoundland, at about 03:50 on 18 February 1942, Wilkess {{commanding}} officer was awakened by the navigator and informed that the ship {{was believed to be}} northward of the plotted track. Visibility was poor, and weather conditions prevented obtaining radio direction <b>finder</b> <b>bearings.</b> Continuous depthmeter soundings were taken, and all were in excess of 30 fathoms (55 m) except one sounding of 15 fathoms (27 m) which was obtained just prior to grounding. The signal, [...] "Emergency stop", to warn the other vessels was immediately given by searchlight, and the message. [...] "Wilkes aground do not know which side" [...] was broadcast on the TBS. The words, [...] "Wilkes aground", were also broadcast on the distress frequency. However, no message was received from Pollux or Truxtun until after these ships had also grounded. Wilkes found herself stranded to port of Pollux, Truxtun to starboard. About 07:00, Wilkes succeeded in backing clear of the beach. After seeing that Pollux had received help from , she left the scene. However, Pollux and Truxtun were totally lost, along with the 205 men who went down with them. The casualty list from the two lost ships was the Atlantic Fleets largest list of the war up to that time.|$|R
2500|$|Rochefort, with Huckins and Williams, states {{there were}} no dummy {{messages}} used at any time throughout 1941 and no effort by the Japanese to use serious deception. When asked after the attack just how he knew where Akagi was, Rochefort (who commanded HYPO at the time) said he recognized her [...] "same ham-fisted" [...] radio operators. (The Japanese contend that radio operators were left behind {{as part of the}} deception operation.) The critical DF-tracked radio transmissions show bearings that could have not come from the strike force. Emissions monitored from CAST, or CAST's report Akagi was off Okinawa on 8 December 1941, are examples, though some transmissions continue to be debated. The contention that [...] "low-powered" [...] radio (such as VHF or what the U.S. Navy called TBS, or talk between ships), might have been used, and detected, is contradicted as impossible due to the tremendous distances involved and when contact was lost, it was routinely presumed it was because low-powered radio and land line were being used. Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests for specific RDF reports remain wanting. [...] "A more critical analysis of the source documentation shows that not one single radio direction <b>finder</b> <b>bearing,</b> much less any locating [...] "fix," [...] was obtained on any Kido Butai unit or command during its transit from Saeki Bay, Kyushu to Hitokappu Bay and thence on to Hawaii. By removing this fallacious lynchpin propping up such claims of Kido Butai radio transmissions, the attendant suspected conspiracy tumbles down like a house of cards." ...|$|R
