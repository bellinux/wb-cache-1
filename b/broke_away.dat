5|$|AF. : The Third Division of the Football League {{became the}} Second Division after all {{clubs in the}} First Division <b>broke</b> <b>away</b> in order to form the FA Premier League.|$|E
5|$|The 1988 race {{contained}} a rare spectacle where {{an early morning}} breakaway group held on until the finish: 27 kilometres into the race a group of unknown riders <b>broke</b> <b>away</b> and the pack did nothing to chase them down throughout the race. It was on a section of cobblestones outside Roubaix that Thomas Wegmuller (SUI) and Dirk Demol (BEL) <b>broke</b> <b>away</b> from the lead group to try for the victory. As if {{the success of the}} breakaway wasn't enough, Paris–Roubaix was about to deliver a cruel irony.|$|E
5|$|Continuing to the Order's {{underground}} facility, Alex {{is captured}} by Judge Holloway, who reveals {{that everything that}} has happened {{is due to a}} broken pact. One hundred and fifty years ago, the four founding families <b>broke</b> <b>away</b> from Silent Hill's Order to move to Shepherd's Glen.|$|E
60|$|Angela stared, I say; and Bernard was staring, too. Then the latter, turning <b>away,</b> <b>broke</b> {{out into}} a tremendous, irrepressible laugh.|$|R
60|$|I breathed more freely. As soon {{as their}} hasty conference was over, the girl drew {{near to the}} brink of the precipice. She raised her hands as if pulling at an {{invisible}} rope: then she made signs to me to wait patiently, if wait I could, for that help was going to arrive shortly. After that, she <b>broke</b> eagerly <b>away</b> with a gesture of sympathy, and ran off in hot haste towards the winding path that led from the floor to the summit of the crater.|$|R
6000|$|... "Is this possible! I had imprudently trusted {{myself on}} the other side of the light-house, while the moon was behind clouds, and when they <b>broke</b> {{suddenly}} <b>away,</b> its light betrayed me to those on board the brig. Spike fired at me twice, without injuring me; when, to my astonishment, an answering report was heard from the islet. What is more, the piece was charged with a ball-cartridge, for I heard the whistling of the bullet as it passed on its way to the brig." ...|$|R
5|$|During the gunfight Norgrove's captors {{dragged her}} outside the {{building}} where she was being held, but she apparently <b>broke</b> <b>away</b> from them. Video footage of the raid showed an explosion in her vicinity; Norgrove was then found, injured, in a fetal position in a gully.|$|E
5|$|In 1930, the {{congregation}} became divided over {{the need for}} the Jewish community to hire a shochet to ritually slaughter animals for kosher meat, and over whether the synagogue should hire a Reform or Conservative rabbi. More traditional members <b>broke</b> <b>away</b> to form the Beth El Congregation, affiliated with Conservative Judaism.|$|E
5|$|In {{the same}} year, 1923, the Labour Party {{broke out of}} the Comintern. Subsequently the Communist Party <b>broke</b> <b>away</b> from the Labour Party. The {{local chapter of the}} Labour Party in Hamar decided to side with the Communist Party in November 1923, in a 123–22 vote. Arbeideren was then taken away from Labour, as the {{supervisory}} council decided by a 65 to 5 vote that it should follow the Communists. Arbeideren was one of thirteen Labour newspapers that <b>broke</b> <b>away</b> from the party and followed the Communists (one, Nordlys, later returned to Labour). Since 15 February 1924 the newspaper was published under the name Arbeideren og Gudbrandsdalens Arbeiderblad, as the Communist Party had seen fit to merge Arbeideren with Lillehammer-based Gudbrandsdalens Arbeiderblad.|$|E
5000|$|A {{group of}} people on the island of Hao in Polynesia tell a very similar story to the Tower of Babel, {{speaking}} of a God who, [...] "in anger chased the builders <b>away,</b> <b>broke</b> down the building, and changed their language, so that they spoke diverse tongues".|$|R
60|$|Fastolfe's hard-driven battle-corps raged on like an {{avalanche}} toward the waiting advance-guard. Suddenly these conceived {{the idea that}} it was flying in panic before Joan; and so in that instant it <b>broke</b> and swarmed <b>away</b> in a mad panic itself, with Talbot storming and cursing after it.|$|R
60|$|The {{birds and}} the monkey-people went north early in the year, for they knew what was coming; and the deer and the wild pig <b>broke</b> far <b>away</b> to the perished fields of the villages, dying {{sometimes}} before the eyes of men too weak to kill them. Chil, the Kite, stayed and grew fat, for {{there was a great}} deal of carrion, and evening after evening he brought the news to the beasts, too weak to force their way to fresh hunting-grounds, that the sun was killing the Jungle for three days' flight in every direction.|$|R
5|$|On 27 July 1936, Udet crashed the He 118 prototype, He 118 V1 D-UKYM. That same day, Charles Lindbergh {{was visiting}} Ernst Heinkel, so Heinkel could only {{communicate}} with Udet by telephone. According to {{this version of}} the story, Heinkel warned Udet about the propeller's fragility. Udet failed to consider this, so in a dive, the engine oversped and the propeller <b>broke</b> <b>away.</b>|$|E
5|$|The peloton {{remained}} intact for roughly {{the first half}} of the sixth stage. Luigi Ganna and Carlo Galetti <b>broke</b> <b>away</b> from the pack and made it to the finish in Rome where Ganna then edged out Galetti for the stage victory. During the next stage, a group of six riders lead for the most part before Galetti and Ganna <b>broke</b> <b>away</b> again. The two riders made their way to the finish in Genoa, where a large crowd of spectators came to see the finish. Ganna went on to win his second consecutive stage, while Galetti extended his lead over the rest of the field. The race's eighth stage contained some harsh climbs, most notably the Giovi. The finish of the stage was hotly contested as Galetti, Ganna, and Eberardo Pavesi finished at the same time, with Galetti winning the stage in the end.|$|E
5|$|But the {{agreement}} broke down a month later. In late June, the defeated {{king and his}} small retinue left their temporary capital for Pagan. But on 1 July 1287, the king was captured en route and assassinated by his second son Thihathu, the Viceroy of Prome. Anarchy ensued. Each region in the country which had not revolted <b>broke</b> <b>away.</b> No successor to Narathihapate, who could honor and enforce {{the terms of the}} treaty of Beijing, emerged. Indeed, a king would not emerge until May 1289.|$|E
60|$|His soul went {{black as}} he looked at her. He <b>broke</b> her hand <b>away</b> from his shirt collar, {{bursting}} the stud-holes. She recoiled in silence. And in one black, unconscious movement he was gone, down the garden and over the fence and across the country, swallowed in a black unconsciousness.|$|R
60|$|His veins fused {{with extreme}} voluptuousness. For {{a moment he}} almost lost control of himself, and {{continued}} automatically. But {{there was a moment}} of inaction, of cold suspension. He was not going to take her. He drew her to him and soothed her, and caressed her. But the pure zest had gone. She struggled to herself and realized he was not going to take her. And then, at the very last moment, when his fondling had come near again, his hot living desire despising her, against his cold sensual desire, she <b>broke</b> violently <b>away</b> from him.|$|R
5000|$|Intercity-Express {{trainset}} 51 was travelling as ICE 884 [...] "Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen" [...] on the Munich to Hamburg route; {{the train}} was scheduled to stop at Augsburg, Nürnberg, Würzburg, Fulda, Kassel, Göttingen, and Hanover before reaching Hamburg. After stopping in Hanover at 10:30, the train continued its journey northwards. About 130 km and forty minutes away from Hamburg and 6 km south of central Eschede, near Celle, the steel tyre on a wheel on the third axle of the first car <b>broke,</b> peeled <b>away</b> from the wheel, and punctured {{the floor of the}} car, where it remained embedded.|$|R
5|$|Heavy rain {{during most}} of the race made {{conditions}} difficult for the competitors. A group of five <b>broke</b> <b>away</b> during the final lap and worked together until the final sprint, where Nicole Cooke won the race. Cooke earned Great Britain's first medal at these Games and 200th Olympic gold medal overall. Emma Johansson of Sweden and Tatiana Guderzo of Italy, finishing second and third place with the same time as Cooke, received silver and bronze medals respectively.|$|E
5|$|Historically, the British and Irish Lions were {{intended}} as a representative team of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland however, when the Irish Free State <b>broke</b> <b>away</b> from the United Kingdom it was deemed inappropriate for the British and Irish Lions to use the British national anthem, God Save the Queen. As a result of this, the British and Irish Lions {{did not have an}} anthem to represent them before any of their matches until 2005.|$|E
5|$|In early August, a {{disturbance}} {{was observed in}} satellite images moving {{off the coast of}} Africa on August 4. Moving westward along the Intertropical Convergence Zone at a forward speed of roughly , the disturbance showed no signs of development until a cloud mass <b>broke</b> <b>away</b> from the ITCZ on August 6. The separated mass began rapidly organizing, becoming Tropical Depression Three late on August 7. The tropical depression continued to gain organization and was upgraded to a tropical storm on August 8, receiving the name Cora.|$|E
60|$|Suddenly a water snake wriggled {{across the}} dark pool above the ford, and the minnows {{disappeared}} {{under the shadow}} of the bridge. Then Will sighed, lifted his head, and walked on. There seemed to be something prophetic in it, and he drew a long breath. That's the way his plans <b>broke</b> and faded <b>away.</b>|$|R
50|$|Grimlock {{steadily}} {{grew more}} and more displeased with Optimus Prime's leadership, and eventually <b>broke</b> his Dinobots <b>away</b> from the main Autobot faction. After a prolonged period living in self-imposed exile, the news of Optimus Prime's death brought Grimlock back to the Autobots. After proving his worth by defeating the Decepticon Trypticon, Grimlock was elected leader of the Autobots.|$|R
6000|$|... "Bo's followin' the hound!" [...] ejaculated Dale. And, {{lifting his}} hands to his mouth, he sent out a stentorian yell that rolled up the slope, rang against the cliffs, pealed and <b>broke</b> and died <b>away.</b> Then he waited, listening. From far up the slope came a faint, wild cry, high-pitched and sweet, to create strange echoes, {{floating}} away to die in the ravines.|$|R
5|$|In {{order to}} give the strike teeth and to protect himself from harm, Verro {{became a member of}} a Mafia group in Corleone, the Fratuzzi (Little Brothers). However, during the great strike of the Fasci in September 1893, the Fratuzzi mobilized to boycott it, {{providing}} the necessary manpower to work on the lands that the peasants refused to cultivate. After that, Verro <b>broke</b> <b>away</b> from the mafiosi, and – according to police reports – became their most bitter enemy. He was killed by the Mafia in 1915 when he was the mayor of Corleone.|$|E
5|$|Lights and Sounds is {{the fifth}} studio album by American rock band Yellowcard, {{released}} on January 24, 2006, in the United States through Capitol Records. Lights and Sounds is Yellowcard's first concept album, which was inspired to reflect what the band was feeling {{at the time of}} production and how they have matured in the process. Lights and Sounds also departs from the sounds on Yellowcard's previous album, Ocean Avenue (2003), which <b>broke</b> <b>away</b> from its pop punk sound to a more alternative rock album.|$|E
5|$|On {{one side}} of the road is a barber surgeon whose sign advertises Shaving, bleeding, and teeth drawn with a touch. Ecce signum! Inside the shop, the barber, who may be drunk, haphazardly shaves a customer, holding his nose like that of a pig, while spots of blood darken the cloth under his chin. The {{surgeons}} and barbers had been a single profession since 1540 and would not finally separate until 1745, when the surgeons <b>broke</b> <b>away</b> to form the Company of Surgeons. Bowls on the windowsill contain blood from the day's patients.|$|E
60|$|The {{crescent}} of {{the beach}} was a serried series of hotels and lodging-houses, from tip to tip, but back of these were streets of homelike, smallish dwellings, that <b>broke</b> rank farther <b>away,</b> and scattered about in suburban villas, with trees and flowers and grass around them. Beyond stretched, {{as well as it}} could stretch among its hills, the charming country of fields, and woods, and orchards.|$|R
60|$|As {{he looked}} at their {{grotesque}} figures he struck his brow with his clenched fist {{to be sure that}} he was awake. The deck seemed to be much dirtier than when he had left it, and there were strange, sun-blackened faces turned upon him from every side. Not one of them did he know save only Joshua Hird. Had the ship been captured in his absence? Were these Sharkey's men who were around him? At the thought he <b>broke</b> furiously <b>away</b> and tried to climb over to his boat, but a dozen hands were on him in an instant, and he was pushed aft through the open door of his own cabin.|$|R
60|$|The barge was {{slipping}} at an easy pace through the water, {{the sun was}} bright, and the air cool, and everything pleasant and comfortable, until the chaperon, who had been repeatedly pushed <b>away,</b> <b>broke</b> through the charmed circle which surrounded the food and seized a fish. In the confusion which ensued he fell foul of the tea-kettle, and, dropping his prey, bit the skipper frantically, until driven off by his mistress.|$|R
5|$|The 16th-century English Reformation, {{during which}} the Church of England <b>broke</b> <b>away</b> from the {{authority}} of the pope and the Catholic Church, split the Southworth family of Samlesbury Hall. Sir John Southworth, head of the family, was a leading recusant who had been arrested several times for refusing to abandon his Catholic faith. His eldest son, also called John, did convert to the Church of England, for which he was disinherited, {{but the rest of the}} family remained staunchly Catholic.|$|E
5|$|The Aztecs are a {{small group}} of seven adult meerkats that was formed by Maybelline in the final episode of the third series when she <b>broke</b> <b>away</b> from the Whiskers. In the fourth series, the group is shown to now be a regular rival of the Whiskers. In the second episode, Zaphod and a band of roving males join the Aztecs, with Zaphod {{becoming}} the group's new dominant male. Right now, the Aztecs are left without a dominant male, since Zaphod has died.|$|E
5|$|The Skagen Painters were a {{group of}} Scandinavian artists who visited the area every summer from the late 1870s until {{the turn of the}} century. They were {{attracted}} by the scenery, the fishermen and the quality of light which encouraged them to paint en plein air following the example of the French Impressionists while sometimes adopting the Realist approach of the Barbizon School. They <b>broke</b> <b>away</b> from the rigid traditions of the Danish and Swedish art academies, preferring the modern trends they had experienced in Paris.|$|E
6000|$|... "I will fetch it," [...] Mrs. Renshaw <b>broke</b> in, hurrying <b>away.</b> [...] "No, Milly," [...] she said, as {{the child}} who had been ordered {{to stay with the}} basket came running to meet her. [...] "You must stay here for a little while. The natives have all run away, but your father is hurt and for a time must be kept quite quiet. I will send Wilfrid to sit with you." ...|$|R
60|$|Just then I heard a {{scarcely}} audible gurgle of water, {{and holding}} up my hand for silence, I turned {{and pointed to}} a ripple slowly widening out in a growing circle. It was not more than fifty feet from us. We kept perfectly quiet and waited. After a minute the water <b>broke</b> six feet <b>away,</b> and a black head and white shoulder showed in the moonlight. With a snort of surprise and of suddenly expelled breath, the head and shoulder went down.|$|R
60|$|Kaa looked {{carefully}} till {{he found}} a discolored crack in the marble tracery showing a weak spot, made two or three light taps with his head to get the distance, and then lifting up six feet of his body clear of the ground, sent home half a dozen full-power smashing blows, nose-first. The screen-work <b>broke</b> and fell <b>away</b> {{in a cloud of}} dust and rubbish, and Mowgli leaped through the opening and flung himself between Baloo and Bagheera--an arm around each big neck.|$|R
