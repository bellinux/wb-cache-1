5|$|But in the {{following}} seven months, Cairano records successive advances and balances for trophies in full production mode that does not affect his other works, whereas Tamagnino only realises two Caesars and seventeen leonine <b>busts.</b> The creation of leonine <b>busts</b> was considered repetitive and could be consigned to low calibre stonecutters, and Tamagnino was paid {{much less than the}} average payment received by Cairano for artefacts of the same type.|$|E
5|$|On August 30, 1493, Cairano was {{tasked with}} the {{decoration}} of {{the exterior of the}} Palazzo della Loggia with the delivery of capita 5 imperatorum romanum, or five <b>busts</b> for the beginning of a cycle of thirty Caesars, which would become among the finest achievements of his career. The production of these <b>busts</b> can be traced, in general, to a contemporary reworking of ancient portraiture. In the oldest <b>busts,</b> i.e., those facing the piazza, there are similarities with the image of Bartolomeo Colleoni in the memorial by Andrea del Verrochio in Venice, with an evoking of an effigy of Antoninus Pius and a portrait of Nero, all famous images at the time and here revived in three dimensions.|$|E
5|$|As {{president}} of the first government body created after the May Revolution, Saavedra is considered the first ruler of Argentina. However, as the Spanish juntas were not a presidential system, Saavedra {{was not the first}} President of Argentina; that office would be created a decade afterwards. The Casa Rosada, official residence of the President of Argentina, holds a bust of Saavedra at the Hall of <b>busts.</b>|$|E

5|$|Creangă {{inspired}} a 1920 painting by Octav Băncilă, which shows Creangă listening to Eminescu reading his poems. Two <b>busts</b> {{of the author}} were erected in Iași, respectively at his grave site and, in 1932, the gardens of Copou neighborhood. After 1943, another such piece was unveiled in Bucharest's Cișmigiu Gardens, as part of Rotunda Scriitorilor monument.|$|E
5|$|Later, {{with his}} {{reputation}} established, Rodin made <b>busts</b> of prominent contemporaries such as English politician George Wyndham (1905), Irish playwright George Bernard Shaw (1906), Socialist and former {{mistress of the}} Prince of Wales who became King Edward VII Countess of Warwick (1908), Austrian composer Gustav Mahler (1909), former Argentinian president Domingo Faustino Sarmiento and French statesman Georges Clemenceau (1911).|$|E
5|$|The obverse of {{the coin}} {{features}} jugate <b>busts</b> of Bibb, Alabama's first governor as a state, and the incumbent in 1919, Kilby. In so appearing, Kilby became the first living person depicted on a U.S. coin. Anthony Swiatek, in his volume on commemoratives, averred that the issuance was not controversial at the time, as the Act of May 16, 1866, that forbids the depiction of living people on currency was deemed to refer to paper money only, but Q. David Bowers wrote that the portrayal caused contemporary comment, for {{the position of the}} federal government (excepting some paper money issues of the 19th century) was that living people should not appear on U.S. money. A total of 22 stars flank the <b>busts,</b> symbolic of Alabama being the 22nd state; a message reinforced on those pieces bearing the inscription 2X2 in the obverse field. The X in that inscription alludes to the St. Andrew's cross on the flag of Alabama. The date, the names of the governors, and various other wordings appear towards the rim of the obverse.|$|E

5|$|The {{popularity}} of Rodin's most famous sculptures tends to obscure his total creative output. A prolific artist, he created thousands of <b>busts,</b> figures, and sculptural fragments {{over more than}} five decades. He painted in oils (especially in his thirties) and in watercolors. The Musée Rodin holds 7,000 of his drawings and prints, in chalk and charcoal, and thirteen vigorous drypoints. He also produced a single lithograph.|$|E
5|$|Atlanta's {{first draft}} pick was Patrik Stefan, taken first overall, in the 1999 NHL Entry Draft. He played seven {{seasons in the}} NHL, but has been {{called one of the}} biggest draft <b>busts</b> in league history. Two years after {{drafting}} Stefan, Atlanta again had the first overall pick and selected Ilya Kovalchuk. He became the Thrashers all-time leader in 10 statistical categories. He is the leader in goals, assists, points, shots on goal, overtime goals, power play goals, game-winning goals, and games played.|$|E
5|$|By 1900, Rodin's artistic {{reputation}} was entrenched. Gaining exposure from a pavilion of his artwork set {{up near the}} 1900 World's Fair (Exposition Universelle) in Paris, he received requests to make <b>busts</b> of prominent people internationally, while his assistants at the atelier produced duplicates of his works. His income from portrait commissions alone totaled probably 200,000 francs a year. As Rodin's fame grew, he attracted many followers, including the German poet Rainer Maria Rilke, and authors Octave Mirbeau, Joris-Karl Huysmans, and Oscar Wilde.|$|E
50|$|The <b>bust</b> was {{subjected}} to controversy and was viewed as self-glorification, especially by critics of the Marcos administration. The Ibalois viewed it {{as a symbol of}} their mistrust for government authorities since the construction of the <b>bust</b> displaced them from their lands. Communist insurgents also criticized the <b>bust's</b> construction, and many groups planned to destroy the <b>bust.</b>|$|R

50|$|Around 1978, the <b>bust's</b> {{construction}} begun along Marcos Highway, {{which was}} later officially renamed Aspiras-Palispis Highway. The <b>bust</b> was {{constructed by the}} Philippine Tourism Authority and {{was meant to be}} the centerpiece of Marcos Park. The <b>bust</b> was positioned near the peak of Mt. Shontoug so it could be seen by Baguio-bound motorists as far as 3 km away from the monument. Father and son, Anselmo Dayag Sr. and Anselmo Jr. were chosen to design the <b>bust</b> but the former died due to disease. Scaffolding covered with plywood was reportedly erected to deliberately hide the <b>bust's</b> construction from the public. A typhoon later blew the scaffolding away, exposing the <b>bust.</b> The Ibaloi were said to have been displaced due to the <b>bust's</b> construction. It was reported that they were forced to sell their lands for outrageously low prices. The <b>bust</b> was completed around 1980.|$|R
5|$|Extant {{documentation}} {{makes it}} possible to follow the competition more clearly than {{in the case of the}} shrine dei Miracoli, and the delivered works, their dates and respective payments lend themselves to interesting analyses. By Tamagnino's arrival in 1499, Cairano already had delivered at least five different Caesars and other stone material, but only a payment for a single bust is documented, because his attention was completely taken up with two gigantic angular trophies that he had recently begun. In November 1499, Tamagnino delivered four Caesars and three leonine <b>busts,</b> which showcased his calibre and scale of production.|$|E

(1) Distribution ratio of <b>bust</b> circumference per age and distribution ratio of differences of <b>bust</b> drops were analyzed. (2) Analysis of one-way design of experiment was carried out for 20 items of body sizes according to differences of <b>bust</b> drops with regard to age groups of 20 and 40 years old in consideration of tourists who are unspecified target and for the whole ages groups. (3) Comparison analysis of 20 items of body sizes per <b>bust</b> cir-cumference and according to level of differences of <b>bust</b> drops was carried out and (4) t-test {{of the two groups}} based on the standard of 12. 5 cm of the differences of <b>bust</b> drops was conducted and was analyzed. Tthe differences of <b>bust</b> drops below 10 cm were reduced according to ages. 12. 5 cm was the most in the group of ages of 20 s and under 7. 5 cm was reduced as ages were higher. Body items according to the differences of <b>bust</b> drops per ages had meaningful differences between groups except (acromion height-axilla height), height and shoulder length for the group of ages of 20 s and in the whole ages groups, there was meaningful difference between groups in all items except height and shoulder length. Com-parisons according to the differences of <b>bust</b> drops per section of 5 cm of <b>bust</b> circumference showed meaningful dif-ferences between groups in general in items of BMI, <b>bust</b> point-bust point, neck circumference, <b>bust</b> circumference, underbust circumference, neck point to <b>bust</b> point and weight. As the result of comparing the two groups of the dif-ferences of <b>bust</b> drops based on the standard of 12. 5 cm, all had meaningful differences except stature and shoulder length...|$|R

5|$|In the late-1930s it {{was decided}} to replace the pump and the centrepieces of the fountains. The new centrepieces, {{designed}} by Sir Edwin Lutyens, were memorials to Lord Jellicoe and Lord Beatty, although <b>busts</b> of the admirals, initially intended to be placed in the fountain surrounds were placed against the northern retaining wall when the project was completed after the Second World War. The fountains cost almost £50,000. The old ones were presented to the Canadian government and are now located in Ottawa's Confederation Park and Regina's Wascana Centre.|$|E
5|$|Many {{surviving}} funerary <b>busts</b> reached Western museums {{during the}} 19th century. Palmyra provided {{the most convenient}} Eastern examples bolstering an art-history controversy {{at the turn of}} the 20th century: to what extent Eastern influence on Roman art replaced idealized classicism with frontal, hieratic and simplified figures (as believed by Josef Strzygowski and others). This transition is seen as a response to cultural changes in the Western Roman Empire, rather than artistic influence from the East. Palmyrene bust reliefs, unlike Roman sculptures, are rudimentary portraits; although many reflect high quality individuality, the majority vary little across figures of similar age and gender.|$|E
5|$|P. l. spelaea or P. spelaea, {{known as}} the European cave lion, Eurasian cave lion, or Upper Pleistocene European cave lion, {{occurred}} in Eurasia 300,000 to 10,000 years ago.

A few had a ruff or primitive mane around their necks, possibly indicating males, but many scenes show hunting behavior (which would be the females).|$|E

5|$|The arch is {{constructed}} from local stone and was originally {{topped by a}} bronze chariot pulled by six horses. Statues of nymphs poured water into carved marble basins {{at the foot of}} the arch. Caracalla and Julia Domna were represented on medallion <b>busts,</b> though these have been defaced. The monument was reconstructed by the French between 1930–34. However, the restoration is incomplete and of disputed accuracy. The inscription on the top of the arch was reconstructed from the fragments noticed by Windus in 1722, which had been scattered on the ground in front of the arch.|$|E
