50|$|Adipic acid {{has been}} {{incorporated}} into controlled-release formulation matrix tablets to obtain pH-independent release for both weakly basic and weakly acidic drugs. It has also {{been incorporated into}} the polymeric coating of hydrophilic monolithic systems to modulate the intragel pH, resulting in zero-order release of a hydrophilic drug. The disintegration at intestinal pH of the enteric polymer shellac {{has been reported to}} improve when adipic acid was used as a pore-forming agent without affecting release inthe acidic media. Other controlled-release formulations have included adipic acid with the intention of obtaining a late-burst release profile. Adipic acid is used to make <b>bisobrin</b> an antifibrinolytic.|$|E
