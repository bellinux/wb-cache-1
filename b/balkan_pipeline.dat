[...] "South Stream" [...] refers to the <b>Balkan</b> <b>pipeline</b> cancelled by Russia in December 2014 after obstacles from the EU.|$|E

After crossing the <b>Balkan</b> Range, the <b>pipeline</b> will head 116.3 km in a northwesterly direction. After reaching the national northern half-ring, it will run 133 km in parallel to the existing East-West gas line and continue 86.5 km to northwest before reaching the Danube at Oryahovo. In Bulgaria, Nabucco will have interconnections with the national gas network and will have two off-take systems, compressor stations and pig stations.|$|R

After the failure of two major <b>Balkan</b> gas <b>pipelines</b> – the project “South Stream” and “Nabucco”, the project TAP (Trans-Adriatic Pipelines) definitely won the battle, becoming the largest gas project in the Balkans in the last 100 years. This project will turn Albania into a very important energy artery in Europe. This will significantly affect the dynamics of the economic development of Albania, creating over 15 thousand new jobs with the pipeline in the next five years and over a billion euros will be gained from tax transition in the next 20 years. TAP Project is currently predicted to have two branches of its own. The first one is the branch tube which will be connected to the main TAP pipeline in Greece and will continue through Bulgaria (180 kilometers long), and is also expected to continue through Romania and Hungary towards Central Europe. The other branch, the so-called – IAP (Ionian-Adriatic Pipeline), will supply Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia, while an additional branch of it will pass through Macedonia and Kosovo. There is no dilemma that this project will be very important not only for the development of the region, but also for its stabilization and integration...|$|R
