25|$|Academic {{dress is}} a {{traditional}} form of clothing for academic settings, mainly tertiary (and sometimes secondary) education, worn mainly <b>by</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> been admitted to a university degree (or similar), or hold a status that entitles them to assume them (e.g., undergraduate students at certain old universities). It {{is also known as}} academical dress, academicals, subfusc and, in the United States, as academic regalia.|$|E

25|$|The term {{itself is}} an Early Modern English {{spelling}} for magic, used in {{works such as}} the 1651 translation of Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa's De Occulta Philosophia, Three Books of Occult Philosophy, or Of Magick. Aleister Crowley chose the spelling to differentiate his practices and rituals from stage magic and the term has since been re-popularised <b>by</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> adopted elements of his teachings.|$|E
25|$|Harvesting {{is governed}} by {{regulations}} and requires a hunting license indicating the number of animals to be harvested, as well as post-hunting reporting of results (a jawbone with teeth). Such licenses can be obtained <b>by</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> established two years of residency. Special arrangements are made for tourists and trophy hunters. Information can be sought and licenses obtained (by application and payment) from the local municipality.|$|E
25|$|While most cryptozoologists {{recognize}} {{that at least}} some reports are simple misidentifications, they claim that many of the creatures described <b>by</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> seen them look nothing like the known species put forward by skeptics and claim that certain reports stick out. For their part, the skeptics remain unconvinced, pointing out that {{even in the absence of}} outright hoaxes, imagination has a way of twisting and inflating the slightly out-of-the-ordinary until it becomes extraordinary.|$|E

Such distortions from 'leaders' of organizations and parties is a disgrace not only to the organizations and institutions they serve, but to the First Amendment.|$|E
25|$|Self-{{consciousness}} and {{the consciousness}} of the apparent universe do not end after the dissolution of the ego and several chapters of the book are dedicated to the states of consciousness gained <b>by</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> transcended the ego. Also, most chapters of the book get into particular practices for the emancipation of consciousness from the ego, qualities that have to be developed by the individual, and examine important issues that have to be confronted in the process.|$|E
25|$|The plants {{flower in}} three {{distinct}} colours: white, yellow, and red. The flowers first appear in early May {{through the early}} summer in the Northern Hemisphere, and the fruits ripen from August through October. The fruits are typically eaten, minus the thick outer skin, after chilling in a refrigerator for a few hours. They have a taste similar to sweet watermelon. The bright red/purple or white/yellowish flesh contains many tiny hard seeds that are usually swallowed, but should be avoided <b>by</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> problems digesting seeds.|$|E

25|$|The arupa-jhanas (formless realm meditation) {{are also}} four, which are entered <b>by</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> {{mastered}} the rupa-jhanas (Arhats). The first formless dhyana gets to infinite space without form or colour or shape, {{the second to}} infinity of perception base of the infinite space, the third formless dhyana transcends object-subject perception base, while the fourth is where he dwells in nothing-at-all {{where there are no}} feelings, no ideas, nor are there non-ideas, unto total cessation. The four rupa-dhyanas in Buddhist practice lead to rebirth in successfully better rupa Brahma heavenly realms, while arupa-dhyanas lead into arupa heavens.|$|E
25|$|Thestrals are skeletal, winged horses, {{black in}} colour, {{which can only}} seen <b>by</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> {{witnessed}} death firsthand. They pull the Hogwarts school coaches and can also be tamed and ridden. This method of transportation was used in Order of the Phoenix, {{when members of the}} Dumbledore's Army needed to go to the Ministry of Magic to rescue Sirius Black, and also used when transporting Harry from the Dursleys' house to The Burrow in Deathly Hallows. Other magical birds have also been known to be flown; for instance Buckbeak the hippogriff by Harry, Hermione and Sirius in Prisoner of Azkaban.|$|E
500|$|The story {{contains}} many autobiographical elements, {{and the character}} of Olivero owes much to Read's experiences as {{an officer in the}} British Army during the First World War. The novel was positively received, although some commentators have considered it to be [...] "inscrutable", and one has suggested that it has been so differently and vaguely interpreted <b>by</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> given it serious study that it may lack the form and content to justify the praise it has received.|$|E

500|$|Some critics, like Mark Kinkead-Weekes and Margaret Doody, {{like the}} novel and emphasise the {{importance}} of the moral themes that Richardson takes up. In a 1987 article, Kinkead-Weekes admits that the [...] "novel fails at the [...] crisis" [...] and [...] "it must be doubtful whether it could hope for much life in the concluding volumes". However, those like Jean Hagstrum believe that [...] "Richardson's last novel is considerably better than can be easily imagined <b>by</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> only heard about it. But admittedly it represents a falling off after Clarissa". Morris Golden simply claims that the novel is a book for old men.|$|E
500|$|Baggio has {{described}} the miss as the worst moment of his career, stating it affected him for years. He later reflected, [...] "Penalties are only missed <b>by</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> the courage to take them." [...] Before him, two other Italians, Franco Baresi and Daniele Massaro, had already missed penalties. Having led Italy to the final, Baggio received the Silver Ball as the second-best player of the tournament, behind Romário, and the Silver Boot for finishing tied for second in goals scored. He was also named in the World Cup All-Star Team. Baggio finished runner-up for the Ballon d'Or, with 136 points from a possible 245, and third place for the FIFA World Player of the Year in 1994.|$|E
500|$|Wintour {{is often}} {{described}} as emotionally distant <b>by</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> come to know her well, even her close friends. [...] "At some stage in her career, Anna Wintour stopped being Anna Wintour and became 'Anna Wintour,' at which point, like wings of a stately home, she closed off large sections of her personality to the public," [...] wrote The Guardian. [...] "I think she enjoys not being completely approachable. Just her office is very intimidating. You have to walk about a mile into the office before you get to her desk and I'm sure it's intentional," [...] Coddington says. [...] "I don't find her to be accessible to people she doesn't need to be accessible to," [...] agrees Vogue publisher Tom Florio.|$|E

60|$|Now, besides this fact, that Lord Byron {{admitted}} {{a living}} illegitimate child born before Ada, we place this other fact, {{that there was}} a child in England which was believed to be his <b>by</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> every opportunity of knowing.|$|R
500|$|Pollin largely {{agrees with}} Todd, speculating that Imlay saw Percy Shelley in Bath and he [...] "somehow failed her", {{causing her to}} commit suicide. Seymour and others {{speculate}} that Shelley's only failure was {{to live up to}} his financial promises to Godwin and it was this that helped push Imlay over the edge; she was convinced, like her father, [...] "that the worthy have an absolute right to be supported <b>by</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> the worth to give". Todd, on the other hand, agrees with Pollin and speculates that Imlay went to see Mary Godwin and Shelley. Todd argues that Imlay had affection for Shelley and felt that his home was her only haven. Relying on scraps of poetry that Shelley may have written after Imlay's death, Todd concludes that Shelley saw her in Bath and rejected her pleas because he needed to protect Claire's reputation as well as his own at this time. Todd also notes that Imlay had worn her mother's stays, which were embroidered with the initials [...] "M.W.", and the nicest clothes she owned. She had adorned herself with a Swiss gold watch sent to her from Geneva by the Shelleys and a necklace, in order to make a good impression. After Shelley rejected her, Todd concludes, Imlay decided to commit suicide.|$|E
500|$|Territorial {{representative}} David Levy {{proposed a}} resolution that was passed in Congress in 1842: [...] "that the Secretary of War be directed to place before this House such information as can be obtained {{in relation to the}} practicability and probable expense of draining the everglades of Florida." [...] From this directive Secretary of the Treasury Robert J. Walker requested Thomas Buckingham Smith from St. Augustine to consult those with experience in the Everglades on the feasibility of draining them, saying that he had been told two or three canals to the Gulf of Mexico would be sufficient. Smith asked officers who had served in the Seminole Wars to respond, and many favored the idea, promoting the land as a future agricultural asset to the South. A few disagreed, such as Captain John Sprague, who wrote he [...] "never supposed the country would excite an inquiry, other than as a hiding place for Indians, and had {{it occurred to me that}} so great an undertaking, one so utterly impracticable, as draining the Ever Glades was to be discussed, I should not have destroyed the scratch of pen upon a subject so fruitful, and which cannot be understood but <b>by</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> waded the water belly deep and examined carefully the western coast by land and by water." ...|$|E
500|$|Caligari {{continues}} {{to be one of}} the most discussed and debated films from the Weimar Republic. Two major books have played a large part in shaping the perception of the film and its effect on cinema as a whole: Siegfried Kracauer's From Caligari to Hitler (1947) and Lotte Eisner's The Haunted Screen (1974). From Caligari to Hitler based its claims about the film largely on an unpublished typescript by Hans Janowitz called Caligari: The Story of a Famous Story, which gave Janowitz and Carl Mayer principal credit for the making of Caligari. Mike Budd wrote of Kracauer's book: [...] "Perhaps no film or period has been so thoroughly understood through a particular interpretation as has Caligari, and Weimar cinema generally, through Kracauer's social-psychological approach". Prior to the publication of From Caligari to Hitler, few critics had derived any symbolic political meaning from the film, but Kracauer’s argument that it symbolized German obedience toward authority and a premonition of the rise of Adolf Hitler (see the Themes section for more) drastically changed attitudes about Caligari. Many of his interpretations of the film are still embraced, even <b>by</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> strongly disagreed with his general premise, and even as certain claims Kracauer made have been disproven, such as his statement that the original script included no frame story. (See Writing for more.) Eisner's book placed Caligari into historical context by identifying how it influenced Expressionist features in other films of the 1920s.|$|E
