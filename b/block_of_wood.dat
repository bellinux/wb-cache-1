5|$|Stars is a wood {{engraving}} print; that is, it {{was produced by}} carving the artwork into the end grain of a <b>block</b> <b>of</b> <b>wood</b> (unlike a woodcut which uses the side grain), and then using this block to print the image. It was created by Escher in October 1948. Although most published copies of Stars are monochromatic, with white artwork against a black background, the copy in the National Gallery of Canada is tinted in different shades of turquoise, yellow, green, and pale pink.|$|E
5|$|Lazzell {{returned}} to Provincetown {{the following summer}} and requested that painting instructor, Oliver Chaffee, teach her the white-line woodcut technique innovated by B.J.O. Nordfeldt and adopted {{by a group of}} artists who had spent the previous winter in Provincetown. The white-line woodcuts were inspired by Japanese ukiyo-e woodblock prints, but only used a single <b>block</b> <b>of</b> <b>wood.</b> Designs were etched into the surface of woodblocks, with the incised lines separating sections of the blocks. The sections were individually painted and printed onto paper with the carved portions forming white lines. Lazzell and other artists specializing in the white-line technique formed the Provincetown Printers, an artist collective that later would earn national recognition. Toward the close of 1916 she traveled to Manhattan where she studied with Homer Boss and did an analysis of color with William E. Schumacher. Two of her pieces in the white-line style were exhibited in the Provincetown Art Association's annual show in 1917.|$|E

25|$|Wooden ship model hulls can be {{constructed}} in several ways. The simplest is a solid wood hull sawn and carved from a single <b>block</b> <b>of</b> <b>wood.</b> This method requires the greatest skill to achieve accurate results.|$|E
25|$|The billet is a rectangle, {{usually at}} least twice as tall as it is wide; it may {{represent}} a <b>block</b> <b>of</b> <b>wood</b> or a sheet of paper. Billets appear in the shield of the house of Nassau, which was modified to become that of the kingdom of the Netherlands.|$|E
25|$|The Scout {{is given}} a <b>block</b> <b>of</b> <b>wood</b> made of pine, four plastic wheels, and four nails. The {{finished}} car must use all nine pieces, must not exceed a certain weight (usually five ounces (150 grams)), must not exceed a certain width (usually 2-3/4 inches (7cm)) and length (usually 7 inches (17.8cm)) and must fit on the track used by that particular scout pack.|$|E

25|$|The {{difficulties}} {{attending the}} execution of this first order were such {{that they are not}} easily understood by present-day mechanics. Modern machine tools simply did not exist; the cylinders were bored by a chisel fixed in a <b>block</b> <b>of</b> <b>wood</b> and turned by hand; the workmen had to be taught how to do nearly all the work; and Baldwin himself did a great deal of it with his own hands.|$|E
25|$|The Ukrainian kobza was {{traditionally}} gut-strung, lute-like stringed {{musical instrument}} {{with a body}} hewn from a single <b>block</b> <b>of</b> <b>wood.</b> Instruments with a staved assembly also exist. The kobza has a medium length neck {{which may or may}} not have tied-on frets, which were usually made of gut. It was single-strung (sometimes also double-strung) and the strings were played with fingertips or occasionally with a plectrum threaded through a ring placed on the middle finger.|$|E
25|$|Forstner bits, {{also known}} as Forstner flange bits or webfoot augers, bore precise, {{flat-bottomed}} holes in wood, in any orientation {{with respect to the}} wood grain. Forstner bits can cut {{on the edge of a}} <b>block</b> <b>of</b> <b>wood,</b> and can cut overlapping holes. Because of the flat bottom to the hole, they are useful for drilling through veneer already glued to add an inlay. Forstner bits were invented and patented by Benjamin Forstner in 1874.|$|E

50|$|The {{origin of}} the {{nunchaku}} is unclear, although one popular belief is that nunchaku was originally a short South-East Asian flail used to thresh rice or soybeans. This {{gave rise to the}} theory that it was originally developed from an Okinawan horse bit (muge), or that it was adapted from a wooden clapper called hyoshiki carried by the village night watch, made <b>of</b> two <b>blocks</b> <b>of</b> <b>wood</b> joined by a cord. The night watch would hit the <b>blocks</b> <b>of</b> <b>wood</b> together to attract people's attention, then warn them about fires and other dangers.|$|R
50|$|Unlike the {{neighboring}} Phu Sian Temple, the Taoist temple {{is open to}} the worshipers and non-worshipers alike. A ritual among devotees is where one prays to the gods to grant one's wish. The ritual includes washing of hands, going inside the chapel barefoot and dropping two <b>blocks</b> <b>of</b> <b>wood.</b> If the <b>blocks</b> <b>of</b> <b>wood</b> are both face up then one could make a wish. If not then it is not yet the time for one's wish to be granted and one has to come to the temple some other time.|$|R
25|$|Vihuela {{bodies were}} lightly {{constructed}} from thin flat slabs or pieces of wood, bent or curved as required. This construction method distinguished them from some earlier types of string instruments whose bodies (if not the entire instrument including neck) were carved {{out from a}} solid single <b>block</b> <b>of</b> <b>wood.</b> The back and sides of common lutes were also made of pieces however, being multiple curved or bent staves joined and glued {{together to form a}} bowl, made from cypress with a spruce or cedar top.|$|E
25|$|Forstner bits, {{named after}} their inventor, Benjamin Forstner, bore precise, {{flat-bottomed}} holes in wood, in any orientation {{with respect to}} the wood grain. They can cut {{on the edge of a}} <b>block</b> <b>of</b> <b>wood,</b> and can cut overlapping holes. Because of the flat bottom to the hole, they are useful for drilling through veneer already glued to add an inlay. They require great force to push them into the material, so are normally used in drill presses or lathes rather than in portable drills. Unlike most other types of drill bits, they are not practical to use as hand tools.|$|E
25|$|Woodcut is {{a relief}} {{printing}} artistic technique in printmaking {{in which an}} image is carved into {{the surface of a}} <b>block</b> <b>of</b> <b>wood,</b> with the printing parts remaining level with the surface while the non-printing parts are removed, typically with gouges. The areas to show 'white' are cut away with a knife or chisel, leaving the characters or image to show in 'black' at the original surface level. The block is cut along the grain of the wood (unlike wood engraving where the block is cut in the end-grain). In Europe beechwood was most commonly used; in Japan, a special type of cherry wood was popular.|$|E

25|$|Through {{the autopsy}} and old photos, he becomes {{aware that she}} had been {{systematically}} putting Nic's shoes on the wrong feet, resulting in pain and deformity. She attacks him, accuses him of planning to leave her, mounts him, and then smashes a large <b>block</b> <b>of</b> <b>wood</b> onto his testicles, causing him to lose consciousness. The woman then performs a sex act on the unconscious man, culminating in an ejaculation of blood. She drills a hole through his leg, bolting a heavy grindstone through the wound, and then tossing the wrench she used under the cabin. He awakens alone; unable to loosen the bolt, he hides by dragging himself into the deep, dark foxhole {{at the base of the}} dead tree. Following the sound of a crow he has found buried alive in the hole, she locates him and attacks and mostly buries him with a shovel.|$|E
500|$|Unlike most cartoonists, Brown {{does not}} compose his pages, but draws each panel on {{separate}} {{sheets of paper}} and assembles them into pages afterwards. [...] The panels in Ed were on [...] squares of cheap typewriter paper, which he placed on a <b>block</b> <b>of</b> <b>wood</b> on his lap {{in lieu of a}} drawing board. [...] He used a number of different drawing tools, including Rapidograph technical pens, markers, crowquill pens and ink brushes. [...] He had some photocopies printed from his pencilled work, which he found both faster to produce and more spontaneous in feel.|$|E
500|$|On {{a smaller}} scale, human {{behaviors}} adversely affecting populations of bees, such as M. campanulae, can be mediated in other ways. [...] Many native bee species {{can be managed}} with minimal equipment. M. campanulae will nest in simple bee boxes. [...] These are constructed in simplest form by drilling holes in a <b>block</b> <b>of</b> <b>wood.</b> [...] The wood {{is attached to a}} post or wall, ideally in an area receiving adequate sun. [...] Holes of different diameter will be suited better for different bee species. [...] Since native pollinators forage in an area within about [...] of the nest, they can increase the productivity of a small garden.|$|E
50|$|The altar {{is filled}} with numerological symbolism. The five legs {{represent}} the Stigmata of Jesus Christ and are arranged {{in the form of}} a Greek cross. The outer dimensions form a cube, which is the simplest representation of three dimensions, three referring to the Holy Trinity and to the unity of God. Viewed from any side, the legs and top form a tau cross or T-cross. The mensa or top of the altar is composed of four groups <b>of</b> three <b>blocks</b> <b>of</b> <b>wood</b> each: Three stands for the Trinity and thus God and Heaven, four for the Earth (the four winds, four cardinal directions, four corners of the world, etc.). Three times four — thus connecting Heaven and Earth, God and man — makes twelve, the number of the Apostles, Twelve Tribes of Israel, and twelve gates of the New Jerusalem. In the middle of the mensa, surrounding the 12 blocks, is a cross made <b>of</b> three <b>blocks</b> <b>of</b> <b>wood,</b> which in turn is surrounded by a box made <b>of</b> four <b>blocks</b> <b>of</b> <b>wood</b> forming a cross potent, for a total of seven — the number of the Messiah.|$|R

500|$|Brown also {{acknowledges}} significant {{debts to}} Jack Jackson's historical comics, Hergé's The Adventures of Tintin, and the extremely exaggerated style of Larry Gonick's Cartoon History of the Universe. [...] He says {{he referred to}} Jack Hamm's How to Draw Animals when drawing the horses that appear frequently throughout the book, which were rendered running with their legs splayed, as an artist may have depicted them {{in the days before}} the influence of Eadweard Muybridge's photographs of bodies in motion. [...] Brown drew each of the 1325 panels separately on watercolour paper on a <b>block</b> <b>of</b> <b>wood</b> he placed on his lap in lieu of a drawing table, which allowed him seamlessly to rearrange, insert, and delete panels as he saw fit. [...] The drawings were finished using both a thin ink brush (no larger than size 0) and dip pen with a Hunt 102 nib and black ink.|$|E
