5|$|After Dong Zhuo's defeat, Cao Cao {{focuses on}} uniting the land. He is {{surrounded}} by enemies: Dong Zhuo's general Lu Bu has taken over all of Dong Zhuo's troops and taken Xiapi Castle; Zhang Xiu has rebelled in Wan Castle; to the north, Yuan Shao threatened to swallow the north whole. Cao Cao defeated Zhang Xiu at Wan Castle, with his guard Dian Wei holding foes back in the burning castle. Cao Cao, having escaped, defeats Lu Bu in alliance with Liu Bei at Xiapi in 198 AD, exterminating his army and gaining several officers. Cao Cao's final victory is at the Battle of Guandu in 200 AD, where he destroys Yuan Shao's army <b>before</b> <b>he</b> <b>even</b> arrives.|$|E
25|$|His {{personal}} impact, however, was twofold: {{his image}} as a warm, gentle and kind man captivated the whole world. This image was immediately formed when he {{was presented to the}} crowd in St. Peter's Square following his election. The warmth of his presence made him a much-loved figure <b>before</b> <b>he</b> <b>even</b> spoke a word. The media in particular fell under his spell. He was a very skilled orator.|$|E
25|$|His tenure faced budget shortfalls, tough {{economic}} times, and natural disasters such as hurricanes and floods. Easley received mixed reviews on {{his handling of}} fiscal problems in the state. His supporters claimed many of the budget shortfall situations were created <b>before</b> <b>he</b> <b>even</b> took office, during the Hunt administration, while his detractors criticized his support of raising sales taxes multiple times {{to cover the cost}} of new state programs.|$|E

25|$|It {{was around}} this time that Idema was being {{investigated}} for wire fraud and eventually convicted in 1994. Idema asserted that the fraud charges were fabricated by FBI agent Earl Edwin Pitts, who he claims supervised the case against him, in retaliation for Idema's earlier refusal to provide sources in the smuggling plot. However, the FBI began their investigation into Idema's activities as early as May 1991, <b>before</b> <b>he</b> <b>even</b> approached the Bureau about Lithuania. Furthermore, {{there is no evidence}} that Pitts was involved in any capacity in the fraud case against Idema.|$|E
25|$|West Ham had a {{slow start}} to the 2001–02 season, {{hampered}} by injuries to key players. New signing David James was injured <b>before</b> <b>he</b> <b>even</b> made an appearance whilst on International duty; Frédéric Kanouté, Michael Carrick and Paolo Di Canio nursed groin and knee problems. The board made money available for strengthening the squad, and Roeder acquired respected Czech international defender Tomáš Řepka from Fiorentina and Don Hutchison for his second term with the Hammers. However, Roeder was soon under immense pressure from fans, who were calling {{for him to be}} sacked, especially after witnessing back-to-back maulings at the hands of Everton (5–0) and Blackburn (7–1). He responded by guiding the club to a seventh-place finish in the final table, just one place short of European qualification– although there was a 12-point gap between West Ham and sixth-placed Chelsea.|$|E
25|$|However, {{even before}} the empire's {{external}} enemies were defeated, the two brothers fell to fighting each other with their armies. Upon {{the defeat of the}} Prince's forces by his brother the new emperor in 757, Li Bai escaped, but was later captured, imprisoned in Jiujiang, and sentenced to death. The famous and powerful army general Guo Ziyi and others intervened; Gou Ziyi was the very person whom Li Bai had saved from court martial a couple of decades before. His wife, the lady Zong, and others (such as Song Ruosi) wrote petitions for clemency. Upon General Guo Ziyi's offering to exchange his official rank for Li Bai's life, Li Bai's death sentence was commuted to exile: he was consigned to Yelang. Yelang (in what is now Guizhou) was in the remote extreme southwestern part of the empire, and was considered to be outside the main sphere of Chinese civilization and culture. Li Bai headed toward Yelang with little sign of hurry, stopping for prolonged social visits (sometimes for months), and writing poetry along the way, leaving detailed descriptions of his journey for posterity. Notice of an imperial pardon recalling Li Bai reached him <b>before</b> <b>he</b> <b>even</b> got near Yelang. He had only gotten as far as Wushan, when news of his pardon caught up with him in 759.|$|E

25|$|Australia's second innings began weakly, with Langer edging Agarkar to Patel <b>before</b> <b>he</b> <b>even</b> {{opened his}} account. Australia were then at 6/1. A window of {{opportunity}} opened up for the Indians. However, their hopes were soon evaporated by Matthew Hayden's crescendo of explosive and dynamic strokeplay. He hit the ball savagely, transferring his weight to the back foot often, and displayed clean and strong hits which sent the ball crashing to the fence. His powerful strokeplay ended in him stroking 99 from 98 balls. He reached 99 with a huge six off Ashish Nehra. The Queensland fans and the hayden family cheered and backed Hayden up to the hilt screaming out cheers to him, but he missed out the century when he top-edged a sweep to Sehwag at midwicket off Harbhajan. Hayden's knock was remarkable for the utter disdain he treated the Indian bowlers with. He was impervious {{to the efforts of}} the Indian bowlers, which was shown {{by the fact that he}} managed to treat even the good balls contemptuously. Of the 98 balls he faced for his 99, 51 balls were good length deliveries, which were dispatched for 52 runs. When the Indian bowlers pitched the ball slightly short, he was less destructive, hitting 12 runs off 30 such deliveries. In 17 other deliveries of which 8 were half-volleys and 9 were short balls Hayden hit 19 runs and 16 runs respectively, for a total of 35 runs from the other deliveries. He dominated almost every Indian bowler he faced, except Ajit Agarkar by scoring runs at more than a run-a-ball rate.|$|E
25|$|Kathy returns a {{few days}} later and meets with Ben, who is furious to see her again after several years of believing she was dead. He angrily {{declares}} that her absence is to blame for the current state of his life, declaring that he is the reason Phil has left due to his homosexuality, but Kathy tells him that she and Phil knew that he was gay <b>before</b> <b>he</b> <b>even</b> started school, and that they have always loved him. Ian later decides to rebuild his relationship with his mother and allows Kathy to move into his house. Gavin meets Kathy in Walford and reveals that he has kidnapped Phil and threatens to kill him if she does not follow his instructions and give him money. Kathy and Ben reluctantly agree to give into Gavin's demands, but after trying to steal Ian's safe, Kathy decides not to do so. Ian later tells Kathy that her grandson Bobby Beale (Elliot Carrington) killed Lucy. Kathy, after seeing Ben drunk and angry at her, confesses to Ian that she is still on the run and she and Ben were planning to con him as Gavin has kidnapped Phil, so Ian throws her out, thinking she cares more about Phil than him. Jane is horrified that he told Kathy about Bobby, but Ian is confident she will not say anything to the police. Kathy then goes to the police station to report the kidnapping, while Ben tells Ian what Gavin has done. Ian contacts Gavin, telling him he knows what he has been doing. It is subsequently revealed that he has been keeping Phil locked in his closet, but by the time Kathy and the police come to his house looking for him, he is not there although a fresh blood stain is found in the kitchen. Kathy later tells the Beales what she has done, and Sharon is incensed when she finds out the truth, insisting none of it would have happened if Kathy had not returned. Phil returns home severely injured and Ian allows Kathy to move back into his house. Gavin later holds Kathy, Ben and Phil hostage in their house and when Sharon confronts him, he reveals himself as her father before fleeing. Kathy is given a suspended sentence after pleading guilty to fraud.|$|E

500|$|By {{now one of}} {{the most}} {{anticipated}} prospects in all baseball, shirts depicting his nickname, [...] "The J-Hey Kid", were in high demand <b>before</b> <b>he</b> <b>even</b> played his first official major league game. [...] Fans and pundits prognosticated on a future Hall of Fame career, eliciting comparisons to former greats such as Darryl Strawberry, Willie McCovey and Willie Mays, among many others. In fact, [...] "The J-Hey Kid" [...] was drawn from Mays' own nickname, [...] "The Say Hey Kid." [...] On March 26, after leading the club in on-base and slugging percentages in spring training, the Braves named Heyward their starting right fielder.|$|E
500|$|Instead, {{he turned}} his {{attention}} to chronology and [...] "harmony," [...] the numerological relationships among music, mathematics and the physical world, and their astrological consequences. By assuming the Earth to possess a soul (a property he would later invoke to explain how the sun causes the motion of planets), he established a speculative system connecting astrological aspects and astronomical distances to weather and other earthly phenomena. By 1599, however, he again felt his work limited by the inaccuracy of available data—just as growing religious tension was also threatening his continued employment in Graz. In December of that year, Tycho invited Kepler to visit him in Prague; on January 1, 1600 (<b>before</b> <b>he</b> <b>even</b> received the invitation), Kepler set off in the hopes that Tycho's patronage could solve his philosophical problems as well as his social and financial ones.|$|E
500|$|Laucke's career spans over 50years, with {{concert and}} {{television}} appearances in 25countries, including England (Wigmore Hall), the U.S. (Carnegie Hall, and the White House), {{as well as}} China, on the Great Wall of China. Other countries where Laucke performed include Bulgaria, Hungary, Hong Kong, Spain, Israel, India, Japan, Morocco, Pakistan, and Russia. In Canada, he has given annual concerts at Montreal's Place des Arts since 1986. Following a concert in 1990 in Quebec City's Grand Théâtre de Québec, the French-language newspaper Le Soleil wrote a review entitled [...] "Michael Laucke makes one {{fall in love with}} the guitar", stating: [...] "More than a virtuoso, charismatic Michael Laucke is pure talent! For him playing is instinctive, just like breathing ...irresistible Michael Laucke." [...] Critics have often written about Laucke's stage presence.

He said {{that he does not}} draw [...] "bad guys" [...] so unscrupulous that it affects readers psychologically. This is not out of concern for others, but because he does not enjoy drawing such things. Few of his characters have screentone because he found it difficult to use. Toriyama was not concerned about consistency with the color of characters' clothes for the occasional color pages, having sometimes used different ones than he had <b>before.</b> <b>He</b> <b>even</b> specifically asked Torishima to produce as few color pages as possible.

500|$|Matthews played 22 reserve {{games in}} 1931–32, shunning the social scene {{to focus on}} {{improving}} his game. In one of these games, against Manchester City, he attempted to run at the left-back and take him on with a deft swerve as the defender committed himself to a challenge, rather than follow the accepted wisdom of the day which was to first wait for the defender to run at the attacker – his new technique [...] "worked a treat". The national press were already predicting a bright future for the teenager, and though he could have then joined any club in the country, he signed as a professional with Stoke on his 17th birthday. Paid the maximum wage of £5 a week (£3 in the summer break), {{he was on the}} same wage as seasoned professionals <b>before</b> <b>he</b> <b>even</b> kicked a ball. Despite this his father insisted that Matthews save this money, and only spend any winning bonus money he earned. He made his first team debut against Bury at Gigg Lane on 19 March 1932; the [...] "Potters" [...] won the game 1–0 and Matthews learned how physical and dirty opponents could be – and get away with it.|$|E
500|$|When {{football}} season {{arrived in the}} fall, Chappuis {{was one of many}} veterans who returned to college and the gridiron after serving in the war. Many of the returning veterans were not in prime football condition {{at the start of the}} 1946 season, and Coach Fritz Crisler [...] "predicted it might be November before ex-servicemen were adjusted physically and mentally to play their top game." [...] Chappuis later recalled that he was 23years old when he returned to school, and some of the returning veterans [...] "didn't know if they could get back into the rah-rah of college football, but Fritz took care of that. He really whipped us into shape." [...] Despite any difficulties in re-adjusting to civilian life and football, Chappuis broke Otto Graham's Big Nine Conference record for total offensive yards during the 1946 {{football season}}. Though reports differ as to Chappuis' total yards gained, University of Michigan records show that Chappuis gained 1,284yards in 1946—734yards passing, 501yards rushing and 49yards receiving. Chappuis set the new offensive mark in 1946 with a fractured bone in his wrist that he did not report until after the season had ended, at which time an operation was performed. Chappuis later said he knew the x-ray would reveal a fracture, and he would be benched <b>before</b> <b>he</b> <b>even</b> began. He delayed the examination until the season was over because [...] "the time to break into the lineup is prior to the first game. If I hadn't, there were so many capable candidates around who could have made good behind our front wall that I'd never have become a first-stringer by returning in the middle of the season." [...] Accordingly, Chappuis played the 1946 season with a fractured wrist and without even bothering to tape the wrist.|$|E
