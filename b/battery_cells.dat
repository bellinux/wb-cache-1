The lithium-ion battery of an i-MiEV caught fire at the Mizushima battery pack assembly plant on March 18 while connected to charge-discharge test equipment. Mitsubishi did not issue a recall, but halted production and sales of the two models until it determined the causes of the battery problems. According to Mitsubishi, the problem with the i-MiEV battery pack is related to a change in the GS Yuasa manufacturing process, and the carmaker notified fleet-vehicle operators with i-MiEVs whose batteries were made under the same process as those that overheated, and is working on a possible fix.|$|E

25|$|In 1916 it was {{suggested}} by naval planners to bring the CC-class submarines to the east coast. During 1917 that became a reality as the Admiralty ordered the two subs and Shearwater to Europe. On 21 June 1917 the three ships left Esquimalt. Off Cape Blanco, the fleet ran into a gale and CC-2 rolled heavily in the seas, seawater contaminating the sub's batteries. Half the crew was incapacitated by chlorine gas. The high seas also caused the propellers on both the submarines to be tossed out of the water, in turn causing the engines to over-rev.

The captured crewmembers later recounted to British naval intelligence interrogators what had happened—the depth charge explosions had almost rolled the boat over, knocked out all electrical power, smashed instruments, caused water leaks, and contaminated the air on the boat. The inexperienced crew believed the contamination to be chlorine, caused by acid from leaking <b>battery</b> <b>cells</b> mixing with sea-water, and the engine-compartment crew panicked and fled forward to escape the gas. Restoring electrical power—for the underwater electric motors and for lighting—would have been straightforward, yet there was nobody remaining in the engine compartment to do this. The submarine was {{dead in the water}} and in darkness. Rahmlow believed the chlorine would make it fatal to stay submerged so he resurfaced. The sea was too rough for the crew to man their anti-aircraft gun so they displayed a white flag to forestall another, probably fatal, depth charge attack from the Hudson—they were unaware the aircraft had dropped all its depth charges.|$|E
40|$|With their {{superior}} {{advantages of}} high capacity and low percentage of self-discharge, lithium-ion batteries, which are {{most commonly used}} as power sources for hand-held electronic devices, have become the most popular choice for power storage in electric vehicles. Due to the increased potential for long life of lithium-ion batteries in vehicle applications, manufacturers are pursuing methodologies to increase the reliability of their batteries. Methods are now being developed to monitor the health of lithium-ion batteries throughout their life cycle. The work in this thesis is focused on utilizing non-destructive vibration diagnostic testing methods to monitor changes in the physical properties of the lithium-ion battery electrodes, which dictate the states of charge (SOCs) and states of health (SOHs) of the <b>battery</b> <b>cell.</b> Inside a lithium-ion <b>battery</b> <b>cell,</b> lithium ions travel from cathodes to anodes during charge and reverse during discharge; these processes transfer matter from one electrode to another causing mechanical properties such as thickness, mass, and stiffness of the electrodes inside a <b>battery</b> <b>cell</b> to change at different states of charge; therefore, the detection of these changes will serve to determine the state of charge of the <b>battery</b> <b>cell.</b> As mass and stiffness of the electrodes change during charge and discharge, they will respond to the excitation input differently. An automated vibration diagnostic test is developed to characterize the state of charge of a lithium-ion <b>battery</b> <b>cell</b> by measuring the amplitude and phase of the kinematic response {{as a function of}} excitation frequency at different states of charge of the <b>battery</b> <b>cell</b> and at different times {{in the life of the}} cell. Also, the mechanical properties of the electrodes are obtained by direct measurements to estimate the thickness change at different SOCs and to develop a first-principles frequency response model for the <b>battery</b> <b>cell.</b> The correlation between the vibration test results and the model will be used to determine exact the state of charge of the cell. ...|$|R

40|$|Numerical {{simulation}} {{can be used}} {{to accelerate}} battery development and address safety concerns. By Xiao Hu, Lead Engineer, ANSYS, Inc. The lithium-ion battery is a preferred candidate as a source of power for the hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) and electric vehicle (EV) because of high energy density, high voltage, low self-discharge rate and good stability. HEV and EV applications require very large lithium-ion batteries, but, during high power extraction required to drive a vehicle, these large batteries may experience a significant temperature increase — which can lead to safety concerns. A properly designed thermal management system is crucial to prevent overheating and uneven heating across a large battery pack, which can lead to degradation, mismatch in cell capacity and thermal runaway. Design of the thermal management system requires knowledge of the cooling system as well as the amount of heat that will be generated by <b>cells</b> within the <b>battery</b> pack. Simulation can assist in thermal design at both the cell level (a single <b>battery</b> <b>cell)</b> and the system level (a battery module or a complete battery pack). On the <b>battery</b> <b>cell</b> level, the focus is on detailed heat generation and temperature distribution within a <b>battery</b> <b>cell</b> — information mainly used by manufacturers and battery researchers.

25|$|The British {{discovered}} that the depth charge damage to the U-boat was not critical—there were leaks {{in some of the}} ballast tanks and a small leak in a fuel tank. Around one third of the <b>battery</b> <b>cells</b> were cracked and the bow had been buckled. Water had leaked in through a valve that had been unseated by the explosions and through glass gauges that had broken; other damage was minor and no evidence of chlorine gas found. In his report, Colvin stated his opinion that {{there was no evidence of}} any damage control being carried out and that an experienced submarine crew would have been easily able to improvise repairs, stay submerged and likely evade the air-attack. After their surrender, the German crew had attempted to destroy instruments and fittings, but, with the exception of the wrecked radio and the damaged torpedo firing computer, the attempt appeared half-hearted and the damage was not significant. Also, useful papers had missed destruction. Copies of encrypted signals and their corresponding, plain-language, German texts were found—material of use to the British Enigma code breaking effort. A significant discovery was the U-boat commander's handbook, which provided context and background information for decrypted messages. The British, unfamiliar with German naval procedures, abbreviations and jargon, had ofttimes found German naval traffic hard to understand even when decrypted.|$|E
