25|$|Bourguiba, {{worried about}} his country's state, knew that a good cause would revive the {{national}} movement, weakened by the 1926 repressions. In order to do so, {{he was the only}} one to defend M'hamed Chenik, a Tunis notable, who had <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>trouble</b> with the Residence, the French colonial administration. Bourguiba jumped at the chance to rally the bourgeoisie class to the nationalist cause. But his attempt failed and ended up dividing L'Action team. In this context, the uprising following the Tunisian naturalization issue, in early 1933, was the perfect opportunity for him. He started another successful press campaign. With his friends Tahar Sfar, Mahmoud El Materi, Bahri Guiga and his brother M'hamed, they sensitized lower classes to their cause and changed the Residence policy. The popularity he acquired during the event, led to his election as a member of the executive committee of the Destour, in May 1933. However, differences with the elders caused him to resign from the party in September 1933.|$|E

Australia had <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>trouble</b> after losing two quick wickets to be 3/68, but Miller and Harvey counterattacked, adding 121 runs in 90 minutes, their batting likened by Wisden to a [...] "hurricane". Fingleton {{said that he had}} never [...] "known a more enjoyable hour" [...] of [...] "delectable cricket". Harvey was unperturbed by Miller's departure, hitting 11 from three {{consecutive}} balls. Australia went to lunch at 4/204, with Harvey on 70.|$|E
500|$|Immediately on {{his return}} to England Markham {{informed}} his father of his determination to leave the navy. One of the [...] reasons for his disaffection was {{the severity of the}} corporal punishment that was constantly administered for what in his view were trivial offences. He had <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>trouble</b> during his Collingwood service for attempting to prevent the flogging of a crewman. [...] He had also become disenchanted by the idleness that had occupied long periods of his service. With some regret the elder Markham consented to his son's request, and after taking and passing the gunnery part of the examination for the rank of lieutenant, Markham resigned from the service at the end of 1851.|$|E

The National Basketball Association (NBA) team, the Oklahoma City Thunder, signed him to multiple 10-day contracts in February 2010. The two brothers' uncle, Marvin Avery, said, [...] "There's some in our family that have <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>trouble,</b> but we always had Antonio and his brother [...] playing basketball or traveling somewhere to play basketball at all times." [...] When Anthony began playing at UMass, his younger brother became frustrated with basketball and wanted to play American football instead. However, Anthony and his uncles convinced him to continue playing basketball.|$|E

500|$|Although {{she worked}} well into her seventh month, Cardinale's {{pregnancy}} was kept a tight secret. Tormented by thoughts of suicide, {{she fell into}} a state of depression. When she thought she could no longer hide her condition, she asked Cristaldi to terminate her contract. Understanding her predicament, he sent her to London for the birth, far away from the press. He simply explained that she had gone to England to learn English for a film. Cristaldi told Cardinale not to reveal her condition as she would be betraying the public and it would put an end to her career. So as to maintain the secret, he drew up a detailed American-style contract covering every little detail of her life, depriving her of any possibility of acting on her own behalf. Cardinale explained: [...] "I was no longer master of my own body or thoughts. Even talking with a friend about anything that could make me look different from my public image was risky, {{as if it had been}} publicized, I would have <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>trouble.</b> Everything was in the hands of Vides". For seven years, Cardinale kept her secret, not only from the public, but also from her own son, Patrick, who grew up in the family with her parents and sister more or less as a brother until the day Enzo Biagi, a journalist, discovered the truth. After Cardinale decided to tell him everything, he published her story in [...] Oggi and L'Europeo.|$|E

2500|$|Sutton had a {{long career}} making moonshine and bootlegging. Sutton said he {{considered}} moonshine production a legitimate part of his heritage, as he was a Scots-Irish American and descended {{from a long line}} of moonshiners. In the 1960s or 1970s, Sutton was given the nickname of [...] "Popcorn" [...] after his frustrated attack on a bar's faulty popcorn vending machine with a pool cue. Before his rise to fame at around 60 years of age, he had <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>trouble</b> with the law several times, but had avoided prison sentences. He was convicted in 1974 of selling untaxed liquor and in 1981 and 1985 on charges of possessing controlled substances and assault with a deadly weapon, but he received only probation sentences in those cases.|$|E
2500|$|Additional {{evidence}} that the boat's men had known they had <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>trouble</b> {{was presented to the}} local county coroner. [...] Men searching the Ottawa County beaches for bodies found a bobbing, splintered plank or piece of board siding. On the wood was written, with pencil, a note: [...] "Worst storm I have ever been in. [...] Can’t stay up much longer. [...] Hope to God we are saved. A.L.A." [...] Albert L. Anderson was the ship's captain. [...] The note was treated as evidence by many, and deprecated by others. [...] Skeptics said that the ship's master, a man with forty years' experience on the Great Lakes (and thirty of them with captain's papers), would have been likely to try to write down the exact time the note was written, the condition of the boat at the time of writing, and the location of the boat as it labored through its final moments. [...] In any case, the coroner's inquiry into the vessel's sinking - which would have very much liked to have had this information - did not have it. [...] At the inquest, held September 24 in Grand Haven, the coroner's jury was forced to conclude that the lost boat had sunk for unknown reasons at an unknown location.|$|E
