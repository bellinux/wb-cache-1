5|$|Any true {{physical}} color can <b>be</b> <b>represented</b> by {{a combination}} of pure spectral colors. As physical colors can be composed of any number of physical colors, the space of physical colors may aptly <b>be</b> <b>represented</b> by a Hilbert space over spectral colors. Humans have three types of cone cells for color perception, so the perceivable colors can <b>be</b> <b>represented</b> by 3-dimensional Euclidean space. The non-unique linear mapping from the Hilbert space of physical colors to the Euclidean space of human perceivable colors explains why many distinct physical colors may be perceived by humans to be identical (e.g., pure yellow light versus a mix of red and green light).|$|E

5|$|Directed acyclic graphs {{may also}} be used as a compact {{representation}} of a collection of sequences. In this type of application, one finds a DAG in which the paths form the given sequences. When many of the sequences share the same subsequences, these shared subsequences can <b>be</b> <b>represented</b> by a shared part of the DAG, allowing the representation to use less space than it would take to list out all of the sequences separately. For example, the directed acyclic word graph is a data structure in computer science formed by a directed acyclic graph with a single source and with edges labeled by letters or symbols; the paths from the source to the sinks in this graph represent a set of strings, such as English words. Any set of sequences can <b>be</b> <b>represented</b> as paths in a tree, by forming a tree vertex for every prefix of a sequence and making the parent of one of these vertices represent the sequence with one fewer element; the tree formed in this way for a set of strings is called a trie. A directed acyclic word graph saves space over a trie by allowing paths to diverge and rejoin, so that a set of words with the same possible suffixes can <b>be</b> <b>represented</b> by a single tree vertex.|$|E
