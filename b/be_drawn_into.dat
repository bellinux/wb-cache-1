5|$|Kistiakowsky {{brought with}} him to Los Alamos a {{detailed}} knowledge of all the studies into shaped charges, of explosives like Composition B, and of the procedures used at the ERL in 1942 and 1943. Increasingly, the ERL itself would <b>be</b> <b>drawn</b> <b>into</b> the implosion effort; its deputy director Duncan MacDougall also {{took charge of the}} Manhattan Project's Project Q. Kistiakowsky replaced Neddermeyer as head of E (for explosives) Division in February 1944.|$|E
5|$|Politically, the Belgians did {{not trust}} the French. Marshal Philippe Pétain had {{suggested}} a French strike at Germany's Ruhr area using Belgium as a spring-board in October 1930 and again in January 1933. Belgium feared it would <b>be</b> <b>drawn</b> <b>into</b> a war regardless, and sought to avoid that eventuality. The Belgians also feared being drawn into a war {{as a result of}} the French–Soviet pact of May 1935. The Franco-Belgian agreement stipulated Belgium was to mobilise if the Germans did, but what was not clear was whether Belgium would have to mobilise in the event of a German invasion of Poland.|$|E
5|$|The film's plot {{follows the}} hunt by the public-security agency Section 9 for a mysterious hacker {{known as the}} Puppet Master. With the {{assistance}} of her team, Motoko Kusanagi tracks and finds their suspect, only to <b>be</b> <b>drawn</b> <b>into</b> a complex sequence of political intrigue and a cover-up as to the identity and goals of the Puppet Master. The overarching philosophical themes of the film include self-identity in a technologically advanced world. The music, composed by Kenji Kawai, includes an ancient Japanese language in a wedding song {{that serves as a}} key piece of music leading up to the climax of the film.|$|E
50|$|Teams {{from the}} same {{confederation}} <b>were</b> not <b>drawn</b> <b>into</b> the same group, therefore Egypt <b>was</b> <b>drawn</b> <b>into</b> Group B. Also as result, Italy and Spain <b>were</b> <b>drawn</b> <b>into</b> different groups.|$|R
50|$|The {{champions of}} the SuperLiga <b>are</b> <b>drawn</b> <b>into</b> the primary {{qualifying}} rounds for the UEFA Champions League, while {{the second and third}} placed teams <b>are</b> <b>drawn</b> <b>into</b> the primary qualifying rounds for the UEFA Europa League.|$|R
50|$|The 16 teams {{belonging}} to Class A of European women's football <b>were</b> <b>drawn</b> <b>into</b> four groups, {{from which the}} group winners qualify for the World Cup. The four runners-up <b>were</b> <b>drawn</b> <b>into</b> two home-and-away knock-out matches, winners of those matches also qualifying.|$|R
5|$|This, {{and other}} {{successful}} hit-and-run raids by American carriers in the South Pacific, showed {{that they were}} still a threat, although seemingly reluctant to <b>be</b> <b>drawn</b> <b>into</b> an all-out battle. Yamamoto reasoned that another air attack on the main U.S. Naval base at Pearl Harbor would induce all of the American fleet to sail out to fight, including the carriers. However, considering the increased strength of American land-based air power on the Hawaiian Islands since the December 7 attack the previous year, he judged that it was now too risky to attack Pearl Harbor directly.|$|E
5|$|Wisconsin, {{armed with}} heavy {{anti-aircraft}} batteries, performed escort duty for TF 38's fast carriers during {{air strikes against}} Formosa, Luzon, and the Nansei Shoto to neutralize Japanese forces there and to cover the unfolding Allied Lingayen Gulf operations. Those strikes, lasting from 3–22 January 1945, included a thrust into the South China Sea, {{in the hope that}} major units of the Imperial Japanese Navy could <b>be</b> <b>drawn</b> <b>into</b> battle.|$|E
5|$|A {{waterfall}} bong (or {{reverse bucket}} bong) is another method of smoking. It is assembled using a large plastic bottle (preferably about 2 liter), a bung or rubber stopper, a brass cut nozzle {{to act as}} a bowl and keep the marijuana (or other herbs) from entering the bottle, and an aerator screen. Once the bottle is filled to its neck in water the lid is screwed on, removing the rubber stopper and igniting the contents of the bowl leads to draining water to cause smoke to <b>be</b> <b>drawn</b> <b>into</b> the bottle. The cap is removed after the water has completely drained out, allowing the user to inhale the smoke.|$|E

5|$|In {{the summer}} of 479BC the Greeks {{assembled}} a huge (by ancient standards) army and marched out of the Peloponnesus. The Persians retreated to Boeotia and built a fortified camp near Plataea. The Greeks, however, refused to <b>be</b> <b>drawn</b> <b>into</b> the prime cavalry terrain around the Persian camp, resulting in a stalemate that lasted 11 days. While attempting a retreat after their supply lines were disrupted, the Greek battle line fragmented. Thinking the Greeks in full retreat, Mardonius ordered his forces to pursue them, but the Greeks (particularly the Spartans, Tegeans and Athenians) halted and gave battle, routing the lightly armed Persian infantry and killing Mardonius.|$|E
5|$|Instead of {{worrying}} about a possible Austrian threat, Frederick scattered his men facing eastward, the last known location of Daun's army. The troops created an S-shaped line, north to south, adjacent to Hochkirch. The weak (west) side was guarded by an outpost of nine battalions with artillery support; the principal purpose of the infantry was to maintain contact with a deployed scout unit. Eleven battalions and 28 squadrons guarded the east side. Frederick had his best soldiers garrison the village of Hochkirch. He did not believe any attack would occur; Daun's army had been dormant in recent months, refusing to <b>be</b> <b>drawn</b> <b>into</b> battles.|$|E
5|$|Lütjens {{then decided}} to move to a new area, as the {{surviving}} members of the dispersed convoy had sent distress signals. He chose the Cape Town-Gibraltar convoy route, and positioned himself to the northwest of Cape Verde. The two ships encountered another convoy, escorted by the battleship , on 8 March. Lütjens again forbade an attack, but he shadowed the convoy and directed U-boats to attack. A pair of U-boats sank a total of 28,488 tons of shipping on the night of 8–9 March. Malaya turned on the two battleships and closed to , well within the range of the Germans' guns, but Lütjens refused to <b>be</b> <b>drawn</b> <b>into</b> an engagement. He instead turned toward the mid-Atlantic, where Scharnhorst sank the Greek cargo ship Marathon. The two ships then refueled from the tankers Uckermark and Ermland on 12 March.|$|E

5|$|Stalin {{consulted}} with his frontline commanders and senior {{officers of the}} General Staff from 12 to 15 April 1943. In the end he and the Stavka agreed that the Germans would probably target Kursk. Stalin believed the decision to defend would give the Germans the initiative, but Zhukov countered that the Germans would <b>be</b> <b>drawn</b> <b>into</b> a trap where their armoured power would be destroyed, thus creating the conditions for a major Soviet counteroffensive. They decided to meet the enemy attack by preparing defensive positions to wear out the German groupings before launching their own offensive. Preparation of defences and fortifications began {{by the end of}} April, and continued until the German attack in early July. The two-month delay between the German decision to attack the Kursk salient and its implementation allowed the Red Army ample time to thoroughly prepare.|$|E
5|$|Surprised by Aberhart's {{refusal to}} <b>be</b> <b>drawn</b> <b>into</b> open conflict, the insurgents {{needed time to}} {{reassess}} their strategy. They got that time when, on March17, Lieutenant-Governor Primrose died, necessitating a five-day adjournment while the federal government selected a replacement. When the legislature reconvened March 22 or 23, the dissidents filibustered against the budget. Albert Bourcier opened debate, and was followed by, among others, Edith Rogers, Ansley, and Wilson Cain. On March24, Harry Knowlton Brown moved an adjournment, which was carried over the government's objections {{by a vote of}} 27 to 25. Though the insurgents considered this a vote of non-confidence in Aberhart's government, he refused to resign; he acknowledged, however, that he would do so if the budget itself was defeated.|$|E

5|$|Tantalum is {{also used}} to produce a variety of alloys that have high melting points, strength, and ductility. Alloyed with other metals, it {{is also used}} in making carbide tools for {{metalworking}} equipment and in the production of superalloys for jet engine components, chemical process equipment, nuclear reactors, and missile parts. Because of its ductility, tantalum can <b>be</b> <b>drawn</b> <b>into</b> fine wires or filaments, which are used for evaporating metals such as aluminium. Since it resists attack by body fluids and is nonirritating, tantalum is widely used in making surgical instruments and implants. For example, porous tantalum coatings are used in the construction of orthopedic implants due to tantalum's ability to form a direct bond to hard tissue.|$|E
5|$|The Flight Superintendent and the Technical Superintendent of ANA {{simulated}} some {{of these}} events during a test flight in another DC-4. They were satisfied that the time intervals between events were compatible with the likely sequence of events leading to {{the crash of the}} Amana, and that it was a plausible explanation of the accident. However, on legal advice this possible explanation of the crash was not made public. Two accidents involving Douglas DC-4s, one approaching Dublin Airport, Ireland, in 1961 and another approaching Stockport Airport, Manchester, United Kingdom, in 1967 were attributed to interruption of fuel supply when engines were supplied from the cross-feed system which was open to an empty fuel tank, allowing air to <b>be</b> <b>drawn</b> <b>into</b> the cross-feed pipe.|$|E
5|$|After the Soviet–Lithuanian Peace Treaty was {{ratified}} in 1920, the Russian SFSR recognized Lithuanian {{claims to}} the Vilnius Region and continued to support them. In its responses to the 1938 ultimatum, the Soviet Union expressed concerns over Lithuania's independence and threatened to abrogate the Soviet–Polish Non-Aggression Pact of 1932. It made it clear, though, {{that it did not}} wish to <b>be</b> <b>drawn</b> <b>into</b> an armed conflict. This stance has been attributed to the growth of a threat from Japan; armed assistance to Lithuania would have required the Red Army to invade either Poland or Latvia and could have resulted in a war on two fronts. The Soviets urged France, a major ally of Poland at the time, to de-escalate the conflict and encourage a more moderate version of the ultimatum. France and the United Kingdom, preoccupied with the Anschluss, pressured Lithuania to normalize the relationship with Poland as soon as possible. They feared that the ultimatum had been approved by Nazi Germany.|$|E

5|$|Stojanović and Ilić {{travelled}} illegally to Serbia {{during the}} summer break of 1912 to receive military training that National Defence organised for its members. They stayed for several days in Belgrade, the capital of Serbia, where they met Gavrilo Princip, another activist of Young Bosnia {{who was also a}} member of National Defence. Stojanović and Ilić then spent a month at army barracks in Vranje in southern Serbia, undergoing military training under the command of Vojin Popović, a famous Chetnik guerrilla fighter. When they returned to school, they resumed their activities with National Unity. Its members decided that Muslims should also <b>be</b> <b>drawn</b> <b>into</b> the association. After Trifko Grabež was expelled from the Tuzla gymnasium for slapping a teacher during a quarrel, the association organised a school strike. Most of the students who participated were Serbs; the strike gained little support among students of other ethnicities. The school took disciplinary measures against Ilić and Stojanović, who were regarded as the main organisers of the strike, and Ilić lost his scholarship.|$|E
5|$|The Greek {{states of}} Athens and Eretria allowed {{themselves}} to <b>be</b> <b>drawn</b> <b>into</b> this conflict by Aristagoras, and during their only campaigning season (498 BC) they {{contributed to the}} capture and burning of the Persian regional capital of Sardis. After this, the Ionian Revolt carried on (without further outside aid) for a further 5 years, until it was finally completely crushed by the Persians. However, in a decision of great historic significance, the Persian king Darius the Great decided that, despite successfully subduing the revolt, there remained the unfinished business of exacting punishment on Athens and Eretria for supporting the revolt. The Ionian Revolt had severely threatened the stability of Darius's empire, and the states of mainland Greece would continue to threaten that stability unless dealt with. Darius thus began to contemplate the complete conquest of Greece, beginning with the destruction of Athens and Eretria.|$|E
5|$|The Queen had {{to mediate}} between her {{brothers}} in 1555, when Charles decided to abdicate as emperor {{and leave the}} government of the Netherlands to his son Philip, despite Ferdinand's objections. When Mary learned of Charles's decision, she informed him that she too would resign. Both Charles and Philip urged her to remain in the post, but she refused. She chronicled the difficulties she had faced due to her gender, the fact that she could not act as she thought she should have because of disagreements with Charles, and her age. Furthermore, she did not wish to accommodate to the ways of her nephew after years of getting used to Charles's demands. The actual reason for Mary's resignation was her numerous disagreements with her nephew. She asked for Charles's permission to leave the Netherlands upon her resignation, fearing that she would <b>be</b> <b>drawn</b> <b>into</b> politics again if she remained.|$|E
