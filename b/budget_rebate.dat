We apply the model to Ireland only, in a simple comparative static simulation, and assume fixed prices. We focus more on methane reduction than GWP reduction as a whole, {{because most of the}} discussion regarding global warming from agriculture in Ireland has focused on methane. Our results suggest that the costs of methane abatement to the farming sector do indeed outweigh the global benefits, except in the case of very small methane abatements. However, if one also factors in the gains to society of the FEOGA <b>budget</b> <b>rebates,</b> then all losses disappear, and in fact net financial gains occur. We conclude that this may have implications for the design of methane reduction policies...|$|R

France {{gets more}} than twice as much CAP funds as the UK (22% of total funds {{compared}} to the UK's 9%) which in cash terms is a net benefit that France gets over and above what the UK gets from the CAP of €6.37bn. In comparison, the UK <b>budget</b> <b>rebate</b> for 2005 was scheduled to be approx €5.5bn. Agricultural expenditure for new member states is included in the 'other' segment of the graph. This was limited in 2004 to 25% of payment rates applying to existing member states, rising to 30% in 2005 and 100% in 2013. Total CAP expenditure is capped, so in the absence of further changes, payments to all the pre-2004 member countries will fall by 5% over this period. Some commentators claim that to a large extent, France gets twice the CAP payment received by the UK because it has twice the amount of farmland, although the extent to which there is a correlation between the two is disputed.|$|E

50|$|Goldfeder {{fulfilled}} one of {{his main}} campaign promises when, in 2012, he succeeded in having the Cross Bay Bridge rebate for Broad Channel and Rockaway re-inserted into Governor Andrew Cuomo's executive <b>budget.</b> The residency <b>rebate,</b> which was instituted in 1997 by then-Mayor Rudy Giuliani, credited residents' E-ZPass statements for round-trip tolls. However, the MTA partially rescinded the program in 2010 due to budget constraints. Under the plan secured by Goldfeder, residents of Rockaway and Broad Channel are reimbursed for all trips taken over the bridge from funds allocated in the state budget. Each year since assuming office, Goldfeder has reintroduced this legislation to maintain the residency rebate in the Executive Budget. Through 2014, he successfully kept the rebate in the state budget.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis article {{considers}} a mechanism based on rebates that aims at reducing congestion in urban networks. The framework helps select rebate levels so that enough commuters switch to modes {{that are under}} used. Indeed, getting a relative small number of drivers to switch to public transportation can significantly improve congestion. This mechanism is modeled by a Stackelberg game in which the transportation authority offers rebates, and participants factor them into the costs of each mode. A new Wardrop equilibrium arises when participants selfishly select one of the modes of transportation with the lowest updated costs. Rebate levels are chosen taking into account not only the potential reduction of the participants cost, but also the cost of providing those rebates. Part of the <b>budget</b> for <b>rebates</b> may come from the savings that arise from the more efficient use of capacity. We characterize the Stackelberg equilibria of the game, and describe a polynomial-time algorithm to compute the optimal rebates for each mode. In addition, we provide tight results on the worst-case inefficiency of the resulting Wardrop equilibrium, measured by the so-called price of anarchy. Specifically, we describe the tradeoff between {{the sensitivity of the}} owner towards rebate costs and the worst-case inefficiency of the system...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the problem of British {{attitude}} towards European integration. The relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union is described via the existence of a phenomenon of British European <b>budget</b> <b>rebate.</b> The <b>budget</b> <b>rebate</b> is a British reduction in price of the cost of contribution annually sent to the common European Union's budget. It was won by the Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in Fontainebleau Summit in 1984. The main reason for giving Great Britain this privilege {{was the fact that the}} UK was one of the biggest net contributor to the budget. On the other hand, the UK received too little from the budget because it had only a small agricultural sector. The European budget was aimed primarily for subsidising the European farmers. The UK's annual VAT-based contribution to the European budget is reduced according to a formula first set out in the Fontainebleau Agreement. This reduction is equal to 66 % of the difference between what the UK pay for the EC budget and the receipts, which the UK gets back. But, the rebate applies only as for spending within the EU and the British contribution is calculated as if the budget were financed only by VAT. The European Commission is responsible for determining and calculating the amount of the UK's abatement. It is generally calculated [...] ...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} an {{investigation}} of Britain’s negotiations of its EU <b>budget</b> <b>rebate.</b> It attempts to answer the main question of why Britain decided to reduce its rebate in the 2005 financial negotiation for the financial perspective for 2007 - 2013, instead of defending the rebate. What motivated Britain’s behaviours in the rebate negotiations? Drawing upon European integration theories, particularly Liberal Intergovernmentalism (LI), this thesis challenges LI’s lack of explanation {{of the role of}} domestic political parties in shaping the formation of a national preference, member states’ behaviours in inter-state bargaining, {{and the role of the}} presidency of the Council in EU institutions. This thesis emphasises the role of domestic political parties in shaping member states’ approach on European integration which affects member states’ behaviours within decision-making. In Britain, the governing parties’ ideologies are not only a lens to evaluate European integration but also bring about intra-party factions and cross-party factions in shaping Britain’s approach. In contrast to LI’s explanation of member states’ behaviours, this thesis adopts the constructivists’ argument of a ‘logic of expected consequentialism’ and a ‘logic of appropriateness’ in order to explain Britain’s behaviours in financial negotiations and argues that the governing party’s attitude is a decisive factor for Britain in choosing its behaviour from the two logics above. In addition, with regard to the debate between rational choice institutionalists and sociological institutionalists on the role of the presidency of the Council in EU decision-making, Britain is able to choose its behaviour in the role of the presidency as decided by the governing party’s approach. When Britain has pro-European approach and its preferences are a central issue in blocking a financial agreement, it may be that the UK presidency’s appropriate behaviour makes extraordinary concessions on their preferences to secure deals that will enhance their reputation as presidency. Since the time of Britain’s initial membership negotiations, this behavioural logic has been evident in the EU’s budgetary decision-making. In the 2005 financial negotiation, the UK presidency’s pro-European approach recognized that its rebate was a central issue in blocking the negotiation. Consequently, after lengthy and difficult negotiations, the UK presidency decided to make a concession about the reduction of the rebate in order to achieve the financial agreement...|$|E
40|$|This paper characterises the jointly optimal {{monetary}} and fiscal stabilisation policy {{in a new}} Keynesian model that allows for consumers who lacking access to asset markets consume their disposable income each period. With full asset market participation, the optimal policy relies entirely on the interest rate to stabilise cost-push shocks and government expenditure is not changed. When asset market participation is limited, there is a case for fiscal stabilisation policy. Active use of public spending raises aggregate welfare because it enables a more balanced distribution of the stabilisation burden across asset-holding and non-asset-holding consumers. The optimal response of government expenditure is sensitive to the financing scheme and whether the policymaker has access to a targeted transfer that can directly redistribute resources between consumers.

30|$|Bernstein [36] {{proposed}} a time-varying pricing scheme {{that includes a}} toll and a subsidy on the same routes. Commuters are charged if they arrive at the peak hour and are subsidized if they choose off-peak times. Over a simple network, it was demonstrated that the scheme could reduce the equilibrium cost. Adler and Cetin [37] discussed a redistribution scheme in which, revenue collected from a desirable route is transferred to drivers on a less desirable route. In contrast to the SO traffic pattern, they showed the redistribution scheme renders almost identical results. Guo and Yang [38] investigated the existence of Pareto-improving 4 TSS considering multiple users. In {{the presence of the}} restricting Pareto-improving condition, they show that the TSS problem always has a solution if a significant gap exists (The gap is the room for improvement and it refers to the difference in total travel time between the UE and SO traffic patterns). Even in a more restrictive scheme where no subsidy exists, the Pareto-improving solution exists [39, 40]. Furthermore, in a fashion reminiscent of the TSS, the revenue from tolling highway roads is used to subsidize the fare adjustments on transit lines. In a controlled environment, Ben-Elia and Ettema [41] investigated the impact of a reward scheme on the behavior of commuters in the Netherlands. The results suggest that the reward scheme can be certainly effective in the short run, while it has yet to be investigated in the long run. It is worth noting that, recently, the idea of using rewards to change commuters’ behavior has been implemented in the Netherlands—though in limited scale—as part of a program called Spitsmijden [41]. Using a bilevel Stackelberg game approach, Maillé and Stier-Moses [42] investigated a mechanism based on a pure subsidy (without any toll) that aims at reducing congestion in urban networks. They concluded that the subsidies can significantly lower the social cost and part of the <b>budget</b> for <b>rebates</b> may come from the savings that arise from the most efficient use of the system.|$|R
