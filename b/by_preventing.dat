5|$|It does so <b>by</b> <b>preventing</b> the {{formation}} of the initiation complex, composed of the 30S and 50S subunits of the ribosome, tRNA, and mRNA. Linezolid binds to the 23S portion of the 50S subunit (the center of peptidyl transferase activity), close to the binding sites of chloramphenicol, lincomycin, and other antibiotics. Due to this unique mechanism of action, cross-resistance between linezolid and other protein synthesis inhibitors is highly infrequent or nonexistent.|$|E

5|$|Two {{types of}} small ribonucleic acid (RNA) molecules– microRNA (miRNA) and small interfering RNA (siRNA)– {{are central to}} RNA interference.

5|$|Anderson et al. argue that, {{aside from}} acute care, {{emergency}} medicine can {{also play a}} significant role in public health. Vaccinations for many diseases such as diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis can be administered by emergency departments, patients can be targeted for specific interventions such as counseling for substance abuse, and conditions like hypertension can be detected and treated. Emergency departments are excellent locations to train health care providers and to collect data, because of the high number of patients. Emergency medicine also improves public health <b>by</b> <b>preventing</b> secondary disease developing from an initial presentation (initial symptoms), and it serves as the first line of defense in disaster scenarios.|$|E
5|$|High {{levels of}} both {{sugar and salt}} can {{preserve}} food <b>by</b> <b>preventing</b> micro-organisms from growing. Green beans can be salted by layering the pods with salt, but this method of preservation is unsuited to most vegetables. Marrows, beetroot, carrot, and some other vegetables can be boiled with sugar to create jams. Vinegar is widely used in food preservation; a sufficient concentration of acetic acid prevents the development of destructive micro-organisms, a fact made use of {{in the preparation of}} pickles, chutneys and relishes. Fermentation is another method of preserving vegetables for later use. Sauerkraut is made from chopped cabbage and relies on lactic acid bacteria which produce compounds that are inhibitory to the growth of other micro-organisms.|$|E

5|$|Meat ants {{have been}} {{observed}} blocking banded sugar ant nesting holes with pebbles and soil {{to prevent them from}} leaving their nest during {{the early hours of the}} day. The ants counter this <b>by</b> <b>preventing</b> meat ants from leaving their nest by blocking their nesting holes with debris, a behaviour known as nest-plugging. If meat ant nests are encroached by trees or other shade, banded sugar ants may invade and take over the nest, since the health of the colony may deteriorate from overshadowing. Members of an affected meat ant colony later move to a nearby satellite nest that is placed in a suitable area, while invading banded sugar ants fill nest galleries up with a black resinous material.|$|E
5|$|Planet Nine modifies {{the orbits}} of extreme trans-Neptunian objects via a {{combination}} of secular and resonant dynamics. The secular dynamics acts on very long timescales and causes {{the distance of the}} perihelia of anti-aligned objects to rise and fall while the directions of their perihelia oscillate. The resonant dynamics acts on shorter timescales and provides phase protection, maintaining the stability of the objects <b>by</b> <b>preventing</b> close approaches. The inclination of Planet Nine's orbit weakens this protection, resulting in a chaotic variation of semi-major axes as objects hop between resonances. The orbital poles of the objects circle that of the Solar System's Laplace plane, which is bent toward the plane of Planet Nine's orbit, causing their poles to be clustered toward one side.|$|E

Additionally, a large number of the control surfaces, such as the elevators, were equipped with a complex gearing system as a safeguard against accidentally over-stressing the surfaces or airframe at higher speed ranges.|$|E

The data suggest that the observed inhibition of growth by 5 -fluorouracil is due to inhibition of both ribonucleic acid and deoxyribonucleic acid synthesis. The data also allow inferences concerning pyrimidine interconversions in S. fimicola; i. e., thymine can be anabolized to thymidylic acid without first being demethylated, although demethylation appears to occur also...|$|R
