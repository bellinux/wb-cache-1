50|$|Lupin {{poisoning}} is {{a nervous}} syndrome caused by alkaloids in bitter lupins, similar to neurolathyrism. Lupin poisoning affects {{people who eat}} incorrectly prepared lupin beans. Mediterranean cultures prefer the historic <b>bitter</b> <b>lupin</b> beans with the required toxin-removal by traditional leaching in water preparation methods due to the better flavour that results. Improper preparation of bitter lupins with insufficient soaking allows pharmacologically significant amounts of the anticholinergic alkaloids {{to remain in the}} beans, and poisoning symptoms result.|$|E
40|$|One of {{the main}} {{principles}} of organic husbandry is that animal feed must be GMO free, and soya bean is well-known as a high risk GMO alimentary source. About 25 dry dairy cattle of the Italian Holstein breed, from the Cooperativa Emilio Sereni of Borgo S. Lorenzo (FI), were fed in two successive diets: the first with extruded soya bean (A), and the second in which <b>bitter</b> <b>lupin,</b> faba bean and proteinic pea substituted the soya bean (B). We evaluated both the consumption and the apparent digestibility (using acid insoluble ash as internal marker) of the two diets, repeating the trial twice. The presence of <b>bitter</b> <b>lupin</b> did not influence either the consumption of other feed, or the faecal water content. The apparent digestibility of the organic matter resulted satisfactory in both the diets, but was significantly higher in diet (A) than in diet (B) (71, 6 % vs 67, 3 %). In conclusion, even though we wish the cultivation of sweet lupin would be increase in Italy, we retain that also <b>bitter</b> <b>lupin</b> (mixed with other feed to increase the palatability) {{could be used as}} alternative protein source in dairy cattle diets...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} first to determine whether the chemical defence of lupin is more effective against the generalist aphids that occur on lupins than the host specific, M. albifrons. Secondly, to determine whether the host specific aphid shows an increase in performance over time if it is reared on sweet lupin and whether the process is reversed when transferred back to a <b>bitter</b> variety of <b>lupin.</b> Of the lupin cultivars tested only those with strongly reduced alkaloid contents were acceptable as host plants by the generalist species of aphid tested, and only M. albifrons reproduced on the “bitter” cultivars. In order to define the performance of M. albifrons, developmental time, mean relative growth rate and number of embryos were recorded for two strains reared for several generations on a <b>bitter</b> cv. of <b>lupin</b> and then transferred for several generations to sweet lupin and then reared again on a <b>bitter</b> cv. of <b>lupin.</b> The performance of M. albifrons was not better on lupins rich in alkaloids. However, the results also indicate that this aphid can adapt and thrive on a previously resistant cultivar within five generations even when reproducing parthenogenetically and that this change is reversible...|$|R
40|$|Lupinus mutabilis has protein (32. 0 – 52. 6 g/ 100 g dry weight) and lipid (13. 0 – 24. 6 g/ 100 g dry weight) {{contents}} {{similar to}} soya bean (Glycine max). The Ω 3, Ω 6, and Ω 9 contents are 1. 9 – 3. 0, 26. 5 – 39. 6, and 41. 2 – 56. 2 g/ 100 g lipid, respectively. Lupins {{can be used}} to fortify the protein content of pasta, bread, biscuits, salads, hamburgers, sausages, and can substitute milk and soya bean. Specific lupin protein concentrates or isolates display protein solubility (> 90 %), water-absorption capacity (4. 5 g/g dry weight), oil-absorption capacity (3. 98 g/g), emulsifying capacity (2000 mL of oil/g), emulsifying stability (100 %, 60 hours), foaming capacity (2083 %), foaming stability (78. 8 %, 36 hours), and least gelation concentration (6 %), which are of industrial interest. <b>Lupins</b> contain <b>bitter</b> alkaloids.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to test bitter and sweet lupin seeds for lipid-lowering and for their antioxidative activities in hypercholesterolemic rats. The levels of plasma lipid, malondialdehyde (MDA) and whole blood reduced glutathione (GSH), as well as the activities of transaminases (ALT and AST), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in plasma, superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) in erythrocytes and plasma glutathione reductase (GR), glutathione-S-transferase (GST) and catalase (CAT) were examined. A hypercholesterolemia-induced diet manifested in the elevation of total lipids (TL), total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), LDL-C and MDA levels, ALT, AST, LDH activities and the depletion of GSH and enzymic antioxidants. The supplementation of a hypercholesterolemia-induced diet with bitter and sweet lupin seeds significantly lowered the plasma levels of TL, TC, TG and LDL-C. ALT, AST and LDH activities slightly decreased in treated groups compared with the hypercholesterolemic group (HC). Furthermore, the content of GSH significantly increased while MDA significantly decreased in treated groups compared with the HC group. In addition, the <b>bitter</b> <b>lupin</b> seed group improved enzymic antioxidants compared with the HC group. In general, the results indicated that the <b>bitter</b> <b>lupin</b> seed supplements are better than those containing sweet lupin seeds. These results suggested that the hypocholesterolemic effect of bitter and sweet lupin seed supplements might be due to their abilities to lower the plasma cholesterol level as well as to slow down the lipid peroxidation process and to enhance the antioxidant enzyme activity. Este estudio fue diseñado para evaluar semillas de altramuces dulces y amargas como agentes que bajan los lípidos y estudiar su efecto en la actividad antioxidante en ratas hipercolesterolémicas. El nivel de lípidos en plasma, malondialdehido (MDA) y glutatión reducido (GSH), así como la actividad transaminasa (ALT y AST), lactato deshidrogenasa (LHD) en plama, superóxido dismutasa (SOD) y glutatión peroxidasa (GPx) en eritrocitos, glutatión reductasa (GR) en plasma, glutatión-S- trnasferasa (GST) y catalasa (CAT) fueron examinadas. La dieta inductora de hipercolesterolemia se manisfesto mediante la elevación de los lípidos totales (TL), del colesterol total (TC), de los triglicéridos, de la LDL-C y de los niveles de MDA, de las actividades ALT, AST, LDH y del descenso de GSH y enzimas antioxidantes. La suplementación de dietas inductoras de hipercolesterolemia con semillas de altramuces dulces y amargas bajo significativamente los niveles en plasma de TL, TC, TG y LDL-C. Las actividades ALT, AST y LDH decrecieron ligeramente en grupos tratados comparados con el grupo hipercolesterolémico (HC). Por otra parte, el contenido de GSH aumento significativamente mientras que el MDA decreció significativamente en los grupos tratados comparados con el grupo HC. Además, las semillas de altramuces amargas mejoraron las enzimas antioxidantes comparadas con el grupo HC. En general, los resultados indican que, el suplemento con semillas amargas es mejor que con semillas de altramuces dulces. Estos resultados sugieren que el efecto hipercolesterolémico del suplemento con semillas de altramuces dulces y amargas podrían ser debiadas a su capacidad para bajar los nivleles en plasma de colesterol, así como una ralentización del proceso de peroxidación lipídica y un aumento de la actividad enzimática antioxidante...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (MScAgric (Animal Sciences)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2005. The {{demand for}} protein for {{human and animal}} {{nutrition}} in South Africa is increasing and it will continuously increase. The effect of replacing soybean oilcake meal as protein source for broilers and full-fat soybean meal for weaner pigs, with different levels of sweet lupins (Lupinus angustifolius), canola oilcake and full-fat canola was examined. A basal diet with soybean oilcake as protein source was mixed with a diet using either sweet lupins or canola oilcake or full-fat canola in ratios of 100 %, 67 % and 33 % respectively. In the broiler trial the test diets were fed {{for a period of}} six weeks with or without the enzyme Vegpro (Alltech). Pigs were fed the test diets, with and without Roxazyme® enzyme, ad libitum from 8. 5 to 25 kg live weight. The fatty acid content of the fat pads of the broilers raised on the different diets was determined. The pigs were kept in the trial up to the grower- finisher phase. The fatty acid content of the carcass fat and muscle of pigs raised on the different diets was determined. The inclusion of enzymes had no effect on the growth, feed intake or feed conversion ratio of broilers fed the test diets. The provision of external dietary enzymes to the weaner pig diets failed to improve either dry matter intake or growth rate, but improved the feed conversion ratio. Broiler weights at six weeks of age were significantly higher for the control diet compared to the 20 % lupin diet. There {{was no significant difference in}} the feed intake as the lupin content of the diets increased. The feed conversion ratio did not differ significantly between the control diet and the 6. 6 % lupin diet but became significantly poorer as the lupin content increased to 13. 2 % and 20 % of the test diet. There were no significant differences in production performance of the control diet and the canola oilcake containing diet. The broiler weights at six weeks decreased significantly with each increase in the canola oilcake content of the diets. The feed intake of the 20 % canola oilcake diet at week six was significantly less than the intake of the control diet, but not significantly less than the 6. 6 % and 13. 2 % canola oilcake diets. The feed conversion ratio of the control diet was significantly better than the 13. 2 % and 20 % canola oilcake diets. No significant differences were found in week six between the 6. 6 % full-fat canola diet and the control diet for broiler weights and feed intake. The feed conversion ratio of the broilers fed the 13. 2 % and 20 % full-fat canola diets was significantly poorer than the control diet. The final body weights of the weaner piglets fed the control diet were significantly higher than the final body weights of weaner piglets fed the lupin containing diets. The average daily gain of the weaner piglets fed the control diet was significantly higher than the gain of the weaner piglets fed the lupin containing diets. No significant differences in the feed intake and feed conversion ratio between the different lupin inclusion levels were detected. There were no significant differences in body weight, feed intake, average daily gain and the feed conversion ratio, between the various full-fat canola containing diets and the control diet. A significant difference in body weight was found between the weaner piglets fed the 20 % canola oilcake diet and the weaner piglets fed the control diet. There were no significant differences in feed intake between the various inclusion levels of canola oilcake. The control and 6. 6 % canola oilcake containing diets had significantly higher average daily gains than the 20 % canola oilcake containing diet. In the final trial the finisher pigs fed the test diet containing 25. 00 % lupins, had a final body weight significantly lighter than the final body weight of the finisher pigs fed the other test diets. The finisher pigs fed the test diet containing 25. 00 % lupins, also had a significantly reduced average daily gain and feed intake. The feed intake of the 25. 00 % canola oilcake diet was significantly lees than the feed intake of the 16. 75 % full-fat canola containing diet. The feed conversion ratio of the 25. 00 % lupin containing diet was significantly poorer than the feed conversion ratio of the 16. 75 % lupin containing diet, 8. 25 % lupin containing diet, 16. 75 % full-fat canola containing diet, 25. 00 % canola oilcake containing diet and the control diet. In a choice feeding trial growing pigs were offered four diets with four different protein sources: sweet lupins (25 % inclusion level), canola oilcake (25 % inclusion level), full-fat canola (25 % inclusion level) and soybean oilcake (25 % inclusion level), while their daily intakes were recorded. In a second choice feeding trial pigs were offered ten different diets with increasing levels (6. 6 %, 13. 2 %, 20 %) of either sweet lupins, canola oilcake meal or full-fat canola meal. The pigs consumed significantly more of the soybean oilcake containing diet compared to diets containing the alternative protein sources. Pigs consumed significantly less of the full-fat canola diet compared to the sweet lupin and canola oilcake diets. Ten different canola cultivars were collected from two different locations in the Mediterranean rainfall area of South Africa namely the Western Cape (Swartland) and Southern Cape (Rûens) grain producing areas. The sinapine and glucosinolate content of various canola cultivars was compared and the influence of locality on the sinapine and glucosinolate content of the canola cultivars was determined. There were no significant differences (P < 0. 05) in sinapine content when the canola produced in the Western and Southern Cape were compared. Varola 54 and Rainbow cultivars had significantly higher (P < 0. 05) sinapine contents compared to the Varola 50 cultivar. Samples of lupins, field peas, faba beans and narbon beans were collected and analysed for amino acids, alkaloids, non-starch polysaccharides, tannin and starch. The digestible energy value of these alternative protein sources for pigs was determined. Significant differences were found in the amino acid content of the various crops. The alkaloid content of the lupins varied significantly between the sweet and <b>bitter</b> <b>lupin</b> varieties. Sweet L. angustifolius cultivars contained ca 50 mg/kg and the bitter L. angustifolius cultivars ca 15000 mg/kg alkaloids. The mean alkaloid content of L. albus cultivars was ca 1300 mg/kg. The faba beans, narbon beans and peas had significantly higher values for tannins and starch, compared to lupins...|$|E
5000|$|Lupinine is {{a bitter}} tasting quinolizidine {{alkaloid}} present in Lupinus species (lupins), plants {{of the family}} Fabaceae. The scientific literature contains many reports on the isolation and synthesis of this compound. The characteristically <b>bitter</b> taste of <b>lupin</b> beans, attributable to the alkaloids which they contain, renders them unsuitable for human and animal consumption. However, because lupin beans have potential nutritional value due to their high protein content, efforts {{have been made to}} reduce their alkaloid content, as well as to develop [...] "sweet" [...] varieties of Lupinus.|$|R
40|$|The present thesis {{deals with}} the {{technological}} aspects of the debittering process of lupin in a food sovereignty framework. Of all investigated lupin species,Lupinus mutabilishas the best nutritional composition, {{which is similar to}} that of soya bean (Glycine max). Lupins can be used to fortify the protein content of many products. In addition, specific lupin protein concentrates or isolates display functional properties of industrial interest (as emulsifier, gelling and foaming agent). On the other hand, <b>lupins</b> contain <b>bitter</b> alkaloids that have to be removed prior consumption because are toxic (the fatal acute dose of lupin alkaloids was reported as 10 mg kg - 1 body weight (bw) for infants and children, and 25 mg kg - 1 bw for adults). However, alkaloids also have medical uses for their hypocholesterolemic, anti-arrhythmic and immunosuppressive activity. <b>Bitter</b> <b>lupins</b> have been detoxified by biological, chemical or aqueous processes. However, our research concentrated on the aqueousprocessing because this is the only way to produce debittered lupin for human consumption in an environment-friendly manner. The process investigated involved soaking, cooking, and washing of the raw seeds. This process showed to be inefficient because it took 5. 7 ± 1. 0 days, used water at almost 62 times the weight of the raw dry and bitter lupine, and caused a 22 % loss of total solids, principally fat, minerals, and carbohydrates. In addition, the microbiological quality deteriorated during this debittering process. Mathematical modeling based on Fickian diffusion suggested that the diffusion coefficient of alkaloids would be expected to vary between 10 - 10 and 10 - 11 m 2 s - 1 because the process is carried out in unsteady conditions. In this scenario, it was clear that a new technology for debittering lupins is needed. For this purpose ahydro-agitator was designed, built and used to test the effect of different washing conditions on alkaloids content, solids in the product, final weight, processing time and water and energy consumption. Results were modeled and optimal processing conditions were inferred from a technological point of view; the optimum solution comprised 18 h of soaking, 1 h cooking, 3 changes of water/day and 22 h of agitation/day. For estimating the washing time a mathematic function was inferred (∂c / ∂t = kc;k= - 0. 188 - 4. 973 - 3 * Agitation – 0. 0043 * Changes - 1. 681 - 3 Agitation*Changes). Then, the products obtained from different processing conditions were evaluated by consumers on the basis of their willingness to pay in relation to their appreciation scores and product price. Results were modeled. Treatments with more processing increased the product price and diminished liking level. However, the willingness to pay is the combined effect of both variables. For example, people would accept an increase in price of 0. 3 $/kg if the liking level increases from “like slightly” to “like moderately”. The new developed technology could be used to optimize processes such as hydration and/or removal of undesired materials of legumes and other seeds. The approach used in this study also seems suitable to estimate relationships between processing conditions, liking, price and willingness to pay in other products. The generated information can be helpful in decision making, such as selection of consumers´ preferred process and liking in relation to pricing...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} a {{traditional}} Ethiopian lupin processing method on the chemical composition of lupin seed samples was studied. Two sampling districts, namely Mecha and Sekela, representing the mid- and high-altitude areas of north-western Ethiopia, respectively, were randomly selected. Different types of traditionally processed and marketed lupin seed samples (raw, roasted, and fi nished) were collected in six replications from each district. Raw samples are unprocessed, and roasted samples are roasted using fi rewood. Finished samples are those ready for human consumption as snack. Thousand seed weight for raw and roasted samples within a study district was similar (P > 0. 05), but it was lower (P 0. 05). The crude protein and crude fat contents of fi nished samples within a study district were higher (P < 0. 01) than those of raw and roasted samples, respectively. Roasting {{had no effect on}} the crude protein content of lupin seed samples. The crude ash content of raw and roasted lupin samples within a study district was higher (P < 0. 01) than that of fi nished lupin samples of the respective study districts. The content of quinolizidine alkaloids of fi nished lupin samples was lower than that of raw and roasted samples. There was also an interaction effect between location and lupin sample type. The traditional processing method of lupin seeds in Ethiopia has a positive contribution improving the crude protein and crude fat content, and lowering the alkaloid content of the fi nished product. The study showed the possibility of adopting the traditional processing method to process <b>bitter</b> white <b>lupin</b> for the use as protein supplement in livestock feed in Ethiopia, but further work has to be done on the processing method and animal evaluation...|$|R
40|$|Lupinosis {{of sheep}} has been {{sporadically}} investigated {{from the earliest}} times when the injurious nature of the <b>bitter</b> principle of <b>lupins</b> was recognized. During the last century, disease caused by the consumption of lupins was separated into two distinct entities: (i) that due to the alkaloids contained in the seed, and (ii) that associated with the consumption of lupin roughage and now termed ‘lupinosis’. The latter condition was investigated to some extent in Northern Germany beginning about 1860, and was {{shown to be a}} toxic liver degeneration. In Western Australia, lupinosis is limited essentially to sheep grazing dry standing lupins during the summer, its occurrence follow-ing periods of rainfall and high humidity. The main clinical and pathological features were described by BENNETTS ~ and GAR DINER^. This paper extends these earlier findings with particular emphasis on the histopathology of lupinosis, as seen in some 500 affected sheep during the course of 5 years. Materials and Methods Animals Material from three sources was available: (i) liver from affected sheep in natural outbreaks, (ii) controlled pen trials, contributing 118 sheep in 11 tests, and (iii) controlled field trials providing an additional 356 sheep in 33 tests on eleven properties. The sheep used in (ii) and (iii) were young, clinically healthy Merino wethers having no previous experience of lupins. Internal parasites were eliminated o...|$|R
