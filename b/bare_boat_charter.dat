Under urgent Presidential orders to support the forces in Bataan and Corregidor the Army began to prepare the ships to run the Japanese blockade of the Philippines. Cargoes were shipped to New Orleans for the three ships. They were originally due to sail on 28 February 1942 but difficulties, including securing naval gun crews [...] to put on the ships, delayed sailing. Masaya sailed on 2 March 1942, Matagalpa on 11 March and Teapa on 18 March. While the situation in the Philippines became desperate the three ships were forced to stop in Los Angeles for repair.

40|$|No single {{primary source}} exists to provide current and would-be {{participants}} in recreational <b>charter</b> <b>boat</b> {{operations in the}} United States with a basic legal understanding of their rights and obligations. The relevant federal maritime standards, laws, regulations, and judicial interpretations are scattered in isolated codebooks, reporters, and bulletins. Moreover, the governing body of law for <b>boat</b> <b>chartering</b> is admiralty law, which has been shaped throughout the centuries primarily by the traditions and dictates of the commercial shipping and shipbuilding industries. As a result, the logic behind the admiralty framework tends to be obscure when viewed {{in the context of}} a recreational <b>charter</b> <b>boat</b> operation. Nonetheless, a basic tenet of the American legal system is that the individual undertakes to ascertain and abide by the legal authorities applicable to his situation. This research compiles and synthesizes the significant legal requirements of the federal maritime law as they apply to <b>boat</b> <b>chartering.</b> Legal and historical background is provided where it is deemed essential to an understanding of the law. Examination of the legal relationships among the <b>charter</b> <b>boat</b> owner, the charterer, and the crew member reveals their duties, rights, and remedies in various types of charter arrangements. Preparation of this comprehensive overview of the federal maritime law in the context of recreational <b>boat</b> <b>charters</b> has exposed certain inconsistencies which lead to misconceptions about proper compliance. Analysis reveals certain areas of the law which are inappropriate and indeed burdensome for charter operations. Chief among these problems are the confusion surrounding and the stringency of the requirements for a bareboat charter. Exposure of the problem areas suggests directions to take when seeking legal solutions which fit the special characteristics and circumstances of a recreational <b>charter</b> <b>boat</b> operation...|$|R
