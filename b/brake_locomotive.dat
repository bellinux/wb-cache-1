25|$|On July 23, 2013, Transport Canada {{issued an}} {{emergency}} directive requiring {{at least two}} persons operate trains carrying tank cars of dangerous materials, prohibiting dangerous material trains left on the mainline unattended, requiring locomotive cabs on unattended trains be locked and reverser handles removed to prevent the train being put into gear, imposing requirements for setting hand brakes on trains unattended {{for more than an}} hour and requiring both the automatic brake (train brake) and independent <b>brake</b> (<b>locomotive</b> brake) be applied at their maximum force for trains unattended for an hour or less. A ministerial emergency directive remains in effect for six months, although it can be renewed.|$|E

5000|$|Auxiliary {{electrical}} supply is taken via a step-down chopper to a 525 V DC supply; {{there are four}} [...] (380 V max) three-phase inverters. Two of them supply variable speed and voltage power for cooling fans for the traction motors, transformer, rheostatic <b>brake,</b> <b>locomotive</b> main electronics block. Another one supplies fixed voltage and frequency (air compressor, oil pumps, other loads), the inverters are switchable with one unit providing redundancy. Additionally there are two 72 V 40 A inverters for battery charging.|$|E
50|$|During 1963-1965 the {{locomotives}} {{fitted with}} a Riggenbach counter-pressure brake, nos. 19 015 and 19 022, were converted into trials locomotives by the VES-M Halle trials depot. They served as <b>braking</b> <b>locomotives</b> during performance trials.|$|R
50|$|For <b>braking</b> the <b>locomotives</b> have a {{continuous}} {{air pressure brake}} of Knorr design, and in addition, a hand <b>brake</b> for the <b>locomotive</b> which works on the front wheel set.|$|R
50|$|A further area of use was in {{measurement}} and testing using <b>braking</b> <b>locomotives</b> to provide continuous load on railway vehicles being tested in normal running. For this niche activity a number of steam locomotives survived in Germany {{until the middle of}} the 1970s.|$|R
50|$|Because more {{electric}} locomotives were required {{as a result}} of the expansion of the network and the increase in traffic, the Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft issued a follow-on order for twelve E 91s in 1927 to cover the most pressing requirements. The locomotives were to be equipped with an electric brake for hauling heavy trains on long inclines. In addition the original design had to be changed in order to save weight. As a platform for testing the electric <b>brake,</b> <b>locomotive</b> E 95 02 was equipped with it on delivery.|$|E

50|$|After the Second World War, number 44 011 {{went to the}} Deutsche Bundesbahn and 44 012 to the DR. The DB engine, being a one-off, was {{retired as}} early as 1950. Number 44 012 was {{operated}} by the FVA Halle as a <b>braking</b> <b>locomotive</b> and not retired until 1962.|$|R
5000|$|As {{a result}} of the narrow Cape Gauge, there was {{insufficient}} space on the axles to accommodate disk <b>brakes.</b> The <b>locomotive</b> is therefore equipped with the older design tread brakes. In addition, the <b>locomotive's</b> <b>brake</b> system was modified so that the driver can isolate the <b>locomotive</b> <b>brakes</b> from the train brakes in situations where {{it is not necessary to}} activate the whole train's brakes.|$|R
50|$|The Deutsche Reichsbahn {{took over}} 135 {{locomotives}} into its Class 17.0-1 {{and gave them}} the running numbers 17 001-135. They were retired by 1935, however, due to their high fuel consumption. Only three examples (17 039, 102 and 107) survived the Second World War, as <b>braking</b> <b>locomotives.</b> The last S 10 was retired in 1954.|$|R
50|$|The Office had {{instrumentation}} vehicles, {{a rolling}} test bed with water <b>brakes</b> for <b>locomotives</b> and test rigs for various vehicle components.|$|R
50|$|A countersteam brake is a brake on a steam {{locomotive}} {{that uses the}} engine (specifically the cylinders) to help <b>brake</b> the <b>locomotive.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{handling}} {{of a train}} can also cause derailments. The vehicles of a train are connected by couplings; {{in the early days}} of railways these were short lengths of chain ("loose couplings") that connected adjacent vehicles with considerable slack. Even with later improvements there may be a considerable slack between the traction situation (power unit pulling the couplings tight), and power unit <b>braking</b> (<b>locomotive</b> applying <b>brakes</b> and compressing buffers throughout the train). This results in coupling surge.|$|R
50|$|This {{class was}} {{initially}} a faulty design, {{similar to the}} DRB Class 06, because of its poor boiler. Following replacement of the boiler {{and the introduction of}} mechanical stoking the true qualities of this locomotive became clear. As well as being used as <b>braking</b> <b>locomotives</b> for the Bundesbahn Central Office, in their final years numbers 45 019 and 45 010 were used time and again for those heavy goods train duties that the Class 44 locomotives had difficulties with.|$|R
50|$|The {{automatic}} Westinghouse air <b>brake</b> and the <b>locomotive</b> <b>brake</b> {{acted in}} both bogies {{to both sides}} of the driving wheels of each drive-axle. The idle-wheels did not have brakes. Each cab was equipped with a handbrake which acted to the respective bogie.|$|R
50|$|The {{automatic}} Westinghouse air <b>brake</b> and the <b>locomotive</b> <b>brake</b> acted over {{a separate}} brake cylinder {{to both sides}} of the driving wheels of each drive-axle. The idle-wheels did not have brakes. Each cab was equipped with a handbrake which acted to the respective bogie.|$|R
25|$|When {{the engine}} {{operator}} applies the brake by operating the <b>locomotive</b> <b>brake</b> valve, the train line vents to atmosphere at a controlled rate, reducing the train line pressure {{and in turn}} triggering the triple valve on each car to feed air into its brake cylinder. When the engine operator releases the <b>brake,</b> the <b>locomotive</b> <b>brake</b> valve portal to atmosphere is closed, allowing the train line to be recharged by the compressor of the locomotive. The subsequent increase of train line pressure causes the triple valves on each car to discharge {{the contents of the}} brake cylinder to the atmosphere, releasing the brakes and recharging the reservoirs.|$|R
50|$|In the {{earliest}} days of railways, trains were slowed or stopped by the application of manually applied <b>brakes</b> on the <b>locomotive</b> and in <b>brake</b> vehicles through the train, and later by steam power <b>brakes</b> on <b>locomotives.</b> This was clearly unsatisfactory, but the existing technology did not offer an improvement. A chain braking system was developed, requiring a chain to be coupled throughout the train, but it was impossible to arrange equal braking effort along the entire train.|$|R
50|$|<b>Braking</b> for <b>locomotive</b> {{and train}} was {{provided}} by a Westinghouse compressed-air brake. On the two prototypes the air pump was on the right, on the remaining locomotives it was installed on the left hand side.|$|R

50|$|For <b>braking,</b> the <b>locomotives</b> were {{originally}} {{equipped with a}} steam brake and counterweight brake. In addition the locomotives were fitted for Heberlein brakes. But by 1920 they were given the new Körting vacuum brakes for engine and train.|$|R
50|$|There are {{differences}} between the individual class members; locomotives 225 001-004 and 225 802-811 lack a hydrodynamic <b>brake.</b> The <b>locomotives</b> 215 030 to 215 032 also were transferred to this class. The auxiliary generator in these special examples was not removed.|$|R
50|$|All Mark 4 Control Cars have {{full-sized}} driving cabs with EMD locomotive type {{power and}} <b>brake</b> controls. <b>Locomotive</b> control is {{by means of}} an AAR system, modified by Iarnród Éireann (IÉ) to include control of train doors and operate with 201 Class locomotives.|$|R
50|$|The counter-pressure brake (German: Gegendruckbremse), {{also named}} the Riggenbach counter-pressure brake after its inventor, Niklaus Riggenbach, {{is a dynamic}} railway <b>brake</b> on steam <b>locomotives</b> that <b>brakes</b> the <b>locomotive</b> using the driving cylinders. In doing so it reduces wear and tear and {{overheating}} of the driving wheel tyres and brake blocks and enables a continuously high brake force to be applied. The brake works by using the cylinders as air compressors and converting kinetic energy into heat. Steam is emitted during braking {{but this does not}} come from the boiler, it is produced by evaporation of water used to cool the cylinders.|$|R
5000|$|Certain {{types of}} <b>braking</b> in steam <b>locomotives</b> that are conceptually {{comparable}} (using compression in the steam engine cylinders for braking) ...|$|R
50|$|Voyagers {{have both}} air and rheostatic brakes. They are fitted with Dellner couplers, like the Class 222, {{operated}} by East Midlands Trains and the Class 390 Pendolino electric trains used by Virgin West Coast meaning {{they can be}} coupled in rescue/recovery mode (air brake only) {{in the event of}} a failure. 220s and 221s can also be easily assisted by Dellner fitted Class 57s (Thunderbirds) {{in the event of a}} failure. By use of adaptive couplings a failed 220 or 221 can also be assisted by any air <b>braked</b> <b>locomotive</b> such as a Class 37, 47 or 66 or even an HST. The units can work in multiple with Class 221 units but not Class 222 units as the electrical connections of the Class 222 units are incompatible with the Class 220.|$|R
50|$|The 3100/3200 {{class were}} fitted with Davies & Metcalfe's P85 <b>brake</b> system. The <b>locomotives</b> are also fitted with Cutler-Hammer dynamic braking system.|$|R
25|$|As delivered, {{the only}} means of <b>braking</b> the <b>locomotive</b> was by {{operating}} a handbrake on the tender wheels. B 50 and B 108 were used in comparative trials of the Woods hydraulic and Westinghouse air brake systems in January 1884, with the Westinghouse system being later adopted as the standard.|$|R
5000|$|For {{operation}} on ramps its availability was indispensable because these dynamic <b>brakes</b> on steam <b>locomotives</b> provided the required third independent set of brakes.|$|R
5000|$|A {{steam brake}} {{is a type}} of <b>brake</b> for steam <b>locomotives</b> and their tenders, whereby a steam {{cylinder}} works directly on the brake linkages.|$|R
5000|$|Series 1 <b>locomotives</b> {{have four}} <b>braking</b> systems, air <b>brakes</b> for the <b>locomotive,</b> train air <b>braking,</b> a {{handbrake}} and dynamic rheostatic braking which can dissipate [...]|$|R
50|$|The {{braking effort}} {{achievable}} was limited, {{and an early}} development was {{the application of a}} steam <b>brake</b> to <b>locomotives,</b> where boiler pressure could be applied to brake blocks on the locomotive wheels. It was also unreliable, as the application of brakes by guards depended upon them hearing and responding quickly to a whistle for brakes.|$|R
5000|$|To {{begin with}} most of the {{locomotives}} had a steam brake that operated on the second and third coupled axles. The prototype locomotive, No. 736 [...] "KÄNZLI", was initially fitted with a Heberlein <b>brake(!).</b> Several <b>locomotives</b> were later converted to Westinghouse compressed air brakes, the one delivered in 1920, No. 1000, had this on delivery.|$|R
50|$|Originally the {{locomotive}} mounted a 7-position L-type Westinghouse brake controller and wheel-type <b>locomotive</b> <b>brake,</b> later {{replaced by the}} more common Oerlikon FV4 and RA-M2 levers respectively.|$|R
