5|$|At 10:00a.m., Coast Guard {{stations}} and United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Weather Bureau offices at Lake Superior ports raised white pennants above square red flags with black centers, indicating a storm warning with northwesterly winds. By late afternoon, the storm signal flags were {{replaced with a}} vertical sequence of red, white, and red lanterns, indicating that a hurricane with winds over 74mph (119km/h) was coming. (The word hurricane here does not refer to a tropical cyclone, but to Force 12 winds on the <b>Beaufort</b> <b>scale.)</b> The winds on Lake Superior had already reached 50mph (80km/h), and an accompanying blizzard was moving toward Lake Huron.|$|E
5|$|In late August, a {{tropical}} wave exited {{the west coast}} of Africa, developing into {{a tropical}} depression developed near Cape Verde on August28. It moved west-southwestward for two days before turning to the west. The depression is estimated to have intensified into a tropical storm on August31, and subsequently it turned to the west-northwest. On September2, the S.S. Umatilla reported winds up to force12 on the <b>Beaufort</b> <b>scale,</b> or hurricane strength; the ship also reported very high seas and a rapidly decreasing pressure. Based on the report, the Miami Weather Bureau office initiated advisories on Hurricane Carol about 750miles (1200km) east-northeast of Barbados.|$|E
5|$|After {{affecting}} the Turks and Caicos Islands, the hurricane {{passed through the}} Bahamas. The eye crossed over Nassau, where a barometric pressure of 938mbar (27.70inHg) was reported. Based on this observation, the hurricane is estimated to have had sustained winds of 140mph (220km/h). The hurricane struck without warning in the Bahamas, either washing ashore or sinking every ship but one in Nassau. In addition, strong winds downed trees and destroyed roofs. Every building in Nassau was damaged or destroyed. After moving through the islands, the hurricane curved northeastward, affecting dozens of other ships and wrecking four. On October4, it passed north of Bermuda, where it produced Force11 winds on the <b>Beaufort</b> <b>scale.</b> The hurricane was last observed on October5 to the southeast of Atlantic Canada. Along its path through the Turks and Caicos, the Bahamas, and the western Atlantic, the hurricane killed at least 383people, making it among the 100 deadliest Atlantic hurricanes as of 1997.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} the scientific <b>Beaufort</b> equivalent <b>scale</b> on the mean wind speed and standard deviations over the global oceans. Using the COADS Compressed Marine Reports 5, we correct each observation with Kaufeld’s scientific <b>Beaufort</b> equivalent <b>scale</b> and convert the wind speeds to a common 10 m reference level according to the stability of the surface layer. Our detailed calculations partially validate the statistical approach of previous authors who corrected winds based on monthly mean data. However, the effects of the corrections on nonlinear quantities such as wind stress are subtle and require the consideration of the individual ship observations...|$|R
40|$|<b>Beaufort</b> {{equivalent}} <b>scales</b> {{from the}} literature have been compared to find the scale that gives the most homogenous, internally consistent, combined anemometer and visual wind speed data from the Comprehensive Ocean–Atmosphere Data Set. Anemometer wind speeds have been height corrected using the individual anemometer height for each ship, where that could be identified, resulting in a more consistent dataset than that used in previous studies. Monthly mean 1 ° averages were constructed for visual and anemometer wind speeds separately from data between 1980 and 1990. The anemometer and visual means were compared where there were enough observations to give confidence in both means. The equivalent scale of Lindau was the most effective at giving similar anemometer and visual wind distributions from this mean dataset. The scale of daSilva et al. also performed well. The Lindau scale is, however, preferred because of its more rigorous derivation. The results for the different scales are in agreement with Lindau’s suggestion that the characteristic biases of earlier <b>Beaufort</b> <b>scales</b> {{could be explained by}} the statistical method of derivation...|$|R

50|$|In 1920 he was {{appointed}} Director of the Meteorological Office, London. He went on to be its longest serving Director, retiring in 1938. During his tenure as Director, he was engaged in research {{work in the fields}} of atmospheric electricity, ionization, radioactivity and solar radiation. He investigated the causes of lightning and in 1926 established the Simpson wind force scale, a modification of the <b>Beaufort</b> wind force <b>scale</b> which is the current standard scale used worldwide; still called the <b>Beaufort</b> wind force <b>scale.</b>|$|R
25|$|In 1971, Dr. Tetsuya Theodore Fujita {{introduced}} {{the idea for}} a scale of tornado winds.

25|$|The storm finally {{dispersed}} {{the formation}} {{when they reached}} the Pori parallel. Klas Horn, which was the lead ship of the formation, turned against the wind and headed towards the Swedish coast, followed by Hämeenmaa. The torpedo boats tried to follow the bigger vessels but were lagging behind due to the high waves. In the middle of the night, the wind speed reached hurricane force 48–55m/s (12 on the <b>Beaufort</b> <b>scale).</b>|$|E
40|$|We {{evaluated}} {{the loss of}} sensitivity due to the motion experienced by a hull-mounted transducer and its effects upon the estimated biomass of southern blue whiting (Micromesistius australis) in an acoustic survey conducted in the southeastern Pacific, off the Chilean coast, during the austral winter of 2009. Vessel motion data (pitch and roll) were registered in situ using a digital clinometer and used to correct the nautical area scattering coefficients (NASC) in elementary sampling units of 926 m distance by 10 m depth. These NASC correction factors (NASCcp) were calculated using Dunford's algorithm for circular transducers. We found high variability in NASCcp, which averaged 12 %, and ranged between 0 and 50 %. NASCcp variability was explained significantly by the mean depth of the integrated stratum (33 %), the weather condition, as measured by <b>Beaufort's</b> <b>scale</b> (5 %), and the vessel course relative to wind direction (2 %). The empirical model we used to explain NASC Cp variability may be suitable for correcting bias due to transducer motion in other, past and future, fisheries acoustic surveys targeting mid-water species under rough weather conditions...|$|R
40|$|The {{reliability}} of the Comprehensive Ocean–Atmosphere Dataset (COADS) Release 1 a 28 monthly winds is tested by comparing it with instrumental measurements in the northwest Atlantic from 1981 to 1991. The instrumental dataset contains anemometer measurements of a very high homogeneity and quality, which were taken by six research sister ships with known anemometer heights in the northwest Atlantic. Special data processing was made with instrumental samples to provide compatibility with the COADS winds. Comparison shows overestimation of the COADS winds in the low ranges and underestimation of the strong and moderate winds. Application of the alternative equivalent <b>Beaufort</b> <b>scales</b> does not remove this bias and {{makes it even more}} pronounced. Thus, the conclusion is made that the disagreement obtained results primarily from the uncertainties of anemometer measurements in COADS, especially from the incorrect evaluation of the true wind. Instrumental data also do not indicate significant long-term interannual changes, which are pronounced in the COADS dataset for the 1980 s. Some regional features of the comparison are discussed. 1...|$|R
50|$|Before the 1-5 {{scale was}} created in 1969 by the National Hurricane Center and later by the Bureau of Meteorology in Australia. Many {{tropical}} cyclones were simply ranked by the <b>Beaufort</b> Wind <b>Scale</b> which {{was created in}} the early 1800s by Francis Beaufort. The purpose of the scale was to standardize wind reports in ship logs. The scale was divided down into 14 forces (force 0 is calm while force 12 is hurricane).|$|R
25|$|The {{island is}} also notable for the bora wind (locally known as bura) which blows in gusts on average 203 days per year, and even reaches force of 11-12 on the <b>Beaufort</b> <b>scale</b> (indicating a violent storm or hurricane-force winds) 73 days per year, {{according}} to weather records {{which used to}} be kept by the lighthouse crew. Because of this, Prvić is considered the windiest Croatian island. Although the island is uninhabited, it is frequently used by shepherds for pasture and by local beekeepers who keep apiaries on the island. Prvić and parts of the nearby island of Krk are areas with the highest concentration of Common sage (kadulja) shrubs in the entire Croatian Adriatic, and honey produced by bees feeding on the plant's nectar is prized for its quality.|$|E
25|$|The German Meteorological Service {{had advised}} {{people to stay}} indoors and avoid {{unnecessary}} trips on 18 January, and wind strengths of up to 12 on the <b>Beaufort</b> <b>scale</b> were seen across the Netherlands and Germany as the storm made landfall. The storm moved across the German states of Lower Saxony, Bremen, Hamburg, Schleswig-Holstein and North Rhine-Westphalia first, then spread across the whole country in the evening hours of 18 January. Wind gusts as high as 202km/h (125mph) on the Wendelstein and 198km/h (123mph) on the Brocken in the Harz mountains were recorded. The storm then moved eastwards, its center crossing Lower Saxony between 18:00 and 19:00 CET, moving toward the Baltic sea, its cold front spawning several tornadoes in Germany, three {{of which have been}} confirmed as of 22 February. In the Czech Republic the highest wind speed was measured on Sněžka in the Krkonoše mountains, where wind gusts reached 212km/h (132mph). In the Czech Republic winds as high as 200km/h disrupted both rail and air traffic; record high temperatures reached 14°C (57°F) in Prague.|$|E
25|$|There were 36 {{people from}} North Albania who {{traveled}} from Shkodër to Vlorë {{carried in a}} closed van to Dhërmi. Each of them had paid 1500 euros to the traffickers in order to pass illegally to Italy's southern coasts. They embarked with two dinghy drivers and one trafficker, setting out at around 17:30 from the northern coasts of Dhërmi village on the stormy afternoon of 9 January, after it became completely dark. Half an hour after their departure both of the boat's motors stopped, possibly because of the over-load of passengers, {{as well as the}} difficult sea conditions. Returning was impossible. They were trapped by the sea that had a force of 6 on the <b>Beaufort</b> <b>scale,</b> despite being just 3 miles from Karaburun Peninsula's western shores. One of the motors started leaking fuel, burning some passengers. The people on board tried desperately to call their relatives and the police for help, and at 21:30 one of the dinghy drivers called Top-Channel TV. The boat filled with water but did not sink. Some passengers could not endure the cold and the burns and eventually died.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{example is}} the {{original}} <b>Beaufort</b> wind force <b>scale,</b> assigning a single number to observed conditions of the sea surface ("Flat", ..., [...] "Small waves", ..., [...] "Sea heaps up and foam begins to streak", ...), which {{was in fact a}} Guttman scale.

40|$|The {{wind force}} on the sea is often {{estimated}} by visual observation, using the <b>Beaufort</b> wind <b>scale</b> as standard. To know the fidelity of the visual observation, we examined the wind forces determined with a wind gauge (true wind force) for 261 cases in which visual estimates were wind force 3 (from 6. 5 to 10. 5 knots in wind velocity). The visual estimates agreed with the true wind force for about 80 % of the data. Although the wind force tended to be underestimated in fair winds and overestimated in adverse wind, the visual observation was accurate enough for practical work...|$|R

As the wind increases, a wall chart indicates the <b>Beaufort</b> Wind <b>Scale</b> and what could be expected of the winds that are being experienced.

An Il-76 is able to transport two of these vehicles {{at a time in}} comparison to three BMD-1s and BMD-2s. Its engine is the 2V-06-2; the same as the BMD-3. This engine develops a total power of 450 horsepower (hp). The BMD-4 is also fully amphibious with two water jets mounted {{on each side of the}} back of the hull and can swim at speeds of up to 10km/h in a <b>Beaufort</b> <b>scale</b> of 2. With a high power-to-weight ratio, the BMD-4 features superior acceleration in comparison to other infantry fighting vehicles. The maximum speed on a highway is 70km/h and the BMD-4 can maneuver on a 60° gradient and a 35° side slope. The BMD-4 can cross 1.8 m trenches and climb 0.8 m tall obstacles. This vehicle's suspension is hydropneumatic and giving an adjustable ground clearing of 130–530mm with the normal road clearance being 450mm. The clearance is changed by the driver and can be changed within 10 seconds.|$|E
500|$|Wind {{reports from}} ships at sea have become {{increasingly}} based on anemometers, and less so on the <b>Beaufort</b> <b>Scale.</b> [...] This {{is important to note}} as the <b>Beaufort</b> <b>Scale</b> underestimates winds at higher wind speeds, indicating ship wind observations taken for older storms are likely to underrepresent their true value.|$|E
500|$|Due to the {{importance}} of reports {{from the surface of the}} ocean, the voluntary observing ship program, known as VOS, was set up to train crews how to take weather observations while at sea and also to calibrate weather sensors used aboard ships when they arrive in port, such as barometers and thermometers. [...] The <b>Beaufort</b> <b>scale</b> is still generally used to determine wind speed from manual observers out at sea. Ships with anemometers have issues with determining wind speeds at higher wind speeds due to blockage of the instruments by increasing high seas.|$|E
40|$|Using {{individual}} {{observations from}} the COADS Compressed Marine Reports (Slutz et al. 1985), we have computed revised global climatologies and anomalies of wind stress and heat fluxes. The flux computations utilize a revised <b>Beaufort</b> equivalent <b>scale</b> for estimated wind speeds, use wind speed reduced {{from an average}} anemometer height to 10 m above sea level, and include Large and Pond (1981, 1982) transfer coefficients. The magnitude of the revised climatological mean wind stress is smaller than estimates by previous authors, particularly in the Northern Hemisphere extratropics. The revised heat fluxes appear to overestimate insolation and underestimate evaporation. Using linear inverse theory, we have constrained the heat fluxes to balance globally. These constrained heat fluxes produce heat transport in the Atlantic in agreement with oceanographic measurements...|$|R

500|$|Historically, {{a system}} has been {{classified}} as a depression if it {{is an area where}} the barometric pressure is low compared with its surroundings.

During 2015 another modification to the intensity scale took place, with the IMD calling a system with 3-minute maximum sustained wind speeds between 90–119kn (166–221km/h, 104–137mph): an extremely severe cyclonic storm. The United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center also monitors the basin, and issues warnings on significant tropical cyclones on behalf of the United States Government. These warnings use a 1-minute sustained wind speed and can be compared to the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale, however, regardless of intensity in this basin the JTWC labels all systems as tropical cyclones.|$|E

5000|$|Beginning on October 15, various {{tropical}} cyclone warnings and watches were issued for Hawaii, {{starting with a}} tropical storm watch for the Big Island. Three days later, a tropical storm warning was issued for Kauai and Niihau, and was extended to include portions of the Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument. The threat of the storm forced parks and beaches to close in the state. While passing south of Hawaii, Ana produced heavy rainfall {{on most of the}} islands, peaking at 11.67 in at Keaumo on the Big Island. The rains caused the Sand Island water treatment plant in Honolulu to overflow, which sent about 5,000 gallons of partially treated wastewater into Honolulu Harbor. Although no real-time wind reports of damage from Ana was reported on the Big Island, a post-storm report in November 2014 by resident Keith Robinson reported that there was damage in the southern vicinity of Niihau, Hawaii.
