5000|$|Gas stove (British English) - uses natural gas, propane, butane, {{liquefied}} {{petroleum gas}} or other flammable gas as a fuel source. Most modern stoves come in a unit with <b>built-in</b> <b>extractor</b> hoods.|$|R
50|$|An {{electric}} stove {{or electric}} range is a stove with an integrated electrical heating device {{to cook and}} bake. Electric stoves became popular as replacements for solid-fuel (wood or coal) stoves which required more labor to operate and maintain. Some modern stoves come in a unit with <b>built-in</b> <b>extractor</b> hoods.|$|R
50|$|Microwave ovens have {{a limited}} role in {{professional}} cooking, because the boiling-range temperatures produced in especially hydrous foods impede flavors produced by the higher temperatures of frying, browning, or baking. However, additional heat sources {{can be added to}} microwave ovens, or into combination microwave ovens, to produce these other heating effects, and microwave heating may cut the overall time needed to prepare such dishes. Some modern microwave ovens are part of over-the-range units with <b>built-in</b> <b>extractor</b> hoods.|$|R
5000|$|Modern kitchen stoves have burners {{on the top}} (also {{known as}} the [...] "{{stovetop}}" [...] or [...] "cooktop" [...] in American English and as the [...] "hob" [...] in British English) {{as well as an}} oven. A stovetop can refer {{to the top of a}} stove or burners built into a countertop. Many newer stovetops are made of glass-ceramic. A [...] "drop-in range" [...] is a combination stovetop-and-oven unit that installs in a kitchen's lower cabinets flush with the countertop.

40|$|A {{metallic}} obstruction in {{the root}} canal blocks canal cleaning and shaping procedures and requires either bypassing or retrieval. Many {{methods have been}} recommended to retrieve a metallic obstruction from the root canal. This article describes the retrieval of a metallic obstruction from the root canal of a premolar using Masserann technique to facilitate endodontic retreatment. Masserann technique {{is said to have}} limited application in posteriors. However, in this case, the obstruction was successfully retrieved by employing Masserann technique which consisted of using a trephan to cut the dentine and <b>extractor</b> <b>tube</b> to retrieve the obstruction. The retrieved obstruction was found to be a separated H-file. Endodontic retreatment was completed following the detection and negotiation of an extra canal in the same tooth...|$|R
50|$|From 1991 to 1998, Jensen {{was served}} as {{designer}} for Gaggenau Hausgeräte’s design programme. This comprised several ranges of products including ceramic hobs, <b>built-in</b> ovens, <b>extractor</b> hoods, dishwashers, washing machines, and tumble dryers. A {{number of these}} products received awards, primarily in Germany. These include the EB900 Built-in oven and CK494 Glass ceramic hob. In 1995, Gaggenau Hausgeräte was acquired by Bosch-Semiens Hausgeräte (BSH Hausgeräte).|$|R
50|$|In 1990, he {{purchased}} the Jacob Jensen Design studio {{and became the}} company’s CEO and Chief designer. Jensen developed the Jacob Jensen Design studio internationally, collaborating with numerous major companies including ECCO (Danish shoe manufacturer), Gaggenau Hausgeräte, Bang & Olufsen, Haier, LG, Panasonic, Steinway Lyngdorf (Steinway and Sons), Toshiba, Vertu, Lufthansa, and Volvo. From 1991 to 1998, Jensen worked as Chief designer for Gaggenau Hausgeräte’s design programme, where he designed ceramic hobs, <b>built-in</b> ovens, <b>extractor</b> hoods, dishwashers, washing machines and tumble dryers. A number of these products received awards including the EB900 Built-in oven and CK494 Glass ceramic hob.|$|R
40|$|Sediment {{transported by}} natural stream flow has often {{presented}} the irrigation and hydropower plant designer with major problems, and measures for solving the sediment {{problems have been}} proposed. Most of the proposed sediment exclusion measures have been developed based on certain basic hydraulic principles and experiences gained from field observations of typical structures. This qualitative approach together with hydraulic scale model studies have {{formed the basis of}} the design for several of the sediment exclusion devices. In recent years, several quantitative methods of design based on experimental and analytical approach have been proposed for some of the sediment exclusion devices. The availability of these quantitative design methods allows for setting up a comprehensive model on optimatisation of sediment exclusion devices. Such a model should allow to select an optimal combination of devices and operational rules to reduce sediment intake, considering also other aspects like irrigation and other system requirements. The development of the comprehensive model is the main objective of this study. Four commonly used sediment exclusion devices, namely tunnel excluder, tunnel <b>extractor,</b> vort ex <b>tube</b> and sandtrap (for which quantitative methods are available) are included. The evaluation is based on the trapping efficiency of sediment exclusion devices and the quantity of used water. The performance of a designed model to predict the efficiency of each sediment exclusion devices was evaluated. For this purpose, field data and an existing (more advanced) model were used for verifying. The evaluations were carried out by considering a range of parameters which are representative for the conditions met in most irrigation schemes and hydropower plants. The results of the evaluation show that the designed model gives a good result as far the trapping efficiency is considered. To test the developed model for its ability, it was used in optimising the design and operation of the proposed sediment exclusion devices of the Ye-U Irrigation Project in Burma. The test results show that the model is handy and capable for this purpose. The results can be included in water management. Finally some proposals for a further development of the model are given.
