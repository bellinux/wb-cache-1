Groves has to <b>bring</b> <b>together</b> <b>the</b> scientific, industrial and defense communities to build the atomic bomb. In 1945, following the death of Roosevelt, the new president, Harry S. Truman (Art Baker), continues to support the atomic project, now moved to Los Alamos, New Mexico.

5|$|Urban design {{management}} offers prescriptive advice for practitioners trying to organise city planning activities {{in a way}} that will increase sustainability by increasing satisfaction levels. Real estate development and urban planning often occur at very different decision-making levels. The practitioners involved may have diverse educational and professional backgrounds. They certainly have conflicting interests. Providing prescriptive advice for differing, possibly conflicting, groups requires construction of a framework that accommodates all of their daily activities and responsibilities. Urban {{design management}} provides a common framework to help <b>bring</b> <b>together</b> <b>the</b> conventional practices of urban and regional planning, real estate development, and urban design.|$|E
5|$|In the primary, Rhea {{achieved}} {{a plurality of}} the votes, but not a majority. Chandler had the next highest vote total, and the two faced {{each other in a}} run-off on September 7, 1935. In the run-off, Chandler defeated Rhea, securing the nomination for governor. President Roosevelt, not wanting Democratic factionalism to cost him votes in the 1936 presidential election, attempted to <b>bring</b> <b>together</b> <b>the</b> Laffoon and Chandler factions, but to little avail. Laffoon and Rhea, along with most of Laffoon's administration, bolted the party and supported Republican nominee King Swope. Despite losing the support of his predecessor, Chandler {{went on to win the}} general election. In his last days in office, Laffoon issued pardons for Denhardt and others charged in connection with the National Guard's interference with the primary in Harlan County. These were among a record 560 pardons issued by Laffoon, most of which were to relieve prison crowding.|$|E
