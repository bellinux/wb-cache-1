50|$|When {{there is}} a large amount of foreign {{material}} in the carpet, extraction with a wet process may be needed. Normally, the spin-bonnet method may not be as capable of sanitizing carpet fibers {{due to the lack of}} hot water, for this a special thermo machine is needed, here the <b>buffing</b> <b>machine</b> is equipped with a heating, to heat up the bonnet, but a post-cleaning application of an antimicrobial agent is used to make up for this. A small amount of water is required with spin-bonnet carpet cleaning. It only cleans the top of the carpet 1/8 inch but it is very fast for wide areas. However, bonnet cleaning is not the best mechanism for completely removing the chemical that is pre-sprayed onto a carpet. It is recommended that only surfactant free or encapsulating products are used.|$|E
5000|$|Dramatically {{increasing}} {{commodity prices}} {{has led to}} shortages of new tires. As a consequence, multimillion-dollar trucks can be idled for lack of tires, costing mines {{millions of dollars in}} lost productivity. This has led to a stronger effort to recycle old OTR tires. As of 2008, a new OTR tire can cost up to $50,000; retread tires are sold at half the price of new tires, and last 80% as long. Retreading an OTR tire is labor-intensive. First, the retreading technician must place the old tire in a <b>buffing</b> <b>machine</b> to remove what remains of the old tread; [...] "skiving" [...] follows this, which is the removal, by hand, of material the buffing misses. Next, the technician must inspect the tire, repairing defects. Lastly, the technician fills holes in the tire with rubber, applies a cement gum adhesive, and places the tire on a machine that will apply a new tread.|$|E

50|$|Early flapwheels {{were large}} {{diameter}} and {{intended for use}} on fixed <b>buffing</b> <b>machines.</b> They were used for deburring and polishing of castings, often instead of wire wheels. These cut faster, with less burnishing and surface contamination from the bristles.|$|R
5000|$|A {{wire brush}} wheel or buffing wheels can be interchanged with the {{grinding}} wheels {{in order to}} clean or polish workpieces. Stiff buffing wheels {{can also be used}} when deburring is the task at hand. Some <b>buffing</b> <b>machines</b> (buffers) are built on the same concept as bench grinders except for longer housings and arbors with buffing wheels instead of grinding wheels.|$|R
40|$|Two {{cleaning}} {{techniques were}} used for removal of co-deposits from the tested first mirrors exposed in JET: (a) ultrasonic bath; (b) {{a broad range of}} polishing conditions from manual <b>buffing</b> to <b>machine</b> polishing with the diamond grain size of up to 3 μm. Reflectivity measurements were performed after each step in the cleaning procedure. Surfaces were also examined with electron microscopy and ion beam analysis methods. Ultrasonic cleaning leads to partial recovery of reflectivity due to enhanced detachment of deposits. Typically 30 – 50 % of the original reflectivity was recovered in the visible light and 50 – 90 % in the infrared region. One mirror was cleaned completely. Polishing with diamond paste may lead to successful removal of deposits but the damage to the surface in case of the large diamond grains was observed. Recovery of up to 100 % of the initial reflectivity was achieved for some mirrors...|$|R
40|$|Turner House is a {{novel about}} loss, rich with the {{polyphonic}} voices of the mute, the despairing, the intransigent. Jesse, the younger of the two main male characters, midway through the book stops at an adult book and video store {{on his way to}} the airport. He 2 ̆ 7 s going back to California after a dismal homecoming in North Dakota. He 2 ̆ 7 s desperate to win back his former girlfriend, Kathy, and is anguished by feelings of loneliness and sexual craving. ^ He looked at the video tapes for sale and imagined a life locked in a room, locked away from others with only himself as victim and victimizer [...] . He felt his lust as a hammer to his head [...] . ^ Jesse focuses constantly on his place in the world relative to others. His is a sensual world, with all manner of crucial input to be monitored: looks, touches, smells, voices, all coming to him, he believes, through the focused and subjective agency of others. The other chief character, Charlie, is a middle-aged man who is equally influenced by myriad stimuli, especially sound. He doesn 2 ̆ 7 t pursue human contact, but instead seeks an autonomous and remote primal influence. ^ (He felt) words, sounds, pulsations along his neck, back and scalp. His <b>buffing</b> <b>machine</b> became a staticky cloak around his head. Sounds were always sensations. Especially when someone else was in charge of the sound, like the woman at the library, the large, middle-aged woman who ran the vacuum cleaner around his outstretched feet while he sat quietly, listening, pretending to read, letting the sound run over him. ^ The language of the novel focuses on sounds: of voices and midnight winds and trains chugging uphill in the Cascades, with alliteration and polysyndeton and run-on sentences drawing the story forward in an obsessive meander that mimics the Pacific Starlight 2 ̆ 7 s progress through the forests of the Pacific Northwest.

50|$|The modern D-28 is made {{of several}} high quality tone woods, {{featuring}} a solid Sitka spruce top, Indian Rosewood back and sides and mahogany neck. It uses the classic non scalloped X bracing pattern pioneered by Martin along with an ebony bridge and fret board.Much of the construction is still done by hand although in recent years Martin has adopted modern computer controlled CNC machines to fashion the guitar's neck as well as automated <b>buffing</b> and polishing <b>machines</b> that maintain {{the overall quality of}} the finished product. As of 2013, a base model sells for around $2,400 U.S., however many of the older models that were made in the 1940s, 1950s and early 1960s command far greater prices.|$|R
40|$|Scheduling with {{conflicts}} supposes graph of conflicts. Vertices of that graph represent {{machines and}} edges represent conflicts between them. Every machine can be switched on or switched off. Two conflicting machines cannot be both switched {{on at the}} same time. At certain times new tasks arrive to speci c machines and enqueue to its input <b>buff</b> ers. Each <b>machine</b> continuously processes tasks from its input bu ffer whenever it is switched on. An algorithm decides which machines should be switched on or switched o ff at any time, obeying conflict constraints. The objective is to schedule machine switching to minimize the maximum bu er size of all processors. The problem is online, so an algorithm has {{to make decisions about}} current con ffiguration without knowledge of future tasks. In this thesis I consider the algorithm based on maximization of scalar product of work vector (vector describing con guration of machines) and vector of bu ffer lengths. I prove that this algorithm is well de ffined, finite on every input and for speciffi c graph (path of length 3) it has competitive ratio of 7 = 3. Further I consider possibilities of implementation of that algorithm...|$|R
40|$|A {{new system}} has been {{developed}} for sanitizing floors in hospitals; this system replaces the traditional procedure of daily dusting and wet mopping with a disinfectant-detergent solution and periodic buffing. This new system relies on a sequence of procedures consisting of dust mopping using a chemically treated dust mop, <b>machine</b> <b>buffing</b> of a sprayed-on polymer treatment, and a second dust mopping. The effectiveness of the procedures was evaluated by means of surface sampling for bacterial contamination and air sampling for airborne bacteria and dust. The level of bacterial contamination on the floors was reduced by 93. 6 % by using the new system, compared with 79. 8 % by using the conventional process of dust mopping and wet mopping with a disinfectant solution. The levels of airborne bacteria {{during and after the}} individual procedures did not vary significantly from the initial level (123. 6 CFU/per m 3 of air). A survey of representative colonies from air samples revealed staphylococci, gram-positive bacilli, gram-positive diplococci, yeast cells, and infrequent gram-negative rods. The distribution {{at the conclusion of the}} sanitizing process was similar to that at the outset. Similarly, the levels of airborne dust measured during and after the individual procedures did not vary significantly from the initial level. When compared with the traditional method of cleaning by wet mopping, the new method was significantly more effective in removal of microbial contamination and required less labor...|$|R
