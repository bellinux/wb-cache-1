5|$|Chemical {{compounds}} can <b>bind</b> <b>to</b> troponin C {{to act as}} troponin activators (calcium sensitizers) or troponin inhibitors (calcium desensitizers). There {{are already}} multiple troponin activators that <b>bind</b> <b>to</b> fast skeletal troponin C, of which tirasemtiv has been tested in multiple clinical trials. In contrast, there are no known compounds that bind with high affinity to cardiac troponin C. The calcium sensitizer, levosimendan, is purported to <b>bind</b> <b>to</b> troponin C, but only weak or inconsistent binding has been detected, precluding any structure determination. In contrast, levosimendan inhibits type 3 phosphodiesterase with nanomolar affinity, so its biological target is controversial.|$|E
5|$|HIV-1 and HIV-2 {{appear to}} package their RNA differently. HIV-1 will <b>bind</b> <b>to</b> any {{appropriate}} RNA. HIV-2 will preferentially <b>bind</b> <b>to</b> the mRNA {{that was used}} to create the Gag protein itself.|$|E
5|$|A {{competitive}} inhibitor and substrate cannot <b>bind</b> <b>to</b> {{the enzyme}} {{at the same}} time. Often competitive inhibitors strongly resemble the real substrate of the enzyme. For example, the drug methotrexate is a competitive inhibitor of the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase, which catalyzes the reduction of dihydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate. The similarity between the structures of dihydrofolate and this drug are shown in the accompanying figure. This type of inhibition can be overcome with high substrate concentration. In some cases, the inhibitor can <b>bind</b> <b>to</b> a site other than the binding-site of the usual substrate and exert an allosteric effect to change {{the shape of the}} usual binding-site.|$|E

5|$|An enzyme {{inhibitor}} is a molecule that binds to an enzyme and decreases its activity. Since blocking an enzyme's activity can kill a pathogen or correct a metabolic imbalance, many drugs are {{enzyme inhibitor}}s. They {{are also used}} in pesticides. Not all molecules that <b>bind</b> <b>to</b> enzymes are inhibitors; enzyme activators <b>bind</b> <b>to</b> enzymes and increase their enzymatic activity, while enzyme substrates bind and are converted to products in the normal catalytic cycle of the enzyme.|$|E
5|$|In humans, two {{different}} proteins can be associated in this position. In the cytoplasm of cells, Dis3L1 {{is associated with}} the exosome, whereas in the nucleus, Dis3 can <b>bind</b> <b>to</b> the core complex.|$|E

50|$|In more {{specific}} terms, the amino-terminus of vinculin <b>binds</b> <b>to</b> talin, which, in turn, <b>binds</b> <b>to</b> β-integrins, and the carboxy-terminus <b>binds</b> <b>to</b> actin, phospholipids, and paxillin-forming homodimers. The binding of vinculin to talin and actin is regulated by polyphosphoinositides and inhibited by acidic phospholipids. The complex then serves to anchor actin filaments to the membrane.|$|R

(1) Plate is {{coated with}} a capture antibody; (2) sample is added, and any antigen present <b>binds</b> <b>to</b> capture antibody; (3) detecting antibody is added, and <b>binds</b> <b>to</b> antigen; (4) enzyme-linked secondary antibody is added, and <b>binds</b> <b>to</b> detecting antibody; (5) substrate is added, and is converted by enzyme to detectable form.|$|R
5|$|Proteins can <b>bind</b> <b>to</b> other {{proteins}} {{as well as}} to small-molecule substrates. When proteins bind {{specifically to}} other copies of the same molecule, they can oligomerize to form fibrils; this process occurs often in structural proteins that consist of globular monomers that self-associate to form rigid fibers. Protein–protein interactions also regulate enzymatic activity, control progression through the cell cycle, and allow the assembly of large protein complexes that carry out many closely related reactions with a common biological function. Proteins can also <b>bind</b> <b>to,</b> or even be integrated into, cell membranes. The ability of binding partners to induce conformational changes in proteins allows the construction of enormously complex signaling networks.|$|E
5|$|Some {{compounds}} {{have been}} identified to bind cNTnC with low affinity and act as troponin activators: DFBP-O (a structural analog of levosimendan), 4-(4-(2,5-dimethylphenyl)-1-piperazinyl)-3-pyridinamine (NCI147866), and bepridil. The calmodulin antagonist, W7, has also been found to <b>bind</b> <b>to</b> cNTnC {{to act as a}} troponin inhibitor. All of these compounds <b>bind</b> <b>to</b> the hydrophobic patch in the open conformation of cNTnC, with troponin activators promoting interaction with the cTnI switch peptide and troponin inhibitors destabilizing the interaction.|$|E
5|$|Type II {{hypersensitivity}} {{occurs when}} antibodies <b>bind</b> <b>to</b> antigens on the patient's own cells, marking them for destruction. This is also called antibody-dependent (or cytotoxic) hypersensitivity, and is mediated by IgG and IgM antibodies.|$|E
50|$|Inducers also {{function}} by binding to activators. Activators generally <b>bind</b> poorly <b>to</b> activator DNA sequences unless an inducer is present. Activator <b>binds</b> <b>to</b> an inducer and {{the complex}} <b>binds</b> <b>to</b> the activation sequence and activates target gene. Removing the inducer stops transcription.|$|R
50|$|The single {{stranded}} copy now loops at the 3’ end as it <b>binds</b> <b>to</b> itself. The FIP primer <b>binds</b> <b>to</b> the 5’ end of {{this single}} strand and accompanied by DNA polymerase, synthesizes a complementary strand. The F3 primer, with DNA polymerase, <b>binds</b> <b>to</b> this end and generates a new double stranded DNA molecule while displacing the previously made single strand.|$|R
50|$|Antibody-drug conjugates use a {{monoclonal}} antibody that <b>binds</b> <b>to</b> tumors cells {{linked to a}} cytotoxic drug. This allows the drug to selectively target the cells that the antibody <b>binds</b> <b>to.</b>|$|R
5|$|A B cell {{identifies}} pathogens when antibodies on {{its surface}} <b>bind</b> <b>to</b> a specific foreign antigen. This antigen/antibody complex is {{taken up by the}} B cell and processed by proteolysis into peptides. The B cell then displays these antigenic peptides {{on its surface}} MHC class II molecules. This combination of MHC and antigen attracts a matching helper T cell, which releases lymphokines and activates the B cell. As the activated B cell then begins to divide, its offspring (plasma cells) secrete millions of copies of the antibody that recognizes this antigen. These antibodies circulate in blood plasma and lymph, <b>bind</b> <b>to</b> pathogens expressing the antigen and mark them for destruction by complement activation or for uptake and destruction by phagocytes. Antibodies can also neutralize challenges directly, by binding to bacterial toxins or by interfering with the receptors that viruses and bacteria use to infect cells.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{compounds}} can also <b>bind</b> <b>to</b> cCTnC with low affinity: EMD 57033, resveratrol, bepridil, and EGCG. All of these compounds are renowned for their promiscuity, and the biological {{significance of these}} interactions is unknown. In particular, it is unknown how interaction with cCTnC influences the calcium affinity of cNTnC.|$|E
5|$|All the {{functions}} of DNA depend on interactions with proteins. These protein interactions can be non-specific, or the protein can bind specifically to a single DNA sequence. Enzymes can also <b>bind</b> <b>to</b> DNA and of these, the polymerases that copy the DNA base sequence in transcription and DNA replication are particularly important.|$|E
40|$|AbstractHeat shock {{transcription}} factor (HSF), an evolutionarily conserved heat-responsive regulator, <b>binds</b> <b>to</b> heat shock elements (HSEs) comprising continuous inverted repeats of the pentamer nGAAn. Here, we analyzed DNA-binding ability, {{particularly for the}} discontinuously arranged nGAAn units, of HSFs from various organisms, including Arabidopsis thaliana, Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster, and Danio rerio. Among these, only C. elegans HSF failed <b>to</b> <b>bind</b> the discontinuous nGAAn units, {{which suggests that the}} target genes of HSFs in many, but not all, organisms contain discontinuous HSEs, as well as continuous HSEs. Further analysis of alternatively spliced HSF isoforms showed the importance of the C-terminal region in HSF–HSE interaction.

25|$|The {{growth of}} actin {{filaments}} can be regulated by thymosin and profilin. Thymosin <b>binds</b> <b>to</b> G-actin to buffer the polymerizing process, while profilin <b>binds</b> <b>to</b> G-actin to exchange ADP for ATP, promoting the monomeric {{addition to the}} barbed, plus end of F-actin filaments.|$|R
5|$|In cardiac muscle, cTnC <b>binds</b> <b>to</b> cardiac {{troponin}} I (cTnI) and cardiac troponin T (cTnT), whereas cTnC <b>binds</b> <b>to</b> slow skeletal troponin I (ssTnI) and troponin T (ssTnT) in slow-twitch skeletal muscle.|$|R
5|$|An uncompetitive {{inhibitor}} cannot <b>bind</b> <b>to</b> {{the free}} enzyme, {{only to the}} enzyme-substrate complex; hence, these types of inhibitors are most effective at high substrate concentration. In {{the presence of the}} inhibitor, the enzyme-substrate complex is inactive. This type of inhibition is rare.|$|E
5|$|Antibodies are glycoproteins {{belonging}} to the immunoglobulin superfamily. They constitute most of the gamma globulin fraction of the blood proteins. They are typically made of basic structural units—each with two large heavy chains and two small light chains. There are several different types of antibody heavy chains that define the five different types of crystallisable fragments (Fc) that may {{be attached to the}} antigen-binding fragments. The five different types of Fc regions allow antibodies to be grouped into five isotypes. Each Fc region of a particular antibody isotype is able to <b>bind</b> <b>to</b> its specific Fc Receptor (except for IgD, which is essentially the BCR), thus allowing the antigen-antibody complex to mediate different roles depending on which FcR it binds. The ability of an antibody to <b>bind</b> <b>to</b> its corresponding FcR is further modulated by the structure of the glycan(s) present at conserved sites within its Fc region. The ability of antibodies to <b>bind</b> <b>to</b> FcRs helps to direct the appropriate immune response for each different type of foreign object they encounter. For example, IgE is responsible for an allergic response consisting of mast cell degranulation and histamine release. IgE's Fab paratope binds to allergic antigen, for example house dust mite particles, while its Fc region binds to Fc receptor ε. The allergen-IgE-FcRε interaction mediates allergic signal transduction to induce conditions such as asthma.|$|E
5|$|Dudley was {{credited}} with discovering that a toxic component of tobacco smoke is carbon monoxide (which poisons the blood by interfering with oxygen's ability to <b>bind</b> <b>to</b> hemoglobin). Dudley rejected the popularly held opinion that cigarette smoke was harmful due to the adulteration of the tobacco, e. g. with opium. His experiments showed the toxic agent to be carbon monoxide, resulting alike from cigarette, pipe, or cigar.|$|E

50|$|A {{number of}} {{proteins}} {{participate in the}} assembly of the MAC. Freshly activated C5b <b>binds</b> <b>to</b> C6 to form a C5b-6 complex, then to C7 forming the C5b-6-7 complex. The C5b-6-7 complex <b>binds</b> <b>to</b> C8, which is composed of three chains (alpha, beta, and gamma), thus forming the C5b-6-7-8 complex. C5b-6-7-8 subsequently <b>binds</b> <b>to</b> C9 and acts as a catalyst in the polymerization of C9.|$|R
5000|$|Triptans are {{specific}} and selective agonists for the 5-HT1 receptors. Sumatriptan <b>binds</b> <b>to</b> 5-HT1D receptors, zolmitriptan, rizatriptan, naratriptan, almotriptan, and frovatriptan <b>binds</b> <b>to</b> 5-HT1B/1D and eletriptan <b>binds</b> <b>to</b> 5-HT1B/1D/1F receptors. Triptans {{are believed to}} exert their effects through vasoconstriction, leading to reduced carotid arterial circulation without affecting cerebral blood flow, peripheral neuronal inhibition, or inhibition of transmission through second order neurons of the trigeminocervical complex.|$|R
5|$|Non{{benzodiazepine}}s also <b>bind</b> <b>to</b> the benzodiazepine {{binding site}} on the GABAA receptor and possess similar pharmacological properties. While the nonbenzodiazepines are by definition structurally unrelated to the benzodiazepines, both classes of drugs possess a common pharmacophore (see figure to the lower-right), which explains their binding to a common receptor site.|$|E
5|$|Often, once an {{antibody}} and antigen bind, {{they become}} an immune complex, which {{functions as a}} unitary object and can act as an antigen in its own right, being countered by other antibodies. Similarly, haptens are small molecules that provoke no immune response by themselves, but once they <b>bind</b> <b>to</b> proteins, the resulting complex or hapten-carrier adduct is antigenic.|$|E
5|$|Other {{antiviral}} drugs target {{different stages}} of the viral life cycle. HIV is dependent on an enzyme called the HIV-1 protease for the virus to become infectious. There is a class of drugs called protease inhibitors, which <b>bind</b> <b>to</b> this enzyme and stop it from functioning.|$|E
