500|$|... "I {{realized}} it was the applause of the fans that really kept me going. Because I {{would be ready to}} go onstage and just be crying hysterically not understanding even how I was feeling. I was feeling very dizzy, I had a lot of vertigo, I had pain but it's like fuck if I know what hurts the most because I'd been on tour for a year. But I didn't want to let them down and I just couldn't cancel because the thought of leaving 50,000 kids in the arena just <b>broke</b> <b>my</b> <b>heart.</b> So I went out every night and I played and I played and I played until I couldn't walk one night." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Baby" [...] {{was written}} by Bieber with Christopher [...] "Tricky" [...] Stewart and Terius [...] "The-Dream" [...] Nash, both of whom worked with Bieber on [...] "One Time", R singer and The-Dream's then wife Christina Milian and labelmate, Ludacris. When asked how the {{collaboration}} initially came about, Bieber said, [...] " [...] both live in Atlanta. I met him a year prior to this and we figured {{it was a perfect}} collaboration for him, so we invited him out to do it." [...] Bieber first premiered the song performing on MuchMusic on December 28, 2009. A few days before the release of the single, Bieber posted an acoustic version of the song to his YouTube with his guitarist Dan Kanterr, similar to the way he did with [...] "Favorite Girl". Billboard said that: [...] "Bieber delivers his characteristically clean vocals with conviction: [...] "My first love <b>broke</b> <b>my</b> <b>heart</b> for the first time / and I'm like, 'baby, baby, baby, no!' I thought you'd always be mine." [...] Also in a review of the acoustic version Bill Lamb of About.com said that [...] "I think the vocals here will convince some that Justin Bieber really does have the vocal chops." ...|$|E

6000|$|She nodded. [...] "Bravest thing I ever did. Nearly <b>broke</b> <b>my</b> <b>'eart</b> {{to leave}} <b>my</b> baby; but 'twas that or drownin' myself. I was soft then. I went {{off with a}} young fellow--bookmaker that used {{to come over to}} the sports meetin', wild about me--but he never married me"--again she uttered her hard laugh--"knew a thing worth tu o' that." [...] Lifting her hand towards the burning furze, she added: [...] "I used to come up here an' help 'em light that when I was a little girl." [...] And {{suddenly}} she began to cry. It was not so painful and alarming as her first distress, for it seemed natural now.|$|R
500|$|The song is {{predominantly}} upbeat, featuring Bieber's R vocals over a backdrop containing a dance infused beat, full of keyboard and [...] "disco string" [...] synths. The song is composed {{in the key}} of E♭ major with Bieber's vocal range spanning from the low-note of G3 to the high-note of C5. According to Jody Rosen of Rolling Stone, the song [...] "blends winks at Fifties doo-wop with hip-hop chants", comparing the style and the lyrics [...] "My first love <b>broke</b> <b>my</b> <b>heart</b> for the first time/And I was like/Baby, baby, baby, ooooh/I thought you'd always be mine" [...] to fifties [...] ballads like [...] "Tears on My Pillow", [...] "Why Do Fools Fall in Love" [...] and [...] "Earth Angel". Lyrically, Bieber's lines explain his distress over his lost love, and promise to get it back, featured in lines like, [...] "And I wanna play it cool/But I'm losin' you…/I'm in pieces/So come and fix me…". The chorus features the distinct and repetitive [...] "baby, baby, baby, ohhhh (nooooo)" [...] hook. After the second verse, Ludacris comes in with the verse-rap, an anecdote of young love when he was thirteen, as it runs [...] "When I was 13/I had my first love/She had me going crazy/Oh, I was star-struck/She woke me up daily/Don't need no Starbucks…".|$|E
500|$|In December 1977 he was {{appointed}} as a coach at Port Vale by manager Dennis Butler, being demoted to reserve coach in October 1978 by new boss Alan Bloor. Banks enjoyed coaching but soon resigned his position, feeling that players such as Bernie Wright refused to take his advice on board. He applied for the vacant management positions at Lincoln City and Rotherham United, but was rejected. He instead accepted the role as manager of Alliance Premier League part-time club Telford United. He signed a goalkeeper, centre-half and centre-forward from Bangor City for £1,500, as well as former Stoke striker John Ruggiero. The [...] "Bucks" [...] finished in 13th place in 1979–80. In November 1980, he left Jackie Mudie in temporary charge of team affairs whilst he underwent surgery, who led the club to defeat in the FA Trophy {{at the hands of}} a lower league club. On his return to the club Banks was sacked. He was offered the position of raffle-ticket seller, and accepted the post in the belief that it would entitle him to the money owed to him in the terms of his management contract; he eventually had to settle for 50% of his contract. He later stated that [...] "It <b>broke</b> <b>my</b> <b>heart...</b> I did not want to stay in the game." ...|$|E
500|$|Media {{portrayals of}} Naomi Watts' and Laura Elena Harring's views of their onscreen {{relationships}} were varied and conflicting. Watts {{said of the}} filming of the scene, [...] "I don't see it as erotic, though maybe it plays that way. The last time I saw it, I actually had {{tears in my eyes}} because I knew where the story was going. It <b>broke</b> <b>my</b> <b>heart</b> a little bit." [...] However, in another interview Watts stated, [...] "I was amazed how honest and real all this looks on screen. These girls look really in love and it was curiously erotic." [...] While Harring was quoted saying, [...] "The love scene just happened in my eyes. Rita's very grateful for the help Betty's given [...] so I'm saying goodbye and goodnight to her, thank you, {{from the bottom of my}} heart, I kiss her and then there's just an energy that takes us [...] Of course I have amnesia so I don't know if I've done it before, but I don't think we're really lesbians." [...] Heather Love agreed somewhat with Harring's perception when she stated that identity in Mulholland Drive is not as important as desire: [...] "who we are does not count for much—what matters instead is what we are about to do, what we want to do." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't be {{for putting}} me off with such trash," [...] she returned, more passionately; [...] "you've murdered {{him as much}} as if you had cut his throat, and pretty nigh Master Walter into the bargain; and you've <b>broke</b> <b>my</b> lady's <b>heart,</b> you, as was born on her land and fed with her bread. And now you think to make up to me, do you?" ...|$|R

My passion is that I love {{in such a way}} that if I <b>broke</b> up, <b>my</b> <b>heart</b> would follow him.Oh, I wish I knew.If there is a way to be alone together which do not reach the ears of the spy. How wonderful I want to be alone with my beloved living, even when it is in my gut and in my chest.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is not {{possible}} for me to do anything of the sort," [...] I told her. [...] "I do not wish to seem unkind, but nothing in this world would induce me to consider such a thing for a moment. I have chosen my life and the manner of it. Do you think that I can ever forget that you and my father between you <b>broke</b> <b>my</b> mother's <b>heart,</b> and made it necessary for me to be brought up without friends, ashamed of my name and of my history? One does not forget these things. I bear you no ill will, but I wish that you would go away." ...|$|R

6000|$|All {{the rest}} of the day the mother's brain was busy with excited thinkings; with plans, projects, schemes, each and all of them uncanny, grim, and dark. Yet they lit up her face; lit it with a fell light of their own; lit it with vague fires of hell. She was in a fever of unrest; she could not sit, stand, read, sew; there was no relief for her but in movement. She tested her boy's gift in twenty ways, and kept saying to herself all the time, with her mind in the past: [...] "He <b>broke</b> <b>my</b> father's <b>heart,</b> and night and day all these years I have tried, and all in vain, to think out a way to break his. I have found it now--I have found it now." ...|$|R

MacColl sang backing vocals on Ullman's version. In less than two years, Ullman had six songs in the UK Top 100.|$|E

It <b>broke</b> <b>my</b> <b>heart</b> to leave Steve {{but it had to}} be done, I was ultimately the stronger". Due to the break-up of his marriage and growing drug use, some band members said that Marriott at times became domineering, aggressive and intolerable to work with. Humble Pie disbanded in 1975, citing musical differences as the reason for the split. Financial mismanagement and widespread substance abuse within the band also played a part.

[...] Ólafur agreed to join the production, and his hiring was publicly announced in December 2012. Ólafur called working on Broadchurch series one [...] "an absolute pleasure. The creators and directors gave me complete artistic freedom and encouraged me to be as bold as possible. Which is what every artist wants to hear." ...|$|E

2500|$|On June 19, 2007, Fator {{made his}} first {{national}} appearance on America's Got Talent. Speaking on the experience, Fator said, [...] "Not in my wildest dreams did I imagine I would win that show...Essentially I auditioned because the guy that was the ventriloquist the first season got on Late Show with David Letterman... So I figured I'd do three episodes like he did and end up on 'David Letterman.'" [...] After winning the show, Fator actually had to turn the Letterman gig down fourteen times before his schedule was clear so he could appear. [...] "My schedule got so packed, and it <b>broke</b> <b>my</b> <b>heart</b> every time I had to turn him down," [...] Fator says.|$|E
2500|$|Despite being a shy woman, Sackville-West often {{forced herself}} to {{participate}} in literary readings before book clubs and on the BBC in order to {{feel a sense of}} belonging. Her love of the classical traditions in literature put her out of favor with modernist critics and by the 1940s, she was often dismissed as a dated writer, much to her chagrin. For an example, her epic poem [...] "Solitude", published by the Hogarth Press on 27 October 1938 contains references to the Bible, Saint Brenden, Paracelsus, Ixion, Catullus, Andromeda, the Iliad and a Sabine bride, all of which were quite acceptable in the early 20th century, but were seen as anachronistic by 1938. The narrator of Solitude has an ardent love of the English countryside and though the sex of the narrator is left ambiguous, implied at various points to be a man or a woman, it is made clear the narrator loved intensely a woman who is no longer around and who is deeply missed. At one point, it is suggested that the narrator's vividly expressed horror and disgust at Ixion, the brutal rapist whom the narrator feels was justly punished by Zeus, implies that she is a woman, and her desire at another point in the poem to free Andromeda from her chains to make love suggests that she is a lesbian. The narrator compares the love of nature to the love of books as both cultivate her mind, and thinks of herself as superior to the farmers who merely work the land without the time or the interest for poetry, all of which make it possible for her to have a deeper appreciation of nature. Sackville-West felt a deep sense of loss in signing documents in 1947 relinquishing any claim on Sissinghurst, as part of its transition to the National Trust. She wrote of the signing that it [...] "nearly <b>broke</b> <b>my</b> <b>heart,</b> putting my signature to what I regarded as a betrayal of all the tradition of my ancestors and the house I loved." ...|$|E

60|$|The {{green syrup}} coursed along vein and artery like molten lead. A horrifying {{transparency}} {{began to spread}} over my mind. It seemed it had become in that instant empty and radiant as a dome of glass. All sounds hushed away. Things near faded into an infinite distance. Every face, glossed with light as if varnished, became lifeless, brutal, and inhuman, the grotesque caricature of a shadowy countenance that hung somewhere remote in memory, yet was invisible and irrevocable. In this dead moment--the whole blazing scene like a nowhere of the imagination--my wandering eyes met Fanny's. She was softly languishing up at Captain Valentine, her fingers toying with a rose. And {{it seemed as though}} her once loved spirit cried homelessly out at me from space, as if for refuge and recognition; and a long-hidden flood <b>broke</b> bounds in <b>my</b> <b>heart.</b> All else forgotten, and obeying mechanically the force of long habit, I stepped up from my chair on to the table, and staggered towards her, upsetting, as I went, a shallow glass of bubbling wine. It reeked up in the air around me.|$|R
