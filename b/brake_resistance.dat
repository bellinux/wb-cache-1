In {{order to}} discuss the {{transient}} process of induction motors dynamic braking,analysis {{the impact of the}} <b>brake</b> <b>resistance</b> on the time, and then choose the best resistance. In Matlab / Simulink environment,based on motor simulation model,by repeatedly adjusting the rotor resistor, their impact on motor speed during braking time can be visually observed. By using the least squares method in Matlab, each discrete points of the resistor and the corresponding braking time can be fitted into continuous curve, resulting in the optimum braking resistor under the shortest brake time.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{investigate}} the influence of the phenomenon of “laterality” in a wide spectrum of parameters of the physical condition of the lower limbs in tennis, as well as to study the influence of 3 different methods on the same parameters, through examining variations in performance. The sample consisted of 64 sport science students at Serres, aged between 21. 05 ± 1. 33. Data were collected by means of laboratory measurements in the Department’s Laboratory of Biomechanics. Initially, their dominant and non-dominant side was examined and ascertained during lateral movement with side steps. Based on a specific measurement protocol which included: a) jumping attempts, b) races, c) strength tests, d) reaction to a visual stimulus and e) a speed check of cycle ergometer, the performance of both sides was registered when they were brought into action either one at time or both simultaneously. Following recommendations by Baumann, a single axis dynamometer (AMD Co. Ltd., typ LC 4204 -K 600, 1 -D, Load cell) was used to assess all the vertical jumps, performances in body side displacements and in reaction speed to optical stimulus. The dynamometer was placed in parallel with the ground on which there was a special steel platform. To assess the maximal isometric strength of the lower limbs (Fmaxiso), a second identical dynamometer was used, placed vertically on the ground, on a special closed device to facilitate its transfer. To assess the maximal speed on a cycle-ergometer (UEmax), a MONARK Ergomedic cycle-ergometer (814 E, classe A, din 32932) was used without an additional <b>brake</b> <b>resistance.</b> The speed at the distance of 11. 885 m. was measured (a) using two photocell fences consisted of two bands with two pairs of photocells each, and (b) with an automatic digital timer with minimal time measurement set to 0. 01 sec. Then, the subjects were divided into 4 subgroups (3 experimental groups and one control group). The training protocols that were applied to improve the non-dominant side, included jumping exercises for group A, tennis-specific racing exercises for group B, and an equal combination (50 % - 50 %) of the two previous types of exercise for group C. The volume of the training load during each training session comprised of 4 exercises from a program of six exercises in total, that were executed in various combinations across training sessions. Each exercise was repeated between 6 and 8 times in two sets in each training session. There was an interval of two minutes between sets. There was also a time break of 3 to 4 minutes between each type of exercise. To examine the influence of the various training methods the tests used were the Paired t-test, and the one-way ANOVA followed by the Scheffee post-hoc test. It was concluded, that the training of group A was as a whole more efficient in dealing with laterality, followed by group C, and then by group B. The non-dominant limb performances were improved as follows: The time of the body side displacement at 4. 115 m. and the sprint time at 11. 885 m. were decreased. Also, the height of the vertical jump and the speed at the cycle ergometer test were increased. Finally, the reaction time at the optical stimulus was decreased while the maximal isometric strength was increased. The practical application of the research results would be particularly useful in diagnosing laterality and would mainly contribute to the improvement speed and strength of lower limbs in tennis. ...|$|E

The magnetic braking system is quieter than the other braked flywheel types. The <b>braking</b> <b>resistance</b> is adjustable and energy can be accurately measured on this type of rower. The drawback {{of this type of}} resistance mechanism is that the resistance is constant; rowers using air or water resistance more accurately simulate actual rowing, where the resistance increases the harder the handle is pulled. Since they use electromagnets to build up the resistance, they really do not offer the intensity of resistance that one needs for an effective workout.|$|R

50|$|<b>Braked</b> {{flywheel}} <b>resistance</b> models comprise magnetic, air {{and water}} resistance rowers. These machines are mechanically similar since all three types use a handle connected to a flywheel by rope, chain, or strap to provide resistance to the user - the types differ only in braking mechanism. Because the handle {{is attached to the}} resistance source by rope or similarly flexible media, the trajectory of the hands in the vertical plane is free making it possible for the rower to emulate the hand height difference between the stroke and the return. Most of these models have the characteristic sliding seat typical of competitive on-the-water boats.|$|R
50|$|In this respect, {{the data}} for fuel energy wasted in <b>braking,</b> rolling <b>resistance,</b> and {{aerodynamic}} drag are all somewhat misleading, {{because they do not}} reflect all the energy that was wasted up to that point in the process of delivering energy to the wheels. The image reports that on non-highway (urban) driving, 6% of the fuel's energy is dissipated in braking; however, by dividing this figure by the energy that actually reaches the axle (13%), one can find that 46% of the energy reaching the axle goes to the brakes. Also, additional energy can potentially be recovered when going down hills, which may not be reflected in these figures.|$|R
40|$|Many traffic {{collisions}} involve mountain bicycles. An {{important aspect}} of reconstructing these collisions is the braking and acceleration capability of the bicycle. Currently there are few published sources of acceleration, <b>braking,</b> and rolling <b>resistance</b> data for mountain bicycles. This project sought to fill this void by executing 116 acceleration, <b>braking,</b> and rolling <b>resistance</b> tests. A Stalker ATS radar unit was used for determining bicycle speed at 0. 03 -second intervals and at 0. 016 kilometer-per-hour increments. These tests were documented with video and still cameras, {{as well as a}} total station. The average acceleration, <b>braking,</b> and rolling <b>resistance</b> rates for each of the tests are provided below in tabular format. Based on the technical specifications of the Stalker ATS radar unit, these rates are accurate to ± 0. 01 g. For the tests on dirt trails, five mountain bicycles and one cyclo-cross bicycle were ridden on- 2 % and- 11 % slopes. A total of nine acceleration and two rolling resistance tests were completed on the- 2 % slope, while thirty-four braking tests were made on both the- 2 % and the- 11 % slopes. For the testing on pavement, five mountain bicycles, one cyclo-cross bicycle, and one road bicycle were ridden on- 1 % and + 1 % slopes. A total of fourteen rolling resistance, fifteen acceleration, and forty-two brake tests were made on both asphalt and Portland concrete. The results of these tests demonstrate the superiority of the front brake over the rear brake. These tests also indicated only slightly better braking on pavement than on dirt. The stopping ability of the rear brake is about 76 % of the front brake, and is about 65 % of the front and rear brakes combined. Acceleration rates were found to be about 25 % higher on pavement than on dirt...|$|R
40|$|Actuating torque {{data from}} field testing of a 122 -centimeter (48 in.) {{butterfly}} valve with a hydro/pneumatic actuator is presented. The hydraulic cylinder functions {{as either a}} forward or a reverse <b>brake.</b> Its <b>resistance</b> torque increases when the valve speeds up and decreases when the valve slows down. A reduction of flow resistance in the hydraulic flow path {{from one end of}} the hydraulic cylinder to the other will effectively reduce the hydraulic resistance torque and hence increase the actuating torque. The sum of hydrodynamic and friction torques (combined resistance torque) of a butterfly valve is a function of valve opening time. An increase in the pneumatic actuating pressure will result in a decrease in both the combined resistance torque and the actuator opening torque; however, it does shorten the valve opening time.

40|$|This {{presentation}} discusses {{a method}} of accounting for realistic levels of driver aggression to higher-level vehicle studies, including the impact of variation in real-world driving characteristics (acceleration and speed) on vehicle energy consumption and different powertrains (e. g., conventionally powered vehicles versus electrified drive vehicles [xEVs]). Aggression variation between drivers can increase fuel consumption by more than 50 % or decrease it by more than 20 % from average. The normalized fuel consumption deviation from average {{as a function of}} population percentile was found to be largely insensitive to powertrain. However, the traits of ideal driving behavior are a function of powertrain. In conventional vehicles, kinetic losses dominate rolling resistance and aerodynamic losses. In xEVs with regenerative <b>braking,</b> rolling <b>resistance</b> and aerodynamic losses dominate. The relation of fuel consumption predicted from real-world drive data to that predicted by the industry-standard HWFET, UDDS, LA 92, and US 06 drive cycles was not consistent across powertrains, and varied broadly from the mean, median, and mode of real-world driving.

Univariate ANOVAs with repeated measures on resistance, and Newman Keuls post hoc analysis tests revealed that the absolute peak and mean power responses of the children increased incrementally with age and demonstrated very few sex differences.

Initially, athletes were assigned into either the normoxemic (= 9, SaO(2) > 92 %, : 62. 0 +/- A 1. 9 ml kg(- 1) min(- 1)) or hypoxemic (= 12, SaO(2) < 92 %, : 60. 5 +/- A 2. 2 ml kg(- 1) min(- 1), mean +/- A SEM) group, following an incremental test on a wind <b>resistance</b> <b>braked</b> rowing ergometer. On a separate day the rowers performed a 2, 000 -m all-out effort on the same rowing ergometer. Following an overnight fast, blood samples were drawn from an antecubital vein before and immediately after the termination of the 2, 000 -m all-out effort and analyzed for selective oxidative stress markers. In both the normoxemic (SaO(2) : 94. 1 +/- A 0. 9 %) and hypoxemic (SaO(2) : 88. 6 +/- A 2. 4 %) rowers similar and significant exercise increase in serum thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances, protein carbonyls, catalase and total antioxidant capacity concentration were observed post- 2, 000 m all-out effort. Exercise significantly increased the oxidized glutathione concentration and decreased the ratio of reduced (GSH) -to-oxidized (GSSG) glutathione in the normoxemic group only, whereas the reduced form of glutathione remained unaffected in either groups. The increased oxidation of GSH to GSSG in erythrocytes of normoxemic individuals suggest that erythrocyte redox status may be affected by the oxygen saturation degree of hemoglobin. Our findings indicate that exercise-induced hypoxemia did not further affect the increased blood oxidative damage of lipids and proteins observed after a 2, 000 -m rowing ergometer race in highly-trained male rowers.

Subjects performed a 30 second Wingate maximal sprint test followed 60 minutes later by a continuous maximal incremental step test on either the EB or RB cycle ergometer, in a random order. The Wingate test was performed at 9 % of body mass and for 30 seconds with a 5 second speed up period. The incremental test started at 100 W and increased in resistance by 50 W every 3 minutes until volitional exhaustion. Heart rate, VO 2, power output and blood lactate were measured during the maximal incremental test. Results: The results showed a significant difference (p< 0. 01) for the Wingate test between the RB and EB both in terms of peak power output (POmax) and mean power output (POmean) with subjects generating greater power outputs on the EB. During the maximal incremental test, significant differences (p< 0. 01) were found between EB and RB for submaximal power output, heart rate, and VO 2 at both lactate threshold 1 (1 mmol. l- 1 rise above baseline, LT 1) and onset of blood lactate accumulation (4 mmol. l- 1 blood lactate reference point, OBLA), as well as peak power output at VO 2 max (PVO 2 max). Conclusions: Overall it was shown that significant differences in physiological demands were present between the two ergometers under both anaerobic and aerobic conditions. This is may in part be explained by the different positions that the cyclists adopted on either ergometer.
