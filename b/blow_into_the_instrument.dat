5000|$|The {{recorders}} {{described by}} Virdung have cylindrical profiles with flat heads, narrow windows and long ramps, ring-like turnings on the feet, {{and a slight}} external flare at the bell (above, far left and middle left). Virdung depicts four recorders together: a [...] "baßcontra" [...] or [...] "bassus" [...] (basset) in F3 with an anchor shaped key and a perforated fontanelle, two tenors in C4 and a [...] "discantus" [...] (alto) in G4. According to Virdung, the configurations F-C-C-G or F-C-G-G {{should be used for}} four-part music, depending on the range of the bass part. As previously mentioned, the accuracy of these woodcuts cannot be verified as no recorders fitting this description survive. Virdung also provides the first ever fingering chart for a recorder with a range of an octave and a seventh, though he says that the bass had a range of only an octave and sixth. In his fingering chart, he numbers which fingers to lift rather than those to put down and, unlike in later charts, numbers them from bottom (1) to top (8). His only other technical instruction is that the player must <b>blow</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>instrument</b> and [...] "learn how to coordinate the articulations ... with the fingers." ...|$|E
50|$|The triola is {{designed}} to teach children {{from the age of}} two and above how to read and play music. It works by <b>blowing</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>instrument</b> and pressing <b>the</b> coloured keys. The coloured keys correspond with the coloured notes on the music.|$|R
25|$|A kazoo player hums, {{rather than}} <b>blows,</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>instrument.</b> <b>The</b> {{oscillating}} air {{pressure of the}} hum makes the kazoo's membrane vibrate. The resulting sound varies in pitch and loudness with the player's humming. Players can produce different sounds by singing specific syllables such as doo, who, rrrrr or brrrr <b>into</b> <b>the</b> kazoo.|$|R
50|$|This {{oscillator}} is {{a physical}} model of a lip-reed instrument such as a trombone, trumpet, or tuba. Programmable parameters include Inst, which selects a previously modeled <b>instrument</b> to specify <b>the</b> length and shape of an instrument, Pressure, which changes the force of air being <b>blown</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>instrument,</b> Lip, which replicates the tonality changes caused by the shape and tension of the player's lips, and Bell, which modifies the shape of <b>the</b> <b>instrument's</b> bell and creates the relevant tonal changes.|$|R
5000|$|Fine {{motor skills}} are very {{important}} in playing musical instruments. It was found that muscle memory is relied on when playing the clarinet, specifically to help create special effects through certain tongue movements when <b>blowing</b> air <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>instrument.</b>|$|R
50|$|Pitches are {{produced}} on the recorder by covering <b>the</b> holes while <b>blowing</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>instrument.</b> Modern terminology {{refers to the}} holes {{on the front of}} <b>the</b> <b>instrument</b> using <b>the</b> numbers 1 through 7, starting with the hole closest to the beak, with the thumbhole numbered hole 0. At the most basic level, the fingering technique of the recorder involves the sequential uncovering of the holes from lowest to highest (i.e. uncovering 7, then uncovering 7 and 6, then uncovering 7, 6 and 5, etc.) producing ever higher pitches. In practice, however, the uncovering of the holes is not strictly sequential, and the half covering or uncovering of holes {{is an essential part of}} recorder technique.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} it is {{described}} how an immersive and interactive application {{is created by}} implementing physical models of a flute and a drum with the capability of changing dimensions in real-time. A flute-like controller is able to measure how hard a person <b>blows</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>instrument</b> and lets <b>the</b> user control different tones using buttons connected into a sensor box. A mallet is tracked using color tracking {{in order to measure}} when the mallet hits the virtual drum, and how hard. Virtual models of both instruments are also developed and implemented in 3 D stereo using Virtools [1]. The virtual flute is experienced as an extension of <b>the</b> physical <b>instrument</b> using a magnetic tracker system, which maps the movements of the user to the position and rotation of the virtual flute. The virtual drum is experienced as hovering in the air ready for the mallet to hit it. Both instruments are capable of changing size and shape to match the sound synthesis models. To further immerse the user, a visual feedback of the sound is produced. Lights and particles are altered in intensity and color to visualize changes in amplitude and frequency...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{this work}} is to {{highlight}} experimentally how inharmonicity of the bore resonance frequencies of an alto saxophone influence {{the nature of the}} oscillation regimes. A variable volume branching from the neck of an alto sax at an appropriate position allows to change the frequency of the first resonance independently from the second. A blowing machine with artificial lips is used to make the saxophone play while controlling independently the control parameters : the blowing pressure and an embouchure parameter. Values of these parameters are estimated experimentally through the measurement of the nonlinear characteristics linking the mean air flow <b>blown</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>instrument</b> to <b>the</b> static pressure difference across the reed. Experiments with different values of the control parameters {{as well as of the}} inharmonicity produce different kinds of oscillation regimes. These regimes are categorized through the analysis of the pressure signal inside the mouthpiece. The resulting maps demonstrate that the emergence of quasi-periodic regimes, and their extent, depend on the level of inharmonicity, but also on the values of the control parameters. Periodic regimes playable by choosing appropriate values of the control parameters also differ according to the level of inharmonicity, a higher inharmonicity facilitating the emergence of the third register...|$|R
5000|$|A nose whistle (also {{called a}} 'Noseflute') is a wind instrument, usually made in wood, but also {{available}} in plastic, clay and metal sheet, probably of South-American indigenous origin. In spite of its ethnic background, several models have been conceived and patented in the 19th and 20th Centuries. <b>The</b> nose <b>blows</b> air <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>instrument's</b> open nosepiece, from where it is channeled through an airduct, towards a rather sharp edge of a slit, positioned over the player's mouth opening. This edge helps creating a vortex that excites <b>the</b> acoustic field <b>into</b> <b>the</b> player's mouth cavity. Since the volume {{and shape of the}} mouth cavity can be widely and quickly controlled by the player, a wide range of playing frequencies are possible. This high playability of such sound <b>instrument</b> probably explains <b>the</b> fact that it is usually called [...] "Noseflute", rather than Nose Whistle.|$|R
5000|$|Most of {{the notes}} in the second octave and above are {{produced}} by partially opening the thumbhole {{on the back of}} the recorder, a technique known as [...] "pinching". There are two basic methods for achieving this: a) drawing the thumb away from the hole, and b) bending the thumb. The first method uses only the skin of the thumb to define the opening, while the second method uses also the nail edge. The latter technique enables better feel and thus control of the size of the opening. The placement of the thumb is crucial to the tone, intonation and stability of these notes, and varies as the notes increase in pitch, making the boring of a double hole for the thumb unviable. To play the {{notes in the}} second register and above, the player must generally <b>blow</b> more air <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>instrument</b> and/or tongue somewhat harder to excite the second or upper harmonics of <b>the</b> <b>instrument.</b> This is, however, not universally true; it is possible for example to slur piano between and in the second and third registers.|$|R
40|$|<b>Blowing</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> {{mouthpiece}} of a saxophone {{allows the}} player {{to control the}} oscillation of the reed by creating a pressure difference across its surface. When the reed oscillates, it creates an alternating opening and closure to the bore, resulting in a periodic train of pressure pulses, or a reed pulse sequence [1], that enters <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>instrument</b> bore...|$|R
