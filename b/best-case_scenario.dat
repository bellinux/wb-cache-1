Six options are being considered, three of which would include building bypasses via rock blasting (like what {{was done with the}} Laurel Hill Tunnel) while the other three would include boring two new tunnels, presumably three lanes each to accommodate the PTC's long-term plans to widen the entire mainline turnpike to six lanes except at the existing tunnels. If the PTC goes through with building new tunnels, the existing Allegheny Mountain Tunnels would be shut down. Although the projected costs for building a bypass would be {{less than half of the}} projected costs to bore new tunnels (as well as $3 million in annual maintenance on each tunnel), the aforementioned hunting group opposes the bypass options.

Rosen would later attribute part of the success to Ars Technica writer Mike Thomspon, stating that he [...] "immediately saw the potential" [...] of the Bundle in an article written for the website just prior to the Bundle's sale period. Brandon Boyer of Boing Boing believed that it provided a model that [...] "seems it could and should be repeated". The move to offer games in a price and manner that consumers were willing to buy was contrasted to larger software publishers that place artificial limitations on their content; Mike Masnick of Techdirt believed the Humble Bundle promotion worked as it [...] "focus on giving people real reasons to buy, rather than just feeling entitled to define the terms under which they buy and looking for ways to limit those who want to interact with you in a different manner".

2500|$|This corrupts {{the bottom}} of the screen and the entire right half of the maze with {{seemingly}} random symbols and tiles, overwriting the values of edible dots which makes it impossible to eat enough dots to beat the level. Because this effectively ends the game, this [...] "split-screen" [...] level is often referred to as the [...] "kill screen". There are 114 dots on the left half of the screen, nine dots on the right, and one bonus key, totaling 6,310 points. When all of the dots have been cleared, nothing happens. The game does not consider a level to be completed until 244 dots have been eaten. Each time a life is lost, the nine dots on the right half of the screen get reset and can be eaten again, resulting in an additional 90 points per extra man. In the <b>best-case</b> <b>scenario</b> (five extra men), 6,760 points will be the maximum score possible, but only 168 dots can be harvested, and that is not enough to change levels. Four of the nine dots on the right half of the screen are invisible, but can be heard when eaten. [...] Some dots are invisible but the rest can be seen, although some are a different color from normal. One method for safely clearing this round is to trap the ghosts. To trap the three important ghosts, the player must begin by going right until Pac-man reaches a blue letter 'N', and then he goes down. He keeps going down until he reaches a blue letter 'F' and then he goes right. He keeps going right until he reaches a yellow 'B', and then he goes down again. When executed properly, Pac-Man will hit an invisible wall almost immediately after the last turn is made. Eventually, the red ghost will get stuck. The pink ghost follows a few seconds later. The blue ghost will continue to move freely for several moments until the next scatter mode occurs. At that point, it will try to reach some location near the right edge of the screen and get stuck with the pink and red ghost instead. The orange ghost is the only one still on the loose, but he is no real threat since he runs to his corner whenever Pac-Man gets close so that it is easy to eat all the dots. Emulators and code analysis have revealed what would happen if this 256th level is cleared: the fruit and intermissions would restart at level 1 conditions, but the enemies would retain their higher speed and invulnerability to power pellets from the higher stages.|$|E

40|$|Current {{prophylactic}} vaccines against {{human papillomavirus}} (HPV) target {{two of the}} most oncogenic types, HPV- 16 and - 18, which contribute to roughly 70 % of cervical cancers worldwide. Second-generation HPV vaccines include a 9 -valent vaccine, which targets five additional oncogenic HPV types (i. e., 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58) that contribute to another 15 - 30 % of cervical cancer cases. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine a range of vaccine costs for which the 9 -valent vaccine would be cost-effective in comparison to the current vaccines in two less developed countries (i. e., Kenya and Uganda). The analysis was performed using a natural history disease simulation model of HPV and cervical cancer. The mathematical model simulates individual women from an early age and tracks health events and resource use as they transition through clinically-relevant health states over their lifetime. Epidemiological data on HPV prevalence and cancer incidence were used to adapt the model to Kenya and Uganda. Health benefit, or effectiveness, from HPV vaccination was measured in terms of life expectancy, and costs were measured in international dollars (I$). The incremental cost of the 9 -valent vaccine included the added cost of the vaccine counterbalanced by costs averted from additional cancer cases prevented. All future costs and health benefits were discounted at an annual rate of 3 % in the base case analysis. We conducted sensitivity analyses to investigate how infection with multiple HPV types, unidentifiable HPV types in cancer cases, and cross-protection against non-vaccine types could affect the potential cost range of the 9 -valent vaccine. In the base case analysis in Kenya, we found that vaccination with the 9 -valent vaccine was very cost-effective (i. e., had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio below per-capita GDP), compared to the current vaccines provided the added cost of the 9 -valent vaccine did not exceed I$ 9. 7 per vaccinated girl. To be considered very cost-effective, the added cost per vaccinated girl could go up to I$ 5. 2 and I$ 16. 2 in the worst-case and <b>best-case</b> <b>scenarios,</b> respectively. At a willingness-to-pay threshold of three times per-capita GDP where the 9 -valent vaccine would be considered cost-effective, the thresholds of added costs associated with the 9 -valent vaccine were I$ 27. 3, I$ 14. 5 and I$ 45. 3 per vaccinated girl for the base case, worst-case and <b>best-case</b> <b>scenarios,</b> respectively. In Uganda, vaccination with the 9 -valent vaccine was very cost-effective when the added cost of the 9 -valent vaccine did not exceed I$ 8. 3 per vaccinated girl. To be considered very cost-effective, the added cost per vaccinated girl could go up to I$ 4. 5 and I$ 13. 7 in the worst-case and <b>best-case</b> <b>scenarios,</b> respectively. At a willingness-to-pay threshold of three times per-capita GDP, the thresholds of added costs associated with the 9 -valent vaccine were I$ 23. 4, I$ 12. 6 and I$ 38. 4 per vaccinated girl for the base case, worst-case and <b>best-case</b> <b>scenarios,</b> respectively. This study provides a threshold range of incremental costs associated with the 9 -valent HPV vaccine that would make it a cost-effective intervention in comparison to currently available HPV vaccines in Kenya and Uganda. These prices represent a 71 % and 61 % increase over the price offered to the GAVI Alliance ($ 5 per dose) for the currently available 2 - and 4 -valent vaccines in Kenya and Uganda, respectively. Despite evidence of cost-effectiveness, critical challenges around affordability and feasibility of HPV vaccination and other competing needs in low-resource settings such as Kenya and Uganda remain...|$|R
