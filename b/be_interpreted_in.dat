5|$|Article8 {{recognises}} {{the right}} of workers to form or join trade unions and protects the right to strike. It allows these rights to be restricted {{for members of the}} armed forces, police, or government administrators. Several parties have placed reservations on this clause, allowing it to <b>be</b> <b>interpreted</b> <b>in</b> a manner consistent with their constitutions (e.g.,China, Mexico), or extending the restriction of union rights to groups such as firefighters (e.g.,Japan).|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} {{the appeals}} process, the case was heard by the Supreme Court of India; the court ruled in Jindal's favour, asking the Government of India to {{consider}} the matter. The Union Cabinet of India then amended the Indian Flag Code with effect from 26 January 2002, allowing private citizens to hoist the flag on any day of the year, subject to their safeguarding the dignity, honour and respect of the flag. It is also held that the code was not a statute and restrictions under the code ought to be followed; also, the right to fly the flag is a qualified right, unlike the absolute rights guaranteed to citizens, and should <b>be</b> <b>interpreted</b> <b>in</b> the context of Article 19 of the Constitution of India.|$|E

5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the Court of Appeal's judgment can <b>be</b> <b>interpreted</b> <b>in</b> one of two ways: that the exercise of a power is not amenable to judicial review either if it has no public element altogether, or if it has an insufficient public element. Neither of these interpretations is without complications. As regards the first interpretation, {{it may be difficult to}} conceive of an exercise of statutory power that has no public element at all. If the second interpretation is correct, there is doubt as to the level of sufficiency required for the exercise of a power to be amenable to judicial review as the Court did not explain this.|$|E
5|$|The Shiva-related {{tradition}} {{is a major}} part of Hinduism, found all over India, Nepal, Sri Lanka, and Bali (Indonesia). Its historical roots are unclear and contested. Some scholars such Yashodhar Mathpal and Ali Javid have interpreted early prehistoric paintings at the Bhimbetka rock shelters, carbon dated to be from pre-10,000 BCE period, as Shiva dancing, Shiva's trident, and his mount Nandi. However, Howard Morphy states that these prehistoric rock paintings of India, when seen in their context, are likely those of hunting party with animals, and that the figures in a group dance can <b>be</b> <b>interpreted</b> <b>in</b> many different ways. Rock paintings from Bhimbetka, depicting a figure with a trishul, have been described as Nataraja by Erwin Neumayer, who dates them to the mesolithic.|$|E
5|$|Stephen's {{first few}} years as king can <b>be</b> <b>interpreted</b> <b>in</b> {{different}} ways. From a positive perspective, he stabilised the northern border with Scotland, contained Geoffrey's attacks on Normandy, was at peace with Louis VI, enjoyed {{good relations with the}} church and had the broad support of his barons. There were significant underlying problems, nonetheless. The north of England was now controlled by David and Prince Henry, Stephen had abandoned Wales, the fighting in Normandy had considerably destabilised the duchy, and an increasing number of barons felt that Stephen had given them neither the lands nor the titles they felt they deserved or were owed. Stephen was also rapidly running out of money: Henry's considerable treasury had been emptied by 1138 due to the costs of running Stephen's more lavish court and the need to raise and maintain his mercenary armies fighting in England and Normandy.|$|E

5|$|In aqueous solution, the {{alkali metal}} ions form aqua ions of the formula +, where n is the {{solvation}} number. Their coordination numbers and shapes agree well with those expected from their ionic radii. In aqueous solution the water molecules directly {{attached to the}} metal ion are said {{to belong to the}} first coordination sphere, also known as the first, or primary, solvation shell. The bond between a water molecule and the metal ion is a dative covalent bond, with the oxygen atom donating both electrons to the bond. Each coordinated water molecule may be attached by hydrogen bonds to other water molecules. The latter are said to reside in the second coordination sphere. However, for the alkali metal cations, the second coordination sphere is not well-defined as the +1 charge on the cation is not high enough to polarise the water molecules in the primary solvation shell enough for them to form strong hydrogen bonds with those in the second coordination sphere, producing a more stable entity. The solvation number for Li+ has been experimentally determined to be 4, forming the tetrahedral +: while solvation numbers of 3 to 6 have been found for lithium aqua ions, solvation numbers less than 4 {{may be the result of}} the formation of contact ion pairs, and the higher solvation numbers may <b>be</b> <b>interpreted</b> <b>in</b> terms of water molecules that approach + through a face of the tetrahedron, though molecular dynamic simulations may indicate the existence of an octahedral hexaaqua ion. There are also probably six water molecules in the primary solvation sphere of the sodium ion, forming the octahedral + ion. While it was previously thought that the heavier alkali metals also formed octahedral hexaaqua ions, it has since been found that potassium and rubidium probably form the + and + ions, which have the square antiprismatic structure, and that caesium forms the 12-coordinate + ion.|$|E
