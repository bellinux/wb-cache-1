The paper presents the results of a research project that aimed 1) to examine the feasibility of MFA at the regional and urban scale in France, 2) to select the most appropriate method, 3) to identify the available data, then 4) to realise the material balance in the specific case of Paris and its region. On the basis of the Eurostat method, the study was conducted at three levels: Paris (2. 2 million inhab.), Paris and its suburbs (6. 3 million inhab.) and the whole region (11. 3 million inhab.). The data collection revealed the lack of information about solid wastes and energy consumption (a very paradoxical situation!) but was successful enough to allow the realisation of the material <b>balance</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>year</b> 2003 (but not to calculate hidden flows). The results show the need for a multi-scale approach as urban life in Paris depends on the suburbs; the consequence of both concentration of activities in the city centre and urban sprawl on material flows; the poor recycling and the huge flow to nature, etc. They encourage using MFA in the urban context as a basis to material flow management and to dematerialisation...|$|E
40|$|Water is an {{essential}} resource that requires careful management at all golf courses located in southern Arizona. The Arizona Department of Water Resources, through its enforcement of irrigation water duties, is forcing the golf industry to reduce water usage. The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate turfgrass performance and the potential for soil salinization, when high maintenance desert turf systems are irrigated in accordance with the present Tucson area water duty of 1. 4 ha-m/ha/yr (4. 6 ac-ft/ac/yr). Two large weighing lysimeters supporting year-round turf systems consisting of bermudagrass (Cynodon dactylon x transvalensis (L.) pers.) overseeded with intermediate ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum x perenne) were irrigated at rates not to exceed the ADWR water duty using either low salinity (EC = 0. 25 dS/m) groundwater or higher salinity effluent water (EC = 1. 0 dS/m). Irrigation treatments were initiated in August 1997 and continued through September 1998 and consisted of applying water daily at rates set by applying appropriate crop coefficients to values of reference evapotranspiration generated by an on-site weather station. Soil moisture and salinity regimes were monitored weekly using the lysimeter subsurface sampling system and time domain reflectometry (TDR). Water percolating below the root zone was quantified and sub-sampled to facilitate assessment of leaching fractions and total lysimeter salt <b>balance.</b> <b>For</b> <b>the</b> <b>year</b> ending 30 Sept. 1998, each lysimeter received — 1729 mm (68 in.) of water comprised of 1296 mm (51 in.) of irrigation water and 433 mm (17 in.) of precipitation. Turfgrass evapotranspiration (ET) totaled 1419 mm (56 in.) for the lysimeter irrigated with groundwater (east lysimeter) and 1466 mm (58 in.) for the lysimeter irrigated with effluent (west lysimeter). Approximately 421 and 311 mm of drainage water was removed from the east and west lysimeters, respectively, establishing leaching fractions of 0. 24 in the east lysimeter and 0. 18 in the west lysimeter. Salts accumulated in both lysimeters over the course of the study; however, the substantial amount of drainage did not allow for salts to accumulate to harmful levels. Turfgrass performance, as quantified by turf quality and growth was acceptable or better during most months of the study. Crop coefficients (Kcs) were slightly higher than previous years, however, Kcs compared favorably to previous research at the study site. Summer Kcs averaged 0. 79 and were significantly higher than winter Kcs that averaged 0. 73. Turf irrigated with effluent produced better quality turf and used slightly more water than turf irrigated with groundwater. These data indicate that the present ADWR water duty of 1. 4 ha-m/ha/yr (4. 6 acre-ft/acre/yr) is adequate to replace turfgrass evapotranspiration and provide for leaching of salts when rainfall exceeds normal amounts, assuming no water loss due to irrigation and plumbing inefficiencies...|$|E

This article estimates global bioenergy potentials in <b>the</b> <b>year</b> 2050, following a “food first” approach. It presents integrated food, livestock, agriculture, and bioenergy scenarios <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>year</b> 2050 based on a consistent representation of FAO projections of future agricultural development in a global biomass balance model. The model discerns 11 regions, 10 crop aggregates, 2 livestock aggregates, and 10 food aggregates. It incorporates detailed accounts of land use, global net primary production (NPP) and its human appropriation as well as socioeconomic biomass flow <b>balances</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>year</b> 2000 that are modified according {{to a set of}} scenario assumptions to derive <b>the</b> biomass potential <b>for</b> 2050. We calculate the amount of biomass required to feed humans and livestock, considering losses between biomass supply and provision of final products. Based on this biomass balance as well as on global land-use data, we evaluate the potential to grow bioenergy crops and estimate the residue potentials from cropland (forestry is outside the scope of this study). We assess the sensitivity of the biomass potential to assumptions on diets, agricultural yields, cropland expansion and climate change. We use the dynamic global vegetation model LPJmL to evaluate possible impacts of changes in temperature, precipitation, and elevated CO 2 on agricultural yields. We find that the gross (primary) bioenergy potential ranges from 64 to 161  EJ y− 1, depending on climate impact, yields and diet, while the dependency on cropland expansion is weak. We conclude that food requirements for a growing world population, in particular feed required for livestock, strongly influence bioenergy potentials, and that integrated approaches are needed to optimize food and bioenergy supply...|$|R

We build a new fi rm-level dataset that combines a global M&A database with <b>balance</b> sheet data <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>years</b> 2000 – 2007. Combining matching techniques with a diff erence-in-diff erences estimator, we fi nd that cross-border deals boost on average domestic employment, sales, and investment, {{and they are not}} accompanied by a downsizing of the domestic labor force in neither of both countries. Further, acquisitions in knowledge-intensive industries lead to improvements in domestic productivity. Our results display some heterogeneity across industries and types of acquisitions, suggesting a connection between <b>the</b> motives <b>for</b> international acquisitions and their resulting effects.

50|$|The {{number of}} U.S. workers per retiree was 5.1 in 1960; this {{declined}} to 3.0 in 2009 and {{is projected to}} decline to 2.1 by 2030. The number of Social Security program recipients {{is expected to increase}} from 44 million in 2010 to 73 million in 2030. The present value of unfunded obligations under Social Security as of August 2010 was approximately $5.4 trillion. In other words, this amount would have to be set aside today such that the principal and interest would cover the shortfall over <b>the</b> next 75 <b>years.</b> <b>The</b> Social Security Administration projects that an increase in payroll taxes equivalent to 1.9% of the payroll tax base or 0.7% of GDP would be necessary to put the Social Security program in fiscal <b>balance</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> next 75 <b>years.</b> Over an infinite time horizon, these shortfalls average 3.4% of the payroll tax base and 1.2% of GDP.|$|R
50|$|The CBO {{projected}} in 2010 that {{an increase}} in payroll taxes ranging from 1.6%-2.1% of the payroll tax base, equivalent to 0.6%-0.8% of GDP, {{would be necessary to}} put the Social Security program in fiscal <b>balance</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> next 75 <b>years.</b> In other words, raising the payroll tax rate to about 14.4% during 2009 (from the current 12.4%) or cutting benefits by 13.3% would address the program's budgetary concerns indefinitely; these amounts increase to around 16% and 24% if no changes are made until 2037. The value of unfunded obligations under Social Security during FY 2009 was approximately $5.4 trillion. In other words, this amount would have to be set aside today such that the principal and interest would cover the shortfall over <b>the</b> next 75 <b>years.</b> Projections of Social Security's solvency are sensitive to assumptions about rates of economic growth and demographic changes.|$|R
40|$|Diploma thesis {{deals with}} the US {{external}} economic balance, particularly balance of payments, international investment position, indebtness and the dollar exchange rate. The first part includes the theoretical approach to external economic balance and related terms. Furthermore, I focus {{on the status of}} current and financial account of the United States in detail. Here I evaluate the balances of BOP parts and search <b>for</b> <b>the</b> explanation of this situation. I also focus on international investment position of the United States, the development of foreign direct investment and debt indicators. The work also contains a detailed analysis of the U. S. <b>balance</b> of payments <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>years</b> 2004 - 2008.

50|$|In December, 1762, Pendleton had {{submitted}} a clean {{report on the}} Treasury's condition to the House of Burgesses. In May, 1763, Richard Bland, Richard Henry Lee and Benjamin Harrison had prepared a detailed report which again found nothing wrong, although Pendleton as executor later found the Treasury books had not been <b>balanced</b> <b>for</b> <b>years.</b> <b>The</b> report of yet another committee, established in December 1764, that Pendleton chaired and which included the previous committee members as well as John Page, Dudley Digges, Archibald Cary and Lewis Burwell, had been delayed until the following May. In the legislative session held {{during the spring of}} 1765, burgesses debated borrowing £100,000 sterling from Britain to lend within the colony. Shortly after Robinson died on May 11, 1766, burgess Bland proposed a similar bank with £200,000 to lend at 5% interest.|$|R
