5|$|It was {{not until}} 1840, that the Salukis were first brought to England. Referred to as Slughis, they and the modern Sloughi were treated as the same breed; however, recent genetic tests {{have shown that the}} two breeds are genetically separate. The first {{successful}} modern <b>breeding</b> <b>line</b> of Salukis began in 1895, with Florence Amherst (daughter of the 1st Baron Amherst of Hackney). Having seen Salukis on a Nile tour in that year, she imported a breeding pair from the Al Salihah area of Lower Egypt. A champion of breed purity, she struggled alone for nearly three decades, and real Saluki popularity did not take hold until the early 1920s, when officers returning from the war in the Middle East and the Arab Revolt brought their pet Salukis home with them.|$|E

Tizamazing sold for $1million at Keeneland as a yearling, but owing to a {{training}} injury she never raced. Tizamazing's dam, Cee's Song, is credited with raising the respect breeders have for her female <b>breeding</b> <b>line,</b> Thoroughbred family 26, {{as one of the}} top distaff lines in America. Five full siblings out of Cee's Song were either race winners or the dams of race winners: Tiznow, Tizbud and Tizdubai are all stakes winners, Oxbow's dam Tizamazing and Paynter's dam Tizso both produced stakes winners. Another offspring of Cee's Song, the gelding Budroyale, was second in the 1999 Breeders' Cup Classic. Oxbow's pedigree is outcrossed for four generations, with very little inbreeding. Oxbow is only inbred 4x5x5 to Northern Dancer, meaning that this horse appears once in the fourth and twice in the fifth generation of Oxbow's pedigree.|$|E

40|$|The {{behavior}} of seven faba bean <b>breeding</b> <b>lines</b> toward Orobanche foetida and Orobanche crenata infestation was examined under field, pots, and in vitro conditions and compared to reference cultivars. The <b>breeding</b> <b>lines</b> presented resistance reaction to Orobanche spp. in different experiment conditions. In infested field by O. foetida, the grain yield reduction ranged from 55. 7 to 83 % for the <b>breeding</b> <b>lines</b> compared to 97 % for the susceptible cultivar Badï. Lines L 6 and L 7 were the less affected by Orobanche parasitism considering severity, number of emerged Orobanche, and yield.

In Petri dish experiment, Orobanche germination reached the highest rates; 69. 9 and 59. 7 %, respectively, with O. crenata and O. foetida for Badï. For the <b>breeding</b> <b>lines,</b> it ranged from 6. 3 to 44. 9 % for O. crenata and from 4. 8 to 40. 8 % for O. foetida. Moreover, all <b>breeding</b> <b>lines</b> showed low tubercles number and delay in Orobanche attachments as compared to Badï. All <b>breeding</b> <b>lines,</b> except L 5, maintained an acceptable level of resistance to Orobanche species manifested by a reduced Orobanche germination rate, low Orobanche number and dry weight, delay of attachments, and higher grain production compared to Badï.

The Thai accessions were selected from all rice ecologies such as irrigated, deep water, upland, and rainfed lowland ecosystems. The IRRI accessions were groups of germplasm having agronomic desirable traits, including temperature-sensitive genetic male sterility (TGMS), new plant type, early flowering, and biotic and abiotic stress resistances. Most of the InDel markers were genes with diverse functions. These markers produced the total of 127 alleles for all loci, {{with a mean of}} 6.68 alleles per locus, and a mean Polymorphic Information Content (PIC) of 0.440.

During the 1970 s and 1980 s, the pearl millet improvement at ICRISAT, Patancheru, emphasized on: (i) developing a diverse range of traitspecific composites, based on the germplasm largely from the Western and Central Africa; (ii) improving them {{by the process of}} recurrent selection, principally for grain yield and downy mildew (Sclerospora graminicola (Sacc.)

40|$|Since the mid- 1990 s, the {{cultivation}} of white lupin (Lupinus albus L.) has rapidly decreased in Germany and other countries in Central Europe because of the occurrence of Colletotrichum lupini, the causal agent of the fungal disease anthracnose, {{and the lack of}} varieties with a sufficient resistance towards this disease. To reestablish the relevance of cultivating white lupins, the development of new varieties with improved resistance is vital. In the study presented here, new <b>breeding</b> <b>lines</b> were evaluated from 2012 to 2014 on a total of five experimental sites in Germany.
