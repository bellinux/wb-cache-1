5|$|On 1 November 1941, Lent became acting Group Commander Gruppenkommandeur of {{the newly}} formed II./NJG2. Lent's first aerial victory as a Gruppenkommandeur, his 20th night-time, and his last in 1941, came during the night of Friday 7 November to Saturday 8 November. He shot down a Wellington 1C heading for Berlin, which came down near Akkrum. The six-man crew of the bomber, X9976 of No. 75 (New Zealand) Squadron, was killed in action. This {{achievement}} earned Lent a reference in the Wehrmachtbericht (his first of six in total), an information bulletin issued by {{the headquarters of the}} Wehrmacht.

Article 20 describes at length the offenses committed by Gaveston; {{he was once}} more condemned to exile and was to abjure the realm by 1 November. The bankers of the Italian Frescobaldi company were arrested, and their goods seized. It was held that the king’s great financial dependence on the Italians was politically unfortunate. The last individuals to <b>be</b> <b>singled</b> <b>out</b> for punishment were Henry de Beaumont and his sister, Isabella de Vescy, two foreigners associated with the king’s household. Though {{it is difficult to}} say why these two received particular mention, it could be related to the central position of their possessions in the Scottish war.|$|E

In contrast, itinerant merchants were often richer due to their trade between a network of towns and cities and their ability to avoid registering as merchants. Starting with Emperor Gaozu's reign, registered merchants were banned from wearing silk clothes, riding on horseback, or holding public office. This is in stark contrast to unregistered itinerant merchants who Chao Cuo (d. 154 BCE) states wore fine silks, rode in carriages pulled by fat horses, and whose wealth allowed them to associate with government officials.|$|E

25|$|Greece {{is ranked}} {{as the first}} country in the Balkans with most people who were awarded as Righteous Among the Nations. The Greek {{population}} was significantly active in hiding fellow Greeks of Jewish religion from the Nazi German forces during the Axis occupation of Greece. Even though Jews of Thessaloniki were easily deported from Thessaloniki, collaboration was minimal in capital Athens, where Nazi propaganda was not as effective, as the ancient Romaniote Jewish communities were well-integrated into the Orthodox Greek society and could not easily <b>be</b> <b>singled</b> <b>out</b> from the Christians, who in turn were more ready to resist the German authorities' demands. The Archbishop of Athens Damaskinos ordered his priests to ask their congregations to help the Jews and sent a strong-worded letter of protest to the collaborationist authorities and the Germans. Many Orthodox Christians risked their lives hiding Jews in their apartments and homes, despite threat of imprisonment. Even the Greek police ignored instructions to turn over Jews to the Germans. When Jewish community leaders appealed to Prime Minister Ioannis Rallis, he tried to alleviate their fears {{by saying that the}} Jews of Thessaloniki had been guilty of subversive activities and that this was the reason they were deported. At the same time, Elias Barzilai, the Grand Rabbi of Athens, was summoned to the Department of Jewish Affairs and told to submit a list of names and addresses of members of the Jewish community. Instead he destroyed the community records, thus saving the lives of thousands of Athenian Jews. He advised the Jews of Athens to flee or go into hiding. A few days later, the Rabbi himself was spirited out of the city by EAM-ELAS fighters and joined the resistance. EAM-ELAS helped hundreds of Jews escape and survive (especially officer Stefanos Sarafis), many of whom stayed with the resistance as fighters and/or interpreters.|$|E

[...] The dispute escalated to a rent of £370 per year being demanded. In the complicated lead up to the split in the club, the rent dispute is too simplistic to <b>be</b> <b>singled</b> <b>out</b> as the prime cause.

500|$|At Derby, County {{took the}} lead after 17minutes when an {{attempted}} clearance by Jenkyns was turned into his own net, and increased it to 4–0 {{in the second half}} before Frank Mobley broke away to score a late consolation. As the players were leaving the field, they were verbally abused by a section of the crowd, who believed the play had been unnecessarily rough. Jenkyns, who appeared to <b>be</b> <b>singled</b> <b>out</b> for particular abuse, grabbed one of the spectators by the throat. Other players separated the pair, and the police became involved. After an investigation, the club committee decided to suspend Jenkyns {{for the rest of the}} season, and release him thereafter. The Dart suggested that [...] "the supporters of this club praise the executive for their maintenance of discipline and decorum". Jack Oliver took over the captaincy and Teddy Jolly played at centre-half for the Birmingham Charity Cup semi-final, in which Small Heath finally beat West Bromwich Albion at the sixth attempt.|$|E
500|$|According to the German {{historian}} Felix Römer the named {{reference in}} the Wehrmachtbericht ("" [...] or [...] ""), among other military decorations, was an award {{and played a}} critical role of utmost importance (...) for all German soldiers. Römer stated that military decorations in general created respect and symbolized soldiery masculinity. For the German military, awards and decorations created an indispensable environment of incentives and willingness to risk ones live in combat. As an award, the named reference in the Wehrmachtbericht was based on the Walther von Brauchitsch decree of 27 April 1940 and was published in the [...] (Army Ordinance Gazette) dated 6 May 1940. Murawski stated, in order for an individual or unit to <b>be</b> <b>singled</b> <b>out</b> by name in the Wehrmachtbericht, the soldier or unit had to distinguish themselves in combat. This distinction was made available across all ranks, ranging from a senior commander and officer to a low-ranking soldier. Another reason was reserved for admirals, generals and recipients of high awards who had been killed in action.|$|E
500|$|More recent views {{present the}} {{question}} of responsibility as more nuanced and complex – suggesting that Creutz cannot <b>be</b> <b>singled</b> <b>out</b> as solely responsible for the disaster. Historians Ingvar Sjöblom and Lars Ericson Wolke {{have pointed out that}} Creutz's position as admiral was comparable to that of a chief minister. He would have primarily been an administrator without the need for intimate knowledge of practical details; turning a ship in rough weather would have been the responsibility of his subordinates. Sjöblom has stressed that the disagreement between Major Ankarfjäll and Lieutenant Admiral Björnram on how much sail was needed wasted precious time in a situation where quick decisions were crucial. Creutz was also unique as a supreme commander of the navy since he had no experience of military matters. The Swedish naval officer corps in the late 17th century lacked the prestige of army commanders, and seasoned officers and even admirals could be outranked by inexperienced civilians or army commanders with little or no naval background. Maritime archaeologist Lars Einarsson has suggested that Creutz's [...] "choleric and willful temperament" [...] probably played a part, but that it could equally be blamed on an untrained and inexperienced crew and the open discord among the officers. According to Sjöblom it is still unclear to historians whether there was a designated ship commander on Kronan with overall responsibility.|$|E

500|$|Perkins brought {{discipline}} {{to a team}} that had been described as [...] "the country club of the NFL", and rebuilt the team with youth. Perkins claimed that the Buccaneers were more talented than the New York Giants team he had taken over in 1979, and selected a then-record 20 players in the 1987 NFL Draft. He improved their conditioning program, and instituted three-a-day practices. Perkins' harsh style was {{in stark contrast to}} the laid-back approach of his predecessor Bennett, of whom it was said that his [...] "idea of team discipline was everyone wearing the same color uniform on game day". Conditioning improvements included emphasizing free weights over Nautilus machines, to improve explosiveness. Players were also given pay incentives to work out, although Perkins expressed surprise that players should need extra incentive to improve their conditioning. The improved conditioning paid off early in the season: their opening-week 48–10 win over the Atlanta Falcons still (as of 2012) ranks as the most Buccaneer points scored in a game, matched only in Super Bowl XXXVII. The team had a 1–1 record when the season was disrupted by the 1987 players' strike. Unlike in previous seasons, when players' strikes stopped all play, the owners formed teams of replacement players to play the scheduled games. The Buccaneers had a 3–2 record when regular play resumed, and nearly beat a Chicago Bears team only one season removed from its Super Bowl victory. The game had been preceded by much media speculation over whether Bears star quarterback Jim McMahon would play. It was the first week since undergoing surgery after being dropped on his shoulder following a play the previous November that McMahon was in the Bears' lineup, although Mike Tomczak remained the starter for the game. The Buccaneers took a 20–0 lead and dominated the game for three quarters. Late in the third quarter, McMahon came off the bench and sparked the Bears to a 27–26 win, their biggest comeback in team history. Two weeks later, Tampa Bay had a 28–3 fourth quarter lead over the St. Louis Cardinals. In what is now the third-biggest comeback in NFL history, the Cardinals scored 4 touchdowns to win the game. The Buccaneers did not win again for the rest of the season. It was rare for an NFL team to fall into a season-long losing streak following such a defensive collapse. Once the Buccaneers were out of the playoff picture, Perkins began to prepare Testaverde for the next season. Testaverde's first start came on December 6 against the New Orleans Saints. His 369yards on 22 completions set a record for an NFL debut, but his two early fumbles set up a Saints lead that the Buccaneers were not able to overcome. Tackle Ron Heller, dispirited by Coach Perkins' confrontational attitude and three-a-day practices that he believed were causing unnecessary injuries to the players, got into a fight with Perkins at halftime of this game that led to his being traded to the Seattle Seahawks. In return, the Buccaneers received defensive lineman Randy Edwards and a 1989 6th-round draft pick that was used to select linebacker Derrick Little. Neither made the Buccaneers' squad. Heller went on to play seven more solid seasons. The Buccaneers finished the season with a 4–11 record. Their 3–4 division record placed them ahead of the 4–11 Detroit Lions for fourth place in the NFC Central. Ron Holmes had eight quarterback sacks despite appearing in only ten games. Ervin Randle, who was named a UPI Second Team All-NFC linebacker, was the only Buccaneer to <b>be</b> <b>singled</b> <b>out</b> for postseason honors.|$|E
