Traditionally parasite primarily meant an organism visible to the naked eye, or a macroparasite (such as a helminth). Microparasites are typically far smaller, such as protozoa, viruses, and bacteria. Examples of parasites include the plants mistletoe and cuscuta, and animals such as hookworms.|$|E

25|$|Study {{results of}} the {{long-term}} acoustic benefits of rubberized asphalt are inconclusive. Initial application of rubberized asphalt may provide 3–5 decibels (dB) reduction in tire-pavement source noise emissions; however, this translates to only 1–3 decibels (dB) in total traffic noise level reduction (due to the other components of traffic noise). Compared to traditional passive attenuating measures (e.g., noise walls and earth berms), rubberized asphalt provides shorter-lasting and lesser acoustic <b>benefits</b> <b>at</b> typically much greater expense.|$|E
25|$|The {{impending}} {{depletion of}} natural resources and increase of climate-changing greenhouse gasses should motivate us to examine how political, economic and social policies can benefit from alternative energy. Interestingly enough, shifting our dependence on fossil fuels with specific interest within just one of the above-mentioned factors easily <b>benefits</b> <b>at</b> least one other. For instance, photo voltaic (or solar) panels have a 15% efficiency when absorbing the sun's energy, but its construction demand has increased 120% within both commercial and residential properties. Additionally, this construction has led to a roughly 30% increase in work demands (Chen).|$|E
25|$|Further {{examples}} of Townshend's drug rehabilitation activism {{took place in}} the form of a 1984 benefit concert (incidentally the first live performance of Manchester band The Stone Roses), an article he wrote a few days later for Britain's Mail on Sunday urging better care for the nation's growing number of drug addicts, and the formation of a charitable organisation, Double-O Charities, to raise funds for the causes he'd recently championed. Townshend also personally sold fund-raising anti-heroin T-shirts at a series of UK Bruce Springsteen concerts and reportedly financed a trip for former Clash drummer Topper Headon to undergo drug rehabilitation treatment. Townshend's 1985–86 band, Deep End, played two <b>benefits</b> <b>at</b> Brixton Academy in 1985 for Double-O Charities.|$|E

25|$|A {{worker who}} starts {{benefits}} before normal retirement age has their benefit reduced {{based on the}} number of months before normal retirement age they start benefits.

Although winning {{the case in the}} district court in 2001, the judgment against the U.S. was overturned by the U.S. Court of Appeals in 2002. Congress later redressed this situation by establishing the TRICARE for Life (TFL) program, which restored TRICARE military medical benefits for career military retirees over the age of 65, making the retirees eligible for both programs with Medicare as the primary payer and TRICARE as the secondary payer.|$|E
25|$|Many factors affect people's {{retirement}} decisions. Retirement funding {{education is}} a big factor that affects the success of an individual’s retirement experience. Social Security clearly {{plays an important role}} because most individuals solely rely on Social Security as their only retirement option, when Social Security’s both trust funds are expected to be depleted by 2034. Knowledge affects an individual’s retirement decisions by simply finding more reliable retirement options such as, Individual Retirement Accounts or Employer-Sponsored Plans. In countries around the world, people {{are much more likely to}} retire at the early and normal retirement ages of the public pension system (e.g., ages 62 and 65 in the U.S.). This pattern cannot be explained by different financial incentives to retire at these ages since typically retirement <b>benefits</b> <b>at</b> these ages are approximately actuarially fair; that is, the present value of lifetime pension benefits (pension wealth) conditional on retiring at age a is approximately the same as pension wealth conditional on retiring one year later at age a+1. Nevertheless, a large literature has found that individuals respond significantly to financial incentives relating to retirement (e.g., to discontinuities stemming from the Social Security earnings test or the tax system).|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{estimate}} {{the effect of}} adding exercise classes, spinal manipulation delivered in NHS or private premises, or manipulation followed by exercise to "best care" in general practice for patients consulting with back pain. Design: Pragmatic randomised trial with factorial design. Setting: 181 general practices in Medical Research Council General Practice Research Framework; 63 community settings around 14 centres across the United Kingdom. Participants: 1334 patients consulting their general practices about low back pain. Main outcome measures: Scores on the Roland Morris disability questionnaire at three and 12 months, adjusted for centre and baseline scores. Results: All groups improved over time. Exercise improved mean disability questionnaire scores at three months by 1. 4 (95 % confidence interval 0. 6 to 2. 1) more than "best care. " For manipulation the additional improvement was 1. 6 (0. 8 to 2. 3) at three months and 1. 0 (0. 2 to 1. 8) at 12 months. For manipulation followed by exercise the additional improvement was 1. 9 (1. 2 to 2. 6) at three months and 1. 3 (0. 5 to 2. 1) at 12 months. No significant differences in outcome occurred between manipulation in NHS premises and in private premises. No serious adverse events occurred. Conclusions: Relative to "best care" in general practice, manipulation followed by exercise achieved a moderate <b>benefit</b> <b>at</b> three months and a small <b>benefit</b> <b>at</b> 12 months; spinal manipulation achieved a small to moderate <b>benefit</b> <b>at</b> three months and a small <b>benefit</b> <b>at</b> 12 months; and exercise achieved a small <b>benefit</b> <b>at</b> three months but not 12 months...|$|R
