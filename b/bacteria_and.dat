5|$|A {{pathogen}} is only {{successful in}} infecting an organism {{if it can}} get past its defenses. Pathogenic <b>bacteria</b> <b>and</b> protozoa have developed {{a variety of methods}} to resist attacks by phagocytes, and many actually survive and replicate within phagocytic cells.|$|E

5|$|A {{virus is}} a small {{infectious}} agent that replicates only inside the living cells of other organisms. Viruses can infect all types of life forms, from animals and plants to microorganisms, including <b>bacteria</b> <b>and</b> archaea.|$|E
50|$|The {{cellular}} reproduction shows {{a strong}} synergistic adaptation between the <b>bacterium</b> <b>and</b> the protozoan. As each symbiont is each {{of a single}} <b>bacterium</b> <b>and</b> a protozoan, and each daughter cell contains the same number, the two cells divide in a coordinated process. The bacterium divides first, followed by the protozoan organelles, and lastly the nucleus.|$|R

50|$|A {{bacillus}} (plural bacilli) is a rod-shaped bacterium. Although Bacillus, capitalized and italicized, specifically {{refers to}} the genus, the word bacillus (plural bacilli) may {{also be used to}} describe any rod-shaped <b>bacterium,</b> <b>and</b> in this sense, bacilli are found in many different taxonomic groups of bacteria. There is no connection between the shape of a <b>bacterium</b> <b>and</b> its colors in the Gram staining.|$|R
5|$|Archaea {{are genetically}} {{distinct}} from <b>bacteria</b> <b>and</b> eukaryotes, {{with up to}} 15% of the proteins encoded by any one archaeal genome being unique to the domain, although most of these unique genes have no known function. Of {{the remainder of the}} unique proteins that have an identified function, most belong to the Euryarchaea and are involved in methanogenesis. The proteins that archaea, <b>bacteria</b> <b>and</b> eukaryotes share form a common core of cell function, relating mostly to transcription, translation, and nucleotide metabolism. Other characteristic archaeal features are the organization of genes of related functionâ€”such as enzymes that catalyze steps in the same metabolic pathway into novel operons, and large differences in tRNA genes and their aminoacyl tRNA synthetases.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Somatic cell score (SCS) {{has been}} {{promoted}} as a selection criterion to improve mastitis resistance. However, SCS from healthy and infected animals may be considered as separate traits. Moreover, imperfect sensitivity and specificity could influence animals' classification and impact on estimated variance components. This study was aimed at: (1) estimating the heritability of bacteria negative SCS, <b>bacteria</b> positive SCS, <b>and</b> infection status, (2) estimating phenotypic and genetic correlations between <b>bacteria</b> negative <b>and</b> <b>bacteria</b> positive SCS, <b>and</b> the genetic correlation between <b>bacteria</b> negative SCS <b>and</b> infection status, and (3) evaluating the impact of imperfect diagnosis of infection on variance component estimates. Methods Data on SCS and udder infection status for 1, 120 ewes were collected from four Valle del Belice flocks. The pedigree file included 1, 603 animals. The SCS dataset was split according to whether animals were infected or not {{at the time of}} sampling. A repeatability test-day animal model was used to estimate genetic parameters for SCS traits and the heritability of infection status. The genetic correlation between <b>bacteria</b> negative SCS <b>and</b> infection status was estimated using an MCMC threshold model, implemented by Gibbs Sampling. Results The heritability was 0. 10 for bacteria negative SCS, 0. 03 for <b>bacteria</b> positive SCS, <b>and</b> 0. 09 for infection status, on the liability scale. The genetic correlation between <b>bacteria</b> negative <b>and</b> <b>bacteria</b> positive SCS was 0. 62, suggesting that they may be genetically different traits. The genetic correlation between <b>bacteria</b> negative SCS <b>and</b> infection status was 0. 51. We demonstrate that imperfect diagnosis of infection leads to underestimation of differences between <b>bacteria</b> negative <b>and</b> <b>bacteria</b> positive SCS, <b>and</b> we derive formulae to predict impacts on estimated genetic parameters. Conclusions The results suggest that <b>bacteria</b> negative <b>and</b> <b>bacteria</b> positive SCS are genetically different traits. A positive genetic correlation between <b>bacteria</b> negative SCS <b>and</b> liability to infection was found, suggesting that the approach of selecting animals for decreased SCS should help to reduce mastitis prevalence. However, the results show that imperfect diagnosis of infection has an impact on estimated genetic parameters, which may reduce the efficiency of selection strategies aiming at distinguishing between <b>bacteria</b> negative <b>and</b> <b>bacteria</b> positive SCS. </p...|$|R

5|$|The {{energy in}} {{sunlight}} is captured by plants, cyanobacteria, purple bacteria, green sulfur <b>bacteria</b> <b>and</b> some protists. This process is often coupled to {{the conversion of}} carbon dioxide into organic compounds, as part of photosynthesis, which is discussed below. The energy capture and carbon fixation systems can however operate separately in prokaryotes, as purple <b>bacteria</b> <b>and</b> green sulfur bacteria can use sunlight {{as a source of}} energy, while switching between carbon fixation and the fermentation of organic compounds.|$|E
5|$|They have {{membranes}} {{composed of}} glycerol-ether lipids, whereas <b>bacteria</b> <b>and</b> eukaryotes have membranes composed mainly of glycerol-ester lipids. The {{difference is the}} type of bond that joins the lipids to the glycerol moiety; the two types are shown in yellow in the figure at the right. In ester lipids this is an ester bond, whereas in ether lipids this is an ether bond. Ether bonds are chemically more resistant than ester bonds. This stability might help archaea to survive extreme temperatures and very acidic or alkaline environments. <b>Bacteria</b> <b>and</b> eukaryotes do contain some ether lipids, but in contrast to archaea these lipids are not a major part of their membranes.|$|E

5|$|Acne vulgaris is {{a chronic}} skin {{disease of the}} pilosebaceous unit and {{develops}} due to blockages in the skin's hair follicles. These blockages are thought to occur {{as a result of}} the following four abnormal processes: a higher than normal amount of oily sebum production (influenced by androgens), excessive deposition of the protein keratin leading to comedo formation, colonization of the follicle by Propionibacterium acnes (P. acnes) <b>bacteria,</b> <b>and</b> the local release of pro-inflammatory chemicals in the skin.|$|E

5|$|Americium is an {{artificial}} element of recent origin, and thus {{does not have}} a biological requirement. It is harmful to life. It has been proposed to use bacteria for removal of americium and other heavy metals from rivers and streams. Thus, Enterobacteriaceae of the genus Citrobacter precipitate americium ions from aqueous solutions, binding them into a metal-phosphate complex at their cell walls. Several studies have been reported on the biosorption and bioaccumulation of americium by <b>bacteria</b> <b>and</b> fungi.|$|E
5|$|Archaea were {{initially}} classified as bacteria, receiving the name archaebacteria (in the Archaebacteria kingdom), but this classification is outdated. Archaeal cells have unique properties separating {{them from the}} other two domains of life, <b>Bacteria</b> <b>and</b> Eukaryota. The Archaea are further divided into multiple recognized phyla. Classification is difficult because the majority have not been isolated in the laboratory and have only been detected by analysis of their nucleic acids in samples from their environment.|$|E
