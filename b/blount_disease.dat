40|$|Abstract: Although varus {{malalignment}} of {{the proximal}} tibia {{is the primary}} pathology in <b>Blount</b> <b>disease,</b> other deformities may exist. To assess multiplanar lower limb deformities, children with previously untreated early- and late-onset <b>Blount</b> <b>disease</b> who subsequently needed surgical correction were identified. Preoperative frontal and sagittal plane deformity analysis using Paley’s methodology and rotational profile assessment using prone clinical examination were performed by a single examiner. Results were compared between the 2 groups and with uninvolved limbs within each group. Additionally, rotational profile of the lower limb was compared with age-matched values. Over an 8 -year period, 60 limbs (40 patients) including 26 with early-onset and 34 with late-onset Blount met the inclusion criteria. Although both groups exhibited proximal tibial varus, procurvatum, and internal torsion, patients with early-onset <b>Blount</b> <b>disease</b> had greater severity. Unlike the younger patients, approxi-mately {{one third of the}} varus malalignment of the affected extremity was attributed to the distal femur in the late-onset patients. Neither group showed any significant deformity of the proximal femur and distal tibia or sagittal plane deformity of the distal femur. There was a correlation between the severity of varus malalignment of the limb with magnitude of proximal tibial deformities in both groups and with distal femoral varus in the late-onset group of patients.

Surgical treatment includes corrective osteotomy, lateral hemiepiphisyodesis, distraction of the proximal tibial physis, physeal bar resection and elevation of the medial tibial plateau. Case Outline. A case of a 4 -year-old girl with bow legs is presented. Condition was recognized as <b>Blount</b> <b>disease,</b> type five. Both lower legs were operated by medial methaphyseal semi-osteotomy of the proximal tibia with the elevation of the medial tibial plateau. Prospectively, bilateral proximal hemiepiphysiodesis was done. Total follow-up period was eighteen years. The patient has no disturbances, clinical and radiographic findings are excellent. Improvement of the femoro-tibial angle is 22 ° {{on the right side}}, and 21 ° on the left side. Improvement of the varus angle is 7 ° on the right side, and 27 ° on the left side. Medial plateau depression is completely bilaterally reduced; improvement on the right side is 46 °, and 51 ° on the left side. Conclusion. It is known today that multiplanar deformity {{is a part of the}} disease; varus, antecurvatum and internal rotation {{of the lower}} leg. By elevation of the medial plateau varus of the lower and antecurvatum component of deformity can be solved, while internal torsion cannot be solved. This deformity has to be either skillfully neglected, or corrected by an additional osteotomy by the elevation of the medial tibial plateau. Lateral hemiepiphysiodesis serves as extra stabilisator of the achieved result, and it is recommended to be done in combination with surgical elevation of the medial tibial plateau and derotative corrective osteotomy of the tibia.

The purpose of our {{study was to determine the}} intraobserver and interobserver reliability of measuring LLDwith both techniques, using computed radiography. The LLD was measured on 70 supine scanograms and standing anteroposterior radiographs of the lower extremity by 5 blinded observers on 2 separate occasions. Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and mean absolute difference (in millimeters) was calculated to assess intraobserver and interobserver reliability and found to be excellent for both radiographic techniques. Intraobserver ICC and mean absolute difference was 0. 975 to 0. 995 and 1. 5 to 2. 6 mm for scanogram and 0. 939 to 0. 996 and 1. 5 to 4. 6 mm for the standing radiograph, respectively. Repeated measurements for both radio-graphic studies werewithin 5 mmof the first measurement greater than 90 % and within 10 mm greater than 95 % of times. Interobserver ICC and mean absolute difference was 0. 979 and 2. 6 mm for scanogram and 0. 968 and 3. 0 mm for the standing radiograph. The reliability was excellent irrespective of age, sex, and underlying diagnosis other than <b>Blount</b> <b>disease,</b> which had good reliability. A standing anteroposterior radiograph of the lower extremity should be the imaging modality of choice when evaluating patients with limb length inequality who may have angular deformities because it allows a comprehensive evaluation of the extremity and is as reliable as a scanogram for measuring LLD. This approach may decrease the radiation exposure and financial burden involved in assessing patients with unequal limb lengths.

40|$|Summary: Debilitating rickets-like {{lower limb}} {{deformities}} {{are common in}} children throughout the world, particularly in Malawi, Africa where the causes are unknown. We have identified that <b>Blount</b> <b>disease</b> and calcium deficiency rickets are the likely causes of these deformities and propose calcium supplementation as a potential treatment of Malawian rickets. Introduction: Surgical correction of rickets-like lower limb deformities {{is the most common}} paediatric operation performed at Beit Cure Orthopaedic Hospital, Malawi. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the aetiology of these deformities. Methods: Children with a tibio-femoral angle of deformity > 20 ° were enrolled (n = 42, 3. 0 – 15. 0 years). Anthropometric and early life and well-being data were collected. Early morning serum and urine samples were collected on the morning of the operation for markers of calcium and phosphate homeostasis. Knee radiographs were obtained, and the children were diagnosed with either Blount (BD, n = 22) or evidence of rickets disease (RD, n = 20). As BD is a mechanical rather than metabolic disease, BD were assumed to be biochemically representative of the local population and thus used as a local reference for RD. Results: There were no differences in anthropometry or early life experiences between BD and RD. Parathyroid hormone (PTH), 1, 25 -dihydroxyvitamin D, total alkaline phosphatase and urinary phosphate were significantly higher and serum phosphate, 25 -hydroxyvitamin D (25 OHD) and tubular maximal reabsorption of phosphate significantly lower in RD than BD. There was no difference in serum calcium, fibroblast growth factor 23 or markers of iron status between groups. All children had 25 OHD > 25 nmol/L. Conclusions: Vitamin D deficiency is not implicated in the aetiology of RD or BD in Malawian children. The cause of RD in Malawi is likely to be dietary calcium deficiency leading to elevated PTH resulting in increased losses of phosphate from the bone and glomerular filtrate. The causes of BD remain unclear; there was no evidence in support of previously suggested risk factors such as being overweight or starting to walk early. Prior to surgical intervention, supplementation with calcium should be considered for children with RD...|$|E
