40|$|In deep-space optical communications, acquisition, tracking, and {{pointing}} are all challenging {{because of the}} stringent—on the order of submicroradian—pointing requirement. To achieve this level of pointing accuracy, one must maintain high-bandwidth tracking control. Feasible tracking <b>sources</b> (<b>beacons)</b> include uplink laser beams and celestial objects such as the Earth, Moon, and stars. However, these tracking sources do not all provide the kilohertz tracking rate needed for pointing in deep space. One approach to enable a high tracking rate is to augment the tracking loop with inertial sensors to estimate high-frequency beacon movements. In this article, we discuss the use of linear accelerometers, mounted in a configuration to measure angular displacement, to achieve high-bandwidth tracking with dim <b>beacon</b> <b>sources.</b> The advantages of linear accelerometers (or angular accelerometers) are their low cost, high bandwidth, and small size compared with other inertial sensors such as gyros.

40|$|Abstract. The Internet {{provides}} {{a wealth of}} useful information in {{a vast number of}} dynamic information sources, {{but it is difficult to}} determine which sources are useful for a given query. Most existing techniques either require explicit source cooperation (for example, by exporting data summaries), or build a relatively static source characterization (for example, by assigning a topic to the source). We present a system, called InfoBeacons, that takes a different approach: data and sources are left “as is, ” and a peer-to-peer network of beacons uses past query results to “guide ” queries to sources, who do the actual query processing. This approach has several advantages, including requiring minimal changes to sources, tolerance of dynamism and heterogeneity, and the ability to scale to large numbers of sources. We present the architecture of the system, and discuss the advantages of our design. We then focus on how a beacon can choose good sources for a query despite the loose coupling of <b>beacons</b> to <b>sources.</b> <b>Beacons</b> cache responses to previous queries and adapt the cache to changes at the source. The cache is then used to select good sources for future queries. We discuss results from a detailed experimental study using our beacon prototype which demonstrates that our “loosely coupled ” approach is effective; a beacon only has to contact sixty percent or less of the sources contacted by existing, tightly coupled approaches, while providing results of equivalent or better relevance to queries...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{innovative}} indoor navigation {{methods have}} been proposed {{to meet the challenges}} in robotic navigation systems. The general positioning methods for robotic navigation include vision-based approaches, WIFI beacons, infrared beacons, ultrasonic beacons, etc. However, the common problem with these methods is their inaccuracy. Especially, improving the precision of robotic positioning mechanisms is the key to indoor navigation systems. This paper proposes an approach that combines the external rotating beacon with an internal rotation of position sensitive devices (PSD) which are installed on the robot. While two infrared beams from an external <b>beacon</b> <b>source</b> are equally projected to both sides of the PSD, the robot‟s position can be calculated precisely. The high performance and accurate results can be achieved by optimizing the rotation aligning time, dividing the working area, and compensating errors with information fusion.

Two different techniques, based respectively on elevation-scanning Langley method and on surface meteorological data method, are proposed and compared to estimate the clear-air reference. Application to available Sun-tracking radiometric measurements at Ka, V and W band in Rome (NY, USA) is shown and discussed together with the test of new physically-based prediction models for allweather path attenuation estimation up to about 30 dB at V and W band from multi-channel microwave radiometric data.

30|$|Once the {{in-orbit}} {{optical system}} parameters have been calibrated, quantum transmission tests can begin. These {{will be conducted}} in eclipse (local night) when weather conditions are clear and the orbital track passes {{close enough to the}} OGS, rising at least 30 ∘ above the horizon. As the satellite begins to rise above the horizon, it will use ADCS to point the telescope towards the expected position of the OGS. Conversely, the OGS will track the satellite as it appears. Laser rangefinding pulses will provide precise position information for the OGS and it can begin transmitting the laser beacon. The satellite uses the beacon to operate the fine-pointing system.

40|$|Non-uniform patient {{attenuation}} maps can {{be acquired}} using an axially moving point {{source of a}} high energy isotope that emits a fanbeam of photons. We modeled the Beacon(TM) attenuation correction tool attached to multiheaded SPECT cameras which uses this approach.

Additionally the scatter of the <b>Beacon</b> <b>source</b> photons in the transmission window and the degrading downscatter on an emission photopeak window in simultaneous emission and transmission scanning were investigated. We performed multiple types of simulations including different crystal thicknesses and different collimators for protocol optimization purposes. The main conclusion of this work is that a thick crystal detector coupled to a LEHR collimator is the best solution for acquiring attenuation maps in low energy applications. For medium energy studies attenuation maps have to be rescaled {{to account for the}} low sensitivity {{near the center of the}} patient. Fully Monte Carlo simulating the projector for medium energy studies on low energy collimators in order to replace the MEGP collimators by their LEHR analogons is another possibility that is currently being investigated.

40|$|A novel {{waveguide}} multimode {{directional coupler}} (MDC) {{intended for the}} measurement and potential utilization of the second and higher order harmonic frequencies from high-power traveling wave tube amplifiers (TWTAs) has been successfully designed, fabricated, and tested. The design {{is based on the}} characteristic multiple propagation modes of the electrical and magnetic field components of electromagnetic waves in a rectangular waveguide. The purpose was to create a rugged, easily constructed, more efficient waveguide- based MDC for extraction and exploitation of the second harmonic signal from the RF output of high-power TWTs used for space communications. The application would be a satellitebased <b>beacon</b> <b>source</b> needed for Qband and V/W-band atmospheric propagation studies. The MDC could function as a CW narrow-band source or as a wideband source for study of atmospheric group delay effects on highdata- rate links. The MDC is fabricated from two sections of waveguide - a primary one for the fundamental frequency and a secondary waveguide for the second harmonic - that are joined together such that the second harmonic higher order modes are selectively coupled via precision- machined slots for propagation in the secondary waveguide. In the TWTA output waveguide port, both the fundamental and the second harmonic signals are present. These signals propagate in the output waveguide as the dominant and higher order modes, respectively. By including an appropriate mode selective waveguide directional coupler, such as the MDC presented here at the output of the TWTA, the power at the second harmonic can be sampled and amplified to the power level needed for atmospheric propagation studies. The important conclusions from the preliminary test results for the multimode directional coupler are: (1) the second harmonic (Ka-band) can be measured and effectively separated from the fundamental (Ku-band) with no coupling of the latter, (2) power losses in the fundamental frequency are negligible, and (3) the power level of the extracted second harmonic is sufficient for further amplification to power levels needed for practical applications. It was also demonstrated that third order and potentially higher order harmonics are measurable with this device. The design is frequency agnostic, and with the appropriate choice of waveguides, is easily scaled to higher frequency TWTs.

40|$|The ultra-stable <b>beacon</b> <b>source</b> (USBS) {{provides}} a laser-beam output {{with a very}} low angular jitter {{and can be used}} as an absolute angular reference to simulate a beacon in the laboratory. The laser is mounted {{on the top of a}} very short (approximately equal to 1 m) inverted pendulum (IP) with its optical axis parallel to the carbon fiber pendulum leg. The 85 -cm, carbon fiber rods making up the leg are very lightweight and rigid, and are supported by a flex-joint at the bottom (see figure). The gimbal-mounted laser is a weight-adjustable load of about 1. 5 kg with its center of rotation co-located with the center of percussion of the inverted pendulum. This reduces the coupling of transverse motion at the base of the pendulum to angular motion of the laser at the top. The inverted pendulum is mounted on a gimbal with its center of rotation coinciding with the pivot position of the inverted pendulum flexure joint. This reduces coupling of ground tilt at the inverted pendulum base to motion of the laser mounted at the top. The mass of the top gimbal is adjusted to give the pendulum a very low resonant frequency (approximately equal to 10 mHz) that filters transverse seismic disturbances from the ground where the base is attached. The motion of the IP is monitored by an optical-lever sensor. The laser light is reflected by the mirror on the IP, and then is detected by a quadrant photo-detector (QPD). The position of the beam spot on the QPD corresponds to the tilt of the IP. Damping of this motion is provided by two coil and magnet pairs. The bottom gimbal mount consists of two plates. The IP is mounted on the second plate. The first plate is supported by two posts through needles and can be rotated about the axis connecting the tips of the needles. The second plate hangs from the first plate and can be rotated about the axis perpendicular to the first plate. As a result, the second plate acts as a two-axis rotation stage. Its center of rotation is located at the effective bending point of the flex-joint. The second plate is pressed against two screw actuators by the weight of the IP. The screw actuators are orthogonal to each other and are used to adjust the inclination of the second plate. The actuators are driven by stepper motors. The whole IP system is housed in a box made of Lexan plastic plates to provide isolation from air currents and temperature variations. The signals from the sensors are processed and recorded with a PC using the xPC Target realtime environment of Math- Works. The control algorithms are written using the Simulink package from The MathWorks...|$|E

The technique in this thesis {{can be used to}} synchronize the carriers of two single antenna wireless transmitters (i. e. “sources”) with independent local clocks so that their bandpass transmissions arrive in-phase at an intended receiver (i. e. “destination”). Synchronization is achieved via: (i) an unmodulated beacon transmitted by the destination to the sources and (ii) a pair of secondary unmodulated <b>beacons</b> between the <b>sources.</b> No explicit channel state information is exchanged between the sources and/or the destination. Using this method, it is possible to realize a two-source distributed beamformer that provides a reduction in overall transmit energy and increased security due to the directionality of the transmitted signal.

The experimental results in this thesis confirm the theoretical predictions and also provide explicit guidelines for a real-time implementation of a two-source distributed beamforming system.

40|$|Controlled {{acoustic}} {{sources have}} typically {{been used for}} imaging the ocean. These sources can either be used to locate objects or characterize the ocean environment. The processing involves signal extraction {{in the presence of}} ambient noise, with shipping being a major component of the latter. With the advent of the Automatic Identification System (AIS) which provides accurate locations of all large commercial vessels, these major noise sources can be converted from nuisance to <b>beacons</b> or <b>sources</b> of opportunity for the purpose of studying the ocean. The source localization method presented here is similar to traditional matched field processing, but differs in that libraries of data-derived measured replicas are used in place of modeled replicas. In order to account for differing source spectra between library and target vessels, cross-correlation functions are compared instead of comparing acoustic signals directly. The library of measured cross-correlation function replicas is extrapolated using waveguide invariant theory to fill gaps between ship tracks, fully populating the search grid with estimated replicas allowing for continuous tracking. In addition to source localization, two ocean sensing techniques are discussed in this dissertation. The feasibility of estimating ocean sound speed and temperature structure, using ship noise across a drifting volumetric array of hydrophones suspended beneath buoys, in a shallow water marine environment is investigated. Using the attenuation of acoustic energy along eigenray paths to invert for ocean properties such as temperature, salinity, and pH is also explored.

However, in battlefield MFR is not suitable because it requires time sensitive application. The authors of [17] proposed link stability and path stability based routing to select path with minimum hop count. The distance between two adjacent nodes is computed using log distance path loss model.

40|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} optimal resource allocation {{in a power}} beacon-assisted wireless-powered communication network (PB-WPCN), which consists {{of a set of}} hybrid access point (AP) -source pairs and a power <b>beacon</b> (PB). Each <b>source,</b> which has no embedded power supply, first harvests energy from its associated AP and/or the PB in the downlink (DL) and then uses the harvested energy to transmit information to its AP in the uplink (UL). We consider both cooperative and non-cooperative scenarios based on whether the PB is cooperative with the APs or not. For the cooperative scenario, we formulate a social welfare maximization problem to maximize the weighted sum-throughput of all AP-source pairs, which is subsequently solved by a water-filling based distributed algorithm. In the non-cooperative scenario, all the APs and the PB are assumed to be rational and self-interested such that incentives from each AP are needed for the PB to provide wireless charging service. We then formulate an auction game and propose an auction based distributed algorithm by considering the PB as the auctioneer and the APs as the bidders. Finally, numerical results are performed to validate the convergence of both the proposed algorithms and demonstrate the impacts of various system parameters.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a protocol which improves {{on the power}} saving mechanism in the IEEE 802. 11 Distributed Coordination Function (DCF). In the power saving mechanism (PSM) for DCF, all nodes are synchronized by beacons. In each beacon interval, there is a fixed time interval called the ATIM window where every node has to be awake. During the ATIM window, a source node informs a destination node about a pending packet by transmitting an ATIM frame. When the destination node receives an ATIM frame, it replies with an ATIM-ACK. Both the source and destination nodes stay awake for the remaining <b>beacon</b> interval. The <b>source</b> can transmit data after the ATIM window finishes. A node {{that does not have}} traffic to send or receive can enter the doze state after its ATIM window finishes. During the ATIM window in PSM, no data transmission is allowed.

This paper proposes a protocol that removes the overhead of the ATIM window and uses the bandwidth for data transmission. Simulation results show that removing the ATIM window gives better aggregate throughput and energy saving...|$|R

Pebble lithology, detrital zircon geochronology, and till geochemistry were analyzed on samples from a 6. 5 km transect. Hummocky topography occurs {{with the most}} recently exposed material along the active ice margin (Zone 1), followed by a relatively flat and low region (Zone 2), and then a series of ~ 2 m high parallel/sub-parallel ridges and troughs accompanied by distinct color changes that {{are directly related to}} the dominant lithology of the region (Zones 3 – 5). Zone 3 is dominated by ~ 38 % more sedimentary rocks than adjacent zones and has an overall shape of a broad arch superimposed with smaller ridges. Zone 4 is composed of distinct colored bands that alternate between dominant sedimentary and mafic igneous lithologies. These dominant sedimentary and intermediate/mafic igneous rocks for all Zones are interpreted to be primarily the Beacon and Ferrar Supergroup rocks respectively. The U/Pb data from the till is consistent with a <b>Beacon</b> Supergroup <b>source</b> as samples consistently show significant populations from the Permian ~ 250 - 260 Ma, the Proterozoic ~ 565 – 600 Ma, ~ 950 – 1270 Ma, and ~ 2300 - 2320 Ma, as well as (and) the late Archean ~ 2700 - 2770 Ma. The Pagoda, Mackellar, Buckley, and Fremouw Formations are potential sources of the detrital zircons.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} the time {{resolved}} studies of light propagation through highly scattering media in two extreme cases are reported. The first case concerns media where the dominating process is multiple scattering with negligible absorption, {{with the second}} regime being media, which both scatter and amplify light. Light propagation is diffusive in both cases however a very interesting phenomenon {{takes place in the}} latter. In this extreme case light emanating from a random, highly disordered medium can have highly ordered (lasing) properties. This phenomenon namely random lasing has raised an enormous research interest. The final goal of the study was the investigation of the possible use of light transport through and the light emission from such media for the improvement of optical biopsy and imaging techniques. In the introductory part of the thesis the most common benign and malignant abnormalities occurring in the female breast as well as a synopsis of the present status on imaging techniques are given. Then an introduction is also made for the propagation of light through highly scattering amplifying media and the vast number of applications that the phenomenon of random lasing brings into play. After the introductory part the processes governing the interaction of light and matter are described theoretically and focused in the cases that are studied experimentally as well. Diffusive transport of light and lasing theory are the two key aspects in random amplifying media. The coherent properties of the light emitted from random lasers are also investigated. At the same time an overview of the current state of theory describing such media is presented to give a complete picture to the reader. For the time-resolved study of light propagation through turbid matter such as female breast tissue a mode-locked Ti:Sapphire laser emitting 200 fs pulses at 800 nm with an average power of ~ 1 W and a repetition rate of 82 MHz was used. The detection was performed with a streak camera with a temporal resolution of 2 ps. The tissue samples were excised from female breast during tumor extraction or biopsy operations and concerned normal adipose and fibrous tissue. The theoretical analysis of the temporal spread of the transmitted ultra-fast laser pulses provides the optical properties of the studied medium. Large samples can be studied based on the diffusion theory whereas small biopsy samples are studied based on the Laguerre expansion of the kernels technique. Recently cancer tissue was studied as well. Results are in complete agreement with the histological analysis and thus very promising for the implementation of these techniques in optical biopsy. As far as the scattering gain media is concerned different types of laser systems were used depending on the excitation scheme combined with the same workstation employing a spectrograph - streak camera system for the simultaneous detection of both spectral and temporal information. The temporal resolution is 2 ps and the spectral resolution 1 nm. For one-photon excitation of random lasing materials a Lambda Physik distributed feedback dye laser (DFDL) emitting 500 fs pulses at 496 nm with output energy of 50 J pumped by a XeCl excimer laser emitting at 308 nm was used. For two-photon excitation the regeneratively amplified output of the modelocked Ti:Sapphire laser system emitting 200 fsec pulses at 800 nm with a repetition rate of 1 KHz and an average power of 500 mW was used. The samples were prepared by mixing different lasing dyes with TiO 2 microparticles with average diameter of 400 nm in liquid or solid matrices thus providing multiple scattering and gain. As mentioned above light emanating from such media has the temporal and spectral properties of laser light. Pulses of few picoseconds long and few nanometers wide (down to the detection limits of the system) have been detected when the samples were excited above a well-determined energy threshold. This optical explosion provides a <b>beacon</b> like light <b>source,</b> which could be very valuable for detection modalities. Especially the excitation with two near-infrared photons consequently and most importantly provides the necessary penetration inside the strongly scattering media, as well as negligible photobleaching and phototoxication of tissue due to the low energy of the photons. The non-linearity insures that the effect will be confined only on the focal region, thus improving the spatial resolution by minimizing the out of focus fluorescence. The coherent properties of the laser-like emission were studied using the frequency doubled output of the above described laser system employing the regeneratively amplified output of the mode-locked Ti:Sapphire laser emitting at 800 nm. Single photon counting measurements were performed in order to obtain the photon count distributions of the emitted light. Coherent light is described by Poisson distribution whereas chaotic light by Bose-Einstein distribution. The experimental results suggested that depending on the scattering properties of the medium and on the excitation scheme, the emitted light comprised of different amounts of coherent and incoherent components since different modes are overlapping. Similar studies are underway when various fluorophores are embedded in biological tissues. The final goal is {{to take advantage of this}} effect towards a more spatially and spectrally confined agent in Photodynamic Therapy of target tissue lesions on skin or other types of superficial lesions. Very promising in the field of skin PDT would be thin patches with various fluophores, which could be applied directly on the lesion and allow the selection of different irradiation wavelengths using the same laser as excitation source. Some of the applications in addition to PDT are photonic marking for identification purposes (photonic codes, search and rescue missions, military applications, marking of hazardous material), substitution of ordinary lasing media in dye lasers and boosting the emission of LEDs and diode lasers in the blue region of the spectrum (if used with electro luminescent polymers). A lot of effort is also put in the study of dye infiltrated opal photonic crystals and the light emitted from such an ordered (crystal structure) and disordered (random photons path) structure. Στη διατριβή αυτή παρουσιάζονται χρονικά αναλυόμενες μελέτες της διάδοσης του φωτός μέσα από ισχυρά σκεδαστικά υλικά. Δύο είναι οι περιπτώσεις οι οποίες μελετώνται. Στην πρώτη η κυρίαρχη διαδικασία είναι η σκέδαση, με αμελητέα απορρόφηση, ενώ η δεύτερη αφορά σε υλικά τα οποία ταυτόχρονα σκεδάζουν και ενισχύουν το φως. Η διάδοση του φωτός και στις δύο περιπτώσεις χαρακτηρίζεται από τη θεωρία διάχυσης. Παρόλα αυτά κάποια πολύ ενδιαφέροντα φαινόμενα συμβαίνουν στη δεύτερη. Το φως που εκπέμπεται από ένα ισχυρά σκεδαστικό μέσο μπορέι να έχει ιδιότητες που χαρακτηρίζουν το φως λέιζερ. Το φαινόμενο αυτό το οποίο ονομάζεται random laser έχει προκαλέσει μεγάλο ενδιαφέρον στην επιστημονική κοινότητα. Ο τελικός σκοπός της έρευνας είναι η μελέτη της πιθανής χρήσης της διάδοσης και της εκπομπής φωτός από τέτοια υλικά για τη βελτίωση των τεχνικών οπτικής βιοψίας και απεικόνισης...|$|R
