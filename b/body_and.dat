5|$|According to the Board, Grissom {{suffered}} severe third degree {{burns on}} over one-third of his <b>body</b> <b>and</b> his spacesuit was mostly destroyed. White suffered third degree burns on {{almost half of}} his <b>body</b> <b>and</b> a quarter of his spacesuit had melted away. Chaffee suffered third degree burns over {{almost a quarter of}} his <b>body</b> <b>and</b> a small portion of his spacesuit was damaged. The autopsy report confirmed that the primary cause of death for all three astronauts was cardiac arrest caused by high concentrations of carbon monoxide. Burns suffered by the crew were not believed to be major factors, and it was concluded that most of them had occurred postmortem. Asphyxiation happened after the fire melted the astronauts' suits and oxygen tubes, exposing them to the lethal atmosphere of the cabin.|$|E

40|$|This essay {{argues that}} the king’s body politic in Richard II depends {{not only on the}} king’s {{physical}} body but also on the many human <b>bodies</b> <b>and</b> material possessions that comprise the kingdom. Richard II presents the legal fictions of sovereignty and state and the illocutionary force of speech acts as ultimately resting on material <b>bodies</b> <b>and</b> objects. These <b>bodies</b> <b>and</b> objects tend to fall to the ground and fail to meet their owners’ intended purposes. While in the fiction of the play <b>bodies</b> <b>and</b> objects are mostly ineffectual, from a dramaturgical perspective it is precisely because <b>bodies</b> <b>and</b> objects do not align with their owners’ intentions that they appear to draw level with them as agents of dramatic action. People thus become like props in the play, and props become like people. Power is shown to be diffused away from the figure of the king towards the <b>bodies</b> <b>and</b> objects around him and the king himself is revealed {{to be a kind of}} prop...|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} {{examined}} the links between dispositional mindfulness, <b>body</b> comparison, <b>and</b> <b>body</b> satisfaction. It was expected that mindfulness {{would be associated with}} less <b>body</b> comparison <b>and</b> more <b>body</b> satisfaction. Two models were tested: one exploring body comparison as a mediator between mindfulness <b>and</b> <b>body</b> satisfaction <b>and</b> an alternative model exploring mindfulness as a mediator between <b>body</b> comparison <b>and</b> <b>body</b> satisfaction. In an online survey, 1287 Dutch women answered questions concerning dispositional mindfulness, <b>body</b> comparison, <b>and</b> <b>body</b> satisfaction. Results showed that body comparison was related negatively to both dispositional mindfulness <b>and</b> <b>body</b> satisfaction, whereas the two latter variables were related positively. Body comparison partially mediated the relation between mindfulness <b>and</b> <b>body</b> satisfaction. However, a stronger indirect effect was noted in the alternative model, where mindfulness partially mediated the link between <b>body</b> comparison <b>and</b> <b>body</b> satisfaction.

The nonvolatile components in the form of fruit <b>bodies</b> <b>and</b> mycelia were Studied. Both fruit <b>bodies</b> <b>and</b> mycelia were high in contents of carbohydrate, crude fiber and crude protein. Content of total sugars and polyols were 260. 64 and 189. 82 mg/g for fruit <b>bodies</b> <b>and</b> mycelia, respectively. Mannitol content was the highest in both fruit <b>bodies</b> <b>and</b> mycelia (117. 66 and 112. 55 mg/g, respectively). Contents of total free amino acids in Fruit <b>bodies</b> <b>and</b> mycelia were 48. 15 and 67. 63 mg/g, respectively. The content of monosodium glutamate (MSG) -like components in fruit bodies (10. 60 mg/g) was higher than that in mycelia (2. 70 mg/g). The contents of total and flavor 5 '-nucleotides were high in mycelia (26. 27 and 9. 34 mg/g, respectively). Equivalent umami concentrations of fruit <b>bodies</b> <b>and</b> mycelia were similar, and equivalent to the umami intensity given by 6. 08 and 6. 22 g of MSG, respectively. Overall, both fruit <b>bodies</b> <b>and</b> mycelia of northern Cordyceps possessed highly intense umami taste. (c) 2005 Swiss Society of Food Science and Technology. Published by Elsevier Ltd.
