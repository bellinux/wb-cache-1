5|$|General Lee {{responded to}} the British landing with several actions. He began {{reinforcing}} positions on the mainland in case the British were intending to launch an attack directly on Charleston. He also attempted to <b>build</b> <b>a</b> <b>bridge</b> of boats to provide an avenue of retreat for the fort's garrison, but this failed because there were not enough boats to bridge the roughly one mile (1.6km) channel separating the island from Charleston; the unwillingness of Moultrie and Rutledge to support the effort may also have played a role. The Americans also constructed an entrenchment at {{the northern end of}} Sullivan's Island, which was manned by more than 750 men and three small cannons, and began to fortify a guard post at Haddrell's Point on the mainland opposite Fort Sullivan.|$|E
