The Barkley Canyon {{instruments}} span a diversity of habitats, each of which is associated with its own specialized <b>biological</b> <b>community.</b> Most of the areas within Barkley Canon are characterised by a soft, finely sedimented seafloor. Video observations suggest that animal densities are higher at the shallower sites compared with the deeper sites, although most species are present at all sites. A number of fish including sablefish, thornyheads, rockfish, flatfish, sharks, skates, hagfish and eelpouts have been observed throughout Barkley Canyon. The area is rich with invertebrates as well including molluscs (bivalves, octopus, snails), echinoderms (sea stars, brittle stars, sea cucumbers, and urchins) as well as arthropods (crabs and shrimp). Cnidarians are seen both on the seafloor (anemones, sea pens, and corals) as well as floating in the water column (jellyfish) along with other organisms such as salps, ctenophores, and tunicates.|$|E

[...] As the elevation increases from sea level to the mountains, differences in temperature and precipitation caused by elevation create an array of distinct ecosystems stacked on top of each other, each one housing a unique <b>biological</b> <b>community.</b> A doctoral candidate with the Amherst Climate System Research Center noted, “if carbon dioxide levels double, this region will not only experience an increase in temperature of more than five degrees F, but all future temperatures will likely be higher than the complete range of present-day temperatures. In addition, the model simulation indicates that high elevation Pacific slopes and the Caribbean lowlands will receive up to 30% less precipitation. Simulations also indicate an overall increase in the height of the cloud base of up to 300 meters.|$|E

40|$|<b>Biological</b> <b>communities</b> {{in streams}} {{can serve as}} useful {{monitors}} of habitat and chemical conditions. Recently, the use of biomonitoring to examine water resource quality has become a popular alternative, or addition to standard water assessment protocols {{for the purposes of}} management and planning, problem prioritization, and documentation of recovery following remediation efforts. A general theoretical framework for the development of biosurveys has been discussed by Karr (1991). The advantages of using biosurveys for monitoring and assessment purposes include: 1) <b>biological</b> <b>communities</b> reflect overall ecological integrity and therefore may be the most accurate status of a waterbody, 2) <b>biological</b> <b>communities</b> integrate the effects of different pollutant stressors and thus provide a measure of aggregate impact, 3) <b>biological</b> <b>communities</b> integrate stresses over time and provide an ecological measure of fluctuating environmental conditions 4) routine biological monitoring can be relatively inexpensive compared to the costs of detailed chemical and toxicity testing, 5) <b>biological</b> <b>communities</b> are often of direct interest to the public as an indicator of a pollution free environment. Macroinvertebrate communities in streams are effective biomonitors in streams that are relatively stable in time and reflect subtle differences in environmental conditions (Richards and Minshall 1992). Furthermore, general guidelines towards development and use of these communities for biomonitoring have been published widely (Plafkin et al. 1989, OHIO EPA 1987). These approaches follow the suggestions of Karr (1991) in that they utilize multiple community metrics to evaluate instream biological impairment. This approach consists of analyzing different components of the structure and function of macroinvertebrate communities. Each metric contributes ecological information on the integrity of the community in question. Several studies have reported the use of the metric approach with macroinvertebrates in streams (Barbour et al. 1992). Since many aspects of <b>biological</b> <b>communities</b> are dependant on regional and local characteristics, it is necessary to interpret biomonitoring data in light of unique regional characteristics. The {{purpose of the present study}} was to examine macroinvertebrate communities at several locations along Miller Creek to determine if biomonitoring techniques indicate significant problems along the watercourse, to compare various techniques for assessment, and to provide a preliminary database for future comparison...|$|R

High relief, mainly isolated, small carbonate platforms surrounded by steep slopes, typical of the early Carnian, were replaced by low relief carbonate platforms featuring low-angle slopes (i.e. ramps). This turnover is related to a major change in the <b>biological</b> <b>community</b> responsible for calcium carbonate precipitation (i.e. carbonate factory). The highly productive, mainly bacterial dominated <b>biological</b> <b>community</b> (M-factory) which action led to the carbonate production on high relief platforms was substituted by a less productive mollusc-metazoan dominated community (C-T factories).In the South China block the demise of carbonate platforms is coupled with the deposition of sediments typical of anoxic environments (black shales). These anoxic levels are often fossil Lagerstätten, very rich in crinoids and reptiles (e.g. Ichthyosaurs).|$|E

40|$|AbstractLand use type, {{physical}} and chemical stressors, and organic microcontaminants were investigated for their effects on the <b>biological</b> <b>communities</b> (biofilms and invertebrates) in several Mediterranean rivers. The diversity of invertebrates, and the scores of the first principal component of a PCA performed with the diatom communities were the best descriptors of the distribution patterns of the <b>biological</b> <b>communities</b> against the river stressors. These two metrics decreased according to the progressive site impairment (associated to higher area of agricultural and urban-industrial, high water conductivity, higher dissolved organic carbon and dissolved inorganic nitrogen concentrations, and higher concentration of organic microcontaminants, particularly pharmaceutical and industrial compounds). The variance partition analyses (RDAs) attributed the major share (10 %) of the biological communities' response to the environmental stressors (nutrients, altered discharge, dissolved organic matter), followed by the land use occupation (6 %) and of the organic microcontaminants (2 %). However, the variance shared by the three groups of descriptors was very high (41 %), indicating that their simultaneous occurrence determined most {{of the variation in}} the <b>biological</b> <b>communities...</b>|$|R

40|$|Biological {{functions}} {{are carried out}} by groups of interacting molecules, cells or tissues, known as communities. Membership in these communities may overlap when biological components are involved in multiple functions. However, traditional clustering methods detect non-overlapping communities. These detected communities may also be unstable and difficult to replicate, because traditional methods are sensitive to noise and parameter settings. These aspects of traditional clustering methods limit our ability to detect <b>biological</b> <b>communities,</b> and therefore our ability to understand biological functions. To address these limitations and detect robust overlapping <b>biological</b> <b>communities,</b> we propose an unorthodox clustering method called SpeakEasy which identifies communities using top-down and bottom-up approaches simultaneously. Specifically, nodes join communities based on their local connections, as well as global information about the network structure.
