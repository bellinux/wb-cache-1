25|$|Additionally, {{widespread}} use of the Internet by businesses and corporations drives down energy costs. Besides the fact that Internet usage does not consume large amounts of energy, businesses who utilize connections {{no longer have to}} ship, stock, heat, cool, and light unsellable items whose lack of consumption not only yields less profit for the company but also wastes more energy. Online shopping contributes to less fuel use: a 10-pound package via airmail uses 40% less fuel than a trip to <b>buy</b> <b>that</b> same package at a local mall, or shipping via railroad. Researchers in 2000 predicted a continuing decline in energy due to Internet consumption to save 2.7 million tons of paper per year, yielding a decrease by 10 million tons of carbon dioxide globalwarming pollution per year.|$|E

500|$|Despite {{some heavy}} {{promotion}} the black comedy approach {{was not what}} audiences wanted to see, especially with Paul Lynde. As a result, the ratings for the series fell well below the levels of the previous season. The last of The New Temperatures Rising Shows thirteen episodes aired on January 8, 1974. The following Tuesday, January 15, ABC premiered Happy Days in its place. According to co-producer Mitchell, [...] "...the audience didn't <b>buy</b> <b>that</b> at all. They just didn't get it.

500|$|Skelton began {{producing}} artwork in 1943, {{but kept}} his works private for many years. He {{said he was}} inspired to try his hand at painting after visiting a large Chicago department store that had various paintings on display. Inquiring as {{to the price of}} one which Skelton described as [...] "a bunch of blotches", he was told, [...] "Ten thousand wouldn't <b>buy</b> <b>that</b> one." [...] He told the clerk {{he was one of the}} ten thousand who would not buy the painting, instead buying his own art materials. His wife Georgia, a former art student, persuaded him to have his first public showing of his work in 1964 at the Sands Hotel in Las Vegas where he was performing at the time. Skelton believed painting was an asset to his comedy work, as it helped him to better visualize the imaginary props used in his pantomime routines.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} much acclaim from television journalists. The storyline involving Joan's prostituting herself {{to secure the}} Jaguar account for Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce came in for particular analysis and scrutiny among journalists, as related to its execution and use of themes of female sexuality and sexual objectification. Alan Sepinwall fought with himself over {{the execution of the}} prostitution story in this episode, asking, [...] "If you <b>buy</b> <b>that</b> the partners would be willing to sell Joan, and that Joan would feel the same way, then this is an all-time great episode of the series. But if you don't, then it's Weiner and company making the characters act against their natures to fit the theme." [...] Sepinwall described the story as [...] "something that so fundamentally changes the way you view a number of major characters, and the show that uses them, {{that it has to be}} just about perfect to work, and maybe not even then." [...] Todd VanDerWerff opined that,"'The Other Woman' shouldn’t work. It’s so obviously constructed to be a 'message' episode, and the message is far from subtle: No matter what we try to do to make them equal, men are always going to turn women into objects on some level, because that’s just how men perceive them." [...] VanDerWerff compared it to the [...] "Employee of the Month" [...] episode of The Sopranos, even going so far as to call [...] "The Other Woman" [...] a stronger episode.|$|E
500|$|Eric Goldman of IGN {{scored the}} episode an 8.3 out of 10, praising the visual style, {{which he called}} [...] "less glossy" [...] than {{previous}} episodes, {{as well as the}} introduction of new characters and development of old ones, especially the introduction of Carl Creel and the [...] "nicely done FX showing off his power". He did note that the episode [...] "did little to actually give Hunter or Mack [...] " [...] and stated [...] "I don’t really <b>buy</b> <b>that</b> Fitz would even be there, working alongside the team, at this point. Doesn't he have friends or family he could be with?" [...] Marc Buston for Den of Geek scored the episode 4.5 stars out of 5, feeling that the series had finally reached its potential by incorporating Marvel elements such as Creel and Whitehall, while also creating a darker tone and developing the original characters. He specifically highlighted the changes made to Fitz's character, saying [...] "This lair of tragedy greatly deepens Fitz’s character and gives the comic relief of last season a heartbreaking edge." [...] James Hunt, also for Den of Geek, gave a positive review as well, stating [...] "The momentum of last season's finale hasn't been lost, and indeed, it's even been added to. Last year I criticised the pilot episode for, above all else, failing to recreate the feel of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. This year, it's only fair that I praise the season opener for doing exactly that." [...] He did feel, however, that the opening sequence featuring Carter was [...] "by some distance, the most exciting part of the episode". Kevin Fitzpatrick at Screen Crush called the premiere [...] "unexpectedly good", noting that the series [...] "remains as serialized a show as it can over 22 episodes", introducing interesting ideas {{for the rest of the}} season, while also setting a high standard for subsequent episodes to meet. He concluded that the series [...] "definitely seems to have hit a major groove".|$|E

500|$|Meanwhile, Heffron, who {{supported}} a general policy of decentralising tertiary education across the state, directed his Department {{to begin the}} establishment of various Teachers' Colleges in New South Wales, to provide sufficient tertiary training to the expanding numbers of teachers filling the new schools and colleges across the state. Among them was the Newcastle Teachers' College, established in 1949 and opened in 1950, which facilitated growing calls {{from the city of}} Newcastle for a more permanent University in the city. In May 1951, Heffron indicated his support {{for the establishment of a}} satellite college of Sydney University in Newcastle as an initial step towards the establishment of a full university. By July Heffron sought to approach Sydney University officials to facilitate efforts [...] "to have a university established in Newcastle as soon as possible", and noted that his moves to purchase land in the city as the site of this college was an indication of the government's intentions: [...] "I didn't <b>buy</b> <b>that</b> site in Newcastle just for fun. I want to provide a university in Newcastle and I want that to be only the first step in providing universities all over the state". However, by the time Heffron opened the Newcastle University College (NUC) on 3 December 1951, no affiliation had been finalised. By May 1952, a University Establishment Group had gained much momentum but Heffron had been notified by Premier Joseph Cahill that there were insufficient funds available for the establishment of another full university. Nevertheless, in early 1954 this college had become a college of the New South Wales University of Technology. As premier, in late 1961 Heffron moved with his Minister for Education, Ernest Wetherell, that the Newcastle University College would become a full university [...] "come what may". This was achieved when on 12 March 1962, the University of Technology Vice-Chancellor Philip Baxter notified the NUC Warden, Professor James Auchmuty, that it would be allowed to take on full autonomy to become the University of Newcastle from 1 January 1965.|$|E

They didn't care that Andrew was creating a sequel to the original story." [...] However, Love Never Dies is not a sequel to Gaston Leroux's original novel, in which the character of the Phantom dies at the end. Phillips additionally addressed the audience's suspension of disbelief with regard to the plot of Love Never Dies: [...] "The central plot idea is that the Phantom and Christine have slept together.
