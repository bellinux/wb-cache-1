25|$|Harrison Stickle's summit area is {{composed}} of the pebbly sandstone and breccia of the Pavey Ark Member. Several greenstone knapping sites have been found below the main peak, and following the strike of the tuff exploited at nearby Pike O'Stickle in the neolithic period. The sites on Pike O'Stickle have been well described as the Langdale axe industry, {{but they have been}} found to be much more widespread than originally thought. The rock was roughly shaped on site, and then traded across the country, where the final polishing could be undertaken. Such polished axes have been found in Buckinghamshire for example as well as in East Anglia. The axes varied widely in size, shape and function, and most were designed to be fitted with either wooden or bone handles (using pointed <b>butt</b> <b>ends</b> or narrow waists).|$|E
2500|$|The Royalist centre {{attacked}} first, with Rupert {{keeping his}} own wing of cavalry in hand {{so that the}} horse and foot could hit the enemy simultaneously. Skippon's infantry moved forward over {{the crest of the}} ridge to meet the Royalist foot. There was time for only one volley of musketry before both sides were fighting hand-to-hand, the veteran Royalist infantry using their swords and the <b>butt</b> <b>ends</b> of their muskets. Sir Edward Walker, Charles's secretary of war, stated [...] "The Foot on either side hardly saw each other until they were within Carabine Shot, and so made only one Volley; our falling in with Sword and butt end of the Musquet did notable Execution, so much as I saw their Colours fall and their Foot in great Disorder." [...] Skippon was wounded by a bullet which splintered his armour and struck him under the ribs, although he stayed on the field to prevent panic spreading. Even so, the Parliamentarians were hard-pressed and forced back.|$|E
2500|$|The exact {{meanings}} of both numbers and letters differ from manufacturer to manufacturer, and some sticks are not described using this system at all, just being known as Jazz (typically a 7N or 8N) or Heavy Rock (typically a 4B or 5B) for example. The most common general-purpose stick is a 5A (wood tip, for snare tone) or 5N (nylon tip, for cymbal tone) or 7a for a smooth and easy tone [...] Materials, other than wood (hickory, maple, oak, persimmon), used for producing sticks include aluminum (used primarily for marching band applications), acrylic (primarily for visual appeal) and graphite (most often used by [...] "heavy hitters", playing hard rock and metal, etc.). Other sticks commonly used are rutes, {{consisting of a}} bundle of canes, and wire or nylon drum brushes. More rarely, other beaters such as cartwheel mallets (known to kit drummers as [...] "soft sticks") may be used. It {{is not uncommon for}} rock drummers to use the [...] "wrong" [...] (butt) end of a stick for a heavier sound; some makers in the 2010s produce tipless sticks with two <b>butt</b> <b>ends.</b>|$|E
40|$|One of {{the main}} tasks in {{developing}} a technical process to manufacture castings is to organize risering at the stage of solidification, which ensures the set level on shrinkable porosity and shrinkage cavities. As known, generally, the risering zone consists of a feeder zone and a feeding <b>butt</b> <b>end</b> zone. In references the terms of final (end) effect action or an effective area of the casting edge is possible to encounter rather than the term of feeding <b>butt</b> <b>end</b> zone. The values of feeding <b>butt</b> <b>end</b> zone are used to calculate a directional solidification in the casting mould. The design procedure of a directional solidification of castings is follows. The first design section is advised to settle down at the distance equal to the zone of feeding <b>butt</b> <b>end.</b> The subsequent design sections are advisable to settle down at distances a little bit less, than the zone of feeding <b>butt</b> <b>end.</b> The padding (lap) value ought to be selected to provide the later solidification of the upper sections of casting {{with respect to the}} sections lying below. A series of special experiments on castings of the simple configuration (slabs and bars) defines a value of the feeding zone of a <b>butt</b> <b>end</b> and makes it out as the regressional dependences of the feeding <b>butt</b> <b>end</b> zone on the characteristic sizes of this or that casting. Thus, considerable material and time expenditures are demanded to define the value of the feeding <b>butt</b> <b>end</b> zone to be used further, including calculation of directional solidification of castings. The paper offers a design procedure to calculate a zone of the feeding <b>butt</b> <b>end</b> via computing simulation of solidification in a casting mould thereby sharply reducing expenditures for searching the desirable values. To reveal spaces in the casting, staggered with shrinkable porosity, the new criteria of porosity developed in BMSTU are used. The paper shows a possibility to use the effective size as a characteristic parameter of casting for dependence of the feeding <b>butt</b> <b>end</b> zone thus providing this dependence universality and a possibility to use it for making any shaped casting, but not just the castings of a simple configuration. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{methods of}} the {{electrical}} parameter identification of the <b>butt</b> <b>end</b> bus connections of graphitization furnace current feeders with side bus packets basing on the conjugate three-dimensional mathematical models of electromagnetic and electro-thermal processes are presented. The finite element methods of solving partial derivatives vector equations systems in three-dimensional domain are used. The temperature dependences of the electro-physical properties and thermo-physical properties of the active materials and the external bus surface conditions of natural convection and radiation heat transfer are taken into account. The high accuracy and computational efficiency numerical calculations by using variations of the finite elements densities in the computational domain are produced. The finite elements densities in the domains of the magnetic field concentration are increased. The basic and new designs of <b>butt</b> <b>end</b> bus systems of AC graphitization furnace are considered. The calculations of geometric parameters of the bus conductors by using the equality criterion of active loss densities are presented. The currents, voltage drops, current density, electrical losses densities, active and inductive resistance of bus of side bus packages, <b>butt</b> <b>end</b> bus connections and graphite feeders are identified. The energy efficiency of <b>butt</b> <b>end</b> graphitization furnace electrical connections of different numbers of parallel buses is analyzed. The technical decisions to reduce weight, active and reactive power losses of bus <b>butt</b> <b>end</b> connections are substantiated...|$|R

60|$|We {{reached the}} Penobscot about four o'clock, and found there some St. Francis Indians encamped on the bank. They {{were making a}} canoe and drying moose meat. Their camp was covered with spruce bark. They had a young moose, taken in the river a {{fortnight}} before, confined {{in a sort of}} cage of logs piled up cob-fashion, seven or eight feet high. It was quite tame, about four feet high, and covered with moose flies. There was a large quantity of cornel, red maple, and also willow and aspen boughs, stuck through between the logs on all sides, <b>butt</b> <b>ends</b> out, and on their leaves it was browsing. It looked at first as if it were in a bower rather than a pen.|$|E
60|$|Quietly and steadily, the men kept {{up their}} fire. This time the enemy reached the door, and Lisle was {{compelled}} to call down the two men from above. The Afridis gathered thickly round the door, tried to push it in with their heavy knives, and battered it with the <b>butt</b> <b>ends</b> of their rifles. Gradually, {{in spite of the}} fire of the defenders, they splintered it; but the barricade behind still held and, from this, the besieged poured through the broken door so galling a fire--one half emptying their magazines, and then falling back to reload while the others took their places--till at last, after suffering a loss of some thirty men, the enemy retired again, and were soon hidden in the darkness. As soon as they had gone, the garrison brought down all available material from the upper floor to strengthen the barricade.|$|E

Having thus formed their little army, they marched out from among the trees, and came up to the teeth of the enemy, shouting and hallooing as loud as they could. The savages stood all together, but were in the utmost confusion, hearing the noise of our men shouting from three quarters together; they would have fought if they had seen us; and as soon as we came near enough to be seen, some arrows were shot, and poor old Friday was wounded, though not dangerously. But our men gave them no time, but running up to them, fired among them three ways, and then fell in with the <b>butt</b> <b>ends</b> of their muskets, their swords, armed staves, and hatchets; and laid about them so well, that in a word they set up a dismal screaming and howling, flying to save their lives which way soever they could.|$|E

The pirates soon found they had the worst of it, and would have got apart from us if they could; but we jumped into thar boat and fought them thar, and they soon jumped over and made for the bank. Directly it was over they began to fire agin from the shore, and we jumped back into shelter agin in our own boat and manned the four oars agin. We {{fastened}} the painter of the boat on to our stern, and towed her behind us, and in another half an hour {{were out in the}} stream. It was a toughish fight, I can tell you, while it lasted; two of the blacks and one of my mates had been hit by thar musket-balls, {{and the rest of us}} war either gashed by thar knives or had got ugly cracks. However, six of them war lying in the boat when we hauled it alongside; two war stone-dead, the other four had been stunned with the <b>butt</b> <b>ends</b> of the muskets, or cut down by the darkies' sabres.

The center-cut can yield the traditional filet mignon or tenderloin steak, as well as the Chateaubriand steak and beef Wellington.
