Augustus Selby was the first owner and manager of the new Liberty Mill, which opened in 1918. Electricity was brought into Liberty Mill and also served the homes and businesses nearby, making Germantown the first area in the northern portion of Montgomery County to receive electricity.|$|E

He spent 5,000 pounds sterling on a shipyard, a sawmill and stores and other buildings and was soon <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>business.</b> In the period 1783 to 1785 he lost several more vessels and their cargoes to the North Atlantic. But some got through and he signed a contract with Wm. Forsyth and Co. of Greenock, Scotland and Halifax, Nova Scotia to provide masts and yards. He also shipped fish to the West Indies and Europe.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, World War II brought {{thousands}} of servicemen and war workers to New Orleans {{as well as}} to the surrounding region's military bases and shipyards. Many of these sojourners paid visits to the Vieux Carré. Although nightlife and vice had already begun to coalesce on Bourbon Street in the two decades following the closure of Storyville, the war produced a larger, more permanent presence of exotic, risqué, and often raucous entertainment on what became the city's most famous strip. Years of repeated crackdowns on vice in Bourbon Street clubs, which took on new urgency under Mayor deLesseps Story Morrison, reached a crescendo with District Attorney Jim Garrison's raids in 1962, but Bourbon Street's clubs were soon <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>business.</b>|$|E

25|$|Against ARVN opponents, PAVN {{had greater}} success. In the ARVN Lam Son {{operation}} into Laos, ARVN troops were inserted by helicopter, covered by US airmobile, road advance operations and massive aerial firepower. The operation met heavy resistance, including intense antiaircraft fire. ARVN air insertions {{took them to}} the outskirts of Tchepone, but numerous helicopters were shot down or damaged. PAVN flanking tactics and ambushes also mauled the ARVN infantry battalions. US/ARVN reports claimed some 13,000 PAVN deaths and destruction of tons of material, but the ARVN was forced to withdraw, a maneuver that turned into a humiliating rout, salvaged only by unrelenting American airpower. Some 105 US helicopters were lost and an additional 615 damaged. The communist base area at Tchepone was <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>business</b> within a week. The vital role of sanctuary areas which could be developed in depth into strong bases was again illustrated.|$|E

500|$|In {{an effort}} to stop {{the success of the}} former company salesman, Ellwood and Washburn-Moen filed for an {{injunction}} to stop the business of Southern Wire Company. The suit, filed in U. S. District Court, claimed the machines Gates and Clifford used in the production of their product were a direct copy of those used by Washburn-Moen. [...] The suit also called for Gates and Clifford to pay US$100,000 in damages to the company. As they avoided process servers, Gates and Clifford made a plan to save their company. [...] They were able to rent a building in East St. Louis, Illinois and moved their equipment out of the factory and onto a ferryboat after dark. [...] After they crossed the Mississippi River, the machines were out of the jurisdiction of the St. Louis U. S. District Court and were <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>business</b> the next day. When Clifford and Gates hired an attorney to answer the charges made against them in court, the judge ruled that the manufacturing process used by Southern Wire Company was not an infringement on any patents or machinery owned by Ellwood and Washburn-Moen.|$|E

500|$|Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly {{said that}} Madonna {{delivered}} a [...] "joyous, unironic, openhearted" [...] show {{rather than a}} cautious performance. According to Tucker, the singer was in [...] "full command"; although the visuals lacked flow, the song transitions meshed [...] "perfectly". Neil McCormick of The Daily Telegraph called the show a [...] "tribute to Madonna" [...] and a [...] "shameless" [...] promotion of the singer's return to the music scene after directing W.E.: [...] "The message [...] {{is that she is}} <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>business.</b> I suspect she’d settle for a global number one over global harmony". Troy Patterson of Slate wrote that Madonna retained her [...] "greatest marketing agent" [...] title with the show and praised its costumes, sets and the singer's repeated self-referencing. Linda Holmes of NPR said, [...] "What's curious, given how much 'ewww, she's too old' stuff went around on Twitter, is that everything she did Sunday night is exactly what it should mean to age gracefully". Miriam Coleman of Rolling Stone called the show a [...] "serious spectacle", and Mario Tarradell of The Dallas Morning News called it a [...] "high-concept music video": [...] "Madonna brilliantly manipulates the combined impact of visuals and sonics. The 13-minute performance was an eye-popping marvel". A Huffington Post reviewer wrote, [...] "Love her or hate her, there's no doubt that only Madonna can bring a certain level of pop flair to a performance". Spencer Kornhaber of The Atlantic praised the show's choreography and cinematography: [...] "With so, so much to look at, Madonna remained the center of attention. That is, until the end, when white light and smoke engulfed her and she dropped down through the stage, out of sight". According to Joey Guerra of the Houston Chronicle, Madonna controlled her nerves and he liked her selection of songs.|$|E
