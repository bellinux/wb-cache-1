40|$|In this study, link {{mechanisms}} are modeled using finite elements {{based upon the}} Shifted Integration technique. A single link structure of a pin joint and a rigid bar is expressed by two linear Timoshenko beam elements with their numerical integration points shifted to {{opposite ends of the}} link joint. The finite-element approach in control schemes may provide flexibility against sudden change in a hardware system, since the remodeling can be achieved easily by rewriting input data. This paper describes an application of the modeling to normal pin joint-rigid <b>bar</b> <b>link</b> mechanisms. A numerical scheme for obtaining joint torque curves in n-link mechanisms based upon Cartesian coordinates is derived, and a numerical test on an 8 -link mechanism by the Finite Element Method is carried out. The obtained joint torque curves as well as the CPU time are compared to those obtained by the conventional Newton-Euler method...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, a four bar {{mechanism}} {{was designed}} for the specified performance output for a tractor. In tractor’s plowing is engaged {{with the assistance of}} a hydraulic cylinder. Looking on the soil hardness the plowing depth fluctuates that isn't fascinating. To induce the correct plowing depth an Electrical control system is introduced. It consists of hydraulic valve, control unit and also the angular sensor. The control system helps to regulate the plowing depth accurately. The device measures the position of pivot and offers feed back to the system. Thus a sturdy, reliable and safe link mechanism is developed to measure the angular motion of the pivot. The main focus {{of this paper is to}} analyze Dimensional synthesis is performed supported Freudenstein’s Equation and Chebechev’s formula in Matlab and calculate the structural error of linkage mechanism by using Adams. Dimensional synthesis of 4 <b>bar</b> <b>link</b> mechanisms helps the designer to design link mechanisms with correct dimensions and simulation in Adams helps to optimize the link mechanism...|$|E

40|$|AbstractSolar {{energy is}} the most abundant, widely {{distributed}} and clean renewable energy resource. Since the insolation intensity {{is only in the}} range of 0. 5 - 1. 0 kW/m 2, solar concentrators are required for attaining temperatures appropriate for medium and high temperature applications. The concentrated energy is transferred through an absorber to a thermal fluid such as air, water or other fluids for various uses. This paper describes design and development of a ‘Linear Fresnel Mirror Solar Concentrator’ (LFMSC) using long thin strips of mirrors to focus sunlight on to a fixed receiver located at a common focal line. Our LFMSC system comprises a reflector (concentrator), receiver (target) and an innovative solar tracking mechanism. Reflectors are mirro strips, mounted on tubes which are fixed to a base frame. The tubes can be rotated to align the strips to focus solar radiation on the receiver (target). The latter comprises a coated tube carrying water and covered by a glass plate. This is mounted at an elevation of few meters above the horizontal, parallel to the plane of the mirrors. The reflector is oriented along north-south axis. The most difficult task is tracking. This is achieved by single axis tracking using a four <b>bar</b> <b>link</b> mechanism. Thus tracking has been made simple and easy to operate. The LFMSC setup is used for generating steam for a variety of applications...|$|E

50|$|One of {{the worst}} {{disasters}} caused by stress corrosion cracking was {{the fall of the}} Silver Bridge, WV in 1967, when a single brittle crack formed by rusting grew to criticality. The crack was on one of the tie <b>bar</b> <b>links</b> of one of the suspension chains, and the whole joint failed quickly by overload. The event escalated and the whole bridge disappeared in less than a minute, killing 46 drivers or passengers on the bridge at the time.|$|R
