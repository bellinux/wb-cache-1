40|$|Melt {{compounding}} processing {{approach for}} incorporating cellulose nanocrystals (CNC) into thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) has not well been explored. This is {{primarily due to}} the poor thermal stability and dispersibility of CNCs. As they are typically obtained from sulphuric acid hydrolysis, they give rise to degradation and discolouration of the extruded nanocomposites. The investigation of this research demonstrates sulphuric acid hydrolysis (CNC-S), phosphoric acid hydrolysis (CNC-P) and a novel non-hydrolytic high energy <b>bead</b> <b>milling</b> <b>method</b> (CNC-MC) into a polyether based thermoplastic polyurethane via melt compounding using twin screw extruder. The TPU film incorporated with CNC-S obviously shows the sign of CNC degradation where TPU film was changed to brown colour. The tensile strength of TPU reinforced with CNC-S, CNC-P and CNC-MC shows 18 %, 16 % and 14 % of improvement at CNC loading of 0 to 1 wt. % upon host polymer.

30|$|Si {{nanoparticles}} possess significant properties such as wide-bandgap energies due to {{the quantum}} confinement effect [1, 2], large surface area [3], and high reactivity [4]. Moreover, Si is a safe material, possible {{to apply to the}} bio-medical field [5]. Extensive studies have been performed to produce Si nanoparticles using various methods including laser ablation [6, 7], plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (CVD) [8], hot wire CVD [9], sputtering [10], Si implantation [11], intense pulsed ion beam evaporation [12], and co-evaporation of SiO plus SiO 2 with subsequent heat treatment [13]. These methods require vacuum chambers and are time- and cost-consuming. Si nanoparticles can also be produced by chemical methods such as Zintl reaction and LiAlH reduction of SiCl 4 [14]. For a cheap fabrication method of Si nanoparticles, Lam et al. [15] employed the ball milling method, but {{only a small fraction of}} Si powders becomes nanometer size. We have developed a fabrication method of Si nanoparticles from Si swarf (i.e., industrial waste produced during slicing Si ingots) by use of the <b>beads</b> <b>milling</b> <b>method</b> [16, 17].|$|E
30|$|Figure  2 {{shows the}} PL spectra for Si {{nanoparticles}} fabricated from Si swarf {{by use of}} the <b>beads</b> <b>milling</b> <b>method</b> in hexane. The PL spectra had a peaked structure with peaks at 2.56, 2.73, 2.91, and 3.09  eV. The PL spectra hardly depended on the incident light excitation energy of 3.18 – 3.76  eV (Fig.  2 a). If PL arose from the band-to-band transition of Si nanoparticles, the PL energy would strongly depend on the excitation energy because {{with an increase in}} the excitation energy, wider bandgap Si nanoparticles can be excited, leading to PL emission with higher energy. This is not the case, and the observed PL most probably arises from adsorbed species on Si nanoparticles. The PL spectra of Si nanoparticles were very similar to that of DMA (bottom spectrum in Fig.  2 a) with peaks at 2.55, 2.75, 2.92, and 3.09  eV. The peaked structure with almost the identical energy separation of ~ 0.18  eV is due to the vibronic structure of DMA molecules [26]. We conclude that the observed PL with the vibronic structure resulted from DMA impurity in hexane adsorbed on Si nanoparticles.|$|E
40|$|The initial {{reaction}} of Si nanopowder {{with water to}} generate hydrogen is investigated using FT-IR and XPS measurements. Si nanopowder is fabricated using the simple <b>beads</b> <b>milling</b> <b>method.</b> For HF-etched Si nanopowder, strong peaks due to Si-H and Si-H 2 stretching vibrational modes and a weak shoulder peak due to Si-H 3 are observed. Although no peaks due to oxide is observed in the Si 2 p XPS spectrum, weak vibrational peaks due to HSiO 2 and HSiO 3 species are observable. The hydrogen generation rate greatly increases with pH, indicating that the reacting species is hydroxide ions (OH− ions). After the reaction, the intensities of the peaks due to SiH and SiH 2 species decrease while those for HSiO, HSiO 2, and HSiO 3 species increase. This result demonstrates that OH− ions attack Si back-bonds, with surface Si-H bonds remaining. After {{initial reaction}} of HF-etched Si nanopowder with heavy water, vibrational peaks for SiD, SiDH, and SiDH 2 appear, and then, a peak due to DSiO 3 species is observed, but no peaks due to DSiO 2 and DSiO species are observable. This result indicates that SiD, SiDH, and SiDH 2 species are formed by substitution reactions, followed by oxidation of back-bonds to form DSiO 3 species.

Our study intended to prepare AZL nanocrystals by means of <b>bead</b> <b>milling</b> <b>method.</b> Eight stabilizers or their binary combination and the milling time were set to be variable factors to optimize AZL nanosuspension formulation, and six types of freeze-drying supports were investigated to reduce the aggregation of particles during the solidification. AZL nanocrystals with or without sodium deoxycholate (NaDC) as combined stabilizer with Poloxamer 188 (F 68) were prepared owning mean particle sizes of about 300 [*]nm and 460 [*]nm. During the screening processes, the formulation containing NaDC showed a smaller particle size and better stability during lyophilization. The irregular shape and crystal form changing in AZL nanocrystals were discovered by various characterizations.

40|$|We {{prepared}} {{magnesium hydroxide}} (MH) nanoparticles, and investigated their effect {{when combined with}} dissolved carteolol on the bioavailability and intraocular pressure (IOP) -reducing effect of carteolol. The carteolol was solved in saline containing additives (0. 5 % methylcellulose, 0. 001 % benzalkonium chloride, 0. 5 % mannitol; CRT-solution). MH nanoparticles were prepared by a <b>bead</b> <b>mill</b> <b>method</b> with additives. Then carteolol/MH microparticle and carteolol/MH nanoparticle fixed combinations (mCMFC and nCMFC) were prepared by mixing the CRT-solution and MH particles. The transcorneal penetration and IOP-reducing effect of carteolol was evaluated in rabbits. The mean particle size of mCMFC was 7. 2 μm, and the particle size was reduced to 73. 5 – 113. 5 nm by the <b>bead</b> <b>mill</b> treatment. The MH particles in nCMFC remained in the nano size range for 8 days after preparation, and the amounts of lacrimal fluid and corneal damage were unchanged by repetitive instillation of nCMFC (twice a day for 4 weeks). The transcorneal penetration of carteolol was enhanced by the combination with MH nanoparticles, and the IOP-reducing effect of nCMFC {{was significantly higher than}} that of CRT-solution or mCMFC. In conclusion, we designed nCMFC, and showed that the high levels of dissolved carteolol can be delivered into the aqueous humor by the instillation of nCMFC.

In this study, we investigated changes in the electroretinograms (ERG) of streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats (STZ rats), a model of diabetes mellitus. In addition, we demonstrated that dispersions containing CLZ nanoparticles attenuate changes in the ERG of STZ rats. The instillation of CLZnano {{had no effect on}} body weight or plasma glucose and insulin levels. Furthermore, no corneal toxicity was observed in the in vivo study using STZ rats. The a-wave and b-wave levels in addition to oscillatory potentials (OP) amplitude decreased in STZ rats two weeks after the injection of streptozotocin, with the instillation of CLZnano attenuating these decreases. In addition, the level of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in the retinas of STZ rats was 9. 26 -fold higher than in in normal rats, with this increase also prevented by the instillation of CLZnano Thus, we have found that a-wave and b-wave levels in addition to OP amplitude are decreased in rats following the injection of excessive streptozotocin. Furthermore, the retinal disorders associated with diabetes mellitus are attenuated by the instillation of CLZnano. These findings provide significant information {{that can be used to}} design further studies aimed at developing anti-diabetic retinopathy drugs...|$|R
40|$|Recovery of mRNA from {{environmental}} samples for measurement of in situ metabolic activities is a signif-icant challenge.

Environ. Microbiol. 62 : 316 – 322, 1996) for DNA extraction. One of the key differences is that the samples are ground in a denaturing solution at a temperature below 0 °C to inactivate nuclease activity. Two different methods were evaluated for separating RNA from DNA. Among the methods examined for RNA pu-rification, anion exchange resin gave the best results in terms of RNA integrity, yield, and purity. With the optimized protocol, intact RNA and high-molecular-weight DNA were simultaneously recovered from 19 soil and stream sediment samples of diverse composition. The RNA yield from these samples ranged from 1. 4 to 56 g g of soil 1 dry weight), whereas the DNA yield ranged from 23 to 435 g g 1. In addition, studies with the same soil sample showed that the DNA yield was, on average, 40 % higher than that in our previous pro-cedure and 68 % higher than that in a commercial <b>bead</b> <b>milling</b> <b>method.</b> For {{the majority of the}} samples, the DNA and RNA recovered were of sufficient purity for nuclease digestion, microarray hybridization, and PCR or reverse transcription-PCR amplification.

30|$|The third {{dispersion}} {{method is}} tantamount to breaking particle agglomerations by physical means, for instance mechanical agitation, ultrasonic waves, and stirred <b>bead</b> <b>milling.</b> Those <b>methods</b> are supposed to generate cavitation oscillations {{which can lead to}} shearing, breaking, and dispersing effects [84]. It is universally recognized and proved that the nanofluids will be more stable after proper supersonic vibration and it can be proved once again by the summary of the dispersion stability TiO 2 nanofluids. It can be seen from Table  2 that almost all the preparation processes have involved some physical treatments. Li et al. [85] dispersed TiO 2 nanoparticles into MDEA solution to prepare TiO 2 –MEDA–H 2 O nanofluids. They found that the nanofluids could keep stable for 48  h with mechanical agitation without adding dispersant. Tajik et al. [86] investigated the effects of different ultrasonic types (continuous or discontinues pulses) on the suspending behavior of water-based TiO 2 nanofluids. The results showed that the continuous pulses had better breaking effects than the discontinuous ones, while the latter could not separate some big aggregations. Silambarasan et al. [66] investigated experimentally the effect of stirred <b>bead</b> <b>milling</b> and ultrasonication on the suspending behavior of water-based mixture containing submicron TiO 2 particles. They found that stirred <b>bead</b> <b>milling</b> can produce stable suspensions containing submicron particles, and ultrasonication can be further applied to control the transport behavior of the TiO 2 suspensions. Longo and Zilio [87] compared the effects of mechanical stirring and ultrasonic waves on the dispersion behavior of TiO 2 –water and Al 2 O 3 –water nanofluids. They observed that treatment of sonicating at 25  kHz for 48  h showed better dispersion efficiency than just simple mechanical stirring. After these physical dispersion treatments, the both kinds of nanofluids can keep stable for more than 1  month.|$|R

Pairwise comparisons of the nine extraction procedures revealed that <b>bead</b> <b>mill</b> homogenization with SDS combined with either chloroform or phenol optimized both the amount of DNA extracted and the molecular size of the DNA (maximum size, 16 to 20 kb). Neither lysozyme digestion before SDS treatment nor guanidine isothiocyanate treatment nor addition of Chelex 100 resin improved the DNA yields. <b>Bead</b> <b>mill</b> homogenization in a lysis mixture containing chloroform, SDS, NaCl, and phosphate-Tris buffer (pH 8) {{was found to be}} the best physical lysis technique when DNA yield and cell lysis efficiency were used as criteria.

Of special concern are potential bioterrorism attacks conducted by deliberate aerosolization of hazardous toxins or pathogenic microorganisms. Investigation aiming at understanding the normal {{state of the}} bioaerosol environment is essential to facilitate detection of biological threat agents and deviations from the normal background. This MSc thesis presents a pilot study for investigation of the bioaerosol environment at a subway station in Norway. The {{aim of this study}} was to characterize airborne bacteria and Influenza virus at Nationaltheatret subway station in Oslo. A series of studies were conducted to examine the every-day concentrations and diversity of endospores and vegetative bacteria cells. Results showed that 20 times more cultivable bacteria were found during daytime compared to nighttime. An average of 400 CFUs/m 3 was found in daytime samples, of which 3 % were cultivable endospore-forming bacteria. From the cultured bacteria, 92 different bacterial species were observed by tentative 16 SrRNA gene identification, and 37 different bacterial genera were identified. The diversity was found to be similar during daytime and nighttime, except for decreased representation of the family taxa Bacillaceae during nighttime (6 % compared to 32 % during daytime). 402 cultured bacteria were further characterized based on observed colony morphology, hemolysis activity and antibiotic resistance. Characteristic traits of the ten most represented family taxa were found based on colony morphology. In order to include non-cultivable bacteria for characterization, performance of culture-independent analysis of total bacteria was needed.

The recovery of recombinant protein, cholesterol oxidase (COD) was studied in a continuous <b>bead</b> <b>milling</b> process.

Significant process variables, cell slurry feed rate (A), bead load (B), cell load (C) and run time (D), were investigated and optimized for maximizing COD recovery. RSM predicted an optimum of feed rate of 310. 73 mL/h, bead loading of 79. 9 % (v/v), cell loading OD 600 nm of 74, and run time of 29. 9 min with a recovery of ~ 3. 2 g/L. ANN coupled with GA predicted a maximum COD recovery of ~ 3. 5 g/L at an optimum feed rate (mL/h) : 258. 08, bead loading (%, v/v) : 80 %, cell loading (OD 600 nm) : 73. 99, and run time of 32 min.

Since GA can even optimize discontinuous functions present study cites a perfect example of using machine learning (ANN) in combination with evolutionary optimization (GA) for representing undefined biological functions which is the case for common industrial processes involving biological moieties...|$|R
40|$|An {{increased}} worldwide protein {{demand for}} food and feed and the necessity to release the water soluble proteins {{in the first stage}} of the cascade biorefinery require the development of mild protein extraction technologies. Cell disintegration is the first hurdle and is considered {{as one of the most}} energy consuming steps. Therefore, this thesis focused on the development of a mild, scalable and energy efficient disintegration technology for green microalgae and macroalgae (seaweed) aimed on extraction of water soluble components (like proteins and carbohydrates). For microalgae disintegration, two main technologies were investigated. First of all the conventional technology <b>bead</b> <b>milling</b> and second a novel approach using Pulsed Electric Field (PEF). In Chapter 2 a benchmark was set by means of <b>bead</b> <b>milling</b> for the release of water soluble protein from the green microalgae Chlorella vulgaris. Overall, protein yields between 32 and 42 % were achieved, while the energy consumption was reduced with 85 % by selective protein extraction to values as low as 0. 81 kWh kgDW- 1. Remarkably, the benchmark was much better than expected. In Chapter 3 the <b>bead</b> <b>mill</b> was further optimized by decreasing the applied bead size, furthermore the applicability of <b>bead</b> <b>milling</b> on two additional microalgae species (Neochloris oleoabundans, Tetraselmis suecica) was shown. In addition, to be able to better understand the disintegration mechanism, the so-called stress model was applied. This model describes the comminution process in a <b>bead</b> <b>mill</b> as function of the amount of bead contacts and the force of each impact. The release kinetics could be improved and thereby the specific energy consumption could be reduced to 0. 45 ‒ 0. 47 kWh kgDW- 1 by using 0. 3 mm beads for all algae. Chapter 4 describes a screening on the applicability of PEF, over a broad range of operating conditions, for the extraction of water soluble proteins from the microalgae C. vulgaris and N. oleoabundans. No substantial protein yields were observed under the investigated conditions. This led to the conclusion that PEF is not suitable to release water soluble proteins, not even at specific energy consumptions much higher than those for the benchmark, <b>bead</b> <b>milling.</b> In Chapter 5 it was attempted to improve the performance of PEF by investigating the synergistic effect with the processing temperature. The PEF experiments were performed using a pilot scale continuous flow electroporation unit in which the processing temperature was controlled between 25 – 65 °C. The results showed that under the tested conditions, the combined PEF-Temperature treatment did not cause substantial disintegration of the algal cells to effectively release water soluble proteins. In addition to the microalgae, macroalgae were subject of investigation in the search for new protein sources in Chapter 6. Four batch technologies were used to disintegrate the green macroalgae Ulva lactuca, being; osmotic shock, enzyme incubation, PEF and High Shear Homogenization (HSH). In descending order the highest protein yields per treatment; HSH (~ 40 %) > enzyme degradation (~ 25 %) > osmotic shock (~ 20 %) > PEF (~ 15 %). In the final chapter the main results and remaining bottlenecks are discussed and a future outlook on microalgae disintegration is presented. To date, <b>bead</b> <b>milling</b> is the only technology able to disintegrate fresh microalgae at specific energy consumptions below 10 % of the total energy available from the algae and release substantial amounts of water soluble protein. The future outlook was based on a techno-economic evaluation, which showed that the cultivation costs are limiting the economic feasibility of microalgae biorefinery. Future focus should be on the cultivation...|$|R
40|$|Contamination of {{soil with}} Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) {{is a serious}} {{environmental}} issue because some PAHs are toxic, carcinogenic and mutagenic. Bioremediation is a promising option to completely remove PAHs from the environment or convert them to less harmful compounds. One of the main challenges in bioremediation of PAHs in a conventional roller bioreactor is the limitation on mass transfer due to the strong hydrophobicity and low water solubility of these compounds. To address this challenge, a novel <b>bead</b> <b>mill</b> bioreactor (BMB) was developed by Riess et al. (2005) which demonstrated a significant improvement in the rates of mass transfer and biodegradation of PAHs. In this study, to further improve mass transfer rates, baffles have been installed in both the conventional and <b>bead</b> <b>mill</b> bioreactors. Mass transfer rates of 1000 mg L- 1 suspended naphthalene, 2 -methylnaphthalene and 1, 5 -dimethylnaphthalene, three model compounds of PAHs, have been investigated in four bioreactors: conventional (control), baffled, BMB and baffled <b>bead</b> <b>mill</b> bioreactors. The baffled bioreactor provided mass transfer coefficients (KLa) that were up to 7 times {{higher than those of}} the control bioreactor. Bioremediation of suspended naphthalene or 2 -methylnaphthalene as a single substrate and their mixtures was studied using the bacterium Pseudomonas putida ATCC 17484. Both baffled and <b>bead</b> <b>mill</b> bioreactors provided maximum bioremediation rates that were 2 times higher than the control bioreactor. The maximum bioremediation rates of 2 -methylnaphthalene were further increased in the presence of naphthalene by a factor of 1. 5 to 2 compared to the single substrate. Another rate-limiting step for bioremediation of PAH-contaminated soil is the strong sorption between the contaminant and soil. To find out the effect of sorption on the bioavailability of naphthalene, the appropriate sorption isotherms for three types of soils (sand, silt and clay) have been determined. It was observed that the sorption capacity of soils for naphthalene was proportional to the organic carbon content of the soils. The mass transfer of soil-bound naphthalene from the artificially prepared contaminated soils with short contamination history to the aqueous phase was studied in both the control and <b>bead</b> <b>mill</b> bioreactors. It was observed that the mass transfer was unexpectedly fast due to the increased interfacial surface area of naphthalene particles and the weak sorption between naphthalene and soils. It was concluded that artificially, naphthalene contaminated soils would likely not be any more difficult to bioremediate than pure naphthalene particles...|$|R
40|$|Nicergoline, {{a poorly}} soluble active {{pharmaceutical}} ingredient, possesses vaso-active properties which causes peripheral and central vasodilatation. In this study, nanocrystals of nicergoline were prepared {{in an aqueous}} solution of polysorbate 80 (nanosuspension) by using four different laboratory scale size reduction techniques: high pressure homogenization (HPH), <b>bead</b> <b>milling</b> (BM), and combination techniques (high pressure homogenization followed by <b>bead</b> <b>milling</b> HPH+BM, and <b>bead</b> <b>milling</b> followed by high pressure homogenization BM+HPH). Nanocrystals were investigated regarding to their mean particles size, zeta potential, and particle dissolution. A short term physical stability study on nanocrystals stored at three different temperatures (4, 20 °C, and 40 °C) was performed to evaluate the tendency to change in particle size, aggregation and zeta-potential. The size reduction technique and the process parameters like milling time, number of homogenization cycles and pressure greatly affected the size of nanocrystals. Among the techniques used, the combination techniques showed superior and consistent particle size reduction {{compared to the other}} two methods, HPH+BM and BM+HPH giving nanocrystals of a mean particle size of 260 nm and 353 nm, respectively. The particle dissolution was increased for any nanocrystals samples, but it was particularly increased by high pressure homogenization and combination techniques. Independently to the production method, nicergoline nanocrystals showed slight increase in particle size over the time, but remained below 500 nm at 20 °C and refrigeration conditions...|$|R

40|$|Pulsed Electric Field (PEF) is {{currently}} discussed as promising technology for mild and scalable cell disintegration of microalgae.

In many cases after treatment, both algal species show release of ions, which indicates that PEF treatment resulted in permeabilization of the algal cell. However, the electroporation effect was not sufficient to substantially release intracellular proteins.

40|$|AbstractThe {{disintegration}} of three industry relevant algae (Chlorella vulgaris, Neochloris oleoabundans and Tetraselmis suecica) was studied {{in a lab}} scale <b>bead</b> <b>mill</b> at different <b>bead</b> sizes (0. 3 – 1 mm). Cell disintegration, proteins and carbohydrates released into the water phase followed a first order kinetics. The process is selective towards proteins over carbohydrates during early stages of milling. In general, smaller beads led to higher kinetic rates, with a minimum specific energy consumption of ⩽ 0. 47 kWhkgDW− 1 for 0. 3 mm beads. After analysis of the stress parameters (stress number and stress intensity), it appears that optimal disintegration and energy usage for all strains occurs in the 0. 3 – 0. 4 mm range. During the course of <b>bead</b> <b>milling,</b> the native structure of the marker protein Rubisco was retained, confirming the mildness of the disruption process...|$|R
