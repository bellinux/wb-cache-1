Nelson was anticipating the railroads running through the newly formed Arup, but in 1909 the Great Northern Railway bypassed it and went through Withrow instead.

40|$|Reading through fashion {{magazines}} we are greeted by advertisements from various fashion brands advertis- ing for both genders. The reader is, however, not always {{aware of all}} the messages being communicated through various signs in advertisement pictures. The purpose of our study is to examine closer whether changes occurred from a gender perspective between 1960 s and 2000 s in print ads by Levi’s Jeans, and how the print ads differ between the genders. We chose to examine this in a clothing company Levi's Jeans, con- sidered {{as it is the}} first original jeans brand, that has advertisements for both genders and has <b>been</b> <b>around</b> for <b>long</b> <b>enough</b> in order to satisfy the criteria of our study. The primary research question of the study is therefore "How has the image of female and male models in Levi's Jeans’ advertising changed from the 1960 s up to the 2000 s?" To carry out our analysis of advertisements we chose to use a qualitative method and conduct a semiotic analysis of five advertisements from 1960 s until 2000 s. Our theoretical framework is the basis for our study and includes semiotics, with the various concepts included in the analysis (sign and its three aspects (index, icon, symbol), connotation/denotation, codes and connection to advertisement), gender stereotypes and body ideal development. We concluded that a change was to be observed both generally in the ads and on a gender specific level. The progress of the models in the Levi's Jeans’ ads from the analyzed time-period followed the general ideal body development also observed in other studies. The advertisements by Levi's Jeans have grown more se- rious and rough, with models expressing less joy and playfulness and to play more on the sexual tension, but less nakedness than expected. ...|$|R

5000|$|Having founded Beacon Boats Co. Ltd. to {{make and}} sell Westcoasters - about 60 {{altogether}} - and then the Corvette, Rayner experimented with a new enterprise making GRP sailing dinghys. From this temporary project he embarked on the factory manufacture of an ideal family sailing boat expanding, in 1963, to larger premises - temperature-and-humidity-controlled - as the firm of Westerly Marine Construction Ltd., at Hambledon Road, Waterlooville near Portsmouth on the Solent, with himself as Chief Designer, having become, in 1964, an Associate of the RINA. He recruited as his directors Kenneth Bates, Michael C.B.Hurd and David G.M.Sanders and Kenneth Todd, while Dodie Walker in Sales was regarded as integral to an enterprise Rayner was determined should attract customers who cared as much about his boats interior comfort and convenience as their sailing qualities, for which Rayner sought Lloyds certification. Two skilled boatbuilders - affectionately esteemed by Rayner as the walrus and the carpenter - were recruited to do the vital job of building the pattern moulds basic to GRP production. GRP was still so recent {{that he had to}} be satisfied with a Lloyds Series Production Certificate affirming that the 4½-ton Westerly 22 [...] - [...] the companys first design [...] - [...] had been built under Lloyds supervision including inspections and tests of hull strength and the factory conditions under which the moulded fibre glass used in construction went through the process, key to its long term integrity, of curing.

I know it meant a lot to Peter to have all of the authentic stories about the silent period in the film, but Rick's script, authentic or not, was terrific. It was just a great drama. By the time Peter was done with it, it was authentic, but it wasn't dramatic anymore. Peter hadn't really experienced any failure yet -- we hired him before 'At Long Last Love' had come out -- so he was easily the most arrogant person I'd ever met in the business, before or since. When we shot the picture, he actually directed some of the scenes on horseback. When I asked him why he was on horseback, he said, [...] "Because that's the way John Ford did it.'"Bogdanovich has an alternative version:I should have never gotten involved, I should have done it myself. I'd been planning to do a big picture about the silent era, largely based on the interviews with Dwan, Walsh and McCarey. I was preparing it and I got a call from my agent and she said they're preparing a movie called Starlight Parade, there's another director involved but they want you. I said, [...] "Well, I don't really want to do their script, I'll have to rewrite it completely." [...] "They'll let you rewrite it, whatever you want." [...] Basically I rewrote the whole damn thing and never used any of Starlight Parade. The trouble was, again, the picture had a balance between comedy and drama and it was a comedy-drama, no question about it, and I had wanted to do it in black and white. It was very important to do it in black and white and Columbia, the studio, wouldn't let me. I had a big fight about that and they cancelled the picture. Then Barry Spikings at British-Lion came in and funded some of the picture, threw in a few million dollars. It ended up being a Columbia-British Lion picture and but when it was all done it was a difficult picture.|$|E
