40|$|Most dry dog {{foods are}} based on cereals, but very little {{published}} information and few comparative studies {{are available on the}} nutritive value of various cereals in dogs. To determine the apparent nutrient digestibilities and feed values of five different autoclave-processed and ground cereals: oat <b>groats,</b> <b>barley,</b> wheat, corn and rice, a digestibility trial was carried out on twelve adult huskies according to a 6 x 4 cyclic changeover design. Total tract organic matter (OM), crude carbohydrate and gross energy (GE) digestibilities were higher in rice than in all the other cereals. Apparent crude protein (CP) and acid hydrolyzed fat digestibilities of rice (80 % and 94 %, respectively) were as good as for oat groats (81 % and 93 %). However, oat groats had higher OM, CP and GE digestibilities than barley, wheat and corn. The amount of digestible crude protein (118 g kg- 1 DM) was higher in oat groats than in the other cereals. Digestible energy contents (MJ kg- 1 DM) of oat groats, rice, corn, wheat and barley were 17. 1, 16. 0, 15. 7, 15. 6 and 15. 5, respectively. The quantity of excreted wet faeces increased and the percentage of dry matter (DM) in faeces decreased when oat <b>groats,</b> <b>barley,</b> wheat or corn were supplemented to the basal diet, in contrast to rice, which had the opposite effect on wet faeces excretion. Oat groats are good substitutes for rice or other cereals in dry dog foods. ...|$|R
50|$|Stippgrütze, {{also called}} Wurstebrei, is a German dish from Westphalia {{which is similar}} to Grützwurst or Knipp. It {{consists}} of <b>barley</b> <b>groats</b> cooked in sausage juices (Wurstbrühe), which are enriched with pieces of meat, offal, such as heart, kidney or liver and seasoned with spices and salt. More rarely, finely chopped onions are added. The cooked ingredients are minced after the juices have been poured off and a crumbly cake is left which is held together with fat and which sets on cooling. There are various recipes, but they all contain <b>barley</b> <b>groats,</b> fat and meat.|$|E
50|$|A classic recipe {{contains}} pig offal or heart, belly pork with rind, lard greaves, <b>barley</b> <b>groats,</b> water, salt, pepper, allspice and thyme. The nutrition varies; one portion {{made from}} about 300 g of pork and 60 g of groats contains about 850 kJ.|$|E
50|$|Black pudding {{is a type}} {{of blood}} sausage {{commonly}} eaten in Great Britain, Ireland and in other parts of Europe.

50|$|On 24 November 1570 he {{was instituted}} to the rectory of Dry Drayton, Cambridgeshire. He used to still preach at St Mary's, Cambridge, where he reproved young divines for {{engaging}} in controversies, as tantamount to rearing a roof before laying a foundation. In his parish he preached frequently, choosing the earliest {{hours of the morning}} for sermon before the work of the day. He devoted Sunday evenings and Thursday mornings to catechizing. He had some divinity pupils, including Henry Smith. During a period of dearth, when <b>barley</b> was ten <b>groats</b> a bushel, he devised a plan for selling corn cheap to the poor, no family being allowed to buy more than three pecks in a week. He cheapened his straw, preached against the public order for lessening the capacity of the bushel, and got into trouble by refusing to let the clerk of the market cut down his measure with the rest. His unworldliness meant that his wife had to borrow money to pay his harvestmen. Richer livings were steadily declined by him. Nevertheless, he was not appreciated by his flock.|$|R
50|$|Nut roasts are {{commonly}} made with any single type or complementary combination of nuts and legumes desired such as walnuts, hazelnuts, Brazil nuts, pecans, cashew nuts, pistachios, chestnuts, sunflower seeds and peanuts and even lentils. The nuts may be whole, chopped up, or ground and are typically combined {{with one or}} several starches such as breadcrumbs or day-old bread, cooked rice, buckwheat kasha, <b>groats,</b> <b>barley,</b> rye or millet. The nuts and the starches are bound together with aromatics such as onions, garlic, or leeks, with fresh vegetable broth or bouillon cubes used and olive oil or butter. Seasoning is provided by complementary herbs of the cook's choosing. Sautéed mushrooms or truffle shavings or flavored oil, or tomatoes or cheese may be added for extra flavour and variety of texture. Vegemite, Marmite, or soy sauce is sometimes used {{as one of the}} stocks or what the onions are fried in. Some recipes call for a chicken's egg to bind the ingredients together. The whole mixture is then roasted or baked in a loaf pan or other baking dish until firm or a crust forms, and then served with side dishes. Whole nuts may be used as a garnish or decoration for the completed roast.|$|R
5000|$|Groats (or in some cases, [...] "berries") are the hulled kernels {{of various}} cereal grains such as oat, wheat, rye, and <b>barley.</b> <b>Groats</b> are whole grains {{that include the}} cereal germ and fiber-rich bran portion of the grain, {{as well as the}} {{endosperm}} (which is the usual product of milling).|$|E
5000|$|Ryynimakkara (Finnish lit. [...] "groat sausage") {{is a type}} of sausage in Finnish cuisine {{containing}} groats. Ryynimakkara has <b>barley</b> <b>groats,</b> {{about one}} fifth of its weight, lowering its meat and fat content. Also, the fat content is considerably lower than other sausages, usually between 10 and 15%. In some traditional recipes ryynimakkaras are prepared with no meat at all.|$|E
50|$|The closest {{relatives}} to the ryynimakkara are the potato sausage (perunamakkara) from the Häme region of Finland, which has potato {{instead of the}} <b>barley</b> <b>groats,</b> blood sausages (verimakkara) and the black sausage (mustamakkara) from Tampere. The use of groats in the ryynimakkara {{is similar to the}} British black pudding although its appearance is different, being a thick and small sausage.|$|E
50|$|Falukorv {{is a large}} {{traditional}} Swedish sausage made of a grated {{mixture of}} pork and beef or veal with potato flour and mild spices.

50|$|According to Columella (De Re Rustica 8.4.1), {{chickens}} {{should be}} fed on <b>barley</b> <b>groats,</b> small chick-peas, millet and wheat bran, {{if they are}} cheap. Wheat itself should be avoided as it is harmful to the birds. Boiled ryegrass (Lolium sp.) and the leaves and seeds of alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) {{can be used as}} well. Grape marc can be used, but only when the hens stop laying eggs, that is, about the middle of November; otherwise eggs are small and few. When feeding grape marc, it should be supplemented with some bran. Hens start to lay eggs after the winter solstice, in warm places around the first of January, in colder areas in the middle of February. Parboiled barley increases their fertility; this should be mixed with alfalfa leaves and seeds, or vetches or millet if alfalfa is not at hand. Free-ranging chickens should receive two cups of barley daily.|$|E

This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Abstract In recent years, {{there has been}} an ever-increasing interest in the research of polyphenols obtained from dietary sources, and their antioxidative properties. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the effect of boiling buckwheat and <b>barley</b> <b>groats</b> on the antioxidant properties and dietary fiber composition. Antioxidative properties were investigated using methyl linoleate model system, by assessing the DPPH (2, 2 -diphenyl- 1 -picrylhydrazyl) radical scavenging activity and metal chelating activity. The results were compared with butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT). Raw barley and buckwheat groats extracts showed higher DPPH scavenging ability com-pared to boiled barley and buckwheat groats extracts. Raw <b>barley</b> <b>groats</b> extract exhibited higher antioxidant activity than boiled groats extract in the methyl linoleate emulsion. Higher chelating ability in relation to Fe (II) ions was observed for boiled groats extracts as compared to raw groats extracts. BHT showed small antiradical activity and metal chelating activity, while showing higher antioxidative activity in emulsion sys-tem. The analysis of groats extracts using HPLC method showed the presence of rutin, catechin, quercetin, gallic, p-hydroxybenzoic, p-coumaric, o-coumaric, vanillic, sinapic, and ferulic acids. Differences in the content of dietary fiber and its fractions were observed in the examined products. The highest total dietary fiber content was detected in boiled buckwheat groats, while the lowest- in boiled <b>barley</b> <b>groats.</b> The scientific achievements of this research could help con-sumers to choose those cereal products available on the mar-ket, such as barley and buckwheat groats, which are a rich source of antioxidative compounds and dietary fiber.

40|$|A {{number of}} studiesl- 8 have {{provided}} {{evidence that the}} mineral content of a diet may affect its cariogenicity. It may have been such investigations as these which led Rozeik, Cremer, and Hannover 9 {{to consider the possibility}} that the minerals in the cacao bean might account for some of the results obtained in the Vipeholm experiments. ' 0 In these experiments the subjects who ate 8 toffees daily between meals over a 2 -year period had an increase in caries activity more than twice that of those who ate almost the same amount of sugar between meals in the form of milk chocolate. In experiments by Rozeik, Cremer, and Hannover on sialoadenectomized white rats, there was considerably less dental caries in the animals fed a diet containing cacao-bean ash than in those on the control diet. These observations led the authors to conclude that the ash of the cacao bean is caries-inhibitory. It should be noted, however, that there were several differences in the composition of the control and test diets, apart from the ash content of the latter. The control diet consisted of 200 gm. <b>barley</b> <b>groats,</b> 100 gm. fish meal, and 100 gm. powdered sugar.

40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} test the hypothesis that feeding diets which limit the amount of fermentable substrate entering the large intestine would protect pigs against experimental infection with Serpulina hyodysenteriae, the causative agent of swine dysentery. Experiment 1 examined the effect of grain processing (hammer milling vs. steam flaking) and grain type (<b>barley,</b> <b>groats,</b> corn, sorghum and wheat) on indices of fermentation in the large intestine and the incidence of swine dysentery. Experiment 2 examined the role of five diets, steam-flaked corn, steam-flaked sorghum, hammer-milled wheat, extruded wheat and cooked white rice, on these same measures. All diets contained an animal protein supplement and no antibiotics. Pigs fed diets based on steam-flaked corn and steam-flaked sorghum had a lower incidence of disease (11 – 33 %) than pigs fed diets based on other grains (75 – 100 %). Pigs fed the diet based on cooked white rice were fully protected against swine dysentery. Both the soluble non-starch polysaccharide (NSP) concentration and the total NSP concentration of the diets explained a significant proportion of the variation in swine dysentery (R 2 = 0. 56, P = 0. 016, and R 2 = 0. 71, P = 0. 002, respectively), such that pigs eating diets containing 50 %). This was attributable to a higher level of resistant starch present in these grains. These data provide evidence that the expression of swine dysentery is associated with an increased concentration of fermentable substrate entering the large intestine...|$|E
40|$|Swine {{dysentery}} (SD) is {{a severe}} mucohaemorrhagic colitis resulting from infection with the anaerobic spirochaetal bacterium, Serpulina hyodysenteriae. The disease affects weaner and grower pigs throughout the world, and causes significant financial losses due to mortality, decreased rate of growth, poor feed conversion, and expense of chemotherapy. Previous {{studies have shown}} that despite the presence of S. hyodysenteriae in pigs on many farms, clinical signs of SD do not always occur. This study was aimed at investigating the effect of diet on the clinical expression of SD. The ultimate aim was to identify diets {{that could be used to}} prevent or control the disease. One hundred and seventy-eight weaner pigs were purchased from specific-pathogen free farms and fed one of 16 diets based on: cooked riceanimal protein, cooked rice-dehulled lupin, wheat-lupin, wheat-animal protein, parboiled rice dehulled lupin, parboiled rice-animal protein, and processed (hammer-milled or steam-flaked) cereal grains (<b>barley,</b> <b>groats,</b> maize, sorghum and wheat) supplemented with animal protein. Eighty four pigs on these diets were slaughtered after one month to measure the influence of the diets on parameters in the large intestine, including organ sizes, and pH, VFA concentrations and dry matter content of the digesta in the caecum, and proximal and distal colon. The cooked rice-animal protein diet caused low levels of microbial fermentation in the large intestine of pigs as indicated by higher pH values, lower VFAs, smaller intestinal organ sizes, and drier contents in the colon and rectum, compared to pigs on the other diets. A limited amount of fermentative substrates from the cooked rice-animal protein diet entered the large intestine, and this led to a low microbial fermentation activity. Pigs fed diets containing cereal grains, parboiled rice and or dehulled lupins had greater fermentative activity in the large intestine. Parboiled rice unexpectedly was not easily digestible. Of the processed cereal grain diets, steam-flaked grains resulted in significantly higher (< 0. 05) intestinal pH values than hammer-milled grains. This suggested that steam-flaking process made the nutrients (most likely starch) more available for digestion in the small intestine than did the hammer-milling process. Another 94 pigs fed on the various diets were orally challenged with broth cultures of S, hyodysenteriae and were monitored for faecal excretion of spirochaetes, and for the development of SD. Diseased pigs were slaughtered immediately, and healthy pigs were slaughtered after 4 - 6 weeks, and changes in the large intestine were recorded. None of 16 challenged pigs fed cooked rice-animal protein developed SD and it was assumed that the reduced fermentation with this diet inhibited colonisation by S. hyodysenteriae, and expression of SD. Disease occurred in varying numbers of pigs fed all the other diets, for example cooked rice-dehulled lupin (83. 3...|$|E
