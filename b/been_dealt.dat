5|$|I {{have been}} {{thinking}} how very gently I have always <b>been</b> <b>dealt</b> with. I {{have never had a}} violent shove all my life. The only desire which I can have is like David to serve my own generation by the will of God, and then fall asleep.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{pressing}} concerns facing the government in exile in 1940 was the situation of Belgian refugees in the United Kingdom. By 1940, at least 15,000 Belgian civilians {{had arrived in the}} United Kingdom, many of them without their possessions. The refugees had originally <b>been</b> <b>dealt</b> with by the British government, however in September 1940, the government established a Central Service of Refugees to provide material assistance and employment for Belgians in Britain.|$|E
5|$|Globocnik and I {{were talking}} about Operation Reinhard, which was in full effect {{following}} Heydrich's murder, and also the construction of Sobibor and Treblinka. I know I asked him about Höss, who was also standing there and had been summoned by Himmler regarding logistics or something regarding the new camp (Auschwitz). Then Globocnik mentioned to me and Kaltenbrunner that Lidice had been cleared, and all the Jews and Czechs had <b>been</b> <b>dealt</b> with. I noticed that this young pilot, who I later learned was Marseille, must have overheard, and I debated whether I should go over and say something to him. I decided against it.|$|E
50|$|Each player <b>is</b> <b>dealt</b> eight (8) cards, thus all cards <b>are</b> <b>dealt.</b>|$|R
50|$|Another variant {{is played}} by {{reducing}} to four betting rounds: one after the hole cards <b>are</b> <b>dealt</b> but before any community cards are, then another after {{the left and right}} cards of the cross <b>are</b> <b>dealt</b> at the same time, a third after the top and bottom cards of the cross <b>are</b> <b>dealt,</b> and a final round after the center card <b>is</b> <b>dealt.</b>|$|R

5|$|In early 1973, the Architectural Review {{submitted}} {{a proposal to}} convert the Albert Bridge into a landscaped public park and pedestrian footpath across the river. The proposal proved very popular with the area's residents, and a May 1973 campaign led by John Betjeman, Sybil Thorndike and Laurie Lee raised a petition of 2,000signatures for the bridge to be permanently closed to traffic. Although the GLC reopened the bridge to traffic in July 1973, it also announced its intention {{to proceed with the}} Architectural Review scheme once legal matters had <b>been</b> <b>dealt</b> with.|$|E
5|$|The {{last major}} European {{outbreak}} of smallpox was in 1972 in Yugoslavia, after a pilgrim from Kosovo {{returned from the}} Middle East, where he had contracted the virus. The epidemic infected 175 people, causing 35 deaths. Authorities declared martial law, enforced quarantine, and undertook widespread re-vaccination of the population, enlisting {{the help of the}} WHO. In two months, the outbreak was over. Prior to this, there had been a smallpox outbreak in May–July 1963 in Stockholm, Sweden, brought from the Far East by a Swedish sailor; this had <b>been</b> <b>dealt</b> with by quarantine measures and vaccination of the local population.|$|E
5|$|The work {{assumes that}} the royal legal system would still address some issues that later would have <b>been</b> <b>dealt</b> with by ecclesiastical courts. Clergy are not only {{to take part in}} the shire court, but could be summoned to answer charges in the court. It also sets out the various courts that were {{established}} and their jurisdiction. It takes for granted that the Anglo-Saxon laws of England are still in effect. It also addresses the administration of forest law under Henry I. Another new concern in the Leges is law covering the roadways and highways.|$|E
50|$|A game {{consists}} of 15 hands; {{in the first}} hand, 8 cards <b>are</b> <b>dealt</b> to each player. In the second hand, 7 cards <b>are</b> <b>dealt,</b> and so on until the eighth hand, when only one card <b>is</b> <b>dealt</b> to each player. Following this, each hand increases the number of cards dealt to each player by one, until the fifteenth hand, in which 8 cards <b>are</b> <b>dealt.</b>|$|R
50|$|Over {{the first}} queen, the cards <b>are</b> <b>dealt</b> over it until another queen appears. This new queen becomes {{the base for}} a new tableau column and cards <b>are</b> <b>dealt</b> over it. This is {{repeated}} until all eight queens are uncovered and all cards <b>are</b> <b>dealt.</b>|$|R
50|$|Cards <b>are</b> <b>dealt</b> {{into eight}} columns of six cards. They <b>are</b> <b>dealt</b> {{in such a}} way that no two cards in the same column have the same rank. To avoid that, the identically ranking card is placed at the bottom of the deck and a new one <b>is</b> <b>dealt.</b>|$|R
5|$|After having Lord Rivers arrested, the two dukes {{moved to}} Stony Stratford where Richard {{informed}} the young king of a plot aimed at denying him {{his role as}} Protector whose perpetrators had <b>been</b> <b>dealt</b> with. He proceeded to escort the young king to London where they entered on 4 May displaying the carriages of weapons Earl Rivers had taken with his 2000 man army. Richard first accommodated Edward in the Bishop's apartments, then, on the Duke of Buckingham's suggestion, in the Royal Apartments of the Tower of London where kings customarily awaited their coronation. On hearing the news of her brother's arrest on 30 April, the Dowager Queen fled to sanctuary in Westminster Abbey together with her son by her first marriage Thomas Grey, 1st Marquess of Dorset, her five daughters and her youngest son Richard, Duke of York. On 16 June Elizabeth Woodville agreed {{to hand over the}} younger prince to the Archbishop of Canterbury so that he might attend his brother Edward's coronation, still planned for 22 June.|$|E
5|$|Details of Carol's death were {{revealed}} in the post mortem. There were severe injuries to the skull, and {{it was said that}} her face had been smashed by multiple blows. It was later found in court that the murder weapon had been an ice axe. The body was found to be in a foetal position, which suggested that the body had <b>been</b> <b>dealt</b> with within a few hours of death, before rigor mortis could settle in. It has since been said that the investigators failed to acknowledge that rigor mortis passes in a 24‑to48‑hour time period, and that the body could feasibly have been trussed once rigor mortis had passed. Many unusual knots were used to tie the body, and the same knots were said to be used in Gordon Park's house and boat. This was one of the key pieces of evidence used against Gordon in the trial.|$|E
5|$|These events {{coincided with}} the {{accession}} of Nero to the imperial throne in Rome, and the young emperor decided to react vigorously. The war, which was the only major foreign campaign of his reign, began with rapid success for the Roman forces, led by the able general Gnaeus Domitius Corbulo. They overcame the forces loyal to Tiridates, installed their own candidate, Tigranes VI, on the Armenian throne, and left the country. The Romans were aided {{by the fact that}} the Parthian king Vologases was embroiled in the suppression of a series of revolts in his own country. As soon as these had <b>been</b> <b>dealt</b> with, however, the Parthians turned their attention to Armenia, and after a couple of years of inconclusive campaigning, inflicted a heavy defeat on the Romans in the Battle of Rhandeia.|$|E
5000|$|Players <b>are</b> <b>dealt</b> 5 cards each. Each player <b>is</b> <b>dealt</b> three {{cards at}} once, {{starting}} with the player left of the dealer and continuing in a clockwise-direction, then each player <b>is</b> <b>dealt</b> two cards at once in the same order. The dealer never deals more than three cards at a time.|$|R
50|$|Cards must <b>be</b> <b>dealt</b> so {{that each}} player ends up with four cards after the crib is formed, and the crib should also have four cards. For two players, each <b>is</b> <b>dealt</b> six cards (though some play with five cards dealt to each player and two to the crib). For three or four players, each <b>is</b> <b>dealt</b> five cards. In the case of three players, a single card <b>is</b> <b>dealt</b> face {{down in front of}} the dealer to start the crib.|$|R

5|$|Much of the post-race debate {{centred on}} the Red Bulls' clash {{at the front}} of the field on lap 40. Both Webber and Vettel blamed each other for the crash. Team {{principal}} Christian Horner implied Webber remained partially responsible for failing to give Vettel enough room on the run to the corner, and he was noticeably frustrated and angry at both of his drivers for wasting a potential 1–2 finish. Red Bull motorsport adviser Helmut Marko insisted the team did not favour Vettel through their strategy and also offered the perspective that Vettel had to attack for fear of backing off into the clutches of Hamilton behind. McLaren chief engineer Tim Goss said the crash had prevented Red Bull from securing a 1–2 finish, but understood why Webber switched to a different engine mode as he noted that one of Vettel's engines had failed earlier in the season. He felt that the battle between both McLaren and Red Bull drivers for both championships would continue unabated. Red Bull held a meeting at their factory in Milton Keynes four days after the race, and all people in attendance believed the situation had <b>been</b> <b>dealt</b> with. The incident between Webber and Vettel is widely seen by the media as a key moment in the rivalry between the two drivers, which had started when Vettel collided with Webber at the 2007 Japanese Grand Prix and both drivers were forced to retire.|$|E
25|$|Blackjack {{has many}} rule variations. Since the 1960s, {{blackjack}} {{has been a}} high-profile target of advantage players, particularly card counters, who track the profile of cards that have <b>been</b> <b>dealt</b> and adapt their wagers and playing strategies accordingly.|$|E
25|$|Transport for London {{proposes to}} upgrade the line eventually, but not until other deep-level lines have <b>been</b> <b>dealt</b> with. This will include new {{signalling}} and new trains, enabling a maximum frequency of 27 trains per hour. TfL currently expects these {{to be in place}} by 2033.|$|E
2500|$|The {{result of}} {{this section of the}} Act is that any case worth less than £25,000 <b>is</b> <b>dealt</b> with in the County Courts, any case worth between £25,000 and £50,000 <b>is</b> <b>dealt</b> with in either the County Court or the High Court {{depending}} on the complexity and any case worth more than £50,000 <b>is</b> <b>dealt</b> with in the High Court. Claims worth under £3,000 <b>are</b> automatically <b>dealt</b> with by the small claims track of the County Court. This has drastically speeded up proceedings in the High Court by making sure that only [...] "important" [...] and valuable cases <b>are</b> <b>dealt</b> with by them.|$|R
50|$|In most {{games the}} last 3 cards <b>are</b> <b>dealt</b> after the bidding to avoid cheating, but can <b>be</b> <b>dealt</b> {{with the first}} 5 and not touched.|$|R
5000|$|There {{are three}} more betting rounds. Before each round each player draws an {{additional}} card. Cards {{five and six}} <b>are</b> <b>dealt</b> face up, card seven <b>is</b> <b>dealt</b> face down.|$|R
25|$|The Harry Potter series {{presents}} {{many challenges}} to translators, such as rhymes, acronyms, dialects, culture, riddles, jokes, invented words, and plot points that revolve around spellings or initials. These have <b>been</b> <b>dealt</b> with by various translators with {{different degrees of}} modification {{to the meaning of}} the original text.|$|E
25|$|Without doubt, the US {{was right}} to remove bin Laden, but {{it is wrong to}} think that his death will weaken al-Qaeda. Yes, a colossal {{psychological}} blow has <b>been</b> <b>dealt,</b> but al-Qaeda is no longer a mere organisation, but a global brand, an idea, a philosophy that now has its first Saudi martyr from the holy lands of Islam.|$|E
25|$|Testing {{revealed}} that the XB-42 suffered from some instability as excessive yaw was encountered, as well as vibration and poor engine cooling - all problems that could probably have <b>been</b> <b>dealt</b> with. Due to the ventral vertical stabilizer and rudder surface set's tip being located underneath the fuselage, careful handling during taxiing, takeoff, and landing was required because of limited ground clearance.|$|E
50|$|From a {{standard}} deck use 13 cards for every player, {{in the first}} hand. Every hand after first, one card less <b>is</b> <b>dealt,</b> until only one card <b>is</b> <b>dealt.</b> Then for the next 4 hands (in the case of 4 player game), including the first one, only 1 card <b>is</b> <b>dealt</b> so every player {{gets a chance to}} be a dealer.|$|R
50|$|The player {{compares the}} final Attack and Defense values. If the Attack {{is equal to}} or greater than the Defense, then 1 point of damage <b>is</b> <b>dealt.</b> If the Attack is twice the Defense or more, 2 points of damage <b>are</b> <b>dealt</b> instead. Unless stated by a card effect, no more than 2 points of damage can <b>be</b> <b>dealt</b> a turn.|$|R
50|$|This version {{also allows}} four players to play, {{in which case}} four cards <b>are</b> <b>dealt</b> before the bid, and two cards <b>are</b> <b>dealt</b> after the bid, per player. It can be {{extended}} to include eight players also, {{in which case the}} cards 7 and 8 from each suit are introduced. Three cards <b>are</b> <b>dealt</b> before and one card after the bid, per player.|$|R
25|$|First Trick Clubs: This rule is {{borrowed}} {{from a common}} variation of Hearts rules. Whoever possesses the lowest Club, usually 2, 3 (if deuces are high), must open the play. Other players can play any card except Spades on the first trick, unless the player has nothing but Spades (rare, as the player {{would have to have}} <b>been</b> <b>dealt</b> every Spade in the deck).|$|E
25|$|Again, {{under the}} cover of intense aerial bombardment, US {{infantry}} and local Afghan forces attacked, shattering the al-Qaeda position and killing or capturing many of the militants. By early 2002, al-Qaeda had <b>been</b> <b>dealt</b> a serious blow to its operational capacity, and the Afghan invasion appeared an initial success. Nevertheless, a significant Taliban insurgency remains in Afghanistan, and al-Qaeda's top two leaders, bin Laden and al-Zawahiri, evaded capture.|$|E
25|$|This {{criticism}} was strongly {{rejected by the}} prosecutor's office on 30 November. It claimed that the corruption in the Sukhumi administration could only be investigated properly once Khajimba's allies O.L. Berulava and T.V. Parulua had been take of the case, and that corruption in other cities had not been ignored since misdealings in the Ochamchira district administration had also <b>been</b> <b>dealt</b> with. It furthermore criticized possibly corrupt affairs during Khajimba's own time as Prime Minister.|$|E
5000|$|... 1) Each player <b>is</b> <b>dealt</b> four {{cards in}} a row, face down. Then, four cards <b>are</b> <b>dealt</b> {{face up to}} each player and placed {{on top of the}} first four cards.
