5000|$|Within the game's main [...] "Adventure" [...] mode, Peggle {{is divided}} into fifty-five levels. Each level {{features}} an arrangement of approximately one hundred blue [...] "pegs", positioned to correspond with the level's background picture, inside of three walls {{on the top and}} sides (leaving the bottom opened), along with other fixed and moving features. The goal of each level is to clear the board of the twenty-five random pegs that are turned orange {{at the start of the}} level, by using a ball launcher located at the top center of the screen to strike one or more of the pegs. Pegs light up when hit, and once the ball either falls through the bottom of the screen or is caught by the <b>ball</b> <b>catcher</b> that moves back and forth along the bottom in a fixed manner, the pegs will be removed. Struck pegs are also removed if the ball is stuck on them. The player begins each level with ten balls (twelve on the non-Touch iPod version) to clear the orange pegs, but may earn more by landing the ball in the <b>ball</b> <b>catcher,</b> or by earning high scores on single shots. Failure to clear the board with the allotted number of balls will require the player to restart the level, while completing this objective will allow the player to progress forward to the next board.|$|E
5000|$|Every five {{levels in}} the Adventure mode {{correspond}} to playing with one of ten [...] "Peggle Masters", cartoon characters that help the player. Each of the Peggle Masters has a unique special ability that is activated when the player strikes {{one of the two}} randomly selected green pegs on the board. Some abilities activate immediately; one ability causes a second ball to be generated from the green peg when struck. Other abilities will have effects that activate on the next shot or for several more shots; one ability shows the ball's path including rebounds, while another will extend the length of the <b>ball</b> <b>catcher.</b> In the final five levels of the Adventure mode, called [...] "Master" [...] levels, the player can select which of the Peggle Masters they want to use.|$|E
5000|$|The {{title of}} fullback (numbered 1) {{comes from the}} fullback's {{defensive}} position where the player drops out of the defensive line to cover the rear from kicks and runners breaking the line. They therefore usually are good <b>ball</b> <b>catchers</b> and clinical tacklers. In attack the fullback will typically make runs into the attack or support a runner {{in anticipation of a}} pass out of the tackle. Fullbacks can play a role in attack similar to a halfback or five-eighth {{and the fact that the}} fullback does not have to defend in the first defensive line means that a coach can keep a playmaker from the tackling responsibilities of the first line whilst allowing them to retain their attacking role.|$|R
5000|$|The term [...] "base on balls" [...] distinguishes a {{walk from}} the other manners in which a batter can be awarded first base without {{liability}} to be put out (e.g., hit by pitch (HBP), catcher's interference). Though a base on <b>balls,</b> <b>catcher's</b> interference, or a batter hit by a pitched ball all result in the batter (and possibly runners on base) being awarded a base, [...] the term [...] "walk" [...] usually refers only to a base on balls, {{and not the other}} methods of reaching base without the bat touching the ball. An important difference is that for a hit batter or <b>catcher's</b> interference, the <b>ball</b> is dead and no one may advance unless forced; the ball is live after a walk (see below for details).|$|R

5000|$|In {{addition}} to clearing the board, the player is challenged {{to get high}} scores with each shot. Points come from two main sources: striking pegs, and style points. Each struck peg earns points, with further bonuses gained by hitting numerous pegs on a single shot, and by clearing orange pegs, which builds up a scoring multiplier up to 10x when {{all but a few}} orange pegs remain. Additionally, for each shot, one random blue peg will be marked purple and revert to blue after the shot if it is not struck; striking this peg will further boost the player's score. Style points are awarded for making difficult shots such as striking two orange pegs consecutively that are a distance apart, or by getting lucky bounces off the <b>ball</b> <b>catcher.</b> When the player clears the board of orange pegs, as announced by the song [...] "Ode To Joy" [...] and the message [...] "Extreme Fever", the bottom of the level is replaced with five bins of different point values that the ball will fall into. The player is awarded this score in {{addition to}} any unused balls remaining to get their final score for the level. If all the pegs on a level are cleared, a bonus is awarded and all the bins turn to the maximum value and the message [...] "Ultra Extreme Fever" [...] is displayed.|$|E
5000|$|Though {{the game}} was {{technically}} completed within a year, PopCap opted {{to spend more time}} to polish it, improving the visuals and background images. The team spent time refining the various sound effects used in the game, in order to provide an appropriate atmosphere. In some cases, they found the desired sound quickly; the sound of the ball hitting a peg was borrowed from another game in development at PopCap, but was considered perfect for Peggle. Other cases required iteration; the sound of the ball shooter was originally closer to that of a cannon, while a [...] "plunk" [...] sound effect was used when the <b>ball</b> <b>catcher</b> caught a ball. These were changed to more airy sounds (an air cannon and a brief angelic chorus) {{in order to make the}} elements sound as if part of the game's music. The team found it helped to create a defining moment at the end of each level when the player is moments from clearing the final peg. This initially was programmed as a simple message stating [...] "Extreme Fever" [...] and the music of Ode to Joy as a placeholder. Sidhu wanted to recreate the [...] "wild sounds and visuals" [...] that were present on winning pachinko games. However, the team found that the players reacted well to the simpler placeholder elements, and the team focused on improving the presentation of these, including adding a zoom on the current ball as it neared the last orange peg to be cleared.|$|E

Expectation of occlusion resulted in an adapted limb transport and increased grasping time, whereas in the unexpected condition a higher peak of wrist velocity was evident for all occlusion conditions. The observed different adaptations cannot be explained by trial-by-trial adaptations alone and instead provide evidence for the influence of explicit advance knowledge in the motor response of interceptive actions. status: publishe...|$|R

25|$|The {{ultimate}} single achievement among pitchers is {{a perfect}} game, which has been accomplished 23 times in over 135 years, most recently by Félix Hernández of the Seattle Mariners on August 15, 2012. By definition, a perfect game is counted as a shutout. A no-hitter completed by one pitcher is also a shutout unless the opposing team manages to score {{through a series of}} errors, base on <b>balls,</b> <b>catcher's</b> interferences, dropped third strikes, or hit batsmen. The all-time career leader in shutouts is Walter Johnson, who pitched for the Washington Senators from 1907–1927. He accumulated 110 shutouts, which is 20 more than the second place leader, Pete Alexander. The most shutouts recorded in one season was 16, which was a feat accomplished by both Pete Alexander (1916) and George Bradley (1876). These records are considered among the most secure records in baseball, because pitchers today rarely earn {{more than one or two}} shutouts per season with a heavy emphasis on pitch count and relief pitching. Complete games themselves have also become rare among starting pitchers.|$|R

40|$|Chapman (1968) {{proposed}} that <b>ball</b> <b>catchers</b> run backwards {{when they see}} the projection of an approaching ball accelerate, and forwards when they see it decelerate. However, we suggested that the threshold for distinguishing acceleration from deceleration is too high to account for catchers' performance (Brouwer et al., 2002). This work has been criticized for generalizing thresholds as measured on small screens to a ball catching situation (Zaal et al., 2003). In real ball catching, subjects track the ball by making head movements. This allows for the possibility that signals from the vestibular system reduce the acceleration threshold. We simulated the first 319 ms of approaching balls on a large screen and asked 10 subjects to judge whether the balls would land behind or ahead of them. Subjects did not perform better when they tracked the balls with their head compared to when they kept their head stationary. It is thus unlikely that tracking enables subjects to use acceleration. We propose an alternative cue, which is based on a combination of the rate of expansion of the ball's projection, and its angular velocity. We found some (tentative) evidence for the use of rate of expansion as proposed by our cue...|$|R

40|$|Chapman [1] {{proposed}} that <b>ball</b> <b>catchers</b> run backwards {{when they see}} the projection of an approaching ball accelerate, and forwards when they see it decelerate. However, the threshold for distinguishing acceleration from deceleration is too high to account for catchers' performance in selecting the appropriate running direction. We propose an alternative cue, which is based on a combination of estimates for the ball's horizontal and vertical speed. These estimates are based on the rate of expansion of the ball's projection, and its angular velocity, respectively. In order to test this alternative cue we simulated the rst 300 ms of an approaching ball on a large screen. The rate of expansion was either simulated realistically, or else the simulated ball either expanded too fast or too slowly. Subjects indicated whether they expected the ball to land ahead of them or behind them. If subjects use the Chapman strategy, our manipulation of the rate of expansion should not make a difference, because the vertical acceleration of the projection was not varied. If they use the cue that we propose, they should be biased to respond `ahead' when the rate of expansion is reduced and `behind' when it was increased. We did nd such biases. However, the difference between the conditions was not as large as we predicted. This may indicate that subjects use additional cues to estimate the ball's horizontal speed...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{experiment}} {{was to examine the}} effects of advance knowledge on the kinematics of one-handed catching. Balls were launched from a distance of 8. 4 m by a ball-projection machine with adjustable launching speed. Fifteen skilled <b>ball</b> <b>catchers</b> caught 160 <b>balls</b> with their preferred hand under blocked-order (4 blocks, each comprising 20 trials at 1 of 4 different ball speeds) or random-order (4 blocks, each comprising 20 trials of 4 different ball speeds) conditions. By projecting balls with different ball speeds from a fixed position, it was possible to modify the temporal constraints of the catching task. In both the blocked-order and random-order conditions, catching performance (number of catches, touches and misses) decreased with increasing temporal constraints. Analysis of successful trials indicated that this equal level of catching performance was achieved with different movement kinematics. Specifically, there was a change in movement time, latency, wrist velocity profile, and coefficient of straightness. Based on expectancy of previous trials, movement kinematics was scaled to ball speed in the blocked-order condition whereas in the random-order condition, participants exhibited a more default initial response. However, this latter mode of control was functional in that it increased the likelihood of success for the higher ball speeds while also providing participants with a larger temporal window to negotiate the unexpected temporal constraint on-line for the lowest ball speed. © 2009 Springer-Verlag...|$|R
