5000|$|Sicilian philosopher Empedocles (ca. 450 BC) proved (at {{least to}} his satisfaction) that air was a {{separate}} substance by observing that a <b>bucket</b> <b>inverted</b> in water {{did not become}} filled with water, a pocket of air remaining trapped inside. [...] Prior to Empedocles, Greek philosophers had debated which substance was the primordial element from which everything else was made; Heraclitus championed fire, Thales supported water, and Anaximenes plumped for air. Anaximander argued that the primordial substance was not any of the known substances, but could be transformed into them, and they into each other. [...] Empedocles {{was the first to}} propose four elements, fire, earth, air, and water. [...] He called them the four [...] "roots" [...] (ῥιζὤματα, rhizōmata).|$|R

50|$|A helical {{camshaft}} must operate {{through a}} lift-multiplying pivoting follower. The Helical Camshaft could not really {{be used with}} an <b>inverted</b> <b>bucket</b> type of follower. Even though the <b>inverted</b> <b>bucket</b> is still used, it is being increasingly replaced both in road and racing engines by the pivoting “finger” follower. As well as needing a pivoting follower, if the engine has four valves per cylinder then the follower must be forked so that the one Helical Camshaft lobe operates two valves. This is more a characteristic than a problem. If a really wide duration range is required, because axial space is somewhat limited along the camshaft, usually only room for one Helical Camshaft lobe (and its operating space) can be found.|$|R
50|$|All {{versions}} {{feature a}} {{grey cast iron}} block and an aluminum head with a single or double overhead chain driven camshafts. SOHC engines use two valves per cylinder and DOHC versions use four valves per cylinder with a pentroof chamber, the valve angle being 22 degrees from vertical. All engines use flat <b>inverted</b> <b>bucket</b> type valve lifters, hydraulic {{in the case of}} DOHC engines.|$|R
5000|$|Mechanical traps. They have a float {{that rises}} and falls in {{relation}} to condensate level and this usually has a mechanical linkage attached that opens and closes the valve. Mechanical traps operate in direct relationship to condensate levels present {{in the body of}} the steam trap. Mechanical steam traps have a typical service of life of 3-4 years. <b>Inverted</b> <b>bucket</b> and float traps are examples of mechanical traps. Float traps are classified into [...] "free ball float traps" [...] and [...] "lever ball float traps".|$|R

He is the only cheerful member of this company of four, but his brightness is due less to a manly desire to succour the helpless than to his having been lately {{in the throes of}} composition, and to his modest satisfaction with the result. He reads to the ladies, and they listen, each with one scared eye to the things that fall from trees.|$|R
25|$|All Swifts (export models) got a {{redesigned}} {{front and}} rear fascia {{as well as a}} new dashboard. GS sedans received power steering and new hub caps. The 1.0-liter three-cylinder engine received a new cylinder head assembly: the engine of the previous generation used the same block and corresponding components but featured a head with valves in a V-formation straddling a single camshaft with rocker arms on shafts, whereas now the cylinder head assumed a much slimmer profile, owing to the valves now being in a vertical, inline configuration, actuated by <b>inverted</b> <b>buckets</b> also serving as hydraulic valve lash adjusters, all underneath a single overhead camshaft.|$|R
40|$|Refining 155, 000 {{barrels of}} crude oil daily, a Louisiana plant markets oil {{products}} to gas stations in at least 26 states, including Washington, D. C. The plant uses 8, 538 steam traps with 1, 200 -, 600 -, 250 -, 75 -, 40 - and 15 -psi nominal pressures. Standardized with <b>inverted</b> <b>bucket</b> steam traps, the Louisiana refinery?s maintenance and energy coordinator was content with the results. The Spirax Sarco Inc (SSI) team demonstrated SSI?s Energy Service Group (ESG) capabilities and successes to the refinery manager, operations manager and production manager. From 2004 through 2006, the team presented a series of ESG seminars at the refinery site. The numerous models demonstrated quantitative savings with 3 - to 12 -mo paybacks. For a complete SSI turnkey program, for example, the SSI team presented an ROI with {{less than six months}} payback. The ESG survey found that only 3, 952 (46. 3 %) of the steam traps were operating correctly. The remaining steam traps experienced a variety of failures, including: 613 (7. 2 %) that failed open; 2, 763 (32. 4 %) were cold; 1, 012 (11. 9 %) that failed closed; 6 (0. 0 %) exhibited rapid cycling; and 192 (2. 2 %) were disconnected. The team also found performance and temperature issues with the HP sulfur reactors in the SRU units, largely due to the application of <b>inverted</b> <b>bucket</b> steam traps. Plus, as a result of excessive steam leaks, the sulfur reactors were creating a safety hazard. When these results were presented, management agreed that the sulfur reactors needed process improvement. The SSI team recommended replacing the <b>inverted</b> <b>bucket</b> steam traps with 1 - 1 / 2 -in. strainers and 1 - 1 / 2 -in. flanged float & thermostatic steam traps. They also suggested that the existing trap discharge piping should be removed and re-piped with globe-style bypass valves and gate-style isolation valves to reduce flow velocity. Once the SSI team began negotiations, it only took one survey for the Louisiana refinery to realize all the energy savings opportunities. In fact, the ESG survey uncovered more than $ 1. 3 million in steam losses through failed steam traps and another $ 1 million in steam leak opportunities and production, process, safety and environmental improvements. Impressed with the survey results, the refinery approved the estimated $ 110, 000 turnkey project, which offered a 5. 3 -month payback. Further negotiations netted the team annual steam trap surveys for the next three years, as well as an approved 2008 energy budget of $ 600, 000. Additionally, the Louisiana refinery has indicated that upon successful completion of the ESG program, SSI?s annual energy budget will increase to $ 1, 000, 000. ...|$|R
50|$|Sugary syrup, {{which can}} be HFCS or {{dissolved}} table sugar, can be fed from outside the hive or inside the hive. When syrup is fed outside the hive the usual arrangement is a 5gal bucket filled with syrup and a floating perch. In {{the absence of a}} float, many bees will drown in the sugary solution.Inside the hive, syrup feeders are either hanging like frames or put on top of the hive, so called hive-top feeders. Hive-top feeders can be a specially designed hive boxes or an <b>inverted</b> <b>bucket</b> with a screened hole. Syrup feeders with a 2:1 concentration of water and sugar by weight are typically used in the fall after the last honey is removed. At the beginning of the brood rearing season in the late winter or spring a 1:1 concentration of water and sugar is typically used.|$|R
40|$|Laboratory {{tests were}} {{conducted}} on several types of steam traps at Holston Defense Corporation in Kingsport, Tennessee. Data from these tests, which determined their relative efficiencies, were used in performing economic analyses to determine their equivalent uniform annual cost (EUAC). The comparison was made using a computer program written for the Apple II computer to evaluate overall steam trap economics. This program calculates the EUAC for any steam trap based on 12 input variables including capital, maintenance and steam costs, interest rate and trap life. After determinIng the EUAC, the program will perform sensitivity analyses {{on any of the}} twelve variables. (This computer program is available from the author.) This study shows that <b>inverted</b> <b>bucket</b> traps have lower EUAC's under more conditions than other types of traps. Also, this study shows that live steam loss is the heaviest contributor to the annual operating cost of any steam trap and that maintenance frequency and repair cost are also more important than a trap's first cost...|$|R
40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} assess the referential function of chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) gestures to obtain food. The chimpanzees received 1 trial per condition. In Experiment 1 (N 101), {{in full view of}} the chimpanzee, a banana was placed on top of 1 of 2 <b>inverted</b> <b>buckets</b> or was hidden underneath 1 of the buckets. In Experiment 2 (N 35), 4 conditions were presented in constant order: (a) no food, no observer; (b) no food, observer present; (c) food present, no observer; and (d) food present, observer present. Gestures and visual orienting were used socially and referentially. The capacity for nonverbal reference may predate the Hominidae–Pongidae split, and the development of nonverbal reference may be independent of human species-specific adaptations for speech. Referential signaling has been historically viewed as being uniquely human (Werner & Kaplan, 1963). Referential signaling, as defined here, means the capacity to direct the attention of an observer to a distal object or entity. In linguistic reference, a symbol represents a concept, and through shared lexicons people can direct the attention of their conversational partners to these conceptual entities. Nonverbal reference, as the term is used i...|$|R
40|$|Suction pile anchors {{are large}} {{cylindrical}} (<b>inverted</b> <b>bucket</b> type structure) {{open at the}} bottom and closed at the top and largely used for mooring of offshore platforms, exploratory vessels etc. Prediction of the mooring capacity of suction piles is a critical issue faced by the design engineers and rational methods are required to produce reliable designs. Tests have been conducted in an existing natural pond within NIOT campus with the objective of developing methodology of deployment, design and logistics for suction pile installation and testing of mooring capacity under static pullout. Small size suction piles with varying diameters and lengths have been used in the tests. The tests have been carried out in the natural pond with constant water depth of 1. 5 m with the top 1. 5 m layer of bed comprising soft marine clay. It is found that pile geometry, aspect ratio and angle of pullout have a significant influence on the response to pullout. As angle of mooring load application changes from vertical to horizontal the reaction offered by the suction pile changes from skin friction to passive soil resistance. Resistance offered by the internal plug of soil is found to vary according to dimension of the anchor piles...|$|R
40|$|Offshore {{structures}} {{are used in}} a variety of applications ranging from the traditional oil and gas extraction facilities to emerging renewable energy concepts. These structures must be secured to the seabed in an efficient and cost effective manner. A novel approach is to use shallow <b>inverted</b> <b>buckets</b> as foundations, installed by suction, in place of the more usual piles. These foundations lead to cost savings through reduction in materials and in time required for installation. It is necessary to determine how these foundations perform under typical offshore loading conditions so that design calculations may be developed. This thesis presents experimental data from a comprehensive series of investigations aimed at determining the important mechanisms to consider in the design of these shallow foundations for dense sand. Initially the long term loading behaviour (e. g. wind and current) was investigated by conducting three degree of freedom loading {V:M/ 2 R:H} tests on a foundation embedded in dry sand. The results were interpreted through existing work-hardening plasticity theories. The analysis of the data has suggested a number of improved modelling features. Cyclic and transient tests, representing wave loading, were carried out on a foundation embedded in an oil saturated sand. The novel feature of the cyclic loading was that a 'pseudo-random' load history (based on the 'NewWave' theory) was used to represent realistic loading paths. Of particular interest was the tensile load capacity of the foundation. The results observed suggested that for tensile loading serviceability requirements rather than capacity may govern design. Under combined-load cyclic conditions the results indicated that conventional plasticity theory would not provide a sufficient description of response. A new theory, termed 'continuous hyperplasticity' was used, reproducing the results with impressive accuracy. Surprisingly, under the conditions investigated, loading rate was found to have a negligible effect on response...|$|R
