50|$|Meanwhile, <b>Brin</b> and Rone watched {{helplessly as}} Allanon {{was killed by}} an ancient Demon, a Jachyra, that had been summoned by the Mord Wraiths. The {{creature}} was destroyed, but Allanon, {{the last of the}} Druids, was mortally wounded and Rone is wounded when he attempts to aid Allanon with the Sword of Leah. The Jachyra throws the sword from the battle scene into a river. Before he died, Allanon marked Brin's line to succeed him. Rone and <b>Brin</b> pressed on, hopeless. They met Cogline, a partially insane old man who tamed a Moor Cat named Whisper, and his granddaughter, Kimber Boh, who was skilled in many techniques, and who helped them on their journey. First, Kimber Boh takes Rone and <b>Brin</b> to visit the Grimpond, an ancient being, much like the wraiths of Bremen and Allanon (but much more maligned. The spirit informs <b>Brin</b> (who spoke to the being alone) that the quest will claim her life and those traveling with her. After the meeting with the Grimpond; Cogline, Kimber Boh, and Whisper aid Rone and <b>Brin</b> in retrieving the Sword of Leah from a tribe of Spider Gnomes. After another long trek, <b>Brin</b> left the others while they were in the sewers of the castle and finally reached the Ildatch. <b>Brin</b> found herself unable to destroy it because first, she became entranced, and then she was possessed by it. The tome coveted her power and wanted to use her body as a tool to wield its destruction. At the last moment, as he had just purified the Silver River, Jair uses the Wishsong (the given ability from the King of the Silver River) to appear in the chamber where <b>Brin</b> is being subverted by the Ildatch appeared and found <b>Brin</b> almost deformed by her power and was horrified by her skeletal appearance she had assumed.

40|$|Despite much {{interest}} in the extraordinary mechanical properties of silks, the structure of native silk fibers is still not fully understood. In the present study, the morphology, topography, and organization of insect and spider cocoon silks were investigated using a range of imaging methods. Field emission scanning electron microscopy was used to observe transverse and longitude structures in silk fibers subjected to tensile fracturing, freeze fracturing, or polishing. In addition, ultrathin sections of silk <b>brins</b> embedded in resin were examined using transmission electron microscopy. Finally, dry silk <b>brins</b> were examined by confocal microscopy. The results confirmed the existence of well-oriented bundles of nanofibrils in all the silks examined and gave an indication of a hierarchical construction of the brin. Observed separation of the microfibrils in fractured <b>brins</b> suggests that the multifibrillar structure of the silk fiber contributes to toughness by allowing dissipation {{of energy in the}} controlled propagation of cracks...|$|E

40|$|An {{investigation}} is presented of the fracture surfaces {{of three different}} silks produced by two silkworms (Attacus atlas (A. atlas) and Bombyx mori (B. mori)) and one spider (Argiope trifasciata (A. trifasciata)). Tensile tests up to fiber failure were performed at a strain rate of 0. 0002 s 1, and the fracture surfaces of the broken fibers were analyzed through a scanning electron microscope. The nominal relative humidity during the tests was 60 % and the average temperature was 20 C. A. atlas silk was formed of bunches of microfibrils of 1 lm in diameter embedded in a soft matrix, which were pulled out from the matrix during fracture. B. mori fibers were made up of two <b>brins</b> of irregular shape embedded in a proteinaceous coating. Failure occurred by fracture of the <b>brins,</b> whose fracture surface presented a fine globular structure corresponding {{to the ends of}} the nanofibrils of 1 – 2 lm in length and 100 nm in diameter, which form the B. mori silk <b>brins</b> according to the analysis of the <b>brins</b> by atomic force microscopy. A. trifasciata fibers were circular and exhibited a defined core-skin structure. The skin fracture surface was featureless while the core showed a globular structure similar to that of B. mori although slightly shallower. The fractographic observations were discussed in the light of current knowledge of the microstructure of each fiber and the corresponding mechanical properties. 200...|$|E
40|$|A NTONELLI C. (2003) Knowledge {{complementarity}} and fungeability: {{implications for}} regional strategy, Reg. Studies 37, 595 - 606. Complexity and fungeability are two {{specific aspects of}} knowledge indivisibility. Complexity matters when the production of new knowledge requires the combination of diverse and yet complementary bits of knowledge. Fungeability is found when some units of knowledge can apply {{in a variety of}} different contexts, different products and different processes. Both knowledge complexity and knowledge fungeability are the cause of increasing returns in the generation of knowledge. The governance of the distribution of knowledge instead is affected by decreasing returns to the variety of elements of knowledge. Exchanges in the markets for knowledge are limited by transaction costs. Internalization of different bits of knowledge is constrained by coordination costs. Firms can take advantage of knowledge complexity and fungeability by means of networking in regional space. A NTONELLI C.
