Since 1989, over 500 bones discovered at the Upper Cretaceous Bellevue locality of southern France have <b>been</b> <b>assigned</b> <b>to</b> A. atacis. An abundant amount of well-preserved elements have been uncovered at Bellevue. In the original description, only a tooth and some vertebrae were examined.

All the material has <b>been</b> <b>assigned</b> <b>to</b> the species, and even though there are some differences in limb proportions, it has all been linked to individual variation.|$|E

3000|$|The {{first step}} in the test {{assembly}} is to determine the number of blocks and the assignment of items to those blocks. The function block_design facilitates this process with two required arguments and one optional argument. The n_blocks argument specifies the number of blocks while the item_parameters argument takes a data frame of item parameters. The default allocation of items to blocks is a spiraling design. For 1, 2, [...]..., H item blocks, the first item <b>is</b> <b>assigned</b> <b>to</b> block 1, item 2 <b>is</b> <b>assigned</b> <b>to</b> the block 2, and item H <b>is</b> <b>assigned</b> <b>to</b> block H.

5|$|P. gobiensis {{is named}} for the region it was found in 2001, and first {{described}} by Sereno, Zhao and Lin in 2010. It is known from a skull and partial articulated skeleton with gastroliths. Many other specimens either cannot be determined to belong to any particular species, or have not yet <b>been</b> <b>assigned</b> <b>to</b> one. These specimens are generally all referred to as Psittacosaurus sp., {{although it is not}} assumed that they belong to the same species. More than 200 specimens of Psittacosaurus have been found in the Yixian Formation, which is famous for its fossils of feathered dinosaurs.

Nearly 100 Psittacosaurus skeletons were excavated in Mongolia during the summers of 2005 and 2006 by a team led by Mongolian paleontologist Bolortsetseg Minjin and American Jack Horner from the Museum of the Rockies in Montana.
