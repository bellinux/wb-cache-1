5|$|Sedna's highly {{elliptical}} orbit means that the probability of its detection was roughly 1 in 80, which suggests that, unless its discovery was a fluke, another 40–120 Sedna-sized objects would exist within the same region. Another object, , has a similar but less extreme orbit: it has a perihelion of 44.3AU, an aphelion of 394 AU, and an orbital period of 3,240 years.

Presently, around 50,000 foreign and 500,000 domestic tourists visit Darjeeling each year, and its repute as the 'Queen of the Hills' remains unaltered. According to an India Today survey published on 23 December 2015, Darjeeling is the third most googled travel destination among all the tourist spots in India.|$|E
5|$|Colder weather, {{bringing}} with it rain and snow on September 11 calmed the fires down substantially throughout the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. Though the fires continued to burn {{well into the}} middle of November, they never again posed an immediate risk to life or property. Many fire crews were sent home, but additional manpower continued to arrive at Yellowstone to rehabilitate areas that had <b>been</b> <b>affected</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> firefighting efforts. Hundreds of miles of firelines, helicopter landing zones and fire camps needed to be restored to a more natural state, and thousands of hazardous dead trees needed to be cut down to protect roads and buildings. Finally, on November 18, all fires in Yellowstone were officially declared out.|$|E

5|$|Students in Malawi have {{expressed}} {{high levels of}} dissatisfaction regarding the HIV/AIDS-related education and support they receive at school. According to a survey of students in Malawi, most secondary students {{do not believe that}} the HIV/AIDS curricula at their schools provide them with an adequate understanding of the disease. Although the Malawian government and non-governmental organizations have conducted many campaigns to improve awareness about HIV/AIDS in schools, there is still a significant shortage of age-appropriate audio and visual educational materials relating to HIV/AIDS available to instructors, particularly in rural areas. In addition, most teachers cannot identify the students in their classes who have been personally affected by the epidemic, either through friends or relatives, which suggests that school-based support for HIV/AIDS is minimal. However, despite this lack of support, surveys indicate that children who have <b>been</b> <b>affected</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> epidemic do not usually experience HIV/AIDS-based discrimination at school.|$|E
5|$|The Lord Howe Island {{stick insect}} {{disappeared}} from the main island soon after the introduction of rats in 1918. In 2001 a tiny population was discovered in a single Melaleuca howeana shrub {{on the slopes of}} Ball's Pyramid, has been successfully bred in captivity, and is nearing re-introduction to the main island. The Lord Howe stag beetle is a colourful endemic beetle seen during summer months. Another endemic invertebrate, the Lord Howe flax snail (or Lord Howe Placostylus), has also <b>been</b> <b>affected</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> introduction of rats. Once common, the species is now endangered and a captive breeding program is under way to save the snail from extinction.|$|E

5|$|The healthy BMI range {{varies with}} the age and sex of the child. Obesity in {{children}} and adolescents is defined as a BMI greater than the 95thpercentile. The reference data that these percentiles are based on is from 1963 to 1994 and thus has not <b>been</b> <b>affected</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> recent increases in rates of obesity. Childhood obesity has reached epidemic proportions in the 21stcentury, with rising rates in both the developed and the developing world. Rates of obesity in Canadian boys have increased from 11% in the 1980s to over 30% in the 1990s, while during this same time period rates increased from 4 to 14% in Brazilian children.|$|E
5|$|The largest {{scale of}} {{ecological}} organization is the biosphere: the total sum of ecosystems on the planet. Ecological relationships regulate the flux of energy, nutrients, and climate {{all the way}} up to the planetary scale. For example, the dynamic history of the planetary atmosphere's CO2 and O2 composition has <b>been</b> <b>affected</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> biogenic flux of gases coming from respiration and photosynthesis, with levels fluctuating over time in relation to the ecology and evolution of plants and animals. Ecological theory has also been used to explain self-emergent regulatory phenomena at the planetary scale: for example, the Gaia hypothesis is an example of holism applied in ecological theory. The Gaia hypothesis states that there is an emergent feedback loop generated by the metabolism of living organisms that maintains the core temperature of the Earth and atmospheric conditions within a narrow self-regulating range of tolerance.|$|E
5|$|When Milk's friends {{looked in}} his closet for a suit for his casket, they learned how much he had <b>been</b> <b>affected</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> recent {{decrease}} in his income as a supervisor. All of his clothes were coming apart; all of his socks had holes. He was cremated and his ashes were split, most of them scattered in San Francisco Bay by his closest friends. Some of them were encapsulated and buried beneath {{the sidewalk in front}} of 575 Castro Street, where Castro Camera had been located. There is a memorial to Milk also at Neptune Society Columbarium, ground floor, San Francisco, California. Harry Britt, one of four people Milk listed on his tape as an acceptable replacement should he be assassinated, was chosen to fill that position by the city's acting mayor, Dianne Feinstein.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} field studies {{conducted}} in the boreal forest region of Northern Ontario (Canada) showed that A.sarcoides {{was found to be}} frequently associated with various deciduous and coniferous tree hosts that had <b>been</b> <b>affected</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> fungal disease known as heart rot; this discovery was noted as unusual, as most fungal tree infections are known to be caused by Basidiomycetes, not Ascomycetes. In the case of the commercially valuable tree species black spruce (Picea mariana), it was determined that prior colonization by A.sarcoides reduces the incidence of subsequent infection by common fungal pathogens, such as Fomes pini and Scytinostroma galactina; furthermore, A.sarcoides can exist in the wood with no noticeable harmful effects on the host. A similar relationship was shown later to exist with jack pine trees (species Pinus banksiana), whereby A.sarcoides inhibited Peniophora pseudopini, but had little effect on the subsequent growth of Fomes pini. The study also showed that A.sarcoides is isolated more frequently from defective wood as the age of the tree increases (trees examined in the study were over 80 years old), and that it can infect both uninfected heartwood as well as previously decayed wood; in the latter case it usually coexists with the causal fungi.|$|E
5|$|Late on October 14, while Gonzalo {{was still}} located about 700miles (1,130km) to the south, the Bermuda Weather Service issued a {{hurricane}} {{watch for the}} island. The watch was upgraded to a warning the next day. Having <b>been</b> <b>affected</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> unexpectedly destructive Hurricane Fay just days earlier, residents quickly began preparing for Gonzalo by obtaining emergency supplies and expediting cleanup efforts from the previous storm. Premier of Bermuda Michael Dunkley advised citizens to complete most preparations by the afternoon of October 16. Banks and businesses began closing that day, while schools and government offices were closed by October 17. One school functioned as a storm shelter, and 66people ultimately sought refuge there. Bus and ferry services were suspended {{on the evening of}} October 16. Bermuda's only daily newspaper, the Royal Gazette, did not go to print on October 17, but distributed the next day's edition for free. Bermuda Regiment soldiers were stationed at various points to support emergency response crews and ensure the safety of the public.|$|E
5|$|Oryzomys antillarum {{probably}} became extinct {{about the}} 1870s {{and is currently}} listed as such by the IUCN Red List. Its disappearance is usually attributed to the small Asian mongoose (Herpestes javanicus), which was introduced to Jamaica in 1872, and sometimes also to introduced Rattus species. Ray, on the other hand, argued that {{the significance of the}} mongoose had been overrated. Instead, he suggested that Oryzomys antillarum may have <b>been</b> <b>affected</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> massive environmental changes that occurred on the island after the British takeover in 1655. In that period, the bulk of the island came to be used for cultivation, so that the native habitat of Oryzomys was destroyed. Thus, Oryzomys was reduced to competition with introduced rats in man-made habitats, to which the latter are well adapted. Perhaps, Ray wrote, the black rat may {{not have been able to}} extirpate Oryzomys, but the brown rat, a later and more assertive invader, brought it to extinction. Cats and dogs preying on Oryzomys may also have contributed to its demise.|$|E
