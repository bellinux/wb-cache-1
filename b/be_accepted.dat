5|$|A {{long-term}} {{goal of the}} IFAF is for American football to <b>be</b> <b>accepted</b> by the International Olympic Committee as an Olympic sport. The only time that the sport was played was at the 1932 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, but as a demonstration sport. Among the various problems the IFAF has to solve in order to <b>be</b> <b>accepted</b> by the IOC are building a competitive women's division, expanding the sport into Africa, and overcoming the current worldwide competitive imbalance that {{is in favor of}} American teams.|$|E

5|$|Alignment {{with the}} Indonesian government, however, did not {{guarantee}} safety for the Torajans. In 1965, a presidential decree required every Indonesian citizen {{to belong to}} one of five officially recognised religions: Islam, Christianity (Protestantism and Catholicism), Hinduism, or Buddhism. The Torajan religious belief (aluk) was not legally recognised, and the Torajans raised their voices against the law. To make aluk accord with the law, it had to <b>be</b> <b>accepted</b> as {{part of one of}} the official religions. In 1969, Aluk To Dolo ("the way of ancestors") was legalised as a sect of Agama Hindu Dharma, the official name of Hinduism in Indonesia.|$|E

50|$|Concluding {{the series}} {{in a similar}} fashion to the original, all {{characters}} go their separate ways into college. Eric <b>is</b> <b>accepted</b> into the Chicago School of the Arts to pursue his singing career and Liz <b>is</b> <b>accepted</b> into Stanford to pursue her Olympic aspirations (both constant themes throughout the series). Maria <b>is</b> <b>accepted</b> into UCLA and Tony <b>is</b> <b>accepted</b> into SDSU, prompting the two to end their relationship. Katie <b>is</b> <b>accepted</b> into Columbia, but is unable to go due to financial troubles. She instead plans to head for an unnamed Cal State University. Thus the series ends with Katie and Nicky's future in relative uncertainty, as he <b>is</b> <b>accepted</b> into NYU.

5|$|Common {{and often}} basic {{ingredients}} in many modern European cuisines like potatoes, kidney beans, cacao, vanilla, tomatoes, chili peppers and maize {{were not available}} to Europeans until after 1492, after European contact with the Americas, and even then it often took considerable time, sometimes several centuries, for the new foodstuffs to <b>be</b> <b>accepted</b> by society at large.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{his success}} as a producer, West's true {{aspiration}} {{was to be a}} rapper. Though he had developed his rapping long before he began producing, it was often a challenge for West to <b>be</b> <b>accepted</b> as a rapper, and he struggled to attain a record deal. Multiple record companies ignored him because he did not portray the 'gangsta image' prominent in mainstream hip hop at the time. After a series of meetings with Capitol Records, West was ultimately denied an artist deal.|$|E

Sherley was a millionaire who published his own books. The literary community had dismissed his work, but Riley was instrumental in helping him to <b>be</b> <b>accepted.</b>|$|E
5|$|Early {{speech or}} {{behavioral}} interventions can help {{children with autism}} gain self-care, social, and communication skills. Although there is no known cure, there have been reported cases of children who recovered. Not many children with autism live independently after reaching adulthood, though some become successful.

5|$|For {{artifacts}} {{such as the}} Sky Disc of Nebra, {{alleged to}} be a Bronze Age artefact depicting the cosmos, the analysis {{would be similar to}} typical post-excavation analysis as used in other sub-disciplines in archaeology.

5|$|In 1994, Mikhailov {{suggested}} that Macroolithus represented the eggs {{of a large}} theropod, specifically Tarbosaurus, based on the large size of the eggs and the largely overlapping distribution. However, the discovery of an oviraptorid embryo inside an elongatoolithid egg cast doubt on this hypothesis. With the discovery of multiple oviraptorosaur-elongatoolithid associations in the late 1990s, the eggs of elongatoolithids came to <b>be</b> <b>accepted</b> as belonging to oviraptorosaurian dinosaurs. Oviraptorid parentage was confirmed for Macroolithus when, in 2008, oviraptorid embryos resembling Heyuannia were discovered inside a pair of M. yaotunensis eggs in Jiangxi.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} supply U.S. allies, much more {{production}} was required than was possible through the firms producing the M2 (and the larger M3 Half-track). International Harvester (IH) could produce half-tracks, but some differences had to <b>be</b> <b>accepted</b> due to different manufacturing methods and components. This led to IH producing for lend-lease the M5 Half-track and M9 as equivalents for the M3 and M2 respectively.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s, {{the journal}} shifted towards a {{preference}} for quantitative model building including econometric models and time series models, and accepted more articles by non-accountants who contributed ideas from other disciplines in solving accounting-related problems.

5|$|In {{the early}} 19th century, America {{produced}} diverse composers such as Anthony Heinrich, who composed in an idiosyncratic, intentionally American style {{and was the}} first American composer to write for a symphony orchestra.

It was John Knowles Paine, however, who became the first American composer to <b>be</b> <b>accepted</b> in Europe.
