40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the relation between industrial concentration and technical inefficiency in the Indonesian food and <b>beverages</b> <b>industry</b> using a dynamic performance measure (dynamic technical inefficiency) that accounts for the presence of adjustment costs. Design/methodology/approach: This research uses panel data of 44 subsectors in the Indonesian food and <b>beverages</b> <b>industry</b> for the period 1980 - 2014. The dynamic input directional distance function is applied to estimate the dynamic technical inefficiency. Further, the Granger causality between industrial concentration and dynamic technical inefficiency is tested using a dynamic panel data model. A bootstrap truncated regression model is finally applied to estimate the relation between industrial concentration and dynamic technical inefficiency based on the results from the Granger causality test. Findings: The results show that the Indonesian food and <b>beverages</b> <b>industry</b> has a high dynamic technical inefficiency. Investigation of the causality of the relation shows that industrial concentration has a positive effect on dynamic technical inefficiency at the subsector level, with no reversed causality. The results suggest that the quiet life hypothesis applies to the Indonesian food and <b>beverages</b> <b>industry.</b> Originality/value: The literature investigating the relation between industrial concentration and performance relies on static measures of performance, such as technical efficiency. Static measures provide an incorrect metric of the firms’ performance in the presence of adjustment costs associated with investment. Therefore, this research has a contribution in measuring dynamic technical inefficiency that accounts for the presence of the adjustment cost as well as its relation with industrial concentration in the Indonesian food and <b>beverages</b> <b>industry...</b>|$|R

2500|$|BevMo! employs Wilfred Wong, {{an expert}} taster and wine {{competition}} judge, who assigns bottles a wine rating {{based on his}} own version of Robert M. Parker, Jr.'s 50–100-point system. Wong, a veteran industry analyst and wine writer who has written regular columns for Vineyard & Winery Management magazine and <b>Beverage</b> <b>Industry</b> News, tastes some 8,000 bottles a year for BevMo!, and may taste 40 wines a day. A San Francisco native and resident who grew up working in his family's upscale grocery store in the Haight-Ashbury neighborhood, Wong was hired to work for BevMo! in 1995, when they had six stores. He told a New York Times reporter in 2006 that it can be tricky working as a wine critic inside a large retail chain that sells wine—there can be conflicts between appropriate scoring for a wine and business plans for that wine. He reported that he has, upon occasion, been encouraged by company management to give a high score to a wine, especially one that did not receive a high rating from other reviewers, or one that was purchased by BevMo! at a good price. Wong said, [...] "we have fights all the time." [...] Wong made assurances that he does not treat a wine to a good score based on company founders' wishes. Executive VP David Richards agrees: [...] "If we were to impinge on Wilfred's credibility, it would be very bad for our brand." [...] Wong reports only to Richards, to keep him from being influenced by wine sellers or BevMo!'s own buyers. Richards said, [...] "we have to give him independence within the organization." [...] Alder Yarrow, publisher of the wine blog Vinography.com, said of Wong, [...] "he is not a shill... He knows what he is talking about when it comes to wine." [...] Professor Emeritus Robert Smiley, Director of Wine Studies, Graduate School of Management, University of California, Davis, said about Wong's ratings: [...] "I {{think this is a good}} innovation and he's helpful to the consumer. It brings more people to BevMo and it probably moves them up in price because typically, the higher-price wines get the better scores." [...] Smiley said that shoppers were too smart to be fooled: [...] "If Wilfred and BevMo fix the ratings, people will catch on and go elsewhere." ...|$|E
