40|$|Abstract. A {{method of}} {{decomposition}} for tungsten residue using concentrated <b>hydrochloric</b> <b>acid</b> by reflux is presented. The <b>hydrochloric</b> <b>acid</b> concentration, <b>hydrochloric</b> <b>acid</b> consumption and reflux time were investigated. The decomposition of tungsten residue using concentrated <b>hydrochloric</b> <b>acid</b> by reflux {{was compared to}} non-reflux. The {{results show that the}} reflux method is significantly better than the non-reflux method. The optimum decomposition conditions for tungsten residue are that the <b>hydrochloric</b> <b>acid</b> consumption is at 38. 55 mmol/g and the mixture of concentrated <b>hydrochloric</b> <b>acid</b> and tungsten residue are heated to reflux under stirring for 4 h. The decomposition ratio is Fe 98. 88 %...|$|R

40|$|AIM: To {{determine}} {{the effect of}} dilute <b>hydrochloric</b> <b>acid</b> on the in situ end labelling (ISEL) reaction, with and without a variety of different proteolytic enzymes. METHODS: Sections of tissue fixed in buffered formalin were pretreated with trypsin, protease XIV (at two different concentrations), or protease XXIV (for two different incubation times), with and without subsequent 1 M <b>hydrochloric</b> <b>acid</b> treatment. The results were compared with those obtained using <b>hydrochloric</b> <b>acid</b> alone, with proteinase K, and pepsin pretreatment, and with no pretreatment. RESULTS: When <b>hydrochloric</b> <b>acid</b> was added to the sections in addition to trypsin, protease XIV, and protease XXIV, there was a significant increase in ISEL reactivity in both apoptotic nuclei and morphologically normal nuclei. <b>Hydrochloric</b> <b>acid</b> alone had no significant effect.
