Below a review on recent progresses in diagnosis and treatment of PIDs is given. Reducing the regrettable delay in diagnosis of PIDs (worldwide) is possible only when awareness is increased by doctors who may encounter patients with PID. This review shall serve this purpose. Progresses in understanding what the link might be between one genetic defect presenting in various phenotypes or how various gene defects may manifest by very similar PID phenotypes helps building awareness. Knowledge of PID favours early diagnosis, a cornerstone of optimal, sometimes life-long care at justifiable costs.

40|$|Abstract- The {{clinical}} record {{is a primary}} support for the <b>diagnostic</b> process <b>performed</b> <b>by</b> physicians. The development of a Clinical Record Management System can significantly {{improve the quality of}} patient care by properly supporting the physicians' tasks and, in particular, the diagnostic process. In this paper we address some key issues in designing a medical decision support system. Acquisition of medical knowledge is supported by a knowledge editor based on a conceptual model of diseases, aetiologies, evidence and their relationships. Diagnostic support is carried out by an algorithm which, according to the production rules generated by the knowledge editor and to the patient's clinical data, formulates a set of diagnostic hypotheses and suggests tests and examinations for their validation. The definition of an internal model for the {{clinical record}} allows for clinical data from different departments to be integrated. On the other hand, the definition of external models allows for custom presentations of clinical data to be created. 1...|$|R

Data was derived from electronic medical records of 70 general practices for the period 2006 until 2010. For the total patient population (N= 651, 089 patient years) and specific patients groups for whom specific services were performed mostly (28 groups; 10 services), logistic multilevel regression analyses were conducted to determine associations between the number of services performed in a practice and referrals to medical specialists. The total number of services performed in a practice was not associated with the referral rate (OR: 1. 00). Only for two specific services was a significant association found: a lower referral rate for minor surgery for patient with sebaceous cysts (OR: 0. 98) and a higher rate for Doppler diagnostic tests for patients with other peripheral arterial diseases (OR: 1. 04). As the number of services in general practice was rarely associated with referrals, other measures might be more effective in changing referral behaviour.
