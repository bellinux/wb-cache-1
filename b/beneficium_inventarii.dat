50|$|<b>Beneficium</b> <b>inventarii</b> (literally {{benefit of}} the inventory) is a legal {{doctrine}} introduced into Roman law by Justinian I to limit the liability of heirs resulting from an insolvent estate.|$|E
50|$|The doctrine, {{which is}} in force today in many civil law systems, applies to both wills and {{intestate}} successions. An heir may accept a succession under <b>beneficium</b> <b>inventarii</b> without being liable for the debts attaching to the estate or to the claims of legatees beyond the estate's value as previously determined by inventory.|$|E
50|$|Certain persons, {{especially}} soldiers, were privileged from {{observing the}} ordinary forms. The liability of {{the heir to}} the debts of the testator varied during different periods. At first it was practically unlimited. The law was then gradually modified in favour of the heir, until in the time of Justinian the heir who duly made an inventory of the property of the deceased was liable only for the assets to which he had succeeded. This limitation of liability is generally termed by the civilians <b>beneficium</b> <b>inventarii.</b>|$|E
