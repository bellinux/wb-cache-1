500|$|The anime {{adaptation}} of Eyeshield 21 received positive and mixed responses. Bobby Cooper from DVD Talk praised how {{the rules of}} American football are [...] "explained to a foreign audience that has no clue what it's all about", adding that instructions at the commercial breaks [...] "were informative and similar to the Go lessons of Hikaru No Go." [...] He also said the explanations was [...] "hilarious", but that [...] "Eyeshield 21 is an excellent introduction to football". The on-field action was also praised, with he saying the sports action is [...] "where Eyeshield 21 truly shines", although he criticized the scenes away from the football field, [...] "the pacing slows to a crawl and the storyline gets a little boring". In her review, Erin Finnegan from Anime News Network stated, [...] "he pace of Eyeshield 21 is its saving grace. It's way less boring than all the time outs and commercial breaks in a regular NFL game. Football is hard to understand, but Eyeshield 21 explains the Byzantine rules...in an entertaining way. We're never left waiting for the ref's decision for long minutes like in real life. A lot of dramatic tension carries the action between plays." [...] Finnegan also criticized the artwork, saying, [...] "any episode [...] without a game is clearly farmed out to an inferior animation studio". Chris Beveridge from Mania Entertainment wrote that Eyeshield 21 [...] "has a good solid story idea, showing a young man finding his way through sports by finding friends and realizing he has potential, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> sidelined so often that it's frustrating to see it deal with situations as it does." ...|$|E
500|$|After the UK release, Dickon Stainer, head of Universal Classics and Jazz, {{spoke of}} plans to {{publicise}} Faryl in the US, saying [...] "America {{is going to}} be key. Because of her history on the talent show there's already a great deal of interest in her. The demand is intense." [...] In April 2009, Smith travelled to Los Angeles to begin her promotion of Faryl in the US. She appeared on The Ellen DeGeneres Show in early May as part of her promotional tour. Faryl was released in the US on 5 May. Smith said before the release that she did not expect it to sell as well {{as it did in the}} UK. She said that [...] "in the US it's a lot harder because I'm not as well-known. In the UK, a lot of people obviously watched 'Britain's Got Talent' and stuff, and that was like fresh in everyone's minds." [...] After the release, she was more optimistic, saying [...] "hen I performed in New York, it reminded me of the HMV signing in Kettering and there was quite a big queue so I think my album was well received." [...] Smith returned from the US in early May. Despite the contrary being said when she performed on the third series of Britain's Got Talent, Smith had no plans for a concert tour in 2009; she was quoted as saying that [...] "I'm too young and don't think I would be able to do a tour on my own". However, she did plan to return to the US during her summer holidays to again promote Faryl. She said that [...] "everyone in America was really nice and they do like classical music, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> difficult to make it over there ... They seem to like their own singers, but I will just keep trying my best". However, she instead took a short break from her music career in summer, before returning to the recording studio later in the year for Wonderland, her second album, which was released in November.|$|E

2500|$|... on a {{life and}} death so full of heart-going realities as poor Chatterton's, to find such shadowy nobodies as cherub-winged Death, Trees of Hope, bare-bosomed Affection and simpering Peace, makes one's blood {{circulate}} like ipecacuanha. <b>But</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>so.</b> A young man by strong feelings is impelled to write on a particular subject, {{and this is all}} his feelings do for him. They set him upon the business and then they leave him. he has such a high idea of what poetry ought to be, that he cannot conceive that such things as natural emotions may be allowed to find a place in it; his learning therefore, his fancy, or rather conceit, and all his powers of buckram are put on the stretch.|$|E
2500|$|... n {{spite of}} an {{avalanche}} of verbal filth (and a smaller quantum of the visual variety), Zack and Miri is not very shocking at all. He and his characters revel in dialogue that riffs on body parts and bodily fluids, but Mr. Smith's stories are bathed [...] metaphorically! [...] in syrup and schmaltz. So Zack and Miri Make a Porno, {{in spite of its}} sometimes tiresome, sometimes amusing lewdness, follows a gee-whiz romantic-comedy formula that would not be out of place on the Disney Channel. Two best friends who have always been in love with each other discover that ... they have always been in love with each other. Granted, this revelation occurs while they are having sex in front of a camera, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> sweet and predictable that these potentially tawdry circumstances hardly matter.|$|E
2500|$|When {{the case}} was resolved, control of the Legacy of Kain {{trademark}} belonged to Crystal Dynamics, and Kain II was either canceled or superseded when Shifter became Soul Reaver. Though Crystal Dynamics staff who worked on Soul Reaver {{declined to comment on}} the discovery, Dyack had previously affirmed that [...] " [...] tried to take it over". He said that [...] "many people ask us if we like the direction they have gone in <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> alien to what we created it is pointless to answer now. We understand that some people love the Soul Reaver series and we think that is great. However, it is not what we would ever have done". In a 2008 interview, he elaborated his sentiment that [...] "if you look at Legacy of Kain where it is right now -- so diluted, so dysfunctional -- as a property itself, it's pretty much gone in a completely different direction than we would have ever taken it. [...] Even if the developer's good, and I think Crystal Dynamics is not a bad developer, you get this dilution of the content, because the original author is gone".|$|E

2500|$|On Rotten Tomatoes, {{a review}} {{aggregator}} that collects both contemporary and modern reviews, {{the film has}} an 82% approval rating based on 38 reviews; the average rating is 6.9/10. [...] The site's consensus reads: [...] "Brimming with energy and packed with humor, Big Trouble in Little China distills kung fu B-movies as affectionately as it subverts them." [...] Ron Base, in his review for the Toronto Star, praised Russell's performance. [...] "He does a great John Wayne imitation. But he's not just mimicking these heroes, he is using them to give his own character a broad, satiric edge." [...] Walter Goodman in The New York Times wrote, [...] "In kidding the flavorsome proceedings even as he gets the juice out of them, the director, John Carpenter, is conspicuously with it." [...] Writer Harlan Ellison, widely known in Hollywood for his brutally honest critiques, praised the film, writing that it had [...] "some of the funniest lines spoken by any actor this year to produce a cheerfully blathering live-action cartoon {{that will give you}} release from the real pressures of your basically dreary lives." [...] In his review for Time, Richard Corliss wrote, [...] "Little China offers dollops of entertainment, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> stocked with canny references to other pictures that it suggests a master's thesis that moves." ...|$|E
