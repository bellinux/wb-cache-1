25|$|In programming, {{especially}} old DOS-style BASIC, Pascal and C, Break is used (in {{conjunction with}} Ctrl) to stop program execution. In addition to this, Linux and variants, {{as well as}} many DOS programs, treat this combination the same as Ctrl+C. On modern keyboards, the <b>break</b> <b>key</b> is usually labeled Pause/Break. In most Windows environments, the key combination Windows key+Pause brings up the system properties.|$|E
25|$|Throughout many {{communities}} in the grassfields of Cameroon (much of the present-day Northewest Region), there are longstanding practices of women gathering together as moral guardians {{of the community and}} in shaming individuals who <b>break</b> <b>key</b> rules. In addition women provide key ceremonial functions in many of the rural communities throughout the region: namely in protecting agricultural fertility. The moral guardianship gatherings would often use outlandish behavior in the ostracizing of individuals in order to highlight the severity of the offense and to prevent other people from intervening in the punishment. The practices differed in the various communities and are called fombuen or keluh in Kedjom Keku communities, anlu in Kom communities, and ndofoumbgui in the Aghem tribe.|$|E
25|$|The five-needle telegraph, {{which was}} mainly, if not entirely, due to Wheatstone, {{was similar to}} that of Schilling, and based on the {{principle}} enunciated by André-Marie Ampère – that is to say, the current was sent into the line by completing the circuit of the battery with a make and <b>break</b> <b>key,</b> and at the other end it passed through a coil of wire surrounding a magnetic needle free to turn round its centre. According as one pole of the battery or the other was applied to the line by means of the key, the current deflected the needle to one side or the other. There were five separate circuits actuating five different needles. The latter were pivoted in rows across the middle of a dial shaped like a diamond, and having the letters of the alphabet arranged upon {{it in such a way}} that a letter was literally pointed out by the current deflecting two of the needles towards it.|$|E
40|$|We have {{investigated}} the linear cryptanalysis of AES cipher in this article. As the previous encryption standard DES could be broken by the linear cryptanalysis, NIST decided a new encryption standard AES in 2000. We try to analyze one and two rounds AES cipher by the method of the linear cryptanalysis and learn the limits of this mehtod. AES cipher provides a conspicuous difficulty in <b>breaking</b> its <b>keys</b> because of small bias of its S-box. We report the experimental results of success rate and are led to conclusion that this method would not work well on more than 3 rounds to <b>break</b> <b>keys...</b>|$|R
40|$|Genetic {{algorithm}} based Cryptanalysis {{has gained}} considerable attention {{due to its}} fast convergence time. This paper proposes a Genetic Algorithm (GA) based cryptanalysis scheme for <b>breaking</b> the <b>key</b> employed in Simplified- AES. Our proposed GA allows us to <b>break</b> the <b>key</b> using a Known Plaintext attack requiring a lower number of Plaintext-Ciphertext pairs compared to existing solutions. Moreover, our approach allows us to <b>break</b> the S-AES <b>key</b> using also a Ciphertext-only attack. As far as we are concerned, {{it is the first}} time that GAs are used to perform this kind of attack on S-AES. Experimental results prove that our proposed fitness function along with GA have drastically reduced the search space by a factor of 10 in case of Known plain text and 1. 8 in case of Ciphertext only attack...|$|R
30|$|As dNBR values increased, or as burn {{severity}} increased, charred inorganic cover {{increased and}} uncharred organic cover decreased {{on both the}} Simi and Old fires (Table 1). The sparse vegetation conditions are represented by 30 % to 40 % organic ground cover on the lowest burn severity plots after both fires. On the plots burned at the highest severity, total organic ground cover was 12 % on the Simi fire and 7 % on the Old fire. According to widely applied dNBR classification <b>breaks</b> (<b>Key</b> and Benson 2006), none of our plots on the Simi fire were classified as high burn severity.|$|R

The Break key/Pause key no longer has a well-defined purpose. Its origins go back to teleprinter users, who wanted a key that would temporarily interrupt the communications line.

Part way through this run, Chairman Maurice Lindsay decided to retire from the sport, due to ill health and was replaced days later by Peter Ridsdale. Preston continued to struggle in both performance and results and on 14 December, the management duo of Phil Brown and Brian Horton left the club. Then began a four-week search for the next manager, in which time David Unsworth and Graham Alexander were care-taker managers, who had improved on Phil Brown's legacy by losing only one game and winning at home for the first time since September 2011. The search began drawing to a conclusion, when the Stevenage manager Graham Westley was approached. After four days of tense negotiation, he was appointed manager on Friday 13 January 2012.|$|E
