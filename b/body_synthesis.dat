Current recommendations for therapy for metabolic syndrome focus on corrections of the individual components. Fibrates are used to treat hyperlipidemia as a predisposing factorto metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease.

40|$|SummaryUpon infection, Mycobacterium {{tuberculosis}} (Mtb) metabolically {{alters the}} macrophage {{to create a}} niche that is ideally suited to its persistent lifestyle. Infected macrophages acquire a “foamy” phenotype characterized by the accumulation of lipid bodies (LBs), which serve as both a source of nutrients and a secure niche for the bacterium. While the functional significance of the foamy phenotype is appreciated, the biochemical pathways mediating this process are understudied. We found that Mtb induces the foamy phenotype via targeted manipulation of host cellular metabolism to divert the glycolytic pathway toward ketone <b>body</b> <b>synthesis.</b> This dysregulation enabled feedback activation of the anti-lipolytic G protein-coupled receptor GPR 109 A, leading to perturbations in lipid homeostasis and consequent accumulation of LBs in the macrophage. ESAT- 6, a secreted Mtb virulence factor, mediates the enforcement of this feedback loop. Finally, we demonstrate that pharmacological targeting of pathways mediating this host-pathogen metabolic crosstalk provides a potential strategy for developing tuberculosis chemotherapy...|$|E

In contrast, insulin deficiency {{does not}} change, or, paradoxically, increases estimates of whole <b>body</b> protein <b>synthesis</b> in humans. To determine if such estimates of whole <b>body</b> protein <b>synthesis</b> could obscure potential differential effects of insulin on the synthetic rates of individual proteins, we determined whole <b>body</b> protein <b>synthesis</b> and albumin and fibrinogen fractional synthetic rates using 5 -h simultaneous infusions of [14 C]leucine and [13 C]bicarbonate, in six type 1 diabetics during a continuous i. v. insulin infusion (to maintain euglycemia) and after short-term insulin withdrawal (12 +/- 2 h). Insulin withdrawal increased (P less than 0. 03) whole body proteolysis by approximately 35 % and leucine oxidation by approximately 100 %, {{but did not}} change 13 CO 2 recovery from NaH 13 CO 3 or estimates of whole <b>body</b> protein <b>synthesis</b> (P = 0. 21). Insulin deficiency {{was associated with a}} 29 % decrease (P less than 0. 03) in the albumin fractional synthetic rate but a 50 % increase (P less than 0. 03) in that of fibrinogen. These data provide strong evidence that albumin synthesis in humans is an insulin-sensitive process, a conclusion consistent with observations in rats. The increase in fibrinogen synthesis during insulin deficiency most likely reflects an acute phase protein response due to metabolic stress. These data suggest that the absence of changes in whole <b>body</b> protein <b>synthesis</b> after insulin withdrawal {{is the result of the}} summation of differential effects of insulin deficiency on the <b>synthesis</b> of specific <b>body</b> proteins...|$|R
40|$|To {{examine the}} rates of whole <b>body</b> protein <b>synthesis</b> and energy {{expenditure}} during the rapid growing period, premature infants of very low birth weight (VLBW) (less than 1500 g), appropriate for gestational age were kept under standard thermoneutrality conditions and received a formula diet providing 110 kcal/kg. d metabolisable energy (ME) and 3. 3 g protein/kg. d. Their energy expenditure was measured by open circuit indirect calorimetry. Nitrogen turnover and whole <b>body</b> protein <b>synthesis</b> and catabolism were determined using repeated oral administration of 15 N-glycine for 60 - 72 h followed by the analysis of 15 N-enrichment in urinary urea. These VLBW infants grew at an average rate of 15 g/kg. d. About half of the ME intake (i. e. 50 kcal/kg. d) was invested in weight gain while the remainder (i. e. 60 kcal/kg. d) was oxidised. The energy equivalent of the weight gain (i. e. {{the amount of energy}} stored per g weight gain) and the N balance indicated that lean tissue made up approximately 2 / 3 of the weight gained and fat tissue the remaining 1 / 3. The plateau value for 15 N enrichment reached on the third day of administration allowed us to calculate a rate of protein synthesis of 14 g/kg. d and protein breakdown of 12 g/kg. d in five VLBW fed a formula diet. The elevated energy expenditure of the very low birth weight infant seems to be related to its rapid rate of weight gain which is accompanied by a high rate of <b>body</b> protein <b>synthesis.</b> More than 20 % of the total energy expenditure of the VLBW infants was accounted for by whole <b>body</b> protein <b>synthesis...</b>|$|R

40|$|AbstractDairy {{ruminants}} {{experiencing a}} severe postpartum negative energy balance (NEB) {{are considered to}} be more susceptible to mastitis. Although the genetic variability of mastitis resistance is well established, the biological basis of the link between energy metabolism and resistance is mostly unknown. The aim {{of this study was to}} characterize the effect of NEB on metabolism and immune response according to the genetic background for mastitis resistance or susceptibility. Forty-eight ewes from high and low somatic cell score (SCS) genetic lines were allocated to 2 homogeneous subgroups 2 wk after lambing: one group (NEB) received an energy-restricted diet to cover 60 % of their energy requirements, and the other group received a control (positive energy balance: PEB) diet. Both diets met the protein requirements. After 10 d on either the NEB or PEB diet, all ewes were injected with a Pam 3 CSK 4 /MDP solution in one half-udder to induce an inflammatory response. The ewes were monitored for milk production, somatic cell count (SCC), body weight (BW), body condition score (BCS), and blood metabolites. Differential milk cell counts were determined by flow cytometry. Plasma concentrations of glucose, insulin, nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA), β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), and triiodothyronine were determined. Energy restriction resulted in an increased fat:protein ratio in milk and decreased milk yield, BW, and BCS. The NEB ewes had significantly higher NEFA and BHB and lower plasma glucose concentrations than PEB ewes, reflecting a mobilization of body reserves and ketone <b>body</b> <b>synthesis.</b> High-SCS ewes had a higher SCS than low-SCS throughout the experiment, except after the inflammatory challenge, which resulted in similar SCS in all 4 groups. A noteworthy interaction between genetic background and diet was evidenced on metabolic parameters and BW. Indeed, high-SCS ewes subjected to NEB showed greater decrease in BW and increased NEFA and BHB concentrations compared with low-SCS ewes. Thus, NEB in early lactation led to extensive mobilization of body reserves and intense ketone <b>body</b> <b>synthesis</b> in mastitis-susceptible sheep. These results reinforce the hypothesis of a genetic association between mastitis susceptibility and energy metabolism and open the way to further studies on the biological basis for this association...|$|E

In the postabsorptive state, whole <b>body</b> protein <b>synthesis</b> (expressed as mg. kg(- 1). min(- 1)) was similar between Leu and Phe-Tyr tracers irrespective of the precursor pool used. After the meal, Leu Ox, Phe Hy, and <b>body</b> protein <b>synthesis</b> increased (P < or = 0. 01 vs. basal). With the use of intracellular precursor pools, the increase of protein synthesis with Phe-Tyr (+ 0. 51 +/- 0. 21 mg. kg(- 1). min(- 1)) and Leu tracers (+ 0. 57 +/- 0. 14) were similar (P = not significant). In contrast, with plasma pools the increase of protein synthesis was more than twofold greater with Phe-Tyr (+ 1. 17 +/- 0. 19 mg. kg(- 1). min(- 1)) than that with Leu (0. 50 +/- 0. 13 mg. kg(- 1). min(- 1), P < 0. 01).

The role of acyl-CoAs in the pathophysiology of these disorders is poorly understood, in part because CoA esters are intracellular and samples are not generally available from human patients. We created a mouse model of one such condition, deficiency of 3 -hydroxy- 3 -methylglutaryl-CoA lyase (HL), in liver (HLLKO mice). HL catalyses a reaction of ketone <b>body</b> <b>synthesis</b> and of leucine degradation. Chronic HL deficiency and acute crises each produced distinct abnormal liver acyl-CoA patterns, which would not be predictable from levels of urine organic acids and plasma acylcarnitines. In HLLKO hepatocytes, ketogenesis was undetectable. Carboxylation of [2 - 14 C] pyruvate diminished following incubation of HLLKO hepatocytes with the leucine metabolite 2 -ketoisocaproate (KIC). HLLKO mice also had suppression of the normal hyperglycemic response to a systemic pyruvate load, a measure of gluconeogenesis. Hyperammonemia and hypoglycemia, cardinal features of many inborn errors of acyl-CoA metabolism, occurred spontaneously in some HLLKO mice and were inducible by administering KIC.

Functional properties of kombucha related to metabolite that has been produced glucoronic, catechin, epicatechin and niacin that {{have been reported to}} possess various biological activities. Eighty laying quails were used in the study to determine the egg fat and meat fat level in quails. Research using Randomized Block Design (RBD) with five treatments of Kombucha tea (0, 10, 15, 20 and 25 %), and four replications. All treatments would be tested for the ability to decline the level of egg fat and meat fat, and the eggs was collected every week (0, 1, 2, 3, 4 weeks). The results clearly demonstrated that the laying quails meat fat, that have been consumed with the ration contain 20 % kombucha tea for 3 weeks, has significantly (P< 0. 05) effect;and also decreased themeat fat compared to control, andby using kombucha tea for 3 or 4 weeks has no significantly (P< 0. 05) decreased egg fats. but egg fats has a tendency to decline compare to control. It can be concluded that Kombucha tea could be decreases the <b>body’s</b> <b>synthesis</b> of lipid in general include egg fats and meat fats...|$|R
40|$|Abstract 3 -D {{face and}} body model has been {{successfully}} explored in the computer graphics. computer vision and model-based image coding communities. This paper developed a virtual human face and hody generation technique that synthesize virtual human face and hody of arbitrary views. Realistic human Faces synthesis {{plays an important role}} in animating virtual human behaviors. Therefore, this paper will focus on the realistic virtual face synthesis methods. The virtual human <b>body</b> <b>synthesis</b> method will follow the same mechanism as face dose. As we know. faces are characteri~ed by their shapes and their textures. By using a frontal and profile images of a specific subject, a deformation technique allows interactive alignment of features in the 3 -D general graphic face model with the features of the pre-provided images of the specific subject. The deformation result is a 3 -D face model of the specific human face. It precisely reflects the correspondence geometric features of the specific subject. After that. subdivision spline surface construction and multi-direction texture mapping techniques are presented which endow the photometric information to the specific 3 -D geometric face model. Therefore, we could get the synthesized virtual faces with geometric and texture features of the specific subject. 1...|$|E
40|$|In this work, untargeted NMR {{metabonomics}} {{was employed}} to evaluate the effects of pregnancy on the metabolite composition of maternal urine, thus establishing a control excretory trajectory for healthy pregnancies. Urine was collected for independent groups of healthy nonpregnant and pregnant women (in first, second, third trimesters) and multivariate analysis performed on the corresponding NMR spectra. Models were validated through Monte Carlo Cross Validation and permutation tests and metabolite correlations measured through Statistical Total Correlation Spectroscopy. The levels of 21 metabolites were found to change significantly throughout pregnancy, with variations observed {{for the first time}} to our knowledge for choline, creatinine, 4 -deoxyerythronic acid, 4 -deoxythreonic acid, furoylglycine, guanidoacetate, 3 -hydroxybutyrate, and lactate. Results confirmed increased aminoaciduria across pregnancy and suggested (a) a particular involvement of isoleucine and threonine in lipid oxidation/ketone <b>body</b> <b>synthesis,</b> (b) a relation of excreted choline, taurine, and guanidoacetate to methionine metabolism and urea cycle regulation, and (c) a possible relationship of furoylglycine and creatinine to pregnancy, based on a tandem study of nonfasting confounding effects. Results demonstrate the usefulness of untargeted metabonomics in finding biomarker metabolic signatures for healthy pregnancies, against which disease-related deviations may be confronted in future studies, as a base for improved diagnostics and prediction...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} study we {{identify}} inosine- 52 ̆ 7 monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH), a key enzyme in de novo guanine nucleotide biosynthesis, as a novel lipid body-associated protein. To identify new targets of insulin we performed a comprehensive 2 -DE analysis of P- 32 -labelled proteins isolated from 3 T 3 -L 1 adipocytes (Hill et al. J Biol Chem 2000; 275 : 24313 - 24320). IMPDH was identified by liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry as a protein which was phosphorylated in a phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3 -kinase-dependent manner upon insulin treatment. Although insulin had no significant effect on IMPDH activity, we observed translocation of IMPDH to lipid bodies following insulin treatment. Induction of lipid body formation with oleic acid promoted dramatic redistribution of IMPDH to lipid bodies, which {{appeared to be in}} contact with the endoplasmic reticulum, the site of lipid <b>body</b> <b>synthesis</b> and recycling. Inhibition of PI 3 -kinase blocked insulin- and oleate-induced translocation of IMPDH and reduced oleate-induced lipid accumulation. However, we found no evidence of oleate-induced IMPDH phosphorylation, suggesting phosphorylation and translocation may not be coupled events. These data support a role for IMPDH in the dynamic regulation of lipid bodies and fatty acid metabolism and regulation of its activity by subcellular redistribution in response to extracellular factors that modify lipid metabolism...|$|E
40|$|This study {{proposed}} {{a new strategy}} for uncovering the active chemical constituents of a traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs) formula, Chaihu-Shu-Gan-San (CSGS). Metabonomics and chemical profile were integrated {{in combination with the}} multivariate statistical analysis (MVA) to discover the chemical constituents which contribute to the antidepressant effect of CSGS. Based upon the difference between CSGS and QZ (CSGS without Zhi-Qiao) extracts in the chemical profiles and the regulations of metabolic disturbances induced by CUMS, synephrine, naringin, hesperidin, and neohesperidin were recognized as the active constituents of CSGS from Zhi-qiao responsible for those missing regulations of CSGS when Zhi-Qiao was subtracted from the whole formula. They participated in the regulations of the deviated metabolites 2 – 4, 10 – 14, and 22 – 25, involved in metabolic pathways of ketone <b>bodies</b> <b>synthesis,</b> phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis, valine, aspartate, glutamate metabolism, and glycolysis/gluconeogenesis. Furthermore, the assay of MAO-A activity confirmed the potential antidepressant effect of naringin and its active sites on the MAO-A was inferred by molecular docking study. The integration of metabonomics and chemical profile was proved to be a useful strategy for uncovering what the active chemical constituents in TCM formula are and how they make contributions for the efficacy of the formula...|$|R
40|$|To {{investigate}} the anabolic effects of feeding in cirrhosis, we measured albumin fractional synthesis rate (FSR) and whole <b>body</b> protein <b>synthesis</b> in six nondiabetic patients with stable liver cirrhosis (three in the Child-Pugh classification Class A, three in Class B) and in seven normal control subjects, {{before and after}} administration of a 4 -h mixed meal. Leucine tracer precursor-product relationships and whole body kinetics were employed at steady state. Basal levels of postabsorptive albumin concentration and FSR, whole body leucine rate of appearance, oxidation, and nonoxidative leucine disposal (NOLD, approximately equal to protein synthesis) were similar in the two groups. However, after the meal, in the patients neither albumin FSR (from 8. 5 +/- 1. 5 to 8. 8 +/- 1. 8 %/day) nor NOLD (from 1. 69 +/- 0. 22 to 1. 55 +/- 0. 26 micromol x kg(- 1) x min(- 1)) changed (P = nonsignificant vs. basal), whereas they increased in control subjects (albumin FSR: from 10. 9 +/- 1. 5 to 15. 9 +/- 1. 9 %/day, P < 0. 002; NOLD: from 1. 80 +/- 0. 14 to 2. 10 +/- 0. 19 micromol x kg(- 1) x min(- 1), P = 0. 032). Thus mixed meal ingestion did not stimulate either albumin FSR or whole <b>body</b> protein <b>synthesis</b> in compensated liver cirrhosis. The mechanism(s) maintaining normoalbuminemia at this disease stage need to be further investigated...|$|R
40|$|Shuang-huang-lian {{injection}} (SHLI) is {{a famous}} Chinese patent medicine, {{which has been}} wildly used in clinic {{for the treatment of}} acute respiratory tract infection, pneumonia, influenza, etc. The existing randomized controlled trial (RCT) studies suggested that SHLI could afford a certain anti-febrile action. However, seldom does research concern the pharmacological mechanisms of SHLI. In the current study, we explored plasma metabolomic profiling technique and selected potential metabolic markers to reveal the antipyretic mechanism of SHLI on yeast-induced pyrexia rat model using UPLC-Q-TOF/MS coupled with multivariate statistical analysis and pattern recognition techniques. We discovered a significant perturbance of metabolic profile in the plasma of fever rats and obvious reversion in SHLI-administered rats. Eight potential biomarkers, i. e. 1) 3 -hydeoxybutyric acid, 2) leucine, 3) 16 : 0 LPC, 4) allocholic acid, 5) vitamin B 2, 6) Cys-Lys-His, 7) 18 : 2 LPC, and 8) 3 -hydroxychola- 7, 22 -dien- 24 -oic acid, were screened out by OPLS-DA approach. Five potential perturbed metabolic pathways, i. e. 1) valine, leucine, and isoleucine biosynthesis, 2) glycerophospholipid metabolism, 3) ketone <b>bodies</b> <b>synthesis</b> and degradation, 4) bile acid biosynthesis, and 5) riboflavin metabolism, were revealed to relate to the antipyretic mechanisms of SHLI. Overall, we investigated antipyretic mechanisms of SHLI at metabolomic level for the first time, and the obtained results highlights the necessity of adopting metabolomics as a reliable tool for understanding the holism an...|$|R
