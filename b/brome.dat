5|$|After the French chemists Louis Nicolas Vauquelin, Louis Jacques Thénard, and Joseph-Louis Gay-Lussac {{approved}} the experiments {{of the young}} pharmacist Balard, the results were presented at a lecture of the Académie des Sciences and published in Annales de Chimie et Physique. In his publication, Balard states that he changed the name from muride to <b>brôme</b> on the proposal of M. Anglada. <b>Brôme</b> (bromine) derives from the Greek βρωμος (stench). Other sources claim that the French chemist and physicist Joseph-Louis Gay-Lussac suggested the name <b>brôme</b> for the characteristic smell of the vapors. Bromine was not produced in large quantities until 1858, when the discovery of salt deposits in Stassfurt enabled its production as a by-product of potash.|$|E

5|$|The nationally scarce bulbous foxtail (Alopecurus bulbosus), slender hare's-ear (Bupleurum tenuissimum) and {{sea barley}} (Hordeum marinum) are grazed by sheep on the marshes around the bay. Around Stert Island the nationally rare compact <b>brome</b> (Bromus madritensis) and nationally scarce Ray's {{knotgrass}} (Polygonum oxyspermum) can be found.|$|E
50|$|In turn, <b>Brome's</b> {{derivative}} play {{spawned a}} derivation of its own: Restoration playwright George Powell's comedy A Very Good Wife, staged and printed in 1693, borrowed heavily from The City Wit and from <b>Brome's</b> The Court Beggar.|$|R
50|$|During the Restoration era, Aphra Behn adapted <b>Brome's</b> {{play into}} The Debauchee, or the Credulous Cuckold (printed 1677). Behn {{retained}} much of <b>Brome's</b> work in her version, even keeping the original characters' names — though she expanded the crucial bedroom scene in Act IV.|$|R
50|$|Like most of <b>Brome's</b> comedies, A Mad Couple shows strong {{influences}} {{from the}} works of Ben Jonson and from earlier works in the genre of city comedy. The resemblance between <b>Brome's</b> complaisant cuckold Saleware in A Mad Couple and the character Candido in Thomas Dekker's The Honest Whore, Part 1 has drawn notice.|$|R
5|$|Lord God, {{the resurrection}} and life {{of all who}} believe in thee, who art always worthy to be praised by both {{the living and the}} dead, we give thee thanks for Edward the Second, our Founder, for Adam de <b>Brome,</b> our {{principal}} benefactor and for all our other benefactors, by whose benefits we are here maintained in godliness and learning; and we beseech thee that using these thy gifts rightly we may be led to the immortal glory of resurrection, through Jesus Christ our Lord.|$|E
5|$|The {{dominant}} {{plants in}} the park include more than 100 grass species, many native to the region. Growing among the grasses are flowering species such as evening primrose, mariposa lily, and blue flax, and shrubs such as sagebrush, saltbush, and rabbitbrush. Among {{the wide variety of}} grasses are native perennial bunchgrass, blue grama, sacaton, sideoats grama, bearded sprangletop, and bush muhly. Invasive species that crowd out slower-spreading natives include annual lovegrass and <b>brome</b> (cheat grass).|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} medieval foundation {{set up by}} Adam de <b>Brome,</b> {{under the}} patronage of Edward II, was called the House or Hall of the Blessed Mary at Oxford. The first design allowed for a Provost and ten Fellows, called 'scholars', and the College remained a small body of graduate Fellows until the 16th century, when it started to admit undergraduates. During the English Civil War, Oriel played host to high-ranking members of the King's Oxford Parliament.|$|E

5000|$|Given <b>Brome's</b> strong {{allegiance}} to the comedy of Ben Jonson, {{it is not surprising}} to find Jonsonian elements in the play too. In fact, City Wit has been termed <b>Brome's</b> [...] "most overtly Jonsonian comedy." [...] In Act III, scene i, Crack specifically compares the play's three charlatan characters, Master Crasy, himself, and Mistress Tryman, to Subtle, Face, and Doll in The Alchemist.|$|R
5000|$|Like most of <b>Brome's</b> comic works, The Damoiselle can {{be placed}} in the broad {{category}} of [...] "city comedy." [...] Again like most of <b>Brome's</b> comedies, the influence of Ben Jonson is readily detectable. In the view of one critic, [...] "Brome's Damoiselle seems to be deliberately constructed as a mirror image" [...] of Jonson's 1629 play The New Inn.|$|R
5|$|In 1326 Provost Adam de <b>Brome</b> was {{appointed}} warden of St Bartholomew's; a leper hospital in Cowley Marsh, {{the hospital was}} later granted to the college by Edward III, along with the payments it had been receiving from the fee farm. It was increasingly used as a rest house for sick members of the college needing a change of air. In 1649 the college rebuilt the main hospital range north of the chapel, destroyed in the Civil War, as a row of four almshouses, called Bartlemas House. Bartlemas Chapel and two farm cottages are the other extant buildings.|$|E
5|$|South-west of {{the town}} is the Friar's Oven SSSI which {{is the site of}} herb-rich {{calcareous}} grassland classified as the Upright <b>Brome</b> (Bromus erectus) type, and north-east is the Windsor Hill Quarry geological SSSI, and also the Windsor Hill Marsh biological SSSI, a marshy silted pond with adjacent damp, slightly acidic grassland of interest for its diverse flora, in large part down to the varied habitats present within the small area. Two species are present which are rare in Somerset: Flat-sedge (Blysmus compressus) and Slender Spike-rush (Eleocharis uniglumis). Other marshland plants found there include Purple Loosestrife, Yellow Flag (Iris pseudacorus), Hard Rush (Juncus inflexus), Soft Rush (J. effusus), Flowering Rush (Butomus umbellatus), Devil's-bit Scabious (Succisa pratensis), three species of Horsetail Equisetum spp. and seven sedges Carex spp.|$|E
5|$|Viral genomes are circular, {{as in the}} polyomaviruses, or linear, as in the adenoviruses. The type of {{nucleic acid}} is {{irrelevant}} {{to the shape of}} the genome. Among RNA viruses and certain DNA viruses, the genome is often divided up into separate parts, in which case it is called segmented. For RNA viruses, each segment often codes for only one protein and they are usually found together in one capsid. However, all segments are not required {{to be in the same}} virion for the virus to be infectious, as demonstrated by <b>brome</b> mosaic virus and several other plant viruses.|$|E

5|$|On the High Street, No. 106 and 107 {{stand on}} the site of Tackley's Inn; built around 1295, it was the first piece of {{property}} that Adam de <b>Brome</b> acquired when he began to found the college in 1324. It comprised a hall and chambers leased to scholars, behind a frontage of five shops, with the scholars above and a cellar of five bays below. The hall, which was open to the roof, was 33feet (10m) long, 20feet (6m) wide, and about 22feet (7m) high; at the east end was a large chamber with another chamber above it. The south wall of the building, which survives, was partly of stone and contains a large two-light early 14th-century window. The cellar below is of the same date and is the best preserved medieval cellar in Oxford; originally entered by stone steps from the street, it has a stone vault divided into four sections by two diagonal ribs, with carved corbels.|$|E
5|$|Some of {{the most}} common trees that grow in the Big Butte Creek {{watershed}} include four species of fir, two species of pine, incense cedar, and western hemlock. The understory contains plants such as Pacific yew, Pacific madrone, chinquapin, and vine maple. Several invasive species {{have been reported in the}} Big Butte Creek watershed, such as Kentucky bluegrass, common bent, drooping <b>brome,</b> and redtop. The spread of these species is most likely due to overgrazing. Sensitive species that grow in the watershed include Howell's yampah, Egg Lake monkeyflower, clustered lady's slipper, green-flowered ginger, Mount Mazama collomia, and Detling's microseris. Mallow and popcorn flower have also been discovered in riparian zones. The Poverty Flats Area of Critical Environmental Concern (ACEC) is home to several rare species of plants, including Bellinger's meadowfoam, Howell's yampah, and Rocky Mountain woodsia.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Brome</b> play of Abraham and Isaac (also {{known as}} The <b>Brome</b> “Abraham and Isaac”, The <b>Brome</b> Abraham, and The Sacrifice of Isaac) is a fifteenth-century play of unknown authorship, written in an East Anglian dialect of Middle English, which dramatises {{the story of}} the Akedah, the binding of Isaac.|$|E

5000|$|... "By 1638 the {{disguised}} Moor {{had become}} a theatrical convention." [...] Richard <b>Brome's</b> The English Moor (c. 1637), almost contemporaneous with Heminges's play, is a noteworthy example.|$|R
25|$|When Adam de <b>Brome</b> became rector in 1320 the church's fortune became {{linked to}} what would later become Oriel College. In 1324 <b>Brome</b> founded St Mary Hall and {{appropriated}} the church's rectory house, including small tithes, oblations and burial dues for the college, an act confirmed in 1326 by the bishop, Henry Burghersh, after <b>Brome</b> had got Edward II's patronage to refound the college. <b>Brome</b> diverted the revenues {{of the church to}} his college, which thereafter was responsible for appointing the vicar and providing four chaplains to celebrate the daily services in the church. Early provosts of the college were inducted into their stall in the church, and until 1642 fellows were required to attend services on Sundays and holy days.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Brome</b> Abraham's {{relation}} to the play of the same subject in the cycle of Chester Mystery Plays has attracted attention. A comparison of the texts reveals around 200 lines of striking similarity, in particular during the debates between Abraham and Isaac {{that are at the}} hearts of the plays. A. M. Kinghorn judged the <b>Brome</b> play to be a superior reworking of the Chester barbers' play of Abraham, and accordingly dated the play to late in the fifteenth century. However, comparing the two, J. Burke Severs decided that the Chester play was an expansion and reworking of the <b>Brome</b> one.|$|E

50|$|<b>Brome's</b> {{contribution}} to this literature has {{attracted the attention of}} specialist scholars, for its songs and for its preservation of the particular linguistic forms of the Caroline underclass.|$|R

5000|$|While <b>Brome's</b> A Jovial Crew had {{links with}} the theatre and {{literature}} of its period, the play also drew upon actual events and the social realities of its era. The tumultuous {{years leading up to}} the start of the Civil War saw some significant economic dislocations; local authorities in England complained of [...] "the great number of rogues and vagabonds and sturdy beggars wandering and lurking in the country, to the great trouble and terror of the same." [...] <b>Brome's</b> play provided at least a limited recognition of this socio-economic underside of Caroline England.|$|R
25|$|While Joseph Quincy Adams {{reckoned}} the <b>Brome</b> Abraham “must be dated {{as early}} as the fourteenth century,”, most other scholars assign various periods of the fifteenth century for the play's composition.|$|E
25|$|The {{presence}} of the (post-Reformation) Catholic Church in Bulkington begins in 1842 when Richard <b>Brome</b> de Bary, owner of Weston Hall, converted to Catholicism. He established a mission at his home, dedicated to Our Lady of Bethlehem. As well as Bulkington, the church also serves the nearby village of Wolvey. The parish belongs to the archdiocese of Birmingham.|$|E
25|$|The text of {{the play}} was lost until the 19th century, when a {{manuscript}} {{was found in a}} commonplace book dating from around 1470–80 at <b>Brome</b> Manor, Suffolk, England. The manuscript itself has been dated at 1454 at the earliest. This manuscript is now housed at Yale University's Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library.|$|E
50|$|Other {{plays in}} the company's {{repertory}} included <b>Brome's</b> The Queen and Concubine, Randolph's Amyntas, Thomas Rawlins's The Rebellion, Nathanael Richards's Messalina, William Heminges's The Madcap, and Henry Glapthorne's The Lady Mother.|$|R
