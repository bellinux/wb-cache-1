60|$|The Re-expansion of the Tentacles.--This {{movement}} is always slow and gradual. When {{the centre of}} the leaf is excited, or a leaf is immersed in a proper solution, all the tentacles bend directly towards the centre, and afterwards directly back from it. But when the point of excitement is {{on one side of the}} disc, the surrounding tentacles bend towards it, and therefore obliquely with respect to their normal direction; when they afterwards re-expand, they bend obliquely back, so as to recover their original positions. The tentacles farthest from an excited point, wherever that may be, are the last and the least affected, and probably in consequence of this they are the first to re-expand. The <b>bent</b> <b>portion</b> of a closely inflected tentacle is in a state of active contraction, as shown by the following experiment. Meat was placed on a leaf, and after the tentacles were closely inflected and had quite ceased to move, narrow strips of the disc, with a few of the outer tentacles attached to it, were cut off and laid on one side under the microscope. After several failures, I succeeded in cutting off the convex surface of the <b>bent</b> <b>portion</b> of a tentacle. Movement immediately recommenced, and the already greatly <b>bent</b> <b>portion</b> went on bending until it formed a perfect circle; the straight distal portion of the tentacle passing on one side of the strip. The convex surface must therefore have previously been in a state of tension, sufficient to counter-balance that of the concave surface, which, when free, curled into a complete ring.|$|E

The curvature-induced mistuning, that is, the change in resonance frequencies compared with a straight tube having the same axis length, is characterized as a length correction, that can be deduced from a direct calculation of the resonance frequencies, or from the input impedance. This length correction exhibit a strong frequency dependence, denoting a complex inharmonicity, that can be, in some cases, musically significant.

Audible sound, in the frequency range from 160 to 8000 Hz, is provided and sound pressure levels {{on both sides of the}} considered slit are detected by microphones, so that sound transmission losses can be obtained. Simultaneously, the air leakage through the slit under an inside-outside pressure difference of 50 Pa is also measured. Two different slits are used, one of which is rectangular of narrow width (0 Â· 05 - 1 Â· 00 mm), and the other is of the same section but with <b>bent</b> <b>portions</b> of the passage, as might be encountered in building constructions.

Numerical calculations were carried out for the rod with both an elastic portion and a viscoelastic portion carrying a mass at the end. In this problem, the rotary vibration is of importance because it generates noise, hence the location of the viscoelastic support which induces the rotary vibration of the mass minimum is discussed in detail. The fuzzy algorithm by which the optimal location of the supports is obtained is also presented...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel anchor system called U-anchor {{that can be}} used to significantly improve the performance of surface mounted reinforcement for concrete/masonry made of fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) composites. In applications where bond and/or development length of FRP are critical, the U-anchor prevents debonding of the reinforcement. The anchor is based on the idea of embedding a <b>bent</b> <b>portion</b> of the end (or near the end) of the FRP reinforcement into a preformed groove in the concrete/masonry. The groove is filled with a viscous paste and may or may not include an FRP bar. The U-anchor is compatible with any external FRP strengthening system and avoids high stress concentration and durability concerns. It can be used with sheets and pre-cured laminates that are unbonded or fully bonded to concrete. Laboratory testing confirms the excellent performance of the U-anchor system...|$|E
40|$|A new canopy {{training}} system (“bent canopy”) {{is widely used}} in greenhouse rose production. The bent canopy consists of a upright hedge and a mat of bent shoots between the hedges. The idea of this heterogeneous canopy is to utilize radiation that falls into the aisle space. A radiative transfer model was developed for a bent canopy. Diffuse and direct light distribution and absorption were simulated by calculating the path length of attenuated light through the canopy. Assimilation rates of sunlit and shaded leaf area were then calculated in relation to position within the canopy and time of day. Numerical integration of the sunlit and shaded assimilation rates over the respective leaf area index (LAI), leaf age, and over the day yielded diurnal course of canopy photosynthesis. The geometry of the canopy was described by hedge height and width, depth and width of the bent canopy, row direction, leaf angle, and leaf area density (LAD). The simulation indicated that bent canopy system is less sensitive to row direction than the conventional hedgerow canopy and that the desired LAD of the <b>bent</b> <b>portion</b> {{was related to the}} LAD of the upright hedges...|$|E
40|$|Sheet-metal {{components}} are used {{extensively in the}} aerospace and the electronic industry, where high precision is an essential requirement for the final products. In precision components, the calculation of the bend allowance is important,in arriving at the final dimensions of the developed length of the sheet metal. Bend allowance {{is defined as the}} length of the unstretched fiber in the <b>bent</b> <b>portion</b> of the sheet. Any inaccuracy in calculating the bend-allowance parameter during bending may result in increasing the inaccuracy in the final developed length of the sheet. This causes the blank size to be incorrect, which in turn causes the location of bend lines, slots, and holes to be inaccurate. This may cause mismatch in the final assembly also. In this paper an attempt has been made to first review the current industrial practice for the calculation of bend allowance. The current empirical methods used to calculate the bend-allowance parameter are examined and the drawbacks associated with them are identified. The highlight of this paper is on a mathematical model which has been developed to calculate the bend-allowance parameter accurately by assuming plane-strain deformation and a rigid-plastic material, considering thinning effects. The effects of temperature and friction are neglected. The bend-allowance parameter is calculated on the basis of material properties such as the yield stress and the strain-hardening exponent, and the tool geometry. The model has been tested with available data in the literature to assess its accuracy...|$|E
40|$|To {{calculate}} the shear capacity of structural members reinforced with fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP), current shear design provisions generally use slightly modified versions of existing semiempirical shear design equations initially developed for steel reinforced concrete beams. Such methods generally {{assume that the}} traditional approach of superimposing concrete contribution to shear, Vc to that of stirrups, Vs {{can also be used}} to {{calculate the}} nominal shear capacity, Vn of FRP-reinforced concrete beams provided that the axial rigidity of FRP longitudinal bars and the capacity of FRP stirrups at the <b>bent</b> <b>portions</b> are accounted for. These methods also noticeably vary in the manner they account for the effect of basic shear design parameters on shear strength. This paper presents simple yet improved equations to calculate the shear capacity of FRP-reinforced concrete beams based on the genetic algorithms approach. The performance of the proposed equations is compared to that of four commonly used shear design methods for FRP-reinforced concrete beams, namely the ACI 440, CSA S 806, JSCE, and ISIS Canada. Results show that current guidelines are either inadequate or very conservative in estimating the shear strength of FRP-reinforced concrete beams. Moreover, the shear capacity of FRP-reinforced concrete beams calculated using the proposed equations is in better agreement with available experimental data than that calculated using shear equations provided by current provisions. This study also shows that the axial rigidity of FRP longitudinal bars is best represented by a cubic root function and that the contribution of FRP stirrups to shear strength is a square root function of the stirrups ultimate capacity rather than a linear function as proposed by current shear provisions...|$|R

40|$|The present {{invention}} discloses bola bodies, bolas, and a snaring method {{which makes}} use such devices. A bola body, {{according to the}} present invention, is nonspherical or irregular in shape rather than a smooth sphere or ovoid body. One or more fingers extends from the bola body. These fingers may be relatively straight or they may have crooked or <b>bent</b> <b>portions</b> to enhance entanglement with a bola line or lines or with each other. Two or more of such fingers may be used and may be regularly or irregularly spaced apart on a bola body. A bola with such bodies includes lines which {{are connected to the}} other bodies. In one particular embodiment of a bola body, according to the present invention, the body has an irregular shape with a bottom rectangular portion and a top pyramid portion forming a nose. A plurality of fingers is extended from the pyramidal top portion with one finger extended up and away from each of four corners of the top portion. Such a bola body tends to be initially oriented with its nose and fingers against an object being snared since the body is pulled nose first when a bola line is secured {{at the tip of the}} pyramidal portion of the bola body. With such a bola, an unwrapping bola body can slip around a target member so that two of the rod-shaped fingers catch a bola line and guide it into an area or crook between the fingers and a side of the top pyramidal portion of the bola body. Tension on the bola line maintains the line in the crook and tends to press the fingers against the unwrapped target member to stabilize the wrapping of the line about the target member. With such a bola, it is difficult for two or more lines unwrapping in different directions to move past one another without being forced together by line tension. Also, the fingers of such bola bodies may hook and hold each other. The fingers may also hook or entangle some object on or portion of the target member. A probable known target member has known dimensions and shapes so that the bola may be sized and configured to reliably snare such a known target. The bolas can be optimally sized, fashioned, and configured to contact and hold a probable target of known size, dimension, and shape...|$|R

60|$|The {{petioles}} are bowed downwards, {{and have}} the same general hook-like form as in C. viticella. The medial petiole and the lateral sub- petioles are sensitive, especially the much <b>bent</b> terminal <b>portion.</b> As the sensitiveness is here greater {{than in any other}} species of the genus observed by me, and is in itself remarkable, I will give fuller details. The petioles, when so young that they have not separated from one another, are not sensitive; when the lamina of a leaflet has grown to a quarter of an inch in length (that is, about one-sixth of its full size), the sensitiveness is highest; but at this period the petioles are relatively much more fully developed than are the blades of the leaves. Full-grown petioles are not in the least sensitive. A thin stick placed so as to press lightly against a petiole, having a leaflet a quarter of an inch in length, caused the petiole to bend in 3 hrs. 15 m. In another case a petiole curled completely round a stick in 12 hrs. These petioles were left curled for 24 hrs., and the sticks were then removed; but they never straightened themselves. I took a twig, thinner than the petiole itself, and with it lightly rubbed several petioles four times up and down; these in 1 hr. 45 m. became slightly curled; the curvature increased during some hours and then began to decrease, but after 25 hrs. from the time of rubbing a vestige of the curvature remained. Some other petioles similarly rubbed twice, that is, once up and once down, became perceptibly curved in about 2 hrs. 30 m., the terminal sub-petiole moving more than the lateral sub-petioles; they all became straight again in between 12 hrs. and 14 hrs. Lastly, a length of about one-eighth of an inch of a sub-petiole, was lightly rubbed with the same twig only once; it became slightly curved in 3 hrs., remaining so during 11 hrs., but by the next morning was quite straight.|$|R
60|$|The {{leaves are}} of large size. Each bears {{three pairs of}} lateral {{leaflets}} and a terminal one, all supported on rather long sub- petioles. The main petiole bends a little angularly downwards at each point where a pair of leaflets arises (see fig. 2), and the petiole of the terminal leaflet is bent downwards at right angles; hence the whole petiole, with its rectangularly bent extremity, acts as a hook. This hook, the lateral petioles being directed a little upwards; forms an excellent grappling apparatus, by which the leaves readily become entangled with surrounding objects. If they catch nothing, the whole petiole ultimately grows straight. The main petiole, the sub-petioles, and the three branches into which each basi-lateral sub-petiole is generally subdivided, are all sensitive. The basal portion of the main petiole, between the stem and the first pair of leaflets, is less sensitive than the remainder; it will, however, clasp a stick with which it is left in contact. The inferior surface of the rectangularly <b>bent</b> terminal <b>portion</b> (carrying the terminal leaflet), which forms the inner side {{of the end of}} the hook, is the most sensitive part; and this portion is manifestly best adapted to catch a distant support. To show the difference in sensibility, I gently placed loops of string of the same weight (in one instance weighing only 0.82 of a grain or 53.14 mg.) on the several lateral sub-petioles and on the terminal one; in a few hours the latter was bent, but after 24 hrs. no effect was produced on the other sub-petioles. Again, a terminal sub-petiole placed in contact with a thin stick became sensibly curved in 45 m., and in 1 hr. 10m. moved through ninety degrees; whilst a lateral sub-petiole did not become sensibly curved until 3 hrs. 30 m. had elapsed. In all cases, if the sticks are taken away, the petioles continue to move during many hours afterwards; so they do after a slight rubbing; but they become straight again, after about a day's interval, that is if the flexure has not been very great or long continued.|$|R
