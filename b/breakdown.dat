5|$|Amartya Sen’s {{cooperative}} conflicts {{approach to}} gender biases frames women’s gender disadvantage through three different responses: <b>breakdown</b> wellbeing, perceived interest and perceived contribution responses. The <b>breakdown</b> well-being response—derived from the Nash equilibrium—describes <b>breakdown</b> positions between individuals during cooperative decisions. When the <b>breakdown</b> position of one individual {{is less than}} the other person, the solution to any conflict will ultimately result in less favourable conditions for the first individual. In terms of women’s health in India, the overall gender disadvantage facing women—represented by cultural and societal factors that favour men over women—negatively impacts their ability to make decisions with regards to seeking out healthcare.|$|E

Previous studies in experimental settings have investigated potential causes of <b>breakdowns</b> in conversations with a person with HI, and effective strategies for repairing these <b>breakdowns.</b> However, little research has explored the causes of hearing-related communication <b>breakdowns,</b> and their repairs, in extended, naturally occurring conversations in a healthcare setting...|$|R
30|$|In the {{presence}} of chronic <b>breakdowns,</b> operators are able to perform required operations but with reduced speed. These <b>breakdowns</b> are continual and may result in minor stoppages that can be repaired {{within a short time}} (Ireland and Dale 2001; Leflar 2001). Neglecting the chronic <b>breakdowns</b> leads to sporadic <b>breakdowns,</b> which are suddenly exposed and unexpected. Badiger and Laxman (2013) discussed that sporadic <b>breakdowns</b> can cease entire operation and it typically requires major troubleshooting to restore the machine to working condition or to replace with new machine.|$|R
50|$|Causes of such <b>breakdowns</b> are varied. A 1996 {{study found}} that {{problems}} with intimate relationships, such as divorce or marital separation, contributed to 24% of nervous <b>breakdowns.</b> Problems at work and school accounted for 17% of cases, and financial problems for 11%. Surveys suggest that in the United States, health problems have decreased in importance as a contributor to nervous <b>breakdowns.</b> Health problems accounted for 28% of nervous <b>breakdowns</b> in 1957, 12% in 1976, and only 5.6% in 1996.|$|R

5|$|Carbohydrate {{catabolism}} is the <b>breakdown</b> {{of carbohydrates}} into smaller units. Carbohydrates are usually taken into cells {{once they have}} been digested into monosaccharides. Once inside, the major route of <b>breakdown</b> is glycolysis, where sugars such as glucose and fructose are converted into pyruvate and some ATP is generated. Pyruvate is an intermediate in several metabolic pathways, but the majority is converted to acetyl-CoA through aerobic (with oxygen) glycolysis and fed into the citric acid cycle. Although some more ATP is generated in the citric acid cycle, the most important product is NADH, which is made from NAD+ as the acetyl-CoA is oxidized. This oxidation releases carbon dioxide as a waste product. In anaerobic conditions, glycolysis produces lactate, through the enzyme lactate dehydrogenase re-oxidizing NADH to NAD+ for re-use in glycolysis. An alternative route for glucose <b>breakdown</b> is the pentose phosphate pathway, which reduces the coenzyme NADPH and produces pentose sugars such as ribose, the sugar component of nucleic acids.|$|E

5|$|Liver {{cells are}} {{another example of}} {{specialized}} cells that contain an abundance of smooth ER. These cells provide {{an example of the}} role of smooth ER in carbohydrate metabolism. Liver cells store carbohydrates in the form of glycogen. The <b>breakdown</b> of glycogen eventually leads to the release of glucose from the liver cells, which is important in the regulation of sugar concentration in the blood. However, the primary product of glycogen <b>breakdown</b> is glucose-1-phosphate. This is converted to glucose-6-phosphate and then an enzyme of the liver cell's smooth ER removes the phosphate from the glucose, so that it can then leave the cell.|$|E

40|$|Handoffs {{have been}} {{recognized}} as a major healthcare challenge primarily due to the <b>breakdowns</b> in communication that occur during transitions in care. Consequently, they are characterized as being “remarkably haphazard”. To investigate the information <b>breakdowns</b> in group handoff communication, we conducted a study at a large academic hospital in Texas. We used multifaceted qualitative methods such as observations, shadowing of care providers and their work activities, audio-recording of handoffs, and care provider interviews to examine the handoff communication workflow, with particular emphasis on investigating the sources of information <b>breakdowns.</b> Using a mixed inductive-deductive analysis approach, we identified two critical sources for information <b>breakdowns</b> - lack of standardization in handoff communication events and unsuccessful completion of pre-turnover coordination activities. We propose strategic solutions that can effectively help mitigate the handoff communication <b>breakdowns...</b>|$|R
40|$|Managing {{international}} {{teams with}} geographically distributed participants {{is a complex}} task. The risk of communication <b>breakdowns</b> increases due to cultural and organizational differences grounded in the geographical distribution of the participants. Such <b>breakdowns</b> indicate general misunderstandings {{and a lack of}} shared meaning between participants. In this paper, we address the complexity of building shared meaning. We examine the communication <b>breakdowns</b> that occurred in two globally distributed virtual teams by providing an analytical distinction of the organizational context as the foundation for building shared meaning at three levels. Also we investigate communication <b>breakdowns</b> that can be attributed to differences in lifeworld structures, organizational structures, and work process structures within a virtual team. We find that all communication <b>breakdowns</b> are manifested and experienced by the participants at the work process level; however, resolving <b>breakdowns</b> may require critical reflection at other levels. Where previous research argues that face-to-face interaction is an important variable for virtual team performance, our empirical observations reveal that communication <b>breakdowns</b> related to a lack of shared meaning at the lifeworld level often becomes more salient when the participants are co-located than when geographically distributed. Last, we argue that creating translucence in communication structures is essential for building shared meanings at all three levels...|$|R

Although electroporation and dielectric <b>breakdown</b> both result from application of an electric field, the mechanisms involved are fundamentally different. In dielectric <b>breakdown</b> the barrier material is ionized, creating a conductive pathway. The material alteration is thus chemical in nature. In contrast, during electroporation the lipid molecules are not chemically altered but simply shift position, opening up a pore that acts as the conductive pathway through the bilayer as it is filled with water.|$|E

40|$|Bilingual children’s repairs 2 This study {{examined}} two- (n= 10) and three-year-old (n= 16) French-English bilingual children’s repairs of <b>breakdowns</b> in communication that occurred {{when they did}} not use the same language as their interlocutor (Language <b>breakdowns)</b> and for Other reasons (e. g., inaudible utterance).
