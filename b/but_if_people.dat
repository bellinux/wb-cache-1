One {{of it is}} music, but I {{think it is very}} important with people who are dealing with making music that they are not only {{influenced by}} music. And I find it very sad when you find a record, and it says on : [...] "this record was inspired by Miles Davis." [...] Because it's like making...a film, you don't make a film about a film, you make a film about real life. And you wouldn't sit down and write a book about a book, it's like recycling, it misses the point. And music isn't brilliant unless it goes beyond the point of being music and becomes real life. So I'm influenced by real life. And when people listen to my music and say [...] "Oh, I can see great influence from this artist in there", I read that and I say [...] "Okay, I didn't succeed". <b>But</b> <b>if</b> <b>people</b> listen to my music and say [...] "Oh, this made me feel like this and that [...] ", that's right. It should be beyond style, beyond influence, it should be about pure emotion, and real life.|$|E

2500|$|Bar Kappara {{interpreted}} [...] "Only take heed to yourself," [...] {{together with}} [...] "For if you shall diligently keep all this commandment that I command you." [...] Bar Kappara compared {{the soul and}} the Torah to a lamp, as [...] says, [...] "The soul of man is the lamp of the Lord," [...] and [...] says, [...] "For the commandment is a lamp, and the teaching is light." [...] God told humanity that God's light — the Torah — is in their hands, and their light — their souls — are in God's hands. God said that if people guard God's light, then God will guard their lights, <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>people</b> extinguish God's light, then God will extinguish their lights. For [...] says, [...] "Only take heed to yourself," [...] and then [...] "Keep your soul diligently." [...] This explains [...] "For if you shall diligently keep." [...] The Midrash thus taught that [...] "if you keep" [...] (God's commandments), then [...] "you shall be kept" [...] (and your souls shall be guarded).|$|E
2500|$|<b>But</b> <b>if</b> <b>people</b> with firmly held {{negative}} self-views seek self-verification, {{this does}} not mean that they are masochistic or have no desire to be loved. In fact, even people with very low self-esteem want to be loved. What sets people with negative self-views apart is their ambivalence about the evaluations they receive. Just as positive evaluations foster joy and warmth initially, these feelings are later chilled by incredulity. And although negative evaluations may foster sadness that the [...] "truth" [...] could not be kinder, it will at least reassure them that they know themselves. Happily, people with negative self-views are the exception rather than the rule. That is, on the balance, most people tend to view themselves positively. Although this imbalance is adaptive for society at large, it poses a challenge to researchers interested in studying self-verification. That is, for theorists interested in determining if behavior is driven by self-verification or positivity strivings, participants with positive self-views will reveal nothing because both motives compel them to seek positive evaluations. If researchers want to learn if people prefer verification or positivity in a giving setting, they must study people with negative self-views.|$|E

2500|$|With the line-up secured, Red {{entered a}} {{longtime}} association with producer, songwriter, and musician Rob Graves. After they had recorded four demos {{in a garage}} and a nursery that displayed their style of alternative, hard and Christian rock music. Rauch, who had worked as an intern in the same Nashville studio as Graves and supplied them with free equipment, invited Graves {{to listen to their}} music for his opinions. Graves recalled: [...] "It was really rough, all over the map, but I could hear the elements were there ... I told them it was really good, it had potential". Graves took them under his wing, and paid for studio time and the production of their first demos at Paragon Studios which happened across two years. Graves then signed Red to a development contract with his independent production company Six Feet Over, which led to a recording deal with Provident Label Group which then assigned them to its Christian label Essential Records after they liked their demo. Essential gave Red the green-light on a full length album. Speaking on their Christian influence, Barnes said: [...] "We are Christians in a band, <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>people</b> feel more comfortable and say that we are a Christian band, we do not to shy away from that". Hendrix parted ways with Red before recording began; he was replaced by drummer Hayden Lamb.|$|E

Steve Pond of Reuters theorised that W.E. probably would not help in [...] "turning Madonna's faltering movie career". Kyle Buchanan of New York wondered whether W.E. would receive any significant film related awards, as predicted by industry prognosticators. He concluded that the film [...] "still may , but to judge {{from some of the}} vicious pans coming out of Venice today, it might have longer legs as a Razzie front-runner." [...] Daily Mails Baz Bamigboye gave the film a mostly positive review, saying that [...] "A lot of people will loathe it, simply because it’s been made by Madonna. <b>But</b> <b>if</b> <b>people</b> were to watch it with no knowledge of who directed, they would be pleasantly surprised. They might even find much of it enjoyable." [...] David Gritten of The Daily Telegraph gave the film three stars and a mixed review stating that, [...] "Madonna's W.E. is a bold and confident story about an American woman's obsession with the Windsors." [...] Gritten complimented Riseborough and Cornish's acting but felt that the film looked like a commercial of expensive items, thus making it appeal to younger women for its fashion portrayal.|$|E
2500|$|Over the 20th century, trusts {{came to be}} {{used for}} {{multiple}} purposes beyond the classical role of parcelling out wealthy families' estates, wills, or charities. First, as more working-class people became more affluent, they began to be able to save for retirement through occupational pensions. After the Old Age Pensions Act 1908, everyone who worked and paid National Insurance would probably have access to the minimal state pension, <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>people</b> wanted to maintain their living standards, they would need more. Occupational pensions would typically be constituted through a trust deed, after being bargained for by a trade union under a collective agreement. After World War Two, the number of people with occupational pensions rose further, and gradually regulation was introduced to ensure that people's [...] "pension promise" [...] was protected. The settlor would usually be the employer and employee jointly, and the savings would be transferred to a trustee {{for the benefit of the}} employee. Most regulation, especially after the Robert Maxwell scandals and the Goode Report, was directed at ensuring that the employer cannot dominate, or abuse its position through undue influence over the trustee or the trust fund. The second main use of the trust came to be in other financial investments, though not necessarily for retirement. The unit trust, since their launch in 1931, became a popular vehicle for holding [...] "units" [...] in a fund that would invest in various assets, such as company shares, gilts or government bonds or corporate bonds. One person investing alone might not have much money to spread the risk of his or her investments, and so the unit trust offered an attractive way to pool many investors wealth, and share the profits (or losses). Nowadays, unit trusts have been mostly superseded by Open-ended investment companies, which do much the same thing, but are companies selling shares, rather than trusts. Nevertheless, trusts are widely used, and notorious in offshore trusts in [...] "tax havens", where people hire an accountant or lawyer to make an argument that shifting assets in some new way will avoid tax. The third main contemporary use of the trust has been in the family home, though not as an expressly declared trust. As gender inequality began to narrow, both partners to a marriage would often be contributing money, or work, to pay the mortgage, make their home, or raise children together. A number of members of the judiciary became active from the late 1960s in declaring that even if one partner was not on the legal title deeds, she or he would still have an equitable property interest in the home under a [...] "resulting trust" [...] or (more normally today) a [...] "constructive trust". In essence the courts would acknowledge the existence of a property right, without the trust being expressly declared. Some courts said it reflected an implicit common intention, while others said the use of the trust reflected the need to do justice. In this way, trusts continued to fulfill their historical function of mitigating strict legal rules in the interests of equity.|$|E
