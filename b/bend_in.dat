5|$|Some {{eukaryotic}} cells, {{such as the}} protist Euglena, {{also have}} flagella, but eukaryotic flagella do not rotate at the base; rather, they <b>bend</b> <b>in</b> {{such a way that}} the tip of the flagellum whips in a circle. The eukaryotic flagellum, also called a cilium or undulipodium, is structurally and evolutionarily distinct from prokaryotic flagella.|$|E
40|$|Consider {{an input}} data which {{specifies}} rectangular modules and connections between them; {{this is a}} graph. The size of the modules and the placements of the terminals on them is given {{as part of the}} input. We produce a block diagram, conforming to the input. The block diagram is on the rectilinear grid, and each edge (connection between modules) has few bends. For planar input, a linear-time algorithm is described to construct a planar drawing with at most 6 <b>bends</b> <b>in</b> each self-loop and at most 4 <b>bends</b> <b>in</b> any other edge. The external face of the drawing may be specified by the user. We show a planar input with no self-loops which has no drawing with at most 3 <b>bends</b> <b>in</b> every edge and another planar input which has no drawing with at most 5 <b>bends</b> <b>in</b> every self-loop. A linear-time algorithm is described to construct a nonplanar drawing of any input, with at most 4 <b>bends</b> <b>in</b> each edge. We show inputs that have no drawing with at most 3 <b>bends</b> <b>in</b> every edge...|$|R
5000|$|Besides only <b>bending</b> <b>in</b> one plane due to {{the rigid}} jointed structure, cable {{carriers}} also often only permit <b>bending</b> <b>in</b> one direction. In combination with rigid mounting of {{the ends of the}} carrier, this can entirely prevent the enclosed cables from flopping in undesired directions and becoming tangled or crushed.|$|R

5|$|South Bend {{benefited from}} its {{location}} on the Michigan Road, the main north–south artery of northern Indiana in the 19th century. Another significant development occurred near South <b>Bend</b> <b>in</b> 1842, when Father Edward Sorin founded the University of Notre Dame {{just north of the}} town.

5|$|Although {{there are}} no major flood control dams on Aliso Creek itself, there are 19drop {{structures}}, and while doing nothing to reduce the creek's rainy season surges, the drop structures were constructed to mitigate the catastrophic erosion {{that came with the}} creek's increased flow. Although the creek has a wide floodplain throughout most of Aliso Canyon, a major bottleneck lies {{at the south end of}} the canyon where a sharp <b>bend</b> <b>in</b> the creek is constricted between crowded development and steep cliffs. In flooding events, this area generally sustains heavy damage.|$|E
5|$|Artemis decodes the Book using {{translating}} software, {{and in the}} process, learns {{the specifics}} of the ritual fairies use to replenish their magic: take an acorn from an ancient oak tree near a <b>bend</b> <b>in</b> a river under the full moon and plant it elsewhere. Artemis and Butler track down 129 possible locations for the ritual and start a stakeout, they discover Holly performing the ritual. Butler tranquilizes Holly with a hypodermic dart gun.|$|E

5|$|Battersea Bridge is a five-span {{arch bridge}} with {{cast-iron}} girders and granite piers crossing the River Thames in London, England. It is situated on a sharp <b>bend</b> <b>in</b> the river, and links Battersea {{south of the}} river with Chelsea to the north. The bridge replaced a ferry service that had operated near the site {{since at least the}} middle of the 16th century.|$|E

There, Bus. M-43 ended at the intersection with M-43 while M-100 continued south.|$|E
5|$|By 1950, {{more than}} half of all {{employment}} was in the manufacturing sector. Due to economic difficulties, Studebaker closed its automotive manufacturing plants in South <b>Bend</b> <b>in</b> December 1963. A general decline in manufacturing soon followed as industry was being restructured nationwide. By the year 2000, manufacturing was only 16 percent of the local economy. Due to the severe loss of jobs, the city's population decreased by nearly 30,000 people during that period.|$|E
40|$|The band <b>bending</b> <b>in</b> a Mg-doped, p-type GaN film {{grown by}} hydride {{vapor phase epitaxy}} was studied at various temperatures. At 295 [*]K, the band <b>bending</b> <b>in</b> dark was {{calculated}} to be approximately − 1. 5 [*]eV. However, when the sample was heated to 600 [*]K for 1 [*]h in dark before performing a measurement at 295 [*]K, the calculated value of band <b>bending</b> <b>in</b> dark became about − 2. 0 [*]eV. These results are {{explained by the fact}} that increasing the sample temperature exponentially increases the rate at which the band bending restores and allows for a more accurate value of band bending to be measured...|$|R

5|$|Commercially navigable only at its mouth, the Saw Mill River {{itself was}} useless {{as a way}} to bring crops to market, {{limiting}} settlement further upriver. Nevertheless, the roots of present-day communities along the river were established during the colonial era. In 1695, a land agent named Isaac See settled at the north bound of Philipse Manor, in the flat land between a <b>bend</b> <b>in</b> the river. Other farmers came to the area, and the settlement ultimately became today's village of Pleasantville.|$|E
5|$|In 1879 {{the bridge}} was taken into public ownership, and in 1885 {{demolished}} and replaced with the existing bridge, designed by Sir Joseph Bazalgette and built by John Mowlem & Co. The narrowest surviving road bridge over the Thames in London, {{it is one of}} London's least busy Thames bridges. The location on a <b>bend</b> <b>in</b> the river makes the bridge a hazard to shipping, and it has been closed many times due to collisions.|$|E
5|$|In 1946, {{there was}} serious {{flooding}} in Salford, {{caused by a}} bottleneck at a <b>bend</b> <b>in</b> the river at Strangeways, {{on the border with}} Manchester. Flooding had been a problem for hundreds of years, and, in 1946, {{the decision was made to}} straighten and widen the river to increase its capacity. Work started in 1951 but it was not until September 1970 that water first flowed through the Anaconda Cut. The total cost of the project was £2m.|$|E

5|$|Responding to this attack, militia Colonel Henry Dodge {{gathered}} {{a force of}} twenty-nine mounted volunteers and set out {{in pursuit of the}} attackers. On June 16, Dodge and his men cornered about eleven of the raiders at a <b>bend</b> <b>in</b> the Pecatonica River. In a brief battle, the Americans killed and scalped all of the Natives. The Battle of Horseshoe Bend (or Battle of Pecatonica) was the first real American victory in the war, and helped restore public confidence in the volunteer militia force.|$|E
5|$|Several other {{significant}} events occurred around 42 Ma, including cessation of metamorphism of the Leech River Schists (resulting from the Metchosin/Crescent Formation being thrust under Vancouver Island) {{and the end}} of strike-slip motion on the Straight Creek Fault; these may reflect the last movement of Siletzia relative to North America. On a broader scale, there was a change in absolute direction of the Pacific plate (marked {{by the end of the}} <b>bend</b> <b>in</b> the Hawaiian-Emperor seamount chain), and a change in the convergence of the Kula plate with the North American plate.|$|E
5|$|The Notre Dame Fighting Irish {{provide much}} of the sports action for the South Bend locale. Football Saturdays have become a major event for the city, {{attracting}} fans who come to watch the game and have tailgate parties. Notre Dame basketball games are also popular, along with other university sports. The College Football Hall of Fame was moved from Kings Mills, Ohio, to downtown South <b>Bend</b> <b>in</b> 1995, though the Hall of Fame relocated to Atlanta, Georgia in 2014.|$|E

50|$|Because {{both the}} arch and the tie are mainly subject to axial forces, their cross {{sections}} {{can be very}} small. Usually, transverse <b>bending</b> <b>in</b> the deck is bigger than <b>bending</b> <b>in</b> longitudinal direction. Therefore, a concrete deck that spans between the arches is a good solution for bridges with arch distances that are not too large. The concrete deck has longitudinal prestressing tendons in the arch planes.|$|R

5|$|The St. Joseph Valley Parkway is {{a freeway}} in the U.S. states of Indiana and Michigan, {{serving as a}} bypass route around Elkhart, Mishawaka, and South <b>Bend</b> <b>in</b> Indiana and Niles in Michigan. The freeway runs {{to the south and}} west of Elkhart and South Bend and Niles and {{consists}} of segments of U.S. Route 31 (US31) and US20; those two highway designations run concurrently at the southwestern rim of the South Bend metropolitan area. It continues north to run along the St. Joseph River valley.|$|E
5|$|The {{accretion}} of Siletzia {{against the}} North American continent approximately 50 {{million years ago}} (contemporaneous with the initiation of the <b>bend</b> <b>in</b> the Hawaiian-Emperor seamount chain) was a major tectonic event associated with a reorganization of the earth's tectonic plates. This {{is believed to have}} a caused a shift in the subduction zone, termination of the Laramide orogeny that was uplifting the Rocky Mountains, and major changes in tectonic and volcanic activity across much of western North America.|$|E
5|$|With {{river traffic}} increasing, damage from barge {{collisions}} increased. By 1972, the Greenville Bridge was hit more times by barges {{than any other}} bridge on the Mississippi. The bridge was located close to a sharp <b>bend</b> <b>in</b> the Mississippi; towboats and barges had difficulty making the sharp turn and regaining their course in time to avoid a collision with the bridge. Over the years many {{have not been able}} to make the turn quickly and have hit it. The bridge had become a danger to river traffic.|$|E
