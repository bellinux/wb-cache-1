25|$|There {{are many}} {{recorded}} fake or counterfeit gold sovereigns in circulation, {{although they are}} still relatively scarce {{in comparison to the}} numbers of genuine coins, due to the difficulty of accurately replicating such a small coin economically. With numismatic fakes, the counterfeiter might use the correct proportions of gold, <b>but</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> replicate an older coin with special rarity value. Such fakes present a potential problem only to the numismatic collector, as they still have standard bullion content.|$|E

500|$|Refn's {{inspiration}} for Drive came partly from reading Grimms' Fairy Tales, and {{his goal was}} to make [...] "a fairy tale that takes Los Angeles as the background," [...] with The Driver as the hero. To play with the common theme of fairy tales, The Driver protects what is good {{while at the same time}} killing degenerate people in violent ways. Refn was also inspired by films such as Point Blank (1967), Two-Lane Blacktop (1971), The Driver (1978) and Thief (1981). Jean-Pierre Melville's crime productions influenced the cinematography. Amini's script propensity imposes [...] "a kind of sideways moral code," [...] where even those who comply with it are almost never rewarded for their efforts, as seen when The Driver helps Standard with Irene and her son's best interests in mind. In their vehicles, the characters not only make escapes or commit murder, <b>but</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> find peace and search for romance.|$|E
2500|$|Recognizing the {{popularity}} of A Walk to Remember as both a novel and film, Sparks [...] "put all [...] thoughts into that, {{trying to make the}} story as different from A Walk to Remember as , <b>but</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> capture the same feelings." [...] Sparks' experiences as a father and as a high school track and field coach also helped shape the plot, and characters Jonah Miller and Will Blakelee are respectively based on Sparks' sons Landon and Miles. Sparks felt Ronnie was the hardest character to write for because he had [...] "never been a 17-year-old, angry teenage girl". Ronnie became a composite character inspired by several young women Sparks has known, such as his nieces. Cyrus herself influenced Ronnie fairly little, although her singing career did inspire the musical elements of the story. Ronnie plays only the piano and Cyrus only sings a small amount in the film, though she does contribute to its soundtrack.|$|E
2500|$|Cornell {{stated in}} a 1996 interview: [...] "I {{know what it}} feels like to be suicidal, and I {{know what it feels}} like to be hopeless. There is some point where I learnt enough about myself to know that I don't have the {{tolerance}} to create other hurdles as well." [...] In 1999, Cornell said about depression, [...] "No one really knows what run-of-the-mill depression is. You'll think somebody has run-of-the-mill depression, and then the next thing you know, they're hanging from a rope. It's hard to tell the difference. But I do feel that depression can be useful. Sometimes it's just chemical. It doesn't seem to come from anywhere. And whenever I've been in any kind of depression, I've over the years tried to not only imagine what it feels like to not be there, <b>but</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> remind myself that I could just wake up the next day and it could be gone because that happens, and not to worry about it. And at the same time, when I'm feeling great, I remember the depression and think about the differences in what I'm feeling and why I would feel that way, and not be reactionary one way or the other. You just have to realize that these are patterns of life and you just go through them." ...|$|E
