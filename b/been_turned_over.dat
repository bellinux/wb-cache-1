5|$|In October 1918, Superb and {{her sister}} ship, , were {{transferred}} to the Mediterranean Fleet and Superb became the flagship of its commander, Vice-Admiral Sir Somerset Gough-Calthorpe, upon her arrival at Mudros on 31 October. The ship led an Allied squadron that entered the Ottoman capital, Constantinople, on 13 November, following the Armistice of Mudros. A month later, Gough-Calthorpe tasked Superb to provide a crew for the , which had <b>been</b> <b>turned</b> <b>over</b> to the Allies by the Germans after the Armistice of 11 November. On 4 December, the ship conveyed Gough-Calthorpe to Odessa, Russia, to inspect the situation there; he made another such visit to Port Said, Egypt, in late March 1919.|$|E
5|$|The rumored Ho-Chunk {{attack on}} Fort Crawford never came, {{and so in}} October 1826, Colonel Snelling moved the {{garrison}} to Fort Snelling, where he hoped to reduce hostilities between the Dakotas (Sioux) and the Ojibwes (Chippewas). The two Ho-Chunk prisoners were also moved to Fort Snelling. In May 1827, after Dakotas attacked an Ojibwe party near Fort Snelling, Colonel Snelling arrested four of the Dakotas and turned {{them over to the}} Ojibwes, who killed them. This angered some Dakotas, who encouraged the Ho-Chunks to help them strike at the Americans, falsely telling them that the Ho-Chunks prisoners had also <b>been</b> <b>turned</b> <b>over</b> to the Ojibwes for execution.|$|E
5|$|Despite that failure, in 1925 {{a similar}} bill passed both the House and Senate, which {{allowed for the}} {{creation}} of the National Capital Parks Commission (NCPC) to oversee the construction of a Fort Circle of parks similar to that proposed in 1919. The NCPC was authorized to begin purchasing land occupied by the old forts, much of which had <b>been</b> <b>turned</b> <b>over</b> to private ownership following the war. Records indicate that the site of Fort Stanton was purchased for a total of $56,000 in 1926. The duty of purchasing land and constructing the fort parks changed hands several times throughout the 1920s and 1930s, eventually culminating with the Department of the Interior and the National Park Service taking control of the project in the 1940s.|$|E
50|$|State Road 334 was {{decommissioned}} by the Indiana Department of Transportation in {{the summer}} of 2011 and <b>turned</b> <b>over</b> to local units of government. The portion within the Town of Whitestown <b>was</b> <b>turned</b> <b>over</b> to it and the portion within the Town of Zionsville <b>was</b> <b>turned</b> <b>over</b> to it.

5000|$|In [...] "Sixty Six Bingo" [...] {{each player}} gets six cards {{and there are}} six common cards. Instead of betting each round, there are betting rounds before any common cards <b>are</b> <b>turned</b> <b>over,</b> after the first two cards <b>are</b> <b>turned</b> <b>over,</b> after {{the third and fourth}} cards <b>are</b> <b>turned</b> <b>over</b> and after the fifth and sixth cards <b>are</b> <b>turned</b> <b>over.</b> If no player claims the pot by being knocked out, then the pot is split between high hand and low hand. If a player's {{remaining}} cards include an ace, then it is possible to be both high hand and low hand.|$|R
2500|$|As {{a part of}} the Vietnamization Program South Vietnamese Navy crewmen were {{assigned}} to the cutter for training purposes beginning in February 1969. After the crew of Point League trained a Vietnamese replacement crew, she <b>was</b> <b>turned</b> <b>over</b> to the Republic of Vietnam Navy as {{a part of the}} Vietnamization Program and recommissioned as RVNS Lê Phước Đức (HQ-700), 16 May 1969 at the Saigon Navy Base.

5|$|Few {{tasks were}} left to {{complete}} when the 1977 construction season began. Most of the pump stations had <b>been</b> <b>turned</b> <b>over</b> to operating personnel by construction workers, and environmental mitigation and cleanup {{was in full swing}} as Alyeska repaired tundra damage caused by construction. Associated-Green, which had performed its construction tasks well, was assigned the job of finishing the final touches on the main pipeline. The last 160 miles of hydrostatic testing were done, 33 remedial welds were completed, and 45 miles of pipe were insulated, among other tasks. Because the pace of construction was much slower than in 1976, fewer workers were needed. Fewer than 11,000 were employed at the peak of 1977 work, about half of 1976's total. On May 31, the final pipeline weld took place.|$|E
5|$|The Grand Fleet sortied on the {{afternoon}} of 23 April 1918 after radio transmissions revealed that the High Seas Fleet was at sea after a failed attempt to intercept the regular British convoy to Norway. The Germans were too far ahead of the British, and no shots were fired. In October, Temeraire and her sister ship, , were transferred to the Mediterranean Fleet, commanded by Vice-Admiral Sir Somerset Gough-Calthorpe. They were part of the squadron that entered the Ottoman capital, Constantinople, on 13 November, following the Armistice of Mudros. A month later, Gough-Calthorpe tasked Temeraire to provide a crew for the , which had <b>been</b> <b>turned</b> <b>over</b> to the Allies by the Germans after the Armistice of 11 November. The ship remained in the Black Sea and Ottoman waters until 3 April 1919, when she departed for home, having visited Sevastopol, Russia, and Haifa, Palestine, during her deployment.|$|E
5|$|After the Austro-Hungarian Empire {{collapsed}} in 1918, the Austrians {{wanted to turn}} the fleet over to the newly created State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs (later {{to become a part}} of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia) in order to prevent the Italians from claiming the ships as spoils of war. However, the victorious Allies refused to acknowledge the conversations between the Austrians and the south Slavs and, in due course, reallocated the ships. The ship had been boarded by a scratch Yugoslav crew on 10 November 1918, one day before the Armistice, and had left Pola along with her sister ship, Radetzky. They were soon spotted by heavy Italian ships, so the two battleships hoisted American flags and sailed south along the Adriatic coast to Castelli Bay near Spalato (also known as Split). They appealed for American naval forces to meet them and accept their surrender, which a squadron of United States Navy (USN) submarine chasers in the area did. She had apparently <b>been</b> <b>turned</b> <b>over</b> to the fledgling south Slav state, as it was a Croat naval officer, Korvettenkapitän Marijan Polić, who presented the ship as a prize of war to representatives of the United States Navy on the afternoon of 22 November 1919 at Spalato (Split) in Dalmatia. Simultaneously she was commissioned as USS Zrínyi and Lieutenant E.E. Hazlett, USN, assumed command. The initial American complement consisted of four officers and 174 enlisted men—the latter entirely composed of United States Navy Reserve Force personnel. The ship remained at anchor at Spalato for nearly a year while the negotiations that would determine her ultimate fate dragged on. Only once did she apparently turn her engines over, and that occurred during a severe gale that struck Spalato on 9 February 1920.|$|E

25|$|It {{is likely}} Luttrell would have <b>been</b> <b>turned</b> <b>over</b> to the Taliban had he descended into the Korangal instead of Shuryek. While the villagers of the Shuryek valley weren't {{considered}} overly friendly to American forces they were nonetheless less hostile than villagers {{in the nearby}} mountainous Chichal (part of neighboring Korangal), with whom the Shuryek villagers have been traditionally been at odds over grazing-land boundaries.|$|E
25|$|The lands {{previously}} {{owned by}} the Navy have <b>been</b> <b>turned</b> <b>over</b> to the U.S. National Fish and Wildlife Service and the authorities of Puerto Rico and Vieques for management. The immediate bombing range area on the eastern tip of the island suffers from severe contamination, but the remaining areas are mostly open to the public, including many beautiful beaches that were inaccessible to civilians while the military was conducting training maneuvers.|$|E
50|$|In 1960 Moriarty Air Force Station was {{transferred}} to the Federal Aviation Administration pending inactivation of the 768th, which was discontinued on 1 June 1961.

50|$|Iowa Highway 965 was {{designated}} on 26 June 1985, replacing a relocated segment of U.S. Route 218. With {{the construction of}} Interstate 380, an adjoining segment of freeway was built south of Interstate 80 around {{the west side of}} Iowa City. When it was finished, US 218 was relocated onto the new segment and onto I-380. In 1994, Iowa 965 <b>was</b> <b>turned</b> <b>over</b> to the city of North Liberty, creating two segments of Iowa 965. On July 1, 2003, the remainder of Iowa 965 in Johnson County <b>was</b> <b>turned</b> <b>over</b> to the county. In 2004, the Linn County section <b>was</b> <b>turned</b> <b>over.</b>|$|R

25|$|Lett earned {{comparisons}} to Pisarcik and the 1978 Giants since his action was as unnecessary and seemed equally inexplicable. It was fourth {{down and the}} ball would have <b>been</b> <b>turned</b> <b>over</b> to Dallas anyway. Coming {{on the heels of}} the previous year's Super Bowl, when a prematurely celebrating Lett had been stripped on a fourth-quarter fumble return as he was about to score a touchdown, the Thanksgiving gaffe cemented his reputation for unthinking play that overshadowed his entire career.|$|E
25|$|Naval Air Station Alameda (NAS), at Alameda Point, {{which was}} {{decommissioned}} in 1997, has <b>been</b> <b>turned</b> <b>over</b> to the City of Alameda for civilian development. The {{area of the}} former NAS {{is now known as}} Alameda Point. In late July 2006, the City of Alameda announced a deal with the Navy that would turn the land over to the city for $108M. The transfer process was initially slowed down by disputes between the Navy and the city regarding payment for environmental cleanup of the land.|$|E
25|$|Snuka was {{the only}} suspect {{involved}} in the subsequent investigation. Although charges were not pressed at the time against Snuka, the case was left officially open. In 1985, Argentino’s parents won a $500,000 default judgment against Snuka in U.S. District Court in Philadelphia. Snuka appears not to have ever paid, claiming financial inability. On June 28, 2013, Lehigh County District Attorney Jim Martin announced that the still-open case would be reviewed by his staff. On January 28, 2014, Martin announced that the case had <b>been</b> <b>turned</b> <b>over</b> to a grand jury.|$|E

25|$|In 1917, {{during an}} {{incident}} {{known as the}} Tulsa Outrage, a group of black-robed Knights of Liberty, a short-lived faction of the Ku Klux Klan, tarred and feathered seventeen members of the IWW in Oklahoma. The IWW members had <b>been</b> <b>turned</b> <b>over</b> to the Knights of Liberty by local authorities after they were convicted {{of the crime of}} not owning war bonds. Five other men who testified in defense of the Wobblies were also fined by the court and subjected to the same torture and humiliations {{at the hands of the}} Knights of Liberty.|$|E
25|$|The 20th century saw {{by far the}} {{greatest}} extent of tunnelling when the Rock {{was turned into a}} huge underground fortress capable of accommodating 16,000 men along with all the supplies, ammunition and equipment needed to withstand a prolonged siege. The tunnelling finally ceased in 1968 when the British Army's last specialist tunnelling unit was disbanded. Since then, the tunnels have progressively <b>been</b> <b>turned</b> <b>over</b> to the civilian Government of Gibraltar, although a number are still owned by the Ministry of Defence and some have been sealed off entirely as they are now too dangerous to enter.|$|E

25|$|By statute {{enacted on}} October 31, 1803, President Thomas Jefferson was {{authorized}} to {{take possession of}} the territories ceded by France and provide for initial governance. A transfer ceremony was held in New Orleans on November 29, 1803. Since the Louisiana territory had never officially <b>been</b> <b>turned</b> <b>over</b> to the French, the Spanish took down their flag, and the French raised theirs. The following day, General James Wilkinson accepted possession of New Orleans for the United States. A similar ceremony was held in St. Louis on March 9, 1804, when a French tricolor was raised near the river, replacing the Spanish national flag. The following day, Captain Amos Stoddard of the First U.S. Artillery marched his troops into town and had the American flag run up the fort's flagpole. The Louisiana territory was officially transferred to the United States government, represented by Meriwether Lewis.|$|E
25|$|Bakunin led {{the corps}} in the Siege of Mogilev, {{part of the}} Battle of Smolensk. On 13 July, Bakunin became {{commander}} of the Soviet troops in Mogilev after rest of the 13th Army withdrew. The city was encircled by the German advance. On 21 July, Bakunin reported that his shells had been expended and requested more ammunition. Disobeying orders from superiors not to retreat, he ordered a breakout for the night of 26 to 27 July {{as a result of}} severe ammunition shortages. Western Front commander Semyon Timoshenko reported on 27 July that Bakunin had <b>been</b> <b>turned</b> <b>over</b> to a military tribunal for his ordering the breakout. Bakunin led 140 others in the escape out of the encirclement. After reaching Soviet lines, he was at the disposal of the Western Front and the Main Personnel Directorate of the People's Commissariat for Defence. In late December Bakunin became a senior lecturer in tactics at the Frunze Military Academy and was then the head of a course.|$|E
25|$|Jamaica station {{would have}} been reconstructed, with {{direct access to the}} New York City Subway and a {{provision}} for express bus service to JFK Airport. Woodside {{would have been}} rehabilitated with provisions for the proposed Queens Bypass subway line that would have run alongside the Main Line before either using the abandoned Rockaway Beach Branch or merging with the IND Queens Boulevard Line at Forest Hills. A provision for express bus service running to LaGuardia Airport via the Brooklyn Queens Expressway would have been made. Service to Grand Central would have been provided with a one track loop, branching off in Sunnyside with a tunnel to 50th Street and Park Avenue. Three stations would have been built; one at 52nd Street between Lexington Avenue and Third Avenue, one under Grand Central Terminal between 45th Street and 47th Street, and a station on Madison Avenue between 35th Street and 37th Street. The line would connect with East River Tunnels at 33rd and 32nd Streets so that trains could continue to Long Island. A provision would have been built for a possible future extension down Madison Avenue. Also, as part of the plan, the Atlantic Branch would have <b>been</b> <b>turned</b> <b>over</b> to the New York City Subway to allow for a lower fare for people commuting to Lower Manhattan, and it would have provided a high speed subway service. This subway service, under the plan, would have ultimately been extended to Belmont Park eliminating the need for LIRR trains to serve local stations between Jamaica and Belmont Park. The whole project would have cost $103,000,000, taking six years to complete.|$|E
