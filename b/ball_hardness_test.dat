40|$|Abstract. The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to analyze the effect of a thermal treatment on the hardness of a Boreal hardwood species. As an undervalued and underutilized tree in Canada, black ash (Fraxinus nigra Marsh.) was selected as one that could potentially benefit from this process. The wood was processed runs in a new high-temperature kiln system being developed in northwestern Ontario, Canada, by Superior ThermowoodW. During the processing, the wood deepened in color from a light brown to a darker brown, similar to that of walnut wood. Defect-free samples of Thermowood black ash were collected from two high-temperature runs (200 C wood temperature) and tested for hardness. Using the Janka <b>ball</b> <b>hardness</b> <b>test,</b> thermally modified black ash displayed average hardness values at 8 % MC (5700 N), 43 % greater than the controls and in the same range as published for untreated wood (5400 – 6000 N). With an improvement in the black ash aesthetic appearance combined with the slight increase in hardness, this species is well suited to be utilized in high-value markets, including flooring and fine furniture...|$|E
40|$|The {{definitions}} {{and types of}} measurement of hardness are reviewed with special reference to the static indentation test. The present state {{of the theory of}} static indentation <b>hardness</b> <b>testing</b> of metals is described, together with previous measurements of the distortions of metal surfaces caused by indenting. Multiple beam interferometry is employed to measure the surface distortions. The apparatus and techniques employed, which include the application of multilayer dielectric films to the interferometrie study of metal surfaces, are described. The specific aspects of the surface distortions studied are: (1) Flow pattern shape, with special reference to the transition from ridging to sinking impressions, and variations due to the geometric shape of the indentation. (2) Volume of the flow pattern. This is found to be smaller than the volume of the indentation for all the indentations studied. Possible explanations of this discrepancy are discussed. (3) Shallowing or elastic recovery of ball indentations. The shallowing of ball indentations {{in a wide range of}} metals is studied, and its variation with load, hardness, and indenter is analysed. (4) The shape of recovered ball indentations. Shallow ball indentations are found to be not strictly spherical, in contrast to deeper ball indentations. Measures of their deviation from sphericity are proposed and an explanation of these deviations is discussed. (5) Critical specimen size. The mode of deformation occurring when a <b>hardness</b> <b>test</b> indentation is made near to the edge of the specimen is studied. The results are compared with the mode of deformation for wedge indentations in ideal and real metals. On the basis of the results a fuller description of the processes involved in <b>ball</b> <b>hardness</b> <b>tests</b> is possible. The surface distortions from the onset of plasticity to the fully plastic stage are described in detail, and support Tabor's theory of ball indentation. The treatment of the <b>hardness</b> <b>test</b> as predominantly a problem in plasticity is justified. <p...|$|R

40|$|The {{sustainability}} of buildings associated {{to the use}} of raw earth has motivated the studies and the development of techniques and methods {{in the context of this}} type of construction. In the region of Huambo, Angola, these construction techniques are widely used, especially for low-income families who represent the majority of the population. Much of the buildings in Huambo province are built with adobe. Due to the climate in this region, subtropical, hot and humid, with altitudes above 1000 meters and extensive river system, these buildings are particularly vulnerable to the action of water and develop, in many situations, early degradation. The Huambo Province is located in central Angola, has 36 km 2 area and approximately 2 million inhabitants. This work aims to evaluate, by conducting in-situ tests, physical and mechanical properties of adobe blocks typically used in the construction of those buildings. The methodology is based on ﬁeld campaigns where in-situ expeditious tests were performed in soils (smell test, color, touch, brightness, sedimentation, <b>ball,</b> <b>hardness,</b> etc.) and <b>tests</b> on adobes blocks made with traditional procedures, particularly in terms of durability and erodibility (erosion test at Geelong method; evaluation test of wet / dry cycle, applying the New Zealand standards 4297 : 1998; 4297 : 1998 and 4297 : 1999). The results will contribute to the characterization of the geomaterials and methods used in construction with earth in Huambo Province, contributing to the improvement of these sustainable solutions, with a strong presence in this region. The results of this study will also contribute to the proposal of constructive solutions with improved performance characteristics, comfort, safety and durability...|$|R

This {{is a more}} fundamental measurement of hardness than other <b>hardness</b> <b>tests</b> {{which are based on}} the surface area of an indentation. The principle behind the test is that the mean pressure required to test the material is the measurement of the hardness of the material. The mean pressure is calculated by dividing the load by the projected area of the indentation. The result is called the Meyer hardness, which has units of megapascals (MPa).|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{sources of}} {{problems}} with a <b>hardness</b> <b>testing</b> machine that are detectable via day-to-day inspection using hardness standard blocks, or indirect verification, can be roughly divided into three: the indenter, the test force, and the indentation measuring apparatus. If any problems are detected, repair or recalibration of the testing machine, focusing on the aforementioned three factors, is carried out {{based on the results}} of verifying the direct accuracies of that machine. These efforts have been accumulated to acquire the high level of <b>hardness</b> <b>testing</b> technology as is available now.
