40|$|The {{nature of}} {{compulsive}} <b>buying</b> behaviour has been thoroughly investigated in “bricks and mortar” retail stores, {{but has not}} yet been sufficiently examined in the online domain. A sample of 299 online consumers completed a survey examining online <b>buying</b> behaviour, compulsive <b>buying</b> tendency, motivations to <b>buy</b> online and recreational Internet use. The study aimed to clarify inconsistencies in the literature regarding differences in compulsive <b>buying</b> tendency on the basis of gender, age, income and <b>buying</b> preference. The study also examined a variety of online <b>buying</b> motivations in relation to compulsive <b>buying</b> tendency. Significant differences in compulsive <b>buying</b> tendency were found on the basis of gender, age and income. No significant difference in compulsive <b>buying</b> tendency was found in relation to <b>buying</b> preference. The motivation to <b>buy</b> online for immediate positive feelings {{was a significant predictor of}} compulsive <b>buying</b> tendency, providing support for theories of compulsive <b>buying</b> that conceptualise this behaviour as a way to escape negative affect and modify subjective mood. An additional investigation into the relationship between Internet addiction and compulsive <b>buying</b> tendency indicated that compulsive <b>buying</b> tendency was significantly associated with excessive Internet use. Limitations and practical implications of the study are discussed...|$|R

40|$|This dissertation's {{objectives}} were to validate impulse <b>buying</b> tendency as a genuinely distinctive construct related to impulse purchase behavior {{and attached to}} fundamental personality traits, and its relationships {{to a number of}} relevant factors. Studies reported were steps {{to a better understanding of}} the impulse <b>buying</b> phenomenon. In the first 2 studies (using Dutch and Indonesian samples), a reliable 20 -item scale to measure impulse <b>buying</b> tendency was developed. The scale has 2 facets represented by correlated subscales, referring to the cognitive (i. e., the lack of planning and deliberation) and affective aspects (i. e., feelings of pleasure and excitement, an urge to <b>buy,</b> the difficulty to leave things, and possible regret afterwards). Correlations with self-reported purchase patterns indicated that high impulse <b>buying</b> tendency resulted in more impulsive purchases with higher impulsivity. Impulse <b>buying</b> tendency was also correlated with several personality-based individual differences. The next study observed impulse <b>buying</b> behavior in actual purchase settings. Impulse <b>buying</b> tendency was correlated with the primary dimensions (MDS analysis) of emotions associated with, and <b>buying</b> considerations of the purchase. Findings verified that these dimensions are stable, with high arousal emotions and impetuous <b>buying</b> considerations related to impulse <b>buying</b> consumption experience. In the 2 final studies (using Norwegian and Indonesian samples) impulse <b>buying</b> tendency scale was validated with the Big Five/Five Factor Model personality dimensions (i. e., Extraversion, Conscientiousness, Agreeableness, Neuroticism/Emotional Stability, and Openness/Autonomy). Results confirmed that impulse <b>buying</b> tendency is a personality-based trait. Indications of gender differences in impulse buying; older people may demonstrate more control on their impulse <b>buying</b> tendency; presence of others may enhance impulse <b>buying</b> behavior; and favorable normative evaluation mediates between impulse <b>buying</b> tendency and the impulsiveness of <b>buying</b> decision; were the other findings. Altogether, they disclose interesting evidence of the intricate nature of impulse <b>buying,</b> a universal, yet culture-bound, phenomenon...|$|R
