Sister Jude knows her to be the Angel of Death, but {{questions}} her about why she has appeared now, instead of the many other times when she attempted suicide: the night her husband left her after she {{told him he had}} infected her with syphilis, leaving her barren, or the night she committed the hit-and-run. Shachath tells her that the other times, she still had hope and purpose, <b>but</b> <b>now</b> <b>she</b> is willing to help Jude find peace. Sister Jude agrees, but says she must do one last thing. She visits the parents of the girl she killed, Missy, claiming to be a nun who found her calling after hearing of Missy's accident. She is intent on telling them the truth, when an adult Missy (Kristin Slaysman) walks into the home, revealing that she had in fact survived the accident. Sister Jude is stunned and the parents recount that they never learned who was responsible, but have made peace with it.|$|E

An anonymous poem about suicide published locally exactly three years after her death is widely attributed to Lincoln. In contrast, his courting of Mary Owens was diffident. In 1837, he wrote to her from Springfield to give her an opportunity to break off their relationship. Lincoln wrote to a friend in 1838: [...] "I knew she was oversize, <b>but</b> <b>now</b> <b>she</b> appeared a fair match for Falstaff".|$|E

The first major event {{sponsored by the}} SCLC was the Prayer Pilgrimage for Freedom in Washington, D.C., on May 17, 1957, the third anniversary of the Brown v. Board of Education decision. From this point forward, Jackson appeared often with King, singing before his speeches and for SCLC fundraisers. In a 1962 SCLC press release, he wrote she had [...] "appeared on numerous programs that helped the struggle in the South, <b>but</b> <b>now</b> <b>she</b> has indicated {{that she wants to}} be involved on a regular basis".

2500|$|New York Times Style section write, Eric Wilson did an {{extensive}} {{study on the}} impact of fashion bloggers on the fashion industry for one of his style columns. Wilson wrote that these bloggers have ascended ‘from the nosebleed seats to the front row’ in the past year and that the divide between the ‘high code’ editors with a professional opinion and the ‘amateur’ fashion bloggers is beginning to disintegrate. [...] Wilson interviewed prominent publicists, editors and designers. Publicist Kelly Cutrone stated that over the past two years, there has been a complete change in who is writing about fashion. Not only does Cutrone say she needs to keep a watch on the editors of mainstream writings, such as Vogue and Elle, <b>but</b> <b>now</b> <b>she</b> needs to monitor on the millions of fashion bloggers around the world. Cutrone goes on the later state that once these bloggers post anything on the internet, it never comes off, and it now becomes the first thing that the designers will see.|$|E

2500|$|The character’s second exit was {{the climax}} to a storyline {{that has been}} {{described}} as one of the show's “most dramatic”. Natalie’s ex-husband Barry remarried and was killed off by his evil new bride Janine Evans (Charlie Brooks) on their honeymoon. The character was embroiled in a bid to uncover Janine as Barry’s killer, and became romantically involved with the character Paul Trueman (Gary Beadle) – Janine’s repentant accomplice in Barry’s downfall, who was also her former lover. A BBC insider said: “Natalie is Janine’s arch rival. She smelt a rat as soon as Janine returned to Walford playing the grieving widow. And she is determined {{to find out what happened}} to Barry and get justice for him.” [...] After discovering the truth from Paul, Natalie realised she was powerless to bring Janine to justice and decided to leave the Square in March 2004. Speed commented “Natalie just wants herself and Jack out of Walford. It's full of bad memories Natalie is devastated by the revelations about Barry's death. She can’t believe Paul still thinks they could be together. She did care for him, <b>but</b> <b>now</b> <b>she</b> knows about his scheming with Janine, he's history. She leaves without saying goodbye to him”. [...] The character returned briefly in May to ensure Janine received her comeuppance and made her final screen appearance on 10 May 2004.|$|E
2500|$|The Velveteen Rabbit or How Toys Become Real was Margery Williams Bianco's first American work, and {{it remains}} her most famous. It has {{remained}} a classic piece of literature through numerous adaptations in children's theatre {{as well as on}} radio, television and in the movies. The author's trademark undercurrents of sentimentality and sadness persist in the tale of a small boy who finds a velveteen rabbit in his Christmas stocking. The boy quickly discards the toy after playing with it for a few hours in the bustle of Christmas and relatives. [...] In the nursery the rabbit is looked down on by the fancier wind up toys. He asks the skin horse, [...] "What is Real?" [...] The skin horse tells him, [...] "When a child loves you for a long, long time, not just to play with, but REALLY loves you, then you become Real." [...] The boy comes to adore the rabbit, and they are constant companions. This happy existence continues until the boy contracts scarlet fever. [...] The rabbit stays with him, whispering to him of the games they will play again when he is better. [...] As the boy gets better his family prepares {{to take him to the}} seaside. Although the rabbit looks forward to the seaside very much, the doctor insists he be thrown out and burned along with the other toys that may be infected. While the rabbit is waiting to be burned, he cries a real tear, from which a fairy emerges. The fairy tells the rabbit that he was real to the boy, because the boy loved him, <b>but</b> <b>now</b> <b>she</b> will make him truly real. [...] Later, the boy sees a real rabbit in the garden. [...] He thinks it looks like his old rabbit, but he does not know that it really is the velveteen rabbit he once loved.|$|E
