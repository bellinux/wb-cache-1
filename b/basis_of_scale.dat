40|$|We {{point out}} that the vector meson S first {{proposed}} by Weyl on the <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>scale</b> invariance is a candidate for dark matter. As colliders are being built with the creation of dark matters among the stated goals, we wish to {{point out that}} one of the possible candidates of dark matter is the vector meson S first conceived by Weyl on the <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>scale</b> invariance 1, 2. Weyl made the mistake of identifying S with the photon. Also, Weyl’s work is incomplete, as he lacked at his time the framework of the theory of quantum electrodynamics. Our formulation of scale invariance yields results 3 different from those of Weyl’s. For example, we find that S does not couple with the electron. It is well-known that Einstein argued that electrons moving in a background of the S field would produce unobserved broading of the atomic spectral lines. That the electron does not interact with S overrides this objection of Einstein. Since Weyl’s theory was first proposed in 1919...|$|E

Experimental results indicate that the SIFT-SS algorithm is efficient for target classification and can obtain a higher recognition rate than affine moment invariants (AMI) and multi-scale auto-convolution (MSA) in some complex situations, such as the situation with the existence of noises and occlusions.

A number of investigations of the last decade have been devoted to the question (first explicitly formulated by Landau) of the singularities of the solutions of Ein-stein’s equations in cosmological models more general than the classical Friedmann model. Special mention should be made (in addition to the ideologically useful but ineffective theorems of Penrose et al.) of the papers by Belinskii, Lifshitz, and Khalatnikov (BLKh) [4], devoted, in particular, to the asymptotic solution of the so-called Bianchi model IX (and also VIII), which they were the first to investigate, when the singularity is approached.

The different parameters of glucose concentration and agitation speed were studied. There are two stages in {{this research}}.

30|$|In this study, the {{properties}} of the continuous wavelet transform are used to extract the necessary features for modulation recognition. The main reason for this choice is due to the capability of this transform to locate, in time and frequency, the instantaneous characteristics of a signal. More simply, the wavelet transform has the special feature of multiresolution analysis (MRA). In the same manner as Fourier transform can be defined as being a projection on the <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> complex exponentials, the wavelet transform is introduced as projection of the signal on the <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>scaled</b> and time-shifted versions of the original wavelet (so-called mother wavelet) in order to study its local characteristics [25]. The importance of wavelet analysis is its scale-time view of a signal which is different from the time-frequency view and leads to MRA.|$|R

40|$|Resource-partitioning theory {{explains}} how, {{in heavily}} concentrated populations, specialist organizations arise and proliferate. The theory also addresses {{the process of}} market concentration itself, although far less attention {{has been devoted to}} the theoretical claims in this area. In this analysis, the theory is used to explain generalist concentration through the distribution of environmental (market) resources. It is argued that the higher the homogeneity and concentration of relevant environmental resources, the higher the concentration of large generalist organizations competing on the <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>scale.</b> Using data on the Dutch daily newspaper industry from 1968 to 1994, statistical analyses show that concentration among generalist (national) newspapers occurs more fully in province-level markets where the readership base consists of relatively homogeneous sets of individuals in terms of age, religion, politics, and education. At the same time, these concentrated markets prove to be fertile areas for the operation of specialist papers, at least when resources are not fully homogenized. The analysis thus provides a more complete model of the resource-partitioning process among organizations in a population...|$|E

It was found that with decreasing sample thickness the life time of the steel decreases due to breakaway phenomena. This effect is caused by faster exhaustion of the chromium reservoir from the bulk alloy {{in the case of}} thinner components. During air exposure the oxidation rates increase with decreasing specimen thickness and this has {{to be taken into account}} in the calculation of the Cr-reservoir exhaustion. This thickness dependence is not found during the exposures in simulated anode gas. Hence, especially for thin walled components, the oxidation rates in anode gas are substantially smaller and thus the life times are longer than during air exposure. The differences in oxidation behaviour in the two environments are discussed on the <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>scale</b> formation mechanisms involving microcrack formation in the surface oxide scale and depletion of major and minor alloying additions in the bulk alloy...|$|E
40|$|Based on {{previous}} empirical research, size {{is perhaps the}} most powerful explanatory organizational covariate in strategic analysis. We suggest that theoretical arguments about size be examined carefully to specify models with explicit comparison sets and with mechanisms linking size and underlying processes to outcomes. We illustrate the approach here by advancing arguments about scale competition within an organizational population. In this effort, we feature a theoretical model of scale-based selection, which posits that a firm's chances of survival decrease with its aggregate distance from larger competitors on a transformed size gradient. The model assumes that the appropriate comparison set consists of all contemporaneous similar organizations competing on the <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>scale</b> and operating in a localized geographic setting. We argue that aggregate distance of a focal firm from larger other firms (a specific form of relative position in the size distribution) reflects {{the extent to which it}} can capitalize on potential competitive advantages of scale emanating from economic, political, and social processes. Analyzing the mortality rates of large organizations across the entire histories of automobile industries in four major countries provides support for the theory.

Analysis of 16 billfish specimens from the western North Atlantic on the <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>scale</b> morphology, anus position, and mitochondrial DNA confirms the validity of this species and extends its distribution. Mid-lateral scales are soft, notably rounded anteriorly, and bear 2 – 3 points distinct {{from those of the}} sympatric longbill spearfish (Tetrapturus pfluegeri Robins and de Sylva, 1963) and white marlin (Tetrapturus albidus Poey, 1860). Position of anus relative to first anal fin and a related morphometric ratio (distance from anus to first anal fin origin: height of first anal fin) are intermediate between T. pfluegeri and T. albidus. These characteristics match those described by Robins (1974) from the four eastern North Atlantic specimens of T. georgii. The mitochondrial ND 4 L, ND 4, and cyt b gene sequences strongly support reciprocal monophyly of the western North Atlantic specimens relative to other Atlantic istiophorids.

40|$|BACKGROUND Understanding the {{dynamics}} of our surrounding environments is a task usually attributed to the detection of motion based on changes in luminance across space. Yet {{a number of other}} cues, both dynamic and static, have been shown to provide useful information about how we are moving and how objects around us move. One such cue, based on changes in spatial frequency, or scale, over time {{has been shown to be}} useful in conveying motion in depth even in the absence of a coherent, motion-defined flow field (optic flow). MATERIAL AND METHODS 16 right handed healthy observers (ages 18 - 28) participated in the behavioral experiments described in this study. Using analytical behavioral methods we investigate the functional specificity of this cue by measuring the ability of observers to perform tasks of heading (direction of self-motion) and 3 D trajectory discrimination on the <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>scale</b> changes and optic flow. RESULTS Statistical analyses of performance on the test-experiments in comparison to the control experiments suggests that while scale changes may be involved in the detection of heading, they are not correctly integrated with translational motion and, thus, do not provide a correct discrimination of 3 D object trajectories. CONCLUSIONS These results have the important implication for the type of visual guided navigation that can be done by an observer blind to optic flow.
