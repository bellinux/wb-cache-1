5|$|Kentish {{manufacture}} before 600 included glass <b>beakers</b> and jewelry. Kentish jewellers {{were highly}} skilled, {{and before the}} end of the sixth century they gained access to gold. Goods from Kent are found in cemeteries across the channel and as far away as at the mouth of the Loire. It is not known what Kent traded for all of this wealth, although it seems likely that there was a flourishing slave trade. It may well be that this wealth was the foundation of Æthelberht's strength, although his overlordship and the associated right to demand tribute would have brought wealth in its turn.|$|E
5|$|The pottery {{as well as}} iron {{mining and}} {{processing}} industries kept developing in Poland throughout the Roman periods, until terminated in the 5th century or so by the Great Migration. Clay pots were still often formed manually and these were more crude, while the better ones were made with the potter's wheel, used {{beginning in the early}} 3rd century. Some had inscriptions engraved, but their meaning, if any, is not known (Germanic people had occasionally used the runic alphabets). Wide-open, vase type Przeworsk culture urn from the 2nd century AD found in Biała, Zgierz County is covered with representations from Celtic and Germanic mythology, such as deer, horse riders, crosses and swastikas. The 3rd and 4th century buckets were made of wood and reinforced with bronze braces and sheets. Przeworsk culture's large globular clay storage containers from the 3rd and 4th century were 60cm to over one meter tall. The 4th and 5th century ceramic specimens from the late phase of this culture include pitchers, clay pails, <b>beakers</b> and bowls.|$|E

50|$|A <b>beaker</b> {{is a small}} ceramic {{or metal}} {{drinking}} vessel shaped {{to be held in}} the hands. Archaeologists identify several different types including the butt <b>beaker,</b> the claw <b>beaker</b> and the rough-cast <b>beaker,</b> however when used alone the term usually refers to the pottery cups associated with the European <b>Beaker</b> culture of the late Neolithic and early Bronze Age.|$|R

25|$|The Beaker {{group in}} {{northern}} Jutland forms an integrated {{part of the}} western European Beaker Culture, while western Jutland provided {{a link between the}} Lower Rhine area and northern Jutland. The local fine-ware pottery of Beaker derivation reveal links with other Beaker regions in western Europe, most specifically the Veluwe group at the Lower Rhine. Concurrent introduction of metallurgy shows that some people must have crossed cultural boundaries. Danish <b>Beakers</b> are contemporary with the earliest Early Bronze Age (EBA) of the East Group of Bell <b>Beakers</b> in central Europe, and with the floruit of Beaker cultures of the West Group in western Europe. The latter comprise Veluwe and Epi-Maritime in Continental northwestern Europe and the Middle Style <b>Beakers</b> (Style 2) in insular western Europe. The interaction between the Beaker groups on the Veluwe Plain and in Jutland must, at least initially, have been quite intensive. All-over ornamented (AOO) and All-over-corded (AOC), and particularly Maritime style <b>beakers</b> are featured, although from a fairly late context and possibly rather of Epi-maritime style, equivalent to the situation in the north of the Netherlands, where Maritime ornamentation continued after it ceased in the central region of Veluwe and were succeeded c. 2300 BC by <b>beakers</b> of the Veluwe and Epi-Maritime style.|$|E
25|$|The {{cultural}} concepts originally {{adopted from}} Beaker {{groups at the}} lower Rhine blended or integrated with local Late Neolithic Culture. For a while the region was set apart from central and eastern Denmark, that evidently related more closely to the early Únětice culture across the Baltic Sea. Before {{the turn of the}} millennium the typical Beaker features had gone, their total duration being 200–300 years at the most. A similar picture of cultural integration is featured among Bell <b>Beakers</b> in central Europe, thus challenging previous theories of Bell <b>Beakers</b> as an elitist or purely super-structural phenomenon. The connection with the East Group <b>Beakers</b> of Únětice had intensified considerably in LN II, thus triggering a new social transformation and innovations in metallurgy that would announce the actual beginning of the Northern Bronze Age.|$|E

25|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the <b>beakers</b> were designed for the consumption of alcohol, and that the introduction of the substance to Europe may have fuelled the beakers' spread.

Some were used as reduction pots to smelt copper ores, others have some organic residues associated with food, and still others were employed as funerary urns. They were used as status display amongst disparate elites.|$|E

40|$|The Bell <b>Beaker</b> is {{a culture}} of the Final Neolithic, which spread across Europe between 2900 and 1800 BC. Since its origin is still widely discussed, we have been {{focusing}} our analysis on {{the transition from the}} Final Neolithic pre-Bell <b>Beaker</b> to the Bell <b>Beaker.</b> We thus seek to evaluate the importance of Neolithic influence in the establishment of the Bell <b>Beaker</b> by studying the common ware pottery and its chronology. Among the 26 main types of common ware defined by Marie Besse (2003), we selected the most relevant ones in order to determine—on the basis of their absolute dating—their appearance either in the Bell <b>Beaker</b> period or in the pre-Bell <b>Beaker</b> groups.

25|$|Archaeologists {{working at}} Cahokia, the largest Mississippian culture {{settlement}} {{located near the}} modern city of St. Louis, found distinctive and relatively rare pottery <b>beakers</b> dating from 1050 to 1250 CE. The <b>beakers</b> are small round pots with a handle {{on one side and}} a tiny lip on the opposing side. The surfaces of the unfired vessels was incised with motifs representing water and the underworld and resemble the whelk shells known to have been used for the consumption of the beverage during historic times. The inside of the vessels were found to be coated with a plant residue, which when tested was found to contain theobromine, caffeine and ursolic acid in the right proportions to have come from the Ilex vomitoria. The presence of the black drink in the Greater Cahokia area at this early date pushes back the definitive use of the black drink by several centuries. The presence of the black drink hundreds of miles outside of its natural range on the East and Gulf coasts is evidence of a substantial trade network with the southeast, a trade that also involved sharks teeth and whelk shells.|$|E
25|$|At present no {{internal}} chronology for {{the various}} Bell Beaker-related styles has been achieved yet for Iberia. Peninsular corded Bell <b>Beakers</b> are usually found in coastal or near coastal regions in three main regions: the western Pyrenees, the lower Ebro and adjacent east coast, and the northwest (Galicia and northern Portugal). A corded-zoned Maritime variety (C/ZM), proposed to be a hybrid between AOC and Maritime Herringbone, was mainly found in burial contexts and expanded westward, especially along the mountain systems of the Meseta.|$|E
50|$|The {{early part}} of the Bronze Age was marked by <b>Beaker</b> burials, {{characteristic}} of the <b>Beaker</b> people. The <b>Beaker</b> graves contained various funerary goods and were usually covered by round barrows; however, most of these barrows did not survive, making the graves hard to locate. It is assumed that these <b>Beaker</b> burials are located mostly to the west, in areas marked by older long or oval barrows. Also, mounds were later erected over some of the preexisting <b>Beaker</b> graves, enabling early excavators to locate them.|$|R

25|$|Among {{the most}} {{important}} finds in the eastern mound were many fragments of decorated bronze panels with a dancing warrior carrying a spear.

25|$|Ancient sites abound {{throughout}} {{the length of}} the River Medway. The area around Aylesford is a particularly important Stone Age site: the Medway megaliths are a group of Neolithic chamber tombs including the Coldrum Stones and Kit's Coty House.

They created thirteen distinct colors, the larger palette found in Pre-Columbian ceramics in the Americas, which included rare pale purple, maroon, and bluish-grey. Nasca artists created ceremonial and utilitarian bowls and <b>beakers,</b> effigy jars, panpipes, and vessels of new designs, including the stepped-fret. These combined sculptural elements with surface painting, often with curvilinear designs emphasized by bold, black outlining. Painters used revolving turntables to paint all sides of a ceramic piece.|$|E
