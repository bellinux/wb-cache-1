40|$|Graduation date: 1971 The {{relative}} freezing {{resistance of}} tissues in the stem, foliage and buds of terminal twigs from Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco) was investigated at about ten-day intervals from summer {{until the following}} spring. Tissues from growing twigs collected before development of dormancy had no freezing resistance and were killed immediately after subcooling. Tissues {{at the base of}} inner bud scales and in the pith of stems at the base of buds were among the last to harden in autumn. Pith parenchyma and pith rays of the interfascicular region of the <b>bud</b> <b>trace</b> and the transfusion tissue in needles were most susceptible to injury after development of freezing resistance. Abaxial mesophyll was more susceptible to injury than adaxial mesophyll of hardened needles. The cortex was more resistant than other tissues during development of freezing resistance but parenchyma of the pith lost freezing resistance more slowly and was more resistant after growth processes resumed in the spring. The phloem-cambium region of the stem lost freezing resistance earlier and became more susceptible to injury than other tissues of the twig after midwinter 0 Survival of the vegetative apex depended on the ability of its water to subcool. Heat of fusion of water on freezing produced a sharp exotherm that was a precise index of the temperature at death and freezing resistance of the vegetative apex. Prolonged subfreezing temperatures after development of freezing resistance in late autumn increased hardiness of twigs beyond that induced by the natural environment 6 Both formation of ice in the pith of stems enclosed by coriaceous bud scales, and artificial dehydration reduced water content and promoted subcooling and freezing resistance of vegetative apices. Moisture content was reduced from 200 to 70 percent on a dry weight basis after three days at _ 90 C in early February and freezing resistance of apices increased 0 0 0 from - 16 C to - 20 C when cooled at 1 C per minute 0 These findings suggested that diffusion of water from the protoplasm to sites of extracellular ice, and not low temperature, was the direct cause of hardening at subfreezing temperatures 0 The basic freezing curve for Douglas-fir is characteristic of plant tissues in general but was modified by exotherms associated with freezing and death of vegetative apices from November until April. A decline n length of the plateau after the second subcooling temperature during hardening, and increase in length of the plateau during loss of hardiness reflected probable seasonal change in quantity of intracellular water. Unhardened tissues survived freezing of extracellular water but were injured before intracellular water was completely frozen. Hardened tissues, on the other hand, were not injured until after most of the intracellular water was frozen and the cooling rate of the stem returned to normal. Observations suggested a definite relationship between time of acquisition and loss of freezing resistance and number of days to bud burst after March 31. Trees which developed freezing resistance earliest in fall broke buds earliest in spring. Trees which broke buds latest in spring were also those which were the last to deharden, Ready availability of potassium appears to enhance early development and loss of freezing resistance. Trees with the highest content of potassium in the current season's foliage burst buds earliest and those with the lowest content of potassium were the last to burst buds. Night temperatures of 20 C delayed but did not prevent loss of hardiness when day temperatures were 250 C in March. However, continuous temperature of 2 ° C failed to reharden twigs that had lost freezing resistance at 25 ° C. Injury to all tissues, except the vegetative apex, declined at 250 C in March when moisture stress exceeded a critical level. These observations suggest that environ mental conditions unfavorable for growth enable Douglas-fir to maintain resistance to injury from spring frosts...|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{application}} of heat {{on the development}} of graft unions in dormant Picea sitchensis (Bong.) Carr (Sitka spruce) was observed at monthly intervals from October to March. No advantage over controls was gained in terms of final graft success rates. It is sug-gested that this may have been a result of the mild winter conditions {{during the course of the}} experiment, which enabled callus formation to occur in unheated controls. On the other hand, scions of grafts which had been heated for 3 weeks, and then returned to ambient conditions showed considerably greater growth than unheated controls during the following spring and summer. The amount of extension depended on how late in the winter the graft had been prepared and heated, with least growth by grafts made in October, and most by grafts made in March. Microscopical examination showed that callus forma-tion was more rapid in heated grafts than in controls, although callus formation occurred in all control grafts examined. Heat also induced cambial reactivation and tracheid formation, particularly in the vicinity of needle or <b>bud</b> <b>traces</b> in the scion. In keeping with this, it was found that the presence of needles and buds was essential for cambial reactivation in normal dormant stems and that reactivation was restricted to the heated region...|$|R

40|$|Cacti (Cactaceae) {{represent}} {{a family of}} highly specialized angiosperm plants with a native range of distribution restricted to the American continents. Columnar cacti of the sub-family Cactoideae evolved in adaptation to their arid or semi-arid habitats characteristics that distinguish them from most other dicot plants, e. g. the stem succulence with a strongly vascularized storage parenchyma {{and the presence of}} the spine wearing areoles. Although cacti have been in cultivation since the discovery of America, some studies even suggest the agricultural use in pre-colombian times, and many scientific investigations were carried out on the functional morphology and anatomy with regard to biomechanical adaptations of the found structures, no research focused on the branch-stem attachment. The most conspicuous features of such a ramification are the pronounced constrictions at the branch-stem junctions that are also present in the lignified vascular structures within the succulent cortex. Based on Finite Element Analyses of ramification models it could be demonstrated that these indentations in the region of high flexural and torsional stresses are not regions of structural weakness, e. g. allowing vegetative propagation. On the contrary, they can be regarded as anatomical adaptations to increase the stability by fine-tuning the stress state and stress directions in the junction along prevalent fiber directions. The development of the woody support structure within the succulent cortex of the parental shoot {{can be traced back to}} the leaf and <b>bud</b> <b>traces</b> of the dormant axillary buds. Surprisingly, these initials also develop into another woody structure supporting the flowers of the cacti. As these two support structures differ significantly in their macroscopic and microscopic anatomy and as they develop from the same initial state as leaf/bud traces, another objective of this work was to analyze the secondary growth of the two structures with traditional botanic investigation methods. The results of these investigations reveal a wood dimorphism consisting of an early parenchymatous phase followed later by fibrous wood in both kind of support structure. In vegetative branches, the woody support structures have the typical ringlike arrangement as found in the stele of the parental shoot, whereas the flower support structures have a reticular arrangement of interconnected woody strands. This fundamentally different anatomy of the support structures results from the formation of an interfascicular cambium between the leaf/bud traces when a vegetative branch forms or its absence in the case of a flower. After shedding light on the functional morphology and anatomy of the cactus ramification and their development the question arises if the found load adaptation strategies may serve to improve technical fiber composite structures analogue to the design recommendation developed from the biomechanical analyses of tree ramifications. Such a biomimetic transfer from the cactus ramification as biological role model to a technical implementation and the adaptation of the fine-tuned geometric shape and arrangement of lignified strengthening tissues might contribute to the development of alternative concepts for branched fiber-reinforced composite structures within a limited design space...|$|R

Gray is friends with Bud Leonard (played by Raymond Hackett), a young man who can not stand prison for he is in love with Mary Dane (played by Bernice Claire) and misses her terribly. To make matters worse, while Hackett is in prison, the man who framed him, played by Lou Rinaldo (played by Maurice Black), is making a play for Mary. When she tempts Bud to escape he is ready to run the risk although it may mean his death. The two plan to meet each other when Hackett discloses to her that he is being sent to work on the road gang. Mary manages to get work at a farmhouse where the convicts usually eat, hoping to thereby see <b>Bud.</b> Rinaldo <b>traces</b> her to the house and schemes to get Hackett out of the way so he can have her instead. Rinaldo convinces Hackett and yet another prisoner ("King Callahan", played by Ralph Ince) whom Rinaldo had framed that now is the time to escape in the hope that he can have them caught in the attempt. Mary prevents Hackett's escape but Callahan falls for the trick. Callahan later shoots Rinaldo and is himself killed. To save Bud, who is supposed to be released soon, Gray informs against Rinaldo, although the evidence he provides will lead to an extra prison term for him. Gray is happy to make the sacrifice, knowing that Mary will be with the man she truly loves.|$|R
40|$|Morphology, age {{structure}} {{and growth of}} sprouts in Hamabiwa (Litsea japonica Juss.) growing in a coastal dwarf forest in northern Kyushu were investigated, and timing of sprouting was discussed in relation to activities of terminal buds. Sprouts of Hamabiwa were collected and morphologyo f sprouts and their primordia were observed. On the stem surfaces of Hamabiwa, there were numerous suppressed <b>buds</b> with vascular <b>traces</b> connected to the pith. Similar vascular traces were observed {{at the base of}} sprouting positions. So, the primordia of sprouts in Hamabiwa were assumed to be suppressed buds. 67 sprouts from six clumps were randomly sampled for {{age structure}} analysis, Although there were large fluctuations in the frequency distribution of sprout age, sprouts existed in most age classes. The frequency distribution showed a gentle inverse-J shape indicating a high survival rate of sprouts. Disks of stems of one clump with 7 sprouts were sampled for stem growth and sprouting analysis. Sprouting was observed in years when the height growth rate declined or in the following years. This result suggested that sprouting was closely related to the activity of terminal buds. However, there was no significant relationship between sprouting and volume or radial growth rates. From these results, it was suggested that Hamabiwa growing in a coastal dwarf forest flushes sprouts constantly due to stress at terminal buds, and maintains their population at sites where seedlings are difficult to establish. 本研究では，海岸風衝低木林に生育するハマビワの萌芽幹の齢構成と成長を調査し，萌芽の発生を頂芽の活性に関連させて考察した．海岸風衝林群落内からハマビワの萌芽幹を採取し，萌芽の形態を観察した．また萌芽株 6 個体を任意に抽出し，成長錐で全萌芽幹（ 67 本）のコアを採取して萌芽幹の樹齢を調査した．また，その中で 7 本の萌芽幹をもつ株を伐倒し， 20 cm間隔で円盤を採取して樹幹解析を行った．ハマビワの樹幹表面には髄まで連結する維管束状の組織を持つ抑制芽が存在した．萌芽発生部位にも抑制芽と同様な維管束状の組織が観察された．したがって，ハマビワの萌芽の原基は腋芽由来の抑制芽であると考えられた．萌芽の樹齢頻度分布は，樹齢による変動が大きいもののほぼ連続しており，萌芽が常時発生していることが示された．さらに，萌芽の樹齢頻度分布は緩やかな逆J型を呈し，萌芽の生残率が高いことを示した．萌芽の発生は伸長成長が低下した年あるいはその翌年にみられた．この結果は，常時塩風にさらされる海岸風衝林において，頂芽の活性と萌芽の発生が密接に関連する事を示唆していた．しかし，萌芽の発生と材積成長，肥大成長との関連は明瞭には認められなかった．これらの結果から，海岸風衝林に生育するハマビワは，頂芽にストレスを受けることによって抑制芽からほぼ連続的に萌芽を発生し，実生の定番が困難な立地で個体群を維持していると考えられた...|$|R

40|$|At {{the outset}} of the investigation, it was hoped to {{elucidate}} details of meiosis and fertilisation in dioecious and monoecious monocotyledons, with especial reference to the possible presence of sex chromosomes. The chromosomes of the dioecious and monoecious forms examined however, have not lent themselves to such a study, whereas the chromosomes of the hermaphrodite Scilla nonscripta, have proved especially interesting. This plant has therefore latterly been studied almost to the exclusion of others. Scilla nonscripta. The chromosomes during mitosis and meiosis are conceived as always consisting of at least two regularly intertwined spiral chromonemata. An attempt has been made to harmonise this conception, already held by many writers for mitosis, with the appearances observed at meiosis. At fertilisation, the egg nucleus is usually resting and the male nucleus is in a condition corresponding to late prophase. The membrane between the two nuclei breaks down and the reticulum from the male nucleus gradually spreads through the egg nucleus. The fusion of the second male nucleus with the two polar nuclei is similar. In all the divisions of the endosperm nuclei studied, the chromosome complements from the male and polar nucleiremain separate, but a mingling of the two chromosome complements in the nucleus of the embryo begins to occur after the first division.
