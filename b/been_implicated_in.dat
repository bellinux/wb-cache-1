5|$|An RNA {{thermometer}} (or RNA thermosensor) is a temperature-sensitive non-coding RNA molecule which regulates gene expression. RNA thermometers often regulate genes required during {{either a}} heat shock or cold shock response, but have <b>been</b> <b>implicated</b> <b>in</b> other regulatory roles {{such as in}} pathogenicity and starvation.|$|E
5|$|Disease. Increased {{disease in}} wild populations often follows {{weakening}} from other environmental stressors, such as habitat loss. Upper lung infection and shell diseases have <b>been</b> <b>implicated</b> <b>in</b> {{the decline of}} the desert tortoise (California, Nevada) and gopher tortoise (Georgia, Florida's state tortoise).|$|E
5|$|Due to {{its role}} in {{generating}} the activated form of NF-κB, an anti-apoptotic and pro-inflammatory regulator of cytokine expression, proteasomal activity {{has been linked to}} inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Increased levels of proteasome activity correlate with disease activity and have <b>been</b> <b>implicated</b> <b>in</b> autoimmune diseases including systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis.|$|E

5|$|Low immune {{function}} has also <b>been</b> <b>implicated</b> <b>in</b> endometrial cancer. High {{blood pressure is}} also a risk factor, but {{this may be because}} of its association with obesity. Sitting regularly for prolonged periods is associated with higher mortality from endometrial cancer. The risk is not negated by regular exercise, though it is lowered.|$|E
5|$|At nest sites, battles {{sometimes}} {{occur between}} {{two or more}} pairs before the original owners declare themselves {{as the owner of}} the nest. Red-billed tropicbirds are aggressive at nest sites, fighting with each other and ousting species such as shearwaters, petrels, and white-tailed tropicbirds. They have also been recorded taking over nests of white-tailed tropicbirds and raising their young if they failed to destroy their eggs. Vagrant red-billed tropicbirds have <b>been</b> <b>implicated</b> <b>in</b> egg loss in red-tailed tropicbird nests in Hawaii.|$|E
5|$|Fruit and vegetables, {{particularly}} leafy vegetables, have <b>been</b> <b>implicated</b> <b>in</b> {{nearly half}} the gastrointestinal infections caused by norovirus in the United States. These foods are commonly eaten raw and may become contaminated during their preparation by an infected food handler. Hygiene is important when handling foods to be eaten raw, and such products need to be properly cleaned, handled, and stored to limit contamination.|$|E
50|$|Faulty SCSRs <b>were</b> <b>implicated</b> <b>in</b> the Sago Mine disaster.|$|R
50|$|Mutations <b>in</b> {{keratinocyte}} transglutaminase <b>are</b> <b>implicated</b> <b>in</b> lamellar ichthyosis.|$|R

5|$|In {{almost all}} cases, {{symptoms}} resolve within a week. Fatalities are extremely unlikely. No deaths {{have been reported}} since the introduction of antivenom in 1956. Before this, redback spider bites had <b>been</b> <b>implicated</b> <b>in</b> at least 14 deaths in Australia, however these cases cannot be definitively linked to the Redback bite as the sole cause.|$|E
5|$|In {{the form}} of {{chloride}} ions, chlorine is necessary to all known species of life. Other types of chlorine compounds are rare in living organisms, and artificially produced chlorinated organics range from inert to toxic. In the upper atmosphere, chlorine-containing organic molecules such as chlorofluorocarbons have <b>been</b> <b>implicated</b> <b>in</b> ozone depletion. Small quantities of elemental chlorine are generated by oxidation of chloride to hypochlorite in neutrophils {{as part of the}} immune response against bacteria.|$|E
5|$|Many {{psychological}} mechanisms have <b>been</b> <b>implicated</b> <b>in</b> {{the development}} and maintenance of schizophrenia. Cognitive biases {{have been identified in}} those with the diagnosis or those at risk, especially when under stress or in confusing situations. Some cognitive features may reflect global neurocognitive deficits such as memory loss, while others may be related to particular issues and experiences.|$|E
50|$|Mutations <b>in</b> CCND3 <b>are</b> <b>implicated</b> <b>in</b> {{cases of}} breast cancer.|$|R

5|$|Mephedrone has <b>been</b> <b>implicated</b> <b>in</b> {{the death}} of a 22-year-old male, who had also {{injected}} black tar heroin. Mephedrone was found in his blood at a concentration of 0.50mg/L and in his urine at a concentration of 198mg/L. The blood concentration of morphine, a metabolite of heroin, was 0.06mg/L. For comparison, the average blood morphine concentration resulting from deadly overdoses involving only heroin is around 0.34mg/L.|$|E
5|$|Not all {{interactions}} {{between humans and}} cattle egrets are beneficial. The cattle egret can be a safety hazard to aircraft due to its habit of feeding in large groups in the grassy verges of airports, and it has <b>been</b> <b>implicated</b> <b>in</b> the spread of animal infections such as heartwater, infectious bursal disease and possibly Newcastle disease.|$|E
5|$|The argasid tick Hyalomma marginatum {{was found}} in pale crag martin nests on a {{sarcophagus}} and an ancient tomb in Egypt. This tick has <b>been</b> <b>implicated</b> <b>in</b> the transmission of Bahig virus, a pathogenic arbovirus previously thought to be transmitted only by mosquitoes. Another argasid tick, Argas africolumbae, {{was found in}} a nest of the closely related rock martins in Kenya. The nasal mite Ptilonyssus echinatus {{was found in a}} pale crag martin in the Tibesti Mountains of northern Chad.|$|E
50|$|The {{carcinogenic}} {{potential of the}} MAPK pathway makes it clinically significant. It <b>is</b> <b>implicated</b> <b>in</b> cell processes {{that can lead to}} uncontrolled growth and subsequent tumor formation. Mutations within this pathway alter its regulatory effects on cell differentiation, proliferation, survival, and apoptosis, all of which <b>are</b> <b>implicated</b> <b>in</b> various forms of cancer.|$|R
50|$|Bloodfeeding leeches <b>are</b> <b>implicated</b> <b>in</b> the {{transmission}} of the bloodborne species.|$|R

5|$|The first {{symptoms}} of neuroblastoma are often vague making diagnosis difficult. Fatigue, loss of appetite, fever, and joint pain are common. Symptoms depend on primary tumor locations and metastases if present: Germline mutations in the PHOX2A or KIF1B gene have <b>been</b> <b>implicated</b> <b>in</b> familial neuroblastoma as well. Neuroblastoma {{is also a}} feature of neurofibromatosis type 1 and the Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome.|$|E
5|$|The gene TGFBR2 has <b>been</b> <b>implicated</b> <b>in</b> several {{connective}} tissue disorders including Marfan syndrome, arterial tortuosity, and thoracic aortic aneurysm. A study {{of patients with}} SCSFLS demonstrated no mutations in this gene. Minor features of Marfan syndrome {{has been found in}} 20% of CSF leak patients. Abnormal findings of fibrillin-1 has been documented in these CSF-leak patients, but only one patient demonstrated a fibrillin-1 defect consistent with Marfan syndrome.|$|E
5|$|The {{woman who}} {{achieved}} the greatest {{prominence in the}} ancient world for her learning was Hypatia of Alexandria, who educated young men in mathematics, philosophy, and astronomy, and advised the Roman prefect of Egypt on politics. Her influence put her into conflict with the bishop of Alexandria, Cyril, who may have <b>been</b> <b>implicated</b> <b>in</b> her violent death in 415 {{at the hands of a}} Christian mob.|$|E

50|$|Cholinergic systems <b>are</b> <b>implicated</b> <b>in</b> {{numerous}} neurologic functions. Alteration in some cholinergic neurons {{may account}} for the disturbances of Alzheimer disease. The protein encoded by this gene synthesizes the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. Acetylcholine acts at two classes of receptors in the central nervous system - muscarinic and nicotinic - which <b>are</b> each <b>implicated</b> <b>in</b> different physiological responses. The role of acetylcholine at the nicotinic receptor is still under investigation. It <b>is</b> likely <b>implicated</b> <b>in</b> the reward/reinforcement pathways, as indicated by the addictive nature of nicotine, which also binds to the nicotinic receptor. The muscarinic action of acetylcholine <b>in</b> the CNS <b>is</b> <b>implicated</b> <b>in</b> learning and memory. The loss of cholinergic innervation in the neocortex has been associated with memory loss, as is evidenced in advanced cases of Alzheimer's disease. In the peripheral nervous system, cholinergic neurons <b>are</b> <b>implicated</b> <b>in</b> the control of visceral functions such as, but not limited to, cardiac muscle contraction and gastrointestinal tract function.|$|R
5|$|Disturbance has <b>been</b> <b>implicated</b> <b>in</b> the {{formation}} of vegetation dominated by large Attalea species. In seasonally dry Amazonian forests the density of large adult A.maripa palms was correlated with canopy openness; the species also dominates savannas formed by repeated forest fires in Trinidad and Tobago. Attalea speciosa forms pure stands {{in many parts of}} Brazil where natural forest vegetation has been cleared. Similarly, stands of A.funifera in Bahia, Brazil (which are cultivated for piassava fibre) are managed using fire—the seedlings survive cutting and burning, and are able to dominate burned forest patches.|$|E
5|$|Glycerophospholipids, usually {{referred}} to as phospholipids, are ubiquitous in nature and are key components of the lipid bilayer of cells, {{as well as being}} involved in metabolism and cell signaling. Neural tissue (including the brain) contains relatively high amounts of glycerophospholipids, and alterations in their composition has <b>been</b> <b>implicated</b> <b>in</b> various neurological disorders. Glycerophospholipids may be subdivided into distinct classes, based {{on the nature of the}} polar headgroup at the sn-3 position of the glycerol backbone in eukaryotes and eubacteria, or the sn-1 position in the case of archaebacteria.|$|E
5|$|Grasshoppers are {{affected}} by diseases caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi and protozoa. The bacteria Serratia marcescens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa have both <b>been</b> <b>implicated</b> <b>in</b> causing disease in grasshoppers, as has the entomopathogenic fungus Beauveria bassiana. This widespread fungus {{has been used to}} control various pest insects around the world, but although it infects grasshoppers, the infection is not usually lethal because basking in the sun has the result of raising the insect's temperature above a threshold tolerated by the fungus. The fungal pathogen Entomophaga grylli is able to influence the behaviour of its grasshopper host, causing it to climb {{to the top of a}} plant and cling to the stem as it dies. This ensures wide dispersal of the fungal spores liberated from the corpse.|$|E
