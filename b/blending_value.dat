40|$|This {{paper is}} offered {{not as a}} fully {{comprehensive}} survey of the emerging area of <b>blended</b> <b>value</b> investing, {{but rather as a}} set of examples of how such investing practices are being developed and applied around the world. The paper's intent is not to provide a single answer for all investment challenges, but to demonstrate how groups of investors are mobilizing capital on new terms {{to meet the challenges of}} emerging investment opportunities, as well as the demands of investors seeking out new asset classes in which to place their capital. This paper presents innovations in capital finance that promise to bridge market-rate interests with strategic opportunities to create <b>blended</b> <b>value</b> that benefits shareholder and stakeholder alike. The following examples speak to an evolving capital convergence wherein mainstream capital markets and investing will increasingly become drivers of new solutions to historic problems. <b>Blended</b> <b>value</b> investing funds and instruments offer financing strategies a set of tools that go beyond traditional philanthropy or market rate investing and which complement the vision we all share of a world with greater equity and opportunity for its members. This paper also identifies several areas of research that would help advance the field of <b>blended</b> <b>value</b> investing. Finally, the paper concludes with words of caution that suggest a prudent approach to developing <b>blended</b> <b>value</b> capital markets.

An example is a fair trade coffee cooperative, which creates social value through the guaranteed minimum prices paid to coffee farmers and direct community development investments. Their model's ability to yield <b>blended</b> <b>value</b> depends on its financial viability. <b>Blended</b> <b>value</b> suggests that all 3 components (social, financial, and environmental) must be integrated into any value assessment.Another example is a social enterprise such as Aravind Eye Hospital.

40|$|In March 2006, The World Economic Forum {{published}} <b>Blended</b> <b>Value</b> Investing: Capital Opportunities for Social and Environmental Impact. That paper, {{written by}} Jed Emerson and Joshua Spitzer, presented and explored {{the notion that}} between market-rate financial investments and philanthropy lie investment opportunities that intentionally create both financial returns and environmental and social value. These investment instruments seek not simply to balance extra-financial value with financial value, to avoid doing harm, or to add token social responsibility to financial investing (as is true of many ‘double bottom line’ funds); rather they pursue a sustained <b>blending</b> of <b>value</b> creation – in financial, environmental and other dimensions. That paper presented 12 case studies of funds and investment instruments in this <b>blended</b> <b>value</b> investing category {{with a focus on}} global economic and social value creation more than environmental value creation. In the autumn of 2006, The William and Flora Hewlett Foundation funded a new exploration of <b>blended</b> <b>value,</b> this time focused more specifically on the area of environmental and conservation finance. Many innovations are advancing the field of environmental finance, many of these strategies have been well documented in a variety of articles, books and websites. Nevertheless, for many asset owners and managers, creating blended financial and environmental returns still remains a difficult goal to attain. These actors continue to ask questions regarding the types of investment option before them, the degree (if any) to which they carry a financial penalty, {{and the nature of the}} environmental value created (among other questions). Accordingly, this paper offers a broad overview of various real estate-based investment instruments and funds that are structured to generate financial returns while simultaneously advancing environmental value. The specific audience for this paper includes foundation executives seeking to move beyond traditional grantmaking, as well as high-net-worth individuals and other asset trustees working to understand options for pursuing full, <b>blended</b> <b>value</b> investments – namely, those that create a defined level of economic value combined with environmental impact. This inquiry introduces frameworks for approaching <b>blended</b> <b>value</b> investments, and it raises a series of questions potential investors will probably ask. While the authors believe these investments will ultimately prove viable and efficient, this inquiry stops short of comparing these <b>blended</b> <b>value</b> investments to more traditional alternatives. In the absence of further data, the authors cannot assert that these investments are superior to traditional strategies. The inquiry’s conclusion suggests future studies that might bring more data to the ongoing discussion...|$|R

This paper offers an overview of how environmental factors might be integrated into companies’ financial valuation. More speculatively, it suggests ways in which a <b>blended</b> <b>value</b> investor could potentially attain equal or better financial returns than traditional investors agnostic to the environmental implications of their investments. There are indications that financial markets are gradually integrating environmental considerations into securities valuations, emerging from a long period when such concerns had little if any influence on securities’ prices. If this assertion is true, the tools and perspectives of <b>blended</b> <b>value</b> investing can help an investor identify and profit from the financial manifestation of previously unpriced environmental value. Using the terms of finance, <b>blended</b> <b>value</b> investing may be a way to generate ‘alpha’ – or returns above the risk-adjusted performance of the overall market, which are typically attributed to an investment manager’s unique ability. Public equities and debt operate in relatively liquid, efficient markets that combine information from many investors and market influences to reveal clear prices for securities. Nevertheless, markets do not ‘explain’ how they arrived at a given valuation. Thus, for example, {{it is difficult to know}} how much of an oil company’s current share price reflects its commitment to alternative energy technology or to a recently announced reorganisation of its distribution network. In order to disentangle cause and effect, an investor or analyst must attempt to interpret the various pieces of information that contributed to the market’s valuation. In the matter of environmental opportunity and risk, more mainstream market participants are examining how environmental considerations can have a direct impact on securities prices. Accordingly, the mid- 2000 s may be an excellent time to be a <b>blended</b> <b>value</b> investor. To deploy such an investing strategy effectively requires an understanding of the standard tools of valuation as well as the development and use of new <b>blended</b> <b>value</b> methods...|$|R
5000|$|Emerson {{proposed}} the term “Blended Value” {{within the context}} of impact investing to describe the various categories of returns an investor should be looking for. Emerson posits the idea that measuring investments purely in terms of financial returns is a disingenuous assessment of reality because there are social and environmental implications to any business activity. There is a slight distinction between a business model that generates <b>blended</b> <b>value,</b> and an investment creating <b>blended</b> <b>value.</b> The difference can be explained through the concept of additionality. Additionality is the added value that {{can be attributed to the}} investment (i.e. if an investment has high level of additionality, then a large part of the organizations impact can be isolated and attributed to that specific injection of capital). This isolation is meant to convey how exactly the capital from the investment creates varying levels of value. Organizations gather data in order to report their performance to their investors. When investors seek <b>blended</b> <b>value,</b> they look for social, environmental, and financial returns. Although there is no single standardized measurement system to define these returns for investors, efforts are being taken by organizations such as GIIN and GIIRS to create a set of measurement tools and metrics that make holistic assessment of investments more feasible.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{contribute}} to the understanding of the factors that influence social entrepreneurial ventures’ (SEVs) pursuit of a <b>blended</b> <b>value</b> approach. This paper predicts and examines that the mindset of SEV senior decision-makers leads them to perceive organisational goals differently. Design/methodology/approach – This paper tests the hypotheses on an original data set of 171 SEVs by means of discriminant analysis. Findings – The results suggest that social entrepreneurs who display an agency-oriented mindset tend to perceive organisational goals as being single: either social or financial. Conversely, social entrepreneurs who have a stewardship-oriented mindset tend to perceive organisational goals as blending both. The findings also underline that senior decision-makers’ mindsets in terms of governance are far from being uniform in SEVs. Research limitations/implications – The findings empirically contribute to the argument that agency principles do apply to broader contexts than profit-oriented organisations (Wiseman et al., 2012) and frame SEVs as a promising context that redefines principal-agent relationships. It follows that the expected association between non-economic goals and stewardship put forward in the literature needs to be nuanced: only a <b>blended</b> <b>value</b> approach of social and financial objectives is associated with stewardship, whereas single social goals are best perceived by agency-oriented senior decision-makers. The results are limited to a single survey, using cross-sectional data. Practical implications – The findings have a bearing on goal setting in social entrepreneurship. The results suggest that practitioners who display a stewardship mindset are more likely to perceive a double bottom line than those displaying an agency mindset. Originality/value – A novel feature of the model is the incorporation of senior decision-makers’ heterogeneous “governance mindsets” (agency and stewardship) and one of the first empirical tests of <b>blended</b> <b>value</b> in social entrepreneurship...|$|R

These investors will be referred to as impact investors, and their investments referred to as impact investments. Specifically, the research question that will be examined is as follows: In what ways does Canadian legislation encourage or discourage impact investing in Canada, and what can be learned about how to encourage impact investing from recent experience in the UK and the US? In order to examine this question in more detail, this paper will consist of a literature review, as well as an analysis of corporate and charitable tax laws in Canada on the federal and provincial level, compared with those in the U. K. and the U. S. The U. K. and the U. S. are examined for two main reasons. First, they were the first countries to implement policies, specifically related to tax and market regulation, designed to encourage impact investments. Second, they are both common law countries with similar legal systems and traditions. Recent legal changes recognizing social enterprises on the federal and state/provincial will then be examined. Community Interest Companies (CICs) were first recognized by the U. K government. This was followed by New York State and most recently Delaware adopting state legislation recognizing Certified Benefit Corporations (B Corps). The province of British Columbia soon followed, as the trend of legally recognizing B Corps seems to be spreading into Canada.

Financial returns on investment are calculated as the ratio between the benefits accruing from {{the performance of a}} given project and the funds involved in their implementation. Both, benefits and funds, must be named in monetary terms. However in urban regeneration projects, due to their dual economic and social nature, is more difficult to quantify the profits generated because most of them are subjective (greater quality of life, better community welfare, etc.). There is a wide array of value taking place in a urban regenerative process (economic <b>value,</b> <b>blended</b> <b>value,</b> social value) some of which are measurable in a traditional Investment/Return framework (with its implicit economic returns assumption) and more of which are not so that they remain partially hidden from stakeholders.
