40|$|Photosystem II (PSII) inhibitors are {{ubiquitous}} in costal {{areas around the}} world. Changes in chlorophyll fluorescence have been seen in plants exposed to low concentrations of PSII inhibitors in laboratory experiments. Saw wrack (Fucus serratus), <b>bladder</b> <b>wrack</b> (Fucus vesiculosus) and Fucus evanescence are important and widespread in Norwegian coastal ecosystems, as primary producers and as structure forming perennial species. Ability to sensitive and rapidly monitor adverse effects in these species could be useful in a monitoring program. Two chlorophyll fluorescence parameters, photosynthetic efficiency (how efficient quanta is used in PSII) and quinone pool (amount of electron acceptors in PSII) were measured by Hansatech Handy Photosynthetic Efficiency Analyser.

40|$|The {{impact of}} {{moderate}} environmental stress may be modulated by stress-induced shifts of biotic interactions such as host – epibiont relationships. We studied the stress regime in shallow Western Baltic habitats, {{the variability of}} fouling at different temporal and spatial scales, and whether common stressors - low light, high temperature, grazing – affect the abundance and composition of the biofilm on a regionally important macroalga, the <b>bladder</b> <b>wrack</b> Fucus vesiculosus. We further explore the alga’s capacity to chemically modulate the recruitment of microfoulers and whether this ability is impacted by stress. In laboratory, mesocosm and field experiments fouling pressure and epibiotic cover on the algae varied strongly with changing environmental conditions such as temperature, irradiance, depth or grazing. The expectation that abiotic stress affects the fouling-modulating ability of the alga and, thus, indirectly produces the observed variability of epibiosis was not generally confirmed. Indeed, while the strength of chemical antifouling resistance varied seasonally, with a maximum in winter/spring and a minimum in late summer, this could not be related to temporal patterns of environmental stress, fouling pressure, or growth of Fucus. Only the seasonal variation in reproduction {{seemed to be in}} phase with antifouling activity. Controlled experiments confirmed that resistance strength was not affected by temperature or grazing, and only moderately by light.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the preference heterogeneity {{of the general}} public regarding water quality attributes and provides welfare estimates (WTP) for three nutrient-reduction scenarios that would improve the water quality in the Gulf of Finland, part of the Baltic Sea. In the choice experiment (CE), the improvement is described in terms of four water quality attributes: water clarity, abundance of coarse (non-attractive) fish, status of <b>bladder</b> <b>wrack</b> (a type of seaweed), and mass occurrences of blue-green algae blooms. The data are analysed with multinomial logit (MNL), random parameters logit (RPL), and latent class (LCM) models. The results from MNL and RPL show that, on average for Finns, clear water is, relatively speaking, the most important water quality characteristics followed by desire for fewer occurrences of blue-green algae. The results also show that the probability of expressing willingness to contribute to improvement of the water quality increases with residential or recreational contact with the Gulf of Finland, a higher income than average, a younger than average age, and lack of dependent children in the household. The LCM reveals that opinions about the order of relative importance of attributes depend on age, household income, coastal residence, and vacation home ownership. The present values for three nutrient reduction scenarios of different intensities ranging from 28, 000 Â million euro to 54, 000 Â million euro were calculated using mean welfare estimates, discounted for perpetuity with a 2 % rate.

40|$|Lead {{contamination}} of abiotic and biotic systems {{has been studied}} closely since the early 1970 s, when lead was firstly perceived as an environmental problem. Lead emission reduction policies were implemented throughout Europe during that time. Nonetheless, analyses of lead loads in aquatic systems, such as the river Elbe, showed no decline over time in either suspended matter or surface sediments. Regional differences in lead concentrations of fluvial systems were found, due to tidal influence, runoff and local emissions. Lead {{contamination of}} sediments from the North Sea was highest in estuaries. Concentrations in sediment cores were quite stable down to the depth of background values, due to bioturbation, flow, waves and meandering channels. Terrestrial soils in Europe were highly polluted in industrial and ore mining areas and large cities. No decline in lead concentrations was evident in foraminifers, <b>bladder</b> <b>wrack</b> or fish. It was found that contamination in sediments, mammals and fish was higher in coastal zones than in the open sea. In contrast to in aquatic organisms, positive impacts of lead reduction regulations were detected in terrestrial plants, which adsorbed or took up lead mainly through atmospheric lead deposition. European lead concentrations in plants decreased coincidently with lead emissions. That trend could also be identified in the blood lead levels of the human population in Europe: since 1979 they have declined in every group of the population. Mainly influenced by age, sex and the living environment, overall, the lead loads of humans had never been high enough to cause health danger. (orig.)

30|$|In {{the frame}} of the German Environmental Specimen Bank (ESB), samples of {{suspended}} particulate matter (SPM) and biota have been taken yearly and aliquot pool samples have been deep-frozen for retrospective monitoring since the 1980 s [22, 23]. The major advantage of the ESB is that material from different areas sampled over a period of up to 30  years is already available and can be used directly. BMFfield can, in principle, be determined for different matrix combinations: At fresh water stations, lipid-normalised chemical concentrations in the zebra mussel, Dreissena polymorpha, can be divided by organic carbon normalised chemical concentrations in SPM to obtain a biota/SPM accumulation factor for lower trophic levels. In the marine environment, organisms of different trophic levels are monitored by the ESB: the brown alga common <b>bladder</b> <b>wrack</b> (Fucus vesiculosus), the blue mussel (Mytilus edulis), eelpout (Zoarces viviparus) and egg content of the herring gull (Larus argentatus). For sites where a direct prey to predator relationship exists, BMFfield values can be calculated. Assuming that the difference between trophic levels in each prey to predator combination equals 1, fresh weight normalised biota concentration of PFOS resulted in a BMFfield of approximately 5 for herring gull/eelpout and 20 for eelpout/blue mussel (North Sea sampling site Jade bay/Mellum; based on data from [24]). Indeed, it has to be considered that in the different species either whole soft tissue or single tissues were investigated (e.g. whole soft tissue in mussels, liver in eelpout) which can vary in their bioaccumulation potential. Due to missing data, biota concentrations have also not been normalised to protein content, although PFOS is known to bind to proteins [25]. Furthermore, information on prey/predator trophic interaction and exact trophic positions of the studied species have to be confirmed (e.g. by stomach content analyses or carbon and nitrogen stable isotope ratio shifts (δ 13 C, δ 15 N); [20]).|$|E
40|$|Marine macroalgae are key {{components}} of rocky shores and provide habitat, food, and shelter for numerous organisms while marine herbivores {{play an important role}} in regulating the biomass of seaweeds. To persist in benthic communities, traits evolved in seaweeds to avoid, tolerate, or deter herbivory. An increasing amount of literature confirms that seaweeds often respond to grazers with the induction of chemical defenses. In contrast to terrestrial systems, little is known about temporal dynamics and underlying molecular processes of inducible defenses in seaweeds. A 33 day long induction experiment assessed patterns in temporal variation of anti-herbivory defenses in the brown alga Fucus vesiculosus (<b>bladder</b> <b>wrack)</b> in response to grazing by the isopod Idotea baltica. Every 3 days, two-choice feeding assays with naïve grazers tested whether defenses were induced. Selected samples were used for RNA extraction and microarray hybridizations to determine changes in gene expression patterns. We showed that Fucus palatability varied over time with controls being significantly more consumed than grazed seaweed pieces after 18 and 27 days of previous grazing in the induction period. We observed a significant change in the gene expression of grazed Fucus compared to controls. Isopod grazing up-regulated 536 genes, 340 genes were found to be down-regulated. 21 % of all regulated genes were annotated using different databases (e. g. NCBI sequence database, Swiss-Prot protein knowledgebase) and allocated to KOG (Clusters of eukaryotic Orthologous Groups) categories. Isopod grazing and consequential induction of anti-herbivory defenses yielded in up-regulation of the categories ‘intracellular trafficking, secretion, and vesicular transport’ and ‘defense mechanisms’, whereas transcripts involved in photosynthesis were strongly down-regulated. Our data revealed modified gene expression patterns that occurred simultaneously to a reduced palatability in consequence of isopod grazing. The findings represent a first step in understanding cellular processes underlying the induction of anti-herbivory defenses in Fucus vesiculosus...|$|E

While HHCB and AHTN were found in almost all samples, {{most of the other}} musk fragrances were detected only in a few samples and mostly at lower concentration levels. Blue mussels from the North Sea showed varying levels of 0. 5 - 1. 7 ng g(ind - 1) ww for HHCB and 0. 4 - 2. 5 ng g(ind - 1) ww for AHTN (ww, wet weight) in the period from 1986 to 2000, while blue mussels from the Baltic Sea were only slightly contaminated with synthetic musk fragrances. Lipid weight-related concentrations of synthetic musk compounds in blue mussels were higher than in eelpout muscles, <b>bladder</b> <b>wrack</b> and herring gull eggs. In comparison to the marine specimens, muscles of bream from German rivers had higher concentrations of HHCB and AHTN. The ranges of HHCB and AHTN concentrations in bream from the Elbe River were 545 - 6400 ng g(ind - 1) lw and 48 - 2130 ng g(ind - 1), respectively (lw, lipid weight; five sampling sites, period 1993 - 2003). In the Rhine River, HHCB and AHTN levels of bream muscles were highest at the Iffezheim site (up to 9750 ng g(ind - 1) lw HHCB, 1998). Even higher synthetic musk levels were detected in bream from the rivers Saale and Saar. In recent years, levels of both compounds determined in bream from most sampling sites have decreased from maximum values in the 1990 s. As the concentrations of AHTN have decreased faster, the ratio of HHCB to AHTN increased from 2 - 4 in the 1990 s to 10 - 20 in recent years...|$|E
40|$|Seaweeds are {{established}} sentinels for metal contamination and are utilised for biomonitoring. Metallothionein (MT) is a protein that is induced by metal exposure, {{and has been}} widely used as a biomarker for metal pollution. MT has not been reported in spiral wrack (Fucus spiralis), but has been identified in <b>bladder</b> <b>wrack</b> (Fucus vesiculosus), {{where it has been}} suggested as a protective mechanism against metal exposure. This study aimed to evaluate the potential use of MT in F. spiralis as a biomarker for metal pollution for the first time. Samples were collected from Poole Harbour, UK, over a year-long period, from January to October 2015. MT and metal concentrations were quantified during winter, spring, summer, and autumn seasons. Linear regression analysis showed few relationships between MT and metal concentrations, apart from in summer. During summer, significant positive relationships existed between MT concentrations and iron (R 2 = 0. 631), nickel (R 2 = 0. 486), tin (R 2 = 0. 579), and lead (R 2 = 0. 415). It is possible that for most of the year, metal concentrations in Poole Harbour are not high enough to elicit a MT response in F. spiralis, as it is a metal tolerant species. However, during summer, rates of photosynthesis and growth increase, which may increase metal toxicity, due to the inhibition of photosynthesis and growth. Thus, MT may be induced in order to prevent disruption. This study suggests that the use of MT as a biomarker for metal pollution in F. spiralis may not be a sensitive biomarker at low levels of metal pollution. However, MT concentrations in F. spiralis may respond to metal exposure when natural processes are vulnerable to pollution. The potential for MT {{to be used as a}} biomarker in Fucus spp. has been highlighted, warranting further research to develop a promising cosmopolitan bioindicator for metal pollution...|$|E
40|$|Phlorotannins are {{the least}} studied group of tannins and are found only in brown algae. Hitherto the roles of phlorotannins, e. g. in plant-herbivore interactions, have been studied by {{quantifying}} the total contents of the soluble phlorotannins {{with a variety of}} methods. Little attention has been given to either quantitative variation in cell-wall-bound and exuded phlorotannins or to qualitative variation in individual compounds. A quantification procedure was developed to measure the amount of cell-wall-bound phlorotannins. The quantification of soluble phlorotannins was adjusted for both large- and small-scale samples and used to estimate the amounts of exuded phlorotannins using <b>bladder</b> <b>wrack</b> (Fucus vesiculosus) as a model species. In addition, separation of individual soluble phlorotannins to produce a phlorotannin profile from the phenolic crude extract was achieved by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Along with these methodological studies, attention was focused on the factors in the procedure which generated variation in the yield of phlorotannins. The objective was to enhance the efficiency of the sample preparation procedure. To resolve the problem of rapid oxidation of phlorotannins in HPLC analyses, ascorbic acid was added to the extractant. The widely used colourimetric method was found to produce a variation in the yield that was dependent upon the pH and concentration of the sample. Using these developed, adjusted and modified methods, the phenotypic plasticity of phlorotannins was studied with respect to nutrient availability and herbivory. An increase in nutrients decreased the total amount of soluble phlorotannins but did not affect the cell-wall-bound phlorotannins, the exudation of phlorotannins or the phlorotannin profile achieved with HPLC. The presence of the snail Thedoxus fluviatilis on the thallus induced production of soluble phlorotannins, and grazing by the herbivorous isopod Idotea baltica increased the exudation of phlorotannins. To study whether the among-population variations in phlorotannin contents arise from the genetic divergence or from the plastic response of algae, or both, algae from separate populations were reared in a common garden. Genetic variation among local populations was found in both the phlorotannin profile and the content of total phlorotannins. Phlorotannins were also genetically variable within populations. This suggests that local algal populations have diverged in their contents of phlorotannins, and that they may respond to natural selection and evolve both quantitatively and qualitatively...|$|E

In this paper, contingent valuation is used to estimate the value of improving the water quality status according to this classification, investigating if this type of holistic political-ecological measure {{can be related to}} and valued in monetary terms by the general public. A web-based survey was conducted in two study areas on the Swedish East and West coast. The paper focuses on eutrophication effects, such as bad water clarity, a decrease of <b>bladder</b> <b>wrack</b> stands and algae mats. These water quality elements affect recreational use of coastal areas. Relating to recreational use, two other environmental attributes are addressed – algae blooms and protection of marine areas in terms of e. g. restrictions for boat traffic. The restrictions scenario is also holistic in terms of several imposed restrictions, as well as tightly linked with existing policy. Conducting valuation studies based on a policy-determined measure is beneficial for decisionmakers but also for research e. g. in terms of data availability. It is concluded that these politically defined measures seem to work well as a basis for economic valuation. The respondents are in general both able to understand and to put a monetary value to the measures. This is an important first step, paving the ground for further studies. The monthly mean household WTP between the years 2010 – 2029 ranges from 61 to 108 SEK for improved water quality, from 54 to 84 SEK for less algae blooms and from 32 to 50 SEK for less noise and littering. Regarding noise and littering in archipelago areas in Northern Europe, this is to our knowledge the first WTP estimate that has been presented. The respondents from the East coast region express relatively high mean WTP values compared to the respondents on the West coast for all scenarios. The differences in mean WTP values between the study areas, which are reflected in the transfer errors, indicate that even though the coasts are similar in terms of use and environmental problems, and the respondents have many similar characteristics, a point estimate benefit transfer between the two coasts is not recommended unless high transfer errors are acceptable. WTP is affected by gender, membership of an NGO, whether or not the respondent has children, whether or not the respondent has a foreign background, frequency of visiting the area and whether or not the respondent uses a boat with an engine effect of more than 10 hp while visiting the area. non-market valuation; choice experiments; water framework directive...|$|E
