50|$|The <b>black</b> <b>cardinal</b> <b>fish</b> is a {{deepwater}} bentho-pelagic {{fish that}} is found on continental slopes, undersea ridges and seamounts {{in the northern}} Atlantic, ranging from Iceland to the Canary Islands and the Corner Rise Seamounts. It {{is also found in}} the southeastern Atlantic, including the Walvis Ridge off southwestern Africa, the Indian Ocean and the southwestern Pacific Ocean.|$|E
50|$|The <b>black</b> <b>cardinal</b> <b>fish</b> {{is subject}} to {{commercial}} fisheries, primarily around seamounts. Based on the FAO fishery statistics, the annual catches worldwide ranged between 1,355 and 4,353 tonnes in 2000 to 2009, most of the fish being taken from the Southwest Pacific (FAO Fishing Area 81). However, according to Watson et al., the catches peaked at 10,000 tonnes in the year 2000.|$|E
5000|$|Epigonus telescopus, the <b>black</b> <b>cardinal</b> <b>fish,</b> is {{a species}} of {{deepwater}} cardinalfish found in most temperate oceans worldwide, at depths of between 75 and 1200 m though mostly between 300 and 800 m.

5000|$|Like most seamounts, they attract fish. Over 175 {{species have}} been found there, {{including}} splendid alfonsino, <b>black</b> <b>cardinal</b> <b>fish,</b> black scabbardfish, and wreckfish. Trawl fishing during the 1970s and 1980s resulted in approximately 20,000 tons of fish being harvested. [...] As a result, the seamounts were closed to demersal fishing (collecting fish {{near the bottom of}} the ocean, as opposed to pelagic fishing, collecting fish near the surface) beginning 1 January 1997. The original ban was supposed to be lifted 31 December 2010, but was extended until 31 December 2020. Almost a decade into the ban, a 2005 Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution survey found that two of the peaks, Kükenthal and Yakutat, had been stripped bare of both corals and bottom-dwelling animals. However the survey, which covered both the Corner Rise and New England Seamounts, found 270 species of invertebrates and crustaceans, including 70 species unique to the Corner Rise Seamounts.|$|E

Analysis of the sequence provides insight into differences between P. mandapamensis and other luminous and symbiotic bacteria in genes involved in quorum-sensing regulation of light production and establishment of symbiosis.

The fish harbors a dense population of the bacterium in a ventral light organ and uses the bacterial light to attract zooplankton prey. The light organ begins to form early in larval development, through a proliferation and differenti-ation of intestinal epithelial cells, and it becomes colonized by P. mandapamensis after further larval development (2, 4 – 8, 11, 14).

50|$|Diadema savignyi is nocturnal {{and tends}} to hide in crevices or under {{boulders}} during the day, or several individuals may huddle together in the open. The urchins disperse at dusk to feed on the algal mat that grows {{over the surface of}} seabed. In the course of tearing up the mat the urchin also abrades the underlying surface, causing bioerosion. Its activities help control the algae which otherwise might overwhelm the corals. Certain small <b>fish</b> such as <b>cardinal</b> <b>fish,</b> flatworms and shrimps sometimes seek protection from predators among the long spines. The sea urchin is preyed on by pufferfish (Tetraodontidae) and porcupinefish (Diodontidae), and also lobsters and snails. It reacts to a shadow falling on it by angling its spines towards the possible attacker.|$|R

40|$|The orbiculate <b>cardinal</b> <b>fish</b> Sphaeramia orbicularis is {{the most}} {{abundant}} teleost among the root system of the extensive mangrove forests bordering Gazi Bay, Kenya. The species was never recorded from the bay proper and it can thus {{be considered to be}} a true mangrove resident. The sampled population clearly consisted of two cohorts: the modes were approximately 65 mm and 80 mm. Most individuals with standard lengths > 40 mm had mature gonads; the number of eggs ranged from 4, 700 to 10, 000. S. orbicularis are carnivores, mainly feeding on small epi- and hyperbenthic crustaceans. Numerically, gammaridean amphipods and tanaids were the dominant prey categories in the stomachs of both size classes. Individuals belonging to the smaller cohort mainly supplemented their diet with harpacticoid copepods, while larger fishes also fed on postlarval brachyuran crabs and caridean shrimp. The latter two taxa were important prey items in gravimetrical terms. A preliminary analysis of the otoliths revealed 21 stress marks and 20 striations.

There he was met by Napoleon himself, who offered him an annual pension of 30,000 francs. This he refused. When he and twelve other cardinals refused to attend Napoleon's marriage to Princess Marie Louise in 1810, they were stripped of their property and ecclesiastical status, becoming known as the <b>black</b> <b>cardinals.</b> Consalvi {{and the others were}} also forced to reside in various cities in France, in his case, Reims. This lasted until Pius VII signed the Concordat of Fontainebleau in January 1813. The cardinal was then allowed to leave his place of forced residence and joined the Pope.

40|$|Parasitic {{crustaceans}} {{are among}} the most harmful parasites of fishes. Certain species cause disease outbreaks and mortalities in aquaculture, facilities, and sometimes in natural systems, resulting in serious economic losses. Edible fishes from some Philippine lakes also show infestation by parasitic crustaceans. The branchiuran, Argulus indicus Weber, and the copepod, Lernaea cyprinacea Linnaeus, were recovered from the skin and base of the dorsal fin, respectively, of the mudfish Channa striata from Laguna de Bay. L. cyprinacea was also found on the white goby Glossogobius giurus in Naujan Lake. In La Mesa Reservoir, the gills of wild populations of tilapias Oreochromis niloticus and Tilapia zillii, white goby, and silvery theraponid Therapon plumbeus were infected with the copepod, Ergasilus philippinensis Velasquez. An isopod, Alitropus typus Edwards, was recovered from the buccal and gill cavities of several fishes from Lake Taal, namely; the mud gudgeon Ophiocara aporos, <b>cardinal</b> <b>fish</b> Apogon thermalis, silvery theraponid, and cage cultured Oreochromis niloticus.

An underwater visual fish census survey was conducted in June to July 2010 at 18 fishing sites around Banggai archipelago to estimate the density of the stock and assess the impact of fishing and habitat on density. The areas are divided into three main islands, namely Banggai Island, Peleng Island, Toropot-Tumbak-Labobo Island. The lowest density index of the P. kauderni recorded at Kindandal village on Peleng Island, 0. 014 fish/m 2 while the highest abundance index of 3. 0 fish/m 2 found at Toropot village at Toropot Island. In three survey sites (Bonebaru and Toropot villages) where the fishing activities are still ongoing, the density has declined compared to the survey conducted in 2004. Majority of the villages in Peleng Island have lower density compared with the other islands probably due to the degradation of microhabitat of P. kauderni.
