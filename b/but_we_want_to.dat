On 13 August, he scored his first {{goal of the}} season in a 5–1 win over Dundee United. He also picked up an ankle injury which ruled him out for the next two matches. On 25 August he made his return in Celtic's 3–1 loss to FC Sion. Three days later, he scored both goals in a 2–0 win over St Mirren. English Premier League clubs Queens Park Rangers and Wolverhampton Wanderers {{expressed}} interest in signing Hooper on transfer deadline day of summer 2011, however Celtic rejected their enquiries about his availability. Hooper's regular strike partner Anthony Stokes said [...] "He's a top, top player. I have no doubt one day he could play at the very top level <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> keep him here as long as possible." ...|$|E
500|$|In March 2005 Glickenhaus, stock {{exchange}} magnate and car collector, {{was approached by}} Pininfarina who {{asked if he was}} interested in commissioning a one-off car. Andrea Pininfarina, grandson of the company’s founder later said [...] "The Ferrari 612 Kappa and this P4/5 are the first. <b>But</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> grow this business." [...] indicating that Pininfarina is interested in producing other unique cars. Glickenhaus replied that he would like a modern Ferrari P, and in June of that year he signed a contract with Pininfarina to produce the car including the price, approximately US$4 million though in an interview he said [...] "I feel they gave me more than I expected". Glickenhaus purchased the last unsold Enzo Ferrari and upon receipt of the car he took it to Pininfarina to be redesigned similar to his David Piper P4 replica (Click link here: [...] ) [...] which he also delivered to Pininfarina. Pininfarina's styling team leader, Ken Okuyama said that [...] "Pininfarina wanted to stay away from retro design and move towards a more forward thinking supercar" [...] as they were excited by the opportunity to build the car, not just design it.|$|E
500|$|In a 2011 Q, {{producer}} Jim Lemley {{said that}} [...] "Wanted 2 {{sounds like it}} will not happen any time soon if at all". That same year, James McAvoy said, regarding the sequel, [...] "I think the studio is keen to make it, and {{we really want to}} make it, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> make it if it's right and when it's right, and that might not be ever." [...] McAvoy also expressed interest in a sequel focusing on a character other than Wesley. Universal later brought Wanted screenwriters Michael Brandt and Derek Haas to write the sequel, which Haas described as happening [...] "right after the events that just happened; it'll pick up Wesley a few years later and go back in for another round", while also being [...] "Fox-less and loom-less." [...] Haas would later detail that the script featured a new female protagonist, who Wesley would recruit [...] "sort of in the Fox role." [...] Bekmambetov declared during the interviews for [...] that after many years of indecision as the Wanted sequel stalled in development, he proposed an idea to the screenwriters wherein the plot followed Wesley while featuring [...] "a great twist." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{producers}} {{were looking}} for someone who had a [...] "Paris Hilton quality" [...] to play Shannon, but she could not just be shallow, as the storyline would require more than that. A lot of women auditioned before the producers finally settled on Maggie Grace. She was written to be a bitch in the first season as the producers needed a character they could use to create opposition and conflict. The producers thought it would be interesting for there to be more to Shannon and Boone's relationship than just Boone's possessive brotherly interest. They {{came up with the idea}} for them to be unrelated stepsiblings, who have a romantic encounter, which became the twist for their backstory. When Boone is killed at the end of season one, it forces Shannon into a more adult existence on the Island. Grace noted Boone is [...] "the only person that ever really knew and loved Shannon, in spite of herself. Of course, losing him, especially with so much left unsaid and unresolved, will change her irrevocably." [...] This freed her up to develop her relationship with Sayid. Naveen Andrews, who plays Sayid, came up with the idea for Shannon and Sayid relationship. He thought, [...] "What would really shock Middle-America? What if Sayid was to have a relationship with a woman that looked like Miss America? The most unlikely pairing… to come completely from left field." [...] This pairing made Shannon [...] "less flighty... more of a person to be reckoned with." [...] According to Lost producer Carlton Cuse, [...] "The relationships [...] expect on the show are not necessarily the ones that we [...] necessarily are going to give you, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> try to find ways in which characters that you don't expect to kind of connect to one another to connect in ways that are kind of surprising." ...|$|E
500|$|A new league, the Canadian Hockey Association (CHA), {{was formed}} in late November 1909. One of the teams, the All-Montreal Hockey Club, hired Ross as a playing-manager, but the league only lasted to mid-January 1910 before disbanding. Ross, who scored four goals in four games in the CHA, then signed with the Haileybury Comets of the National Hockey Association (NHA), a league formed in December 1909, which {{proved to be the}} {{stronger}} replacement to the ECAHA as the highest level of hockey in Canada. He received $2,700 to play in the 1910 season, which lasted from January to March, playing twelve games for the team and finishing with six goals. Before the following season, the NHA imposed a salary cap of $5,000 per team. The players, including Ross, were unhappy as this would result in a pay decrease, and began looking to form their own league without a cap. Ross wrote to the Montreal Herald, stating [...] "all the players want is a fair deal ... The players are not trying to bulldoze the NHA, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> know where we get off at." [...] The plans were abandoned when they realized all the suitable arenas would be unavailable as they were owned or leased by the NHA. Ross scored four goals in eleven games with the Wanderers, who finished fourth in the five team league. During a match against the Quebec Bulldogs on February 25, 1911, Ross knocked out Eddie Oatman in a fight, provoking a massive brawl between the two teams, which the police had to break up. The fight helped to increase the reputation Ross had as a tough player unwilling to back down from any opponent. The following season Ross had eleven goals in nineteen games as the Wanderers improved to second in the league.|$|E
2500|$|Pet usage is {{the primary}} market for trapped painted turtles {{although}} a small number are sent to turtle races. Commercial trapping is modest economically, with double digits of trappers, selling a few thousand turtles yearly, at $1–2 per turtle. Individual harvesters who trap painted turtles typically do so for extra money and alternate between fishing and turtle trapping based on the markets. Many have been traditionally involved in the trade: Ben Hedstrom of Minnesota said, [...] "We've sold turtles for 50 years. My dad did it since the 1920s." [...] Some harvesters disagree with limiting the catch. Rex Campbell of Minnesota said, [...] "I {{can go out and}} catch more turtles today than I did 10 years ago. I don't see that it's hurting the turtle population. The last thing I want to see {{is the end of the}} resource we've all depended on for a long time. I'm not against regulating the industry, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> go out and harvest and still make a living at it." ...|$|E

[...] Concerning the gameplay style, he commented, [...] "We definitely <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> teach players that violence isn't always the right solution, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> never <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> water down gameplay by taking that option away from them." ...|$|R

2500|$|Clough's {{decision}} led to extensive {{accusations of}} censorship and {{claims that the}} Smithsonian was caving in to pressure from {{a small group of}} vocal activists. Smithsonian officials strongly defended the video's removal. [...] "The decision wasn't caving in," [...] said Sullivan. [...] "We don't want to shy away from anything that is controversial, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> focus on the museum's and this show's strengths." [...] Kurin expressed the Smithsonian's desire to be responsive to public opinion, but also emphasized the remaining exhibit's importance. [...] "We are sensitive to what the public thinks about our shows and programs," [...] he said. [...] "We stand behind the show. It has strong scholarship with great pieces by artists who are recognized by a whole panoply of experts. It represents a segment of America." [...] On December 13, the Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts, one of the principal sponsors of the exhibit, said it would ask for its $100,000 donation back if the film was not restored. Clough replied, [...] "...the Smithsonian's decision to remove the video was a difficult one and we stand by it." [...] The donation was returned, and the Warhol Foundation ceased to support National Portrait Gallery exhibits. The Robert Mapplethorpe Foundation, which donated $10,000 to support the exhibit, also ended all funding for future Smithsonian exhibitions. Both decisions drew criticism from some gay rights supporters, who felt the funding cuts were too draconian {{in view of the fact}} that the remainder of the pieces continued to be exhibited.|$|E
