25|$|The FARC as an {{organization}} also reserves a place for women fighters.

Women usually are not grouped together in specific units, {{as was the case in}} other countries, and they can also participate in all military operations.|$|E

Once again the Vermont state line is very near NY22, <b>but</b> <b>now</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> separated from New York by water instead of land. The stream at the bottom of this valley, surrounded by the low lying Drowned Lands flood plain, is the inflow for Lake Champlain.
