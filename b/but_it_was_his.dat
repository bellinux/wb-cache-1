5|$|As Manchester United and Arsenal won the Premier League and FA Cup respectively, {{both teams}} met in another heated match at the Millennium Stadium {{a month earlier}} for the 2003 Community Shield. Phil Neville was booked in the first minute for a {{challenge}} on Patrick Vieira, and a minute later Ashley Cole received a booking for fouling Ole Gunnar Solskjær. Yellow cards were also given to Quinton Fortune and Paul Scholes for United and Patrick Vieira for Arsenal, Arsenal substitute Francis Jeffers was shown a straight red for a kick on Phil Neville and, despite originally going unpunished, Sol Campbell was later given a three-match ban by the FA for kicking out at Eric Djemba-Djemba. The game finished 1–1 after 90 minutes and United eventually won the Shield 4–3 on penalties. Ruud van Nistelrooy had his spot kick saved by debutant Jens Lehmann <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>his</b> opposite number and fellow debutant Tim Howard who was the hero, saving penalties from Giovanni van Bronckhorst and Robert Pirès.|$|E
5|$|It was the Swedish {{botanist}} Carl Linnaeus {{who finally}} put order into this situation as {{he attempted to}} name all the known organisms of his day. In 1735 his Systema Naturae, which included animals (the tenth edition became {{the starting point for}} zoological nomenclature) was followed by Critica Botanica in 1737, and Philosophia Botanica in 1751. <b>But</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>his</b> most comprehensive work on plants, the 1753 publication Species Plantarum that formalised the name of a genus with a single epithet to form the name of a species as two words, the binomial thus making secure the biological system of binomial nomenclature. In these works Linnaeus used a third name as a variety within a species. These varieties included both wild and horticultural variants. The horticultural varieties were still written in Latin and some have persisted to this day.|$|E
5|$|Manuel's {{death on}} 24 September 1180 left his 11-year-old son Alexios II Komnenos on the throne. Alexios was highly incompetent at the office, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>his</b> mother, Maria of Antioch, and her Frankish {{background}} {{that made his}} regency unpopular. Eventually, Andronikos I Komnenos, a grandson of Alexios I, launched a revolt against his younger relative and managed to overthrow him in a violent coup d'état. Utilizing his good looks and his immense popularity with the army, he marched on to Constantinople in August 1182 and incited a massacre of the Latins. After eliminating his potential rivals, he had himself crowned as co-emperor in September 1183. He eliminated Alexios II, and took his 12-year-old wife Agnes of France for himself.|$|E

5|$|The deification of Macedonian monarchs perhaps {{began with}} the death of PhilipII, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>his</b> son Alexander the Great who {{unambiguously}} claimed to be a living god. Following his visit to the oracle of Didyma in 334BC that suggested his divinity, Alexander traveled to the Oracle of Zeus Ammon — the Greek equivalent of the Egyptian Amun-Ra — at the Siwa Oasis of the Libyan Desert in 332BC to confirm his divine status. Although the Ptolemaic and Seleucid empires maintained ancestral cults and deified their rulers, kings were not worshiped in the Kingdom of Macedonia. While Zeus Ammon was known to the Greeks prior to Alexander's reign, particularly at the Greek colony of Cyrene, Libya, Alexander was the first Macedonian monarch to patronize Egyptian, Persian, and Babylonian priesthoods and deities, strengthening the fusion of Near Eastern and Greek religious beliefs. After his reign, the cult of Isis gradually spread throughout the Hellenistic and Roman world, while beliefs in the Egyptian god Sarapis were thoroughly Hellenized by the Ptolemaic rulers of Egypt before the spread of his cult to Macedonia and the Aegean region. The German historian Johann Gustav Droysen argued that the conquests of Alexander the Great and creation of the Hellenistic world allowed for the growth and establishment of Christianity in the Roman era.|$|E

25|$|Howell {{moved to}} North-East England and between 1926 and 1936 {{he played in}} Minor Counties cricket for Durham, at that stage not a {{first-class}} county team. At this level of cricket, he was highly effective and in 1929 he was picked for the Minor Counties representative team that met Lancashire in a first-class fixture: the match was ruined by rain and Howell failed to take a wicket, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>his</b> last first-class cricket appearance.|$|E

25|$|Knowles battled {{multiple}} sclerosis from 1946, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>his</b> 1981 stroke that ultimately removed him from public life. He retired from politics in 1984, but {{was given the}} unprecedented distinction of being made an honorary table officer of the House of Commons by Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau. This allowed him to spend his retirement viewing parliamentary debates {{from the floor of}} the House, and he was often seen to do so until further strokes left him bedridden.|$|E
25|$|The Samanid Empire was {{the first}} native Persian dynasty to arise after the Muslim Arab conquest. The four grandsons of the dynasty's founder, Saman Khuda, had been rewarded with provinces for their {{faithful}} service to the Abbasid caliph al-Mamun: Nuh obtained Samarkand; Ahmad, Fergana; Yahya, Shash; and Elyas, Herat. Ahmad's son Nasr became governor of Transoxania in 875, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>his</b> brother and successor, Ismail Samani who overthrew the Saffarids and the Zaydites of Tabaristan, thus establishing a semiautonomous rule over Transoxania and Khorasan, with Bukhara as his capital.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{his return}} to Australia, he played only two more Tests in the 1972–73 season against Pakistan. He took eight wickets <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>his</b> batting which {{attracted}} the most attention. With Australia faltering at 8/101 in its second innings in the Third Test, with only a 75 run lead, Massie combined with John Watkins to add 83. Massie made 42 and Australia managed to win the Test and the series. Massie’s health failed him on the 1973 West Indies tour and {{he was unable to}} recover his swing and accuracy. He played only a further five first class matches before retiring.|$|E

25|$|Wieser {{believed}} that he could contribute to a return to liberal policies, both by explaining his economic vision in his books and articles {{as well as by}} teaching it in his role as university professor at the University of Prague and University of Vienna. In addition, his positions within the Austrian ministries allowed him to adopt more or less liberal economic policies. <b>But</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>his</b> liberal vision that separated him from the British economists of his era, discarding classical and neoclassical idealized models that did not contemplate the possibility of monopolies or the existence of economies of scale.|$|E
25|$|Pullman married Judith Speller in 1970 {{and began}} {{teaching}} children aged 9 to 13 at Bishop Kirk Middle School in Summertown, North Oxford and writing school plays. His first published work was The Haunted Storm, which was joint-winner of the New English Library's Young Writer's Award in 1972. He nevertheless refuses to discuss it. Galatea, an adult fantasy-fiction novel, followed in 1978, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>his</b> school plays which inspired his first children's book, Count Karlstein, in 1982. He stopped teaching {{shortly after the}} publication of The Ruby in the Smoke (1986), his second children's book, which has a Victorian setting.|$|E
25|$|From 1952 to 1954 {{he played}} in around half of Warwickshire's matches, though with a few {{exceptions}} he had limited impact with both bat and ball. Against Essex in 1952, he scored an unbeaten 121, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>his</b> only century and in the 1952 season as a whole his batting average was just 21.88. In the 1953 game with Worcestershire, he took five second innings wickets for 61 runs, his only return of five wickets in an innings; but in the very next match he was upstaged by the part-time off-breaks of Bert Wolton and was dropped from the team.|$|E

25|$|Ulysses S. Grant, who did {{not think}} highly of Butler's {{military}} skills, ordered him to attack {{in the direction of}} Petersburg from the east, destroying the rail links supplying Richmond and distracting Robert E. Lee, in conjunction with attacks Grant would make from the north. Rather than striking immediately at Petersburg as ordered, Butler's offensive bogged down east of Richmond in the area called the Bermuda Hundred, immobilized by the greatly inferior force of Confederate General P.G.T. Beauregard, and he was unable to accomplish any of his assigned objectives. <b>But</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>his</b> mismanagement of the expedition against Fort Fisher, North Carolina, that finally led to his recall by General Grant.|$|E
25|$|It {{was during}} this period that AEK signed one of Greece's finest strikers, Thomas Mavros, the all-time top goalscorer in the Greek Championship. In {{following}} years, he and Dušan Bajević formed a formidable attacking duo for AEK. Mavros {{was an integral part}} of the team that reached the UEFA Cup final in 1976, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>his</b> devastating form (top goal scorer of 1978 and 1979– 22 and 31 goals, respectively) that helped AEK to win the 1977–78 Championship-Cup double. The addition of former Panathinaikos stars Domazos and Eleutherakis to the AEK roster, the following year, saw the club cap off their most successful decade to-date by winning the 1979 Championship.|$|E
25|$|After {{making his}} {{first-class}} umpiring {{debut in the}} 1982-83 season, Emerson was promoted to the National Umpires panel in 1993-94. He made his ODI debut in a match between Sri Lanka and the West Indies in Brisbane in January, 1996. He immediately became controversial, no-balling Muralitharan seven times, and continuing to do so even when he switched to bowling legbreaks, which are regarded as being impossible to throw. This led to Muralitharan being dropped by Sri Lanka {{for the rest of}} the tour, as he was unable to bowl without being called. Emerson continued to officiate in ODIs for the next three years, standing in nine more games, all in Australia, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>his</b> last game which overshadowed even the first.|$|E

25|$|As a young prince, Ashoka (BCE) was a {{brilliant}} commander who crushed revolts in Ujjain and Takshashila. As monarch he was ambitious and aggressive, re-asserting the Empire's superiority in southern and western India. <b>But</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>his</b> conquest of Kalinga (262–261BCE) which {{proved to be the}} pivotal event of his life. Although Ashoka's army succeeded in overwhelming Kalinga forces of royal soldiers and civilian units, an estimated 100,000 soldiers and civilians were killed in the furious warfare, including over 10,000 of Ashoka's own men. Hundreds of thousands of people were adversely affected by the destruction and fallout of war. When he personally witnessed the devastation, Ashoka began feeling remorse. Although the annexation of Kalinga was completed, Ashoka embraced the teachings of Buddhism, and renounced war and violence. He sent out missionaries to travel around Asia and spread Buddhism to other countries.|$|E
25|$|Lee managed 96 senior {{appearances}} for West Adelaide <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>his</b> post playing {{contribution to}} South Australian football {{that he is}} remembered for. From 1966 to 1973 and then from 1979 to 1988 he served as the President of the West Adelaide Football Club. He was the SANFL's Vice President in a long stint which began in 1981 and ended in 1999. Lee was also a League Director for 18 years, the SANFL Vice Patron, on the Management Committee for 12 years, Chairman of the SANFL Umpires Board {{for three years and}} served on the South Australian Football Commission. He also represented football in the state on a national level by standing in the National Australian Football Council as South Australia's representative, from 1981 to 1990 and spending three years at Chairman of Selectors.

25|$|McGeer's most {{indelible}} mark in BC {{was made}} {{during his time}} as Mayor of Vancouver. He won the 1934 election against incumbent L. D. Taylor with the biggest margin of victory in Vancouver's civic history. He established himself in his campaign as a populist reformer, painting his opponent as outdated and corrupt, with police and monetary reform the two main pillars of his campaign. As mayor, {{he would not have}} power to implement his monetary policies, which he believed could end the depression. He was, however, able to reform the police department and the civic government, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>his</b> battles against communism that garnered him the most publicity, at least in his first year in office. Unemployed men in the federal relief camps had been organized by Communist agitators into the Relief Camp Workers' Union. They struck on 4 April 1935 and arrived in Vancouver on boxcars shortly thereafter. The men stayed in Vancouver for two months, marching daily in protest of relief camp conditions.|$|E
