For example, {{from the second}} <b>body</b> <b>block</b> in Fig.  1, two component queries are generated: “It {{was the best of}} Twitter It” and “was the worst of Twitter” given σ _qmax = 14 and σ _qmin = 4. We then formulate compound queries by (1) selecting two <b>body</b> <b>blocks</b> containing any unused component query and (2) combining a component query in the first block with a space character and another component query from the second one. For example, in the case shown in Fig.  1, two component queries, “JAMES C BEST JR THE NEW YORK TIMES” from the first <b>body</b> <b>block</b> and “It was the best of Twitter It” from the second, are combined into one compound query, i.e., “JAMES C BEST JR THE NEW YORK TIMES” “It was the best of Twitter It”. When there remains no component query in one of the two <b>body</b> <b>blocks,</b> we select another <b>body</b> <b>block</b> according to the occurring order.

40|$|Abstract InChIKey is a 27 -character {{compacted}} (hashed) {{version of}} InChI which {{is intended for}} Internet and database searching/indexing {{and is based on}} an SHA- 256 hash of the InChI character string. The first block of InChIKey encodes molecular skeleton while the second block represents various kinds of isomerism (stereo, tautomeric, etc.). InChIKey is designed to be a nearly unique substitute for the parent InChI. However, a single InChIKey may occasionally map to two or more InChI strings (collision). The appearance of collision itself does not compromise the signature as collision-free hashing is impossible; the only viable approach is to set and keep a reasonable level of collision resistance which is sufficient for typical applications. We tested, in computational experiments, how well the real-life InChIKey collision resistance corresponds to the theoretical estimates expected by design. For this purpose, we analyzed the statistical characteristics of InChIKey for datasets of variable size in comparison to the theoretical statistical frequencies. For the relatively short second block, an exhaustive direct testing was performed. We computed and compared to theory the numbers of collisions for the stereoisomers of Spongistatin I (using the whole set of 67, 108, 864 isomers and its subsets). For the longer first block, we generated, using custom-made software, InChIKeys for more than 3 [*]×[*] 10 10 chemical structures. The statistical behavior of this block was tested by comparison of experimental and theoretical frequencies for the various four-letter sequences which may appear in the first <b>block</b> <b>body.</b> From the results of our computational experiments we conclude that the observed characteristics of InChIKey collision resistance are in good agreement with theoretical expectations. </p...|$|E

Cedar Rapids, IA (SeM)) and DE manipulation on plasma, muscle, and colostrum Se concentrations, plasma glutathione peroxidase (Gsh-Px) activity, foaling parameters, and physical characteristics in mares and their foals. Mares were arranged in a 2 x 2 factorial with two levels of nutrition, pasture (100 % NRC DE) or pasture plus grain (120 % NRC DE) (fed at 0. 75 % BW (0. 63 ppm Se)) and two levels of Se supplementation (0 or 0. 3 mg/kg DM) equaling four treatment groups: pasture (P), pasture grain (PG), pasture grain Se (PGS), or pasture Se (PS). Mares were blocked by expected foaling date and randomly assigned to dietary treatment within <b>block.</b> <b>Body</b> condition score (BCS), BW, and rump fat (RF) were observed every 14 d beginning at d 0. Mare and foal plasma and muscle sampling began on d 0 (birth in foals). Plasma continued every 14 d and muscle every 28 d until parturition (d 56 in foals). Upon parturition, foaling parameters consisting of times: water break to birth, birth to placenta expulsion, foal standing, and nursing were recorded. Colostrum quality was determined via refractometer and colostrometer analysis, and placenta weight, foal birth weight, whither and hip height and body length were recorded. Maternal SeM supplementation influenced (P 0. 05) by DE. Mare and foal plasma Gsh-Px, foal physical characteristics, and foaling parameters were unaffected by treatment (P> 0. 05). Greater (P< 0. 02) colostrum refractometer values (Brix%) for P, PS mares were noted and PGS, P mares had shorter gestational lengths (nutrition x SeM interaction (P< 0. 05)). These data indicate that maternal DE manipulation and SeM supplementation influences mare and foal Se status, mare BW and colostrum quality (Brix%), but not plasma Gsh-Px activity. Additionally, nutrition and SeM supplementation may affect gestational length. However, despite treatments {{there was no difference}} in foaling parameters or foal physical characteristics...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{examines}} {{the results of}} using the 3 d-printing educational methodology for training {{the students in the}} spacecraft-configuration developing area. The first purpose of the considered methodology practice is to implement the rapid-prototyping skills into the educational process, to provide perfection of the student knowledge in configuring the internal on-board equipment of the spacecraft. The second purpose – is to habituate the students to the main principles of the available CAM technologies, to fill the available educational gap in the area of information support of the spacecraft life-cycle. The proposed curriculum includes six training exercises based on a special “Engineering drawing” course unit. The training exercises require using the SolidWorks geometric-simulation software. The preliminary obtained virtual prototypes of the spacecraft configuration elements are subjected to 3 d-printing and assembled into a physical configuration model. The physical configuration models are obtained using one of the most accessible rapid-prototyping technologies – 3 d-printing of extrusion type. Practicing in 3 d-printing provides developing the student skills in managing all other digital-program control devices. The specified first experience of integrating the computer geometricsimulation methodology and the 3 d-printing practices in a single course unit has proved: developing the physical-configuration models heightens the student interest to the configuration training. A ready-made physical model does not excuse the available configuration mistakes unlike a virtual model where the component interferences may remain undetected. So, developing a physical model requires additional endeavor and responsibility. Developing a project in a team has proved to be an effective means for solving a common creative problem. The first test of the proposed methodology has shown the importance of perfect adjustment of the available 3 d-printing process and the Slicer program. The part-model manufacture cycle requires approximately from 2 to 3 hours per a component (from 1 to 1. 5 hours for 3 d-printing in that account). Large-scale blocks shall represent an assembly (containing a <b>block</b> <b>body</b> and a lid) to reduce the printing-plastic consumption. Average printing-plastic consumption is about 1 kg per a configuration model. The obtained 3 d-printing experience shows that the printing speed is much more important than the printing accuracy for the given educational problem. The obtained educational-methodology test results are considered to be a success. It is recommended to purchase an additional high-productivity 3 d-printer facility providing an effective fascinating spacecraftconfiguration process. </p...|$|E

30|$|Overall, the CRF {{method is}} much better than {{heuristic}} rules in labeling blocks. Table  2 shows that the Heuristic method performs badly on title prediction in terms of precision (only 0.34).

Such a decision somehow hurts the recall of <b>body</b> <b>blocks.</b> Thus {{it is not surprising that}} the Heuristic method performs worse than the CRF method in terms of recall for <b>body</b> <b>blocks.</b> The Heuristic method is also worse than the CRF method by 21 points in terms of precision for bodies. This is strong evidence that the Heuristic method is not effective in distinguishing a <b>body</b> <b>block</b> from other blocks, whereas, the CRF method achieves precision as high as 0.967. The CRF method is also effective in identifying a title block while rejecting others as it achieves 0.928 precision for titles.|$|R
