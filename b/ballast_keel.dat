5000|$|The 22.25 m ketch Pen Duick VI {{was built}} in 1973 to an [...] design. She entered the 1973-74 Whitbread Round the World Race, but endured mast {{breakage}} on two occasions.

Pen Duick VI later competed against the carbonfiber-masted Heath's Condor in the 1977-78 Whitbread Round the World Race (see Volvo Ocean Race) as an unofficial entrant, due to its own exotic material - depleted uranium <b>ballasted</b> <b>keel.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Adding a sail to {{a narrow}} hull like a canoe is a {{dangerous}} proposition, especially {{given the lack of}} dense materials like lead {{that can be used in}} a <b>ballasted</b> <b>keel</b> to counter the heeling moment of the sail. Attaching two dugout canoes together to form a catamaran hull provides stability, but this is an expensive operation. [...] For men using nothing but fire and stone tools, building a hull is a long and labor-intensive process. [...] The traditional proa's simple outrigger—a log hewn to a point at each end—can be produced with far less effort, and provides the needed stability to counter the force of a large sail.|$|R
5000|$|A {{catamaran}} (...) (informally, a [...] "cat") is a multi-hulled watercraft featuring {{two parallel}} hulls of equal size. It is a geometry-stabilized craft, deriving its stability from its wide beam, {{rather than from}} a <b>ballasted</b> <b>keel</b> as with a monohull sailboat. Being ballast-free and therefore lighter than a monohull, catamarans often have a shallower draft (draught) than comparably-sized monohulls. The two hulls combined also often have a smaller hydrodynamic resistance than comparable monohulls, requiring less propulsive power from either sails or motors. The catamaran's wider stance on the water can reduce both heeling and wave-induced motion, as compared with a monohull, and can give reduced wakes.|$|R
50|$|Its iron <b>ballast</b> <b>keel</b> {{represents}} {{more than}} half of this displacement, making the Folkboat extremely stiff and seaworthy, and {{it is one of the}} smallest craft to have made regular ocean crossings and circumnavigations.|$|E
5000|$|The Tomozuru {{incident}} {{affected the}} No. 1-class. The No. 1 and the No. 2 {{were sent to}} the Uraga Dock Company in July 1934, and repairs were started.

50|$|The U-Boat was a {{redesigned}} Karp class submarine by Spanish engineer Raimondo Lorenzo d'Equevilley Montjustin {{working for}} the German armaments company Krupp. The main improvements over the export Karp class included trim tanks instead of a moveable weight, a redesigned forecastle to improve seagoing ability, a 10 cm larger diameter and strengthened pressure hull which prevented oil leakage from the external tanks, a rearrangement of the internal equipment and a heavier <b>ballast</b> <b>keel.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{hull of the}} Contessa 32 is {{generally}} seen as a cross between older and newer designs. She has the well <b>ballasted</b> <b>keel,</b> low centre of gravity, and narrow beam of traditional English cutters, but has a fin keel characteristic of newer, lighter racing yachts. The narrow beam and substantial ballast provide {{a high degree of}} positive stability, with an AVS of 155°, although due to her small size the STIX is only 33. If knocked down or capsized, the Contessa readily rights herself. Because it is shorter than a full-length keel, a fin keel creates less drag. The blending of the keel into the hull forward captures the lateral stability of a full keel, and with the cut away aft portion lends greater responsiveness to the helm. While the skeg bestows additional lateral resistance to the hull aft producing directional stability, its robust design also supports and protects the rudder.|$|R

[...] Catamaran is a Tamil word Kattumaram (கட்டுமரம்) - logs tied together - [...] which is used from ancient times to ship heavy shipment over shallow water bodies. Hundred of elephant fleets were shipped by Tamil kings with Catamaran to conquer East Asian countries in 10th century BC. Catamaran is hull free and therefore lighter than a monohull, catamarans often have a shallower draft (draught) than comparably-sized monohulls.

50|$|The Rustler 36 is a {{cruising}} yacht {{produced by}} Rustler Yachts of Falmouth. First {{produced in the}} early 1980s by Orion Marine, the yacht is of modern GRP construction, but retains the well <b>ballasted</b> long <b>keel</b> and strong construction of the traditional British sailing yacht. The high standard of construction and traditional highly seaworthy profile differentiate it from cheaper, more lightly built mass production yachts such as the Beneteau range.|$|R
5000|$|Helen Smitton is a non-self-righting, 38-ft Watson-class {{lifeboat}} {{constructed from}} Honduras mahogany on Canadian rock elm frames and stringers. Her floors are iron. A layer of calico coated with white lead paste sits between each {{layer of the}} hull. A 1.5 ton fixed iron <b>ballast</b> <b>keel</b> and a triangular drop keel that passes through the fixed keel are present. She was powered by a 37hp Wolseley petrol engine. That engine is now missing.|$|E
50|$|The replica vessel is not {{an exact}} reconstruction. It has a diesel {{auxiliary}} engine and otherwise conforms to Coast Guard regulations in order to carry passengers. The modern version is framed with osage orange and planked with oak; there is a lead <b>ballast</b> <b>keel</b> which the original did not have. She has only four guns, rather than the original eight. All work and can be fired. Within modern safety requirements, however, she was built following traditional methods as much as possible.|$|E

5000|$|Applications {{requiring}} {{its high}} density include weights, counterweights, <b>ballast</b> <b>keels</b> for yachts, tail ballast for commercial aircraft, and as ballast in race cars for NASCAR and Formula One; depleted uranium {{is also used}} for these purposes, due to similarly high density. Seventy-five-kg blocks of tungsten were used as [...] "cruise balance mass devices" [...] on the entry vehicle portion of the 2012 Mars Science Laboratory spacecraft. It is an ideal material {{to use as a}} dolly for riveting, where the mass necessary for good results can be achieved in a compact bar. High-density alloys of tungsten with nickel, copper or iron are used in high-quality darts (to allow for a smaller diameter and thus tighter groupings) or for fishing lures (tungsten beads allow the fly to sink rapidly). Some cello C strings are wound with tungsten. The extra density gives this string more projection and often cellists will buy just this string and use it with three strings from a different set. Tungsten is used as an absorber on the electron telescope on the Cosmic Ray System of the two Voyager spacecraft.|$|R
50|$|The {{training}} ship {{was designed to}} be robust and safe against capsizing. More than 300 tons of steel <b>ballast</b> in the <b>keel</b> give her a righting moment large enough to bring her back in the upright position even when she heels over to nearly a 90°.|$|R
50|$|In 1961, Rayners Westcoaster {{was briefly}} {{followed}} by the rotund, though equally seaworthy, Corvette - a 5-ton sloop with full standing headroom. The problem he solved with this prototype {{was to find a}} way of bending a marine-ply shell in two dimensions, creating a stronger and more attractive hull, on which the hard chine that had characterised plywood yachts including his Westcoaster, was so softened as to make it almost invisible. Rayners people did this, under his direction, by steaming ply and laminating thinner sheets to achieve a compound bend of the necessary thickness. Refining the twin <b>ballast</b> <b>keels</b> of the Westcoaster, Rayner gave the Corvette - called Danica by her owner the broadcaster Jack Hargreaves - hydrofoil sectioned twin keels, flat on the outside and curved on the inside and very slightly toed in. As well as serving the same function as fin keels, the leeward moulded bilge keel used the Bernoullis principle, to resist leeward drift as the boat heeled on a beat. Hargreaves stepson with a companion, Chris Jameson, as her skipper, proved Danica by taking her through France by river and canal and on through the Mediterranean to Athens, returning via the Bay of Biscay where she successfully weathered F10 gale force winds (September 1962), but her construction costs focused Rayners attention on the emerging technology of glass-reinforced plastic (GRP).|$|R

5000|$|The new {{schooner}} {{was built}} using a general {{knowledge of the}} Baltimore Clippers and art drawings from the era. Some of the tools used in the project {{were the same as}} those that might have been used by a 19th-century shipwright, while others were powered. Tri-Coastal Marine, designers of [...] "Freedom Schooner Amistad", used modern computer technology to develop plans for the vessel. Bronze bolts are used as fastenings throughout the ship. Freedom Schooner Amistad has an external <b>ballast</b> <b>keel</b> made of lead and two Caterpillar diesel engines. None of this technology was available to 19th-century builders.|$|E
50|$|Centreboards {{are often}} {{ballasted}} in keelboats. Ballasted centreboards {{are generally not}} locked in place when lowered; {{the mass of the}} ballast keeps them down. This also provides a measure of safety should the boat run aground - the force of impact will push the foil back into the centreboard trunk, rather than breaking it, as might happen if the board were locked in place. The mass of a ballasted foil means that a system of pulleys may be required to allow the sailor to lift the foil, and a method of latching the board in the upward position is needed. A centreboard differs from a <b>ballast</b> <b>keel</b> in that centreboards do not contribute to the stability of the vessel; their purpose is to provide lateral resistance. In small sailing dinghies it is rare to find a ballasted centreboard.|$|E
50|$|A large draft ensures a good {{level of}} {{stability}} in strong wind, {{as the center}} of gravity is lower (<b>ballast</b> over the <b>keel</b> of the boat). For example: Ballasts placed very low in the keel of a boat such as a dragon boat with a draft of 1.20 m for a length of 8.90 m.|$|R
50|$|There are {{disadvantages}} {{to using}} high-density ballast. The {{first is the}} increased mass of the boat; a heavier boat sits lower in the water, increasing drag when it moves, and is generally less responsive to steering. A heavier boat is also more difficult {{to put on a}} trailer and tow behind an automobile. Secondly, since the ballast needs to be as low as possible, it is often placed into a centerboard or retracting keel, requiring a heavy-duty crank to lift the massive foil. The simplest solution is to use a fixed <b>ballasted</b> <b>keel,</b> but that makes the boat nearly incapable of sailing in very shallow water, and more difficult to handle when out of the water. While prohibited by most class racing rules, some cutting-edge boats use a bulb of ballast on a long, thin keel that can tilt from side to side to create a canting keel. This lets the ballast be placed on the windward side, providing a far greater righting moment with a lower angle of heel. Tilting the keel, however, greatly reduces its lift, so canting keels are usually combined with a retractable centerboard or daggerboard that is deployed when the keel is tilted, and retracted (to reduce drag) when the keel is returned to the vertical. Some canting keels are designed so that when fully extended to either side they have an angle of attack of about 5° allowing the hydrofoil effect of the blade to lift the boat up and reduce wetted surface area for an increase in boat speed.|$|R
25|$|As {{mentioned}} above, {{the reason}} for employing keelmen was the poor state of the navigation on the Tyne and Wear, which prevented ships from moving up river without danger of grounding. As time went by this situation gradually worsened. Colliers arriving at the river mouth would have a ballast of sand {{that had to be}} disposed of. The correct method of doing this was to deposit the sand on specified areas on the riverbank provided for the purpose or by depositing the sand in the sea. The Wear had <b>ballast</b> <b>keels</b> that were used to unload the ballast from colliers and take it out to sea. There were penalties for depositing ballast in the river, but this often occurred. The result was that the riverbed became silted up, causing even more navigational difficulties. Additionally, industry on the riverbanks often deposited its waste products in the river. The situation on the Tyne became so bad that in 1850 the Tyne Navigation Act was passed, which gave control of the river to the Tyne Improvement Commission. This body began an extensive program of dredging to substantially deepen the riverbed. This program was completed in 1888 so that the largest colliers could pass right up to Newcastle and beyond. This deepening of the river meant that colliers could load coal from the staithes without the need for keels to complete the work. In 1876 the existing bridge at Newcastle was replaced by the Swing Bridge, which rotated to allow ships to pass up and down river. This allowed colliers to be loaded from staithes above Newcastle and so further sealed the fate of the keelmen.|$|R
40|$|The use of fin keels and ballast bulbs {{on modern}} {{high-performance}} yachts presumably {{means that the}} design and performance characteristics of such appendages {{are more or less}} well understood, but the question of how much to incline the bulb of a <b>ballast</b> <b>keel</b> seems to have little hard analysis in the open literature. This paper attempts to provide a brief theoretical analysis and derived VPP predictions. There are some practical results from radio-controlled racing yachts. Velocity prediction programs (VPPs) are general-purpose tools that model the major factors affecting a yacht’s performance, and may often not accommodate a particular variable of interest. The paper outlines a simple technique for employing a general-purpose VPP to explore the effect of variables that are considered "not available" in that VPP, illustrated by using the technique {{to address the problem of}} the appropriate angle of inclination for a ballast bulb...|$|E
50|$|In sailing, the A-Scow {{is a large}} sailing scow. It is 38 {{feet long}} and with {{reported}} top speeds of over 25 knots. With its rules of design, also known as scantlings, the A-Scow has a significant history. With a large sail area and little <b>keel</b> <b>ballast,</b> the five to seven crew members must work in unison on the A-Scow to keep the boat sailing fast and upright. The boat is mainly sailed in Minnesota and Wisconsin.|$|R
50|$|Pocket cruisers {{range in}} length from 10 to about 26 ft, with some variation, {{depending}} on individual requirements. Most {{are in the}} range of 15 to 20 ft long, with a beam around 6 ft. Commercial models generally have either a short, <b>ballasted</b> shoal draft <b>keel</b> or a weighted centerboard, while home-built designs often use water ballast and leeboards. The short length and low weight of most pocket cruisers (and short keels on models with fixed keels) allow them to be trailered easily.|$|R
50|$|Lateral {{force is}} a {{reaction}} {{supplied by the}} underwater shape of a sailboat, the blades of an ice boat and the wheels of a land sailing craft. Sailboats rely on keels, centerboards, and other underwater foils, including rudders, that provide lift in the lateral direction, to provide hydrodynamic lateral force (PLAT) to offset the lateral force component acting on the sail (FLAT) and minimize leeway. Such foils provide hydrodynamic lift and, for <b>keels,</b> <b>ballast</b> to offset heeling. They incorporate {{a wide variety of}} design considerations.|$|R
5|$|Its {{high density}} and {{resistance}} to corrosion have been exploited {{in a number of}} related applications. It is used as <b>ballast</b> in sailboat <b>keels.</b> Its weight allows it to counterbalance the heeling effect of wind on the sails; being so dense it takes up a small volume and minimizes water resistance. It is used in scuba diving weight belts to counteract the diver's buoyancy. In 1993, the base of the Leaning Tower of Pisa was stabilized with 600 tonnes of lead. Because of its corrosion resistance, lead is used as a protective sheath for underwater cables.|$|R
50|$|Later on, {{numerous}} {{options were}} available making the boats essentially semi-custom. For example, in 1985 the options list included {{a choice of}} interior wood, counter material, cabin floor, exterior rubbing rails, higher/deeper toe rails, teak swim ladder, a choice of engines, instrumentation options, and so on. Bristols were typically built more heavily than many comparable production sailboats, with features such as skeg-hung rudders, keel-stepped masts, fully encapsulated <b>keel</b> <b>ballast,</b> interior cabinetry bonded to the hull for strength, heavy-duty bronze seacocks, and heavy fibreglass lay-up. Most Bristols can be raced using the PHRF handicap system, despite being designed more for cruising and comfort.|$|R

60|$|But the Snark sailed. It was {{the only}} way she could get anywhere. She sailed for two years, and never touched rock, reef, nor shoal. She had no inside <b>ballast,</b> her iron <b>keel</b> weighed five tons, but her deep draught and high {{freeboard}} made her very stiff. Caught under full sail in tropic squalls, she buried her rail and deck many times, but stubbornly refused to turn turtle. She steered easily, and she could run day and night, without steering, close-by, full- and-by, and with the wind abeam. With the wind on her quarter and the sails properly trimmed, she steered herself within two points, and with the wind almost astern she required scarcely three points for self-steering.|$|R
50|$|Most of {{the boat}} was buried deep enough in the sand to be {{isolated}} from the aerobic conditions that would have degraded the wood and the seawater and its corrosive effect on metals. It was subsequently superbly preserved. Exploration started at the stern and moved forward. Only {{a few feet of}} the hull were excavated, mapped and photographed at a time, to prevent wave damage to exposed sections. Several of the planks had to be sawed or broken for removal, transportation and conservation, especially as prolonged underwater exposure might have caused significant damage. The preserved hull is 37 feet (11.25 metres) long and 13.1 feet (4 metres) wide, with an estimated displacement weight of 20 tons, over 12 of which was <b>ballast.</b> The <b>keel</b> consists of a single timber 25 feet (8.5 metres) long, 4.5 inches (11 cm) wide and 6.25 inches (16 cm) high. The hull was constructed primarily of Aleppo pine, except for the tenons and the false keel which were made of oak. The wood shows no sign of shipworm damage nor the wear characteristic of lengthy use, leading the excavators to believe the ship may have sunk on its maiden voyage or not long afterwards.|$|R
5000|$|Bolger evolved {{the concept}} of {{traditional}} sharpies and by squaring off the bow and stern to give the longest useful waterline. Most were configured as yawls (with main mast quite far forward and a small mizzen far aft). The bow on these designs is cut off and blunt and the sterns are vertical. In some designe an open bow can allow passage to land if the boat is beached, space for holding anchors and cables, or clearance to step and unstep a mast. Oldshoe, Micro and Long Micro have shallow <b>ballasted</b> full length <b>keels</b> whereas {{what he called the}} [...] "Advanced Sharpies" [...] AS19, AS29 and AS39 have one or two bilgeboards and inside ballast.

5000|$|It {{is a small}} [...] "pocket cruiser" [...] sailboat. Com-pac 16’s are 16 {{feet long}} (4.87m) with a beam of 6 feet (1.82m). They have a shoal draft keel and draw 18 inches (46cm). They are {{generally}} thought of as being very seaworthy vessels. A Com-pac 16 displaces approximately 1100 pounds (499 kg) with 450 pounds (204 kg)of that as <b>ballast</b> in the <b>keel.</b> A relatively high ratio of keel weight to boat weight make the Com-pac resistant to heeling or overturning.The Com-pac’s stability lends to its popularity. Although it {{has been out of}} production for approximately 10 years, there is an active online community for the Com-pac 16 (as well as other Com-pac models). Com-pac owners routinely share ideas, boat modifications, and experiences.|$|R
50|$|In sailboats, keels use {{the forward}} {{motion of the}} boat to {{generate}} lift to counteract the leeward force of the wind. The rudimentary purpose of the keel is to convert the sideways motion of the wind when it is abeam into forward motion. A secondary purpose of the keel is to provide ballast.Keels are different from centreboards {{and other types of}} foils in that keels are made of heavy materials to provide ballast to stabilize the boat. Keels may be fixed, or non-movable, or they may retract to allow sailing in shallower waters. Retracting keels may pivot (a swing keel) or slide upwards to retract, and are usually retracted with a winch due to the weight of the <b>ballast.</b> Since the <b>keel</b> provides far more stability when lowered than when retracted (due to the greater moment arm involved), the amount of sail carried is generally reduced when sailing with the keel retracted.|$|R
