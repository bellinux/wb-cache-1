25|$|During and {{following}} the five-day Second Battle of El Alamein artillery barrage that commenced {{on the night of}} 23 October 1942, six squadrons of Hurricanes, including the 40mm cannon-armed Hurricane Mk.IID version, claimed to have destroyed 39 tanks, 212 lorries and armoured troop-carriers, 26 <b>bowsers,</b> 42 guns, 200 various other vehicles and four small fuel and ammunition dumps, flying 842 sorties with the loss of 11 pilots. Whilst performing in a ground support role, Hurricanes based at RAF Castel Benito, Tripoli, knocked out six tanks, 13 armoured vehicles, 10 lorries, five half-tracks, a gun and trailer, and a wireless van on 10 March 1943, with no losses to themselves.|$|E
25|$|The {{tracks in}} Mario Kart Wii are based thematically on {{locations}} {{seen in the}} Mario series, such as <b>Bowsers</b> Castle. Each of the eight cups features four different tracks {{for a total of}} 32 unique tracks, 16 of which are new to the series, while 16 other are several tracks ported from previous installments. The cups (groups of tracks) are the Mushroom, Flower, Star, Special, Shell, Banana, Leaf, and Lightning Cups. The Shell, Banana, Leaf, and Lightning Cups each contain retro tracks, updated versions of tracks originally found in the five previous Mario Kart installments. In addition there are ten arena courses available for Battle mode, which includes five original courses and five retro courses.|$|E
25|$|Fuel {{dispensers}} {{are used}} to pump petrol/gasoline, diesel, compressed natural gas, CGH2, HCNG, LPG, liquid hydrogen, kerosene, alcohol fuel (like methanol, ethanol, butanol, propanol), biofuels (like straight vegetable oil, biodiesel), or other types of fuel into the tanks within vehicles and calculate the financial cost of the fuel transferred to the vehicle. Fuel dispensers are also known as <b>bowsers</b> (in some parts of Australia), petrol pumps (in most Commonwealth countries) or gas pumps (in North America). Besides fuel dispensers, one other significant device which {{is also found in}} filling stations and can refuel certain (compressed-air) vehicles is an air compressor, although generally these are just used to inflate car tyres. Also, many filling stations incorporate a convenience store, which like most other buildings generally have electricity sockets; hence plug-in electric vehicles can be recharged.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the next}} sequel, <b>Bowser's</b> Inside Story, Fawful {{served as the}} primary {{antagonist}} and villain, assisted by his sidekick Midbus. In this game, he causes <b>Bowser</b> to inhale Mario and Luigi into his body and infects {{the residents of the}} Mushroom Kingdom with the [...] "Blorbs" [...] disease, caused by poisonous mushrooms. He absorbed part of the power of an evil entity called the Dark Star with his robotic helmet, but <b>Bowser</b> interrupted the process, causing the weakened Dark Star to go in his lung to read his DNA. Mario and Luigi defeated the Dark Star and destroy its body, which turns it in dark dust. The Dark Star came outside from <b>Bowser</b> and created a new body called Dark <b>Bowser</b> from <b>Bowser's</b> DNA. However, Fawful absorbed part of Dark <b>Bowser's</b> force. <b>Bowser</b> and Dark <b>Bowser</b> searched for Fawful while Fawful searched for Dark <b>Bowser</b> to gain all of its power. <b>Bowser</b> found Fawful first and defeated him, reducing him to a black, spider-like blob, but he escaped from <b>Bowser.</b> Dark <b>Bowser</b> then found Fawful and inhaled him to regain his full power. Later, <b>Bowser</b> battled him, but after being defeated, Fawful, now stronger from the completed dark powers, heals him and makes him grow larger. The only way to defeat him was by punching Dark <b>Bowser's</b> belly, making him spit out Fawful. After <b>Bowser</b> inhales him in the battle, Mario and Luigi battle Fawful in <b>Bowser's</b> body. After being defeated, Dark <b>Bowser</b> destabilizes and is easily defeated with several punches from <b>Bowser.</b> Dark <b>Bowser</b> combusts in colorful sparks and Fawful, who is severely weakened after the battle, promises that he will be good, but lies. He blows himself up in an attempt to take down Mario and Luigi with him, but the brothers survive the explosion.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Bowser</b> {{also has}} a son, <b>Bowser</b> Jr., who helps his father kidnap Princess Peach. <b>Bowser</b> Jr.'s mother is unknown, as <b>Bowser</b> isn't officially {{confirmed}} as having a previous marriage yet. Originally in Super Mario Bros. 3, <b>Bowser</b> was stated {{to be the father}} of the Koopalings with subsequent official sources adding that he was their biological father, but since their return in New Super Mario Bros. Wii they have been referred to as <b>Bowser's</b> minions and in an interview held in 2012 Shigeru Miyamoto stated that [...] "Our current story is that the seven Koopalings are not <b>Bowser's</b> children. <b>Bowser's</b> only child is <b>Bowser</b> Jr., and we do not know who the mother is.".|$|R
500|$|Game Informers Andrew Reiner {{cited the}} example of coin {{redistribution}} in the game, which meant that [...] "You could win every minigame and collect the most coins but still end up in last place", when giving a second opinion of the game. While acknowledging issues relating to the waiting times during board games, IGN's Peer Schneider praised this installment for relieving the problem slightly, specifically referring to the Mini <b>Bowsers,</b> who all take their turns {{at the same time}} in [...] "Story" [...] mode. The quantity and accessibility of the minigames was lauded by GameSpot, although the reviewer Ryan Davis proceeded to note [...] "If you bought Mario Party 4 last year, Mario Party 5 is hard to recommend.", noting a lack of change to the series formula. Generally, critics cited having a fun experience in Mario Party 5, although the minigames received a more enthusiastic reaction than the actual board game, with GameSpy commenting that [...] "the sheer volume can keep you compelled. If only you didn't have to deal with all that BS in-between" [...] when referring to gameplay of the actual board game.|$|E
2500|$|By 24 July, an {{estimated}} 420,000 people were without drinking water, including {{most of the}} population of Gloucester, Cheltenham, and Tewkesbury. Emergency services continued repair work at the Mythe water-treatment works but Severn Trent Water estimated that water supplies would not be restored for at least 14 days. 900 drinking water <b>bowsers</b> were brought in and the Army was mobilised to distribute three million bottles of water a day and keep the <b>bowsers</b> filled. Coors, Carlsberg, Scottish and Newcastle, Inbev and Greene King brewing companies offered 23 beer tankers to help supply drinking water.

50|$|<b>Bowser</b> confronts Fawful in the {{transformed}} Peach's {{castle and}} defeats Midbus. The Dark Star's seal finally breaks, and Fawful tries to absorb its power, only for <b>Bowser</b> to punch him away. The Dark Star then enters <b>Bowser's</b> body, where {{it begins to}} leech on his cells and absorb his DNA. Despite the Mario Bros. efforts to stop it, the Dark Star escapes and searches for Fawful to reclaim the power stolen from it, only for <b>Bowser</b> to find and defeat Fawful first. The Dark Star absorbs Fawful's remains and, using <b>Bowser's</b> DNA, becomes a shadowy, powerful doppelg√§nger of <b>Bowser,</b> named Dark <b>Bowser.</b> <b>Bowser</b> battles Dark <b>Bowser</b> and, {{with the help of}} Mario and Luigi, destroys the Dark Star. Fawful, having been inhaled by <b>Bowser</b> during the battle, initially feigns remorse but suddenly self-destructs in a final effort to destroy the Mario Bros. The explosion causes <b>Bowser</b> to regurgitate everyone he had inhaled. Enraged by the discovery, <b>Bowser</b> proceeds to fight the Mario Bros. but is defeated and retreats back to his castle. The two castles are rebuilt, and Peach sends <b>Bowser</b> a cake as gratitude for his unintentionally heroic efforts.|$|R

2500|$|Toad has {{appeared}} {{in many of the}} various Mario spin-off games. In the Mario Kart series, of which he {{has appeared}} in every installment, Toad is usually featured as a lightweight driver with good acceleration to compensate for his speed. His partner Toadette was created for [...] and together they shared a special item, the Super Mushroom, which allowed them to take multiple boosts for a short while. The item reappears in later Mario Kart games, but is renamed the Golden Mushroom. Toadette, who {{has appeared in}} other spin-off games since her first appearance, was stated to be Toad's sister in an official Prima strategy guide for Mario Kart Wii (though this relationship between Toad and Toadette has yet to be confirmed by Nintendo itself). He appears in his own tournament for Mario Kart Wii, where the player goes through Mushroom Gorge backwards using Toad as their character. Toad even receives his own tracks throughout the installments such as his own circuit (named after himself) in Mario Kart 7. He appears in every Mario Party game; however, it is only from Mario Party 5 and on that he is playable (excluding Mario Party Advance), as he was a host for the earlier games in the series, and even a damsel in distress character for Mario Party 2 after several Baby <b>Bowsers</b> abduct him. Toad appears in the various Mario sports games. In Mario Superstar Baseball, Toad appears as a team member whose chemistry refers to his background; for example, he has good chemistry with Princess Peach and Toadette but bad chemistry with Wario. Toad also appears in the sequel, Mario Super Sluggers, again as a team member along with other differently colored toads. He also appears as a team member with good techniques in Mario Strikers and he also appears in its sequel Mario Strikers Charged with the same role. His sidekick role is retained in , where he accompanies either Mario or Luigi to help get back the musical keys from the villains of the game. Mini Toads (toy versions of Toad) are included as playable characters throughout the Mario vs. Donkey Kong series, starting with [...] Mini Toads make a returning appearance the in 2010 release of [...] as playable characters who assist Mario on his journey to rescue his friend Pauline from the clutches of Donkey Kong.

Another Mystery Mushroom costume based on Captain Toad from [...] was also made available through an update. In Super Mario Run, Toad is one of six playable characters and it can be unlocked by connecting a My Nintendo account. In addition, he is the referee of Toad Rally if players use Toadette.|$|E
5|$|Despite <b>Bowser's</b> demise in {{the first}} level, this does not stop <b>Bowser</b> Jr. from running through the {{remaining}} worlds with Peach in tow, forcing Mario to chase after him before reaching <b>Bowser's</b> castle in world 8. There, <b>Bowser</b> Jr. revives his father's skeleton, creating Dry <b>Bowser,</b> but Mario once again defeats <b>Bowser</b> by dropping him into a deep pit. In the final battle, <b>Bowser</b> Jr. flees once more across a lava chasm to a larger castle, where he throws his father's bones into a cauldron and revives <b>Bowser</b> in his original form. They attack Mario in tandem, but Mario drops the pair into the pit below. In the game's final sequence, Mario rescues Peach, who kisses him on the cheek. Over the end credits, <b>Bowser</b> Jr. is seen dragging his unconscious father across the floor. He looks at the screen, and growls, breaking the fourth wall.|$|R

In January 2013, May spotted <b>Bowser</b> at an awards ceremony in the Congress Heights neighborhood, and offered her support. When Vision of Victory opened Roundtree Residences, a 91-unit affordable-housing community, May invited <b>Bowser</b> to attend to give the mayoral candidate more visibility in Ward 8. May quickly became part of a very tight inner circle of <b>Bowser</b> supporters. <b>Bowser</b> named May her Ward 8 field coordinator when <b>Bowser</b> ran for the Democratic Party's mayoral nomination in 2013.
