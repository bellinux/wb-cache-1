5|$|Although {{sometimes}} {{the construction of}} a castle led to the destruction of a village, such as at Eaton Socon in England, it was more common for the villages nearby to have grown {{as a result of the}} presence of a castle. Sometimes planned towns or villages were created around a castle. The <b>benefits</b> <b>of</b> castle building on settlements was not confined to Europe. When the 13th-century Safad Castle was founded in Galilee in the Holy Land, the 260villages benefitted from the inhabitants' newfound ability to move freely. When built, a castle could result in the restructuring of the local landscape, with roads moved for the convenience of the lord. Settlements could also grow naturally around a castle, rather than being planned, due to the <b>benefits</b> <b>of</b> proximity to an economic centre in a rural landscape and the safety given by the defences. Not all such settlements survived, as once the castle lost its importance– perhaps succeeded by a manor house as the centre of administration– the <b>benefits</b> <b>of</b> living next to a castle vanished and the settlement depopulated.|$|E

5|$|Crossbred cows produce up to, and in {{some cases}} in excess of, 20% more weaned calf weight as a result of {{increased}} reproductive performance and maternal ability.

However, the <b>benefits</b> <b>of</b> hybrid vigour in a crossbred cow decline in subsequent generations if progeny are mated to cattle of parentage similar to the cow, and increase if a new breed is introduced. Although studies acknowledge that the major production <b>benefits</b> <b>of</b> hybrid vigour occur in crossbred cow herds, the main use of Limousins outside of Europe continues to be as terminal sires in purebred British breed cow herds.|$|E

5|$|For the {{purposes}} of analysis, {{it is possible to}} separate efficiency (achieving a given objective at lowest cost) and equity (fairness). Economists generally agree that to regulate emissions efficiently, all polluters need to face the full costs of their actions (that is, the full marginal social costs of their actions). Regulation of emissions that is applied only to one economic sector or region drastically reduces the efficiency of efforts to reduce global emissions. There is, however, no scientific consensus over how to share the costs and <b>benefits</b> <b>of</b> reducing future climate change (mitigation of climate change), or the costs and <b>benefits</b> <b>of</b> adapting to any future climate change (see also economics of global warming).|$|E

5|$|An individual's {{belief that}} an {{environmental}} claim lacks honesty {{can have a}} negative effect on attitude toward a brand. If, on the other side, the consumer grants credibility to the claim, the individual will behave more respectfully toward the environment. The problem in extending that credibility to a brand is that consumers interested in ecological products generally are skeptical of commercial advertisements. This skepticism is due to various factors such as lack of language, the absence of scientific knowledge necessary to interpret advertising meaning, and, in particular, the falsehoods and exaggeration of some advertising techniques. To resolve this problem, independent organizations may choose to guarantee messages on the environmental <b>benefits</b> <b>of</b> brands with environmental labeling systems sponsored by independent organizations. This practice tries to diminish perceived biases in environmental information by promoting standardization of the information with the aim of improving confidence in the evaluation of environmental <b>benefits</b> <b>of</b> products—all of which should positively affect the purchase intention.|$|E

50|$|At first, {{in order}} to plead the <b>benefit</b> <b>of</b> clergy, one had {{to appear before the}} court tonsured and {{otherwise}} wearing ecclesiastical dress.

This opened the door to literate lay defendants also claiming the <b>benefit</b> <b>of</b> clergy. In 1351, under Edward III, this loophole was formalised in statute, and the <b>benefit</b> <b>of</b> clergy was officially extended to all who could read. For example, the English dramatist Ben Jonson avoided hanging by pleading <b>benefit</b> <b>of</b> clergy in 1598 when charged with manslaughter.|$|R
