5|$|The {{fossil record}} {{for this group}} appears to be {{restricted}} to a foot bone of an early Miocene bird from Bavaria which {{has been identified as}} an extinct representative of the climbing Certhioidea, a clade comprising the treecreepers, wallcreeper and nuthatches. It has been described as Certhiops rummeli. Two fossil species have been described in the Sitta genus: S. cuvieri Gervais, 1852 and S. senogalliensis Portis, 1888, <b>but</b> <b>probably</b> <b>not</b> belong to nuthatches.|$|E
5|$|Bulls and Bears, a farce {{performed}} at Drury Lane on 2 December 1715, {{was attributed to}} Cibber but was never published. The Dramatic Works of Colley Cibber, Esq.

By Mr. Doggett was attributed to Cibber by William Chetwood in his General History of the Stage (1749), but John Genest in Some Account of the English Stage (1832) thought it was by Thomas Doggett.

5|$|The problem {{posed by}} the ratio is that the {{multiple}} specimens studied, died in the same place, <b>but</b> <b>probably</b> <b>not</b> in a sudden mass-death and so do not represent a single herd or contemporary population. The results may have been distorted by a greater chance for robust animals of getting fossilised or discovered. In an earlier study by Galton in 1982, {{it was suggested that}} individual difference in the sacral rib count of both Kentrosaurus and Dacentrurus might be an indication of dimorphism: females would have had an extra pair of sacral ribs, having also the first sacral vertebra connected to the ilium, in addition to the subsequent four sacrals.|$|E

5|$|Across its Central Asian distribution, the saxaul sparrow {{occurs in}} six {{probably}} disjunct areas, and {{is divided into}} at least three subspecies. The nominate subspecies Passer ammodendri ammodendri inhabits three of these areas, one in the Syr Darya basin of Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, and another {{to the south of}} Lake Balkhash and the north of Almaty, where it is only common in the valley of the Ili River. In a third area, sometimes recognised as a subspecies korejewi, ammodendri birds breed sporadically in parts of central Turkmenistan, Iran, and possibly Afghanistan, migrating to the south during the winter. The subspecies stoliczkae was named after Ferdinand Stoliczka in 1874 by Allan Octavian Hume, from specimens Stoliczka collected in Yarkand. This subspecies is separated from the other two subspecies by the Tian Shan mountains. It is found across a broad swath of China from Kashgar east to the far west of Inner Mongolia, through the areas around the Taklamakan Desert (<b>but</b> <b>probably</b> <b>not</b> in the inhospitable desert itself), and through the east of Xinjiang, northern Gansu, and the fringes of southern Mongolia. In the extreme west of the Gobi Desert a disjunct population separated from the other stoliczkae birds by the Gurvan Saikhan Uul mountains occurs, which is sometimes separated as a subspecies timidus. The subspecies nigricans, described by ornithologist L. S. Stepanyan in 1961, is found in northern Xinjiang's Manasi River valley.|$|E

25|$|Histamine H3 receptors are {{expressed}} in {{the central nervous system}} {{and to a lesser extent}} the peripheral nervous system, where they act as autoreceptors in presynaptic histaminergic neurons, and also control histamine turnover by feedback inhibition of histamine synthesis and release. The H3 receptor has also been shown to presynaptically inhibit the release of a number of other neurotransmitters (i.e. it acts as an inhibitory heteroreceptor) including, <b>but</b> <b>probably</b> <b>not</b> limited to dopamine, GABA, acetylcholine, noradrenaline, histamine and serotonin.|$|E

Comparatively the Nokia 701 uses 128MB for the Broadcom VideoCore IV.|$|E

25|$|Haig then {{returned}} to France (13–15 February) to inspect Fifth Army, which was taking over a section of French line. On the morning of Saturday 16 February {{he met with the}} French Minister of Munitions, and attended a British Army Commanders’ conference at which the apparent imminence of a major German attack in the Third or Fifth Army sectors (<b>but</b> <b>probably</b> <b>not</b> Flanders at this stage, as the ground was still wet there) was discussed. It was still thought that this might be the prelude to greater German attack in Champagne, a view apparently shared by French intelligence. Later that day he travelled back to England by destroyer and special train.|$|E
25|$|In the 7th-8th century, the {{development}} of the local Slavs accelerated. The first Slavic fortified settlements were built in present-day Moravia at least in the last decades of the 7th century. From the end of the 7th century, it is possible to register the rise of a new social elite in Moravia, Slovakia, but also Bohemia - the warrior horsemen. The social organization of the local Slavs continued to grow during the 8th century, which can be documented by further building and development of fortified settlements. In Moravia, they unambiguously concentrate around the river Morava. In Slovakia, the oldest Slavic fortified settlements are documented for the last decades of the 8th century. They are known exclusively from areas which were not under direct Avars influence, <b>but</b> <b>probably</b> <b>not</b> only as a protection against them, because some of them are known also from northern territories (Orava, Spiš) Variation in pottery implies the existence of at least three tribes inhabiting the wider region of the northern Morava river in the early 9th century. Settlement complexes from the period were unearthed, for instance, near modern Bratislava, Brno, and Olomouc. Fortresses erected at Bratislava, Rajhrad, Staré Město and other places around 800 evidence {{the development}} of local centres of power in the same regions.|$|E
25|$|Nationally, {{chapters}} of all fraternities existing {{at the start}} of the new century were wooed into increasingly expansive building projects in the boom years leading up to the Great Depression. The economic downturn became the great leveler; chapters who had extended themselves beyond their means were felled by sharply reduced revenues and growing debt. Within Phi Sig, closely tied as it was to its graduates, alumni were called in to support weakened balance sheets on buildings the undergraduate population alone could no longer afford. In one famous <b>but</b> <b>probably</b> <b>not</b> unique case, chapter advisor Sam Gale went door to door in 1931, successfully seeking alumni backing against the mortgage of Minnesota's newly built Tudor masterpiece. Not only was this impulse acted on at the alumni level: The Fraternity's undergraduate delegates, moved by the plight of their brethren, had fathered a plan at the 1930 Convention that channeled 25 cents each month from each active member (about $10 per month, per man, in 2013 dollars) into a fund to assist chapters stricken by the Depression; the principal of mutual helpfulness could not have been better illustrated. Low manpower, too, had brought about fraternal belt-tightening where possible, while still investing in tactical, significant national services - training in rushing techniques, a pledge manual, better accounting systems and visits by field representatives.|$|E

500|$|In 1991, the Russian {{paleontologist}} Konstantin Mikhailov {{introduced the}} modern parataxonomic system used to classify fossil eggs.

In the same year, the Polish paleontologist Karol Sabath reviewed the entire collection of fossil eggs discovered on the Polish expeditions, including the not-yet-named Gobioolithus eggs. Following Elżanowski, he referred them to Gobipteryx, though only tentatively because at the time ongoing studies of similar eggs found on the Soviet expeditions cast doubt on this classification.|$|E
500|$|In {{the centuries}} {{before the arrival}} of European settlers, the area that became Warren County was on the {{boundary}} between the Miami and Kickapoo tribes. [...] By the late 18thcentury, many Miami had moved further south; most of Indiana north of the Wabash was then occupied by the Potawatomi people. [...] The first non-indigenous settler in the area was probably Zachariah Cicott, a French-Canadian who first traded with the Kickapoo and Potawatomi people around 1802. [...] When General William Henry Harrison took an army from Vincennes to the Battle of Tippecanoe in late 1811, Cicott served as a scout; the trail taken by Harrison's army passed through the area that later became Warren County on its way to and from the battle site in Tippecanoe County. Following the War of 1812, Cicott resumed his trading on the Wabash; the state of Indiana was established in 1816, and Cicott built a log house in 1817 at the location where he later founded the town of Independence. [...] Other settlers came to the area, <b>but</b> <b>probably</b> <b>not</b> until around 1822.|$|E
