500|$|Lazzell {{boarded the}} SS Ivernia on July 3, 1912, bound for Europe {{on a summer}} tour {{arranged}} by the American Travel Club. The tour began in England and continued through the Netherlands, Belgium, and Italy, where Lazzell studied the architecture of churches. In August she left the tour and traveled to Paris, where she stayed at a pension in Montparnasse on the Left Bank. She attended lectures by Florence Heywood and Rossiter Howard, avoided the cafe life, and joined the Students Hostel on Boulevard Saint-Michel. While in Paris, Lazzell took classes at the Académie de la Grande Chaumière, Académie Julian, and Académie Delécluse, eventually settling in at the Académie Moderne where she studied with post-impressionist painter Charles Guérin and David Rosen. Lazzell felt most comfortable at the Moderne, which {{was associated with the}} Parisian avant-garde. She embarked upon a six-week sketching tour of Italy with four other young women in February 1913. The quintet returned to Paris via Germany where Lazzell partook in her first glass of beer in Munich. In April she visited an ear specialist who removed a growth from the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>throat,</b> resulting in what she characterized as [...] "a slight improvement" [...] in her hearing. She continued to study with Guérin, who recognized Lazzell's inclination for landscape art. Lazzell extended her stay in France and attended lectures at the Louvre concerning Flemish paintings, Dutch art and the Italian Renaissance. She returned to the United States at the end of September, sailing from London on the SS Arabic of the White Star Line.|$|E

2500|$|On 16 February 2006 in Nevis, Phillip's wife Shermel {{was found}} dead in the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> car.

[...] On 15 November 2008, a jury in Charlestown found Phillip guilty of murder, and he was due to be sentenced on 22 December 2008, but this was {{deferred}} to 6 February 2009. On 6 February 2009, Phillip was sentenced to life in prison.|$|R
60|$|Philip {{tried to}} swallow the food on his plate, but the muscles of his throat refused to act. He gulped down {{something}} to drink and lit a cigarette. He was trembling in every part. He did not speak. He {{waited for her to}} move, but she sat in silence, staring at the white tablecloth. If they had been alone he would have flung his arms round her and kissed her passionately; he fancied the throwing <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> long white <b>throat</b> as he pressed upon her mouth with his lips. They passed an hour without speaking, and at last Philip thought the waiter began to stare at them curiously. He called for the bill.|$|R

For young girl, they are charming; but, as woman, they are just noting at all. Now, you will see, madame, what I tell you. In a year or two, people shall ask, 'Was she ever handsome?' But you, madame, you come to your prime like great rose! Oh, dere is no comparison of you to Mrs. John Seymour!" ...|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Thornbury had {{received}} a great many letters. She was completely engrossed in them. When she had finished a page she {{handed it to her}} husband, or gave him the sense of what she was reading in a series of short quotations linked together by a sound at the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>throat.</b> [...] "Evie writes that George has gone to Glasgow. 'He finds Mr. Chadbourne so nice to work with, and we hope to spend Christmas together, but I should not like to move Betty and Alfred any great distance (no, quite right), though {{it is difficult to imagine}} cold weather in this heat. [...] . Eleanor and Roger drove over in the new trap. [...] . Eleanor certainly looked more like herself than I've seen her since the winter. She has put Baby on three bottles now, which I'm sure is wise (I'm sure it is too), and so gets better nights. [...] . My hair still falls out. I find it on the pillow! But I am cheered by hearing from Tottie Hall Green. [...] . Muriel is in Torquay enjoying herself greatly at dances. She is going to show her black put after all.' [...] . A line from Herbert--so busy, poor fellow! Ah! Margaret says, 'Poor old Mrs. Fairbank died on the eighth, quite suddenly in the conservatory, only a maid in the house, who hadn't the presence of mind to lift her up, which they think might have saved her, but the doctor says it might have come at any moment, and one can only feel thankful that it was in the house and not in the street (I should think so!). The pigeons have increased terribly, just as the rabbits did five years ago [...] .'" [...] While she read her husband kept nodding his head very slightly, but very steadily in sign of approval.|$|E
5000|$|The song {{has been}} {{received}} with generally positive reviews. Katie Hasty from Hitfix described the song as [...] "warm, percussive but not dancey, {{and a little}} bit more soulful than sultry," [...] and commented on its country-crossover appeal, adding [...] "If there was pedal steel and a twang in the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>throat,</b> this would be a modern country hit." [...] Reviewers at Idol Live repeated the praises and commented on the [...] "indie vibes the got from the song, saying that [...] "her vocals glide seamlessly." [...] They commented especially on the bridge, saying that she [...] "harkens back to her days on 'Idol' with a building, billowing high note that carries through the song’s remainder, and finally settles on a crisp, calm finale." ...|$|E
6000|$|Their {{eyes met}} in the briefest flash of a glance, then both turned their faces aside. Thus averted, one from the other, they made talk. At last she rose, {{gathered}} the books together, and carried them off. At the door she turned. She must steal another keen moment: [...] "Are you admiring my strength?" [...] she asked. Her pose was fine. With her head thrown <b>back,</b> the roundness <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>throat</b> ran finely down to the bosom which swelled above the pile of books held by her straight arms. He looked at her. Their lips smiled curiously. She put back <b>her</b> <b>throat</b> {{as if she were}} drinking. They felt the blood beating madly in their necks. Then, suddenly breaking into a slight trembling, she turned round and left the room.|$|R

5000|$|The {{next morning}} Victoria was {{diagnosed}} with diphtheria; {{at three in the}} morning on 12 November, six-year-old Alix {{was diagnosed with}} the disease. Princess Alice ordered a steam inhaler be brought to her room to prevent the seriously ill Alix from choking to death. Hours later, Princess Marie ran into her mother's room, crawled into bed with her and kissed her. By afternoon, Marie as well was displaying the symptoms of the disease, suffering from a high fever. White spots and a white membrane covered the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>throat.</b> The next day her sister Irene became ill and on the day of 14 November her brother Ernest and father Louis also became ill with diphtheria. Alice and the doctors nursed the family round the clock. On the morning of 16 November, Marie choked to death from the membrane covering her throat. Her mother, awakened by the doctors, hurried to the nursery, only to find her daughter dead. Alice sat by her daughter's body, kissing Marie's face and hands, trying to work up the strength to tell her ill husband. She watched as Marie's coffin was wheeled off to the family mausoleum.|$|E

We present {{a case of a}} potentially difficult airway emergency in a pediatric patient. After presentation, we briefly review critical differences between pediatric and adult airways and management of the airway during these emergencies. 1. Case Presentation A 4 -year-old girl was brought to the Emergency Department (ED) by her parents with an impaled foreign object in her mouth. The parents stated that she was running with a wire hanger in hermouth when she subsequently tripped, fell, and had the hanger lodge into the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>throat.</b> Her mother noted she had no significant medical history, and the event had occurred less than 20 minutes prior to arrival to the ED.

40|$|An omega-shaped {{epiglottis}} {{is frequently}} associated with laryngomalacia. However, an elongated high-rising epiglottis can represent a normal {{variation of the}} larynx in a majority of pediatric patients. It {{is important to consider}} this in a healthy child with no complaints apart from the sensation of a foreign body in throat. This will avoid triggering any unnecessary investigation or treatment. An elongated epi-glottis projecting in the oropharynx can appear as a foreign body and be a source of anxiety for the par-ents as well as the unaware family practitioner. We present such a case, with a brief discussion of the pediatric larynx and the omega-shaped epiglottis. (J Am Board Fam Med 2007; 20 : 495 – 496.) A 3 -year-old girl was brought by her mother to the otolaryngology rapid access clinic. The girl had been complaining of an intermittent foreign body sensation in her throat. Her mother and the patient herself described a “googly ” in the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>throat</b> when she popped her tongue out. There was no associated history of stridor, shortness of breath, or symptoms suggestive of a sleep apnea. There wa...|$|E

60|$|The {{sun came}} {{out after a}} little, and covered the earth with a glory that {{found its way into}} the girl's heart. She ceased to sob, and the ache passed out <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>throat,</b> {{although}} the shadow still hung in her eyes.|$|R
