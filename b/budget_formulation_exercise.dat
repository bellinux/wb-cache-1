40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to analyse, in terms of presence, {{determinants}} and purposes, the misrepresentation of expected revenues during <b>budget</b> <b>formulation</b> and the misrepresentation of actual revenues during budget execution. To this end, we use six- year panel data from Italian municipalities with populations above 15, 000. Our results suggest that overestimations of current revenues are more frequent than underestimations, during both <b>budget</b> <b>formulation</b> and <b>budget</b> execution. In terms of determinants, our results highlight the impact on revenue misrepresentation of both political orientation and fiscal stress. Finally, in terms of purposes, we show that revenue underestimation during <b>budget</b> <b>formulation</b> and revenue overestimation during budget execution may contribute to the formation of surpluses. The former, in particular, may allow mayors to create a ‘war chest’ in non-election years, which can then be used to increase net borrowing on the eve of elections...|$|R

This includes information that VA develops for its budget submission to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), but it does not include information on subsequent interactions that occur between VA and OMB. We will do additional work to incorporate information from OMB and complete our analysis in a report to be issued at a later date. Congress requested information on VA's <b>budget</b> <b>formulation</b> process because of its interest in ensuring that VA's budget forecasts are accurate and based on valid patient estimates. In response to the request for information on VA's internal <b>budget</b> <b>formulation</b> process, this report provides the following for fiscal years 2005 and 2006 : (1) a description of VA's process for developing its budget submission to OMB for its medical programs, and the role of VA's actuarial model; (2) a description of the medical program activities cited by VA as needing additional funding, and how VA identified these activities; and (3) key factors in VA's <b>budget</b> <b>formulation</b> process that contributed to the requests for additional funding. ...|$|R

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedA budget {{is a plan}} of action stated in monetary terms. It identifies how, why, and with what one will accomplish a mission. This thesis studies the <b>budget</b> <b>formulation</b> process in the Fleet Marine Force (FMF). Specifically, this thesis studies the process in Continental United States and Hawaii based FMF units at the division, wing, and force service support group level. The <b>budget</b> <b>formulation</b> process for these units is examined in view of Navy/Marine Corps budget direc­tives and "preferred" budget practices for public organizations as discussed in published professional literature. The results {{of this study indicate that}} FMF budget organizations adhere to the majority of established budget practices. This study does, however, indicate several areas where improvement could be made such as developing more effective budget training programs, being more cognizant of the impact that timing has on budget quality, and reducing the personnel turnover problem caused by frequent rotation of budget personnel in FMF organizations. Further, this study proposes recommendations concerning the improvement of the <b>budget</b> <b>formulation</b> process in these and other areas. [URL] United States Marine Corp...|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis thesis {{is a case}} study analysis of the Resource Management Office of the Bureau of Naval Personnel (PERS- 02). Specifically, an analysis of projected versus actual budget figures was conducted. The purpose of the research was to explain anomalies in the <b>budget</b> <b>formulation</b> figures as compared to actual budget execution figures and define {{ways to improve the}} protocol between budget activities. Based on model comparisons, document reviews, and semi-structured interviews of PERS- 02 leaders and managers, there were indications that PERS- 02 had been severely stressed due to personnel reductions, a partial relocation to Millington, TN, and less than anticipated time savings from information technology management changes. Recommendations are offered to assist leaders and managers in making systematic changes to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of PERS- 02 with the goal of increasing accuracy during <b>budget</b> <b>formulation.</b> Specific recommendations include: creation of realistic training programs tailored to enhance individual knowledge and skill sets, increased use of automated data systems geared to <b>budget</b> <b>formulation</b> and execution such as budget Builder and FASTDATA, and work schedule changes using shifts for both days and evenings.

As noted in previous updates {{of the fiscal}} ROSC, much {{progress has been made}} in Greece since joining the European Union in separating government from nongovernment functions, and more tightly delineating the boundaries between the government and the rest of the public sector.

40|$|We {{study the}} effect of tariffs in a one-sector small open economy that imports oil. We find that (1) the model may exhibit local {{indeterminacy}} and sunspots when tariff rates are endogenously determined by a balanced-budget rule with a constant level of government expenditures (or lump-sum tansfers); and (2) indeterminacy disappears if the government finances endogenous public spending and transfers with fixed tariff rates. Under the first type of balanced <b>budget</b> <b>formulation,</b> we provide numerical (calibration) examples to illustate that the government shouldn't distort the oil price paid by firms with tariffs {{in order to avoid}} aggregate instability. Under the second type of balanced <b>budget</b> <b>formulation,</b> we prove that the economy exhibits equilibrium uniqueness, regardless of the existence of lump-sum transfers. ...|$|R

40|$|In Zimbabwe, the Government {{has been}} {{experiencing}} problems with <b>budget</b> <b>formulation</b> {{and control of}} expenditures by Ministries and departments. Through {{the adoption of a}} three-year-rolling budget in 1995, ministries were forced to forecast, focus and justify their requirements hence better planning. Despite this forward planning approach, budget execution problems have persisted as evidenced by over-expenditures, fraudulent activities and other related problems leading to centralize expenditure control at the Central Payments Office (CPO). The persistence of the problems led to the introduction of a Public Finance Management System (PFMS) starting in 2001.

It describes important <b>budget</b> <b>formulation</b> and execution processes, statutes and organizations and their functions.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} interference and timeliness in the revenue-forecasting process, {{using new}} data on revenue-forecasting practices in low-income countries. Interference {{is defined as}} the occurrence of a significant deviation from purely technical forecasts. A theoretical model explains forecasting interference through government corruption. The data broadly supports the model, and the results are robust to alternative explanations. The paper also constructs three indices-transparency, formality, and organizational simplicity-that characterize revenue-forecasting practices, and assesses their effectiveness in producing an upfront-that is, timely-budget envelope. More transparent and simple forecasting processes lead to early budget constraints, while formality has no measurable effect.
