He continued as a regular in the limited-overs side throughout 2016 and 2017, playing again for England in the 2017 ICC Champions Trophy, {{but was unable to}} <b>break</b> <b>back</b> into the Test side and was not selected for the 2017–18 Ashes series in Australia.|$|E

He scored for the team in the following match with a six-yard shot from a Craig Farrell pass, which finished as a 3–3 draw with Stevenage Borough. He suffered from a hip injury, which resulted him in missing York's 3–1 defeat against Wrexham. His final match for York was a 2–0 victory against Rushden & Diamonds and he finished the loan spell with five appearances and one goal, before returning to Rotherham on 18 October 2008 after being recalled by the club. Weeks after returning to Rotherham, {{it was suggested that}} Holmes might be loaned out again after failing to <b>break</b> <b>back</b> into the team. It was over a month before Holmes eventually made his first appearance for Rotherham since returning, after starting in the 2–0 defeat at home to Bradford City on 21 November 2008.|$|E

5|$|By this time, Agesilaus's army, after {{brushing}} off {{attacks from}} the Thessalians during its march through that country, {{had arrived in}} Boeotia, where it was met by an army gathered from the various states of the anti-Spartan alliance. Agesilaus's force from Asia, composed largely of emancipated helots and mercenary veterans of the Ten Thousand, was augmented by half a Spartan regiment from Orchomenus, and another half a regiment that had been transported across the Gulf of Corinth. These armies met each other at Coronea, in Theban territory; as at Nemea, both right wings were victorious, with the Thebans breaking through {{while the rest of}} the allies were defeated. Seeing that the rest of their force had been defeated, the Thebans formed up to <b>break</b> <b>back</b> through to their camp. Agesilaus met their force head on, and in the struggle that followed a number of Thebans were killed before the remainder were able to force their way through and rejoin their allies. After this victory, Agesilaus sailed with his army across the Gulf of Corinth and returned to Sparta.|$|E
5|$|When Dean Solomon {{suffered}} a season-ending knee injury in late March, Hall {{was one of}} three players in contention to be promoted to the senior list in place of Solomon. After approximately one month of assessment Hall was deemed the most impressive of Essendon's three rookies and was elevated to the senior list. In early June, Hall played particularly well in defence for the reserves against the Murray Kangaroos, and was subsequently in consideration to play for Essendon's senior team. Essendon had been plagued by injury throughout 2002 and this, coupled with Hall's good form in the VFL, resulted in him making his AFL debut in round 12 against Hawthorn. After a poor performance in his debut match, in which he did not record a statistic and spent most of the match on the bench, Hall was dropped backed to the VFL side the following round. Despite showing good form in the VFL for the remainder of 2002, Hall was unable to <b>break</b> <b>back</b> into the senior Bombers line-up. Although Hall failed to have an impact at AFL level, he played well at VFL level and was third in the reserves' best and fairest award.|$|E

25|$|In {{contrast}} to Richardson's consistency and strenuous work, Lockwood was never capable of long bowling spells. He bowled off a much shorter run than Richardson {{and tended to}} come down very heavily in his delivery stride. Lockwood could <b>break</b> <b>back,</b> though rarely as sharply as Richardson, but what really set Lockwood apart was his unpredictability, with extremely subtle variations of pace and pitch characterising his bowling. Frequently Lockwood would deliver a slow ball without change of action and the batsman would claim they never expected it.|$|E
25|$|Other historians {{claim that}} Custer never {{approached}} the river, but rather continued north across the coulee {{and up the}} other side, where he gradually came under attack. According to this theory, by the time Custer realized he was badly outnumbered, {{it was too late}} to <b>break</b> <b>back</b> to the south where Reno and Benteen could have provided assistance. Two men from the 7th Cavalry, the young Crow scout Ashishishe (known in English as Curley) and the trooper Peter Thompson, claimed to have seen Custer engage the Indians. The accuracy of their recollections remains controversial; accounts by battle participants and assessments by historians almost universally discredit Thompson's claim.|$|E

25|$|The final of {{the mixed}} doubles {{took place between}} first seeds Slovene Katarina Srebotnik & Serbian Nenad Zimonjić, and third seeds Victoria Azarenka, from Belarus & Bob Bryan, from the USA. After easily winning the first set 6–2 in only twenty-two minutes, Azarenka & Bryan saw their adversaries even the competition, as Srebotnik & Zimonjic held their serve to a second set tie-break, in which they even took the early advantage, leading 4–3. Azarenka & Bryan were able to <b>break</b> <b>back,</b> and win four points in a row to {{eventually}} claim victory on the score of 6–2, 7–6(5), {{in little more than}} an hour. Victoria Azarenka, already the 2007 US Open mixed doubles champion, and the 2007 Australian Open mixed doubles runner-up, & Bob Bryan, finalist of the mixed doubles competition in Wimbledon 2006, and winner at the US Open in 2003, 2004, and 2006, won their first Grand Slam title together, becoming the new Roland-Garros mixed doubles champions.|$|E
25|$|The third {{match of}} the Red Group, in the singles event, was {{a repeat of}} the Madrid Masters final which Andy Murray had won over Gilles Simon in {{straight}} sets less than a month earlier. The World No. 4 made the strongest start of the match, quickly racing to a 4–0 lead. The Frenchman then fought back to 4–3, but failed to break Murray a second time, letting the Scot use his advantage to win the set 6–4. The second set was a formality for Murray, who saved all three break points he had against him, and took Simon's serve twice to record his second round robin win, 6–4, 6–2, after one-hour-and-a-half of play. The unexpected line up of the second match of the day opposed top Roger Federer to Roddick's replacement, ninth-seeded Radek Štěpánek, for the fourth time in the year, after a Rome quarterfinal (won by Štěpánek), a US Open third round (won by Federer), and a Madrid second round (won by Federer). The Swiss broke in the opening game of the match, and led 2–1 when Štěpánek broke back to 2–2. Both players held their serve to a tie-break Federer eventually took 7–4, capitalizing on Štěpánek's unforced errors. Federer and Štěpánek continued to serve strongly in the second set, before the Swiss took the advantage at 4–3, to lead 5–3 and serve for the set. Štěpánek managed to <b>break</b> <b>back</b> one last time, but Federer took the Czech's serve again to close the match 7–6, 6–4, in less than two hours, already crushing Štěpánek's slim chances to leave the round robin, and allowing Murray to secure a semifinal berth.|$|E
