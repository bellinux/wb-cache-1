25|$|The land {{upon which}} the city was built, as well {{as much of the}} {{surrounding}} area, was obtained by Englishman Thomas Fenwick from the Native Americans. In 1869, businessman Isaac Coffin built the first beach-front cottage to receive paying guests. During those days, people arrived by stage coach and ferry. They came to fish off the shore, to enjoy the natural beauty of the Atlantic Ocean pounding against the long strip of sandy beach, to collect seashells, or just to sit <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>watch</b> the rolling surf.|$|E

500|$|... "The End of All Things" [...] began a four-week {{break for}} the series, though the {{producers}} initially thought this gap would commence with the following episode. They were pleased that the switch did not cause issues, with Pinkner noting that [...] "we’re sort of in a zone of episodes where each one is amazing and each one either turns the story or resolves something important or there’s a cliffhanger– several episodes where each one is pretty awesome in itself and {{is also important to}} the overall patchwork of the season. We were very happy this ended up being one before we went on a little break. I think the fans are going to be well satisfied to come <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>watch</b> the next one as well." ...|$|E

500|$|During the {{non-stop}} {{protests in}} Ottawa, Lawrence Cannon requested the Government of Sri Lanka {{for an immediate}} ceasefire. He also rejected calls from the High Commissioner of Sri Lanka in Canada to stop all protests in Ottawa. Cannon condemned the LTTE for preventing civilians from leaving areas being attacked and using them as human shields. Bev Oda and the Conservative Party of Canada both condemned the use of LTTE flags, insisting that they symbolize connection with a terrorist organization. David Miller and Ontario Premier Dalton McGuinty also condemned the Gardiner Expressway blockade. Liberal Party of Canada leader Michael Ignatieff had made statements on the protests in a few occasions. Ignatieff urged the Harper government to break its silence and take initiative in condemning the violence. He stated {{that there are no}} military solutions to the conflict and that the war must stop under a worldwide initiative and internationally coordinated diplomatic strategy. On 21 April, Ignatieff met with a few Tamil leaders in Ottawa to discuss the humanitarian crisis. On the occasion, he said the following: [...] "I am deeply concerned about escalating violence in Sri Lanka, and the resulting deaths of thousands of civilians. It was important for me to hear from Tamil Canadians, whose family and friends in Sri Lanka are suffering first hand from this crisis. We cannot sit <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>watch</b> as thousands of innocent lives are lost in the cross-fire, and we condemn any attempt to use civilians as human shields." ...|$|E
500|$|Landing near Constantinople, Calafia {{meets with}} other Moslem warrior leaders who {{were unable to}} remove King Amadis and his Christian allies from the city, and she tells them all to hold <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>watch</b> her manner of combat—she says they will be amazed. The next morning, she and her women warriors mount their [...] "fierce beasts" [...] wearing gold armor [...] "adorned with the most {{precious}} stones", advancing to invest the city. Calafia orders the griffins forward and they, hungry from the long sea voyage, fly out and maul the city's defenders. Sating their hunger, the griffins continue to snatch Christian men in their claws and carry them high in air only to drop them to their deaths. The city's defenders cower and hide from the griffins. Seeing this, Calafia passes word to her Moslem allies that {{they are free to}} advance and take the city. The griffins, however, cannot tell Moslem from Christian; they can only tell man from woman. The griffins begin snatching Moslem soldiers and carrying them aloft, dropping and killing them. Calafia questions her pagan faith, saying, [...] "O ye idols in whom I believe and worship, what is this which has happened as favorably to my enemies as to my friends?" [...] She orders her woman warriors to take the city's battlements and they fight well, taking many injuries from arrows and quarrels piercing the soft gold metal of their armor. Calafia orders her allies forward to assist the Californians in battle, but the griffins pounce again, killing Moslem men. She directs the griffin trainers to call them off, and the griffins return to roost in the ships.|$|E
500|$|... "Rock Show", {{the first}} season finale of Parks and Recreation was written by Norm Hiscock and {{directed}} by series co-founder Michael Schur. Schur said he felt [...] "Rock Show" [...] marked a change in tone for the series and struck a better balance between personal and professional stories {{than any of the}} other episodes from the season. Schur said: [...] "We treated that whole six-episode season like a pilot. If you go <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>watch</b> those episodes now, you can see us making changes. The sixth episode is different in tone than the first. And we made some character tweaks, like every show ever does". Amy Poehler said she believed [...] "Rock Show" [...] would end what she described as the inevitable comparisons between Parks and Recreation and The Office, which is also produced by Parks creators Schur and Greg Daniels. Poehler said, [...] "I think it was something we had to work through in the beginning, and I’m kind of hoping we’re on the other side of that and people will start to judge the show on its own, for what it is and realize it’s just a completely different world in a similar style.” Schur made his directorial debut with [...] "Rock Show", and had only one day of preparation before directing the episode. While preparing to direct the episode, Schur was asked to make an appearance on The Office as Mose Schrute, the cousin of Dwight Schrute and a popular minor character, in the fifth season finale episode, [...] "Company Picnic". Schur regretfully declined because he needed the time to work on [...] "Rock Show", leading Office episode writers Paul Lieberstein and Jennifer Celotta to create the character Rolf, Dwight's friend played by James Urbaniak, as an alternative.|$|E

O'Brien chronicles Trump's rise, fall and rise again from both public favor and the Forbes rich list, and deftly balances irreverence and respect for his subject. [...] O'Brien's reportorial style, peppered with wit and irony, is the perfect base to Trump's acidic persona; he is the straight man to this contemporary P.T. Barnum." ...|$|E
2500|$|Kahane {{proposed}} an [...] "exchange of populations" [...] that would continue the Jewish exodus from Arab lands: [...] "A total of some 750,000 Jews fled Arab lands since 1948. Surely {{it is time}} for Jews, worried over the huge growth of Arabs in Israel, to consider finishing the exchange of populations that began 35 years ago." [...] Kahane proposed a $40,000 compensation plan for Arabs who would leave voluntarily, and forcible expulsion for those who [...] "don't want to leave", and he encouraged retaliatory violence against Arabs who attacked Jews: [...] "I approve of anybody who commits such acts of violence. Really, I don't think that we can sit <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>watch</b> Arabs throwing rocks at buses whenever they feel like it. They must understand that a bomb thrown at a Jewish bus is going to mean a bomb thrown at an Arab bus." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to University of North Carolina Professor Zeynep Tufekci, {{this is part}} of {{a pattern}} of behaviour. After the 2016 Turkish coup d'état attempt, Wikileaks {{announced}} that it would release e-mails belonging to Turkey’s ruling Justice and Development Party. When these e-mails were released, however, it [...] "was nothing but mundane mailing lists of tens of thousands of ordinary people who discussed politics online. Back then, too, the ruse worked: Many Western journalists had hyped these non-leaks." [...] According to Tufekci, there are three steps to Wikileaks' [...] "disinformation campaigns": [...] "The first step is to dump many documents at once — rather than allowing journalists to scrutinise them and absorb their significance before publication. The second step is to sensationalise the material with misleading news releases and tweets. The third step is to sit <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>watch</b> as the news media unwittingly promotes the WikiLeaks agenda under the auspices of independent reporting." ...|$|E

2500|$|Gwen Ihnat of The A.V. Club {{gave the}} episode {{positive}} review, {{giving it a}} B-. While she liked the episode, she left some reservations: [...] "Ultimately, depending on what you want from your Once, “Dreamcatcher” {{was a bit of}} a let down. It moved the plot along, but at a feverish pace and with built in leaps in faith and storyline that just haven’t been explained enough. (How, for instance, did Emma learn that she could capture memories in dreamcatchers? [...] And why is that the craft she chose now that she doesn’t need to sleep?) Maybe all those assumptions and conclusions will be eventually explained in one of those “ohhhhh, I get it now” summations a couple of episodes down the road, but maybe not. Once’s writers and creators have a tendency to play fast and loose with their storylines, knowing their audience will just kind of accept it and move on. Thus, these kinds of leaps aren’t really out of the question for them. (You can’t blame them, really. We’re already watching a show about fairy tales, for crying out loud.) But I didn’t really get “Dreamcatcher.” I’m not sure that I’m supposed to yet, and down the road I might change my mind and say, “you know, that was the episode I need to go <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>watch</b> now that I know what I know.” But for now, it just left me a little cold.
