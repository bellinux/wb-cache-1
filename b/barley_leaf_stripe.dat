In the poster different measures and agents to control both diseases are investigated and discussed. Our research reveals that <b>barley</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>stripe</b> {{as well as}} net blotch can be sufficiently controlled in organic farming by physical methods (warm water and hot air treatment) or by the alcoholic plant strengtheners Lebermooser and - less effectively - by Milsana®. The plant protection product Cedomon® was not always sufficiently effective to control <b>barley</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>stripe</b> and net blotch.

40|$|Journal {{compilation}} © 2008 Blackwell Publishing LtdBarley (Hordeum vulgare L.) <b>leaf</b> <b>stripe</b> {{is caused}} by the seed-borne fungus Pyrenophora graminea. We investigated microscopically and molecularly the reaction of <b>barley</b> embryos to <b>leaf</b> <b>stripe</b> inoculation. In the resistant genotype NIL 3876 -Rdg 2 a, fungal growth ceased at the scutellar node of the embryo, while in the susceptible near-isogenic line (NIL) Mirco-rdg 2 a fungal growth continued past the scutellar node and into the embryo. Pathogen-challenged embryos of resistant and susceptible NILs showed different levels of UV autofluorescence and toluidine blue staining, indicating differential accumulation of phenolic compounds. Suppression subtractive hybridization and cDNA amplified fragment-length polymorphism (AFLP) analyses of embryos identified P. graminea-induced and P. graminea-repressed barley genes. In addition, cDNA-AFLP analysis identified six pathogenicity-associated fungal genes expressed during barley infection but at low to undetectable levels during growth on artificial media. Microarrays representing the entire set of differentially expressed cDNA-AFLP fragments and 100 barley homologues of previously described defence-related genes were used to study gene expression changes at 7 and 14 days after inoculation in the resistant and susceptible NILs. A total of 171 significantly modulated barley genes were identified and assigned to four groups based on timing and genotype dependence of expression. Analysis of the changes in gene expression during the barley resistance response to <b>leaf</b> <b>stripe</b> suggests that the Rdg 2 a-mediated response includes cell-wall reinforcement, signal transduction, generation of reactive oxygen species, cell protection, jasmonate signalling and expression of plant effector genes.

40|$|Pyrenophora graminea Ito and Kuribayashi (anamorph Drechslera graminea) is a seed-borne {{pathogen}} causing <b>barley</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>stripe.</b> The {{disease is}} widely distributed in most barley growing areas, where it causes serious damage and yield losses. At present disease control is focused {{mainly on the}} application of fungicides, but the risk of naturally occurring resistance within the pathogen populations and the increasing legal limitations {{to the use of}} fungicides requires the development of new strategies for disease control. To this aim we are currently applying breeding procedures and studying the molecular bases of P. graminea-barley interaction. The interaction P. graminea-barley provides a good model for understanding the molecular basis of diseases caused by seed-borne pathogens. The expression of defence-related genes occurs in barley tissues inoculated with P. graminea, a response that is regulated by several factors depending on both the fungal isolate and the barley cultivar. The induction of these genes was monitored in barley cultivars inoculated with two highly virulent isolates of the pathogen Dg 2 and Dg 5 (also called I 2 and I 5 in previous papers) and in barley tissues infected with a hypovirulent mutant of the isolate Dg 2. In the former, it was found that plants challenged by the isolates Dg 2 and Dg 5 responded with the induction of genes coding for peroxidases, thionins and thaumatin-like proteins. A single genetic factor controlling complete resistance to P. graminea, derived from Hordeum laevigatum via cv "Vada", has been introduced into most resistant North-European two-rowed spring barley cvs. This "Vada resistance" was probably introgressed into the barley genome along with the MlLa (Laevigatum) powdery mildew resistance, because the two factors {{have been found to be}} linked; this resistance, named as Rdg 1 a, has been mapped on the long arm of barley chromosome 2. It is also known that cvs quantitatively resistant to leaf stripe are widespread in Europe. A major QTL conferring resistance to <b>barley</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>stripe</b> was identified in the cv "Proctor" by means of QTL analysis; this QTL accounted for 58. 5 % of the variation in the trait and was mapped on the centromeric region of barley chromosome 1. The cv "Thibaut" was identified as highly resistant to the most virulent Italian isolate, isolate Dg 2. We have described the characterization of the genetic basis of the cv "Thibaut" resistance, the mapping of the locus harbouring this resistance gene and the development of PCR-based molecular markers associated with the resistance, and useful for marker-assisted selection. Near-isogenic lines (NILs) carrying resistance of the cv "Thibaut" against the highly virulent isolate Dg 2 were obtained by introgressing the resistance into the genetic background of the susceptible cv "Mirco". The "Thibaut resistance gene" was mapped and called Rdg 2 a. A PCR-based marker (MWG 2018) associated with the resistance gene has been developed to assess the leaf stripe resistant phenotype in barley breeding programs. Several resistant genotypes were identified and among them four were shown to possess the same allele of the cultivar Thibaut at the marker locus. One of them, the cultivar Rebelle, is being used as a source of leaf stripe resistance in winter barley breeding programs. In several resistant lines obtained from five crosses, in which Rebelle acted directly or indirectly as donor of the resistance, the allelic composition at the MWG 2018 locus was verified. The results showed that the resistant phenotype of the lines was always associated with the resistance allele of the molecular marker, thereby demonstrating its reliability for selecting the leaf stripe resistance...|$|E
40|$|Pyrenophora teres (anamorph: Drechslera teres), {{the causal}} agent of net blotch of barley, {{has been shown}} to produce toxins {{involved}} in pathogenicity. The objective of {{the first part of this}} study was to develop an in vitro screening procedure using concentrated culture filtrates of the pathogen to screen immature embryo-derived callus from resistant and susceptible barley genotypes. Three resistant (Fr 926 - 77, Kao 32 - 12, Kao 22 - 3) and three susceptible (TR 306, AC Oxbow and Deuce) genotypes were used for in vitro culture and Kao 22 - 3 and TR 306 were identified as potential culture-responsive parental combinations. However, the in vitro screening could not be carried out due to the inability to detect the toxins in culture filtrates by chromatographic separations or to delineate resistant and susceptible genotypes based on bioassays with excised leaves. In the second part of this study, molecular techniques were used to study the pathogen. Two forms of the net blotch pathogen have previously been identified. One form (Pyrenophora teres f. maculata) causes spot-type lesions and the other form (Pyrenophora teres f. teres) causes net-type lesions. These two forms are morphologically identical and differ only in the symptoms induced on barley. The RAPD methodology was used to distinguish between the spot and net forms and a closely related species, Pyrenophora graminea, which causes <b>barley</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>stripe.</b> Cochliobolus sativus, which causes spot blotch of barley, and Pyrenophora tritici-repentis, which causes tan spot of wheat, were included as outgroups. One hundred 10 -mer primers were used for RAPD analysis and after agarose gel electrophoresis, the bands were scored as present or absent. Results were compiled in a binary matrix and cluster analysis performed. The net forms and the spot forms clustered close to each other with about 80 % similarity. P. graminea clustered close to the net blotch cluster with about 10 - 25 % similarity, followed by P. tritici-repentis. It was also found that the algorithm employed for cluster analysis affected the topology of the dendrograms in one investigation. However, upon deriving a consensus tree from all the dendrograms, the tree reverted back to the original topology. PCR primers were also designed based on the terminal sequences of a RAPD band unique to the net form. An approach, termed Pooled Isolates for Taxon Differentiation using RAPD (PITD-RAPD), was used to analyze pooled DNA from isolates of the net form, the spot form and P. graminea. The polymorphisms detected were similar to those generated when RAPD analysis was performed on individual DNA samples. This approach might be useful for the efficient development of taxon-specific probes or primers. The internal transcribed spacer (ITS) of the rRNA unit of the three pathogens was PCR amplified using universal primers. No size variation was observed. Amplification of the intergenic spacer region between two rRNA units was also attempted. Size variation was observed, but was not characteristic of any species or sub-species...|$|E
40|$|<b>Barley</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>stripe,</b> {{caused by}} the seed-transmitted hemi-biotrophic fungus Pyrenophora graminea, is a barley disease {{particularly}} acute in Nordic countries, during spring sowing, and in the Mediterranean’s winter barley districts where causes severe yield losses. To date, only two P. graminea race-specific resistance genes are known: Rdg 1 a, identified in cultivar Vada, and Rdg 2 a, identified in cv. Thibaut. Rdg 2 a confers immunity to at least three different P. graminea monoconidian isolates, including the most widespread and virulent Italian isolate Dg 2, but it is overcome by Dg 5. The aim of the present work was to isolate this gene, characterize the Rdg 2 a locus and its evolution and mine the bases of Rdg 2 a-mediated resistance. In a previous analysis the map-based cloning and the sequencing of the Rdg 2 a locus were carried out. Three homolog R genes encoding CC-NB-LRR proteins, that represent the majior class of resistance proteins, were identified at the locus and were named as Nbs 1 -Rdg 2 a, Nbs 2 -Rdg 2 a and Nbs 3 -Rdg 2 a (Bulgarelli et al., 2010). To determine which of the three genes is the Rdg 2 a gene, we started the research investigating their structure. RACE analyses showed that for the third candidate (Nbs 3 -Rdg 2 a) alternative splicing processes determine the synthesis of severly truncated and probably non-functional proteins. This allowed us to excluded Nbs 3 - Rdg 2 a from acting in resistance to isolate Dg 2. By means RT-PCRs {{on a pair of}} Near Isogenic Lines (NIL) that differ only for alleles at the Rdg 2 a locus (susceptible cv. Mirco and its resistant NIL, NIL 3876), we demonstrated that both Nbs 1 -Rdg 2 a and Nbs 2 -Rdg 2 a are transcribed in embryos (where the resistance takes place) and leaf tissues of the resistant line, but they are not expressed in the susceptible nearisogenic phenotype. Sequencing of the Mirco alleles revealed rearrangements in the putative promoter regions: two insertions, one next to a putative TATA-box element and the other, carrying terminal inverted repeats, in the 5 ’ UTR, for Nbs 1 -rdg 2 a, and a deletion just at the level of a MITE-like element, present in Thibaut Nbs 2 -Rdg 2 a, for Nbs 2 -rdg 2 a. It is likely that these changes represent the cause of the lacking of expression of these genes in the susceptible genotype. Moreover, qRT-PCRs showed that Nbs 1 -Rdg 2 a transcription was un-responsive to P. graminea infection, while Nbs 2 -Rdg 2 a transcripts increased during the first stages of infection. However, Nbs 2 -Rdg 2 a mRNA abundance was significantly lower than that of Nbs 1 -Rdg 2 a. To define which gene is the Rdg 2 a gene, a complementation assay was conducted. Susceptible cv. Golden Promise was transformed by agoinfiltration with each gene independently, under the control of its native promoter. Interestingly, the rescue of Dg 2 -resistance was observed only when plants were transformed with Nbs 1 -Rdg 2 a (90 - 100 % of resistance), suggesting that this gene is Rdg 2 a. Comparing the sequences of the three genes at the Rdg 2 a locus, we found that similarly to other R genes, Rdg 2 a underwent to diversifying selection, according to a model in which resistance genes co-evolves with pathogen effector(s) gene(s). The fact that the Rdg 2 a locus contains a gene cluster of highly similar sequences has most likely contributed to significative rearrangements during evolution, probably derived from unequal crossovers resulting in sequence exchange between paralogs and, possibly, in the generation of recombinant genes, as well as to expansion/contraction of gene copy number. Regarding this last case, we have also characterized the rdg 2 a locus of the susceptible cv. Morex. Morex rdg 2 a locus carries two deletions and the rdg 2 a allele might derived from an un-equal crossingover between Rdg 2 a and Nbs 2 -Rdg 2 a ancestors that led to a reduction of the number of the gene family members. Most resistance proteins function through inducing a Programmed Cell Death (PCD) that lead to a Hypersensitive Response (HR) {{at the level of the}} infected cells. Histological analyses using the TUNEL method did not reveal any significative difference in PCD between infected embryos of resistant and susceptible varieties and the number of cells undergoing PCD was transcurable. These finding let us to conclude that the Rdg 2 a-mediated resistance does not involve HR but it is most likely based on the strengthening of physical and chemical barriers in the cell walls and intercellular spaces of the embryo tissues. In conclusion, we identified, cloned and characterized the first resistance gene active against a seed-borne disease; importantly, the gene belongs to the poorly represented class of R genes which does not trigger a hypersensitive responce...|$|E

40|$|Barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) is a {{well-known}} cereal plant. Young <b>barley</b> <b>leaf</b> is consumed as a popular green-colored drink, which is named “Aojiru” in Japan. We {{examined the effects of}} <b>barley</b> <b>leaf</b> powder (BLP) and insoluble fibers derived from BLP on postprandial blood glucose in rats and healthy Japanese volunteers. BLP and insoluble fibers derived from BLP suppressed the increment of postprandial blood glucose levels in rats (), and increased the viscosity of their digesta. The insoluble fibers present in BLP might play a role in controlling blood glucose level by increasing digesta viscosity. In human, BLP suppressed the increment of postprandial blood glucose level only in those which exhibited higher blood glucose levels after meals (). BLP might suppress the increment of postprandial blood glucose level by increasing digesta viscosity in both of rats and humans who require blood glucose monitoring...|$|R

40|$|The soil-borne barley {{yellow mosaic}} virus (BaYMV), the aphid-borne {{barley yellow dwarf virus}} (BYDV) and the seed-borne fungus Pyrenophora graminea (<b>leaf</b> <b>stripe)</b> {{are the most}} serious {{diseases}} for the barley crop in Southern Europe environments, where mildew and other foliar diseases have a relatively small or not significant effect on yields. The development of barley cultivars resistant to the three diseases is thus an urgent objective of barley breeding for the area, in a context of increasing organic farming for cereals. Nevertheless, breeding for multiple diseases encounters several economical and technical problems, and cultivars resistant to the former diseases are not yet available. The bottlenecks of barley breeding for resistance to BYDV are the availability of sources of resistance, mainly based on semi-dominant Yd 2 gene, and the labour-intensive inoculation test made with infected aphids. Availability of resistant germplasm and inoculation test are easier for BaYMV and, in relative terms, also for <b>leaf</b> <b>stripe</b> resistance. In this view, two schemes of marker-assisted selection (MAS) have been followed to develop high yielding advanced lines: an assisted pedigree by introducing the two virus resistances, and a "gene pyramiding" scheme to introduce four loci of resistance - two to <b>leaf</b> <b>stripe,</b> and one each to BYDV and BaYMV. STS and SSR markers have been selected for the aim and applied to segregating progenies together with phenotypic selection for agronomic traits. Results of the two MAS processes are here presented, including yield performances of the advanced breeding lines...|$|R

The influence of this protein on translation in planta has been analysed by using barley plants and tobacco plants transformed with a barley cDNA encoding JIP 60. In both plant systems JIP 60 exhibited N-glycosidase activity in vivo. The depurination of the 25 S rRNA of tobacco and barley ribosomes led to accumulation of translationally inactive polysomes...|$|R

40|$|Young <b>barley</b> <b>leaf</b> is {{consumed}} {{as a popular}} green-colored drink, which is named “Aojiru” in Japan. In the present study, we examined effects of young <b>barley</b> <b>leaf</b> powder (BL) on gastrointestinal transit time (GTT) and fecal moisture and weight in comparison with wheat bran (WB) in male Sprague-Dawley rats. In addition, {{an attempt was made}} to identify BL components responsible for these effects by using various fractions of BL. Additionally, we examined the water-holding capacity and setting volume of BL in vitro. We also examined the granular structures of BL with a scanning electron microscope. As a result, BL supplementation in the diet increased the fecal weight and shortened GTT. Our results demonstrate that the active component responsible for the effect on increasing the fecal volume in BL is the water-insoluble dietary fiber fraction and that this effect is thought to be caused by stimulation of the gut tract by the pH lowering. Furthermore, the high laxative action of BL was thought to be ascribable to the high water-holding capacity due to the complicated structures of BL...|$|R

40|$|Previous work {{suggested}} that the aspartic proteinase from Hordeum vulgare (HvAP) would be a vacuolar protein in plant cells. Based on N-terminal sequencing we show that the in vitro-translated protein was translocated into the lumen of microsomal membranes, causing a concomitant removal of 25 amino acid residues from the protein. Vacuoles were purified from <b>barley</b> <b>leaf</b> protoplasts and were shown to contain all of the aspartic proteinase activity found in the protoplasts. This vacuolar localization of HvAP was confirmed with immunocytochemical electron microscopy using antibodies to HvAP in both <b>barley</b> <b>leaf</b> and root cells. In an attempt to discern a function for this protease, we investigated the ability of HvAP to process the C-terminal proregion of barley lectin (BL) in vitro. Prolectin (proBL), expressed in bacteria, was processed rapidly when HvAP was added. Using several means, {{we were able to}} determine that 13 amino acid residues at the C terminus of proBL were cleaved off, whereas the N terminus stayed intact during this incubation. Immunohistochemical electron microscopy showed that HvAP and BL are co-localized in the root cells of developing embryos and germinating seedlings. Thus, we propose that the vacuolar HvAP participates in processing the C terminus of BL...|$|R
