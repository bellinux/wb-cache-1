The distinction between pressurized and unpressurized support systems for tandem and double seals has lent itself to a more descriptive notation of dual pressurized and dual unpressurized mechanical seal.

50|$|In {{a double}} seal Back to Back, the barrier liquid in the cavity {{between the two}} seals is pressurized. Thus if the primary seal fails, the neutral liquid will leak into the pump stream instead of the {{dangerous}} pumped fluid escaping into the atmosphere. This application is usually used in gas, unstable, highly toxic, abrasive, corrosive, and viscous fluids. These are detailed in API Piping Plan standards #53a, 53b, 53c; or 54. Plan 74 may also be considered a double seal piping plan, although it is used exclusively when describing a dry gas barrier seal support system. The <b>barrier</b> <b>fluid</b> used in a Plan 74 system is simply a gas, not a liquid. Typically, nitrogen is used as its inert nature makes it advantageous due to mixing with the process stream being sealed.|$|E

40|$|Lecturepg. 31 Dual {{mechanical}} seals are operated on pressurized <b>barrier</b> <b>fluid</b> systems when the pump product properties {{do not support}} reliable single seal operation. This provides added protection against environmental release of the pumped product. Traditionally, many dual seal arrangements for pressurized barrier fluids consisted of two standard rotating flexible unit single seals mounted in a back to back orientation. Reliability concerns with the traditional designs include component unseating due to pressure reversal, inadequate provisions for heat removal, and collected debris causing damage to the inboard seal faces. The draft version of API 682 specifies standard pressurized <b>barrier</b> <b>fluid</b> dual seal designs (API 682 Arrangement 3) with two rotating elements and two mating rings in series (tandem arrangement). In addition, it includes design provisions for flush arrangements and component design to prevent unseating due to pressure reversals. The successful design and test validation of two dual seal series designs is described. One design is of the multiple spring type rotating flexible element (API 682 Type A), and one design uses a rotating welded metal bellows (API 682 Type B) with 0. 008 in thick heavy plate construction. Both designs were developed for use in HF acid services. Design features include multiple port injection at the primary seal, and provisions for continued seal operation under a range of pressure reversals and flashing conditions of the pumped product. The testing described includes operation on propane, isobutene, and unleaded gasoline (to simulate motor alkylate) fluids in a laboratory light hydrocarbon test loop.

40|$|In {{this paper}} the authors report {{laboratory}} work and numerical simulation done {{in support of}} development and demonstration of injectable barriers formed from either of two fluids: colloidal silica or polysiloxane. Two principal problems addressed here are control of gel time and control of plume emplacement in the vadose zone. Gel time must be controlled so that the viscosity of the <b>barrier</b> <b>fluid</b> remains low long enough to inject the barrier, but increases soon enough to gel the barrier in place. During injection, the viscosity must be low enough to avoid high injection pressures which could uplift or fracture the formation. To test the grout gel time in the soil, the injection pressure was monitored as grouts were injected into sandpacks. When grout is injected into the vadose zone, it slumps {{under the influence of}} gravity, and redistributes due to capillary forces as it gels. The authors have developed a new module for the reservoir simulator TOUGH 2 to model grout injection into the vadose zone, taking into account the increase of liquid viscosity as a function of gel concentration and time. They have also developed a model to calculate soil properties after complete solidification of the grout. The numerical model has been used to design and analyze laboratory experiments and field pilot tests.

40|$|Four {{types of}} {{dolomite}}s {{occur in the}} Middle Devonian Presqu'ile barrier: fine-crystalline, medium-crystalline, coarse-crystalline, and saddle. Fine-crystalline dolomite formed penecontemporaneously by Middle Devonian seawater, because it is interbedded with Muskeg anhydrite in the back-barrier facies, and has O and Sr isotopic values of Middle Devonian seawater signatures. Medium-crystalline dolomite is interpreted to have formed: (1) at shallow burial depths by fluids derived from compaction, as indicated by its depleted $ delta sp{ 18 }$O values and slightly radiogenic $ sp{ 87 }$Sr/$ sp{ 86 }$Sr ratios; or (2) soon after deposition by Middle Devonian seawater derived from the Elk Point basin, as suggested by its spatial distribution. Coarse-crystalline and saddle dolomites formed after sub-Watt Mountain exposure during burial. The homogenization temperatures of saddle dolomite fluid inclusions indicate that dolomitization occurred at temperatures exceeding maximum burial temperatures. The gradual decrease in Sr isotopes and homogenization temperatures with corresponding increase in O isotopes eastward along the Presqu'ile barrier suggests the basin-scale migration of hot and radiogenic dolomitizing fluids updip from west to east along the Presqu'ile <b>barrier.</b> <b>Fluid</b> movement probably was most active during Late Cretaceous and early Tertiary mountain building {{in conjunction with a}} gravity-driven flow system caused by uplift of the foreland basin.

40|$|LectureAmong the {{technologies}} developed {{for oil and}} gas production centrifugal pump sealing applications, active lift technology {{is one of the most}} promising. The reliability of any centrifugal pump in a critical application is strongly influenced by the performance of the mechanical seals. It is widely accepted based on extensive operating experience that mechanical seals are the most vulnerable components in the pump structure and their life is not easy to predict. Depending on the product being sealed and operating conditions, seals can last from a few weeks to 20 years. Active lift, also known as ?upstream pumping,? seals represent a new approach to the liquid sealing technology with the potential to offer a step change in seal reliability and resulting production gains. Developed from dry gas seal technology its major advantage over conventional contacting mechanical seals is that the face separation is stabilized and there is no rubbing between the seal faces. As rubbing is completely eliminated face deterioration is eliminated and face life is significantly extended together with a considerable reduction in the generated by the seal faces. Another important advantage of this new concept compared to traditional pressurized double seals is the elimination of a sophisticated pressurized <b>barrier</b> <b>fluid</b> system in favor of a much more simple system. It is obvious these days that ?upstream pumping? sealing technology for higher pressure pumping applications is moving from small laboratory scale trials to wide industrial application. This paper takes the form of a general review of the product development and field experience accumulated during 18 months of operation with upstream pumping seals in a critical sea water injection pump application...|$|E
40|$|Lecturepg. 77 Increasing {{environmental}} awareness {{and the ongoing}} need for improved reliability has seen {{an increase in the}} number of water reinjection installations, both onshore and offshore, and in particular in recent years, the use of double pressurized seal solutions. While these double seal solutions have presented a generally satisfactory solution, there are notable instances of problems often associated with the reliability of the supporting pressurization system. This has been particularly so in formation and produced water injection installations in the Middle East. Similarly, in offshore applications, the introduction of comingled service caused by environmental pressures on operators to reinject produced water has caused the traditional single seal solutions to become increasingly unreliable and to lose favor. Until recently, the only available solution has been the pressurized dual seal with all of the additional cost associated with a complex sealing system. However, by the application of ?active lift? technology, originally developed for gas compressors, operators are now seeing the advantage of simple nonpressurized tandem seal arrangements. With these seals, unpressurized <b>barrier</b> <b>fluid</b> is ?pumped? across the inboard seal faces into the process fluid using active lift technology, providing a clean environment within which the seal can operate. These active lift seals have now been developed and applied to a level whereby suction pressures of 70 bar/ 1000 psi and beyond can be handled, providing all of the benefits of a pressurized dual seal, without the complexity and cost of pressurized solution. While active lift technology has been applied to pumps for several years, it has traditionally been associated with low pressure environments. Advances in active lift characteristics have now allowed the technology to be applied on increasingly demanding applications, eliminating the need for complex seal support systems...|$|E
40|$|Lecturepg. 101 A major {{producer}} of ethylene installed and is successfully operating a nonpressurized dual gas seal in liquid methane service. The least reliable pump {{in the unit}} was a single stage overhung centrifugal pump in demethanizer reflux service. The process fluid is marginally over its vapor pressure at a temperature of - 140 F (- 96 C) and pressure of 502 psig (3461 kPa). The pump was originally installed with a dual nonpressurized mechanical seal using n-propanol as the <b>barrier</b> <b>fluid.</b> There were numerous seal problems on the pump and the mean time between repair (MTBR) averaged four months. Many modifications {{were made to the}} sealing system with little or no improvement in the MTBR. A joint development project was initiated involving plant and seal supplier personnel to investigate the use of dual gas seal technology in this service. A cartridge, nonpressureized series arrangement dual gas seal was designed and thoroughly tested before installation in the plant. Testing included operation with a light hydrocarbon in both the liquid and vapor phases. Incorporating an interstage and external labyrinth with an inert gas sweep satisfied low environmental emissions requirements. A purge and vent control panel system was developed to monitor and establish appropriate gas purge and vent settings for containment and emissions purposes. Installation at the plant included a close clearance throat bushing and removal of the seal flush to encourage vapor accumulation in the seal chamber. The first seal was installed in the plant on January 1, 1997, and has operated through November 1998 without problems. The methane vapor emissions at the outboard labyrinth are consistently measured at less than 250 parts per million. The seal has dramatically improved the reliability of this critical pump even under upset conditions. This paper details the seal design parameters, laboratory testing, seal installation, and operation of the pump and support system. The application of this technology can assist plants in reducing emissions, increasing pump MTBR, reducing maintenance costs, and increasing equipment reliability...|$|E

When run against a flat carbon face, laboratory tests show that the wavy seal operates in a non-contacting mode in a gas environment at pressures from zero to 600 psig. Higher gas pressures are achievable but have not been tested yet. Typical face temperature rise is two to six degrees Fahrenheit despite seal size or pressure for speeds from 200 to 3600 rpm. Gas leak rates are one fourth to one half that reported for other noncontacting seals based on grooved face technology at the same operating conditions. Tested gas environments ranged from air and nitrogen to low pressure propane. Testing was done in liquids that included high pressure liquid propane, water, synthetic oil, and crude oil. On high pressure liquid applications, the wavy face seal shows excellent containment of the product. Lab testing shows that the seal successfully contains the sudden introduction of 300 psi liquid propane. The wavy feature is bidirectional and {{is less likely to}} clog than other types of liftoff seal designs that employ some form of grooves in the face. Also, because of the smooth wavy shape, the seal can withstand contact without damage to the carbon face. In all test modes there is insignificant face wear. The wavy seal is employed as a safety backup to primary seals operating in flashing or nonflashing hydrocarbons. The wavy secondary seal should have a longer life than the primary seal and will prevent excessive leakage to the environment if the primary seal fails. The wavy seal can also be employed as a primary seal in low pressure blowers and as a dual seal with nitrogen or air <b>barrier</b> <b>fluid</b> at a higher pressure than the process. This ensures zero leakage of the product to the environment. Over 60 seals are in the field in a variety of applications...|$|E
40|$|A concept {{review of}} {{concentric}} coiled tubing drilling (CTD) system is performed in this Master thesis, hereafter named DualCTD. The main {{purpose is to}} investigate and present the advantages, limitations and applications for the DualCTD system. A feasibility study {{has been carried out}} for subsea drilling of drainage holes from an existing well, and drilling of subsea production wells in the Barents Sea. The DualCTD system consists of two concentric coiled tubing (CT) strings that form a separate circulation system for the drilling fluid. Drilling fluid is pumped down the annulus between the two CT strings to the bottom hole assembly (BHA) where a mud motor generates rotation of the drill bit. The drilling fluid cleans the bit for cuttings and transports the cuttings through a circulating sub/dual float valve and into the inner string. This separated circulating system provides effective hole cleaning {{from the bottom of the}} well. The drilling fluid can be a light fluid, that is optimized for hole cleaning capabilities. A secondary annulus, formed between the DualCTD string and the borehole, is filled with a <b>barrier</b> <b>fluid</b> (BF). Viscous BF is used to separate the two fluid systems in the secondary annulus. Placing the BF in the secondary annuls below seafloor results in an optimized stabilized hydrostatic head. The BF can also be optimized for formation preserving properties. A choke valve in the return fluid line is used to control the back pressure and match the downhole pressure for the two fluid systems with the formation pressure. A light drilling fluid and a heavy BF will also increase the buoyancy of the DualCTD string. Buckling calculations conducted show that longer horizontal sections could be drilled due to increased buckling resistance and reduced friction drag for the buoyant DualCTD string. Horizontal sections of up to 2300 m can be drilled with a 3, 5 x 2, 375 DualCTD setup with a 6 bit for vertical kick-off points of 2000 m and deeper. This is more than three times as long as for conventional CTD. A hydraulic model for calculating the pressure loss in the circulating system is developed. Burst and collapse pressure was found to be limiting for the maximum flow rate due to high frictional pressure loss in the circulation system in deep wells. Cutting transport capacity of the circulation system was found to be low due to the low acceptable flow rates. Cutting transport capacity will therefore limit the maximum rate of penetration. The DualCTD system will also make it possible to drill through challenging pressure regimes, depleted reservoirs and problematic zones with its unique potential for managed pressure drilling. Well control approach for the DualCTD concept will be much of the same as in underbalanced-/managed pressure CTD operations The DualCTD blow out preventer needs to be verified for cutting of the DualCTD string. Running of casing and cementing operations may have to be performed on drill string due to the large weight of the casing and the low axial load capacity of the DualCTD string. Significant development work is needed to bring the DualCTD to a field proven meth...|$|E
