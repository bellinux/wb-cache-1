25|$|Probes with 10:1 {{attenuation}} {{are by far}} {{the most}} common; for large signals (and slightly-less capacitive loading), 100:1 probes are not rare. There are also probes that contain switches to select 10:1 or direct (1:1) ratios, but one must be aware that the 1:1 setting has significant capacitance (tens of pF) at the probe tip, <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> cable's capacitance is now directly connected.|$|E
25|$|Later {{the area}} was {{developed}} by Yap Kwan Seng, the fifth and last Kapitan Cina of Kuala Lumpur. As a businessman, he foresaw an increased demand for bricks in fast-growing Kuala Lumpur and established a kiln in the district. The area soon became the centre for brick-making {{in the early days}} <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> area was a clay pit and good quality bricks are made from clay. Therefore, Brickfields became synonymous with good quality bricks.|$|E
25|$|Raymond Allchin {{states that}} there is a {{powerful}} argument against the idea that the Brahmi script has Semitic borrowing <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> structure and conception is quite different. He suggests that the origin may have been purely indigenous with the Indus script as its predecessor. However, Allchin and Erdosy later in 1995 expressed the opinion that there was as yet insufficient evidence to resolve the question. G.R. Hunter in his book The Script of Harappa and Mohenjodaro and Its Connection with Other Scripts (1934) proposed a derivation of the Brahmi alphabets from the Indus Script, the match being considerably higher than that of Aramaic in his estimation.|$|E

25|$|Rowling {{noted in}} an {{interview}} that because Snape abandoned his post before dying or officially retiring, a portrait of him does not immediately appear in the Headmaster's office following his death. She adds, however, that she would like to think Harry made Snape's true loyalty and heroism known in the Wizarding world, and that he lobbied to ensure that a portrait be installed in the office. In a separate interview, Rowling discussed Snape's back story, saying she had planned it ever since she wrote the first book <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> series is built around it and she considers him {{one of the most important}} characters of the seventh book.|$|E
500|$|A {{backlash}} against grunge {{began to develop}} in Seattle; in late 1992 Jonathan Poneman {{said that in the}} city, [...] "All things grunge are treated with the utmost cynicism and amusement [...] <b>Because</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> thing is a fabricated movement and always has been." [...] Many grunge artists were uncomfortable with their success and the resulting attention it brought. Nirvana's Kurt Cobain told Michael Azerrad, [...] "Famous is the last thing I wanted to be." [...] Pearl Jam also felt the burden of success, with much of the attention falling on frontman Eddie Vedder.|$|E
500|$|Theroux {{described}} approaching filming without entirely {{understanding what}} the plot was about: [...] "You {{get the whole}} script, but {{he might as well}} withhold the scenes you're not in, <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> turns out to be more mystifying than the parts. David welcomes questions, but he won't answer any of them... You work kind of half-blindfolded. If he were a first-time director and hadn't demonstrated any command of this method, I'd probably have reservations. But it obviously works for him." [...] Theroux noted that the only answer Lynch did provide was that he was certain that Theroux's character, a Hollywood director, was not autobiographical of Lynch. Watts stated that she tried to bluff Lynch by pretending she had the plot figured out, and that he delighted in the cast's frustration.|$|E

500|$|Lillywhite {{believed}} that the African influences had not translated well onto the album, remarking: [...] "It's a pity <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> idea of Morocco as a big idea was great. When the big idea for U2 is good, that is when they succeed the most, but I don't think the spirit of what {{they set out to}} achieve was translated. Something happened that meant it did not come across on the record." [...] The Edge concurred, admitting that the group erred by [...] "starting out experimental and then trying to bring it into something that was more accessible". He added, [...] "I think probably we should have said, 'It's an experimental work. That's what it is.'" [...] Mullen refers to the album as [...] "No Craic on the Horizon" [...] and said, [...] "It was pretty fucking miserable. It turns out that we're not as good as we thought we were and things got in the way." ...|$|E
500|$|Led Zeppelin {{also made}} a {{significant}} cultural impact. Jim Miller, editor of Rolling Stone Illustrated History of Rock & Roll, argues that [...] "on one level, Led Zeppelin represents the final flowering of the sixties' psychedelic ethic, which casts rock as passive sensory involvement". Led Zeppelin have also been described as [...] "the quintessential purveyors" [...] of masculine and aggressive [...] "cock rock", although this assertion has been challenged. The band's fashion-sense has been seminal; Simeon Lipman, head of pop culture at Christie's auction house, has commented that [...] "Led Zeppelin have had a big influence on fashion <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> aura surrounding them is so cool, and people {{want a piece of}} that". Led Zeppelin laid the foundation for the big hair of 1980s glam metal bands such as Mötley Crüe and Skid Row. Other musicians have also adapted elements from Led Zeppelin's attitude to clothes, jewellery and hair, such as the hipster flares and tight band T-shirts of Kings of Leon, shaggy hair, clingy T-shirts and bluesman hair of Jack White of the White Stripes, and Kasabian guitarist Sergio Pizzorno's silk scarves, trilbies and side-laced tight jeans.|$|E
500|$|A {{graduate}} of Columbia University architecture school, Kosinski's knowledge of architecture was pivotal in conceptualizing the Tron: Legacy universe. His approach in cultivating a prototype {{was different from}} other film directors because, according to Kosinski, he came [...] "from a design point of view"; [...] "Some of my favorite directors come from outside of the film business, so that made my approach different from other directors, but a design background makes sense for a movie like this <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> world {{has to be made}} from scratch." [...] Lisberger would later state that he left the sequel to a different production team because [...] "after thirty years I don’t want to compete with myself", and to showcase how the next generation dealt with the themes contained in Tron - [...] "If I brought my network in, it would be a little bit like one of those Clint Eastwood movies where all the old guys go to space." [...] Lisberger added that [...] "I dig this role of being the Obi-Wan or the Yoda on this film more than being the guy in the trenches", stating that unlike Kosinski his age was a hindering factor - [...] "I cannot work sixteen hours a day staring at twenty-five monitors for most of that time." ...|$|E

2500|$|Dyker Heights is {{now most}} {{famous for its}} Christmas lights and decorations erected each year by its residents.

[...] Christmas lights are now {{the core of the}} Dyker Heights identity, <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> community, not just one home or one block, participates. As such, Dyker Heights has been {{referred}} to as [...] "an epicenter of professionally hung Christmas lights". Most holiday decorations in the area are not erected by homeowners, but by local decorating companies, but the cost of hiring professional decorators can vary greatly, from $1,000 to $20,000 or more, depending on the scale of the display; many companies also offer additional services, including the option to take down and store decorations.|$|E
