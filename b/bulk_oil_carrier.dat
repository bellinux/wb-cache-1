500|$|At {{the site}} of the Purton Hulks there is less than [...] of land between the river and the Gloucester and Sharpness Canal (or Gloucester and Berkeley Canal). The [...] canal was dug between Gloucester and Sharpness; for much of its length it runs close to the [...] tidal River Severn, but cuts off a {{significant}} loop in the river, at a once-dangerous bend near Arlingham. It was once the broadest and deepest canal in the world. Conceived in the Canal Mania period of the late 18th century, the Gloucester and Berkeley Ship Canal scheme was authorised by a 1793 Act of Parliament. The canal opened in April 1827, having cost £440,000 in the course of its construction. The flood plain of the Severn hereabouts is very flat and so the elevation of the canal does not require any rise over its length. Outside the dock areas at each end, there are no locks. This encouraged the use of the canal for ships larger than on most other British canals, although {{there were a number of}} swing bridges to negotiate. As opened the canal was [...] wide, [...] deep and could take craft of up to 600 tons. In 1905 traffic exceeded one million tons for the first time. Oil was added to the list of cargoes carried by the canal, with <b>bulk</b> <b>oil</b> <b>carriers</b> taking fuel to storage tanks sited to the south of Gloucester.|$|R

5000|$|Often {{criticized by}} marine writers (and some seamen) and {{considered}} difficult to maneuver and sluggish (comparisons to a [...] "bath tub" [...] and a [...] "beached whale" [...] were made), Thomas W. Lawson proved problematic in the ports she {{was intended to}} operate in due {{to the amount of}} water she displaced. She tended to yaw and needed a strong wind to be held on course. Originally built for the Pacific trade, the schooner was used as collier along the American East Coast. A year later in 1903, Crowley withdrew her from the coal trade. He had the topmasts, gaff booms and all other wooden spars removed and had chartered her out as a sea-going barge for the transportation of case oil. In 1906, she was retrofitted for sail at the Newport News Shipbuilding and Drydock Company for use as a <b>bulk</b> <b>oil</b> <b>carrier</b> using the lower steel masts to vent oil gasses from the holds. Her capacity was 60,000 barrels. Under charter to Sun Oil Company, she was the world's first pure sailing tanker, carrying bulk oil from Texas to the eastern seaboard.|$|E

40|$|Lipid {{oxidation}} is a {{great concern}} for food manufacturers and consumers as it negatively impacts not only food quality and nutritive values of food lipids, but also consumer health. Lipid oxidation in <b>bulk</b> <b>oil</b> is impacted by chemical factors, such as, prooxidants and antioxidants, and is also related {{to the existence of}} physical structures. <b>Bulk</b> <b>oils</b> contain a variety of surface active minor components which are able to form physical structures known as association colloids. These physical structures create oil-water interfaces which seem to be an important site where lipid oxidation occurs in <b>bulk</b> <b>oil.</b> Thus, this research focused on how the surface active minor components in <b>bulk</b> <b>oil</b> impact physical structure formation and oxidative stability in <b>bulk</b> <b>oil.</b> In the first study, the influence of polar lipid oxidation products isolated from used frying oil on the oxidative stability of <b>bulk</b> <b>oils</b> and oil-in-water (O/W) emulsions was investigated. Polar compounds were added to <b>bulk</b> stripped corn <b>oil</b> (with and without reverse micelles formed by dioleoylphosphatidylcholine, DOPC) and O/W emulsion to evaluate their prooxidative activity by following the formation of lipid hydroperoxides and hexanal. Polar compounds increased lipid oxidation in <b>bulk</b> <b>oil</b> with and without DOPC. The presence of DOPC reverse micelles decreased the prooxidant activity of the polar oxidation products. On the other hand, there was no significant effect of the polar compounds on oxidation of O/W emulsions. ix Besides phospholipids, other surface active minor components in commercial oils such as free fatty acids may impact lipid oxidation rates and the physical properties of association colloids. Thus, in the second study, the effects of free fatty acids on changes in the critical micelle concentration (CMC) of DOPC in stripped corn oil were determined by using the 7, 7, 8, 8 -tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ) solubilization technique. Different free fatty acids including myristoleic, oleic, elaidic, linoleic and eicosenoic were added at 0. 5 % by wt along with the DOPC (1 - 2000 μmol/kg <b>oil)</b> into the <b>bulk</b> <b>oils.</b> There was no significant effect of free fatty acids with different chain length, configuration and number of double bonds on the CMC value for DOPC in <b>bulk</b> <b>oil.</b> However, increasing concentrations of oleic acid (0. 5, 1, 3 and 5 % by wt) caused the CMC value for DOPC in <b>bulk</b> <b>oils</b> to increase from 400 to 1000 μmol/kg oil. Physical properties of DOPC reverse micelles in the presence of free fatty acids in <b>bulk</b> <b>oils</b> were also investigated by the small angle X-ray scattering technique. Results showed that free fatty acid could impact on the reverse micelle structure of DOPC in <b>bulk</b> <b>oils.</b> Moreover, free fatty acid decreased pH inside reverse micelle as confirmed by the NMR studies. The oxidation studies revealed that free fatty acids exhibited prooxidative activity in the presence and absence of DOPC. Different types of free fatty acids had similar prooxidative activity in <b>bulk</b> <b>oil.</b> In the last experiment, multiple surface active minor components including DOPC, dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine (DOPE), oleic acid, diacylglycerols (DAG) and stigmasterol were incorporated to form nanostructures in stripped corn oil. Individual component significantly decreased the oil-water interfacial tension on which the DOPC and DOPE exhibited the strongest impact. However, the CMC study shows that only DOPC and DOPE could form aggregates at the CMC of 40 and 200 μmol/kg oil. The CMC of the mixed components was as low as 20 μmol/kg oil. The absence of a component did not significantly change the CMC value. x However, in the absence of DOPC, {{we were not able to}} observe the CMC of the mixed components in <b>bulk</b> <b>oil.</b> The NBD-PE probe was used to study the interfacial activity of minor components. The addition of mixed components caused the emission fluorescence intensity increase, suggesting that these components were at the oil-water interface. Again, the absence of a component from the mixture did not significantly change the fluorescence intensity, except when lacking of the DOPC. This indicates that the DOPC plays an important role on association colloid formation. The oxidation study showed that the association colloids formed by adding 100 μmol/kg oil of mixed components decreased the oxidative stability of <b>bulk</b> <b>oil.</b> In addition, the impact of mixed minor components at below (10 μmol/kg oil) and above their CMC (100 μmol/kg oil) on antioxidant activity of α-tocopherol and Trolox (water soluble derivative of tocopherols) at 10 and 50 μmol/kg oil was investigated. The addition of α-tocopherol and Trolox at 10 μmol/kg oil already compensated the prooxidant activity of association colloids. Trolox exhibited stronger antioxidant activity than α-tocopherol. However, the association colloids did not influence the antioxidative effectiveness of either α-tocopherol or Trolox in this study. In conclusion, the surface active minor components formed complex association colloids that decreased the oxidative stability of <b>bulk</b> <b>oil.</b> The presence of reverse micelle impacted the physical location of components such as polar lipid substrates, thus influenced their prooxidant activity. The physicochemical properties of association colloids could change according to the composition of minor components presenting at the oil-water interface. For example, the addition of free fatty acids extended the CMC and altered the pH of the water core of DOPC reverse micelles. The combination of multiple surface active components physically and chemically impacted the oxidative stability and activity of antioxidants in <b>bulk</b> <b>oil.</b> This research xi demonstrates what happens in real commercial oils which are complicated and could provide an idea of how to protect the oil from lipid oxidation...|$|R

40|$|Lipid {{oxidation}} {{leads to}} quality deterioration of foods high in unsaturated fatty acids. Edible oils contain surface active compounds and water that can form physical structures known as association colloids. To {{better understand the}} influence of physical structures on the oxidative stability of <b>bulk</b> <b>oils</b> the role of association colloids on lipid oxidation was investigated. The effectiveness of chain-breaking antioxidants at retarding lipid oxidation depends on their chemical properties and physical location within a food. The first study showed that the surface activity and/or polarity of lipid-soluble antioxidant {{were not the only}} determinant of their effectiveness in food lipids. In the second study of model association colloids in oils, we found that the size of the reverse micelles increased with increased water or phosphatidylcholine concentration, but decreased upon addition of cumene hydroperoxide or oleic acid. Iron catalyzed oxidation of methyl linolenate in the reverse micelle system decreased with increasing water concentration. Phosphatidylcholine decreased methyl linolenate oxidation compared to control and reverse micelles with added oleic acid. These results indicate that water, cumene hydroperoxide, oleic acid, and phosphatidylcholine can alter reverse micelle size and lipid oxidation rates. The influence of these compounds on physical structures of <b>bulk</b> <b>oil</b> was also confirmed in a study using surface active fluorescence probe. The fluorescence intensity of 5 -dodecanoylaminofluorescein (DAF) increased with increasing water concentration in the edible oil. Addition of oleic acid decreased DAF fluorescence due to the ability of the free fatty acid to decrease the pH of the aqueous phase of the <b>bulk</b> <b>oil.</b> Phosphatidylcholine increased DAF fluorescence due to its ability to increase DAF exposure to the aqueous phase. Oleic acid had no impact in the interactions between DAF and water soluble peroxyl radicals while phosphatidylcholine decreased peroxyl radical degradation of DAF. This research established the significance of physical structures of <b>bulk</b> <b>oils</b> on lipid oxidation. Understanding how the physical properties of <b>bulk</b> <b>oils</b> impact lipid oxidation could lead to development of novel antioxidant technologies that help improve the oxidative stability of oils containing increased concentrations of polyunsaturated fatty acids. ...|$|R
