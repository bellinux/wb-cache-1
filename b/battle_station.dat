40|$|Since the {{implementation}} of the <b>Battle</b> <b>Stations</b> program in July 1996 into the recruit training pipeline at Recruit Training Center Great Lakes, it has received much publicity and many accolades from notable military and civilian leaders. They claim the <b>Battle</b> <b>Stations</b> has advanced recruit training farther and has meet the changing cultural environment of recruits and the Navy better than any other training program in recent history. The Navy also declares <b>Battle</b> <b>Stations</b> as a rite of passage for Sailors, similar to the Marine Corps' recruit training event, the Crucible. This thesis examines the creation, implementation, and outputs of the <b>Battle</b> <b>Stations</b> program to determine its overall effectiveness as a training program as a rite of passage. Literature reviews on instructional systems design and rites of passage were conducted to compare it to the <b>Battle</b> <b>Stations</b> program. As a result, <b>Battle</b> <b>Stations</b> was determined to be questionable as a functional training program with little background research performed on design and implementation rationale, and minimally effective as a rite of passage. The Navy should conduct a formal training analysis utilizing models and criteria presented to this thesis to properly determine what changes should be conducted or even if a Battle Stations-type program is needed to meet the Navy's boot camp concerns.

The main range finder {{in the top of the}} battle mast was knocked out of alignment, but Blücher had four more major rangefinders (B-turret, on the bridge roof, the aft <b>battle</b> <b>station</b> (Nachtstand) and C-turret) and many smaller [...] on the bridge and the four rangefinder stations for the AA.

Significantly larger than either {{the first or second}} Death Star, and unlike either of those cost-prohibited space stations, this <b>battle</b> <b>station</b> cut-costs by terraforming an existing planet and draws its fire power directly from a sun, but it requires time to draw enough energy. Once fired, it has the power to destroy up to five planets with the same star system simultaneously. General Hux gave an intense speech while the Starkiller Base demonstrated its lethality by obliterating the five planets of the Hosnian Prime system (the location of the Republic government, which rotates every few years), the cataclysm witnessed by Han Solo, Chewbacca, Rey and Finn from Maz Kanata's castle. After Rey was captured by Kylo Ren, he interrogated her within the base. Han, Chewbacca and Finn approached the base at light-speed because the base's shield kept out anything going under the speed of light. They found Rey and successfully lowered the protective shields, enabling an X-wing assault led by Poe Dameron and Nien Numb to destroy the planet-turned-base, with Poe firing the crucial, destructive shots.|$|E

This temple contained a <b>Battle</b> <b>Station</b> capable of destroying planets, and could only be activated by placing a special Sith Holocron in an obelisk at {{the summit of the}} pyramid inside the temple. Thousands of years prior, a battle was waged on Malachor that resulted in the deaths of its inhabitants. Somewhere between the events of his last appearance in [...] and this episode, Darth Maul had become stranded on Malachor. When Ahsoka Tano, Kanan and Ezra arrived, Ezra was separated from them. He was discovered by a character who later revealed himself to be Maul. Together, they solved a series of test chambers that required cooperation between two Force wielders, and retrieved a Sith Holocron. With the help of Kanan and Ahsoka, they fought three Inquisitors, all of whom were killed by Maul. Maul then betrayed his allies, blinding Kanan, and proceeded to activate the <b>Battle</b> <b>Station.</b> Once Maul was defeated by a sightless Kanan, Darth Vader arrived with the intention of retrieving the holocron, but was challenged by Ahsoka Tano, his former Padawan. While the station was preparing to fire, Kanan and Ezra retrieved the holocron themselves and escaped, preventing this weapon of mass destruction from being used. Even though the temple was destabilized, Ahsoka and Vader kept fighting to the death within the rapidly-crumbling building, until it eventually exploded, wounding Darth Vader and almost killing Ahsoka.|$|E

Harper and early closure of all water-tight doors and hatches ordered by Harper's assistant, Archie P. Kelley, prevented the ship from capsizing. Water damage ruined much of the ship's communications gear, including its battle-phone batteries. An experimental sound-powered telephone circuit connecting the central station with the damage-control parties, tested during the previous summer's damage-control drills, remained operative but was unused. Captain Mervyn S. Bennion, unaware that Harper and Kelly had begun damage-control efforts, ordered Lieutenant C. V. Ricketts to begin counter-flooding the starboard compartments. Ricketts, delayed at his <b>battle</b> <b>station</b> and AA-gun batteries, arrived to find 30 to 40 starboard compartments already flooded. In his report, Ricketts wrote that he witnessed the flooding of one compartment.

Commanded by Governor Tarkin, {{it is the}} Galactic Empire's [...] "ultimate weapon", a huge spherical space station over 100 kilometers in diameter capable of destroying a planet with one shot of its superlaser. The film opens with Princess Leia transporting the station's schematics to the Rebel Alliance to aid them in destroying the Death Star. Tarkin orders the Death Star to destroy Leia's home world of Alderaan {{in an attempt to}} press her into giving him the location of the secret Rebel base; she gives them the false location of Dantooine, but Tarkin has Alderaan destroyed anyway, as a demonstration of the Death Star's firepower and the Empire's resolve. Later, Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, Chewbacca, Obi-Wan Kenobi, C-3PO, and R2-D2 are pulled aboard the station by a tractor beam, where they discover and manage to rescue Princess Leia. As they make their escape, Obi-Wan dies fighting Darth Vader, enabling the others to flee the station. Later, Luke returns as part of a fighter force to attack its only weak point: a ray-shielded particle exhaust vent leading straight from the surface directly into its reactor core. Luke was able to successfully launch his fighter's torpedoes into the vent, impacting the core and triggering a catastrophic explosion, which completely destroyed the station before it could use its superlaser weapon to annihilate its intended target, the rebel base on Yavin IV.|$|E

When the clouds finally cleared, the kamikaze returned. Around 13:00 on 12 November 1944, after sporadic alerts during the morning, Achilles received a warning that bogeys were in the vicinity.

[...] As the landing craft repair ship's forward guns commenced firing, one plane passed ahead; the second, however, turned tightly and commenced a dive straight at Achilles as she and the four LCIs moored to her lay immobile. The repair ship's gunners scored hits on the diving aircraft, but could not stop it. The aircraft crashed into the ship forward, its motor tearing through the main deck. The aircraft itself hit the forward deckhouse in the carpenter shop, where number one repair party had gathered at its <b>battle</b> <b>station.</b> After the deafening explosion that wiped out the repair party, orange-red flames (caused by gasoline from the burning aircraft) swept across the weather deck, while parts of the [...] "Zero" [...] tumbled through the air, some landing [...] astern.
