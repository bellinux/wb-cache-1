40|$|AbstractHead-space {{volatiles}} of {{the fruit}} pulp and the whole fruits (skin volatiles) were investigated using solid phase micro-extraction (SPME) and GC–MS. The two major compounds in the fruit pulp were β-caryophyllene (91. 3 %) and α-humulene (8. 3 %). Thirty volatiles representing 88. 7 % of the total composition were identified in the head-space of the whole fruits. Heptadecene (16. 1 %); benzyl 4 -methylpentanoate (8. 8 %), <b>benzyl</b> <b>butyrate</b> (6. 7 %), (Z) - 13 -octadecenal (6. 2 %) and cyclo-pentadecane (5. 7 %) were present in levels higher than 5 %. The major alcohol detected in the head-space of the whole intact fruits was (Z) - 3 -decen- 1 -ol (8. 4 %) ...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To {{study the}} effect of {{changing}} structure of benzyl esters on its reactivity in sodium dodecyl sulfate micelles. Methods: Ester molecules with benzyl moiety were either purchased or synthesized. Alkyl groups of the esters were increased incrementally from one to six carbons, also, {{the location of the}} ester bond was shifted from the first carbon attached to the benzene ring as in benzyl acetate to three and six carbons awary from the benzene ring as in 3 -Phenylpropylacetate and 6 -Phenylhexylacetate. Hydrolysis reaction rate constants fro each compound were determined in borate buffer at pH 9 and in surfactant solutions at 40 degrees C. HPLC was used to separate reactants and products. Results: As the number of carbon atoms in the alkyl chain has increased, rate constant in buffer decreased according to an increase in the alkyl chain starting from methyl and ending with hexyl. In micelles, rate constants also decreased as the surfactant concentration increased, this effect can be attributed to an increase in partitioning of the ester molecules into micelles. Conclusion: Date suggests that benzyl acetate, propionate, butyrate, 3 -phenylpropyl acetate and pentanoate are located inside the palisade layer of the micelles where water is present. In regard to the orientation of the ester molecules, comparing <b>benzyl</b> <b>butyrate</b> and 3 -phenypropyl acetate rate constants in micelles, data suggests that hydrocarbon chains of both molecules were facing the surface of the micelle.

40|$|Dietary {{modulation}} of {{the synthesis}} of endogenous host defense peptides (HDPs) represents a novel antimicrobial approach {{for disease control and}} prevention, particularly against antibiotic-resistant infections. However, HDP regulation by dietary compounds such as butyrate is species-dependent. To examine whether butyrate could induce HDP expression in pigs, we evaluated the expressions of a panel of porcine HDPs in IPEC-J 2 intestinal epithelial cells, 3 D 4 / 31 macrophages, and primary monocytes in response to sodium butyrate treatment by real-time PCR. We revealed that butyrate is a potent inducer of multiple, but not all, HDP genes. Porcine b-defensin 2 (pBD 2), pBD 3, epididymis protein 2 splicing variant C (pEP 2 C), and protegrins were induced markedly in response to butyrate, whereas pBD 1 expression remained largely unaltered in any cell type. Additionally, a comparison of the HDP-inducing efficacy among saturated free fatty acids of different aliphatic chain lengths revealed that fatty acids containing 3 – 8 carbons showed an obvious induction of HDP expression in IPEC-J 2 cells, with butyrate being the most potent and long-chain fatty acids having only a marginal effect. We further investigated a panel of butyrate analogs for their efficacy in HDP induction, and found glyceryl tributyrate, <b>benzyl</b> <b>butyrate,</b> and 4 -phenylbutyrate to be comparable with butyrate. Identification of butyrate and several analogs with a strong capacity to induce HDP gene expression in pigs provides attractive candidates for further evaluation of their potential as nove...|$|E
40|$|The areCBA {{genes in}} Acinetobacter sp. strain ADP 1, {{determining}} growth on benzyl alkanoates, are {{shown to be}} transcribed as a single operon and regulated by areR, which encodes a regulatory protein of the NtrC/XylR family. Assays of the Are enzymes and of two insertions of lacZ as a reporter gene {{have shown that the}} operon is induced by benzyl acetate, benzyl alcohol, and benzaldehyde, as well as 2 - and 4 -hydroxybenzyl acetates and <b>benzyl</b> propionate and <b>butyrate.</b> Two adjacent sites of transcriptional initiation were 97 and 96 bp upstream of the start codon for areC, near a ς 54 -dependent − 12, − 24 promoter.

40|$|The ester-hydrolyzing {{actions of}} {{extracts}} {{of a number}} of tissues of rabbits of different ages were studied under comparable conditions. The ages of the rabbits ranged from 8 days before birth to 2162 days. The esters used included phenyl acetate, glyceryl triacetate, methyl <b>butyrate,</b> <b>benzyl</b> acetate, methyl acetate, ethyl acetate, ethyl butyrate, methyl benzoate, ethyl benzoate, and isobutyl acetate. The following tissues were studied: kidney, liver, lung, skin, leg muscle, heart muscle, brain, spleen, stomach, and small intestine. The results, as in previous communications, are presented in the form of plots for the relative enzyme actions, and in tables for the absolute actions. The changes in the curves of the relative actions as the rabbits became older are considered in some detail. The relations between the embryonic state of certain tissues, as shown by their enzyme actions, and the adult state, are described, and compared with their physiological behavior. The probable reversion to a type approaching the embryonic for the oldest rabbits studied is indicated with some of the tissues. The changes in the absolute enzyme actions of the tissues as the rabbits became older are also discussed. The absolute actions do not form as regular a progression as do the relative actions but, at the same time, show marked regularities with increasing age of the rabbits...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Introduction The {{hide beetle}} Dermestes maculatus (Coleoptera: Dermestidae) feeds {{as an adult}} and larva on decomposing animal remains and {{can also be found}} on human corpses. Therefore, {{forensic}} entomological questions with regard to when and how the first receptive females appear on carcasses are important, as the developmental stages of their larvae can be used to calculate the post-mortem interval. To date, we know that freshly emerged males respond to the cadaver odour of post-bloated carcasses (approximately 9 days after death at T mean = 27 °C), being attracted by <b>benzyl</b> <b>butyrate.</b> This component occurs at its highest concentration at this stage of decay. The aim of our {{study was to determine the}} principle of attraction of virgin females to the feeding and breeding substrate. For this purpose, we tested the response of these females to headspace samples of piglet cadavers and male sex pheromones [(Z 9) -unsaturated fatty acid isopropyl esters] in a Y-olfactometer. Because we expected that such an odour combination is of importance for virgin female attraction, we tested the following two questions: 1) Are virgin female hide beetles attracted by a combination of cadaver odour and male sex pheromones? 2) During which decomposition stage do the first virgin females respond to cadaver odour when combined with male sex pheromones? Results We found that young virgin females were attracted to the cadaver by a combination of cadaver odour and male sex pheromones. Neither cadaver odour alone nor male sex pheromones alone was significantly more attractive than a solvent control. Our results also gave a weak indication that the first young virgin females respond as early as the post-bloating stage to its associated decomposition odour when combined with male sex pheromones. Conclusions Our results indicate that freshly emerged males possibly respond to cadaver odour and visit carcasses before virgin females. Being attracted to cadavers when male sex pheromone is perceived as well, virgin females can optimise their reproductive possibilities. </p...|$|E
