5|$|In Norse mythology Ægir was the sea god and Rán, his wife, was the sea goddess while Njörðr was {{the god of}} sea travel. It {{was best}} to propitiate the gods <b>before</b> <b>setting</b> out on a voyage.|$|E
5|$|Cleomenes had {{fortified}} all the passes into Laconia with barricades and trenches <b>before</b> <b>setting</b> {{off with}} his army of 20,000 men to the pass at Sellasia, on the northern border of Laconia. Overlooking the pass at Sellasia were two hills, Evas and Olympus. Cleomenes positioned his brother, Eucleidas, with the allied troops and the Perioeci on Evas; he stationed himself on Olympus with 6,000 Spartan hoplites and 5,000 mercenaries.|$|E
5|$|The Natya Shastra (13.66) {{recommends}} worship to Matrikas <b>before</b> <b>setting</b> up {{the stage}} and before dance performances. Indra declares in chapter 90 of Devi Purana that the Matrikas are the best among all deities and should be worshipped in cities, villages, towns and shields. Matrikas are generally to be worshipped on all occasions with Navagraha (the nine planets) and the Dikpala (Guardians of the directions) and at night with the Goddess.|$|E
5000|$|The idea of Ash as an import god is contested, {{as he was}} the god of Ombos long <b>before</b> <b>Set's</b> {{introduction}} {{sometime in}} the 2nd Dynasty. One of his titles is [...] "Nebuty" [...] or [...] "He of Nebut" [...] indicating this position.|$|R
60|$|It {{was plain}} enough {{that there was}} nothing for Alberdin to do but to go and look for the heavy {{infantry}} man. Phedo was very anxious to accompany him, and the two, mounted as <b>before,</b> <b>set</b> out from the city on their quest.|$|R
2500|$|<b>Before</b> <b>set</b> {{theory was}} introduced, {{the notion of}} the size of a set had been problematic. It had been {{discussed}} by Galileo Galilei and Bernard Bolzano, among others.

5|$|The {{production}} team returned briefly to the UK {{to shoot at}} the Faslane submarine base <b>before</b> <b>setting</b> off to Spain, Portugal and the Bay of Biscay where the supertanker exteriors were filmed. On 5 December 1976, with principal photography finished, the 007 Stage was formally opened by former Prime Minister Harold Wilson.|$|E
5|$|Although the Admiralty saw no use {{to which}} Halkett's designs could be put in general naval service, this larger design was {{extremely}} well received by explorers. John Franklin bought one {{to take on the}} ill-fated 1845 expedition in which the entire expedition party of 129men and two ships vanished. Franklin saw Halkett boats as so essential to travel in Canada that he gave the boat intended for his expedition to Sir George Simpson, Governor-in-Chief of Rupert's Land, for use in his travels in the region. He ordered a replacement boat from Halkett, who delivered it in time for him to take possession <b>before</b> <b>setting</b> out on his last expedition.|$|E
5|$|Despite the uncertainly {{surrounding}} {{the inception of}} his reign, the chronicle reveals that Lǫgmaðr faced continued opposition from within his own family {{in the form of}} an ongoing rebellion by his brother, Haraldr. Lǫgmaðr eventually overcame Haraldr, however, and is stated to have had the latter blinded and emasculated. Afterwards, if the chronicle is to be believed, Lǫgmaðr repented the cruelty that he had inflicted upon Haraldr, and remorsefully resigned his kingdom, <b>before</b> <b>setting</b> off to Jerusalem, where he died.|$|E

50|$|The {{forces of}} Dol Guldur were {{defeated}} and fled south towards into Fangorn Forest. Treebeard {{and a host}} of Ents, having already laid ruin to Isengard some days <b>before,</b> <b>set</b> out to prevent them entering Rohan. Remnants of despairing Orcs fled eastward but were either killed by the tree-shepherds or drowned in the River Anduin.|$|R
5|$|Following the World Championships, Bolt ran 9.85 {{seconds for}} the 100m {{to win in}} Zagreb <b>before</b> <b>setting</b> the year's best time of 9.76 seconds at the Memorial Van Damme. This run was overshadowed by Jamaican rival Blake's {{unexpected}} run of 19.26 seconds in the 200m at the same meeting, which brought him within seven hundredths of Bolt's world record. Although Bolt failed to win the Diamond Race in a specific event, he was not beaten on the 2011 IAAF Diamond League circuit, taking three wins {{in each of his}} specialities that year.|$|E
5|$|Following these events, Macrinus {{traveled}} to Apamea {{to ensure the}} loyalty of Legio II Parthica <b>before</b> <b>setting</b> off to march against Emesa. According to Dio, Macrinus appointed his son Diadumenian {{to the position of}} Imperator, and promised the soldiers 20,000 Sesterces each, with 4,000 of these to be paid on the spot. Dio further comments that Macrinus hosted a dinner for the residents of Apamea in honour of Diadumenian. At the dinner, Macrinus was supposedly presented with the head of Ulpius Julianus who had been killed by his soldiers. In response, Macrinus left Apamea headed south.|$|E
5|$|In 1987 Nuttin {{published}} his second study, describing experiments done in 1984 and 1985 {{with the help}} of Hilde Sas. Because of the far-reaching implications of the name-letter effect for psychological theories, Nuttin found it wise to first test the effect's generality and robustness, <b>before</b> <b>setting</b> off on a research program aimed at understanding the underlying affective and cognitive processes at work. He wondered whether the effect would be found in all cultural and linguistic communities, or whether the first study revealed an effect due to some unknown idiosyncratic aspect of the Dutch language in Belgium.|$|E

5|$|In 1992, {{elements}} of the Zrinski Battalion {{took part in the}} Battle of Kupres, <b>before</b> <b>setting</b> up a training camp in the town of Tomislavgrad. There the battalion personnel assisted in setting up and trained the Croatian Defence Council (Hrvatsko vijeće obrane – HVO). Later that year, {{elements of}} the battalion took part in Operation Tiger—aimed at lifting of the Siege of Dubrovnik. In 1993, {{elements of the}} Zrinski Battalion took part in Operation Maslenica, fighting in the area of Škabrnja. The Central Intelligence Agency assessed the Zrinski Battalion {{as one of the best}} units of the HV.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to his acting career, Madhavan {{has worked as a}} writer on his films, hosted television programmes and has been a prominent celebrity endorser for brands and products. He has also worked as a film producer, first making Evano Oruvan with Leukos Films, <b>before</b> <b>setting</b> up Tricolour Films to produce Saala Khadoos (2016). Madhavan is noted for his philanthropic activities and promotes various causes such as environment, health and education. He is particularly vocal about the protection of animals and was awarded PETA's Person of the Year recognition in 2012.|$|E
5|$|Johnston {{is driving}} along a quiet road, when his car is {{overtaken}} by Gunsche. Gunsche forces Johnston off the road, strangles him to death, and places {{a piece of}} wood—meant to resemble the Cross—inside Johnston's car, <b>before</b> <b>setting</b> him and the car ablaze. The remains are later examined by Watts and Means; they cannot determine if the wood is the Cross or not. However, Watts finds Johnston's partially burnt diary, and reads an entry about his contacting Means. Suspecting betrayal, he expels Means from the Group immediately.|$|E

5|$|Joining Task Force 58 in January 1944, North Carolina escorted {{aircraft}} carriers as the flagship of Admiral Willis A. Lee {{for much of}} the year, providing support for airborne strikes on Kwajalein, Namur, Truk (twice), Saipan, Tinian, Guam, Palau, Woleai, and Hollandia in January–April. Also in April, North Carolina destroyed defensive installations on Ponape <b>before</b> <b>setting</b> course for Pearl Harbor for repairs to a damaged rudder. With repairs completed, the battleship joined with Enterprise on 6 June for assaults within the Marianas; as part of these, North Carolina used its main battery to bombard Saipan and Tanapag.|$|E
5|$|Løvold {{was born}} on 19 November 1888 in Kristiansund, Norway, as son of Missionary Ole Løvold (1846–1919). Løvold started as a butcher {{apprentice}} with his brother B. O. Løvold, <b>before</b> <b>setting</b> out on his journeyman years, where he worked at Bye in Bergen and Axel Jensen in Oslo. He received his trade certificate in 1910. He moved back to Kristiansund in 1913, where he lived {{for the rest of}} his life. He married Bergljot, who died in 1958.|$|E
5|$|Michael Bree's first {{victim was}} Jodie Hyde, a {{recovering}} butane gas addict {{whom he met}} at the Rainbow before killing her hours later. He {{is thought to have}} strangled her <b>before</b> <b>setting</b> her body on fire near a recreation ground. Three days later, he met mother-of-three Rosemary Corcoran at the same public house and drove her to a rural location, where he bludgeoned her to death and drove over the body. Then, as he drove home, he hit care worker Carol Jordan with his car and, fearing capture, beat her to death. All three bodies were discovered soon after the murders were carried out.|$|E
50|$|This {{method of}} suicide is {{relatively}} rare {{due to the}} long and painful experience one {{has to go through}} <b>before</b> death <b>sets</b> in. This is also contributed to by the ever-present risk that the fire is extinguished <b>before</b> death <b>sets</b> in, and in that way causes one to live with severe burnings, scar tissue, and the emotional impact of such horrific injuries.|$|R

5|$|Murray {{was ordered}} to take Levant back to sea immediately, departing Portsmouth on 27 July as escort to a convoy of {{merchant}} vessels bound for the Yorkshire port of Kingston upon Hull. The ageing frigate then briefly joined a small Navy squadron on patrol off Brighton <b>before</b> <b>setting</b> sail for the Spanish coast. On 5 August she {{took part in the}} recapture of a British merchant vessel, Nine Colliers. She was off Cadiz in October 1779 when she won her final victory of the war, capturing the 20-gun Spanish privateer Velenza de Alcantara along with 200 of her crew.|$|E
5|$|Nikolai Volkoff competed at Survivor Series 1990 in a {{match that}} pitted {{him and his}} {{partners}} against Sgt. Slaughter, Boris Zhukov, and The Orient Express. He was eliminated by Slaughter, who was later disqualified when his manager, General Adnan hit Tito Santana with an Iraqi flag. Slaughter and Volkoff also faced each other on many house shows throughout {{the second half of}} 1990. Slaughter won the majority of these contests <b>before</b> <b>setting</b> his sights on the WWF World Heavyweight Championship.|$|E
5|$|On 15 June {{the royal}} {{government}} and the remaining rebels, who were unsatisfied with the charters granted the previous day, agreed to meet at Smithfield, just outside the city walls. London remained in confusion, with various bands of rebels roaming the city independently. Richard prayed at Westminster Abbey, <b>before</b> <b>setting</b> out for the meeting in the late afternoon. The chronicler accounts of the encounter all vary on matters of detail, but agree on the broad sequence of events. The King and his party, at least 200 strong and including men-at-arms, positioned themselves outside St Bartholomew's Priory {{to the east of}} Smithfield, and the thousands of rebels massed along the western end.|$|E
