50|$|Shortly thereafter, Sinn {{interpreted}} the Target balances {{for the first}} time within the context of current account deficits, international private capital movements and the international shifting of the refinancing credit that the national central banks of the Eurosystem grant to the commercial banks in their jurisdiction. He proved that the ECB system compensated the interruption and reversal in capital flows triggered by the financial crisis by shifting refinancing credit among national central banks. The increase in Target liabilities is a direct measure of net payment orders across borders, i.e. of the portion of the current account deficit that is not counterbalanced by capital imports, or, equivalently, the sum of the current account deficit and net capital exports. Indirectly, they also measure a country's amount of central bank money created and lent out beyond what is needed for domestic circulation. Since every country needs a relatively steady amount of central bank money for its domestic transactions, payment orders to other countries, which reduce the domestic stock of money, must be offset by a continuous issuing of new refinancing credit, i.e., the creation of new central bank money. Similarly, the increase in money balances in the country whose central bank honours the payment orders reduces the demand for fresh refinancing credit. Hence, a country's Target liabilities also indicate the extent to which its central bank has replaced the capital markets to finance its current account deficit, as well as any possible capital flight, by creating new central bank money through corresponding refinancing credit. Sinn illustrated that from an economic perspective, Target credit and formal rescue facilities serve the same purpose and involve similar liability risks. Sinn's presentation on 19 May 2011 at the Munich Economic Summit motivated an op-ed column in the Financial Times.

40|$|The paper {{constructs}} financial-account {{stock data}} for Denmark 1875 - 2005 {{on an annual}} frequency and explores the historical monetary and financial trends and cycles {{on the basis of}} the new data set. The annual financial-account data constructed in the paper are based on a comprehensive range of historical financial statistics. The data set presented is broken down by 8 institutional sectors (central bank; commercial banks and savings banks; mortgage-credit institutes; lifeinsurance companies and pension funds; investment associations; central government; other residents; non-residents) and 6 main types of financial instruments (gold and SDR; currency; loans and deposits; bonds, shares and mutual funds shares; insurance technical reserves; capital and reserves). Commercial banks, savings banks and mortgage-credit institutions played a significant credit-supplying role in the Danish economy already during the late 19 th century and in the beginning of the twentieth century. A turning point emerged during the early 1930 s, and by the middle of the 1950 s the ratio of credit to GDP had declined substantially. Since then the trend has reversed but the pre-World War I level was not reached until the decade from the mid- 1970 s to the mid- 1980 s. To some extent real asset prices have displayed a similar pattern. There has been a massive growth in the assets under management by life-insurance companies and pension funds since the mid- 1970 s and by collective investment funds since the mid- 1990 s. There has been a much stronger positive correlation between money and prices at the longterm frequencies (8 - 40 years cycles) than at the business cycle frequency (2 - 8 years), but in the post-World War II period prices seem to have led money at all frequencies. In the period 1875 - 1945 house prices led credit from mortgage-credit institutions with a considerable leadtime (6 years) in the long-term cycles - in the post World War II period the lead-time has been considerable shorter (1 year). During the whole period 1875 - 2005 real credit granted by banks and mortgage-credit institutions have been almost contemporaneous with real GDP, and the largest correlation coefficients have occurred in the long-term cycles. The overall conclusion in the paper is that financial accounts are a useful framework for organising and analysing financial data even when data sources are somewhat fragmented and sparse, which is often the case in relation to historical financial statistics. Financial accounts can be useful in an attempt to paint a more coherent picture of the historical development of the financial system and the financial structure. Utilising accounting identities a system of financial accounts allows e. g. for the compilation of the net financial asset position of the non-financial private sector, even when no separate <b>balance-sheet</b> <b>statistics</b> covers this sector. To date projects related to historical national-accounts have - both in Denmark and internationally - only focused on the real side of the economy. It would, however, be interesting if future projects would make an attempt to cover long-span time series of financial accounts as well, including both stock- and flow-data...|$|E
