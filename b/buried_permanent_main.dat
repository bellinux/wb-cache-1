40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to propose a global {{minimization}} algorithm belonging to the class of Controlled Random Search algorithms, to interface with the Finite Element analysis procedure for optimizing the design of <b>Buried</b> <b>Permanent</b> Magnet Synchronous motors and Synchronous Reluctance motors. The behavior of the proposed algorithm has been compared, in terms of attainable optimum and computation time, with the one of a minimization procedure available at commercial software. This comparison has shown a significant more efficiency of the considered algorithm especially in the more complex designing of a Synchronous Reluctance motor. The goodness of the results achieved with the proposed algorithm shows that combining the FE analysis with a suitable strategy is an effective and powerful tool for the design optimization of electric motors...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — To {{improve the}} {{efficiency}} of submersible pumps, the solution {{described in this article}} consists in replacing the rotor of the induction motor with a rotor presenting a squirrel cage and <b>buried</b> <b>permanent</b> magnets that can start on the grid. The analytical procedure to design the rotor is presented with magnets placed in U shape and a four-pole motor. The steady state and transient performances of the different designed motors are then studied using finite element calculations and analytical models. As an example, the design of a 75 kW four-pole motor is described.

40|$|In this paper, a new {{topology}} of concentric magnetic gears {{is proposed}} and implemented. The key {{of the new}} topology is to <b>bury</b> <b>permanent</b> magnets (PMs) of the outer rotor into the iron core {{in a new way}} so that the mechanical integrity can be improved, and the PM material can be saved while the torque density is maintained. The proposed gear is designed with the speed reduction ratio of 7. 33 and optimized by using the three-dimensional finite element method (3 D-FEM). The key of the 3 D-FEM is to employ scalar magnetic potential to reduce the required memory and time for data manipulation and computation. After prototyping, the measured maximum static torque well agrees with the calculated one, hence verifying the proposed design and analysis. © 2009 American Institute of Physics. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|Induction motors are {{commonly}} coupled to a gearbox when an application requires a low speed {{and a high}} torque. The gearbox is costly, needs maintenance and decreases {{the efficiency of the}} drive. Therefore, taking away the gearbox is very advantageous. This can be made possible by using a permanent magnet (PM) synchronous motor running directly at low speed, so called direct-drive PM synchronous motor. In this thesis, low-speed direct-drive PM motors are investigated for a 4. 4 kW, 50 rpm mixer used for wastewater treatment. The thesis begins with an overview of different existing low-speed direct-driven applications. It concentrates then on a few topologies that are promising for the considered application: five different radial-flux PM machine configurations with surface-mounted or <b>buried</b> <b>permanent</b> magnets and two Torus axial-flux PM machine configurations.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{deals with}} the {{prediction}} of magnetic field distribution and electromagnetic performances of parallel double excitation and spoke-type permanent magnet (PM) motors using simplified (SM) and exact (EM) analytical models. The simplified analytical model corresponds to a simplified geometry of the studied machines where the rotor and stator tooth-tips and the shape of polar pieces are not taken into account. A 2 D analytical solution of magnetic field distribution is established. It involves solution of Laplace's and Poisson's equations in stator and rotor slots, airgap, <b>buried</b> <b>permanent</b> magnets into rotor slots and non magnetic region under magnets. A comparison between the results issued from the simplified model with those from exact model (EM) (which represents a more realistic geometry with stator and rotor tooth-tips and the shape of polar pieces) is done to show {{the accuracy of the}} simplified geometry on magnetic field distribution and electromagnetic performances (cogging torque, electromagnetic torque, flux linkage, back-EMF, self and mutual inductances).

40|$|A sparse areal <b>permanent</b> {{array of}} <b>buried</b> {{geophones}} was de-ployed at the Aquistore CO 2 storage site in Saskatchewan, Can-ada. The {{purpose of this}} array is to facilitate 4 D seismic monitoring of CO 2 {{that is to be}} injected to the deep subsurface. Use of a sparse buried array is designed to improve the repeat-ability of time-lapse data and to economize the monitoring ef-fort. Prior to the start of CO 2 injection, two 3 D dynamite seismic surveys were acquired in March 2012 and May 2013 using the permanent array. The objective of acquiring these data was to allow an assessment of the data repeatability and overall perfor-mance of the permanent array. A comparison of the raw data from these surveys and with a conventional high-resolution 3 D vibroseis survey demonstrated that (1) the signal-to-noise ratio for the buried geophones was increased by 6 – 7 dB relative to surface-deployed geophones and by an additional 20 dB for dynamite relative to a vibroseis source, (2) the use of buried sensors and sources at this site {{did not appear to be}} significantly degraded by the effects of ghosting, (3) repeatability for the per-manent array data was excellent with a mean normalized root-mean-square (nrms) value of 57 % for the raw baseline-monitor difference, (4) the variance of nrms values was higher for shot gathers (18 %) compared with receiver gathers (7 %), and (5) the raw data repeatability was a factor of three improved over that of comparable surface-geophone data acquired at a nearby loca-tion. The use of a sparse <b>buried</b> <b>permanent</b> array at the Aquistore site has demonstrably achieved a reduction in ambient noise lev-els and overall enhanced data repeatability, both of which are keys to successful 4 D seismic monitoring...|$|R
