5|$|Non-fatal {{violence}} against women has severe implications for women’s physical, mental and reproductive health, and is seen as not simply isolated events <b>but</b> <b>rather</b> <b>a</b> systematic pattern of behaviour that both violates their rights but also limits their role in society and requires a systematic approach.|$|E

5|$|The metal {{was used}} by pre-Columbian Americans near modern-day Esmeraldas, Ecuador to produce {{artifacts}} of a white gold-platinum alloy. They employed a relatively sophisticated system of powder metallurgy. The platinum used in such objects was not the pure element, <b>but</b> <b>rather</b> <b>a</b> naturally occurring mixture of the platinum group metals, with small amounts of palladium, rhodium, and iridium.|$|E

Carson's most notable achievements included recruiting Tech's first ever African American scholarship athlete and being the first Tech head coach to be fired.|$|E

Nathan Drake was also on the shortlist for being a guest character in Street Fighter x Tekken, however the idea was scrapped.|$|E

5|$|In 1842, {{the young}} Danish {{archaeologist}} J. J. A. Worsaae disagreed the Haraldskær Woman was Gunnhild. A pioneer in archaeological stratigraphy, Worsaae presented evidence the Haraldskær Woman dated from the Iron Age. Later radiocarbon dating confirmed {{the body was}} not Gunnhild, <b>but</b> <b>rather</b> <b>a</b> woman of the early Iron Age who lived about 490 BC. Though no one proved the Haraldskær Woman has any royal lineage, her body lies in state in a display in the north transept of Saint Nicolai Church.|$|E
5|$|In 1987, Canadian {{volcanologist}} Catherine Hickson {{revealed that}} the Wells Gray-Clearwater volcanic field {{is not part of}} the Anahim Volcanic Belt, <b>but</b> <b>rather</b> <b>a</b> separate centre that most likely represents an area of lithospheric decompression melting caused by rifting along pre-existing crustal fractures. The Wells Gray-Clearwater volcanic field has since not been considered part of the Anahim Volcanic Belt and the Anahim hotspot is now believed to be in the area of Nazko Cone.|$|E
5|$|Mari is not {{considered}} a small settlement that later grew, <b>but</b> <b>rather</b> <b>a</b> new city that was purposely founded during the Mesopotamian Early Dynastic period I c. 2900 BC, to control the waterways of the Euphrates trade routes that connect the Levant with the Sumerian south. The city was built about 1 to 2 kilometers away from the Euphrates river {{to protect it from}} floods, and was connected to the river by an artificial canal that was between 7 and 10 kilometers long depending on which old meander it used to be attached with, which is hard to identify today.|$|E

5|$|One {{prevailing}} {{idea is that}} carnivory {{in plants}} is not {{a black and white}} duality, <b>but</b> <b>rather</b> <b>a</b> spectrum from strict non-carnivorous photoautotrophs (a rose, for example) to fully carnivorous plants with active trapping mechanisms like those of Dionaea or Aldrovanda. However, passive traps are still considered fully carnivorous. Plants that fall between the definitions in the strict carnivorous/non-carnivorous demarcation can be defined as being protocarnivorous.|$|E
5|$|The Mariotes worshiped both Semitic and Sumerian deities and {{established}} their {{city as a}} center of old trade. However, although the pre-Amorite periods were characterized by heavy Sumerian cultural influence, Mari was not a city of Sumerian immigrants <b>but</b> <b>rather</b> <b>a</b> Semitic speaking nation that used a dialect similar to Eblaite. The Amorites were West-Semites who began to settle the area before the 21st century BC; by the Lim dynasty's era (c. 1830 BC), they became the dominant population in the Fertile Crescent.|$|E
5|$|The last tenet, '{{socialism}}', did {{not mean}} socialism as it is defined in the West, <b>but</b> <b>rather</b> <b>a</b> unique form of Arab socialism. Aflaq coined the word Arab socialism for his variant of socialism. Socialism, in its original form in the Arab world had, according to Aflaq, first come into being {{under the rule of}} Muhammad. The point of Arab socialism was not to answer questions such as: how much state control was necessary, or economic equality; but instead Arab socialism was a system that freed the Arab people from oppression and enslavement, which in turn created independent individuals.|$|E

Additionally, this branch can be installed through a system upgrade from stable or testing.|$|E
5|$|Abby {{is in love}} again, {{but then}} finds out that Charles is the front {{for a group of}} thugs wanting to build a marina at Lotus Point for drug trafficking. Abby pretends {{to go along with the}} {{marriage}} and accepts a two million dollar wedding gift from Charles. After the ceremony she has the marriage annulled, but keeps the money. After this, Abby marries Greg Sumner. It isn't love, <b>but</b> <b>rather</b> <b>a</b> political marriage. Abby forms another company, Morikame, in order to buy Lotus Point. When her former partners find out and threaten to have her arrested for fraud, she donates Lotus Point to the government as a wildlife preserve. Abby goes after a political appointment that Greg wants, and leaves Knots Landing to be a trade representative in Japan. Abby later forms another illegal company with Nigel Treadwell, and tries to take over the Sumner Group, but her plan fails. She moves back into her old house on the cul-de-sac.|$|E
5|$|Agaricus deserticola, {{commonly}} known as the gasteroid agaricus, is a species of fungus in the family Agaricaceae. Found only in southwestern and western North America, A.deserticola is adapted for growth in dry or semi-arid habitats. The fruit bodies are secotioid, meaning the spores are not forcibly discharged, and the cap does not fully expand. Unlike other Agaricus species, A.deserticola does not develop true gills, <b>but</b> <b>rather</b> <b>a</b> convoluted and networked system of spore-producing tissue called a gleba. When the partial veil breaks or pulls away from the stem or the cap splits radially, the blackish-brown gleba is exposed, which allows the spores to be dispersed.|$|E
