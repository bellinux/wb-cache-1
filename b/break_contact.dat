5|$|Goeben {{returned}} fire {{shortly afterward}} and hit Evstafi {{in the middle}} funnel; the shell detonated after it passed through the funnel and destroyed the antennae for the fire-control radio, which meant that Evstafi could not correct Ioann Zlatousts inaccurate range data. The other ships either used Ioann Zlatousts incorrect data or never saw Goeben and failed to register any hits on the German ship. Goeben hit Evstafi four more times, although one shell failed to detonate, before Rear Admiral Wilhelm Souchon decided to turn away and <b>break</b> <b>contact</b> after fourteen minutes of combat. Evstafi suffered 34 killed and 24 wounded from those hits, and only fired between 12 and 16 twelve-inch shells, as well as 14 eight-inch and 19 six-inch shells. Ioann Zlatoust fired only six shells from her main armament.|$|E

The victorious ant will remain raised upward and reach {{down to the}} worker and open its mandibles wider, grasping on the opponent's mandibles, and then tug and shake its head slightly for a few moments. However, the fight may continue if neither worker backs down, and will commence a side to side posture. Both ants circle each other and present their gasters directed to their opponent, and on some occasions, either {{one or both of}} the ants would kick outward using their legs at each other.

6000|$|... 1060. The {{peculiar}} {{effects are}} best {{shown by the}} electro-magnet (1056.). When {{it was used to}} complete the communication at the electromotor, there was no sensible spark on making <b>contact,</b> but on <b>breaking</b> <b>contact</b> there was a very large and bright spark, with considerable combustion of the mercury. Then, again, with respect to the shock: if the hands were moistened in salt and water, and good contact between them and the wires retained, no shock could be felt upon making contact at the electromotor, but a powerful one on <b>breaking</b> <b>contact.</b>|$|R
50|$|Each {{of these}} {{variations}} {{is called for}} to address specific weaknesses in a lifter's overall deadlift. For instance if the athlete has difficulty <b>breaking</b> <b>contact</b> at max. weight, deficit deadlifts are performed to strengthen the gluteus maximus and hamstrings due to the greater range of motion required by standing on the low platform or low box. On the other hand, if the lifter has no problem with <b>breaking</b> <b>contact</b> with the floor but has difficulty locking out, they should perform rack pulls to strengthen their upper back, posterior deltoids, and trapezius muscles while de-emphasizing the gluteus and hamstrings.|$|R
5|$|The {{location}} of micronuclei or where bubbles initially form is not known. The most likely mechanisms for bubble formation are tribonucleation, when two surfaces make and <b>break</b> <b>contact</b> (such as in joints), and heterogeneous nucleation, where bubbles are created {{at a site}} based on a surface {{in contact with the}} liquid. Homogeneous nucleation, where bubbles form within the liquid itself is less likely because it requires much greater pressure differences than experienced in decompression. The spontaneous formation of nanobubbles on hydrophobic surfaces is a possible source of micronuclei, but it is not yet clear if these can grow large enough to cause symptoms as they are very stable.|$|E
5|$|After {{reaching}} Lawrence, {{the guerrillas}} immediately killed {{a number of}} Union Army recruits and one of Anderson's men took their flag. The Provost Marshal of Kansas, a Union captain who commanded military police, surrendered to the guerrillas and Anderson took his uniform. (Guerrillas often wore uniforms stolen from Union soldiers.) They proceeded to pillage and burn many buildings, killing almost every man they found, but {{taking care not to}} shoot women. Anderson personally killed 14 people. Although some men begged him to spare them, he persisted, but he relented when a woman pleaded with him not to torch her house. The guerrillas under Anderson's command, notably including Archie Clement and Frank James, killed more {{than any of the other}} group. They left town at 9a.m., after a company of Union soldiers approached the town. The raiding party was pursued by Union forces, but eventually managed to <b>break</b> <b>contact</b> with the soldiers and scatter into the Missouri woods. After a dead raider was scalped by a Union-allied Lenape Indian during the pursuit, one guerrilla leader pledged to adopt the practice of scalping.|$|E
5|$|As {{tensions}} in Europe {{rose in the}} aftermath of the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria, Looff decided to abandon the normal peacetime training schedule and returned to Dar es Salaam on 24 July to replenish his coal and other stores. He also made efforts to organize a coast watcher network to report enemy ships and to protect German shipping in the area. On 27 July, Looff received a message from the Admiralstab (Admiralty Staff) informing him of the worsening political situation in Europe. Concurrently, the cruisers of the British Cape Squadron, , , and , arrived with the intention of bottling up Königsberg at the colony's capital Dar es Salaam. Looff got his ship ready to sail and left port on the afternoon of 31 July 1914, with the three slower British ships shadowing him. Looff used a rain squall and his ship's superior speed to <b>break</b> <b>contact</b> with his British pursuers the following day. Königsberg steamed off Aden until 5 August, when word of the outbreak of hostilities between Britain and Germany belatedly reached the ship.|$|E
6000|$|... 1104. On {{adjusting}} a platina wire at x (1081.) so that {{it should}} not be ignited by the current passing through it whilst contact at G and E was continued, and yet become red-hot by a current somewhat more powerful, I was readily able to produce its ignition upon making contact, and again upon <b>breaking</b> <b>contact.</b> Thus the momentary retardation in ABD on making contact was again shown by this result, as well also as the opposite result upon <b>breaking</b> <b>contact.</b> The two ignitions of the wire at x were of course produced by electric currents moving in opposite directions.|$|R

6000|$|... 1068. The {{effect of}} {{elongation}} was well shown thus: 114 feet of copper wire, one-eighteenth {{of an inch}} in diameter, were extended {{on the floor and}} used as a conductor; it remained cold, but gave a bright spark on <b>breaking</b> <b>contact.</b> Being crossed so that the two terminations were in contact near the extremities, it was again used as a conductor, only twelve inches now being included in the circuit: the wire became very hot from the greater quantity of electricity passing through it, and yet the spark on <b>breaking</b> <b>contact</b> was scarcely visible. The experiment was repeated with a wire one-ninth of an inch in diameter and thirty-six feet long with the same results.|$|R
5|$|At 00:25, Kondo {{ordered all}} of his ships that were able to {{converge}} and destroy any remaining U.S.ships. However, the Japanese ships still {{did not know where}} Washington was located, and the other surviving U.S.ships had already departed the battle area. Washington steered a northwesterly course toward the Russell Islands to draw the Japanese force away from Guadalcanal and the presumably damaged South Dakota. The Imperial ships finally sighted Washington and launched several torpedo attacks, but by the skilled seamanship of her captain she avoided all of them and also avoided running aground in shallow waters. At length, believing that the way was clear for the transport convoy to proceed to Guadalcanal (but apparently disregarding the threat of air attack in the morning), Kondo ordered his remaining ships to <b>break</b> <b>contact</b> and retire from the area about 01:04, which most of the Japanese warships complied with by 01:30.|$|E
5|$|Fighting raged {{throughout}} {{the early morning}} as 'B' Company vainly attempted to assist the cut-off 'D' Company. Varley decided to launch a counterattack with 'A' Company, but at 8:00am the order to withdraw came from brigade headquarters, cancelling the attack. Covered by the reserve company, 'A' and some of 'B' Company were able to <b>break</b> <b>contact</b> and fall back. 'D' Company, {{along with those of}} 'B' Company that were still isolated and in contact, had to be left to fight their way back to the battalion's lines. By the time they arrived, there were only enough men left to form one platoon. The 2/18th's losses in this action amounted to about 90 men killed, wounded or missing. Japanese losses are unknown, but are thought to be significant and they were unable to take Jemaluang for two more days.|$|E
5|$|Finally, by 19:00 B Company {{was able}} <b>break</b> <b>contact</b> and withdrew after a five-hour battle, {{moving into a}} night harbour near the landing zone with the {{remainder}} of the battalion. Mortars, artillery fire and airstrikes covered the Australian withdrawal, and then proceeded to pound the battlefield into the evening. After a tense night the Australians returned the next morning only to find that the Viet Cong had left the area during the night, successfully avoiding a large blocking force while dragging most of their dead and wounded with them. A hard fought affair at close range, the Viet Cong had lost heavily during the fighting, yet the disciplined force had matched the Australians as both sides stood their ground, inflicting numerous casualties on the other before each fell back. Although 6 RAR had ultimately prevailed, if only by default, the vicious fighting at Ap My An was probably the closest that the Australian Army came to defeat in a major battle during the war.|$|E
40|$|The {{existence}} of baryon-baryon bound {{states in the}} strangeness sector is examined {{in the framework of}} SU(3) chiral effective field theory. Specifically, the role of SU(3) symmetry <b>breaking</b> <b>contact</b> terms that arise at next-to-leading order in the employed Weinberg power counting scheme is explored. We focus on the 1 S 0 partial wave and on baryon-baryon channels with maximal isospin since in this case there are only two independent SU(3) symmetry <b>breaking</b> <b>contact</b> terms. At the same time, those are the channels where most of the bound states have been predicted in the past. Utilizing pp phase shifts and Σ + p cross section data allows us to pin down one of the SU(3) symmetry <b>breaking</b> <b>contact</b> terms and a clear indication for the decrease of attraction when going from the NN system to strangeness S = − 2 is found, which rules out a bound state for ΣΣ with isospin I = 2. Assuming that the trend observed for S = 0 to S = − 2 is not reversed when going to ΞΣ and ΞΞ makes also bound states in those systems rather unlikely...|$|R

5|$|Later that {{afternoon}} Allen decided to <b>break</b> <b>contact</b> {{and return to}} base, to avoid fighting a battle that could last until the evening. In the meantime, however, he called in air-strikes to inflict further damage on the base camp of his primary target, the 271st Regiment. That evening Brigadier General William Coleman and other senior officers of the 1st Infantry Division visited the 2nd Battalion's camp, where they praised Allen's men for their efforts, and presented First Lieutenant Clark Welch—commander of Delta Company—with a Silver Star for his actions earlier in the day. Allen then decided to launch a full-frontal attack against the 271st Regiment's base camp, {{to determine if the}} enemy unit was still there. However, {{due to the lack of}} sufficient manpower, Welch suggested that Allen should either call off the assault or get more soldiers on the ground for the operation. Allen dismissed Welch's suggestions, and responded by giving Captain James George—commander of Alpha Company—the responsibility of leading the attack instead of Welch.|$|E
5|$|To <b>break</b> <b>contact</b> {{with the}} Viet Cong units which fired on Alpha Company {{from the western}} flank, First Sergeant Jose Valdez quickly {{organized}} an assembly area {{on the eastern side}} to round up the survivors. Shortly after the assembly area was established George, who was severely wounded from the Claymore explosion, turned his company over to Valdez. Allen then ordered Valdez to lead the survivors of Alpha Company northward to join the rest of the battalion. The survivors, mostly from the 2nd and 3rd Platoons of Alpha Company, were then ordered to withdraw through a perimeter formed by Delta Company. As the surviving elements of Alpha Company pulled back, Delta Company began to receive sporadic fire from their southern flank, so Allen ordered his command group to remain in place near a prominent anthill with the 1st and 2nd Platoons of Delta Company. The 3rd Platoon, on the other hand, was instructed to move forward to assist the wounded men from Alpha Company.|$|E
5|$|Finally, by 19:00 B Company {{was able}} <b>break</b> <b>contact</b> and withdrew after a five-hour battle. Both sides then fell {{back as the}} Viet Cong also dispersed, {{evacuating}} most of their dead and wounded. Meanwhile, under covering fire from the APCs of 2 Troop, B Company boarded the remaining carriers, moving into a night harbour near the landing zone with {{the remainder of the}} battalion at 19:25, as the last of their casualties were extracted by helicopter. Mortars, artillery fire and airstrikes covered the Australian withdrawal, and then proceeded to pound the abandoned battlefield into the evening. That night the body of the dead APC driver was evacuated by helicopter, as American AC-47 Spooky gunships circled overhead, dropping flares to illuminate the battlefield and strafing likely Viet Cong positions, while F-4 Phantoms dropped napalm. The airstrikes then continued in preparation for a further assault by the Australians planned for the following day. Otherwise there was no further fighting that night, and both sides remained unmolested. Ultimately no attack was made against the Australian base at Nui Dat that night either, while no unusual activity was reported in the area.|$|E
6000|$|... 1061. When the helix i or iii (1053, &c.) {{was used}} as the {{connecting}} conductor, there was also a good spark on <b>breaking</b> <b>contact,</b> but none (sensibly) on making contact. On trying to obtain the shock from these helices, I could not succeed at first. By joining the similar ends of i and ii so as to make the two helices equivalent to one helix, having wire of double thickness, I could just obtain the sensation. Using the helix of thick wire (1055.) the shock was distinctly obtained. On placing the tongue between two plates of silver connected by wires with the parts which the hands had heretofore touched (1064.), there was a powerful shock on <b>breaking</b> <b>contact,</b> but none on making contact.|$|R

40|$|Summary. The {{procedure}} {{described here}} involves training an animal to make steady {{contact with a}} reward spout {{in order to receive}} food or water and then pairing a stimulus with mild electric shock delivered through the spout. The animal quickly learns to avoid the shock by <b>breaking</b> <b>contact</b> with the spout whenever it detects the stimulus. The <b>breaking</b> of <b>contact</b> with the spout is then used to indicate that the animal detected the stimulus. This procedure can be used to assess sensory and perceptual abilities {{in a wide variety of}} animals. ...|$|R
5|$|Pushing {{their way}} across the Bunga and Buiem Rivers, the 2/23rd fanned out through Apo village while {{maintaining}} contact with the 2/17th Infantry Battalion by signal cable. Around the Burep River, the 2/23rd was held up by the terrain and as a result the commander decided to halt and form a battalion defensive position. A platoon under Sergeant Don Lawrie was pushed forward near the mouth of the river as a protection measure to provide early warning. On 6 September, a company of Japanese attacked the 2/23rd's main defensive position south of the Singaua Plantation on the western side of the Buiem River, alongside a company from the 2/24th Battalion. Having been alerted by Lawrie's platoon who had sent back two runners, the battalion was able to repel the attack, although numerous casualties were inflicted on the 2/23rd and the 2/17th by Japanese mortars. The Japanese company, numbering about 60 men, subsequently fell back towards Lawrie's platoon near the Bunga. Positioned on the Japanese line of retreat, the Australian platoon was subjected to six attacks. These were fended off {{over the course of the}} afternoon, and by evening, as heavy rain began to fall, the Australian platoon was able to <b>break</b> <b>contact</b> and withdraw back to the 2/23rd's main defensive position.|$|E
5|$|Command of A Company was {{temporarily}} {{handed over to}} the second-in-command, Captain Bob Murdoch. Present at Pakchon in November 1950, O'Dowd understood first-hand the dangers of withdrawing while in contact. The challenge was to protect the forward platoons as they withdrew from being followed up by the Chinese occupying the old B Company positions and from D Company's position after they broke contact. The Australians would also have to clear the withdrawal route of any blocking forces, {{while at the same time}} the evacuation of a large number of wounded and Chinese prisoners would hamper their movement. As such the timing of the withdrawal would be critical to its success. Consequently, the lead company would not move until mid-afternoon so that the rearguard would be able to use the protection of darkness to <b>break</b> <b>contact,</b> while at the same time offering good observation and fields of fire during the daylight to support the initial moves. Orders were delivered at 14:30. B Company would lead the withdrawal down the ridge line, carrying any wounded that still required evacuation, as well as clearing the route and securing the ford near the Middlesex position. C Company would wait for the artillery to neutralise the Chinese on the old B Company position, before moving to establish a blocking position behind D Company. A Company would then withdraw to a blocking position behind C Company, in order to allow Gravener and Saunders to establish a clean break. Finally, D Company would withdraw through both C and A Company and set up a blocking position to delay any follow up and allow those companies to withdraw.|$|E
5|$|Probes {{began on}} the A and B Company positions, {{and a number of}} assaults {{occurred}} during the night. Utilising indirect fires, the Chinese charged forward in waves, only to be beaten back by the Australians' Bren light machine-guns, Owen submachine-guns, rifle fire and grenades, before again regrouping and attacking again. B Company—under the command of Captain Darcy Laughlin—supported by tanks, drove off each assault, inflicting heavy casualties while emerging almost unscathed. Laughlin's command post was fired upon by a number of Chinese that had infiltrated the company position, but they were swiftly driven out. An outpost on the northern knoll reported Chinese massing on their flanks at 23:00, and although heavy artillery was directed against the attackers, the section was forced to <b>break</b> <b>contact</b> and withdraw to the main defensive position. The main Chinese assault began at 00:50, falling on 4 Platoon but was broken up after an hour of heavy fighting. A second assault was mounted on 6 Platoon at 03:30, following a feint against 5 Platoon. With determination the Chinese swept forward, penetrating the Australian perimeter before being ejected by an equally determined counter-attack by 6 Platoon with Sherman tanks in support. At 04:00 a small outpost {{to the rear of the}} company position was attacked by more than 50 Chinese. Held by just four men under the command of Lance Corporal Ray Parry, the Australians fought off four separate attacks, killing more than 25 and wounding many more over the space of twenty minutes. Parry was later awarded the Military Medal for his actions. A final assault on B Company was made just on dawn at 04:45 by about 70 Chinese, and was again repulsed.|$|E
50|$|On {{the morning}} of 6 August after preparatory air and {{artillery}} strikes, helicopters from MAG-16 and MAG-36 began ferrying the Vietnamese and U.S. Marines to their landing zones.

5|$|Townsend {{subsequently}} then {{reported that}} he was facing a force of at least battalion-strength with support weapons—likely D445 Battalion—while the level of proficiency indicated that it might also include North Vietnamese Army (NVA) elements. However, due to earlier warnings that the Viet Cong were preparing to attack Nui Dat that evening, {{prior to the start}} of the operation Graham had ordered Townsend to return to base that afternoon, and this restriction remained extant. Likewise, with Operation Renmark scheduled to start the following morning, A Company 5 RAR—then at Dat Do protecting the artillery—would also need to be released before nightfall, adding to the requirement to conclude the operation that afternoon. Regardless, this restriction had only served to make B Company's task all the more difficult, with Mackay facing demands to complete the action while at the same time not become decisively engaged and unable to withdraw his company. At 16:17 Townsend was ordered to prepare his battalion for a helicopter extraction which was due to begin an hour later, while at 17:15 he was ordered to <b>break</b> <b>contact</b> immediately, however this proved impossible as 5 Platoon remained in heavy contact. Mackay now estimated that he would be unable to get forward to support the beleaguered platoon for a further 30 minutes; however, by 17:50 he realised that the Viet Cong had moved between them and A Company. Yet even while the Viet Cong continued to heavily engage both A and B Companies, the remainder of the Australian battalion and the APCs were beginning to line up on the landing zone in preparation for returning to Nui Dat. The order was finally rescinded when it became clear that both companies were unable to break-off the engagement. Meanwhile, a number of bush fires were now burning through the area, detonating discarded ammunition and adding to the noise of the battle.|$|E
25|$|Key Hole patrols were {{designed}} purely around reconnaissance and surveillance; usually lightly equipped and armed with defensive weapons—evasive techniques {{were employed to}} <b>break</b> <b>contact</b> from the enemy should the need arise, avoiding contact with the enemy was paramount.
