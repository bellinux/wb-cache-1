Four paints were tested, three of which contained copper or tin as their toxic ingredient and one which used a chlorinated pesticide, an organic compound, as the anti-fouling ingredient. Samples removed at regular intervals, of days up to several weeks, showed that bacterial slimes populated the glass and heavy-metal based paints early and in great numbers throughout the study, but the surfaces painted with the organic compound toxicant were free of all microfouling organisms.

40|$|Scallop {{aquaculture}} in Chile {{suffers from}} intense fouling on culture facilities by invasive {{species such as}} the ascidian Ciona intestinalis and the bryozoan Bugula neritina. We examined the grazing effect of the rock shrimp Rhynchocinetes typus on fouling species, which colonize scallop pearl nets. We placed different densities of shrimp (0, 2, 5 and 10 individuals) in pearl nets with juvenile scallops (mean shell height 4. 9  cm) at Tongoy Bay in northern-central Chile. We sampled the nets after 4  months (January-May 2007) and recovered 35 - 50 % of the shrimp from the different treatments. The nets with 10 initial shrimp had a lower cover of the bryozoan B. neritina and lower densities of the ascidians C. intestinalis and Pyura chilensis, {{which resulted in a}} 50 % decrease in biomass of fouling on nets. Low scallop mortality and slightly higher (yet not significant) growth in treatments with high shrimp densities suggest a positive interaction between the shrimp and scallops.

30|$|Though the algal diet {{preference}} of T. niloticus is {{not within the}} scope of this study, it is worthy to mention that in the congeneric Trochus maculatus, filamentous/turf-forming algae is preferred over corticated and foliose algae (Ng et al. 2013). This previous observation is consistent with the findings of the present study as the cover of turf, but not corticated and foliose, algae was significantly lower in rubble pieces exposed to trochus (at two per cage density) than that in the control. In both culture systems (hatchery and in situ nursery), turf algae covered most of the rubble substrate in the control cages. Considering the type of macroalgae expected to foul a particular culture system and incorporating the dietary habit and consumption rate of grazers (Ng et al. 2013), the effectiveness of <b>biological</b> control of <b>fouling</b> macroalgae in mariculture can be considerably enhanced. Furthermore, {{it has been suggested that}} the dietary habit of grazers would have shaped the fouling assemblage in mariculture (Ng et al. 2013). In the present study, the decrease in turf algal cover due to trochus grazing corresponded to an increase in the cover of barren surfaces but not in the cover of other (non-turf) algal forms. The unavailability of propagules or sub-optimal growth of the other algal forms in the culture systems during the experimental period can possibly provide explanation to this observation.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} fouling of a {{microfiltration}} membrane by <b>biological</b> solutions. Membrane <b>fouling</b> {{is recognized as}} a major drawback {{for the application of}} microfiltration in the purification of biotechnology products. Membrane fouling was analyzed and compared for filtrations performed with a hollow fiber microfiltration module operated at constant permeate flux using bovine serum albumin (BSA) solutions or Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell culture broths as feed solutions. A mechanistic model was developed to represent the fouling of a cross-flow microfiltration membrane operated at constant permeate flux. Fouling was observed as an increase in the transmembrane pressure (TMP) and assumed to occur first by pore blockage followed by cake formation over the blocked pores. The effect of the cross-flow action was described by the removal of deposits from the membrane surface thereby reducing the pore blockage and the mass of the cake. The model was fitted to the TMP profiles obtained during the filtration of BSA solutions and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell culture broths with a 0. 45 µm polysulfone hollow fiber membrane. According to the fitted model, pores blocked faster and more cake was formed with increasing BSA concentration. In the case of CHO cell culture broth, increasing the wall shear rate (proportional to cross-flow velocity) seemed to lead to the formation of a less pronounced cake but more pore blockage. The cross-flow mechanistic model was applied to the microfiltration of CHO cell culture supernatants harvested at different days of the fermentation process. The filtrations were performed at two different shear rates and with two different membrane pore sizes. The cell culture supernatant caused membrane fouling observed as an increase in both the TMP and the membrane hydraulic resistance estimated from water flux measurements {{at the end of the}} filtrations. The highest TMP increase was observed for the filtrations with the smaller membrane pore size (0. 2 µm) and the higher shear rate (8000 s- 1). The hydraulic resistance estimates of the fouled membrane also revealed a higher irreversible fouling for the smaller (0. 2 µm) membrane pore size while the model analysis indicates that more fouling occurred at the entrance of the membrane pores. The shear rate was found to strongly influence the contribution of the reversible fouling to the total hydraulic resistance of the membrane. The cross-flow mechanistic model indicates a higher pore blockage for the most severe membrane fouling observed experimentally for the smaller membrane pore size and the higher shear rate. At the same time, a smaller cake deposit was predicted for the higher shear rate. The different cell culture harvest time investigated in this study did not reveal any differences in membrane fouling. BSA solutions were used to evaluate the contribution of BSA aggregates, fresh cell culture medium and the non-ionic surfactant Pluronic F- 68 to membrane fouling. A simple empirical model was developed to represent the TMP increase and to derive the initial fouling rate. The initial fouling rate, the normalized TMP and the irreversible membrane resistance at the end of the filtration were analyzed to determine the effect of BSA solution characteristics on membrane fouling. The initial fouling rate increased with increasing BSA aggregate content consistent with a two-step fouling mechanism that was proposed for membrane fouling by BSA. Increased BSA concentration and the use of fresh cell culture medium compared to potassium phosphate buffer resulted in an increase in initial fouling rate, TMP and irreversible membrane fouling. The addition of the non-ionic surfactant Pluronic-F 68 to the BSA solutions decreased the long-term fouling and the irreversible fouling but did not affect the initial fouling rate...|$|R
40|$|There is {{high demand}} for {{next-generation}} biomolecule detection platforms arising from clinical {{need for more}} robust point-of-care diagnosis systems, fundamental research need to characterize complex biological processes, {{and the emergence of}} personalized medicine. These detection systems should accordingly provide multiplexed, sensitive, and highly specific quantification of biomarkers from several types of biological fluids. Hydrogels, which are loosely crosslinked networks of polymer chains, are particularly favorable substrates for robust detection of clinical analytes due to their non-fouling properties, ability to immobilize high concentrations of probe molecules, and solution-like environment which often leads to lower free energies of target-probe binding relative to solid surfaces. In this thesis, a novel array of microfluidic gel-based diagnostic tools is created for interrogation of proteins and microRNAs (miRNAs) from a range of biologically complex samples. To this end, we developed two distinct systems that are each applicable in different clinical contexts and both make use of microfluidic photolithographic approaches: (1) well-mixed hydrogel particle arrays for high-throughput and multiplexed quantification of proteins from cell culture, serum, and tissue lysates, and (2) channel-immobilized hydrogel posts for high-sensitive and multiplexed detection of microRNAs in an entirely on-chip format. Graphically-encoded polyethylene glycol (PEG) hydrogel microparticles bearing distinct coding regions and probe regions have previously demonstrated superior detection properties relative to surface-based bead arrays or microarrays for detection of short nucleic acids such as microRNAs. They have also been interfaced with a custom microfluidic highthroughput scanner for real-time post-assay analysis. Now, this platform is extended to multiplexed endogenous protein detection using both aptamer and antibodies to capture and label targets. Through our development and optimization, gel particles could be suspended into several types of unprocessed <b>biological</b> media without <b>fouling</b> or losing detection capability and demonstrated sensitivities that are comparable to commercial standards without needing amplification. In particular, aptamer-based protein detection using gel particles was found to provide up to three orders of magnitude better sensitivity than competing platforms using the hydrated and flexible gel particles also without using signal amplification. The chemical and thermodynamically favorable properties of the gel scaffold were also exploited to engineer an entirely on-chip assay that could have applications in clinical settings. Probe-containing porosity-tuned PEG posts were immobilized into microfluidic channels using a spatial encoding scheme. We developed a novel enzymatic amplification scheme that made use of the unique properties of a laminar two-phase flow around a gel post in a channel to completely isolate the gel posts within a fluorinated oil phase without needing surfactants. These confined gel chambers could then be used to dramatically concentrate products from an enzymatic amplification reaction leading to large (up to 57 -fold) increase in sensitivity relative to direct labeling. The platform was integrated with an existing scheme for multiplexed miRNA detection from low amounts (10 - 50 ng) of total RNA inputs to enable entirely on-chip detection that shows great promise for eventual clinical integration to measure these biomarkers for disease diagnosis. Together, the advances reported here have significantly furthered both gel particle arrays and immobilized hydrogel posts as platforms that could eventually be integrated into clinical and research settings for robust biomolecule quantification. by Rathi Lakshmi Srinivas.

Chlorination is an effective antibiofouler, but has negative environmental impacts and does not meet federal and state regulations. Biofouling of heat exchangers and piping systems in heat transfer equipment is a major problem in Navy ships and submarines, commercial vessels, as well as land-based cooling systems (e. g. hydroelectric plants, locks, dams, etc.). Biofouling inhibits heat transfer and plugs system components. The primary biofouling control technique is chlorination, which is effective but has negative environmental impacts. For example, some byproducts generated by chlorination are carcinogenic. Consequently, regulatory actions both are in place and under consideration that limit the use of chlorination.

The results showed that the using ozonation in the first unit was efficient to prevent the foul taste and odors in permeate water...|$|E
40|$|Widespread use of {{acoustic}} {{instruments to}} measure current velocity {{has led to}} interest in the technique of using acoustic sensors to estimate suspended solids concentration (SSC) from acoustic backscatter intensity (ABS). These measurements are non-intrusive, much less susceptible to <b>biological</b> <b>fouling</b> than are measurements from optical instruments, and provide time series of ABS (profile) for improved temporal resolution of SSC estimates. Successful estimates of SSC from ABS provides promise that this technique might be appropriate and useful for determining SSC from commercially available instruments such as acoustic Doppler current profilers (ADCPs). In spite of significant advantages to the method, users {{must be aware of}} important limitations to the technique Introduction: The transport, deposition, and suspension of sediments in rivers, estuaries, and bays are of critical importance to understanding overall condition and health of these complex systems. Sediments carry nutrients and potentially toxic materials; transport of sediments is the mechanism to re-distribute these materials within the system. High concentration of suspended materials may limit light transmission and thus inhibit photosynthesis. In addition, deposition of suspended sediments in shipping channels requires periodic dredging to maintain navigabl...|$|E
