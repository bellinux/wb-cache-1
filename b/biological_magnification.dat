The concept of <b>biological</b> <b>magnification</b> controlled by mass transfers of residues through food chains is questioned because predatory fish like cod contained similar or even lower residue levels than organisms of a lower trophic levellike the peacock worm.

They will be assimilated into the blood stream and have direct or indirect impact on their physiological performance.

These compounds can mainly interfere with the aquatic populations through disturbance in hormonal performance especially sexual hormones.

40|$|Recent {{studies on}} {{potential}} mercury (Hg) contamination of fish from East Texas lakes and waterways have caused concern about mercury levels in East Texas waters. Historical records of Hg concentrations in 33 East Texas streams showed that median concentrations for each stream segment were {{no different than}} other U. S. streams. All the means and medians for stream segments having at least 20 recorded measurements were less than Texas (2. 4 µg/L) water quality standards. Water samples collected in December 1995 and March 1996 from 6 different stream sites in Nacogdoches County had concentrations similar to historical records. Due to <b>biological</b> <b>magnification,</b> fish Hg levels can be 20, 000 times greater than water Hg levels and levels are greater in large fish than in small fish. Although a recent study on sediment cores in 13 East Texas reservoirs and lakes suggested possible increases in mercury concentrations across the region, all Hg concentrations in water and sediment were far below Texas acute and chronic quality standards. No significant correlations were found between fish mercury concentrations and mercury concentrations in water or sediment. Potential agricultural inputs of Hg in East Texas are very low; the most likely source of Hg is atmospheric deposition from fossil fuel combustion and other industrial practices.

The application of synthetic insecticides causes development of resistance, <b>biological</b> <b>magnification</b> {{of toxic substances}} through the food chain, and adverse effects {{on the environment and}} human health. In this scenario, eco-friendly control tools of mosquito vectors are a priority. Here single-step fabrication of silver nanoparticles (AgNP) using a cheap aqueous leaf extract of Zornia diphylla as reducing and capping agent pf Ag+ ions has been carried out. Biosynthesized AgNP were characterized by UV-visible spectrophotometry, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDX) and X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD). The acute toxicity of Z. diphylla leaf extract and biosynthesized AgNP was evaluated against larvae of the malaria vector Anopheles subpictus, the dengue vector Aedes albopictus and the Japanese encephalitis vector Culex tritaeniorhynchus. Both the Z. diphylla leaf extract and Ag NP showed dose dependent larvicidal effect against all tested mosquito species. Compared to the leaf aqueous extract, biosynthesized Ag NP showed higher toxicity against An. subpictus, Ae. albopictus, and Cx. tritaeniorhynchus with LC 50 values of 12. 53, 13. 42 and 14. 61 μg/ml, respectively. Biosynthesized Ag NP were found safer to non-Target organisms Chironomus circumdatus, Anisops bouvieri and Gambusia affinis, with the respective LC 50 values ranging from 613. 11 to 6903. 93 μg/ml, if compared to target mosquitoes. Overall, our results highlight that Z. diphylla-fabricated Ag NP are a promising and eco-friendly tool against larval populations of mosquito vectors of medical and veterinary importance, with negligible toxicity against other non-Target organisms...|$|E
40|$|Harmful algal blooms {{can cause}} mass mortalities of top predators such as fish, marine mammals and seabirds {{but the food}} web {{transfer}} from toxic phytoplankton to these organisms has not been fully elucidated. Macrobenthic invertebrates in coastal waters, including bivalve suspension- and deposit-feeders, carnivorous gastropods, deposit-feeding amphipods and polychaetes, are a major food source {{for a wide variety}} of predators and can thus play a critical role in the trophic transfer of algal toxins to higher trophic levels. The objective of this study was to investigate toxin accumulation in transplanted juvenile hard clams, Mercenaria mercenaria, a species naturally occurring in the region, and in various macrobenthic functional groups from Florida coastal waters during a natural bloom of the dinoflagellate, Karenia brevis, a producer of brevetoxins. Bloom concentrations in the water column ranged from 100 to 1200 cells ml 2 ̆ 2129 over the course of the experiment. This study revealed that these lipophilic toxins can be rapidly accumulated by both suspension- and deposit-feeding benthos, especially bivalve molluscs [1. 92 ̆ 0132. 8 3 ̆bcg PbTx- 3 eq (g wet weight) 2 ̆ 2129]. Transplanted M. mercenaria rapidly accumulated toxins from the water column attaining 2 ̆ 23 c 0. 5 3 ̆bcg PbTx- 3 eq (g wet tissue) 2 ̆ 2129 after only 4 h-exposure to the K. brevis bloom and a maximum value of 1. 5 1 0. 2 3 ̆bcg PbTx- 3 eq (g wet tissue) 2 ̆ 2129 after 72 h. Relatively high brevetoxin concentrations were also measured in co-occurring benthic carnivorous gastropods [12 ̆ 0132. 6 3 ̆bcg PbTx- 3 eq (g wet weight, WW) 2 ̆ 2129]. Mean toxin concentrations in polychaetes and crustaceans varied in the range 2 ̆ 23 c 0. 042 ̆ 0130. 2 3 ̆bcg PbTx- 3 eq (g WW) 2 ̆ 2129 over the study period, and thus were typically lower than in molluscs. This study demonstrated in situ toxin accumulation by benthic primary and secondary consumers during a natural Florida red tide. Accumulation by primary consumers may be highly variable in space and time (as shown in bivalves from the natural benthic community) and among taxonomic groups. Toxin transfer further up the food web will thus depend on the toxin level accumulated in prey, the number of pathways from which the predator may accumulate toxins and on possible <b>biological</b> <b>magnification</b> of lipophilic toxins. Overall, this study revealed qualitatively and quantitatively that benthic consumers of a number of taxa can serve as vectors for transporting brevetoxins within the food web.

40|$|Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCB 2 ̆ 7 s) are {{organochlorine}} molecules which find various {{industrial and}} product applications. PCB 2 ̆ 7 s are {{of concern to}} biologists because they are toxic substances which have become global contaminants. They are also of concern to biologists and analytical chemists because they interfere with the determination of some organochlorine pesticide residues. PCB 2 ̆ 7 s were discovered to be environmental contaminants after they showed up as unidentified peaks in pesticide analysis using gas-liquid chromatography with an electron capture detector (GLC-EC). In the present experiment standard GLC-EC techniques were used to assay PCB 2 ̆ 7 s in Daphnia experimentally contaminated in the laboratory and in crayfish from the Willamette River. Daphnia were placed in water containing 0. 1, 4, 50 or 100 parts per billion (ppb) PCB for 4 to 72 hours. There was no mortality {{in any of the}} experiments. The individual PCB compounds were apparently taken up equally, since relative peak heights were similar in the standard and the residues extracted from Daphnia. Final concentrations of PCB 2 ̆ 7 s in Daphnis ranged from 1200 times that of the water (at water concentrations of 100 ppb) to 104, 000 times that of water (at water concentrations of 0. 1 ppb). The lower concentrations used here approximate environmental PCB levels found in some areas of the U. S. and elsewhere. Assuming that chronic exposure to these lower concentrations would not strongly inhibit growth or reproduction of Daphnia,, the high <b>biological</b> <b>magnification</b> found here would suggest that Daphnia and related organisms may {{play an important role in}} the accumulation of PCB 2 ̆ 7 s in fresh water food webs. Digestive glands of crayfish taken from the Willamette River were analyzed for PCB 2 ̆ 7 s. Statistically significant regional differences were found in the concentrations of PCB 2 ̆ 7 s in these organisms in the lower Willamette Valley. Crayfish from the center of Portland have the highest residues (7 to 9 parts per million). A similar distribution has been previously reported for other urban areas. In the present investigation, however, the highest residues occurred in crayfish from the river at a point approximately in the center of the city itself, but two miles upstream from the major industrial areas. Thus, in this case, the major source of environmental contamination may have been released from manufactured goods (e. g., automobile tires, paints, etc.) rather than from industrial sewerage. ...|$|E
