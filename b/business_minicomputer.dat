50|$|Early in 1976 ICL {{acquired}} the international (that is, non-US) part of Singer Business Machines. The Singer group, a holding company which had diversified by adding many divisions, {{the most well-known}} of which was its early roots in sewing machines, and others such as the Business Machine division which was acquired by purchasing Friden, a San Leandro computer company, whose flagship product was the System Ten, a small <b>business</b> <b>minicomputer.</b> SBM had also acquired Cogar Corporation, a manufacturer of desktop intelligent terminals in Utica, New York, which after the ICL acquisition became the development and manufacturing plant for both minicomputers and terminals. The acquisition shifted the geographical balance of ICL's sales away from the UK, and also gave a presence in industry markets such as retail and manufacturing. ICL subsequently developed the System Ten into the System 25, and used the product to spearhead the growth of its Retail Systems business during the 1980s.|$|E
40|$|With {{the recent}} {{advances}} in computer technology, standalone <b>business</b> <b>minicomputer</b> systems have become as powerful as many large computers of a decade ago. Thus, it is now cost effective for facilities to obtain their own computers and software to perform all of the functions performed by the larger systems. This cost effectiveness applies especially to small or medium size hospitals or residential facilities whose data bases are not as large as those of larger facilities. Another advantage of a standalone system is its inherent flexibility. Applications and reports can be designed specifically for a given facility. Various features of a general application or report can be tailored to {{the specific needs of}} an individual institution. This paper describes such an integrated package of hardware and software designed {{to meet the needs of}} the health care administrator...|$|E
50|$|Basic/Four Corporation {{was created}} as a {{subsidiary}} of Management Assistance, Inc. in Irvine, California. Basic/Four sold small <b>business</b> <b>minicomputers</b> that were assembled from Microdata Corporation CPUs.|$|R
50|$|Its {{development}} {{led directly}} to the Whirlwind II design {{used as the basis}} for the United States Air Force SAGE air defense system, and indirectly to almost all <b>business</b> computers and <b>minicomputers</b> in the 1960s.|$|R
50|$|Yanai joined EMC Corporation in 1987, {{and managed}} the Symmetrix development, {{software}} and hardware, {{from its inception}} in the late 1980s until shortly before leaving EMC in 2001. His development team grew from several people, recruited among his former Israeli colleagues, to thousands, while he was vice president. EMC grew in the 1990s, both in size and value, from a company with a fading <b>business</b> of (<b>minicomputer)</b> computer memory boards, valued in several millions of dollars, to a hundreds-of-billions company. Before leaving he became an EMC Fellow.|$|R
50|$|In 1963, he {{was invited}} by Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard to become the {{administrative}} head of the research department at Hewlett-Packard. He was the first general manager of HP's computer divisions, credited with helping shepherd HP's entry into the <b>minicomputer</b> <b>business.</b> During the 1960s, he also started University Laboratories, which was later merged into Spectra-Physics.|$|R
50|$|Business Basic is a {{category}} of variants of the BASIC computer programming language which were specialised for <b>business</b> use on <b>minicomputers</b> in the 1970s and 1980s. Business Basics added indexed file access methods to the normal set of BASIC commands, and were optimised for other input/output access, especially display terminal control. The two major families of Business Basic are MAI Basic Four and Data General Business Basic. In addition the Point 4 company, which developed the IRIS operating system, had {{their own version of}} BASIC. The UniBASIC owned by Dynamic Concepts of Irvine is a derivative of the Point 4 BASIC.|$|R
50|$|By {{the mid-1990s}} {{the price of}} low-end PCs was rapidly falling to the under-$1000 price point. When {{equipped}} with a terminal emulator, these machines could perform all the functions of a DEC terminal, as well as running software locally. The terminal market began to crash, but remained important to DEC's core <b>minicomputer</b> <b>business.</b> DEC responded by introducing the VT500 series as simplified and lower-cost options. The VT510 was introduced in 1993 as an all-in-one unit like their previous designs, replacing DECs proprietary keyboards with a PS/2 port and adding standard RS-232 ports {{in addition to their}} proprietary MMJ serial ports. The 520 and 525 dispensed with the monitor as well, packaging the system into a pizza box case and working with a user-supplied monitor connected on an SVGA port.|$|R
5000|$|In 1984 IBM {{introduced}} the PC/AT, unlike its predecessor {{the most sophisticated}} personal computer from any major company. By 1985 the PC family had more than doubled Future Computing's 1986 revenue estimate, with more than 12,000 applications and 4,500 dealers and distributors worldwide. In his obituary that year, The New York Times wrote that Estridge had led the [...] "extraordinarily successful entry of the International Business Machines Corporation into the personal computer field". The Entry Systems Division had 10,000 employees and by itself {{would have been the}} world's third-largest computer company behind IBM and DEC, with more revenue than IBM's <b>minicomputer</b> <b>business</b> despite its much later start. IBM was the only major company with significant <b>minicomputer</b> and microcomputer <b>businesses,</b> in part because rivals like DEC and Wang did not adjust to the retail market.|$|R
50|$|The {{combination}} of the faster clock rate, fewer clock cycles per instruction, and the 16-bit bus led to a computer {{that was in the}} marketing sense too fast. IBM was protective of their lucrative mainframe and <b>minicomputer</b> <b>businesses</b> and consequently ran the original PC AT (139 version) at a very conservative 6 MHz with one wait state. They also used a three-to-one interleave on the hard disk, even though the controller supported two to one. Many customers replaced the 12 MHz crystal (which ran the processor at 6 MHz) with a 16 MHz crystal, so IBM introduced the PC AT 239 which would not boot the computer at any speed faster than 6 MHz, by adding a speed loop in the ROM. The final PC AT, the 339, ran the processor at 8 MHz with one wait state, and was built as IBM's flagship microcomputer until the 1987 introduction of the PS/2 line.|$|R
