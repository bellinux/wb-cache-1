5|$|Pan frying (or shallow frying) {{requires}} {{a frying pan}} of sturdy construction {{and a source of}} fat that does not fully immerse the chicken. The chicken pieces are prepared as above, then fried. Generally the fat is heated to a temperature hot enough to seal (without browning, at this point) the outside of the chicken pieces. Once the pieces {{have been added to the}} hot fat and sealed, the temperature is reduced. There is debate as to how often to turn the chicken pieces, with one camp arguing for often turning and even browning, and the other camp pushing for letting the pieces render skin side down and only turning when absolutely necessary. Once the chicken pieces are close to being done the temperature is raised and the pieces are browned to the desired color (some cooks add small amounts of butter at this point to enhance browning). The moisture from the chicken that sticks and browns on the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pan</b> become the fonds required to make gravy.|$|E
25|$|Brooks {{was said}} to prefer butter over clay as a molding medium. The latter had to kept moist and wrapped {{to prevent it from}} cracking, was not as {{sensitive}} for sculptural manipulation, and was more difficult to cast. Brooks had conquered the major disadvantage of butter simply by using ice. She discovered that she could even use butter for casting. After preserving her original butter Dreaming Iolanthe for a half a year, she desired a method which would not require keeping it in cold storage. Without knowing ahead of time what the results may be, she mixed up some plaster and poured it onto the butter sculpture. The plaster quickly set, and she cut a hole {{in the bottom of the}} milk pan which held her creation. Brooks then set the pan over a container of boiling water, and the butter melted and drained out of the hole. She removed the remainder of the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pan,</b> and was left with a greased plaster negative. She placed more plaster inside and, after some difficulty removing the outer layer, was left with a successful plaster positive. Brooks was issued a patent in 1877 for her process of creating lubricated plaster molds. She did not, however, use plaster casts to reproduce her butter sculptures, instead preferring to sculpt a new one for each exhibit.|$|E

Boogsie started to play steelpan at a young age when he was just four years old. He used to play with the Invaders, then he went to Starlift, the steelband with which Ray Holman was taking <b>the</b> revolutionary step <b>of</b> composing music specifically for the instrument. Boogsie wanted to continue what Ray Holman had started by starting his own steelband in 1972. Boogsie was not taught how to play steelpan, he just listened to the sounds on the street and taking part of jazz sessions on his steelpan with other musicians. Even though Boogsie can not read or write music his musical sense is very highly developed. [...] Here is a very nice description of one of Boogsie’s concerts from a Boogsie-watcher: [...] “With arrangements of high tenors, double-tenors and guitarpans, Boogsie led with Valentino’s Life Is a Stage, playing <b>the</b> different <b>pans</b> in a jazzy interpretation and using <b>the</b> pitch <b>of</b> each <b>pan</b> to highly dramatic effect. Then, he switched to Relator’s Gavaskar. <b>The</b> finely tuned <b>pans</b> answered his every call of musical expression — forte to pianissimo.But it was when Boogsie, member/arranger of Phase II Pan Groove, switched from Terror’s 'Pan Talent' to Kitchener’s 'Sweet Pan' that the capacity audience roared its acclaim <b>of</b> <b>the</b> versatility. More was yet to come. Next, Boogsie was playing <b>the</b> high tenor <b>pan</b> held upside down by an assistant. In other words, he was playing the tune on <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pan.</b> He then ventured into extemporaneous musical expressions that brought the crowd to its feet.For the finale, he sobered the crowd with an exhilarating performance of his own 1984 composition, 'I Music' — this time playing <b>the</b> <b>pans</b> from <b>the</b> front side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> instruments, rather than from behind <b>the</b> <b>pans</b> — <b>the</b> customary position. By <b>the</b> close <b>of</b> his half-hour performance, this superstar of second-generation panmen was as fresh as when he had started.” ...|$|R

6000|$|Five hours (and {{who can do}} it less in?) By haughty Celia {{spent in}} dressing; The goddess from her chamber issues, Array'd in lace, brocades, and tissues. [...] Strephon, who found the room was void, And Betty {{otherwise}} employ'd, Stole in, and took a strict survey Of all the litter as it lay: Whereof, to make the matter clear, An inventory follows here. [...] And, first, a dirty smock appear'd, Beneath the arm-pits well besmear'd; Strephon, the rogue, display'd it wide, And turn'd it round on ev'ry side: On such a point, few words are best, And Strephon bids us guess the rest; But swears, how damnably the men lie In calling Celia sweet and cleanly. [...] Now listen, while he next produces The various combs for various uses; Fill'd up with dirt so closely fixt, No brush could force a way betwixt; A paste of composition rare, Sweat, dandriff, powder, lead, and hair: A fore-head cloth with oil upon't, To smooth the wrinkles on her front: Here alum-flour, to stop the steams Exhaled from sour unsavoury streams: There night-gloves made of Tripsey's hide, [1]Bequeath'd by Tripsey when she died; With puppy-water, beauty's help, Distil'd from Tripsey's darling whelp. Here gallipots and vials placed, Some fill'd with washes, some with paste; Some with pomatums, paints, and slops, And ointments good for scabby chops. Hard by a filthy bason stands, Foul'd with the scouring of her hands: The bason takes whatever comes, The scrapings from her teeth and gums, A nasty compound of all hues, For here she spits, and here she spues. [...] But, oh! it turn'd poor Strephon's bowels When he beheld and smelt the towels, Begumm'd, bematter'd, and beslim'd, With dirt, and sweat, and ear-wax grim'd; No object Strephon's eye escapes; Here petticoats in frouzy heaps; Nor be the handkerchiefs forgot, All varnish'd o'er with snuff and snot. The stockings why should I expose, Stain'd with the moisture of her toes,[2] Or greasy coifs, and pinners reeking, Which Celia slept {{at least a week}} in? A pair of tweezers next he found, To pluck her brows in arches round; Or hairs that sink the forehead low, Or on her chin like bristles grow. [...] The virtues we must not let pass Of Celia's magnifying glass; When frighted Strephon cast his eye on't, It shew'd the visage of a giant: A glass that can to sight disclose The smallest worm in Celia's nose, And faithfully direct her nail To squeeze it out from head to tail; For, catch it nicely by the head, It must come out, alive or dead. [...] Why, Strephon, will you tell the rest? And must you needs describe the chest? That careless wench! no creature warn her To move it out from yonder corner! But leave it standing full in sight, For you to exercise your spight? In vain the workman shew'd his wit, With rings and hinges counterfeit, To make it seem in this disguise A cabinet to vulgar eyes: Which Strephon ventur'd to look in, Resolved to go thro' thick and thin. He lifts the lid: there needs no more, He smelt it all the time before. [...] As, from within Pandora's box, When Epimetheus op'd the locks, A sudden universal crew Of human evils upward flew; He still was comforted to find That hope at last remain'd behind: So Strephon, lifting up the lid, To view what in the chest was hid, The vapours flew from up the vent; But Strephon, cautious, never meant The <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pan</b> to grope, And foul his hands in search of hope. O! ne'er may such a vile machine Be once in Celia's chamber seen! O! may she better learn to keep Those [...] "secrets of the hoary deep." [...] [3] [...] As mutton-cutlets, prime of meat, Which, tho' with art you salt and beat, As laws of cookery require, And toast them at the clearest fire; If from upon the hopeful chops The fat upon a cinder drops, To stinking smoke it turns the flame, Pois'ning the flesh from whence it came, And up exhales a greasy stench, For which you curse the careless wench: So things which must not be exprest, When drop'd into the reeking chest, Send up an excremental smell To taint the part from whence they fell: The petticoats and gown perfume, And waft a stink round ev'ry room. [...] Thus finishing his grand survey, Disgusted Strephon slunk away; Repeating in his amorous fits, [...] "Oh! Celia, Celia, Celia sh--!" [...] But Vengeance, goddess never sleeping, Soon punish'd Strephon for his peeping: His foul imagination links Each dame he sees with all her stinks; And, if unsavoury odours fly, Conceives a lady standing by. All women his description fits, And both ideas jump like wits; By vicious fancy coupled fast, And still appearing in contrast. [...] I pity wretched Strephon, blind To all the charms of woman kind. Should I the Queen of Love refuse, Because she rose from stinking ooze? To him that looks behind the scene, Statira's but some pocky quean. [...] When Celia in her glory shews, If Strephon would but stop his nose, (Who now so impiously blasphemes Her ointments, daubs, and paints, and creams, Her washes, slops, and every clout, With which he makes so foul a rout;) He soon would learn to think like me, And bless his ravish'd sight to see Such order from confusion sprung, Such gaudy tulips raised from dung.|$|E

The dryer is a direct and integrated type, with a black mate pan which measures 1. 675 x 0. 61 x 0. 055 m (1. 02 m 2). It uses a copper helical tube that conducts hot water, at 80 °C, generating extra heat for the drying process; the tube is located at <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> black <b>pan.</b> A caliber 6, transparent vinyl film {{is used as a}} cover and the walls and base <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dryer are isolated by 0. 0254 m thick fiberglass.

Each slice was 0. 005 m thick, resulting in a mass density of 2. 83 kg/m 2 in the drying trays area. To be able to have useful comparisons, drying tests were performed during winter and spring of 2013, using both the hybrid dryer and the traditional solar dryer. Results showed that when initial humidity between pineapples is quite similar (this being one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most influential factors in changing efficiency, time and other important process variables), evaporation efficiencies are higher in the traditional process; such efficiencies ranging between 22. 7 % and 24. 0 %; while <b>the</b> efficiency <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hybrid dryer ranges between 9. 3 % and 14. 0 %. This is basically due to <b>the</b> increase <b>of</b> energy loss when using both sunlight and heated water. On the other hand, the time the process took to reach the humidity goal (24. 0 % humid base or 0. 32 dry based) was much faster when using the hybrid dryer. This dryer ended the process in a range of 6. 0 to 6. 8 hours while the traditional solar process took between 8. 0 and 8. 8 hours.

5000|$|In 1878, Sutton {{developed}} a better method to extract sugar from sugar cane juice."What {{looks like a}} decided improvement upon the open air methods hitherto followed to evaporate cane juice has just been patented by Messrs. J. W. Sutton and Co., coppersmiths, Brisbane. Mr. Sutton aims at evaporating juice at a heat of from 120° to 180°. This he does in the open air. He obtains the required temperature {{by means of a}} steam coil running around his evaporating <b>pan,</b> which is <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ordinary circular form. This heat will not boil <b>the</b> liquor, <b>of</b> course; that he accomplishes by menus of a perforated pipe or coil coming in at <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> evaporating <b>pan.</b> Through this latter coil, a current of air is forced by a fan blast. The air may either be of atmospheric temperature, or it may be heated, as seems most desirable. In <b>the</b> event <b>of</b> heated air being forced into the liquor, or through it, the air is passed through furnaces in a series of pipes, by which means it becomes highly rarefied, and the temperature is raised at the same time. We have seen the apparatus at work, cold air being used, and there was a particularly brisk ebullion, while <b>the</b> temperature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> liquid at first barely marked 130°. Mr. Sutton's calculation at the time was that three gallons were evaporated per hour from each superficial foot <b>of</b> liquid while <b>the</b> temperatures was 180°. The evaporation was certainly very rapid, and the temperature completely under control. Two pans upon this principle have been ordered, one by Mr. R. Muir, of Nerang, who intends to have it at work early next month. The advantage claimed are- at least double <b>the</b> ordinary rate <b>of</b> evaporation by open fire-boiling, with absolute security from burning, and perfect control over the entire apparatus, including facilities for skimming and cleaning the liquor and syrups on the boiling proceeds. Mr. Sutton has gone into this matter, as he has into other improvements, with energy and skill, and deserves the success likely to flow from his efforts.""Messrs. J. W. Sutton and Co. have been granted a patent for an improvement in <b>the</b> manufacture <b>of</b> sugar, and, from the many trials to which it has lately been subjected, is pronounced by those most interested in judging its capabilities a very decided success.""A trial of Messrs.
