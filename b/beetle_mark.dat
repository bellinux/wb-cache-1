40|$|Techniques of {{population}} estimation with acceptable limits of percision were investigated for the adult beetle of Tribolium castaneum. Two techniques were tested : direct counting of insects on sample units of known size and method of capture, marking, release and recapture. About 1082 cm 3 of whole-wheat flour together with 1095 adult beetles were placed into plastic cylindrical vessel, 21. 5 cm {{in diameter and}} 12 cm in height. Each sample was taken filling 1. 8 x 5 cm glass tube with flour together with beetles. The result of estimations in different sample sizes was shown in Table 1. In the present study sample size calculated for 10 % admissible error was 54. The capture-recapture method was employed : one hundred of <b>beetles</b> were <b>marked</b> on the elytra with white lacquer and released.

The Beetle ultimately gave rise to variants, including the Karmann Ghia, Type 2 and external coach builders. The <b>Beetle</b> <b>marked</b> a significant trend, led by Volkswagen, Fiat, and Renault, whereby the rear-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout increased from 2.6 percent of continental Western Europe's car production in 1946 to 26.6 percent in 1956. The 1948 Citroën 2CV and other European models marked a later trend to front-wheel drive in the European small-car market, a trend that would come to dominate that market. In 1974, Volkswagen's own front-wheel drive Golf model succeeded the Beetle. In 1994, Volkswagen unveiled the Concept One, a [...] "retro"-themed concept car with a resemblance to the original Beetle, and in 1998 introduced the [...] "New Beetle", built on the contemporary Golf platform with styling recalling the original Type 1. It remained in production through 2010, being succeeded in 2011 by the more aggressively styled Beetle (A5).|$|R

40|$|Summary &mdash; The {{dispersal}} {{range and}} the flight behaviour of lps sexdentatus in pine forest were studied using mark-recapture experiments. 9 614 <b>beetles</b> were <b>marked</b> by the elytra engraving meth-od and released just after emergence. They were caught at different distances in pheromone baited traps. Less than 10 % of the beetles failed to take off. Flyers were captured at distances up to 4 km. The main dispersal occurred during the first day. When wind speed rose> 3 m/s, beetles were main-ly caught in the upwind direction at the shortest trapping distances and mainly in the downwind di-rection at the longest trapping distances. For the same trap density, the number of beetles captured increased with trapping distance. This was interpreted as a flight exercise requisite prior to chemo-tropic orientation. The trapping attraction radius was estimated at 80 m. These findings bring into question {{the use of the}} pheromone trapping system for the control and prognosis of lps sexdentatus...|$|R

40|$|African black beetle, Heteronychus arator (Scarabaeidae), is {{an exotic}} pest of {{pastures}} in northern New Zealand. Both adults and larvae feed on pasture grasses. Adults disperse by walking (short range) or flying (long range). Dispersal flights are triggered by warm night temperatures {{in spring and}} autumn. Short range adult dispersal in search of mates, food or oviposition sites is poorly understood. This study investigated walking activity of H. arator adults over three seasons in New Zealand pastures. Adult walking activity was monitored using pitfall traps along fence lines and in pasture plots on a dairy farm in Waikato, New Zealand, in spring 2013, spring 2014 and autumn 2015. Beetle populations were reduced by application of a biopesticide bait to compare walking activity between treated and control plots for up to 26 days post-treatment. <b>Marked</b> <b>beetles</b> were released into the pasture plots to measure the distance travelled by recaptured individuals. Trap catches along the fence lines were correlated with air temperatures in 2013. Trap catches were male biased in spring 2014 compared with autumn 2015.

40|$|The Rosalia longicorn or Alpine longhorn (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae) is an {{endangered}} and strictly protected icon of European saproxylic biodiversity. Despite its popularity, {{lack of information}} on its demography and mobility may compromise adoption of suitable conservation strategies. The <b>beetle</b> experienced <b>marked</b> retreat from NW part of its range; its single population survives N of the Alps and W of the Carpathians. The population inhabits several small patches of old beech forest on hill-tops of the Ralska Upland, Czech Republic. We performed mark-recapture study {{of the population and}} assessed its distribution pattern. Our results demonstrate the high mobility of the beetle, including dispersal between hills (up to 1. 6 km). The system is thus interconnected; it contained ∼ 2000 adult beetles in 2008. Estimated population densities were high, ranging between 42 and 84 adult beetles/hectare a year. The population survives at a former military-training ground despite long-term isolation and low cover of mature beech forest (∼ 1 %). Its survival could be attributed to lack of forestry activities between the 1950 s and 1990 s, slow succession preventing canopy closure and undergrowth expansion, and probably also to the distribution of habitat patches on conspicuous hill-tops. In order to increase chances of the population for long term survival, we propose to stop clear-cuts of old beech forests, increase semi-open beech woodlands in areas currently covered by conifer plantations and active habitat management at inhabited sites and their wider environs...|$|R
5|$|Beetles {{typically}} have a particularly hard exoskeleton including the elytra, though {{some such as}} the rove beetles have very short elytra while blister beetles have softer elytra. The general anatomy of a beetle is quite uniform and typical of insects, although there are several examples of novelty, such as adaptations in water beetles which trap air bubbles under the elytra for use while diving. Beetles are endopterygotes, {{which means that they}} undergo complete metamorphosis, with a series of conspicuous and relatively abrupt changes in body structure between hatching and becoming adult after a relatively immobile pupal stage. Some, such as stag <b>beetles,</b> have a <b>marked</b> sexual dimorphism, the males possessing enormously enlarged mandibles which they use to fight other males.

Pheromone-baited traps were placed in circular traplines at distances from 5 to 500 m from a central release location to (1) {{examine the relationship between}} wind direction and beetle catches in traps arranged around the release point, and (2) evaluate beetle catch characteristics when distances to baited traps were varied. A total of 29 800 <b>marked</b> <b>beetles</b> were released in three experiments. Upwind flight was most strongly exhibited at 5 m, with an upwind trend at 25 m, and no consistent flight pattern at 100 m, when wind movement was significantly directed. When the closest attraction was 100 m from the release point, beetles were caught uniformly in all directions indicating that flight was non-directional with respect to wind, for light wind speeds. Catches at 500 -m traps tended to be downwind, thus beetles capable of flying that distance were ones that were flying with the wind.

Wind direction within the forest setting, 350 m from the closest open site, was quite variable with a beetle recapture pattern that was non-directional.

In total, 111 males and 25 females were captured, and VES was by far the most efficient method, accounting for 93 % of first captures, and 95 % of all captures. Stag beetles were not significantly attracted to any tested odour, and many PT were damaged by wild boars (Sus scrofa). Flying males were the most frequent adults observed during the season. The use of a net is necessary to capture the stag beetles, in order to evaluate the population parameters and to assess the local status of threat for the species. Capture data revealed that body size (i. e. body weight and elytron length) influences the survival probability of stag beetles, showing a lower survival probability for larger males. Felt-tip pen marking on the ventral sclerites of head and pronotum is a reliable and long lasting method for <b>marking</b> <b>beetles,</b> as proved by the use of an independent marking procedure with a small drill.

In contrast, notched beetles survived longer (mean[*]=[*] 353. 6 [*]±[*] 5. 3  days) with the last beetle dying after 383  days. Likewise, notched beetles (presumed to be injured because of oozing hemolymph from the notched area) also lived long {{with an average of}} 193. 6 [*]±[*] 38. 8  days. Notching also resulted in a high rate of recovery; 81 % for beetles introduced directly into a nucleus colony, and 59 % and 66 % for a nucleus colony and pole traps, respectively, for beetles released inside a screen tent. These high recovery rates confirmed that notching did not interfere with the beetles' ability to fly. However, it appeared that notched females laid more eggs than those that were not notched both with multiple (171. 70 [*]±[*] 11. 20 vs 126. 87 [*]±[*] 10. 27 eggs per day) and single (70. 02 [*]±[*] 5. 45 vs 57. 97 [*]±[*] 5. 12 eggs per day) pairs for a period of 1 - 3  days.

In three experiments, samples were taken in a radial pattern around the release point. Released beales for the most part left the 0. 36 ha (68 m diameter) sample area within 24 hours, and their average residence time in the sample area was calculated as 12, 6 and 1. 6 h in the three experiments, respectively. The spatial distribution of beetles around the point of release could be described with normal distributions whose variance increased linearly in time with 3. 8. 1. 1 and 0. 34 m 2 per hour. In three additional field experiments the departure of <b>marked</b> <b>beetles</b> was compared between sugar-sprayed plots and control plots. Residence time was 20 - 30 ␕onger in sugar-sprayed plots than in control plots, with mean residences of 5. 3, 3. 6, and 2. 9 h in the sugar-sprayed plots in the three experiments, respectively, and means of 4. 4, 2. 7, and 2. 4 h in the control plots. The density of unmarked beales rose by a factor of 10 - 20 in the sugar sprayed plots during the first 4 to 6 hours following early morning spraying of sugar. This rapid and substantial increase in density cannot be explained by the slightly longer residence time in sugar-sprayed plots.

40|$|Knowledge of {{patterns}} of genetic diversity in populations of threatened species {{is vital for}} their effective conservation. Rosalia longicorn (Rosalia alpina) is an endangered and strictly protected <b>beetle.</b> Despite a <b>marked</b> decline in part of its range, the beetle has recently expanded to the lowlands of Central Europe. To facilitate {{a better understanding of}} the species' biology, recent expansion and more effective conservation measures, we investigated patterns of genetic structure among 32 populations across Central and South-east Europe. Eight microsatellite loci and a partial mitochondrial gene (cytochrome c oxidase subunit I) were used as markers. Both markers showed a significant decline in genetic diversity with latitude, suggesting a glacial refugium in north-western Greece. The cluster analysis of the nuclear marker indicated the existence of two genetically distinct lineages meeting near the border between the Western and Eastern Carpathians. By contrast, one widespread mtDNA haplotype was dominant in most populations, leading to the assumption that a rapid expansion of a single lineage occurred across the study area. The genetic differentiation among populations from the north-western part of the study area was, however, surprisingly low. They lacked any substructure and isolation-by-distance on a scale of up to 600 km. This result suggests a strong dispersal capacity of the species, as well as a lack of migration barriers throughout the study area. That the lowland populations are closely related to those from the nearby mountains indicates repeated colonization of the lowlands. Our results further suggest that R. alpina mostly lives in large, open populations. Large-scale conservation measures need to be applied to allow for its continued existence...|$|R
40|$|International audienceSamples of Norway spruce (Picea abies [L. ] Karst) were dendrochronologically {{investigated}} {{in order to}} detect infestations by Dendroctonus micans (Kug.), the great spruce bark beetle (Col. Scolytidae), a relatively recent introduction to France. Uninfested natural forests located in the north-eastern French Alps and heavily infested plantations in the Ardeche region (Massif Central) were compared. The penetration holes bored in trunks by the bark <b>beetle</b> induced visible <b>marks</b> on wood, such as extreme ring width reductions, locally missing rings and crescent-shaped resin patches between consecutive rings that make possible a post-infestation dating. The outbreak began in 1979, 5 years prior to first insect visual detection by foresters. In the infested forest, tree basal area growth was not as sustained as in uninfested natural stands, but showed an inflection point at an unusually young tree age (from 30 to 40 years). Ring widths showing extreme synchronous radial growth reductions were caused either by excessively cold periods (e. g. in 1948, 1980, 1984, 1992) or by summer drought (as in 1986). Most of these weak growth years were shared with uninfested sites. In healthy forests, the consequences of extremely cold years were usually recorded only in high elevation stands, especially near the timberline, whereas summer drought effects were mostly visible in low altitude forests. By contrast, both phenomena were recorded in the infected Ardeche plantation. An analysis of tree-rings and monthly climate confirmed that Norway spruce growth in Ardeche plantations was reduced by excessively low minimum temperature during {{most parts of the}} year prior to ring formation, by higher than average maximum temperature during current spring and summer, and by drought in winter, spring and summer. Thus, the regional Ardeche climate with both cold winters and dry summers (especially in July) seems to weaken spruce trees planted there. Moreover, tree sensitivity to climate was found to be greatly enhanced by insect infestation. Such interactions between climatic stress and insect outbreak led to forest dieback in a 15 - 20 -year period, when trees were still young (less than 70 years), and without any tree recovery. Therefore, in that region spruce plantations should be replaced by non-host species of Dendroctonus micans, especially where soil conditions may exacerbate drought effects. (C) 2004 Elsevier B. V.

Spatial {{dynamics}} of beetles living on exposed riverine sediments {{in the upper}} River Severn; method development and preliminary results. ? Aquatic Conservation: Marine and Freshwater Systems, 15, (2), 159 - 174. 1. Exposed riverine sediments (ERS) are habitats for {{a large number of}} rare and specialized invertebrates and, as such, are of considerable conservation importance. Actions that threaten ERS specialists operate on a variety of scales and include river engineering, flow regulation and livestock damage. Populations of specific species of ERS specialist beetles are likely to exhibit individual responses to these threats, depending on the spatial structure and {{dynamics of}} the population. An understanding of the spatial dynamics of ERS specialist beetles is, therefore, essential if conservation initiatives are to be successful. 2. A mark-recapture experiment was used to investigate the spatial dynamics of beetles on a section of the upper River Severn, mid-Wales, during June and August 2002. Two species of carabid, Bembidion atrocaeruleum Stephens and Bembidion decorum (Zenker), and one elaterid, Fleutiauxellus maritimus (Curtis), were individually marked and released on one of nine discrete patches of ERS demonstrating a range of patch size, sediment size, habitat heterogeneity, degree of shading, vegetation cover and grazing intensity. The methods used to trap, handle and individually <b>mark</b> <b>beetles</b> were all found to be suitable. 3. Population size of B. atrocaeruleum was mainly determined by ERS patch size, suggesting that, in contrast to F. maritimus, this species used all ERS microhabitats. 4. During the June study, 5. 7 % of marked and recaptured B. atrocaeruleum and 10 % of marked and recaptured B. decorum actively moved between ERS patches over water or through thick vegetation in both upstream and downstream directions. Inter-patch movements of > 65 m for B. atrocaeruleum and > 135 m for B. decorum were detected. Movement rates in August were lower. F. maritimus showed no evidence of inter-patch movement. 5. The lower rate of dispersal and more specific habitat requirements are postulated as reasons for the greater rarity of F. maritimus. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|The {{mobility}} of carabid beetles {{in the field}} has been studied {{by a number of}} researchers in recent years, but the small scale movements are still poorly understood. The populations of five species of carabid beetles living in a Surrey oakwood were therefore investigated using pitfall trapping and individual marking techniques over a period of three years. Five aspects of the complications associated with the interpretation of pitfall trapping and mark-release-recapture studies were investigated: (i) baiting of the traps by the catch itself, (ii) escape ability of captured beetles, (iii) changes in behaviour following overlong procedures between capture and release, (iv) density effects produced in trapping, and (v) effects of marking procedures on behaviour and survival. No effects could be demonstrated for (i), (iv) and (v). However, the escape rate in Nebria brevicollis was shown to be very high, and the behaviour of the same species affected by the length of time between capture and subsequent release. More than 3000 recaptures of <b>marked</b> <b>beetles</b> were made. Survival into a second breeding season was found to be commonplace in all five species; a few even entered a fourth. The distributions of the beetles within the study area were aggregated, particularly so in Nebria, where it was also shown that the beetles tend to remain in the areas where they are in the highest densities. Distributions changed little with season. Peak displacement rates were associated with the breeding seasonin Nebria but, whereas this fell off with the onset of winter in first season beetles, the level remained high in second season individuals. Pterostichus madidus exhibited a significant lack of displacement with time, except with males during the breeding season. Greatest activity and dispersal was found in August in first season males, but June and July with second season. Abax parallelepipedus beetles were found to be most active early in the season. Very few beetles of the species were found to disperse 100 metres or more within the study area. The concept of home range was examined in relation to ground beetles. Site attachment could not be demonstrated in any species, although other aspects of the trapping results indicated some form of home ranging behaviour. <p...|$|R
40|$|Exposed Riverine Sediments (ERS) {{are highly}} dynamic {{habitats}} that support {{large numbers of}} rare and scarce invertebrates. ERS are characterised by a high diversity of microhabitats and microclimates. The thesis aimed to assess ERS habitats at a micro, patch and reach scale addressing three broad aims (1) to characterise the nature and dynamics of ERS microhabitat through investigating the thermal characteristics of ERS with respect to sediment calibre, depth and distance from the water‟s edge, and so identify the key factors that control variations in surface and subsurface physical habitat spatially and temporally.

Identifying if species show a (3) Examine the spatial dynamics of beetle assemblages in relation to patch environmental variables and, assess population stability, persistence, occupancy and synchrony over time in relation to river flow. ERS microhabitats were found to be subject to strong lateral gradients in sediment, temperature and humidity that are amplified in hot dry weather. Specialist ERS beetles and spiders were found to occupy distinct habitats and showed clear spatial zonation in regard to sediment calibre, vegetation and elevation. Distribution of some species was highly variable and responsive to elevated levels humidity and temperature. Microclimate was found to have a greater influence over invertebrate distributions than food availability. The analysis of the long term data set provided evidence that larger and diverse ERS within sample reaches is associated with larger numbers of beetles of conservation value. Cattle trampling and stabilisation through vegetation were identified as having significant deleterious effects on ERS habitat quality. River flow variability, specifically the timing of high flow events was found to potentially have a negative influence on beetle abundance, population stability and persistence. Population synchrony revealed that the UKBAP beetle Perileptus areolatus exhibits little mobility and is highly resilient to inundation. However this makes it more susceptible to reach scale disturbance and a reduction in either habitat availability or quality...|$|R
