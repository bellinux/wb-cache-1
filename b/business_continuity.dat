25|$|Information Assurance (IA) is {{the process}} of getting the right {{information}} to the right people at the right time. IA adds business benefit through the use of Information Risk Management, Trust Management, Resilience, appropriate Architecture, system safety, and security, which increases the utility of information to authorized users and reduces the utility of information to those unauthorized. It is strongly related to the field of information security, and also with <b>business</b> <b>continuity.</b> IA relates more to the business level and strategic risk management of information and related systems, rather than the creation and application of security controls. Therefore, in addition to defending against malicious hackers and code (e.g., viruses), IA practitioners consider corporate governance issues such as privacy, regulatory and standards compliance, auditing, <b>business</b> <b>continuity,</b> and disaster recovery as they relate to information systems. Further, while information security draws primarily from computer science, IA is an interdisciplinary field requiring expertise in business, accounting, user experience, fraud examination, forensic science, management science, systems engineering, security engineering, and criminology, in addition to computer science. Therefore, IA is best thought of as a superset of information security (i.e. umbrella term), and as the business outcome of Information Risk Management.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{conventional}} {{methods of}} information system analysis and design are {{not based on}} service-oriented paradigm that facilitates control of <b>business</b> process <b>continuity</b> and integrity. Service-oriented representations are quite comprehensible for business experts as well as system designers. It is reasonable to conceptualize a business process in terms of service-oriented events, before the supporting technical system is designed. UML design primitives abstract from the concrete implementation artefacts and therefore they are difficult to comprehend for business analysis experts. Separation of different modelling dimensions tends to draw {{attention away from the}} semantic consistency issues of various diagram types. The presented approach for service-oriented analysis is based just on three types of events: creation, reclassification and termination, which can also be used for the semantic integrity and consistency control. In this paper, the basic service-oriented constructs are defined. Semantics of these implementation neutral artefacts are analysed in terms of their associated counterparts that are used in object-oriented design. ...|$|R
