5|$|Kidney {{and heart}} {{diseases}} {{have been reported}} in the breed. In an experiment directed by John C. Fyfea, Rebeccah L. Kurzhals, and others, it was concluded that a complex rearrangement in the breed's Glycogen <b>branching</b> <b>enzyme</b> (GBE1) can cause both a perinatal hypoglycemic collapse and a late-juvenile-onset neuromuscular degeneration in glycogen storage disease type IV in the breed. This disorder, while rare, can prove fatal to cats that have it. There are DNA tests available for GSD IV, and it is highly recommended (some cat associations obligate their Norwegian Forest cat breeder members) to carry out the DNA test before using such animals for breeding. PawPeds provide a pedigree database which comes together with health programmes, through publishing each single cat's test result, to provide useful information for breeders to make a well-informed breeding decision.

40|$|Abstract Background Starch {{is stored}} in higher plants as {{granules}} composed of semi-crystalline amylopectin and amorphous amylose. Starch granules provide energy for the plant during dark periods and for germination of seeds and tubers. Dietary starch is also a highly glycemic carbohydrate being degraded to glucose and rapidly absorbed in the small intestine. But a portion of dietary starch, termed “resistant starch” (RS) escapes digestion and reaches the large intestine, where it is fermented by colonic bacteria producing short chain fatty acids (SCFA) which are linked to several health benefits. The RS is preferentially derived from amylose, which can be increased by suppressing amylopectin synthesis by silencing of starch <b>branching</b> <b>enzymes</b> (SBEs). However all the previous works attempting the production of high RS crops resulted in only partly increased amylose-content and/or significant yield loss. Results In this study we invented a new method for silencing of multiple genes. Using a chimeric RNAi hairpin we simultaneously suppressed all genes coding for starch <b>branching</b> <b>enzymes</b> (SBE I, SBE IIa, SBE IIb) in barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), resulting in production of amylose-only starch granules in the endosperm. This trait was segregating 3 : 1. Amylose-only starch granules were irregularly shaped and showed peculiar thermal properties and crystallinity. Transgenic lines retained high-yield possibly due to a pleiotropic upregualtion of other starch biosynthetic genes compensating the SBEs loss. For gelatinized starch, a very high content of RS (65 %) was observed, which is 2. 2 -fold higher than control (29 %). The amylose-only grains germinated with same frequency as control grains. However, initial growth was delayed in young plants. Conclusions This {{is the first time}} that pure amylose has been generated with high yield in a living organism. This was achieved by a new method of simultaneous suppression of the entire complement of genes encoding starch <b>branching</b> <b>enzymes.</b> We demonstrate that amylopectin is not essential for starch granule crystallinity and integrity. However the slower initial growth of shoots from amylose-only grains may be due to an important physiological role played by amylopectin ordered crystallinity for rapid starch remobilization explaining the broad conservation in the plant kingdom of the amylopectin structure. </p...|$|R
30|$|Amylose chains in the {{wild-type}} and mutant rice samples examined {{here can}} be divided into two different groups, long and short, with different ranges of degrees of polymerization showing distinct features in the chain-length distribution. The present results show that these two amylose groups have different dominant biosynthesis enzymes. As is well known, long amylose chains are mainly synthesized by GBSSI. The synthesis of short amylose chains is found here to be controlled not only by GBSSI but also starch <b>branching</b> <b>enzymes,</b> which are also involved in long amylopectin chain synthesis. Because these smaller amylose chains have significant effects on functional properties such as mouth-feel and digestibility (Syahariza et al. 2013; Syahariza et al. 2014), this finding has potential application in the development of improved crop varieties.|$|R
25|$|Glycogen {{synthesis}} is, unlike its breakdown, endergonic—it {{requires the}} input of energy. Energy for glycogen synthesis comes from uridine triphosphate (UTP), which reacts with glucose-1-phosphate, forming UDP-glucose, in a reaction catalysed by UTP—glucose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase. Glycogen is synthesized from monomers of UDP-glucose initially by the protein glycogenin, which has two tyrosine anchors for the reducing end of glycogen, since glycogenin is a homodimer. After about eight glucose molecules {{have been added to}} a tyrosine residue, the enzyme glycogen synthase progressively lengthens the glycogen chain using UDP-glucose, adding α(1→4)-bonded glucose. The glycogen <b>branching</b> <b>enzyme</b> catalyzes the transfer of a terminal fragment of six or seven glucose residues from a nonreducing end to the C-6 hydroxyl group of a glucose residue deeper into the interior of the glycogen molecule.

40|$|Starch is an {{important}} raw material both for food and non-food purposes. It is synthesized and stored in source and sink tissues in plants. The starch deposited in amyloplasts of storage tissues possesses several physico-chemical properties, which makes it desirable for diverse applications. For industrial applications, starches high in either amylose or amylopectin are preferred {{in order to minimize}} chemical modification. The main purpose in our research is to understand starch synthesis in the sorghum endosperm, and use this information to generate transgenic sorghum with novel starches for both human diet and industrial application. In starch biosynthesis, the activity and expression profile of starch <b>branching</b> <b>enzymes</b> is important in determining both the yield and proportion of amylose and amylopectin. This thesis describes some of the characteristics of starch <b>branching</b> <b>enzymes</b> and their genes in sorghum. The genes encoding two SBE isoforms, SBEIIa and SBEIIb, were cloned and characterised. Comparison of the SBEIIb amino acid sequence with sequences from related species revealed a conserved core stretch of amino acids believed to harbor the catalytic site of the enzyme. Spatial expression patterns showed that the activity of sorghum sbeI and sbeIIb are seed-specific, while sorghum sbeIIa is expressed in endosperm, embryonic and vegetative tissues. We demonstrated that endosperm-specific expression of barley sbeIIb is governed by the second intron of the barley sbeIIb gene, and that the same second intron can confer endosperm specific expression to both sorghum sbeIIb and barley sbeIIa. This implies that a similar regulation factor in barley, which interacts with sequences within the intron, is also present in sorghum. Deletion mutagenesis of the sorghum sbeIIb promoter showed that a, 1 -kb fragment 5 ´ of the transcriptional start site constitutes the minimal promoter capable of high level expression. Diurnal expression profiles suggested that an endogenous oscillator in the endosperm controls expression of sbeI, sbIIa and sbeIIb...|$|R
