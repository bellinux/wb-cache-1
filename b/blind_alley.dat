25|$|Sheriff Bill Presley and his deputies have a {{difficult}} task ahead of them {{as they attempt to}} solve the shocking double murder discovered Sunday morning. Texarkana residents can help in this investigation {{and at the same time}} if they are not careful, they can hinder the investigation and cause the officers to spend many hours following blind trails. Persons who have information which might furnish a clue to the identity of the slayer or slayers or which might indicate a motive for the crime should not divulge such information on street corners or at cold drink stands but should immediately make it available to the officers. Do not spread rumors regardless of how much basis for fact there is in them. Do not say 'I heard' or 'they say', because the chances are that the person listening will repeat your information and enlarge upon it. Before long the story grows to such proportions as to necessitate a detailed investigation by the officers, thereby perhaps pulling them off the true trail and sending them up a <b>blind</b> <b>alley.</b> Stick to facts that you know of your own personal knowledge and relay those facts as quickly as possible to the officers.|$|E

2500|$|The Piltdown Man fraud {{significantly}} affected early research on human evolution. Notably, it led scientists down a <b>blind</b> <b>alley</b> {{in the belief}} that the human brain expanded in size before the jaw adapted to new types of food. Discoveries of Australopithecine fossils such as the Taung child found by Raymond Dart during the 1920s in South Africa were ignored due to the support for Piltdown Man as [...] "the missing link," [...] and the reconstruction of human evolution was confused for decades. The examination and debate over Piltdown Man caused a vast expenditure of time and effort on the fossil, with an estimated 250+ papers written on the topic.|$|E
2500|$|Other {{obstacles}} {{were mentioned}} by Cardinal Walter Kasper, President of the Pontifical Council for the Promotion of Christian Unity, in a talk {{at a conference}} of Anglican bishops and laity at St Albans, UK, in 2003. He noted that [...] "a final solution [...] can be found only in {{the larger context of}} full communion in faith, sacramental life and shared apostolic vision". He specifically mentioned obstacles like [...] "lay presidency, the ordination of women, and ethical problems such as abortion and homosexual partnerships." [...] This position (with its emphasis on [...] "doctrinal belief") seems to be in line with the attitude of Orthodoxy toward Anglican orders. Kallistos Ware, for example, notes in his book, The Orthodox Church: [...] "For Orthodoxy, the validity of ordinations does not depend simply on the fulfillment of certain technical conditions (external possession of the apostolic succession; correct form, matter and intention). The Orthodox also ask: What is the sacramental succession and priesthood? How does it understand the eucharistic presence and sacrifice? Only when these questions have been answered can a decision be made about the validity or otherwise of ordination. To isolate the problem of valid orders is to go up a <b>blind</b> <b>alley.</b> Realizing this, Anglicans and Orthodox in their discussions from the 1950s onwards have left the question of valid orders largely to one side, and have concentrated on more substantive and central themes of doctrinal belief." ...|$|E
