25|$|Bidborough Mill is a four-storey brick tower mill, partly {{rendered}} with cement. It had a Kentish-style cap, four single patent sails and was winded by a fantail. The millstones {{were driven}} underdrift. A large pulley {{on the outside}} of the mill at first-floor level allowed the mill to be driven by belt from a traction engine or tractor, via a gear bolted to the underside of the Great Spur Wheel.

25|$|From a Wesleyan {{point of}} view, Conyers was a revivalist, who <b>before</b> <b>conversion</b> was tending to Socinianism, but then leaned in the Calvinist direction; he {{prepared}} the ground locally for a Methodist chapel.

His successor as parish priest was John Clement, vicar of Helmsley 1776 to 1805.|$|E
25|$|For {{very large}} numbers, these simple methods are inefficient because they perform {{a large number}} of multiplications or {{divisions}} where one operand is very large. A simple divide-and-conquer algorithm is more effective asymptotically: given a binary number, it is divided by 10k, where k is chosen so that the quotient roughly equals the remainder; then each of these pieces is converted to decimal and the two are concatenated. Given a decimal number, it can be split into two pieces of about the same size, each of which is converted to binary, whereupon the first converted piece is multiplied by 10k and added to the second converted piece, where k is the number of decimal digits in the second, least-significant piece <b>before</b> <b>conversion.</b>|$|E

2500|$|... "At {{the time}} of the initial {{conception}} of the Short SB5 research aircraft (1949), it was recognised that the trend towards higher angles of sweepback was likely to continue, and this was emphasised by the existence of a design for an operational fighter aircraft, the English Electric P1 (Lightning), which was to have a sweepback of 60°. There was then no flight experience with wings of this amount of sweepback. The SB5 was designed to allow a gradual approach to this configuration, flying initially with 50° sweepback <b>before</b> <b>conversion</b> to 60° when it would resemble, aerodynamically, a seven-eighths scale model of the Lightning. To increase its usefulness as a research vehicle, the aircraft was capable of further modification to operate with 69° of wing sweepback." ...|$|E

2500|$|All {{of the ten}} {{ships were}} cargo type conversions. The N3-M-A1 vessels were diesel powered ships of a coastal cargo design more {{commonly}} steam powered. Fourteen of these diesel powered versions of the Maritime Commission [...] steam vessels were being built at Penn-Jersey Shipbuilding for the U.S. Navy or Lend Lease under contracts assumed by the Navy from the Maritime Commission effective 1 January 1943. Four hulls {{had been assigned to}} the British and five had been allocated to the Navy {{at the time of the}} Army's requirement. Ultimately the Army was allocated nine of the ten hulls originally allocated to Navy. The one exception was the ship already in Navy hands, the USS Enceladus (AK-80), that gave its name to a class of following vessels that were Navy only for administrative purposes during construction except for the USS Hydra (AK-82) that was transferred to Army after trials and before actual deployment. These are the remains of the Enceladus class that were in general transferred to Army a matter of weeks or even the day they were delivered to the Navy. Unfavorable experience with the Enceladus was involved in Navy's willingness to give up the rest of the hulls despite a critical need for small, shallow draft naval cargo vessels. None of the nine saw significant naval service <b>before</b> <b>conversion.</b> Some were converted from [...] One vessel was a World War I vintage cargo ship allocated to Army by the War Shipping Administration (WSA).|$|E
60|$|Answ. God {{knows best}} what we need. Paul was as righteous <b>before</b> <b>conversion</b> as any that can pretend to civility now, I suppose; {{and yet that}} {{notwithstanding}} he was made to shake, and was astonished at himself at his conversion. And truly I think the more righteous any is in his own eyes <b>before</b> <b>conversion,</b> the more need he has of heart-breaking work, in order to his salvation; because a man is not by nature so easily convinced that his righteousness is to God abominable, as he is that his debauchery and profaneness is.|$|E
