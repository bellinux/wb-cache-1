In {{areas such as the}} U.S. <b>Bible</b> <b>Belt</b> where conservative Christian dominance is strong, Pagans have faced continued religious persecution. For instance, Strmiska highlighted instances in both the U.S. and U.K. in which school teachers were fired when their employers discovered that they were Pagan.|$|E

25|$|As more Filipino Americans came to Texas, {{the center}} of their {{population}} shifted to Houston, which today has one of the largest Filipino populations in the South. With Texas being part of the <b>Bible</b> <b>Belt</b> it is often a popular destination for emigrating Filipino Protestants. In 2000, Texas was home to the seventh largest population of Filipino immigrants. According to the Census 2010, there are 137,713 Filipino Americans and Multiracial Filipino Americans in Texas. In 2011, five percent (86,400) of all Filipino immigrants in the United States lived in Texas.|$|E

As of 2010 the Southern Baptist Church was the biggest denomination, with 4,241 churches and 1,513,000 members; the second largest was the United Methodist Church, with 660,000 members and 1,923 churches. The third was the Roman Catholic Church, with 428,000 members in 190 congregations. The fourth greatest was the Presbyterian Church (USA), with 186,000 members and 710 congregations; this denomination was brought by Scots-Irish immigrants who settled the backcountry in the colonial era.|$|E
25|$|In {{an article}} in The British Journal of Sociology, Michael Rogin {{observed}} a heavy correlation between significant African American populations and white support for Wallace, similar to patterns that had long been observed in the Southern United States. He found a Black Belt running through {{the northern part of}} the state near Gary (at the time, Indiana's African-American population made up 6% of the state, compared to 45-50% in Gary), where Wallace consistently received overwhelming support across class lines from whites. A notable exception was the Jewish vote. He also found a <b>Bible</b> <b>Belt</b> of moderate-sized cities running through central Indiana where, despite a negligible black population, Wallace similarly dominated the Fundamentalist Christian white vote.|$|E
25|$|Author (and U.S. Senator) Jim Webb puts forth {{a thesis}} {{in his book}} Born Fighting (2004) {{to suggest that the}} {{character}} traits he ascribes to the Scotch-Irish such as loyalty to kin, extreme mistrust of governmental authority and legal strictures, and a propensity to bear arms and to use them, helped shape the American identity. In the same year that Webb's book was released, Barry A. Vann published his second book, entitled Rediscovering the South's Celtic Heritage. Like his earlier book, From Whence They Came (1998), Vann argues that these traits have left their imprint on the Upland South. In 2008, Vann followed up his earlier work with a book entitled In Search of Ulster Scots Land: The Birth and Geotheological Imagings of a Transatlantic People, which professes how these traits may manifest themselves in conservative voting patterns and religious affiliation that characterizes the <b>Bible</b> <b>Belt.</b>|$|E
25|$|Christianity is {{currently}} the largest religion in the Netherlands. The provinces of North Brabant and Limburg have historically been strongly Roman Catholic, {{and some of their}} people might still consider the Catholic Church as a base for their cultural identity. Protestantism in the Netherlands consists of a number of churches within various traditions. The largest of these is the Protestant Church in the Netherlands (PKN), a United church which is Reformed and Lutheran in orientation. It was formed in 2004 as a merger of the Dutch Reformed Church, the Reformed Churches in the Netherlands and a smaller Lutheran Church. Several orthodox Reformed and liberal churches did not merge into the PKN. Although in the Netherlands as a whole Christianity has become a minority, the Netherlands contains a <b>Bible</b> <b>Belt</b> from Zeeland to the northern parts of the province Overijssel, in which Protestant (particularly Reformed) beliefs remain strong, and even has majorities in municipal councils.|$|E

[...] His comments proved prophetic, as soon afterwards Lennon's remarks about the Beatles being [...] "more popular than Jesus" [...] embroiled the band in controversy and protest in America's <b>Bible</b> <b>Belt.</b> A public apology eased tensions, but a miserable US tour in August that was marked by half-filled stadiums and subpar performances proved to be their last.

500|$|As {{tensions}} in the Southern United States heightened over the civil rights movement, the Jews of Jackson came under threat, being targeted by both the Ku Klux Klan (KKK) and the Americans for the Preservation of the White Race (APWR). The latter set up a booth at Jackson's state fair selling antisemitic literature, and Samuel Bowers, the KKK's Imperial Wizard in Mississippi, ordered attacks on both the synagogue and Nussbaum. The position of Beth Israel's membership in Jackson was not secure; according to Murray Polner, writing in 1977, [...] "Judaism may rank higher in the moral order of the <b>Bible</b> <b>Belt</b> fundamentalists than, say, Black Christianity or Roman Catholicism, but it remains nonetheless a less–than–equal sect, and extraneous and foreign religion {{in an area of}} xenophobes." [...] Jews were unofficially excluded from membership in the Jackson Country Club, and the congregants were used to [...] "customary slights and indignities" [...] from Jackson's dominant white evangelical Protestant community.|$|E
500|$|Epstein later {{launched}} Maximus Enterprises Ltd., to try {{to capitalise}} on the merchandising boom, but as so many companies had withdrawn their interest {{in the wake of}} the Seltaeb fiasco, and Lennon had angered America's <b>bible</b> <b>belt</b> with his remark suggesting that The Beatles were [...] "more popular than Jesus", the opportunity had passed. [...] Epstein feared that the Beatles would not renew their contracts with him—due to expire in the Autumn of 1967—if they discovered the truth about Seltaeb. Epstein's problems with Seltaeb would remain with him until his death on 27 August 1967, from what was ruled an accidental overdose of a prescribed drug. Many investors had also missed out on massive profits following the cancelling of contracts, and Byrne would later claim of having received two mysterious phone calls foretelling of Epstein's death. Jacobs was found hanged in his garage on 15 December 1968. Days before his death Jacobs had asked for police protection, telling a private detective, [...] "I'm in terrible trouble, they're all after me," [...] and going on to list six well-known showbusiness people. Byrne retired to the Bahamas on his yacht, later moving to the Trowbridge area of Wiltshire.|$|E
500|$|The Beatles {{left for}} their US tour on 11 August 1966. According to Lennon's wife, Cynthia, {{he was nervous}} and upset {{that he had made}} people angry simply by expressing his opinion. The Beatles {{attended}} a press conference in Chicago, Illinois; Lennon did not want to apologise but was advised by Epstein and Barrow that he should. Lennon said that [...] "if I had said television was more popular than Jesus, I might have got away with it" [...] but stressed that he was simply remarking on how other people viewed and popularised the band. He described his own belief in God by quoting the Bishop of Woolwich, saying, [...] "not as an old man in the sky. I believe that what people call God is something in all of us." [...] Adamant that he was not comparing himself with Christ, he tried to explain the decline of Christianity in the UK. Pressed for an apology by a reporter, he said: [...] "if you want me to apologise, if that will make you happy, then OK, I'm sorry." [...] Journalists gave a sympathetic response, and told Lennon that the <b>Bible</b> <b>Belt</b> were [...] "quite notorious for their Christian attitude".|$|E

2500|$|The creation–evolution {{controversy}} {{has grown in}} importance in recent years, particularly {{as a result of}} the Southern strategy of the Republican Party strategist Kevin Phillips, during the Nixon and Reagan administrations in the U.S. He saw that the Civil Rights Movement had alienated many poor white southern voters of the <b>Bible</b> <b>Belt</b> and set out to capture this electorate through an alliance with the [...] "New Right" [...] Christian right movement.|$|E

The SGP is also very strong on the former island Urk. [...] The party scored absolute majorities in the several villages in Uddel, even 65.2% of the vote.|$|E
2500|$|Ballymena is {{described}} by some observers as being {{at the heart of}} Northern Ireland's equivalent of the <b>Bible</b> <b>Belt.</b> It has a large Protestant majority. In the early 1990s the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP)-dominated town council banned a performance by the Electric Light Orchestra in the township, saying they would attract [...] "the four Ds Drink, Drugs, Devil and Debauchery". The Council banned the screening of Brokeback Mountain (2005), starring Jake Gyllenhaal and Heath Ledger, as it featured a homosexual relationship. An impersonator of comic Roy 'Chubby' Brown was also banned.|$|E
2500|$|Up {{until the}} early mid-20th century, {{mainline}} Christian denominations within the United States showed little official resistance to evolution. Around {{the start of the}} 20th century some evangelical scholars had ideas accommodating evolution, such as B. B. Warfield who saw it as a natural law expressing God's will. By then most U.S. high-school and college biology classes taught scientific evolution, but several factors, including the rise of Christian fundamentalism and social factors of changes and insecurity in more traditionalist <b>Bible</b> <b>Belt</b> communities, led to a backlash. The numbers of children receiving secondary education increased rapidly, and parents who had fundamentalist tendencies or who opposed social ideas of what was called [...] "survival of the fittest" [...] had real concerns about what their children were learning about evolution.|$|E
2500|$|Secularization, or {{the decline}} in religiosity, first became {{noticeable}} after 1960 in the Protestant rural areas of Friesland and Groningen. Then, it spread to Amsterdam, Rotterdam and the other large cities in the west. Finally the Catholic southern areas showed religious declines. As the social distance between the Calvinists and Catholics narrowed (and they began to intermarry), it became possible to merge their parties. The Anti Revolutionary Party [...] (ARP) in 1977 merged with the Catholic People's Party (KVP) and the Protestant Christian Historical Union (CHU) to form the Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA). However, a countervailing trend later appeared {{as the result of}} a religious revival in the Protestant <b>Bible</b> <b>Belt,</b> and the growth of the Muslim and Hindu communities as a result of immigration and high fertility levels.|$|E
2500|$|After {{their arrival}} in the New World, the {{predominantly}} Presbyterian Scotch-Irish began to move further into the mountainous back-country of Virginia and the Carolinas. The establishment of many settlements in the remote back-country put a strain {{on the ability of}} the Presbyterian Church to meet the new demand for qualified, college-educated clergy. Religious groups such as the Baptists and Methodists had no higher education requirement for their clergy to be ordained, and these groups readily provided ministers to meet the demand of the growing Scotch-Irish settlements. [...] By about 1810, Baptist and Methodist churches were in the majority, and the descendants of the Scotch-Irish today remain predominantly Baptist or Methodist. [...] Vann (2007) shows the Scotch-Irish {{played a major role in}} defining the <b>Bible</b> <b>Belt</b> in the Upper South in the 18th century. He emphasizes the high educational standards they sought, their [...] "geotheological thought worlds" [...] brought from the old country, and their political independence that was transferred to frontier religion.|$|E

According to data published by the Glenmary Research Center in 2000, the denomination which has the largest number of adherents in Bartow is the Southern Baptist Convention with 27%, followed by the Roman Catholic church with 19%. Pentecostal/Charismatic churches are also prominent making up 17% of Bartow's church attendance. The Pentecostal experience known as the Lakeland revival, which attracted controversy for its claims of supernatural healing, was started up the road at the Carpenter's Home Church in Lakeland. Other churches which have a [...] presence in Bartow include the United Methodist Church at 9%, and the Episcopal and Lutheran churches with 2% apiece.

There are two Muslim mosques and a Hindu temple in the county.|$|E
2500|$|Historically, the South {{relied heavily}} on agriculture, and was highly rural until after 1945. It has since become more industrialized and urban and has {{attracted}} national and international migrants. The American South is now among the fastest-growing areas in the United States. Houston is the largest city in the Southern United States. Sociological research indicates that Southern collective identity stems from political, demographic, and cultural distinctiveness {{from the rest of}} the United States. The region contains almost all of the <b>Bible</b> <b>Belt,</b> an area of high Protestant church attendance (especially evangelical churches such as the Southern Baptist Convention) and predominantly conservative, religion-influenced politics. [...] Indeed, studies have shown that Southerners are more conservative than non-Southerners in several areas, including religion, morality, international relations and race relations. This is evident in both the region's religious attendance figures and in the region's usually strong support for the Republican Party in political elections since the 1960s, and especially since the 1990s.|$|E
2500|$|The {{newspaper}} highlighted {{four factors}} driving {{the opposition to}} the mosque: a dislike of immigrants, a fear that Christianity was losing its grip on a <b>Bible</b> <b>Belt</b> heartland, a [...] "swell of fear and hatred" [...] prompted by terrorist attacks, and the insecurity of the worst economic climate since the Great Depression. In past slumps, Chinese immigrants had been ostracized for being non-Christians, Catholics had been ostracized for being [...] "the wrong kind of Christians", and this time Muslims were suffering the brunt of prejudice. Rabbi Rami Shapiro noted that [...] "Muslims are in the way of God's plan" [...] for some anti-Muslim Christian Zionists, who believe that Muslims in Iran and Iraq will be forced out of their homes by Israeli expansion that will pave the way for the Second Coming of Jesus. Professor Ron Messier, who teaches Islamic studies and lives in Murfreesboro, commented: [...] "It's happened because this is an election year and I think there were some political candidates who thought that, here in Middle Tennessee, {{a lot of people have}} very right leanings and they could gain some political leverage by promoting fear about people who have been here for 20 years or more without ever being an issue." ...|$|E

In a letter that Edith Sitwell wrote to Pamela Hansford Johnson in 1959 she described Leavis as a tiresome, whining, pettyfogging little pipsqueak. Leavis (as Simon Lacerous) and Scrutiny (as Thumbscrew) were satirized by Frederick Crews in the chapter Another Book to Cross off your List of his lampoon of literary criticism theory The Pooh Perplex A Student Casebook. In her novel Possession, A. S.

Spock's role was used as audition material for new cast members. Nichelle Nichols was intrigued by the role when she read his lines, and asked why the character could not be female. The producers response was that Nimoy would not like it. It was during the filming of the first non-pilot episode to be shot, [...] "The Corbomite Maneuver", that under the direction of Joseph Sargent, Nimoy was directed to remain aloof during a tense moment and said the catchphrase [...] "fascinating" [...] for the first time. This moment was subsequently given by the writing staff as an example of how the character should act. Nimoy liked Spock's newly logical nature, observing that the character is [...] "struggling to maintain a Vulcan attitude, a Vulcan philosophical posture and a Vulcan logic, opposing what was fighting him internally, which was human emotion". Nimoy stated that after [...] "The Naked Time", in which a disease causes Spock to cry, [...] "I knew that we were not playing a man with no emotions, but a man who had great pride, who had learned to control his emotions and who would deny that he knew what emotions were. In a way, he was more human than anyone else on the ship." ...|$|E
