40|$|The {{optimization}} of {{flow control}} devices (FCDs) for a T-type five-strand billet caster tundish {{was carried out}} by water modeling and numerical simulation. In water modeling experiments, flow characteristics of the bare tundish and tundish configurations with designed U-type <b>baffles</b> <b>and</b> a round <b>turbulence</b> <b>inhibitor</b> were analyzed using residence time distribution (RTD) curves. Mathematical models for liquid steel in the real plant tundish were established using the fluid dynamics software package Fluent. The flow field, the temperature field, and the RTD curves of liquid steel in the proposed tundish configurations were obtained. The results of numerical simulation and water modeling were validated with each other by the predicted and experimental RTD curves. The results of flow field and temperature field were used to reflect the actual state of a real plant tundish and to choose the optimal FCD. Finally, from the whole performance of the multi-strand tundish, the optimal scheme was determined by combining the results of water modeling and numerical simulation. With the optimal tundish equipped with U-type baffle with deflector holes <b>and</b> round <b>turbulence</b> <b>inhibitor,</b> not only was the flow characteristic of each strand improved, but also the difference of flow characteristics between multiple strands was smaller...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{flow pattern}} and {{temperature}} distribution of molten steel in tundish were calculated by CFD and heat transfer method. Comparing the tundish flow {{field and the}} temperature field of empty packet <b>and</b> <b>turbulence</b> <b>inhibitor</b> installed, the role of <b>turbulence</b> <b>inhibitor</b> in tundish was analyzed, and the advantages <b>and</b> disadvantages of <b>turbulence</b> inhibiter were illuminated. The results show that: the <b>turbulence</b> <b>inhibitor</b> can eliminate the short circuit flow at tundish bottom, stabilize flow, and homogenize molten steel composition; but the <b>turbulence</b> <b>inhibitor</b> can consume energy of molten steel, and reduce the temperature of molten steel in the tundish. Without the <b>turbulence</b> <b>inhibitor,</b> the surface minimum temperature {{is far from the}} narrow corner, {{it is not easy to}} knot cold steel; installing <b>turbulence</b> <b>inhibitor</b> can raise the molten steel temperature near inlet, steel flow will scour inlet refractory intensively, service life of which shortens...|$|R
40|$|Numerical {{simulations}} {{were conducted}} to study the melt flow {{under the influence of}} control devices in a T-type two-strand bloom caster tundish via the open source Computational Fluid Dynamics software OpenFOAM. Three different cases were studied: a bare tundish, a tundish with two pairs of <b>baffles,</b> <b>and</b> a tundish equipped with a <b>turbulence</b> <b>inhibitor</b> <b>and</b> a pair of <b>baffles.</b> <b>Turbulence</b> <b>inhibitor</b> <b>and</b> <b>baffles</b> arrangement showed an improvement of the fluid flow characteristics, yielding lower values of dead volume and higher values of plug flow. With a <b>turbulence</b> <b>inhibitor,</b> the velocity of metal which flows directly toward the tundish floor is smaller <b>and</b> the <b>turbulence</b> kinetic energy of the melt top surface is lower than the other two arrangements...|$|R
40|$|Hydrodynamic {{conditions}} {{occurring in}} the tundish are strictly connected with the equipment of its working zone. On such conditions influence also many factors such as: the amount of steel present in the working zone, the veloc-ity of steel casting. In order to study these relationships the CFD simulation and physical modelling were applied. Research was carried out for the following parameters: different velocity of steel casting, bare tundish <b>and</b> tundish with <b>turbulence</b> <b>inhibitor</b> (kind of working zone equipment) {{and the amount of}} liquid steel in tundish equal 5, 5 Mg and 7, 5 Mg.

The molten steel flow velocity {{fields in the}} tundish with a <b>turbulence</b> <b>inhibitor,</b> dam, <b>and</b> weir were numerically calculated. Simulation {{results showed that the}} tundish with a <b>turbulence</b> <b>inhibitor</b> with no opened holes has similar flow characteristics to the tundish with dam and weir.

40|$|In {{continuous}} casting process, liquid steel {{flows through the}} tundish, {{which is supposed to}} operate as a continuous refining finisher. To provide a functionality of such a device, a pack of tundish metallurgy techniques must be applied, whose efficiency is conditioned especially with optimal symmetrical and dynamical melt flow. Flow optimizing can be achieved through the shaping of inside tundish configuration, using flow control devices such as <b>turbulence</b> <b>inhibitors,</b> impact pads, baffles, weirs, dams, etc. The theme of the present paper is the precise employment of a <b>turbulence</b> <b>inhibitor,</b> commercially known as TURBOSTOP(TM), together with a pair of baffles & a flat impact pad in slab custer to improve steel cleanliness and a fluid flow phenomenon in a two strands tundish...|$|R

40|$|The {{physical}} {{model of a}} ten-strand billet caster tundish was established to {{study the effects of}} various flow control devices on the melt flow. Before and after the optimization of the melt flow, the inclusion removal in the tundish was evaluated by plant trials. The {{physical model}}ing results show that when combined with a baffle, the <b>turbulence</b> <b>inhibitor,</b> instead of the impact pad, can significantly improve the melt flow. A <b>turbulence</b> <b>inhibitor</b> with a longer length of inner cavity and without an extending lip {{at the top of the}} sidewall seems to be efficient in the improvement of the melt flow. Various types <b>and</b> designs of <b>baffles</b> all influence the flow characteristics significantly. The “V” type baffles are better than the straight baffles for flow control. The “V” type baffle with four inclined holes at the sidewall away from the stopper rods is better in melt flow control than the one with one inclined hole at each sidewall. The combination of a well-designed <b>turbulence</b> <b>inhibitor</b> <b>and</b> an appropriate <b>baffle</b> shows high efficiency on improving the melt flow and an optimal proposal was presented. Plant trials indicate that, compared with the original tundish configuration in prototype, the inclusions reduce by 42 % and the inclusion distribution of individual strands is more similar with the optimal one. The optimal tundish configuration effectively improves the melt flow in the ten-strand billet caster tundish...|$|R
40|$|Culverts are rehabilitated using {{a variety}} of techniques; the {{approach}} studied in this report focuses on the use of slip liners. Slip lining refers to installing a liner pipe inside a host pipe to extend its useful life. Slip lining reduces the diameter of the culvert; however, when a smooth-walled liner [e. g., high-density polyethylene (HDPE) ] is installed in a profiled-wall pipe (e. g., corrugated metal pipe), the reduction in hydraulic roughness helps to compensate for the reduction in flow area, minimizing any reduction in discharge capacity. In some cases, the discharge capacity may increase. A smaller diameter liner, made of smoother material, will likely produce larger pipe flow velocities relative to the host culvert. High velocities can potentially create a barrier for fish passage, discouraging their use in areas sensitive to fish passage. The objective of this research was to find ways to implement slip liners and still accommodate fish passage. A 60 -ft long, 2 -ft diameter, baffled slip liner was tested at seven slopes (0 - 3. 5 %) and at three flow rates per slope (1 - 4. 6 cfs). For comparison purposes, tests were also conducted on a smooth-walled (non-baffled) liner. Baffles were found to greatly increase the potential for low-flow fish passage, allowing passage up to slopes of 3. 5 %. Conversely, the smooth-walled liner prohibited passage beyond a 1. 0 % slope. The potential drawback to using baffles in a slip-lined culvert is the reduction in culvert flow capacity. Compared to the smooth-walled liner, the baffled culvert reduced the flow capacity of the culvert by about 74 % at pressurized, full pipe flow. Finally, velocity was measured with an acoustic Doppler velocimeter (ADV) in the <b>baffled</b> culvert <b>and</b> <b>turbulence</b> values were calculated using four different methods. The Energy Dissipation Factor, or EDF, values had a close relationship with percent fish passing and if more testing is done, it {{could be used as a}} scaling factor to transfer fish passage data to other sized culverts. The results of this study, suggest that baffled slip-lined culverts can aid fish passage and are useful for culvert rehabilitation as long as the culvert can still maintain appropriate flow capacity...|$|R
40|$|The {{stirred tank}} {{is widely used}} in many {{industries}} to obtain the desired type of fluid mixing. In the context of mixing process, two different fluids and have a different properties will mix in a single equipment to produce another fluid with a new property. In this research, a new approach of stirred tank which is containing a new design of <b>baffles</b> <b>and</b> impellers was proposed for fluid mixing. The new design of <b>baffles</b> <b>and</b> impellers that proposed here are used a fractal pattern for both parts in the stirred tank. Implementing a fractal pattern for <b>baffles</b> <b>and</b> impellers in stirred tank believe will influence the flow characteristic inside the stirred tank, hence will improve a mixing performance. In order to investigate the kinds of flow properties, a Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) technique with 1 μm seeding particle was used. Four configurations were tested which are normal <b>baffles</b> <b>and</b> normal impellers, normal <b>baffles</b> <b>and</b> fractal impellers, fractal <b>baffles</b> <b>and</b> normal impellers, and the last configuration is fractal <b>baffles</b> <b>and</b> fractal impellers. In this study, dual Rushton impellers with 4 blades were used with the configurations mentioned. The result shows the significant flow field capture by PIV measurement on each configuration. By using fractal impeller some vortex are shown in the tank and high velocity vector on flow field compare with normal impeller while normal baffles gives high velocity vector depends on the configuration were used. From the results, it was showed that the fractal design can give {{a certain level of}} mixing efficiency in stirred tank. The PIV technique also gives good flow visualization {{in order to determine the}} flow pattern in stirred tank with a new concept of <b>baffles</b> <b>and</b> impellers...|$|R

To reduce the negative effect of longitudinal liquid sloshing on tankers, {{three kinds of}} transverse baffles were designed, namely, the conventional baffle, the circular <b>baffle,</b> <b>and</b> the staggered <b>baffle.</b> Each kind of baffle took several forms to investigate the impact of baffle installation angle, the sizes of holes pierced on the <b>baffle,</b> <b>and</b> their arrangement on the antisloshing effect.
