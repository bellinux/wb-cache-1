No parent should allow a young child to see this traumatizing movie; it would be a cinematic form of child abuse. Even Harrison Ford is required to slap Quan and abuse Capshaw. There are no heroes connected with the film, only two villains; their names are Steven Spielberg and George Lucas." [...] The Observer described it as [...] "a thin, arch, graceless affair."

500|$|Allegra was {{the product}} of a {{short-lived}} affair between the Romantic poet and her starstruck teenage mother, who was living in reduced circumstances in the household of her stepsister and brother-in-law. Clairmont wrote to Byron during the pregnancy begging him to write back and promise {{to take care of her}} and the baby; however, Byron ignored her pleas. After her birth, she was initially taken into the household of Leigh Hunt as the child of a cousin. A few months later the Shelleys and Clairmont took the baby back as an [...] "adopted" [...] child. Clairmont bonded with her baby daughter and wrote in her journal with delight about her close, physical connection with little Allegra, but she was also dealing with emotional and financial pressures from the Shelleys that made it difficult for her to keep the baby with her. The Shelleys were fond of Allegra, but Mary Shelley feared that neighbours would believe Percy Bysshe Shelley had fathered her as the truth about her relationship to Clairmont leaked out. William Godwin, Mary's father and Clairmont's stepfather, had immediately leaped to that conclusion when he learned of Allegra's birth. In an October 1817 letter to Percy Bysshe Shelley, Mary Shelley remarked that their toddler son William disliked Allegra, but was fond of his <b>baby</b> <b>sister</b> Clara. She saw her son's reaction to Allegra, who was no blood relation to him, as [...] "an argument in favor of those who advocate instinctive natural affection". In addition, the Shelleys were constantly in debt and Mary Shelley wanted the baby to be sent to Byron and wanted her difficult and temperamental stepsister, who had too close a relationship with her husband, to leave her house.|$|E
500|$|Upon its release, {{the album}} {{garnered}} general acclaim from critics.

[...] Steven Ivory of Billboard expressed [...] "ocally, Jackson is more aggressive than ever. Indeed, her exhibition of sass and funkiness is certainly more provocative" [...] in comparison to her previous work. NME wrote: [...] "Jackson has gone a long way in shaking off the experience of being a shadow Jackson child. She is an artist in her own right." [...] Newsweek stated [...] "n an era of big-voiced pop-soul divas... her current hit album, is taut, funky, hard as nails, an alternative to the sentimental balladry and opulent arrangements of Patti LaBelle and Whitney Houston." [...] Robert Christgau [...] "scoffed at Janet's claims of autonomy", but gave the album a B rating based on [...] "its entertainment value". Los Angeles Times critic Connie Johnson wrote: [...] "Though still a teen-ager, this singer's stance is remarkably nervy and mature. She has a snotty sort of assurance that permeates several cuts, plus the musical muscle to back it up." [...] Jon Pareles of The New York Times notes Control takes obvious influence from Prince, describing [...] "he album's pacing, its clipped vocal lines—even the spoken introduction that starts things off" [...] as pure Minneapolis sound; he adds [...] "ut where the Prince style is usually connected with heavy-breathing come-ons, Miss Jackson is cheerfully standoffish." ...|$|E

It was not until twelve or fourteen years later that I discovered that it was even as I had conjectured. At a distance of about forty miles from my home, or rather from the home of my boyhood where I no longer lived, I found a snake that was new to me, the Philodryas scotti of naturalists, a not uncommon Argentine snake, and recognized it as the same species as the one found coiled up on my little sister's rug and presumably as my mysterious black serpent.
