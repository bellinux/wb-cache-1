It has been inferred that the village was settled by people who developed agriculture near the oasis, planted palm trees, tended cattle, sheep and goats and also ventured into fishing in the Arabian Sea. The small houses they built were made of rough stone with clay or mortar as <b>binding</b> <b>material.</b> The plastered floors in the houses were said to have been spacious. Excavations also hinted that the village had streets which separated the housing complexes.|$|E
25|$|This runestone is {{carved in}} runestone style Fp and {{was raised in}} memory of Grímmundr who {{travelled}} to the east. It was discovered in 1986 at Jädra near Västerås, when stones were removed from a field. It is a lightly reddish stone which is granular and finely textured. The surface of the inscription is even but it is damaged due to flaking, making parts of the inscription difficult to read. It is 2.27 m tall, 0.9 m wide and 0.33 m thick. It is of note that the inscription when discovered still carried traces of its original colouring, which {{was determined to be}} of iron oxide but without any noticeable traces of <b>binding</b> <b>material.</b> The nuance appears to have been the same the one used by the Department of Runes when repainting runes in modern days. The stone is of historic note as it mentions the construction of a bridge on the old trail from Badelunda and lake Mälaren to the district of Dalarna.|$|E
2500|$|Beyond politics, the {{settlement}} of Indian migrants on the island resulted in a melting pot of culture, intermixing with African, Chinese, Creole, and European influences. The celebration of Hindu festivals {{has become part of}} the Mauritian calendar. A religious Hindu ceremony is held annually on the second day of November, a national holiday to commemorate the arrival of indentured laborers at the Immigration Depot to honor the jehaji bhai (Hindi for [...] "ship-mates", or [...] "ship-brother") spirits. The lake of Grand Bassin, also known as Ganga Talao, located in the center of the island has become an object of sacred pilgrimage by the Indo-Mauritians professing their Hindu faith. The Mauritian style of architecture, using lime mortar, consisting of a mixture of yogurt, egg white, butter and sesame oil, as a <b>binding</b> <b>material</b> for stone structures, also has an Indian origin. This same method of construction is being utilized by the Aapravasi Ghat Trust Fund to conserve the remnants of the Immigration Depot complex.|$|E

40|$|The article {{covers the}} {{importance}} of environmental assessments of building <b>materials.</b> Magnesium <b>binding</b> <b>materials</b> were selected as {{the subject of the}} environmental analysis. The water resistance of these materials is regarded as one of environmental criteria. Thus, {{the purpose of this paper}} is an assessment of the life cycle of additives proposed to improve the water resistance of magnesium <b>binding</b> <b>materials.</b> Redispersible polymer powder based on the copolymer of vinyl acetate and vinilversatata, polyvinyl acetate dispersion, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, oxalic acid, chrysotile asbestos, modified using concentrated sulfuric acid and micro-silica were selected for research purposes. The following findings have been generated in the course of the research: 1. Correlation between the environmental assessment of the application of modifiers with the strength test results of caustic magnesite samples in dry and saturated states is identified. 2. Organic additives classified as producing an unsatisfactory environmental impact do not significantly affect the water resistance of the caustic magnesite sample. 3. Oxalic acid, chrysotile asbestos modified using sulfuric acid and micro-silica are acceptable for magnesium <b>binding</b> <b>materials</b> in terms of their environmental analysis. 4. Micro-silica is the additive that demonstrates the best properties both in terms of its environmental analysis and in terms of improving the water resistance of magnesium <b>binding</b> <b>materials.</b> 5. Environmental analysis of the life cycle of modifiers can be recommended as an important stage in the planning of experiments aimed at improvement of properties of building materials.

Ginger nut can be also called clay limestone and Aga soil called silicious limestone. The contents of clay and SiO 2 in ginger nut and Aga soil differ from those from different regions. But whatever the contents of clay and SiO 2 in them, the raw ginger nut and Aga soil will not produce the <b>binding</b> <b>materials</b> and are not suitable for being used as building materials without being calcined.

For more than a quarter century, the materials have been utilized intensively for the <b>binding</b> <b>materials</b> for composites. The material properties of the <b>binding</b> <b>materials</b> called matrix materials play an important role for the composite material behaviors.

In particular, the goal was to develop insights as to how a molecular level structure is connected to the bulk properties of materials assuming homogeneity. To this end, molecular dynamics was used to model and simulate the polymeric behaviors. Polymeric chains were modeled using the bead and spring model along with interacting potentials. The study examined the effects of different sizes, densities, and numbers of molecules per chain on the shear moduli of the polymers. Furthermore, some preliminary study was also conducted for metallic particle reinforced polymer composites. [URL] United States Nav...|$|R

Through several magnetic separation and incubation processes, four DNA-binding materials, DAPI, 9 AA, AQ 2 A, and DNR, were successfully screened from among five candidates. Efficiency of screening was demonstrated by HPLC analysis using a C 2 / 18 reverse-phase column. In addition, their relative binding strengths were verified by measuring the melting temperature (Tm).
