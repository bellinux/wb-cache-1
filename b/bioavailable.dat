5|$|Metagenomics {{can provide}} {{valuable}} {{insights into the}} functional ecology of environmental communities. Metagenomic analysis of the bacterial consortia found in the defecations of Australian sea lions suggests that nutrient-rich sea lion faeces {{may be an important}} nutrient source for coastal ecosystems. This is because the bacteria that are expelled simultaneously with the defecations are adept at breaking down the nutrients in the faeces into a <b>bioavailable</b> form that can be taken up into the food chain.|$|E
5|$|About {{three-quarters of}} dietary calcium is from dairy {{products}} and grains, the rest being {{accounted for by}} vegetables, protein-rich foods, fruits, sugar, fats, and oil. Calcium supplementation is controversial, as the bioavailability of calcium {{is strongly dependent on}} the solubility of the salt involved: calcium citrate, malate, and lactate are highly <b>bioavailable</b> while the oxalate is much less so. The intestine absorbs about one-third of calcium eaten as the free ion, and plasma calcium level is then regulated by the kidneys. Parathyroid hormone and vitamin D promote the formation of bone by allowing and enhancing the deposition of calcium ions there, allowing rapid bone turnover without affecting bone mass or mineral content. When plasma calcium levels fall, cell surface receptors are activated and the secretion of parathyroid hormone occurs; it then proceeds to stimulate the entry of calcium into the plasma pool by taking it from targeted kidney, gut, and bone cells, with the bone-forming action of parathyroid hormone being antagonised by calcitonin, whose secretion increases with increasing plasma calcium levels.|$|E
25|$|Unlike other {{fruits and}} vegetables, where {{nutritional}} content such as vitamin C is diminished upon cooking, processing of tomatoes increases {{the concentration of}} <b>bioavailable</b> lycopene. Lycopene in tomato paste is up to four times more <b>bioavailable</b> than in fresh tomatoes. The reason is that in raw plant foods, lycopene is insoluble in water and is tightly bound to vegetable fiber. Processed tomato products such as pasteurized tomato juice, soup, sauce, and ketchup contain a higher concentration of <b>bioavailable</b> lycopene compared to raw tomatoes.|$|E
25|$|Numerous oral {{magnesium}} preparations are available. In two {{human trials}} magnesium oxide, {{one of the}} most common forms in magnesium dietary supplements because of its high magnesium content per weight, was less <b>bioavailable</b> than magnesium citrate, chloride, lactate or aspartate. Magnesium citrate has been reported as more <b>bioavailable</b> than oxide or amino-acid chelate forms.|$|E
25|$|In {{order for}} toxic {{substances}} like heavy metals to cause effects in organisms, {{they must be}} <b>bioavailable.</b> For organisms residing in contaminated sediments, the contaminants are most <b>bioavailable</b> when dissolved in the pore water, {{as opposed to being}} precipitated as a solid or sorbed to a sediment particle. Metals in the solid metal-sulfide form are thus considered non-bioavailable, and are unlikely to cause toxicity in sediment-dwelling organisms.|$|E
25|$|Aromatase inhibitors are {{typically}} given to postmenopausal women {{to lower the}} amount of <b>bioavailable</b> estrogen in their systems.|$|E
25|$|Certain 2-aminooxazoline {{compounds}} (RO5166017, RO5256390, RO5203648, and RO5263397) are orally <b>bioavailable,</b> highly potent, {{and selective}} agonists of TAAR1 in laboratory animals.|$|E
25|$|Dextromethylphenidate is {{much more}} <b>bioavailable</b> than levomethylphenidate when {{administered}} orally, and is primarily responsible for the psychoactivity of racemic methylphenidate.|$|E
25|$|Gallium {{inhibits}} RNR2 by {{substituting for}} Fe3+ {{in the active}} site. Gallium maltolate is an orally <b>bioavailable</b> form of gallium that exploits this inhibitory activity to treat cancer, infections, and other diseases.|$|E
25|$|Ionic calcium is antagonized by {{magnesium}} ions in {{the nervous}} system. Because of this, <b>bioavailable</b> supplements of magnesium, possibly including magnesium chloride, magnesium lactate, and magnesium aspartate, may increase or enhance {{the effects of}} calcium channel blockade.|$|E
25|$|The soy {{carbohydrates}} in tempeh {{become more}} digestible {{as a result}} of the fermentation process. In particular, the oligosaccharides associated with gas and indigestion are greatly reduced by the Rhizopus culture. In traditional tempeh-making shops, the starter culture often contains beneficial bacteria that produce vitamins such as B12 (though it is uncertain whether this B12 is always present and <b>bioavailable).</b> In western countries, it is more common to use a pure culture containing only Rhizopus oligosporus, which makes very little B12 and could be missing Citrobacter freundii and Klebsiella pneumoniae, which have been shown to produce significant levels of B12 analogs in tempeh when present. Whether these analogs are true, <b>bioavailable</b> B12, has not been thoroughly studied yet.|$|E
25|$|The {{tight binding}} of vitamin K1 to {{thylakoid}} membranes in chloroplasts makes it less <b>bioavailable.</b> For example, cooked spinach has a 5% bioavailability of phylloquinone, however, fat {{added to it}} increases bioavailability to 13% due to the increased solubility of vitamin K in fat.|$|E
25|$|The {{main source}} of photosynthetically derived energy is phytoplankton. Generally speaking, diatoms and microflagellates produce most of the <b>bio{{available}}</b> carbon in the estuary. Other types, notably the dinoflagellates, may produce harmful algal blooms, or red tides, that are less readily available for assimilation into the foodweb.|$|E
25|$|Human {{bioavailability}} {{of vitamin}} D2 from vitamin D2-enhanced button mushrooms via UV-B irradiation {{is effective in}} improving vitamin D status and not different from a vitamin D2 supplement. Vitamin D2 from UV-irradiated yeast baked into bread or mushrooms is <b>bioavailable</b> and increases blood levels of 25(OH)D.|$|E
25|$|While {{some studies}} have found that vitamin D3 raises 25(OH)D blood levels faster and remains active in the body longer, vs. vitamin D3: Are they one and the same?|year=2013|journal=Nutrition Bulletin - Wiley Online Library|volume=38|issue=2|pages=243–248|url = http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/nbu.12029|author=Tripkovic L|access-date = 2015-04-27|doi=10.1111/nbu.12029}} others contend that vitamin D2 sources are equally <b>bioavailable</b> and {{effective}} as D3 for raising and sustaining 25(OH)D.|$|E
25|$|Dissimilatory nitrate {{reduction}} to ammonium(DNRA), or nitrate/nitrite ammonification, is an anaerobic respirationprocess.Microbes which undertake DNRA oxidise {{organic matter}} and use nitrate as an electron acceptor, reducing it tonitrite, thenammonium(NO3−→NO2−→NH4+). Both denitrifying and nitrate ammonification bacteria will be competing for nitrate in the environment, although DNRA acts to conserve <b>bioavailable</b> nitrogen as soluble ammonium rather than producing dinitrogen gas.|$|E
25|$|Spinach {{also has}} a {{moderate}} calcium content which can be affected by oxalates, decreasing its absorption. The calcium in spinach is among the least <b>bioavailable</b> of food calcium sources. By way of comparison, the human body can absorb {{about half of the}} calcium present in broccoli, yet only around 5% of the calcium in spinach.|$|E
25|$|Saralasin was {{developed}} in the early 1970s and is an octapeptide analogue of Ang II, where the amino acids Asp1, Ile5 and Phe8 have been replaced with Ser1, Val5 and Ala8, respectively. Saralasin was not orally <b>bioavailable,</b> had short duration of action and showed partial agonist activity and therefore it was not suitable as a drug.|$|E
25|$|The {{preparation}} of maize in an alkaline solution of mineral lime or calcium hydroxide, {{used in the}} production of flour for corn tortillas, significantly enriches the nutritional value of maize as a source of vitamins, minerals and protein. The limewater used in the process adds its own <b>bioavailable</b> calcium, while it also renders the B vitamins and amino acids in maize far more easily absorbable by the human digestive system.|$|E
25|$|Fish {{are able}} to quickly metabolize and {{eliminate}} PAHs, therefore tissue residue of parent PAH compounds will not provide adequate information on exposure to the organism. PAH exposure in fish {{has been associated with}} reproductive impairment, immune deficiency, and liver lesions as well as other health problems. In contrast, invertebrates do not metabolize and excrete PAHs as efficiently as fish, therefore an investigator can better understand location and temporal patterns of <b>bioavailable</b> PAHs through tissue residue of these invertebrates.|$|E
25|$|As a food {{additive}} it is designated E170; INS number 170. Used as an acidity regulator, anticaking agent, stabiliser or colour it {{is approved}} for usage in the EU, USA and Australia and New Zealand. It {{is used in}} some soy milk and almond milk products {{as a source of}} dietary calcium; one study suggests that calcium carbonate might be as <b>bioavailable</b> as the calcium in cow's milk. Calcium carbonate is also used as a firming agent in many canned or bottled vegetable products.|$|E
25|$|Vitamin D2, or {{ergocalciferol}} {{is found}} in fungus (except alfalfa which is a plantae) and created from viosterol, {{which in turn is}} created when ultraviolet light activates ergosterol (which {{is found in}} fungi and named as a sterol from ergot). Any UV-irradiated fungus including yeast form vitamin D2. Human bioavailability of vitamin D2 from vitamin D2-enhanced button mushrooms via UV-B irradiation is effective in improving vitamin D status and not different from a vitamin D2 supplement according to study. For example, Vitamin D2 from UV-irradiated yeast baked into bread is <b>bioavailable.</b>|$|E
25|$|In animal models, it {{improves}} survival, causes tumor regression and cures {{a high percentage}} of mice. In preclinical studies utilizing patient xenografts, ABT-737 showed efficacy for treating lymphoma and other blood cancers. Because of its unfavorable pharmacologic properties ABT-737 is not appropriate for clinical trials, while its orally <b>bioavailable</b> derivative navitoclax (ABT-263) has similar activity on small cell lung cancer (SCLC) cell lines and has entered clinical trials. While clinical responses with navitoclax were promising, mechanistic dose-limiting thrombocytopoenia was observed in patients under treatment due to Bcl-xL inhibition in platelets.|$|E
25|$|One {{placebo-controlled}} {{study conducted}} in 2002 found that Juice Plus Gummie candies {{did not significantly}} improve the antioxidant status of children, as indicated by negative results from 6 different antioxidant tests. The authors explained this by saying {{it was possible that}} the supplement did not contain enough of the proper antioxidants to make a significant difference or that the antioxidants extracted in the fruit/vegetable extract were not <b>bioavailable.</b> The study was originally sponsored by NSA, but because the results were disappointing, NSA officials elected to remove the company’s name from the published article.|$|E
25|$|Bacteria are {{the chief}} agents of {{transformation}} of DOM and POM into <b>bioavailable</b> carbon through the microbial loop. This mechanism {{is particularly important}} in nutrient limited marine systems, where bacteria release nutrients from sinking detritus, allowing it to be recycled back to the photic zone. Little work {{has been applied to}} the function of the microbial loop in the San Francisco Estuary, but {{it may be that the}} role of bacteria is not critical for recycling nutrients in a eutrophic system. Rather, they may provide an alternative food chain through direct grazing by flagellates, rotifers and ciliates.|$|E
25|$|This {{compound}} is {{also used}} in fire extinguishers: obtained by the reaction of magnesium hydroxide and hydrochloric acid (HCl) in liquid form along with water in gaseous state. Magnesium chloride also is used in several medical and topical (skin related) applications. It {{has been used in}} pills as supplemental sources of magnesium, where it serves as a soluble compound that is not as laxative as magnesium sulfate, and more <b>bioavailable</b> than magnesium hydroxide and magnesium oxide, since it does not require stomach acid to produce soluble Mg2+ ion. It can also be used as an effective anesthetic for cephalopods, some species of crustaceans, and several species of bivalve, including oysters.|$|E
25|$|Harmful algal blooms (HAB's) of {{dinoflagellates}} or cyanobacteria produce toxic metabolic byproducts that render them noxious to many organisms. Fostered by {{a combination}} of high nutrient concentrations and temperatures, HAB's have a doubly negative affect on the food web by competitively excluding diatoms and microflagellates, further reducing <b>bioavailable</b> primary production. While certain invertebrates such as bivalves may not be directly affected, they may propagate toxins up the food chain, sickening or killing predators. It is not well understood how copepods are affected. The invasive algae Microcystis aeruginosa is now common in the Delta during summer months and may reduce copepod productivity (in addition to being potentially carcinogenic for humans).|$|E
25|$|Choline in food {{exists in}} either a free or esterified form (choline bound within another compound, such as phosphatidylcholine, through an ester linkage). Although all forms are most likely usable, some {{evidence}} indicates they are unequally <b>bioavailable</b> (able {{to be used by}} the body). Lipid-soluble forms (such as phosphytidylcholine) bypass the liver once absorbed, while water-soluble forms (such as free choline) enter the liver portal circulation and are generally absorbed by the liver. Both pregnancy and lactation increase demand for choline dramatically. This demand may be met by upregulation of PEMT via increasing estrogen levels to produce more choline de novo, but even with increased PEMT activity, the demand for choline is still so high that bodily stores are generally depleted. This is exemplified by the observation that Pemt -/- mice (mice lacking functional PEMT) will abort at 9–10 days unless fed supplemental choline.|$|E
25|$|Estrogens {{have been}} used in the {{treatment}} of prostate cancer. The estrogens that {{have been used}} include diethylstilbestrol, fosfestrol (diethylstilbestrol diphosphate), ethinylestradiol, ethinylestradiol sulfonate, polyestradiol phosphate, and estradiol undecylate, as well as the combined estrogenic and nitrogen mustard alkylating antineoplastic agent estramustine phosphate. Newer estrogens with improved tolerability and safety like GTx-758 have also been studied. Estrogens are effective in the treatment of prostate cancer because they are functional antiandrogens. They both suppress testosterone concentrations to castrate levels via their antigonadotropic activity and they reduce the percentage of free and <b>bioavailable</b> testosterone by increasing sex hormone-binding globulin production and levels. Estrogens {{have been found to be}} equivalent in effectiveness to androgen deprivation therapy with castration and nonsteroidal antiandrogens. However, they significantly increase cardiovascular mortality, and for this reason, are now little used in prostate cancer. Although the most commonly employed estrogens like diethylstilbestrol and ethinylestradiol are associated with increased cardiovascular mortality, it is notable that certain estrogens, namely polyestradiol phosphate, have been found not to do so; this is attributed to different degrees of effect of the various estrogens on hepatic protein synthesis.|$|E
25|$|Sanofi-Aventis {{developed}} glargine as a longer-lasting insulin analogue, {{and markets}} {{it under the}} trade name Lantus. It was created by modifying three amino acids. Two positively charged arginine molecules {{were added to the}} C-terminus of the B-chain, and they shift the isoelectric point from 5.4 to 6.7, making glargine more soluble at a slightly acidic pH and less soluble at a physiological pH. Replacing the acid-sensitive asparagine at position 21 in the A-chain by glycine is needed to avoid deamination and dimerization of the arginine residue. These three structural changes and formulation with zinc result in a prolonged action when compared with biosynthetic human insulin. When the pH 4.0 solution is injected, most of the material precipitates and is not <b>bioavailable.</b> A small amount is immediately available for use, and the remainder is sequestered in subcutaneous tissue. As the glargine is used, small amounts of the precipitated material will move into solution in the bloodstream, and the basal level of insulin will be maintained up to 24 hours. The onset of action of subcutaneous insulin glargine is somewhat slower than NPH human insulin. It is clear solution as there is no zinc in formula.|$|E
2500|$|Chemically, {{curcumin}} is a diarylheptanoid, {{belonging to}} the group of curcuminoids, which are natural phenols responsible for turmeric's yellow color. It is a tautomeric compound existing in enolic form in organic solvents, and as a keto form in water. Although thoroughly studied in laboratory and clinical studies, curcumin has no confirmed medical uses, and has proved frustrating to scientists who state that it is unstable, not <b>bioavailable,</b> and unlikely to produce useful leads for drug development.|$|E
2500|$|The {{solubilization}} of ferric ions, at {{or below}} near neutral pH can be accomplished using EDTA. [...] This property is useful in agriculture including hydroponics. However, given the pH dependence of ligand formation, EDTA is not helpful for improving Fe solubility in above neutral soils. [...] Otherwise, at near-neutral pH and above, iron(III) forms insoluble salts, which are less <b>bioavailable</b> to susceptible plant species. [...] Aqueous − is used for removing ("scrubbing") hydrogen sulfide from gas streams. [...] This conversion is achieved by oxidizing the hydrogen sulfide to elemental sulfur, which is non-volatile: ...|$|E
2500|$|Genotoxic {{carcinogens}} interact {{directly with}} DNA and genetic material or indirectly by their reactive metabolites. Toxicants such as PAHs can be genotoxic carcinogens to aquatic organisms. [...] PAHs are widely {{spread throughout the}} environment through the incomplete burning of coal, wood, or petroleum products. Although PAHs do not bioaccumulate in vertebrate tissue, many studies have confirmed that certain PAH compounds such as benzo(a)pyrene, benz(a)anthracene, and Benzofluoranthene, are <b>bioavailable</b> and responsible for liver diseases like cancer in wild fish populations. One mechanism of action for genotoxic carcinogens includes the formation of DNA adducts. Once the PAH compound enters an organism, it becomes metabolized and available for biotransformation.|$|E
2500|$|Asphalt is {{basically}} an inert material {{that must be}} heated or diluted {{to a point where}} it becomes workable for the production of materials for paving, roofing, and other applications. In examining the potential health hazards associated with asphalt, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) determined that it is the application parameters, predominantly temperature, that affect occupational exposure and the potential <b>bioavailable</b> carcinogenic hazard/risk of the asphalt emissions. In particular, temperatures greater than 199°C (390°F), were shown to produce a greater exposure risk than when asphalt was heated to lower temperatures, such as those typically used in asphalt pavement mix production and placement. IARC has classified asphalt as a Class 2B possible carcinogen.|$|E
2500|$|Ozonation – {{a process}} of infusing water with ozone – {{can be used in}} {{aquaculture}} to facilitate organic breakdown. Ozone is also added to recirculating systems to reduce nitrite levels through conversion into nitrate. If nitrite levels in the water are high, nitrites will also accumulate in the blood and tissues of fish, where it interferes with oxygen transport (it causes oxidation of the heme-group of haemoglobin from ferrous (...) to ferric (...) , making haemoglobin unable to bind [...] ). Despite these apparent positive effects, ozone use in recirculation systems has been linked to reducing the level of <b>bioavailable</b> iodine in salt water systems, resulting in iodine deficiency symptoms such as goitre and decreased growth in Senegalese sole (Solea senegalensis) larvae.|$|E
2500|$|Zinc {{deficiency}} {{is typically}} {{the result of}} inadequate dietary intake of zinc, disease states that promote zinc losses, or physiological states that require increased zinc. Populations that consume primarily plant based diets that are low in <b>bioavailable</b> zinc often have zinc deficiencies. Diseases or conditions that involve intestinal malabsorption promote zinc losses. [...] Fecal losses of zinc caused by diarrhea are one contributing factor, often common in developing countries. Changes in intestinal tract absorbability and permeability due, in part, to viral, protozoal, and bacteria pathogens may also encourage fecal losses of zinc. Physiological states that require increased zinc include periods of growth in infants and {{children as well as}} in mothers during pregnancy.|$|E
