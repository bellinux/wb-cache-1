The situation is particularly critical when access control policies are many and complex. In these cases, programmers of <b>business</b> <b>logics</b> can hardly master the established access control policies. Now we consider situations where <b>business</b> <b>logics</b> are built with tools such as JDBC and ODBC. These tools convey two sources of security threats: 1) the use of unauthorized Create, Read, Update and Delete (CRUD) expressions and also 2) the modification of data previously retrieved by Select statements. To overcome this security gap when Role-based access control policies are used, we propose an extension to the basic model in order to control the two sources of security threats. Finally, we present a software architectural model from which distributed and typed RBAC mechanisms are automatically built, this way relieving programmers from mastering any security schema. We demonstrate empirical evidence of the effectiveness of our proposal from a use case based on Java and JDBC.

25|$|Many {{people use}} the terms Internet and World Wide Web, or just the Web, interchangeably, but the two terms are not synonymous. The World Wide Web is the primary {{application}} program that billions of people use on the Internet, and it has changed their lives immeasurably. However, the Internet provides many other services. The Web is a global set of documents, images and other resources, logically interrelated by hyperlinks and referenced with Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs). URIs symbolically identify services, servers, and other databases, and the documents and resources that they can provide. Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is the main access protocol of the World Wide Web.

That said, as Madonna's first live CD, I'm Going to Tell You a Secret is strong and entertaining, {{and even if the}} excessive minutiae on the accompanying DVD means only hardcore fans will sit through its two hours, it's also quite well done." [...] Sterdan from Jam! complimented the CD section of the release, saying that [...] "Thankfully, the CD takes up the slack, delivering more than an hour of newer fare like 'American Life' and 'Music', peppered with oldies like 'Vogue', 'Holiday' and 'Like a Prayer'. Next time Madonna wants to share a secret, she should just leave the cameras at home." [...] Conversely, Sébastien Chicoine from Canoe.ca website preferred the DVD over the CD, saying that the disc was not [...] "absolutely necessary" [...] but could understand the <b>business</b> <b>logic</b> behind adding the CD to the release.|$|E
500|$|Two {{professors at}} the Goizueta Business School at Emory University {{summarized}} their research in a New York Times editorial. They found that studies of college {{teams that have}} changed their names and mascots indicate that doing so has a long-term financial benefit. While vocal opponents of change often threatened withdrawal of support, this never materialized. There have been no name changes by professional teams, though a comparison of NFL teams shows the highest negative trend in brand equity affects the Washington Redskins and the Kansas City Chiefs, calling into question the <b>business</b> <b>logic</b> of retaining Native American names or logos that are offensive to even a minority. In a commentary for Forbes, Tom Van Riper states that research specifically considering the fan loyalty and traditions of the team indicates {{that the value of}} the name as a brand is significant, and unlikely to change for business reasons. An alternative opinion is that the team would benefit from a re-branding, but any new name would need to be carefully selected. In 2014 sales of Redskins merchandise declined 35% from the prior year. [...] "People are having a second thoughts about wearing a T-shirt with the logo or name that it has now been called racist," [...] said Matt Powell, senior analyst for SportsSourceOne. A team spokesman attributed the decline to dismal performance in the 2013 season, but other teams with bad records have not seen such a steep decline in sales. Corporate sponsors have either made no public response to media inquiries regarding the name or stated that they play no role in the decision, and defer to the team and the NFL. Despite the name controversy, the value of the team has risen $700 million to $2.4 billion (40%), making them the third most valuable franchise in the NFL, based upon the valuations published by Forbes magazine in 2014 and 2015.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{necessity}} for better performance drives service orchestration towards decentralization. There {{is a recent}} approach where the integrator - that traditionally centralizes all corporative services and <b>business</b> <b>logics</b> - remains as a repository of interface services, but now lacks to know all <b>business</b> <b>logics</b> and <b>business</b> workflows. There are several techniques using this recent approach, including hybrid solutions, peer-to-peer solutions and trigger-based mechanisms. A more flexible approach regarding environment configuration and not fully explored in services orchestration technology {{is the use of}} intelligent mobile agents to execute it. In this paper, we present new adaptive heuristics for mobile agents to execute the decentralization of orchestration through missions (services) that correspond to the stages of business flow, with the ability to trade-off the quality of the result with the deadline of the mission.

40|$|Most of the {{security}} threats in relational database applications have their source in client-side systems when they issue requests formalized by Create, Read, Update and Delete (CRUD) expressions. If tools such as ODBC and JDBC are used to develop <b>business</b> <b>logics,</b> then there is another source of threats. In some situations the content of data sets retrieved by Select expressions can be modified and then committed into the host databases. These tools are agnostic regarding not only database schemas but also regarding the established access control policies. This situation can hardly be mastered by programmers of <b>business</b> <b>logics</b> in database applications with many and complex access control policies. To overcome this gap, we extend the basic Role-Based Access policy to support and supervise the two sources of security threats. This extension is then used to design the correspondent RBAC model. Finally, we present a software architectural model from which static RBAC mechanisms are automatically built, this way relieving programmers from mastering any schema.

He had not lost his look of concentrated power, nor his determination to fight. A struggle {{between himself and the}} phantoms of the past had become now a necessary stimulus for its own sake,--for the sake of his mental and physical equipoise. He saw before him the pale, agitated, irresolute features of 'Lige Curtis,--not the man HE had injured, but the man who had injured HIM, whose spirit was aimlessly and wantonly--for he had never attempted to get back his possessions in his lifetime, nor ever tried to communicate with the possessor--striking at him in the shadow. And it was THAT man, that pale, writhing, frightened wretch whom he had once mercifully helped! Yes, whose LIFE he had even saved that night from exposure and delirium tremens when he had given him the whiskey. And this life he had saved, only to have it set in motion a conspiracy to ruin him! Who knows that 'Lige had not purposely conceived what they had believed to be an attempt at suicide, only to cast suspicion of murder on HIM! From which it will be perceived that Harcourt's powers of moral reasoning had not improved in five years, and that even the impartiality he had just shown in his description of 'Lige to Grant had been swallowed up in this new sense of injury. The founder of Tasajara, whose cool <b>business</b> <b>logic,</b> unfailing foresight, and practical deductions were never at fault, was once more childishly adrift in his moral ethics.|$|E

The enforcement of usage control requirements is a challenge because the service requester in general has no control over the service provider’s information processing devices.
