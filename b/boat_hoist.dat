It {{occupied}} converted naval premises until a clubhouse was built, which was opened in June 2005 by the Princess Royal. £7.85 million of funding for the project was donated by charities, individuals and local councils; the National Lottery donated £3 million in 2003, and the South West Regional Development Agency added £3.34 million. The academy's aims are to promote the sport of sailing {{at all levels of}} competence and ability, through courses, training and events, and to contribute to the economic regeneration of the area. Since opening it has created a demand in service and marine industries worth around £10 million. WPNSA continues to promote sailing to local schools, offering benefits such as free <b>boat</b> <b>hoist</b> and storage. Use of the facilities and access to training is open to anyone in return for an annual membership fee. On 6 July 2005, London was chosen to host the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games, and the WPNSA was chosen to host the sailing events.|$|E

50|$|The key to {{the success}} of the system was the {{mechanisation}} of the transshipments.

50|$|Originally {{the club}} {{meetings}} {{were held in}} members' homes, but they soon adopted the Officer's saloon of the steam schooner, Santa Barbara. Club meetings had to be scheduled at low tide {{due to the fact}} that the Santa Barbara was beached in mud at the south end of the Sausalito Yacht Harbor. Later on the members rented the former clubhouse of the San Francisco Yacht Club on the Sausalito waterfront (future home of the Trident, then the Horizons restaurants). After the end of World War II, the club moved to a wood frame building at the south end of the yacht harbor. A small <b>boat</b> <b>hoist</b> and dry boat storage helped the club to grow and host regattas for the Small Boat Racing Association (SBRA). The club decided it needed a permanent clubhouse, and signed a lease with J. H. Madden Sr. of Madden and Lewis Corp. for a site on the water at the former Northwestern Pacific passenger train railhead for the Sausalito to San Francisco ferry, which had been abandoned after the completion of the Golden Gate Bridge in May 1937. The club called on the talents and labor of members to design and build the clubhouse. Club members, along with a pile driver and operator supplied by Madden and Lewis, drove all of the piles for the clubhouse over the weekend of December 6-7, 1958. Member Ted Boutmy designed the clubhouse and a contractor was hired to build it. The cluhouse was completed and dedicated on September 24, 1960.|$|E
40|$|While {{the sites}} of Forbes' Quarry and Devil's Tower are, respectively, unpromising and {{probably}} too dangerous for further excavation, {{there are several other}} sites on the Rock preserving evidence of Neanderthal activities. One, Ibex Cave, lies high up on the eastern face of the Rock, while four others lie to the southeast, close to the sea near 'Governor's Beach'. The present beach mainly consists of fine limestone blast debris from military tunnelling operations, but there are also cemented remnants of more ancient beaches which presumably accumulated during Oxygen Isotope Stage 5. The caves are named (from the south) Bennett's, Gorham's, Vanguard and <b>Boat</b> <b>Hoist.</b> Three of these caves (Ibex, Gorham's and Vanguard) have been excavated since 1994 as part of the Gibraltar Caves Project; some of the initial results of this work are presented below. Further details will appear in the proceedings of the Gibraltar conference held in August to celebrate the 150 th anniversary of the finding of the Forbes' Quarry skull (Stringer et al. in preparation). The excavations at Gorham's and Vanguard Caves are already beginning to yield significant results relating to the palaeontological, archaeological and palaeoenvironmental aspects of the Neanderthals and their modern human successors. The integration of new AMS and other dating results with sediments analysis should help us compare the sequences in both caves and to provide frameworks for situating human behaviour. For example, {{it would be interesting to}} know whether changes in sea level and resulting reconfiguration of the coastal plain were major factors responsbile in the Neanderthal exploitation of highly local raw materials for tool-making and the frequency of gathering of marine/estuarine foods. Using this information and comparing the archaeological evidence from the Middle and Upper Palaeolithic levels at the sites will help to place the Gibraltar finds in their European and Mediterranean contexts...|$|E

40|$|Storage {{space in}} sport and {{competitive}} rowing sheds is limited. The use of racking is common to improve the utilisation of available floor space. This project aims to develop a hoisting system suitable for the vertical storage of the small boats (tinnies) that are used for coaching and other functions in the sport. A search of available <b>boat</b> <b>hoists</b> revealed numerous manufactures and designs mainly in the United States. It seems the American people use <b>boat</b> <b>hoists</b> {{in the same way}} as we use boat trailers in Australia. These existing hoist products are used for out of water storage of small boats and are usually mounted lake side or attached to a wharf structure. None of the hoists located are capable of storing more than one boat vertically. A new type of hoist will be required. Due to the time available for the design work this project has focused on researching hoist requirements and design and is restricted to the hoisting system. The hoisting system is an integral part of the overall hoist structure therefore some preliminary design work of the hoist structure has also be undertaken. Additional work to be completed before prototype fabrication is the design of the lifting arm guides and bearing assemblies and the design of the hoist frame structure. Firm commercial interest exists in this product and for other storage solutions based upon this hoist...|$|R

It was the OROHENA, owned by Toriki, the half-caste trader, who served as his own supercargo and who doubtlessly was even then in the stern sheets of the boat. Huru-Huru chuckled. He knew that Mapuhi owed Toriki for trade goods advanced the year before.|$|R

50|$|The {{lighthouse}} was put {{in service}} in 1858, automated in 1960, and is still in operation. The foundation is iron pilings with disks, and the tower is a skeletal octagonal pyramid of cast iron. It is a 142 ft tall brown painted tower. It has two platforms. The lower one, 15 ft above the water, held water and fuel tanks, the generator (after the light was electrified), <b>boat</b> <b>hoists</b> and a workshop. The upper platform, 40 ft above the water, held the quarters for the staff. The original lens, a first-order Fresnel lens, is now {{on display in the}} Key West Lighthouse Museum.

As soon as this was done all hands set to work washing down the decks; and in two or three hours, except for the bullet marks on the deck and bulwarks, there were no signs left of the desperate conflict that had raged on board the Flying Scud.

Near by, the Cetacea lay plunging with her staysail up, while a dark figure on her deck flashed a lantern. Jimmy shook hands with Aynsley and sprang up on the rail; then, leaning out, seized a davit-fall and slid swiftly down. A man released the tackle-hook and pushed off the gig; the oars splashed and a sea swept {{her away from the}} yacht. In a few minutes Jimmy jumped on board the sloop and helped Moran to cast off the hawser while the gig struggled back. Another flare was burning, and he saw the <b>boat</b> <b>hoisted</b> in.

The flats are still uncovered, but the tide is rising fast in the winding channel leading up to the village. In a few minutes there will be water enough for the boats, and already these can be seen leaving the bawleys and making for the mouth of the channel. The wind is fair, and each <b>boat</b> <b>hoists</b> its sail, white or yellow or brown, and with the crew sitting up to windward comes flying along the shallow channel, making, as they always do, a race of it home.|$|R

Mr Vernon's <b>boat</b> <b>hoisted</b> its sail and set off before the wind, until at 1010 hrs his crew sighted the Third Officer's boat several miles to the southwest. They tried to steer towards it, but the heavy weather prevented them. At 1230 hrs Vernon abandoned the attempt and altered course to the southeast. At 1700 hrs he ordered the sail lowered and the boat to heave to with her sea anchor. At 2300 hrs the rudder broke off at the top pintle, so two of Vernon's men used an oar as an improvised and unsatisfactory steering oar. On 25 October the weather was still wild so Mr Vernon's boat drifted before the wind with her sea anchor and sail.|$|R
