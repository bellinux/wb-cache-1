40|$|An educator’s {{professor}} {{has been}} underestimated by Greek society (low salaries, hard working conditions, lack of <b>baching</b> materials, work load etc). The educator {{is the person}} who transmits tradition, knowledge and ideals of a society to the younger generation. Nowadays, however, access to cultural capital, information and knowledge {{has become part of the}} social hierarchy and has to do with variables, such as social evolution and professional security. The educator is part of this socialization process young people go through and has a heavier burden to bear, since he/she works under the most stressful circumstances (that is having to face parents’ expectations, achieve educational aims, deal with children with special needs or learning difficulties, changes in the educational system and new information), which may lead to a burn-out. Factors such as job satisfaction, anxiety and exhaustion influence teacher’s teaching performance, as well as his or her dedication to education and school environment. In this study, an attempt has been made to develop a school adaptation scale and eventually to administer it to school executives, psychologists and educators, in order to measure school adaptation draw conclusions on this matter...|$|E

The autograph is the continuo part of the cantata Alles nur nach Gottes Willen, BWV 72. It is, like most hand-written instrumental parts for <b>Bach's</b> cycles of cantatas, a collaborative work: the right hand side of the sheet on display (chorus, recitative) was written by <b>Bach's</b> student and nephew Johann Heinrich <b>Bach</b> (the son of <b>Bach's</b> older brother Johann Christoph <b>Bach</b> from Ohrdruf), the upper left hand side (air) was written by <b>Bach's</b> wife Anna Magdalena <b>Bach,</b> and the music of the final chorale, along with all titles, subtitles, and some corrections up to the word Fine, are in the hand of Johann Sebastian <b>Bach.</b> On an audio station next to the autograph, the history of the cantata is explained and the speaker leads through all parts of the music on the sheet.
