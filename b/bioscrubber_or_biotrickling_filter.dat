40|$|Trickling bed biofilters (<b>or</b> <b>biotrickling</b> <b>filters,</b> BTFs) are {{biological}} systems for polluted air treatment. Hydrodynamics of BTFs, and reactors in general, is {{of paramount importance}} for obtaining good performances. In fact, a non-uniform distribution of the pollutant into the bed brings to dead zones or bypass which reduce the bed working volume and, therefore, cause low removal efficiencies. The paper presents the preliminary results obtained regarding the aeraulic behavior of a BTF pilot plant with seashells as packing material. Experimental results of bed void fraction and pressure drop at several flow rates were used to obtain Ergun equation coefficients for dry bed.

40|$|Advanced {{life support}} systems for long-duration space {{missions}} will require efficient recycling of water and air. Biological treatment systems {{may be used as}} the initial process in a multistep recycling system. Biofilm reactors (<b>or</b> <b>biotrickling</b> <b>filters)</b> {{have been shown to be}} effective for treatment of air and water. A major design consideration for these reactors is the selection of biofilm support media. The main objective of this research was to evaluate the effect of three commercially available support media on biofilm activity. Biofilm activity was quantified in terms of microbial respiration, or specifically, carbon dioxide production. Results indicate that carbon mineralization did not differ significantly between media types when data were evaluated based on media volume. However, there was a significant difference in microbial activity when assessed with media surface area as an input value. The results suggest that suspended microorganisms may have contributed significantly to the carbon mineralization in the reactor. Therefore, when predicting performance of submerged biofilm reactors, liquid or media volume should be used as a key model parameter rather than media surface area. This information could prove to be useful when selecting support media and reactor volume for biofilm graywater treatment reactors. 2 ̆ 2 Description: 5 page...|$|R
40|$|Odour {{control systems}} in {{wastewater}} collection systems are typically designed to remove hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S); however other compounds in sewer related foul air {{also lead to}} odour complaints. Methyl mercaptan and dimethyl sulfide are rarely investigated for performance in these treatment systems despite being key odorants. Volatile organic compounds readily occur and rarely contribute substantially to odour impact, but could affect the removal of other more odorous compounds. The most common odour control systems are biologically based (biofilters <b>or</b> <b>biotrickling</b> <b>filters)</b> <b>or</b> adsorption based (predominantly activated carbon). Samples on the inlet and outlet of 10 activated carbon systems, 5 biofilters and 3 <b>biotrickling</b> <b>filters</b> across Sydney, Melbourne and Perth in Australia were taken approximately every month for 18 months. Samples were analysed {{for a wide range}} of volatile organic and sulfurous compounds as well as H 2 S. The collected data were filtered for warm and non-warm periods, wet weather, and for those where data points were greater than three times the standard deviation over the average (known as ‘spikes’). Performance of treatment systems were analysed under these conditions. An analysis of the most common volatile organic and sulfurous compounds on the inlet samples found that there was no clear relationship between any compounds, meaning that when sampling sewer foul air, all key odorants needed to be tested. All treatment system types perform well at H 2 S removal. Activated carbon systems exhibited the poorest and most variable treatment of non-H 2 S based compounds, particularly halogenated volatile organics; however treatment of most compounds improved during spike conditions. Biofilters generally showed the most stable and greatest removal of non-H 2 S based compounds; however treatment deteriorated during spike conditions. In selecting an odour treatment technology, the concentration and variability of contaminants, treatment required and the space available, allow the most efficient technology selection to be made. Two stage processes are generally required for high level treatments whilst single stages are appropriate for lower treatments. Biofilters are generally preferred as the first (or only) stage, with <b>biotrickling</b> <b>filters</b> used where space is constrained. Activated carbon is suitable for low load scenarios or as a polishing filter...|$|R

Wet biomass for-mation in 23. 6 -L reactors over a 77 -day period was reduced from 13. 875 kg in a control <b>biotrickling</b> <b>filter</b> to 11. 795 kg in a <b>biotrickling</b> <b>filter</b> enriched with protozoa. The average toluene vapor elimination capacity at 1 g/m 3 toluene and 64 m 3 /(m 3 ? h) was 31. 1 g/(m 3 ? h) in the con-trol and 32. 2 g/(m 3 ? h) in the <b>biotrickling</b> <b>filter</b> enriched with protozoa. At higher toluene inlet concentrations, toluene degradation rates increased and were slightly higher in the <b>biotrickling</b> <b>filter</b> enriched with protozoa. The lower rate of biomass accumulation after the addi-tion of protozoa was due to an increase of carbon min-eralization (68 % as compared to 61 % in the control). Ap-parent biomass yield coefficients in the control and en-riched trickling filter were 0. 72 and 0. 59 g dry biomass/g toluene, respectively. The results show that protozoan predation may be a useful tool to control biomass in <b>biotrickling</b> <b>filters,</b> however, further stimulation of preda-tion of the biomass immobilized in the reactor is required to ensure long-term stability of <b>biotrickling</b> <b>filters.</b> © 199...|$|R

The performance of 20 identically operated rotating <b>biotrickling</b> <b>filters</b> was reproducible with an average toluene elimination capacity of 79. 4 g m- 3 h- 1 (stand. dev. = 5. 7) at an empty bed residence time of 45 s and a toluene inlet gas phase concentration of 1. 6 g m- 3. At gas and liquid cocurrent operation, the toluene elimination capacity of rotating <b>biotrickling</b> <b>filters</b> was 20 % higher than at countercurrent operation. This was probably caused by greater mass transfer limitation resulting from increased wetting of the biofilm during countercurrent operation. Performance versus load curves of rotating and of conventional <b>biotrickling</b> <b>filters</b> were comparable with non-zero order removal at toluene inlet concentrations lower than 2 g m- 3.

Biofilters and <b>biotrickling</b> <b>filters</b> use microbial populations in biofilms that grow on support media to degrade or transform contaminants in the air. The <b>biotrickling</b> <b>filter</b> employed in the pilot study used a synthetic fibrous support media to immobilize the biofilm. A pilot study was conducted from September 1997 to February 1998, to assess the performance of <b>biotrickling</b> <b>filter</b> technology in treating organic emissions from bakery ovens. Bench-scale studies were conducted to determine the effectiveness of the support media and develop initial estimates of <b>biotrickling</b> <b>filter</b> performance. Pilot studies were performed with USEPA’s trailer mounted two-stage <b>biotrickling</b> <b>filter</b> system, at flowrates in the range of 1. 8 - 3. 0 standard cubic meters per minute (65 - 104 standard cubic feet per minute). Removal efficiencies in the range of 80 % to 100 % were measured experimentally, and averaged 91 % over the duration of the study. The pilot-scale biofilter produced removal efficiencies exceeding 80 % for about 99. 6 % of its operating time. The pressure drop across the bed was less than 6. 4 millimeters (0. 25 inches) of water. The test further revealed that the <b>biotrickling</b> <b>filter</b> was quite robust; it responded quickly to changes in inlet concentration and exhibited a recovery time of less than 150 minutes after a nine day shutdown period.

40|$|In the {{industrial}} operation of <b>biotrickling</b> <b>filters</b> for hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S) removal, shock loads or starvation was common due to process variations or equipment malfunctions. In this study, effects of starvation and shock loads {{on the performance}} of <b>biotrickling</b> <b>filters</b> for H 2 S removal were investigated. Four experiments were conducted to evaluate the changes of biomass and viable bacteria numbers in the <b>biotrickling</b> <b>filters</b> during a 24 -d starvation. Compared to biomass, viable bacteria numbers decreased significantly during the starvation, especially when airflow was maintained in the absence of spray liquid. During the subsequent re-acclimation, all the bioreactors could resume high removal efficiencies within 4 d regardless of the previous starvation conditions. The results show that the re-acclimation time, in the case of <b>biotrickling</b> <b>filters</b> for H 2 S removal, is mainly controlled by viable H 2 S oxidizing bacteria numbers. On the other hand, the <b>biotrickling</b> <b>filters</b> can protect against shock loads in inlet fluctuating H 2 S concentration after resuming normal operation.

40|$|A set of {{bench scale}} <b>biotrickling</b> <b>filters</b> were {{designed}} and operated for simultaneous treatment of graywater and waste containing {{elevated levels of}} ammonia (NH 3) and hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S). Preliminary experiments were conducted to optimize graywater processing in the reactors. While surfactants have been considered to be readily biodegradable, removal of carbon from graywater was {{not as high as}} expected during preliminary experiments when no waste gas was supplied to the system. Removal efficiency was not improved after several modifications to reactor design and it was hypothesized that complete removal of surfactants and their relevant biodegradation metabolites was a challenge. Therefore, surfactant biodegradation was studied in detail. Experimental work showed that while all three surfactants exhibited rapid primary biodegradation, biodegradation of by secondary byproducts was very slow. In the case of the amphoteric surfactant, disodium cocoamphodiacetate, biodegradation byproducts seemed to be recalcitrant. A mathematical model was developed to describe the <b>biotrickling</b> <b>filter</b> processes and this model was used to conduct a sensitivity analysis so that governing processes within the <b>biotrickling</b> <b>filter</b> could be determined. Important design parameters were elucidated as well as parameters inherent to the system, or intrinsic parameters.

40|$|Biological {{treatment}} is an emerging {{technology for the}} treatment of publicly owned treatment works (POTWs) off-gases. Most of POTWs off-gases contain H 2 S and a wide range of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Since co-treatment of odors and VOCs in <b>biotrickling</b> <b>filters</b> is a relatively unexplored area, the simultaneous biotreatment of H 2 S and toluene (as the model VOC) was investigated. The experimental setup included two identical <b>biotrickling</b> <b>filters,</b> one operated at pH 4. 5 and the other one was operated at pH 7. 0. High concentrations of H 2 S (up to 170 ppmv) and toluene (up to 2. 2 g m− 3) were supplied to determine the influence of the pH on the maximum performance. A rapid startup (a few days) was observed for both toluene and H 2 S removal in the neutral-pH <b>biotrickling</b> <b>filter.</b> In the acidic <b>biotrickling</b> <b>filter,</b> toluene degradation also started immediately but at a lower rate. However, after several weeks of operation, the toluene elimination capacity (EC) at low pH reached a steady value identical to this found in the neutral-pH <b>biotrickling</b> <b>filter.</b> H 2 S did not affect toluene degradation at concentrations up to 170 ppmv at either pH. At a volumetric load of 100 m 3 m− 3 h− 1, maximum elimination capacities of 70 g toluene m− 3 h− 1 (at 1. 7 g m− 3 toluene) and 20 g H 2 S m− 3 h− 1 (at 170 ppmv H 2 S, the highest concentration tested) were observed.

Both the ceramic material adsorption capacity and the removal capacity of the liquid were limited and saturated in 540 min and 2 min operation, respectively. To obtain the best operation conditions for the <b>biotrickling</b> <b>filter,</b> orthogonal experiments (L 9 (34)) were designed. The experimental data were analyzed by the signal to noise (S/N) ratio and ANOVA. The optimal conditions of the <b>biotrickling</b> <b>filter</b> occurred at a temperature of 40 ℃, a pH of 8. 0  0. 05 and a chemical oxygen demand (COD) of 165 mg/L in the recycled water with no oxygen in the system. Inlet oxygen concentration was found to be the most significant factor of the <b>biotrickling</b> <b>filter</b> that has a significant negative effect on the NO removal efficiency. The DNA sequencing of four clones of bacteria showed 93 - 98 % similarity to Pseudomonas mendocina strain. This strain has been analysed by full gene sequencing and proved to be a brand-new strain named as Pseudomonas mendocina DLHK. This strain can transfer nitrate to organic nitrogen. This result indicated the assimilation nitrogen process in this system and suggested that the main nitrogen removal capacity in this system was through biological function. Through the isotope experimental analysis, two intermediate products (15 NO and 15 N 2 O) have been found during the biological process of the system by using quantitative gas analysis (QGA). These results indicated the denitrification function in this <b>biotrickling</b> <b>filter.</b> A model was developed to explain the biological process in the <b>biotrickling</b> <b>filter.</b> The averaged error of the measured and modeled data is - 0. 047. The standard deviation of the error is 0. 039. The model prediction is in good agreement with the experimental data, particularly at small packing height. Most NO removal capacity was achieved at the first 5 cm packing material. The effects of the axial interstitial velocity and the biofilm coverage to the NO elimination were studied by the model that provided a basic for the design of a <b>biotrickling</b> <b>filter.</b> The <b>biotrickling</b> <b>filter</b> could be used for exhaust gases treatment. The assimilation function in the biological system could be another way to utilize the nitrogen component in the waste gas from harmful to benign nature. The isotope labeling technology is a new method to detect gas components for complex gas samples. published_or_final_versionMechanical EngineeringDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R

40|$|The {{evolution}} of the microbial community was analysed over one year in two <b>biotrickling</b> <b>filters</b> operating under intermittent feeding conditions and treating isopropanol emissions, a pollutant typically found in the flexography sector. Each reactor was packed with one media: plastic cross-flow-structured material or polypropylene rings. The communities were monitored by {{fluorescence in situ hybridization}} (FISH) and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis of the 16 S rRNA region. After inoculation with activated sludge, the <b>biotrickling</b> <b>filters</b> were operated using inlet loads (ILs) from 20 to 65 gCm− 3 h− 1 and empty-bed residence times (EBRTs) from 14 to 160 s. Removal efficiencies higher than 80 % were obtained with ILs up to 35 gCm− 3 h− 1 working at EBRTs as low as 24 s. There was an increase in the total percentage of the target domains of up to around 80 % {{at the end of the}} experiment. Specifically, the Gammaproteobacteria domain group, which includes the well-known volatile organic compound (VOC) -degrading species such as Pseudomonas putida, showed a noticeable rise in the two <b>biotrickling</b> <b>filters</b> of 26 % and 27 %, respectively. DGGE pattern band analysis revealed a stable band of Pseudomonas putida in all the samples monitored, even in the lower diversity communities. In addition, at similar operational conditions, the <b>biotrickling</b> <b>filter</b> with a greater relative abundance of Pseudomonas sp. (19. 2 % vs. 8 %) showed higher removal efficiency (90 % vs. 79 %).

40|$|Abstract: The {{pilot plant}} fed by a 600 -Nm 3 h− 1 waste {{air flow rate}} {{consisted}} of a water scrubbing pre-treatment followed by a <b>biotrickling</b> <b>filter</b> and a biofilter, in series. The growth of selected bacterial and fungal consortia was promoted through the <b>biotrickling</b> <b>filter</b> and biofilter. Total BTEX levels were detected in a raw waste air stream at an average concentration of 39. 07 mg Nm− 3. The whole treatment achieved an average of 96. 1 % removal efficiency. This performance led to very low average concentrations of individual BTEX in the final air effluent: 1. 07 mg Nm− 3 for benzene, 0. 16 mg Nm− 3 for toluene, 0. 22 mg Nm− 3 for ethylbenzene and 0. 07 mg Nm− 3 for xylene (mix). The performance and stability of both <b>biotrickling</b> <b>filter</b> and biofilter confirmed {{the effectiveness of the}} treatment in achieving low concentrations of individual BTEX in the final air effluent, which fully comply with the most stringent toxicological standard and threshold odor concentrations, for the protection of workers and local residents.

40|$|Odour from {{agricultural}} activities, such as {{the spreading}} of manure and the housing of animals, is increasingly being considered a nuisance in densely populated countries like the Netherlands. The objective {{of this research was}} to study the odour removal from pig house exhaust air by a <b>biotrickling</b> <b>filter</b> that had been implemented for ammonia abatement. At a regular pig production farm, the performance of a running full-scale <b>biotrickling</b> <b>filter</b> was studied for 72 days. Ammonia and odour removal efficiency were on average 79 % and 49 % respectively. Ammonia removal appeared to be based on an unintended accumulation of ammonium and nitrite in the system, instead of on production and discharge of nitrate. The odour removal efficiency showed a large variation that, for a major part, about 80 %, could be attributed to actual changes in the performance of the <b>biotrickling</b> <b>filter.</b> These changes were probably caused by variations in the composition of the air that were not completely reflected by the olfactometrically measured odour concentration, as the many different components that make up the odour each have different removal characteristics. It seemed that the <b>biotrickling</b> <b>filter</b> was operated below its maximum absolute odour removal capacity [OUE/(m(3) filter) /s], which means that the absolute odour removal will probably rise at increasing load. It was, however, not possible to distinguish between the influence of either the odour load or the odour concentration on the odour removal, because of a positive correlation between the odour concentration and the air flow. To increase the odour removal efficiency (%), the design of the filter probably needs to be optimised for both well and poorly water-soluble odour components...|$|R
40|$|Odour control, <b>biotrickling</b> <b>filter,</b> {{scrubbers}} Odour nuisance {{has become}} a major environmental issue worldwide with increasing public demand for better control of odorous emissions from municipal wastewater treatment facilities, chicken farms, chemical plants and other industrial works. Odour annoyance affects the population directly and there is a trend that {{more and more people are}} becoming less tolerable with obnoxious odour emissions. Bad smell is often regarded as an indicator for possible health risks. In Singapore, much investment has been placed on the prevention of nuisance odour emissions from all the public-owned wastewater treatment plants and continuing research has been put into the development of better and more cost-effective odour control procedures. The local authorities have invested significantly in covering up their existing waste treatment process units and treating all captured sewage air by a variety of technologies such as chemical scrubbers and activated carbon towers. Recently, a new <b>biotrickling</b> <b>filter</b> technology was developed and trial tested at a local wastewater plant and results from the past 3 years of operation indicate an extremely cost-effective biological way of treating sewage odour.

40|$|Abstract—A {{protocol}} {{was developed to}} rapidly assess the eciency of chemical washing {{for the removal of}} excess biomass from <b>biotrickling</b> <b>filters</b> for waste air treatment. Although the experiment was performed on a small scale, conditions were chosen to simulate application in full-scale <b>biotrickling</b> <b>filters.</b> From 18 treatments with dierent combinations and concentrations of chemicals, only washing with 0. 4 % (w/v) NaOH, 0. 26 and 1. 31 % (w/v) NaClO and 11. 3 % (w/v) H 2 O 2 resulted in a biomass removal significantly higher than treatment with pure water with wet biomass removal eciencies of 50. 2, 49. 2, 77. 0 and 69. 0 %, respectively. Biomass removal by H 2 O 2 and NaClO was accompanied by complete loss of activity of unremoved biomass, whereas after treatment with NaOH low residual bio-logical activity was observed. However, treatment with NaOH resulted in generation of relatively large amounts of suspended solids (22. 3 % of dry biomass removed) and dissolved carbon (65. 3 % of C-bio-mass removed). NaClO was found to be the most promising reagent for biomass control in <b>biotrickling</b> <b>filters</b> because of its ability to remove large amounts of biomass and its low cost. # 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

40|$|Removal of {{hydrogen}} sulfide from waste and energy-rich gases is required, {{not only because}} of environmental health and safety reasons, but also because of operational reasons if such gases have to be used for energy generation. A <b>biotrickling</b> <b>filter</b> for the removal of ultra-high concentrations of H 2 S from oxygen-poor gases is proposed and studied in this work. Two laboratory-scale <b>biotrickling</b> <b>filters</b> were used to study the startup period and to determine the long-term performance of the gas sweetening process. The inlet H 2 S concentration ranged from 900 to 12000 ppmv and two different packing materials were investigated. There was no toxicity effect observed even at a the highest H 2 S concentration, and maximum elimination capacities of 280 and 250 g H 2 S m 3 h 1 were obtained at gas contact times of 167 and 180 s, respectively. Elemental sulfur and sulfate were found to be the most abundant end-products of the biological oxidation of sulfide when operated under microaerophilic conditions. The <b>biotrickling</b> <b>filter</b> was able to quickly recover its nominal performance after different load increases and system shutdowns simulating field operation. The results reported here show that biotreatment can be an interesting alternative to conventional gas sweetening systems normally used for such applications.
