500|$|Frank was not {{originally}} envisioned with a beard, however at {{the time}} of his casting, Fahey himself had one. Lindelof and Cuse felt that the beard worked with Lapidus' character, and allowed Fahey to keep it for the role, with the requirement he shave it back to a more manageable length. The character remained bearded until his return in fifth season episode [...] "316", set three years on from his original introduction. Fahey praised the way the character was developed to suit him, explaining that upon meeting with Lindelof and Cuse, rather than discussing the show with him, they were more interested in him personally and his experiences, going on to incorporate elements of himself into Lapidus. He expanded: [...] "The <b>beauty</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> is they'll feed you a concept based on an idea of who you are. The actor and the characters are not suits off the rack, they tailor-make them to you. What's very exciting is it is a very positive give and take. It's a nice dance, as it were." [...] Fahey was not given an overarching overview of his character, nor were any of the other new freighter folk, which he found exciting, creating a level of intrigue amongst the cast and crew as well as fans. [...] Prior to arrival on the island, Lapidus was described by Naomi as a drunk. Entertainment Weeklys Kristin Dos Santos deemed Lapidus the most laid back of the four new characters, though Fahey commented that [...] "It might be because he's just rolled around a few more places a little longer than the others", agreeing with Dos Santos' assessment that Lapidus was [...] "a little nomadic". Lindelof and Cuse have said that Frank [...] "never takes anything at face value [...] a true conspiracy nut [...] has probably seen every episode of The X-Files, [...] pay off for him".|$|E

2500|$|Philip C. Kolin of the University of Southern Mississippi interprets several {{lines from}} the first two quatrains of Sonnet 20 as written by a {{homosexual}} figure. One {{of the most common}} interpretations of line 2 is that the speaker believes, [...] "the young man has the beauty of a woman and the form of a man...Shakespeare bestows upon the young man feminine virtues divorced from all their reputedly shrewish infidelity." [...] In other words, the young man possesses all the positive qualities of a woman, without all of her negative qualities. The narrator seems to believe that the young man is as beautiful as any woman, but is also more faithful and less fickle. Kolin also argues that, [...] "numerous, though overlooked, sexual puns run throughout this indelicate panegyric to Shakespeare's youthful friend." [...] He suggests the reference to the youth's eyes, which gild the objects upon which they gaze, may also be a pun on [...] "gelding…The feminine <b>beauty</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> masculine paragon not only enhances those in his sight but, with the sexual meaning before us, gelds those male admirers who temporarily fall under the sway of the feminine grace and pulchritude housed in his manly frame." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1980, {{sculptor}} Robert Arneson {{was commissioned}} {{to create a}} monument to Moscone to be installed in the new Moscone Convention Center. [...] The bust portraying Moscone was done in Arneson's expressionistic style and was considered acceptable by San Francisco's Art Commission. [...] However, the pedestal which the former Mayor's head rested on was deemed inappropriate and Arneson was asked to change it. At issue were references to Harvey Milk, the assassinations, the [...] "Twinkie Defense", the White Night riots, and Dianne Feinstein's mayoral succession that Arneson had included {{on the surface of}} the pedestal. [...] Arneson refused to make alterations to the work, returned the commission, and later resold the sculpture. In a critique of the event, Frederic Stout wrote that [...] "Arneson's mistake was in presenting the city mothers/fathers with something honest, engaging and provoking, that is to say, a work of art. What they wanted, of course, was not a work of art at all. They wanted an object of ritual magic: the smiling head of a dead politician." [...] In 1994 a new bust by San Francisco artist Spero Anargyros was unveiled, depicting Moscone holding a pen, below which are words from Moscone: [...] "San Francisco is an extraordinary city, because its people have learned to live together with one another, to respect each other, and to work with each other for the future of their community. That's the strength and <b>beauty</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> city – it's the reason why the citizens who live here are the luckiest people in the world." ...|$|E
2500|$|Porfirio Díaz's regime {{as leader}} of Mexico was from 1876 to 1911 and its main goal was to bring order and {{progress}} to the country. In particular, Díaz wanted to bring Mexico into the industrial world and its people to be productive, upstanding members of society. Vices such as drunkenness, laziness, and promiscuity were seen as retarding the beneficial progress {{of the city and}} the nation. Much like the Spanish authority, the Porfirian government and elites saw pulquerias a main source of such vices. So around the turn of the twentieth century there was an increase in the number of reforms and regulations centered on limiting the distribution of pulque, and supervising the use and role of pulquerias. These had to be licensed and located at least [...] apart. Opening hours were restricted to between 6.00 a.m. and 6:30p.m., thus forcing them to close before most workers had left their jobs. There were also many other restrictions on the location of pulquerias. Certain areas of the city, in particular those surrounding the Alameda central park, were forbidden to pulquerias because the Mexican authority did not want the <b>beauty</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> area spoiled by what they considered to be the undesirable characteristics associated with pulquerias. Overall, the Porfirian reforms enacted to directly limit the influence of pulquerias during the Porfiriato did not do much to reduce their popularity in Mexico City and the rest of the country. The Porfiriato did, however, encourage more modern attitudes in Mexico which indirectly and over time led to the diminished popularity of pulquerias.|$|E

[...] Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter states [...] "Brandishing an ambition it's likely no film, including this one, could entirely fulfill, The Tree of Life is nonetheless a singular work, an impressionistic metaphysical inquiry into mankind's place {{in the grand scheme}} of things that releases waves of insights amidst its narrative imprecisions." [...] Justin Chang of Variety states the film [...] "represents something extraordinary" [...] and [...] "is in many ways his simplest yet most challenging work, a transfixing odyssey through time and memory that melds a young boy's 1950s upbringing with a magisterial rumination on the Earth's origins." [...] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone states [...] "Shot with a poet's eye, Malick's film is a groundbreaker, a personal vision that dares to reach for the stars." [...] A. O. Scott of The New York Times gave the film much praise and stated, [...] "The sheer <b>beauty</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> film is almost overwhelming, but as with other works of religiously minded art, its aesthetic glories are tethered to a humble and exalted purpose, which is to shine the light of the sacred on secular reality". Total Film gave the film a five-star review (denoting 'outstanding'): [...] "The Tree of Life is beautiful. Ridiculously, rapturously beautiful.
