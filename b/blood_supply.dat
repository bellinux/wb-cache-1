5|$|After an apoplexy, the {{pressure}} inside the sella turcica rises, and surrounding {{structures such as}} the optic nerve and {{the contents of the}} cavernous sinus are compressed.

5|$|The {{pituitary}} gland {{is located in}} a recess in the skull base known as the sella turcica ("Turkish saddle", after its shape). It is attached to the hypothalamus, a part of the brain, by a stalk that also contains the blood vessels that supply the gland. It is unclear why pituitary tumors are five times more likely to bleed than other tumors in the brain. There are various proposed mechanisms by which a tumor can increase the risk of either infarction (insufficient <b>blood</b> <b>supply</b> leading to tissue dysfunction) or hemorrhage. The {{pituitary gland}} normally derives its <b>blood</b> <b>supply</b> from vessels that pass through the hypothalamus, but tumors develop a <b>blood</b> <b>supply</b> from the nearby inferior hypophyseal artery that generates a higher blood pressure, possibly accounting for the risk of bleeding. Tumors may also be more sensitive to fluctuations in blood pressure, and the blood vessels may show structural abnormalities that make them vulnerable to damage. It has been suggested that infarction alone causes milder symptoms than either hemorrhage or hemorrhagic infarction (infarction followed by hemorrhage into the damaged tissue). Larger tumors are more prone to bleeding, and more rapidly growing lesions (as evidenced by detection of increased levels of the protein PCNA) may also be at a higher risk of apoplexy.|$|E

5|$|Troponin is a {{sensitive}} biomarker {{for a heart}} with insufficient <b>blood</b> <b>supply.</b> It is released 4–6 hours after injury, and usually peaks at about 12–24 hours. Two tests of troponin are often taken – one {{at the time of}} initial presentation, and another within 3–6 hours, with either a high level or a significant rise being diagnostic. A test for brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) can be used to evaluate for the presence of heart failure, and rises when there is increased demand on the left ventricle. These tests are considered biomarkers because they are highly specific for cardiac disease. Testing for the MB form of creatine kinase provides information about the heart's <b>blood</b> <b>supply,</b> but is used less frequently because it is less specific and sensitive.|$|E
5|$|Buoyancy: The actual mass of {{the human}} brain is about 1400–1500 grams; however, the net weight of the brain {{suspended}} in the CSF is equivalent to a mass of 25-50 grams. The brain therefore exists in neutral buoyancy, which allows the brain to maintain its density without being impaired by its own weight, which would cut off <b>blood</b> <b>supply</b> and kill neurons in the lower sections without CSF.|$|E
5|$|Compartment {{syndrome}} is a clinical diagnosis, i.e., no diagnostic test conclusively proves its presence or absence, but direct {{measurement of the}} pressure in a fascial compartment, {{and the difference between}} this pressure and the blood pressure, may be used to assess its severity. High pressures in the compartment and a small difference between compartment pressure and blood pressure indicate that the <b>blood</b> <b>supply</b> is likely to be insufficient, and that surgical intervention may be needed.|$|E
30|$|After an earthquake, a {{sufficient}} amount of <b>blood</b> <b>supplies</b> {{needs to be}} available in very short {{time in order to}} treat the injured survivors. A lesson from the 2003 Bam concerned the disaster planning and emergency preparedness of the <b>blood</b> <b>supplies</b> for <b>blood</b> transfusions (Abolghasemi et al. 2008). The Bam disaster caused a large flow of blood donors from around Iran, but of the 108, 985 total donated blood units, only 21, 347 were distributed to the hospitals around the country. The hospitals in the Kerman region were overwhelmed in the first days after the earthquake, but they received only 1231 units of blood, a mere 1.3  % of the total blood donated during the first four days after the earthquake. A high number of blood units were discarded because of blood safety issues (Abolghasemi et al. 2008). Poor national blood transfusion organization highlighted the lack of major disaster planning and emergency preparedness for the supply, coordination, and transfer of <b>blood</b> <b>supplies,</b> and necessity of efficient communication between hospitals and blood collection centers. It was identified that 76  % of the blood units that reached the hospitals of Kerman Province were provided by neighboring provinces. For instance, Yazd Province with 923 blood units provided the highest number of blood units. Mobilizing first those provinces with rapid and easy access to the disaster area is vital in disaster planning for the <b>blood</b> <b>supplies</b> (Abolghasemi et al. 2008).|$|R

5|$|In skeletally {{immature}} individuals, the <b>blood</b> <b>supply</b> to the epiphyseal bone is good, supporting both osteogenesis and chondrogenesis. With {{disruption of}} the epiphyseal plate vessels, varying degrees and depth of necrosis occur, resulting in a cessation of growth to both osteocytes and chondrocytes. In turn, this pattern leads to disordered ossification of cartilage, resulting in subchondral avascular necrosis and consequently OCD.|$|E
5|$|OCD {{occurs when}} a loose piece of bone or {{cartilage}} partially (or fully) separates {{from the end of}} the bone, often because of a loss of <b>blood</b> <b>supply</b> (osteonecrosis) and decalcification of the trabecular bone matrix. The loose piece may stay in place or slide around, making the joint stiff and unstable. OCD in humans most commonly affects the knees, ankles, and elbow but can affect any joint.|$|E
5|$|Parathyroid glands share {{a similar}} <b>blood</b> <b>supply,</b> venous {{drainage}}, and lymphatic drainage to the thyroid glands. Parathyroid glands {{are derived from}} the epithelial lining of {{the third and fourth}} branchial pouches, with the superior glands arising from the fourth pouch, and the inferior glands arising from the higher third pouch. The relative position of the inferior and superior glands, which are named according to their final location, changes because of the migration of embryological tissues.|$|E

Blood flow in the ovarian artery, heart rate and progesterone (P 4) and androstenedione (A 4) secretion from the ovary and their concentrations in the ovarian venous effluent, as well as the concentrations of P 4 and A 4 in the <b>blood</b> <b>supplying</b> the oviduct and the uterus, were determined. A significant increase of P 4 and A 4 secretion after NA and M infusion and increased concentrations of P 4 and A 4 in the ovarian venous effluent were found, but these changes did not influence the counter current transfer of hormones from the venous effluent into arterial <b>blood</b> <b>supplying</b> the oviduct and the uterus. Infusion of Pr caused a significant decrease of P 4 and A 4 secretion and their concentrations in the ovarian venous effluent and significantly increased A 4 concentration in the <b>blood</b> <b>supplying</b> the oviduct and uterus. The results indicate that stimulation of α 1 -adrenoceptors in the area of ovarian vasculature did not influence, whereas block of α 1 -adrenoceptors affected, the local concentration of steroid hormones in the <b>blood</b> <b>supplying</b> the oviduct and the part of the uterus proximal to the ovary, despite the changes in the concentrations of steroid hormones in the ovarian effluent...|$|R
