5|$|After the Dream's <b>bootloader</b> was dumped, {{work began}} on modifying {{it so that}} it could install {{third-party}} firmware, and on converting official Android update files into a format that could be installed using the modified <b>bootloader.</b> Around the same time, Google made the Android Dev Phone 1 available for registered Android developers; the Dev Phone 1 was a SIM- and hardware-unlocked version of the HTC Dream that came pre-configured for superuser access to the internal files of the phone, allowing users to completely replace the <b>bootloader</b> and operating system.|$|E
5|$|BootX was {{superseded}} by another nearly identical <b>bootloader</b> named boot.efi and an Extensible Firmware Interface ROM on {{the release of}} the Intel-based Mac.|$|E
5|$|Older Macintoshes {{dating from}} 1983 until 1998 {{utilized}} a basic bootloader; the <b>bootloader</b> was solely a ROM chip varying in sizes up to 4megabytes (MB), which contained both the computer code to boot {{the computer and}} to run the Mac OS operating system. This {{was known as the}} Macintosh Toolbox, or the Old World ROM, and differs greatly from design the modern Macintosh which generally use a hard drive of large capacity to store the operating system. This <b>bootloader</b> was used in all Macintosh computers until mid-1998.|$|E
50|$|Examples of first-stage <b>bootloaders</b> include coreboot, Libreboot and Das U-Boot.|$|R
5000|$|In 2011, {{the need}} to {{circumvent}} hardware restrictions to install unofficial firmware lessened as {{an increasing number of}} devices shipped with unlocked or unlockable <b>bootloaders,</b> similar to the Nexus series of phones. Device manufacturer HTC has announced that it would support aftermarket software developers by making the <b>bootloaders</b> of all new devices unlockable. However, carriers, such as Verizon Wireless and more recently AT&T, have continuously blocked OEMs, such as HTC and Motorola, from releasing retail devices with unlocked <b>bootloaders,</b> opting instead for [...] "developer edition" [...] devices that are only sold unsubsidized and off-contract. These are similar in practice to Nexus devices, but for a premium and with no contract discounts.|$|R
50|$|Since August 2011, HTC officially allows {{unlocking}} HTC Sensation <b>bootloaders</b> at the HTCdev.com website.|$|R
5|$|BootX is a {{software-based}} <b>bootloader</b> {{designed and}} developed by Apple Inc. {{for use on}} the company's Macintosh computer range. BootX is used to prepare the computer for use, by loading all required device drivers and then starting-up Mac OS X by booting the kernel on all PowerPC Macintoshes running the Mac OS X 10.2 operating system or later versions.|$|E
5|$|A Developer Edition of the 64 GB HTC One was {{released}} in limited quantities in the United States, exclusively from HTC’s website on 19 April 2013. This variant ships with an unlocked <b>bootloader,</b> {{which can be used}} for the development and installation of custom ROMs. The Developer Edition is also unlocked for use on GSM networks and the LTE networks of T-Mobile and AT; however, it does not support T-Mobile’s AWS-based HSPA+ network.|$|E
25|$|Both Clover and Chameleon were updated to be {{compatible}} with El Capitan. Unibeast and MacPwn were updated to support El Capitan as well, since El Capitan, Unibeast (and Multibeast) use the Clover <b>bootloader</b> instead of Chimera (a Chameleon-based <b>bootloader).</b>|$|E

25|$|A <b>bootloader,</b> {{for example}} GNU GRUB, LILO, SYSLINUX, or Gummiboot. This {{is a program}} that loads the Linux kernel into the computer's main memory, by being {{executed}} by the computer when it is turned on and after the firmware initialization is performed.|$|E
50|$|All these {{complications}} {{and the speed}} tradeoff mean that XIP is generally only used for first stage <b>bootloaders</b> or when memory is in extremely short supply.|$|R
50|$|On 17 February 2010, Fast Company ranked HTC as the 31st most {{innovative}} {{company in the}} world. Bloomberg reports that HTC is considering its own mobile operating system to compete with Apple's iOS, Google's Android, and Microsoft's Windows Phone. On May 27, 2011, in response to customer feedback, HTC announced that they will no longer lock the <b>bootloaders</b> on their Android based phones. Since then, customers {{are now able to}} unlock the <b>bootloaders</b> of most of HTC's Android product line through the use of HTC's Developer website, HTCDev.com.|$|R
50|$|With {{more recent}} <b>bootloaders</b> it is {{possible}} to load the MD support as a kernel module through the initramfs mechanism, this approach allows the /boot filesystem to be inside any RAID system without the need of a complex manual configuration.|$|R

25|$|At the Google I/O 2013 keynote, Samsung and Google {{revealed}} that an {{edition of the}} U.S. S4 would be released on June 26, 2013 through Google Play, initially featuring stock Android 4.2.2, later updated to 4.4.4, with Samsung provided updates; it has an unlockable <b>bootloader</b> (similar to Nexus devices) and supports LTE on AT and T-Mobile's networks. The model number is GT-I9505G.|$|E
25|$|On most {{machines}} the bootstrap was {{a minimal}} <b>bootloader</b> in ROM combined with some means of minimal bank switching or {{a means of}} injecting code on the bus (since the 8080 needs to see boot code at Address 0 for start-up, while CP/M needs RAM there); for others, this bootstrap had to be entered into memory using front-panel controls each time the system was started.|$|E
50|$|Most of the SeaBIOS' {{source code}} {{is written in}} C, with its build system relying on the {{standard}} GNU toolchain. SeaBIOS has been tested with various <b>bootloaders</b> and operating systems, including GNU GRUB, LILO, SYSLINUX, Microsoft Windows, Linux, FreeDOS, FreeBSD, NetBSD and OpenBSD.|$|R
5000|$|... {{is often}} simply a {{directory}} {{on the main}} (or only) hard drive partition. However, {{it may be a}} separate partition.

50|$|During that time, it was {{necessary}} to find a computer works with MINIX for installing and booting another OS. But now, this operation became easier with <b>bootloaders</b> like: LILO, and GRUB. Linux had been improved faster than MINIX, so that, Torvalds and the forst Linux developers worked on compiling Linux kernel with GNU utilities.|$|R
25|$|Shortly {{after the}} release of Developer Preview 1, some unknown {{developers}} managed to install this version of OSX to their PC by using {{a modified version of the}} Chameleon <b>Bootloader.</b> This version was released via the main project starting at version r1997 to the general public. Due to the problems sourced during the Lion era, other ways of installing and required patches were never made public, which leaves the scene in an unknown state towards Mountain Lion.|$|E
25|$|RealEFI {{theoretically}} {{should be}} flashed {{instead of the}} BIOS but alternatively a loadable EFI {{can be used for}} those with a BIOS motherboard. This system was invented by Intel and is currently in active open source development at TianoCore. The <b>bootloader</b> is named DUET and it is capable of loading EFI but it is not designed to load Mac OS X, so, one more step was needed, adapt DUET to the requirements of Mac OS X. Also, newer motherboards already contain EFI but it is not suitable for running a Macintosh.|$|E
25|$|After {{the initial}} release of OSX Yosemite 10.10 BETA, various {{developers}} {{took on the}} role of updating their bootloaders for the system. Members of OSx86 forum Insanelymac set to update the EFI <b>Bootloader</b> Chameleon for this new OS release. Some time later, Niresh (an independent OSx86 developer) released a standalone tool known as Yosemite Zone which would automatically install the new OS and other various features on a non-Apple device with minimal input. This method consisted of torrenting an OSX 10.10 DMG onto a USB Flash Drive with MacPwn Vanilla Installation. Unibeast was updated to support Yosemite, and a distribution of Yosemite Zone was released with AMD processor support.|$|E
5000|$|In November 2013, {{one of the}} {{developers}} of Replicant wrote a blog post in which they said that Replicant could work on the Fairphone and the <b>bootloaders</b> (that {{are not part of}} the operating system) may even be free software. The Fairphone team seemed [...] "definitely interested" [...] in helping get Replicant running on the device.|$|R
50|$|The Butterfly's ATmega 169 CPU {{is capable}} of speeds up to 8 MHz, however it is factory set by {{software}} to 2 MHz to preserve the button battery life. There are free replacement <b>bootloaders</b> available that will launch programs at 1, 2, 4 or 8 MHz speeds. Alternatively, this may be accomplished by changing the CPU prescaler in the application code.|$|R
5000|$|However, as community-developed {{software}} {{has grown}} more popular and following {{a statement by}} the U.S. Library of Congress that permits [...] "jailbreaking" [...] mobile devices, manufacturers and carriers have softened their position regarding CyanogenMod and other unofficial firmware distributions, with some, including HTC, Motorola, Samsung and Sony Ericsson, providing support and encouraging development. As a result of this, in 2011 the need to circumvent hardware restrictions to install unofficial firmware lessened as {{an increasing number of}} devices shipped with unlocked or unlockable <b>bootloaders,</b> similar to the Nexus series of phones. Device manufacturers HTC and Motorola announced that they would support aftermarket software developers by making the <b>bootloaders</b> of all new devices unlockable, although this still violates a device's warranty. Samsung sent several Galaxy S II phones to the CyanogenMod team with the express purpose of bringing CyanogenMod to the device, and mobile carrier T-Mobile USA voiced its support for the CyanogenMod project, tweeting [...] "CM7 is great!".|$|R
25|$|Originally, the {{hardware}} architecture was so {{closely tied to}} the classic Mac OS system {{that it was impossible to}} boot an alternative operating system. The most common workaround, is to boot into Mac OS and then to hand over control to a Mac OS-based <b>bootloader</b> application. Used even by Apple for A/UX and MkLinux, this technique is no longer necessary since the introduction of Open Firmware-based PCI Macs, though it was formerly used for convenience on many Old World ROM systems due to bugs in the firmware implementation. Since then, Mac hardware boots directly from Open Firmware in most PowerPC-based Macs or EFI in all Intel-based Macs.|$|E
25|$|The BDOS, CCP and {{standard}} transient commands were (ideally) {{the same in}} all installations of a particular revision of CP/M, but the BIOS portion was always adapted to the particular hardware. Adding memory to a computer, for example, meant that the CP/M system had to be reinstalled with an updated BIOS capable of addressing the additional memory. A utility was provided to patch the supplied BIOS, BDOS and CCP {{to allow them to}} be run from higher memory. Once installed, the operating system (BIOS, BDOS and CCP) was stored in reserved areas at the beginning of any disk which would be used to boot the system. On start-up, the <b>bootloader</b> (usually contained in a ROM firmware chip) would load the operating system from the disk in drive A:.|$|E

50|$|Early {{responses}} of tablet and smartphone manufacturers and mobile carriers were typically unsupportive of third-party firmware development such as CyanogenMod. Manufacturers {{expressed concern about}} improper functioning of devices running unofficial software and the related support costs. Moreover, modified firmware such as CyanogenMod sometimes offer features for which carriers would otherwise charge a premium (e.g., tethering). As a result, technical obstacles including locked <b>bootloaders</b> and restricted access to root permissions were common in many devices.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Bootloaders</b> were {{hardware}} {{which used}} a similar [...] "glitch" [...] {{to break a}} card out of an endless loop on power-up each time the card was used; these did not provide any smartcard reprogramming ability. These could permit DirecTV [...] "H" [...] cards (now no longer in use) to operate despite the permanent damage done by malicious code during the [...] "Black Sunday" [...] attack of 2001. These devices are currently believed to be obsolete.|$|R
