500|$|The {{repeated}} {{use of the}} pomegranate in {{the symbolism}} is not accidental. [...] Not just in Lycia, but throughout Asia Minor, the Greek world, and Palestine, the pomegranate was widely recognised {{as a symbol of}} fructification and procreation. [...] Conversely, it is also a symbol of change and death. [...] This symbolism can <b>be</b> <b>helpful</b> <b>in</b> <b>identifying</b> the deities in the reliefs. [...] The pomegranate is a suitable gift for a goddess of sexuality such as Aphrodite who herself planted the original pomegranate on Cyprus. [...] It is not a suitable gift for an intellectual goddess such as Athena. [...] The pomegranate can have an overtly sexual meaning; Demeter complains that her daughter Persophone was [...] "forced to eat the seed of a pomegranate" [...] in the underworld, by which it is understood that she was raped.|$|E

Osmotic urea diuresis can cause hypernatraemia due to significant water losses but is often not diagnosed.
