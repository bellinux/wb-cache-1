2500|$|In January it {{was decided}} to {{manufacture}} a longer suspension. Schneider had, already before 9 December 1915, devised a system thirty centimetres longer with seven road wheels instead of five. Mourret ordered to build an alternative system. [...] Two Baby Holt tractors, part of the order of fifteen by Schneider on 21 September 1915, and property of the French State, were during two weeks from 2 February onwards in an army workshop combined into a single elongated vehicle, a caterpillar offensif allongé, by Lieutenant Charles Fouché, assisted by a small team of mechanics. The workshop was in the Farman factory at Billancourt appropriated from the l'Automobilette company. It was again about a foot longer than the Schneider type, and featured three bogies with a total of eight road wheels. The new suspension system was not based on exact blueprints but improvised by private Pierre Lescudé. On 17 February the eight-wheeled system, which prototype was later designated L'appareil n° 1 Type A ("Device Number 1 Type A") was tested at Vincennes, easily crossing trenches up to 1.75 metres wide and overcoming barbed wire obstacles. On 21 February successful tests were held at Vincennes, the Schneider company providing a non-elongated Baby Holt chassis for comparison. From this it was concluded that the tank was sufficiently developed to justify a production order. On 25 February 1916 the War Ministry secretly ordered the production of four hundred tracteurs-chenilles type Schneider & Cie blindés ("tracked and armoured tractors of the Schneider type"), at a price of 56,000 French francs per vehicle. For security reasons it was pretended these were simple towing vehicles, tracteurs Estienne. The earlier order of 15 December for ten vehicles was hereby replaced. Fouché was ordered to improve the prototype, which resulted in a slightly changed L'appareil n° 1 Type B, tested on 2 March. Further changes, now including improvised side armour extending to the front in a bow, created the L'appareil n° 1 Type C or Machine Profilée which was tested on 17 March. On 27 February, Schneider had been asked to provide a first armoured superstructure made of <b>boiler</b> <b>steel,</b> which was late March placed on the eight-wheeled chassis. Pictures of this vehicle have often been presented in books as showing the [...] "first Schneider CA prototype". However, this entire development line, even though its official order had been based on it, would not be ancestral to the Schneider tank. In the Spring of 1916, for reasons that are not entirely clear, there was a fundamental falling-out between the French Army and Schneider Cie. The latter company would develop and produce its Schneider tank {{on the basis of its}} seven-wheeled chassis, which had been patented on 17 January; the Army would develop the eight-wheeled system into the Saint-Chamond heavy tank.|$|E

50|$|Like {{the earlier}} locomotives, the Scotia Class was also {{delivered}} with copper boilers and fireboxes. Around April 1903, no. 8 Scotia was fitted with an experimental <b>steel</b> <b>boiler</b> and around 1907-1908 two more <b>steel</b> <b>boilers</b> with copper fireboxes were acquired as spare boilers for the Scotia Class.|$|R
50|$|All were {{superheated}} {{from the}} outset. The 36 class in original form had a round-top boiler {{rather than the}} Belpaire type. In the early to mid-1950s, {{the majority of the}} class were rebuilt with new, all-steel Belpaire boilers and re-designed cabs. Typical of the technology of the day, the riveted <b>steel</b> <b>boilers</b> originally fitted to the class had copper inner fireboxes, fire-tubes and superheater flues. The replacement Belpaire <b>boilers</b> had <b>steel</b> fireboxes, tubes and flues, in line with US practice and later NSWGR policy. Although copper provides superior heat transfer, it promotes a galvanic reaction resulting in the 'wasting' by corrosion of some <b>steel</b> <b>boiler</b> components such as crown stays and front tubeplates.|$|R

40|$|The major {{degradation}} mechanism occur due to oxidation and hot corrosion {{which is responsible}} for failure of boiler and gas turbine components. These failures occur because of the usage of wide range of fuels such as coal, oil at increased temperatures. In current investigation oxidation and hot corrosion performances of bare <b>Boiler</b> <b>Steel</b> SA- 192 has been evaluated in air and with aggressive environment. For aggressive environment composition of sodium sulphate and vanadium pentaoxide have been mixed in proper ratio (Na 2 SO 4 + 60 %V 2 O 5) to provide an experimental condition under cyclic conditions at an elevated temperatures of 850 0 C & 950 0 C. The kinetics of the corrosion is approximated by weight change measurements made after each cycle for total duration of 50 cycles. Each cycle consists of keeping the samples for 1 hour duration in Kanthol wire tube furnace at 850 0 C and 950 0 C followed by 20 minute cooling in ambient air.

40|$|A {{research}} {{experiment to}} determine the pre-mature failure of a waste heat <b>boiler</b> <b>steel</b> plate. A failure investigation of a welded waste heat <b>boiler</b> <b>steel</b> shell that developed transverse cracks {{was carried out in}} 1996 {{to determine the}} cause of failure as well as propose measures to be adopted to prevent similar failures occurring in the future. The boiler had been in service for several years before two cracks across two traversing circumferential welds were discovered on the underside during routine inspection. Chemical and metallographic analyses indicated that the boiler plate was made from a conventional C-Mn steel and that it was certainly suitable forthe purpose. The boiler interior showed massive deposition of a calcareous sludge on the walls and tube bundles. This was attributed to an excessive use of sodium orthophosphate to reduce the hardness of the boiler feed water. The high levels of Na+and P 043 ions found in both the sludge and boiler feed water analyses were taken as confirmatory evidence. Feed water quality monitored data forthe period January 1994 to October 1995 showed pH values that were in excess of 12. 4, a figure much higher than the recommended pH range of 8 to 11. The high pH is thought to have been responsible for the occurrence of cracking as a result of caustic embrittlement. This point of view is supported by the observation of intergranular separation in the microstructures adjacent to the crack paths...|$|E
