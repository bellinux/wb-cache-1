5|$|Simakis {{praised the}} book for having more depth of {{character}} than Grisham's novels customarily do.

Simakis notes that Wally trades sex for legal services with one claimant. Harshaw says that the <b>book</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> bit sentimental and comparatively lacking in terms of secondary character development for Grisham. Larry Orenstein of Canada's Globe and Mail notes that on the dramatic scale this book has instances of laugh out loud humor that make it more like Boston Legal than The Practice, which Boston Legal was spun off from.|$|E
