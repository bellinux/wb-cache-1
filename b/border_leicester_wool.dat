50|$|The {{live weight}} of a mature <b>Border</b> <b>Leicester</b> ram {{will be in the}} range of 140 - 175 kg and a mature ewe 90 - 120 kg. A {{yearling}} ewe is around 64 kg. Their white wool tends to be very long and by Merino standards, broad crimped, and in fineness about 32 to 38 microns, and is used for medium to heavy weight garments. This wool, though, is prized by spinners because of the crimp and lustre. The sheep are normally shorn twice a year when the wool has reached a length of around 100 mm. Lambs when shorn have an average of 1.8 kg of wool; yearlings have a larger body and can have as much as 3.2 kg at each shearing. The U.S., Australian and New Zealand <b>Border</b> <b>Leicesters</b> very rarely sport the extreme of British flocks. All strains of <b>Border</b> <b>Leicesters</b> are known for their docility.

The F 1 cross hoggets used for the comparison of the wool producing ability, wool yield and characters of 5 Corriedale hoggets were 6 Corriedale × Southdown, 6 Corriedale × Romney Marsh and 3 corriedale × <b>Border</b> <b>Leicester</b> F 1 cross hoggets. Wool yields(grease fleece and clean fleece yield) and wool characters(wool fineness, stretched length of wool, number of crimps and wool density) at about 9 months after birth between the Corriedale and F 1 cross hoggets born in spring were compared in 1959 and 1960. The results obtained are summarized as follows; (1) No significant differences in grease fleece and clean fleece yield between the Corriedale breed and F 1 crosses were observed. However, the fleece yields of the Romney Marsh and <b>Border</b> <b>Leicester</b> F 1 crosses were higher than the Corriedale breed, while the fleece yield of the Southdown F 1 cross lower than the Corriedale breed. (2) There {{was no significant difference in}} the wool fineness between the Corriedale breed and F 1 crosses, except in the wool fineness(significant at 0. 1 % level) between the Corriedale breed and <b>Border</b> <b>Leicester</b> Fl cross.

(3) Difference in the stretched length of wool between the Corriedale breed and F 1 crosses, except in the stretched length of wool(significant at 1 % level) between the Corriedale breed and Southdown Fl cross, was not significant. The stretched length of the Romney marsh and <b>Border</b> <b>Leicester</b> F 1 crosses was greater than the Corriedale breed, while the stretched length of the Southdown F 1 cross smaller than the Corriedale breed. (4) The numbers of crimps of the Coriedale breed, and Romney Marsh and <b>Border</b> <b>Leicester</b> F 1 crosses were significantly different at 0. 1 % and 1 % levels. The number of crimps in the Corriedale breed was the largest, while the difference in the crimp number between the Corriedale breed and F 1 crosses was considerably small.

40|$|Poor {{reproductive}} performance of Merino ewe flocks when mated to <b>Border</b> <b>Leicester</b> rams during spring {{may be due}} to seasonality of the <b>Border</b> <b>Leicester</b> breed. Two approaches were taken to test this assumption. Six young (12 months old) or six mixed-age (12, 24 and ≥ 36 months old) <b>Border</b> <b>Leicester</b> rams were either treated or not treated with melatonin implants (2 × 2 design) 6 weeks before the four groups of rams were each put with approximately 300 Merino ewes for an 8 -week mating period. Implants were inserted in early September (experiment 1). The second approach was to yard or not yard ewes and mixed-age rams on several occasions during the first 3 weeks of the mating period (experiment 2). Pregnancy rate and twinning percentage were assessed by ultrasonography. In experiment 1, melatonin treatment in young rams increased (p 0. 05) for ewes mated to either melatonin or non-melatonin-treated young rams (36. 8 % vs 40. 0 %, respectively), whereas melatonin significantly improved (p < 0. 05) twinning rate in those ewes mated to mixed-age rams (49. 1 % vs 36. 1 %). After 6 weeks of melatonin treatment, scrotal circumference was greater (p < 0. 05) in both young and mixed-aged rams than in untreated counterparts. In experiment 2, yarding of ewes and rams overnight on several occasions early in the mating period reduced (p < 0. 001) pregnancy rate compared with non-yarded counterparts (89. 5 % vs 65. 5 %). Twinning rate was not affected (37. 7 % vs 36. 1 %, respectively). In summary, melatonin treatment of <b>Border</b> <b>Leicester</b> rams significantly improved flock {{reproductive performance}} in spring due to improved pregnancy rates with young rams and improved litter size with mixed-age rams...|$|R

40|$|A 5 × 4 {{factorial}} experiment was designed in which lambs representing five genotypes were slaughtered at four ages (110, 236, 412 and 662 days of age).

Between 4 and 22 months of age, myoglobin concentration within all muscles and all genotypes doubled, with the bulk of this response occurring between 4 and 8 months of age. Levels in the longissimus thoracis et lumborum (LT) and semimembranosus muscles were double those seen in the semitendinosus (ST) muscle, and Merinos had the lowest myoglobin concentrations of all genotypes.
