40|$|International audienceOver {{the past}} years, {{agricultural}} mechanisation plants have known a steep emergence, encouraged, among other factors, by an estimated high environmental gain. However, {{the occurrence of}} the biogas leaks around the installations tends to depreciate the latter. The classical methane loss estimation techniques rely on <b>ballpark</b> <b>figures</b> and numerous simplifying assumptions; as a consequence, they are attached to a loose confidence score. Recently, such leakages have been detected and quantified with infrared (IR) sensors. In particular, optical flow methods {{have been used to}} estimate the flow out of the resulting IR image sequences. We address this problem in the current study; more explicitly, we tackle the question of the optical flow estimation out of IR images of biogas. For doing so we i) we build a benchmark mimicking with high-­‐fidelity the outdoor conditions of a real methanisation plant ii) we reconstruct the projected velocity fields of the biogas plume with a technique with uncertainty evaluation iii) we validate our approach by assessing the reconstruction of the gas leakage 2 D silhouette out of IR images against instantaneous fields estimated with high accuracy out of particle image velocimetry (PIV) measurements...|$|E

The proposal arrived at a <b>ballpark</b> <b>figure</b> of one million items that captured {{the entire history of}} computing, from roughly 1940 to 2000. The ACM Portal, also called the ACM Guide, was released to the public on May 21, 2003.|$|R
40|$|Forecasting is a {{systematic}} attempt {{to examine the}} future by inference from known facts. Sales forecasting is an <b>ballpark</b> <b>figure</b> of sales during a specified future period. Formerly, it was a manual process using the mathematical formulas. Due to the advent of computer the process of sale forecasting is fast and accurate. Machine learning, a subfield of Artificial Intelligence, has many algorithms that are used for forecasting. The aim of this research paper is to present a comparative analysis between the traditional methods of forecasting and machine learning techniques. A new technique known as combine approach which constructs from both moving average and ANN and interesting results so obtained are presented here. Experimental setup uses MATLAB...|$|R
40|$|Owing to levitate {{and rapid}} {{escalation}} of E-Commerce, cases of financial fraud allied with it are also intensifying and {{which results in}} trouncing {{of billions of dollars}} worldwide each year. Fraud detection involves scrutinizing the behavior of populations of users in order to <b>ballpark</b> <b>figure,</b> detect, or steer clear of objectionable behavior: Undesirable behavior is a extensive term including delinquency: swindle, infringement, and account evasion. Factually, swindle transactions are speckled with genuine transactions and simple pattern matching techniques are not often sufficient to detect those frauds accurately. In this survey we, will focuses on classifying fraudulent behaviors, identifying the major sources and characteristics of the data based on which fraud detection has been conducted. This paper provide a comprehensive survey and review of different techniques to detect the financial fraud detection used in various fraud like credit card fraud detection, online auction fraud, telecommunication fraud detection, and computer intrusion detection...|$|R
5000|$|The game [...] "combines The Room-style screen poking, {{point and}} click puzzle solving, and hidden object hunting - {{and gives it}} a crime-solving twist." [...] Players examine clue {{hotspots}} throughout the scene and collect useful items to unlock further rooms or clues. They can use a forensic flashlight to discover traces of blood on some and rotate them 360 degrees, similar to later games in the Ace Attorney franchise. As clues are discovered, the player pieces them together in a webbed flow-chart of lead questions which need to be answered to understand the full scenario. Each answered question results in a video demonstrating the events. Players move from screen to screen and can rotate 360 degrees, similar to Google Maps street view and the later games in the Myst series. Though dependent on one's [...] "style of play and deductive ability", The Trace states a <b>ballpark</b> <b>figure</b> of 3 hours of gameplay on its FAQ.|$|R
40|$|Cilj je ovoga rada objasniti rizik i povrat investicija i prikazati uobičajeni način njihova kvantificiranja. U njemu je također objašnjena logika različitih pristupa analizi rizika i povrata i dana je interpretacija rezultata. Glavni je diorasprave usmjeren na objašnjenje rizika kod ulaganja u obične dionice. Prikaz ključnih postupaka proračuna učinjen je na osnovi javno dostupnih informacija o dva vodeća {{hrvatska}} poduzeća. Ovaj rad je i prikaz diskusije o glavnim problemima i načinu mjerenja i razumijevanja osnovnih pojmova tržišne ekonomije, rizika i povrata. Ever {{since the}} wall came down most emerging market economies {{have been pushing}} hard {{to get closer to}} something that represents their ultimate goal - the market driven economy. Despite the hype and optimism that sprung up following the early victories in their quest to reach their goal, many more changes in the political, social and business world still await to be completed. Perhaps, the toughest change must be made in the way the economy and their political and business leaders appreciafe the “nuts and bolts” of capitalism. Croatia is not an exception to this problem either. While issues like privatization, banking system and restructuring certainly fill out front pages more easily, it is the fundamental concepts like risk and return that underlie the big picture of market economy. How does one value companies and securities, choose among different investment projects and evaluate executive performance if he does not know their risk- return properties? It is surprising to see then how foreign these fundamentals still are to a great number of Croatian executives. Unfortunately, in a market economy business decisions based on a gut feeling or a <b>ballpark</b> <b>figure</b> frequently end up in disaster. This article discusses the concept of the risk-return relationship and how to quantify it. Then it explains the rationale behind a different approach to analyzing risk and return and the interpretation of the results. The major part is aimed at explaining the risk of common stocks and an example of the key computations is shown based on recent public information for two leading Croatian companies. It must be pointed out that this article has by no means covered all the issues related to this topic nor has it tried to present a critique of all current problems which obstruct risk- return estimation in the Croatian market today...|$|R
