50|$|A {{less obvious}} {{example of this}} type of {{protection}} is the process of galvanising iron. This process coats iron structures (such as fencing) with a coating of zinc metal. As long as the zinc remains intact, the iron is protected from the effects of corrosion. Inevitably, the zinc coating becomes breached, either by cracking or physical damage. Once this occurs, corrosive elements act as an electrolyte and the zinc/iron combination as electrodes. The resultant current ensures that the zinc coating is sacrificed but that the <b>base</b> <b>iron</b> does not corrode. Such a coating can protect an iron structure for a few decades, but once the protecting coating is consumed, the iron rapidly corrodes.|$|E

40|$|The primary {{objective}} of this thesis is to synthesise novel thiosemicarbazone <b>based</b> <b>iron</b> chelators and investigate their anti-proliferative activity against neoplastic cells. Traditionally, iron chelators were developed {{for the treatment of}} iron overload diseases. However, the increased requirement for iron in rapidly proliferating cells, compared with normal cells, create an opportunity to use iron as a novel target for cancer chemotherapy. Previous development of thiosemicarbazone <b>based</b> <b>iron</b> chelators created new iron chelators with potent and selective anti-tumour activity towards a wide variety of human and murine tumour xenografts such as 2 -benzoylpyridine thisoemicarbazone (BpT) and 2 -(3 '-nitrobenzoyl) pyridine thiosemicarbazone (NBpT). In order to understand the structure-activity relationship of the thiosemicarbazone scaffold, novel BpT analogues were designed. First attempt was made by incorporating methyl substitution on the pyridine ring and mono- or di- methoxy substitutions at the phenyl ring. In addition, incorporation of electron-donating and electron-withdrawing substituents at the phenyl substituents of the N 4 -position of the BpT scaffold was done. Subsequently, dimerisation of BpT by forming dithiosemicarbazones using 2, 6 -dibenzoylpyridine were also investigated. Most of the novel thiosemicarbazone <b>based</b> <b>iron</b> chelators showed significantly higher anti-proliferative activity than the commercially available, gold-standard chelator desferrioxamine. Structure-activity relationship study revealed that the chelators with a single methyl substitutent on the pyridine ring had the highest anti-proliferative activity. Incorporation of mono- or di- substitution at the phenyl ring resulted in lower anti-proliferation activity, while methoxy substitution at the phenyl ring enhanced iron chelation efficacy. The study also indicated that benzoylpyridine thisoemicarbazones with electron-donating substituents resulted in greater anti-proliferative activity than electron-withdrawing groups. The increased molecular weight of the chelators influences the lipophilicity of the ligands resulting in low or moderate potency of the chelators towards neoplastic cells. The new information provided by this study could assist in the design and synthesis of future development of thiosemicarbazone <b>based</b> <b>iron</b> chelators with higher anti-proliferative activity and iron efficacy...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the aspects}} of modern {{material}} systems for high strength sintered steel parts {{is the presence of}} alloy elements with widely different oxygen affinity. Compared to the <b>base</b> <b>iron,</b> the “new” alloy elements Cr, Mn and Si form oxides with much higher stability. It is shown here that in case of powder mixes this leads to oxygen transfer from the <b>base</b> <b>iron</b> particles to the alloy elements during heating up to sintering temperature, i. e. metallothermic reduction of the iron surfaces. With prealloyed powders, the surface oxides, which are originally mostly iron oxide, are transformed into alloy element oxides during heating unless the iron oxides can be reduced at low temperature with H 2. In any case, the heterogeneity of the oxygen affinity is a parameter that has to be considered when defining alloy systems for sintered steels...|$|E

40|$|Cast iron is an alloy of iron {{containing}} {{more than}} 2 % carbon as an alloying element. It has almost no ductility {{and must be}} formed by casting. Ductile iron structure is developed from the melt of cast iron. The presence of silicon in higher amount promotes the graphitization, inhibiting carbon to form carbides with carbide forming elements present. The carbon forms into spheres when Ce & Mg {{are added to the}} melt of iron with very low sulphur content. Due to this special microstructure containing graphite in nodular form ductile iron possesses ductility & toughness superior to that of any cast iron & steel structure resulting in numerous successes in industrial application. Ductile iron castings with 3 and 12 mm thickness with varying chemical composition were cast in furan resin sand moulds to identify the effect of sample thickness on micro structural changes and selected mechanical properties. The effect of melt chemistry and molten metal processing variables (i. e., pre-conditioning of the <b>base</b> <b>iron,</b> inoculation type and practice, and pouring temperature, etc.) on the tensile and impact properties of thin-wall ductile iron castings has been investigated. Comparison of 3 and 12 mm sections within the same casting showed that section size was the main factor influencing tensile properties of ductile irons. While many samples from 3 mm sections showed low elongation values likely caused by a high pearlite content or presence of carbides, many others showed higher elongations and superior strengths well above those required in ASTM A 536 grades. At moderate to high elongations, the thin-wall samples were significantly stronger than samples from identical irons of 12 mm section. A direct comparison between impact values could not be made due to different test specimen sizes, {{but it is clear that}} toughness in the two section sizes was roughly equivalent when account was made for the total cross sectional area. The main difference between the Impact properties in the two section sizes lay in the relative in sensitivity of the thin section specimens to either melt chemistry or molten metal processing variables. Of the elements contained in the iron, silicon had the greatest effect on the tensile properties of the thin wall sections. The same increase in silicon content of the thin wall sections had little effect on impact toughness. As expected, any processing variable that led to an increase in nodule count (with a corresponding increase in ferrite content) led to greater ductility, lower strength, and improved toughness. Of the variables studied the greatest effect was found to be from late inoculation, <b>base</b> <b>iron</b> pre-conditioning, and the use of an inoculants containing bismuth and rare earths...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{addition}} of 0. 05 wt. % to 0. 25 wt. % Ca, Zr, Al-FeSi alloy on in-ladle and in-mould inoculation of grey cast irons was investigated. In the present paper, the conclusions drawn {{are based on}} thermal analysis. For the solidification pattern, some specific cooling curves characteristics, such as the degree of undercooling {{at the beginning of}} eutectic solidifi cation {{and at the end of}} solidifi cation, as well as the recalescence level, are identifi ed to be more infl uenced by the inoculation technique. The degree of eutectic undercooling of the electrically melted <b>base</b> <b>iron</b> having 0. 025 % S, 0. 003 % Al and 3. 5 % Ce is excessively high (39 – 40 ℃), generating a relatively high need for inoculation. Under these conditions, the in-mould inoculation has a more signifi cant effect compared to ladle inoculation, especially at lower inoculant usage (less than 0. 20 wt. %). Generally, the efficiency of 0. 05 wt. %– 0. 15 wt. % of alloy for in-mould inoculation is comparable to, or better than, that of 0. 15 wt. %– 0. 25 wt. % addition in ladle inoculation procedures.

In-mold addition rates for FeSi 75 ranged from 0. 1 % to 0. 3 %; the complex alloy tablets, based on oxy-sulfide chemistry, were added in much smaller amounts, 0. 01 % to 0. 03 %. In-mold inoculation was used simultaneously at three inoculant levels in multi-cavity test molds to evaluate chill tendency, microstructure and Brinell hardness characteristics. Thermal analysis also was used to study the solidification behavior of the <b>base</b> <b>iron</b> {{and the effect of}} FeSi 75 and the complex alloy tablet inoculants on graphite nucleation. Thermal analysis of the base low-sulfur iron was characterized by excessive eutectic undercooling. It was found that an addition of 0. 03 % CAT had an inoculation efficiency comparable with 0. 2 % to 0. 3 % calcium-bearing foundry-grade FeSi 75. CAT addition rates of less than 0. 05 % (based on the test casting weight) were extremely effective for late inoculation of grey irons. Irons inoculated with the CAT were less likely to chill (inclusively as inverse chill) and to develop micro-shrinkage formations, compared with calcium-bearing FeSi 75 treatments.

40|$|Recent studies {{revealed}} that in eutectic to slightly hypereutectic grey irons (CE = 4. 3 %- 4. 5 %) {{the presence of}} austenite dendrites provides an opportunity to improve the cast iron properties, as {{a high number of}} eutectic cells are “reinforced” by austenite dendrites. An iron powder addition proved to be important by promoting dendritic austenite in hypereutectic irons, but was accompanied by adverse effect on the characteristics of potential nuclei for graphite. The purpose of the present paper is to investigate the solidification pattern of these irons. Chill wedges with different cooling moduli (CM = 0. 11 – 0. 43 cm) were poured in resin bonded sand and metal moulds. Relative clear / mottled / total chill measurement criteria were applied. Iron powder additions led to a higher chill tendency, while single inoculation showed the strongest graphitizing effect.

40|$|Oxygen-sensitive {{alloying}} {{elements such as}} Mn, Si, and Cr have a high potential for improving the properties of low alloyed sintered steels while reducing the alloying cost. However, {{it is necessary to}} find a way for avoiding, or at least minimizing, the oxidation of these elements especially during {{the early stages of the}} sintering cycle. In this study Mn, Si, and Cr were introduced in the form of a master alloy powder designed to be mixed with the iron base powder and provide the final composition of the steel during the sintering process. The reduction/oxidation phenomena taking place during the heating stage were studied by thermogravimetry, dilatometry, and mass spectroscopy, using either reducing (H 2) or inert (Ar) atmospheres. The results show how the difference in chemical activity between <b>base</b> <b>iron</b> powder and master alloy causes the so called "internal-getter" effect, by which the reduction of less stable iron oxides leads to oxidation of the elements with higher affinity for oxygen. This effect can be somehow minimized when sintering in H 2, since the iron oxides are reduced at lower temperatures at which the reactivity of the elements in the master alloy is lower. However, H 2 concentration in the processing atmosphere needs to be carefully adapted to the specific composition of the materials being processed in order to minimize decarburization by methane formation during sintering.

40|$|The paper reviews {{original}} {{data obtained by}} the present authors, revealed in recent separate publications, describing specific procedures for high quality grey irons, and reflecting the forecast needs of the worldwide iron foundry industry. High power, medium frequency coreless induction furnaces are commonly used in electric melting grey iron foundries. This has resulted in low sulphur (1, 500 °C), contributing to unfavourable conditions for graphite nucleation. Thin wall castings are increasingly produced by these electric melt shops with a risk of greater eutectic undercooling during solidification. The paper focused on two groups of grey cast irons and their specific problems: carbides and graphite morphology control in lower carbon equivalent high strength irons (CE= 3. 4 %- 3. 8 %), and austenite dendrite promotion in eutectic and slightly hypereutectic irons (CE= 4. 1 %- 4. 5 %), {{in order to increase}} their strength characteristics. There are 3 stages and 3 steps involving graphite formation, iron chemistry and iron processing that appear to be important. The concept in the present paper sustains a threestage model for nucleating flake graphite [(Mn,X) S type nuclei]. There are three important groups of elements (deoxidizer, Mn/S, and inoculant) and three technological stages in electric melting of iron (superheat, pre-conditioning of <b>base</b> <b>iron,</b> final inoculation). Attention is drawn to a control factor (%Mn) x (%S) ensuring it equals to 0. 03 – 0. 06, accompanied by 0. 005 wt. %– 0. 010 wt. % Al and/or Zr content in inoculated irons. It was found that iron powder addition promotes austenite dendrite formation in eutectic and slightly eutectic, acting as reinforcement for the eutectic cells. But, there is an accompanying possible negative influence on the characteristics of the (Mn,X) S type graphite nuclei (change the morphology of nuclei from polygonal compact to irregular polygonal, and therefore promote chill tendency in treated irons).

40|$|The {{mechanical}} properties of components made by PM steels are normally inferior to {{those made by}} alternative processes. One {{of the main reasons}} is that a large amount of pores are present in sintered components. The other main reason is that the alloying elements, particularly Ni, are not uniformly distributed after conventional sintering procedures.   This work is aimed at {{a better understanding of the}} influence of alloying additions on {{mechanical properties}} and homogeneity of the microstructure. The experimental work has been carried out in two trials. Trial 1 was performed to investigate mechanical properties of Distaloy powders (commercial grades) and second trial to examine influence of alloying additions on homogeneity of microstructure.   For trial 1, as-sintered and heat treated specimens were produced by mixing commercial powders with two different carbon levels. Whereas, alloying elements were admixed to <b>base</b> <b>iron</b> powder for producing  sintered specimens for trial 2. Mechanical properties including dimensional changes, micro-hardness, tensile strength and impact resistance were measured. Distribution of alloying elements was studied using LOM and SEM-EDS analysis. The results obtained show that additions of alloying elements enhance the mechanical properties. Moreover, interaction of C with Cu and Ni as well as interaction between Cu and Ni have a deceive role in determining final properties of the components. The metallographic investigation indicated that major reasons of heterogeneous microstructure are slow diffusion of Ni in Fe matrix and interaction of other alloying elements with Ni.   The results of trial 2 showed that addition of Mo and Cu to Ni-containing PM steels improves the distribution of Ni in Fe matrix. Mo results in improved uniformity of microstructure by lowering the chemical potential of carbon. In Ni and Cu containing alloys, the interaction between Ni and Cu is responsible for enhanced distribution of Ni. However, the improved Ni distribution is achieved at the expense of non-uniform distribution of Cu. In Ni-containing PM steels, improved microstructure homogenization can be attained by increasing Ni-Cu interaction, lowering the surface energy of Ni-Cu liquid and decreasing the chemical potential of carbon...|$|E

To carry out this experiment, suitable casting conditions, with which grey iron should be taken in the as-cast condition, were picked out, and the test pieces, JIS 8 C type tensile strength test pieces, were casted using two kinds of cast iron mold which has respectively mold ratio 6. 5 and 9. 0. The mold were coated with two layers of coating material, diatomaceous earth and soot. Irons, about 3 kg, were melted in a high frequency induction furnace at about 1450 ℃ with alumina crucible and were poured into the mold at 1300 ℃, after　being　inoculated　at　 1450 ℃ with 0. 3 % Ca-Si. Chemical composition of irons was adjusted to have required the degree of eutectic saturatio (Sc), 0. 85 to 1. 05, by the addition of low carbon steel to the <b>base</b> <b>iron</b> containing 3. 79 %C, 2. 20 %Si, 0. 44 %Mn, 0. 12 %P, 0. 05 %S. For purpose of reference, test pieces with same type were casted into green sand mold. The results obtained are as follows: (1) The microstructure of the permanent mold cast iron with a grey fracture in the as-cast condition is composed of ferritic and pearlitic matrix containing eutectic and fine flaky graphite, and higher Sc is, more the ferrite among the matrix becomes. (2) Strength of the permanent mold cast iron is better than that of the sand mold casting with same Sc:the tensile strength and the hardness of the permanent mold cast iron is respectively 24 to 32 kg/mm＾ 2) and 220 to 260 Hv(20). Density of the permanent mold cast iron is higher than that of green sand mold cast iron. (3) In case of grey iron permanent molding,it is necessary to select the chemical composition and the cooling conditions to keep away from tending to be white or mottled cast iron, and hence it tends to have similar structure and mechanical properties. Therefore,it will be recommended,in case of permanent mold casting,to controll strictly the casting conditions using the iron with higher Sc which has less chilling tendency.

40|$|High Silicon {{ductile iron}} (SSFs) {{represents}} a state-of-art in standardized ductile Iron grades, because it uniquely combines uniform hardness, intermediate {{strength and ductility}} rivalling that of some steels. Also backed by economic and technical potentials, {{it is imperative to}} take advantage of these unique properties to explore avenues to reach even higher strength levels in this grade. Within the SSF grade, strengthening limit with Silicon is reached at 4. 3 wt% with mechanical properties markedly plunging at this point, necessitating the need to investigate alternative strengthening measures aside expensive heat treatments, hence thesis objective to research methods to develop high strength SSF ductile irons as-cast. Casting process and production methods to mitigate against challenges of current SSF irons also form part of this objective. Researching and developing high strength SSF offers to the engineering materials pool, aside from obvious financial benefits, additional options in material selection for different applica-tions, energy savings due to lighter castings, improved tool life from uniform hardness and boost knowledge on suitability of cast irons as viable replacements for steel in some applications. The solution approach in the thesis started with extensive literature reviews and background researches on DI standardized grades with emphasis on the SSFs and strengthening mechanisms to understand present challenges of these grades. The idea was then to aim for higher strength using the EN-GJS- 600 - 10, the SSSF grade with the highest Silicon content and strength as both reference and <b>base</b> <b>iron</b> for designing the experimental high strength SSF. Using a suc-cession of elimination methods in the product development process based on identified pa-rameters for high strength in DIs, such as improving graphite properties, reducing carbidic pres-ence etc., controlled chemical composition with Cobalt (Co) as alloying element was proposed. The result of the casting trials proved that Co indeed fortified the experimental SSF showing increase in strength and elongation. Graphite properties were improved, with refined nodules and higher nodule counts. In addition, no apparent graphite degeneracy was noticed in the microstructure with a homogenous ferritic matrix. The overall qualities of the Co-alloyed irons were better compared to the reference EN-GJS- 600 - 10. The significance of the results is that silicon limit in current SSF grade does not affect the possi-bility of reaching higher strength via controlled alloying with other element. Co alloying provid-ed better graphite attributes in the Iron which influenced elongation and cast quality. Although from the result data, it is statistically insufficient to ascertain if further increase in Co will be proportional to strength or elongation, Co however, similar in effect to Si, stabilizes austenite contributing positively to strength, increased nucleation and nodularisation efficiency...|$|E
