5000|$|The {{historical}} references {{presented in}} the preceding paragraphs illustrate the significance which the expression 'sister Churches' has assumed in the ecumenical dialogue. This makes the correct theological {{use of the term}} even more important.In fact, in the proper sense, 'sister Churches' are exclusively particular Churches (or groupings of particular Churches; for example, the patriarchates or metropolitan provinces) among themselves. It must always be clear, when the expression 'sister Churches' is used in this proper sense, that the one, holy, Catholic, and apostolic Universal Church is not 'sister' but 'mother' of all the particular Churches. However, as recalled above, one cannot properly say that the Catholic Church is 'sister' of a particular Church or group of Churches. This is not merely a question of terminology, but above all of respecting a basic truth of the Catholic faith: that of the unicity uniqueness of the Church of Jesus Christ. In fact, there is but a single Church, and therefore the plural term [...] "Churches" [...] can refer only to particular Churches.Consequently, one should avoid, as a source of misunderstanding and theological confusion, the use of formulations such as 'our two Churches,' which, if applied to the Catholic Church and the totality of Orthodox Churches (or to a single Orthodox Church), imply a plurality not merely on the level of particular Churches, but also on the level of the one, holy, Catholic, and apostolic Church confessed in the Creed, whose real existence is thus obscured.Finally, it must also be borne in mind that the expression 'sister Churches' in the proper sense, as attested by the common Tradition of East and West, may only be used for those ecclesial communities that have preserved a valid episcopate and Eucharist as indicated in <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>document,</b> it is 'improperly applied' when referring to 'the Anglican Communion and non-Catholic ecclesial communities'.|$|E

40|$|Evaluating {{the use of}} {{different}} positional strategies for sentence selection in biomedical literature summarization Laura Plaza 1 * and Jorge Carrillo-de-Albornoz 2 Background: The position of a sentence in a document has been traditionally considered {{an indicator of the}} relevance of the sentence, and therefore it is frequently used by automatic summarization systems as an attribute for sentence selection. Sentences close to the <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> the <b>document</b> are supposed to deal with the main topic and thus are selected for the summary. This criterion has shown to be very effective when summarizing some types <b>of</b> <b>documents,</b> such as news items. However, this property {{is not likely to be}} found in other types <b>of</b> <b>documents,</b> such as scientific articles, where other positional criteria may be preferred. The purpose of the present work is to study the utility {{of different}} positional strategies for biomedical literature summarization. Results: We have evaluated three different positional strategies: (1) awarding the sentences at the <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> the <b>document,</b> (2) preferring those at the <b>beginning</b> and end <b>of</b> the <b>document,</b> and (3) weighting the sentences according to the section in which they appear. To this end, we have implemented two summarizers, one based on semanti...|$|R

5000|$|A cross symbol {{was often}} drawn as an {{invocation}} at the <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>documents</b> {{in the early}} medieval West. At the end <b>of</b> <b>documents,</b> commissioners or witnesses would sign with a signum manus, often also {{in the form of}} a simple cross. This practice is widespread in Merovingian <b>documents</b> <b>of</b> the 7th and 8th centuries. A related development is the widespread use of the cross symbol on the obverse side of early medieval coins, interpreted as the signum manus of the moneyer.The tradition of minting coins with the monogram of the ruling monarch on the obverse side originates in the 5th century, both in Byzantium and in Rome. This tradition was continued in the 6th century by Germanic kings, including the Merovingians. These early designs were box monograms. The first cruciform monogram was used by Justinian I in the 560s. Tiberius III used a cruciform monogram with the letters R, M for Rome and T, B for Tiberius; Pope Gregory III used the letters G, R, E, O.|$|R

40|$|Position {{information}} has been proved to be very effective in document summarization, especially in generic summarization. Existing approaches mostly consider the information of sentence positions in a document, based on a sentence position hypothesis {{that the importance of}} a sentence decreases with its distance from the <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> the <b>document.</b> In this paper, we consider another kind of position information, i. e., the word position information, which is based on the ordinal positions of word appearances instead of sentence positions. An extractive summarization model is proposed to provide an evaluation framework for the position information. The resulting systems are evaluated on various data sets to demonstrate the effectiveness of the position information in different summarization tasks. Experimental results show that word position information is more effective and adaptive than sentence position information. ...|$|R
