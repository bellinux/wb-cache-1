Yet I was foolish enough to give him a second chance because he begged and pleaded, despite the fact that everyone around me said he was still straying. I guess I really wanted to <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> <b>him.</b> Then I actually caught him red-handed. It took me a while to get out. But having done that, nothing can make me go back.|$|E
5|$|Vermigli's Eucharistic {{views were}} {{accepted}} in Zürich, but {{he ran into}} controversy over his doctrine of double predestination. Similarly to John Calvin, Vermigli believed {{that in some way}} God wills the damnation of those not chosen for salvation. Vermigli attempted to avoid confrontation over the issue, but Bibliander began to openly attack him in 1557, at one point allegedly challenging him to a duel with a double-edged axe. Bibliander held the Erasmian view that God only predestines that those who <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> <b>him</b> will be saved, not the salvation of any individual. Reformed theologians during this time held a variety of beliefs about predestination, and Bullinger's position is ambiguous, but they agreed that God sovereignly and unconditionally chooses whom to save. They believed salvation is not based on any characteristic of a person, including their faith. Bullinger and the Zürich church did not necessarily agree with Vermigli's double predestinarian view, but Bibliander's view was deemed unallowable. He was dismissed in 1560, in part to assure other Reformed churches of the Zürich church's orthodoxy. Vermigli was involved in predestinarian controversy again when Zanchi, who had remained in Strasbourg when Vermigli left for Zürich, was accused of heretical teachings on the Eucharist and predestination by the Lutheran Johann Marbach. Vermigli was selected to write the official judgement of the Zürich church on the matter in a statement signed by Bullinger and other leaders December1561. His affirmation of a strong doctrine of predestination represented the opinion of the Zürich church as a whole.|$|E

Uncomfortable with the changes brought about {{following}} VaticanII, Scalia drove long distances to parishes he felt were more in accord with his beliefs, such as the Tridentine Latin Mass in both Chicago and Washington and also the Latin version of the Mass of Paul VI at St. Catherine of Siena in Great Falls, Virginia. In a 2013 interview with Jennifer Senior for New York magazine, Scalia was asked whether his beliefs extended to the Devil, and he stated, [...] "Of course! Yeah, he's a real person. Hey, c'mon, that's standard Catholic doctrine! Every Catholic believes that". When asked whether he had seen recent evidence of the Devil, Scalia replied: [...] "You know, it is curious. In the Gospels, the Devil is doing all sorts of things. He's making pigs run off cliffs, he's possessing people and whatnot... What he's doing now is getting people not to <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> <b>him</b> or in God. He's much more successful that way".

Kyle once again tries to suggest that they use Mr. Hankey as a non-religious Christmas icon since he does not discriminate against anyone. At home, Kyle is scolded by his parents for believing in Mr. Hankey. While Kyle is brushing his teeth, Mr. Hankey comes out of the toilet, spreading feces stains everywhere he goes, prompting Kyle's parents to blame Kyle for the mess. Kyle decides he will bring Mr. Hankey to school to prove he is real, but this only causes more problems as Mr. Hankey disguises himself as an unadorned, dried-out piece of feces when he is around people who do not <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> <b>him,</b> leading Cartman to ask if carrying around boxes with feces in them is some kind of Jewish tradition. Mr. Hankey leaps at Cartman's face as he sings [...] "Kyle's Mom is a Big Fat Bitch" [...] in D Minor, and Kyle is blamed.

500|$|His last book, The Great Galilean, {{has been}} characterised by one biographer as Keable's attempt [...] "to renconcile {{his love of}} Jesus with his failure to <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> <b>him</b> as a God." [...] The book sought to {{distinguish}} the [...] "historical Jesus" [...] of record from the [...] "traditional Jesus" [...] of church worship. The historical Jesus, Keable said, was so poorly known that there survived too little information for a three-line obituary. Instead, the figure that Christians worshipped was a [...] "traditional Jesus", recorded in the Gospels from an oral tradition that was not really biographical. This [...] "traditional Jesus" [...] became a [...] "literary Jesus", the central figure of the four gospels, and it is on this figure – quite distinct from the actual, historical Jesus – that the contemporary church centred. Keable sought to criticise the attitude in the contemporary church toward [...] "traditional Jesus", given {{how much of the}} rest of [...] "traditional" [...] religion Protestantism had discarded. However, Keable was at pains to stress that the [...] "traditional" [...] Jesus should not be seen as an , or something to be discarded. The ahistoricity of the traditional Jesus, he said, should not be a reason to leave the church. Without this traditional Jesus, he predicted, Western civilisation would fade and fall. He was, then, critical of the specific ways in which the contemporary church construed Jesus, in its attempts to conflate the traditional Jesus with historical Jesus, which Keable considered impossible. He blamed these actions of the church for the declining numbers of worshippers, and accused it of draining Christianity of profundity by relying too heavily on rationalism and rigid structure.|$|E
