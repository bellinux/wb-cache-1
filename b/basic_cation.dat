The wastes included plant materials (maize, sorghum, kikuyu grass, soybean, red clover residues, and acacia prunings), animal manures (kraal, pasture and feedlot cattle, pig, and layer and broiler poultry), household compost, sewage sludge, and an industrial waste, filter cake. Amendments were analyzed for a number of different tests (ash alkalinity, total <b>basic</b> <b>cation</b> content, proton consumption capacity, and CaCO 3 content) which have been proposed as predictors of the liming effect of specific types of organic residues, and values were related to the changes in pH observed. Soil pH was increased, and exchangeable Al plus total and monomeric Al in solution were decreased by addition of all the organic amendments; the effect was greater at the higher rate of addition. The major mechanisms responsible for the elevations in pH were suggested to be the substantial CaCO 3 content of poultry and pig manures and filter cake, the proton consumption capacity of humic material present in household compost and manures, and decarboxylation of organic acid anions during decomposition of plant residues and manures. Ash alkalinity and <b>basic</b> <b>cation</b> content were the tests most closely correlated with increase in soil pH.

The experiment was a factorial design conducted in the laboratory for 12 weeks. The results indicated an increase in soil pH by 1. 2 units for Adenta series and 1 unit for Toje series after one week of HUF application followed by a decline by about 2 pH units for both soil types after twelve weeks. This was attributed to nitrification of ammonium to nitrate leading to acidification. The EC otherwise increased with HUF application creating slightly saline conditions in Toje series and non-saline conditions in Adenta series. When WA was applied with HUF, both soil pH and EC increased. In contrast, the HUF alone slightly salinized Toje series, but both soils remained non-saline whenWA and HUF were applied together. The application ofWA resulted in two-fold increase in Ca, Mg, K, and Na content compared to HUF alone.

40|$|Abstract. Routine {{analyses}} for soil cation exchange properties usually give only limited {{insight into the}} properties and management of soils containing significant amounts of variable charge. In this paper a procedure for determining a soil Charge Fingerprint is fully described, a model developed from simplified theory to underpin the methodology is discussed, and examples of {{the usefulness of the}} approach are given. Operationally defined cation and anion exchange capacities (CEC and AEC) are determined over an appropriate pH range (pH 4 to pH 6 is suggested) using Ca and Cl as the index cations. At low pH, Ca does not always fully saturate the CEC, so {{that it is necessary to}} distinguish a Basic CEC (Ca ads.) from the Total CEC (Ca + Al ads.). The graphical representation of CECT, CECB, and AEC v. pH constitutes the Charge Fingerprint. Though not intended as a routine instrument, its determination on key samples in a characterisation exercise places routinely determined basic and acidic cations in context. Examples are given of large scale characterisation studies that link soils from different continents having similar surface charge characteristics; of the assessment of the success or otherwise of producing permanent positive charge in synthetically prepared Ti-substituted goethites; and of the evaluation of the effect of adding crushed basic rock amendment on the surface charge properties of a variable charge soil.

40|$|Management-induced {{degradation}} of soil chemical and microbial quality {{is one of the}} most pressing concerns and a considerable threat to the sustainability of agroecosystems. However, information on this important issue is limited and largely based on short-term studies. A long-term experiment initiated in 1939 at the University of Pretoria provided a unique opportunity to assess the direct and residual effects of manure and inorganic fertilizers on soil chemical properties, microbial components and maize yield in rotation with field pea. Long-term addition of manure resulted in increased total organic C (TO C), total Nand available P levels in the soil. Seasonally, these nutrients exhibited variations that appeared to be related to influences of crop rotation. Soil N content in an adjacent native site remained relatively constant but tended to increase in the control and manured plots. Soil microbial biomass C, Nand P and microbial populations were affected by previous manure application as well as by crop rotation. Microbial biomass and numbers were generally higher in the manured plots. Manure application also had substantial residual effects and resulted in maize grain yields higher than in the control. Long-term NPK application resulted in decreased TOC and <b>basic</b> <b>cation</b> contents, and lowering of soil pH. The decrease in TOC was greater in single fertilizer treatments whereas <b>basic</b> <b>cation</b> contents and pH declined more in the balanced fertilizer treatments. Soil microbial biomass and numbers were influenced by, and exhibited qualitative changes in response to, long-term fertilization. Crop rotation also exerted effects on chemical and microbial properties of the soil. Maize grain yield showed significant increases in response to balanced fertilizer treatments. Response of maize to simple fertilizer applications was not beneficial in terms of yield returns. These results suggest that judicious use of inorganic fertilizers may, in the long-term, maintain soil quality and productive capacity. A comparison of the effects of residual manure and NPK fertilizers on the content of selected nutrients, microbial properties, C and N inputs, tissue nutrient concentration and crop yield showed differences due to treatments. TOC, total N and available P levels were increased due to residual manure alone or in combination with NPK fertilizers. C and N inputs and tissue P concentration were also generally higher in manured than in the NPK treatment. However, the higher increase in nutrient contents of manured plots was not reflected in microbial properties of the soil. Despite lower nutrient levels, the NPK treatment resulted in relatively greater increases in microbial properties of the soil. The differential responses were largely due to differences in quality and decomposability of organic material. Organic material in the NPK treatment appeared to have a higher decomposition and turnover rate than in other treatments, suggesting that C limitation in soils of low C but good nutrient supply may be compensated by high turnover rates of the available organic materials. The beneficial effect of residual manure on microbial properties and crop yield was decreased by application of supplemental N fertilizer but remained unaffected by application of supplemental K fertilizer. The depressive effect of excess soil P levels on soil microbial properties and crop yield was exacerbated by supplemental N fertilizer and mitigated by supplemental manure and K fertilizer applied to residual P. The decrease in available P levels due to supplemental K application implies that this may serve as a viable alternative to ameliorate soils with excess P levels.

Listeria monocytogenes is a food pathogen found in many habitats including soil, plants, water systems and food processing factories. We designed microcosm experiments to decipher extrinsic factors that drive the fate of this model of Human pathogen in soil. We analysed population dynamics over 80 days after inoculation of a large set of 100 soils selected from the French Réseau de la Qualité des Sols (RMQS), a country-wide venture of monitoring of the quality of soils in France.

In the trails, a uniform diammonium phosphate (DAP) + urea application {{was used as}} the control treatment, while potassium sulphate and Mg containing Kalimagnesia, were applied at varying rate combinations. Compared to the control treatment (DAP + urea), all fertilizer treatments containing K, Mg, and S increased root yield in the Kuzucu and Alakova locations, while in the Karararslan location only potassium sulphate treatment improved root yield. The Kalimagnesia fertilizer containing all 3 nutrients, namely K, Mg, and S, enhanced root yield by 42 % and 39 % in the Kuzucu and Alakova locations, respectively. But, this yield-stimulating effect of the Kalimagnesia fertilizer was rate-dependent. Kalimagnesia was also effective in improving the sugar content of the root, while the amino-N levels were not consistently affected by the fertilizer treatments.

This soil collection is meant to be representative of the pedology and land use of the whole French territory. The population of L. monocytogenes in inoculated microcosms was enumerated by plate count after 7, 14 and 84 days of incubation. Analysis of survival profiles showed that L. monocytogenes was able to survive up to 84 days in 71 % of the soils tested, in the other soils (29 %) only a short-term survival (up to 7 to 14 days) was observed. Using variance partitioning techniques, we showed that about 65 % of the short-term survival ratio of L. monocytogenes in soils was explained by the soil chemical properties, amongst which the <b>basic</b> <b>cation</b> saturation ratio seems to be the main driver.

40|$|Master of Science - ScienceThe {{replacement}} of indigenous grasslands by commercial forestry plantations on the mountainous eastern escarpment of South Africa, has inevitably led to alteration of nutrient cycling. The overall {{objective of this}} study was to determine the nutrient status (soil, litter and foliar nutrient concentrations) of Pinus patula and Eucalyptus grandis plantations and adjacent grasslands. The 2, 13 and 30 year old P. patula plantations and adjacent Driekop grassland were located relatively high up on the escarpment (altitudes ranging between 950 – 1610 m) and were underlain by dolomite while the 2, 8 and 13 year old E. grandis plantations and adjacent Brooklands grassland were located lower down (altitudes ranging between 900 – 1100 m) and were underlain by granite. It was assumed that the nutrient status of the soil under the plantations and the adjacent grasslands were similar prior to afforestation. Samples were collected once in winter (August 2002) and once in summer (January 2003). Soil samples were collected to a depth of 20 cm and litter material, to a maximum depth of 20 cm. Lower canopy foliar samples were collected within the lowermost metre of the canopies and upper canopy foliar samples were collected within the uppermost metre of the canopies. The data were analysed in the laboratory for various elements and soil physical parameters. The soil pH was lower under the P. patula (pH 4. 8 - 5. 2) and E. grandis plantations (pH 4. 6 - 5. 3) when compared with the soil under the adjacent grasslands (pH 5. 3 - 5. 6). The soil under the P. patula plantations had lower exchangeable base cation concentrations (204 - 300 mg kg- 1) compared with the adjacent Driekop grassland (452 - 645 mg kg- 1), while there were no clear trends when comparing the exchangeable <b>basic</b> <b>cation</b> concentrations in the E. grandis plantations and the adjacent Brooklands grassland. The soil aluminium saturation was similar between the plantations, ranging between 39. 7 and 63. 3...|$|E
40|$|Listeria monocytogenes is a food born {{pathogen}} {{responsible for}} the potentially fatal disease listeriosis. Initial contamination of plants vegetables and fruits may occur in cropping systems and originate from soil (that may act as a reservoir), water or organic amendments. The {{aim of this study}} was to identify major biotic and abiotic soils characteristics which determine L. monocytogenes survival in soil. Survival of L. monocytogenes was evaluated in a set of 100 soil microcosms representative of land use and pedology of French soils. These soils originated from the RMQS network were thoroughly characterized including chemical properties (pH, ionic content), texture (clay, sand and silt content), land use, and spatial localization. A sub-set of 9 Gamma-radiation sterilized soils was used to investigate whether soil microflora may affect L. monocytogenes survival. Microcosms were inoculated with 106 L. monocytogenes per gram of soil. L. monocytogenes populations were monitored after 7, 14 and 84 days of incubation at 20 °C by plate-counts on selective PALCAM media. L. monocytogenes was able to persist in most of the tested soils but survival rates were strongly variable. A short term and a long term survival of L. monocytogenes were reported in 71 % and 21 % of tested soils, respectively. In 8 % of soils, L. monocytogenes was either absent or below detection limits as soon as 7 days after inoculation. This suggests that L. monocytogenes survival depends on abiotic and/or biotic factors. Statistical analysis evidenced that land use and spatial localization of soils did not significantly affect L. monocytogenes survival. Variance partitioning demonstrated that 60 % of the differences between survival rates at 7 and 14 days were explained by soil chemical properties. <b>Basic</b> <b>cation</b> saturation ratio was the major soil chemical characteristic explaining short-term survival. Cationic exchange capacity and exchangeable calcium further explained survival of L. monocytogenes at 7 days and 14 days respectively. Long-term survival was driven mainly by soil texture (11 % of the variance), especially clay content. Survival of L. monocytogenes in sterile soils differed markedly. Indeed, 4 sterilised soils supported growth of L. monocytogenes while the rate of decrease was lower in the other sterilised soils than when microflora was active. This result points out the critical role played by both the soil microflora and the soil physico-chemical properties in determining the survival rate of L. monocytogenes...|$|E
40|$|A maioria dos solos brasileiros caracteriza-se por apresentar baixa fertilidade natural, nos quais destacam-se a acidez elevada e a baixa saturação por bases como os principais limitantes ao desenvolvimento da maioria das culturas. No sistema plantio direto (SPD), a correção do solo de manutenção é feita pela calagem {{superficial}}, restringindo a reação do corretivo nas proximidades do local de aplicação. A correção das camadas subsuperficiais depende do tempo, da dose do corretivo e de reações adicionais tais como formação de complexos orgânicos com Al, Ca e Mg, aumentando a mobilidade destes cátions no perfil do solo, potencializando o efeito da calagem. O objetivo do trabalho foi avaliar o efeito de coberturas vegetais na reação da calagem superficial e as alterações químicas no perfil do solo. Foram desenvolvidos experimentos em laboratório e a campo no Instituto Agronômico do Paraná, IAPAR, Londrina/PR. Em laboratório, colunas preenchidas com um Latossolo Vermelho distróférrico com ausência e aplicação superficial de calcário foram percoladas com extratos de soja, milho, trigo, aveia e nabo. A campo, microparcelas contendo Latossolo Vermelho distróférrico, com calagem superficial, foram submetidas aos seguintes tratamentos com coberturas vegetais no inverno: solo descoberto, trigo, rotação nabo-aveia, mistura nabo+aveia. No verão utilizou-se a rotação soja/milho. Os extratos vegetais de adubos verdes associados à calagem superficial aumentaram o pH, os teores de Ca, Mg, K e a saturação por bases até as camadas subsuperficiais do solo, enquanto a calagem isolada apresentou efeito somente na superfície. Na ausência da calagem, os efeitos também foram observados até subsuperfície, sendo o resíduo de nabo o mais efetivo. A campo, observaram-se melhorias nas características químicas do solo na presença das coberturas vegetais até 40 cm de profundidade, com efeitos mais pronunciados no pH, acidez potencial e saturação por bases com o tratamento mistura nabo + aveia. No entanto, este efeito foi menor após 24 meses da calagem superficial. As coberturas vegetais influenciaram o rendimento de grãos de soja e de milho, sendo o maior efeito observado para o trigo e mistura, respectivamente. Compostos orgânicos hidrossolúveis presentes nos extratos vegetais foram responsáveis, em parte, pelas alterações químicas no perfil do solo, em ambos os experimentos. As coberturas vegetais na superfície do solo podem beneficiar o efeito da calagem e promover melhorias nas características químicas até as camadas subsuperficiais, através da liberação de compostos orgânicos solúveis. The Brazilian {{soils are}} characterized by low natural fertility, where the main chemical limitations are high acidity and low basic exchangeable cation saturation that can affect the majority of cash crop productions. Liming is the principal practice to reduce soil acidity and to increase basic cations in these soils with high pH-dependent cation exchangeable capacity (CEC). Under no tillage system, liming is applied on the soil surface without mechanical incorporation in the soil profile, which chemical effects have been limited to the local of application. The correction of subsoil acidity depends on the time, the lime rates and the metal organic complexes formed by organic anions released from organic residues with Ca and Mg, increasing their mobility?s in the soil profile and the neutralization of free toxic Al 3 +. The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the effects of winter cover crops on the superficial lime reaction and the chemical changes in the soil profile. Laboratory and field experiments were conducted in the headquarters of the Instituto Agronômico do Paraná, IAPAR, at Londrina, Brazil. Under laboratory conditions, soil columns were filled up with samples of a dystropheric red latosol (Oxisol) with and without superficial lime application. Then, plant extract of soybean, corn, wheat, black oats and radish were applied on the soil surface. Under field condition, micro-plots with a dystrophic red latosol were superficially limed and cultivated with the following winter cover crops: wheat, radish-black outs rotations and mixtures of radish+black outs. An addition treatment was included with bare soil. In the summer time, all treatments were conducted with soybean-corn rotation. Laboratory experiments showed that plant extracts associated with superficial lime application increased pH, Ca, Mg, K and <b>basic</b> <b>cation</b> saturation from the superficial to the sub superficial soil profile. Lime without plant extract showed effects in the upper superficial soil layer only. Without lime treatment, plant extract showed chemical effects down to the sub soil surface. Radish was the best plant extract for changing soil chemical properties under both liming and no liming treatments. Under field conditions, the results showed that all soil winter cover crops improved soil chemical characteristics from the superficial to 40 cm depth soil layers. The mixture radish+black outs showed the most pronounced effects on pH, potential acidity and <b>basic</b> <b>cation</b> saturation. However, these effects decreased after 24 months of superficial lime application. The winter cover crops also improved the soybean and corn grain yields in the summer. The best results were observed for wheat and radish+black outs mixture treatments. Water soluble organic molecules present in the plant extracts were suggested to be responsible, in part, for the chemical changes in the soil profile in both experiments. The soil plant covers showed to be beneficial for speeding up lime reactions in acid soils and improving soil chemical characteristics by releasing soluble organic compounds...|$|E

The impacts of these treatments on some selected properties and changes in water soluble bases in these soils were studied at different periods of 180 days of incubation. The application of BS was found to be increased the pH of soils from 3. 6 to 5. 1 for Cheringa; 3. 9 to 5. 2 for Badarkhali soils during the 180 days of incubation. These increments were more striking with the highest doses of BS at 33 t ha- 1 under saturated moisture conditions in both the soils. The EC of the soils had not much influenced by the application of BS, regardless of time. The treatments were exerted significant (p≤ 0. 05) effects on the solubility of <b>basic</b> <b>cations</b> in different periods of incubation. The maximum release of the bases were recorded during 180 days of incubation under saturated moisture condition and the findings will be supportive for planning of crop production on these soils...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the complex issue of {{reversing}} long-term improvements of fertility in soils derived from heathlands and acidic grasslands using sulfur-based amendments. The experiment was conducted on a former heathland and acid grassland in the U. K. that was heavily fertilized and limed with rock phosphate, chalk, and marl. The experimental work had three aims. First, to determine whether sulfurous soil amendments are able to lower pH to a level suitable for heathland and acidic grassland re-creation (approximately 3 pH units). Second, to determine what effect the soil amendments have on the available pool of some <b>basic</b> <b>cations</b> and some potentially toxic acidic cations that may affect the plant community. Third, {{to determine whether the}} addition of Fe to the soil system would sequester PO 4 − ions that might be liberated from rock phosphate by the experimental treatments. The application of S 0 and Fe(II) SO 4 − to the soil was able to reduce pH. However, only the highest S 0 treatment (2, 000 kg/ha S) lowered pH sufficiently for heathland restoration purposes but effectively so. Where pH was lowered, <b>basic</b> <b>cations</b> were lost from the exchangeable pool and replaced by acidic cations. Where Fe was added to the soil, {{there was no evidence of}} PO 4 − sequestration from soil test data (Olsen P), but sequestration was apparent because of lower foliar P in the grass sward. The ability of the forb Rumex acetosella to apparently detoxify Al 3 +, prevalent in acidified soils, appeared to give it a competitive advantage over other less tolerant species. We would anticipate further changes in plant community structure through time, driven by Al 3 + toxicity, leading to the competitive exclusion of less tolerant species. This, we suggest, is a key abiotic driver in the restoration of biotic (acidic plant) communities...|$|R
40|$|Salinity {{levels in}} soils of the Outer Coastal Plain of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, can be high, due to excess of Na in the {{irrigation}} water, evapotranspiration and soil development from marine sediments. The cultivation of irrigated rice {{could be an}} alternative, since ion uptake as well as leaching by {{the establishment of a}} water layer could mitigate the effects of soil salinity. This study aimed to evaluate the dynamics of <b>basic</b> <b>cations</b> in the solution of Albaqualf soils with different salinity levels growing irrigated rice. The plow layer contained exchangeable Na percentages (ESP) of 5. 6, 9. 0, 21. 2 and 32. 7 %. The plant stand, dry matter, Na, K and Ca + Mg uptake at full flowering and grain yield were evaluated. The levels of Na, K, Ca + Mg and electrical conductivity (EC) in the soil solution were also measured weekly during the rice cycle at four soil depths, in the water layer and irrigation water. The Na, K and Ca + Mg uptake by rice at full flowering was used to estimate ion depletion from the layer under root influence. Soil salinity induced a reduction in the rice stand, especially in the soil with ESP of 32. 7 %, resulting in lower cation uptake and very low yield at that site. As observed in the water layer and irrigation water, the Na, K, Ca + Mg and EC levels in the soil solution decreased with time at depths of 5, 10 and 20 cm, regardless of the original soil salinity, showing that cation dynamics in the plow layer was determined by leaching and root uptake, rather than by the effect of evapoconcentration of <b>basic</b> <b>cations</b> in the soil surface layer...|$|R
