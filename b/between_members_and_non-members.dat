40|$|INTRODUCTION The main {{means of}} {{achieving}} trade liberalization have been (1) multilateral agreements {{within the framework}} of GATT and more recently the WTO and (2) discriminatory regional agreements which attempt to liberalize trade among members of the regional agreement but not with respect to non-members. Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) is a group of countries in or bordering on the Pacific which since November, 1989 has chosen to take a rather different approach to trade liberalization. In particular, in Bogor, Indonesia in 1994 (the Bogor Declaration), the heads of state of APEC member countries (currently including some twenty-one countries and accounting for almost 50 percent of world trade) committed APEC to achieving 2 free trade by 2010 for its industrialized <b>members</b> <b>and</b> 2020 for its non-industrialized members but without discriminating <b>between</b> <b>member</b> <b>and</b> <b>non-member</b> countries (an approach which is known as open re...|$|R

30|$|The {{magnitude}} {{of the effect of}} SAFTA and AFTA is always higher in full GE in comparison to conditional GE, because in full GE, we open the channel of changes in output and expenditure, which is endogenous to the factory-gate prices. Hence, higher prices producers gain more in the full GE scenario. Although hypothetically it is acknowledged that trade creation brings trade diversion, i.e., when two countries sign a trade agreement, previous partner of this two countries will lose their market in member countries, According to standard study of gravity model (e.g., Larch and Yotov 2016), the trade diversion effect is smaller than trade creation effect. Because of the effect of an RTA on third countries comes from the changes in multilateral resistance terms <b>between</b> <b>member</b> <b>and</b> <b>non-member</b> countries, which are the second-order general equilibrium effect.

40|$|The {{assignment}} of policy competencies to the European Union {{has reduced the}} divergence of party policy positions nationally, leaving the electorate with fewer policy options. Building upon insights from spatial proximity theories of party competition, the convergence argument predicts convergence particularly in policy domains with increasing EU competence. As the policy commitments that derive from EU membership increase, parties become more constrained {{in terms of the}} feasible policy alternative they can implement when in office. The analysis uses manifesto data at the country-party system level for nine policy domains. It uses ordinary least squares (OLS) estimation with country fixed effects, a lagged dependent variable and country corrected standard errors. Controlling for other factors that could plausibly explain policy convergence, the models also assess whether the convergent effect of party positions varies across different types of parties. The main finding is that in policy domains where the involvement of the EU has increased, the distance between parties' positions tends to decrease. The constraining impact of EU policy decisions differs <b>between</b> <b>Member</b> <b>and</b> <b>non-Member</b> States.

The {{aim of this study}} was to assess effectiveness of a community based health insurance (CBHI) scheme on utilization of health services as well as on mortality and morbidity. Methods Data were collected from April to December 2007 from the Nouna’s Demographic Surveillance System on overall mortality, utilization of health services, household characteristics, distance to health facilities, membership in the Nouna CBHI. We analyzed differentials in overall mortality and selected maternal health process measures <b>between</b> <b>members</b> <b>and</b> <b>non-members</b> of the insurance scheme. Results After adjusting for covariates there was no significant difference in overall mortality between households who could not have been members (because their area was yet to be covered by the stepped-wedged scheme), non-members but whose households could have been members (areas covered but not enrolled), and members of the insurance scheme. The risk of overall mortality increased significantly with distance to health facility (35 % more outside Nouna town) and with education level (37 % lower when at least primary school education achieved in households). Conclusion There was no statistically significant difference in overall mortality <b>between</b> <b>members</b> <b>and</b> <b>non-members.</b> The enrolment rates remain low, with selection bias. It is important that community based health insurances, exemptions fees policy and national health insurances be evaluated on prevention of deaths and severe morbidities instead of on drop-out rates, selection bias, adverse selection and catastrophic payments for health care only.

40|$|Objective: To {{examine whether}} the {{community-based}} health insurance (CBHI) scheme in Burkina Faso {{has been effective}} in providing equitable healthcare access to poor individuals, women, children and those living far from health facilities. Methods: We used the Nouna Health District Household Survey to collect panel data on 990 households during 2004 – 08. By applying a series of random effects regressions and using concentration curves, we first studied determinants of CBHI enrolment and then assessed differences in healthcare utilization <b>between</b> <b>members</b> <b>and</b> <b>non-members.</b> We studied differences with regard to rich and poor, men and women, children and adults and those living far vs those living close to health facilities. Findings: With regard to enrolment, we found that poor (odds ratio [OR] = 0. 274) and children (OR = 0. 456) {{were less likely to}} enrol while gender and distance were not significantly correlated to enrolment. In terms of utilization, poor (coefficient = 0. 349), women (coefficient = 0. 131) and children (coefficient = 0. 190) with CBHI had higher utilization than the group without CBHI. We also found that {{there was no significant difference}} in utilization <b>between</b> <b>members</b> <b>and</b> <b>non-members</b> if they were living far from health facilities. Conclusion: The CBHI scheme in this case was only partially successful in achieving the equity objectives. This study advises policy makers in Burkina Faso and elsewhere, who see CBHI schemes as a silver bullet to achieve universal health coverage, to be mindful of the chronically low enrolment rates and more importantly the lack of equity across the various groups that this study has highlighted...|$|E

These results indicate that equating specific tier membership of a loyalty programme to a high level of loyalty towards an airline cannot be generally accepted. Recommendations flowing from the research would include that the tier-structure of FFPs may need to be reconsidered to achieve the actual benefits for which they were created. The findings also imply that members of the FFP are not necessarily more loyal than non-members and calls for an in-depth analysis to establish which mediating factors within the loyalty programme will have an inducing effect on the level of loyalty towards the airline.

30|$|On the contrary, a FTA can divert {{trade flows}} {{due to its}} nature of {{discrimination}} <b>between</b> <b>member</b> nations <b>and</b> <b>non-member</b> nations. As tariff and non-tariff barriers are removed only within the FTA members, a FTA can make member nations divert imports from non-member nations into the member nations simply because the member countries enjoy preferential tariffs. On that ground, trade diversion occurs, worsening global resource allocation and shifting production away from comparative advantage. Therefore, a trade-diverting FTA leads to both trade creation and trade diversion, and can improve or worsen the welfare of members depending on the relative strength of these two opposing forces (Viner 1950; Dominick 2007; Katsioloudes and Hadjidakis 2007; Plummer et al. 2010; Nguyen 2011; Hoang et al. 2005; Negais 2009).|$|R

On the other hand, self-selection fails to explain the lower earnings associated with higher ethnic clustering for immigrants with post-secondary schooling.

Whilst income inelastic, health expenditures are found to be significantly influenced by an individuals level of income, irrespective of insurance status. Despite this, insurance reduces expenditures significantly more for the poor than for the rich. Voluntary health insurance Private health expenditures Vietnam...|$|R

I show, however, that governments will endorse only welfare-improving arrangements, in spite of their political motivations; as a result, FTA members benefit from ratified arrangements as well.
