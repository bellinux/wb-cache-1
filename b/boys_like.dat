Sol {{has never met}} a girl like Naz before, and Cole said Naz {{probably}} has not met <b>boys</b> <b>like</b> Sol before either. Hussen said {{that there is something}} about Sol that attracts Naz. She is stronger than he is so Naz likes to take him in and teach him things. Cole explained that Sol is attracted to Naz because she is different from other girls and they are complete opposites. and Sol depends on him. Looking after Sol takes a toll on Asher, however. One of Cole's first scenes to film was a kiss between Sol and Naz. Cole found it tough and awkward as the actors had only just met, and would have preferred it to be filmed later on, but said that the scene was awkward anyway so {{he did not have to}} act much for it. Sol has also been described as shy, caring, sweet, thoughtful, soft, easily hurt and reserved.|$|E

Rascal Flatts perform acoustic versions of previous efforts originally released on Feels Like Today (2004) and Me and My Gang (2006). When approached about participating in the soundtrack, Taylor Swift sent her ballad [...] "Crazier" [...] because it [...] "was perfect to fall in love to".

500|$|MTV Unplugged {{consists}} of two discs. The first, which is a Compact Disc, contains acoustic renditions of her songs [...] "I Kissed a Girl", [...] "Ur So Gay", [...] "Thinking of You", [...] "Waking Up in Vegas", and [...] "Lost" [...] from One of the Boys, a cover version of a song by American power pop band Fountains of Wayne, [...] "Hackensack", and a new song titled [...] "Brick by Brick". Perry explained why she sang it during MTV Unplugged, saying that she related to the lyrics of [...] "having a loyal lover [...] friend back home when she's on the road", though, directly, the song does not narrate any event of Perry's life. The versions performed incorporate lighter genres than pop rock, which is embraced in One of the <b>Boys,</b> <b>like</b> jazz and lounge music, particularly in [...] "I Kissed a Girl". The second disc is a DVD, containing the video recording of the performance, recorded at NEP Midtown Studios, located in New York City.

500|$|Swift contributed backing vocals to John Mayer's [...] "Half of My Heart", {{a single}} {{featured}} on his fourth album, Battle Studies (2009).

The romantic comedy, released the following year, saw her play the ditzy girlfriend of a high school jock, a role in which Los Angeles Times found [...] "serious comedic potential".

500|$|Themes in Lavigne's music include {{messages}} of self-empowerment from a female or an adolescent view. Lavigne believes her [...] "songs are about being yourself {{no matter what}} and going after your dreams even if your dreams are crazy and even if people tell you they're never going to come true." [...] On her debut album, Let Go, Lavigne preferred the less mainstream songs, such as [...] "Losing Grip", instead of her more radio-friendly singles, such as [...] "Complicated", saying that [...] "the songs I did with the Matrix... were good for my first record, but I don't {{want to be that}} pop anymore." [...] Lavigne's second album, Under My Skin, had deeper personal themes underlying each song, saying that [...] "I've gone through so much, so that's what I talk about... Like <b>boys,</b> <b>like</b> dating or relationships". Musically, it's considered her heaviest album that showcased ballads and rocker songs with a more post-grunge sound that verged on nü-metal style. [...] In contrast, her third album, The Best Damn Thing, was not personal to her. [...] "Some of the songs I wrote didn't even mean that much to me. It's not like some personal thing I'm going through." [...] Her objective in writing the album was simply to [...] "make it fun". The style has been praised for her ability to combine bubblegum pop melodies with punk rock riffs. Goodbye Lullaby, Lavigne's fourth album, was much more personal than her earlier records, with Lavigne describing the album as [...] "more stripped down, deeper. All the songs are very emotional". Ian McKellen defined her as [...] "a punk chanteuse, a post-grunge valkyrie, with the wounded soul of a poet and the explosive pugnacity of a Canadian" [...] on The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson in 2007.|$|E
