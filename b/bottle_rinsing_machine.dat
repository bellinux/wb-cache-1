40|$|The brewing {{industry}} is a large consumer of groundwater for brewing, rinsing and cooling purposes. As regulations {{become more and more}} stringent and the cost of water increases, water recycling gains interest. This paper investigates the possibilities of nanofiltration for the treatment of brewery waste water streams in view of recycling. Four different water streams (waste water after biological treatment, <b>bottle</b> <b>rinsing</b> water, rinsing water of the brewing room and rinsing water of the bright beer reservoir) were filtered with four different nanofiltration membranes (UTC- 20, UTC- 60, Desal-HL- 51 and Desal- 5 -DK). The results for the biologically treated waste water were the most promising. For the other streams, rejection of organics was insufficient to obtain the required quality, mainly due to the high concentrations of organics such as ethanol in the feed water. Over the periods considered (3 h) only moderate flux decline (10 - 40 %) was observed for most membranes and feed solutions. For Desal- 5 -DK at high pH, an increase of the flux was observed.

40|$|Pasteurized {{bottled milk}} {{supplied}} {{by a single}} dairy was frequently found to be contaminated with Yersinia spp. Investigations were carried out at the dairy {{in an effort to}} pinpoint the source of these organisms. Viable counts obtained from milk <b>bottle</b> <b>rinses</b> indicated that <b>bottle</b> washing was often unsatisfactory, and on one occasion Y. frederiksenii was isolated from the pooled rinse water of six bottles. Samples of milk were taken on arrival at the dairy and at various stages following pasteurization. Heat resistance tests carried out on strains of yersinia isolated from pasteurized milk indicated that they would not survive the pasteurization process. However two strains of yersinia were isolated from a sample of milk taken immediately after pasteurization but before bottling. The thermograph indicated that the time/temperature conditions applied during pasteurization were adequate. The presence of yersinia strains in the milk at this stage therefore suggests that undetectable levels of raw milk were being allowed to contaminate the pasteurized milk. The absence of yersinia in cartoned samples produced on the same day as contaminated bottled samples indicated that environmental contamination of the bottle filler valve also may have occurred at times. Results of this investigation indicate that increased vigilance is required to ensure proper operation of pasteurizers and bottle washers...|$|R

30|$|A {{total of}} 100 samples from boreholes, open wells and springs (67 from the Banana Plain; 33 from springs only, in the Mount Cameroon area) were {{collected}} in April 2009 and January 2010. Available water resources in the study areas were randomly sampled with emphasis laid on uniform spatial distribution. Locations and altitudes of selected sample sites were determined on the field using a Garmin GPS. All the samples, collected in tightly capped high-quality polyethylene bottles, were immediately transported under low temperature conditions in ice box and stored at 4  °C until analysis. Water {{from most of the}} springs sampled was pumped to the surface using a peristaltic pump equipped with a tubing. The end of the tubing was placed as near as possible to the spring vent. Some spring samples were collected without the use of the pump when sampling containers could easily be placed directly in the spring outflow. Water was collected from open wells using drawing buckets tied with ropes, while boreholes were pumped for 5 – 15  min before sampling. These waters were poured into 500 -ml-capacity plastic <b>bottles</b> after <b>rinsing</b> with the sample and preserved airtight to avoid evaporation. Physico-chemical parameters like pH, electrical conductivity (EC), water temperature, oxygen reduction potential (ORP) and dissolved oxygen (DO) of sampled springs were measured in situ using pH/EC/temperature TOA-DKK meter, TOA-DKK ORP meter and a TOA-DKK DO meter, respectively.|$|R

40|$|Aim: The aim of {{this study}} is to assess {{radiation}} health risk due to gamma exposure from river water around oil bunkering centers in Rivers state, Nigeria. Study Design: This study was purely an experimental work. Place and Duration of Study: Sampling started from the meeting point of Otamiri tributary and Imo River at the Abia /Rivers boundary to over seven kilometers along the Imo River; between July 2016 and January, 2017. Methodology: 20 samples of river water were collected along coastal shore of Imo River with pre-washed 1. 5 ml Polypropylene bottles. The <b>bottles</b> were <b>rinsed</b> with the water before collection and acidified immediately after collection with few drops of nitric acid. The bottles were sealed tightly with vinyl tapes and kept in the laboratory for 4 weeks for secular equilibrium of the radionuclides. The activity concentration of the radionuclides was measured using well calibrated Sodium Iodide detector. Results: The mean activity concentrations of 238 U, 232 Th and 40 K were 2. 02 ± 0. 02, 3. 59 ± 0. 21 and 10. 43 ± 1. 13 BqL- 1. The mean annual effective dose estimated for infants, children and adult citizens that ingest river water sampled were 58. 64, 0. 19 and 0. 24 mSvy- 1 respectively. The values of annual effective dose for infants and adults exceeded the reference levels of 0. 26, 0. 2 and 0. 10 mSvy- 1 respectively while that for children is within the safe reference level. The estimated fatal cancer risk to adult citizens and the lifetime hereditary effects show that 53 out of 10, 000 citizens may suffer some form of cancer fatality and 596 out of 1000, 000 citizens may suffer some form of hereditary effect since the values exceeded the USEPA recommended range. Conclusion: The result of this study show that the river water under study has been radiologically impacted by oil bunking activities and may cause significant health risk.

Most of the sampled wells were fitted with a standard Bangladesh number- 6 hand pump. Prior to sampling each well were pumped for few minutes until it purged out approximately twice the well volume, or until steady state chemical conditions (pH, EC and temperature) were obtained. pH of the water samples were measured on spot by using pH meter (EcoScan Ion- 6, Singapore); total dissolved solids (TDS) were measured by (HANNA HI 8734, Romania) portable meter. Electric conductivity (EC) and salinity were measured by portable EC meter (HANNA HI 8033, Romania). Temperature was also measured simultaneously by using the same TDS meter. The geographical location of each wells were determined with a GARMIN handheld global positioning system (GPS) and the approximate depth of wells were noted from the well owner’s records. Samples for major ion (Na+, K+, Ca 2 +, Mg 2 +, Cl–, SO 4 2 –, NO 3 – and HCO 3 −) analysis were collected in 500  mL polyethylene bottles.

Natural abundance samples for particulate organic carbon, used as t-zero values, were obtained by filtering 4 L water samples onto pre-combusted GF/F filters. All filters were snap frozen in liquid N and stored at - 80 °C. Back on land, the filters were acidified and dried overnight at 60 °C. Samples were analysed at the Isotopic Laboratory at UC Davis, California, with an Elementar Vario EL Cube or Micro Cube elemental analyser (Elementar Analysensysteme GmbH, Hanau, Germany), interfaced to a PDZ Europa 20 - 20 isotope ratio mass spectrometer (Sercon Ltd., Cheshire, UK). The external error of analyses was 0. 2 per mil for d 13 C. C fixat assimilation ion rates (rho in nmol/L/h) were calculated following Dugdale and Goering (1967) and Knap et al. (1996) ...|$|R
