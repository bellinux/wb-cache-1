5|$|The North American {{release of}} the game as Dragon Warrior II was created by Enix {{themselves}} and published in 1990. Unlike the original Japanese Famicom version, which used passwords for saving, the NES version used an internal <b>battery</b> <b>backup</b> instead to record the player's progress. The storyline introduction in Moonbrooke is presented exclusively in Dragon Warrior II. In the Japanese original, the game starts right with the injured soldier from Moonbrooke entering Midenhall castle, seeking help from its king. The dialogue of the American localization often used (intentionally) archaic English vocabulary, among other differences from the Japanese version. Like Dragon Warrior, the American version of Dragon Warrior II was censored in some aspects; for example, it used a ghost-like sprite instead of the original defeated character's coffin with cross sprite.|$|E

50|$|In {{the areas}} that are prone to power interruptions, adding <b>battery</b> <b>backups</b> to the traffic {{controller}} systems can enhance {{the safety of the}} motorists and pedestrians. In the past, a larger capacity of uninterruptible power supply would be required to continue the full operations of the traffic signals using incandescent lights. The cost for such system would be prohibitive. After the newer generations of traffic signals that use LED lights which consume 85-90% less energy, it is now possible to incorporate <b>battery</b> <b>backups</b> into the traffic light systems. The <b>battery</b> <b>backups</b> would be installed in the traffic controller cabinet or in their own cabinet adjacent to the controller.|$|R

50|$|The <b>battery</b> <b>backups</b> {{can operate}} the {{controller}} in emergency mode {{with the red}} light flashing or in fully functional mode. In 2004, California Energy Commission recommended to have local governments to convert their traffic lights to LEDs with <b>battery</b> <b>backups.</b> This would lower the energy consumption and enhance the safety at major intersections. The recommendation was for a system which provides fully functional traffic signals for two hours after the power outage. Then the signals will have flashing red lights for another two hours.|$|R
25|$|RTCs {{must run}} {{continuously}} {{in order to}} keep track of elapsed time. To do this they must sometimes run from small batteries and therefore must operate at very low power levels. They are generally moderate-sized ICs with up to 20 pins for power, <b>battery</b> <b>backup,</b> digital interface, and various other functions.|$|E
25|$|In new construction, minimum {{requirements}} are typically more stringent. All smoke detectors must be hooked {{directly to the}} electrical wiring, be interconnected and have a <b>battery</b> <b>backup.</b> In addition, smoke detectors are required either inside or outside every bedroom, depending on local codes. Smoke detectors on the outside will detect fires more quickly, assuming the fire does not begin in the bedroom, {{but the sound of}} the alarm will be reduced and may not wake some people. Some areas also require smoke detectors in stairways, main hallways and garages.|$|E
25|$|Smaller, less expensive, {{smoke alarm}} systems, {{typically}} {{used in a}} domestic/residential environment, may be individual standalone units, or interconnected. They typically generate a loud acoustic warning signal as their only action. Several detectors (whether standalone or interconnected) are normally used in the rooms of a dwelling. There are inexpensive smoke alarms that may be interconnected so that any detector that triggers sounds all alarms. They are powered by mains electricity, with disposable or rechargeable <b>battery</b> <b>backup.</b> They may be interconnected by wires, or wirelessly.They are required in new installations in some jurisdictions.|$|E

25|$|At {{the moment}} the {{stabilizer}} separated from the aircraft, the plane pitched downwards, headed straight for Belle Harbor. As the pilots struggled to control the aircraft, it went into a flat spin. The resulting aerodynamic loads sheared both engines from the aircraft seconds before impact. The engines landed several blocks north and east of the main wreckage site. Losing the engines cut off power to the FDR at 9:16:00, while the CVR (cockpit voice recorder), utilizing a <b>battery</b> <b>backup,</b> cut off at 9:16:15 moments before impact with the ground. The main impact location was the intersection of Newport Avenue and Beach 131st Street.|$|E
25|$|Typically action RPGs feature {{each player}} {{directly}} controlling a single character in real time, and feature a strong focus on combat and action with plot and character interaction {{kept to a}} minimum. Early action RPGs tended to follow the template set by 1980s Nihon Falcom titles such as the Dragon Slayer and Ys series, which feature hack and slash combat where the player character's movements and actions are controlled directly, using a keyboard or game controller, rather than using menus. This formula was refined by the action-adventure game, The Legend of Zelda (1986), which set the template used by many subsequent action RPGs, including innovations such as an open world, nonlinear gameplay, <b>battery</b> <b>backup</b> saving, and an attack button that animates a sword swing or projectile attack on the screen. The game was {{largely responsible for the}} surge of action-oriented RPGs released since the late 1980s, both in Japan and North America. The Legend of Zelda series would continue to exert an influence on the transition of both console and computer RPGs from stat-heavy, turn-based combat towards real-time action combat in the following decades.|$|E

500|$|The use {{of carbon}} {{monoxide}} detectors has been standardized in many areas. In the USA, NFPA 720-2009, the carbon monoxide detector guidelines published by the National Fire Protection Association, mandates the placement {{of carbon monoxide}} detectors/alarms on every level of the residence, including the basement, in addition to outside sleeping areas. In new homes, AC-powered detectors must have <b>battery</b> <b>backup</b> and be interconnected to ensure early warning of occupants at all levels. NFPA 720-2009 is the first national carbon monoxide standard to address devices in non-residential buildings.

500|$|The United States Consumer Product Safety Commission has stated, [...] "carbon {{monoxide}} detectors are {{as important}} to home safety as smoke detectors are," [...] and recommends each home {{have at least one}} carbon monoxide detector, and preferably one on each level of the building. These devices, which are relatively inexpensive and widely available, are either battery- or AC-powered, with or without <b>battery</b> <b>backup.</b> In buildings, carbon monoxide detectors are usually installed around heaters and other equipment. If a relatively high level of carbon monoxide is detected, the device sounds an alarm, giving people the chance to evacuate and ventilate the building.
