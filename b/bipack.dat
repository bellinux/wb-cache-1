25|$|This was {{the fifth}} film {{collaboration}} between the Coen Brothers and Deakins, and it was slated to be shot in Mississippi {{at a time of}} year when the foliage, grass, trees, and bushes would be a lush green. It was filmed near locations in Canton, Mississippi and Florence, South Carolina in the summer of 1999. After shooting tests, including film <b>bipack</b> and bleach bypass techniques, Deakins suggested digital mastering be used. Deakins subsequently spent 11 weeks fine-tuning the look, mainly targeting the greens, making them a burnt yellow and desaturating the overall image in the digital files. This made it the first feature film to be entirely color corrected by digital means, narrowly beating Nick Park's Chicken Run.|$|E
2500|$|The {{invention}} of Prizma {{led to a}} series of similarly printed color processes. [...] This <b>bipack</b> color system used two strips of film running through the camera, one recording red, and one recording blue-green light. With the black-and-white negatives being printed onto duplitized film, the color images were then toned red and blue, effectively creating a subtractive color print.|$|E

The packing problem is to determine the maximum number of blocks in a packing design. Packing with λ= 2 is called <b>bipacking.</b> In this paper we solve the <b>bipacking</b> problem in the case κ= 5 and ν≡ 13 (mod 20) ...|$|R
5000|$|Various {{improvements}} and {{extensions of the}} process followed, the most famous being Carroll D. Dunning's, an early method built on the <b>bipacking</b> technique and used for creating traveling mattes. It is described thus: ...|$|R
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, the Williams process, invented by cinematographer Frank D. Williams, {{did not require}} a system of colored lights and {{could be used for}} wider shots. It was used in the scene where Kong is shaking the sailors off the log, as well as the scene where Kong pushes the gates open. The Williams process did not use <b>bipacking,</b> but rather an optical printer, the first such device that {{synchronized}} a projector with a camera, so that several strips of film could be combined into a single composted image. Through the use of the optical printer, the special effects crew could film the foreground, the stop-motion animation, the live-action footage, and the background, and combine all of those elements into one single shot. The optical printer would continue to be used for films until the late 1980s, when they were superseded by digital composting.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Bipack</b> color {{refers to}} the type of camera load that is used for the effect. <b>Bipack</b> {{photography}} refers to two strips running through the camera at once, for the purpose of recording two different spectra of light, generally.|$|E

50|$|The most {{difficult}} {{task for the}} special effects artists to achieve was to make live-action footage interact with separately filmed stop-motion animation - to make {{the interaction between the}} humans and the creatures of the island seem believable. The most simple of these effects were accomplished by exposing part of the frame, than running the same piece of the film through the camera again by exposing {{the other part of the}} frame with a different image. The most complex shots, where the live-action actors interacted with the stop-motion animation, were achieved via two different techniques, the Dunning process and the Williams process, in order to produce the effect of a travelling matte. The Dunning process, invented by cinematographer Carroll H. Dunning, employed the use of blue and yellow lighting, filtered and photographed into black-and-white film. <b>Bipacking</b> of the camera was used for these types of effects. With it, the special effects crew could combine two strips of different film at the same time, creating the final composite shot in the camera. It was used in the climactic scene where one of the Curtiss Helldiver planes attacking Kong crashes from the top of the Empire State Building, and in the scene where natives are running through the foreground, while Kong is fighting other natives at the wall.|$|R
50|$|Care {{would be}} taken to avoid photographing objects of purple, {{lavender}} or pink coloring, as <b>bipack</b> color generally cannot reproduce these colors in printing.|$|E
50|$|<b>Bipack</b> and three-element tripack {{sandwiches}} {{of plates}} and films {{were used in}} some early color processes for still photography, the field in which the concept originated.|$|E
5000|$|Over the years, a {{great number}} of <b>bipack</b> color {{processors}} existed, largely {{due to the lack of}} holding patents on processing in this method. These systems included: ...|$|E
50|$|It is The first Indian colour film. The {{film was}} shot on Agfa B&W 35-mm negative. The release prints {{were made in}} Germany by <b>Bipack</b> colour {{printing}} process.|$|E
50|$|In <b>bipack</b> color {{photography}} for motion pictures, two {{strips of}} black-and-white 35 mm film, {{running through the}} camera emulsion to emulsion, are used to record two regions of the color spectrum, {{for the purpose of}} ultimately printing the images, in complementary colors, superimposed on one strip of film. The result is a multicolored projection print that reproduces a useful but limited range of color by the subtractive color method. <b>Bipack</b> processes became commercially practical in the early 1910s when Kodak introduced duplitized film print stock, which facilitated making two-color prints.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Bipack</b> {{photography}} was, {{from about}} 1935 to 1950, the most economical means of 35 mm natural color cinematography available, used when color was wanted but the budget {{could not bear}} the much higher cost of three-strip Technicolor or the less well-known alternative three-color processes sometimes available outside the US. After 1950, when economical [...] "monopack" [...] color negative and print stocks such as Eastmancolor and Ansco Color were introduced, the use of <b>bipack</b> photography and printing rapidly declined. By 1955 all two-color motion picture processes were commercially extinct in the US.|$|E
50|$|William Thomas Crespinel (9 July 1890 - 19 June 1987) was the {{inventor}} of a <b>bipack</b> process, which allowed any cinematic camera to shoot color film. In 1932 he developed Cinecolor.|$|E
50|$|In addition, Consolidated Film also {{owned the}} Trucolor color system, which was shot as <b>bipack</b> color, but {{processed}} with special duplitized stock {{produced by the}} Eastman Kodak company that carried a dye-coupler.|$|E
5000|$|For the Olympics, the Technicolor Corporation {{devised a}} <b>bipack</b> colour filming process - dubbed [...] "Technichrome" [...] - whereby {{hundreds}} of hours of film documented the events in colour, without having to use expensive and heavy Technicolor cameras.|$|E
50|$|The {{most famous}} version of Technicolor, the full-colour three-strip Technicolor Process 4 used from 1932 to 1955, exposed {{two of the}} three strips - the blue and red images - in <b>bipack.</b> The green record, the highest {{definition}} record, was exposed directly.|$|E
5000|$|Since {{the image}} must {{be focused on}} the plane of contact of the two negatives used, lenses and {{focusing}} screens used in <b>bipack</b> photography would be readjusted to throw the plane of focus [...]006" [...] behind that of the standard black-and-white plane.|$|E

50|$|The <b>bipack</b> process, {{which is}} a {{competing}} method to optical printing, was used until digital methods of compositing became predominant in the industry. Industrial Light and Magic used a specially-built rig built for The Empire Strikes Back that utilised the method to create matte painting composites.|$|E
50|$|In cinematography, bipacking, or a <b>bipack,</b> is {{the process}} of loading two reels of film into a camera, so that they both pass through the camera gate together. It was used both for in-camera effects (effects that are {{nowadays}} mainly achieved via optical printing) and as an early subtractive colour process.|$|E
50|$|In 1916, William Van Doren Kelley began {{developing}} Prizma, {{the first}} commercially viable American color process using 35 mm film. Initially, like Kinemacolor, it photographed the color elements {{one after the}} other and projected the results by additive synthesis. Ultimately, Prizma was refined to <b>bipack</b> photography, with two strips of film, one treated to be sensitive to red and the other not, running through the camera face to face. Each negative was printed on one surface of the same duplitized print stock and each resulting series of black-and-white images was chemically toned to transform the silver into a monochrome color, either orange-red or blue-green, resulting in a two-sided, two-colored print that could be shown with any ordinary projector. This system of two-color <b>bipack</b> photography and two-sided prints was the basis for many later color processes, such as Multicolor, Brewster Color and Cinecolor.|$|E
50|$|The {{invention}} of Prizma {{led to a}} series of similarly printed color processes. This <b>bipack</b> color system used two strips of film running through the camera, one recording red, and one recording blue-green light.

5000|$|... "Bipacks" [...] {{using only}} two {{emulsions}} face-to-face were {{the subject of}} some development. Although the range of colors which could be reproduced by only two components was limited, skin tones and most hair and eye colors could be rendered with surprising fidelity, making <b>bipack</b> processes a viable option for color portraiture. In commercial practice, however, the use of bipacks was almost entirely confined to two-color motion picture systems.|$|E
50|$|The {{foreground}} {{action is}} lighted with yellow light only {{in front of}} a uniform, strongly lighted blue backing. Panchromatic negative film is used in the camera as the rear component of a <b>bipack</b> in which the front film is a positive yellow dye image of the background scene. This yellow dye image is exposed on the negative by the blue light from the backing areas, but the yellow light from the foreground passes through it and records an image of the foreground at the same time.|$|E
5000|$|In 1950 Kodak {{announced}} the first Eastman color 35 mm negative film (along with a complementary positive film) that could record all three primary {{colors on the}} same strip of film. An improved version in 1952 was quickly adopted by Hollywood, making the use of three-strip Technicolor cameras and <b>bipack</b> cameras (used in two-color systems such as Cinecolor) obsolete in color cinematography. This [...] "monopack" [...] structure {{is made up of}} three separate emulsion layers, one sensitive to red light, one to green and one to blue.|$|E
50|$|In its {{original}} two-color version, Trucolor was a two-strip (red and green) process {{based on the}} earlier work of William Van Doren Kelley's Prizma color process. Trucolor films were shot in <b>bipack,</b> with the two strips of film being sensitized to red and green. Both negatives were processed on duplitized film, much like Trucolor's rival process Cinecolor. Unlike Cinecolor, however, the film was not dyed with a toner but a color coupler, similar to Eastmancolor film. Because of this chemical composition, Trucolor film fades over time, unlike Cinecolor.|$|E
5000|$|Eastman, Agfa, Gevaert, and DuPont all {{manufactured}} <b>bipack</b> film {{stocks for}} use in colour processes from the 1920s onwards. Two strips of film, one orthochromatic and having a very thin and superficial red dye layer on its emulsion, and one panchromatic, would be exposed together with their emulsions pressed into close contact, the orthochromatic one nearest the lens. The orthochromatic negative ended up reversed from the normal handedness, [...] but as the two negatives were often contact-printed onto one duplitized film for subsequent colour-toning, as in the Prizma process, this often worked {{to the advantage of}} the laboratory.|$|E
50|$|Technicolor's {{system was}} popular {{for a number}} of years, but it was an {{expensive}} process: shooting cost three times as much as black-and-white photography and printing costs were also much higher. By 1932, color photography in general had nearly been abandoned by the major studios, but then Technicolor introduced a new process which recorded all three primary colors. Utilizing a dichroic beam splitter sandwiched between two 45-degree prisms {{in the form of a}} cube, light from the lens was split into two paths to expose three black-and-white films (two of them in <b>bipack),</b> one each to record the densities for red, green and blue.|$|E

Deakins subsequently spent 11 weeks fine-tuning the look, mainly targeting the greens, making them a burnt yellow and desaturating the overall image in the digital files. This made it the first feature film to be entirely color corrected by digital means, narrowly beating Nick Park's Chicken Run.|$|E
50|$|Multicolor is a {{subtractive}} natural color {{motion picture}} process. Multicolor, {{introduced to the}} motion picture industry in 1929, {{was based on the}} earlier Prizma Color process, and was the forerunner of Cinecolor. For a Multicolor film, a scene is shot with a normal camera capable of bipacking film. Two black-and-white 35 mm film negatives are threaded <b>bipack</b> in the camera. One records the color red (via a dyed panchromatic film), and the other, blue (orthochromatic). In printing, duplitized stock is exposed and processed with one record on each side. In a tank of toning solution, the film is floated upon the top of the solution with the appropriate chemical. The cyan record is toned a complementary red with a copper ferrocyanide solution, and the red being toned blue/cyan with ferric ferrocyanide solution.|$|E
5000|$|In {{an article}} for the American Cinematographer, John Pavlus wrote: [...] "The film boasts an ambitious fusion of period {{lighting}} techniques, extensive effects sequences and a digital re-creation of two extinct cinema color processes: two-color and three-strip Technicolor." [...] For the first 52 minutes of the film, scenes appear in shades of only red and cyan blue; green objects are rendered as blue. This was done, according to Scorsese, to emulate the look of early <b>bipack</b> color films, in particular the Multicolor process, which Hughes himself owned, emulating the available technology of the era. Similarly, many of the scenes depicting events occurring after 1935 are treated to emulate the saturated appearance of three-strip Technicolor. Other scenes were stock footage colorized and incorporated into the film. The color effects were created by Legend Films.|$|E
50|$|Separation masters are {{a method}} of {{long-term}} preservation for most modern color motion picture film. Since monopack color film - (where materials for registering all {{the colors of the}} spectrum are contained on one film - its opposite is <b>bipack</b> colour film where two films face each other and the lower spectrum reds and yellows are on one film and the higher spectrum greens and blues are on another film - see Technicolor three strip) used in such processes as ECN, ECP and their successive revisions - contains photographically active color couplers which remain in the film after development, the emulsion will continue to produce chemical reactions in the image which cumulatively create a color fading, usually heavily biased towards the pink spectrum. In order to protect against this occurrence, the technique of separation masters was created.|$|E
