On the former, winds reached 55km/h (35mph) {{while on the}} latter, gusts peaked at 130km/h (80mph). The gusts on Chichi-jima caused the USS Cayuga County to broach in the harbor.|$|E
5|$|The cyclone caused heavy damage {{near where}} it moved ashore and along its path, {{resulting}} in ten deaths. Fanele struck Madagascar {{just two days}} after Tropical Storm Eric <b>brushed</b> <b>the</b> northeastern portion of the country. The two storms affected over 50,000people, of which at least 4,000 were left homeless. Fanele struck the country during a series of government protests, and consequentially relief efforts were hindered.|$|E
5|$|Throughout its track, Typhoon Roy was {{responsible}} for two fatalities and $28.5million (1988USD) in losses, mainly in the Mariana Islands.

5|$|A {{moderately}} strong hurricane with {{winds of}} 105mph (165km/h) was first spotted on October 6 east of Jamaica. Passing {{a short distance}} south of the island, the hurricane tracked northwestward and <b>brushed</b> <b>the</b> Yucatán Peninsula before turning north-northeastward into the Gulf of Mexico. Late on October 9, it made landfall a short distance east of Apalachicola, Florida at peak winds with an estimated pressure of 969mbar. Rapidly weakening to tropical storm status, the cyclone continued northeastward and emerged into the Atlantic Ocean from North Carolina on October 11. Later that day, it was last observed about 250mi (400km) southeast of Cape Cod.|$|E
5|$|Before Zeb <b>brushed</b> <b>the</b> {{east coast}} of Taiwan, a typhoon warning was issued, causing schools, {{government}} buildings, and financial markets to close. Airports and ferry travel were also disrupted. 183residents evacuated to storm shelters, including 50 from a nursing home. Hundreds of Chinese fishing boats rode out the storm in Taiwan harbors. Similarly to Taiwan, Zeb delayed ferry service in Japan, and caused 271domestic flights to be canceled. Train service was canceled on Kyushu during the storm.|$|E
5|$|Deep {{convection}} reformed the storm's center {{southwest of}} Haiti, near Jamaica's east coast. Under {{the influence of}} a mid-level ridge that extended from the Gulf of Mexico to the western Atlantic Ocean, Gustav picked up a westward motion. It was briefly disrupted by Jamaica as it passed over the mountainous island but rapidly strengthened when it moved over open water once again. Reaching Category4 strength less than 24 hours after having been a tropical storm, Gustav <b>brushed</b> <b>the</b> Isle of Youth and made landfall on Cuba's western's peninsula.|$|E

50|$|A {{spring is}} {{typically}} used with <b>the</b> <b>brush,</b> to maintain constant {{contact with the}} commutator. As <b>the</b> <b>brush</b> and commutator wear down, the spring steadily pushes <b>the</b> <b>brush</b> downwards towards <b>the</b> commutator. Eventually <b>the</b> <b>brush</b> wears small and thin enough that steady contact {{is no longer possible}} or it is no longer securely held in <b>the</b> <b>brush</b> holder, and so <b>the</b> <b>brush</b> must be replaced.|$|R
5|$|Fifteen {{countries}} {{felt the}} effects of Hurricane Dean as its path through the Caribbean Sea claimed 42lives. The hurricane first <b>brushed</b> <b>the</b> Lesser Antilles on August 17, 2007, and as it passed through {{the interior of the}} Caribbean its outer rain bands swept over the Greater Antilles. It passed Jamaica as a Category4 hurricane, and strengthened to a Category5 storm as it made landfall on Mexico's Yucatán Peninsula on August 21. A second landfall on August 22 was less devastating.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Dean was {{the fourth}} named storm and second {{hurricane}} of the 1989 Atlantic hurricane season. Dean formed on July 31 and reached tropical storm status the following day east of the Leeward Islands. Dean <b>brushed</b> <b>the</b> northern Leeward Islands as a Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale, bringing light rain but producing no damage, before turning northward and striking Bermuda as a Category 2 hurricane. Dean continued northward before making landfall in southeastern Newfoundland.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Kathleen was a {{tropical}} cyclone that caused destructive impacts in California. On September 7, 1976, {{a tropical}} depression formed; {{two days later}} it accelerated north towards the Baja California Peninsula. Kathleen <b>brushed</b> <b>the</b> Pacific coast of the peninsula as a hurricane on September 9 and made landfall as a fast-moving tropical storm the next day. With its circulation intact and still a tropical storm, Kathleen headed north into the United States and affected California and Arizona. Kathleen finally dissipated late on September 11.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was the {{evaluation}} of the dental plaque and the influence of determined hygienic factors on gingival recession occurrence in 455 students of The Medical University of Białystok. All the subjects were examined in artificial light, with the use of the probe, mirror, and parodontometer. The distribution of stained dental deposits were estimated with the use of the plaque index according to Quigley and Hein. Moreover, the students were to fill a survey of their own project concerning hygienic habits. The results underwent statistical analysis. The dental plaque was not present in 71 people. Gingival recession was revealed in 134 out of 455 subjects. The majority of medical students brushed their teeth twice a day, using medium hard toothbrush or electric toothbrush with appropriate movements and medium strength while <b>brushing.</b> <b>The</b> frequency of <b>brushing</b> <b>the</b> teeth, hardness of the toothbrush, the use of electric toothbrush, <b>the</b> movements during <b>brushing</b> <b>the</b> teeth, <b>the</b> strength of <b>brushing,</b> <b>the</b> frequency of toothbrush change, the age, and sex have significant influence on the number of recession. The increase in the gingival recession in students is connected with: large pressure on <b>the</b> <b>brush</b> while toothbrushing, too frequent brushing and toothbrush change, the use of hard toothbrush and additional hygienic items, movements while <b>brushing,</b> <b>the</b> age (the number of recession elevates with the age), and sex (women showed more recession than men) ...|$|R

5|$|In the {{two months}} after Katrina struck south Florida, Hurricane Rita <b>brushed</b> <b>the</b> region in late September with {{tropical}} storm-force winds and flooding rains. In late October, Hurricane Wilma struck southwestern Florida as a major hurricane, affecting the Miami area with hurricane-force winds that left 98% of south Florida without power. Including Hurricane Dennis in July, FEMA provided $1billion in public assistance to Florida residents {{in association with the}} four hurricanes in 2005.|$|E
5|$|On February2, a non-frontal low {{formed in}} the western Caribbean Sea {{two months after the}} end of the {{hurricane}} season. It moved quickly north-northwestward and acquired gale-force winds as it <b>brushed</b> <b>the</b> northern coast of Cuba. Early on February3, the storm struck Cape Sable, Florida and quickly crossed the state. The Miami National Weather Service office recorded a wind gust of 68mph (110km/h) during its passage. The winds damaged windows and power lines, catching residents and tourists off-guard. The cyclone also dropped 2–4inches (50–100mm) of precipitation along its path, causing crop damage in Miami-Dade County.|$|E
5|$|On May12, the Japan Meteorological Agency issued {{warnings}} for the Tokyo area as Rammasun was forecast {{to make landfall}} {{near the}} city. As Rammasun became extratropical, the storm <b>brushed</b> <b>the</b> Japanese coastline on May13, producing winds gusting up to 85km/h (50mph) and high waves for several hours. An estimated 10hectares (24.7acres) of farmland were damaged. Damage from the storm amounted to ¥770million ($8.4million 2008 USD) in agricultural losses.|$|E
