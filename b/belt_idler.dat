The work utilizes models to predict the motion resistance of belt conveyors that {{take into consideration the}} influence of key conveyor variables, such as idler roll diameter, spacing, troughing configuration and belt width. Given a specified conveyor configuration, the capital and ongoing costs of the system can then be approximated based on the required <b>belt,</b> <b>idler</b> rolls, structure, drives, etc. The research provides a computational means to rapidly analyze a large number of potential conveyor configurations and to compare each on an annual equivalent cost basis...|$|E
40|$|High {{incidence}} of injuries {{caused by the}} manual handling of heavy idler rollers {{is a major concern}} for the Australian mining industry. Consequently, major mining industry stakeholders called for the development of light weight idler rollers. As a result this project was designed to develop a light weight idler roller using pultruded continuous glass fibre, vinyl ester composite circular hollow section. Current literature on the subject highlighted the need for non-ferrous light weight idler rollers but offers no real solution. A rigorous test regime, including physical static and dynamic testing in conjunction with finite element analysis, was used to analyse a designed light weight composite prototype idler roller. The main empirical finding of the project was the possibility of producing shaftless lightweight composite idler rollers for use in the mining industry. The conceptual shaftless composite rollers are estimated to be 40 - 60 % lighter than traditional steel rollers. The light weight of the concept idler roller, combined with the possibility of manufacturing idler rollers that are dimensionally suitable for mining, addressed the concerns of the Australian mining industry and answered the call to develop a light weight conveyor <b>belt</b> <b>idler</b> roller. ...|$|E
40|$|Purpose. A {{drive is}} one of the basic {{elements}} of belt conveyers. To determine the drive power it is necessary to conduct calculations by standard methodologies expounded in modern technical literature. Such calculations demand a fair amount of time. The basic design parameters of a belt conveyer include type of load, design efficiency, geometrical dimensions and path configuration, operation conditions. The article aims to build the parametric dependence of belt conveyer drive power on its design parameters, that takes into account standard dimensions and parameters of <b>belts,</b> <b>idlers</b> and pulleys. Methodology. The work examines a belt conveyer with two areas: sloping and horizontal. Using the methodology for pulling calculation by means of belt conveyer encirclement, there are built parametric dependences of pull forces in the characteristic conveyer path points on the type of load, design efficiency, geometrical dimensions and path configuration, operation conditions. Findings. For the belt conveyers of the considered type there are built parametric dependences of drive power on type of load, design efficiency, geometrical dimensions and path configuration, operation conditions, taking into account the belt standard dimensions and corresponding assumptions in relation to idler and pulley types. Originality. This is the first developed parametric dependence of two-area (sloping and horizontal) belt conveyer drive power on type of load, design efficiency, geometrical dimensions and path configuration, operation conditions that takes into account standard dimensions and parameters of <b>belts,</b> <b>idlers</b> and pulleys. Practical value. Use of the built drive power dependences on design parameters for the belt conveyers with sloping and horizontal areas gives an opportunity of relatively rapid determination of drive power approximate value at the design stage. Also it allows quality selection of its basic elements at specific design characteristics and requirements. The offered dependences can be used for determination of general character of drive power dependence on the project efficiency. ...|$|R

40|$|The bulk {{material}} on a belt conveyor deforms itself {{due to the}} run through idler stations. The deformation results in energy losses which are summarised in the bulk solid flexure resistance. The right understanding {{of the interaction between}} {{bulk material}} and idler stations is important for the prediction of this resistance and the idler loads. For the calculation of the bulk material behaviour on the belt the classical analytical approach by Krause and Hettler was extended by Wheeler with a Finite Difference model to consider the belt deflection. DEM simulation and experimental measurements of the belt deflection were used by Ilic to predict the bulk material behaviour. This paper will use coupled FEM-DEM simulations for a pure numerical analysis of the interaction between bulk material, <b>belt</b> and <b>idler.</b> In this approach a simplified FEM model for a fabric belt is combined with a calibrated DEM model for cohesionless grit The model and the results of the coupled simulation will be presented. The paper will highlight the influence of belt velocity, <b>belt</b> pre-tension and <b>idler</b> distance on the behaviour of the bulk material as well as how this approach can be used to determine the bulk solid flexure resistance.

As {{a consequence of the}} Winkler foundation model, a normalized indentation resistance is independent of the primary belt system parameters â€“ carrying weight per unit width, idler diameter and backing thickness- as is the case for a three-parameter viscoelastic model.

40|$|The {{indentation}} {{rolling resistance}} of conveyor belts {{is an important}} design consideration for long belt conveyors and can also be important for heavily loaded belt conveyors. Indentation rolling resistance {{is dependent on the}} properties of the conveyor belt, including the carcass and bottom cover as well as properties of the belt conveyor including induced loads, belt speed, ambient temperature and idler roll diameter. A purpose built laboratory test facility is described to measure the indentation rolling resistance of conveyor belts. The test facility is designed to accept both fabric and steel cord belts and test over a range of typical operating parameters and conditions. Results are presented for a range of test parameters, including; load, <b>belt</b> speed, <b>idler</b> roll diameter, ambient temperature and bottom cover compound.

50|$|The {{first use}} of the twist grip {{throttle}} control was on the Roper steam velocipede of 1867-69. Rather than a sleeve that rotated around the handlebar, Sylvester H. Roper's steam motorcycle's entire handlebar rotated, with a dual mode operation. When rotated forward it opened the throttle, and when rotated backwards it applied the spoon brake. Motorcycle Consumer News design columnist Glynn Kerr said that pioneering this technology was a point {{in favor of the}} Roper's precedence as the first motorcycle, in response to Cycle World Technical Editor Kevin Cameron's position that the 1885 Daimler Reitwagen was more deserving because it used the more successful technology, internal combustion rather than steam. The design drawings of the Reitwagen depicted a twist grip speed control, also applying the brake when turned one way, but when turned the other way, it would have tensioned the <b>belt</b> drive's <b>idler</b> pulley, applying power to the rear wheel {{in the manner of a}} clutch. The actual working model, however, did not have the twist grip, belt drive, or brakes.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} a mathematical {{study of the}} development and propagation of tension shock waves in the topside of long belt conveyor systems. Employing conservation laws for mass and momentum we construct a system of nonlinear hyperbolic equations governing the behavior of tension and momentum per unit length. An important feature of this construction is the nonlinear relationship between tension and overdensity due to the geometric sag of the <b>belt</b> between the <b>idlers.</b> Numerical profiles of the tension are computed using the moving finite element method which is especially suited for the numerical study of shocks.

40|$|AbstractDuring {{the design}} of {{conveyor}} belts, optimization attempts are taken firstly to reduce the energy consumption, this is obtained by reducing the main resistances of the conveyor. The biggest savings of energy may be expected in rational <b>belts</b> and <b>idlers</b> selection, {{and in some cases}} in unconventional solutions of the route, stretching and spillover equipment. The tests on movement resistance of the belt conveyor, carried out over recent years in the Machinery Systems Department of the WrocÅ‚aw University of Technology, allowed to define precisely the impact of many construction and operational factors on the energy consumption of transport. At present, research work is carried out, oriented to find the optimal solutions for the belt conveyors used in underground mines. Due to different capacity values, construction that is more compact, more difficult installation and operation conditions, the solutions developed for open-pit mining cannot be directly adopted. The paper proposes a stand test methodology on the identification of key constituents of belt conveyor movement resistance and presents the results of pilot experimental tests. These tests aimed to define the optimal construction features of energy saving on the conveyor belt, having low resistance of rolling on idlers and bending resistance on pulleys under underground mine conditions...|$|R
40|$|Belt {{conveying}} systems {{operating with}} steel cord conveyor belts are used {{extensively in the}} mining and minerals processing industries to transport bulk material. An accurate analysis of the belt tension distribution {{along the length of}} the system is essential to ensure reliable and efficient operation. An important consideration in the tension analysis is the evaluation of the motion resistances of the system. The motion resistances that occur {{along the length of the}} conveyor are known as the main resistances and, for a horizontal conveyor include the belt and bulk solid flexure resistance, the rotational resistance of the idler rolls and the indentation rolling resistance of the conveyor belt. Generally, the indentation rolling resistance component is the major contributor to the motion resistance of long horizontal belt conveyors. This paper will discuss the development of a pseudo 3 -dimensional viscoelastic finite element analysis to calculate the indentation rolling resistance of steel cord conveyor belts. A unique aspect of this model is the ability to incorporate into the viscoelastic rolling contact problem the influence of the steel cords and the variable rubber properties throughout the thickness of the belt. These parameters play a significant role in determining the contact pressure distribution at the <b>belt</b> and <b>idler</b> roll interface and the apparent bottom cover thickness, and therefore the indentation rolling resistance...|$|R

40|$|Muck {{conveyors}} are {{a potential}} source of airborne dust. Muck from the excavated face, which is usually fairly wet when placed on the conveyor, dries out as it travels on the conveyor through the airstream. Water sprays placed at intervals along the conveyor will minimize dust from the conveyor contaminating the airstream. Conveyor transfer and drop points should be enclosed and provided with water sprays.

Concrete lined openings facilitate cleaning. Residual dust and dirt {{should not be allowed}} to accumulate in the airways and haulage ways as these represent potential dust sources. b) Mine cars Keeping the muck in the mine cars wet reduces the potential for creating dust. Overloading cars must be avoided as it can lead to spillage which then becomes another potential dust source. Washing mine cars regularly will keep them free of dirt and dust, and parking a loaded mine car for a long periods should be avoided as this allows the muck to dry out. If feasible, major route of mine cars should not be along primary intake airways. c) Dumping Stations Subsurface muck car dumping stations represent major potential dust sources. Enclosure and bypass airways can be installed to avoid high velocity air/dust contact. Water spray at dump activated during dumping will wet the muck and suppress dust. Local dust scrubbers located at the dumps will clean dusty air that escapes from the dump station enclosures. Choice of location and equipment for dump stations must prioritize dust control. 7. 5. 12 Leakage and Recirculation of Contaminated Air from Exhaust Ducts Leakage from exhaust ducts containing contaminated air and subsequent recirculation of the leakage contributes to dust problems.

40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) The {{incorporation}} of conveyor systems throughout industry has seen {{an increase in}} demand for systems that exceed the specification of conventional conveyors. This coupled with the demand to convey bulk materials over larger distances, at higher speeds and efficiencies, requires {{the development of a}} versatile design approach. This thesis explores the design aspects associated with modern pouch conveying systems, and how they vary, and can be adapted from theories used with conventional troughed conveyors. In particular, the indentation rolling resistance (IRR) is explored in detail, as this can account for up to 60 % of the drag forces of a system. This is the drag force that arises due to an asymmetric pressure distribution as the idler roll shell indents the bottom cover of the <b>belt.</b> The potential <b>idler</b> roll arrangements for a generic pouch conveying system are analysed, and compared with experimental values. In addition to this, the drive traction attainable from suitable drive stations is analysed. Troughed conveyors typically wrap the conveyor belt around a large drive pulley, generating large amounts of traction. Given the layout of pouch conveying systems, a different approach is required, at multiple locations. As such, pouch conveyors are typically driven through simply supported drive stations, with small areas of contact with the belt. The useable traction from these point contact drives is considered. These theories are then united and applied to a dynamic package capable of handling multiple conveyor designs. This package utilises Finite Element Modelling (FEM) to model the viscoelastic nature of the system, based on the distributed drag forces, and inputs of the conveyor. Lastly, to qualify this theory, experimental analysis is conducted on an on-site installation, and compared with the theoretical results...|$|R
