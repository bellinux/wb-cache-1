Fujimoto also said that Jong-un was favored by his father over his elder brother, Kim Jong-chul, reasoning that Jong-chul is too feminine in character, while Jong-un is [...] "exactly like his father". Furthermore, Fujimoto stated that [...] "If power is to be handed over then Jong-un is the best for it. He has superb physical gifts, is a big drinker and never admits defeat." [...] Also, according to Fujimoto, Jong-un smokes Yves Saint Laurent cigarettes, loves Johnnie Walker whisky and has a Mercedes-Benz 600 luxury sedan. When Jong-un was 18, Fujimoto described an episode where Jong-un once questioned his lavish lifestyle and asked, [...] "We are here, playing basketball, riding horses, riding jet skis, having fun together. <b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lives of the average people?" [...] On 15 January 2009 the South Korean news agency Yonhap reported that Kim Jong-il had appointed Kim Jong-un to be his successor.|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes, lad, I {{remember}} it well," [...] answered the old frontiersman. [...] "But the trail ain't half {{as bad as}} it was then--Braddock's pioneers smoothed down the rough places putty well,--not <b>but</b> <b>what</b> some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> brushwood has grown up ag'in." ...|$|R
