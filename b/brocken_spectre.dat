Robert and George Colwan, two feuding brothers, are caught in a fog atop Arthur's Seat and witness what could be interpreted as a <b>Brocken</b> <b>spectre,</b> a strange phenomenon of the light, which causes George to believe that he is seeing a ghost. In the confusion, Robert nearly kills George, but they both escape {{to the bottom of the}} hill as the fog begins to clear.|$|E

Then he scrupulously demanded whether this--this (he failed to find a name for it) would be an impoverishment of our family, and I showed how Clarence had provided that we should be in as easy circumstances as before. In the midst came in Clarence himself, having hastened to dress, on hearing that Mr. Fordyce was in the house, and looking none the better for the exertion.|$|E

What, probably, will he spy?--what will he select to look at? Of course, he will see a <b>Brocken</b> <b>spectre</b> of himself. He will see several meeting-houses, at least, and, perhaps, that {{somebody}} ought to be assessed higher than he is, since he has so handsome a wood-lot. Now take Julius Caesar, or Immanuel Swedenborg, or a Fegee-Islander, and set him up there. Or suppose all together, and let them compare notes afterward.

6000|$|On the whole, perhaps, we {{need not}} respect Keats the less for having been gifted with sensibility, and may even say what {{we believe to be}} true, that his health was injured by the failure of his book.

It is perfectly true that what we call the world, in these affairs, {{is nothing more than a}} mere <b>Brocken</b> <b>spectre,</b> the projected shadow of ourselves; but as long as we do not know it, it is a very passable giant. We are not without experience of natures so purely intellectual that their bodies had no more concern in their mental doings and sufferings than a house has with the good or ill fortune of its occupant. But poets are not built on this plan, and especially poets like Keats, in whom the moral seems to have so perfectly interfused the physical man, that you might almost say he could feel sorrow with his hands, so truly did his body, like that of Donne's Mistress Boulstred, think and remember and forebode. The healthiest poet of whom our civilization has been capable says that when he beholds ...|$|E

5000|$|Walpurgisnacht Night (in German folklore) {{the night}} of 30 April (May Day's eve), when witches meet on the Brocken {{mountain}} and hold revels with the Devil...Brocken is the highest of the Harz Mountains of north central Germany. It is noted for {{the phenomenon of the}} <b>Brocken</b> <b>spectre</b> and for witches' revels which reputedly took place there on Walpurgis night.The <b>Brocken</b> <b>Spectre</b> is a magnified shadow of an observer, typically surrounded by rainbow-like bands, thrown onto a bank of cloud in high mountain areas when the sun is low. The phenomenon was first reported on the Brocken.|$|E
50|$|The Brocken {{has always}} {{played a role}} in legends and has been {{connected}} with witches and devils; Johann Wolfgang von Goethe took up the legends in his play Faust. The <b>Brocken</b> <b>spectre</b> is a common phenomenon on this misty mountain, where a climber's shadow cast upon fog creates eerie optical effects.|$|E
50|$|When {{viewed from}} a {{mountain}} or tall building, glories are {{often seen in}} association with a <b>Brocken</b> <b>spectre,</b> also called Mountain Spectre, the apparently enormously magnified shadow of an observer, cast (when the Sun is low) on clouds below the mountain on which the viewer is standing. The name derives from the Brocken, the tallest peak of the Harz mountain range in Germany. Because the peak is above the cloud level and the area frequently misty, conditions conducive to casting a shadow on a cloud layer are common. Giant shadows that seemed to move by themselves due to movement of the cloud layer (this movement is {{another part of the}} definition of the <b>Brocken</b> <b>Spectre),</b> and that were surrounded by glories, {{may have contributed to the}} reputation the Harz mountains hold as a refuge for witches and evil spirits. In Goethe's Faust, the Brocken is called the Blocksberg and is the site of the Witches' Sabbath on Walpurgis Night.|$|E
50|$|A <b>Brocken</b> <b>spectre</b> (German Brockengespenst), {{also called}} Brocken bow or {{mountain}} spectre, is the apparently enormous and magnified shadow of an observer, cast upon {{the surfaces of}} clouds opposite the sun. The head of the figure is often surrounded by the glowing halo-like rings of a glory—rings of coloured light that appear directly opposite the sun when sunlight meets a cloud of uniformly-sized water droplets.|$|E
50|$|The {{phenomenon}} {{can appear}} on any misty mountainside or cloud bank, even when seen from an aeroplane, but the frequent fogs and low-altitude accessibility of the Brocken, a {{peak in the}} Harz Mountains in Germany, have created a local legend from which the phenomenon draws its name. The <b>Brocken</b> <b>spectre</b> was observed and described by Johann Silberschlag in 1780, and has since been recorded often in literature about the region.|$|E
