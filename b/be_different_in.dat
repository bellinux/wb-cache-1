5|$|In evolution, luciferins {{generally}} vary little: one in particular, coelenterazine, is {{the light}} emitting pigment for nine ancient phyla (groups of very different organisms), including polycystine radiolaria, Cercozoa (Phaeodaria), protozoa, comb jellies, cnidaria including jellyfish and corals, crustaceans, molluscs, arrow worms and vertebrates (ray-finned fish). Not all these organisms synthesize coelenterazine: {{some of them}} obtain it through their diet. Conversely, luciferase enzymes vary widely and tend to <b>be</b> <b>different</b> <b>in</b> each species. Overall, bioluminescence has arisen over forty times in evolutionary history.|$|E

5|$|The Diversity {{indices of}} the plant species were recorded; they were a {{richness}} of 48, diversity of 0.29 and evenness of 0.47 in summer. In winter, the respective figures were 81, 0.17 and 0.52. Species richness was found to <b>be</b> <b>different</b> <b>in</b> 48 samples of thin phumdis, 53 samples of thick phumdis and 14 samples on hard ground. The eight plant communities identified during winter and summer were Capillipedium, Leersia hexandra, Oenanthe javanica, Phragmites karka, Kyllinga triceps, Pteridium aquilinum, Zizania latifolia and Persicaria perfoliata. Zizania latifolia recorded the highest productivity with (13.90±5.01)g/m2 for winter and (102.96±26.03)g/m2 for summer. Greater productivity was recorded in summer (65.96g/m2) than winter (15.76g/m2). Variation of productivity of annuals and perennials were noted according to seasons and type of phumdis.|$|E
5|$|The cytosol is {{the site}} of most {{metabolism}} in prokaryotes, and {{a large proportion of the}} metabolism of eukaryotes. For instance, in mammals about half of the proteins in the cell are localized to the cytosol. The most complete data are available in yeast, where metabolic reconstructions indicate that the majority of both metabolic processes and metabolites occur in the cytosol. Major metabolic pathways that occur in the cytosol in animals are protein biosynthesis, the pentose phosphate pathway, glycolysis and gluconeogenesis.

25|$|Auditory {{processing}} deficits {{have also}} been proposed {{as a cause of}} stuttering. Stuttering is less prevalent in deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals, and stuttering may be reduced when auditory feedback is altered, such as by masking, delayed auditory feedback (DAF), or frequency altered feedback.

25|$|The basaltic {{rocks in}} the oceanic and {{continental}} sectors of the Cameroon line are similar in composition, although the more evolved rocks are quite distinct. The similarity in basaltic rocks may indicate {{they have the same}} source. Since the lithosphere mantle below Africa must <b>be</b> <b>different</b> <b>in</b> chemical and isotopic composition from the younger lithosphere below the Atlantic, one explanation is that the source is in the asthenosphere rather than in metasomatized lithosphere.|$|E
25|$|However, Poincaré's {{resolution}} led to {{a paradox}} when changing frames: if a Hertzian oscillator radiates in a certain direction, it will suffer a recoil from the inertia of the fictitious fluid. Poincaré performed a Lorentz boost (to order v/c) to {{the frame of the}} moving source. He noted that energy conservation holds in both frames, but that the law of conservation of momentum is violated. This would allow perpetual motion, a notion which he abhorred. The laws of nature would have to <b>be</b> <b>different</b> <b>in</b> the frames of reference, and the relativity principle would not hold. Therefore, he argued that also in this case there has to be another compensating mechanism in the ether.|$|E
25|$|The {{difference}} is essentially whether correlations between base and supervenient properties hold within actual worlds only, or across possible worlds. For example, if psychological properties strongly locally supervene on physical properties, then any two people physically the same, in any two worlds, {{will also be}} psychologically the same. On the other hand, if psychological properties only weakly locally supervene on physical properties, then those correlations between base and supervenient properties that hold in virtue of the supervenience relation are maintained within each world, but can <b>be</b> <b>different</b> <b>in</b> different worlds. For example, my physical duplicates in the actual world {{will have the same}} thoughts as I have; but my physical duplicates in other possible worlds may have different thoughts than I have in the actual world.|$|E

25|$|Crystals {{can have}} certain special electrical, optical, and {{mechanical}} properties that glass and polycrystals normally cannot. These properties {{are related to}} the anisotropy of the crystal, i.e. the lack of rotational symmetry in its atomic arrangement. One such property is the piezoelectric effect, where a voltage across the crystal can shrink or stretch it. Another is birefringence, where a double image appears when looking through a crystal. Moreover, various properties of a crystal, including electrical conductivity, electrical permittivity, and Young's modulus, may <b>be</b> <b>different</b> <b>in</b> different directions in a crystal. For example, graphite crystals consist of a stack of sheets, and although each individual sheet is mechanically very strong, the sheets are rather loosely bound to each other. Therefore, the mechanical strength of the material is quite different depending on the direction of stress.|$|E
25|$|The {{sound from}} a Category I whistle is {{primarily}} a byproduct of source motion. In every case, there is a back reaction of the medium on the source (resistive and reactive impedance). One example of a weak back reaction is a vibrating iron body in air. The densities are so different the back reaction is often ignored. Back reactions of air on an air source or water on a water source can <b>be</b> <b>different.</b> <b>In</b> many cases, say turbulent jets, the sound created is random and it is convenient to consider the sound to be merely a byproduct of the flow. In this category the back reaction is insufficient to strongly control source motion, so whistles are not in this category.|$|E
25|$|Modern {{monetary}} theory distinguishes {{among different}} ways to measure the money supply, reflected in different types of monetary aggregates, using a categorization system {{that focuses on the}} liquidity of the financial instrument used as money. The most commonly used monetary aggregates (or types of money) are conventionally designated M1, M2 and M3. These are successively larger aggregate categories: M1 is currency (coins and bills) plus demand deposits (such as checking accounts); M2 is M1 plus savings accounts and time deposits under $100,000; and M3 is M2 plus larger time deposits and similar institutional accounts. M1 includes only the most liquid financial instruments, and M3 relatively illiquid instruments. The precise definition of M1, M2 etc. may <b>be</b> <b>different</b> <b>in</b> different countries.|$|E

25|$|Ukraine {{produces}} {{the fourth largest}} number of post-secondary graduates in Europe, while being ranked seventh in population. Higher education is either state funded or private. Students that study at state expense receive a standard scholarship if their average marks at the end-of-term exams and differentiated test suffice; this rule may <b>be</b> <b>different</b> <b>in</b> some universities. For highest grades, the scholarship is increased by 25%. For most students the government subsidy {{is not sufficient to}} cover their basic living expenses. Most universities provide subsidised housing for out-of-city students. Also, it is common for libraries to supply required books for all registered students. Ukrainian universities confer two degrees: the bachelor's degree (4years) and the master's degree (5–6thyear), in accordance with the Bologna process. Historically, Specialist degree (usually 5 years) is still also granted; it was the only degree awarded by universities in the Soviet times.|$|E
25|$|However, {{since only}} matter and {{electromagnetic}} energy are directly observable by experiment (not the non-em-fluid), Poincaré's resolution still violates the reaction principle and the COM-theorem, when an emission/absorption process is practically considered. This {{leads to a}} paradox when changing frames: if waves are radiated in a certain direction, the device will suffer a recoil from {{the momentum of the}} fictitious fluid. Then, Poincaré performed a Lorentz boost (to first order in v/c) to the frame of the moving source. He noted that energy conservation holds in both frames, but that the law of conservation of momentum is violated. This would allow perpetual motion, a notion which he abhorred. The laws of nature would have to <b>be</b> <b>different</b> <b>in</b> the frames of reference, and the relativity principle would not hold. Therefore, he argued that also in this case there has to be another compensating mechanism in the ether.|$|E
25|$|Fictitious {{forces can}} be {{considered}} to do work, provided that they move an object on a trajectory that changes its energy from potential to kinetic. For example, consider {{a person in a}} rotating chair holding a weight in their outstretched hand. If they pull their hand inward toward their body, {{from the perspective of the}} rotating reference frame, they have done work against the centrifugal force. When the weight is let go, it spontaneously flies outward relative to the rotating reference frame, because the centrifugal force does work on the object, converting its potential energy into kinetic. From an inertial viewpoint, of course, the object flies away from them because it is suddenly allowed to move in a straight line. This illustrates that the work done, like the total potential and kinetic energy of an object, can <b>be</b> <b>different</b> <b>in</b> a non-inertial frame than an inertial one.|$|E
