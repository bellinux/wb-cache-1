40|$|In {{this paper}} we study the {{implications}} for conference program committees of using single-blind reviewing, in which committee members {{are aware of the}} names and affiliations of paper authors, versus double-blind reviewing, in which this information is not visible to committee members. WSDM 2017, the 10 th ACM International ACM Conference on Web Search and Data Mining, performed a controlled experiment in which each paper was reviewed by four committee members. Two of these four reviewers were chosen from a pool of committee members who had access to author information; the other two were chosen from a disjoint pool who did not have access to this information. This information asymmetry persisted through the process of <b>bidding</b> for <b>papers,</b> reviewing papers, and entering scores. Reviewers in the single-blind condition typically bid for 22 % fewer <b>papers,</b> and preferentially <b>bid</b> for <b>papers</b> from top institutions. Once papers were allocated to reviewers, single-blind reviewers were significantly more likely than their double-blind counterparts to recommend for acceptance papers from famous authors and top institutions. The estimated odds multipliers are 1. 63 for famous authors and 1. 58 and 2. 10 for top universities and companies respectively, so the result is tangible. For female authors, the associated odds multiplier of 0. 78 is not statistically significant in our study. However, a meta-analysis places this value in line with that of other experiments, and {{in the context of this}} larger aggregate the gender effect is also statistically significant...|$|R

The contracts between the distant millers and their commission agents help to explain the specific form that collusion takes. Simulations indicate that (i) the cartel gains considerably by colluding, over the competitive outcome; (ii) however, sellers (farmers) do not lose significantly under collusion when the commission agents <b>bid.</b> The <b>paper</b> also shows that efficient collusion, the form of collusion commonly assumed in the literature, does not explain the data well. ...|$|R

The result has a striking impact on the analysis of optimal reservation price and empirical identification of the bidder's cost distribution in procurement auctions. ...|$|R
