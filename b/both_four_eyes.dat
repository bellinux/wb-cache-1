We explored the effect of topical Nepafenac, an anti-inflammatory drug known to reach the retina when administered via eyedrops, {{on the development of}} early stages of diabetic retinopathy and on metabolic and phys-iologic abnormalities that contribute to the retinal disease. Streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats were assigned to three groups (0. 3 % Nepafenac eyedrops, vehicle eyedrops, and untreated control) for comparison to age-matched nondiabetic control animals. Eyedrops were administered in <b>both</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>four</b> times per day for 2 and 9 months.

A side effect associated with long-term treatment of various diseases with steroids is a high incidence of posterior subcapsular cataracts. The literature did not indicate any reports discuss if the treatment with 0. 1 % dexamethasone has any effect(s) on the lens capsule or not. To answer this the lens capsule lipids was studied using different techniques. NewZealand albino rabbits were used in this study, where three groups were involved; control, 3 DEXA and 5 DEXA groups. Dexamethasone was instilled in <b>both</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>four</b> times a day for three weeks (3 DEXA) and for five weeks (5 DEXA). The measured parameters: total lipids, cholesterol, phospholipids and total protein as well as lipid spectroscopy (UV and FTIR) revealed significant changes in the capsular thickness as well as the physical characteristics of the capsular lipid bilayer...|$|R

40|$|AIMS—To {{evaluate}} whether amniotic membrane transplantation {{can be an}} effective alternative treatment for neurotrophic corneal ulcers.  METHODS—Amniotic membrane transplantation was performed in 16  eyes of 15  patients with neurotrophic corneal ulcers and vision equal to or worse than 20 / 200. The neurotrophic state was developed following keratoplasty (<b>four</b> <b>eyes),</b> herpes zoster ophthalmicus (<b>four</b> <b>eyes),</b> diabetes mellitus (<b>four</b> <b>eyes),</b> radiation (two eyes), removal of acoustic neuroma with neuroparalysis (one eye), and herpes simplex keratitis (one eye).  RESULTS—During a mean follow up period of 18. 8  (SD 13. 0) months, one to three layers of amniotic membrane with or without additional membrane as a patch were used for 17  procedures in 16  eyes for persistent neurotrophic corneal ulcers. All but four (76. 4 %) instances of amniotic membrane transplantation achieved rapid epithelialisation in 16. 6  (9. 0) days. Of the <b>four</b> <b>eyes</b> showing delayed healing, three eyes healed by tarsorrhaphy, and the remaining one eye with corneal perforation required penetrating keratoplasty and tarsorrhaphy. Two eyes gained vision better than 20 / 200. The healed corneal surface was accompanied by reduced inflammation.  CONCLUSION—Amniotic membrane transplantation can be considered an effective alternative for treating severe neurotrophic corneal ulcers. ...|$|R

40|$|Photodynamic therapy (PDT) {{has been}} used in {{treating}} peripheral retinal capillary hemangioma (RCH) with satisfactory results. We report a rare case of von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease with three large peripheral RCHs, treated with PDT and intravitreal bevacizumab injection (IVB), who developed persistent bullous exudative retinal detachment (RD) despite significant tumor regression. The patient is a sporadic case of VHL disease, with a de novo nonsense mutation in codon 161 with C → T transition at nucleotide position 694 of the VHL gene. Multiple RCHs were noted in <b>both</b> <b>eyes.</b> <b>Four</b> small RCHs were found in the left eye and were treated with laser photocoagulation. Three large RCHs in the peripheral retina of the right eye were complicated with cystoid macular edema and subretinal fluid accumulation. The RCHs were treated with PDT combined with IVB, and bullous exudative RD developed on the second day after treatment. Three months after PDT, the tumors had regressed significantly, but exudative RD persisted, despite multiple IVB and intravitreal triamcinolone acetonide injection (IVTA). External drainage with sclera buckling, IVB, and IVTA were performed, and the retina attached after surgical intervention. The application of PDT in the treatment of RCHs and its possible complications are discussed...|$|R
