25|$|According to quantum {{mechanics}} (particularly quantum indeterminacy), no possible measurement distinguishes between the 4 different polarization states, {{as they are}} not all orthogonal. The only possible measurement is between any two orthogonal states (an orthonormal basis). So, for example, measuring in the rectilinear basis gives a result of horizontal or vertical. If the photon was created as horizontal or vertical (as a rectilinear eigenstate) then this measures the correct state, <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> created as 45° or 135° (diagonal eigenstates) then the rectilinear measurement instead returns either horizontal or vertical at random. Furthermore, after this measurement the photon is polarized in the state it was measured in (horizontal or vertical), with all information about its initial polarization lost.|$|E

25|$|The Mishnah {{taught that}} the minimum measure of challah is one twenty-fourth {{part of the}} dough (or in the case if the minimum amount subject to challah, about 2¼ ounces). If one makes dough for oneself or for a wedding banquet, the minimum is still one twenty-fourth (and no {{distinction}} is made based on volume of dough intended for private consumption). If one makes dough to sell in the market, the minimum is one forty-eighth. If dough is rendered unclean either unwittingly or by force of unavoidable circumstances, it is one forty-eighth, <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> rendered unclean deliberately, it is one twenty-fourth, so that one who sins shall not profit from sin. The Mishnah taught that one cannot designate all of one's dough as challah, but must leave some that is not challah.|$|E
25|$|Captain John G. Foster, a Union Army {{engineering}} officer observing from Fort Sumter, wrote {{reports to}} his superiors {{about the progress}} of the battery construction. Foster's assessment of the battery was dismissive, “...I think it can be destroyed by our fire before it has time to do much damage...” and he followed a few days later with, “...I do not think this floating battery will prove very formidable...” Nonetheless, his superior, Major Robert Anderson was apprehensive enough that he inquired for specific instructions from Washington regarding the threat of the battery. He was instructed that if he became convinced that the battery was advanced for the purpose of immediate attack then he would be justified in firing on it <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> only being moved for the purposes of general emplacement that he should exercise forbearance.|$|E
500|$|Fady {{have served}} to protect certain {{wildlife}} in the Sihanaka homeland. [...] The aye-aye {{is the subject}} of numerous fady and folk tales among the Sihanaka. It was traditionally believed that a person who fell asleep in the forest might be brought a pillow by an aye-aye. If the pillow was for one's head, he or she would become rich, <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> for the feet, that person would be subject to evil sorcery. Similarly, the indri is considered sacred and may not be hunted, killed or eaten.|$|E

500|$|Advertisements would {{state the}} films artistry {{or that it}} was one of the best three-reel films released. Lombardi cites a single review from The Moving Picture World in his text and {{suggests}} that other reviews may have been more tepid, but the result was that Dwan would not produce any more films of [...] "such experimental nature" [...] at Universal. The film is now considered to be lost.

500|$|Another theory {{connected}} the video to popular electronic musician Skrillex. In May, when the video had first been posted to the Internet, he released {{a song called}} [...] "Red Lips". Shortly after Krahbichler's original post, he tweeted [...] "#REDLIPS #REDLIPS #REDLIPS". It was speculated {{that it could be}} viral marketing for his work—other musicians in that genre have been known to hide images in spectrograms—or from some CDs of unreleased work that he said had been stolen from his hotel room. <b>But</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> the former possibility, Krahblicher noted, [...] "the problem is that the hints towards the works being promoted are fairly weak".|$|E
500|$|The film is {{important}} as the first known character role by Lon Chaney. [...] Martin F. Norden, author of The Cinema of Isolation: A History of Physical Disability in the Movies, describes the plot as following the prevailing industry standards of disabled characters, where the figure [...] "nobly" [...] withdraws from the relationship after plotting revenge and then saving his beloved. Norden cites a quote from Chaney, saying this film made Chaney realize that [...] "the screen was {{more interesting than the}} stage". The film is now considered lost. It is unknown when the film was lost, <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> in Universal's vaults it would have been deliberately destroyed along with the remaining copies of Universal's silent era films in 1948.|$|E

500|$|The overall {{body of the}} ant {{is poorly}} {{preserved}} {{and much of it}} is indistinct. Macabeemyrma ovata is about [...] long with a distinct elongated oval head capsule that is about 1.5x longer than wide. The holotype is missing the wings and some portions of the legs while the eyes are very faintly preserved. It could not be confirmed whether its eyes were compound or not, <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> to be confirmed they would share similar eye characteristics to Myrmecia. The exact shape of the mandibles cannot be properly determined, but they are elongated and not subtriangular which is normal for other members of Myrmeciinae except the genus Myrmecia. Its elongated head and mandibles distinguish this species from those in the genus Ypresiomyrma, which are otherwise thought to have a close phylogenetic relationship due to similarities. [...] The waist consists of a single segment, and whether or not the ant has a sting cannot be fully determined due to the condition of the specimen collected.|$|E
500|$|In 2005, former [...] "good-girl" [...] Cassie {{becomes a}} rebellious teenager; Nick and Sharon have a {{difficult}} time dealing with her. Cassie has a crush on bad-boy Daniel Romalotti (Michael Graziadei), who is dating Lily Winters (Christel Khalil). One night, against her parents' wishes she sneaks out to a party. In a ploy to impress a drunken Daniel she attempts to drive him home, despite being underage. The car crashes, leaving them with no memory of the accident. Daniel is thought to have been driving, and is blamed for the accident. A weakened Cassie escapes from the hospital to find Daniel and tell him she was driving; she is returned to the hospital. During the episode dated May 24, Cassie dies with Nick and Sharon at her side. Grimes said she did not think Cassie would die, <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> [...] "meant to happen, it's meant to happen". The actress found filming her last scenes with Case and Morrow [...] "ridiculously hard". Daniel is cleared of all charges and Nick and Sharon begin Cassie's Foundation, a movement to prevent teenage drinking and driving. Following her death, the strong relationship between Nick and Sharon changes forever. Weighing in on the [...] "groundbreaking" [...] and [...] "shocking" [...] plot, Morrow stated, [...] "As a person who watched Camryn grow up, I was devastated and it was not that difficult to use those feelings in the scenes we had to play. But as an actor, I have to commend our producer and writers at that time because it gave the show a huge new storyline that years later we are still playing out". He felt that losing a child gave Nick [...] "an edge and a change" [...] that affected him deeply. In 2012, during a court battle over Newman Enterprises (the family company), Nick tells a judge that Sharon's mental problems date to Cassie's death. Luke Kerr of Zap2it referred to this as playing the [...] "Cassie card".|$|E

[...] It’s almost not watchable. [...] If it comes on, I can’t get through it". Daniel is cleared of all charges and Nick and Sharon begin Cassie's Foundation, a movement to prevent teenage drinking and driving. According to Case, when Sharon loses something in her life it [...] "reminds her and reactivates Cassie’s death for her". After Nick cheats on Sharon following Cassie's death, Case said it [...] "makes you so fearful {{that you are going to}} be alone for the rest of your life; that no matter what you go out in life to create, it’s going to be ruined anyway". The actress also believed that Sharon lost her identity after Cassie's death. In 2012, during a court battle over Newman Enterprises (the family company), Nick stated that Sharon's mental problems date to Cassie's death.|$|E

2500|$|It {{is almost}} certain that cricket reached Essex by the 16th century and that it {{developed}} during the 17th century with inter-parish matches being played. The first definite mention of cricket {{in connection with the}} county is a highly controversial match in 1724 between Chingford and Mr Edwin Stead's XI, which is recorded in The Dawn of Cricket by H T Waghorn. [...] The venue is unknown <b>but,</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> at Chingford, it is also the earliest reference to cricket being played in Essex as well as by an Essex team. The game echoed an earlier one in 1718 as the Chingford team refused to play to a finish when Mr Stead's team had the advantage. A court case followed and, as in 1718, it was ordered to be played out presumably so that all wagers could be fulfilled. We know that Lord Chief Justice Pratt presided over the case and that he ordered them to play it out on Dartford Brent, though it is not known if this was the original venue. The game was completed in 1726.|$|E
