The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the risk and effect of balloon perforation by anchoring barbs and to assess whether these risks are different if the <b>balloon</b> is <b>protected</b> by a covered stent mounted upon it. MethodsA bench-top model was developed to mimic the penetration of anchoring barbs into the lumen of medium sized blood vessels. The model allowed variation of angle and depth of vessel penetration. Both bare balloons and those with covered stents mounted upon them were tested in the model to determine whether there was a risk of perforation and which factors increased or decreased this risk. ResultsAll combinations of barb angle and depth caused balloon perforation but this was most marked when the barb was placed perpendicular to the long axis of the balloon. When the deployment of covered stents was attempted balloon perforation occurred in some cases but full stent deployment was achieved in all cases where the perforation was in the portion of the balloon covered by the stent. The only situation in which stent deployment failed was where the barb was intentionally placed in the uncovered portion of the balloon. This resulted in only partial deployment of the stent. ConclusionsBalloon rupture is a distinct possibility when deploying balloon-expandable stents {{in close proximity to}} anchoring barbs. Care should be taken in this circumstance to ensure that the barb is well away from the uncovered portion of the balloon...|$|R
5000|$|The 320th Barrage Balloon Battalion was an African American United States Army {{unit that}} saw combat in Europe during World War II. This VLA (Very Low Altitude) barrage balloon {{battalion}} [...] "was raised up in 1942 {{just a year}} after the Coastal Artillery Corps took over responsibility for barrage balloons from the Army Air Corps." [...] Their first assignment was Utah and Omaha beaches on 6 June 1944 (the D-Day invasion). The mission of the 621-man assault force was to raise hydrogen-filled barrage <b>balloons</b> to <b>protect</b> assaulting infantry and armor from being strafed by enemy aircraft. [...] "They flew at an altitude of around 200 feet to defend soldiers landing on the beaches against strafing attacks by German aircraft." [...] A commendation by Supreme Allied Commander Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower cited the unit for conducting [...] "its mission with courage and determination, and proved an important element of the air defense team". The battalion served 140 days in France. In late July 1944, Battery A of the 320th moved from Omaha Beach to the port city of Cherbourg. The remaining three batteries stayed on Omaha and Utah Beaches until early October, when deteriorating weather prevented ships from landing. The battalion’s service in France came to and end on October 24, when the men boarded ships bound for England.< [...] "By the end of October 1944, the 320th VLA Battalion was on its way back to Camp Stewart, Ga., to train for service in the Pacific Theater.

Eight test runs and one baseline run inside a contained volume filled with thick smoke were performed to investigate whether smoke particles entered the Isolator System. Filters were used to identify smoke entering the Isolator System. Results - Seven filters showed no trace of smoke particles. In one test run, a part of the IS loosened and a small brown spot was visible. The filter from the baseline run was completely covered with a thick layer of particles, proving the effectiveness of the test. During all test runs, the isolated instrument was successfully locked on and unlocked from the isolated trocar. Instrument movements gave no complications. After removal of the isolated instrument, it took three novices an average of 3. 1 (standard deviation (SD), 0. 7) seconds to replace it correctly on the isolated trocar. Conclusions - The designed IS for laparoscopy can increase sterility in environments where sterility cannot be guaranteed. The current design is developed for laparoscopy, but it can easily be adapted for other fields in minimally invasive surgery.

40|$|The initial {{in-hospital}} {{and long-term}} clinical {{experience with a}} helical autoperfusion balloon catheter {{in the treatment of}} coronary artery disease is reported, This new catheter design allows blood to flow passively around the inflated <b>balloon</b> through a <b>protected</b> helical channel molded into the balloon surface, Twelve consecutive patients underwent PTCA. Continuous ST monitoring, heart rate, average peak distal coronary blood flow velocity (APV), coronary blood flow (CBF), dP/dt and systemic and pulmonary arterial pressures were determined during PTCA, During balloon inflation there were no hemodynamic changes, TIMI flow was 1. 7 +/- 0. 8, and APV was 39 % of baseline, Luminal diameter stenosis improved from 61 +/- 17 to 29 +/- 13 % (P < 0. 05) following PTCA. Mean continuous inflation duration was 385 +/- 215 sec and 6 / 12 patients had {{greater than or equal to}} 7. 5 -min inflations. There were no in-hospital adverse cardiac events. One patient developed recurrent angina during 8 mo of follow-up and underwent successful PTCA of a restenotic lesion. We conclude that human plaques can be successfully dilated with a helical balloon catheter that provides autoperfusion and the ability to perform prolonged inflations with hemodynamic stability, A comparison of this PTCA catheter with standard balloon catheters is warranted.

40|$|AbstractObjectives. The {{purpose of}} the present study was to assess whether brief, {{repeated}} coronary artery occlusions during <b>balloon</b> angioplasty <b>protect</b> against ischemia-induced ventricular ectopy. Background. Most sudden cardiac deaths are caused by fatal ventricular arrhythmias precipitated by early myocardial ischemia of acute coronary occlusion. In animals, a preceding 3 - to 5 -min coronary occlusion protects against malignant ventricular arrhythmias during a subsequent prolonged coronary occlusion. Whether such an antiarrhythmic effect caused by ischemic preconditioning occurs in humans is not known. Methods. To assess the effects of a preceding, brief vessel occlusion–reperfusion cycle on the occurrence of ventricular ectopy, continuous electrocardiographic, heart rate and blood pressure recordings were performed in 156 patients before and during two identical balloon occlusions of a coronary artery (mean 111 s) separated by a 5 -min equilibration period. Results. The occluded vessel was the left anterior descending coronary artery in 94 patients, the left circumflex branch in 29 patients and the right coronary artery in 33 patients. Balloon occlusion of a coronary artery caused ventricular ectopy in 24 patients. The incidence of ventricular ectopy was higher during the first occlusion than during the second occlusion (21 patients [13. 5 %] vs. 11 patients [7 %], p = 0. 02). In 13 patients, ventricular ectopy was observed only during the first occlusion; in 8 patients during both occlusions; and in 3 patients only during the second occlusion. Bigeminal or repetitive ectopic beats were observed in eight patients during the first coronary occlusion and in four patients during the second occlusion. Atrial premature beats occurred during the first occlusion in three patients, but in none of the patients during the second occlusion. The 24 patients with ventricular ectopy during coronary occlusion had milder stenosis than the rest of the patients (mean [±SD] 74 ± 12 % vs. 81 ± 12 %, p = 0. 01). The 13 patients with ventricular ectopy only during the first occlusion did not, however, differ significantly with respect to any clinical or angiographic features from the rest of the patients with ventricular ectopy. There were no significant differences in the signs of myocardial ischemia or hemodynamic variables between the sequential occlusions. Conclusions. A preceding, short vessel occlusion–reperfusion cycle seems to increase the electrical stability of ischemic myocardium.
