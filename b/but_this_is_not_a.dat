5|$|Coyotes rarely kill healthy adult red foxes, {{and have}} been {{observed}} to feed or den alongside them, though they often kill foxes caught in traps. Coyotes may kill fox kits, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> major source of mortality. In southern California, coyotes frequently kill gray foxes, and these smaller canids tend to avoid areas with high coyote densities.|$|E

25|$|Dawkins hypothesises that {{practitioners}} of alternative medicine spend longer time than regular doctors on their patients when attending to them.

25|$|The mouse emits a {{sound when}} the scroll ball is rolled, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> direct {{product of the}} ball moving; the sound is {{actually}} produced by a tiny speaker inside the mouse.

25|$|Human MHC class I and II {{are also}} called human {{leukocyte}} antigen (HLA).

25|$|Of {{these many}} ranks, {{the most basic}} is species. However, {{this is not to}} say that a taxon at any other rank may not be sharply defined, or that any species is {{guaranteed}} to be sharply defined. It varies from case to case.

25|$|In a vacuum, {{there is}} no medium for {{removing}} heat from the body by conduction or convection. Loss of heat is by radiation from the 310 K temperature of a person to the 3 K of outer space. This is a slow process, especially in a clothed person, so {{there is no}} danger of immediately freezing. Rapid evaporative cooling of skin moisture in a vacuum may create frost, particularly in the mouth, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> significant hazard.|$|E

25|$|For instance, de Haan (1999, 2001, 2005) {{states that}} evidentiality asserts {{evidence}} while epistemic modality evaluates evidence and that evidentiality is {{more akin to}} a deictic category marking the relationship between speakers and events/actions (like the way demonstratives mark the relationship between speakers and objects, see also Joseph 2003). Aikhenvald (2003) finds that evidentials may indicate a speaker's attitude {{about the validity of}} a statement <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> required feature of evidentials. Additionally, she finds that evidential-marking may co-occur with epistemic-marking, but it may also co-occur with aspectual/tense or mirative marking.|$|E
25|$|Lineaged Wicca is {{organised}} into covens of initiated priests and priestesses. Covens are autonomous, and are generally {{headed by a}} High Priest and a High Priestess working in partnership, being a couple who have each been through their first, second and third degrees of initiation. Occasionally the leaders of a coven are only second-degree initiates, in which case they come {{under the rule of}} the parent coven. Initiation and training of new priesthood is most often performed within a coven environment, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> necessity, and a few initiated Wiccans are unaffiliated with any coven.|$|E
500|$|Auricularia auricula-judae {{is similar}} to A.fuscosuccinea in colour and texture, and [...] "may be {{confused}} with it if only external features are considered". The spore and basidia sizes of the two species are slightly different, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> reliable way to tell them apart. A.cornea is another similar species in the same genus, but has distinct internal differences, is normally more pilose (more covered in soft hair) and tends to fruit in larger numbers.|$|E

In the end, a centre-right candidate was chosen: José Manuel Barroso of the European People's Party.|$|E
500|$|Altrincham Interchange {{is one of}} the Metrolink's termini. The {{interchange}} was refurbished (2015-16), and {{now includes}} a brand new footbridge, with 3 lifts to cope with increased passenger demands, including a larger scale ticket office, and modern bus interchange. The new Interchange is a modern design building that looks fantastic and is helping to regenerate Altrincham city centre as the new building has helped to transform the surrounding area. The Interchange connects the town to several locations in Greater Manchester, such as Sale and Bury. The service also includes Navigation Road station. Metrolink services leave around every six minutes, between 07:15 and 19:30 on weekdays, and less frequently at other times. National Rail services link the Altrincham and Navigation Road stations with Chester via Northwich, and with Manchester via Stockport. Altrincham Interchange, next to the railway station, is a hub for local bus routes. Manchester Airport, the largest in the UK outside London, is [...] to the southeast of the town, and is connected via the Manchester Picadilly – Crewe line. There are plans in the future to create a new link between Manchester Airport and the Mid Cheshire Line, which Altrincham Interchange is a station on. Recently the Metrolink completed connections to this airport and opened the line 12 months early, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> direct connection from the Metrolink line at Altrincham Interchange ...|$|E
