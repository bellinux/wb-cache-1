40|$|Field {{trials were}} {{conducted}} in 2010 / 11, 2012 and 2013 at the Royal Agricultural University’s Soil Association certified organic Harnhill Manor Farm, Gloucestershire, UK (NGR SP 075 006), to investigate suitable cultivation techniques and legume cover crops for winter and spring wheat production. Cultivation treatments included conventional tillage (CT), low residue non-inversion tillage (LRNiT) and high residue non-inversion tillage (HRNiT) as main plots while undersowing white clover (WC), <b>black</b> <b>medic</b> (BM) or no undersowing (Nus) as subplots. Wheat establishment, growth, grain yield and weeds infestation were assessed to determine the feasibility of these husbandry techniques. For winter wheat in 2010 / 11, LRNiT {{seems to be an}} acceptable alternative for CT. However, for spring wheat in 2012 and 2013, CT seems to be more reliable management option. The performance of undersown legumes was highly weather reliant and inconsistent in the seasons studied. Plant establishment and the succeeding yield parameters were positively related to grain yield. CT had significantly higher plant establishment than LRNiT or HRNiT in each season. For winter wheat, the competition and compensation on shoot density among CT and LRNiT did potentially outweighed cultivation-induced effects on plant establishment. This condition resulted in statistically equivalent crop growth and yields with LRNiT to that of CT. In contrast, for spring wheat in 2012 and 2013, CT that had significantly higher plant establishment also resulted in better crop growth and greater grain yields than other cultivation treatments. In all seasons, HRNiT had significantly lower plant establishment and also reduced grain yields, compared with LRNiT or CT. More soil cultivation also significantly reduced total weeds than less tilled soil such as HRNiT. On the basis of weed species, significantly higher broadleaf weeds were present under CT and significantly higher grass weeds were present under HRNiT. Out of three investigated years, legume cover crops effects were clearly observed only in 2012 with spring wheat. More vigorous growth of WC showed a significantly inverse relationship with broadleaf weeds and total weeds, compared with slow growing BM. This situation, resulted in non-significant yield components or grain yield reduction, compared with non-undersown spring wheat.

40|$|As {{costs for}} mineral {{fertilisers}} rise, legume-based leys are recognised {{as a potential}} alternative nitrogen source for crops. Here we demonstrate that including species-rich legume-based leys in rotations helps to maximise synergies between agricultural productivity and other ecosystem services. By using functionally diverse plant species mixtures, these services can be optimised and fine-tuned to regional and farm-specific needs. Replicated field experiments were conducted over three years at multiple locations, testing the performance of 12 legume species and 4 grass species sown in monocultures, {{as well as in}} a mixture of 10 of the legumes and all 4 grasses (called the All Species Mix, ASM). In addition, we compared this complex mixture to farmer-chosen ley mixtures on 34 sites across the UK. The trials showed that there is a large degree of functional complementarity among the legume species. No single species scored high on all evaluation criteria. In particular, the currently most frequently used species, white clover, is outscored by other legume species on a number of parameters such as early development and resistance to decomposition. Further complementarity emerged from the different responses of legume species to environmental variables, with soil pH and grazing or cutting regime being among the more important factors. For example, while large birdsfoot trefoil showed better performance on more acidic soils, the opposite was true for sainfoin, lucerne and <b>black</b> <b>medic.</b> In comparison with the monocultures, the ASM showed increased ground cover, increased above-ground biomass and reduced weed biomass. Benefits of mixing species with regard to productivity increased over time. In addition, the stability of biomass production across sites was greater in the ASM than in the legume monocultures. Within the on-farm trials, we further found that on soils low in organic matter the biomass advantage of the ASM over the Control ley was more marked than on the soils with higher organic matter content. Ecological modelling revealed that the three best multifunctional mixtures all contained <b>black</b> <b>medic,</b> lucerne and red clover. Within the long term New Farming Systems (NFS) rotational study, the use of a clover bi-crop showed improvement to soil characteristics compared to current practice (e. g. bulk density and water infiltration rate). Improvements in wheat yield were also noted with respect to the inclusion of a clover bi-crop in 2010, but there was evidence of a decline in response as the N dose was increased.

40|$|The {{results of}} a three year study in the UK {{suggest that there are}} several {{advantages}} to more complex mixtures; • Greater resilience to variable conditions • Combine early and late weed suppression • Slower decomposition on incorporation • Extends forage availability for key insect pollinators • Generally achieve higher forage yields • Potential for higher subsequent crop yields. Practical recommendation • There are a number of plant characteristics that have an impact on nitrogen release and mobilisation, namely C:N ratio, lignin and polyphenol content which result in slower N release and lower N losses or better N utilisation. • Including grass species in the mix takes up the N fixed by the legumes and reduces the free N in the soil; the rhizobia bacteria respond to the low soil N, resulting in higher N fixation and greater biomass. Moreover the higher C:N ratio prolongs the release of N to subsequent crops. The balance of grass and legumes is important. • The annual N accumulation of ley mixtures decreases after two years, although there may be other advantages from longer leys such as weed control. • In terms of forage yield including a 3 rd or 4 th legume is generally advantageous. • The best multifunctional mixtures contain one or more species of <b>Black</b> <b>Medic,</b> Lucerne and Red Clover, plus other legumes according to the circumstances...|$|E

Besides the common Bermuda grass, there are several varieties, the most important of which are the Giant, characterized by a very large growth, and St. Lucie grass, similar to ordinary Bermuda grass, but lacking underground rootstocks. Bermuda grass grows well mixed with lespedeza for a summer crop. Bur clover, <b>black</b> <b>medic,</b> and hairy vetch as winter crops alternate well with it.

Under exceptional circumstances three or more cuttings may be secured in a season, giving total yields of from 6 to 10 tons of hay per acre.

A principal components analysis of the 1991 - 2002 survey data for 15 species showed clearly the influence of inorganic N fertilizer levels on the frequency of individual species. The frequency of one species (common chickweed) was greatly favored by increasing amounts of nitrogen fertilizer from 0 to 288 kg N ha(- 1), others were strongly disadvantaged (e. g., <b>black</b> <b>medic</b> and field horsetail), some were slightly disadvantaged (e. g., common vetch and parsley-piert), and some showed little response to differing N rates (e. g., blackgrass and corn poppy). Other weed investigations include studies on the effects of fallowing on the weed seed bank, seed dormancy and persistence, agroecology, and population dynamics of individual weed species. Recently, molecular approaches have been used to study the genetic diversity of weeds found on Section 8, which is one of the few arable sites in the country where herbicides have never been applied. This site also provides an invaluable reserve for seven nationally rare or uncommon species.

40|$|Rhizobia play {{important}} roles in agriculture owing {{to their ability to}} fix nitrogen through a symbiosis with legumes. The specificity of rhizobia-legume associations means that underused legume species may depend on seed inoculation with their rhizobial partners. For <b>black</b> <b>medic</b> (Medicago lupulina) and lucerne (Medicago sativa) {{little is known about the}} natural prevalence of their rhizobial partner Ensifer meliloti in UK soils, so that the need for inoculating them is unclear. We analysed the site-dependence of rhizobial seed inoculation effects on the subsequent ability of rhizobial communities to form symbioses with four legume species (Medicago lupulina, M. sativa, Trifolium repens and T. pratense). At ten organic farms across the UK, a species-diverse legume based mixture (LBM) which included these four species was grown. The LBM seed was inoculated with a mix of commercial inocula specific for clover and lucerne. At each site, soil from the LBM treatment was compared to the soil sampled prior to the sowing of the LBM (the control). From each site and each of the two treatments, a suspension of soils was applied to seedlings of the four legume species and grown in axenic conditions for six weeks. Root nodules were counted and their rhizobia isolated. PCR and sequencing of a fragment of the gyrB gene from rhizobial isolates allowed identification of strains. The number of nodules on each of the four legume species was significantly increased when inoculated with soil from the LBM treatment compared to the control. Both the proportion of plants forming nodules and the number of nodules formed varied significantly by site, with sites significantly affecting the Medicago species but not the Trifolium species. These differences in nodulation were broadly reflected in plant biomass where site and treatment interacted; at some sites there was a significant advantage from inoculation with the commercial inoculum but not at others. In particular, this study has demonstrated the commercial merit of inoculation of lucerne with compatible rhizobia...|$|E
40|$|Wheat {{yields and}} grain protein content are lower and more {{variable}} in organic conditions than in conventional agriculture, mainly due to nitrogen (N) deficiency and weed competition. The undersowing of legume cover crops in growing winter wheat, {{also known as}} relay intercropping, {{is assumed to be}} a proficient way of enriching the soil-crop system with N and improving weed control. However, competition for resources may impair wheat performance. Relay intercropping in springtime in growing winter wheat is expected to limit competition for resources from the legume. The aim of our study was to analyze wheat performance and resource competition in relay intercropping systems with legume cover crops under various environmental conditions. Eight field experiments were conducted on organic grain-oriented farms located in southeast France. <b>Black</b> <b>medic</b> (Medicago lupulina), alfalfa (Medicago sativa), red clover (Trifolium pratense) and white clover (Trifolium repens), undersown at wheat tillering stage, were compared with a sole crop of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum cv. Lona). The aerial biomass of wheat and legumes and total N content of wheat were determined at both the flowering stage and harvest time of the wheat. The main trophic resources (water, N and light) were monitored at similar stages. Wheat grain yield and grain protein content were also measured. Sites were classified according to wheat sole crop performance at harvest to evaluate the effect of relay intercropping in the various conditions tested. In {{all but one of the}} thirty-two treatments, wheat grain yield was not significantly disturbed by relay intercropping whatever the aerial development of legumes. Abundant aerial development of legumes after flowering (> 20 % of the aerial biomass of wheat at harvest) was associated with a mean significant decrease in wheat grain protein content of 8. 5 % of the control treatment value, this occurring in one third of the situations. These ratios of aerial biomasses of legumes compared to wheat were also associated with reductions in soil moisture and wheat N uptake. The effect on the availability of trophic resources for wheat may have led to a decrease in grain protein content without having any effect on grain yield. Sites which registered a low performance for wheat sole crops were less negatively impacted by the presence and aerial development of legumes. The performance of the four legume species and the mechanisms of induced disturbance of resource availability are then discussed. Finally, we try to define ranges of legumes' development and resource availability in which wheat performance was maintained or limited. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Agriculture {{is facing}} {{increasing}} pressures to produce food that meets specific market and/or nutrition requirements, while using inputs {{in such a}} way that can ensure economic and environmental goals more efficiently. Two field experiments were conducted in 2013 and 2014 at the Royal Agricultural University’s Harnhill’ Manor Farm, Cirencester, UK to evaluate the influence of selected cultivation techniques, N fertilisation and undersowing legumes on spring wheat growth and development. To explore, in particular, the yield components contributing to grain yield and quality, as well as weed pressure influences together with changes in soil mineral N (SMN) content. Cultivation techniques included conventional tillage (CT), high intensity non-inversion tillage (HINiT) and low intensity non-inversion tillage (LINiT); mineral N fertilisation rates of 0, 70, 140 and 210 kg N ha- 1 and two undersown legume species, <b>black</b> <b>medic</b> and white clover, plus no undersowing treatment. The performance of the management practices was strongly influenced by the weather. In 2013, under dry weather conditions, LINiT seems to be a suitable alternative to CT, while N fertilisation did not encourage greater grain yield. In 2014, CT appears to be a more reliable practice, while the application of up to 140 kg N ha- 1 seemed to be enough to increase grain yield. Dry weather conditions at the time of broadcasting did not allow the undersowing species to be fully established, resulting in no effects on weed control and crop growth. In 2013, the initial poor plant establishment and slow crop growth under LINiT was compensated for by the soils ability to retain moisture, and thereby reducing crop water stress during the dry periods. This finally resulted in statistically similar grain yield to CT. In 2014 when water was not a limiting factor, poor plant establishment and crop growth, low SMN content and high weed pressure under LINiT resulted in lower grain yield than CT. In both years, HINiT resulted in low SMN content and high weed pressure resulting in poor grain yield. Across experiments, HINiT and LINiT saved energy-use and production costs, but CT could be more energy-use efficient and have high economic return if higher grain yield is assured. N fertilisation significantly promoted wheat growth, although under dry conditions with higher residual soil N, the N fertilisation did not increase yield. Under low SMN level applying up to 140 kg N ha- 1 increased grain yield produced, but N fertilisation is energy consuming and its use does not always ensure a higher economic return...|$|E
