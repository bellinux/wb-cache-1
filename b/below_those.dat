5|$|Early {{difficulties}} with staff conditions and wages, {{which the company}} was attempting to simplify from the complex contracts arranged by LCBS, led to strike action by staff in February 1988. Performance levels on contracted routes were already <b>below</b> <b>those</b> expected by the local councils who had awarded LCNE the contracts, and by London Regional Transport. Following the strike three of the company's London contracts (routes 292, 298 and 313) were terminated and awarded to independents.|$|E

5|$|Since {{their first}} match in 2006, 52players have {{represented}} Ireland in One Day Internationals (ODIs). Ireland played their maiden ODI on 13June 2006 against England. Ireland lost by 38runs, although the match drew interest and was played in front a full capacity {{crowd at the}} Civil Service Cricket Club in Belfast. By reaching {{the final of the}} 2005 ICC Trophy, Ireland qualified for the 2007 World Cup, where they progressed to the super eights by beating Pakistan and made a tie against Zimbabwe In the second round-robin stage of the tournament managed victory against Bangladesh. Ireland's performance, which took pundits by surprise, propelled them to 10th place in the ICC ODI rankings, ahead of Zimbabwe and Kenya. Ireland is one of two associate nations {{to be part of the}} rankings; associates are the next level of team <b>below</b> <b>those</b> that play Test cricket.|$|E
5|$|Churchill's {{return to}} the prime ministership meant Lord Cherwell's {{return to the}} post of Paymaster General. He was a strong {{supporter}} of the atomic energy programme, but while he agreed with its size and scope, he was critical of its organisation, which he blamed for slower progress than its Soviet counterpart. In particular, the programme had experienced problems with Civil Service pay and conditions, which were <b>below</b> <b>those</b> for comparable workers in industry. The Treasury had agreed to some flexibility in exceptional cases, but the procedure for doing so was absurdly slow. Hinton in particular was concerned at the low remuneration his senior staff were receiving compared with those with similar responsibilities at ICI. When he attempted to bring Frank Kearton in as his successor, the Treasury refused to adjust the salaries of his other two deputies to match. Rather than ruin his organisation's morale, Hinton had dropped the proposal to appoint Kearton. Nor could any reorganisation be carried out without Treasury approval. Within a month of assuming office, Cherwell had prepared a memorandum proposing that responsibility for the program be transferred from the Ministry of Supply to an Atomic Energy Commission.|$|E

25|$|Another area of {{research}} focuses on the prevention of thermal runaway in batteries. The researchers coated the anode or separator layer of the battery with microspheres sensitive to heat. An increase in temperature causes the microspheres to melt, blocking transmission of the lithium ions and causing the battery to shut down. Microspheres of both polyethylene and paraffin wax were tested with CR2032 Li-ion batteries and demonstrated both successful operation of the battery at normal temperatures and shutdown of the battery at temperatures <b>below</b> <b>those</b> at which the battery's separator would become damaged.|$|E

The costs of power from wind and solar are already <b>below</b> <b>those</b> of {{conventional}} electricity generation {{in some parts of}} the world, as they have fallen sharply and will continue to do so. He also asserts, that the electrical grid has been greatly expanded worldwide, and is ready to receive and distribute electricity from renewable sources.

25|$|Bernstein's {{conducting}} {{was characterized}} by extremes of emotion with the rhythmic pulse of the music conveyed visually through his balletic podium manner. Musicians often reported that his manner in rehearsal {{was the same as}} in concert. As he got older his performances tended to be overlaid to a greater extent with a personal expressiveness which often divided critical opinion. Extreme examples of this style can be found in his Deutsche Grammophon recordings of Nimrod from Elgar's Enigma Variations (1982), the end of Mahler's 9th Symphony (1985), and the finale of Tchaikovsky's Pathetique Symphony (1986), where in each case the tempos are well <b>below</b> <b>those</b> typically chosen.|$|E

Brian Statham had the unusual distinction of heading both batting and bowling averages, though his average of 70 with the bat reflected {{the fact that he}} was dismissed only once in three innings. Fred Trueman, scourge of the Indian cricket team in England in 1952, took most wickets with 24 at 16.70.|$|E

Though Hell's Kitchen's gritty reputation had long held real-estate prices <b>below</b> <b>those</b> of most other areas of Manhattan, by 1969, the City Planning Commission's Plan for New York City reported that development pressures related to its Midtown location were driving people of modest means from the area. Since the early 1990s, the area has been gentrifying, and rents have risen rapidly.

Although impacted by the Great Recession, NWA's economy fared better than most peer metropolitan areas, the state of Arkansas and the United States overall. Between 2007 and 2013, the region saw unemployment rates significantly <b>below</b> <b>those</b> of peer regions and the national average; while also seeing a 1% net growth of jobs. The NWA gross domestic product grew 7.0% over the aforementioned time period, and bankruptcies, building permits and per capita incomes are returning to pre-Recession rates.|$|E
25|$|The US {{government}} in Puerto Rico enticed US companies by providing labor at costs <b>below</b> <b>those</b> on the mainland, access to contiguous US markets without import duties, and profits that could {{transfer to the}} mainland free from federal taxation. The Administration of Economic Development invited investment of external capital, importing the raw materials, and exporting the finished products to the mainland. To entice participation, tax exemptions and differential rental rates were offered for industrial facilities. As a result, Puerto Rico's economy shifted labor from agriculture to manufacturing and tourism. The manufacturing sector has shifted from the original labor-intensive industries, such as the manufacturing of food, tobacco, leather, and apparel products, to more capital-intensive industries, such as pharmaceuticals, chemicals, machinery, and electronics. Through this project, a rural agricultural society was transformed into an industrial working class.|$|E
