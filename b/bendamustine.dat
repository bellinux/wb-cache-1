50|$|Trial results {{released}} in June 2012 show that <b>bendamustine,</b> a drug first developed in East Germany in the 1960s, {{more than doubled}} disease progression-free survival when given along with rituximab. This combination therapy also left patients with fewer side effects than the older treatment (a combination of five drugs—rituximab, cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan), doxorubicin (Adriamycin), vincristine and prednisone, collectively called R-CHOP).|$|E
50|$|Phase II {{clinical}} trials are in progress {{for treatment of}} endometrial cancer, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, cholangiocarcinoma, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

50|$|Non-gastric MALT {{can appear}} {{in a variety of}} areas {{throughout}} the body. Therefore, treatment is usually based on the exact location and extent of spread. Treatment typically includes surgery for certain sites (lung, breast) or radiation therapy with or without chemotherapy. More advanced disease usually includes immunoradiotherapy with chemotherapy. Among the common first-line treatments are <b>bendamustine</b> plus rituximab and R-CHOP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone). Recently, antibiotic therapy such as doxycycline {{has been shown to be}} effective in marginal zone lymphoma that affects the area around the eye ("ocular adnexal marginal zone lymphoma").|$|E
50|$|Chemotherapy {{is widely}} used as {{frontline}} treatment, and often is not repeated in relapse due to side effects. Alternate chemotherapy is sometimes used at first relapse. For frontline treatment, CHOP with rituximab {{is the most common}} chemotherapy, and often given as outpatient by IV. A stronger chemotherapy with greater side effects (mostly hematologic) is HyperCVAD, often given as in-patient, with rituximab and generally to fitter patients (some of which are over 65). HyperCVAD is becoming popular and showing promising results, especially with rituximab. It can be used on some elderly (over 65) patients, but seems only beneficial when the baseline Beta-2-MG blood test was normal. It is showing better complete remissions (CR) and progression free survival (PFS) than CHOP regimens. A less intensive option is <b>bendamustine</b> with rituximab.|$|E
40|$|By {{using the}} GRADE system we {{produced}} the following {{recommendations for the}} use of <b>bendamustine</b> in the first-line treatment of CLL: (1) <b>bendamustine</b> with rituximab is recommended in elderly fit patients potentially eligible to FCR; (2) <b>Bendamustine</b> alone is recommended in patients who are candidate to chlorambucil alone; (3) Rituximab-bendamustine is recommended in patients not eligible to FCR, but suitable to receive rituximab. Consensus-based recommendations addressed evidence-orphan issues concerning the use of <b>bendamustine</b> in genetically-defined high-risk patients and the appropriate dose of <b>bendamustine</b> as single agent or in association with rituximab. ...|$|E

40|$|Clinical {{responses}} to <b>bendamustine</b> in {{chronic lymphocytic leukemia}} (CLL) are highly heterogeneous and no specific markers to predict sensitivity to this drug have been reported. In order to identify biomarkers of response, we analyzed the in vitro activity of <b>bendamustine</b> and the gene expression profile in primary CLL cells. We observed that mRNA expression of CD 69 (CD 69) and ITGAM (CD 11 b) constitute the most powerful predictor of response to <b>bendamustine.</b> When we interrogated the predictive value of the corresponding cell surface proteins, {{the expression of the}} activation marker CD 69 was the most reliable predictor of sensitivity to <b>bendamustine.</b> Importantly, a multivariate analysis revealed that the predictive value of CD 69 expression was independent from other clinico-biological CLL features. We also showed that when CLL cells were co-cultured with distinct subtypes of stromal cells, an upregulation of CD 69 was accompanied by a reduced sensitivity to <b>bendamustine.</b> In agreement with this, tumor cells derived from lymphoid tumor niches harbored higher CD 69 expression and were less sensitive to <b>bendamustine</b> than their peripheral blood counterparts. Furthermore, pretreatment of CD 69 high CLL cases with the B-cell receptor (BCR) pathway inhibitors ibrutinib and idelalisib decreased CD 69 levels and enhanced <b>bendamustine</b> cytotoxic effect. Collectively, our findings indicate that CD 69 could be a predictor of <b>bendamustine</b> response in CLL patients and the combination of clinically-tested BCR signaling inhibitors with <b>bendamustine</b> may represent a promising strategy for <b>bendamustine</b> low responsive CLL cases...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Objective In {{patients}} with multiple myeloma, <b>bendamustine</b> monotherapy is effective as 1 st and 2 nd line therapy. However, data for {{patients with}} advanced multiple myeloma is rare. Methods In this retrospective analysis we have identified 39 patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma by means of case research, who have been treated at our institution with <b>bendamustine</b> as salvage therapy. After in median 2 lines of prior therapy (range: 1 - 5) patients received in median 3 (range: 1 - 10) cycles of <b>bendamustine.</b> <b>Bendamustine</b> dosage was 80 - 150 mg on day 1 + 2 of a monthly cycle. <b>Bendamustine</b> was administered as monotherapy in 39 % of patients, whereas 61 % received concomitant steroids. Results Toxicity was mild to moderate. Response rates were as follows: 3 % vgPR, 33 % PR, 18 % MR, 26 % SD and 20 % PD. The median event-free and overall survival were 7 and 17 months, respectively. Conclusions In conclusion, in patients with advanced multiple myeloma <b>bendamustine</b> is effective and associated with mild toxicity. Therefore, the role of <b>bendamustine</b> in patients with multiple myeloma should be investigated in further clinical trials. </p...|$|E
