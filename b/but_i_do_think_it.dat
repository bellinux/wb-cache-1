60|$|The Italian {{government}} had providently arranged {{that the car}} we changed into should be standing beyond the station in the dash of an unexpected shower, and {{that it should be}} provided with steps so high and steep, with Italian ladies standing all over them and sticking their umbrellas into the faces of American citizens trying to get in after them, that it was a feat of something like mountain-climbing to reach the corridor, and then of daring-do to secure a compartment. Though a collectivist, with a firm belief in the government ownership of railroads everywhere, I might have been tempted at times in Italy to abjure my creed if I had not always reflected that the state there had just come into possession of the roads, with all their capitalistic faults of management and outwear of equipment which it would doubtless soon reform and repair. I venture to suggest now, however, that its prime duty is to have platforms level with the car-doors, as they are in England, and not to let Italian ladies stand in the doorways with their umbrellas. I do not insist that it shall impose silence and sobriety upon a party of young French people in the next compartment, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> should remove those mountains back from the sea so that the trains carrying cultivated Americans can run along the open shore the whole way to Genoa. Pending this, it should provide strong and watchful employees to lower and raise the windows at the mouth of each of the eighty tunnels in every car. I do not demand that it shall change the site of the station in Genoa so that it shall not always be the city's whole length away from the hotel you have chosen, but I think this would be a desirable improvement, especially if it is after dark when you arrive and raining a peculiarly cold, disagreeable rain.|$|E

I make every allowance, I hope, for a lady in her melancholy situation. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> is not very grateful to have quite forgotten Mr. Winterfield, who has done so much for her, and who only asks to pass a few hours of his day innocently in her society. Perhaps, being a single woman, I write ignorantly about mothers and babies. But I have my feelings; and (though I never liked Mr. Romayne) I feel for you, sir--if you will forgive the familiarity. In my opinion this new craze about the baby will wear out. He is already a cause of difference of opinion. My good mistress, who possesses knowledge of the world, and a kind heart as well, advises that Mr. Romayne should be informed of {{the birth of}} a son and heir. Mrs. Eyrecourt says, most truly, that the hateful old priest will get possession of Mr. Romayne's property, to the prejudice of the child, unless steps are taken to shame him into doing justice to his own son. But Mrs. Romayne is as proud as Lucifer; she will not hear of making the first advances, as she calls it. 'The man who has deserted me,' she says, 'has no heart to be touched either by wife or child.' My mistress does not agree with her. There have been hard words already, and the nice old French gentleman and his wife try to make peace. You will smile when I tell you that they offer sugar-plums as a sort of composing gift. My mistress accepts the gift, and has been to the theater at Paris, with Monsieur and Madame Villeray more than once already. To conclude, sir, if I might venture to advise you, I should recommend trying the effect on Mrs. R. of absence and silence." ...|$|E

60|$|The urgent {{point at}} present {{is that these}} {{expansive}} educators do not avoid the violence of authority an inch more than the old school masters. Nay, it might be maintained that they avoid it less. The old village schoolmaster beat a boy for not learning grammar and sent him out into the playground to play anything he liked; or at nothing, if he liked that better. The modern scientific schoolmaster pursues him into the playground and makes him play at cricket, because exercise is so good for the health. The modern Dr. Busby is a doctor of medicine {{as well as a}} doctor of divinity. He may say that the good of exercise is self-evident; but he must say it, and say it with authority. It cannot really be self-evident or it never could have been compulsory. But this is in modern practice a very mild case. In modern practice the free educationists forbid far more things than the old-fashioned educationists. A person with a taste for paradox (if any such shameless creature could exist) might with some plausibility maintain concerning all our expansion since the failure of Luther's frank paganism and its replacement by Calvin's Puritanism, that all this expansion has not been an expansion, but the closing in of a prison, so that less and less beautiful and humane things have been permitted. The Puritans destroyed images; the Rationalists forbade fairy tales. Count Tostoi practically issued one of his papal encyclicals against music; and I have heard of modern educationists who forbid children to play with tin soldiers. I remember a meek little madman who came up to me at some Socialist soiree or other, and asked me to use my influence (have I any influence?) against adventure stories for boys. It seems they breed an appetite for blood. But never mind that; one must keep one's temper in this madhouse. I need only insist here that these things, even if a just deprivation, are a deprivation. I do not deny that the old vetoes and punishments were often idiotic and cruel; though they are much more so in a country like England (where in practice only a rich man decrees the punishment and only a poor man receives it) than in countries with a clearer popular tradition--such as Russia. In Russia flogging is often inflicted by peasants on a peasant. In modern England flogging can only in practice be inflicted by a gentleman on a very poor man. Thus only a few days ago as I write a small boy (a son of the poor, of course) was sentenced to flogging and imprisonment for five years for having picked up a small piece of coal which the experts value at 5d. I am entirely on the side of such liberals and humanitarians as have protested against this almost bestial ignorance about boys. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> a little unfair that these humanitarians, who excuse boys for being robbers, should denounce them for playing at robbers. I do think that those who understand a guttersnipe playing with a piece of coal might, by a sudden spurt of imagination, understand him playing with a tin soldier. To sum it up in one sentence: I think my meek little madman might have understood that there is many a boy who would rather be flogged, and unjustly flogged, than have his adventure story taken away.|$|E

He was not very bad; but his imitation of Simonton was [...] so obvious and so queerly mixed with his own churchy style that he [...] seemed rather monotonous and affected. At least I thought so. I was [...] dreadfully uncomfortable during the reading because of Marmaduke, [...] who behaved scandalously. There were some schoolboys present; and [...] he not only encouraged them to misbehave themselves, but was worse [...] than any of them himself.

They are good-humored, bouncing [...] girls; but they are certainly not brilliant. I hope it is not Aunt [...] Dora's walnut table that is broken. Was it not mean of Parson's man [...] to tell on Armande?

40|$|It {{must not}} beforgotten {{that if there}} was bad borrowing. there was also bad lending. As a result of {{reckless}} competi-tion, encouragement was sometimes given to borrowers and lenders alike without sufficient understanding of what was involved; loans were often madefor unproductive purposes; sufficient care was not always exercised to see that a loan was usedfor the purpose for which it was granted; and high interest rates, instead of encouraging investors to inquire into the likelihood that the borrower could meet his obli-gations,failed to do anything but encourage them to invest their money. It is important that there should be in the future a greater sense of responsibility both in borrowing and lending than hasfrequently been the case in the past. World Bank, Second Annual Report (1946 â€” 47), pp. 14 â€” 15 A 5 the above quotation suggests, the perceived nature ofthe current international financial situation, and some of the lessons being drawn from it, are eerily similar to what existed in the late 1940 s, following the worldwide wave of defaults on foreign borrowings in the 1930 s.
