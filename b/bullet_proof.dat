5|$|In June 2015, {{two members}} of the Security Committee of the Czech Parliament visited Uherský Brod and talked to {{multiple}} witnesses. The MPs issued a report condemning handling of the situation by the police. Among other issues, the MPs criticized that policemen parked their cars and put <b>bullet</b> <b>proof</b> vests on within the shooting range of the attacker, initially failed to get information from the witnesses and only later during the intervention attempted to contact them, didn't cover the back exit and thus potentially allowed the perpetrator {{to get out of the}} object and jeopardize other people. The police even let a helicopter land within the shooting range of the attacker. According to MPs, the police left much to be desired in regards of communication and most importantly, they wrongly decided to believe the perpetrator's claim of having hostage even though the witnesses could have readily confirmed that everyone inside was most likely dead. The policemen didn't seal the vicinity of the attack until 1pm and used civilian phones in communication with superior officers instead of using either their own phones or radio transmitters. Minister of Interior Chovanec commented that the MPs failed to interview the policemen and thus didn't get all the relevant information.|$|E
5|$|Paul's son, Robert, {{arrives in}} the guise of his twin, Cameron. Robert alienates Paul from everyone, before drugging and {{trapping}} him in an old mineshaft. Robert confesses to planting the bomb on the plane and sending a poisoned letter to Paul. Robert collapses the entrance to the mine and leaves Paul to die. Paul is eventually rescued and he is grows closer to Gail when she returns to town. Paul and Gail hold a fake wedding to lure Robert out of hiding and he shoots Paul, who survives due to a <b>bullet</b> <b>proof</b> vest. Paul goes on a downward spiral and flirts with several women, attempts to blackmail Carmella Cammeniti (Natalie Blair) and betrays Lyn Scully (Janet Andrewartha). When Max accidentally kills Cameron, Paul decides to shoot Max in revenge, but he is talked out of it. Paul begins a relationship with Lyn and they become engaged. However, after kissing Rosetta Cammeniti (Natalie Saleeba) in the lead up to the wedding, Paul admits to Lyn that he cannot be faithful to her just minutes after they marry. Having sold half of Lassiter's, keeping a 49% share for himself, Paul decides to regain full control. Knowing Oliver Barnes (David Hoflin) owns shares in Lassiter's, Paul tries to break up with relationship with Carmella and get him to date Elle.|$|E

50|$|The first {{official}} attempts at commissioning body armor {{were made in}} 1915 by the British Army Design Committee, in particular a 'Bomber's Shield' {{for the use of}} bomber pilots who were notoriously under-protected in the air from anti-aircraft bullets and shrapnel. The Experimental Ordnance Board also reviewed potential materials for <b>bullet</b> and fragment <b>proof</b> armor, such as steel plate. A 'necklet' was successfully issued on a small scale (due to cost considerations), which protected the neck and shoulders from bullets traveling at 600 feet per second with interwoven layers of silk and cotton stiffened with resin. The Dayfield body shield entered service in 1916 and a hardened breastplate was introduced the following year.|$|R
50|$|According to Ganley, in the 1980s the Cleveland mafia {{attempted}} to extort Ganley for $500,000. Ganley began {{to cooperate with}} the Cleveland division of the Federal Bureau of Investigation after his refusal to pay and Ganley was messaged he was to be killed. Ganley was provided money by the FBI to pay off the mob, and had his phone tapped, and cameras and recording equipment installed in his offices. After Ganley became known to be cooperating with the FBI, the mafia put a $1,000,000 contract on Ganley and his family. The FBI provided Ganley with an armored, <b>bullet</b> and bomb <b>proof</b> car, and moved agents into his home for his protection. One of those agents was Joseph Pistone, the subject of the 1997 Johnny Depp and Al Pacino film Donnie Brasco. Ganley's cooperation led to conviction of over 20 Cleveland mafia figures. For his work in the fight against the Cleveland mob Ganley was awarded the Louis E. Peters Memorial Service Award by the Society of Former Special Agents.|$|R
50|$|Kwai-lan, hunted by {{the corrupt}} police and Lui Kong's men, {{forced to flee}} and hide in Foshan with Ching-lung, returns to Guangzhou and wins {{in a fight with}} the Japanese martial artists, {{reviving}} the pride of Chinese martial arts. Despite opposed by Lui Kong himself, she hoped they could truly reunite all the martial arts school now, but Lui Kong is soon murdered for his possession of Yuet-hang's evidence against Sam-shui. He dies tragically, but had successfully hidden the evidence. Kwai-lan knows if anyone found it Sam-shui's life was forfeit and tries to convince him back on the right path. The two of them have a private meeting, Sam-shui admits that for the sake of their sibling relationship he could let her escape, but only her and she must swear to never interfere in his affairs. She refuses him, and both bid the other goodbye knowing one of them would soon have to die. Sam-shui, now too invested in Japanese imperialist ambitions, starts a fire to burn Po Chi Lam down to the ground in order to destroy any evidence of his wrongdoings. Because of this, the evidence was discovered, and although Fa took a <b>bullet</b> wound the <b>proof</b> was given to the national government.|$|R

25|$|As more bombs go off, the Lion's true {{identity}} is revealed (David Kaplow) and he kidnaps Ryan's daughter {{in an attempt}} to have Ryan assassinate Cordero in exchange for his daughter's safety. He's successful, as Ryan does as he's instructed, but Ryan is in turn shot and killed by Cordero's bodyguard. Eventually Kaplow makes his big move and bombs the FBI headquarters, during which time he kidnaps Ordonez. Tom makes his way to Ordonez's house, where he sees that Kaplow has tied her up and strapped a bomb to the agent. The two men fight and Kaplow manages to force Tom to handcuff himself. A policeman arrives on the scene but is killed by Kaplow, who is wounded in the process. Kaplow then escapes the house and detonates the bomb, believing that {{this is the end of}} Tom and Ordonez. However Kaplow then receives a call from Tom stating that they are not dead and that Kaplow's <b>bullet</b> <b>proof</b> vest is rigged to bombs. Finally, Tom detonates the bomb and Kaplow explodes inside the police car.|$|E
25|$|Great was the consternation {{therefore}} {{when the}} British Southern Nigeria Regiment, led by Nnewi scouts, launched a massive pre-dawn surprise attack on Awka-Etiti. A hastily organised counterattack by Awka-Etiti warriors against the superiorly armed and dug in British troops {{ended in a}} fiasco. Leading the counterattack against the British positions was the Ochiagha (commander of war). This man, an experienced General and veteran of many wars was reputed by friends and enemies alike to be completely bullet and arrow proof, a feat which he had used to good effect on many previous occasions. His being <b>bullet</b> <b>proof</b> was attributed to a powerful magic (juju) which he had acquired from his mothers family, who were strong native doctors in Ichida. It was therefore a most unforgettable experience when the British forces opened fire on the Awka-Etiti warriors at long range with maxim guns and heavy artillery. A bullet smashed the Ochiagha`s arm at the elbow with blood gushing, which forced him to drop his weapon. On seeing this, the Awka-Etiti men were demoralised and lost hope of victory. The troops routed, the Ochiagha and his bravest warriors losing their lives to the British in a last suicidal charge at the enemy positions. The surviving ringleaders and prominent warriors fled into exile to their relations in Igbo-Ukwu and {{as far away as}} Neni. The rest of Awka-Etiti was compelled to give up their firearms to the British at the Eke market square where they were destroyed. This incident ended the era of inter-communal wars between Awka-Etiti and her neighbours.|$|E
2500|$|The Dartmouth Police Department was {{established}} in 1874 following the City of Dartmouth's incorporation the previous year. The Dartmouth Police Department worked out of the Dartmouth Town Hall until the 1940s where it was moved to Wentworth Street. In the early 1990s, the Dartmouth Force {{moved to a new}} headquarters at 21 Mount Hope Avenue. It is noteworthy that the Dartmouth Police Department had a number of [...] "firsts" [...] for Nova Scotia. Those include, first with winter and summer issued clothing, air conditioned cars, and dress uniforms. The Force also was the first to have a K9 unit in the province as well as outfit its members with <b>bullet</b> <b>proof</b> vests. The town of Bedford didn't have its own police force until 1982. The Bedford Police Station was located in the current day Cascade Spa building on the Bedford Highway and later relocated to Sunnyside Mall.|$|E
2500|$|The vacated French defences on {{the ridge}} were {{considered}} by the British to be very poor, the French having relied on the firepower of their quick firing Canon de 75 modèle 1897 field guns, rather than continuous trench lines. In places, the British found that the front was only a line of sandbags on the earth. The ground was a quagmire and the front trenches could only be reached at night, after labouring through deep mud; by May the ground had dried, except in Zouave Valley. There were insufficient communication trenches to the front line and those were waterlogged and filthy with corpses. Where barbed wire had been put out, it was poor and in bad condition; the French positions were good enough for jumping-off lines for another attack but not for defence against a German offensive. The British resumed hostilities, {{only to find that}} their trench parapets were not <b>bullet</b> <b>proof</b> and both sides came into the open to dig better defences under a tacit truce. The British then found that the superiority of German observation was such, that turning the area into a [...] "windy corner" [...] of the Western Front backfired; the construction of better defences was much harder than expected.|$|E

60|$|This was not {{effected}} without terrible loss. Hundreds of {{the bravest}} Spanish {{soldiers and sailors}} were killed, and three officers who succeeded each other {{in command of the}} attack were badly wounded. The Spanish had laboured under great difficulties owing to the lack of earth to push their trenches forward {{to the edge of the}} moat, arising from the surrounding country being flooded. They only succeeded at last by building wooden machines of <b>bullet</b> <b>proof</b> planks on wheels, behind each of which four men could work. When all was prepared the Spaniards advanced to the attack, rushing up the breach with splendid valour, headed by three of their bravest leaders; but they were met by the English and Dutch, and again and again hurled back.|$|E
60|$|The {{story of}} trench attack and defence {{is no doubt}} very similar in all quarters, but I am {{convinced}} that close touch should be kept between the Allies {{on the matter of}} new inventions. The quick Latin brain may conceive and test an idea long before we do. At present there seems to be very imperfect sympathy. As an example, when I was on the British lines they were dealing with a method of clearing barbed wire. The experiments were new and were causing great interest. But on the Italian front I found that the same system had been tested for many months. In the use of <b>bullet</b> <b>proof</b> jackets for engineers and other men who have to do exposed work the Italians are also ahead of us. One of their engineers at our headquarters might give some valuable advice. At present the Italians have, as I understand, no military representative with our armies, while they receive a British General with a small staff. This seems very wrong not only {{from the point of view}} of courtesy and justice, but also because Italy has no direct means of knowing the truth about our great development. When Germans state that our new armies are made of paper, our Allies should have some official assurance of their own that this is false. I can understand our keeping neutrals from our headquarters, but surely our Allies should be on another footing.|$|E
6000|$|... "Certainly not," [...] said Trefusis. [...] "A king {{nowadays}} {{is only a}} dummy put up to {{draw your}} fire off the real oppressors of society, and the fraction of his salary that he can spend as he likes is usually far too small for his risk, his trouble, and the condition of personal slavery to which he is reduced. What private man in England is worse off than the constitutional monarch? We deny him all privacy; he may not marry whom he chooses, consort with whom he prefers, dress according to his taste, or live where he pleases. I don't believe he may even eat or drink what he likes best; a taste for tripe and onions on his part would provoke a remonstrance from the Privy Council. We dictate everything except his thoughts and dreams, and even these he must keep to himself {{if they are not}} suitable, in our opinion, to his condition. The work we impose on him has all the hardship of mere task work; it is unfruitful, incessant, monotonous, and has to be transacted for the most part with nervous bores. We make his kingdom a treadmill to him, and drive him to and fro on the face of it. Finally, having taken everything else that men prize from him, we fall upon his character, and that of every person to whom he ventures to show favor. We impose enormous expenses on him, stint him, and then rail at his parsimony. We use him as I use those statues--stick him up in the place of honor for our greater convenience in disfiguring and abusing him. We send him forth through our crowded cities, proclaiming that he is the source of all good and evil in the nation, and he, knowing that many people believe it, knowing that it is a lie, and that he is powerless to shorten the working day by one hour, raise wages one penny, or annul the smallest criminal sentence, however unjust it may seem to him; knowing that every miner in the kingdom can manufacture dynamite, and that revolvers are sold for seven and sixpence apiece; knowing that he is not <b>bullet</b> <b>proof,</b> and that every king in Europe has been shot at in the streets; he must smile and bow and maintain an expression of gracious enjoyment whilst the mayor and corporation inflict upon him the twaddling address he has heard a thousand times before. I do not ask you to be loyal, Erskine; but I expect you, in common humanity, to sympathize with the chief figure in the pageant, who is no more accountable for the manifold evils and abominations that exist in his realm than the Lord Mayor is accountable for the thefts of the pickpockets who follow his show on the ninth of November." ...|$|E
