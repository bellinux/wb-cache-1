For tracking mortar shells this was a particularly difficult task, requiring the operator to have the antenna pointed in roughly the right location by estimates based on previous rounds, and then following the shell through its trajectory.

40|$|The {{analysis}} of random samples {{as well as}} the inspection and verification of prototypes, e. g. in aluminium casting industry, demand fast non-destructive testing methods with high geometrical resolution and 3 D imaging capability. X-ray computerized tomography (CT) is specially suited to this and reached increasing importance due to the fast development of system components and software during the last few years. A complete examination of an object with two dimensional computerized tomography (2 D-CT) is very time consuming because all objects slices have to be measured one after each other. In contrast to this three-dimensional computerized tomography (3 D-CT) is able to examine a complete object volume with one single scan. For a 3 D-CT measurement the sample is rotated through 360 ° in the X-ray <b>beam</b> <b>cone</b> at constant height. X-ray source and the two dimensional X-ray detector are stationary. By means of a mathematical reconstruction algorithm the 3 -dimensional distribution of the X-ray absorption coefficient in the object volume is reconstructed from the measured projections taken at different angles. The reconstructed volume of the samples can be inspected using visualisation software. In this presentation the principle of computed tomography is outlined and examples of industrial applications are presented...|$|E
40|$|Laser {{illumination}} {{used in both}} conventional widefield epi-fluorescence as well as {{in total}} internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy is subject to nonuniformities in intensity that obscure true image details. These intensity variations are interference fringes arising from coherent light scattering and diffraction at every surface in the laser light's optical path, including the lenses, mirrors, and coverslip. We present an inexpensive technique for effectively eliminating these interference fringes based upon introduction of the excitation laser beam by oblique through-the-objective incidence coupled with rapid azimuthal rotation of the plane of incidence. Although this rotation can be accomplished in several ways, a particularly simple method applicable to a free laser beam is to use an optical wedge, spun on a motor, which diverts the beam into a hollow cone of fixed angle. A system of lenses converts this collimated <b>beam</b> <b>cone</b> into a focused spot that traces a circle at the objective's back focal plane. Consequently, a collimated beam with fixed polar angle and spinning azimuthal angle illuminates the sample. If the wedge is spun rapidly, then the different interference patterns at every particular azimuthal incidence angle average out over a single camera exposure to produce an effectively uniform field of illumination.

30|$|At PEL, we use two {{instruments}} {{equipped with}} external chambers to measure emissivity. The Bruker Vertex 80  V Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometer is operated under vacuum to remove atmospheric features from the spectra. An external evacuable chamber {{is used to}} measure emissivity: It contains a motor-driven carousel for up to 12 samples in the same working session, thermal sensors for each sample, and a webcam for monitoring the activities inside the chamber. The induction heating system allows heating up the samples (in stainless steel cups) from 50  °C to higher than 800  °C (Helbert et al. 2013). A Bruker A 513 accessory mounted in the same spectrometer is used to obtain bi-conical reflectance with variable incidence angle i and emission angle e between 13 ° and 85 ° at room temperature, under purged (dry air, H 2 O, and CO 2 removed) or vacuum conditions, in the 1 - to 100 -µm spectral range (Maturilli et al. 2014). In the whole spectral range, a gold sandpaper-coated surface is used as reference for reflectance measurements, measured with the same incidence and emission angles as the samples. The incidence <b>beam</b> <b>cone</b> angle is of 17 °, the incidence beam size depends on the incidence angle, and it is however smaller than 10  mm, being the sample cup/reference diameter size for reflectance measurements.|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{consisted of}} a quantitative assessment, and aimed to measure the possible discrepancies between the maxillomandibular positions for centric relation (CR) and maximum intercuspation (MI), using computed tomography volumetric cone <b>beam</b> (<b>cone</b> beam method). The sample of the study consisted of 10 asymptomatic young adult patients divided into two types of standard occlusion: normal occlusion and Angle Class I occlusion.

40|$|Gamma jets (GJ) at MeV {{energies}} may {{be produced}} in galactic halos by Inverse Compton Scattering (ICS) of collinear ultrarelativistic electron beams (at GeV energies) onto thermal photons. These electron jets are emitted by neutron star jets (NSJ) or black holes (BH) while the target thermal photons are generated by a nearby binary stellarlike companion (or by a relic accreting disk). The GJ precesses in a conical shape as a lighthouse (with a characteristic Keplerian binary period) forced by the NSJ magnetic lines interaction with the stellar companion ones. The sudden blazing of the GJ, once the observer is into the <b>beam</b> <b>cone</b> direction, is detected as a GRB. Our predicted GRB spectra fit the GRB observed ones; GRB luminosity, variability and counts are well explained if the GJ sources are located in an ”extended” and an ”evaporating” galactic halo as the one recently required in the fast running away NS model. Observed jets such as SS 433, the Great Annihilator, superluminal sources such as the last GRS 1758 - 258, GRS 1915 + 105 are the ideal candidates for NSJ as well as GJ. The SGRs are the lower energy and wider beamed version of this GJ model so they are linked to classical GRBs. The last mysterious presence of the twin rings near SN 1987 A (as well as the ring traces near NGC 6543) are the spectacular signature of such (double sided) conical jet precession projected onto the red giant relic spherical shell.
