Buckwheat is {{a species}} prone to lodging {{which is one}} of the reasons of {{lowering}} the size of buckwheat seeds yield; the other is never-ending vegetation, which favours uneven seeds maturation and seeds shattering before harvesting. At one-stage harvesting, canopy des-sication of the presently cultivated buckwheat varieties is necessary. Determinate form is characterised by a shorter vegetation period than other cultivated varieties, it loses leaves and dries earlier. Height, diameter, stiffness and energy of cutting stalks of Determinate from was assessed. It was found that the higher is an internode of a stalk the lower is its stiffness. The height of a stalk and its thickness are features which are positively correlated with stiffness and energy of cutting stalks. Energy necessary for cutting stalks decreases along with the plant height and is rather low. Key words: <b>buckwheat,</b> <b>stalk,</b> stiffness, energy of cutting, lodgin...|$|E
