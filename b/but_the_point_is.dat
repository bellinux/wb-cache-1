500|$|SEN. CLINTON: No, I didn't, Chris. <b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>is,</b> {{what are}} we going to do with all these illegal {{immigrants}} who are (driving ?) -- (inaudible)? ...|$|E
500|$|<b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>is,</b> we're {{fighting}} {{the good fight}} ... We're going to trial {{and we want to}} crush them [...] But every time we've gotten close to going to trial, it gets postponed and we've wasted money and time and it has just drained our creative energy. We bought an insurance policy for peace of mind, but instead we {{would have been better off}} if we never had it and just dealt with the original lawsuit.|$|E
500|$|Because {{of these}} influences, musical genres, and Lavigne's {{personal}} style, the media often defined her as punk, something she denied being. Lavigne's {{close friend and}} guitarist, Evan Taubenfeld, said, [...] "It's a very touchy subject {{to a lot of}} people, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> that Avril isn't punk, but she never really pretended to claim to come from that scene. She had pop punk music and the media ended up doing the rest". Lavigne also commented on the matter: [...] "I have been labeled like I'm this angry girl, [...] rebel... punk, and I am so not any of them." [...] Although she stated to have punk influences on her music: [...] "I like to listen a lot to punk rock music, you can notice a certain influence of punk in my music. I like an aggressive music, but pretty enough heavy pop-rock, which is what I really do." ...|$|E
50|$|Professor Wille {{considered}} that creditors' rights took preference over {{those of a}} lessee who was not in occupation, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>was</b> left open in Kessoopersadh v Essop. See also Genna-Wae Properties v Medico-Tronics.|$|R
60|$|<b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>was</b> {{cleared up}} sooner than they expected, for, {{before they reached}} the wharf, a graceful figure was seen to be {{bounding}} through the bushes, apparently in hot pursuit of the dog.|$|R
50|$|Conversely, if both radii <b>are</b> zero (two <b>points)</b> <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>points</b> <b>are</b> distinct, <b>the</b> {{external}} center can <b>be</b> defined as <b>the</b> <b>point</b> at infinity {{corresponding to the}} slope of the line of centers, but there is no well-defined internal center.|$|R
500|$|Greed {{received}} mostly negative reviews. The {{trade paper}} Harrison's Report said that [...] "f a contest {{were to be}} held to determine {{which has been the}} filthiest, vilest, most putrid picture {{in the history of the}} motion picture business, I am sure that Greed would win." [...] Variety Weekly called it [...] "an out-and-out box office flop" [...] only six days after its premiere and claimed that the film had taken two years to shoot, cost $700,000 and was originally 130 reels long. The review went on to say that [...] "nothing more morbid and senseless, from a commercial picture standpoint, has been seen on the screen for a long, long time" [...] and that despite its [...] "excellent acting, fine direction and the undoubted power of its story... it does not entertain." [...] In its December 1924 – January 1925 issue, Exceptional Photoplays called it [...] "one of the most uncompromising films ever shown on the screen. There have already been many criticisms of its brutality, its stark realism, its sordidness. <b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> that it was never intended to be a pleasant picture." [...] In the February 1925 issue of Theatre Magazine, Aileen St. John-Brenon wrote that [...] "the persons in the photoplay are not characters, but types—they are well selected, weighed and completely drilled. But they did not act; they do not come to life. They perform their mission like so many uncouth images of miserliness and repugnant animalism." [...] Mordaunt Hall of the New York Times gave the film a mostly positive review in regards to the acting and directing while criticizing how it was edited, writing that MGM [...] "clipped this production as much as they dared... and are to be congratulated on their efforts and the only pity is that they did not use the scissors more generously in the beginning." [...] In a Life Magazine article, Robert E. Sherwood also defended MGM's cutting of the film and called von Stroheim [...] "a genius... badly in need of a stopwatch." [...] Iris Barry of the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) disliked the tinting, saying [...] "a not very pleasing yellow tinge is smudged in." [...] A March 1925 review in Pictureplay magazine stated, [...] "perhaps an American director would not have seen greed as a vice." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Countess {{arrives in}} Susanna's dress. Cherubino shows up and starts teasing [...] "Susanna" [...] (really the Countess), {{endangering}} the plan. (Finale: Pian pianin le andrò più presso - [...] "Softly, softly I'll approach her") Fortunately, the Count {{gets rid of}} him by striking out in the dark. His punch actually ends up hitting Figaro, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> made and Cherubino runs off.|$|E
2500|$|American {{nativism}} countered {{the immigration}} and assimilation of Poles into the United States. In 1923, Carl Brigham dismissed the Poles as inferior in intelligence. He even defended his assertions against popular support for Kościuszko and Pulaski, well-known Polish heroes from the American Revolution, stating, [...] "careless thinkers [...] select one or two striking examples of ability from a particular group, and [...] that they have overthrown an argument based on the total distribution of ability." [...] Orators [...] "can not alter {{the distribution of the}} intelligence of the Polish immigrant. All countries send men of exceptional ability to America, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> that some send fewer than others." ...|$|E
25|$|Also, with seconds remaining, and Tyrone {{down by a}} <b>point,</b> Russell (who <b>was</b> blidsided) adjudged Canavan to {{have touched}} {{the ball in the}} ground, when he was passing it to team-mate, Sean McLaughlin. McLaughlin put the ball over <b>the</b> bar, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>was</b> not counted.|$|R
25|$|Scopes never testified {{since there}} was never a factual issue as to whether he had taught evolution. Scopes later {{admitted}} that, in reality, he was unsure of whether he had taught evolution (another reason the defense did not want him to testify), <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>was</b> not contested at the trial.|$|R
6000|$|... "Are {{all very}} well for common people. <b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>was,</b> Kemp, that I {{had to get out}} of that house in a {{disguise}} without his seeing me. I couldn't think of any other way of doing it. And then I gagged him with a Louis Quatorze vest and tied him up in a sheet." ...|$|R
2500|$|When {{asked in}} 2014 which leaders he admired, Farage said, [...] "As an operator, {{but not as}} a human being, I would say Putin. The way he played the whole Syria thing. Brilliant. Not that I approve of him politically. How many journalists in jail now?" [...] Farage has criticised {{what he sees as}} EU militarism {{agitating}} western Ukrainians against Russia. Later, in 2015, he said about Putin that [...] "The European Union, and the West, view Putin as the devil. They want to view Putin as the devil. I’m not saying I want take him around for tea and meet mum on Sunday afternoon … <b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>is,</b> on this bigger overall battle [...] we need to start recognizing we’re on the same side".|$|E
2500|$|In early 2004, Kalle Lasn, {{author of}} [...] "Culture Jam" [...] {{and founder of}} Adbusters, two {{influential}} and widely read anti-globalization texts, generated controversy when he wrote an editorial entitled [...] "Why won't anyone say they are Jewish?". In it he stated [...] "Drawing attention to the Jewishness of the neocons is a tricky game. Anyone who does so can count on automatically being smeared as an anti-Semite. <b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> not that Jews (who make up less than 2 percent of the American population) have a monolithic perspective. Indeed, American Jews overwhelmingly vote Democrat {{and many of them}} disagree strongly with Ariel Sharon’s policies and Bush’s aggression in Iraq. The point is simply that the neocons seem to have a special affinity for Israel that influences their political thinking and consequently American foreign policy in the Middle East." [...] The editorial suggested that Jews represent a disproportionately high percentage of the neo-conservatives who control American foreign policy, and that this may affect policy with respect to Israel. Lasn included a list of influential neo-conservatives, with dots next to the names of those who were Jewish.|$|E
2500|$|The terms {{electronic}} health records, {{personal health}} records, and patient portals {{are not always}} used correctly. [...] The generally agreed upon definition of these terms relates mainly to the ownership of the data. Once data is in a PHR it usually owned and controlled by the patient. Most EHRs, however, are {{the property of the}} provider, although the content can be co-created by both the provider and patient. [...] A patient has a legal right in most states to request their healthcare data and under recent USA legislation those providers using a certified EHR will be required to provide an electronic copy as well. In the UK, according to the governments's information strategy for the NHS every primary care practice in England will have to offer patients online access to their care records by 2015. In 2012, only 1% did so. Electronic health records and electronic medical records contain clinical data created by and for health professionals in the course of providing care. [...] The data is about the patient but the data resides in a health care provider's system. [...] The patient portal is typically defined as a view into the electronic medical records. [...] In addition, ancillary functions that support a health care provider's interaction with a patient are also found in those systems e.g. prescription refill requests, appointment requests, electronic case management, etc. [...] Finally, PHRs are data that resides with the patient, in a system of the patient's choosing. [...] This data may have been exported directly from an EMR, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> it now resides in a location of the patient's choosing. [...] Access to that information is controlled entirely by the patient.|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] he said, [...] "it wasn't any fancy <b>points.</b> They <b>was</b> {{just plain}} ostriches. A little off colour, too--owing to dietary. And there wasn't any {{particular}} restriction {{of the demand}} either. You'd have thought five ostriches would have ruled cheap on an East Indiaman. <b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>was,</b> one of 'em had swallowed a diamond.|$|R
50|$|The lever frame at Stockport Junction was {{equipped}} with electro-pneumatic slides instead of levers, with electrical economising contacts located above them. The signalman wanted to cross a freight train travelling {{in the opposite direction}} behind <b>the</b> passenger train, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>points</b> <b>were</b> locked by a track circuit until the passenger train was well clear of them.|$|R
5000|$|Allen <b>Point</b> (...) <b>is</b> <b>the</b> {{southeast}} <b>point</b> of Montagu Island, in the South Sandwich Islands. Montagu Island {{was discovered}} in 1775 by a British expedition under James Cook, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>was</b> first mapped by Fabian Gottlieb von Bellingshausen in 1819-20. <b>The</b> <b>point</b> <b>was</b> surveyed in 1930 by Discovery Investigations personnel on the Discovery II and named for H.T. Allen, {{a member of the}} Discovery Committee.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Awfully. <b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> {{that now}} he's gone I {{can tell you}} about that M.C.C. match affair. I know you want to hear what really did happen that afternoon.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course," [...] said Mrs. Lyddell, [...] "any {{one else}} would rejoice to be asked; <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>is,</b> {{that it is so}} {{unpleasant}} to admit any thing of a stranger into the intimacy these things occasion." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll admit that, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> here: as {{an artist}} you can't afford to dispose of a race on the {{testimony}} of their hereditary enemies. You wouldn't expect a sympathetic study of the Greek by the Saracen, would you?" ...|$|E
5000|$|Overall, {{very little}} is known about <b>the</b> Canna viruses, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> {{following}} <b>points</b> <b>are</b> generally accepted: ...|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: [...] The same {{interpolation}} as in <b>the</b> first figure, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>points</b> to <b>be</b> interpolated are scaled by 100 ...|$|R
5000|$|According to {{the book}} Wes Craven: The Art of Horror by John Kenneth Muir, Craven's {{original}} cut of the film was [...] "a teenage film filled with charm, wit, and solid performances by likeable teens Swanson and Laborteaux. It was definitely a mainstream, PG film all the way, similar in tone to Real Genius or Short Circuit, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>was</b> made that Craven could direct something other than double-barreled horror." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'It is not that,' said Arthur, turning gratefully to his father. 'I {{should be}} glad {{to give up the}} army and live at home--there is nothing I should like better; <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>is,</b> that I must know what Violet thinks of it.' ...|$|E
60|$|MORE. We {{shall not}} agree there, Shelder; {{and we might}} argue it all day. <b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>is,</b> not whether you or I are right--the point is: What {{is a man who}} holds a faith with all his heart to do? Please tell me.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nay, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> to {{get back}} his money for him," [...] said Ursula, [...] "which he {{is not likely to}} see on other conditions. Could you not ask leave to go down to your uncle in Essex for two or three days? He may be ill, you know." ...|$|E
50|$|The {{solution}} of the Apollonius problem {{has been known for}} centuries. <b>But</b> <b>the</b> Apollonius <b>point</b> <b>was</b> first noted in 1987.|$|R
50|$|A second {{application}} is Pappus's hexagon theorem, similar to <b>the</b> above, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> six <b>points</b> <b>are</b> on two lines {{instead of on}} a conic.|$|R
5000|$|Epitrochoid: As {{epicycloid}} <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> {{need not}} <b>be</b> {{on the edge}} of its circle.|$|R
6000|$|... "O, I'll do {{that part}} of it," [...] {{interrupted}} Michael, [...] "you have no experience. <b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> this: If--or rather since--you know nothing of the crime, since the--the party in the closet--is neither your father, nor your brother, nor your creditor, nor your mother-in-law, nor what they call an injured husband----" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I daresay it was," [...] he returned, {{with the}} same steadiness. [...] "It seemed to me pertinent; and, besides, when you ask me for money upon no security, you treat me with the liberty of a friend, and it's to be presumed that I can do the like. <b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>is,</b> do you accept?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Now {{since the}} card question, {{everything}} I said or did {{had the power}} of annoying Cluny. [...] "Your name has more sense than yourself, then," [...] said he angrily, [...] "for it's good Gaelic. <b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> this. My scout reports all clear in the south, and the question is, have ye the strength to go?" ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{total amount}} of money that Pyne gave to Princeton, {{including}} the University, its students, faculty, and related institutions, is truly incalculable. “The extent of his financial aid to Princeton has never been disclosed. It was known to <b>be</b> very large <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>was</b> one which he never cared to discuss.” [...] He poured an untold amount of money into the general fund, and while Pyne never disclosed how much, “it is known...that for several years he drew his own check to cover the deficit in the university budget.” [...] According to the Princeton Alumni Weekly: ...|$|R
50|$|In the All-Ireland Final against Dublin, Tyrone took {{an early}} lead, {{just as they}} had in 1986, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> Dubs fought back, and ended up winning the match by a single point, 1-10 to 0-12. Peter Canavan had scored eleven points that day, but still ended up on the losing side. Tyrone fans {{remember}} the final with bitter taste, due to a controversial decision by referee Paddy Russell. With seconds remaining, and Tyrone down by a point, Russell adjudged Canavan to have touched the ball in the ground, when he was passing it to team-mate Sean McLaughlin. McLaughlin put the ball over <b>the</b> bar, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>was</b> not counted.|$|R
6000|$|... “It {{came out}} that she had only a little rock ballast in her,” Bethune explained. “There {{may not have been}} enough to pin her down; <b>but</b> <b>the</b> {{important}} <b>point</b> <b>is</b> that <b>the</b> strong-room was aft, and Hank says that part is sound.” ...|$|R
