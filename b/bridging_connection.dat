This {{is the only way}} to maximize energy efficiency, and so it is used at the beginning of electrical power lines. Such an impedance <b>bridging</b> <b>connection</b> also minimizes distortion and electromagnetic interference; it is also used in modern audio amplifiers and signal-processing devices.|$|E
5000|$|In electronics, {{especially}} {{audio and}} sound recording, a high impedance bridging, voltage bridging, or simply <b>bridging</b> <b>connection</b> {{is one in}} which the load impedance is much larger than the source impedance. [...] In cases where only the load impedance can be varied, maximizing the load impedance serves to both minimize the current drawn by the load and maximize the voltage signal across load. Essentially, the load is measuring the source's voltage without affecting it. In cases where only the source impedance can be varied, minimizing the source impedance serves to maximize the power delivered to the load. A different configuration is an impedance matching connection in which the source and load impedances are either equal or complex conjugates. Such a configuration serves to either prevent reflections when transmission lines are involved, or to maximize power delivered to the load given an unchangeable source impedance.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} impact of the ionic {{environment}} on the charge of colloidal natural organic matter (NOM) and ultrafiltration (UF) membranes (charge screening effect) and the calcium adsorption/bridging on new and fouled membranes (calcium bridging effect) by measuring the zeta potentials of membranes and colloidal NOM. Fouling experiments were conducted with natural water to determine whether the reduction of the charge screening effect and/or calcium bridging effect by backwashing with demineralized water can explain the observed reduction in fouling. Results show that the charge of both membranes and NOM, as measured by the zeta potential, became more negative at a lower pH and a lower concentration of electrolytes, in particular, divalent electrolytes. In addition, calcium also adsorbed onto the membranes, and consequently bridged colloidal NOM and membranes via binding with functional groups. The charge screening effect could be eliminated by flushing NOM and membranes with demineralized water, since a cation-free environment was established. However, only a limited amount of the calcium <b>bridging</b> <b>connection</b> was removed with demineralized water backwashes, so the calcium bridging effect mostly could not be eliminated. As demineralized water backwash was found to be effective in fouling control, it can be concluded that the reduction of the charge screening is the dominant mechanism for this. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd...|$|E
40|$|Poly(fluorene-alt-thiophene) (PFT) is a {{conjugated}} polyelectrolyte that self-assembles into rod-like micelles in water, {{with the}} conjugated polymer backbone {{running along the}} length of the micelle. At modest concentrations (∼ 10 mg/mL in aqueous solutions), PFT forms hydrogels, and this work focuses on understanding the structure and intermolecular interactions in those gel networks. The network structure can be directly visualized using cryo electron microscopy. Oscillatory rheology studies further tell us about connectivity within the gel network, and the data are consistent with a picture where polymer chains bridge between micelles to hold the network together. Addition of tetrahydrofuran (THF) to the gels breaks those connections, but once the THF is removed, the gel becomes stronger than it was before, presumably due to the creation of a more interconnected nanoscale architecture. Small polymer oligomers can also passivate the bridging polymer chains, breaking connections between micelles and dramatically weakening the hydrogel network. Fits to solution-phase small-angle X-ray scattering data using a Dammin bead model support the hypothesis of a <b>bridging</b> <b>connection</b> between PFT micelles, even in dilute aqueous solutions. Finally, time-resolved microwave conductivity measurements on dried samples show an increase in carrier mobility after THF annealing of the PFT gel, likely due to increased connectivity within the polymer network. 10 page(s...|$|E
40|$|The UK National Ecosystem Assessment, {{the largest}} scale {{ecosystem}} valuation project undertaken at national scale, {{is the result}} of combined efforts by natural scientists, economists and other social scientists from policy, academic, private sector and non-governmental organization. It is an important case study in understanding the processes, characteristics and barriers at play in interdisciplinary research in the UK. To date, measurement of interdisciplinarity has been restricted to bibiometric analysis. In this dissertation I use web-based survey responses to measure ‘interdisciplinary’ project success through the behaviour of its authors. In addition, I analyse the importance of social capital characteristics arising from ‘interdisciplinary’ projects. I argue that analysis of project success must include post-hoc assessment of research impact, especially at the level of policy uptake. I posit that the tools used to measure disciplinary integration, in particular measurement of social capital in the form of <b>bridging</b> <b>connection,</b> can be used to measure policy impact. I find that the National Ecosystem Assessment is best categorized as ‘interdisciplinary’ rather than ‘transdisciplinary’, following Gibbons et al. mode 2 knowledge. I argue that in many cases ‘transdisciplinary’ research may introduce complexities that reduce policy interpretability and uptake. Finally, I present a tentative attempt at a meso-level measurement of knowledge sharing networks between individual project authors as a means of measuring social capital impacts on policy uptake...|$|E

The main task is to check a fulfilment of voltage tolerance in distribution substations 110 kV, load transformer control (400 / 110 kV, 110 /VN kV), distribution power line 110 kV control and short - circuit conditions control. Relevant calculations are performed by dispatching control system, which works with the actual parameters of all distribution network‘s 110 kV facilities. The theoretical part of this thesis {{is devoted to the}} way of the calculation of stabilized operation and the short-circuit conditions. In practical part, first we perform an analyse of stabilized operation and the short-circuit conditions of distribution network 110 kV in actual operation. Next step deals with <b>bridge</b> <b>connection</b> design and analysing its operation. The operation of <b>bridge</b> <b>connection</b> is verificated even in specific conditions (disturbance state, increased load). The next section evaluates the results of the calculations.

Finally, we evaluate the losses in the distribution network 110 kV.
