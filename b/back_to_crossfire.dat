5000|$|Stewart {{discussed}} the incident on The Daily Show the following Monday: We {{decided to go}} <b>to</b> this place, <b>Crossfire,</b> which is a nuanced public policy analysis show… named after the stray bullets that hit innocent bystanders in a gang fight. So I go <b>to</b> <b>Crossfire</b> and, let's face it, I was dehydrated, it's the Martin Lawrence defense… and I had always in the past mentioned to friends and people that I meet on the street that I think that show… um… blows. So I thought {{it was only the}} right thing to do to go say it to them personally on their program, but here's the thing about confronting someone with that on their show: They're there! Uncomfortable! And they were very mad, because apparently, when you invite someone on a show called Crossfire and you express an opinion, they don't care for that… I told them that I felt their show was hurting America and they came back at me pretty good, they said that I wasn't being funny. And I said to them, [...] "I know that, but tomorrow I will go <b>back</b> <b>to</b> being funny, and your show will still blow." ...|$|R

50|$|As {{the rest}} of the French army {{streamed}} away, Ferey formed his division into a single three-deep line, with each flank covered by a battalion in square. Led by Clinton's victorious 6th Division, the British came up to this formation and were initially repulsed. After ordering his artillery <b>to</b> <b>crossfire</b> through the centre of the French line, Wellington ordered a second assault. This attack broke Ferey's division and killed its commander.|$|R
50|$|At 2.15, as {{the right}} horn made its withdrawal, the left horn and centre surged {{up out of the}} ravine, their leading warriors falling <b>to</b> <b>crossfire</b> from the laager and kraal as they came over the crest. However, more and more swarmed on to the glacis between the cliff and the defenders, {{funnelling}} into the gap between the kraal and laager. The Zulus soon forced their way into the cattle Kraal and fought hand-to-hand with men of the 1/13th company. The cattle in the kraal hampered both sides, but with Zulu pressure mounting up the heavily outnumbered British troops managed to extricate themselves and pull <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the redoubt. Zulu riflemen were now able to open fire from behind the walls of the kraal to give their advancing comrades cover. At about this time the right horn came on again from the north-east, charging across the north face of the redoubt towards the guns and the eastern sides of the laager.|$|R
50|$|The Ringleader and the Healey {{brothers}} (Oddball and Tenpin) {{came together}} to form the juggling-themed supervillain group, the Death-Throws. Knickknack was later recruited as the fourth member of the group. Oddball, given to his eccentric behaviour, quit the Death-Throws and branched out on his own. Oddball was hired, along with Bombshell, by <b>Crossfire</b> <b>to</b> battle Hawkeye and Mockingbird. The two supervillains subdued the heroes and delivered them <b>to</b> <b>Crossfire.</b> Later, when Hawkeye had managed to escape, Bombshell, Oddball and Crossfire were defeated and {{handed over to the}} authorities. Bombshell and Oddball were broken out of prison by Oddball's brother, Tenpin, and became members of the Death-Throws.|$|R

Hot zones are not good places to appear {{as a member of}} either of the opposing teams, because one may be prone to attacks or capture. Although war zones may have the most targeted attacks, crime ridden neighborhoods are the most common areas for <b>crossfire</b> <b>to</b> occur, and subsequently the most victims of crossfire are here.|$|R

50|$|As of July 2015, {{there is}} an ongoing {{controversy}} between several youth soccer clubs and the United States Soccer Federation (U.S. Soccer) over this issue. When Major League Soccer's Seattle Sounders sold the rights to DeAndre Yedlin to Tottenham Hotspur for US$4 million, a Seattle-area youth club for which Yedlin had played, Crossfire Premier, sought its share of solidarity payments. While Spurs acknowledged Crossfire's claim, MLS and U.S. Soccer intercepted the funds before they could be sent <b>to</b> <b>Crossfire,</b> claiming that the sealed ruling in a 1996 antitrust case gave MLS exclusive rights to all transfer fees involving league players. Crossfire has since petitioned FIFA to either force payment or allow the club to sue MLS and U.S. Soccer; several other youth clubs have since joined in Crossfire's request, including one of Clint Dempsey's previous clubs.|$|R
