40|$|This {{project is}} one {{of the results of the}} multi-year {{collaboration}} in coastal and marine sustainable management, planning and policy between the General Directorate for Nature and Sea Protection of the Italian Ministry for the Environment, Land and Sea and the CITERA Research Centre (Centro Interdisciplinare Territorio, Edilizia, Restauro, Ambiente) of the Sapienza University of Rome. The main objective of the project was to analyze the parameters involved in preparedness, prevention and response actions required by the Italian Ministry for the setting up of an Oil Spill Contingency Plan. Due to its critical anthropic impacts and its huge environmental heritage in terms of biodiversity richness and coastal geomorphological variety, the Eastern Sicily coastline, bounded by the geographic vertices of Cape Peloro and Cape Passero, has been chosen as the study area. Moreover this area is characterized by significant economic activities such as fishing and tourist industries. One of the major aims of the study was to rank coastal areas on the basis of their sensitivity to an unforeseen oil spill. Physical, geomorphological, biological and environmental attributes have been gathered using remote sensing techniques and field works, and they have been subsequently elaborated for the valuation of oil spill environmental sensitivity indices (ESI). In addition to ESI values, the elaborated maps contain other important information like landscaping and environmental constraints, human-use resources, archaeological and historical sites, and marine <b>benthic</b> <b>biocenosis.</b> In order to achieve the tasks and draw up the maps, the whole data set has been reported in a Geographical Information System (GIS) database. The obtained results include operational maps representing useful tools for local stakeholders and practical guidelines for the elaboration of a regional oil spill contingency plan. © 2011 WIT Press...|$|E
40|$|Features of {{seaweeds}} in the Arctic {{communities in}} connection with periodic and unperiodic influences of ecological factors have been analyzed. It {{has been shown that}} the existence of <b>benthic</b> algae <b>biocenosis</b> of the northern seas is mainly controlled by the primary periodic environmental factors acting as triggers that determine the direction of vegetative and generative processes, as well as contribute to the emergence of adaptive devices to extreme environmental conditions. Therefore, periodic exposure to environmental factors cause only structural changes in plant communities due to the elastic stability of fucus algae populations acquired {{as a result of the}} long process of adaptation to the northern seas conditions. Unperiodic primary factors also violate the ratio of the number by elimination and inhibit growth of certain algae age stages. However thanks to the stability of resistant the algae community can eventually restore its structural and functional organization...|$|R

Their community structure provides useful {{information on the}} general characteristics of the environment quality and some species are sensitive to specific environmental parameters (e. g., ALVE, 1991, 1995; YANKO et alii, 1994, 2002; COCCIONI, 2000; SAMIR, 2000; DEBENAY et alii, 2001, 2005; GESLIN et alii, 2002; COCCIONI et alii, 2003, 2005; ARMYNOT DU CHÂTELET et alii, 2004; COCCIONI & MARSILI, 2005; FRONTALINI & COCCIONI, 2008). The lagoon of Santa Gilla, on an area of about 13 km 2, {{is located on the}} southern coast of Sardinia (Italy) and communicates with the Mediterranean through a narrow channel. On the northern shore, the lagoon has two major freshwater inflows from the Rii Mannu and Cixerri rivers. On the west, the on-shore industrial area and the urban area of Cagliari discharged untreated wastewater from the mid- 1960 s to mid- 1980 s (DEGETTO et alii, 1997). Sediment samples were collected from 18 stations during October 2006. Physicochemical data of water, geochemical, sedimentological, and <b>benthic</b> foraminiferal data (<b>biocenosis</b> and trace element contents in foraminiferal tests) have been analyzed to investigate the relationship between these sensitive microrganisms and trace element pollution. The analysis of sediments indicated that the lagoon is deeply affected by trace element pollution (Cd, Ni, Pb, Zn and Hg). The biocenosis of the lagoon are largely dominated by Ammonia tepida, Haynesina germanica and Cribroelphidium oceanensis and, subordinately, by bolivinids. Foraminiferal species and trace element concentrations were investigated both with bivariate (correlation matrix) and multivariate techniques of principal component analysis (PCA) and cluster analysis. Statistical analysis shows a possible control of these pollutants both on the taxonomic composition of the benthic foraminiferal assemblages and the development of test malformations which is used as additional tool for the pollution monitoring. This study confirms and supports the suitability of studying benthic foraminifera as a technique for the in situ continuous bio-monitoring of trace element pollution of coastal marine sediments. This study was carried out {{within the framework of the}} ForamLag Project aimed at studying the response of benthic foraminifera to contaminants in the main Italian lagoons...|$|R
