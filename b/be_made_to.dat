On April 8, Gen. Creighton Abrams was briefed on the high losses in the several failed attempts to rescue Hambleton and Clark. He ordered that no further air CSAR would be attempted, but that given Hambleton's Top Secret clearance and knowledge of missiles and counter-measure technology, that every effort should <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>to</b> bring him out.|$|E
5|$|After {{the end of}} the 747X program, Boeing {{continued}} to study improvements that could <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>to</b> the 747. The 747-400XQLR (Quiet Long Range) was meant to have an increased range of 7,980nmi (9,200mi, 14,800km), with improvements to boost efficiency and reduce noise. Improvements studied included raked wingtips similar to those used on the 767-400ER and a sawtooth engine nacelle for noise reduction. Although the 747-400XQLR did not move to production, many of its features were used for the 747 Advanced, which has now been launched as the 747-8.|$|E
50|$|Although plans <b>were</b> <b>made</b> <b>to</b> {{convert the}} earlier P.111 to the P.120 configuration, a {{decision}} <b>was</b> <b>made</b> <b>to</b> suspend further development, making the P.120 the last Boulton Paul design to fly.|$|R

Moderately emissions intensive activities will receive allocations equal to 60% of the industry average for the financial years ending 2007, 2008 and 2009. Highly emissions intensive industries will receive allocations equal to 90% of the industry average for this period. Allocation per unit of output will decrease by 1.3% per year from 2013 (on an exponential basis rather than a summation basis).|$|E
5|$|By 1869 Calcraft's mother, Sarah, {{was living}} as a pauper in a workhouse at Hatfield Peverel near Chelmsford. Calcraft was ordered to pay 3shillings a week towards her upkeep, to which he objected, arguing that his brother and sister should <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>to</b> help, {{and that he had}} three {{children}} of his own to support, although there is no record of his marriage.|$|E

5|$|Dynamic DNA {{nanotechnology}} {{focuses on}} forming nucleic acid systems with designed dynamic functionalities {{related to their}} overall structures, such as computation and mechanical motion. There is some overlap between structural and dynamic DNA nanotechnology, as structures can be formed through annealing and then reconfigured dynamically, or can <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>to</b> form dynamically in the first place.|$|E
5|$|Einstein {{argued that}} {{this is true for}} {{fundamental}} reasons, because the gravitational field could <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>to</b> vanish by a choice of coordinates. He maintained that the non-covariant energy momentum pseudotensor was in fact the best description of the energy momentum distribution in a gravitational field. This approach has been echoed by Lev Landau and Evgeny Lifshitz, and others, and has become standard.|$|E

However, around the same time, Crown Prince Taufa'ahau Tupou IV returned from a trip to Australia where he realized that some changes should <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>to</b> the written Tongan language. Morton began working on a revised draft, but felt unacquainted with Tongan grammar. For a year, he studied the language and finally completely his revision on March 15, 1945. The Tongan version of the Book of Mormon was published in April 1946.|$|E

5|$|Neither Shepard nor Lovell {{expected}} {{there would}} be much difference between Apollo 13 and Apollo 14, but Apollo 13 went disastrously wrong. An oxygen tank explosion nearly resulted {{in the loss of}} the crew, and the moon landing was aborted. It became a joke between Shepard and Lovell, who would offer to give Shepard back the mission each time they bumped into each other. The failure of Apollo 13 delayed Apollo 14 until 1971 so that modifications could <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>to</b> the spacecraft. The target of the Apollo 14 mission was switched to the Fra Mauro formation, the intended destination of Apollo 13.|$|E

5|$|Oslo Sporveier {{was highly}} {{satisfied}} with the SL79 articulated trams that had been delivered during the 1980s.

The new stock was considered to be a limited trial. If it met performance expectations, future orders could <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>to</b> replace the T1000 stock when the latter reached the end of its economical life in around 2000. The required specification for the new train was published in October 1988.|$|E
