For this reason, a model has been studied in order to quantify the variation of temperature in bituminous concrete road and airfield pavements, in relation to the climatic conditions. The model developed gives the temperature profile in the pavement (mono-layer as well as multi-layer schematised) at depth at any hour of the day or day of the year, starting from a few climatic parameters that are very easy to obtain: air temperature, solar irradiance at ground level; wind speed next to the pavement. It also considers cloud cover as well as the radiation thermal exchange between the pavement and the air. The temperature of the pavement surfacing can be unknown. The model demonstrated that the pavement schematisation is not so important in the analysis while the heat transmission is unidirectional. Its application is possible whatever the type of flexible pavement and geographical location. After calibrating the model on the basis of data available in the literature (from America and Asia), a field investigation has been carried out in airfields, because airfield pavements are usually formed by much thicker <b>bituminous</b> <b>layers</b> than road pavements.

The influences of confinement and load frequency have been studied. Tests have highlighted that confinement notably decreases the strain rate as well as the level of strain reached {{at the end of the}} test. The tests did not allow to clearly observe the influence of frequency on the response of the material, due to problems of repeatability. In order to avoid such problems, another test procedure was adopted. It consisted in changing either confinement or frequency during the test, with the purpose to see an evolution of strain rate, and to establish correlations. These tests have clearly shown the influence of cyclic loading and the relative influence of loading frequency on the response of asphalt concrete.

40|$|The {{interlayer}} bonding {{of modern}} multi-layered pavement system {{plays an important}} role to achieve long term performance of a flexible pavement. It has been observed that poor bonding between <b>bituminous</b> pavement <b>layers</b> contributes to major pavement overlay distresses such as premature fatigue, top down cracking, potholes, and surface layer delamination. One of the most common distresses due to poor bonding between <b>bituminous</b> <b>layers</b> is a slippage failure, which usually occurs where heavy vehicles are often accelerating, decelerating, or turning. To enhance the bonding between layers, a tack coat is sprayed in between the <b>bituminous</b> pavement <b>layers.</b> A tack coat is an application of a bituminous emulsion or bituminous binder between an existing bituminous / concrete surface and a newly constructed bituminous overlay. Normally, hot bituminous binders, cutback bitumens or bituminous emulsions are used as tack coat materials. This study is aimed to evaluate the bond strength at the interface between pavement layers by performing laboratory tests. To carry out this objective, three special attachments are fabricated for use in Marshall Loading Frame for finding the performance of tack coat laid at the interface between Bituminous Concrete (BC) and Dense <b>Bituminous</b> Macadam (DBM) <b>layers</b> in the laboratory.

40|$|ABSTRACTIt is {{a common}} {{practice}} to apply a tack coat usually {{in the form of}} bituminous emulsion over an existing bituminous surface before laying another <b>bituminous</b> <b>layer.</b> The boundary between these two consecutive bituminous layers is the layer interface and the pavement stress distribution is highly influenced by the adhesion conditions at this interface.

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Reflective cracking {{is one of the more}} serious distresses associated with existing hot mix asphalt (HMA) or portland concrete cement (PCC) pavements overlaid with a thin <b>bituminous</b> <b>layer.</b> This phenomenon is commonly defined as the propagation of cracks from the movement of the underlying pavement or base course into and through the newly placed <b>bituminous</b> <b>layer</b> as a result of load-induced and/or temperature-induced stresses. Preventive maintenance techniques have included incorporating geosynthetic materials, defined herein as grids, fabrics, or composites, into the pavement structure. These materials have had varying success and their use within agencies have been based primarily on local experience or a willingness to try a product that appears to have merit. The objective of this research was to develop information that would aid in the evaluation of the relative effectiveness of commercially available geosynthetic materials in reducing the severity or delaying the appearance of reflective cracking in HMA overlays. To accomplish this objective, laboratory specimens were fabricated and tested to failure using a fatigue-testing machine called the TTI Overlay Tester. This investigation used elementary engineering fracture mechanics concepts as well as the elastic-viscoelastic correspondence principle and the theory of nonlinear viscoelasticity as analytical methods of characterizing the nonlinear viscoelastic response of HMA materials to time-dependent loads. Pseudo displacement equations were developed that, when plotted against measured loads from the TTI Overlay Tester, were used to calculate the pseudo J-Integral. A modified version of Paris' Law was then used to back-calculate the crack propagation properties of the HMA material. By considering the effects of the geosynthetic products on the loading and unloading paths of the HMA specimens, the reinforcing factor, R, was developed. The crack speed index was developed to summarize the complex interactions of the material properties and used to compare the relative effectiveness of each geosynthetic material. Design equations were developed between the fracture properties of the geosynthetic-mixture system and the relaxation modulus properties of the HMA. These equations can be used in forward calculating design methods to predict the rate of crack growth and support the design of an HMA overlay to resist reflective cracking...|$|E

In such research, strains due to traffic loads — calculated by pavement modeling based on linear elastic theory — are used for the evaluation of the life duration of the pavement. Real traffic loads on pavement vary significantly according to their intensity as well as their application modes. Our work aims to evaluate the relevance of the simplifying assumptions used in modeling to determine which parameters used in the description of traffic loads have more influence on the strains in flexible pavements. The study is chiefly based on experimental data. Strain measurements were made on several road structures, varying the main parameters of traffic loads, i. e. load intensity, inflation pressure of the tires and type of wheels. These measurements were carried out at various temperatures. Two structures featuring contrasted rigidities were modeled according to the French design method for flexible pavement. The horizontal strains exerted on these structures were studied at two depths : the bottom of the base course and the bottom of the wearing course. Then, experimental data were systematically compared with the modeling results. Strains {{at the bottom of the}} base course were both analyzed related to their maximal value — which corresponds to one of the design criteria used in mechanistic empirical methods — and as signals corresponding to the strain recordings in one given point during the passage of a traffic load. Analysis of maximal values allowed an evaluation of the influence of the studied load parameters and lead on to solutions to include them in calculations for equivalent traffic. The study of strain signals resulted in the definition of values allowing to express strain variations in function of time. The said values apply principally to notions like strain rates and the definition of frequencies that will best model strain variation in time with a sinusoidal curve. Such frequencies are obtained by decompositions in Fourier series. A relation between load speed and frequency has been defined. At the bottom of the wearing course, the study focused on strain signals only, with strange variations — which have been called "irregularities" — appearing in the horizontal strains at low depth. The scrutiny of these irregularities showed that bituminous materials located near to the road surface of flexible pavements are paradoxically more stressed horizontally than vertically. A situation that tends to link the behavior of <b>bituminous</b> <b>layers</b> in flexible pavements to the performance of a slam structure. Analysis of strain signals was supplemented by linear viscoelastic modeling based on Huet's model. If introducing the viscoelastic behavior of the <b>bituminous</b> <b>layers</b> showed no notable improvement in the quality of modeling, it nevertheless highlighted the necessity to model the pavement structure as a whole. Stress analysis underlined the effects of interactions between layers following different patterns of behavior and the importance of the interface conditions between these layers.

The road sector provides connectivity of the growing cities and villages with the developed cities. For the road sector it costs minimum about a crores rupee for construction and maintaining a section of one kilometer road during its life span.

One of the problems in our country is to have quality roads in cities and villages to have better connectivity. Some of the villages have no roads and for that the inefficiency of the system prevailing including the engineers is blamed. The growing scarcity of natural aggregates, due to banning of quarries, leading to slowing down the rate of road construction is also a problem. An alternate for this problem is Coal Mixed Reject. The coal from coal mines is supplied to the thermal power plants for electricity production which contains both coal and stones.

In order to determine the loading protocols of this machine, the results of the full scale test are compared to numerical calculations made with the 3 D FEM software of the LCPC(CESAR) ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn {{the current}} {{practice}} of flexible pavement design as per Indian Roads Congress (IRC), {{the influence of}} cyclic change in pavement temperature, traffic speed and aging on the material behaviour has not been considered. However, these factors influences the behavior of bituminous mixture and hence the pavement thickness. In this investigation, the influence of temperature, vehicle speed and aging on the dynamic modulus of the bituminous mixture was considered and an IRC pavement cross section was analyzed using AASHTOWARE pavement ME design software. The traffic data required for the design was collected from an existing National Highway and weather data used corresponds to Chennai city. For material characterization, two types of bituminous mixture sample were fabricated in the laboratory satisfying the Bituminous Concrete grade- 2 (BC- 2) and Dense Bituminous Macadam grade (DBM) specification of the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways, India. The dynamic modulus of these samples were measured at frequencies ranging from 0. 01 to 25 Hz at temperatures ranging from 5 to 55 °C and the mater curve was constructed and used in the pavement design. It was found {{that most of the}} cross-sections failed to satisfy the design requirements when subjected to rigorous analysis, design and proof- checking. For a target life of 8 years, the required thickness of the <b>bituminous</b> <b>layer</b> was worked out and the thickness was found to be considerably high when compared to the existing thickness as proposed in the IRC guidelines...|$|E
40|$|The {{choice of}} the most {{appropriate}} functional and structural rehabilitation technique for damaged road pavements obviously mainly depends {{on the type of}} surface degradation. The most common rehabilitation technique for flexible pavements deals with the resurfacing of the degraded wearing course by means of a <b>bituminous</b> <b>layer,</b> when it can't be completely replaced by similar mixtures. Nevertheless, maintenance of degraded flexible pavements can be carried out resorting to a different procedure, which is rarely used in Italy, although it is quite popular abroad: Ultra-Thin Whitetopping (UTW). It involves the damaged pavement being resurfaced with small thin cement concrete slabs. The interaction between the existing bituminous pavement and concrete layer generates a monolithic system, the performance of which is conditioned by various parameters: the volume of vehicular traffic, environmental conditions, the thickness of cement and bituminous concrete layers, the distance between joints, the adhesion between layers and maintenance technique. The paper describes the results of an Italian application of this technique. The experiments regarded the identification and characterization of the existing bituminous pavements (through cores and bearing capacity tests), the design of the UTW, the cement concrete mix design (PP and SB fibres were added to the mixture to enhance compressive strength and elasticity), the mechanical characterization of the new layer (by means of compressive strength and dynamic modulus), the construction of joints, the execution of loading tests on the slabs and measurement of longitudinal, transversal and vertical deflections by strain gauges and LVDTs. The study emphasizes the effectiveness of the maintenance technique. The UTW ensures a good bearing capacity to the pavement, thanks to high values of compressive strength and elastic modulus of the concrete, according to future traffic needs. Moreover, deflections are rather limited. Adequate functional properties (evenness, skid resistance) are also guaranteed...|$|E
40|$|A {{bituminous}} pavement is a multi-layered structure generally {{made up of}} surfacing, base and sub base courses on a sub grade. An interface {{is said to be}} a boundary between any two consecutive layers. So an adequate bond between the layers at the interfaces must be ensured so that multiple layers perform as a single composite structure. In case of non-bituminous layers or bituminous-non bituminous layers, adequate bond is established as such due to the mechanical interlocking between the aggregate surfaces. To increase the adhesion or bonding between two bituminous layers, bituminous tack coats are applied prior to overlay. This study is an attempt to evaluate the interface bond strength between two types of <b>bituminous</b> <b>layer</b> combinations in the laboratory. The cylindrical specimens have been tested for bond strength at four normal service temperatures, namely 250, 300, 350 and 400 C by applying different types of tack coat at varying application rates. Two types of layer combinations have been tried, namely (i) Bituminous Concrete (BC) layer on Dense Bituminous Macadam (DBM) samples and (ii) Semi Dense Bituminous Concrete (SDBC) layer on Bituminous Macadam (BM) samples. Similarly, different types of tack coat materials namely bitumen, Cationic Rapid Setting with low viscosity (CRS- 1) and Cationic Medium Setting with high viscosity (CMS- 2) emulsions have been used for the interface bond between the said bituminous layers. The samples thus prepared have then been tested on a specially fabricated attachment (named bond strength device) fixed to the loading frame of the Modified Marshall Testing Apparatus. It is observed that the interlayer bond strength depends on the test temperature and this decreases with increase in test temperature. It is also observed that the bond strength depends on the type of tack coat used and conditions of the type of combinations. The optimum amount of tack coat has been found to vary for tack coat type and layer combination type...|$|E
40|$|Unbound {{granular}} {{materials used}} in untreated base/sub-base layers, exhibit nonlinear behavior under repeated wheel loads. The properties of the granular materials {{play a significant role}} in the performance of these pavements. Therefore, accurate modelling of the granular layers is essential in the evaluation of critical pavement responses under the application of loads, these materials exhibit stress dependent characteristics. Thus, consideration of non-linearity in these layers is necessary for accurate estimation of the pavement responses of a flexible pavement structure. The pavement responses are computed using Kenlayer computer program developed by Huang. Using the Kenlayer program, this paper examines the effect of nonlinearity in granular on critical pavement responses by conducting parametric analysis. The results indicate that the consideration of nonlinearity yields 23. 13 % reduction in tensile strains at the bottom of <b>bituminous</b> <b>layers</b> and 0. 76 % increase in compressive strains on the top of the sub grade layers and same surface deflections compared to the value obtained using linear elastic analysis. This indicates that nonlinear analysis is more realistic and accurate...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Grids are {{increasingly}} used. They have proved their efficiency, {{but there is}} presently no widely accepted design method to predict the long term life of grid reinforced pavements. This paper describes a full scale experiment carried out on the large pavement fatigue carrousel of IFSTTAR, to test simultaneously 3 pavement sections with different types of grids, in comparison with an unreinforced pavement structure. The tests are carried out on typical French low traffic pavement structures. Results up to approximately 800 000 loads are presented. The experiment is planed to continue to load the test sections up to at least 1 million loads. During the experiment, the behaviour of the pavement sections has been followed by deflection and rut depth measurements, and surface distress analysis (observation of cracks and other degradations). As observed on the circular APT for low traffic pavements with thin <b>bituminous</b> <b>layers,</b> crack development was following a transversal orientation. This experiment shows the necessity {{to better understand the}} grid behaviour by means of modelling, experiments and use of new measurement techniques as planned in the new Rilem TC-SIB and TC-MCD...|$|R
40|$|A {{three-dimensional}} (3 D) {{finite element}} (FE) model {{was developed to}} calculate the temperature of a pavement located in northeast Portugal. A case study was developed to validate the model. Input data to the model were the hourly values for solar radiation and temperature and mean daily values of wind speed obtained from a meteorological station. The thermal response of a multilayered pavement structure was modeled with a transient thermal analysis for 4 months (December 2003 to April 2004), and the analysis was initiated with the full-depth constant initial temperature obtained from field measurements. During these 4 months, the pavement temperature was measured at a new pavement section, located in IP 4 main road, near Bragan a, in northern Portugal. At this location, seven thermocouples were installed in the asphalt concrete layers at seven different depths. These pavement data were used to validate this simulation model by a comparison of model calculated data with measured pavement temperatures. The 3 D FE analysis {{proved to be an}} interesting tool to simulate the transient behavior of asphalt concrete pavements. The suggested simulation model can predict the pavement temperature at different levels of <b>bituminous</b> <b>layers</b> with good accuracy...|$|R
