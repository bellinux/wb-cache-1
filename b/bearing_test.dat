The Nissan ads, {{designed for the}} debut of the Nissan Altima in 1993, demonstrated a similar display of ball bearings on their less expensive vehicle, with a narrator saying, [...] "When we at Nissan saw Lexus do a test like this to show how well their car was put together, we were impressed, {{so we decided to}} do the same test on the new $13,000 Nissan Altima." [...] A Roy Rogers ad parodied the Ball Bearing spot by rolling a ball bearing around the edge of a roast beef sandwich.

30|$|The spherical plain <b>bearing</b> <b>test</b> bench is a {{necessary}} detecting equipment in the research process of self-lubricating spherical plain bearings. The varying environmental temperatures cause the thermal deformation of the wear-depth detecting system of <b>bearing</b> <b>test</b> benches and then affect {{the accuracy of the}} wear-depth detecting data. However, few researches about the spherical plain <b>bearing</b> <b>test</b> benches can be found with the implementation of the detecting error compensation. Based on the self-made modular spherical plain <b>bearing</b> <b>test</b> bench, two main causes of thermal errors, the friction heat of bearings and the environmental temperature variation, are analysed. The thermal errors caused by the friction heat of bearings are calculated, and the thermal deformation of the wear-depth detecting system caused by the varying environmental temperatures is detected. In view of the above results, the environmental temperature variation is the main cause of the two error factors. When the environmental temperatures rise is 10.3  °C, the thermal deformation is approximately 0.01  mm. In addition, the comprehensive compensating model of the thermal error of the wear-depth detecting system is built by multiple linear regression (MLR) and time series analysis. Compared with the detecting data of the thermal errors, the comprehensive compensating model has higher fitting precision, and the maximum residual is only 1  μm. A comprehensive compensating model of the thermal error of the wear-depth detecting system is proposed, which provides a theoretical basis for the improvement of the real-time wear-depth detecting precision of the spherical plain <b>bearing</b> <b>test</b> bench.|$|E
30|$|However, due {{to various}} error factors, such as {{temperature}} variations, loading changes, electromagnetic interference, the wear of assistant rolling bearings, etc. which affect the real-time wear-depth detecting precision of the spherical plain <b>bearing</b> <b>test</b> bench, the evaluating {{accuracy of the}} tribological property of spherical plain bearings is reduced. Among above factors, the thermal errors caused by the temperature variation are the main factors [2]. How to reduce the thermal errors of the <b>bearing</b> <b>test</b> bench {{is important for the}} evaluation of self-lubricating spherical plain bearings.|$|E

It was shown that coatings of nichrome, glass and calcium fluoride are self-lubricating from about 500 to 900 C, but give high friction at the lower temperatures.

The existing researches only build the thermal error models, {{and do not}} compensate effectively the thermal errors. Zhou [4] built the thermal error compensation model of the spherical plain <b>bearing</b> <b>test</b> bench under the high temperature operating condition, but did not verify the fitting precision and the applicability of this model, nor compensated the thermal errors. Hu et al.

Relevant researches of CNC machine {{can be used on}} thermal compensating method, bringing in software-based compensating error method. In other words, {{on the basis of the}} thermal deformation analysis, the mathematical compensating model of the thermal errors is built, and then the thermal deformation is predicted in the control system. At last, the thermal errors are compensated in real time [7, 8]. In this process, many mathematical methods are used for the thermal error modeling, such as, regression analysis method [9], FEM, neural networks [10], time series analysis [11], screw theory, fuzzy theory [12], grey theory [13], support vector machine [14], genetic algorithm [15], ant colony algorithm [16].|$|E
