40|$|ABSTRACT. Edible-oil {{refining}} {{industries in}} Saudi Arabia have expanded con-siderably {{in the last}} twenty years. The major waste generated by these indus-tries is spent bleaching clays. It is estimated that about 6000 ton of this waste is generated annually. The cost of the disposed <b>bleaching</b> <b>clay</b> along with oil it contains (20 - 40 % of the spent clay weight) are major costs of refining. Further-more, the disposal of spent <b>bleaching</b> <b>clay</b> in landfills can cause environmental pollution problems {{in addition to being}} a source of odors and fire hazards. This paper describes a process for the recovery of oil from spent <b>bleaching</b> <b>clay</b> by solvent extraction followed by reactivation of the deoiled clay by acid treatment. Also, a preliminary cost estimation of the suggested process was presented for a plant which can process 4800 ton/year of spent bleaching to produce 3600 ton/year of reactivated spent bleaching and 800 ton/year of re-covered oil.

40|$|Abstract. <b>Bleaching</b> <b>clay</b> {{refers to}} clays {{that in their}} natural or {{activated}} state {{have the capacity to}} absorb dyes and other remaining undesirable ingredients from edible oil during its purification processes. Thus, the most important function of <b>bleaching</b> <b>clay</b> is to improve the appearance, flavor, odor, and stability of the final oil product. Hexane, acetone, and methyl ethyl ketone were used as the solvents in this research, and RSM (response surface methodology) was employed for determining the optimal parameters. The variable parameters included the solvent to clay ratio (SCR) and the extraction time. Results showed methyl ethyl ketone with the final oil removal efficiency of 61. 3 % was superior to hexane and acetone, with efficiencies of 52. 7 and 59. 1 %, respectively.

40|$|In this study, clay {{samples were}} {{collected}} in the localities of Bana and Sabga, in the regions {{of the west and}} north-west Cameroon, respectively. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine their mineralogical composition, their physico-chemical properties and to assess their potential use in the bleaching process of palm oil, which is the main edible vegetable oil produced and refined in Cameroon. The results obtained from the analyses (XRD, FTIR, DTA / TGA and SEM) revealed that montmorillonite is the main clay mineral in these materials. It is associated with kaolinite and mica. Non-clay minerals such as quartz, anatase, cristobalite, K-feldspar and heulandite are also identified in variable quantities. Chemical analyses of the major elements show that the clays from Bana and Sabga consist mainly of the follow oxides such as SiO 2, Al 2 O 3 and Fe 2 O 3. Bana clays have a cation exchange capacity (CEC) between 50 and 60 meq/ 100 g and a specific surface area between 50 and 60 m 2 / g. Sabga clays have a lower capacity cation exchange (38 - 46 meq/ 100 g) and a wider range of specific surface area (33 - 90 m 2 / g). The characterization of the natural clays allowed to select of one sample by locality for sulfuric acid treatment. The acid treatment of these materials led to structural, morphological and textural changes. Analysis by X-ray diffraction showed a progressive decrease in the intensity of the (001) reflection of montmorillonite and a shift of its basal d 001 -value. Treatment with more acid concentration causes an increase in the surface area of the obtained products and a decrease in cation exchange capacity. The assessment of the bleaching power of natural and acid-activated Bana clay in palm oil decolorization shows that the activated clay has a high bleaching capacity (~ 87 %) compared to the natural clay (~ 55 %). palm oil <b>Bleaching</b> by these <b>clay</b> materials does not deteriorate the bleached oil.

Biodiesel fuel is produced catalytically by transesterification reaction here catches the researcher attention nowadays {{as it is a}} promising alternative diesel fuel (Xie and Yang, 2012). Edible oil industries produce spent <b>bleaching</b> <b>clay</b> (SBC) as their major wastes. Biodiesel is prepared via a catalytic reaction between triglycerides and alcohol. Glycerol is the by-product of the reaction. The reaction involves the breakage of the glycerol structure and exchanges of alkyl group between the alcohol and ester part of the triglycerides molecule; as such, the reaction is known as transesterification (Alba-Rubio et al., 2010). Among the three major routes, transesterification seems to be the best compared to heating and microemulsions for reducing the viscosity as well as minimizing engine complications (Feyzi et al., 2014). Other than that, the transesterification pathway, esterification of free fatty acids (FFAs) with alcohols in the presence of acid catalysts also produces methyl esters or biodiesel. One of the main reasons or the conceptualization of biodiesel is the environmental pollution, specifically CO 2 emission. Concerning the CO 2 emission, in 2005 the EU introduced an innovative cost-effective scheme termed the ‘Emission Trading Scheme’ (ETS), a scheme that Australia, New Zealand and the United States are keen to adopt in their long-term plan for dealing with greenhouse gases (Narkhede et al., 2014).

The possibility of managing natural acid clays from the island of Milos, which were generated by natural acid alteration systems. Acid activation of a bentonite can be monitored by N 2 -ad/desorption, IR-spectroscopy, titration, chemical analysis and CEC-determination: The octahedral layering of smectites is dissolved during acid attack. The remaining tetrahedral layer forms an x-ray amorphous, in a sodium-carbonate-solution soluble and porous phases which provides most of the activity. The natural acid alteration of the milosbentonites is comparable to a technical reaction. The activated clay represents a thermodynamically unstable material because of its trend towards recrystallisation of the silicious phase (finally: CT-Opalum). This mineral forms throughout geological periods from the remaining tetrahedral layer.

Approach: In this study, the effect of different solid to solvent ratio on the deoiling efficiency of SBC samples from palm oil refinery and palm kernel refinery were studied. The amount of extracted oil and deoiling efficiency for both types of SBC increases as the solid to solvent ratio is decreased. Results: All the extracted oils, irrespective of the amount of solvent used, have poorer quality than crude oil and may be difficult to be refined to good quality and stability. Conclusion: The deoiled SBC treated using different solid to solvent ratio gave almost similar regeneration efficiency i. e., about 80 % for bleaching of CPO and not more than 30 % for bleaching of CPKO...|$|E
40|$|The {{commencement}} of production of activated clay {{by the local}} industry has created the demand for bentonite (montmorillonite) clay which is the basic raw material used in the manufacturing process. In the search for this material, field augering and sampling programme were undertaken in areas which collectively form the Segama Group near lahad Datu, Sabah. Seven samples, representing the total variation in a montmorillonite clay deposit, have been investigated for their mineralogic and physico-chemical characteristics. The mineral is dominantly a Ca-montmorillonite clay, with quartz, feldspar and zeolite as the main impurities. Early investigations by chemical and physical properties tests showed that this material could be suitable as a <b>bleaching</b> <b>clay</b> (or as a raw material {{for use in the}} manufacture of acid activated clay). The commercial appraisal of this clay deposit still depends on many experimental studies such as trial acid activation and bleaching tests of activated products on crude oil. ...|$|E
40|$|<b>Bleaching</b> <b>clay</b> (BC) is {{one example}} of {{phyllosilicate}} clay that consists of two tetrahedral sheets sandwiching a central octahedral sheet. Palladium (Pd) is proposed to adsorb on the layers of BC by adsorption process to form the palladium supported in <b>bleaching</b> <b>clay</b> (Pd-BC) structure. The layer structure of BC with the ability of exchangable cation allowed the adsorption process of Pd. In this research, pretreatment of BC involved the acid content analysis using ion chromatography (IC) and acid-base titration, fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) to determine its physical and chemical characteristics. The adsorption process is done by adding PdC 1 2 solution of variable Pd contents (1, 2, 3 % w/w) into BC-ethanol suspension and stirred for 4 hours, before the mixture is filtered, washed three times with distilled water and dried at room temperature. The characterization with X-ray diffraction (XRD) is meant to study layer spacings, while N 2 sorption is to obtain surface areas and pore structure. The hydrogenation process of palm oil was performed using Pd-BC as catalyst in order to test the catalytic activity of Pd-BC. The catalyst is dissolved in isopropanol before the mixture is bubbled with H 2 gas for 60 minutes, then palm oil is added at room temperature and the hydrogenation process is continued for another 90 minutes. After that the hydrogenated palm oil is extracted with hexane and esterified with methanol in NaOH before the product is analyzed by gas chromatography (GC) to determine the percentage of fatty acid methyl esters (FAME). The acid-base titration and IC analysis of BC revealed that BC sample has about 1. 26 to 1. 8213 % w/w of sulphuric acid, while FTIR and TGA confirmed the presence of clay mineral in BC and its thermal process. The adsorption process with different Pd contents varied the distribution of Pd cations between the layers of BC and its adsorption capacity. Pd-BC samples have smaller surface area, but larger layer spacing than BC. Pd-BC samples are achieved for catalytic hydrogenation of palm oil and cause lower percentage of C 18 : 2 FAME through higher percentage of C 18 : 0 and C 18 : 1 FAMEs...|$|E
40|$|Abstract [...] Clay {{samples of}} six {{different}} locations of Kurdistan region were characterized. Chemical compositions of the clays were found using XRF technique for the clay powders. The mineralogy {{of the samples}} by XRD shows that the clay samples are mostly mixed layer type of Chlorite/Smectite composition with different types and quantities of mineral impurities. Specific surface area (SSA) and cation exchange capacity (CEC) for the clay samples were determined by methylene blue adsorption method. Although the de-oiled spent clays have less SSA and CEC compared with their virgin samples, but their adsorption efficiency is 70 - 80 % higher than their virgin clays due {{to the increase in}} the organophilic character of the de-oiled spent clays, while acid activation of the natural clays has no significant effect on the adsorption efficiency. Charcoal, the universal adsorbent, has removed 58 % of 50 ppm phenol solution, while de-oiled spent clays have removed 80 - 95 % of the phenol concentration. Index Term [...] removal of phenol, de-oiling of clay, spent <b>bleaching</b> <b>clay,</b> adsorption efficiency. I...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} work, the {{transesterification}} of crude palm oil (CPO) adsorbed on spent <b>bleaching</b> <b>clay</b> (SBC) and waste catfish fat using Commercial-CaO, barnacle (B-CaO) and mixed-oxide (B-CaO·ZnO) as a heterogeneous catalyst were attempted. In order {{to enhance the}} catalytic activity, the catalysts have been calcined at 500 - 900 °C for 2 h. It have been had found 900 °C is the optimum condition for catalyst preparation because upon calcination, the catalyst transformed to CaO from the initial CaCO 3 structure. The mechanochemical treatment had been used for preparation of mixed oxide. The catalyst had been characterized using thermogravimetric/differential thermal analysis (TGA/DTA), x-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Brunauer, Emmett and Teller surface area (BET), x-ray fluorescence (XRF), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDX) and basic strength using Hammett indicators. Results showed that the CaO exist at the optimum condition of calcination and also found that these catalyst consist of strong basic site. The result shows that, the optimal condition for transesterification of catfish fat and SBC reaction catalyzed by B-CaO at 93. 7...|$|E
40|$|There {{has been}} a {{significant}} increase in the demand for using recycled materials in construction because of the lack and limitation of available natural resources. A number of industrial and domestic waste products are being used in the replacement of traditional materials for road construction, and many studies have been carried out in recent years on the use of different recycled materials in substitution of conventional fillers in Asphalt Concretes (AC). The aim of this laboratory research is to analyze the physical characteristics of three different recycled fillers and compare them with those of a traditional limestone filler. The alternative fillers presented in this paper are: a waste <b>bleaching</b> <b>clay</b> that comes from two consecutive stages in the industrial process for decolouring vegetable oils and producing biogas (Ud filler), a dried mud waste from a tungsten mine (MW filler) and a recycled glass powder (Gl filler). Results show significant differences between the fillers, and, in particular, Rigden Voids (RV) seem to have the largest potential influence on the rheology of ACs...|$|E
40|$|Oil-laden spent <b>bleaching</b> <b>clay</b> (SBC) is {{currently}} under-utilized by dumping it in landfills without {{any attempt to}} recover the oil. Therefore, effort {{has been made to}} extract the waste oil using different solvents (methanol, ethanol, petroleum ether, and hexane), and utilize the oil in transesterification reaction. Cleaner oil (free from polar components and least acid content) of 28. 2 ± 0. 6 wt. %, a significant amount susceptible to be converted to biodiesel, was extracted using non-polar solvent. However, the relatively high free fatty acid content leads to yield loss through saponification under homogeneous base-catalyzed reaction. As such, in the present work, heterogeneous base-catalyzed transesterification has been proposed using CaO. Parametric study has been conducted and the optimal conditions was found to be: methanol/oil mass ratio 0. 5 : 1; catalyst amount 6 wt. %, and reaction temperature of 65 °C. The highest purity of 98. 6 ± 0. 8 % was achieved within 2. 5 h. Biodiesel yield under the solid catalyst was quantified as 90. 4 % as compared to 45. 5 % and 61. 0 %, respectively for classical NaOH, and KOH homogeneous catalysts...|$|E
