Still, {{little research has}} been conducted on service <b>blueprints.</b> The case study at hand explores how <b>blueprints</b> can be applied in a situation with three key actors, all with different motives and wishes. The case study is within the domain of car parking, a service which at a first glance may seem simple, but is rather complex when scrutinized. Three ways of <b>blueprinting</b> the situation are presented and discussed in the paper.

We ask how well does PCN represent the concepts present in service <b>blueprinting?</b> To answer this question we examine the similarities and differences between service <b>blueprinting</b> and PCN using a recognized method of ontological comparison. We have found PCN supports some but not all of the concepts in service <b>blueprinting.</b> The outcome is important because knowing the shortcomings of PCN compared with service <b>blueprinting</b> will allow modelers to exercise care when using PCN diagrams to represent service processes...|$|R

5000|$|It {{is widely}} {{believed}} that genes provide a [...] "blueprint" [...] for the body {{in much the same}} way that architectural or mechanical engineering <b>blueprints</b> describe buildings or machines. At a superficial level, genes and conventional <b>blueprints</b> share the common property of being low dimensional (genes are organised as a one-dimensional string of nucleotides; <b>blueprints</b> are typically two-dimensional drawings on paper) but containing information about fully three-dimensional structures. However, this view ignores the fundamental differences between genes and <b>blueprints</b> in the nature of the mapping from low order information to the high order object.|$|R

40|$|Service <b>blueprinting</b> {{has been}} used for over 30 years as a service process {{visualization}} technique. A new service process visualization technique called Process-Chain-Network (PCN) has been recently introduced and is claimed to be an improvement on previous visualization methods. We use the method of conceptual evaluation to compare and explore the similarities and differences between the concepts in service <b>blueprinting</b> and the concepts in PCN. Specifically, we aim to answer two research questions: 1) how well do PCN concepts support service <b>blueprinting</b> concepts? and 2) how well do service <b>blueprinting</b> concepts support PCN concepts? The results of this study show that these modeling formalisms have different views towards the categorization of service activities. We conclude that whilst service <b>blueprinting</b> depicts business roles and their interactions with a customer, PCN focuses on the nature of interaction between customer and service provider. Moreover, we find that PCN is a better method for process re-engineering in comparison with service <b>blueprinting,</b> both modelings supporting customer experience to some degree...|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{postgraduate}} training program in psychiatry in Saudi Arabia, {{which was established}} in 1997, is a 4 -year residency program.

Methods: Based on the guidelines of four professional bodies, documentary analysis was used to develop global and detailed test <b>blueprints</b> for each year of the residency program. An expert panel participated during piloting and final modification of the test <b>blueprints.</b> Their opinion about the content, weightage for each content domain, and proportion of test items to be sampled in each cognitive category as defined by modified Bloom’s taxonomy were elicited.
