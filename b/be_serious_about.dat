500|$|The {{recording}} {{sessions for}} Spiderland are reputed {{to have been}} difficult {{for the members of}} the band and were, according to AllMusic, [...] "intense, traumatic and one more piece of evidence supporting the theory that band members had to be periodically institutionalized during the completion of the album." [...] Rumors circulated that at least one member of Slint had been checked into a psychiatric hospital. Walford later addressed these stories in an article in Select by saying, [...] " [...] definitely trying to <b>be</b> <b>serious</b> <b>about</b> things, pretty intense, which made recording the album kinda stressful."

[...] Among other completed GCI field projects were efforts to preserve the Mogao Caves and Yungang Grottoes in China (announced in 1989); to restore prehistoric rock paintings of Sierra de San Francisco in Baja California Sur (1994); and to protect ancient buildings and archaeological sites in Iraq following {{the start of the}} Iraq war (2004).|$|E

500|$|The play {{repeatedly}} mocks Victorian {{traditions and}} social customs, {{marriage and the}} pursuit of love in particular. In Victorian times earnestness was considered to be the over-riding societal value, originating in religious attempts to reform the lower classes, it spread to the upper ones too throughout the century. The play's very title, with its mocking paradox (serious people are so because they do not see trivial comedies), introduces the theme, it continues in the drawing room discussion, [...] "Yes, but you must <b>be</b> <b>serious</b> <b>about</b> it. I hate people who are not serious about meals. It is so shallow of them," [...] says Algernon in Act 1; allusions are quick and from multiple angles.|$|E
500|$|The {{video was}} {{directed}} in Los Angeles, California on September 10, 2010 by Colin Tilley. It chronicles Ciara in a menagerie of settings, in the mountains, a mansion, a reflection pool, and a warehouse. The minimalistic clip sees numerous wardrobe changes, and unlike typical Ciara videos, {{it does not}} highlight dance aspects. Several outfits she dons include low-riding jeans and a shirt which reveals her abs. Becky Bain of Idolator compared Ciara to Janet Jackson in the clip, noting Ciara's [...] "oversized top and comfy jeans" [...] to Jackson in [...] "Again" [...] and [...] "Love Will Never Do." [...] Bain positively reviewed the clip, stating, [...] "It's a safe video, for sure, but oh-so nice to look at." [...] A Rap-Up writer stated [...] "after watching the grown 'n' [...] sexy new Colin Tilley-directed video from Ciara, you're guaranteed to be left 'Speechless.'" [...] Although he appreciated Ciara for lowering down the sex appeal and relying on her vocals, Ed Easton, Jr. of WXRK gave the video seven of ten stars, and {{said that it was}} not enough to put Ciara [...] "ahead of all the talented musical divas in the industry." [...] Easton {{went on to say that}} [...] "the video is not meant to be over-sexual but still gives us an intimate feel to the singer that, in the long run, may even garner better responses among all age demographics." [...] He also complimented the video as a whole saying, [...] "The shots of Ciara are stunning and she is shown to <b>be</b> <b>serious</b> <b>about</b> her quest for love from a special someone." ...|$|E
500|$|Arthur Ransome {{described}} The Importance... as {{the most}} trivial of Wilde's society plays, {{and the only one}} that produces [...] "that peculiar exhilaration of the spirit by which we recognise the beautiful." [...] "It is", he wrote, [...] "precisely because it is consistently trivial that it is not ugly." [...] Ellmann says that The Importance of Being Earnest touched on many themes Wilde had been building since the 1880s—the languor of aesthetic poses was well established and Wilde takes it {{as a starting point for}} the two protagonists. While Salome, An Ideal Husband and The Picture of Dorian Gray had dwelt on more serious wrongdoing, vice in Earnest is represented by Algy's craving for cucumber sandwiches. Wilde told Robert Ross that the play's theme was [...] "That we should treat all trivial things in life very seriously, and all serious things of life with a sincere and studied triviality." [...] The theme is hinted at in the play's ironic title, and [...] "earnestness" [...] is repeatedly alluded to in the dialogue, Algernon says in Act II, [...] "one has to <b>be</b> <b>serious</b> <b>about</b> something if one is to have any amusement in life" [...] but goes on to reproach Jack for 'being serious about everything'". Blackmail and corruption had haunted the double lives of Dorian Gray and Sir Robert Chiltern (in An Ideal Husband), but in Earnest the protagonists' duplicity (Algernon's [...] "bunburying" [...] and Worthing's double life as Jack and Ernest) is undertaken for more innocent purposes—largely to avoid unwelcome social obligations. While much theatre of the time tackled serious social and political issues, Earnest is superficially about nothing at all. It [...] "refuses to play the game" [...] of other dramatists of the period, for instance Bernard Shaw, who used their characters to draw audiences to grander ideals.|$|E

500|$|The {{official}} commission enquiring {{into the}} attacks on Christians, originally constituted on 19 September 2009 {{for a period of}} three months, had been extended ten times, causing dismay amongst local Christians. Yeddyurappa initially stated that a judicial inquiry into the attacks was unnecessary, as he believed that the state police were competent enough to investigate and bring the perpetrators to justice themselves. Jesuit priest Fr. M. K. George remarked that [...] "The government does not seem to <b>be</b> <b>serious</b> <b>about</b> the early release of the commission report... the government is lacking the political will to act". Revd. Manohar Chandra Prasad criticised the government for [...] "soft pedaling" [...] and believed that the extension was an indication of the government's [...] "step-motherly" [...] attitude toward Christians. The official report of Justice B. K. Somasekhara, initiated by Yeddyurappa's BJP-led state government was eventually made public in January 2011, in which it stated that the attacks were suspected to have been initiated by the Bajrang Dal, denying any involvement of the state government and the police, [...] "true Hindus", or any cover-up in the attacks after collecting 2,204 exhibits and 30 materials related to the attacks, 25 spot inspections and examining attacks on 57 churches in Karnataka. The report stated, [...] "There is no basis to apprehension of Christian petitioners that politicians, BJP, mainstream Sangh Parivar and State Government directly or indirectly are involved in the attacks. No politicians or representative of any political party in the state who politicised the incidents of attack for their benefits immediately did not come before the commission with their affidavits or to give evidence or opinion in the matter." [...] The report—which cost around 30million and took over 28 months, 300 sittings, and 800 pieces of recorded evidence to be realised—concluded that the district authorities and the police had, in most cases, taken the [...] "appropriate steps regarding the Church and the people including the required protection." [...] Somasekhara concluded that the attacks were [...] "carried out by 'misguided elements' following circulation of literature insulting Hindu gods and reports of conversion activity by some Christian groups" [...] and that [...] "the Roman Catholic church and its leaders were not involved in conversion." [...] In the case of Chikkamagaluru district, Somasekhara noted that [...] "the Government may enquire and withdraw the privileges to every people who is indulging or getting converted in such illegal activities of conversions commercially." [...] The report was widely criticised by the Christian community for being [...] "biased" [...] and activists belonging to the Religious Christian Minority Wing of the JDS burnt a copy of the Somasekhara report.|$|E

Gary Kofford, the county commissioner for Emery County in 2008, stated that talk of building a nuclear plant near Green River was just speculation after TPD had been searching for a site for over a year. An editorial in nearby Grand Junction, Colorado expressed tentative support for the project, especially in light of coal and gas plants being shut down despite growing energy demands. The Utah State Legislature approved a joint resolution endorsing nuclear power as a viable option in March 2009.|$|E

2500|$|Colbert's {{candidacy}} had met mixed reviews, and {{the growing}} realization that Colbert may <b>be</b> <b>serious</b> <b>about</b> his candidacy raised the ire of the American political and media establishment. When the Public Opinion Strategies poll put Colbert ahead of Bill Richardson, Richardson's spokesman responded: [...] "This is a serious election with serious consequences {{and we are not}} going to comment on this ridiculous exercise". Katon Dawson, South Carolina's Republican party chairman believed Colbert would be better off using the $35,000 entrance fee to [...] "buy a sports car and get a girlfriend". The high polling gave way to what New York called a [...] "Stephen Colbert Backlash", as bloggers criticized Colbert for verging into legitimate political territory, asserting that he had [...] "crossed the line from lampooning the process to actively messing it up." [...] Republican candidate John McCain gave a more positive view, stating that he hoped Colbert would join the Republican party's debates. [...] "He can make them livelier and he can reach a wider audience than that narrow little sliver that watches his show." [...] In conversation with ABC News, Fox News commentator and template for Stephen Colbert's The Colbert Report persona Bill O'Reilly dismissed Colbert's run as a publicity stunt for his book, I Am America. O'Reilly also called Colbert out for not going on the O'Reilly Factor to discuss the book: [...] "He knows the book is dumb, so he's not going to come in. Instead, he runs for president." [...] Sam Brownback's October 19, 2007 withdrawal from the race was humorously attributed by some to competition from the comedian, but others took Colbert's challenge to Brownback's run more seriously. As one reporter for The Atlantic wrote, [...] "Sam Brownback may cite other reasons for dropping out today, but Colbert’s plan to run in South Carolina wouldn’t have made his job there any easier." ...|$|E
