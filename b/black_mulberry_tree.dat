5|$|Very {{little is}} known about the mid-18th century planting, {{although}} there remains, in front of the house, a gnarled <b>black</b> <b>mulberry</b> <b>tree,</b> which was described as ancient in 1822. However, 19th-century drawings and photographs record increasingly elaborate and fussy bedding schemes, finally swept away in the 1960s. Today there is a more informal style, emphasising the architectural character of the garden with its long straight sweeps of wall; it is also an easier style to maintain. In recent years, native wild plants have been allowed to mingle with rare and exotic specimens and continual thought is being given to contrasting textures and colours of foliage. The lower garden, below the front of the house, now has the air of a small arboretum with a number of fine specimen trees, such as a splendid late-leafing catalpa (an oriental plane tree) dominates this part of the garden and the grass at its foot is left uncut during the Spring, allowing camassias and bluebells to make a fine showing.|$|E
40|$|Using a {{combination}} of protein isolation/characterization and molecular cloning, we have demonstrated that the bark of the <b>black</b> <b>mulberry</b> <b>tree</b> (Morus nigra) accumulates large quantities of a galactose-specific (MornigaG) and a mannose (Man) -specific (MornigaM) jacalin-related lectin. MornigaG resembles jacalin with respect to its molecular structure, specificity, and co- and posttranslational processing indicating that it follows the secretory pathway and eventually accumulates in the vacuolar compartment. In contrast, MornigaM represents a novel type of highly active Man-specific jacalin-related lectin that is synthesized without signal peptide or other vacuolar targeting sequences, and accordingly, accumulates in the cytoplasm. The isolation and cloning, and immunocytochemical localization of MornigaG and MornigaM not only demonstrates that jacalin-related lectins act as vegetative storage proteins in bark, but also allows a detailed comparison of a vacuolar galactose-specific and a cytoplasmic Man-specific jacalin-related lectin from a single species. Moreover, the identification of MornigaM provides the first evidence, to our knowledge, that bark cells accumulate large quantities of a cytoplasmic storage protein. In addition, due to its high activity, abundance, and ease of preparation, MornigaM is of great potential value for practical applications as a tool and bioactive protein in biological and biomedical research. status: publishe...|$|E

50|$|Morus nigra, called <b>black</b> <b>mulberry</b> or {{blackberry}} (not to {{be confused}} with the blackberries which are various species of Rubus), is a species of flowering plant in the family Moraceae, native to southwestern Asia, where it has been cultivated for so long that its precise natural range is unknown. It is known for its large number of chromosomes, as it has 154 pairs (308 individuals). Other mulberry species are sometimes confused with <b>black</b> <b>mulberry,</b> particularly black-fruited individuals of the white <b>mulberry,</b> but <b>black</b> <b>mulberry</b> can be distinguished by the uniformly hairy lower leaf surface.|$|R

40|$|To examine {{possible}} {{effects of}} soil water conditions in {{summer in the}} hydro-fluctuation belt of the Three Gorges Reservoir Area on mulberry, we grew potted mulberry in a greenhouse under three soil water regimes designed to simulate normal irrigation (CK), moderate drought stress (T 1) and elevated drought stress (T 2). The results showed the following. 1) With drought stress increasing, the heights, base diameters, and root surface areas of <b>mulberry</b> <b>trees</b> decreased significantly relative to the corresponding earlier period. The root / shoot ratio increased gradually in the earlier stage, and decreased gradually in the later stage. The specific root area of <b>mulberry</b> <b>trees</b> on the whole increased significantly relative to the corresponding earlier period. 2) With the elongation of treatment time, the growth of mulberry seedlings decreased gradually, and the heights, base diameters, root surface area and root / shoot ratio of the <b>mulberry</b> <b>trees</b> in the three treatment groups increased to different degrees. The specific root area of <b>mulberry</b> <b>trees</b> on the whole decreased gradually. We concluded that under the different degrees of drought stress the growth of <b>mulberry</b> <b>trees</b> would be inhibited, but the plants were also able {{to adapt to the}} stress, thereby maintaining physiological and metabolic viability. Biomass appeared to be re-allocated such that water absorption capacity was improved. Accordingly it can be concluded that the <b>mulberry</b> <b>trees</b> demonstrated potential for resisting and tolerating drought stress. ...|$|R
