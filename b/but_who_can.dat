500|$|Unlike most web forums, 4chan {{does not}} have a {{registration}} system, allowing users to post anonymously. Any nickname may be used when posting, even one that has been previously adopted, such as [...] "Anonymous" [...] or [...] "moot". In place of registration, 4chan has provided tripcodes as an optional form of authenticating a poster's identity. As making a post without filling in the [...] "Name" [...] field causes posts to be attributed to [...] "Anonymous", general understanding on 4chan holds that Anonymous is not a single person but a collective (hive) of users. Moderators generally post without a name even when performing sysop actions. A [...] "capcode" [...] may be used to attribute the post to [...] "Anonymous ## Mod", although moderators often post without the capcode. In a 2011 interview on Nico Nico Douga, Poole explained that there are approximately 20 volunteer moderators active on 4chan. 4chan also has a junior moderation team, called [...] "janitors", who may delete posts or images and suggest that the normal moderation team ban a user, <b>but</b> <b>who</b> <b>can</b> not post with a capcode. Revealing oneself as a janitor is grounds for immediate dismissal.|$|E
500|$|A {{review by}} John Ferriar in the October 1805 Monthly Review argued, [...] "It {{has fallen to}} the lot of this writer to puzzle our {{critical}} discernment more than once [...] He has no contrived to manufacture a large quarto, which he has styled a poem, but of what description it is no easy matter to decide [...] The poem of Madoc is not didactic, nor elegiac, nor classical, in any respect [...] Respecting the manners, Mr. Southey {{appears to have been}} more successful than in his choice of the story. He has adhered to history where he could discover any facts adapted to his purpose; and when history failed him, he has had resource to probability." [...] Ferriar continued with an attack on the Welsh names that appear within the poem: [...] "we own that the nomenclature of his heroes has shocked what Mr. S. would call our prejudices. Georvyl and Rird and Rodri and Llaian may have charms for Cambrian ears, <b>but</b> <b>who</b> <b>can</b> feel an interest in Tezozomoc, Tlalala, or Ocelopan [...] how could we swallow Yuhidthiton, Coanocotzin, and, above all, the yawnings jaw-dislocating Ayayaca?—These torturing words, particularly the latter, remind us so strongly of the odious cacophony of the Nurse and Child, that they really are not to be tolerated." ...|$|E

2500|$|On January 15, 2010, Santorum sent {{an email}} and letter to {{supporters}} {{of his political}} action committee, saying, [...] "I'm convinced that conservatives need a candidate who will not only stand up for our views, <b>but</b> <b>who</b> <b>can</b> articulate a conservative vision for our country's future". He continued, [...] "And right now, I just don't see anyone stepping up to the plate.
