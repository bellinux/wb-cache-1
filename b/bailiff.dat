5000|$|In Ontario, provincial <b>bailiffs</b> provide primary {{transportation}} of prisoners between correctional facilities such as jails and prisons. Under the Ministry of Correctional Services Act (Ontario), while transporting prisoners, <b>bailiffs</b> have {{the powers of}} police constables. When necessary, Provincial correctional officers will act as <b>bailiffs</b> for {{short and long term}} assignments and full-time <b>bailiffs</b> are typically recruited from the correctional officer ranks. Provincial <b>bailiffs</b> are armed with expandable batons and pepper spray and operate {{under the jurisdiction of the}} provincial Ministry of Community Safety and Correctional Services. Duties normally associated with <b>bailiffs</b> in other jurisdictions, such as residential evictions, seizures, and other processes order by the court, are performed by sheriffs under the office of the Attorney General of Ontario or [...] "private" [...] <b>bailiffs</b> if initiated without a court order.|$|R
60|$|The {{secret of}} the hiding-place in which I {{contrived}} to defy discovery is soon told. I was hidden (without the <b>bailiff's</b> knowledge) in the bedroom of the <b>bailiff's</b> mother. And did the <b>bailiff's</b> mother know it? you will ask. To which I answer: the <b>bailiff's</b> mother did it. And, what is more, gloried in doing it--not, observe, {{as an act of}} hostility to my relatives, but simply as a duty that lay on her conscience.|$|R

5|$|Clemmons {{was accused}} {{multiple}} times of displaying violent behavior during court appearances. In one incident, he dismantled a metal door stop and hid {{it in his}} sock {{to use as a}} weapon. It was discovered and confiscated by a court <b>bailiff.</b> In another incident, he took a lock from his holding cell and threw it at a <b>bailiff,</b> but missed and accidentally hit his mother instead. Clemmons was once accused of reaching for a guard's pistol while being transported to court. During one trial, he was shackled in leg irons and seated next to a uniformed officer because the presiding judge ordered extra security, claiming Clemmons had threatened him. At age 16, Clemmons' charges were committed from juvenile court to adult court due to the extremely violent nature of his crimes and demeanor.|$|E
5|$|From {{this period}} {{we also have}} the first record of a baptism, of William Knovill, son of John Knovill, King's <b>Bailiff</b> in Aberystwyth, in 1286. Doubtless the {{surviving}} twelfth century font was used.|$|E
5|$|In 1894 the {{authorities}} decided {{to abolish the}} position of <b>bailiff</b> and {{it was decided that}} some of its tasks would be transferred to the sheriffs. This resulted in 26 new chief of police positions, largely corresponding to the old bailiwicks. Some received jurisdiction over both cities and rural areas, other just rural areas. At the same time the existing police districts were expanded to include the surrounding rural areas. However, the individual <b>bailiff</b> were not removed from office until their natural retirement, leaving some bailiwick in place until 1919. The reform eliminated the difference between the rural and city police forces; yet the sheriffs were only subordinate to the chief of police in police matters—in civil matters and administration they remained under the county governors.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} fourteenth century, Lihou {{may have become}} the origin of a local legend about a wealthy <b>Bailiff</b> of Guernsey who {{attempted}} to have an innocent peasant executed on false charges of theft of silver cups. In either 1302 or 1304, a priory servant called Thomas le Roer was alleged to have murdered one of the monks. The <b>Bailiff</b> and several assistants attempted to apprehend Le Roer {{but he did not}} surrender and was subsequently killed by Ranulph Gautier, one of the Bailiff's assistants. Gautier tried to find sanctuary in a nearby church and eventually fled to England, before returning to Guernsey when the king pardoned him. However, some years later Gautier was tortured to death in Castle Cornet, but it is not known why.|$|E
5|$|Oak Lodge, near Sidmouth Wood, {{was built}} in about 1852 as {{a home for the}} park <b>bailiff,</b> who was {{responsible}} for repair and maintenance in the park. It is used by The Royal Parks as its base for a similar function today.|$|E
5|$|Until the 20th century, the States {{relied on}} {{indirect}} taxation {{to finance the}} administration of Jersey. The levying of impôts (duties) {{different from those of}} the United Kingdom was granted by Charles II and remained in the hands of the Assembly of Governor, <b>Bailiff</b> and Jurats until 1921 when that body's tax raising powers were transferred to the Assembly of the States, leaving the Assembly of Governor, <b>Bailiff</b> and Jurats to serve simply as licensing bench for the sale of alcohol (this fiscal reform also stripped the Lieutenant-Governor of most of his effective remaining administrative functions). The Income Tax Law of 1928 introducing income tax was the first law drafted entirely in English. Income tax has been levied at a flat rate of 20% set by the occupying Germans during the Second World War.|$|E
50|$|The Epping Forest Act 1878 {{allows the}} conservators {{of the forest}} to appoint forest keepers, reeves and also <b>bailiffs.</b> These {{individuals}} may also be attested as a constable, although currently only Forest Keepers are sworn in. The forest currently has volunteer fishing <b>bailiffs,</b> who support Forest Keepers. As the Epping Forest Act does include this title of appointment, these individuals are statutory <b>bailiffs</b> and the title is not merely just historic.|$|R

5|$|Before {{his service}} in North America, {{he served as}} <b>Bailiff</b> of Guernsey. His tenure in New England was authoritarian and turbulent, as his views were decidedly pro-Anglican, a {{negative}} quality in a region home to many Puritans. His actions in New England resulted in his overthrow during the 1689 Boston revolt.|$|E
5|$|For a {{long time}} Tronstad had wanted to return to Norway to {{organize}} resistance work, however he was prevented by the Norwegian military authorities in Britain.

5|$|The Mafia of Villalba was of {{relatively}} recent origin, {{as it did}} {{not go back to}} the 1860s, considered to be the period when the Mafia emerged around Palermo. It started as a form of private protection and {{has little to do with}} large estates as was the case in many other rural areas where many mafiosi started as caretakers and lease-holders (gabelloto or <b>bailiff)</b> for absentee landlords.|$|E

Some of the branches were stolen in 1776, but soon recovered.|$|E
5|$|Breton {{was the son}} of William le Breton, a royal justice. The elder Breton, who is {{sometimes}} styled William Brito in records, came from a family who often served as justices and other legal officials. Occasionally the younger Breton appears in the records as John Bretun or John Brito. He served as Sheriff of Herefordshire from 1254 to 1257, and then as constable and <b>bailiff</b> of Abergavenny around 1257. In October 1259 he was sent abroad on matters pertaining to King Henry III of England, and Henry's son, the future Edward I. He then served Edward as keeper of the prince's wardrobe and then after November 1261 as the prince's steward.|$|E
5|$|By the 12th century, Southampton was an {{important}} trading port with trade routes to Normandy, the Levant and Gascony. Both the town and castle played {{an important}} role in this trade, in part forming a warehouse for the king's imports, this process being managed by a Crown <b>Bailiff.</b> The former castle hall was turned into a subterranean vault in the 13th century, probably for storing wine. Stone houses, often combining accommodation and storage facilities, began to be built in Southampton by the wealthiest merchants, particularly in the prosperous western and southern parts of the town, but these properties could not be easily defended against attack.|$|E

50|$|Within {{the state}} of Maryland {{there are two types}} of <b>bailiffs,</b> circuit court and {{district}} court. Circuit court <b>bailiffs</b> are employees of the prospective county of which they work and possess no law enforcement authority. They are unarmed and provide services to the courtroom judge, escort and maintain the jurors/jury pool, and maintain courtroom decorum. district court <b>bailiffs</b> provide similar services as their circuit court counterparts but differ in that they are employees of {{the state of}} Maryland, are armed, and have limited law enforcement authority while on duty.|$|R
5|$|By {{the next}} day, the revolt was rapidly growing. The villagers spread the news across the region, and John Geoffrey, a local <b>bailiff,</b> rode between Brentwood and Chelmsford, {{rallying}} support. On 4 June, the rebels gathered at Bocking, where their future plans {{seem to have}} been discussed. The Essex rebels, possibly a few thousand strong, advanced towards London, some probably travelling directly and others via Kent. One group, under the leadership of John Wrawe, a former chaplain, marched north towards the neighbouring county of Suffolk, with the intention of raising a revolt there.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 16th century, islanders {{travelled}} across the North Atlantic {{to participate in}} the Newfoundland fisheries. In recognition for help given to him during his exile in Jersey in the 1640s, King Charles II of England gave Vice Admiral Sir George Carteret, <b>bailiff</b> and governor, a large grant of land in the American colonies in between the Hudson and Delaware rivers, which he promptly named New Jersey. It is now a state in the United States.|$|E
5|$|Other {{alterations}} and additions {{were made}} during the 17th century, including a modest brick house added onto the west end in 1639, perhaps intended as a home for Sir Alexander's <b>bailiff,</b> as he himself no longer used the hall as his main residence by that time. The house was built at 90° to the timber-framed building, to which it was later joined. During the Civil War Sir Alexander, as a Royalist, was imprisoned and suffered financial hardship. Reduced means eventually forced his heir, John Radclyffe, into selling the hall to Colonel John Birch in 1662, thus ending more than 300 years of his family's occupation.|$|E
