5000|$|The name of {{the tribe}} shows what the {{occupation}} of the tribe was: trading. The word teke means 'to buy'. The economy of the Teke is mainly based on farming maize, millet and tobacco, but the Teke are also hunters, skilled fishermen and traders. The Teke lived in an area across Republic of Congo, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Gabon. The mfumu {{was the head of}} the family and his prestige grew as family members increased. The Teke sometimes chose blacksmiths as chiefs. The blacksmiths were important in the community and this occupation was passed down from father to son. In terms of life of the Teke, the village chief was chosen as religious leader, he was the most important tribal member and he would keep all the potions and spiritual bones that would be used in traditional ceremonies to speak to the spirits and rule safety over his people. [...] Teke masks are mainly used in traditional dancing ceremonies such as wedding, funeral and initiation ceremonies of young men entering adult hood. The mask is also used as a social and political identifier of social structure within a tribe or family. The Teke or Kidumu people are well known for their Teke masks, which are round flat disk-like wooden masks that have abstract patterns and geometric motifs with horizontal lines that are painted in earthly colors, mainly dark blue, blacks, browns and clays. The traditional Teke masks all have triangle shaped noses. The masks have narrow eye slits to enable the masker to see without being seen. They have holes pierced along the edge for the attachment of a woven raffia dress with feathers and fibers. The mask is held in place with a <b>bite</b> <b>bar</b> at the back that the wearer holds in his teeth. The dress would add to the mask's costume and conceal the wearer. The masks originate from the upper Ogowe region.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Recent {{years are}} seeing a renewed {{interest}} in general multi-robot architectures, capable of automating coordination. However, few architectures explore integration of multiple coordination mechanisms. Thus {{the question of how to}} best integrate coordination mechanisms is left open. This paper focuses on the micro-kernel integration approach used in <b>BITE</b> (<b>Bar</b> Ilan Teamwork Engine), a multi-robot behaviorbased architecture. This approach allows the developer to plug in coordination mechanisms (teamwork behaviors) to be used depending on the context of execution. BITE imposes constraints on the specification of taskwork behaviors, which allow BITE’s control algorithm to automatically determine sequencing and task-allocation points during task execution. At such points, teamwork behaviors (known as interaction behaviors) are triggered to automate the coordination processes. We argue that BITE’s approach is preferable to the methodology of existing architectures, and provide analysis of experiments in using BITE with Sony AIBO robots, to support our argument. I...|$|E

40|$|We {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} the naturally occurring horizontal plane movements of a head stabilized in a standard ophthalmic headrest and to analyze their magnitude, velocity, spectral characteristics, and correlation to the cardio pulmonary system. Two custom-made air-coupled highly accurate (± 2 μm) ultrasound transducers were {{used to measure the}} displacements of the head in different horizontal directions with a sampling frequency of 100 Hz. Synchronously to the head movements, an electrocardiogram (ECG) signal was recorded. Three healthy subjects participated in the study. Frequency analysis of the recorded head movements and their velocities was carried out, and functions of coherence between the two displacements and the ECG signal were calculated. Frequency of respiration and the heartbeat were clearly visible in all recorded head movements. The amplitude of head displacements was typically in the range of ± 100 μm. The first harmonic of the heartbeat (in the range of 2 – 3 Hz), rather than its principal frequency, was found to be the dominant frequency of both head movements and their velocities. Coherence analysis showed high interdependence between the considered signals for frequencies of up to 20 Hz.

40|$|Our {{aim was to}} {{ascertain}} whether the ultrasonic measurement of longitudinal corneal apex displacements carried out in a proper headrest is a credible method of ocular pulse (OP) detection. To distinguish between longitudinal movements of the eye globe treated as a rigid body and ocular surface expansion caused by the variations of the eye-globe volume, two ultrasound distance sensors were applied to noninvasively measure displacements of cornea and sclera. The same sensors were {{used to examine the}} influence of the anterio–posterior movements of a fixed head on the registration of corneal apex pulsation. In both experiments, ECG signals were synchronically recorded. Time, spectral, and coherence analyses obtained for four healthy subjects showed that the ocular surface expansion due to pulsatile ocular blood flow (POBF) is the main component of longitudinal corneal displacement. Ocular surface pulsation is always affected by the head movement. However, there exist some unique properties of signals, which help to distinguish between head and eye movements.

Experiments 1 and 2 used a conditioned-suppression procedure in which bar pressing was reinforced with food. A transparent shield prevented <b>biting</b> of the <b>bar.</b> When the stimulus was paired with shock, bar pressing decreased (conditioned suppression) and tube biting increased during the stimulus (classically conditioned aggression). When the bite tube was removed on alternate sessions in Experiment 2, there was more suppression when the tube was present, thus suggesting that <b>biting</b> competed with <b>bar</b> pressing. However, this simple competing-response interpretation was complicated by the findings of Experiment 3 where, with naive monkeys, bar pressing was never reinforced with food, yet bar pressing was induced during the stimulus and was highest when the bite tube was absent. The fact that stimulus-induced bar pressing developed inciated that bar pressing in conditioned-suppression procedures, suppressed or not, may be maintained by two types of control [...] the food reinforcer and induced CS control. The higher rate of induced bar pressing during the stimulus with the bite tube absent confounds a simple competing response interpretation of conditioned suppression. It suggests that shock-induced responses during conditioned suppression could be both contributing to and competing with responding maintained by food, with the net effect depending on specific but ill-defined features of the situation...|$|R

40|$|Typescript. Bibliography: leaves 177 - 187. xi, 187 leaves ill. (some col.) Behaviorally mediated, psychophysical {{measurements}} of passive sound localization acuity (minimum audible angle, MAA) have been determined in the bottlenose porpoise, Tursiops truncatus. A sub-adult male was {{tested in a}} pen acoustically open to Kaneohe Bay at the Naval Undersea Center facilities, Oahu, Hawaii. Localization thresholds were measured for pure tone pulse trains which varied {{as a function of}} 1) frequency (Horizontal, 6 - 100 kHz; Vertical, 20 - 100 kHz); 2) signal parameters (Horizontal, number of pulses, pulse duration and rise-decay times); and, 3) azimuth (Horizontal, 0 °, 15 °, 30 °, 330 ° and 345 °; Vertical 0 ° and 15 °). Localization capability was also determined for click trains containing 166 clicks each of 35 usec duration, centered at 64. 35 kHz at 0 ° azimuth in both the horizontal and vertical planes. Total signal duration was maintained at either 0. 5 or 1. 0 seconds. The discrimination task was of a spatial, forced choice, two alternative design. The MAAs for pure tones were determined at the 70 th percentile on the psychometric function of localization using a modified up-down staircase method of stimulus presentation. Click trains were presented using the method of constants and MAAs again were determined at the 70 th percentile of correct responses. Calculated MAAs were the mean of a minimum of seven sessions each containing an average of 60 - 80 trials (pure tones) or 90 trials (clicks). The animal maintained a fixed spatial relationship to two underwater transducers by biting a stationary bar (depth 77 cm) placed 18. 6 meters from and midway between the transducers. Sound pressure levels measured at the <b>bite</b> <b>bar</b> were 20 dB: re 1 ubar. The animal indicated the source of the signal by swimming to his right or left and hitting a response paddle. The experimental results demonstrate that the bottlenose porpoise is capable of localizing spatial positions of sound sources within 2 - 3 degrees in both the horizontal and vertical planes. Angular resolution of pure tones was greatest for frequencies of 20 - 60 kHz (MAAs: 2. 1 ° to 2. 5 °); and, MAAs increased at both higher and lower frequencies. The MAA of 3. 6 ° at 6 kHz suggests that the animal is using binaural differences in phase and time at lower frequencies and binaural intensity information at frequencies of 20 kHz and above as localization cues. It also suggests that the tissue overlying the ear and not the mandibular fat body is the main route of sound transmission to the middle ear at frequencies below 20 - 30 kHz. Pure tone thresholds were not significantly altered by changes in pulse duration (3 msec to 500 msec) or rise-decay times greater than 0. 25 msec. Horizontal localization capability to a pulsed 40 kHz signal significantly improved when the porpoise positioned 15 ° to the right or left of the midline between the two transducers (MAAs: 1. 7 ° and 1. 4 ° respectively. Increase in acuity at these azimuths is possibly a function of differential, binaural intensity information which would be greater in this situation than when the animal is at 00 because of the importance of angle of incident sound on the lower jaw (sound is funneled to the middle ear by the mandibular fat body). Maximal MAAs of 5. 3 ° and 5. 2 ° were measured at horizontal azimuths of 30 ° and 330 °. Greatest localization resolution occurred when the animal was presented click trains containing extremely fast rise times and a broadband spectrum of frequencies. The horizontal and vertical MAAs for click trains presented at 0 ° azimuth were 0. 9 ° and 0. 7 ° respectively. These low MAAs for click trains possibly result from the two transmission routes being used simultaneously in conjunction with binaural intensity comparisons and possible binaural comparisons of spectral characteristics in the central nervous system. The rigorous testing situation in pure tone experiments presented minimal auditory information to an immobile animal. This was necessary for determining what acoustic cues are most important for localization. The pulse durations and rise-decay times of the tested stimuli were much longer than that used in active sonar, and the information contained in broadband clicks was absent. The MAAs reported indicate the animal's capabilities only under restricted conditions; and therefore are conservative...|$|E

Two replications, each including 96 fattening pigs of both sexes (3 pens of 16 females and 3 pens of 16 male castrates) from 60 kg to slaughter at average 96 kg live weight, were used to test the effect of EE and sex on behaviour, growth rate, and carcass composition.

In view of the clear homology to clinically observed phenomena, antipsychotic-induced dystonias in antipsychotic-primed NHPs would appear to possess a high degree of translational validity. These NHP phenomena could therefore serve as a useful model for predicting the occurrence of similar abnormal movements with novel substances developed for the treatment of schizophrenia or other psychotic disorders. Moreover, the NHP dystonia model could possibly serve as a biomarker for substances that will eventually cause tardive dyskinesia in patients...|$|R
40|$|Comparative {{studies on}} the housing of single and pair-caged female {{laboratory}} rabbits In this study the housing of laboratory rabbits in an unstructured metal cage commonly used in laboratories (laboratory cage) has been compared with the housing in a structured larger cage (environmental cage). Each cage type was tested for its suitability for housing single and paired female nonreproductive laboratory rabbits. A total of 48 chinchilla bastard laboratory rabbits were examined in four groups of 12 animals at 3. 5 months, 5. 5 months and 7. 5 months of age. In general, the entire behavioral repertoire was checked for low activity around midday and high activity in the evening. These ethological analyses were supplemented by examining the animals´ health, weight, weakness of hocks and changes in hopping. Results: Laboratory cage The single cage (43 x 54 cm = 2. 322 cm 2) had so little space that the animals could only attempt to hop. Doubling the cage floor area enabled the animals to hop only with short steps. Even though rearing was attempted by rabbits up to adulthood, this characteristic exploratory behavior could not be carried out with a cage height of 36. 5 cm. Due {{to the lack of}} space, hopping ability of almost all 7. 5 -month-old rabbits sank from "good" to "sufficient" in 50 % and to "insufficient" in {{the other half of the}} group. The stainless steel cage harms the animals´ hocks. There were two cases of broken claws, and all hocks showed thick epidermis or calluses at age of 7. 5 months. Single-caged rabbits in the laboratory cage had the largest mean weight gain caused by frequent eating and little exercise due to boredom. Stereotypical behavior such as <b>biting</b> <b>bars</b> was seen less often in single-caged rabbits than in the environmental cage, but they bit water bottles and pushed them out of their mountings more frequently. SUMMARY										 143 Pair-caged rabbits in the laboratory cage had social contact with their counterparts 9. 4 - 18. 7 % of the total time, predominantly expressed as lying in contact with the other rabbit. Sexual and aggressive behavior was rare. Harmful biting resulted in three injuries. Relaxed lying of both animals was rarer than in the other systems and was due to the lack of space. Environmental cage With a cage floor area of 4. 658 cm 2 (3. 220 cm 2 open area, 1. 438 cm 2 area under the shelf), the animals were able to hop with short steps. They often hopped around the stable leg of the shelf. A cage height of 66 cm allowed the animals to completely rear for exploration. The period of locomotion was two to three times higher than in the laboratory cage. Jumping up and down from the shelf may slow down morphological changes in hopping motion, but it was not prevented. The ability to hop deteriorated in most of the animals by the age of 7. 5 months from "good" to "sufficient", and to "insufficient" in only one animal. The shelf as an environmental enrichment was used by single-caged animals 5. 4 - 30. 4 % and by pair-caged animals 9. 3 - 30. 5 % of the observation time. In the environmental cage single-caged rabbits used the enriched system equipped with resting shelf and hiding place in the same way as the pair-caged animals. These animals showed <b>bar</b> <b>biting</b> most frequently. Compared to the other groups the pair-caged rabbits in the environmental cage moved more than all other rabbit groups. They ate less than the other groups and had the lowest mean weight gain. Social behavior comprised 18. 2 - 26. 6 % of the observation time, pointing to a lively interest in the other animal. This was predominantly expressed by lying in contact with the other animal. In spite of the possibility of retreating to the shelf or hiding under it, the rabbits cared for their social counterpart much more often in the environmental cage than in the laboratory cage. There was one clash in which one animal was bitten in the ear. 144 										 SUMMARY Assessment of the two cage types: Laboratory cage According to welfare requirements, the laboratory cage for single-caged animals is not appropriate for the housing of rabbits due to the lack of space. Even increasing the floor area by using the "double cage" is not adequate, since the low height of the cage, which prevents rearing, and little stimulation remain unchanged. When rabbits were kept as a pair in the laboratory cage, the subordinate animal cannot retreat or escape when a dominant animal is chasing it. The nonstructured cage is not appropriate for the animals despite the lower number of injurious fights. Environmental cage In the environmental cage, rabbits ý with the exception of adult males - should only be kept as singles when used for testing special scientific hypotheses. Because of frequent <b>bar</b> <b>biting,</b> the cage should be enriched with attractive objects for gnawing. For housing female rabbits in pairs, the environmental cage shows more space than prescribed by the minimum regulatory requirements. In addition, it offers places to retreat, which is very favorable for animals to socialize and exercise. The solid shelf is used for sitting, lying, jumping or hiding. The rabbits seem to "communicate" in this cage type. Conclusions: The housing standards for caging rabbits fixed in the EC guidelines are inadequate to house rabbits in accordance with animal welfare requirements. In contrast, the environmental cage tested in this study offers a larger living space, an adequate height and structure (e. g. hiding place combined with resting shelf) suited to rabbitsý needs. We recommend installing these cages in laboratories and housing rabbits in pairs, if possible. A larger living space of adequate height structured with different functional areas as in the environmental cage is particularly suited to rabbits´ needs. Installing these cages in laboratories may establish pair caging for different scientific objectives. <br...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{evaluate}} the behavioural effects of two different feeding techniques, 30 lactating sows were homogeneously allocated to two groups: T 1 in which animal received a dry meal at fixed times (8 : 30 a. m. and 4 : 00 p. m.) that was ad libitum offered for 30 minutes and group T 2 in which sows received a liquid feed that was available all over the day (from 6 : 00 a. m. to 11 : 00 p. m.). Sows belonging to group T 2 ate more feed (P 0. 05), the number of piglets weaned per sow and the body weight of piglets at weaning were higher for T 2 sows. With regard to behavioural patterns, T 2 sows spent more time standing and engaged in eating (P< 0. 001) and showed improved welfare condition {{by means of a}} reduction of abnormal behaviours such as sitting (P< 0. 01) and <b>bar</b> <b>biting</b> (P< 0. 01).

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the efficiency of prostaglandin analogue treatments on the induction of parturition during late pregnancy in sows, based on fewer and less intense side effects. Twenty-four sows were randomly treated on day 114 of gestation with: (1) 175 micrograms Estrumate; (2) 10 mg Lutalyse; (3) 2 ml. saline (control) or on day 115 with 2 ml saline (control). Sows injected with Lutalyse showed a significant increase in position changes/minute as compared to the C 114 treatments. L 114 treated sows displayed a significant increase in frequency of <b>bar</b> <b>biting</b> compared to the E 114, C 115, and C 114 treatments, and a significant increase in frequency of defecation compared to the C 115 and C 114 treatment. These results demonstrate that sows treated with Estrumate are likely to have fewer, less intense side effects than sows treated with Lutalyse. Conover, Michelle Lee, Mark Mirando and Ruth Newberry.

5000|$|Local {{ordinances}} strictly forbid riders {{from eating}} or drinking {{while on a}} Metrorail train or in a station. [...] Officers {{are required to take}} police action when they observe any criminal activity, but arrests for these minor violations are rare. One exception was on October 23, 2000, when a 12-year-old girl was arrested, searched, and handcuffed for refusing to stop eating french fries while in the Tenleytown-AU Metro station. She was taken to a police juvenile processing area where she was booked, fingerprinted, and detained until her mother arrived to pick her up. [...] At the time of the incident, the Officer had no legal authority to take any formal action against a juvenile other than make an arrest. This policy has since been changed and Transit Police Officers may now issue written warnings to juvenile offenders. Another widely noted case occurred on July 16, 2004, when an EPA employee entered the Metro Center station with a PayDay candy bar. Before passing through the fare gates, patrolling police officers told her to finish eating before she could enter the paid area. Instead, she popped the last <b>bite</b> of the <b>bar</b> into her mouth, continuing to chew it while in the station. She was subsequently arrested after refusing to cooperate with the issuance of a citation for the offense.|$|R
40|$|Sows {{in modern}} pig {{industry}} are often housed individually in farrowing crates {{a few days}} before farrowing until weaning. These farrowing crates limit movements of the sow and therefore also limit them in expressing their behavior. These limitations may lead to distress with the sow and can result in stereotypical behaviors. Because {{it is possible that the}} general behavior of the mother sow also influences her piglets, the hypothesis of the present study was that there is an association between the general behavior of sows and the behavior of their piglets. Our results showed that there was indeed an association between the postures and activities of sows and the behavior of their piglets, not only for nursing–suckling behavior. Results also indicated that piglets prefer resting when sows are resting. When sows were standing up, piglets were running around more. Although there were indications that piglets were more at ease when sows were <b>bar</b> <b>biting</b> compared with when they were sham chewing, a specific relationship between sow stereotypical behavior and piglet behavior could not be demonstrated in the present study. Though, it should be taken in mind that relatively low frequencies of stereotypical behaviors were observed. Furthermore, it could be that not only the prevalence of a specific stereotypical behavior is important but also a specific threshold of that specific behavior should be exceeded to induce effects on the suckling piglets. Alternatively piglets could coinduce stereotypical behavior of the mother sow. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|It is {{well known}} that {{abnormal}} animal behaviour is affected by both environment and genetics. This thesis aimed to use behavioural observations as well as gene expression measurements to explore how animals that perform and receive tail biting (pigs) and feather pecking (laying hens) differ from individuals that are not involved in these behaviours. In study I, the results suggested that tail biting is related to other abnormal behaviours. Pigs performing a high frequency of tail biting focused on abnormal behaviours that included oral manipulation (such as ear and <b>bar</b> <b>biting),</b> whereas those performing less tail biting showed a wider variety of different abnormal behaviours. In study II and III, many genes were differently expressed when neutral pigs were compared with tail biters and receivers, all housed in the same pen, as well as when compared to control pigs housed in a pen with no tail biting. This suggests that the neutral pigs had a phenotype that made them somewhat resistant towards performing and receiving tail biting. Behavioural data, in combination with information on the functions of these differently expressed genes, indicated that this difference in behaviour was due to the neutral pigs being less pig directed in their behaviour. The focus on pigs which remain neutral in the outbreak is a new approach in tail biting studies. The gene expression data further suggested that selection for production may unintentionally have created pigs that perform and receive more pig-directed abnormal behaviour. In study IV, the functions of many of the 16 genes differently expressed between feather pecking hens, victims and control birds, support earlier hypotheses about feather pecking being linked to nutrition/feeding and immune mechanisms. In summary, this thesis provides both behavioural characteristics and lists of genes that strengthen earlier reported results as well as give new suggestions about the biological mechanisms underlying tail biting and feather pecking behaviour...|$|R
