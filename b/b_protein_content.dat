Here, we investigated the effects of subcutaneous injections of methylmercury chloride (MeHg– 5 mg/kg), an environmental neurotoxicant, on S 100 <b>B</b> <b>protein</b> <b>content</b> in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of adult rats. In addition, the performance of animals in an open field (number of squares crossing and rearings) was also analyzed in order to obtain a possible link between alteration in S 100 <b>B</b> <b>protein</b> <b>content</b> in CSF and parameters related to neurological injury. MeHg treatment increased serum mercury and S 100 B protein levels in the CSF. A decrease in the numbers of crossings and rearings was observed in MeHg-treated animals when compared to control group, which suggests a possible neurological injury. The present data show, for the first time, increased S 100 B levels in CSF after exposure to a neurotoxic metal.

Changes in astrocytes, the glial cells involved in synaptic remodeling, need more characterization. We investigated the effect of moderate treadmill exercise (20 [*]min/day) for 4 weeks on some parameters of astrocytic activity in rat hippocampal slices, namely, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), glutamate uptake and glutamine synthetase (GS) activities, glutathione content, and S 100 <b>B</b> <b>protein</b> <b>content</b> and secretion, as well as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels and glucose uptake activity in this tissue.

The storage of formulas A and <b>B</b> (with different <b>protein</b> <b>content)</b> at 4, 20 and 30 °C during 12, 24 and 36 weeks produced an increase in furosine values. Under industrial storage conditions at 55 °C for between 1 and 12 weeks the behaviour of furosine differed between {{the two types of}} formulas. In Formula A (lesser <b>protein</b> <b>content),</b> there was a decrease in furosine level after the third week, whereas in formula <b>B</b> (greater <b>protein</b> <b>content)</b> a decrease was observed after the eighth week. The loss of OPA reactivity reached 18 % and 22 %, respectively, for formula B and formula A stored at 30 °C for 36 weeks. In adverse storage conditions (55 °C), the loss of OPA reactivity reached 50 %. Fluorescence intensity (FI) and absorbance at 420 nm increased at all time/temperatures assayed.

Our {{objective was to}} study the nuclear <b>protein</b> <b>contents</b> of upstream stimulating factor 2 (USF 2 a and USF 2 b), a positive regulator of SF- 1, throughout the menstrual cycle in eutopic endometria from women with and without (control) endometriosis and the involvement of nuclear estrogen receptors (ER) and G-coupled protein estrogen receptor (GPER) - 1. Results: Upstream stimulating factor 2 <b>protein</b> <b>contents</b> were higher in mid (USF 2 b) and late (USF 2 a and USF 2 b) secretory phase in eutopic endometria from endometriosis than control (p < 0. 05). In isolated control epithelial cells incubated with E- 2 and PGE(2), to resemble the endometriosis condition, the data showed: (a) significant increase of USF 2 a and USF 2 <b>b</b> nuclear <b>protein</b> <b>contents</b> when treated with E- 2, PPT (specific agonist for ER alpha) or G 1 (specific agonist for GPER 1); (b) no increase in USF 2 binding to SF- 1 E-Box/DNA consensus sequence in E- 2 -treated cells; (c) USF 2 variants <b>protein</b> <b>contents</b> were not modified by PGE(2); (d) SF- 1 nuclear <b>protein</b> <b>content</b> {{was significantly higher than}} basal when treated with PGE(2), E- 2 or G 1, stimulation unaffected by ICI (nuclear ER antagonist); and (e) increased (p < 0. 05) cytosolic <b>protein</b> <b>contents</b> of P(450) Arom when treated with PGE(2), E- 2, PPT or G 1 compared to basal, effect that was additive with E- 2 + PGE(2) together. Nevertheless, in endometriosis cells, the high USF 2, SF- 1 and P(450) Arom <b>protein</b> <b>contents</b> in basal condition were unmodified. Conclusion: These data strongly suggest that USF 2 variants and P(450) Arom are regulated by E- 2 through ER alpha and GPER 1, whereas SF- 1 through GPER 1, visualized by the response of the cells obtained from control endometria, being unaffected the endogenously stimulated cells from endometriosis origin. The lack of E- 2 stimulation on USF 2 /SF- 1 E-Box/DNA-sequence binding and the absence of PGE(2) effect on USF 2 variants opposite to the strong induction that they exert on SF 1 and P 450 proteins suggest different mechanisms and indirect regulations. The sustained USF 2 variants protein expression during the secretory phase in eutopic endometria from women with endometriosis may participate in the pathophysiology of this disease strongly associated with infertility and its characteristic endometrial invasion to ectopic sites in the pelvic cavity.

40|$|This study {{tests the}} {{hypothesis}} that the activators of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) and 9 -cis-retinoic acid receptor (RXR) regulate human semaphorin 6 B (Sema 6 B) gene expression. The human MCF- 7 breast adenocarcinoma cell line was chosen because it expresses Sema 6 B at a high level. The Sema 6 B mRNA level was analysed by RT-PCR and the semaphorin 6 <b>B</b> <b>protein</b> <b>content</b> was determined using a polyclonal antibody that we have produced and characterized. Treatments with fenofibrate (a PPAR alpha activator) and troglitazone (a PPARgamma ligand) strongly decreased the Sema 6 B mRNA. The drop in Sema 6 B mRNA level and in protein content was more important when the treatment combined the action of fenofibrate or troglitazone and 9 -cis-retinoic aid. On the other hand, no significant change was observed in the Sema 6 B mRNA and protein levels when the cells were exposed to the combined action of GW 610742 (a PPARbeta activator) and 9 -cis-retinoic acid.

Approximately 90 % of total PTPase activity resided in the particulate fraction. In comparison with lean nondiabetic subjects, particulate PTPase activity was reduced 21 % (P < 0. 05) and 22 % (P < 0. 005) in obese nondiabetic and NIDDM subjects, respectively. PTPase 1 B protein levels were likewise decreased by 38 % in NIDDM subjects (P < 0. 05). During hyperinsulinemic glucose clamps, glucose disposal rates (GDR) increased approximately sixfold in lean control and twofold in NIDDM subjects, while particulate PTPase activity did not change. However, a strong positive correlation (r = 0. 64, P < 0. 001) existed between particulate PTPase activity and insulin-stimulated GDR. In five obese NIDDM subjects, weight loss of approximately 10 % body wt resulted in a significant and corresponding increase in both particulate PTPase activity and insulin-stimulated GDR. These findings indicate that skeletal muscle particulate PTPase activity and PTPase 1 <b>B</b> <b>protein</b> <b>content</b> reflect in vivo insulin sensitivity and are reduced in insulin resistant states.

In this study we found that overexpression of CYP 2 B 1 in rat glomerular epithelial cells in vitro significantly increased PAN-induced reactive oxygen species generation, cytotoxicity, cell death, and collapse of the actin cytoskeleton. All of these pathological changes were markedly attenuated by siRNA-induced CYP 2 B 1 silencing. The cellular CYP 2 <b>B</b> 1 <b>protein</b> <b>content</b> was significantly decreased whereas its mRNA level was markedly increased, suggesting regulation by protein degradation rather than transcriptional inhibition in the PAN-treated glomerular epithelial cells. This degradation of CYP 2 B 1 was accompanied by the induction of heme oxygenase- 1, an important indicator of heme-induced oxidative stress. In PAN-treated CYP 2 B 1 -silenced glomerular epithelial cells the induction of heme oxygenase- 1 and caspase- 3 activity were significantly decreased. Further, cleavage of the stress-induced pro-apoptotic endoplasmic reticulum-specific pro-caspase- 12 was prevented in the silenced cells.

40|$|Nitrogen {{contained}} in potato tubers can be present {{either in the}} form of proteins and amino acids or nitrates/glycoalkaloids. These forms are very important with respect to possible impacts on human health. <b>Protein</b> <b>content</b> in tubers is an important positive element of the evaluation of potato quality (Mitrus et al. 2003). Recent estimates of <b>protein</b> <b>content</b> in potatoes were 16 – 25 g/kg of fresh matter (Harris 1992). Though potatoes are not usually regarded as a protein source because of their low <b>protein</b> <b>content,</b> they are an impor-tant constituent of alimentation in European countries and can make a significant nutritional contribution. Duke (1992 a, <b>b)</b> states the <b>protein</b> <b>content</b> in potato tubers as 10 – 127 g/kg and to-tal nitrogen 2. 2 – 17 g/kg. The skin contains more proteins (26 g/kg) in comparison with the whole tuber (21 g/kg). The <b>protein</b> <b>content</b> can vary for different cultivars and between crops of the same variety depending on location, fertiliser usage and crop maturity (Mitrus et al. 2003, Long et al. 2004, Zebarth et al. 2004). Some authors report on using of low-glycoalkaloid potato protein as the main protein source for the nutrition of weaner piglets (Pedersen and Lindberg 2004). Conditions of cul-tivation, harvesting, handling in the packinghouse and storage are the main factors affecting the qual-ity of potatoes (Galido et al. 2004). The way of cultivation, esp. nitrogen nutrition can affect also the pathway of nitrate transport into tubers (Lin et al. 2004). Nitrogen and especially nitrate form accumulations are highly affected by potato cultivars (Hamouz et al. 1999 a, b, Alva et al. 2002), but also by other conditions of the cultivation, such as irrigation (Belanger et al. 2002) and the way of cultivation (Lindhauer and Weber 1993), and an introduction of transgenic potato cultivars with a modified nitrate reductase expressions (Djennane et al. 2002 a, b). Conventional and organic potatoes attract more and more attention regarding their assessment of element composition (Bacchi et al. 2004) or tubers quality (Hamouz et al. 1999 a, b), and so there is the need of more knowledge about their constituents affecting positively or negatively their quality...|$|R
40|$|Malignant gliomas {{represent}} one of {{the most}} aggressive forms of cancer, displaying high mortality rates and limited treatment options. Specific subpopulations of cells residing in the tumor niche with stem-like characteristics have been postulated to initiate and maintain neoplasticity while resisting conventional therapies. The study presented here aims to define the role of glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK 3 b) in patient-derived glioblastoma (GBM) stem-like cell (GSC) proliferation, apoptosis and invasion. To evaluate the potential role of GSK 3 b in GBM, protein profiles from 68 GBM patients and 20 normal brain samples were analyzed for EGFR-mediated PI 3 kinase/Akt and GSK 3 b signaling molecules including protein phosphatase 2 A (PP 2 A). To better understand the function of GSK 3 b in GBM, GSCs were isolated from GBM patient samples. Blocking GSK 3 b phosphorylation at Serine 9 attenuated cell proliferation while concomitantly stimulating apoptosis through activation of Caspase- 3 in patient-derived GSCs. Increasing GSK 3 <b>b</b> <b>protein</b> <b>content</b> resulted in the inhibition of cell proliferation, colony formation and stimulated programmed cell death. Depleting GSK 3 b in GSCs down regulated PP 2 A. Furthermore, knocking down PP 2 A or blocking its activity by okadaic acid inactivated GSK 3 b by increasing GSK 3 b phosphorylation at Serine 9. Our data suggests that GSK 3 b may function as a regulator of apoptosis and tumorigenesis in GSCs.

40|$|Abstract Background Congenital dyserythropoietic anemia type II (CDAII), {{the most}} common form of CDA, is an {{autosomal}} recessive condition. CDAII diagnosis is based on invasive, expensive, and time consuming tests that are available only in specialized laboratories. The recent identification of SEC 23 B mutations as the cause of CDAII opens new possibilities for the molecular diagnosis of the disease. The aim of this study was to characterize molecular genomic SEC 23 B defects in 16 unrelated patients affected by CDAII and correlate the identified genetic alterations with SEC 23 B transcript and protein levels in erythroid precursors. Methods SEC 23 B was sequenced in 16 patients, their relatives and 100 control participants. SEC 23 B transcript level were studied by quantitative PCR (qPCR) in peripheral erythroid precursors and lymphocytes from the patients and healthy control participants. Sec 23 <b>B</b> <b>protein</b> <b>content</b> was analyzed by immunoblotting in samples of erythroblast cells from CDAII patients and healthy controls. Results All of the investigated cases carried SEC 23 B mutations on both alleles, with the exception of two patients in which a single heterozygous mutation was found. We identified 15 different SEC 23 B mutations, of which four represent novel mutations: p. Gln 214 Stop, p. Thr 485 Ala, p. Val 637 Gly, and p. Ser 727 Phe. The CDAII patients exhibited a 40 - 60 % decrease of SEC 23 B mRNA levels in erythroid precursors when compared with the corresponding cell type from healthy participants. The largest decrease was observed in compound heterozygote patients with missense/nonsense mutations. In three patients, Sec 23 B protein levels were evaluated in erythroid precursors and found to be strictly correlated with the reduction observed at the transcript level. We also demonstrate that Sec 23 B mRNA expression levels in lymphocytes and erythroblasts are similar. Conclusions In this study, we identified four novel SEC 23 B mutations associated with CDAII disease. We also demonstrate that the genetic alteration results in a significant decrease of SEC 23 B transcript in erythroid precursors. Similar down-regulation was observed in peripheral lymphocytes, suggesting that the use of these cells might be sufficient in the identification of Sec 23 B gene alterations. Finally, we demonstrate that decreased Sec 23 B protein levels in erythroid precursors correlate with down-regulation of the SEC 23 B mRNA transcript. </p...|$|E

To determine sensitive endpoints in various organ systems, the effects of Aroclor 1260 on immune, endocrine, and hepatic systems were evaluated in a dose-response study. Nine-week old male rats were treated with Aroclor 1260 by oral gavage at dosages ranging from 0. 025 to 156 mg/kg/day for 10 consecutive days and killed two days after the last treatment. Eight days prior to sacrifice, rats were injected i. v. with sheep red blood cells (SRBC) for determination of humoral immunity. No observable adverse effect level (NOAEL) and lowest observable adverse effect level (LOAEL) were determined for liver, thymus and genital organ weights, body weight, serum luteinizing hormone (LH), testosterone, thyroxine and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) concentrations, hepatic microsomal testosterone hydroxylase activities, and hepatic microsomal cytochrome P 450 (CYP) 1 A 1, CYP 1 A 2, CYP 2 B 1 and CYP 2 <b>B</b> 2 <b>protein</b> levels. Treatment with Aroclor 1260, at all dosages, had no effect on testis, seminal vesicle or ventral prostate weights, on thymus weight or on serum LH or testosterone levels. Among the endpoints altered by Aroclor 1260, the most sensitive, with a LOAEL of 1. 25 mg/kg/day, were increased testosterone 16 β-hydroxylase activity and androstenedione formation.

40|$|Abstract—We {{analyzed}} {{the influence of}} aging and genetic hypertension on the function and expression of soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC) in the aortas of prehypertensive and old spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) {{as well as in}} age-matched normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY). The expression of heterodimeric sGC (a 1 and b 1) was assessed at the mRNA and protein level, and its function was assessed by the relaxant responses of phenylephrine-contracted endothelium-denuded aortic rings to the nitric oxide (NO) donor sodium nitroprusside. The vasodilator potency of sodium nitroprusside was significantly reduced (P, 0. 05) with age (3 - to 6 -fold increase in the EC 50 in old WKY and SHR compared with their young counterparts) as well as with hypertension (3 -fold increase in old SHR compared with age-matched WKY), whereas the vasodilator potency of sodium nitroprusside did not differ between young SHR and WKY. A similar influence of aging and hypertension on NO-stimulated GC activity was revealed at the GC expression level: Whereas the <b>b</b> 1 <b>protein</b> <b>content</b> was similar in young rats of both strains, old WKY exhibited 60 % lower and old SHR exhibited 80 % lower <b>b</b> 1 subunit <b>protein</b> compared with young rats (P, 0. 05). Moreover, the abundance of a 1 and b 1 mRNA (assessed by reverse transcriptase—polymerase chain reaction) was similar in young rats but was 2. 5 -fold (a 1) and 4. 3 -fold (b 1) lower in old SHR compared with old WKY. In conclusion, our findings show that both aging and hypertension decrease sGC expression and its NO-dependent activation in aortic tissue. Downregulation of sGC may therefore contribute to arterial dysfunction in senescence and chronic hypertension. (Hypertension. 2000; 35 : 43 - 47. ...|$|R

Treatments were conventional irrigation, drought stress at growth stage and drought stress at reproductive stage as main plots and plant density at four levels (15, 25, 35 and 45 plants/m 2) as subplots. In this experiment, mean grain and biological yield, chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, proline, carotenoid and <b>protein</b> <b>content</b> were measured. Result showed that there was significant interaction between drought stress and plant density on biological yield, grain yield and harvest index. Maximum biological yield and grain yield (11235 and 3368 kg/ha, respectively) was recorded at 35 plants/m 2 density in conventional irrigation treatment, which had no significant difference with 45 plants/m 2 density. The highest grain yield due to drought stress in growth and reproductive stages (2520 and 2260 kg/ha, respectively) was observed at 35 plants/m 2 density and the lowest yield (2066 and 1953 kg/ha, respectively) was obtained at 15 plants/m 2.

(2010 b) determined the crude <b>protein</b> <b>content</b> 14.07 % in M. surmuletus. Ersoy (2006) investigated the nutrient composition of the U. moluccensis fillets in September, December, March, and May and determined crude <b>protein</b> <b>contents</b> as 19.32, 21.00, 18.75, and 19.36 %, respectively. She stated that the <b>protein</b> <b>contents</b> changed depending on the catching season and the feeding density. Polat et al. (2009) found that the crude <b>protein</b> <b>content</b> of M. barbatus was 20.43 % in Spring, 17.90 % in Winter, and 18.97 % in Autumn. The amount of crude protein in the spring, before spawning period, {{was significantly higher than}} other seasons (P <  0.05). Ozogul et al. (2011) found that the crude <b>protein</b> <b>contents</b> of U. pori were between 17.68 and 21.27 % and the crude <b>protein</b> <b>contents</b> of M. barbatus were between 18.25 and 20.52 % in their studies.

However, SC, which had the highest temperature, had <b>protein</b> <b>content</b> that were only {{higher than that of}} SY. This may be explained by changes in solar radiation and humidity in SC. Solar radiation increased from 10  days after heading and was highest at 20 – 30  days, whereas a negative correlation between solar radiation and <b>protein</b> <b>content</b> was observed in this stage. Humidity significantly decreased after 20  days and was significantly correlated with <b>protein</b> <b>content</b> during this stage. Consequently, changes in solar radiation and humidity in SC may have impaired the increase of <b>protein</b> <b>content</b> that was caused by high temperature.|$|R

The {{aim of this study}} was to determine whether (a) salivary protein carbonyls are elevated in AD and MCI subjects, (<b>b)</b> salivary <b>protein</b> carbonyl <b>contents</b> in these groups exhibit diurnal variation, and (c) apolipoprotein E ɛ 4 (apoE ɛ 4) carrier status impacts salivary carbonyl concentrations or rhythmicity in the AD and MCI cohorts. Unstimulated saliva was collected at fixed intervals between 8  AM and 10  PM from 15 AD subject, 21 MCI subjects, and 30 cognitively-intact controls. Salivary protein carbonyl concentrations were measured by ELISA. ApoE genotyping was performed on the AD and MCI individuals. For all groups, mean <b>protein</b> carbonyl <b>contents</b> were significantly elevated at 2 PM relative to other time points surveyed. Mean salivary protein carbonyl concentrations did not differ among the diagnostic groups. ApoE ɛ 4 carriers exhibited less temporal variation in salivary protein carbonyls relative to noncarriers. Thus, <b>protein</b> carbonyl <b>content</b> exhibits diurnal variation in adult human saliva. ApoE ɛ 4 carrier status may impact oropharyngeal disease expression by attenuating the inherent diurnal variability in salivary redox homeostasis. Salivary protein carbonyls do not differentiate AD and MCI from normal individuals. In conclusion, oxidative stress {{has been documented}} in tissues and biofluids of subjects with sporadic AD and MCI. This article demonstrates that levels of protein carbonyls, a marker of oxidative stress, exhibit robust diurnal variation in the saliva of normal elderly, MCI, and AD subjects. Apolipoprotein E ɛ 4 allele carrier status may attenuate this temporal variability in salivary redox homeostasis and thereby impact the natural history of oropharyngeal diseases...|$|R

This study seeks to assess the effect of sunflower variety on hullability and <b>protein</b> <b>content.</b> Genetic effects were studied by means of seed samples obtained from a network of variety evaluation trials undertaken across the production area in France for sunflowers. For both characteristics, significant differences between cultivars were observed; as a consequence, the potential <b>protein</b> <b>content</b> of their dehulled meals also ranged widely (34 – 44 %).

Human data on SOD 2 <b>protein</b> <b>content</b> in {{chronic kidney disease}} (CKD) are sparse and mortality data are lacking. We investigated SOD 2 <b>protein</b> <b>content</b> in monocytes from patients with hemodialysis therapy (n= 81), CKD stage 1 – 5 (n= 120), and healthy controls (n= 13) using in-cell Western assays. SOD 2 protein decreased from CKD stage 1 until stage 4 whereas it increased again in stage 5 with and without hemodialysis. SOD 2 gene expression, analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR, was not significantly different between the groups. Elevating cellular superoxide production reduced SOD 2 <b>protein</b> <b>content.</b> This effect was abolished by the {{superoxide dismutase}} mimetic Tempol. Using gelelectrophoresis and Western blot we did not detect nitrotyrosine modifications of SOD 2 in CKD. Finally, in patients with CKD stage 5 with hemodialysis therapy higher than median SOD 2 <b>protein</b> <b>content</b> was associated with higher all-cause mortality. In conclusion, SOD 2 <b>protein</b> <b>content</b> declined in CKD until stage 4 while SOD 2 gene expression did not.

However, organic crops generally show lower performances than conventional ones. In France, organic winter wheat production is characterized by low grain <b>protein</b> <b>content.</b> There is a crucial need for better understanding the variability of grain <b>protein</b> <b>content,</b> because millers require batches with values over 10. 5 % of dry matter. Here, a regional agronomic diagnosis was carried out to identify the limiting factors and crop management practices explaining the variability of grain <b>protein</b> <b>content.</b> The studied field network was a set of 51 organic winter wheat plots in south-eastern France. The mixed-model method was used for identifying and ranking the limiting factors and the crop management practices responsible for variation in limiting factors. Our {{results show that the}} grain <b>protein</b> <b>content</b> variation was mostly explained by the baking quality grade of the cultivar, crop nitrogen status and weed density at flowering. There was a positive correlation between grain <b>protein</b> <b>content</b> and both crop nitrogen status and weed density. To a lesser extent, climatic factors also explained grain <b>protein</b> <b>content</b> variability. A lower water stress increased grain <b>protein</b> <b>content,</b> whereas an increase in the photothermal quotient and daily temperature over 25 °C reduced grain <b>protein</b> <b>content.</b> In south-eastern France, grain <b>protein</b> <b>content</b> of organic winter wheat could be increased by improving fertilization management, using an improved baking quality grade cultivar, choosing a legume fodder crop as preceding crop, or by avoiding late sowing dates...|$|R
