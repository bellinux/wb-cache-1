40|$|Graduation date: 1982 Implements for tilling {{compacted}} {{forest soils}} were tested on sites logged with ground-based machines in Oregon. The sites covered {{a variety of}} soil conditions ranging from a clay loam to a rock 7 2 C 2 iplemeflts tested included disk harrows (four aies), brusa blades (three sites), standard subsoiler tines (two sites), wing. - ed subsoiler tines (two sites), and rock ripper tines (five sites). Soil density and strength measurements made prior to the tillage operatIons indicated that the depth of compacted soil within primary skid trails exceeded 12 inches and was often detectable {{to a depth of}} 18 inches. Logging debris typically was incorporated into the skid trail surfaces. The disk harrow proved ineffective for loosening compacted forest soils at depth when: 1) the soil had a high rock content, 2) disk weighting was insufficient, or 3) the trail cross-section was concave and the harrow wide. The <b>brush</b> <b>blade</b> failed to loosen the deeper layers of compaction and resulted in transfer of some of the loosened soil to the trail edges. The short closely-spaced tines did not allow loosened soil and logging debris to pass between the tines. The performance of subsoiler and rock ripper tines was favorable in the rocky coarse-grained soils and some of the cohesive soils. However, plastic flow rather than shatterin. g occurred when tines operated below their crit- [...] ical depth. The critical depth was controlled by soil conditions and tue geometry. The winged subsoiler tines resulted in 30 to 64 percent greater shattering than did standard subsoiler tines at a ripping depth of 1. 5 feet. Close tine spacing caused logging debris to accumulate in front of the tines. The tines produced large angular clods when working in a cohesive soil. These clods did not break down after heavy rains. Clods from coarse-grain soils broke down readily when moistened. A trapezoid-shaped representatjoii of the soil sbattering pattern produced by tines was shown to compare adequately with actual shattering patterns. A computer program was developed to analyze ripping depth and tine spacing combinations resulting in maximum shattering across the skid trail width. The cost of the tillage operations ranged from 89 to 228 per mile of skid trail (1980 - 1981 dollars) ...|$|E

50|$|In this leg's Detour, teams chose between <b>Blade</b> and <b>Brush.</b> In <b>Blade,</b> {{one team}} member {{had to cut}} out the shape of Haibao, the mascot ot Expo 2010, while the other team member traced and cut out the background. In Brush, one team member had to {{correctly}} write out a specific Chinese character, while the other reproduced {{a painting of a}} bamboo grove. In this leg's Roadblock, one team member ate 1.5 kg of Yangzhou's famous fried rice in order to receive their next clue.|$|R
50|$|Cutting heads include {{circular}} saw blades (chisel tooth or scratcher tooth), <b>brush</b> knives, grass <b>blades,</b> etc. Most brushcutters also allow other heads to be fitted, including bump feed and fixed line heads {{such as those}} used on line trimmers or modified saw blades such as a beaver blade which resembles a chainsaw.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} brush steam turbine operation. This turbine is {{installed}} in small biomass incineration plant, which {{is situated in}} premises of company Dřevopar s. r. o. in Loštice. First part is focused on incineration plant technology introduction. Following parts are focused on brush steam turbine principle, design solutions and evaluation of the operation. Comparative steam turbines are chosen according to preliminary calculation. The end of thesis contains <b>brush</b> turbine and <b>blade</b> turbine comparison...|$|R

Also found were parts of a human skeleton, possibly of a Carthaginian sailor trapped by the ship's ballast. The above pictures of the Marsala ship execavation are from the Regional Archaeological Museum Baglio Anselmi of Marsala in Sicily, Italy.|$|R

50|$|Erskine {{continues}} {{as the home}} of Erskine Attachments, formerly known as Erskine Manufacturing Company, established in 1948. The company began as a manufacturer of heavy equipment snowblowers and grain hitch elevators before changing its name to Erskine Attachments when it began manufacturing a line of Skid Steer Attachments for the Ingersoll Rand Bobcat company. Now private, Erskine Attachments manufactures more than 40 skid steer attachments including <b>brush</b> mowers, snowblowers, <b>blades,</b> buckets, grapples, post drivers, stump grinders, tree shears, and others that fit all skid steers and some front end loaders that utilize the skid steer style quick attach mechanism. Erskine Attachments was used as a pilot for the Minnesota JOBZ incentive program to revitalize Minnesota's manufacturing opportunities and has been referenced for its continuance as a viable success story.|$|R
2500|$|Charles F. Brush {{designed}} one of world's earliest electricity-generating windmills in Cleveland, Ohio in 1887–1888. His {{engineering company}} built the [...] "windmill dynamo" [...] at his home. It operated from 1886 until 1900. The Brush wind turbine had a rotor 56 feet (17 m) {{in diameter and}} was mounted on a 60-foot (18 m) tower, making it similar in size {{to some of the}} first commercial wind farm turbines of the 1980s. However, the machine was only rated at 12kW; it turned relatively slowly since it had 144 <b>blades.</b> <b>Brush</b> used the connected dynamo either to charge a bank of batteries or to operate up to 100 incandescent light bulbs, three arc lamps, and various motors in his laboratory. The machine fell into disuse after 1900 when electricity became available from Cleveland's central stations, and was abandoned in 1908.|$|R
