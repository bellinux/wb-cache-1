5000|$|The term <b>bovine</b> <b>malignant</b> {{catarrhal}} fever {{has been applied}} to three different patterns of disease: ...|$|R
50|$|<b>Bovine</b> <b>malignant</b> {{catarrhal}} fever (BMCF) is a fatal lymphoproliferative disease {{caused by a}} group of ruminant gamma herpes viruses including Alcelaphine gammaherpesvirus 1 (AlHV-1) and Ovine gammaherpesvirus 2 (OvHV-2) These viruses cause unapparent infection in their reservoir hosts (sheep with OvHV-2 and wildebeest with AlHV-1), but are usually fatal in cattle and other ungulates such as deer, antelope, and buffalo.|$|R
5000|$|A {{well-established}} {{example is}} lactate dehydrogenase virus, {{which is often}} found in mouse tumours. GB virus C and Chandipura virus are possible examples in humans. It has also been suggested that a virus related to Alcelaphine herpesvirus 1 is a passenger virus that, unlike AHV1 itself, doesn't cause <b>bovine</b> <b>malignant</b> catarrhal fever. [...] The discredited Duesberg hypothesis posits that HIV is a passenger virus in the etiology of AIDS.|$|R
40|$|Malignant {{catarrhal}} fever (MCF) or <b>malignant</b> head <b>catarrh</b> {{has been recognized}} for over 125 years as a fatal disease of cattle and some wild ruminants. Found world wide, it is prevalent in Australia, the British Isles, Canada, the United States and Africa. The causative agent {{is believed to be}} a herpesvirus, but it is thought that tissue damage is the result of hypersensitivity to viral antigens and not direct effects of the virus...|$|R
40|$|Sinusitis in cattle {{generally}} {{involves the}} frontal sinus, with the maxillary sinus rarely being affected. The {{most common cause}} of a frontal sinusitis is dehorning. Other less prevalent causes are injuries to the horn with hemorrhage into the sinus, extension of infection from -the nasal mucous membranes, as well as contusions and fractures of the bones of the frontal sinus area. <b>Malignant</b> head <b>catarrh</b> and purulent rhinitis of calves have sinusitis as 2 ̆ 7 a secondary symptom...|$|R
40|$|About 90 % of <b>bovine</b> <b>malignant</b> {{catarrhal}} fever (BMCF) PCR-positive cases in South Africa {{are caused by}} alcelaphine herpesvirus- 1 (AlHV- 1) and the other 10 % by ovine herpesvirus- 2 (OvHV- 2). The prevalence of OvHV- 2 in different sheep breeds in South Africa was determined in order to investigate whether the lower incidence of BMCF caused by OvHV- 2 in comparison with AlHV- 1 can be ascribed to a low incidence of the virus in sheep. A single-tube hemi-nested PCR was developed, evaluated and applied to detect OvHV- 2 DNA. The prevalence of the virus in 4 sheep breeds from various regions in South Africa was shown to be 77 %. No statistically {{significant difference was found}} amongst the sheep breeds tested...|$|R
30|$|For the Maasai of Tanzania, rangelands are {{classified}} into upland (Osopuko), dry valley bottomlands (Olpurkel) and valley slopes (Oldoinyo) (Oba and Kaitira 2006). These patchy landscape classifications help determine seasonally dependent grazing patterns which are adapted to variability and unpredictability (Niamir-Fuller 1998) and inform a well-documented grazing reserve system employed by Maasai {{to cope with}} climate uncertainty (Mwilawa et al. 1996). Paired with robust knowledge of range plants, Maasai are able to select pastures based on vegetation compositions most favoured by livestock while avoiding areas less desirable (Sindiga 1994). Rangeland health is often assessed via indicators of body condition, productivity and health of livestock. For instance, pastoralists across Kenya’s rangelands judge pasture conditions based on livestock attributes (rumen-fill, coat condition, milk production, weight gain, etc.), while grazing suitability is based on environmental factors such as forage availability, water access, predator risk, disease and parasite loads (Kipuri 1996; Wasonga et al. 2003). This knowledge helps to prescribe decision-making on whether and when to move herds to better pasture, introduce fire or split the herds to distribute risk. Maasai also use wildlife to aid in selecting grazing areas (Goldman 2007). For instance, wildebeest are especially important as indicators for rainfall patterns but also dictate suitable pastures during the wildebeest calving season when the deadly <b>malignant</b> <b>catarrh</b> fever can be transmitted to cattle and when large grass reserves are finished by migrating animals (Butt 2011). Other pastoral groups throughout Africa share similar methods of environmental monitoring, interpreting indicators {{of plant and animal}} interaction, fire ecology and cultural queues (Oba et al. 2008; Niamir-Fuller 1998).|$|R
40|$|The {{epizootiology}} of malignant {{catarrhal fever}} (MCF) in buffaloes and cattle in India is reported. Successful experimental transmission from natural MCF cases to buffalo calves was made in two serial passages. Attempts to infect the rabbits and to isolate a viral agent in bovine thyroid and other tissue cultures failed. Blood, tissue cultures, postmortem examination, cattle, buffaloes, experimental tram-mission. <b>Bovine</b> <b>malignant</b> catarrhal fever (MCF) has been recognised {{in various parts of}} the world (Blood and Henderson 1974). In India, while describing the first authenticated report of MCF Parihar et al. (1975) indicated that the disease was recorded as early as 1941 on the basis of the course and postmortem lesions in cattle and goats (Annual Reports, Imperial Veterinary Research Institute, 1941 - 42, 42 - 46) and on the clinical evidence in a Jersey Sindhi cross bred bull by Gnanaprakasam (1969). This paper describes the epizootiology of the disease in India and experimental transmission of MCF to healthy buffalo calves from natural cases of MCF in buffaloes and cattle and limited attempts to isolate virus in rabbits and in various primary tissue cultures...|$|R
40|$|Foi realizado um estudo retrospectivo de 14 focos de febre catarral maligna (FCM) em bovinos, detectados nos anos de 1999 - 2011, a partir dos arquivos da Seção Anatomia Patológica da Divisão de Laboratórios Veterinários (DILAVE) "Miguel C. Rubino" Montevideo. Foram analisados os dados epidemiológicos, apresenta��ão clínica e lesões macroscópicas e histopatológicas. Para a detecção do herpesvírus ovino tipo 2 (OvHV- 2) foi utilizada a técnica de PCR sobre as amostras do sistema nervoso central de bovinos de 12 focos. Os surtos ocorreram principalmente nos meses de primavera e verão, na região norte do país. Em 64 % (9 / 14) dos focos ocorreram episódios individuais da enfermidade, enquanto que os casos coletivos foram 5, nos quais a morbidade e mortalidade oscilaram entre 2 % e 5 %, sendo a letalidade 100 % em todos os relatos. Em 50 % dos surtos foi confirmado o contato direto entre bovinos e ovinos, enquanto no restante não havia tal informação. Clinicamente predominaram os sinais de opacidade {{bilateral}} da córnea, conjuntivite, secreção nasal e ocular mucopurulenta, assim como a síndrome nervosa. Os achados de necropsia mais frequentes foram opacidade bilateral da córnea e lesões inflamatórias nas mucosas. Os achados histopatológicos caracterizaram-se por panvasculite necrótica sistêmica. Foi possível detectar o agente etiológico por PCR em 5 dos 12 casos analisados. A {{retrospective study}} of 14 outbreaks of <b>malignant</b> <b>catarrh</b> fever (MCF) in cattle detected between 1999 and 2011 was performed {{based upon the}} files of the DILAVE "Miguel C. Rubino" Montevideo Pathology Laboratory. Epidemiological data, clinical presentation, gross and histopathological lesions were analyzed. PCR was used on central nervous system samples of 12 bovines {{for the detection of}} ovine herpesvirus type 2 (OvHV- 2). The outbreaks occurred mainly in spring and summer in the northern region of the country. Sixty four percent (9 / 14) were individual episodes of the disease while five cases were collective, with morbidity and mortality rates were 2 - 5 %, being the lethality 100 % in all the reports. In 50 % of the outbreaks the direct contact between cattle and sheep was confirmed, while there was not such information {{in the rest of the}} cases. Predominant clinical signs were bilateral corneal opacity, conjunctivitis, ocular and nasal mucopurulent discharge, and nervous syndrome. The most frequent necropsy findings were bilateral corneal opacity and inflammatory lesions in the mucosa. Histopathological findings were characterized by systemic necrotizing panvasculite. It was possible to detect the etiological agent by PCR in 5 out of 12 cases examined...|$|R
5000|$|Although these cattle {{were and}} are an {{important}} part of the pastoral economy of Africa, Diane Gifford-Gonzalez and others have found that cattle domestication in Eastern and Southern Africa was delayed by as much as a millennium past everywhere else. The tentative date for domestication of cattle is set around 9000 BP. Archaeologists that work at sites dating back to the 10th millennia; such as Nabta Playa, claim that cattle remains found at their sites come from domestic cattle. The basis of these archaeologist arguments is that cattle are not usually found with certain kinds of desert-adapted animals that they are also finding at these sites. Even so, Gifford-Gonzalez is not entirely sure that the genetic findings should be fully trusted as there is a wide-margin for errors in the findings. This delay occurred even though the ancestor of the modern, domestic cattle was originally from northern Africa. One cause of this delay may have been the uncharacteristically wet-period that went through eastern Africa from 12,500-7000 BP, where rainfall was 35% higher than it is today. This wet period caused all the lakes and rivers to rise dramatically and changed all the flora of the area so that they were less grassland-like and more forest-like. Once the rainfall dropped to more modern levels in 3000 BP, pastoralism picked up as well. Along with the steadying of the rains, there is also evidence of Nderit ceramics that appears in south-central Kenya between 5000 BP and 4000 BP. Nderit pottery found south of Lake Turkana is usually associated with local hunter-gatherers. Local hunter-gatherers may have adopted these ceramics and a few domestic animals while still practicing their hunting-and-gathering lifestyles. Another cause for the delay could have been due to disease of the cattle, such as <b>Bovine</b> <b>Malignant</b> Catarrhal Fever (MCF), which is almost 100% lethal for cattle. Another problem she found was the diseases that affect humans, such as Rift Valley Fever (RVF), East Coast Fever (ECF), foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), and trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness). As of right now, it is impossible to tell if coming into contact with cattle caused epidemics of unfamiliar diseases.|$|R
40|$|Bovine {{lymphosarcoma}} (BLS) is {{a common}} neoplasm found in both dairy and beef cattle. It is important for veterinarians, dairy producers and beef producers to gain {{a thorough understanding of}} BLS. The 2 ̆ 7 first step in understanding BLS is to define the disease. Bovine leukosis, bovine leukemia, <b>bovine</b> lymphoma, and <b>malignant</b> lymphoma are misnomers that add confusion and frustration in understanding the disease process of BLS. There are currently four distinct forms of BLS: calf form, thymic form, skin form, and adult or bovine leukemia virus (BLV) associated form. In understanding these forms of BLS {{it is important to know}} what clinical signs to look for, how to make the diagnosis, the treatment options and recommendations for prevention and control...|$|R
40|$|The {{principal}} aims of {{the work}} presented in this thesis were to investigate the biochemical properties and protein compositions of nasal secretion (NS) from healthy cattle and to document changes in the protein expression in NS from diseased and vaccinated cattle using advanced proteomic methods. Bovine respiratory disease (BRD) is the principal source of economic loss for the cattle industry throughout the world. Even though it has been studied extensively, it still remains the number one cause of disease and death in cattle. Although the etiopathogenesis of BRD is multifactorial and complex, all of the pathogens have the common route of infection which is intranasal. Thus, NS is potentially a valuable source of biological sample in the detection of biomarkers for BRD. Therefore, a method for the collection of substantial volumes of NS from cattle was developed in this study to establish a reference range of analytes that {{are present in the}} NS of healthy cattle. Biochemical profiles of NS from a group of 38 healthy Holstein-Friesian cows revealed high alkaline phosphatase (AP) activity of up to 2392 IU/L which is 15. 7 fold higher compared to AP activity in serum reference ranges. This study further investigated the source of the high AP activity in bovine NS. Histochemical analysis using AP specific staining confirmed the localization of the AP enzyme activity to epithelial cells and serous glands of the nasal mucosa. Advanced molecular methods were used to determine the characterization of nasal AP. The analysis at mRNA levels from nasal mucosa by endpoint RT-PCR and PCR product sequencing confirmed that the AP was locally produced and is identical at the nucleotide level to the non-specific AP splice variant gene (ALPL) found in bovine liver, bone and kidney. Investigation using isoelectric focussing (IEF) confirmed that AP was produced locally at a high level in nasal epithelium demonstrating that novel AP isoenzymes in NS had pIs in the same range as those of the nasal mucosa extracts (pH 4. 8 - 6. 2) but were clearly different from the extracts of other tissues. The differences in IEF migration of the AP extracts is likely to be due to post translational modifications (PTMs) such as glycosylation or phosphorylation which would be areas worthy of future research. Preliminary proteomic investigation of NS from healthy cattle using 1 D gel electrophoresis, 2 D gel electrophoresis and ESI-MS/MS analysis putatively identified 10 major proteins in NS consisting of 7 vascular proteins and other glandular and cellular proteins such as lactoferrin, an anti-bacterial protein commonly present in mucosal secretions, odorant binding protein known to have a role in scent recognition and glutathione-S-transferase, an enzyme capable of detoxifying noxious compounds. The final objective was therefore to compare the nasal proteins from healthy, disease and vaccinated group of animals using 2 D difference gel electrophoresis (DiGE). The experimental model used for this investigation was an immunisation study against <b>bovine</b> <b>malignant</b> catarrhal fever (MCF). It was concluded that quantitative proteomics technology such as DiGE identified and measured changes in nasal protein expression in response to MCF and following vaccine protection. In conclusion, this research has contributed to the scientific knowledge regarding the biochemical properties and protein compositions that is present in bovine NS. In addition, the research also explored the use of proteomic technologies as a novel tool to analyse protein expression and identify possible biomarkers in NS. This thesis is an important step forward for a better understanding of bovine NS, and thus provides a basis for future studies involving bovine NS by way of providing reference data and alternative source of biological sample. </p...|$|R
40|$|For {{the past}} 40 years, antiangiogenic {{approaches}} {{have been of}} major interest {{in the development of}} methods to cure and prevent cancer. Angiogenesis, the development of blood vessels from pre-existing vascularization, is essential for cancer growth and spread of metastasis through the delivery of nutrients and oxygen essential to sustain the metabolic activity of these malignant cells. Blocking access to blood will cause cancerous cells to assume a dormant state creating inactive micro-tumors innocuous to the host. Angiostatin, the internal fragment of the fibrinolytic zymogen plasminogen, has shown great potential in reducing cancer size and number of metastatic colonies in animal models. Owing to the success of these preliminary results angiostatin is currently on clinical trials. Plasminogen is known to be transferred from blood to milk during lactation. The objectives of this research were to: 1) investigate the ability of various proteases in cleaving plasminogen, both from human and bovine sources, and consequently release the angiostatin like fragment; 2) determine the anticancer activity of bovine angiostatin; 3) examine ability of the antiangiogenic fragment to survive digestion; 4) purify the fragment of interest through column chromatography. Production of angiostatin was tested through hydrolysis of plasminogen via Bacillus Polymyxa protease (or dispase I), elastase, lactic acid bacteria and Bacilli originated enzymes. Once proteases capable of angiostatin like peptide production were identified, and sequence analysis of the fragments obtained conducted to confirm that bovine angiostatin was indeed produced, ability of angiostatin, both human and <b>bovine,</b> in inhibiting <b>malignant</b> melanoma as well as colon cancer cells was evaluated in vitro. From the results obtained we can confirm that bovine angiostatin inhibitory activity on cancerous cells is similar to that observed for human angiostatin. Analysis of bovine angiostatin survival through in vitro human digestion model was also examined. Results show good possibility of angiostatin surviving digestion, even if confirmation of these results is required through further in vivo studies. Additionally, digestive enzymes such as trypsin and α-chymotrypsin showed ability in cleaving plasminogen directly to release a 25 kDa fragment. Knowing that each kringle has some degree of anticancer activity it would be of interest to further study the possibility of angiostatin related fragments to be produced during milk digestion. Finally, affinity chromatography through L-lysine used to purify human angiostatin resulted to be an adequate method for bovine angiostatin purification. Preliminary results obtained from this study open a new area worth investigating to uncover the potential of using bovine angiostatin in the development of novel food products capable of cancer prevention...|$|R
