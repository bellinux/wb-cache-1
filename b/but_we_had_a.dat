5|$|I {{think that}} the band went on... maybe not a tangent, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> goal in mind, {{and at the end}} of the {{recording}} process, we were so proud of how artistic we were. And I think we showed too much. I think maybe we were a little too jaded and a little too dark, and I {{think that the}} lack of hope and faith that we put on this record made us a little less sparkly and light to people. But I think that it's all part of our evolution. We all went a bit too far.|$|E

In Delhi, Lennon and Harrison told the reporters {{that they had}} urgent business in London {{and they did not}} want to appear in the Maharishi's film. Back in the UK the band members said that they were disillusioned by the Maharishi's desire for financial gain. McCartney said that [...] "Rishikesh was a good experience. I enjoyed it". Lennon said on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson, [...] "We believe in meditation, but not the Maharishi and his scene", and, [...] "We made a mistake. He's human like the rest of us". Lennon went on to say: [...] "I don't know what level he's on <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> nice holiday in India and came back rested." ...|$|E
500|$|In May 2012, Malcolm Young {{confirmed}} that the band were working on a potential follow-up to 2008's Black Ice. But he warned that fans were in for a longer wait than expected, after lead singer Brian Johnson suggested there would be new material the next year. Malcolm stated, [...] "You know what Brian's like. He just says things and then walks away. It'll be a little while– {{a year or two}} anyway. I've been doing some jamming on some song ideas but I do that all the time, as do the rest of the band. We are still working. <b>But</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> long rest between Stiff Upper Lip and Black Ice, so I think we need a couple of years to recuperate and work on it a bit more." ...|$|E

500|$|Afterward, Johnson began celebrating {{his fifth}} {{consecutive}} Sprint Cup Series championship. During the celebration, Johnson's crew chief, Chad Knaus commented, [...] "I think finally, finally after pulling this off Jimmie {{will get the}} respect that he deserves. Knowing {{what we had to}} do— come down here and beat them— and we beat them." [...] Hamlin, the points leader before the race, described his disappointment by saying, [...] "I’m disappointed. Our car was lightning fast until that last wreck. When we hit the 16 (Biffle) that knocked the toe-in out. It wasn’t as fast after that. It’s just circumstances <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> great year. We won the most races (8) and we contended like we have never contended before but circumstances took us out of this one. I don’t think the 48 (Johnson) showed the strength this year like they did in the past and that opened the door for the rest of us." [...] Harvick, who finished third in points, stated: ...|$|E
500|$|Roth's fake trailer {{contained}} {{elements that}} almost earned Grindhouse an NC-17 rating, including a cheerleader simultaneously stripping, bouncing on a trampoline and getting {{stabbed in the}} vulva, and three decapitations; the first victim dressed as a pilgrim turkey at a parade gets decapitated and his headless body stumbles around in a exaggerated manner, the second occurs as the victim's girlfriend performs fellatio on him, and the last decapitation occurs on a man while he is being kissed by a female victim. According to Roth, [...] "Instead of seeing it spread out in a feature, watching it all jammed together non-stop makes it more shocking. <b>But</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> great discussion with the ratings board. They got it. Once they saw it with all the bad splices and the distress and scratches they were fine with it." [...] Roth confirmed {{in an interview with}} Cinema Blend's Eric Eisenberg that he and co-writer Jeff Rendell are working on a possible feature film.|$|E
500|$|Liverpool's victory {{meant they}} won the FA Cup for the seventh time, the club's manager Rafael Benítez stated that neither side {{deserved}} to lose the match: [...] "It was difficult to say we deserved to win or the other team. It was a magnificent final. We knew that they could score goals but that we could also. We needed to keep going but after 63 games it was really difficult." [...] Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard also praised West Ham, stating: [...] "West Ham were brilliant, they gave us a really good game <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> never-say-die attitude and we stuck in there, our best chance was on penalties as {{we did not have}} any energy left." [...] Due {{to the nature of the}} comeback, the match has come to be regarded as The Gerrard Final, teammate Peter Crouch summed up the effect Gerrard had on the match: [...] "When the injury-time board went up we thought our chance had gone, but it is always good to have a player like Steven Gerrard in your team." [...] A BBC Sport poll in May 2015 deemed Gerrard's goal to be the best in an FA Cup Final from the past 50 years.|$|E

500|$|According to Scully, [...] "Kill the Alligator and Run" [...] {{is often}} cited by fans of The Simpsons {{as one of the}} worst episodes ever because of its {{structure}} and outlandish nature. Scully has said that the episode is [...] "kind of three stories in one." [...] Meyer, a writer and producer on the show, said in the DVD audio commentary that the fans thought it was [...] "kind of a frenetic and crazy, chaotic episode," [...] adding: [...] "I can't disagree. <b>But</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> lot of fun writing it, and we stand by it." [...] While reviewing the eleventh season of The Simpsons, DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson commented on the episode, writing: [...] "Wow – this may be the most jumbled Simpsons to date! The episode seems to suffer from ADD as it can’t focus on any topic for very long. It flits from one gag to another with abandon and rarely makes much sense – or produces many laughs. Yeah, it has a few amusing moments, but it’s too scattershot to succeed." [...] Annie Alleman of The Herald News, on the other hand, named [...] "Kill the Alligator and Run" [...] her eighth favorite Simpsons episode. Nancy Basile of About.com thought the best scene of the episode is the one where the Simpsons have become hillbillies and are sitting on their porch, and Bart says [...] "I'm getting used to this country life. Teacher says I'm whittling at a tenth-grade level." [...] Corey Deiterman of the Houston Press listed Kid Rock at number one in his list of the top five worst musical guests in Simpsons history.|$|E

2500|$|Jimmy Eat World {{began writing}} Damage in early 2012, with vocalist and guitarist Jim Adkins noting: [...] "I think with [...] Invented [...] an outline {{that it would}} be themed around. Not {{necessarily}} a subject, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> direction before we wrote it. As you get older it's more interesting to have a theme that everything tries to support – I would say this album [...] has a theme. I would describe it as an attempt at making an adult breakup record. The consequences to what the characters are going through are more significant. There's just more to it. I'm 37 and the world around me is a lot different than when I was writing breakup songs in my 20s. I tried to reflect that in what the lyrics are." [...] Adkins elaborated: [...] "With Damage the point was love songs. But the type of love songs that interest me deal with adversity and emotional injury. If you have a happy song about how happy you are, I just want to slap you. There's no story there for me. I can't have any empathy." ...|$|E
2500|$|The band gained further {{exposure}} {{when their}} 2007 single, [...] "Apologize", was re-mixed and re-released on Timbaland's compilation album, Timbaland Presents Shock Value. The remix became an international chart {{hit in the}} fall of 2007. The song broke records after gaining 10,331 spins in one week. According to SoundScan, [...] "Apologize" [...] is the most legally downloaded song in US digital history with sales of over 4.3 million digital downloads in the US alone. It is also the second best-selling song of the decade. OneRepublic's debut album, Dreaming Out Loud, includes both the song's original version and version with Timbaland, and was released on November 20, 2007 on Timbaland's Mosley Music Group imprint via Interscope Records. The band had previously been signed to Columbia Records, and their album was due to be released in 2006, but this did not occur. Tedder explained, [...] "Crap happened. People got fired. Labels merged and politics abounded". Subsequently, the band was released from their deal with Columbia, and they were signed by Timbaland in the summer of 2006 becoming the first rock band to be signed to Mosley Music Group. Tedder has commented on the success of his band's hit single, [...] "Apologize": [...] "The toughest thing to do is write a hit song, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> hit song before we had an album... What has happened has been really strange and really great." [...] Lately they have performed on The Voice, a singing competition, and have also performed on The Ellen Show singing their hit songs Love Runs Out and Counting Stars.|$|E
