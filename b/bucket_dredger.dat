50|$|A {{variety of}} {{implements}} were constructed {{for use with}} ploughing engines. The most common were the balance plough and the cultivator - ploughing and cultivating being the most physically demanding jobs to do on an arable farm. Other implements could include a mole drainer, used to create an underground drainage channel or pipe, or a <b>dredger</b> <b>bucket</b> for dredging rivers or moats.|$|R
40|$|Heavy mineral {{deposits}} such as rutile, ilmenite, zircon and monazite are of placer origin, and {{are mostly}} found as either beach or dune sand deposits. Dredge mining {{has been used}} to exploit such deposits over the decades as it is the most economical and feasible mining method applicable for such mineral accumulations throughout the world. Dune sand deposits are mined by means of suction cutter or <b>bucket</b> wheel <b>dredgers</b> operating in artificial channels or ponds when sufficient water is available. The sluicing is often used to control the stability of earthen slopes, while facilitating the dredging operation. The dredged material is pumped to a floating concentrator via a float line for the initial separation. Even though the sluicing process is essential and favourable for such a dredge mining operation, it complicates the task of the dredge mine reconciliation. This research aims to investigate all possible factors that affect dredge mine reconciliation discrepancies and to develop an enhanced dredge mine reconciliation model, with the aid of sonar and laser profiling technologies in conjunction with sampling and testing of heavy minerals. The variation of material on the workface up to the water level is monitored by conducting workface surveys using laser profiling technology. The movement and accumulation of material underwater is monitored by conducting sonar soundings, and the dredge retreat programs are planned accordingly. Production by the dredger is recorded online as the dredger throughput. This process is used to reconcile the dredged material quantitatively. In addition, sampling of material upstream and downstream of the dredger is done on a regular basis, and tested for physical properties and heavy minerals content. The results of the laboratory testing program reveals that the physical properties of material also affect the mine reconciliation discrepancies, as the gravity separation of heavy minerals takes place during the sluicing process. An enhanced ore reserve estimation model for the current dredge mining area is also developed by means of the latest geostatistical software to improve mine reconciliation. Sonar and laser profiling technologies, in conjunction with sampling and testing of heavy minerals, can effectively be utilised to improve dredge mine reconciliation in the heavy minerals sand mining industry...|$|R
40|$|T {{here was}} a time when the foothillsof California bustled with {{activity}}. The lure of gold, copper and other treasures sent men into the earth in droves, so that it often seemed there was more activity under the ground than at the surface. Tools and machinery were needed to make the mining possible. Stamp mills, hoist works, pumps, ore cars, <b>dredger</b> <b>buckets,</b> rock crushers, and many other types of equipment had to be manufactured. If the mines were to operate, so must a foundry to cast the metal parts and a shop to machine them to final form. And this is where our story begins. Patent drawing for water wheel with signatures. Historic Knight Foundry, in Sutter Creek California, is believed to be the only remaining water powered foundry and machine shop in the United States. Originally formed as Campbell, Hall & Co., the foundry was established in 1873 to better fill the ever growing needs of the Mother Lode mines, and to produce the patented Knight water wheel. Samuel FOUNDRY & MACHINE SHOP OF Knight, a partner with Campbell and HallKNIGHT & CO. SUTTERR CREEK, CAL. Samuel Knight and crew at the beginning of their foundry venture, circa 1895. later bought them out with his new partner George Horne. Knight, a ship’s carpenter, had worked at mine construction sites in Calaveras and Amador counties, where he had begun to develop a more efficient water wheel...|$|R

In 1802 a steam-driven <b>bucket</b> <b>dredger</b> {{was brought into}} service at Woolwich (prior to this, convicts {{had been used to}} dredge the quayside by hand) but still the silting persisted, there and at Deptford; the result being that the constrained riverside dockyards began to be wound down in favour of the ever-expanding yards at Portsmouth and Devonport.|$|E
50|$|There {{are several}} boat wrecks in the harbour. One {{of these is}} a tug dating from 8 May 1941. The tug named the Irishman was sunk by a {{magnetic}} mine and now rests partially submerged at low tide. A slightly older wreck dating from 1926 is a <b>Bucket</b> <b>dredger</b> named the Withern. Of unrecorded age is {{the wreck of the}} Excelsior an 80-foot long barge. The harbour also contains a wrecked landing craft that rests with its bows almost permanently above the surface.|$|E
50|$|The former mine {{known as}} Grube Gotthold is located about 2 {{kilometres}} {{west of the}} village of Hohenleipisch in the German state of Brandenburg. The Lusatian Lower Seam (Unterflöz, 2nd Lusatian seam horizon, middle Miocene) reaches a thickness here of 2.7 to 4.0 metres. The pit was opened on 22 March 1912 and brown coal was initially mined underground. A narrow gauge pit railway transported the coal to the loading ramp of the Upper Lusatian Gravel and Sand Works (Oberlausitzer Kies- und Sandwerke, OKS) about 3 kilometres away in Biehla. An entry in the companies register on 17 January 1913 records the Gotthold Brown Coal Mine (Braunkohlengrube Gotthold). The first managers of the business, which had its head office in Elsterwerda and a share capital of initially 39,000 marks, were Paul Freitag and Franz Kotik. By 1913 the pit had reached its peak brown coal production of 20,860 tonnes. From 1914, open cast mining became increasingly important alongside underground mining operations. As well as brown coal the mine also extracted crystalline quartz sand. From 1916 to 1919 a steam excavator (Dampflöffelbagger) was used; it was replaced in 1920 by a <b>bucket</b> <b>dredger</b> (Eimerkettenbagger) with a maximum carrying capacity of 150 m³/h.|$|E
40|$|The {{underwater}} mining {{has increased}} {{in the recent years}} and the growing awareness of the potential impacts on the environment, as results of increasing the encroachment on the marine environment. Therefore, the debate has increased about how to protect this environment by using the scientific research thatś relevant to the various environmental effects and developing the equipment used in dredging. There is a wide diversity of underwater mining equipments, such as continuous and non-continuous dredging which used for production of sand, gravel, alluvial deposits and raw material. There are a relation between increasingly dredging activities in the recent years and their impacts on the aquatic environment. These impacts are causes by changes in the topography of the sea floor such as turbidity, noise and other environmental impacts. Today, there is an international framework of legislation which has been developed for dredging projects. This contains rules and regulations which must be followed by mining companies and have to implemented by national authorities. The European countries also develop their legislation to control on the dredged material which deposit on land and sea. This legislation is constantly changing related to scientific knowledge and increasing the implementation frameworks. Also, the people become more sensitive to emissions that have a negative attitude towards dredging in the neighborhood. In addition, dredging techniques give rise to objections, which eventually led to think in more environmentally-friendly production methods. After that, the use of dredger is the only alternative in some project. The question is what are the true benefits of these techniques and what is the relation between possible improvements and technological potential as well as the costs. Therefore, it is intended to assess mining techniques {{in the context of their}} environmental impact and the costs. There are many systematic approaches which have been used for evaluation and determination of the environmental performances of different dredging equipment, techniques and procedures. Moreover, the new future developments and latest proposals in the dredging industry have been presented. Also, the new proposal to reduce the turbidity and suspended material effect which is the most important environmental impacts during dredging operations has presented. This research work gives a description of underwater mining techniques and different way of evaluating the dredging equipment’s in term of environmental, economic and social aspects. Also, this work presents two different methods of evaluation. The first approach is the statistical analyses method by using the modern Fuzzy evaluation concept. The second slant is a mathematical accounting method by using the information from the Egyptian case study, in order to reach the most environmental-friendly dredging techniques by taking into account the economic and social point of views. The final evaluation showed that the suction and <b>bucket</b> ladder <b>dredger</b> are the best choices. The assessment was made after comparing many parameters such as performance, characteristics, working depth, soil types and project area. Also, this work presents two different new practices for extraction of the underwater placer deposits which occur on the Egyptian Mediterranean coast. The first technique uses floating processing unit in the in situ area, which gets the extracted material and treated it to reduce the transportation costs. The second technique has divided the working area to many stages which make the suction dredger used also for transporting the material into the beach. The pipeline will be the best method of transportation by using the power of suction, which reduce also the transportation costs and also avoid the environmental effects...|$|R
