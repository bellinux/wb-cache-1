40|$|AbstractA 4 -year-old female was {{referred}} to our institution with acute pancreatitis due to a choledochal cyst. A protein plug {{was found to be}} deeply impacted in the main pancreatic duct. She underwent preoperative endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) followed by sphincteroplasty and extraction of the protein plug with a <b>basket</b> <b>extractor.</b> After the ERCP procedure, the patient successfully underwent total choledochal cyst excision with Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy. In cases in which a huge protein plug is located deep in the pancreatic duct, therapeutic ERCP is useful as preoperative management for choledochal cyst excision with hepaticojejunostomy...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: The {{occurrence}} of urolithiasis in pregnancy represents {{a challenge in}} both {{diagnosis and treatment of}} this condition, because it presents risks not only to the mother but also to the fetus. Surgical treatment may be indicated for patients with infection, persistent pain, and obstruction of a solitary kidney. We present our experience on the management of pregnant patients with ureteral calculi and a review of the literature. Materials and Methods: The charts of 19 pregnant patients with obstructive ureteral calculi were retrospectively reviewed. Gestational age ranged from 13 to 33 weeks. In all patients, ureteral stone was diagnosed on abdominal ultrasound. In regard to localization, 15 calculi were in the distal ureter, 3 in the proximal ureter, and 1 in the interior of an ureterocele. Calculi size ranged from 6 to 10 mm (mean, 8 mm). The following criteria were used to indicate ureteroscopy: persistent pain with no improvement after clinical treatment, increase in renal dilation, or presence of uterine contractions. Nine patients (47. 3 %) were submitted to ureteroscopy. All calculi (100 %) were removed with a stone <b>basket</b> <b>extractor</b> under continuous endoscopic vision. None of the calculi demanded the use of a lithotriptor. Results: Nine patients (47. 3 %) treated with clinical measurements presented no obstetric complications and spontaneous elimination of the calculi. Nine patients (47. 3 %) submitted to ureteroscopy had no surgical complications. There was remission of pain in all cases after ureteroscopy and ureteral catheter placement. Conclusion: The diagnosis and treatment of ureteral lithiasis in pregnant women present potential risks for the fetus and the mother. Conservative management is the first option, but ureteroscopy may be performed with safety and high success rates...|$|E
5000|$|The modern {{process of}} water removal by {{spinning}} {{did not come}} into use until electric motors were developed. Spinning requires a constant high-speed power source, and was originally done in a separate device known as an [...] "extractor". A load of washed laundry would be transferred from the wash tub to the <b>extractor</b> <b>basket,</b> and the water spun out in a separate operation. These early extractors were often dangerous to use, since unevenly distributed loads would cause the machine to shake violently. Many {{efforts were made to}} counteract the shaking of unstable loads, such as mounting the spinning basket on a free-floating shock-absorbing frame to absorb minor imbalances, and a bump switch to detect severe movement and stop the machine so that the load could be manually redistributed.|$|R
