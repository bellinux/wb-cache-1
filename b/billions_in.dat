With the US assistance, the Greek military won its civil war. Under the leadership of Alcide De Gasperi the Italian Christian Democrats defeated the powerful Communist-Socialist alliance in the elections of 1948.

5|$|Those {{affected}} by the flood received donations from across the nation, along with <b>billions</b> <b>in</b> federal aid. City officials and flood-forecasters were criticized for the difference in estimates and actual flood levels. Fargo, Grand Forks, and East Grand Forks built new dikes to prevent damage from future floods and the Greater Grand Forks area began to rebuild around the river, developing a campground recreation area, park, and shopping districts where homes once stood.|$|E

5|$|Due {{to a low}} {{supply of}} petrol, bus traffic was {{replaced}} by electric tramways during the war. The trams experienced therefore an increase in ridership, from 64 million passengers per year in 1939 to 151 million in 1944. The three lines of Holmenkolbanen had together a ridership of 9.5billion in 1939, 10.9billions in 1940, 21 <b>billions</b> <b>in</b> 1943 and at the peak 22.6 billion passengers in 1945. In addition to the regular tram passenger services, Oslo Sporveier started to transport goods across the city in tram wagons.|$|E
5|$|Many {{executives}} at Enron were indicted {{for a variety}} of charges and some were later sentenced to prison. Enron's auditor, Arthur Andersen, was found guilty in a United States District Court of illegally destroying documents relevant to the SEC investigation which voided its license to audit public companies, effectively closing the business. By the time the ruling was overturned at the U.S. Supreme Court, the company had lost the majority of its customers and had ceased operating. Enron employees and shareholders received limited returns in lawsuits, despite losing <b>billions</b> <b>in</b> pensions and stock prices. As a consequence of the scandal, new regulations and legislation were enacted to expand the accuracy of financial reporting for public companies. One piece of legislation, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, increased penalties for destroying, altering, or fabricating records in federal investigations or for attempting to defraud shareholders. The act also increased the accountability of auditing firms to remain unbiased and independent of their clients.|$|E

25|$|In {{the case}} of Louisiana in 1948, Perez urged Long to reject the Truman administration's {{proposal}} of payment for these areas, which would have greatly enhanced state revenues. Perez wanted to seek a better arrangement by taking the conflict over jurisdiction before the United States Supreme Court, but Louisiana lost its case. The Louisiana Attorney General, Bolivar Edwards Kemp Jr., and the lieutenant governor, Bill Dodd, later said that the state should have accepted the Truman administration offer and that not doing so cost <b>billions</b> <b>in</b> lost revenues over ensuing decades.|$|E

25|$|The {{privatization}} largely shifted {{control of}} enterprises from state agencies to individuals with inside {{connections in the}} government. Many of the newly rich moved <b>billions</b> <b>in</b> cash and assets outside {{of the country in}} an enormous capital flight. The depression of the economy led to the collapse of social services; the birth rate plummeted while the death rate skyrocketed. Millions plunged into poverty, from a level of 1.5% in the late Soviet era to 39–49% by mid-1993. The 1990s saw extreme corruption and lawlessness, the rise of criminal gangs and violent crime.|$|E
25|$|CIA {{estimates}} put {{the depletion}} of the Middle East oilfields at just two years away. The total worldwide demand for oil is more than 50% of estimated supplies and while nuclear and other alternative energies {{are trying to make}} up the difference they are coming up short. Canada is now the exclusive supplier of electricity to 15 states in the northeast after investing <b>billions</b> <b>in</b> a massive new hydro-electric power plant in Quebec. To make matters worse, a top-secret experimental sub developed by NUMA has recently discovered a stratigraphic trap, potentially the richest kind of oil deposit, which lies just across the border in the territorial waters of Quebec.|$|E
25|$|Li began two megaprojects {{when he was}} the Premier. He {{initiated}} the construction of the Three Gorges Dam on 14 December 1994, and later began preparations for the Shenzhou Manned Space Program. Both programs were subject to much controversy within China and abroad. The Shenzhou program was especially criticized due to its extraordinary cost (tens of billions of dollars) in a country that sometimes referred to itself as a Third World nation. Many economists and humanitarians suggested that those <b>billions</b> <b>in</b> capital might be better invested in helping the Chinese population deal with economic hardships and improvement in the China's education, health services, and legal system.|$|E

In that short period, the Biomedical industry grew to account for over 5% of Singapore's GDP and 10,600 high value added jobs. In addition, Yeo also pointed out that during the 5 years of investment, more than 25 companies started research centres in Singapore, including three corporate R laboratories run by Eli Lilly and Company, GlaxoSmithKline and Novartis.|$|E
25|$|The ongoing {{demand for}} well-educated workers {{continued}}. Housing prices {{in urban areas}} continued to increase so that a modest home that in the 1960s cost $25,000, cost {{half a million dollars}} or more in urban areas by 2005. More people commuted longer hours to afford a home in more rural areas while earning larger salaries in the urban areas. Speculators bought houses they never intended to live in, expecting to make a huge profit in a matter of months, then rolling it over by buying more properties. Mortgage companies were compliant, as everyone assumed the prices would keep rising. The bubble burst in 2007-8 as housing prices began to crash and the boom years ended. Hundreds of <b>billions</b> <b>in</b> property values vanished and foreclosures soared as many financial institutions and investors were badly hurt.|$|E
25|$|Owing to its notoriety and {{invasive}} behaviour, red imported {{fire ants}} {{are considered to}} be pests. In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration estimates more than $5 billion is spent annually on medical treatment, damage, and control in infested areas. They can also cause $2.5 billion in damages annually in just 20 years. In Texas alone, red imported fire ants caused $300 million in damages for livestock, wildlife and public health. Approximately $36 per American household, and more than $250 million has been spent to control and eradicate red imported fire ants. Private agencies spend $25 to $40 million on pesticides annually. Unsuccessful eradication in Australia may cost the economy <b>billions</b> <b>in</b> damages annually and, based on a Queensland government study, the estimated cost could reach $43 billion over 30 years.|$|E

25|$|It is {{described}} in various novels that the Culture is extremely reluctant to go to war, though it may start to prepare for it long before its actual commencement. In the Idiran-Culture War (possibly {{one of the most}} hard-fought wars for the normally extremely superior Culture forces), various star systems, stellar regions and many orbital habitats were overrun by the Idirans before the Culture had converted enough of its forces to military footing. The Culture Minds had had enough foresight to evacuate almost all its affected citizens (apparently numbering in the many <b>billions)</b> <b>in</b> time before actual hostilities reached them. As shown in Player of Games, this is a standard Culture tactic, with its strong emphasis on protecting its citizens rather than sacrificing some of them for short-term goals.|$|E
25|$|The Philippines {{has been}} the most vocal against Chinese incursions in the dispute, even {{bringing}} its case against China to a United Nations international tribunal in the Hague, the first case filed by a nation against China. Vietnam, Japan, and other Western countries, especially the United States, have strongly supported the Philippines. Vietnam, bordered both by land and sea with China, has also claims all the Spratly Islands. This dispute focuses on the Paracel Islands, which China has occupied following the Battle of the Paracel Islands, in 1974. Brunei, claiming only one reef, has been silent on the issue ever since it began, mostly because of its trade with China. Malaysia, a nation with deep economic ties to China, and a nation with <b>billions</b> <b>in</b> Chinese investment, has remained neutral and 'China-friendly' over the conflict. This despite China claiming various reefs and islands in the Spratlys as well as most of its territorial waters and exclusive economic zones in Borneo.|$|E
