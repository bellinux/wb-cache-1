25|$|Other criticisms {{center around}} the broader {{environmental}} impact of irrigation on both the ecosystem around the vineyard {{as well as the}} added strain on global water resources. While advances in drip irrigation has reduced the amount of waste water produced by irrigation, the irrigation of substantial tracts of land in areas like the San Joaquin Valley in California and the Murray-Darling Basin of Australia requires massive amounts of water from dwindling supplies. In Australia, the centuries-old practice of flood irrigation used in places like the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area caused severe environmental damages from water-logging, increase salination and raising the water tables. In 2000, the Australian government invested over A$3.6 million into research on how to minimize the damage caused by extensive irrigation. In 2007, concerns about ecological damage to the Russian River caused government officials in California to take similar measures to cut <b>back</b> <b>water</b> supplies and promote more efficient irrigation practices.|$|E
25|$|While the Moores {{government}} {{was successful in}} implementing democratic reforms, his government had little impact on improving Newfoundland's economy. Much {{of his time in}} power was monopolized with completing unfinished industrial projects negotiated by Smallwood, many of which were unsuccessful. The government tried to re-negotiate the sale of Upper Churchill Hydro electricity to Hydro-Quebec, but was unsuccessful. In 1974, $160 million was paid the British Newfoundland Corporation (BRINCO) to buy <b>back</b> <b>water</b> rights and obtain a controlling interest in the Churchill Falls (Labrador) Corporation Limited, with hopes of developing hydro power on the Lower Churchill river. However, the {{government was}} not able to negotiate a transmission route across Quebec to sell power into the North American market. The Stephenville linerboard mill was another drain on government money and resources. By the time Moores took office in 1972, the mill's projected cost had increased from $75 million to $122 million, and government guarantees had more than doubled from $53 million to $110 million. The mill was losing $100 on every ton of linerboard it produced by 1976, and needed government subsidies to stay afloat. The province closed the mill, owned by the Crown corporation Labrador Linerboard Limited, in August 1977 and sold the mill to Abitibi-Price Ltd. for $43.5 million. The Come By Chance Refinery also cost the government millions of dollars in loans, including $60 million in 1975. The refinery was $42 million in debt to the province when it filed for bankruptcy in 1976.|$|E

500|$|The Marmes Rockshelter (also {{known as}} (45-FR-50)) is an archaeological site first {{excavated}} in 1962, near {{the confluence of}} the Snake and Palouse Rivers, in Franklin County, southeastern Washington. This rockshelter is remarkable in the level of preservation of organic materials, the depth of stratified deposits, and the apparent age of the associated Native American human remains. The site was discovered on the property of Roland Marmes, and was the site of the oldest human remains in North America at that time. In 1966, the site became, along with Chinook Point and the American and English Camps on San Juan Island, the first National Historic Landmarks listed in Washington. In 1969, the site was submerged in water when a levee protecting it from waters rising behind the then newly constructed Lower Monumental Dam, which was [...] down the Snake River, failed to hold <b>back</b> <b>water</b> that leaked into the protected area through gravel under the soil, creating Lake Herbert G.

2500|$|The {{most notable}} custom of the Fremen is their water conservation. Living {{in the desert}} with no natural sources of water has spurred the Fremen to ritualize and build their society around the collection, storage, and {{conservative}} use of all moisture. They conserve the water distilled from their dead, consider spitting an oath bond, and value tears as the greatest gift one can give to the dead. Dune suggests that the Fremen have adapted to the environment physiologically, with their blood able to clot almost instantly {{in order to prevent}} water loss. Leto II Atreides notes in Children of Dune (1976) that Fremen have a [...] "longer, larger" [...] large intestine [...] "to take <b>back</b> <b>water</b> from everything which came its way." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Williams Canal across De Soto Peninsula {{had been}} {{abandoned}} by Adm. Farragut and Brig. Gen. Williams in July 1862, but it {{had the potential to}} offer a route downriver that bypassed Vicksburg's guns. In late January 1863, Sherman's men, at the urging of Grant—who was advised by the navy that President Lincoln liked the idea—resumed digging. Sherman derisively called the work [...] "Butler's Ditch" [...] (since it was Maj. Gen. Benjamin Butler who had sent Williams upriver to do the work), which was barely 6 feet wide by 6 feet deep. Grant, undoubtedly influenced by Lincoln's continuous inquiries as to the status of the canal, ordered Sherman to expand the canal to 60 feet wide and 7 feet deep and the effort became known as Grant's Canal. It was not properly engineered based upon the hydrology of the Mississippi River, however, and a sudden rise in the river broke through the dam {{at the head of the}} canal and flooded the area. The canal began to fill up with <b>back</b> <b>water</b> and sediment. In a desperate effort to rescue the project, two huge steam-driven dipper dredges, Hercules and Sampson, attempted to clear the channel, but the dredges were exposed to Confederate artillery fire from the bluffs at Vicksburg and driven away. By late March, work on the canal was abandoned. (Remnants of about 200 yards of Grant's Canal are maintained by the Vicksburg National Military Park in Louisiana).|$|E

60|$|Full in this rapid wake, {{and many}} fathoms in the rear, swam a huge, humped old bull, which by his {{comparatively}} slow progress, {{as well as}} by the unusual yellowish incrustations over-growing him, seemed afflicted with the jaundice, or some other infirmity. Whether this whale belonged to the pod in advance, seemed questionable; for it is not customary for such venerable leviathans to be at all social. Nevertheless, he stuck to their wake, though indeed their <b>back</b> <b>water</b> must have retarded him, because the white-bone or swell at his broad muzzle was a dashed one, like the swell formed when two hostile currents meet. His spout was short, slow, and laborious; coming forth with a choking sort of gush, and spending itself in torn shreds, followed by strange subterranean commotions in him, which seemed to have egress at his other buried extremity, causing the waters behind him to upbubble.|$|E
