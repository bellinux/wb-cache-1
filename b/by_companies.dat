5|$|AMD chose a {{different}} direction, designing the less radical x86-64, a 64-bit extension {{to the existing}} x86 architecture, which Microsoft then supported, forcing Intel to introduce the same extensions in its own x86-based processors.

This architecture has now become the predominant 64-bit architecture in the desktop and portable market.

5|$|Each {{submarine}} {{was constructed}} in six sections, each consisting of several sub-sections. One of the main criteria {{of the project was}} that Australian industries contribute to at least 60% of the work; by the conclusion of the project 70% of the construction and 45% of the software preparation had been completed by Australian-owned companies. Work was sub-contracted out to 426companies across twelve countries, plus numerous sub-sub-contractors. In many cases, components for the first submarine were constructed <b>by</b> <b>companies</b> outside Australia, while those for the following five boats were replicated by an Australian-owned partner or subsidiary. The project prompted major increases in quality control standards across Australian industries: in 1980, only 35Australian companies possessed the appropriate quality control certifications for Defence projects, but by 1998 this had increased to over 1,500.|$|E
5|$|Other {{industries}} in the town included brick making and chimney pot manufacture. Raw materials were sourced from local collieries. In Mill Street carts, waggons, and bicycles were manufactured from 1855, and elsewhere motor vehicles were also produced until the late 1950s. John Cockerill moved to the town from Haslingden before leaving for continental Europe to become the founder of Cockerill-Sambre. James Cockerill, employed Radcliffe man William Yates as his manager. Several foundries and machine manufacturers were located around the town, including Dobson and Barlow at Bradley Fold, and Wolstenholme's along Bridgewater Street. Munitions, aircraft and tank components were manufactured during the Second World War. Chemicals were manufactured <b>by</b> <b>companies</b> such as Bealey's and J. & W. Whewell.|$|E
5|$|The breed {{remains very}} popular in the UK, with {{multiple}} winner at Cruft's, {{and is in the}} top third of all breeds in the US since the 1960s. It has been featured in television and film, including in Hamish Macbeth and in advertising <b>by</b> <b>companies</b> such as Cesar dog food and Scottish whisky Black & White. It is a medium-sized terrier, although with longer legs than other Scottish breeds of terrier. It has a white double coat of fur which fills out the dog's face, giving it a rounded appearance. The breed can be good with children, but does not always tolerate rough handling. The Westie is an active and intelligent breed, and is social with a high prey drive, as they were once used to hunt rodents.|$|E

Popular Japanese beverages such as sake, which is a brewed rice beverage that, typically, contains 15%~17% alcohol and is made by multiple fermentation of rice. Beer has been brewed in Japan since the late 1800s and is produced in many regions <b>by</b> <b>companies</b> including Asahi Breweries, Kirin Brewery, and Sapporo Brewery – the oldest brand of beer in Japan.

5|$|Wilson is also {{recognized}} {{for being a}} political pioneer in techniques for determining public opinion while he held office. In the 20th century, the straw poll and scientific public opinion polls <b>by</b> <b>companies</b> including Gallup became standard parts of political campaigns and media coverage of elections. During his Senate career, Wilson pioneered straw polling by sampling the views of Massachusetts voters through in person conversations and unscientific written surveys before making his own views known. These efforts were credited with helping Wilson build coalitions, win elections, make political allies, and determine {{the best time to}} act in the Senate on issues of importance.|$|E

5|$|Beagles are the {{dog breed}} {{most often used}} in animal testing, due to their size and passive nature. Beagles are used {{in a range of}} {{research}} procedures: fundamental biological research, applied human medicine, applied veterinary medicine, and protection of man, animals or the environment. Of the 8,018 dogs used in testing in the UK in 2004, 7,799 were beagles (97.3%). In the UK, the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 gave special status to primates, equids, cats and dogs and in 2005 the Animal Procedures Committee (set up by the act) ruled that testing on mice was preferable, even though a greater number of individual animals were involved. In 2005 beagles were involved in less than 0.3% of the total experiments on animals in the UK, but of the 7670 experiments performed on dogs 7406 involved beagles (96.6%). Most dogs are bred specifically for this purpose, <b>by</b> <b>companies</b> such as Harlan. In the UK companies breeding animals for research must be licensed under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act.|$|E
5|$|On June 13, 2014, Gray Television {{announced}} that it would shutter six stations and consolidate existing programming onto subchannels of Gray-owned stations in their respective market. Unlike Sinclair, however, Gray stated that it would sell the licenses of the shuttered stations to minority-owned broadcasters in collaboration with the Minority Media and Telecommunications Council – under the condition that they would operate them independently from other stations in the market, and without the use of any sharing agreements. All six of the stations were owned <b>by</b> <b>companies</b> other than Gray, but their non-license assets are either owned by Gray, or were operated by stations now owned by Gray under agreements. Gray would operate the affected stations under LMAs until the sales and consolidation are complete. Aside from one, most of the stations involved in these changes were related to Gray's acquisition of stations from Hoak Media. Three of these stations were immediately shut down the same day, while the remainder remained operated by Gray until the sales were completed. Gray announced buyers for the stations on August 27, 2014.|$|E
5|$|The {{importance}} of shipping and the docks started to decline after 1886, {{the year in}} which the opening of the Severn Tunnel caused a severe drop in coal imports by sea. The situation worsened as the railways were extended into Somerset and beyond, and ships became too big for the port. The last commercial use of the docks was when coal imports ceased on 31 July 1971, and although they now house a marina they are currently little used. The surrounding quays have been developed for housing, although the remains of wooden quays on the riverbank can still be seen. All but a small remnant of the mump (a huge mound of spoil from the original dock excavations) was removed in the 1980s {{to make way for the}} development on the north side of the dock. Due to the port, ship building was also an important industry, and around 140 ships were built in the town during the 19th century <b>by</b> <b>companies</b> including David Williams, Joseph Gough, Watsons and William Lowther. F J Carver and Son owned a small dry dock on East Quay and constructed the last ship to be built in the town— the Irene. The former associated industry of rope making is commemorated in street furnishings and paving on East Quay and in the name of Ropewalk street.|$|E

5|$|The use of steamboats {{along the}} river, {{beginning}} with the British Beaver in 1836 and followed by American vessels in 1850, contributed to the rapid settlement and economic development of the region. Steamboats operated in several distinct stretches of the river: on its lower reaches, from the Pacific Ocean to Cascades Rapids; from the Cascades to Celilo Falls; from Celilo to the confluence with the Snake River; on the Wenatchee Reach of eastern Washington; on British Columbia's Arrow Lakes; and on tributaries like the Willamette, the Snake and Kootenay Lake. The boats, initially powered by burning wood, carried passengers and freight throughout the region for many years. Early railroads served to connect steamboat lines interrupted by waterfalls on the river's lower reaches. In the 1880s, railroads maintained <b>by</b> <b>companies</b> such as the Oregon Railroad and Navigation Company began to supplement steamboat operations as the major transportation links along the river.|$|E
