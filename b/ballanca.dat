40|$|The {{legal system}} during {{communism}} is understandable in Albania {{only if we}} study its legal institutions and development. In this context, a chronological presentation is needed, based mainly {{on the work of}} Krisafi, <b>Ballanca,</b> Luarasi, Gjika, Elezi, Omari, Brozi, Gjilani (2009). In this framework, the analysis of this manuscript is closely related to the pre communism situation, not only in the frame of history of property law, but also institutions and content they had during the communism era. Main {{purpose of this article is}} the analysis of property- and commercial law in Albania, in the context of the consequences they brought in the transformation process of Albania with the fall of Communism and establishment of democracy...|$|E
40|$|Nine-year-old Susan waits patiently in her seat. The teacher {{walks around}} the room giving out the {{subtraction}} worksheets. The teacher stops at Susie's desk, hands over the paper with a slight smile, and then continues distributing them. Eagerly Susan searches for the grade. Her heart sinks as she makes out a hastily formed letter D. She scans the paper looking for clues {{to tell her what}} went wrong. Ms. Smith is {{at the front of the}} class signaling the start of the lesson. Susan puts her paper in the folder deciding this is one work sample that will not go home. The thought that Ms. Smith "hates me" crosses her mind while she struggles to concentrate on what her teacher is saying. Evans's study (cited in Simon and <b>Ballanca,</b> 1976) found a consistent stream of survey research, dating from Starch and Elliot's National Education Survey in 1912, that claimed teachers had arbitrary grading procedures. Therefore Susan's teacher, Ms. Smith, could have a strange reason why Susan deserved a D. Where would Ms. Smith learn about grading? The literature gives her little guidance. Ms. Smith's teacher education program probably paid little attention to grading. Her colleagues, principal, and district policies either may suggest that assigning grades to individual papers is a scaled-down version of assigning course grades, like her own high school or college, or may advise against giving grades. It is important that we distinguish our interest in assigning grades to one piece of work from global grades given to students for courses. While they are related, this paper focuses on the task of grading individual work samples...|$|E
