40|$|Objectives: It is {{desirable}} that {{the surfaces of}} surgical implants be uncontaminated by foreign materials to avoid untoward tissue reactions, and grit blasting is widely assumed to leave clean metal surfaces. SEM examination and X-ray microanalysis of a recovered 'pure' titanium implant casting that was associated with tissue breakdown revealed embedded particles of alumina. The casting had been cleaned of investment by <b>blasting</b> <b>with</b> <b>alumina</b> grit. Methods: A variety of treatments of cast titanium plates was used: (a) to establish that the observed aluminium {{was due to the}} blasting grit, and (b) to determine whether removal of investment could be achieved effectively by other means. SEM examination and X-ray microanalysis were used. Results: The detected aluminium was associated with embedded fragments identified as coming from the blasting grit. Acid-pickling and mechanical (rotary instrument) trimming produced minimally contaminated surfaces. Conclusions: Whilst unproven, the presence of the alumina is viewed with great concern as a possible causative agent in the observed tissue breakdown and procedures avoiding alumina blasting are recommended as a precautionary measure. © 1995. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|International audienceAn {{investigation}} {{has been conducted}} in order to study the fatigue behavior of a SAE 1045 steel substrate coated with a Ni-base alloy known commercially as Colmonoy 88, deposited by HVOF spray technique. Fatigue tests were conducted under axial conditions (R = 0. 1), employing samples of the substrate material in the as-polished condition, after grit <b>blasting</b> <b>with</b> <b>alumina</b> particles and after grit blasting and coating with a deposit of about 250 μm thick. The fatigue tests were conducted at maximum stresses {{in the range of}} 380 – 533 MPa, depending on the condition of the material. A detailed fractographic analysis of some selected samples tested at different stresses was carried out, aimed mainly at determining the crack nucleation and propagation sequence. The results indicate that the deposition of such a coating leads to a fatigue strength debit of the substrate in the range of 10 – 20 % and a similar debit in fatigue limit of not, vert, similar 11 – 13 %. It has been found that grit blasting is the process responsible for the fatigue strength debit observed in the coated samples. Fatigue cracks have been observed to initiate at the substrate–coating interface and at the free surface of the coating, mainly close to alumina particles embedded on the substrate and sharp notches produced during the process. The fractographic analysis of the fracture surface of the coated specimens points out the characteristic heterogeneous nature of the coating, particularly regarding some of its mechanical properties, such as fracture toughness...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{evaluate}} the mechanical properties including surface hardness, flexural strength, and flexural modulus of two dual-cured resin luting agents (New Resin Cement [NRC] and Variolink II [VLII]) irradiated through four different thickness of leucite ceramics (0, 1, 2, and 3 mm) and their shear bond strength to zirconia ceramic (Cercon) using each ceramic primer. Materials and Methods: Knoop hardness was measured on a thin layer of resin luting agent on the ceramic surface. Three-point bending tests were performed after 24 h storage at 37 °C. Two different-shaped zirconia ceramic specimens with or without sandblasting with alumina were treated with each primer. The specimens were then cemented together with each resin luting agent. Half of the specimens were stored in water at 37 °C for 24 h and the other half were thermocycled 5, 000 times. Results: VLII revealed statistically higher Knoop hardness and flexural modulus than NRC for each thickness of ceramic. No significant differences in flexural strength were observed between VLII and NRC for each ceramic spacer. Reduction of the mechanical properties with increase of ceramic thickness varied for each property. However, these properties were similar between the two materials. <b>Blasting</b> <b>with</b> <b>alumina</b> was significantly effective for increasing shear bond strength of both resin luting agents before and after thermal cycling. The use of New Ceramic Primer showed the highest shear bond strength and maintained bond durability after 5, 000 thermocycles.

40|$|Flat fatigue {{specimens}} of biomedical Ti 6 Al 4 V ELI alloy were surface-processed by high pressure waterjet peening (WJP) without abrasive particles using {{moderate to severe}} conditions that yield roughness values {{in the range of}} those obtained by commercial grit blasting (BL) with alumina particles. Fatigue behavior of WJP and BL specimens was characterized under cyclical uniaxial tension tests (R= 0. 1). The emphasis was put on a comparative analysis of the surface and subsurface induced effects and in their relevance on fatigue behavior. Within the experimental setup of this investigation it resulted that <b>blasting</b> <b>with</b> <b>alumina</b> particles was less harmful for fatigue resistance than abrasiveless WJP. BL specimens resulted in higher subsurface hardening and compressive residual stresses. Specimens treated with more severe WJP parameters presented much higher mass loss and lower compressive residual stresses. From the analysis performed in this work, it follows that, in addition to roughness, waviness emerges as another important topographic parameter {{to be taken into account}} to try to predict fatigue behavior. It is envisaged that optimization of WJP parameters with the aim of reducing waviness and mass loss should lead to an improvement of fatigue resistance.

40|$|International audienceThe present {{investigation}} {{has been carried}} out in order to study the fatigue behavior of a SAE 1045 steel substrate coated with a WC– 10 Co– 4 Cr cermet, of approximately 200 μm thick, deposited by HVOF thermal spraying. Particular emphasis {{has been paid to the}} influence of the substrate roughness prior to HVOF deposition, as a mean of improving the mechanical bonding of the coating, on the fatigue life of the coated system. Fatigue tests were conducted under rotating bending conditions (R = − 1), employing samples with different surface roughness, including as-polished, fine-grinding with abrasive paper grit 400 and coated and grit <b>blasted</b> <b>with</b> <b>alumina</b> particles of two different sizes (< 1 and < 3 mm, respectively) and coated. For comparative purposes, tests were also carried out on as-grit blasted specimens employing alumina particles of 3 mm in size. Fatigue tests were carried out at maximum alternating stresses in the range of 358 – 588 MPa, depending on the condition of the material, in order that the number of cycles to fracture varied in the range of 105 to 106. Selected samples tested at different applied stresses were analyzed after fracture by SEM techniques, which allowed the determination of the crack nucleation and propagation sequence. The results indicate that the presence of the cermet coating gives rise to a delay in the initiation of fatigue cracks at deep notches and alumina particles embedded at the steel substrate after grit blasting, leading to an insignificant fatigue strength debit of the coated specimens, in comparison with the as-polished ones. Fine-grinding, on the other hand, impairs the mechanical bonding of the coating, giving rise to its delamination from the substrate at elevated maximum alternating stresses...|$|R

The production of glass ceramics from industrial waste such as fly ash, red mud, blast furnace slag gaining more importance now a days because of their availability and low cost. In the present work an attempt has been made to produce glass ceramic <b>with</b> high <b>alumina</b> content using blast furnace slag. Generally alumina is very difficult to melt. To produce base glass for glass ceramic from blast furnace slag, an additional low melting phase which aid in dissolving the alumina can be provided by blast furnace slag. Blast furnace slag is generally produced at the temperature range 1300 oC to 1400 oC. High <b>alumina</b> content glass <b>with</b> <b>alumina</b> percentage as high as 30 % (more alumina content in E-glass) requires melting temperature as high as 1600 oC. Therefore using blast furnace slag as one of the main constituents can help in reducing the melting temperature of the precursor glass prior to glass ceramic production. More over high alumina content in the glass as well as in glass ceramic can enhance different physical properties, like high mechanical strength, high durability, low thermal expansion co efficient which are very suitable for cooktop application.

Although the maximum stress in our fatigue tests is always applied {{on the surface of the}} specimen, the appropriate surface treatment combinations were able to optimize the fatigue response of the steel until the point where the fatigue crack initiated in the specimen interior (subsurface nucleation), due to the microstructural stress concentration provided by small alumina inclusions present in the microstructure of the steel.

We hypothesized that mini-implants surface roughness alters the intrinsic biomechanical {{properties of the}} bone integrated to titanium. Materials and Methods: Mini implants and circular discs were made from alloy Ti 6 Al 4 V grade 5. On the basis of surface treatment study was divided into 4 groups: Group 1 : Machined: no surface treatment, Group 2 : Acid etched: with hydrochloric acid, Group 3 : Grit <b>Blasted</b> <b>with</b> <b>alumina</b> and Group 4 : Grit blasted +Acid etched. Surface roughness parameters (mean surface roughness: Ra and Quadratic Average roughness: Rq) of the four discs from each group were measured by the optical profilometer. Contact angle measurement of 3 discs from each group was done with a Goniometer. Contact angle of liquids with different hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity were measured. 128 mini implants, differing in surface treatment, were placed into the tibias and femurs of 8 adult male New Zealand white rabbits. Biomechanical properties (Removal torque and hardness) measurements and histomorphometric observations were measured. Results: Ra and Rq of groups were: Machined (1. 17 ± 0. 11, 2. 59 ± 0. 09) Acid etched (1. 82 ± 0. 04, 3. 17 ± 0. 13), Grit blasted (4. 83 ± 0. 23, 7. 04 ± 0. 08), Grit blasted + Acid etched (3. 64 ± 0. 03, 4. 95 ± 0. 04) respectively. Group 4 had significantly (p= 0. 000) lower Ra and Rq than Group 3. The interaction between the groups and liquid was significant. Group 4 had significantly lower contact angle measurements (40. 4 °, 26. 9 °), both for blood and NaCl {{when compared to other}} three groups (p≤ 0. 01). Group 4 had significantly higher torque than Group 3 (Tibia: 13. 67 > 9. 07 N-cm; Femur: 18. 21 > 14. 12 N-cm), Group 4 (Tibia: 13. 67 > 9. 78 N-cm; Femur: 18. 21 > 12. 87 N-cm), and machined (Tibia: 13. 67 > 4. 08 N-cm; Femur: 18. 21 > 6. 49 N-cm). SEM analysis reveals significantly more bone implant gap in machined implant surfaces than treated implant surfaces. Bone to implant contact had significantly higher values for treated mini implant surface than machined surface. Hardness of the bone near the implant bone interface is 20 to 25 % less hard than bone 1 mm away from it in both Femur and Tibia.

40|$|Bone loss around femoral {{implants}} {{used for}} THA is a persistent clinical concern. It {{may be caused}} by stress shielding, generally attributed to a mismatch in stiffness between the implants and host bone. In this regard, a fatigue resistant, carbon fiber (CF) composite femoral implant with bone-matching stiffness has been developed. This study evaluated the tissue response to the three material components of this implant in normal and textured (<b>blasted</b> <b>with</b> 24 grit <b>alumina)</b> surfaces: the hydroxyapatite (HA) coating, the CF composite and the intermediate crystalline HA particulate composite layer to bond to the HA coating (blended). Sprague-Dawley rats underwent bilateral femoral implantation each receiving two rod-like implants. Bone apposition to the HA (37 %) and textured Ti (41 %) implants was not significantly different. Bone apposition to the untextured CF (14 %) and blended (19 %) implants and polished Ti (8 %) implants was significantly lower. Bone apposition to the textured CF (9 %) and blended (11 %) implants was lower (but not statistically from the as received or untextured counterparts). Nearly all sections from femurs containing CF implants presented CF debris. There was no evidence of localized bone loss or any strong immune response associated with any of the implant materials. All materials were well tolerated with minimal inflammation despite the presence of particulate debris. The high degree of bone apposition to the HA-coated composite implants and the lack of short-term inflammation and adverse tissue response to the three material implant component support continued evaluation of this composite technology for use in THA.
