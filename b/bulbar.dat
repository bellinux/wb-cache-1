5|$|Making {{up about}} 2 {{percent of cases}} of paralytic polio, <b>bulbar</b> polio occurs when {{poliovirus}} invades and destroys nerves within the <b>bulbar</b> region of the brain stem. The <b>bulbar</b> region is a white matter pathway that connects the cerebral cortex to the brain stem. The destruction of these nerves weakens the muscles supplied by the cranial nerves, producing symptoms of encephalitis, and causes difficulty breathing, speaking and swallowing. Critical nerves affected are the glossopharyngeal nerve (which partially controls swallowing and functions in the throat, tongue movement, and taste), the vagus nerve (which sends signals to the heart, intestines, and lungs), and the accessory nerve (which controls upper neck movement). Due to the effect on swallowing, secretions of mucus may build up in the airway, causing suffocation. Other signs and symptoms include facial weakness (caused by destruction of the trigeminal nerve and facial nerve, which innervate the cheeks, tear ducts, gums, and muscles of the face, among other structures), double vision, difficulty in chewing, and abnormal respiratory rate, depth, and rhythm (which may lead to respiratory arrest). Pulmonary edema and shock are also possible and may be fatal.|$|E
5|$|In around 1 {{percent of}} infections, {{poliovirus}} spreads along certain nerve fiber pathways, preferentially replicating in and destroying motor neurons within the spinal cord, brain stem, or motor cortex. This {{leads to the}} development of paralytic poliomyelitis, the various forms of which (spinal, <b>bulbar,</b> and bulbospinal) vary only with the amount of neuronal damage and inflammation that occurs, and the region of the CNS affected.|$|E
5|$|The Salk vaccine, or inactivated {{poliovirus}} vaccine (IPV), {{is based}} on three wild, virulent reference strains, Mahoney (type 1 poliovirus), MEF-1 (type 2 poliovirus), and Saukett (type 3 poliovirus), grown in a type of monkey kidney tissue culture (Vero cell line), which are then inactivated with formalin. The injected Salk vaccine confers IgG-mediated immunity in the bloodstream, which prevents polio infection from progressing to viremia and protects the motor neurons, thus eliminating the risk of <b>bulbar</b> polio and post-polio syndrome.|$|E
5|$|A bite from a {{black mamba}} causes initial {{neurological}} and neuromuscular symptoms that may commonly include headache and a metallic taste in the mouth, which may {{be accompanied by a}} triad of paresthesias, profuse perspiration and salivation. Other symptoms may include ptosis and gradual <b>bulbar</b> palsy. Localised pain or numbness around the bite site is common but not typically severe; therefore, application of a tourniquet proximal to the bite site is feasible and may assist in slowing the onset of prominent neurotoxicity. Without appropriate treatment, symptoms typically progress to more severe reactions such as tachydysrhythmias and neurogenic shock, leading to death by asphyxiation, cardiovascular collapse, or respiratory failure.|$|E
5|$|Approximately 19 {{percent of}} all paralytic polio cases have both <b>bulbar</b> and spinal symptoms; this subtype is called {{respiratory}} or bulbospinal polio. Here, the virus affects {{the upper part of}} the cervical spinal cord (cervical vertebrae C3 through C5), and paralysis of the diaphragm occurs. The critical nerves affected are the phrenic nerve (which drives the diaphragm to inflate the lungs) and those that drive the muscles needed for swallowing. By destroying these nerves, this form of polio affects breathing, making it difficult or impossible for the patient to breathe without the support of a ventilator. It can lead to paralysis of the arms and legs and may also affect swallowing and heart functions.|$|E
5|$|The {{results of}} the field trial were {{announced}} 12 April 1955 (the tenth anniversary {{of the death of}} President Franklin D. Roosevelt, whose paralytic illness was generally believed to have been caused by polio). The Salk vaccine had been 60–70% effective against PV1 (poliovirus type 1), over 90% effective against PV2 and PV3, and 94% effective against the development of <b>bulbar</b> polio. Soon after Salk's vaccine was licensed in 1955, children's vaccination campaigns were launched. In the U.S, following a mass immunization campaign promoted by the March of Dimes, the annual number of polio cases fell from 35,000 in 1953 to 5,600 by 1957. By 1961 only 161 cases were recorded in the United States.|$|E
5|$|The {{weakness}} from LEMS typically {{involves the}} muscles of the proximal arms and legs (the muscles closer to the trunk). In contrast to myasthenia gravis, the weakness affects the legs more than the arms. This leads to difficulties climbing stairs and rising from a sitting position. Weakness is often relieved temporarily after exertion or physical exercise. High temperatures can worsen the symptoms. Weakness of the <b>bulbar</b> muscles (muscles of the mouth and throat) is occasionally encountered. Weakness of the eye muscles is uncommon. Some may have double vision, drooping of the eyelids and difficulty swallowing, but generally only together with leg weakness; this too distinguishes LEMS from myasthenia gravis, in which eye signs are much more common. In the advanced stages of the disease, weakness of the respiratory muscles may occur. Some may also experience problems with coordination (ataxia).|$|E
25|$|Clinicians {{frequently}} {{think of}} the symptoms of botulism {{in terms of a}} classic triad: <b>bulbar</b> palsy and descending paralysis, lack of fever, and clear senses and mental status ("clear sensorium").|$|E
25|$|Conjunctivitis is {{identified}} by irritation and redness of the conjunctiva. Except in obvious pyogenic or toxic/chemical conjunctivitis, a slit lamp (biomicroscope) {{is needed to}} have any confidence in the diagnosis. Examination of the tarsal conjunctiva is usually more diagnostic than the <b>bulbar</b> conjunctiva.|$|E
25|$|Spinal and <b>bulbar</b> {{muscular atrophy}} (SBMA), {{also known as}} Kennedy's disease, is a severe {{neurodegenerative}} syndrome {{that is associated with}} a particular mutation of the androgen receptor's polyglutamine tract called a trinucleotide repeat expansion. SBMA results when the length of the polyglutamine tract exceeds 40 repetitions.|$|E
25|$|Rows of iron lungs filled {{hospital}} wards at {{the height}} of the polio outbreaks of the 1940s and 1950s, helping children and adults (mostly children) with <b>bulbar</b> polio and bulbospinal polio. A polio patient with paralyzed lungs could spend up to a week inside an iron lung.|$|E
25|$|Any sign of low blood sodium (hyponatremia) or {{weakness}} {{should be}} treated {{with the addition of}} hematin, heme arginate, or even tin mesoporphyrin, as these are signs of impending syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) or peripheral nervous system involvement that may be localized or severe, progressing to <b>bulbar</b> paresis and respiratory paralysis.|$|E
25|$|The {{neurological}} {{symptoms are}} progressive {{and can lead}} to severe spasticity, <b>bulbar</b> symptoms and dysarthria within one to two decades. The life span is shorter than normal. Death occurs between 2 and 30 years of age, depending on the severity of the syndrome. The immediate cause of death is pneumonia, fulminant intestinal bleeding or multiple organ dysfunction.|$|E
25|$|As for the retina, the {{syndrome}} causes retinocephalic vascular malformations {{that tend to}} be present with intracranial hemorrhage and lead to decreased visual acuity, proptosis, pupillary defects, optic atrophy, congestion of <b>bulbar</b> conjunctiva, and visual field defects. Retinal lesions can be unilateral and tortuous, and symptoms begin {{to appear in the}} second and third decades of life.|$|E
25|$|During the polio epidemics, {{the iron}} lung saved many {{thousands}} of lives, but the machine was large, cumbersome and very expensive: in the 1930s, an iron lung cost about $1,500—about the same price as the average home. The cost of running the machine was also prohibitive, as patients were encased in the metal chambers for months, years and sometimes for life: even with an iron lung the fatality rate for patients with <b>bulbar</b> polio exceeded 90%.|$|E
500|$|Recently, {{a fourth}} TgPVR mouse model was developed. These [...] "cPVR" [...] mice carry hPVR cDNA, {{driven by a}} β-actin promoter, and have proven {{susceptible}} to poliovirus through intracerebral, intramuscular, and intranasal routes. In addition, these mice are capable of developing the <b>bulbar</b> form of polio after intranasal inoculation.|$|E
500|$|Progressive <b>bulbar</b> palsy, a form {{of motor}} neuron disease, is {{associated}} with combined lesions of the hypoglossal nucleus and nucleus ambiguus with wasting (...) of the motor nerves of the pons and medulla. This may cause difficulty with tongue movements, speech, chewing and swallowing caused by dysfunction of several cranial nerve nuclei. Motor neuron disease {{is the most common}} disease affecting the hypoglossal nerve.|$|E
500|$|Without {{respiratory}} support, {{consequences of}} poliomyelitis with respiratory involvement include suffocation or pneumonia from aspiration of secretions. Overall, 5 to 10 {{percent of patients}} with paralytic polio die due to the paralysis of muscles used for breathing. The case fatality rate (CFR) varies by age: 2 to 5 percent of children and up to 15 to 30 percent of adults die. [...] <b>Bulbar</b> polio often causes death if respiratory support is not provided; with support, its CFR ranges from 25 to 75 percent, depending on {{the age of the}} patient. When intermittent positive pressure ventilation is available, the fatalities can be reduced to 15 percent.|$|E
500|$|The {{method of}} access to a {{communication}} device depends on the type and severity of the disease. In the spinal form of ALS, the limbs are affected from {{the onset of the}} disease; in these cases a head mouse or eye tracking access may be used initially. [...] In the <b>bulbar</b> form, speech is affected before the limbs; here handwriting and typing on keyboard-style devices are frequently the first forms of AAC. AAC users may change access methods as the disease progresses. [...] Low-tech systems, such as eye gazing or partner assisted scanning, are used in situations when electronic devices are unavailable (for example, during bathing) and {{in the final stages of}} the disease.|$|E
500|$|The virus {{enters the}} central nervous system in about 1 percent of infections. Most {{patients}} with CNS involvement develop nonparalytic aseptic meningitis, with symptoms of headache, neck, back, abdominal and extremity pain, fever, vomiting, lethargy, and irritability. About one to five in 1000 cases progress to paralytic disease, in which the muscles become weak, floppy and poorly controlled, and, finally, completely paralyzed; this condition is known as acute flaccid paralysis. [...] Depending on the site of paralysis, paralytic poliomyelitis is classified as spinal, <b>bulbar,</b> or bulbospinal. Encephalitis, an infection of the brain tissue itself, can occur in rare cases, and is usually restricted to infants. It is characterized by confusion, changes in mental status, headaches, fever, and, less commonly, seizures and spastic paralysis.|$|E
2500|$|These {{drawbacks}} led to {{the development}} of more modern positive-pressure ventilators and the use of positive-pressure ventilation by tracheostomy. Positive pressure ventilators reduced mortality in <b>bulbar</b> patients from 90% to 20%. [...] In the Copenhagen epidemic of 1952, large numbers of patients were ventilated by hand ("bagged") by medical students and anyone else on hand, because of the large number of <b>bulbar</b> polio patients and the small number of ventilators available.|$|E
2500|$|Type III - Less common variant; a disc {{of tissue}} distal to verumontanum, also theorized [...] to be a {{developmental}} anomaly of congenital urogenital remnants in the <b>bulbar</b> urethra ...|$|E
2500|$|ALS is a {{motor neuron}} disease, also spelled [...] "motor neurone disease", {{which is a}} group of {{neurological}} disorders that selectively affect motor neurons, the cells that control voluntary muscles of the body, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), primary lateral sclerosis, progressive muscular atrophy, progressive <b>bulbar</b> palsy, pseudobulbar palsy, and spinal muscular atrophy.|$|E
2500|$|Dewan has {{suggested}} that obstruction in the posterior urethra is more appropriately termed congenital obstructions of the posterior urethral membrane (COPUMs), a concept that has come from an in-depth analysis of the historical papers, and evaluation of patients with a prenatal diagnosis that has facilitated video recording of the uninstrumented obstructed urethra. The congenital obstructive lesions in the <b>bulbar</b> urethra, named Type III Valves by Young in 1919, have been eponymously referred to as Cobb's collar or Moorman's ring. For each of the COPUM (Posterior Urethra) and Cobb's (<b>Bulbar</b> Urethra) lesions, the degree of obstruction can be variable, consistent with a variable expression of the embryopathy. [...] The now nearly one hundred year old nomenclature of posterior urethral valves was based on limited radiology and primitive endoscopy, thus a change COPUM or Cobb's has been appropriate.|$|E
2500|$|Historically, {{there have}} been a variety of terms used for the disorder, {{including}} pseudobulbar affect, pathological laughter and crying, emotional lability, emotionalism, emotional dysregulation, or more recently, involuntary emotional expression disorder. The term pseudobulbar ( [...] + [...] ) came from the idea that the symptoms seemed similar to those caused by a <b>bulbar</b> lesion (that is, a lesion in the medulla oblongata).|$|E
2500|$|Other, {{more complex}} {{relationships}} {{have been observed}} {{as a consequence of}} mutated AR; some mutations associated with male phenotypes have been linked to male breast cancer, prostate cancer, {{or in the case of}} spinal and <b>bulbar</b> muscular atrophy, disease of the central nervous system. [...] The form of breast cancer seen in some men with PAIS is caused by a mutation in the AR's DNA-binding domain. [...] This mutation is thought to cause a disturbance of the AR's target gene interaction that allows it to act at certain additional targets, possibly in conjunction with the estrogen receptor protein, to cause cancerous growth. The pathogenesis of spinal and <b>bulbar</b> muscular atrophy (SBMA) demonstrates that even the mutant AR protein itself can result in pathology. [...] The trinucleotide repeat expansion of the polyglutamine tract of the AR gene that is associated with SBMA results in the synthesis of a misfolded AR protein that the cell fails to proteolyze and disperse properly. [...] These misfolded AR proteins form aggregates in the cell cytoplasm and nucleus. [...] Over the course of 30 to 50 years, these aggregates accumulate and have a cytotoxic effect, eventually resulting in the neurodegenerative symptoms associated with SBMA.|$|E
2500|$|Surgery was {{important}} in treating patients with eye complications, such as trachoma and cataracts. [...] A common complication of trachoma patients is the vascularization of the tissue that invades the cornea of the eye, which {{was thought to be}} the cause of the disease, by ancient Islamic physicians. The technique used to correct this complication was done surgically and known today as peritomy. This procedure was done by [...] "employing an instrument for keeping the eye open during surgery, a number of very small hooks for lifting, and a very thin scalpel for excision." [...] A similar technique in treating complications of trachoma, called pterygium, was used to remove the triangular-shaped part of the <b>bulbar</b> conjunctiva onto the cornea. This was done by lifting the growth with small hooks and then cut with a small lancet. Both of these surgical techniques were extremely painful for the patient and intricate for the physician or his assistants to perform.|$|E
2500|$|The {{androgen}} receptor gene contains two polymorphic trinucleotide microsatellites in exon 1. The first microsatellite (nearest the 5' end) contains 8 [...] to 60 [...] repetitions of the glutamine codon [...] "CAG" [...] {{and is thus}} known as the polyglutamine tract. The second microsatellite contains 4 [...] to 31 [...] repetitions of the glycine codon [...] "GGC" [...] and {{is known as the}} polyglycine tract. The average number of repetitions varies by ethnicity, with Caucasians exhibiting an average of 21 CAG repeats, and Blacks 18. Disease states are associated with extremes in polyglutamine tract length; prostate cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, and mental retardation [...] are associated with too few repetitions, while spinal and <b>bulbar</b> muscular atrophy (SBMA) is associated with a CAG repetition length of 40 or more. Some studies indicate that the length of the polyglutamine tract is inversely correlated with transcriptional activity in the AR protein, and that longer polyglutamine tracts may be associated with infertility [...] and undermasculinized genitalia. However, other studies have indicated that no such correlation exists. A comprehensive meta-analysis of the subject published in 2007 supports the existence of the correlation, and concluded that these discrepancies could be resolved when sample size and study design are taken into account. Longer polyglycine tract lengths have also been associated with genital masculinization defects in some, but not all, studies.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>bulbar</b> conjunctival microvessels are {{typically}} imaged with a high-magnification slit-lamp with green filters. With such high-magnification imaging systems, {{it is possible}} to see groups of individual red blood cells flowing in vivo. Fundus cameras may also be used for low-magnification wide field-of-view imaging of the <b>bulbar</b> conjunctival microvasculature. Modified fundus cameras have been used to measure conjunctival blood flow [...] and to measure blood oxygen saturation. Fluorescein angiography has been used to study the blood flow of the <b>bulbar</b> conjunctiva and to differentiate the <b>bulbar</b> conjunctival and episcleral microcirculation.|$|E
50|$|Blood to the <b>bulbar</b> {{conjunctiva}} {{is primarily}} {{derived from the}} ophthalmic artery. The blood supply to the palpebral conjunctiva (the eyelid) {{is derived from the}} external carotid artery. However, the circulation of the <b>bulbar</b> conjunctiva and palpebral conjunctiva are linked, so both <b>bulbar</b> conjunctival and palpebral conjunctival vessels will be supplied by both the ophthalmic artery and the external carotid artery, to varying extents.|$|E
50|$|The bulb is an archaic {{term for}} the medulla oblongata and in modern {{clinical}} usage the word <b>bulbar</b> (as in <b>bulbar</b> palsy) is retained for terms {{that relate to the}} medulla oblongata, particularly in reference to medical conditions. The word <b>bulbar</b> can refer to the nerves and tracts connected to the medulla, and also by association to those muscles innervated, such as those of the tongue, pharynx and larynx.|$|E
50|$|<b>Bulbar</b> form- It is characterised by dusky red {{triangular}} congestion of <b>bulbar</b> conjunctiva in palpebral area, gelatinous thickened {{accumulation of}} tissue around limbus and presence of discrete whitish raised dots along the limbus (Tranta's spots).|$|E
50|$|The <b>bulbar</b> conjunctival microvasculature is {{in close}} {{proximity}} to ambient air, thus oxygen diffusion from ambient air strongly influences their blood oxygen saturation. It has been shown that because of oxygen diffusion, hypoxic <b>bulbar</b> conjunctival vessels will rapidly re-oxygenate (in under 10 seconds) when exposed to ambient air (i.e. when the eyelid is open). Closing the eyelid stops this oxygen diffusion by placing a barrier between the <b>bulbar</b> conjunctival microvessels and ambient air.|$|E
50|$|Surgery {{involves}} {{making an}} incision between the anus and scrotum (perineal incision) and dissecting out the <b>bulbar</b> urethra and locating the scar and membranoprostatic urethra. Dissecting the <b>bulbar</b> urethra destroys the antegrade blood flow. However, this urethra still does well since in still gets retrograde blood {{flow from the}} dorsal arteries. When patients have erectile dysfunction, the dorsal arteries do not work well and therefore the <b>bulbar</b> urethra does not get a good blood supply.|$|E
50|$|The <b>bulbar</b> conjunctival microvasculature {{is known}} to dilate in {{response}} to several stimuli and external conditions, including allergens (e.g. pollen), temperature, time-of-day, contact-lens wear, and acute mild hypoxia. <b>Bulbar</b> conjunctival vasodilation {{has also been shown}} to correlate changes in emotional state.|$|E
