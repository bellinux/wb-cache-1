25|$|The 256-element free Boolean algebra {{on three}} {{generators}} is deployed in computer displays based on raster graphics, which use bit <b>blit</b> <b>to</b> manipulate whole regions consisting of pixels, relying on Boolean operations to specify how the source region should {{be combined with}} the destination, typically {{with the help of}} a third region called the mask. Modern video cards offer all 223=256 ternary operations for this purpose, with the choice of operation being a one-byte (8-bit) parameter. The constants SRC = 0xaa or 10101010, DST = 0xcc or 11001100, and MSK = 0xf0 or 11110000 allow Boolean operations such as (SRC^DST) (meaning XOR the source and destination and then AND the result with the mask) to be written directly as a constant denoting a byte calculated at compile time, 0x60 in the (SRC^DST) example, 0x66 if just SRC^DST, etc. At run time the video card interprets the byte as the raster operation indicated by the original expression in a uniform way that requires remarkably little hardware and which takes time completely independent of the complexity of the expression.|$|E
5000|$|Monster Maker's blitter engine used {{a custom}} sprite codec that was highly {{optimized}} for unique content aspects of monster parts. Each part in Monster Maker used a special palette that had four [...] "part colors" [...] and four [...] "sticky colors". The part colors could be changed during <b>blit</b> <b>to</b> allow {{the user to}} change the color of parts on the screen. The sticky color could also be changed during the blit, {{and it would take}} on the part color of whatever the part was stuck to. For example, an arm could take on the color of whatever body it was stuck to.|$|E

50|$|As {{one might}} imagine, this makes {{blitting}} significantly slower than sprite manipulation. However, blitting has one very big advantage: {{there is no}} physical limit {{to the number of}} patterns you can <b>blit,</b> or <b>to</b> the size of the patterns. Thus you can use <b>blitting</b> <b>to</b> display anything on the screen, including simulating sprites (through the double-write pattern noted above), or even text.|$|R

50|$|A classic use for <b>blitting</b> is <b>to</b> render {{transparent}} sprites onto a background. In {{this example}} a background image, a sprite, and a 1-bit mask are used. As the mask is 1-bit, {{there is no}} possibility for partial transparency via alpha blending.|$|R

5000|$|Blitting {{moves the}} same types of {{patterns}} about the screen, but does so by writing into the same memory {{as the rest of the}} display. This means every time the pattern is placed on the screen, the display [...] "under" [...] it is overwritten, or [...] "damaged". It is up to the software to clean this damage up by <b>blitting</b> twice, once <b>to</b> remove the damage, and then again to place the bit in its new location. However, there are several ways to optimize this. If large areas of the screen are taken over by the patterns, it may be more efficient <b>to</b> <b>blit</b> the background <b>to</b> the screen instead of erasing each pattern individually. A variation involves dividing the screen into segments and erasing only the segments where patterns have been drawn on. This technique is known as dirty rectangles.|$|R
50|$|While early accelerators {{focused on}} {{improving}} {{the performance of}} 2D GUI systems, most modern accelerators focus on producing 3D imagery in real time. A common design is to send commands to the graphics accelerator using a library such as OpenGL or Direct3D. The graphics driver then translates those commands to instructions for the accelerator's graphics processing unit (GPU). The GPU uses those microinstructions to compute the rasterized results. Those results are bit <b>blitted</b> <b>to</b> the framebuffer. The framebuffer's signal is then produced in combination with built-in video overlay devices (usually used to produce the mouse cursor without modifying the framebuffer's data) and any analog special effects that are produced by modifying the output signal. An example of such analog modification was the spatial anti-aliasing technique used by the 3dfx Voodoo cards. These cards add a slight blur to output signal that makes aliasing of the rasterized graphics much less obvious.|$|R

50|$|The VDC lacked sprite {{capabilities}}, which limited {{its use in}} gaming applications. However, it did contain <b>blitting</b> capabilities <b>to</b> autonomously perform small block memory copies {{within its}} dedicated video RAM. While the VDC is performing such a copy, the system CPU can continue running code, provided no other VDC accesses are attempted before the copy is finished. These functions were used by the C128's screen editor ROM to rapidly scroll or clear screen sections.|$|R
50|$|Modern {{computer}} graphics card displays almost overwhelmingly use raster techniques, dividing the screen into a rectangular grid of pixels, {{due to the}} relatively low cost of raster-based video hardware as compared with vector graphic hardware. Most graphic hardware has internal support for blitting operations or sprite drawing. A co-processor dedicated <b>to</b> <b>blitting</b> {{is known as a}} Blitter chip.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Blitting</b> {{is similar}} <b>to</b> hardware-sprite drawing, in that both systems {{reproduce}} a pattern, typically a square area, at different locations on the screen. Hardware sprites {{have the advantage}} of being stored in separate memory, and therefore don't disturb the main display memory. This allows them to be moved about the display, covering the [...] "background", with no effect on it.|$|R

Television and the internet have been outlawed due to the proliferation of BLIT images. In order to protect children, special chips have been planted in their brains that creates a subjective and artificial darkness (which the children call [...] "type-two darkness") to obscure any possible BLIT image they may inadvertently look at. The main characters, all school children, form the [...] "Shudder Club", where they take turns looking at a <b>BLIT</b> image <b>to</b> see how long they last, inadvertently vaccinating themselves against them.|$|R
5000|$|Graphics {{capability}} was {{not taken}} seriously {{in the original}} IBM design brief; graphics were considered only {{from the perspective of}} generating static business graphics such as charts and graphs. MS-DOS did not have an API for graphics, and the BIOS only included the rudimentary graphics functions such as changing screen modes and plotting single points. To make a BIOS call for every point drawn or modified increased overhead considerably, making the BIOS interface notoriously slow. Because of this, line-drawing, arc-drawing, and <b>blitting</b> had <b>to</b> be performed by the application to achieve acceptable speed, which was usually done by bypassing the BIOS and accessing video memory directly. Software written to address IBM PC hardware directly would run on any IBM clone, but would have to be rewritten especially for each non-PC-compatible MS-DOS machine.|$|R
50|$|WinG {{introduced}} {{a new type of}} DC called a WinGDC, which allowed programmers to both read and write to it directly using device-independent bitmaps (DIBs) with the wingdib.drv driver. Effectively, it gave programmers the ability to do with Windows what they'd been doing without hardware access limitations in DOS for years. Programmers could write DIBs to the WinGDC, yet would still have access to the individual bits of the image data. This meant that fast graphics algorithms could be written to allow fast scrolling, overdraw, dirty rectangles, double buffering, and other animation techniques. WinG also provided much better performance when <b>blitting</b> graphics data <b>to</b> physical graphics device memory. Since WinG used the DIB format, it was possible to mix original GDI API calls and WinG calls.|$|R
40|$|Recent {{windowing}} systems allow graphics {{applications to}} directly access the {{graphics processing unit}} (GPU) for fast rendering. However, application tasks that render frames on the GPU contend heavily with the windowing server that also accesses the GPU <b>to</b> <b>blit</b> the rendered frames to the screen. This resource-sharing nature of direct rendering introduces core challenges of priority inversion and temporal isolation in multi-tasking environments. In this paper, we identify and address resource-sharing problems raised in GPU-accelerated windowing systems. Specifically, we propose two protocols that enable application tasks to efficiently share the GPU resource in the X Window System. The Priority Inheritance with X server (PIX) proto-col eliminates priority inversion caused in accessing the GPU, and the Reserve Inheritance with X server (RIX) protocol ad-dresses the same problem for resource-reservation systems. Our design and implementation of these protocols highlight the fact that neither the X server nor user applications need modifications to use our solutions. Our evaluation demon-strates that multiple GPU-accelerated graphics applications running concurrently in the X Window System can be correctly prioritized and isolated by the PIX and the RIX protocols. ...|$|R
