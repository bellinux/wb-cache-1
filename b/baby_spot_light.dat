40|$|The {{scope of}} the present paper is the {{derivation}} of a merit function which predicts the visual perception of LED <b>spot</b> <b>lights.</b> The color uniformity level Usl is described by a linear regression function of the spatial color distribution in the far field. Hereby, the function is derived from four basic functions. They describe the color uniformity of <b>spot</b> <b>lights</b> through different features. The result is a reliable prediction for the perceived color uniformity in <b>spot</b> <b>lights.</b> A human factor experiment was performed to evaluate the visual preferences for colors and patterns. A perceived rank order {{was derived from the}} subjects’ answers and compared with the four basic functions. The correlation between the perceived rank order and the basic functions was calculated resulting in the definition of the merit function Usl. The application of this function is shown by a comparison of visual evaluations and measurements of LED retrofit spot lamps. The results enable a prediction of color uniformity levels of simulations and measurements concerning the visual perception. The function provides a possibility to evaluate the far field of <b>spot</b> <b>lights</b> without individual subjective judgment. © (2014) COPYRIGHT Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).

5000|$|Oval BA {{should not}} be {{confused}} with another major storm on Jupiter, the South Tropical Little Red Spot (LRS) (nicknamed [...] "the Baby Red Spot" [...] by NASA), which was destroyed by the GRS. The new storm, previously a white spot in Hubble images, turned red in May 2008. The observations were led by Imke de Pater of the University of California, at Berkeley, US. The <b>Baby</b> Red <b>Spot</b> encountered the GRS in late June to early July 2008, and in the course of a collision, the smaller red spot was shredded into pieces. The remnants of the <b>Baby</b> Red <b>Spot</b> first orbited, then were later consumed by the GRS. The last of the remnants with a reddish color to have been identified by astronomers had disappeared by mid-July, and the remaining pieces again collided with the GRS, then finally merged with the bigger storm. The remaining pieces of the <b>Baby</b> Red <b>Spot</b> had completely disappeared by August 2008. During this encounter Oval BA was present nearby, but played no apparent role in destruction of the <b>Baby</b> Red <b>Spot.</b>|$|R

40|$|We {{present an}} {{automated}} light calibration pipeline for free-form acquisition of shape and reflectance of objects using common off-the-shelf illuminators, such as LED lights, {{that can be}} placed arbitrarily close to the objects. We acquire multiple digital photographs of the studied object shot from a stationary camera. In each photograph, a light is freely positioned around the object in order to cover {{a wide variety of}} illumination directions. While common free-form acquisition approaches are based on the simplifying assumptions that the light sources are either sufficiently far from the object that all incoming light can be modeled using parallel rays, or that lights are local points emitting uniformly in space, we use the more realistic model of a scene lit by a moving local <b>spot</b> <b>light</b> with exponential fall-off depending on the cosine of the angle between the <b>spot</b> <b>light</b> optical axis and the illumination direction, raised {{to the power of the}} spot exponent. We recover all <b>spot</b> <b>light</b> parameters using a multipass numerical method. First, light positions are determined using standard methods used in photometric stereo approaches. Then, we exploit measures taken on a Lambertian reference planar object to recover the <b>spot</b> <b>light</b> exponent and the per-image <b>spot</b> <b>light</b> optical axis; we minimize the difference between the observed reflectance and the reflectance synthesized by using the near-field Lambertian equation. The optimization is performed in two passes, first generating a starting solution and then refining it using a Levenberg-Marquardt iterative minimizer. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the method based on an error analysis performed on analytical datasets, as well as on real-world experiments.

The aim of this work is to evaluate the characteristics of solder joints, which are produced by the use of selective soldering techniques.

The characterization method will be demonstrated on the <b>spot</b> <b>light</b> soldering technique. In addition the influence of the solder joint quality on the resistance of the whole solar cell will be demonstrated and discussed...|$|R
