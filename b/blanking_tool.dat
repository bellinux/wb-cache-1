40|$|Abstract The {{clearance}} {{between the}} {{punch and die}} of a fine <b>blanking</b> <b>tool</b> is an important design factor that affects the sheared surface of a product. In a fine blanking process, the clearance is typically assigned a 0. 5 % material thickness. If the clearance is too big, a fractured surface would occur in the product while if it is too small, bulging would occur. In this study, a setting for optimum clearance was proposed for inner corner shapes by checking shear characteristics and bulging effects according to various clearances. After designing a special part with various corner shapes possessing SPFH 590 (thickness: 4 mm), a high-strength steel material, a fine <b>blanking</b> <b>tool</b> was constructed and fine blanking experiments were conducted.

40|$|To {{improve the}} {{lifetime}} of <b>blanking</b> <b>tools,</b> the application of high quality steel, heat treatment and coatings has become an interesting issue for many European companies dealing with stamping, punching and blanking operations. Important trends such as longer lifetime, higher accuracy and higher complexity of the products are challenging and require more special materials and techniques. The technological solutions to improve the existing processes are not obvious because of the enormous amount of possibilities in available materials, heat and surface treatments such as PVD coatings for the envisaged industrial processes and applications. An in-depth research to understand the manufacturing processes with the consequence of an increased performance and lifetime of the tools {{as well as the}} opportunity of further optimization was the main goal of this project. In many blanking processes where heavy duty conditions are applied, the use of hard metals, durable coatings and wear resistant tool steel is already established to extend the lifetime.

In this paper, an architecture of an automatic supervisory system for monitoring blanking punch wear under various die wear conditions is proposed. The system employs an autoregressive (AR) time-series model to predict the on-line captured peak blanking force. The AR model coefficients are updated by a modified least mean square (MLMS) adaptive filter so as to minimize the prediction error. An optimum number of AR model coefficients are selected to form the pattern vector which is classified by a least mean squared error (LMSE) classifier. Classification of the punch wear states is accomplished by a linear discriminant function (LDF). The performance of the system was evaluated through a series of blanking experiments.

40|$|Abstract. Two basic {{types of}} load for the tool active {{elements}} {{can be distinguished}} for the shear cutting process of sheet metal. For high strength, brittle materials, the stamping punch will be exposed to distinctive oscillating axial dynamic loads {{as a result of}} abrupt released potential energy, from the tool active elements, the <b>blanking</b> <b>tool</b> and the stamping press, caused by a sudden cracking of the sheet. In contrast, when shear cutting ductile materials, sheet metal will be drawn into the die clearance and the resulting friction between the punch and the cut surface can cause high forces when pulling the punch out of the hole. When using punches featuring a complex cutting peripheral form,- not available as a standard part- it is necessary to decide between head and shank of the punch manufactured out of one part or a shaft without head, which is usually cheaper and can be manufactured by electro-erosive wire-cutting. In the second case, a linking element must be accepted, transferring the load transmission between shaft and tool. This linking element, realized by a form lock or traction, can be the reason for premature failure of the punch. The two described cases of load, in combination with lacking knowledge of the real load on the link as well as eligibility of different punch linking types for each case of loading, caus...|$|E

From results of the preliminary study it can be concluded that all the selected steel substrates performed well during blanking operations. The best results were found with the Vanadis 4 e and 23 steel. A special coating could improve the adhesive wear of the reference steel 1. 2379. In case of the PM steels the use of a coating is optional. Furthermore DCT treatment could improve the flaking and wear behaviour in both the lab scale and industrial tests.

40|$|In hot stamping, the {{determination}} of the thermal contact conductance values between the <b>blank</b> and <b>tool</b> surface during the process is crucial for the purpose of simulating the blank rapid cooling inside the tool using finite element analysis (FEA). The thermal contact conductance value represents the coefficient of the heat transfer at the surface of two solid bodies in contact and is known to be influenced greatly by the applied pressure. In order to estimate the value and its dependency on applied pressure, the process of hot stamping was replicated and simplified into a process of compression of heated flat blank in between the tool at different applied pressure. The temperature of the <b>blank</b> and <b>tool</b> surface were measured by means of thermocouples installed inside the tool.

Electrochemical potentiodynamic polarisation studies have been carried out on the diamond deposited tool steel specimens in NaCl solutions of two different concentrations, 0. 01 M and 0. 50 M, respectively. The type of interlayer used for diamond coating on tool steel has a strong influence on the corrosion potential. The maximum shift in the equilibrium corrosion potential is observed for the silicon interlayer. However, it leads to selective dissolution of the carbide phase upon anodic polarisation. A near total resistance to pitting of the CrN coated tool steel specimens is observed with the introduction of a very thin diamond layer of 2 - 3 mum.
