5000|$|Since its {{foundation}} in 1965 in Le Havre, France, Sidel {{has been developing}} packaging technologies for the beverage industry. In 1961 the company developed the first plastic bottle made of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) as a container for edible oil and, later on, wine, milk and water. In 1973 Sidel released the first plastic HDPE (high-density polyethylene) bottle for milk, sterilised by ultra-heat treatment (UHT). In 1980 Sidel delivered its first PET <b>blow</b> <b>moulding</b> <b>machine</b> to the family-owned soft-drink company Barraclough in Great Britain. Sidel’s first international subsidiary opened in 1984 in Atlanta, USA. In the same year, Sidel also sold the first high-speed PET <b>blow</b> <b>moulding</b> <b>machine.</b> In the 1990s Sidel acquired the French companies Hema (1995), Cermex (1996) [...] and Gebo (1997). In 1997 Sidel introduced a system which combines <b>blow</b> <b>moulding,</b> filling and capping. In same year, the first Sidel dry preforms decontamination by H2O2 spray was launched with the Combi Disis. The development of an internal carbon-based coating in 1999 strengthened the barrier properties of PET packages to gases (O2 and CO2) and made PET-bottles usable for beer. In 2003 Sidel joined Tetra Laval and merged with the Italian company Simonazzi in 2005. Simonazzi was founded in 1850 and had its headquarters in Parma, Italy. In 2006, Sidel launched Predis™, its dry decontamination solution technology for preforms. In April 2013, Sidel announced the launch of a new company {{as part of the}} Sidel Group, Gebo Cermex. [...] Gebo Cermex focuses on engineering, line integration and end-of-line packaging. A partnership with Kortec was communicated in October 2013. The target of the co-operation is to develop new light-blocking PET milk bottles. In March 2014, the divestment of Swedish subsidiary, Tectubes, was announced.|$|R

Design/methodology/approach: The value for the Barus number for different dimensions of the nozzle gap and the distribution of the temperature field during <b>blow</b> <b>moulding</b> process have been determined; the product thickness profile has been defined; phenomena which occur during blowing stage have been registered. The investigations have been performed by means of the <b>blow</b> <b>moulding</b> <b>machine</b> of UFP- 05 type by IPTS – Metalchem Toruń using the designed and prepared <b>blow</b> <b>mould</b> with the sight-glass made of polycarbonate. Findings: The performed investigations enabled the insight study of uncontrolled phenomena which occur during each individual stage of the process and they showed the dependencies between these phenomena and the process parameters. Moreover, the detailed analyses enabled to determine the influence of these parameters on the physical features and dimensions of the finished goods. Research limitations/implications: The continuation of the investigations with use of extended <b>blow</b> <b>mould</b> design equipped in polycarbonate sight-glass which enabled the determination of the influence of the structure and mould cavity dimensions on the finished product wall thickness seems to be justified. It would be also useful to design the station for the precise non-touch measurements of Barus effect which enabled, except the measurements of the external diameter, the measurements of the finished product wall thickness.

40|$|A {{computational}} simulation {{and experimental}} {{work of the}} fluid flow through the pneumatic circuit used in a stretch <b>blow</b> <b>moulding</b> <b>machine</b> is presented in this paper. The computer code is built around a zero-dimensional thermodynamic model for the air blowing and recycling containers together with a non-linear time-variant deterministic model for the pneumatic three stations single acting valve manifold, which, in turn, is linked to a quasi-one-dimensional unsteady flow model for the interconnecting pipes. The flow through the pipes accounts for viscous friction, heat transfer, cross-sectional area variation, and entropy variation. Two different solving methods are applied: the method of characteristics and the Harten-Lax-Van Leer (HLL) Riemann first-order scheme. The numerical model allows prediction of the air blowing process and, more significantly, permits determination of the recycling rate at each operating cycle. A simplified experimental set-up of the industrial process was designed, and the pressure and temperature were adequately monitored. Predictions of the blowing process for various configurations proved {{to be in good}} agreement with the measured results. In addition, a novel design of a valve manifold intended for the polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastic bottle manufacturing industry is also presented.

The machine {{will be used for}} the production of plastic bottles suitable for bottling brewed beer at the microbrewery at Massey University Palmerston North. Premanufactured PET preforms have proven to be the most convenient and promising choice for the fabrication of blown bottles. Basic tests to understand the behaviour of the preforms and the challenges of the blowing process have been carried out. A special focus has been placed on the different circumstances at University in contrast to industrial bottle production in particular the needed air pressure to form the bottles. The following step was to find the ideal method and principle to handle the preforms and to transform them in the desired shape. Finally the design, drawing of the parts and assemblies were carried out with the 3 -D CAD software Solidworks. The designed parts for the bottle blower have been manufactured at the mechanical Workshop at Massey University. To control the bottle blower, the National Instruments USB interface was selected which required the design and manufacture of an additional driver interface card to protect the USB interface and convert the TTL levels into higher voltage. The final assembly and testing of the blower then concluded the practical work for this master project. A suitable design for the bottle production was found and the assembled Bottle Blower can now be used for the production of PET bottles...|$|R
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The relatively low deformation temperature of biaxially oriented PET excludes its use in many hot fill applications or hot washing {{as part of a}} reuse cycle, due to the shrinkage which generally occurs on reheating towards Tg. Isothermal, isometric annealing processes (referred to as heat-setting) can cause oriented PET to maintain its dimensional stability to higher temperatures. However, to experiment on a commercial stretch <b>blow</b> <b>moulding</b> <b>machine</b> is a very costly and time consuming process, justifying the requirement for an accurate simulation technique. The objective of this project was, therefore, to simulate the stretch <b>blow</b> <b>moulding</b> of PET with a heat-setting phase, by biaxially drawing PET sheets on a TM Long Stretcher, then to heat-set them in a separate phase using a purpose designed jig. A heat-setting rig was designed and constructed at IPTME. Due {{to the size of the}} proposed investigation window, a factorial experimental design (FED) technique was employed to characterise the behaviour of two commercial bottle grades of PET (B 90 N and B 95 A Laser) under a variety of draws and heat-setting conditions. These sheets were then characterised in terms of shrinkage, tensile properties and resistance to creep. This data was regressed to generate predictive model equations for both grades of material and in both major and minor draw axes. Using these equations, it is now possible to define a set of processing parameters which would give a bottle with lower and more uniform shrinkage (less draw dependent) with enhanced creep properties and at least comparable mechanical properties. To develop a more fundamental understanding of the process of heat-setting in biaxially drawn PET, as well as to prove the validity of the model equations, a separate series of conventional experiments was devised to investigate the two most significant predictor variables from the FED analysis; biaxial draw ratio and heat-setting temperature (for Laser only). This material was characterised by TMA, DSC and birefringence measurements. The DSC and birefringence measurements allow the effect of heat-setting and draw on crystallinity levels and orientation to be monitored. Orientation of both phases was studied in heat-set bottles using micro polarised FTIR...|$|R
40|$|Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET) {{has become}} the {{preferred}} material of choice for many packaging applications. A preference over glass due to its low weight, similar transparency to glass and cost consideration, including the availability of recycled PET feedstock via kerbside collection has provided newer opportunities for hot-fill applications. Ostensibly, this material is used for beverage markets requiring cold and hot filling (85 oC) of liquid foods. However due to the poor thermal stability of PET - due to its low glass transition temperature - an increase in elevated temperatures limits the number of market segments the material can be utilised. Current practices incorporate the heat-set process, aimed at improving the crystallisation kinetics within the amorphous and crystalline region. This body of work incorporates a single stage Injection Stretch <b>Blow</b> <b>Moulding</b> <b>machine</b> (ISBM). Modifications to conventional carbonated soft drink (CSD) beverage containers to include heat-set capabilities are incorporated. The current research study investigates {{the potential benefits of}} RPET blends for improving thermal stability at elevated temperatures.

Furthermore, changes in the physical properties to each PET beverage container were investigated which include; • process shrinkage (S 1), • hot-fill shrinkage (S 2) • Density changes via optimised DoE parameters.

40|$|Injection <b>moulding</b> and <b>blow</b> <b>moulding</b> are {{probably}} the most widely used process for manufacturing parts by using plastic materials. A wide variety of products are manufactured by using these two technologies, which vary greatly in their size, complexity, and application. The injection moulding process requires the use of an injection <b>moulding</b> <b>machine,</b> raw plastic material and a mould. The process cycle for injection moulding consists of the following four stages: clamping, injection, cooling and ejection. <b>Blow</b> <b>moulding</b> is a manufacturing process that is used to create hollow plastic parts by inflating a heated plastic tube until it fills a mould and forms the desired shape.
