5000|$|During the Second World War, in 1943 {{the town}} was {{occupied}} by the German army and found itself on the hot <b>border</b> (<b>Gothic</b> Line) between the fascist Republic of Salò and the part of Italy occupied by the British Army, which liberated Bagno di Romagna in September 1944. The multi-ethnic Commonwealth troops were joyfully welcomed by the population, who had suffered one year of dire straits and had witnessed brutal fightings between partisans {{on one side and}} Nazi occupiers on the other. In July 1943 about thirty local male civilians were killed by Wehrmacht troops as a retaliation for the killing of three Nazi soldiers by local partisans. As a result, the whole area developed anti-fascist sentiments that endured throughout the post-war period.|$|R

The volume gathers academic essays and reviews by scholars from different institutions in brazil and elsewhere. The texts offered here analyse Gothic cultural productions from different perspectives, exploring the growing field of Gothic studies worldwide in its many forms and approaches and constitute what {{we would like to}} call a cartography of the Gothic, as it crosses national and disciplinary borders in a variety of ways- a fertile ground for exploring local as well as wide-reaching interests and anxieties within, without, and across conventional geographic and generic <b>borders.</b> <b>Gothic</b> studies, the academic field that explores the Gothic text, has developed substantially over the last hundred years or s...|$|R

50|$|Meanwhile, Asterix and Obelix also stun {{the young}} legionary {{and enter the}} Gothic lands. While running into a <b>Gothic</b> <b>border</b> patrol, Obelix stupidly uses the cover up names he and Asterix used for their Roman {{disguise}}s, making the patrol think the Gauls are Romans. After Asterix and Obelix beat up the patrol, they disguise themselves as Goths by attacking two of them, infiltrating their barracks {{as members of the}} army. They escape from the Gothic army, but are soon captured again by the Goths and thrown in jail along with Rhetoric, who was also trying to flee. Although they are thrown in prison, Obelix easily breaks the door (another running gag) and they flee, taking Rhetoric with them to question. While at first he pretends to speak only Gothic, Rhetoric accidentally reveals that he can speak Gaulish and is forced to spill the beans. While trying to sneak into the Gothic town, Rhetoric screams and attracts a patrol. Although Asterix and Obelix beat up the patrol, they surrender to the last standing man to be brought to the Chief.|$|R

No, izostala su analitička i sustavna istraživanja odnosa slike i arhitekture. U tom su kontekstu bordure poseban izraz i neizostavan su, iako popratan likovni sadržaj. Painted {{borders are}} an {{important}} element in the ensemble of Istrian wall painting. On the wall surface they repeat the horizontals and verticals of the wall, and along the lines where walls (and ceiling) meet they underline their division. They also trace the contours of arches, divide painted surfaces into smaller areas and - on the plain and unarticulated walls in the small churches in Istria "take over the function of articulating surfaces and complementing the architectural element" (B. Fučić) In this article the author publishes the results of several years of systematic study of the motifs and composition of painted borders in The borders vary in dimension and plastic illusion. In the Medieval period they mostly resisted figuration. Romanesque borders tended to be large and to project a suggestion of volume contrasted to the flatness of figural presentation at that period. On the other hand, <b>Gothic</b> <b>borders</b> were reduced, a-tectonic and f lat, framing figurative scenes in which the figures were gradually becoming more voluminous and surrounded by scenery. Arranging her material, the author chooses a formal approach (without however neglecting style, semiology and technology) in her systematization of her findings into three typological groups (also presented on tables). The first group consists of geometrical borders (A). Some of these are based on the rectangle and square (A a 1 - 8), some on the circle (A b 1 - 6). This group includes borders decorated with interlace motifs. The second group includes vegetable motifs (B) divided into the acanthus leaf and scroll, the palmetto, ivy etc (B a 1 - 7) and f lower motifs: the rose, lily etc (B b 1 - 1). The author points out that it is often not possible to distinguish between leaf and floreal motifs owing to prevailing stylization, and repetition leading to simplification. The third group comprises combined borders (C), composed of geometric, vegetable and even figurative motifs. These borders also include the motif of "God 2 ̆ 7 s eye" or the Holy Trinity (C e 1 - 3) as well as the swastika (C f). Borders can offer good examples of historical and geographic sources and influences. The art of the East - ornamental and decorative by definition - seems to have exercised a strong influence on the painting of scenery borders...|$|R
