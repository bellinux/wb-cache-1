5|$|In several locations, traffic {{congestion}} along Route32 {{has led to}} suggestions to change or modify the road. The problems are most severe at the southern terminus, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> the only section of the road with issues.|$|E

50|$|There {{started a}} {{construction}} of the third aircraft (planned SP-AAX), <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> completed. There <b>were</b> some plans to complete it for a flight around the world, but they were abandoned due to financial problems. Also the designer (Zbysław Ciołkosz) planned a floatplane variant PWS-20ter for communication with Denmark and Sweden, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> realized.|$|R

5|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{imposing}} tomb {{of this period}} is that of Amenhotep III, WV22, located in the West Valley. It was re-investigated in the 1990s by a team from Waseda University, Japan, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> open to the public.|$|E
5|$|Selenium is a {{catalyst}} in some chemical reactions, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> widely used because of issues with toxicity. In X-ray crystallography, incorporation {{of one or}} more selenium atoms in place of sulfur helps with multiple-wavelength anomalous dispersion and single wavelength anomalous dispersion phasing.|$|E
5|$|A map of Kintzheim in Alsace from 1348 {{contains}} the text zu dem Russelinge, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> {{certain that this}} reference is to the grape variety. However, in 1477, Riesling was documented in Alsace under the spelling Rissling. In Wachau in Austria, {{there is a small}} stream and a small vineyard both called Ritzling, which are claimed locally to have given Riesling its name. However, {{there seems to be no}} documentary evidence to back this up, so this claim is not widely believed to be correct.|$|E

5|$|Although {{provisionally}} {{assigned the}} designation U-7, the submarine was commissioned as SM U-12 on 21 August 1914, with Linienschiffsleutnant Egon Lerch in command. U-12s activities over {{the early part}} of the war are not reported, but the boat's armament was augmented by a 3.7cm/23 (1.5in) quick-firing (QF) deck gun in November 1914. Sister boat U-5 had her first radio receiver installed at the same time her deck gun was added, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> reported whether U-12 did as well.|$|E
5|$|American {{gooseberry}} mildew and {{powdery mildew}} can infect {{the leaves and}} shoot tips, and botrytis may cause the fruit to rot in a wet season. Currant and gooseberry leaf spot (Drepanopeziza ribis) is another disease of blackcurrants, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> usually a serious problem as most cultivars now have some resistance.|$|E
5|$|As is {{discussed}} below, {{the reason for}} the delay was probably simply that neither the Athenians nor the Persians were willing to risk battle initially. This then raises the question of why the battle occurred when it did. Herodotus explicitly tells us that the Greeks attacked the Persians (and the other sources confirm this), <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> clear why they did this before the arrival of the Spartans. There are two main theories to explain this.|$|E

5|$|As {{would be}} {{expected}} for a road crossing the Pennines, Snake Pass has several dangerous bends and blind summits. Like many roads in the North of England passing through similar terrain, Snake Pass has a poor safety record in comparison to other roads in the United Kingdom <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> as dangerous as other roads bisecting hilly terrain {{in this part of}} England. It was not among the top 10 in a list of the most dangerous roads published in July 2010, despite nine of the top ten being in Northern England.|$|E
5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of World War I, U-6 {{was one of only}} four fully operational U-boats in the Austro-Hungarian Navy fleet, and was stationed at Cattaro by late 1914. U-6s activities over {{the early part of the}} war are not reported, but the boat's armament was augmented by a 3.7cm/23 (1.5in) quick-firing (QF) deck gun in December 1915. Sister boat U-5 had her first radio receiver installed at the same time her deck gun was added, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> reported whether U-6 did, too.|$|E
5|$|By {{tradition}} Wuffa {{was named}} {{as the son}} of Wehha and the father of Tytila, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> known with any certainty that Wuffa was an actual historical figure.

5|$|Coprolalia (the {{spontaneous}} utterance {{of socially}} objectionable or taboo words or phrases) {{is the most}} publicized symptom of Tourette's, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> required for a diagnosis of Tourette's and only about 10% of Tourette's patients exhibit it. Echolalia (repeating the words of others) and palilalia (repeating one's own words) occur in a minority of cases, while the most common initial motor and vocal tics are, respectively, eye blinking and throat clearing.|$|E
5|$|Daimler-Benz and Krupp {{were the}} main {{builders}} of the Sd.Kfz. 8 during the war, but Krauss-Maffei produced 315 in 1940—41 and Škoda joined {{in the last years}} of the war. 1615 were on hand on 20 December 1942. 507 were built in 1943 and 602 in 1944. Approximately 4000 were built in total. The Sd.Kfz. 8 was used by Czechoslovakia after the war, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> known if production continued at Škoda or when they were finally discarded.|$|E
5|$|Despite the hectic {{schedule}} {{during this}} short visit, Wolfgang still {{found time to}} write his Symphony in F, K.112 (No.13). He contrived a further symphony from the Ascanio overture, by adding a finale to the two existing movements. Another symphony, K.96/111b, in C major, is sometimes allocated to this visit to Milan, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> certain when (or indeed whether) Wolfgang actually wrote it.|$|E
