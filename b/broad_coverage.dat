5|$|The {{first true}} {{national}} census with exhaustive and <b>broad</b> <b>coverage</b> {{was carried out}} in 1872. The small number of people and small number of towns reported by the census reveal Brazil's enormous territory to have been sparsely populated. It showed Brazil as having a total population of 9,930,478 inhabitants. Estimates made by the government in prior decades showed 4,000,000 inhabitants in 1823 and gave a figure of 7,000,700 in 1854. The population was distributed across 20 provinces and the Neutral Municipality (the Empire's capital) with 641 municipalities.|$|E

25|$|The {{newsroom}} on CTC {{was subject}} to extensive staff cuts and the cancellation of the half-hour weekend bulletin was the most obvious sign things were changing. Over the next five years, limited resources were invested into the newsroom and technical glitches were becoming more obvious to viewers. Ten year old camera tapes were having to be reused with tape wear showing on screen. Sound desks from the early 1970s were also beginning to fail leading to breaks in audio on-air. Despite the lack of investment in technical equipment, the CTC newsroom maintained its legacy of quality news through its selection of local and national stories and <b>broad</b> <b>coverage</b> of international news.|$|E

25|$|The subsidy {{stratification}} {{system in}} Colombia has proven fairly ineffective at channeling subsidies towards the poor. Although the scheme is broad in its coverage and excludes {{no more than}} 2 percent of the poor for services with <b>broad</b> <b>coverage</b> such as electricity, water and sanitation, there are also high leakage rates. Some 50-60 percent of subsidy beneficiaries are from {{the top half of}} the income distribution and, moreover, only 30-35 percent of subsidy resources are captured by the poor. Nevertheless, the performance of this subsidy scheme varies depending on the service considered, being water the sector with the poorest performance and telephony the one with the best behavior.|$|E
25|$|Mainstream {{periodicals}} gave A New Kind of Science unusually <b>broad</b> <b>coverage</b> for {{a science}} book, including articles in The New York Times, Newsweek, Wired, and The Economist. Some scientists criticized {{the book as}} abrasive and arrogant, and perceived a fatal flaw—that simple systems such as cellular automata are not complex enough to describe the degree of complexity present in evolved systems, and observed that Wolfram ignored the research categorizing the complexity of systems. Although critics accept Wolfram's result showing universal computation, they view it as minor and dispute Wolfram's claim of a paradigm shift. Others found that the work contained valuable insights and refreshing ideas. Wolfram addressed his critics {{in a series of}} blog posts.|$|E
25|$|As the Britannica is {{a general}} encyclopaedia, it does not seek to compete with {{specialised}} encyclopaedias such as the Encyclopaedia of Mathematics or the Dictionary of the Middle Ages, which can devote much more space to their chosen topics. In its first years, the Britannicas main competitor was the general encyclopaedia of Ephraim Chambers and, soon thereafter, Rees's Cyclopædia and Coleridge's Encyclopædia Metropolitana. In the 20th century, successful competitors included Collier's Encyclopedia, the Encyclopedia Americana, and the World Book Encyclopedia. Nevertheless, from the 9th edition onwards, the Britannica was widely considered to have the greatest authority of any general English language encyclopaedia, especially because of its <b>broad</b> <b>coverage</b> and eminent authors. The print version of the Britannica was significantly more expensive than its competitors.|$|E

Most universities in the UK require IB students to take more courses than A-level students—requiring, for instance, four As and two Bs from an IB student, whereas an A-level student will only need an ABB—because each subject taken as a part of the IB gives a less <b>broad</b> <b>coverage</b> of a similar subject taken at A-level.|$|E
500|$|The Supreme Court ruled {{unanimously}} {{to uphold}} the regulation as within the Treasury Department's statutory authority to issue and as a reasonable construction of FICA. The Court clarified that the deferential standard of Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc. (1984) applied, notwithstanding prior Court rulings that had adopted a more stringent standard to tax regulations. Applying Chevron, the Court first found that Congress had left the matter to the agency because the statute was silent on the definition of [...] "student" [...] and its applicability to medical residents specifically. Second, the Court found that the regulation was a reasonable interpretation of the statute, and that its clear line helped distinguish workers who study and students who work, simplified enforcement, and furthered the <b>broad</b> <b>coverage</b> of Social Security.|$|E
