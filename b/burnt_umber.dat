25|$|Before the Industrial Revolution, many {{pigments}} {{were known}} by the location where they were produced. Pigments based on minerals and clays often bore {{the name of the}} city or region where they were mined. Raw Sienna and Burnt Sienna came from Siena, Italy, while Raw Umber and <b>Burnt</b> <b>Umber</b> came from Umbria. These pigments were among the easiest to synthesize, and chemists created modern colors based on the originals that were more consistent than colors mined from the original ore bodies. But the place names remained.|$|E
25|$|For the 1978 season, the Golden Gaters {{changed the}} colors of their team logo and made minor {{alterations}} {{to the way the}} stings on the racquet included in the logo appear. The old colors were <b>burnt</b> <b>umber</b> and yellow. The new colors were purple and orange. Corresponding changes were made to the uniforms worn by the players and coaches. In a February 1978 trade that relieved the financially struggling Indiana Loves of the remainder of their obligation under the two-year $250,000 contract for Vitas Gerulaitis, the Golden Gaters acquired Gerulaitis for cash consideration and then sent him to the New York Apples in exchange for Sandy Mayer.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the first}} uses was as a pigment. The yellow form {{produced}} yellow ochre for which Cyprus was famous, while the darker forms produced more earthy tones. Roasting the limonite changed it partially to hematite, producing red ochres, <b>burnt</b> <b>umbers</b> and siennas.|$|R

[...] Weguelin's palette included [...] "vermilion, light red, rose madder, purple madder, brown madder, yellow ochre, cadmium 1 and 2, oxide of chromium, oxide of chromium (transparent), black and Chinese white, Vandyke brown, raw <b>umber,</b> <b>burnt</b> umber." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{painting}} was made using acrylic Liquitex {{on a white}} cotton duck canvas, with no underdrawing. Hockney uses a limited palette - cobalt blue, ultramarine blue, raw sienna, <b>burnt</b> sienna, raw <b>umber,</b> Hooker's green, Naples yellow and titanium white - applied either mixed together or as tints. Apart from the splash, the {{painting was}} finished very evenly and flat with a paint roller, {{in two or three}} layers, with the few details - tree, grass, chair, reflections - overpainted. The central splash was heavily worked over a period of about two weeks using a variety of small brushes. A wide border and central narrow stripe at the pool's edge are left unpainted. The border creates an effect like a Polaroid photograph. The painting has been viewed as a critical link in Hockney's ruminations on time between his earlier Picture Emphasising Stillness and his later [...] "joiners" [...] portraits, created by collaging many photographs of the same subject taken over a period of hours.|$|R
500|$|Design firm Sarofsky {{once again}} {{worked on the}} film's main-on-end title {{sequence}}, having done the same for Winter Soldier. The sequence used [...] "muted and mottled, <b>burnt</b> <b>umber</b> and steel blue and cold grey" [...] colors, which were stark contrasts to the sequences for Winter Soldier and The First Avenger (the later created by Method Design) which were [...] "a minimalist graphic approach, reducing the key players to silhouettes and paring the palette down to three colors" [...] and [...] "vibrant and iconic propaganda art comes to life, enticing the viewer to join the fray", respectively. Creative director Erin Sarofsky noted {{one of the challenges}} for Civil Wars sequence was [...] "to make it feel like a Captain America title sequence and not an Avengers sequence" [...] given the number of characters in the film.|$|E
2500|$|The Practice of Water-Colour Painting {{describes}} his palette as [...] "cendre blue, French blue, oxide of chromium (opaque and transparent), Hooker's green, No. 1, yellow ochre, aureolin, cadmium orange, raw sienna, burnt sienna, purple madder, rose madder, light red, brown madder, Vandyke brown, raw umber, and flake white; and occasionally vermilion, <b>burnt</b> <b>umber,</b> and lampblack." ...|$|E

He was an elegant old gentleman, as thin and tall as a trout rod, with frazzled shirt-cuffs and specs on a black string.

I was not, therefore, {{at a loss}} to {{find out}} what Dante meant by the word; but I was {{at a loss to}} account for his not, as it seemed, {{acknowledging}} the existence of the color of brown at all; for if he called dark neutral tint [...] "brown," [...] it remained a question what term he would use for things of the color of <b>burnt</b> <b>umber.</b> But, one day, just when I was puzzling myself about this, I happened to be sitting by one of our best living modern colorists, watching him at his work, when he said, suddenly, and by mere accident, after we had been talking of other things, [...] "Do you know I have found that there is no brown in Nature? What we call brown is always a variety either of orange or purple. It never can be represented by umber, unless altered by contrast." ...|$|E
60|$|Shall {{the names}} {{of so many of}} our colors {{continue}} to be derived from those of obscure foreign localities, as Naples yellow, Prussian blue, raw Sienna, <b>burnt</b> <b>Umber,</b> Gamboge?--(surely the Tyrian purple must have faded by this time),--or from comparatively trivial articles of commerce,-- chocolate, lemon, coffee, cinnamon, claret?--(shall we compare our Hickory to a lemon, or a lemon to a Hickory?)--or from ores and oxides which few ever see? Shall we so often, when describing to our neighbors the color of something we have seen, refer them, not to some natural object in our neighborhood, but perchance to a bit of earth fetched {{from the other side of}} the planet, which possibly they may find at the apothecary's, but which probably neither they nor we ever saw? Have we not an earth under our feet,--ay, and a sky over our heads? Or is the last all ultramarine? What do we know of sapphire, amethyst, emerald, ruby, amber, and the like,--most of us who take these names in vain? Leave these precious words to cabinet-keepers, virtuosos, and maids-of-honor,-- to the Nabobs, Begums, and Chobdars of Hindostan, or wherever else. I do not see why, since America and her autumn woods have been discovered, our leaves should not compete with the precious stones in giving names to colors; and, indeed, I believe that in course of time {{the names of}} some of our trees and shrubs, as well as flowers, will get into our popular chromatic nomenclature.|$|E

50|$|The first {{recorded}} use of <b>burnt</b> <b>umber</b> as a color name in English was in 1650.|$|E
50|$|In {{its natural}} form, it's called raw umber. When heated (calcinated), the color becomes more intense, {{and the color}} is known as <b>burnt</b> <b>umber.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Raw umber and <b>burnt</b> <b>umber</b> {{are two of}} {{the oldest}} {{pigments}} used by man. Umber is a brown clay, containing a large amount of iron oxide and between five and twenty percent manganese oxide, which give the color. Its shade varies from a greenish brown to a dark brown. It takes its name from the Italian region of Umbria, where it was formerly mined. The principal source today is the island of Cyprus. <b>Burnt</b> <b>umber</b> is the same pigment which has been roasted (calcined), which turns the pigment darker and more reddish.|$|E
50|$|<b>Burnt</b> <b>umber</b> {{is made by}} heating raw umber, which dehydrates {{the iron}} oxides and changes them {{partially}} to the more reddish hematite. It's used for both oil and water color paint.|$|E
50|$|When natural sienna and umber {{pigments}} are heated, {{they are}} dehydrated {{and some of}} the limonite is transformed into hematite, giving them more reddish colours, called burnt sienna and <b>burnt</b> <b>umber.</b>|$|E

50|$|The {{length of}} the {{forewings}} is 4.7 - 7 mm. The ground colour of the forewings is cream, suffused with cinnamon and fuscous scales. The markings vary from cinnamon to <b>burnt</b> <b>umber.</b> The hindwings are dark drab. Adults have been recorded on wing from May to August, probably in multiple generations per year.|$|E

Molonglo Press in the ACT published his next four poetry books, including Shadow Swimmer, which won the 1996 ACT Book of the Year Award. Pandanus Books at the ANU then released his verse novel Blood and Old Belief in 2003. It Feels Like Disbelief was published in 2007 by Salt Publishing (Cambridge, UK).

In Northern Europe, Jan van Eyck featured rich earth browns in his portraits to set off the brighter colors.|$|E
