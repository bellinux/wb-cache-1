50|$|Xanthium spinosum is {{a species}} of {{flowering}} plant in the aster family known by many common names, including spiny cocklebur, prickly <b>burweed</b> and Bathurst burr.|$|E
50|$|Arctium minus, {{commonly}} known as lesser burdock, <b>burweed,</b> louse-bur, common burdock, button-bur, cuckoo-button, or wild rhubarb, is a biennial plant. This plant is native to Europe, but has become an invasive weed in Australia, North and South America, and other places.|$|E
50|$|Amsinckia calycina, {{also known}} as hairy fiddleneck or yellow <b>burweed,</b> is a species of fiddleneck. It is native to Argentina and Chile and naturalised in Australia. It is an annual herb, growing to between 15 and 50 cm high and has pale yellow flowers. The species is {{poisonous}} to mammals.|$|E
50|$|Freshwater marshes {{surrounding}} San Mateo Creek {{exist in}} a strip {{just a few hundred}} feet wide and draw their water supply primarily from emerging groundwater. The most prominent plants are bulrush, specifically California bulrush, and cattail. There are also several species of <b>burweeds</b> and ferns, and on the edges of the marshes and on the surrounding small meadows, goldenrod, hedge-nettle, fleshy jaumea, Mexican rush, saltgrass, and iceplant.|$|R
5000|$|The {{speckled}} madtom inhabits {{small to}} moderate-sized streams. They often inhabit very shallow riffles with sand, rock or gravel bottoms. During the day speckled madtoms will rest {{in areas with}} aquatic vegetation such as pondweed or <b>burweed.</b> However, due to their nocturnal feeding patterns, they will leave these areas at night to go feed. Feeding begins at dusk {{and the amount of}} food in their stomach will increase until dawn when the feeding stops. Their diet is mostly insect larvae, especially midge larvae. They detect their food with their sensory barbels, and their vision plays little part in their feeding behavior. Major competition for the speckled madtom comes from other species from the Noturus genus. The only known predators of the speckled madtom are the rock bass (Ambloplites rupestris) and larger Noturus species. [...] In order to protect themselves from predation, all Noturus species have developed a venomous sting from their pectoral spines; however, the speckled madtom has a relatively low level of toxicity.|$|E
40|$|Methane {{oxidation}} {{associated with}} the belowground tissues of a common aquatic macrophyte, the <b>burweed</b> Sparganium eurycarpum, was assayed in situ by a chamber technique with acetylene or methyl fluoride as a methanotrophic inhibitor at a headspace concentration of 3 to 4 %. Acetylene and methyl fluoride inhibited both methane oxidation and peat methanogenesis. However, inhibition of methanogenesis resulted in no obvious short-term effect on methane fluxes. Since neither inhibitor adversely affected plant metabolism and both inhibited methanotrophy equally well, acetylene was employed for routine assays because of its low cost and ease of use. Root-associated methanotrophy consumed a variable but significant {{fraction of the total}} potential methane flux; values varied between 1 and 58 % (mean (plusmn) standard deviation, 27. 0 % (plusmn) 6. 0 %) with no consistent temporal or spatial pattern during late summer. The absolute amount of methane oxidized was not correlated with the total potential methane flux; this suggested that parameters other than methane availability (e. g., oxygen availability) controlled the rates of methane oxidation. Estimates of diffusive methane flux and oxidation at the peat surface indicated that methane emission occurred primarily through aboveground plant tissues; the absolute magnitude of methane oxidation was also greater in association with roots than at the peat surface. However, the relative extent of oxidation was greater at the latter locus...|$|E
40|$|The {{survey was}} {{conducted}} from December 2013 up to April 2014 {{with the objective of}} assessing potentially poisonous plants in and around Horro Gudurru Wollega, Western Ethiopia. A total of 354 Volunteer individuals (248 livestock owners, 69 animal health practitioners and 37 traditional healers) were interviewed using separately structured questionnaires. In this study 24 toxic plant species were identified and documented during the period in the study areas. The major problems that expose the livestock to the toxic plants as complained by study participants were predisposing factors like shortage of feed (55. 6 %) and nutritional deficiency (24. 3 %). The animals are usually poisoned at the end of rainy season (58. 2 %) and during the dry season (24 %). The most common plant parts that cause toxicosis to the livestock were whole and leaf. Among the toxic plants Medicago <b>burweed</b> (39. 9 %), Prunus africana (16. 9 %), Plantago lanceolata (14. 1 %), Braken fren (10. 1 %) and Snowdina, polystarch (9. 3 %) were the most frequently complained toxic plants in the study areas. The majority of the toxic plants that cause toxicosis to the livestock were by single exposure and bovine species were found to be susceptible poisoned animals. The present survey indicates the existence of high toxic plant in the area that needs interventions to reduce livestock exposure and further research to determine the toxicogenic ingredients of the plants...|$|E
