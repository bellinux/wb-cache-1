5|$|Baldwin {{called a}} general {{election}} for 30 May 1929. Chamberlain expected the Conservatives to easily triumph, and {{thought he would be}} moved either to the Exchequer or be asked to serve at the Colonial Office, where Joseph Chamberlain had made his mark. Chamberlain easily won in Edgbaston, which he represented {{for the rest of his}} life, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>general</b> election resulted in a hung parliament, with Labour holding the most seats. Baldwin and his Government resigned, and Labour leader Ramsay MacDonald took office.|$|E
5|$|Desha's major {{accomplishment}} {{as governor}} {{was in the}} area of internal improvements. In 1825, he convinced the legislature to fund the creation of the Louisville and Portland Canal on the Falls of the Ohio. The canal opened in 1830, and proved very profitable, so much so that Desha lamented the fact that the state had split the cost of the project – and consequently, its profits – with the federal government and private investors. He also urged state investment in a turnpike joining Maysville to Louisville via Lexington. He advocated using excess money earmarked for education to construct hard-surfaced roads in the state, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>General</b> Assembly was less responsive to this suggestion.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{essentially}} African American {{nature of}} ragtime, {{it is most}} commonly considered the first style of American popular music to be truly black music; ragtime brought syncopation and a more authentic black sound to popular music. Popular ragtime songs were notated and sold as sheet music, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>general</b> style was played more informally across the nation; these amateur performers played a more free-flowing form of ragtime that eventually became a major formative influence on jazz.|$|E

5|$|During {{his term}} as {{lieutenant}} governor, Breathitt {{was one of}} several proposed candidates to succeed John Rowan in the United States Senate, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>General</b> Assembly deadlocked over the appointment and the seat went unfilled until the Assembly's next term. In the next gubernatorial election in 1832, Breathitt was the Democratic nominee for governor. Again, Breathitt won, but James Turner Morehead, the Whig candidate for lieutenant governor, defeated Breathitt's running mate. Initially, Breathitt enjoyed popularity for his public condemnation of John C. Calhoun's doctrine of nullification, but he did not fare well in state politics because the Whigs controlled the legislature. He died in office of tuberculosis on February 21, 1834.|$|E
5|$|On 9 February 782, Harun {{departed}} Baghdad; the Arabs {{crossed the}} Taurus Mountains by the Cilician Gates, and swiftly took the border fortress of Magida. They then advanced along the military roads across the plateau into Phrygia. There, Harun left his lieutenant, the hadjib al-Rabi' ibn Yunus, to besiege Nakoleia and guard his rear, while another force, reportedly 30,000 men, under al-Barmaki (an unspecified {{member of the}} powerful Barmakid family, probably Yahya ibn Khalid), was sent to raid the rich western coastlands of Asia Minor. Harun himself, with the main army, advanced to the Opsician Theme. The accounts of subsequent events in the primary sources (Theophanes the Confessor, Michael the Syrian, and al-Tabari) differ on the details, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>general</b> course of the campaign can be reconstructed.|$|E
5|$|On September 11, the {{legislature}} {{passed a resolution}} instructing Magoffin to order the Confederate forces (but not the Union forces) to leave the state. The Governor vetoed the resolution, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>General</b> Assembly overrode his veto, and Magoffin gave the order. The next week, the assembly officially requested {{the assistance of the}} Union and asked the governor to call out the state militia to join the Federal forces. Magoffin also vetoed this request. Again the assembly overrode his veto and Magoffin acquiesced.|$|E

The footman shut the door behind them and they waited.|$|R

50|$|The 2007 Allan Cup {{was held}} in Stony Plain, Alberta, from April 16-21. The Kings opened the tournament with a 4-1 loss to the Chinook League {{champion}} Bentley (Alberta) Generals.

5|$|President James Monroe and Congress invited Lafayette {{to visit}} the United States in 1824, in part to {{celebrate}} the nation's upcoming 50thanniversary. Monroe intended to have Lafayette travel on an American warship, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>general</b> felt having such a vessel as transport was undemocratic, and booked passage on a merchantman. LouisXVIII did not approve of the trip, and his officers had troops disperse the crowd that gathered at Le Havre to see Lafayette off.|$|E
5|$|Section Five {{establishes}} {{that the}} only qualifications to hold office in Virginia are that a person {{must have been a}} Virginia resident for at least one year and eligible to vote. Any statute or rule requiring other qualifications is constitutionally invalid under this section. <b>But,</b> <b>the</b> <b>General</b> Assembly can impose local residency requirements for election to local governmental bodies or for election to the Assembly in representation of particular districts.|$|E
5|$|The {{combination}} of the humiliation of Casey, {{the deaths of the}} topmen, and the severe punishment {{of the rest of the}} sailors appears to have driven the crew to mutiny. These factors, however, were arguably the final events in a series of harsh and brutal punishments by the captain. Dudley Pope, in his book The Black Ship, argues that it was not Pigot's cruelty that drove the men to mutiny <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>general</b> injustice that he showed in his favouritism to some and overly harsh punishment of others. Had Pigot remained more even-handed in his leadership, the mutiny might have been avoided.|$|E

5|$|Governor Crittenden {{resigned}} on July 31, 1850 {{to accept}} President Millard Fillmore's appointment as attorney general, and Helm ascended to the governorship. As governor, Helm vetoed a legislative plan to cover deficits {{in the public}} school fund by drawing money from the state's sinking fund, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>General</b> Assembly overrode the veto. He urged the legislature to fund a survey of the state's mineral reserves and a census of the state's agricultural and manufacturing resources. He called for spending on internal improvements and for raising judges' salaries to attract more qualified jurists to the bench. He also sought a ban on the carrying of concealed deadly weapons. The legislature did not act on any of these proposed reforms. The only part of Helm's agenda that did progress through the General Assembly was election reform.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{controversial}} measures Daniels successfully pushed through was the state adoption of Daylight Saving Time, which Daniels argued would save the state money on energy costs. Although the state is in the Eastern Time Zone, Indiana's counties had adopted their own time zone practices, and in practice the state effectively observed two different times, and {{the central part of the}} state maintained a single time—Eastern Standard—year round. Interests for both EST and CST time zones had prevented the official adoption of daylight saving since the 1930s, and had led to decades of debate. Daniels pressed for the entire state to switch to Central Time, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>General</b> Assembly could not come to terms. Ultimately after a long debate, they adopted Eastern Daylight Saving Time in April 2005, the measure passing by one vote, putting all but northwestern and southwestern Indiana on the same time for the first time.|$|E
5|$|The {{failure of}} the Arab siege led to a {{profound}} change {{in the nature of}} warfare between Byzantium and the Caliphate. The Muslim goal of conquest of Constantinople was effectively abandoned, and the frontier between the two empires stabilized along the line of the Taurus and Antitaurus Mountains, over which both sides continued to launch regular raids and counter-raids. In this incessant border warfare, frontier towns and fortresses changed hands frequently, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>general</b> outline of the border remained unaltered for over two centuries, until the Byzantine conquests of the 10th century. The eastern fleets of the Caliphate entered a century-long decline; only the Ifriqiyan fleets maintained regular raids on Byzantine Sicily, until they too subsided after 752. Indeed, {{with the exception of the}} advance of the Abbasid army under Harun al-Rashid up to Chrysopolis in 782, no other Arab army would ever come within sight of the Byzantine capital again. Consequently, on the Muslim side the raids themselves eventually acquired an almost ritual character, and were valued mostly as a demonstration of the continuing jihad and sponsored by the Caliph as a symbol of his role as the leader of the Muslim community.|$|E
