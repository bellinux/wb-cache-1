5|$|The Bhutanese {{subsequently}} redesigned their flag {{to match}} the measurements of the flag of India, which they believed fluttered better than their own. Other modifications such as changing the red <b>background</b> <b>color</b> to orange led to the current design, in use since 1969. The National Assembly of Bhutan codified a code of conduct in 1972 to formalize the flag's design and establish protocol regarding acceptable flag sizes and conditions for flying the flag.|$|E
5|$|The President of Lithuania {{was officially}} given a {{standard}} by the Seimas in 1993. The standard is the State Emblem of Lithuania {{charged in the}} center on a single-color background. Under state law, the <b>background</b> <b>color</b> is stated as purple, but the color used in practice is dark red. The ratio of the standard is 1:1.2.|$|E
5|$|Some {{harmless}} {{milk snake}} (Lampropeltis triangulum) subspecies, the moderately toxic false coral snakes (genus Erythrolamprus), and the deadly coral snakes (genus Micrurus) {{all have a}} red <b>background</b> <b>color</b> with black and white / yellow rings. In this system, both the milk snakes and the deadly coral snakes are mimics, whereas the false coral snakes are the model. It has also been suggested that this system could be an instance of pseudomimicry, the similar colour patterns having evolved independently in similar habitats.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Background: Software {{product line}} {{engineering}} provides an effective mechanism to implement variable software. However, {{the usage of}} preprocessors, which is typical in industry, is heavily criticized, because it often leads to obfuscated code. Using <b>background</b> <b>colors</b> to support comprehensibility has shown effective, however, scalability to large software product lines (SPLs) is questionable. Aim: Our goal is to implement and evaluate scalable usage of <b>background</b> <b>colors</b> for industrial-sized SPLs. Method: We designed and implemented scalable concepts in a tool called FeatureCommander. To evaluate its effectiveness, we conducted a controlled experiment with a large real-world SPL with over 160, 000 lines of code and 340 features. We used a within-subjects design with treatments colors and no colors. We compared correctness and response time of tasks for both treatments. Results: For certain kinds of tasks, <b>background</b> <b>colors</b> improve program comprehension. Furthermore, subjects generally favor <b>background</b> <b>colors.</b> Conclusion: We show that <b>background</b> <b>colors</b> can improve program comprehension in large SPLs. Based on these encouraging results, we will continue our work improving program comprehension in large SPLs. I...|$|R

5|$|The {{single most}} major aspect of shell {{variation}} within the genus {{is the color}} patterning. In general, many arboreal snails are brightly colored, obvious examples being the bulimulid genera Drymaeus and Liguus, the cepolid Polymita, and the camaenid Papuina. However, Polymita, Liguus and Amphidromus are particularly noted for their color variations. The basic ground color of Amphidromus appears to be yellow, and this color is usually (except for Amphidromus entobaptus) confined to the surface layers of the shell, since worn specimens appear to be nearly devoid of color. In some species the <b>background</b> <b>color</b> is whitish, and a few have dark background colors. The apical whorls are pale, purple, brown, or black, and this sometimes varies within a population (as in A. quadrasi). A few species, for example A. schomburgki, have a deciduous green periostracum.|$|E
5|$|Jarvis and DeMar playtested {{the game}} themselves, and {{continually}} tweaked the designs {{as the project}} progressed. Though games at the time began to use scrolling to have larger levels, the developers chose a single screen to confine the action. To instill panic in the player, the character was initially placed {{in the center of}} the game's action, and had to deal with projectiles coming from multiple directions, as opposed previous shooting games such as Space Invaders and Galaxian, where the enemies attacked from a single direction. This made for more challenging gameplay, an aspect Jarvis took pride in. Enemies were assigned to stages in different groups to create themes. Early stages were designed to be relatively simple compared to later ones. The level of difficulty was designed to increase quickly so players would struggle to complete later stages. In retrospect, Jarvis attributes his and DeMar's average player skills to the game's balanced design. Though they made the game as difficult as they could, the high end of their skills ended up being a good challenge for expert players. The graphics were given a simple appearance to avoid a cluttered game screen, and object designs were made distinct from each other to avoid confusion. Black was chosen as the <b>background</b> <b>color</b> to help characters stand out and reduce clutter.|$|E
5|$|The two dorsal fins are {{of nearly}} equal size and placed far {{back on the}} body, with the first {{originating}} over the latter third of the pelvic fin bases and the second over {{the latter half of}} the anal fin base. The pectoral and pelvic fins are broad and rounded; the males have stout claspers. The pelvic and anal fins are about as large as the dorsal fins. The broad caudal fin comprises about a fifth of the total body length and has a strong notch near the tip of the upper lobe and an indistinct lower lobe. The skin is thick and covered by well-calcified arrowhead-shaped dermal denticles. The coloration of the dark shyshark is highly variable, and particular individuals can resemble any of the other shyshark species. The <b>background</b> <b>color</b> ranges from light brown to reddish to grayish to almost black above, transitioning abruptly to white or cream below, sometimes with dark blotches beneath the paired fins. There may be 68 orange, brown, or blackish variably shaped saddles along the back and tail, edged more or less obviously in black. There may also be white spots within or within and between the saddles.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Human {{performance}} on color discrimination in visual display terminals {{may be affected}} by illuminant colors, the level of ambient illumination and <b>background</b> <b>colors</b> of the monitor. Few {{studies have focused on}} this topic. This study investigated human color discrimination ability in a simulated control room. Ten subjects were recruited as participants to perform a series of experimental tasks. A complete factorial (2 × 3 × 3) within-subject design was used. The independent variables were three illuminant colors (red, blue, and white), two ambient illumination levels (50 lux and 300 lux), and three <b>background</b> <b>colors</b> (black, blue and brown); the three dependent variables were the color discrimination ability (error scores), completion time and subject preference. The results showed that the illuminant colors and the screen <b>background</b> <b>colors</b> both significantly influenced human color discrimination ability (p< 0. 01). The result of this research can be used in control room design when considering the effect of color...|$|R
