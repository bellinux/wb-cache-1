5|$|Lipids are {{the most}} diverse group of biochemicals. Their main {{structural}} uses are as part of biological membranes both internal and external, such as the cell membrane, or {{as a source of}} energy. Lipids are usually defined as hydrophobic or amphipathic biological molecules but will dissolve in organic solvents such as benzene or chloroform. The fats are a large group of compounds that contain fatty acids and glycerol; a glycerol molecule attached to three fatty acid esters is called a triacylglyceride. Several variations on this basic structure exist, including alternate <b>backbones</b> such as sphingosine in the sphingolipids, and hydrophilic groups such as phosphate as in phospholipids. Steroids such as cholesterol are another major class of lipids.|$|E
5|$|Polyketides are {{synthesized}} by polymerization of acetyl and propionyl subunits by classic enzymes {{as well as}} iterative and multimodular {{enzymes that}} share mechanistic features with the fatty acid synthases.

Many polyketides are cyclic molecules whose <b>backbones</b> are often further modified by glycosylation, methylation, hydroxylation, oxidation, or other processes. Many commonly used anti-microbial, anti-parasitic, and anti-cancer agents are polyketides or polyketide derivatives, such as erythromycins, tetracyclines, avermectins, and antitumor epothilones.|$|E
5|$|Holliday {{junctions}} {{may exist}} {{in a variety of}} conformational isomers with different patterns of coaxial stacking between the four double-helical arms. Coaxial stacking is the tendency of nucleic acid blunt ends to bind to each other, by interactions between the exposed bases. There are three possible stacking conformers: an unstacked form and two stacked forms. The unstacked form dominates in the absence of divalent cations such as Mg2+, because of electrostatic repulsion between the negatively charged <b>backbones</b> of the strands. In the presence of at least about 0.1 mM Mg2+, the electrostatic repulsion is counteracted and the stacked structures predominate. As of 2000, it was not known with certainty whether the electrostatic shielding was the result of site-specific binding of cations to the junction, or the presence of a diffuse collection of the ions in solution.|$|E

5|$|The Serine-Histidine-Aspartate motif {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{thoroughly}} characterised catalytic motifs in biochemistry. The triad is exemplified by chymotrypsin, a model serine protease from the PA superfamily which uses its triad to hydrolyse protein <b>backbones.</b> The aspartate is hydrogen bonded to the histidine, increasing the pKa of its imidazole nitrogen from 7 to around 12. This allows the histidine to act as a powerful general base and to activate the serine nucleophile. It also has an oxyanion hole consisting of several backbone amides which stabilises charge build-up on intermediates. The histidine base aids the first leaving group by donating a proton, and also activates the hydrolytic water substrate by abstracting a proton as the remaining OH− attacks the acyl-enzyme intermediate.|$|E

40|$|One {{promising}} {{solution to}} improve the efficiency of wireless networks is to control the number of nodes involved in multi-hop routing by employing virtual <b>backbone.</b> On the one hand, a virtual <b>backbone</b> becomes more efficient as its size is getting smaller. However, as {{the size of a}} virtual <b>backbone</b> is getting smaller, the throughput of the virtual <b>backbone</b> is degraded since the length of a routing path between a pair of nodes through the virtual <b>backbone</b> can be much longer than their hop distance in the original network. Due to the reason, several efforts are recently made to identify a virtual <b>backbone</b> including a shortest path between every pair of nodes in the original graph. In this paper, we investigate a new strategy to compute higher throughput virtual <b>backbone</b> in wireless networks. We employ a new information the-oretic metric called spectral-efficiency by Chen et al. and propose a new virtual <b>backbone</b> computation algorithm in homogeneous wireless networks with some interesting theoretical analysis.

40|$|Identification {{of protein}} {{structural}} neighbors to a query is fundamental in {{structure and function}} prediction. Here we present BS-align, a systematic method to retrieve back-bone string neighbors from primary sequences as tem-plates for protein modeling. The <b>backbone</b> conformation of a protein {{is represented by the}} <b>backbone</b> string, as defined in Ramachandran space. The <b>backbone</b> string of a query can be accurately predicted by two innovative technologies: a knowledge-driven sequence alignment and encoding of a <b>backbone</b> string element profile. Then, the predicted <b>backbone</b> string is employed to align against a <b>backbone</b> string database and retrieve a set of <b>backbone</b> string neighbors. The <b>backbone</b> string neigh-bors were shown to be close to native structures of query proteins. BS-align was successfully employed to predict models of 10 membrane proteins with lengths ranging between 229 and 595 residues, and whose high-resolution structural determinations were difficult to elucidate both by experiment and prediction. The obtained TM-scores and root mean square deviations of the models confirmed that the models based on the <b>backbone</b> string neighbors retrieved by the BS-align were very close to the native membrane structures although the query and the neigh-bor shared a very low sequence identity. The <b>backbone</b> string system represents a new road for the prediction of protein structure from sequence, and suggests that the similarity of the <b>backbone</b> string would be more infor-mative than describing a protein as belonging to...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Virtual <b>backbone</b> {{has been}} {{proposed}} as the routing infrastructure to alleviate the broadcasting storm problem in ad hoc networks. Since the nodes in the virtual <b>backbone</b> need to carry other node’s traffic, and node and link failure are inherent in wireless networks, it is desirable that the virtual <b>backbone</b> is fault tolerant. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm called Connecting Dominating Set Augmentation (CDSA) to construct a 2 -connected virtual <b>backbone</b> which can resist the failure of one wireless node. We prove that CDSA has guaranteed quality, because {{the size of the}} CDSA constructed 2 -connected <b>backbone</b> is within a constant factor of the optimal 2 -connected virtual <b>backbone</b> size. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate that CDSA can improve the fault tolerance of virtual <b>backbone</b> with only marginal extra overhead. I...|$|R
