5|$|Astronomers hypothesized, <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>its</b> {{interior}} chemistry, {{that the}} comet {{formed in the}} Uranus and Neptune Oort cloud region of the Solar System.

5|$|<b>Based</b> <b>on</b> <b>its</b> {{appearance}} in visible light, the Andromeda Galaxy {{is classified as}} an SA(s)b galaxy in the de Vaucouleurs–Sandage extended classification system of spiral galaxies.

5|$|<b>Based</b> <b>on</b> <b>its</b> high mass, Gliese 876 c {{is likely}} to be a gas giant with no solid surface.
