25|$|In February 2012, Schuyler Yancey {{was cast}} {{in the role of}} Dr. Cameron Davis. Yancey made his debut on the April 5, 2012 episode. Supermodel, turned actor, known for his {{appearance}} as Rihanna's love interest the California King Bed music video, Nathan Owens began taping the role in late September, in secret. On October 1, 2012, several sources, including Soap Opera Digest confirmed that Owens had joined the cast. Owens was spotted on set for the show's 12, 000th episode during a press conference. However, the producers refused to comment on the role Owens would be playing. The actor himself later confirmed through his own personal Facebook that he had been cast in the role of Cameron. Owens's Instagram message about the casting was believed to be an accident. Soaps In Depth later confirmed that Owens would make his first appearance on the December 21 as a replacement for Yancey. However, due to news coverage of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, Davis first air date was postponed to December 24, 2012. Owens found out about the role through his manager. In an interview, Owens revealed that he went out for the role of Rodney. He worked with casting director, Marnie Saitta and went through several tests. Owens admitted that he had a good feeling about the casting because he was given several opportunities to go over the material. Saitta called him back shortly after his test and told Owens to come <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> days. He went back and forth a few times before he met with the producers and tested with Kate Mansi who portrayed Abigail. Owens signed on to play Cameron and beat out 15 other actors for the role. Owens admitted to being hesitant about replacing someone, though Yancey was only in the role {{for a short period of}} time, people had already gotten used to him, and Owens said that he felt like he was under a magnifying glass when he started, and that the potential critics made him a bit nervous. On September 21, 2013, at Kate Mansi's birthday party, Owens announced his departure from the series and revealed that he would last air in November.|$|E

[...] After initially exercising the stable's race {{horses in the}} early months of her pregnancy, she moved over to ponying and other activities. [...] , she and Sharp currently hope to have two children fairly close together, and after that, Napravnik has not ruled out a return to race riding but has not made any firm decisions. As she explained in February 2015, [...] "I'm satisfied with the accomplishments that I've made. If I feel like I really want to come <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> years then I can do it. The greatest thing is I don't have to." ...|$|E
500|$|On 5 September 1939 the Cipher Bureau began {{preparations}} {{to evacuate}} key personnel and equipment from Warsaw. [...] Soon a special evacuation train, the Echelon F, transported them eastward, then south. [...] By {{the time the}} Cipher Bureau was ordered {{to cross the border}} into allied Romania on 17 September, they had destroyed all sensitive documents and equipment and were down to a single very crowded truck. [...] The vehicle was confiscated at the border by a Romanian officer, who separated the military from the civilian personnel. [...] Taking advantage of the confusion, the three mathematicians ignored the Romanian's instructions. [...] They anticipated that in an internment camp they might be identified by the Romanian security police, in which the German Abwehr and SD had informers. [...] The mathematicians went to the nearest railroad station, exchanged money, bought tickets, and boarded the first train headed south. [...] After a dozen or so hours, they reached Bucharest, {{at the other end of}} Romania. [...] There they went to the British embassy. [...] Told by the British to [...] "come <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> days", they next tried the French embassy, introducing themselves as [...] "friends of Bolek" [...] (Bertrand's Polish code name) and asking to speak with a French military officer. A French Army colonel telephoned Paris and then issued instructions for the three Poles to be assisted in evacuating to Paris.|$|E

2500|$|Another account {{represents}} Lamon as {{traveling with}} the full confidence of Lincoln: [...] "It called for courage and the trip was made over the objection of Secretary Seward. 'Mr. Secretary,' said Lincoln, 'I have known to be in many a close place and he's never been in one he didn't get out of. [...] By Jing. [...] I'll risk it. [...] Go, Lamon, and God bless you.'" [...] Yet another account characterizes Lamon as being under Seward's influence and angering Lincoln: [...] "It was under Seward's influence that he actually told Governor Pickens {{that he had come}} to arrange for the withdrawal of the garrison, and that after his return he wrote the governor that he would be <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> days to assist with the evacuation. [...] He also gave Major Anderson the impression that no relief would be attempted. [...] All this was outrageous, and when Lincoln heard of Lamon's letter to Pickens, he indignantly denied that the man possessed any authority to make such a statement." [...] Missions to Fort Sumter aside, the marshal's position was not an onerous one and afforded Lamon legitimate access to the President. [...] What Lamon took upon himself, however, was to represent himself as Lincoln's bodyguard, which he did out of friendship rather than the requirements of the position.|$|E
