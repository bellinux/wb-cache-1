25|$|After Peter {{controls}} himself, {{the group}} splits in two, with Peter, Claire, and Sprague {{going to a}} remote town in Nebraska, and Parkman and Bennet continuing with their mission to destroy the tracking system. Bennet knows {{where they need to}} go, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>needs</b> Parkman's powers to allow them access. Matt confronts a security guard and convinces him that they know each other and had spoken outside of work the previous night. Upon revealing an embarrassing secret of the guard's, the man lets them in without hesitation.|$|E
500|$|At {{the time}} of the casting, Garrett Wang had only been acting for {{about a year and a}} half, and after he was cast in the role he was {{described}} by Kolbe as a [...] "young, up-and-coming actor, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>needs</b> to learn, and that's going to take some time. He's one of the actors who has to really work hard on his craft in order to keep up with the others." [...] The naivety of the character was emphasized in the media reports, with TV Guide describing the character prior to the launch of the series as [...] "green-around-the-gills".|$|E
500|$|Carson {{returned}} to Liverpool {{at the end}} of the season and in June 2007, Liverpool manager Rafael Benítez confirmed that he would be part of the first-team squad for the 2007–08 season, saying [...] "He must fight with Pepe Reina now for a starting place." [...] Carson remained second choice to Reina, however, and faced further competition following the signing of Charles Itandje in August 2007; as a result, Carson was loaned out again, this time to Aston Villa at a cost to Villa of £2million. Benitez said of the deal, [...] "We do not want to sell him, we are very happy with Scott. <b>But</b> <b>he</b> <b>needs</b> to play to keep up his England place." [...] Aston Villa manager Martin O'Neill preferred Carson to Thomas Sørensen and Stuart Taylor, and Carson played in all but three of Villa's 38 league matches, missing the two matches against Liverpool as he was ineligible to play, and kept 11 clean sheets during the 2007–08 season. He received the first red card of his career when he fouled Carlos Tevez in Villa's 4–1 Premier League defeat to Manchester United.|$|E

50|$|His first {{deliberate}} {{murder was}} Sigma, a rookie Ultra-hero. It {{felt good to}} him, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>needed</b> more, though <b>he</b> intended the killing to look random, <b>he</b> <b>needed</b> a means to detect Ultras, not just {{the ones that were}} public and wore pretty costumes.|$|R
500|$|Seward {{had mixed}} {{feelings}} {{about the man who}} had blocked him from the presidency. One story is that when Seward was told that to deny Carl Schurz an office would disappoint him, Seward angrily stated, [...] "Disappointment! [...] You speak of me of disappointment! [...] To me, who was justly entitled to the Republican nomination for the presidency, and who had to stand aside and see it given to a little Illinois lawyer!" [...] Despite his initial reservations about Lincoln's abilities, he came to admire Lincoln as the president grew more confident in his job. [...] Seward wrote to his wife in June 1861, [...] "Executive skill and vigor are rare qualities. The President is the best of us, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>needs</b> constant and assiduous cooperation." [...] According to Goodwin, [...] "Seward would become his most faithful ally in the cabinet... Seward's mortification at not having received his party's nomination never fully abated, but he no longer felt compelled to belittle Lincoln to ease his pain." [...] Lincoln, a one-term congressman, was inexperienced in Washington ways, and relied on Seward's advice on protocol and social etiquette.|$|E
500|$|Krusty is a hard-living {{entertainment}} veteran, sometimes {{depicted as}} a jaded, burned-out has-been, who has been down and out several times and remains addicted to gambling, cigarettes, alcohol, pornography, Percodan, Pepto-Bismol, and Xanax. He instantly becomes depressed {{as soon as the}} cameras stop rolling; Marge states in [...] "The Sweetest Apu", that, [...] "off camera, he's a desperately unhappy man". Krusty appeared to have used cocaine, one time emerging from a restaurant bathroom with white powder under his nose, but he explained that he was simply researching a part for a film, in which he played himself. In his book Planet Simpson, author Chris Turner describes Krusty as [...] "the wizened veteran, the total pro" [...] who lives the celebrity life. He is miserable <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>needs</b> his celebrity status. In [...] "Bart the Fink", Bart inadvertently reported Krusty for tax fraud to the Internal Revenue Service and as a result Krusty lost most of his money. Bart soon discovered that Krusty had faked his death and was living as Rory B. Bellows on a boat. Krusty declared that he was finished with the life of a celebrity and was unconvinced when Bart reminded him of his fans and his entourage. Finally, Bart told Krusty that leaving show business would mean losing his celebrity status, which convinced Krusty to return. Krusty has been described as [...] "the consummate showman who can't bear the possibility of not being on the air and not entertaining people." ...|$|E
2500|$|It was {{reported}} by the magazine Joseijishin in June 2013 that Dizon's ex-husband Bun had stopped paying child support for their daughter, which was the main reason Dizon returned to Japan. [...] "Apparently his business partner went bankrupt. <b>But</b> <b>he</b> <b>needs</b> to continue his responsibility for his daughter," [...] Dizon {{is reported to have}} said. She now lives in Las Vegas with her mother and daughter.|$|E

25|$|Furtado stopped {{first in}} Amboina, {{which was also}} in revolt against Portugal and {{attacked}} the rebels. He was very successful at this, winning every battle and pacifying the island, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>needed</b> six months to do so.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have it in}} my pocket," [...] he answered. [...] "I have it in notes, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>need</b> never {{fear that}} they will be traced. The numbers of notes given for Secret Service {{purposes}} are expunged from every one's memory." ...|$|R
2500|$|In [...] "Golden Powers", Kröd learns he is [...] "The Golden One" [...] who {{is destined}} to {{overthrow}} the evil Makonian Empire. <b>But</b> <b>he</b> <b>needs</b> help from his girlfriend Aneka, who briefly leaves Kröd because he is upset about her tendency to use sex as a weapon. Meanwhile, the evil Chancellor Dongalor tries repeatedly to kill Kröd and continues working to uncover {{the secrets of the}} Eye of Gulga Grymna, the deadliest weapon of the ancient world.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{followed}} him {{who was here}} before me and gave him choice--to go, or {{to fight for the}} stronghold. <b>But</b> <b>he</b> <b>needs</b> must fight and that was his bane, for I slew him." ...|$|E
60|$|Chauvelin {{had been}} weak once, had allowed the prize to slip through his fingers; {{it must not}} occur again. He has a {{wonderful}} head for devising plans, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>needs</b> a powerful hand to aid him, so {{that he may not}} fail again.|$|E
6000|$|The Countess {{sprang from}} her chair and came {{and sat on the}} sofa beside her visitor. [...] "Ah, you must send me the paper! My husband won't like it, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>need</b> never see it. Besides, he doesn't know how to read." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>But</b> <b>he</b> <b>needed</b> to {{know what}} was right, what was the proper {{sequence}} of his acts. Staring at the darkness, he seemed to feel his course, though he could not see it. He bowed in obedience. The stars seemed to swing softly in token of submission.|$|R
50|$|A rather dazed Weidling rang Colonel Hans Refior, his civil Chief-of-Staff, in the Bendlerblock {{headquarters}} soon afterward. Weidling {{said that}} he could not tell him what had happened, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>needed</b> various members of his staff to join him immediately, including Colonel Theodor von Dufving, his military Chief-of-Staff.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then were he sullen and unruly, indeed!" [...] {{said the}} old burgomaster with displeasure; [...] "none have shown him more kindness, none could better aid him in court and empire. The lad has never had {{restraint}} enough. I blame thee not, child, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>needs</b> it sorely, by thine own showing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "M. Graillot {{will not}} listen to my leaving London," [...] she {{interrupted}} rapidly. [...] "He declares {{that it is too}} near the production of the play. My own part may be perfect, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>needs</b> me {{for the sake of the}} others. He puts it like a Frenchman, of course." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "One {{of the men}} {{has been}} injured with a splinter, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>needs</b> but bandaging and laying up for a few days. We have had a shot or two through our bulwarks, and the sails are riddled. The captain's son is below with him; he acts as second mate, and will {{tell you all about}} this affair into which we were forced." ...|$|E
25|$|The setback, and the {{resulting}} drop in Union morale, impelled Lincoln to adopt a new policy of relentless, committed warfare. After the Seven Days, Lincoln decided he would move to emancipate most Confederate slaves by executive order, as a military act, using his authority as commander-in-chief. <b>But</b> <b>he</b> <b>needed</b> a Union victory first.|$|R
6000|$|A {{reasonable}} visit paid, Mr. Weston {{began to}} move.--"He must be going. He had {{business at the}} Crown about his hay, and a great many errands for Mrs. Weston at Ford's, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>need</b> not hurry any body else." [...] His son, too well bred to hear the hint, rose immediately also, saying, ...|$|R
60|$|The man did as ordered, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>needed</b> no questions. The wagons {{were full}} of wounded men going to Bithri. He passed on with a word of greeting, turned his horse when he reached a wood a little in front, and allowed them to pass, and then rode back to the troop.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I was {{the sole}} author of this afternoon's little drama. I like George, but I cannot permit him to pose in any way as my collaborator. George has old-fashioned ideas. He does not keep abreast of the times. He can write plays, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>needs</b> {{a man with a}} big brain to boom them for him. So, far from being {{entitled}} to any credit for this afternoon's work, he was actually opposed to it.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Only a {{very little}} quarrel this time," [...] she said, smiling charmingly. [...] "He is a dear, good old fellow, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>needs</b> {{correction}} now and then." [...] Then, turning to me, [...] "We all do that, Mr. Armitage, don't we? What a capital thing if, instead of receiving a collective punishment {{at the end}} of our lives, we were to have one at once, as the dogs do, when we did anything wicked. It would make us more careful, wouldn't it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It was Clarence that I was {{thinking}} of," [...] admitted her visitor. [...] "I suppose that I am selfish; but I am his mother." [...] She laid down her cup {{and looked at}} the girl with pleading eyes. [...] "I must go on, though I don't think I could say what I wish to any one but you. Clarence has many good qualities, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>needs</b> guidance. An affectionate son; but it is my misfortune that I am not wise or firm enough to advise or restrain him. I have dropped behind the new generation; the standards are different from what they were when I was young." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>But</b> <b>he</b> <b>need</b> {{not have}} troubled; Unda {{was afraid of}} Death. She wanted Kundoo. The Assistant was {{watching}} the flood and seeing how far he could wade into it. There was a lull in the water, and the whirlpool had slackened. The mine was full, and {{the people at the}} pit-bank howled.|$|R
6000|$|His welcome {{was like}} himself, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>needed</b> a {{reminder}} of Clarence's request for an interview. Then we repaired to the study, for Clarence begged that his brothers might be present, and then the beginning was made. 'Do you remember my showing you a will that I found in the ruins at Chantry House?' ...|$|R
50|$|I {{therefore}} {{decided to}} inject {{him with a}} milligram of sulphate of strychnine and to make him drink a large glass brimming with brandy. He set off again as best <b>he</b> could <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>needed</b> another injection four miles from the end {{to give him a}} semblance of speed and to get him to the finish.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not often. Father is very poor. He was ill {{for a long}} time, too, and if it hadn't {{been for}} your kind master I think we should all have starved. He's better now, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>needs</b> pretty good living to keep him up to his work--for there's a deal of {{training}} to be done, and it wears him out if he don't get meat. But the pantomimes began and we were getting on better, when the fire came and burnt everything we had almost, so we can't afford much meat or beer, and I don't like beer, so I've got them persuaded to let me live on bread and butter and water. I would like tea better, because it's hot, but we can't afford that." ...|$|E
6000|$|Of a peer of much renown {{in points}} of procedure, private business, and the like, he says, “he looks at {{everything}} out of blinkers, and has no side lights.” Of one brilliant and able colleague in the first administration he writes, that “he has some blank in his mental constitution, owing to which he receives admonitions most kindly, and then straightway {{does the same thing}} over again.” Of another colleague, “though much nearer the rights of the case than many who were inclined to object, he is thin and poor in the cabinet.” Some one else is “a sensitive man, given beyond most men to speak out his innermost and perhaps unformed thoughts, and thereby to put himself at a disadvantage.” Another public servant is “not unmanageable, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>needs</b> to be managed.” In the same letter he speaks of the Hibernian presbyterian as “that peculiar cross between a Scotchman and an Irishman.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Is it a {{pity for}} him that he married me? It would be a pity if he could love some other woman, but I am sure he could never do that. If he could love anyone it would be me, we both want it so much. He does not need a wife, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>needs</b> someone {{to take care of}} him--all men need that; and I can do it much better than any other person. Had he not married me he never would have married; but he may fall ill, and then how useful I shall be to him! He will grow old, and perhaps it won't be quite so lonely to him when I am there. It would have been a pity for him to marry me if I had been a foolish woman who asked for more love than he can give; but I shall never do that, so I think it is not a pity.|$|E
50|$|Oda {{began the}} next season at 2011 Cup of China, winning the silver medal. He was 7th at 2011 Trophee Eric Bompard. He withdrew from his {{national}} championships due to his left knee injury. No surgery was required <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>needed</b> time to heal. He was subsequently not named to the team for the 2012 World Championships.|$|R
60|$|Tom was {{so frightened}} that {{he longed to}} creep into a hole; <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>need</b> not have been; for salmon are all true gentlemen, and, like true gentlemen, they look noble and proud enough, and yet, like true gentlemen, they never harm or quarrel with any one, but go about their own business, and leave rude fellows to themselves.|$|R
25|$|Little {{is known}} about his family or early life. He came to Paris {{at an early age}} and studied drawing with François Boucher. He met the rich {{financier}} and collector Pierre Crozat and studied his collection of 1,400 classical engraved gemstones. He decided to study the art of fine stone engraving. His first efforts were successful, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>needed</b> formal training.|$|R
