5|$|A path, which {{contains}} data, usually organized in hierarchical form, that {{appears as a}} sequence of segments separated by slashes. Such a sequence may resemble or map exactly to a file system path, but does not always imply a relation to one. The path must <b>begin</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> single slash (/) if an authority part was present, and may also if one was not, but must not <b>begin</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> double slash. The path is always defined, though the defined path may be empty (zero length), therefore no trailing slash.|$|E
5|$|Bach {{structured}} the cantata in two parts, four {{movements to}} be performed before the sermon, three after the sermon. Both parts <b>begin</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> sinfonia. Bach scored it for an alto soloist and a Baroque instrumental ensemble of two oboes (Ob), taille (Ot), obbligato solo organ (Org), two violins (Vl), viola (Va), and basso continuo (Bc).|$|E
5|$|For {{patients}} who benefit, half achieve a seizure reduction within five days (if the diet starts {{with an initial}} fast of one to two days), three-quarters achieve a reduction within two weeks, and 90% achieve a reduction within 23 days. If the diet does not <b>begin</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> fast, the time for half of the patients to achieve an improvement is longer (two weeks) but the long-term seizure reduction rates are unaffected. Parents are encouraged to persist with the diet {{for at least three}} months before any final consideration is made regarding efficacy.|$|E
50|$|The novella {{is divided}} into thirty short chapters, each <b>beginning</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> short summary of the chapter's contents, echoing the {{conventions}} of eighteenth-century novels. Eleven <b>begin</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> illustration.|$|R
50|$|Various {{programming}} languages including Prolog, Haskell, Ruby and Go treat identifiers <b>beginning</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> {{capital letter}} differently from identifiers <b>beginning</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> small letter, a practice {{related to the}} use of sigils.|$|R
50|$|The Meditation <b>begins</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> {{rational}} moral comparison {{and proceeds}} to a frenzy of increasingly unlikely comparisons. While the satire <b>begins</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> pitch-perfect imitation of the kindly Boyles tone, it ends in a frantic, misanthropistic and misognynistic note of despair and nihilism. Also, while it <b>begins</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> hopeful call to self-examination, it moves eventually into a condemnation of all efforts at improvement.|$|R
5|$|More {{detailed}} negotiations will <b>begin</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> {{final approval}} expected early in 2016. If the final agreement goes ahead, Cardiff Athletic Club would receive an upfront payment of approximately £8 million. As {{part of the}} agreement, the bowls section would have to vacate its current site at the Arms Park and {{move to a new}} facility. At present Cardiff Blues pay Cardiff Athletic Club rent of around £115,000 per annum, however this would nearly double to around £200,000.|$|E
5|$|On November 17, 2008, Aliferi {{returned}} {{yet again}} to the Old Bridge Township Council. The council this time gave the go-ahead for construction to <b>begin</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> condition. The council set that if Aliferi wants to construct it, he has to include commercial development before constructing residential homes to minimize community impact. Also before construction would begin, Aliferi {{would also have to}} return for a new General Development Permit (GDP). The proposal for the hotel that Aliferi brought up, was held off due to the location, which was on depressed elevation. There was no official decision for a new train station, which was proposed several times during Aliferi's plans.|$|E
5|$|Players <b>begin</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> {{constructed}} {{town center}} or a wagon that will build into such, an armed explorer, and a modest number of villagers. Players explore {{the map and}} begin gathering resources used to build additional units and buildings and to research upgrades or technologies. Actions such as training units, constructing buildings, killing enemy units etc., earn the player experience points. At certain experience point thresholds, players earn shipments that may be turned in for cards from the player's Home City, which can include units, upgrades, or resources. The game progresses similar to most real-time strategy games until one side resigns.|$|E
50|$|The object prefix has a consonantal and syllabic (in parentheses) form: the consonantal form appears before <b>a</b> verb <b>beginning</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> vowel, and the syllabic form appears before <b>a</b> verb <b>beginning</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> consonant.|$|R
50|$|Khwarshi verbs {{normally}} {{consist of}} a stem, an agreement prefix indicating noun class and number of the relevant nouns, and a suffix showing tense, aspect, mood, or the like. Only about one fourth of the Khwarshi verbs show agreement, all of them <b>beginning</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> vowel. There is {{a small number of}} verbs <b>beginning</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> vowel that do not show agreement. Verbs <b>beginning</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> consonant do not show agreement.|$|R
5000|$|My and thy become {{mine and}} thine before words <b>beginning</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> vowel or the letter h. More accurately, the older forms [...] "mine" [...] and [...] "thine" [...] had become [...] "my" [...] and [...] "thy" [...] before words <b>beginning</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> {{consonant}} other than [...] "h", while [...] "mine" [...] and [...] "thine" [...] were retained before words <b>beginning</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> vowel or [...] "h", as in mine eyes or thine hand.|$|R
5|$|The Town Center {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} buildings in the game. Here villagers are created, and age advancement is researched. Most scenarios have each player <b>begin</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> single Town Center; the ability to build multiple Town Centers is unlocked by the construction of the Government Center during the Bronze Age. The Town Center provides population support for four units. In order to build more units, houses must be constructed. Each house supports four units, and although any number of houses can be built (a concept which was not maintained in later games like Age of Mythology), they can only support a maximum of fifty units.|$|E
5|$|The large {{budget and}} notable talent {{for the project}} made it {{difficult}} for the production company to secure directors willing to take on the series, causing 2009 to <b>begin</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> brief stir of media attention. Shortly thereafter, Taewon announced that the search was over and Kim Kyu-tae and Yang Yun-ho would be helming the series. Simultaneously, KBS was announced as the South Korean broadcaster. Later in the month, on February 19, Kim So-yeon was cast as a North Korean agent.|$|E
5|$|The {{reproductive}} {{habits of}} the Sumatran rhinoceros have been studied in captivity. Sexual relationships <b>begin</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> courtship period characterized by increased vocalization, tail raising, urination, and increased physical contact, with {{both male and female}} using their snouts to bump the other in the head and genitals. The pattern of courtship is most {{similar to that of the}} black rhinoceros. Young Sumatran rhino males are often too aggressive with females, sometimes injuring and even killing them during the courtship. In the wild, the female could run away from an overly aggressive male, but in their smaller captive enclosures, they cannot; this inability to escape aggressive males may partly contribute to the low success rate of captive-breeding programs.|$|E
50|$|Possession in Washo {{is shown}} by prefixes added to the object. There are two sets of prefixes added: the first set if the object <b>begins</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> vowel and the second set if the object <b>begins</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> consonant.|$|R

5|$|Director Brad Bird {{wanted to}} open the episode with a close up of Krusty's face. The staff liked the idea and he then {{suggested}} that all three acts of the episode, defined by {{the placement of the}} commercial breaks, should <b>begin</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> close up shot. Act one begins with Krusty's face introducing the audience at his show, act two begins with Krusty's face being locked up behind bars, and act three begins with Sideshow Bob's face on a big poster. Krusty's character is based on a television clown from Portland, Oregon, called Rusty Nails, whom The Simpsons creator Matt Groening watched while growing up in Portland. The original teleplay, written by Jay Kogen and Wallace Wolodarsky, was 78 pages long and many scenes had to be cut. One scene that had to be cut down was the scene where Patty and Selma show the slideshow of their vacation; it originally contained images of them being detained for bringing heroin into America.|$|E
5|$|First {{reported}} in 2003, {{the idea of}} using a form of the Atkins diet to treat epilepsy came about after parents and patients discovered that the induction phase of the Atkins diet controlled seizures. The ketogenic diet team at Johns Hopkins Hospital modified the Atkins diet by removing the aim of achieving weight loss, extending the induction phase indefinitely, and specifically encouraging fat consumption. Compared with the ketogenic diet, the modified Atkins diet (MAD) places no limit on calories or protein, and the lower overall ketogenic ratio (approximately 1:1) {{does not need to be}} consistently maintained by all meals of the day. The MAD does not <b>begin</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> fast or with a stay in hospital and requires less dietitian support than the ketogenic diet. Carbohydrates are initially limited to 10g per day in children or 20g per day in adults, and are increased to 20–30g per day after a month or so, depending on the effect on seizure control or tolerance of the restrictions. Like the ketogenic diet, the MAD requires vitamin and mineral supplements and children are carefully and periodically monitored at outpatient clinics.|$|E
5|$|Musical accompaniment for {{the silent}} films were not {{provided}} by the studios, and the Thanhouser productions were no exception. The musical program for the screenings were decided and played by the individual accompanists. At times, musical accompaniments were shared in trade journals and the musical accompaniment for Adrift was provided by an unnamed writer from Oklahoma in The Moving Picture World. The suggestion was to <b>begin</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> waltz until the friend pats the artist on the shoulder, when All I Get is Sympathy is played. The suggestion for I Don't Know Where I'm Going completes the scene and Life's A Funny Proposition follows the artist packing up until the artist pulls out the gun. A soft hurry follows as the girl confronts her father, leading to a crescendo at the climax.|$|E
5000|$|Black Toney {{became a}} very {{successful}} breeding tallion, siring many of the horses for which the Idle Hour Stock Farm became famous. The names of Bradley’s horses all <b>began</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> “B,” a quirk of Bradley's (perhaps because his own name <b>began</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> B, {{or perhaps because of}} Black Toney.) ...|$|R
50|$|The {{process of}} {{communicating}} <b>with</b> <b>a</b> network <b>begins</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> access attempt, {{in which one}} or more users interact <b>with</b> <b>a</b> communications system to enable initiation of user information transfer.

5|$|Reborning {{involves}} numerous {{time consuming}} steps. The most basic {{form of the}} process involves taking a vinyl doll, adding multiple hand painted layers of paint, and adding other physical features to the doll. Artists can pick different brands to best suit the doll they wish to create. Reborn artists can also buy reborn doll kits that are sculpted by reborn sculpt artists. A kit includes the vinyl doll parts. Customers can then purchase a reborn doll by choosing a kit (name) by sculptor (name) and have it reborned by a reborn artist (name) e.g. Adam by Mary reborned by Ann. Consumers can purchase {{a wide range of}} supplies for creating their own reborn. Making a doll from a kit allows artists to omit some steps in the fabrication process and <b>begin</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> blank canvas. Many supplies are needed for both external and internal modifications of reborns to make the doll seem more realistic.|$|E
5|$|The Season Nine DVD {{contains}} {{a number of}} deleted scenes from this episode. Notable cut scenes include: more scenes from the Q panel; Pete discussing what he learned working at Dunder Mifflin; Angela's sister, Phyllis, and Andy giving toasts at the wedding; more scenes with Erin and her biological parents in which they reconnect; further shots of the office members reminiscing about shared memories; and the office taking one of the potted plants outside and planting it in actual soil. The episode originally was scripted to <b>begin</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> different cold open; it would have entailed a prank on Dwight by Jim, in which Dwight is {{led to believe that}} he is actually living in the Matrix, a computer-simulation from the eponymous 1999 film of the same name. The scene was either not filmed, or cut from the episode and not included with the other deleted scenes. A table read of it—along {{with the rest of the}} episode—was included as a bonus feature on the ninth season DVD.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} sequence demonstrates mapping a band configuration to a counting symmetry equivalence class. <b>Begin</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> valid band configuration (1). Build column triplets {{by ordering}} the column values within each column. This {{is not a}} valid Sudoku band, but does place the same constraints on the lower bands as the example (2). Construct an equivalence class ID from the B2, B3 column triplet values. Use column and box swaps to achieve the lowest lexicographical ID. The last figure shows the column and box ordering for the ID: 124 369 578 138 267 459. All Band1 permutations with this counting symmetry ID {{will have the same}} number of grid completions as the original example. An extension of this process can be used to build the largest possible band counting symmetry equivalence classes (3).|$|E

5|$|The player {{assumes the}} role of a young chocolatier in 1880, during the Victorian era. The game has two modes of play: story and free play. Story mode {{involves}} a number of quests, including delivering specific chocolates and restoring the fictional Baumeister chocolate empire to its former glory. The player is enlisted by Evangeline Baumeister to rebuild the Baumeister chocolate empire which has been ruined by Evangeline's younger sister who scattered chocolate recipes around the world. The player must locate the 64 lost recipes, visit 14 different cities around the globe, purchase 6 closed Baumeister factories, establish business relationships with outlets and suppliers, and manufacture chocolates to keep in business. Free play mode allows the player to travel, manufacture, and trade without undertaking quests. This mode starts the player {{with a small amount of}} cash and all chocolate recipes unlocked for use. In story mode, players <b>begin</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> single factory and a recipe for simple chocolate bars, the player must visit the market to purchase ingredients and begin the manufacturing process.|$|E
5|$|The same {{model was}} used for both the Kaled and the Thal domes. The gas attack in Part One was {{achieved}} through dry ice and green lighting. Some of the Thal guns were re-used props from the First Doctor (William Hartnell) serial Galaxy 4 (1965). The electric trolley used by the Kaleds in Part One worked in tests, but collapsed when Baker and Marter boarded it. The creature Harry and the Doctor glimpse {{at the end of}} Part Two was mainly a reused Ice Warrior costume, while the Thal rocket ship was a reused model from The Ambassadors of Death (1970). During the filming of Part Two, Miles and Chinnery had trouble fitting the gun on the Dalek. As a result, the scene had to be filmed in two takes, bridged with a reaction shot of the Doctor. Part Two is unusual in that {{it is one of the}} very few episodes not to <b>begin</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> reprise, and also the first to end in a freeze frame. A stunt double for Elisabeth Sladen was hired for Sarah's fall from the scaffolding, but Maloney discovered that she would be falling eight feet, while Sladen had fallen ten feet in rehearsals. Maloney ultimately decided to conclude the episode with a freeze frame ending. Maloney would use the freeze frame technique again, most notably with The Deadly Assassin. The third episode overran its 25-minute limit and rather than cut material out the cliffhanger was changed from Davros' speech to the Doctor being electrocuted. The music for the serial was recorded on 3 March 1975 and the dubbing finished the day before Part One aired.|$|E
