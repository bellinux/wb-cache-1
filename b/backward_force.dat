40|$|The {{transient}} quantum fluctuation theorems of Crooks and Jarzynski restrict {{and relate}} the statistics of work performed in forward and <b>backward</b> <b>forcing</b> protocols. So far these theorems {{have been obtained}} {{under the assumption that}} the work is determined by projective measurements at the end and the beginning of each run of the protocols. We found that one can replace these projective measurements only by special error-free generalized energy measurements with pairs of tailored, protocol-dependent post-measurement states that satisfy detailed balance-like relations. For other generalized measurements, the Crooks relation is typically not satisfied. For the validity of the Jarzynski equality, it is sufficient that the measurements are error-free and the post-measurement states form a complete orthonormal set of elements in the Hilbert space of the considered system. We illustrate our results by the example of a two-level system for different generalized measurements. Comment: 16 pages, 2 figures, Additional details provided in included appendice...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{this paper}} is to provide an {{overview}} of recent theoretical and experimental investigations carried out in the laboratory on different academic and industrial mechanical systems in order to illustrate non linear phenomena that occur mainly in systems with localized nonlinearities and/or with time-varying parameters. Many mechanical systems can be considered as linear structures with localized nonlinear components modeled with either rheological or restoring force approaches. It is shown that the modified Dahl model selected is a reasonably efficient restoring force method for modeling nonlinear mechanical component such as suspension mountings, belt-tensioner and passive actuator. It is simply described by a first order differential equation coupled to the reduced equations of motion of the linear structure. Time-varying parameters may be due to parametric excitation, which provide lateral-axial couplings and a motion governed by linear Mathieu equations. In the presence of a nonlinear term, the limiting curves of the instability chart, evaluated by using a perturbation method, depend on the forward or <b>backward</b> <b>forcing</b> frequency sweeps: jump and hysteresis phenomena are observed. Different types of nonlinearities are illustrated using an academic autoparametric system, a pulley-belt system and resonant micro-gyroscope...|$|R

However, the initial design suffered from excessive recoil and was modified in 1916. In 1917 the recoil was further improved by addition of a recoil indicator and cut-off gear. Full recoil (40-inch Mk I, 44-inch Mk II) was allowed at lower elevation, hence absorbing most of the horizontal (i.e. <b>backward)</b> <b>force.</b> A shorter recoil (23-inch Mk I, 20-inch Mk II) was allowed at high elevation where the ground itself could absorb much of the vertical (i.e. downward) recoil force.

In the inertial frame, {{this is the}} only force on the car and passenger. Center panel: an exploded view in the inertial frame. The passenger is subject to the accelerating force ma. The seat (assumed of negligible mass) is compressed between the reaction force -ma and the applied force from the car ma. The car is subject to the net acceleration force Ma that is the difference between the applied force (m + M)a from the axle and the reaction from the seat −ma. Bottom panel: an exploded view in the non-inertial frame. In the non-inertial frame where the car is not accelerating, the force from the axle is balanced by a fictitious <b>backward</b> <b>force</b> −(m + M)a, a portion −Ma applied to the car, and −ma to the passenger. The car is subject to the fictitious force −Ma and the force (m + M)a from the axle. The difference between these forces ma is applied to the seat, which exerts a reaction −ma upon the car, so zero net force is applied to the car. The seat (assumed massless) transmits the force ma to the passenger, who is subject also to the fictitious force −ma, resulting in zero net force on the passenger. The passenger exerts a reaction force −ma upon the seat, which is therefore compressed. In all frames the compression of the seat is the same, and the force delivered by the axle is the same.|$|E

40|$|We have reconstituted {{a simple}} in vitro system using only {{mammalian}} dynein and mammalian kinesin {{attached to a}} single cargo. These cargoes undergo saltatory motion typically seen in vivo, indicating that the motors engage in a tug-of-war. When the complex hits a barrier, the cargo often reverses direction. In some cases, it tries several up-and-back motions, during which time the dynein likely pulls the cargo onto a different protofilament, and is sometimes able to bypass the blockage. This explains why eliminating kinesin or dynein stops motion in both directions in vivo. We also find that mammalian dynein, but not kinesin, often takes backwards steps when under <b>backward</b> <b>force.</b> However, yeast dynein coupled with mammalian kinesin does not display these attributes, as expected...|$|E

Recent experiments have shown how {{the structure and}} kinetics of myosin V are specialized to produce a highly processive motor capable of taking multiple 36 -nm steps on an actin filament track.

We have used a modified laser-trap microscope to apply a ≈ 2 -pN forward or <b>backward</b> <b>force</b> on a single-headed myosin V molecule, hypothesized to simulate forces experienced by the rear or lead head, respectively.

40|$|We held infants (aged 4 – 12 months) over a {{treadmill}} {{to study how}} they co-ordinated the two limbs during stepping. We disturbed one limb during the stance or swing phase and recorded the responses (muscle activity and movement) from both lower limbs. Manual disturbances were applied during the stance phase by sliding the foot <b>backward,</b> <b>forcing</b> the limb into the swing phase. Disturbances were also applied in the swing phase by manually extending the hip, interfering with the forward motion of the limb. Additional disturbances were applied to see if both limbs could perform the stance and swing phase synchronously. When the limb was forced to initiate the swing phase on one side, the contralateral limb either prolonged its contact with the ground or quickly established ground contact. When the forward motion of the limb was interrupted in the swing phase, the swing phase was prolonged on the disturbed side and the stance phase prolonged on the contralateral side. In most cases, one leg maintained ground contact. Moreover, {{it was easy to}} elicit bilateral, simultaneous stance phase, whereas it was difficult to elicit simultaneous swing phase. In cases where swing phase in the two limbs was initiated close in time, rhythmic alternate stepping was immediately restored in the following step. We conclude that human infants can generate co-ordinated motor responses bilaterally in response to unilateral perturbations, well before the onset of independent walking...|$|R
40|$|Cytoplasmic dynein is a dimeric motor that {{transports}} intracellular cargoes {{towards the}} minus-end of microtubules (MTs). In contrast to other processive motors, microtubule {{release of the}} dynein heads is not precisely coordinated and the mechanism of dynein processivity remains unclear. By engineering the mechanical and catalytic properties of the motor we show that dynein processivity minimally requires a single active motor domain (head) and a second inert MT binding domain. The AAA+ ring and the linker of the other head are dispensable, suggesting that processivity arises from a high ratio of MT bound to unbound time, and not from interhead communication. Additionally, nucleotide-dependent microtubule release is gated by tension on the linker domain. We find that dynein releases rapidly from the MT when force is applied in the forward direction (towards the minus-end), but remains bound under <b>backward</b> <b>forces.</b> This finding suggests that the asymmetric release properties of the microtubule binding domain (MTBD) control dynein directionality. Consistent with this hypothesis, replacing the MTBD with a catalytically inactive kinesin motor domain, which favors release towards the plus end, results in reversal of motor directionality. Furthermore, a dynein dimer maintains its minus-end directed motility when the released monomer is allowed to orient freely during {{the search for a}} new binding site. The results rule out directionality models based on a swinging mechanism of the linker domain. We propose that the mechanism of dynein directionality is fundamentally distinct from kinesin and myosin motors and determined by asymmetric release and binding properties of its MT binding interface. We develop a quantitative model for dynein stepping that reproduces the velocity and stepping characteristics of dynein motors and their response to chemical and mechanical perturbation...|$|R
30|$|In our case, the {{indirect}} traumatic etiology is clear; the mechanism producing the lesion is debatable. Supraspinatus rupture at the musculotendinous junction {{could have been}} caused by a sudden passive stretching of the supraspinatus because of the position of the arm during the fall. When the arm is <b>forced</b> <b>backward</b> and adducted, the supraspinatus fibers are already maximally lengthened and passively stretched, so myofilament overlap is too low to permit muscle contraction. It is well known that reflex muscle contraction is a defense mechanism to prevent or reduce the amount of damage caused by a given injury. Therefore, muscles that are actively contracting, particularly if eccentric, can resist to a greater force before musculotendinous unit failure than can passively stretched muscles. Another explanation for the rupture may be an acute inlet impingement at the acromioclavicular joint during the fall with the arm outstretched and <b>forced</b> <b>backward.</b> The shape of the patient’s acromion, type 2 according to Bigliani, could support this mechanism, but absence of acromioclavicular osteoarthritis could make this mechanism unlikely.|$|R
