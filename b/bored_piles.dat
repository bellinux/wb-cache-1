On 16August 2011, Langan International officially announced their involvement and that {{the foundation}} and piling had to be uniquely designed to overcome subsurface issues such as soft bedrock and porous coral rock, which normally could not support a skyscraper without settling. The foundation will be {{similar to that of}} the Burj Khalifa, but larger; it is expected to average around [...] deep with a concrete pad of area around [...] The concrete will have to have low permeability to keep out corrosive salt water from the Red Sea. Its depth and size are also considered to be an indicator of what the tower's final height will be. The piles will be up to [...] deep and the pad over [...] across, yet even still the building, which will weigh over , is expected to settle. The idea is that it settles evenly enough so that the building doesn't tip or put undue stress on the superstructure. Computer modeling programs performed tests at the site to confirm that the foundation design would work. [...] A later design for the foundation, to be constructed by Bauer in 2013, calls for 270 <b>bored</b> <b>piles</b> up to [...] deep which have to be installed into the difficult ground conditions.
