5|$|Harding's {{appointment}} of Harry M. Daugherty as Attorney General received more criticism than any other. Daugherty's Ohio lobbying and <b>back</b> <b>room</b> maneuvers {{were not considered}} to qualify him for his office. When the scandals broke in 1923 and 1924, Daugherty's many enemies were delighted {{at the prospect of}} connecting him with the dishonesty, and assumed he had taken part in Teapot Dome, though Fall and Daugherty were not friends. In February 1924, the Senate voted to investigate the Justice Department, where Daugherty remained Attorney General.|$|E
50|$|In {{its very}} early days, the Tammany Society {{met in the}} <b>back</b> <b>rooms</b> of various taverns, most often in Barden's Tavern on Broadway near Bowling Green. These <b>back</b> <b>rooms</b> served as {{unofficial}} campaign headquarters on election days.|$|R
40|$|The word 2 ̆ 2 {{politics}} 2 ̆ 2 generally {{conjures up}} images of smokefilled, <b>back</b> <b>rooms</b> where unscrupulous men in shirt sleeves chew their cigars and make shady deals that serve partisan interests. But politics is neither inherently shady nor specific to <b>back</b> <b>rooms.</b> In fact, as long as society is differentiated along ethnic, sex and social class lines, politics pervades all of social life. You are involved in politics and so is your mother...|$|R

5|$|He {{established}} his practice in Lower Manhattan in general surgery and medicine, treating {{both black and}} white patients. He started a school in the evenings, teaching children. He established what has been called the first black-owned and operated pharmacy in the United States, located at 93 West Broadway (near present-day Foley Square). His friends and activists gathered in the <b>back</b> <b>room</b> of the pharmacy to discuss issues related to their work in abolitionism.|$|E
5|$|Joseph Merrick, the Elephant Man, {{moved to}} Whitechapel Road in 1884. Visitors paid {{to see him}} in the <b>back</b> <b>room</b> of a shop owned by showman Tom Norman. The shop was {{directly}} opposite the Royal London Hospital, and Merrick was frequently visited by doctors. Merrick later moved to the hospital permanently, where he spent the last years of his life.|$|E
5|$|That year, {{the couple}} decided {{to open up}} an occult store, named The Warlock Shop, at 300 Henry Street in Brooklyn Heights, New York City; {{alongside}} this venture, they also founded a company, Earth Religion Supplies, Inc, which would later go into publishing. Officially opening on June 21, 1972, the <b>back</b> <b>room</b> of the shop would {{also be used for}} weekly lectures and would be rented to various occult groups who wanted to assemble there.|$|E

50|$|The College's {{foundational}} {{structure was}} designed around two central courtyards: Girls' Quad and Boys' Quad. The names echo the separate living arrangements in the College after female residents were first admitted in the 1960s; a practice {{which has since}} been discontinued. The majority of the rooms were divided into alcoves of four, with two front <b>rooms</b> and two <b>back</b> <b>rooms.</b> Typically, the <b>back</b> <b>rooms</b> were larger and allocated to returning residents or 'seniors', whilst the front rooms were allocated to first-year residents or 'freshers'. These alcoves were thus affectionately dubbed 'alcove families', with two males and two females constituting each group.|$|R

While the vet tries to operate on the hurt dog Scully enters the building and begins to hear screaming in the <b>back</b> <b>room.</b> She discovers that the vet has been attacked. After Scully leaves, the hurt animal transforms into the dhole, revealing that the dog can mimic any shape.|$|E
5|$|On 8 November 1923 Hitler and the SA stormed {{a public}} meeting of 3,000 people {{organised}} by Kahr in the Bürgerbräukeller, a beer hall in Munich. Interrupting Kahr's speech, {{he announced that}} the national revolution had begun and declared {{the formation of a}} new government with Ludendorff. Retiring to a <b>back</b> <b>room,</b> Hitler, with handgun drawn, demanded and got the support of Kahr, Seisser, and Lossow. Hitler's forces initially succeeded in occupying the local Reichswehr and police headquarters, but Kahr and his cohorts quickly withdrew their support. Neither the army, nor the state police, joined forces with Hitler. The next day, Hitler and his followers marched from the beer hall to the Bavarian War Ministry to overthrow the Bavarian government, but police dispersed them. Sixteen NSDAP members and four police officers were killed in the failed coup.|$|E
5|$|On Halloween day, {{she goes}} to the party store, but it is closed. However, the store manager appears and allows her into the shop. She dismisses the masks she sees on display as not good enough for scaring anyone. But she sneaks into a <b>back</b> <b>room</b> and discovers a row of hideously {{deformed}} masks. She is startled to find that the masks feel warm and like human skin, not rubber or plastic. The store owner reluctantly sells her one of the masks and Carly Beth goes home in delight. Later that day, after she takes the mold of her head that her mother made, she puts on the mask and goes in search of Chuck and Steve, determined to get revenge on them. She starts acting more and more aggressively as the night goes on: she chokes Sabrina, throws apples at a house, and frightens children she doesn't know. When she manages to scare Chuck and Steve, she loses the head her mother made, but no longer cares.|$|E

5|$|The match {{took place}} in Reykjavík from July to September 1972 {{and was the first}} to receive an American {{broadcast}} in prime time. Fischer lost the first two games in strange fashion: the first when he played a risky pawn-grab in a drawn endgame, the second by forfeit when he refused to play the game in a dispute over playing conditions. Fischer would likely have forfeited the entire match, but Spassky, not wanting to win by default, yielded to Fischer's demands to move the next game to a <b>back</b> <b>room,</b> away from the cameras whose presence had upset Fischer. After that game, the match was moved back to the stage and proceeded without further serious incident. Fischer won seven of the next 19 games, losing only one and drawing eleven, to win the match 12½–8½ and become the 11th World Chess Champion.|$|E
5|$|Scholar Andrew Spicer {{argues that}} British film noir evidences a greater debt to French poetic realism {{than to the}} expressionistic American mode of noir. Examples of British noir from the classic period include Brighton Rock (1947), {{directed}} by John Boulting; They Made Me a Fugitive (1947), directed by Alberto Cavalcanti; The Small <b>Back</b> <b>Room</b> (1948), directed by Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger; The October Man (1950), directed by Roy Ward Baker; and Cast a Dark Shadow (1955), directed by Lewis Gilbert. Terence Fisher directed several low-budget thrillers in a noir mode for Hammer Film Productions, including The Last Page (a.k.a. Man Bait; 1952), Stolen Face (1952), and Murder by Proxy (a.k.a. Blackout; 1954). Before leaving for France, Jules Dassin had been obliged by political pressure to shoot his last English-language film of the classic noir period in Great Britain: Night and the City (1950). Though it was conceived in the United States and was not only directed by an American but also stars two American actors—Richard Widmark and Gene Tierney—it is technically a UK production, financed by 20th Century-Fox's British subsidiary. The most famous of classic British noirs is director Carol Reed's The Third Man (1949), from a screenplay by Graham Greene. Set in Vienna immediately after World War II, it also stars two American actors, Joseph Cotten and Orson Welles, who had appeared together in Citizen Kane.|$|E
5|$|While {{active as}} a runner, Nurmi {{was known to}} be secretive about his {{training}} methods. Always running alone, he upped his pace and quickly exhausted anyone who was bold enough to join him. Even his club mate Harri Larva had learned little from him. After ending his career, Nurmi became a coach for the Finnish Athletics Federation and trained runners for the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin. In 1935, Nurmi along with the entire board of directors quit the federation after a heated 40–38 vote to resume athletic relations with Sweden. However, Nurmi returned to coaching three months later and the Finnish distance runners went on to take three gold medals, three silvers and a bronze at the Games. In 1936, Nurmi also opened a men's clothing store (haberdashery) in Helsinki. It became a popular tourist attraction, and Emil Zátopek was among those who visited the store trying to meet Nurmi. The Finn spent his time in the <b>back</b> <b>room,</b> running another new business venture; construction. As a contractor, Nurmi built forty apartment buildings in Helsinki with about a hundred flats in each. Within five years, he was rated a millionaire. His fiercest rival Ritola ended up living in one of Nurmi's flats, at half price. Nurmi also made money on the stock market, eventually becoming one of Finland's richest people.|$|E
50|$|It was {{initially}} popularly {{assumed that the}} house was built around {{the same time as the}} property was acquired, but various architectural features, including brickwork, window size and the original gambrel roof suggested a style which was not used in Virginia until several decades later.

5|$|The Minoan Brotherhood {{was officially}} inaugurated on January 1, 1977. Naming this first group the Knossos Grove coven, it {{initially}} began at his and Geraci's shared flat, {{where they were}} joined by their friend Joseph Cupolo. Setting up a lineage recording system to take into account which new initiates were being brought into the Brotherhood, the first man to be welcomed in was Kim Schuller, who was soon followed by Bruce-Michael Gelbert. Not long after, Cupolo moved to New Orleans, where he founded a second coven, known as Phaistos Grove. In 1977, Buczynski began attending the Sheridan Square Gym, and it was here that he met Gene Muto the following year. A stage director and part-time bartender, Muto entered into a sexual relationship with Buczynski, which Geraci accepted as per the rules of their open relationship. However, when Buczynski announced that he {{had fallen in love with}} Muto, it marked the end of his relationship with Geraci, who decided to move back to New Orleans in February 1979. Muto proceeded to move in with Buczynski at his apartment on West 13th Street, but did not share his boyfriend's magico-religious beliefs, instead being a far left atheist. He felt that Buczynski was wasting his life on Witchcraft, and encouraged him to aim for an academic education; Buczynski proceeded to attain a graduate equivalency diploma (GED). The Knossos Grove had meanwhile begun to deteriorate, rarely meeting from late-1978 through early 1979. He did however bring in Tony Fiara in late 1979, who would go on to play a significant role in the Minoan tradition, which was then being eclipsed in size by the Radical Faerie movement. That year, Buczynski decided to stop using his flat as a covenstead, which he moved to the Earth Star Temple, the <b>back</b> <b>room</b> of The Magickal Childe, Herman Slater's new shop.|$|E
