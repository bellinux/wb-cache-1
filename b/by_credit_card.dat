5|$|On July 16, 2008, Miami-Dade Transit {{announced}} that it would be replacing all fare collection methods with the Easy Card system by late 2009. The system replaces the old cash and token-based system with one that automatically deducts fares at Metrorail fare gates from a reloadable card. The final station to start fare gate installation was Government Center on August 2, 2009. Since the system launch on October 1, 2009, all passengers using Metrorail must use either an Easy Card or Easy Ticket to enter stations. For almost the full first year of use, the Easy Card ticket vending machines allowed anyone to purchase thousands of dollars worth of Easy Cards <b>by</b> <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> without entering a PIN or billing zip code, which led to credit card thieves putting high dollar values on Easy Cards and selling them at a discounted rate for cash. Miami-Dade Transit initially mitigated this issue by limiting credit card transactions to three per day and a value limit of $112, and later by requiring zip code verification for all cards.|$|E

25|$|Merchants in the United States {{have been}} {{fighting}} what {{they consider to be}} unfairly high fees charged <b>by</b> <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> companies in a series of lawsuits that started in 2005. Merchants charged that the two main credit card processing companies, MasterCard and Visa, used their monopoly power to levy excessive fees in a class-action lawsuit involving the National Retail Federation and major retailers such as Wal-Mart. In December 2013, a federal judge approved a $5.7 billion settlement in the case that offered payouts to merchants who had paid credit card fees, the largest antitrust settlement in U.S. history. Some large retailers, such as Wal-Mart and Amazon, chose to not participate in this settlement, however, and have continued their legal fight against the credit card companies.|$|E
2500|$|Merchants {{are charged}} several fees for {{accepting}} credit cards. The merchant is usually charged a commission of around 1 to 4 {{percent of the}} value of each transaction paid for <b>by</b> <b>credit</b> <b>card.</b> The merchant may also pay a variable charge, called a merchant discount rate, for each transaction. In some instances of very low-value transactions, use of credit cards will significantly reduce the profit margin or cause the merchant to lose money on the transaction. Merchants with very low average transaction prices or very high average transaction prices are more averse to accepting credit cards. In some cases merchants may charge users a [...] "credit card supplement" [...] (or surcharge), either a fixed amount or a percentage, for payment <b>by</b> <b>credit</b> <b>card.</b> This practice was prohibited by most credit card contracts in the United States until 2013, when a major settlement between merchants and credit card companies allowed merchants to levy surcharges. Most retailers have not started using credit card surcharges, however, for fear of losing customers. Surcharging is actually illegal in 10 states.|$|E

2500|$|In 2003, the Reserve Bank of Australia {{required}} that interchange fees be dramatically reduced, from about 0.95% {{of the transaction}} to approximately 0.5%.

Australia also prohibited the [...] "no surcharge" [...] rule, a policy established <b>by</b> <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> networks like Visa and MasterCard to prevent merchants from charging a credit card usage fee to the cardholder. A surcharge would mitigate or even exceed the merchant discount paid by a merchant, but would also make the cardholder more reluctant to use the card as the method of payment.
