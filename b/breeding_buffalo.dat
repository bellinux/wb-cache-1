The {{purpose of this study}} is to know new interpretation on prohibition to slaughter cow for Kudus society based on Paul Ricoeur‟s social hermeneutic perspective.

This study is the part of field research which the data is collected by observing, interviewing, and documenting. The type of this study is qualitative research using descriptive analysis method whereas the approaches are hermeneutical and philosophical approaches. The result of this study is that based on Paul Ricoeur‟s social hermeneutic perspective, prohibiton to slaughter cow for Kudus society should be placed as the local wisdom on Kudus society.

The incidence of repeat breeding is low in buffaloes however in different studies the incidence varied from 0. 70 % to 30 %. Because of seasonal suppression of fertility repeat <b>breeding</b> in <b>buffaloes</b> {{should be limited to}} the breeding season. Spring and winter calving, first parity, peri-parturient disease and lactation are significant risk factors for repeat <b>breeding</b> in <b>buffaloes.</b> The etiologies of repeat <b>breeding</b> in <b>buffaloes</b> can be failure of fertilization and early embryonic deaths. Only a few of causes of failure of fertilization have been identified in buffaloes. Ovulatory disturbances and ovarian cysts are uncommon in buffaloes and cysts have poor clinical manifestation. Endometritis is the common female cause of fertilization failures in buffaloes whereas poor semen quality and improper insemination are the bull side factors for fertilization failures. Early embryonic deaths are common in buffaloes mated/inseminated during the end of the breeding season due to a low luteal progesterone however embryonic deaths occur late (< 25 days) in buffaloes. Diagnostic approaches for repeat breeding include vaginoscopic and transrectal examination and uterine cytology for genital health. More precise evaluations of the ovarian and uterine function can be obtained by ultrasonographic and hysteroscopic examinations performed sequentially however, precise diagnosis of the cause of repeat breeding seems difficult...|$|R

Reproductive disorders like infertility and abortions in water buffalo are important problems in the livestock industry. In this study, the presences of Bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV), Bovine herpes virus- 1 (BHV- 1), Neospora caninum and Brucella abortus were investigated serologically in 82 domestic water buffaloes in Samsun province of northern Turkey. Seropositivity rates for BVDV, BHV- 1, N. caninum and B. abortus were found to be 68. 3 % (56 / 82), 80. 5 % (66 / 82), 28 % (23 / 82) and 2. 4 % (2 / 82), respectively.
