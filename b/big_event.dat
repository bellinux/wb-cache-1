5|$|Texas A {{provides}} {{many opportunities}} for students to participate in volunteer and service activities. Students at Texas A originated The <b>Big</b> <b>Event,</b> the largest one-day student-run service project in the nation. The annual event began in 1983 after the Texas A Student Government Association passed a resolution encouraging students to show their gratitude to the community by giving of their time. From its beginnings of sixindividual students wanting to contribute back to the local community, The <b>Big</b> <b>Event</b> has expanded to allow over twenty-two thousand students to participate in over 2500jobs, such as raking leaves, painting houses, and trimming trees. The concept for The <b>Big</b> <b>Event</b> has spread throughout the nation, and as of 2015, 110 schools across the nation participate each year including 1middle school, 2high schools, and 68universities. The 2008 <b>Big</b> <b>Event</b> attracted 10,600 students who worked a record number of 1,000 jobs.|$|E
5|$|Since Woman of the Year, Hepburn had {{committed}} to a romantic relationship with Tracy and dedicated herself to helping the star, who suffered from alcoholism and insomnia. Her career slowed as a result, and she worked less {{for the remainder of}} the decade than she had done in the 1930s—notably by not appearing on-stage again until 1950. Her only appearance in 1943 was a cameo in the morale-building wartime film Stage Door Canteen, playing herself. She took an atypical role in 1944, playing a Chinese peasant in the high-budget drama Dragon Seed. Hepburn was enthusiastic about the film, but it met with a tepid response and she was described as miscast. She then reunited with Tracy for the film version of Without Love (1945), after which she turned down a role in The Razor's Edge to support Tracy through his return to Broadway. Without Love received poor reviews, but a new Tracy–Hepburn picture was a <b>big</b> <b>event</b> and it was popular on release, selling a record number of tickets over Easter-weekend 1945.|$|E

40|$|The authors {{analyzed}} the {{spatial and temporal}} distribution of the microseismic events with larger magnitude (<b>big</b> <b>events)</b> observed during hydraulic stimulations at the Australian HFR site in the Cooper Basin and European HDR site in Soultz, France. A comparison between the origin time of the <b>big</b> <b>events</b> and the hydraulic record showed {{that many of the}} <b>big</b> <b>events</b> occurred after the shut-in at both the sites. We have also found that some of the <b>big</b> <b>events</b> at the Australian site brought very clear extension of the seismic cloud into previously seismically silent zones suggesting that some kind of hydraulic barrier was broken by the <b>big</b> <b>events.</b> Although further investigation is needed, the authors currently consider that the microseismic events at Australian site mainly originate from a slip of asperities in existing fractures although some of the characteristics of the <b>big</b> <b>events</b> are different from natural earthquakes at the plate boundary...|$|R

25|$|The {{game against}} the Notre Dame All-Stars had been {{originally}} devised by Frankford. It was planned as non-league exhibition game between former Notre Dame stars and the top NFL team in the east; after defeating the Maroons 20–0, Frankford had believed they would indeed be the NFL's top eastern team. However, when they were later defeated by the Maroons in a second contest, they lost the right to play the game. Instead, Pottsville would host the All-Stars at Minersville Park, while Frankford scheduled another league {{game against the}} Cleveland Bulldogs. Pottsville was excited to host Notre Dame, hoping {{it would be a}} huge financial windfall for the team. However, they felt that Minersville Park, a high school field with a low capacity, was too small for such a <b>big</b> <b>event.</b> Instead, they scheduled the game in Philadelphia, in the Yellow Jackets' territory. Frankford protested to commissioner Carr, who warned the Maroons in writing that they faced suspension if they played in Philadelphia. However, the Maroons claimed that the league office verbally approved the game during a telephone call.|$|E
25|$|In 1983, Ivan Lendl, John McEnroe and Mats Wilander {{entered the}} tournament. Wilander won the singles title and both his Davis Cup singles rubbers in the Swedish loss to Australia at Kooyong shortly after. Following the 1983 Australian Open, the International Tennis Federation {{prompted}} the Lawn Tennis Association of Australia {{to change the}} site of the tournament, because the Kooyong stadium was then inappropriate to serve such a <b>big</b> <b>event.</b> In 1988 the tournament was first held at Flinders Park (later renamed Melbourne Park). The change of the venue also led to a change of the court surface from grass to a hard court surface known as Rebound Ace. Mats Wilander was the only player to win the tournament on both grass and hard courts. In 2008, after being used for 20 years, the Rebound Ace was replaced by a cushioned, medium-paced, acrylic surface known as Plexicushion Prestige. Roger Federer and Serena Williams are the only players to win the Australian Open on both Rebound Ace and Plexicushion Prestige. The main benefits of the new surface are better consistency and less retention of heat because of a thinner top layer. This change was accompanied by changes in the surfaces of all lead-up tournaments to the Australian Open. The change was controversial because of the new surface's similarity to DecoTurf, the surface used by the US Open.|$|E

40|$|The {{context in}} which a moving object moves {{contributes}} to the movement pattern observed. Likewise, the movement pattern reflects {{the properties of the}} movement context. In particular, <b>big</b> <b>events</b> influence human mobility depending on the dynamics of the events. However, this influence has not been explored to understand <b>big</b> <b>events.</b> In this paper, we propose a methodology for learning about <b>big</b> <b>events</b> from human mobility pattern. The methodology involves extracting and analysing the stopping, approaching, and moving-away interactions between public transportation vehicles and the geographic context. The analysis is carried out at two different temporal granularity levels to discover global and local patterns. The results of evaluating this methodology on bus trajectories demonstrate that it can discover occurrences of <b>big</b> <b>events</b> from mobility patterns, roughly estimate the event start and end time, and reveal the temporal patterns of arrival and departure of event attendees. This knowledge can be usefully applied in transportation and event planning and management...|$|R

25|$|In August 1989, Ethel meets a {{new love}} {{interest}} named Reggie Thompson (John Rutland). He invites {{her to go}} on a coach trip to Clacton for a dancing competition. Ethel is so excited that she shows Reggie a saucy nightie she has bought for the trip. When Dot, Marge Green (Pat Coombs) and Mo Butcher (Edna Doré) find out about the trip, they decide to go as well. Reggie arranges dancing partners for them and the ladies practise hard at the community centre for months before the trip. But upon arriving on holiday, Ethel grows disappointed in Reggie when he starts to show interest in another woman named Gladys. On the night of the dancing competition, Ethel finds that Reggie has run off with Gladys and she has no partner in the grand ballroom except for her 'little Willy'. In 1992, Ethel's adored pug Willy succumbs to old-age and she has to make the heart-breaking decision to put him down. Regulars at The Queen Victoria pub raise money to buy Ethel a new dog, but she refuses to accept it, saying Willy is irreplaceable. By the mid 1990s Ethel is seen much less frequently. She is seen occasionally however, usually when a <b>big</b> <b>event</b> is occurring or to celebrate Christmas and New Year with her old friends on the Square. After 1997 Ethel is not seen in Walford for three years, although she is mentioned often, particularly by Dot, who will often visit her off-screen in her sheltered housing.|$|E
25|$|In the {{following}} weeks, Earnhardt {{would bring a}} string of Top 10's: 10th at Texas, 7th at Kansas, 2nd at Richmond, and 9th at Talladega, where he led 10 laps. The following week, Earnhardt struggled {{for most of the}} race at Darlington, and had to settle with a 17th-place finish. At the All-Star Race, Earnhardt won the Sprint Showdown, leading all 40 laps to race his way into the <b>big</b> <b>event.</b> In the event, Earnhardt won the 4th segment and in the final 10 lap shootout, had to settle for a 5th-place finish. The following two weeks, Earnhardt would post of finishes of 6th at Charlotte and 4th at Dover heading into the summer months. At the newly repaved Pocono Raceway, Earnhardt led 36 laps during the race, but made a late race fuel pit stop from 3rd place with just over 20 laps to go, finishing 8th and standing 2nd in points. At the 2012 Quicken Loans 400 at Michigan, Earnhardt dominated the race, leading 95 laps, and won, snapping a 143-race winless streak, almost four years to the day after his last win on June 15, 2008. Earnhardt would suffer a 23rd-place finish at Sonoma after being wrecked in a green-white-checkered finish, but was still able to cross the finish line intact and on the lead lap, continuing his streak of being the only driver to finish all races on the lead lap. He would back this up with a fourth-place finish in the Quaker State 400 at Kentucky Speedway.|$|E
