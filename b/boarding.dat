5|$|At 10:00 on {{the morning}} of 31May, Laforey sent the boats from his {{squadron}} inshore to attack the grounded Confiante. Coming alongside the wreck at 12:45, the British <b>boarding</b> party, under Lieutenants George Acklom and William J. Simonds, found no one alive on the ship, but counted a large number of French dead still on board. Removing the French colours and paperwork, the <b>boarding</b> party started fires in the bow and stern of the corvette before withdrawing, despite a steady but ineffective musket fire from French troops overlooking the beach and a force of cavalry moving along the shore. The fire rapidly destroyed Confiante and the British <b>boarding</b> party retired without casualties.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{argues that}} <b>board</b> size {{decisions}} {{should be based}} on a sound understanding of how <b>board</b> size influence <b>board</b> processes which in turn affect <b>board</b> performance. The paper applied mediation analysis to show how the size of <b>boards</b> in Pacific Islands Countries indirectly affects <b>board</b> performance through <b>board</b> processes. The study found that increasing <b>board</b> size for relatively medium or large-sized <b>boards</b> indirectly reduced <b>board</b> performance through its effect on the processes of effort norms, cognitive conflict, and use of knowledge and skills. Overall, the findings confirm the role of <b>board</b> process as an important mediator in the relationship between <b>board</b> size and <b>board</b> performance, which therefore should be taken into account in <b>board</b> appointment decisions to improve <b>board</b> performance in PICs enterprises...|$|R
5|$|Pastoral care is {{provided}} {{through the house}} system. Each pupil is assigned to a house. Each house has its own accommodation {{in the school and}} its own set of tutors to look after members of the house. There are eight vertically integrated houses in total, each with its own colour and heraldic-like shield: The two boys' <b>boarding</b> houses are York (red) and Northumberland (pale blue). The three day boys' houses are Tees (dark green) and Dale (burgundy), both formed by splitting Teesdale House, the first day boys' house, and finally Durham (gold), which was converted from <b>boarding</b> to day when the school expanded in the 1990s. The <b>boarding</b> girls belong to the original Sixth Form girls' house, Longfield (dark pink), and the new houses formed for day girls when the school became co-educational are Marwood (purple) and more recently Bowes (pale green). The school considered abolishing its <b>boarding</b> facilities when, like many <b>boarding</b> schools, it suffered a significant drop in numbers during the 1990s. However, numbers unexpectedly improved {{around the turn of the}} millennium, and this turnaround has often been attributed to the positive image that <b>boarding</b> received from the Harry Potter series. The school is interdenominational, whilst maintaining its foundation in Christian principles and values.|$|E

During the excavations, large-caliber firearms were found – hakebössor, similar to blunderbusses; they were equipped with a small catch underneath the barrel which allowed them to be hooked over a railing {{to allow it to}} absorb the recoil of the charges.
