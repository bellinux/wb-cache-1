5|$|The <b>Ben</b> <b>Franklin</b> Bridge {{was opened}} on July 1, 1926 and was {{designated}} to carry US 30 across the Delaware River. A parkway called the Camden-Atlantic City Parkway was planned in 1932 {{to connect the}} <b>Ben</b> <b>Franklin</b> Bridge southeast to Atlantic City; this was never built. After World War II, freeway connections were planned {{on both sides of}} the <b>Ben</b> <b>Franklin</b> Bridge. In Philadelphia, the Vine Street Expressway was planned to run along the Vine Street corridor to the present-day Schuylkill Expressway in 1945. The North-South Freeway was proposed in New Jersey as a connection from the bridge south along the Route 42 corridor. In 1950, the city of Philadelphia began planning the construction of the Vine Street Expressway, which would run along a depressed alignment through the city.|$|E
5|$|The NorthSouth Freeway {{portion of}} Route 42 was {{originally}} planned as a parkway in 1932 that would {{run from the}} <b>Ben</b> <b>Franklin</b> Bridge in Camden to Atlantic City; however, this proposal never materialized. In the late 1940s, the NorthSouth Freeway was proposed by the New Jersey State Highway Department to run from the <b>Ben</b> <b>Franklin</b> Bridge to Turnersville. In the early 1950s, right-of-way for the freeway was acquired and actual construction of the freeway followed. The Route 42 freeway opened between Interstate 295 in Bellmawr and the Black Horse Pike in Blackwood in 1958. It opened between the Black Horse Pike in Blackwood and Turnersville in 1959. With {{the completion of the}} NorthSouth Freeway portion of Route 42, the Black Horse Pike north of Turnersville became Route 168.|$|E
5|$|In the 1953 New Jersey {{state highway}} renumbering, which {{eliminated}} several concurrencies between U.S. and state routes, the designations of routes 25, 43, and 56 {{were removed from}} US30. Prior to the completion of I-676 across the <b>Ben</b> <b>Franklin</b> Bridge in the 1970s, US30 used Penn Street eastbound and Linden Street westbound to travel between the bridge and Admiral Wilson Boulevard. In the late 1960s, a freeway was proposed for US30 in Camden County by the Delaware Valley Regional Planning Commission. The freeway, which was to cost $40million, was to run from the <b>Ben</b> <b>Franklin</b> Bridge to I-295 in Barrington with a $16million extension to the planned Route90 freeway in Berlin. The segment between Camden and Barrington was to be complete by 1975 while the extension to Berlin was to be finished by 1985. However, the NJDOT did not build this US30 freeway. In 2009, the Collingswood Circle at {{the eastern end of}} the US130 concurrency was replaced with an at-grade intersection with jughandles.|$|E

5|$|After World War II, freeway {{approaches}} {{were planned}} {{for both sides}} of the <b>Ben</b> <b>Franklin</b> Bridge, which was completed in 1926 and served as a part of US 30. In Pennsylvania, the Vine Street Expressway was planned to run along the northern edge of Center City Philadelphia to the Schuylkill River, while in New Jersey, the North-South Freeway was to head south along the Route 42 corridor. When the Interstate Highway System was created in the 1950s, this stretch of highway was a part of I-80S, with Interstate 680 continuing on the Schuylkill Expressway to the Walt Whitman Bridge. In 1964, the designations became I-76 and I-676, respectively, and in 1972 the two routes were switched onto their current alignments. I-676 in New Jersey was completed between I-76 and Morgan Boulevard by 1960 and north of there to downtown Camden by the 1980s. The Vine Street Expressway was opened from the Schuylkill Expressway to 18th Street by 1960 and east of there to I-95 on January 10, 1991 after several obstacles to construction. However, there are grade-level intersections in the connections between the Vine Street Expressway and the <b>Ben</b> <b>Franklin</b> Bridge.|$|E

With {{the help of his}} brother and father-in-law, Sam went on to open many new variety stores. He encouraged his managers to invest and take an equity stake in the business, often as much as $1000 in their store, or the next outlet to open. (This motivated the managers to sharpen their managerial skills and take ownership over their role in the enterprise.) By 1962, along with his brother Bud, he owned 16 stores in Arkansas, Missouri, and Kansas (fifteen <b>Ben</b> <b>Franklins</b> and one independent, in Fayetteville).|$|R

5|$|What is now {{the lower}} level of Route139 was {{originally}} designated as the northernmost part of , which was authorized by the New Jersey Legislature in 1922, a route that was to extend the existing Route1 from Elizabeth to the Holland Tunnel in Jersey City. When the U.S. Highway System was established in 1926, this road was also designated as part of U.S.Route1. In the 1927 New Jersey state highway renumbering, this highway became part of Route25, a route that was to run from the <b>Ben</b> <b>Franklin</b> Bridge in Camden to the Holland Tunnel.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, a freeway was {{proposed}} by the Delaware Valley Regional Planning Commission to alleviate traffic on US 130 between Camden and Burlington. This freeway was originally planned as a parkway between the two cities in 1932 that never materialized. The proposed freeway, which was to connect the <b>Ben</b> <b>Franklin</b> Bridge to I-295 near the Assicunk Creek, was to cost $53 million and mostly follow a Conrail railroad line between the two cities. However, the NJDOT never followed through with the proposal. In 2009, the Collingswood Circle at the southern terminus of the US 30 concurrency was replaced with an at-grade intersection with jughandles.|$|E
5|$|After the Civil War, {{the region}} around {{the site of}} Cooper began to grow and develop. People in nearby <b>Ben</b> <b>Franklin,</b> Texas, grew tired of the poor road {{conditions}} that connected the region. In 1868, {{people in the area}} petitioned the state government to create a new county located between the north and south forks of the Sulphur River. On July 29, 1870, after two years of debating, the state of Texas granted the request for the new county. Shortly afterwards, the first settlements were built in Cooper and the town was established. The community was named after Leroy Cooper, the chairman of the Texas House Committee on Counties and Boundaries who helped establish the new county. Cooper was selected as the seat for the county, which would be named Delta County due to its triangular shape.|$|E

5|$|Interstate 676 (abbreviated I-676) is an Interstate Highway {{that serves}} as a major {{thoroughfare}} through Center City Philadelphia, where it is known as the Vine Street Expressway, and Camden, New Jersey, where it is known as the northern segment of the North–South Freeway, as well as the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Highway. Its western terminus is at I-76 in Philadelphia near the Philadelphia Museum of Art and Fairmount Park. From there it heads east and is then routed on surface streets near Franklin Square and Independence Mall, home of the Liberty Bell, before crossing the <b>Ben</b> <b>Franklin</b> Bridge. On the New Jersey side of the bridge, the highway heads south to its southern terminus at I-76 in Gloucester City near the Walt Whitman Bridge. Between the western terminus and downtown Camden, I-676 is concurrent with U.S. Route 30 (US 30).|$|E
5|$|Most of US30 in New Jersey {{follows the}} White Horse Pike, a turnpike {{chartered}} in 1854 {{to run from}} Camden to Stratford and eventually toward Atlantic City. In 1917, pre-1927 Route3 was legislated to run from Camden to Absecon on the White Horse Pike, while US30 was designated in New Jersey in 1926 to connect Camden and Atlantic City via the White Horse Pike. A year later, pre-1927 Route3 was replaced by Route43, which ran between US130 near Camden and US9 (now Route157) in Absecon, and Route25 was designated along the portion of US30 between the <b>Ben</b> <b>Franklin</b> Bridge and US130. The segment of US30 past Route43 into Atlantic City became Route56 in 1938. In 1953, the state highway designations were removed from US30. A freeway was proposed for US30 in Camden County during the late 1960s, running from Camden to Berlin; however, it was never built.|$|E
5|$|The White Horse Turnpike Company was {{incorporated}} January 27, 1854 {{with the authority}} to convert White Horse Road into a turnpike, running from Camden to Stratford and eventually to Atlantic City. By 1913, maintenance of the White Horse Pike became public. The route of US30 today in New Jersey was designated as pre-1927 Route3 from 1916 to 1927 between Camden and Absecon. On October 30, 1925, plans were made for a cross-country route from Salt Lake City, Utah to Atlantic City, New Jersey {{as part of the}} U.S. Highway System. This road was designated U.S. Route30 in 1926. It entered New Jersey from Pennsylvania in Camden and followed the entire length of pre-1927 Route3 to Absecon before continuing into Atlantic City. In the 1927 New Jersey state highway renumbering, Route43 replaced the Route3 designation along US30 between US130 and US9 (now Route157) in Absecon while Route25 was designated along with US30 between the <b>Ben</b> <b>Franklin</b> Bridge and US130. In 1938, the portion of US30 from the terminus of Route43 in Absecon into Atlantic City was designated as Route56. Prior to the 1953 New Jersey state highway renumbering, spur routes of Route43 and Route56 were planned. RouteS43 was planned in 1938 to be a route running from Route43 in Germania to Route4 in Northfield; this was never built as a state highway but the alignment is now followed by CR563. RouteS56 was legislated in 1945 to be a spur of Route56 to Brigantine along what had also been legislated as Route S4A; this road became Route87 in 1953.|$|E
