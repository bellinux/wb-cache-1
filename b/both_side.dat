After its reconstruction, the left side was reserved for women, and the right for men. <b>Both</b> <b>side</b> aisles are separated from the main aisle by pillar files, consisting of four columns and two half columns.

5|$|Sose {{made its}} closest {{approach}} to New Caledonia early on April 8, passing about 280 km (175 mi) to the northeast. A strong area of high pressure over New Zealand served to tighten to surface pressure gradient {{well to the}} south of Sose's center, contributing to an overall very large envelope of gale-force winds. In turn, the cyclone affected numerous islands on <b>both</b> <b>side</b> of its path, despite never having made landfall. As it progressed on its southeastward track, the cyclone began to show signs of weakening, at least partially due to increasing wind shear from an approaching upper trough. At the same time, a mid-level ridge to the east forced the storm to turn due south; the conflicting wind patterns undermined the cyclone's circulation, causing its center at the surface to separate from the deep convection. Both the FMS and the JTWC reflected steady weakening, and by early on April 10, the center had become exposed and ill-defined. Sose then entered the area of responsibility of the Tropical Cyclone Warning Center in Wellington, New Zealand, where it continued to deteriorate. The JTWC issued its last warning on 19P at 0600 UTC on April 11, while the system was located about 335km (210mi) northeast of Norfolk Island. TCWC Wellington soon downgraded Sose to a tropical depression as it underwent an extratropical transition. Drifting south-southwestward, the cyclone lost its tropical identity early on April 12. The remnant low ultimately moved over the Tasman Sea, where it was absorbed by a broad low pressure system about to travel over New Zealand's North Island. Abundant residual tropical moisture acted on the low pressure environment to create widespread precipitation across northern New Zealand.|$|E

In 1927, platform extensions were built at DeKalb Avenue in order to allow for longer trains. The extensions were built into a curve south of the station–they were closed in 1960 when they were replaced by straight extensions to the north.

Since their debut, the Suns home uniforms have been always white coloured with purple and orange trim. When playing abroad, their uniforms are normally purple with white and orange trim, with accents of black during the 1990s and gray on the current versions.

Its lowest stage is a three-story masonry tower with wooden cornices separating the stories, topped by three frame ones above a curved cornice. The lower two are octagonal, one featuring a clock and the next louvered round-arched vents. The uppermost stage, the conical steeple, has ribs defining its eight facts and is covered with diamond-shaped wooden shingles.

25|$|The {{blue runner}} is a fast-swimming {{predator}} which primarily takes small benthic fishes as prey in inshore waters. Studies on the species diet on <b>both</b> <b>side</b> of the Atlantic have shown similar results. A Puerto Rican study found the species supplements its fish dominated diet with crabs, shrimps, copepods {{and other small}} crustaceans. More detailed research in Cape Verde found as well as fish, blue runner take shrimp, prawns, lobsters, jellyfish and other small invertebrates. The diet of juveniles is more zooplankton dominated, with young fish predominantly taking cyclopoid and calanoid copepods, and gradually moving to a more fish based diet. Adult blue runner living offshore or aggregating around oil and gas platforms tend to have less fish in their diet, foraging extensively on larger zooplankton during the summer months, with larval decapods and stomatopods, hyperiid amphipods, pteropods, and larval and juvenile fishes also taken.|$|E
