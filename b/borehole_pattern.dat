40|$|A {{series of}} {{numerical}} simulations of rock blasting using LS-DYNA software havebeen conducted {{to investigate the}} effect of short delay time on the fragmentation inunderground mines. The purpose was {{to test the hypothesis}} proposed by Rossmaniththat stress wave interaction could result in finer fragmentation by controlling theinitiation times. The blasted rock was simulated with RHT material model. After thecalculation, the elements with damage level above 0. 6 were removed to simulate thefracture of the rock. The size of model and the <b>borehole</b> <b>pattern</b> were based on the blasting design of theLKAB Malmberget mine. Several simulations were run to investigate the effects ofinitiation time, primer position and boundary conditions. The results are presented asaccumulated area plots where the level of fragmentation can be observed at certainpositions in the model. The results show that the fragmentation for simultaneous initiation is coarsercompared to initiation with delay times in SLC blasting. It is difficult to identify anyeffect of stress wave interaction from the damage distribution in the blasted blockbecause the <b>borehole</b> <b>pattern</b> is in a fan shape. Thus, the distance between twoadjacent boreholes is not constant and the boreholes are of various lengths. Thenumerical modeling results showed that the fragmentation for the case of 2 ms delaytime is finer than that of simultaneous initiation and the 1 ms delay time case. Thecomparison among the cases with different primer positions shows that if the top ofthe block was set as free face, the bottom primer cases yielded the finer fragmentationthan the top primers cases and the middle primer cases; if the top of the block was setas non-reflecting boundary, the top primer cases yielded the finest fragmentation. Theeffect of overlying waste rock above the block cannot be neglected in simulations. The real boundary conditions of the top of the block and the effect of primer positionneed to be studied further. Some recommendations are proposed for the futureresearch about SLC blasting. Godkänd; 2013; 20130617 (chayir) </p...|$|E
40|$|High methane {{emissions}} {{originating from}} the active face areas {{and from the}} fractured formations overlying and underlying the mined coalbed can adversely affect both safety and productivity in underground coal mines. Since ventilation alone may {{not be sufficient to}} control the methane levels in the longwall mining environment, gob gas ventholes have become a standard supplementary methane control option in many mines. As mines progress into deeper and gassier coalbeds, or as longwall panel size increases, ventilation and gob gas ventholes together may not be sufficient to maintain methane levels within statutory limits. To decrease the risk associated with methane emissions under these circumstances, in-seam horizontal methane drainage is often used to reduce the gas content of the coalbed prior to mining. Horizontal methane drainage borehole completion designs, drilling strategies, and degasification lead times may need to be adjusted for site-specific conditions due to mine design, geology, and the gas content of the coalbed. This study investigates different horizontal methane drainage <b>borehole</b> <b>patterns,</b> <b>borehole</b> lengths, and degasification times prior to and during panel extraction to evaluate their effectiveness in reducing methane emissions using a "dynamic" 3 D reservoir modeling of a 38 1 -m wide longwall panel operating in the Pittsburgh coalbed. Results of this study showed that dual and tri-lateral boreholes are more effective in decreasing emissions and in shielding the entries compared to fewer shorter, cross-panel, horizontal boreholes parallel to the longwall face. Modeling results showed that after 12 months of pre-mining methane drainage, the average longwall face emission rates can be reduced by as much as 10. 3 m 3 /min and 6. 8 m 3 /min using tri- and dual-lateral boreholes, respectively. It was also shown that if pre-mining methane drainage time is short, it is important to continue methane drainage during the panel extraction to maximize reductions in longwall face emissions since additional face emission reductions achieved during this period can be comparable to pre-mining degasification...|$|R
40|$|The 1996 {{performance}} assessment (PA) for the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) {{maintains a}} separation between stochastic (i. e., aleatory) and subjective (i. e., epistemic) uncertainty, with stochastic uncertainty {{arising from the}} possible disruptions that could occur at the WIPP over the 10, 000 yr regulatory period specified by the US Environmental Protection Agency (40 CFR 191, 40 CFR 194) and subjective uncertainty arising from an inability to uniquely characterize many of the inputs required in the 1996 WIPP PA. The characterization of stochastic uncertainty is discussed including drilling intrusion time, drilling location penetration of excavated/nonexcavated areas of the repository, penetration of pressurized brine beneath the repository, <b>borehole</b> plugging <b>patterns,</b> activity level of waste, and occurrence of potash mining.

40|$|In-situ {{measurements}} of the specific conductance and temperature of ground water in the Snake River Plain aquifer were collected in observation well USGS- 59 near the Idaho Chemical Processing Plant at the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory. These parameters were monitored at various depths in the aquifer from October 1994 to August 1995. The specific conductance of ground water in well USGS- 59, as measured in the borehole, ranged from about 450 to 900 {micro}S/cm at standard temperature (25 C). The pumping cycle of the production wells at the Idaho Chemical Processing Plant causes changes in <b>borehole</b> circulation <b>patterns,</b> {{and as a result}} the specific conductance of ground water at some depths in the well varies by up to 50 % over a period of about 14 hours. However, these variations were not observed at all depths, or during each pumping cycle. The temperature of ground water in the well was typically between 12. 8 and 13. 8 C. The results {{of this study indicate that}} temporal variations in specific conductance of the ground water at this location are caused by an external stress on the aquifer [...] pumping of a production well approximately 4, 000 feet away. These variations are believed to result from vertical stratification of water quality in the aquifer and a subsequent change in intrawell flow related to pumping. When sampling techniques that do not induce a stress on the aquifer (i. e., thief sampling) are used, knowledge of external stresses on the system at the time of sampling may aid in the interpretation of geochemical data...|$|R
40|$|This report {{contains}} {{the results of}} work completed during the eleventh year of the Borehole Acoustics and Logging Consortium in the Earth Resources Laboratory at M. LT. We continued our trend toward more general borehole acoustics instead of just full waveform logging. In this report we have papers related to borehole radiation as well as reception patterns, {{as well as more}} theoretical work on the Green's function of an anisotropic medium. The <b>borehole</b> reception <b>pattern</b> paper is the continuation of the work from last year, where we dealt with the receiver pattern in an open borehole. This year the work is extended to include cased boreholes. On the subject of borehole radiation, this year we have two papers dealing with the radiated seismic wavefield away from a borehole. The interest is in the areas of downhole sources as applied to single hole imaging, measurement while drilling, reverse vertical seismic profiling, as well as cross borehole tomography. In all these areas how the source energy is coupled into the borehole under different situations is of tremendous interest. On the more traditional full waveform acoustic logging side, we have a paper dealing with logging in a randomly heterogeneous formation, and one on the effect of permeability heterogeneity on the measured Stoneley wave velocity and attenuation. We also have a paper on the ultrasonic modeling of shear wave logging in an azimuthally anisotropic formation. On the numerical side, we have one paper on a fourth-order staggered-grid finite difference formulation of full waveform logging in a transversely isotropic formation with vertically varying properties, and one on the formulation of an optimal absorbing boundary condition for finite difference elastic wave propagation algorithms. Finally, as a continuation of previous work, we are working to improve our algorithm to location microearthquakes generated by hydraulic fracturing and thus provide a better location of the fracture in a three-dimensional space.

40|$|Here {{we present}} an updated stress map {{with a focus}} on {{southern}} Apennines. The Apennines are a thrust and fold belt NE-verging characterized by a prevalent extensional tectonic regime. Along the northern front of the belt, from the Po Plain to the Adriatic offshore, compression is on the contrary still active, whereas in its southern part it seems stopped. Indeed, this area is well known as one the most seismic zone in Italy, characterized by strong earthquakes in the past that depict from the analysis of focal mechanisms an ongoing extensional tectonic regime with T-axis about NE-SW. This is also evidenced by the active fault <b>patterns,</b> <b>borehole</b> breakout data and geodetic data. Within this frame, the external area of the Apenninic belt, the foredeep and the Apulian foreland, shows minor seismicity and a prevailing strike-slip tectonics. New borehole breakouts were inferred from wells ranging from 1400 to 5500 depth and are discussed in comparison to earthquake data and a few shallow stress regime indicators. We analysed 45 new deep well data to better constrain the state of stress along the Apenninic belt and foredeep. Some of these are located along the Val d’Agri basin showing a prevalent NE-SW Shmin direction well consistent with the previous results. The most reliable data confirmed the general trend of the southern Apennines but also new insights came out...|$|R
40|$|The Oligocene of the New Jersey {{continental}} margin is divisible into {{as many as}} eight sequences and 23 lithofacies associations, documented in a series of seven boreholes across the modern coastal plain. This paper summarizes the sequence architecture of these deposits, interpreted from high-resolution biostratigraphy and Sr-isotope chemostratigraphy, and evaluates the factors that governed patterns of sedimentation, making use of previously published quantitative estimates of water-depth changes and eustasy from 2 -D foraminiferal paleoslope modeling and flexural backstripping. Each sequence is markedly wedge-shaped, thinning both landward of the rollover in the underlying sequence boundary (the point at which the surface steepens into a clinoform), and seaward of the rollover in the overlying boundary. Each bounding surface is associated with evidence for offlap-onlap geometry and at least locally with benthic foraminiferal evidence for abrupt upward shoaling. Most unconformities merge up dip into a single surface marking the Oligocene-Miocene boundary. Earliest Oligocene unconformities (33. 5 - 31. 6 Ma) merge downdip as a result of sediment starvation on the deep shelf. Conventional lithostratigraphic units within the New Jersey Oligocene are highly diachronous. For example, the base of Atlantic City Formation at Cape May (a downdip borehole) is at least 6. 6 Myr younger than the top of the same formation at ACGS# 4 (an updip <b>borehole).</b> Factors controlling <b>patterns</b> of sedimentation include: (1) a terraced physiography, with gradients ranging from 1 : 1, 000 (0. 06 °) on the coastal plain and shallow shelf and 1 : 500 (0. 11 °) on the deep shelf to less than 1 : 100 (1. 0 °) on an intermediate slope; (2) generally low siliciclastic sediment flux, with in situ production of authigenic glauconite, especially during times of transgression; (3) a location landward of the hinge zone of the passive margin, with slow tectonic subsidence augmented by compaction and sediment loading; (4) low to moderate amplitudes and rates of eustatic change (10 - 50 m over spans of ∼ 1 - 2 Myr); and (5) an active wave climate that permitted efficient lateral transport and complete bypass of sediment at paleodepths of at least 20 ± 10 m. Sequence architecture in the New Jersey Oligocene differs from that of the standard "Exxon model. " Sequences are highstand-dominated, in spite of deposition and preservation largely seaward of the rollover in each underlying sequence boundary. Transgressive systems tracts are thin. Recognizable lowstand units did not form because efficient transfer of sediment across the shallow shelf, combined with the absence of major river systems in the area of study, prevented the reorganization of sedimentation patterns commonly associated with point-source development, in spite of rates of eustatic fall considerably greater than the local rate of tectonic subsidence. Repeated eustatic rises and falls are expressed primarily by variations in paleo-water depth. Although ∼ 65 - 80 % of the shallow shelf that had been flooded during each rise became subaerially exposed during the subsequent fall, well developed offlap at each sequence boundary is due primarily to marine bypassing and degradation rather than to "forced regression. " Sequence boundaries correspond in time at their correlative conformities not with the onset of falling "relative" sea level, but with the start of eustatic rise...|$|R
40|$|Packer {{tests in}} {{boreholes}} in fractured rock involving injection or withdrawal {{of water in}} borehole segments have been standard practice in bedrock hydraulic investigations pertaining to geotechnical and water resource projects since the 1950 ’s. However in contaminant hydrogeology, the tests are conducted to assess groundwater velocity and contaminant fluxes and therefore, much improved resolution and measurement accuracy is needed. For this thesis study packer testing equipment was designed specifically for studies of contaminant behavior in fractured rock {{with the ability to}} conduct four types of hydraulic tests: constant head/flow injection step tests, slug tests, pumping tests and recovery tests, all in the same borehole test interval without removing the equipment from the hole while acquiring high precision data for calculation of transmissivity (T) and fracture hydraulic apertures (2 b). This equipment records pressure above, within, and below the test interval to gain insights regarding open <b>borehole</b> flow <b>patterns,</b> and to identify short circuiting to the open borehole above or below the test interval. The equipment measures flow rates as low as 6 ml/min up to 20 L/min, and the temperature in the test interval and at the ground surface is measured to account for density and viscosity variations. Each type of test is conducted repeatedly over a wide range of imposed applied pressures and flow rates and the equipment was applied to assess performance of this new methodology for packer testing and gain new insights concerning fractured rock hydrology in 6 boreholes in the fractured dolostone aquifer underlying the City of Guelph, Ontario. In the first stage of the equipment application in the fractured dolostone aquifer, over 150 high precision straddle packer tests using constant rate injection (Q) were conducted to identify the conditions of change from Darcian (linear) to non-Darcian (non-linear) flow based on the Q vs dP relationship where dP is the applied pressure above ambient. In the Darcian regime, the linear Q vs dP relationship passes through the origin (0, 0) where the ambient pressure represents static conditions (i. e. Q= 0 and dP= 0). After the onset of non-Darcian flow, proportionally less Q per unit dP occurs so that the interval transmissivity (T) calculated from the test results using Darcy’s Law based models is underestimated by as much as an order of magnitude. The Darcy-Missbach equation was found to be a robust conceptual model for representation of step constant Q tests in which the linear proportionality constant relates Qn vs dP. It was found that quantifying non-linear flow allows for a more accurate determination of the linear data to obtain better estimates of T and hence the hydraulic apertures derived from the T using the Cubic Law. In order to obtain hydraulic apertures from the packer test T values, the number of hydraulically active fractures in the test interval is needed. The only data collected regarding individual fractures was the core log created during the coring process and the acoustic televiewer log, both of which identify the location of fractures, but neither could tell if the fractures identified were hydraulically active. A sensitivity analysis concerning the effects of non-linear flow and the number of hydraulically active fractures on the calculated hydraulic aperture shows that the number of fractures selected as hydraulically active has the greatest effect on the aperture values. A new approach is proposed for determining apertures from hydraulic tests in fractured rock utilizing the onset of non-linear flow to aid in the choice of the number of active fractures present in the test interval. In the second stage of the equipment application, the four types of hydraulic tests (constant head, pumping, recovery, and rising/falling head slug tests) conducted in the same test interval at gradually increasing flow rates showed that non-linear flow can be most easily identified and quantified using constant head tests providing a higher degree of certainty that the data used to calculate T are from the Darcian flow regime. Slug tests are conducted most rapidly, but formation non-linear behavior is commonly exaggerated by non-linearity within the test equipment at large initial displacements. However, the equipment non-linearity can be accounted for using a Reynolds number (Re) analysis allowing identification of the non-linear flow in the formation. In addition, non-linear flow can interfere with evidence of fracture dilation. The pumping and recovery tests are the most time consuming because of the relatively long time required to reach steady state. However, these tests offer the most potential to give insight into the influences of the peripheral fracture network and rock matrix permeability on test results In addition to the actual transmissivity of the test interval T values obtained from packer tests can be influenced by several factors including non-linear flow in the formation and in the test equipment, aperture dilation or closure, hydraulic short circuiting or leakage from the test interval to the open borehole and dual permeability properties of the system (fractures and matrix). The equipment and procedures developed in this thesis provide an improved framework for identifying these influences and in some cases avoiding them so that the aperture values calculated from T measurements are more accurate than those obtained through conventional approaches. In the conventional procedures for packer testing in fractured rock as recommended in manuals and guidance documents, the applied head and flow rate can be expected, {{based on the results of}} this thesis, to produce transmissivity values biased low because of non-linear (non-Darcian) flow...|$|R
40|$|The unique Selukwe Subchamber of the Great Dyke is {{bounded by}} the Shurugwi greenstone belt (SGB) {{on the west}} side for {{approximately}} 25 km and granitoids on the east side, as compared to other subchambers of the Great Dyke that are bounded on both sides by granitoids. It is also the narrowest section of the entire Great Dyke. The extensive xenolith suite is found on the western flank and the central zone of the subchamber. This study focuses on the PAR 11 borehole and the surface xenoliths in the Selukwe Subchamber (SSC). The PAR 11 core was drilled into an anomalous sequence of ultramafic rocks situated in the Mafic Succession of the SSC. There are basically two rock types in the PAR 11 borehole: peridotites and pyroxenites. Comparison of the major and trace element geochemistry of the PAR 11 body with the MR 92 data of Coghill (1994) for the SSC reveals that they are similar but less evolved. The mineral assemblages and proportions of phases in the PAR 11 borehole samples are indicative of essentially the same composition as that which formed the layered sequence of the Great Dyke. Therefore, {{on the basis of the}} rock types and chemical compositions, the PAR 11 body and the Great Dyke cumulates appear to be petrologically and chemically similar and had the same petrogenesis. There are three rock types in the xenolith suite that have been observed in the mafic succession of the Unki area: peridotites, pyroxenites and gabbros. Major and trace elements show a wide range of compositions that have CaO/Al 2 O 3 1, which are dissimilar to both PAR 11 and MR 92 <b>borehole</b> data. REE <b>patterns</b> show depletion of LREE, with flat HREEs indicating a different magma to that which gave rise to the Great Dyke. Such flat patterns are typical of a primitive mantle source similar to that of komatiite magma. Stowe, (1974) describes dunite and chromite in the SGB and does not describe pyroxenites and gabbros. Therefore, it is not clear in the first instance that the xenoliths were derived from the SGB. It also does not necessarily mean that these rock types did not occur in the SGB and, if they did, maybe they were derived from an intrusion within the SGB that is at depth and never been seen iv before. The xenoliths do not have mineral compositions that are similar to the Great Dyke and therefore precludes them as having been derived from the Great Dyke Marginal Facies, a possible source of such rocks. Therefore, it is concluded from this study that they were inherited from another source which also does not appear to be the SGB because there is no report of such rock types (other than peridotite) in the SGB. They are also not mantle derived. The metasedimentary rocks that occur as xenoliths are banded iron formation and quartzites and are all clearly derived from the different formations of the SGB. The quartzites are from the Mont d’Or Formation and Wanderer Formation. The BIFs are from the Upper Greenstone and Wanderer Formation. The Shurugwi Greenstones were stripped off from the western flank whereas the Archean granitoids to the eastern flank of the Great Dyke remained. The conclusion from this study is that the Shurugwi greenstones and Archean granitoids of the Selukwe area were intruded by the large volume of new magma that was the parental magma to the Great Dyke. The hot parental magma carried up with it xenoliths from outside the Great Dyke and large blocks from within the Great Dyke to the uppermost rocks of the level of the P 1 pyroxenite layer and mafic unit...|$|R
