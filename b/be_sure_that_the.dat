In hemodialysis the US National Kidney Foundation Kt/V target is ≥1.3, so that one can <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> delivered dose is at least 1.2. In peritoneal dialysis the target is ≥1.7/week.|$|E

25|$|The {{reason for}} this delay in declaring postmenopause is because periods are usually erratic {{at this time of}} life. Therefore, a {{reasonably}} long stretch of time is necessary to <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> cycling has ceased. At this point a woman is considered infertile; however, the possibility of becoming pregnant has usually been very low (but not quite zero) {{for a number of years}} before this point is reached.|$|E
25|$|The total {{population}} of individual clones obtained in a molecular cloning experiment is often termed a DNA library. Libraries may be highly complex (as when cloning complete genomic DNA from an organism) or relatively simple (as when moving a previously cloned DNA fragment into a different plasmid), but it is almost always necessary to examine {{a number of different}} clones to <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> desired DNA construct is obtained. This may be accomplished through a very wide range of experimental methods, including the use of nucleic acid hybridizations, antibody probes, polymerase chain reaction, restriction fragment analysis and/or DNA sequencing.|$|E
500|$|The episode's {{title is}} a {{reference}} to Biblical apocrypha, which series creator Chris Carter felt was appropriate to the episode's thematic concerns—hidden documents and truths not brought to light. Director Kim Manners had directed a number of stand alone [...] "monster of the week" [...] episodes, but this was his first mythology-centered episode. Manners explained that [...] "there is some individual creative contribution from the directors" [...] in stand-alone episodes, but that with mythology episodes [...] "what you need to as a director is to <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> performances are there ... and that the yarn is presented in its cleanest and most interesting fashion".|$|E

500|$|Smalljon Umber {{meets with}} Ramsay Bolton and Harald Karstark. He {{explains}} to Ramsay that Jon Snow has been letting Wildlings through the Wall and fears {{that they will}} make their way south. When Ramsay asks why the Umbers have not already sworn fealty, Smalljon expresses his dislike for Roose Bolton and declares that was why Ramsay killed him, despite Ramsay's false insistence that Roose was poisoned. Ramsay offers assistance if Smalljon will swear to him as Warden of the North but he refuses, citing Roose's betrayal of his oath to Robb Stark. Instead, Smalljon demonstrates his loyalty by presenting Ramsay with [...] "a gift", two hooded figures who are revealed to be Rickon Stark and Osha. When Ramsay asks him how he can <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> boy is Rickon Stark, Smalljon presents him with the severed head of Rickon's direwolf Shaggydog.|$|E
2500|$|Optimizing {{existing}} code {{usually does}} not add new features, and worse, it might add new bugs in previously working code (as any change might). Because manually optimized code might sometimes have less [...] "readability" [...] than unoptimized code, optimization might impact maintainability {{of it as}} well. Optimization {{comes at a price}} and it is important to <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> investment is worthwhile.|$|E

[...] "Even though I had no authority to act for the committee, I decided to call Fred Buzhardt at home," [...] Thompson later wrote, [...] "I wanted to <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> White House was fully aware of what was to be disclosed so that it could take appropriate action." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{the emperor}} Constantine I {{extended}} [...] official toleration of Christianity within the Roman Empire in 313, {{huge numbers of}} pagans became converts. This period of Christianization probably saw the use of Christian images became very widespread among the faithful, though with great differences from pagan habits. Robin Lane Fox states [...] "By the early fifth century, we know of the ownership of private icons of saints; by c. 480-500, we can <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> inside of a saint's shrine would be adorned with images and votive portraits, a practice which had probably begun earlier." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{selective}} ion monitoring (SIM) certain ion fragments are {{entered into}} the instrument method and only those mass fragments are detected by the mass spectrometer. [...] The advantages of SIM are that the detection limit is lower since the instrument is only looking at {{a small number of}} fragments (e.g. three fragments) during each scan. [...] More scans can take place each second. [...] Since only a few mass fragments of interest are being monitored, matrix interferences are typically lower. [...] To additionally confirm the likelihood of a potentially positive result, it is relatively important to <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> ion ratios of the various mass fragments are comparable to a known reference standard.|$|E

2500|$|Present party designations {{have become}} empty of all contents... Vastly {{extended}} State expenditure, vastly increased demands from the taxpayer {{who has to}} provide the money, social reform regardless of expense, cash exacted from the taxpayer already at his wits' end—when were the problems of plus and minus more desperate? How are we to measure the use and abuse of industrial organization? Powerful orators find [...] "Liberty" [...] the true keyword, but then I remember hearing from a learned student that of [...] "liberty" [...] he knew well over two hundred definitions. Can we <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> [...] "haves" [...] and the [...] "have-nots" [...] will agree in their selection of the right one?

2500|$|In such cases, {{there are}} strong policy {{considerations}} supporting the principle that a trial procedure can never be considered fair {{if a person is}} kept in ignorance of the case against him or her. First, since the grounds for a reasonable suspicion that a person is involved in terrorist activity can span from incontrovertible evidence to an innocent misinterpretation of facts which can be explained away by the person, in many cases it is impossible for courts to <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> disclosure of the evidence will make no difference to the applicant. Secondly, resentment will be felt by the person and his family and friends if sanctions are imposed without any proper explanation of the grounds and when, due to the non-disclosure of information, the person is put in a position where he is unable to properly defend himself. As Lord Phillips put it, [...] "if the wider public are to have confidence in the justice system, they {{need to be able to}} see that justice is done rather than being asked to take it on trust".|$|E
2500|$|In February 1924, the Los Angeles Times {{reported}} {{that the number of}} feature films produced from the original stories or adaptations of Mr. Sullivan totaled 311 in eight years. [...] The Times noted: [...] "This record undoubtedly is unrivaled among screen authors. [...] Mr. Sullivan's work is all the more remarkable because of the recognition which it has achieved for unvarying quality and variety." [...] At that time, Sullivan described the rule he applied in the selection of a story for the screen:"Is it human, is it true to life, is it sincere? If you can conscientiously satisfy yourself on these things, you won't have to worry as to whether the public will like the story or not. [...] If you are genuinely moved by it, you may <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> public will respond in like manner. ...

2500|$|Noting that [...] and [...] both use {{the same}} {{expression}} [...] "at that time" [...] ( [...] , ba'eit ha-hiv), a Midrash deduced that {{the events of the}} two verses took place at the same time. Thus Rav Huna taught that as soon as God told Moses to hand over his office to Joshua, Moses immediately began to pray to be permitted to enter the Promised Land. The Midrash compared Moses to a governor who could <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> king would confirm whatever orders he gave so long as he retained his office. The governor redeemed whomever he desired and imprisoned whomever he desired. But as soon as the governor retired and another was appointed in his place, the gatekeeper would not let him enter the king's palace. Similarly, as long as Moses remained in office, he imprisoned whomever he desired and released whomever he desired, but when he was relieved of his office and Joshua was appointed in his stead, and he asked to be permitted to enter the Promised Land, God in [...] denied his request.|$|E
2500|$|They are {{certainly}} not unimportant men: and perhaps it may appear desirable that such men should not be irretrievably driven {{into the hands of}} the professed levellers. ...

I am one of those who feel that one country has a self-interest in the events of another, and therefore for its own sake it is entitled to watch over them. ... France ought to be watched, not altogether on account of the spirit of universal interference and conquest which she manifests but on account of the weapons she uses...; it is not the red-hot balls of her cannon that are to be dreaded, but the red-hot principles with which she charges them. An invasion from these is what you and I dread, and if we feel that an universal junction is necessary in order to repel them, the foundation of that junction must be founded in exclusion.|$|E
2500|$|The Festiniog Railway Company had, at one point, {{planned to}} open the entire railway in 2007. Delays from Government processes, a foot-and-mouth {{epidemic}} and funding restrictions meant that the opening was repeatedly delayed, with the full opening not happening until 2011. The line could not be opened to Beddgelert until the track left the National Park at Pont Ynysferlas; this restriction was imposed by the Snowdonia National Park Authority to <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> railway really meant what it said, but this suspicious attitude lost the railway a year's income from Beddgelert. From the end of May 2010, the line was extended a further [...] to [...] Shortly thereafter the railway announced that as it had approval for service by the Safety Directorate of the Office of Rail Regulation (ORR), the remaining section would be completed {{before the end of}} September 2010. The cause of this sudden rush was the ROTS to ROGS transition. This should have happened in 2006, but heritage railways gained an extension of the transition period to 1 October 2010. It was foreseen that this change in regime would bring additional costs to the railway, so it was decided to complete the line before that date. A minor delay was incurred by the necessity to build a new culvert where the new Porthmadog A487 bypass road was being built.|$|E
