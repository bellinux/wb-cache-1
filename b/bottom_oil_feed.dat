40|$|Abstract: Minimizing the {{cylinder}} wear and the consumption rate of cylinder {{oil in a}} large two-stroke marine diesel engine is of great economic importance. In Korea, a motor-driven cylinder lubricator for a large two-stroke marine diesel engine manufactured by Wärtsilä Switzerland Co., Ltd. was first developed by authors through the joint research of industry-university in 2002. The characteristic of the developed product is that can control automatically the <b>oil</b> <b>feed</b> rate to a load fluctuation by the motor drive and the offset cam. The performance of the product is not also inferior to the conventional one. For manufacturing the reliable and useful products, however, it is necessary to investigate further characteristics and improve the performance of a cylinder lubricator. In this study, the effect of quill with and without accumulator on maximum discharge pressure, delivery delay duration and <b>oil</b> <b>feed</b> rate relative to motor revolution speed using plunger stroke as a parameter is experimentally investigated by using the developed cylinder lubricator. It is found that the maximum discharge pressure with accumulator is higher than that of no accumulator as plunger stroke and motor revolution speed are elevated, and the delivery delay duration with accumulator is shorter than that of no accumulator as plunger stroke and motor revolution speed are increased. Also, <b>oil</b> <b>feed</b> rate with accumulator is les...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—The {{degradation}} of electrical insulation in trans-formers {{is more often}} due to thermal stress. In this paper, authors have attempted {{to work out a}} method of assessing the magnitude of temperature and the hottest region in the body of a large transformer with a reasonable degree of accuracy. A theoretical model has been developed based on boundary value problem of heat conduction in transformer winding using finite integral transform techniques. The model requires, in addition to electrical parameters of the transformer, information on the actual design data. The authors believe that this model predicts HST with precision and also indicates a possibility of online data acquisition.

50|$|The <b>bottom</b> product <b>oil</b> {{from the}} main {{fractionator}} contains residual catalyst particles which were not completely removed by the cyclones {{in the top of}} the reactor. For that reason, the <b>bottom</b> product <b>oil</b> is referred to as a slurry oil. Part of that slurry oil is recycled back into the main fractionator above the entry point of the hot reaction product vapors so as to cool and partially condense the reaction product vapors as they enter the main fractionator. The remainder of the slurry oil is pumped through a slurry settler. The <b>bottom</b> <b>oil</b> from the slurry settler contains most of the slurry oil catalyst particles and is recycled back into the catalyst riser by combining it with the FCC feedstock oil. The clarified slurry oil or decant oil is withdrawn from the top of slurry settler for use elsewhere in the refinery, as a heavy fuel oil blending component, or as carbon black feedstock.|$|R

40|$|Floating ring {{bearings}} are {{the commonly}} used {{type of bearing}} for automotive turbochargers. The automotive industry continuously investigates how to reduce the bearing friction losses and how to create silent turbochargers. Many of these studies involve creating a numerical model of the rotor-bearing system and performing validation on a test bench on which a turbocharger is driven by hot gases. This approach, however, involves many uncertainties which diminish {{the validity of the}} measurement results. In this study, we present a test setup in which these uncertainties are minimized. The measurement results show the behavior of the floating ring bearing as a function of <b>oil</b> <b>feed</b> pressure, <b>oil</b> <b>feed</b> temperature, rotor unbalance and bearing clearances. Next to an increased validity, the test setup provides measurement data with good repeatability and can therefore represent a case study which can be used for validation of rotor-bearing model...|$|R
40|$|Dietary fish oils, rich in (n- 3) PUFA, {{including}} {{eicosapentaenoic acid}} and docosahexaenoic acid, {{have been shown}} to have antiinflammatory properties. Although the antiinflammatory properties of fish oil may be beneficial during a chronic inflammatory illness, the same antiinflammatory properties can suppress the inflammatory responses necessary to combat acute viral infection. Given that (n- 3) fatty acid-rich fish oil supplementation is on the rise and with the increasing threat of an influenza pandemic, we tested the effect of fish <b>oil</b> <b>feeding</b> for 2 wk on the immune response to influenza virus infection. Male C 57 BL/ 6 mice fed either a menhaden fish oil/corn oil diet (4 g fish oil: 1 g corn oil, wt:wt at 5 g/ 100 g diet) or a control corn oil diet were infected with influenza A/PuertoRico/ 8 / 34 and analyzed for lung pathology and immune function. Although fish oil-fed mice had lower lung inflammation compared with controls, fish <b>oil</b> <b>feeding</b> also resulted in a 40 % higher mortality rate, a 70 % higher lung viral load at d 7 post infection, and a prolonged recovery period following infection. Although splenic natural killer (NK) cell activity was suppressed in fish oil-fed mice, lung NK activity was not affected. Additionally, lungs of infected fish oil-fed mice had significantly fewer CD 8 + T cells and decreased mRNA expression of macrophage inflammatory protein- 1 -α, tumor necrosis factor-α, and interleukin- 6. These results suggest that the antiinflammatory properties of fish <b>oil</b> <b>feeding</b> can alter the immune response to influenza infection, resulting in increased morbidity and mortality...|$|R
40|$|Studying {{the effects}} of dietary fish oil on VLDL {{metabolism}} in humans is subject to both large intra- and interindividual variability. In the present study we therefore used hyperlipidentic apolipoprotein (APO) E* 3 -Leiden mice, which have impaired chylomicron and very low density lipoprotein (VDL) remnant metabolism, to study {{the effects of}} dietary fish oil on serum lipids and VLDL kinetics under highly standardized conditions. For this, female APOE* 3 -Leiden mice were fed a fat- and cholesterol-containing diet supplemented with either 0, 3 or 6 % w/w (i. e. 0, 6, or 12 % of total energy) of fish oil. Fish oil-fed mice showed a significant dose-dependent decrease in serum cholesterol (up to - 43 %) and triglyceride levels (up to - 60 %), mainly due to a reduction of VLDL (- 80 %). LDL and HDL cholesterol levels were not affected by fish <b>oil</b> <b>feeding.</b> VLDL-apoB kinetic studies showed that fish <b>oil</b> <b>feeding</b> resulted in a significant 2 -fold increase in VLDL-apoB fractional catabolic rate (FCR). Hepatic VLDL-apoB production was, however, not affected by fish <b>oil</b> <b>feeding.</b> VLDL-triglyceride turnover studies revealed that fish oil significantly decreased hepatic VLDL-triglyceride production rate (- 60 %). A significant increase in VLDL-triglyceride FCR was observed (+ 70 %), which was not related to increased lipolytic activity. We conclude that APOE* 3 -Leiden mice are highly responsive to dietary fish oil. The observed strong reduction in serum very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) is primarily due to an effect of fish oil to decrease hepatic VLDL triglyceride production rate and to increase VLDL-apoB fractional catabolic rate...|$|R

40|$|Rhesus monkeys {{were fed}} corn or coconut {{oil-based}} diets for 3 - 6 mo to determine {{effects on the}} composition of all lipoprotein classes and on the metabolism of high density lipoproteins (HDL). Major findings included the following. (a) Coconut <b>oil</b> <b>feeding</b> increased concentrations of all classes of plasma lipo-proteins without altering lipoprotein size, suggesting an increase in particle number. (b) The percentage of saturated fatty acids in the cholesteryl esters (CE) of low density lipoproteins (LDL) and HDL reached 40 % with coconut <b>oil</b> <b>feeding.</b> This value probably constitutes a minimum estimate of the CE which were of intracellular rather than intraplasmic origin. (c) The CE in LDL and HDL were nearly identical suggesting virtually com-plete equilibration by the core lipid transfer reaction. The CE in very low density lipoproteins, in contrast, were significantly more saturated than those in LDL and HDL irrespective of diet. (d) Lower HDL levels on the corn oil diet were associated with higher fractional catabolic rates for both apolipoprotein A-I (OA 2 vs. 031 d-l) and apolipoprotein A-Il (OA 5 vs. 0. 30 d-') ...|$|R

Blood serum HDL cholesterol levels were significantly higher with the polyunsaturated than with monounsaturated fat feeding and with <b>feeding</b> of non-fish <b>oil</b> supplemented oils than when fish oil supplements were used. Lower blood serum triglyceride levels were obtained with canola and fish <b>oil</b> <b>feeding</b> as compared to other w- 3 supplemented test oils. Canola and olive <b>oil</b> <b>feeding</b> resulted in an overall increase in liver and heart total lipid and cholesterol concentrations than did the feeding of the test oils high in polyunsaturated fatty acids. ^ In the second study, eleven human adults were fed laboratory controlled diets providing 30 percent of the calories from fat; however, two-thirds of the fat (20 {{percent of the total}} dietary fat) in each period for each subject was provided by one of the three test oils: soybean oil, w- 3 enriched soybean oil and canola oil.
