40|$|Wildlife {{managers}} need chemical repellents {{that are}} effective at deterring damage by <b>birds,</b> but these <b>repellents</b> must be environmentally and toxicologically safe. The number of commercially available <b>bird</b> <b>repellents</b> {{has been reduced}} {{because of concerns about}} environmental safety. Currently, there are 2 categories of avian repellents. Chemicals that are reflexively avoided by birds because they irritate the peripheral chemical senses are referred to as primary repellents. Chemicals that cause gastrointestinal illness and learned avoidance of ancillary sensory cues that are paired with the illness are known as secondary repellents. Secondary repellents most often identified as the most effective avian repellents are derived from synthetic agrichemical pesticides and generally are regulated against because of their toxicity and concerns about the consequences of adding them to the environment. Primary repellents are usually derived from natural products and human food and flavor ingredients, and their use as <b>bird</b> <b>repellents</b> has been promoted as fulfilling the need for environmentally safe repellents. However, primary repellents are considered to be less potent than secondary repellents. We found that if the primary repellent, methyl anthranilate, was delivered enterically in European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris), we could achieve the same level of repellency as with the secondary repellent, methiocarb. Equal repellent effects for the 2 chemicals were found despite differences in their mode of action. Also, birds given an enteric delivery of the primary repellent methyl anthranilate showed fewer signs of behavioral distress (e. g., immobility and regurgitation) relative to those birds given the secondary repellent, methiocarb. By redirecting the site of action of a primary repellent, we have shown the feasibility to optimally combine the potency levels of secondary repellents with the biological and environmental safety attributes of primary repellents, without sacrificing efficacy. Primary repellents may be converted to secondary repellents via gastrointestinal delivery, thus potentially increasing efficacy and economic viability of these chemicals. Formulations that mask the irritating qualities of primary repellents are needed so that the chemical will be freely consumed by the target animal and exert its effect in the gastrointestinal tract...|$|R

40|$|The {{simultaneous}} {{completion of}} the rainy season and nesting of granivorous birds between October and November in the Sudano-sahelian region of Senegal often results in very extensive bird damage to cereal crops. This occurs from both increased bird populations, due {{to the presence of}} juveniles as well as from their accompanying change in diet from insects to seeds. The damage is caused by several species of birds, most notable the Red-billed Dioch (Quelea quelea) and the Village and Black-headed Weavers (Ploceus cuculiatus and Ploceus capitalis). The Buffalo Weaver (Bubalornis albirostris) and the Glossy Starling Lamprotornis chalybaeus) also are at times serious crop depredators. Traditionally, farmers employ many different frightening techniques to chase or scare birds from their crops. The methods provide at best only temporary relief and require considerable time and energy. A possible solution to the bird problem involves the use of chemical repellents applied directly to the ripening grain. The purpose of the trial reported here was to evaluate methiocarb or Mesurol [4 -(methylthio) - 3, 5 xylyl N - methylcarbamate] as a <b>bird</b> <b>repellent</b> on ripening sorghum. The study was undertaken {{as a part of the}} Regional UNDP/FAO Project “Research into the Control of Grain-eating Birds,” aimed at the development and improvement of control techniques to prevent or reduce bird damage to cereal crops.

Its effectiveness as a nuisance bird repellant {{is based on a}} common, naturally-occurring, com lly recognized as safe 2 ̆ 2 food and ponent of food that has been designated by the FDA as a 2 ̆ 2 generafragrance additive. Methyl Anthranilate (MA), the active ingredient in Rejex-it® <b>Bird</b> <b>Repellents,</b> acts as a sensory repellent by irri tating the bird 2 ̆ 7 s taste buds, skin, and trigeminal chemoreceptors in the beaks, gizzards, eyes, and mucous membranes. Irritation occurs as a result of exposure to or ingestion of the formulation similar to how people react to chili pepper extract. Stimulation of the trigeminal chemoreceptors leads {{to a wide variety of}} protective, but not adverse, physiological reflexes. These reflexes are an important part of the common chemical sense to prevent exposure to irritants (Parker 1912, Journal of the Academy of Natural Sciences 15 : 221 - 224). As a result, birds modify their behavior by avoiding places where they have been exposed to this stimulus. Significantly, they cannot habituate to these reflexes. Indeed, they remember and avoid the geographic location where this experience took place. However, because the impact on the olfactory nerves (odor) is minimal, subsequent visits by other, more welcomed birds are possible. So far, no bird species is to be unaffected by Rejex-it®. Furthermore, birds do not habituate to this action. Rather, they become more sensitized with repeated exposure. The exposure to the birds can be either in the form of a dry fog to their eyes and mucous membranes or through the ingestion of treated food. Food sources treated with Rejex-it® in sufficient quantities are unpalatable to all species of birds. Even if they swallow larger quantities, the birds will unwillingly regurgitate the treated food and thus will not gain any energy benefit and will look elsewhere for other sources of nourishment...|$|R
