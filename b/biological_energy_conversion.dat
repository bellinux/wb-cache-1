It is a straight line relationship when only NAD+ and ATP are considered.

40|$|Artificial photosynthesis, an {{important}} route towards future supply of renewable energy, seeks to convert sunlight into storable chemical energy such as fuels. Building upon {{the principles of}} <b>biological</b> solar <b>energy</b> <b>conversion,</b> artificial photosynthesis {{can be broken down}} into four essential processes: harvesting of visible light, charge (electron-hole) separation, oxidation of water to dioxygen, and fuel formation. Importantly, unlike natural photosynthesis, artificial photosynthesis is solely dedicated to efficient formation of fuels and is not restricted by the availability of arable land. Both water oxidation and fuel formation require efficient and selective catalysts. This work utilises certain metalloenzymes, which have evolved to catalyse fuel-generating reactions such as the formation of H 2 or the reductive activation of CO 2 to carbon-based fuels with unmatched efficiencies. In contrast to most artificial catalysts, these enzymes are composed solely of abundant elements and operate efficiently at neutral pH. Thus, although not suitable for scale-up, they can be used to mimic conditions under which future devices will have to operate and provide design criteria for the components of applied technologies. In this thesis, physico-chemical techniques are used to study the mechanism of [FeFe]-hydrogenases, the most proficient H 2 evolving catalysts that rival platinum in activity, by investigating how reversible inhibitors intercept transient enzyme states. The interaction of fuel-forming enzymes with light-absorbing semiconductor electrodes is also explored, leading to the construction of a photoelectrochemical cell for the selective, light-driven reduction of CO 2. Furthermore, this thesis demonstrates that metalloenzymes can be used to establish new directions in artificial photosynthesis research, driving endergonic organic reactions such as specific C=C hydrogenation. </p...|$|R

40|$|Charge {{migration}} for {{electron transfer}} via the polypeptide matrix of proteins {{is a key}} process in <b>biological</b> <b>energy</b> <b>conversion</b> and signaling systems. It is sensitive to the sequence of amino acids composing the protein and, therefore, offers a tool for chemical control of charge transport across biomaterial-based devices.

We investigated the solid-state electron transport (ETp) across a self-assembled monolayer of these peptides between gold contacts. The single tryptophan "doping" markedly increased the conductance of the peptide chain, especially when its location in the sequence is close to the electrodes. Combining inelastic tunneling spectroscopy, UV photoelectron spectroscopy, electronic structure calculations by advanced density-functional theory, and dc current-voltage analysis, the role of tryptophan in ETp is rationalized by charge tunneling across a heterogeneous energy barrier, via electronic states of alanine and tryptophan, and by relatively efficient direct coupling of tryptophan to a Au electrode. These results reveal a controlled way of modulating the electrical properties of molecular junctions by tailor-made "building block" peptides...|$|E

The latter is composed of eight transmembrane α-helices which, in duplicate, form a hydrophobic core of a dimer. We show that two cytochromes b can be fused into one 16 -helical subunit using a number of different peptide linkers that vary in length but all connect the C-terminus of one cytochrome with the N-terminus of the other. The fusion proteins replace two cytochromes b in the dimer defining a set of available protein templates for introducing mutations that allow breaking symmetry of a dimer. A more detailed comparison of the form with the shortest, 3 amino acid, linker to the form with 12 amino acid linker established that both forms display similar level of structural plasticity to accommodate several, but not all, asymmetric patterns of mutations that knock out individual segments of cofactor chains.

Since the mechanistic details of the coupling of redox and protonation reactions in the active sites are largely unresolved, we have identified residues that undergo redox-linked protonation state changes. Structure-based Poisson–Boltzmann/Monte Carlo titration calculations have been performed for completely reduced and completely oxidised cytochrome bc 1. Different crystallographically observed conformations of Glu 272 and surrounding residues of the cytochrome b subunit in cytochrome bc 1 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae have been considered in the calculations. Coenzyme Q (CoQ) has been modelled into the CoQ oxidation site (Qo-site). Our results indicate that both conformational and protonation state changes of Glu 272 of cytochrome b may contribute to the postulated gating of CoQ oxidation. The Rieske iron–sulphur cluster could be shown to undergo redox-linked protonation state changes of its histidine ligands in the structural context of the CoQ-bound Qo-site. The proton acceptor role of the CoQ ligands in the CoQ reduction site (Qi-site) is supported by our results.

A thorough understanding of the physiology of cyanobacteria requires detailed knowledge of these organisms at the level of cellular architecture and organization. In these prokaryotes, the large membrane protein complexes of the photosynthetic and respiratory electron transport chains function in the intracellular thylakoid membranes. Like plants, the architecture of the thylakoid membranes in cyanobacteria has direct impact on cellular bioenergetics, protein transport, and molecular trafficking. However, whole-cell thylakoid organization in cyanobacteria is not well understood. Here we present, by using electron tomography, an in-depth analysis of the architecture of the thylakoid membranes in a unicellular cyanobacterium, Cyanothece sp. ATCC 51142. Based on the results of three-dimensional tomographic reconstructions of near-entire cells, we determined that the thylakoids in Cyanothece 51142 form a dense and complex network that extends throughout the entire cell. This thylakoid membrane network is formed from the branching and splitting of membranes and encloses a single lumenal space. The entire thylakoid network spirals as a peripheral ring of membranes around the cell, an organization that has not previously been described in a cyanobacterium. Within the thylakoid membrane network are areas of quasi-helical arrangement with similarities to the thylakoid membrane system in chloroplasts.

40|$|The {{photosynthetic}} reaction center (RC) from purple {{photosynthetic bacteria}} is a membrane-bound protein-pigment complex {{that serves as}} an excellent model for studying <b>biological</b> <b>energy</b> <b>conversion.</b> This energy conversion takes place by electron transfer reactions, which occur within the protein and are often coupled to conformational changes. In order to study these conformational changes, recovery of the oxidized bacteriochlorophyll dimer, from the RC of the purple photosynthetic bacterium Rhodobacter sphaeroides, to its original state was measured by light-minus-dark optical difference spectroscopy. Laser flash excitation generated an electron transfer that takes place across the membrane; creating the primary charge-separated state with a lifetime of 100 ms. Prolonged illumination induced subsequent conformational rearrangements in the RC protein complex which result in lifetimes of the same charge-separated state that are significantly different from that measured after flash excitation. The structural details of the conformational rearrangements on the molecular level will be discussed. The conformational changes were sensitive to duration and wavelength of illumination, pH, temperature, hydrophobic environment (liposome or detergent), head-group charge of the detergent, and presence of a bound metal ion. By systematically varying these parameters, {{we were able to}} extend the lifetime of the charge-separated state up to 21 mins.
