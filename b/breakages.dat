Transport aircraft were vulnerable in the air, and required fighter escorts. They were also subject to destruction on the ground by Japanese air raids. The loss of the airstrip at Kokoda led to the adoption of air dropping.

40|$|Abstract In the {{existing}} JKMRC <b>breakage</b> testing method for AG/SAG mill modelling, ore is characterised using mainly high energy single impact tests. However, recent DEM {{studies have suggested}} that <b>breakage</b> in AG/SAG mills is mainly due to low energy repetitive (or multiple) collisions rather than single high energy impacts. Furthermore, several of the published AG/SAG ore hardness tests developed outside the JKMRC use laboratory tumbling mills to quantify the specific power required to grind the ore to a set product size. Comprehensive experiments were carefully designed using two mill diameters of 1. 1 and 0. 6 m to mimic the reported low energy repetitive impact <b>breakage</b> under low load conditions. The ore <b>breakage</b> characterisation parameters derived from high energy single impact tests were used to predict the low energy repetitive impact <b>breakage</b> behaviour. Significant bias {{has been shown to be}} associated with the traditional high energy single impact characterisation approach, suggesting an alternative method was required. An extensive experimental program with more than 1400 tests was conducted using a newly developed JKRBT (JKMRC Rotary <b>Breakage</b> Tester) device, gravity drop test and laboratory tumbling mills. Comprehensive data were collected and analysed to provide an understanding of low energy repetitive impact <b>breakage</b> of particles and high energy single impact <b>breakage.</b> Details of the experimental study and findings are presented in Chapter 5. A <b>breakage</b> characterisation model has been developed, which takes into account the various impact energy classes and their associated body <b>breakage</b> and surface <b>breakage</b> responses. The <b>breakage</b> conditions were analysed and used to derive two sets of impact <b>breakage</b> parameters (body <b>breakage</b> and surface <b>breakage).</b> These parameters were then combined using a procedure believed to account for the two key <b>breakage</b> modes in tumbling, and successfully applied to predict the <b>breakage</b> in the two laboratory tumbling mills. Chapter 6 presents the <b>breakage</b> modelling approach and results. Based on the understanding of different <b>breakage</b> modes, a novel particle <b>breakage</b> characterisation method for AG/SAG mill modelling has been proposed and validated. Different from the prior-art JKMRC approach in which the <b>breakage</b> tests are conducted at high energy single impact, the proposed method incorporates high energy single impact, low energy multiple impacts and a simplified tumbling test. Both <b>breakage</b> probability and degree of <b>breakage</b> are used to characterise the <b>breakage</b> behaviour of ores. The details of the new characterisation method can be found in Chapter 7. The studies conclude that • The JKRBT can be used to investigate rock <b>breakage</b> characteristics under single and repetitive impacts; • The <b>breakage</b> of rocks in tumbling mills (under very low load conditions) can be likened to the low energy JKRBT repetitive impact <b>breakage.</b> • The behaviour of particle <b>breakage</b> as observed in AG/SAG milling can be modelled using a combination of JKRBT and tumbling ore <b>breakage</b> characterization; • A methodology for ore <b>breakage</b> characterization for AG/SAG mill modelling has been proposed and validated using independent sets of ores samples...|$|R
40|$|AbstractMost of the <b>breakage</b> models {{available}} in literature commonly assume binary <b>breakage</b> only.

5|$|Tooth {{breakage}} {{is related}} to a carnivore's behavior. A study of nine modern carnivores found that one in four adults had suffered tooth breakage and that half of these <b>breakages</b> were of the canine teeth. The most breakage occurred in the spotted hyena that consumes all of its prey including the bone; the least breakage occurred in the African wild dog, and the gray wolf ranked in between these two. The eating of bone {{increases the risk of}} accidental fracture due to the relatively high, unpredictable stresses that it creates. The most commonly broken teeth are the canines, followed by the premolars, carnassial molars, and incisors. Canines are the teeth most likely to break because of their shape and function, which subjects them to bending stresses that are unpredictable in both direction and magnitude. The risk of tooth fracture is also higher when killing large prey.|$|E

Prost finished the year 15th in the Drivers' Championship, equalling points with former world champion Emerson Fittipaldi. Despite the encouraging debut season, Prost had several accidents, breaking his wrist during practice at Kyalami and suffering a concussion during practice at Watkins Glen. He also retired from the Canadian round in Montreal a week earlier because of rear suspension failure. At the end of the season, despite having two years remaining on his contract, he left McLaren and signed with Renault. Prost has said that he left because of the large number of <b>breakages</b> on the car and because he felt the team blamed him for some of the accidents.|$|E
25|$|Piecing {{involved}} repairing sporadic yarn <b>breakages.</b> At the rollers, {{the broken}} yarn would be {{caught on the}} underclearer (or fluker rod on Bolton mules), while at the spindle it would knot itself into a whorl on the spindle tip. If the break happened on the winding stroke the spindle {{might have to be}} stopped while the thread was found. The number of yarn <b>breakages</b> was dependent {{on the quality of the}} roving, and quality cotton led to fewer <b>breakages.</b> Typical 1,200 spindle mules of the 1920s would experience 5 to 6 <b>breakages</b> a minute. The two piecers would thus need to repair the thread within 15 to 20 seconds while the mule was in motion but once they had the thread it took under three seconds. The repair actually involved a slight rolling of the forefinger against the thumb.|$|E
40|$|Understanding ore <b>breakage</b> {{is the key}} for the {{development}} of appropriate <b>breakage</b> characterisation experiments. Hence, there has been significant effort to understand a single <b>breakage</b> event, both from the experimental and the modelling standpoints. One particularly interesting approach is to consider <b>breakage</b> of a particle, for instance in a drop weight tester, as a sequence of primary and secondary <b>breakage</b> components. Secondary <b>breakage</b> is defined as subsequent <b>breakage</b> of progeny that takes place after the primary fracture of the parent particle due to surplus energy that is provided by the comminution or <b>breakage</b> testing device. This influences the spatial distribution of fragments as well as their selection. Due to the complex nature of secondary <b>breakage,</b> most of the researches in the past have either been dedicated to understanding primary fracture as a basic element of every comminution process or to describe the <b>breakage</b> process as a whole. However, the progression of <b>breakage</b> may be modelled properly by incorporating the sequential <b>breakage</b> of fragments into a <b>breakage</b> process model. In the paper, a novel approach is proposed to describe a single <b>breakage</b> event by modelling it as a process through several stages of primary fracture while appreciating the effect of sequential fragmentation. The model has three main components: the primary <b>breakage,</b> the selection, and the classification functions. The data that served as the basis for demonstrating this model were a number of impact experiments in an impact load cell on quartz and apatite particles. The results indicate a good correspondence between experiments and model fit. Additionally, a sensitivity analysis to changes in selection and classification functions was performed, which indicated a strong dependency of a <b>breakage</b> event on its sub-processes. It is envisaged that this approach will allow decoupling the contributions of the ore and of the stressing conditions on the outcome of the <b>breakage</b> event...|$|R

40|$|An {{improved}} <b>breakage</b> kernel {{was developed}} to describe the kinetics of aggregate <b>breakage</b> induced by fluid shear. The model includes the effects of both the internal bonding forces of an aggregate and the fluid shear stress exerting on the aggregate. The ratio of the two opposite forces regulates the probability of the aggregate <b>breakage.</b> With the improved <b>breakage</b> model and the sectional numerical technique, the <b>breakage</b> dominant process can be well simulated by the change in particle size distribution (PSD). The {{results show that the}} fractal dimension plays {{a significant role in the}} <b>breakage</b> process. AS the fractal dimension approaches three, the aggregates become more difficult to break. Higher shear intensity, to a great extent, enhances the <b>breakage</b> kinetics. The internal forces are directly related to the bonding strength of the aggregates.

40|$|Includes abstract. Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 108 - 115). Single particle impact <b>breakage</b> experiments provide {{essential data}} {{to aid in}} the fundamental understanding of rock fracture in comminution. Such experiments, conducted using devices such as the drop weight tester, split Hopkinson bars and more recently the rotary <b>breakage</b> tester, have been successfully used to characterize ore <b>breakage</b> properties in relation to measured fracture energies. Current theoretical understanding of impact <b>breakage</b> is that there are three important energy regimes to the process. Below a certain energy value, Eo, <b>breakage</b> will never occur for an infinite number of impacts. Second is an intermediate energy zone for which <b>breakage</b> occurs after a number of consecutive impacts and after a critical energy value, Ecrit, is a regime where <b>breakage</b> typically occurs for a single impact. This work was therefore undertaken in order to identify the energy values described for impact <b>breakage</b> of a chosen homogenous ore and a conventional mining gold ore. Drop weight tests on gold ore were used to calculate A and b hardness parameters using both the standard JK <b>breakage</b> model and the modified Shi-Kojovic model. The A x b values with the modified model gave consistently higher values than the standard model, typically increasing by 2 - 5 %. Split Hopkinson pressure bars were used to establish the ultimate compressive stress of blue stone through single impact <b>breakage</b> tests and the fraction of impact energy utilized to cause particle fracture. From these tests it was noted that less than 50 % of available impact energy was utilized to cause fracture, with cylindrical specimens absorbing the highest fraction of 43 %. The rotary <b>breakage</b> tester was used to conduct incremental <b>breakage</b> experiments with blue stone and gold ore. The probability to <b>breakage</b> at the impact energies tested was found to remain relatively consistent over consecutive impacts. This showed that a model could be fitted between the cumulative probability to <b>breakage</b> and the number of impacts at these energy levels. The values of Eo for blue stone and gold ore were calculated to be 0. 0464 and 0. 00366 respectively. Ecrit for 90 % probability to first impact <b>breakage</b> for these two ores was 0. 344 and 0. 281 respectively. It was found that incremental <b>breakage</b> was much more inefficient than single impact <b>breakage.</b> From tests with both split Hopkinson pressure bars and the rotary <b>breakage</b> tester, <b>breakage</b> degrees for single impacts increased rapidly with increase in <b>breakage</b> energy whilst the <b>breakage</b> degrees obtained from incremental <b>breakage</b> tests for similar amounts of energy expended remained low...|$|R
