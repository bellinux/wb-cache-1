[...] The monarch trampled, the religion trampled, the country trampled, by this savage and atrocious power in {{a few people in}} the government circle. That is the circle of ogres, of ghosts, of trolls, of demons (...) , all in there... So even Devadatta [...] saw the harm he caused, and he was rewarded for his good deed. He would attain Buddhahood (...) [...] For those who have made mistakes, if we see the harm we cause, we can still get by. <b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> with Thailand? What kind of governance?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> {{you would}} have me do?" [...] asked Mr. Labouchere, who often had claimants on his bounty and his autographs.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Ah--proof. Now we {{are coming}} at it. The {{statements}} agree; they agree with--with--anyway, they agree; I noticed that; <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> they prove--I mean, in particular?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll do <b>it,</b> Sandy. <b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>it</b> you <b>was</b> {{saying about}} unsacrilegious things, which people expect to get, {{and will be}} {{disappointed}} about?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I didn't see {{anything}} in her,--that <b>was</b> the difficulty. <b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> it--what <b>is</b> <b>it,</b> Celia? You know how I hate these delays." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{wonder if}} that man was a scoundrel. He has gone wrong on earth, no doubt, has failed and degenerated, <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>it</b> sent him wrong? Was his failure inherent, or did some net of cross {{purposes}} tangle about his feet? Suppose {{he is not a}} failure in Utopia!...|$|R
60|$|Charlie Ward. To {{make your}} escape. Oh! that's different. [Coming closer.] <b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> you did? You don't {{look like one}} {{that would be in}} trouble. But {{sometimes}} a gentleman gets a bit wild when he has a drop taken.|$|E
6000|$|... "Possibly not; though, {{being a man}} of a {{good deal}} of charming taste, I think he often has uncomfortable hours. <b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> to say of a being of his {{opportunities}} that he's not miserable? Besides, I believe he is." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But, my dear Ballindine; {{what is it}} I'm to do?" [...] said he. [...] "Of {{course you}} know, I'd do {{anything}} for you, as of course I ought--anything {{that ought to be}} done; <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> exactly you wish me to say?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Here not was self-denial; {{he would}} not do as they did that went before him, neither himself, nor should his servants; <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>it</b> that put him upon these acts of self-denial? The answer is, the fear of God: [...] "but so did not I, because {{of the fear of}} God." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm {{very glad}} of that, Selina, <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>it?</b> I'm sure {{it could not}} have come from poor Mrs Ellison, or the bishop's wife; and you seemed to me to spend all your time in talking to them. Virtue, they say, is its own reward: I don't know what other {{satisfaction}} you can have had from them." ...|$|R
60|$|Her case <b>was</b> bad enough, <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>it</b> to Perkins's? Fancy his blank {{surprise}} and rage at having his love thus suddenly ravished from him, and his delicious tete-a-tete interrupted. He managed, in an inconceivably short space of time, {{to conjure up}} half-a-million obstacles to his union. What should he do? he would rush on to Baker Street, and wait there until his Lucy left Lady Gorgon's house.|$|R
6000|$|And now--if anyone shall say--This may be {{all very}} true. <b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> to me? You are talking about nature; about animals and plants, and lands and seas. What I come to church to hear of, is about my own soul-- ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> {{that has}} got thy heart, and that keeps it from thy Saviour? [...] "Who in the heaven can be {{compared}} unto the Lord? who among {{the sons of the}} mighty can be likened unto the Lord?" [...] Psl. lxxxix. 6.

[...] Then after a pause, [...] "Your image is splendid," [...] I went on--"your {{being out of}} the cave. <b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> exactly," [...] I insidiously threw out, [...] "that you call the 'light of day'?" ...|$|E
40|$|In {{the eighteenth}} and nineteenth centuries, the {{approach}} to medicine was vastly different from today. Health is now recognised, at least in most European countries, as a universal right, <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>it</b> like in the past? How did social and political boundaries affect access to treatment, and <b>what</b> <b>were</b> the treatments of the day? This unit examines how Scottish healthcare institutions were influenced by these underlying social, economic, political and cultural contexts. ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Who said I was afraid?" [...] growled {{the mate}} sulkily. [...] "I'm as ready as any {{man in the}} ship. <b>But,</b> captain, <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> that you intend to do?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Westover {{listened with}} less {{thought of the}} fact itself than of another fact that it threw light upon. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> clear to him now that the Class-Day {{scrapping}} which had left its marks upon Jeff's face was with Lynde, and that when Jeff got him in his power he {{was in such a}} fury for revenge that no mere motive of prudence could have arrested him. In both events, <b>it</b> must have <b>been</b> Bessie Lynde that was the moving cause; <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>it</b> that stayed Jeff in his vengeance? ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh, yes, you're here. You're all right. <b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>it,</b> Mr Beauchamp? There's {{something}} up, and {{you must}} have heard.' And so {{it was clear to}} Mr Beauchamp that the man knew nothing about it himself. If there was anything wrong, Melmotte was not aware that the wrong had been discovered. 'Is it anything about the election to-morrow?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Money--yes!" [...] he exclaimed, apropos of some demand made {{upon him}} by a {{charitable}} society. [...] "They come to me for my money--there is always Scherer, they say. He will make up the deficit in the hospitals. <b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> they do for me? Nothing. Do they invite me to their houses, to their parties?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Beware how you speak, prince,' I {{answered}} mocking him, 'for {{there are}} those who did they hear, might cause YOU to rue YOUR words. Still one day you may be emperor, and then we shall see how you will deal with the Teules, at least others will see though I shall not. <b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> now? Does Montezuma choose new wives?' ...|$|E
6000|$|I awoke fully an {{hour before}} my {{customary}} time. This in itself was remarkable, and I lay very wide awake, pondering over <b>it.</b> Something <b>was</b> the matter, something was wrong--I knew not <b>what.</b> I <b>was</b> oppressed by a premonition of something terrible that had happened or was about to happen. <b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>it?</b> I strove to orient myself. I remembered {{that at the time}} of the Great Earthquake of 1906 many claimed they awakened some moments before the first shock and that during these moments they experienced strange feelings of dread. Was San Francisco again to be visited by earthquake? ...|$|R
6000|$|Bickley {{was struck}} at once, as I had been, with the {{resemblance}} {{of the figure}} {{to that of the}} Egyptian Osiris. Of course there were differences. For instance, instead of the crook and the scourge, this divinity held a torch. Again, in place of the crown of Egypt it wore a winged head-dress, though <b>it</b> <b>is</b> true this was not very far removed from the winged disc of that country. The wings that sprang from its shoulders, however, suggested Babylonia rather than Egypt, or the Assyrian bulls that are similarly adorned. All of these symbolical ideas might have been taken from that figure. <b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>it?</b> <b>What</b> <b>was</b> <b>it?</b> ...|$|R
5000|$|Asked {{about the}} {{appearance}} of D.H Lawrence in the novel, Dunmore explained [...] "Their story needed to be told. We know the bare bones of <b>what</b> happened - <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>it</b> like for him and Frieda in this landscape? The details intrigued me: Lawrence creating a garden, growing things like salsify, getting in tons of manure. He {{knew how to do}} practical things - the ironing, the washing - and his combination of day-to-day good sense and {{the life of the mind}} fascinated me. I felt there were some interesting things about that particular period and about what turned him against England." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thy frankness," [...] {{said the}} Sub-Prior, [...] "shall surely {{advantage}} thee; for much it concerns the Church in these broken times {{to know the}} purposes and motives of those around us. <b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> that thy master expects from us in reward of good service? for I esteem him {{one of those who}} are not willing to work without their hire." ...|$|E
6000|$|... ‘I {{begin to}} {{interest}} you,’ she cried. ‘But, frankly, you are condemned to help me. If the service I {{had to ask}} of you were serious, were suspicious, were even unusual, I should say no more. <b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>it?</b> To take a pleasure trip (for which, if you will suffer me, I propose to pay) and to carry from one lady to another a sum of money! What can be more simple?’ ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What is sudden, mother? What is sudden?" [...] Jack asked. [...] "What {{is it all}} about?" [...] and noticing a tear on his mother's cheek, he went on, [...] "It can't {{be those}} beastly verses, is it?" [...] the subject most upon his mind being prominent. [...] "But no, it couldn't be that. Even if Wallace took it into his head to make a row about them, {{there would not be}} time. <b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>it,</b> mother?" ...|$|E
5000|$|Kathleen Wiedel from TV Fanatic, gave a 4.5 {{star rating}} out of 5, stating: [...] "Well, now we know. I think. Maybe. Do we? I'm not sure. In Grimm Season 5 Episode 12, Nick and Monroe {{successfully}} retrieved the long-hidden Crusader treasure, {{the culmination of}} a mystery that was first introduced in {{the very beginning of the}} series, Grimm Season 1 Episode 1. <b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>it</b> that the seven Grimm knights thought was so important or dangerous or valuable that they hid in a mausoleum in the middle of the Black Forest? Apparently, a stick." ...|$|R
60|$|That {{something}} terrible had occurred all knew; <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> {{no one could}} say.|$|R
6000|$|<b>But</b> say, <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>it?</b> Thought of fear! [...] Well may ye tremble when ye hear! [...] --A Household Tub, {{like one}} of those [...] Which women use to wash their clothes, [...] This carried the blind Boy.|$|R
6000|$|But Mishcha listened {{more closely}} still. [...] "I hear his heart beating; I hear his drowsy blood just come and go. <b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> that, sweeter than a panther's breath, smells so of Magic? We must not harm the little Mulgar, sister; he is cunning. A Meermut of Magic would soon return to plague us." [...] So she wrapped him up still closer in dry leaves and tree-moss, {{and opened his}} mouth to {{sprinkle}} a pinch of snow between his lips.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{think that}} there is wisdom in your dreams, Mopo," [...] she said at length. [...] "You were ever a strange man, to whom the gates of {{distance}} are no bar. Now it is borne in upon my heart that Umslopogaas still lives, and now I shall die happy. Yes, gainsay me not; I shall die, I know it. I read it in the king's eyes. <b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>it?</b> It is nothing, if only the prince Umslopogaas yet lives." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There {{are women}} who contentedly live on, year after year, a life of idleness, while the husband and father is {{straining}} every nerve, growing prematurely old and gray, abridged of almost every form of recreation or pleasure,--all that he may keep them {{in a state of}} careless ease and festivity. It may be very fine, very generous, very knightly, in the man who thus toils at the oar that his princesses may enjoy their painted voyages; <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> for the women? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{doubt it}} not, mon ami," [...] quoth the archer, {{going back to}} his tankard. [...] "Here is to thee, lad, and may we be good comrades to each other! <b>But,</b> hola! <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> that ails our friend of the wrathful face?" ...|$|R
60|$|PEW. Right you are, and so I <b>am.</b> <b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> looks? <b>It's</b> the 'art {{that does}} it: the 'art is the seaman's star; and here's old David Pew's {{a matter of}} fifty years at sea, but tough and sound as the British Constitootion.|$|R
60|$|At this, {{the colored}} woman made a remark to the queen, <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> {{we did not}} know.|$|R
