40|$|Hemicelluloses are a {{group of}} heteropolysaccharides which {{accounts}} for 33 % by dry weight of the total lignocellulosic biomass. Xylan {{is one of the}} most important and abundantly found hemicellulose which has diverse structures according to the source from which it is extracted. Due to its structural diversity, xylan is hydrolysed by a class of xylanase enzymes into its monomeric xylose subunits. These xylose residues when treated with yeasts get converted into ethanol which can be used as a supplement along with natural fuels. Ethanol production by biological means not only reduces the cost of production but also decreases the formation of inhibitors which are formed during chemical pretreatment of xylan that hampers the process of fermentation. Besides bioethanol production xylanases have also got many other productive uses in various industries such as paper pulp <b>bleaching,</b> <b>oil</b> extraction, food additives, bakeries, detergents, fodder industries, etc. Twelve strains were isolated from environmental samples like cow dung, leaf litter, waste water, soil, termites, etc. The isolated strains were confirmed for xylanase production on xylan agar plates and Congo red assay. Activity of endoxylanases (1 - 4 â-D xylanases) was determined by measuring the amount of reducing sugar from xylan which was estimated spectrophotometrically with 3, 5 dinitrosalycilic acid using xylose as standard. The isolated strains produced maximum xylanase at 37 ᵒC at a pH of 6. 8 to 7. 0 after 120 h of incubation. Xylanases extracted from different strains showed maximum activity at an optimal pH of 7. 0 and optimal temperature 40 ᵒC. The value of km and Vmax recorded for highest xylanase producing strain JS 4 (7) was recorded to be 0. 25 mg/ml and 83 µg/ml/min.

40|$|The {{final stage}} of edible soybean oil {{manufacture}} is refining, the most delicate phase of which is bleaching. At this step, undesirable substances are removed, such as pigments, traces of metals, phospholipids and certain degradation products. However, certain valua-ble compounds such as tocopherols and sterols may also be removed, significant loss of oxidative stability can occur, and fatty acid content may increase. To avoid these negative <b>oil</b> changes, <b>bleaching</b> parameters such as the concentration of bleaching clay, temperature and duration should be optimized. Since bleaching conditions depend on {{the properties of the}} bleaching clay {{as well as on the}} type of crude <b>oil,</b> <b>bleaching</b> parameters should be opti-mized with different types of clay for each vegetable oil. Since such optimization has not yet been reported for soybean oil treated with Pure-Flo ® Supreme Pro-Active bleaching ad-sorbent, this study investigates the effect of bleaching parameters on bleaching efficiency, oxidative stability and the content and composition of bioactive compounds (tocopherols and sterols) using the above mentioned clay in this type of oil. Results show that the amount of clay had the greatest influence on bleaching efficiency, especially according to the Lovi-bond scale, on transparency, and on phosphorus content.

A technologically feasible cottonseed oil-isopropyl alcohol (IPA) miscella refining process was developed to produce high quality cottonseed oil. Individual steps necessary to refine cottonseed oil-IPA miscella were determined and improved. These were: 1) homogenization of the cottonseed oil-IPA miscella with caustic solution; 2) centrifugation; 3) separation of miscella layers; 4) desolventization, 5) water washing and drying; and 6) bleaching. In neutralization, the miscella was mixed with 20 Be' caustic solution (50 % excess) by using a Sonolator for 15 times. The refined oils from both the bottom and top layers were water washed using 12. 5 % and 20 % (w/w) hot water, respectively. The water washing efficiently recovered the oil from the top layer miscella and reduced the soap and phosphorus content. The water washed and dried oils from the bottom and top layers were treated with 0. 5 % and 4 % (w/w) acid activated bleaching clay, respectively. Good quality refined and <b>bleached</b> <b>oil</b> was obtained. However, the quality of the <b>bleached</b> <b>oil</b> produced from bottom layer was better than that from the top layer.

30|$|The figure {{shows that}} {{temperature}} does not influence the activation and future increase in temperature tends to darken the colour of the <b>bleached</b> <b>oil.</b> The {{reason for that}} may be that temperature does not affect activated carbon (A 1 and A 2) surface properties. Activated carbon releases adsorbed particles to oil when increasing temperature from 20 to 100  °C and then these particles burn and give the dark colour to oil. On the other hand, these activated carbons can interact with oil very well at low temperatures. Furthermore, it is deduced from Fig.  3 a that sample A 2 shows much higher bleaching capacity {{when compared to the}} other activated carbons and bleaching earth. A 2 was reduced red colour from 5.3 to 1.8 at 20  °C temperature, but A 4 obtained this value at 100  °C, so A 2 is more energy efficient than A 4.|$|R
30|$|The {{effect of}} {{bleaching}} contact time for activated carbon and bleaching earth samples also was investigated. To study {{the effect of}} contact time on bleaching performance of the activated carbons, the bleaching process was performed at different times ranging from 15 to 35  min, with 1 % A 1, A 2 and 1.5 % A 3, A 4 adsorbents. The results are shown in Fig.  3 b. The variation of bleaching performance showed {{an increase in the}} first 20  min and a slight increase up to 30  min when the increase of time had no significant effect on the adsorbent modification and thus the bleaching process. Further increase in contact time tends to darken the colour of the <b>bleached</b> <b>oil.</b> Thus, the optimum activation time was about 30  min for all adsorbents. This result is in agreement with the literature, which states that the contact time for effective bleaching typically ranges from 15 to 45  min, with 20 to 30  min being most common. From Fig.  3 b, it is seen that the bleaching curve of activated carbon samples A 1 and A 2 {{is similar to that of}} commercial bleaching earth. However, A 1 and A 2 can be considered more effective adsorbent as it is used 0.5 % less than other adsorbents.

The samples selected {{for this study were}} naturally occuring clays from Ankara and Eskiehir regions. The acid activated zeolite was also used for the purpose to compare its bleaching performance with commercial bleaching clay, Tonsil and the acid activated clays. The clay minerals were activated with hydrochloric acid (HCl) at three acid concentrations (1 N, 3 N, 5 N), activation times (1 h, 2 h, 3 h) and different dry clay/acid ratios. The clay samples from the Ankara and Eskiehir regions were defined as montmorillonite according to X- ray diffraction (XRD). XRD results proved that acid activation caused structural changes in the treated montmorillonites, montmorillonite peaks gradually disappearing and yielding to an amorphous montmorillonite structure. The TGA results showed a significant weight loss between 30 C - 200 C (15 %) for the Ankara clay and between 20 - 200 (12 %) for the Eskiehir clay. This was most probably due to the removal of free and hydrogen-bonded water molecules. Maximum surface area was obtained for the acid activated Ankara clay treated with 1 N HCl for 3 hours. It was determined to be 849. 1 m 2 /g. Also, maximum surface area was 269. 7 m 2 /g for the acid activated Eskiehir clay treated with 5 N HCl for 1 hour. Then the surface area of the acid activated clays decreased sharply with the acid activation. The chemical compositions of the solutions and clays after acid activation were determined using ICP and EDX analysis, respectively. According to the results, the dissolution amount of CaO, Na 2 O, MgO, K 2 O, Fe 2 O 3 and Al 2 O 3 increased along with increasing acid concentration and treatment time. The SiO 2 content and the Si 02 /Al 2 O 3 ratio increased as a result of dissolving of aluminium ions. This ratio increased from 6. 0 to 7. 5 for the acid activated Eskiehir clay and from 2. 7 to 3. 9 for acid activated Ankara clay. Acid activated clays were tested for the assessment of their bleaching efficiency for sunflower oil in the laboratory. Bleaching tests were carried out with earths prepared at different acid activation conditions such as acid concentration and activation times. The absorbance value was measured at 455 nm and found to be 0. 429 for the neutralized sunflower oil. Peroxide value and free-fatty acid content of the neutralized oil were found to be 16. 8 meq/kg and 0. 07 %, respectively. The <b>oil</b> <b>bleached</b> with the acid activated Ankara clay had a peroxide value of 46. 2 meq/kg first, which decreased to 22. 4 meq/kg and the free-fatty acid content was observed to be around 0. 08 %. For acid activated Eskiehir clay, peroxide value of the <b>bleached</b> <b>oil</b> initially increased up to 31. 2 meq/kg, then decreased under the peroxide value of neutralized oil (16. 8 meq/kg) and free-fatty acid content of <b>bleached</b> <b>oil</b> approximately was around 0. 09 %. The bleaching parameters which were used for testing were 1 % earth concentration and 30 minutes contact time at 100 °C bleaching temperature. At these selected parameters, acid activated Eskiehir clay (5 N 1 h HCl treatment), Ankara clay (1 N 3 h HCl treatment) and zeolite (2 N 6 h HNO 3 treatment) were compared with the commercial bleaching clay, Tonsil. The smallest value of absorbance and bleaching efficiency were found to be 0. 084 and 80 %, respectively with the Eskiehir clay and these values were determined to be 0. 083 and 81 % with the Tonsil under the same conditions. The absorbance value and bleaching efficiency of the <b>bleached</b> <b>oil</b> with acid activated Ankara clay were determined to be 0. 114 and 73 %, respectively using the selected bleaching parameters. Bleaching performance of Ankara clay was found to be lower when compared with the result of Eskiehir clay. At the selected bleaching point, results of lovibond red and yellow color of <b>bleached</b> <b>oil</b> indicated that the Eskiehir clay and Tonsil were close to each other in bleaching efficiency (Red color: 0. 8 and 1. 1; yellow color: 20 and 20 for Tonsil and Eskiehir clay, respectively). Zeolite did not reach the required bleaching performance. The bleaching efficiency was 25 % with raw zeolite and it hardly increased to 46 % with the acid activated zeolite. In addition, red and yellow color values were higher than the other clays (red color: 2. 6; yellow color: 30). As a result, Eskiehir clay gave a better bleaching performance compared to Ankara clay and Zeolite. Maximum bleaching efficiency was achieved after 30 minutes of contact time with 1 % earth concentration at 100 °C bleaching temperature following 5 N 1 h HCl treatment for Eskiehir clay...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Crambe seed (Crambe abyssinica) is an excellent, {{recently}} established {{source of}} high-erucic acid oil. Erucic acid {{has a number}} of important and potential applications. To de-velop this potential, a rapid bench-scale method was desired whereby purified erucic acid in up to several 100 -g quantities could be produced from crambe seed. Using the method devel-oped, oil was expressed from dried, intact seed; clarified, degummed, and bleached; and saponified and acidified to ob-tain the free fatty acids. Analysis by inductively coupled plasma of the free fatty acids showed negligible levels of phosphorus and most minerals. Erucic acid was twice crystallized from 95 % ethanol at − 14 °C, resulting in a purity of 87. 1 %. This process yielded 365 g erucic acid crystals per kg <b>bleached</b> <b>oil.</b> Nuclear magnetic resonance analysis showed that the prepared erucic acid had an excellent pattern of correlation with a commercial standard. The time needed to convert 1 kg of crambe seed to erucic acid is about 48 h. Crystal filtration and drying stages under the current process conditions require 30 % of the overall time. The method is suitable for producing adequate quantities of erucic acid for use in studies of its bench-scale conversion.

40|$|This {{work has}} been {{initiated}} to assess the feasibility of <b>bleaching</b> cottonseed <b>oil</b> in miscella as a processing step next to alkali refining in miscella. Alkali refining of cottonseed oil in miscella has several advantages over conventional refining technologies with respect to oil quality, oil losses and process cost. Therefore, the process efficiency of the <b>bleaching</b> of cottonseed <b>oil</b> in presence of hexane (at a volumetric ratio of 1 : 1), has been studied and compared to that without solvent. The process efficiency has been evaluated according to the decolourization capacity, the oil losses on spent earth, the filtration rate of the oil from the clay and the acidity of the <b>bleached</b> <b>oil</b> {{as well as its}} peroxide content. The bleaching in presence of hexane was carried out at 25 &# 194;&# 186;C whereas that by conventional bleaching at 110 &# 194;&# 186;C. Different clay loads were used in each of the two bleaching techniques and the colour indices of the oils before and after bleaching determined in each case. The results were used to predict Freundlich adsorption equations for the oil pigments in both cases. These equations were then used to predict the colour of the <b>oils</b> obtained by <b>bleaching</b> of refined <b>oils</b> of different grades. The results have shown that oil decolourization is more efficient in presence of solvent when the starting oil is of an acceptable grade and the reverse is true for low grade oils. Also, the possibility of <b>oil</b> oxidation during <b>bleaching</b> is less in presence of solvent. Moreover, the bleaching in miscella has proved two other additional advantages over conventional bleaching. The filtration of oil from clay is much faster in miscella <b>bleaching</b> and the <b>oil</b> losses on spent earth is lower. This will be reflected on the overall process economy. Este trabajo ha sido iniciado para evaluar la viabilidad de la decoloraci&# 243;n del aceite de semilla de algod&# 243;n en miscela como un paso de procesado pr&# 243;ximo a la refinaci&# 243;n alcalina en miscela. La refinaci&# 243;n alcalina de aceite de semilla de algod&# 243;n en miscela tiene varias ventajas sobre las tecnolog&# 237;as de refinaci&# 243;n convencionales con respecto a la calidad del aceite, p&# 233;rdida de aceite y coste del proceso. Por tanto, la eficacia del proceso de decoloraci&# 243;n de aceite de semilla de algod&# 243;n en presencia de hexano (a una relaci&# 243;n volum&# 233;trica 1 : 1), ha sido estudiada y comparada a aquella sin solvente. La eficacia del proceso ha sido evaluada de acuerdo con la capacidad de decoloraci&# 243;n, las p&# 233;rdidas de aceite en tierras agotadas, la velocidad de filtraci&# 243;n del aceite de la tierra decolorante y la acidez del aceite decolorado as&# 237; como su contenido en per&# 243;xido. La decoloraci&# 243;n en presencia de hexano se llev&# 243; a cabo a 25 &# 194;&# 186;C mientras que la decoloraci&# 243;n convencional a 110 &# 194;&# 186;C. Se utilizaron diferentes cargas de tierras decolorantes en cada una de las dos t&# 233;cnicas de decoloraci&# 243;n y se determinaron los &# 237;ndices de color de los aceites antes y despu&# 233;s de la decoloraci&# 243;n. Los resultados fueron usados para predecir las ecuaciones de adsorci&# 243;n de Freundlich para los pigmentos de los aceites en ambos casos. Estas ecuaciones fueron utilizadas posteriormente para predecir el color de los aceites obtenidos por decoloraci&# 243;n de los aceites refinados de grados diferentes. Los resultados han mostrado que la decoloraci&# 243;n del aceite es m&# 225;s eficaz en presencia de solvente cuando el aceite inicial es de un grado aceptable, y la inversa es verdad para aceites de bajo grado. Tambi&# 233;n, la posibilidad de oxidaci&# 243;n del aceite es menor durante la decoloraci&# 243;n en presencia de solvente. Por otro lado, la decoloraci&# 243;n en miscela ha proporcionado otras dos ventajas adicionales sobre la decoloraci&# 243;n convencional. La filtraci&# 243;n de aceite de la tierra decolorante es m&# 225;s r&# 225;pida en la decoloraci&# 243;n en miscela y las p&# 233;rdidas de aceite sobre las tierras agotadas es baja. Esto se reflejar&# 225; en la econom&# 237;a del proceso global...|$|R
40|$|In this study, clay {{samples were}} {{collected}} in the localities of Bana and Sabga, in the regions {{of the west and}} north-west Cameroon, respectively. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine their mineralogical composition, their physico-chemical properties and to assess their potential use in the bleaching process of palm oil, which is the main edible vegetable oil produced and refined in Cameroon. The results obtained from the analyses (XRD, FTIR, DTA / TGA and SEM) revealed that montmorillonite is the main clay mineral in these materials. It is associated with kaolinite and mica. Non-clay minerals such as quartz, anatase, cristobalite, K-feldspar and heulandite are also identified in variable quantities. Chemical analyses of the major elements show that the clays from Bana and Sabga consist mainly of the follow oxides such as SiO 2, Al 2 O 3 and Fe 2 O 3. Bana clays have a cation exchange capacity (CEC) between 50 and 60 meq/ 100 g and a specific surface area between 50 and 60 m 2 / g. Sabga clays have a lower capacity cation exchange (38 - 46 meq/ 100 g) and a wider range of specific surface area (33 - 90 m 2 / g). The characterization of the natural clays allowed to select of one sample by locality for sulfuric acid treatment. The acid treatment of these materials led to structural, morphological and textural changes. Analysis by X-ray diffraction showed a progressive decrease in the intensity of the (001) reflection of montmorillonite and a shift of its basal d 001 -value. Treatment with more acid concentration causes an increase in the surface area of the obtained products and a decrease in cation exchange capacity. The assessment of the bleaching power of natural and acid-activated Bana clay in palm oil decolorization shows that the activated clay has a high bleaching capacity (~ 87 %) compared to the natural clay (~ 55 %). palm <b>oil</b> <b>Bleaching</b> by these clay materials does not deteriorate the <b>bleached</b> <b>oil.</b> These materials can thus be used as bleaching earths in the refining oil process...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} aimed at {{analyzing}} the physicochemical properties of clay mineral from Nteje after sulphuric acid activation. The clay was grinded to a particle size of 0. 212 mm and reacted with different concentrations of sulphuric acid ranging from 2 – 7 mol/L. The untreated and treated samples were characterized. The adsorptive capacities of the samples were investigated by using them to <b>bleach</b> palm <b>oil.</b> Results of the characterization showed that acid activation modified the chemical composition of the clay mineral. The analyses showed that acid activation caused an exchange of the octahedral cations; Al 3 +, Fe 3 +, and Mg 2 + with H + ions {{which led to the}} modification of the clay crystalline structure and the surface areas of the modified samples were observed to increase to more than three times that of the raw sample. The adsorption results showed that the adsorptive performance of the modified samples was improved over that of the raw sample. The adsorptive capacity increased from 43. 4 % to 92. 5 % (using the 6 mol/L of H 2 SO 4 activated sample). The equilibrium result showed that the adsorption occurred in multi-layer in agreement with Freundlich adsorption isotherm model. This study has shown that the physicochemical properties of Nteje clay were enhanced by acid activation thereby making the clay an effective adsorbent for palm <b>oil</b> <b>bleaching...</b>|$|R

In this study, the most characteristic groups of compounds formed after used frying oil transesterification were analyzed by means of the standard technique using gas chromatography at a high temperature (EN 14105). Dimeric fatty acid methyl esters (dimeric FAME) is the most important group to be considered as they are present in significant amounts after used frying oil transesterification. On the other hand, they are absent in the <b>bleached</b> <b>oils</b> used for biodiesel production. The concentration of the dimeric FAME in the polar fraction of biodiesel, easily obtained by adsorption chromatography, allowed {{detection of}} this group of compounds even in very low concentrations.
