50|$|Centaurea jacea (<b>brown</b> <b>knapweed</b> or brownray knapweed) is {{a species}} of {{herbaceous}} perennial plants in the genus Centaurea native to dry meadows and open woodland throughout Europe. It grows to 10 - 80 cm tall, and flowers mainly from June to September.|$|E
50|$|Botanically, three {{different}} zones can be distinguished: the shore area, the raised bog and {{the slopes of}} the maar basin. In the shore area, as well as the reeds there are communities of yellow iris, white water-lily, yellow loosestrife, purple loosestrife and club-rush. The slopes of the maar basin are dominated by a mix of dry grassland and woodland edge vegetation. In addition to Breckland thyme and oregano, there is restharrow, hare's-foot clover, hop trefoil, narrow-leaved everlasting pea, musk mallow, clustered bellflower, downy hemp-nettle, fox and cubs, <b>brown</b> <b>knapweed,</b> greater knapweed, small scabious, woodruff and large communities of rosebay willow-herb. Neophytes that may be seen include garden lupins and large-flowered mountain trumpets.|$|E
40|$|Morphological {{plasticity}} of <b>brown</b> <b>knapweed</b> (Centaurea jacea L.) was examined. South bohemian {{populations of}} subsp. jacea {{were compared to}} plasticity in larger area. The plasticity of local population overlaps with both subspecies. The correlation between abiotical factors and determination characteristics were found. Molecular survey using ISSR method shows no difference between subspecies. The final resolution of subspecies existence will be questioned in following study...|$|E
40|$|Meadow Knapweed (Centaurea jacea x nigra) is a {{perennial}} plant that grows from a woody root crown. It is a fully fertile hybrid of <b>Brown</b> <b>Knapweed</b> (C. jacea) and Black Knapweed (C. nigra), and individuals can closely resemble either parent or may combine the characteristics randomly. The upright stems range from 20 to 40 inches tall, branching near the middle. Leaves grow to 6 {{inches long and}} 1 inches wide, edges are highly variable, ranging from smooth and entire to having lobes or teeth. Flowers are rose-purple, rising from round heads {{about the size of}} a nickel. Distinctive bracts surround the flower base, papery and rounded or dark and fringed, usually with both characteristics. In Thurston County, flowering can begin as early as May, with peaks in June and July. Flowering can continue into fall, especially on plants that have been mowed or damaged.

40|$|The knapweeds {{comprise}} a diverse complex {{of species that}} predominantly infest rangelands in the western United States and Canada. This manual considers the biological control of six species of knapweeds: 1) spotted knapweed, 2) diffuse knapweed, 3) squarrose knapweed, 4) meadow knapweed, 5) black knapweed, and 6) <b>brown</b> <b>knapweed.</b> Spotted knapweed, Centaurea stoebe, {{is perhaps the most}} widespread species, followed in abundance by diffuse knapweed, C. diffusa. A third species, squarrose knapweed, C. virgata var. squarrosa, has a more limited distribution in the West. Three less widespread species, meadow (C. pratensis), brown (C. jacea) and black knapweed (C. nigra), are host to some of the same biocontrol agents and thus are included. Another well known species is Russian knapweed, Acroptilon repens (formerly known as C. repens). While a serious rangeland weed itself, Russian knapweed is not considered in this manual because it is sufficiently different from the other knapweeds to be considered separately and it has a unique complex of biocontrol agents...|$|E
40|$|Tropospheric ozone is {{a growing}} {{environmental}} menace in Italy and in the whole Mediterranean basin. The importance of active biomonitoring of this pollutant with hypersensitive Bel-W 3 tobacco plants is stressed, and several examples of field studies carried out in Italy with this technique are presented. Current limitations are discussed, with special emphasis on data quality assessment and the opportunity of adopting easy-to-use kits based on tobacco germlings instead of adult plants. A standardization of methodologies (from cultivation to scoring and data elaboration), also at an international level, is strongly felt to be needed, {{in order to get}} official acknowledgement of biomonitoring procedures. Potential educational implications, with the active involvement of students and environmentalists, are shown. Other biological indicators are used, namely sensitive and resistant white clover (Trifolium repens) clones (as descriptors of biomass reduction in crops species) and Centaurea jacea (<b>brown</b> <b>knapweed)</b> as a model species to evaluate the relationship between ozone exposure and effects on the performance and injury symptoms of native plants which are largely used in the framework of European programmes...|$|E
