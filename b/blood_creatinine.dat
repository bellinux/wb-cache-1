Moreover, the coefficients between paired results for blood lead and serum <b>creatinine</b> and <b>blood</b> lead and serum urea nitrogen were positively statistically significant (serum <b>creatinine</b> vs. <b>blood</b> lead, r = 0. 35, p < 0. 05; serum urea nitrogen vs. blood lead, r = 0. 48, p < 0. 05).

50|$|Creatinine {{is removed}} from the blood chiefly by the kidneys, {{primarily}} by glomerular filtration, but also by proximal tubular secretion. Little or no tubular reabsorption of creatinine occurs. If the filtration in the kidney is deficient, creatinine blood levels rise. Therefore, creatinine levels in blood and urine may be used to calculate the creatinine clearance (CrCl), which correlates approximately with the glomerular filtration rate (GFR). <b>Blood</b> <b>creatinine</b> levels may also be used alone to calculate the estimated GFR (eGFR).|$|E
50|$|In pre-renal and post-renal azotemias, {{elevation}} of the BUN exceeds that of the creatinine (i.e., BUN>12*creatinine). This is because BUN is readily absorbed while creatinine is not. In congestive heart failure (a cause of pre-renal azotemia) or any other condition that causes poor perfusion of kidneys, the sluggish flow of glomerular filtrate results in excessive absorption of BUN and {{elevation of}} its value in <b>blood.</b> <b>Creatinine,</b> however, is not absorbable and therefore does not rise significantly.

The preferred initial diagnostic testing is the ECG which will show a 12-lead electrocardiogram with diffuse, non-specific, concave ("saddle-shaped"), ST segment-elevations all leads except aVR and V1 and PR segment-depression possible in any lead except aVR; sinus tachycardia, and low-voltage QRS complexes can also be seen if there is subsymptomatic levels of pericardial effusion.

30|$|In our study, ARF {{occurred}} in 37 % of patients admitted to ICU and 29 % of them required dialysis. In 12 % of the cases, ARF evolved into {{chronic kidney disease}} due to cortical necrosis. The frequency of ARF clearly depends on the cutoff level of <b>blood</b> <b>creatinine</b> used to define renal failure. We chose in our study a cutoff <b>blood</b> <b>creatinine</b> level of 89 μmol/L according to French recommendations [19]. During pregnancy, physiological changes in renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate induce {{a lower level of}} <b>blood</b> <b>creatinine</b> so that cutoff levels of the general population are not reliable. A worldwide definition of criteria in pregnant women could help to better compare studies of ARF. Our study certainly overestimates the incidence of severe cases of ARF as we focalized on an ICU setting. However, an increase in the incidence of severe ARF in developed countries was recently documented in studies from Canada [20]. It might be related to demographic changes such as increased age, obesity, caesarian section [21], incidence of preeclampsia [22] or postpartum hemorrhage, and their treatments. This was also documented in two recent studies in Australia and Canada [23],[24].|$|E
