25|$|Studies {{conducted}} {{among the}} Ghilji reveal strong links between tribal affiliation and {{membership in the}} larger ummah (Islamic community). Afghan historians <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>most</b> Pashtuns are descendants of Qais Abdur Rashid, who is purported {{to have been an}} early convert to Islam and thus bequeathed the faith to the early Pashtun population. The legend says that after Qais heard of the new religion of Islam, he travelled to meet Muhammad in Medina and returned to Afghanistan as a Muslim. He purportedly had four children: Sarban, Batan, Ghourghusht and Karlan. Before the Islamization of their territory, the Pashtuns likely followed various religions. Some may have been Buddhists while others Zoroastians, worshippers of the sun, or worshippers of Nana, with some probably being animists, shamanists and Jews. However, there is no conclusive evidence to these theories {{other than the fact that}} these were the religions practiced by the people in this region before the arrival of Islam in the 7th century.|$|E
500|$|In total, 31 {{people are}} known to have been killed by the {{hurricane}} in the Cedar Keys, mostly on the exposed outer islands; very few casualties were reported on Cedar Key itself. Immediately after the storm, there were unconfirmed reports that an entire fleet of sponge diving boats sank near the Cedar Keys, leading to the deaths of some 700 men. Only a few bodies of sponge divers were recovered, and modern historians <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>most</b> of the vessels actually rode out the storm in sheltered parts of the island chain. When news of the disaster in the Cedar Keys reached the mainland, many less damaged communities in Florida and Georgia formed relief groups to collect donations for storm victims. Answering pleas to [...] "feed the hungry, clothe the naked, and provide shelter for the homeless," [...] Jacksonville sent thousands of dollars in aid, while Albany residents donated [...] of emergency supplies within days of the storm. Henry Flagler pledged a donation of $1,000. By the end of October, the Jacksonville relief committee turned its focus to distributing goods and provisions instead of money, shipping hundreds of barrels of nails—highly sought-after for rebuilding efforts—to the hardest-hit areas.|$|E

2500|$|Kierkegaard was {{interested}} in aesthetics, and is {{sometimes referred to as}} the [...] "poet-philosopher" [...] because of the passionate way in which he approached philosophy. But he is often said to be interested in showing the inadequacy of a life lived entirely in the aesthetic level. Aesthetic life is defined in numerous different ways in Kierkegaard's authorship, including a life defined by intellectual enjoyment, sensuous desire, and an inclination to interpret oneself as if one were [...] "on stage." [...] There are many degrees of this aesthetic existence and a single definition is thus difficult to offer. At bottom, one might see the purely unreflective lifestyle. At the top, we might find those lives which are lived in a reflective, independent, critical and socially apathetic way. But many interpreters of Kierkegaard <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>most</b> people live in the least reflective sort of aesthetic stage, their lives and activities guided by everyday tasks and concerns. Fewer aesthetically guided people are the reflective sort. Whether such people know it or not, their lives will inevitably lead to complete despair. Kierkegaard's author A is an example of an individual living the aesthetic life.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1835 Philadelphia Navy Yard shipwrights, joiners and other workers became leaders in this effort when they chose to combine direct action, a {{threatened}} strike, with political pressure to the executive branch. After first making a request to the Secretary of the Navy via shipyard Commandant Commodore James Barron, on 29 August 1835 they appealed directly to President Andrew Jackson. Commodore Barron endorsed his workers request with the following acknowledgment [...] "I would respectfully observe – Seems to be inevitable, sooner or later, for as the working man are seconded by all the Master workmen, city councils etc. there is no probability they will secede from their demands." [...] Their petition was granted and on 31 August 1835 the president ordered the Secretary of the Navy to grant the ten hour work day effective 3 September 1835. However, the change was only applicable to the Philadelphia Navy Yard. News of these events at Philadelphia Navy Yard was widely circulated in Washington D.C. Lastly Commodore Isaac Hull, WNY Commandant 1829 - 1835, was unpopular with navy yard civilian workforce and frequently had difficulties with employees. Many of the workers felt Hull often treated them with [...] "silent contempt" [...] which was probably {{the result of his}} deafness." [...] Hull for his part came to <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>most</b> navy yard mechanics were overpaid and under worked.
