5|$|Aqueous {{extracts}} of {{the fruit}} bodies contain polysaccharides that have been shown in laboratory tests to <b>be</b> <b>highly</b> efficient at inhibiting infection by tobacco mosaic virus. Several bioactive compounds have been isolated and identified from the mushroom, including allitol, stearic acid, furan-3-carboxylic acid, (22E,24R)-3β-hydroxyergosta-5,22-diene, 3β-hydroxy-5α,8α-epidioxy-24ξ-methylcholesta-6-ene, dihydrofuran-2,5-dione,3β-hydroxy-5α,8α-epidioxyergosta-6,22-diene, palmitic acid, uracil, cis-butenedioic acid, thioacetic anhydride, succinic acid, 1-ethylic-βD-glycoside, 2-acetamino-2-deoxy-β-D-glucose, and cerebrosideB.|$|E

5|$|In {{the post-war}} period Scotland {{continued}} to produce important architects, including James Stirling (1926–92), who, with James Gowan (1923–) designed the Flats at Ham Common, London (1955–58), considered a landmark {{in the development}} of modernist, brutalist residential planning, a style which would have a profound impact in Scotland. Their later work, almost all of it outside Scotland, would <b>be</b> <b>highly</b> influential on an international scale.|$|E
5|$|Labradors have a {{well-known}} reputation for appetite, and some individuals may <b>be</b> <b>highly</b> indiscriminate, eating digestible and non-food objects alike. They are persistent and persuasive in requesting food. For this reason, the Labrador owner must carefully control their dog's food intake to avoid obesity {{and its associated}} health problems (see below).|$|E

5|$|Louisiana {{attempted}} {{to pass a}} law that would exempt fantasy sports from its anti-online gambling laws, but the bill was defeated as the result of lobbying by both the Louisiana Family Forum (which showed concerns that players could develop an addiction to daily fantasy games), and the Louisiana Video Gaming Association (which felt that DFS would cannibalize the legal video poker industry, and needed to <b>be</b> <b>highly</b> regulated).|$|E
5|$|Phytophthora cinnamomi dieback has {{not been}} {{identified}} as a threat to this species, but testing has found it to <b>be</b> <b>highly</b> susceptible; in one study it exhibited the highest susceptibility of 49 Banksia species studied, with 80% of plants dead within 96days of inoculation with the disease, and 100% dead within a year.|$|E
5|$|RAF night fighter defences {{were still}} in their infancy. Most fighters lacked radar and in any case, radar was {{short-range}} and unreliable. Instead, they flew outside the anti-aircraft guns' fields of fire on likely approach routes using the pilots' vision to locate enemy aircraft. In later years, the night fighter defences would <b>be</b> <b>highly</b> sophisticated. But in 1940, they were not effective. Just 28 sorties were flown against the nocturnal raids.|$|E
50|$|Chlorine gas <b>is</b> <b>highly</b> toxic. Breathing in {{chlorine}} at {{a concentration}} of 3 parts per million can rapidly cause a toxic reaction. Breathing in chlorine at {{a concentration of}} 50 parts per million <b>is</b> <b>highly</b> dangerous. Breathing in chlorine at a concentration of 500 parts per million {{for a few minutes}} is lethal. Breathing in chlorine gas <b>is</b> <b>highly</b> painful. Hydrochloric acid is a dangerous chemical.|$|R

Both the suppressing and the stimulatory effect of E. microtheca were noticed on radicle and plumule growth and seed germination of Pennisetum glaucum (L) R. Br. cv. BARI-Hairy. The toxicity and stimulation varied from part to part. Exudates from fresh roots <b>were</b> <b>highly</b> toxic while whole plant exudates <b>were</b> <b>highly</b> exhilarating for the radicle growth. For plumule growth, whole plant extract <b>was</b> <b>highly</b> toxic and stem extracts <b>were</b> <b>highly</b> enhancing.

5|$|Rather than {{requiring}} all desired functionality to be {{built into}} the language's core, Python was designed to <b>be</b> <b>highly</b> extensible. Python can also be embedded in existing applications that need a programmable interface. This design of a small core language with a large standard library and an easily extensible interpreter was intended by Van Rossum from the start because of his frustrations with ABC, which espoused the opposite mindset.|$|E
5|$|Sharks can <b>be</b> <b>highly</b> social, {{remaining}} in large schools. Sometimes more than 100 scalloped hammerheads congregate around seamounts and islands, e.g., in the Gulf of California. Cross-species social hierarchies exist. For example, oceanic whitetip sharks dominate silky sharks of comparable size during feeding.|$|E
5|$|The LCS also lacked {{knowledge}} of MI5's Double-Cross System and its double agents. The department were unaware that no uncontrolled German operatives {{were active in}} the UK, and so incorrectly believed any deception would have to <b>be</b> <b>highly</b> realistic to appear genuine.|$|E

50|$|When given intravenously, {{detomidine}} {{usually takes}} effect in 2-5 minutes, and recovery is full within 30-60 minutes. However, this <b>is</b> <b>highly</b> {{dependent upon the}} dosage, environment, and the individual animal; some horses <b>are</b> <b>highly</b> resistant to sedation.|$|R
50|$|As {{some other}} pufferfish, some organs of the Japanese puffer contain {{tetrodotoxin}} and <b>are</b> <b>highly</b> toxic. The toxin <b>is</b> <b>highly</b> concentrated in liver and ovaries, slightly {{present in the}} intestines and flesh, and absent from skin and testes.|$|R
5|$|The {{first section}} of the {{alimentary}} canal is the foregut (element 27 in numbered diagram), or stomodaeum. The foregut is lined with a cuticular lining made of chitin and proteins as protection from tough food. The foregut includes the buccal cavity (mouth), pharynx, esophagus and crop and proventriculus (any part may <b>be</b> <b>highly</b> modified), which both store food and signify when to continue passing onward to the midgut.|$|E
5|$|The {{presidency}} of Taraki, albeit short-lived, was always marked by controversies. Taraki launched a land reform on 1 January 1979 which proved to <b>be</b> <b>highly</b> unpopular and, {{along with his}} government's other reforms, led to a popular backlash which initiated the Afghan civil war. Despite repeated attempts throughout his reign, Taraki proved unable to persuade the Soviet Union to intervene {{in support of the}} restoration of civil order.|$|E
5|$|The {{sophistication of}} the active site network causes {{residues}} involved in catalysis (and residues in contact with these) to <b>be</b> <b>highly</b> evolutionarily conserved. However, there are examples of divergent evolution in catalytic triads, both in the reaction catalysed, and the residues used in catalysis. The triad remains {{the core of the}} active site, but it is evolutionarily adapted to serve different functions.|$|E
50|$|Alleles which <b>are</b> <b>highly</b> {{penetrant}} <b>are</b> {{more likely}} to be noticed by clinicians and geneticists, and alleles for symptoms which <b>are</b> <b>highly</b> heritable <b>are</b> {{more likely to}} be inferred to exist, and then are more easily tracked down.|$|R
50|$|Rieke metals <b>are</b> <b>highly</b> {{reactive}} metal powders {{prepared by the}} methods developed by Reuben D. Rieke. Rieke metals <b>are</b> <b>highly</b> reactive because they have high surface area and lack surface oxides that can retard reaction of bulk materials.|$|R
5000|$|Superabundant {{numbers are}} closely related to highly {{composite}} numbers. Not all superabundant numbers <b>are</b> <b>highly</b> composite numbers.
