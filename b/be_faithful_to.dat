5|$|The {{history of}} Antoinism {{was very quiet}} after 1940. In Belgium, Joseph Nihoul, the President of the Antoinist Council, then his successors, led the {{religion}} until their death, alongside {{the members of this}} body. The authority of Catherine was challenged just after her death by the Belgian branch of the movement, which has withdrawn the religious changes she made: removal of photographs in the temples, deletion of baptism, marriage and communion, opposition to the translation of Antoine's works... However, a Belgian group who, claiming to <b>be</b> <b>faithful</b> <b>to</b> the true Antoinist tradition, opened a temple in Angleur on 1 April 1943, preferred to keep the portraits of the Antoines in the temple. In France, the Antoinists wanted to <b>be</b> <b>faithful</b> <b>to</b> all requirements provided by the founding couple. In spite of these differences, the two branches show each other support and tolerance. Thus, after the death of Catherine, there were two forms of Antoinism, which still remain different today: one in Belgium, and one in France.|$|E
5|$|Susanna's (Priyanka Chopra) first husband—Edwin Rodriques (Neil Nitin Mukesh), an army major—is overbearing, jealous and possessive. Disabled, he cannot {{believe that}} a {{beautiful}} woman like Susanna would <b>be</b> <b>faithful</b> <b>to</b> him. Uncertain of his sexual potency, he takes out his anger on his wife. Although Susanna endures his mental cruelty, she cannot forgive Edwin for blinding her faithful, mute stableboy (Shashi Malviya) with a whip. Edwin is eliminated during a panther-hunting trip {{with the help of}} Susanna's faithful maid (Usha Uthup), butler (Harish Khanna) and the mute stableboy.|$|E

5|$|His {{works on}} Shakespeare were devoted {{not merely to}} Shakespeare, but to {{understanding}} literature as a whole; in his Preface to Shakespeare, Johnson rejects the previous dogma of the classical unities and argues that drama should <b>be</b> <b>faithful</b> <b>to</b> life. However, Johnson did not only defend Shakespeare; he discussed Shakespeare's faults, including his lack of morality, his vulgarity, his carelessness in crafting plots, and his occasional inattentiveness when choosing words or word order. As well as direct literary criticism, Johnson emphasised the need to establish a text that accurately reflects what an author wrote. Shakespeare's plays, in particular, had multiple editions, each of which contained errors caused by the printing process. This problem was compounded by careless editors who deemed difficult words incorrect, and changed them in later editions. Johnson believed that an editor should not alter the text in such a way.|$|E
5|$|In Sorceria, {{the party}} learns {{that this is}} Ashlynn's home. The elders tell Ashlynn that the Demon Lord is {{watching}} her and give her the powerful spell Magic Burst to fight him. The party also learns {{that the only way}} to get to the Demon Lord is through Zenith Tower, but to activate the tower, they need to collect the sword, armor, shield, and helmet of legend. While doing so, the Hero meets his double in Real Weaver's Peak, who gets spooked, and speaks 'Y-You. Y-You're m-m-me!', and says that he must prove himself to <b>be</b> <b>faithful</b> <b>to</b> his family if he is to join powers. Returning to Real Somnia, the King and Queen tell the Hero that he is indeed the prince. When he fused with his clone, the Hero gained his memory back, much like Ashlynn and Carver had done.|$|E
5|$|During {{a camping}} trip, O'Malley learns that Torres has slept with chief of plastic surgery Mark Sloan (Eric Dane), and also discovers that Burke is {{experiencing}} tremors in his hand. When O'Malley's father is diagnosed with esophageal cancer and a leaking aortic valve, {{he refuses to}} allow Burke to operate on him, instead contacting Erica Hahn (Brooke Smith), Burke's medical school rival. His relationship with Torres is strained when he confronts her about sleeping with Sloan, but he allows her to support him through his father's deteriorating health. Complications from his father's surgery leave him in multi-system organ failure, and his life support is turned off. In an attempt to overcome his grief, O'Malley elopes with Callie to Las Vegas. He later begins to feel that he was mistaken to marry her, and sleeps with Stevens while intoxicated. Stevens confesses that she {{is in love with}} him, so O'Malley considers transferring to a different hospital so he can <b>be</b> <b>faithful</b> <b>to</b> his wife. However, he is ineligible to transfer after failing the intern exams. O'Malley decides to repeat his intern year, and confesses to Torres that he slept with Stevens, leading the two to separate. O'Malley and Stevens embark on a short-lived relationship, only to discover there is no real chemistry between them.|$|E

25|$|From 1952 until 1962 Dijkstra {{worked at}} the Mathematisch Centrum in Amsterdam, where he worked closely with Bram Jan Loopstra and Carel S. Scholten, who had been hired to build a computer. Their mode of {{interaction}} was disciplined: They would first decide upon the interface between the hardware and the software, by writing a programming manual. Then the hardware designers would have to <b>be</b> <b>faithful</b> <b>to</b> their part of the contract, while Dijkstra, the programmer, would write software for the nonexistent machine. Two of the lessons he learned from this experience were the importance of clear documentation, and that program debugging can be largely avoided through careful design.|$|E
25|$|However, the {{judiciary}} {{has used its}} power to adjudge executive actions and Acts of Parliament unconstitutional and void rather sparingly. To date, the only instance where the High Court struck down a statutory provision was in Taw Cheng Kong v. Public Prosecutor (1998). It was short-lived, as the decision was later overturned by the Court of Appeal. Delivering the Court's judgment, Chief Justice Yong Pung How emphasized the limits of judicial review, stating {{that it is not}} for the courts to dictate the scope and ambit of a section or rule on its propriety. This is a matter which only Parliament can decide, and the courts can only interpret what is enacted. This results in a conflict between the court's responsibility to <b>be</b> <b>faithful</b> <b>to</b> the Constitution, and its apparently restricted role in reviewing legislation.|$|E
25|$|So far as {{politics}} was concerned, Lilburne {{for the next}} two years remained quiet. He was elected on 21 December 1649 a common councilman for the city of London, but on the 26th his election was declared void by Parliament, although he had taken the required oath to <b>be</b> <b>faithful</b> <b>to</b> the commonwealth. No disposition, however, was shown to persecute him. On 22 December 1648 he had obtained an ordinance granting him £3,000, in compensation for his sufferings, from the Star Chamber, the money being made payable from the forfeited estates of various Royalists in the county of Durham. As this source had proved insufficient, Lilburne, by the aid of Marten and Cromwell, obtained another ordinance (30 July 1650), charging the remainder of the sum on confiscated chapter-lands, and thus became owner of some of the lands of the Durham chapter.|$|E

25|$|In {{the first}} person, as if quoting himself, William speaks {{about how his}} {{disagreement}} with his king troubles him; he tries to <b>be</b> <b>faithful</b> <b>to</b> his king, but he is above all faithful to his conscience: to serve God and the Dutch people. Therefore, the last two lines of the first stanza, indicate that {{the leader of the}} Dutch civil war against the Spanish Empire of which they were part, had no specific quarrel with king Philip II of Spain, but rather with his emissaries in the Low Countries, like Fernando Álvarez de Toledo, 3rd Duke of Alba. This may have been because at the time (late 16th century) it was uncommon to publicly doubt the Divine Right of Kings, who was accountable to God alone. In 1581 the Netherlands nevertheless rejected the legitimacy of the king of Spain's rule over it in the Act of Abjuration.|$|E
25|$|After {{the battle}} of Worcester (September 1651) Hollinworth {{was one of the}} Lancashire ministers who were arrested on a charge of being engaged in Christopher Love's plot against the government: others were Heyrick and John Angier. He was {{released}} after a short imprisonment, having been held in Liverpool with Angier, John Harrison and William Meek; and returned to Manchester. Hollinworth was a prominent figure at a meeting held at Warrington to consider the question of taking the oath called the Engagement, requiring the people to <b>be</b> <b>faithful</b> <b>to</b> the Commonwealth. In the Manchester classis he generally acted as moderator during Heyrick's absence. He was named in the parliamentary ordinance of 29 August 1654 as a commissioner for ejecting scandalous and ignorant ministers and schoolmasters in Lancashire. When Humphrey Chetham drew up his will for the foundation of what now is Chetham's Library, he nominated Hollinworth one of his feoffees.|$|E
25|$|The {{second season}} premiered on September 25, 2005, and its central mystery {{is that of}} new {{neighbor}} Betty Applewhite (Alfre Woodard), who moved onto Wisteria Lane {{in the middle of}} the night.

She deals with her daughter Danielle's new romance with Matthew AppleWhite. Susan's love life becomes even more complicated as her ex-husband Karl Mayer (Richard Burgi) is engaged to Edie and has also started to lean towards Susan. Lynette goes back to her career in advertising while her husband Tom Scavo (Doug Savant) becomes a stay-at-home father, and Gabrielle decides to <b>be</b> <b>faithful</b> <b>to</b> Carlos, and begins preparations to have a child.
