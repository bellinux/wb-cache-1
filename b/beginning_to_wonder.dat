25|$|As {{a matter}} of course in the Royal Navy, all captains who lost ships were tried by Courts-Martial. And so Belcher was tried by court-martial for abandoning the four {{seaworthy}} vessels, as were Resolutes captain, Henry Kellett; Intrepid 's commander, Francis Leopold McClintock; and Pioneer 's commander, Sherard Osborn. All were acquitted. Belcher, however, never received another commission and was scorned by the officers of his Court-Martial when they returned his sword to him in complete silence. Resolute continued to move slowly eastward in the pack ice, and one year later in the autumn of 1855 she was 1200 miles away from the place where she had been abandoned. In September 1855 an American whaler named James Buddington, from New London, CT saw Resolute adrift in the pack ice off Cape Walsingham in Davis Strait. He split his crew and sailed her back to New London, arriving home on Christmas Eve. Buddington's ship, George Henry, had preceded Resolute, and many were <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>wonder</b> if Buddington was still alive. The British government waived all claims to the ship upon learning of its arrival in New London.|$|E

[...] AllMusic's Thom Jurek awarded the album {{three and a half}} stars, saying, [...] "In many ways it could be Reign In Blood Revisited… Some compositions on this new recording have more of the band's early–style melody in them, with lightning flare–up riffs between verses: quick unexpected guitar pyrotechnics; and blast beat power drumming from Dave Lombardo pushing it all into red." ...|$|E

500|$|Christopher Stevens, who {{reviewed}} [...] "La Couchette" [...] alongside [...] in the Daily Mail, {{speculated that}} there may have been a degree of political satire in episode. He noted that Inside No. 9 storylines [...] "were never meant to be topical satires, but we're so steeped in electioneering that everything is starting to look like political comment now". He compared the character of Hugo, a [...] "public school chancer ... with a breezy nonchalance and an answer for everything", to David Cameron, and the character of Maxwell, [...] "the uptight little man with the funny voice ... who had committed murder to win his comfy berth and was now <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>wonder</b> if he’d made a mistake", to Ed Miliband. Stevens claimed that Inside No. 9 [...] "is bizarre enough for any interpretation".|$|E
