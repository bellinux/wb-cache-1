500|$|Surface {{displacement}} {{during the}} earthquake {{was measured using}} SAR interferometry. The computed area of uplift is elongated W-E, with a maximum value of about [...] centered over {{the eastern end of}} the Latif anticline. A smaller area of subsidence was observed to the south of the uplifted area, and the lack of a sharp boundary between the two suggests that the fault does not come to the surface. The pattern of displacement is consistent with a north-dipping fault rupturing between about [...] and [...] in depth, which also provides a good match to the results of seismic modeling using <b>body</b> <b>waves,</b> although a SSE-dipping plane remains possible. This depth range strongly suggests that the fault affected {{the lower part of the}} sedimentary cover, while not ruling out some basement involvement. The mismatch between the orientation of the fault planes that caused the earthquake and the observed surface folds suggests that deformation at these two levels is decoupled by the presence of a detachment, possibly within marl layers.|$|E

2500|$|Aesthetic Group Gymnastics (AGG) was {{developed}} from the Finnish [...] "naisvoimistelu". It differs from Rhythmic Gymnastics in that body movement is large and continuous and teams are larger. Athletes do not use apparatus in international AGG competitions compared to Rhythmic Gymnastics where ball, ribbon, hoop and clubs are used on the floor area. The sport requires physical qualities such as flexibility, balance, speed, strength, coordination and sense of rhythm where movements of the body are emphasized through the flow, expression and aesthetic appeal. A good performance is characterized by uniformity and simultaneity. The competition program consists of versatile and varied body movements, such as <b>body</b> <b>waves,</b> swings, balances, pivots, jumps and leaps, dance steps, and lifts. The International Federation of Aesthetic Group Gymnastics (IFAGG) was established in 2003.|$|E

The P-wave is a type of <b>body</b> <b>wave</b> that is capable of traveling through the earth at a velocity of around 5 to 8 km/s, and is the first wave from an earthquake to reach a seismometer.

Anderson & Hart (1976) have recently presented an earth model based on {{a large body of}} free oscillation and travel time data.

40|$|Graduation date: 1965 The first {{cycle of}} seismic waves {{recorded}} at distances of 45, 300 and 355 km. from the GNOME nuclear explosion {{was used to}} determine whether the near source wave characteristics at 0. 3 km. could be determined from distance measurements. Both head <b>wave</b> and <b>body</b> <b>wave</b> propagation were considered. First the recorded signals at distance were inversely propagated back to the near source region as head waves, and secondly, the measured source at 0. 3 km. was propagated out to 300 km. from the source as a <b>body</b> <b>wave.</b> In both cases, restricted comparisons between theory and observation can be made, but the comparison appears to favor the <b>body</b> <b>wave</b> type of propagation. More research is needed to make a more conclusive choice between the two modes of propagation.

40|$|Experiments {{studying}} {{the propagation of}} acoustical pulses above a model surface are described. Under appropriate conditions, sound waves traveling in the horizontal direction above an impedance plane consist of a <b>body</b> <b>wave</b> and a surface <b>wave.</b> The <b>body</b> <b>wave</b> propagates {{at the speed of}} sound in air c while the surface wave is characterized by phase velocity nu<c and an amplitude that decreases exponentially with vertical height above the surface. Calculations of acoustical pulses propagating above an idealized impedance plane confirm these characteristics and show the surface wave as a distinct arrival from the <b>body</b> <b>wave.</b> Measurements have been made of pulses generated from a point source above a model surface consisting of a square lattice of cavities.

50|$|ULVZs are {{discovered}} by the delay and scattering of <b>body</b> <b>waves</b> that reflect and diffract on or are refracted by the core-mantle boundary. Different <b>body</b> <b>waves</b> types give different constraints on the dimensions or velocity contrasts of the ULVZ. Even though ULVZs {{are discovered}} in places, it remains difficult to map out their extent and constrain their density and velocity. Usually trade-offs between various parameters exist. In general though, ULVZs {{appear to be a}} hundred to a thousand kilometers across and tens of kilometers thick (although existing thinner or smaller ULVZs might fall below the resolution of seismology). Their shear wave velocity reduction is on the order of -10 to -30% and the compressional wave velocity reduction tends to be weaker.|$|E
