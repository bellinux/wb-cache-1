5|$|After {{the first}} month, {{the actual number}} of {{passengers}} was 125,971, compared to the predicted annual total of around 650,000 return journeys, i.e. 1.3m single journeys. By 23 January 2016, 537,327 passengers had been carried on the line with weekly figures consistently showing over 20,000 journeys made. Figures released on 31 May 2016 showed that 694,373 persons had been carried since 6 September 2015, an increase of 22% <b>by</b> <b>reference</b> to the predicted patronage. Tweedbank station saw 183,918 journeys compared to a predicted 18,978, while Galashiels had 104,593 trips against a predicted 20,567. However, Eskbank, Gorebridge and Shawfair recorded less than their predicted usage. In September 2016, it was announced that one million passengers had been carried on the reopened line.|$|E
5|$|As of 2014 the {{kilogram}} was {{the only}} SI unit still defined by an artifact. In 1960 the metre having previously also been defined <b>by</b> <b>reference</b> to an artifact (a single platinum-iridium bar with two marks on it) was redefined in terms of invariant, fundamental physical constants (the wavelength of a particular emission of light emitted by krypton, and later the speed of light) so that the standard can be reproduced in different laboratories by following a written specification. At the 94th Meeting of the International Committee for Weights and Measures (CIPM) (2005) it was recommended that the same {{be done with the}} kilogram.|$|E
40|$|Objective – This study {{evaluates the}} {{effectiveness}} of the related search functions in Web of Science and Scopus. Web of Science has one related search function (searching <b>by</b> <b>references)</b> whereas Scopus has three related search functions (searching <b>by</b> <b>references,</b> authors, or keywords). Methods – Thirty queries were searched in both Web of Science and Scopus. For each query, the most relevant document was retrieved and its first thirty related documents were assessed for relevancy to the original query. Results for both databases were compared using the median values of precision. For Scopus the three different methods of relevance were compared using median precision values. Results – The median precision value for the related documents retrieved from Web of Science was 0. 63, while the median for those retrieved from Scopus using the related <b>by</b> <b>references</b> function was 0. 62. A Wilcoxon test showed {{no significant difference in the}} two medians. In the comparison of the three related functions in Scopus, the median precision values were 0. 62, 0. 42, and 0. 43 for the related search functions <b>by</b> <b>references,</b> authors, and keywords respectively. A Friedman’s test showed that the median precision value for relatedness <b>by</b> <b>references</b> was significantly higher than the median vales for the other two related functions. In Scopus, {{the effectiveness of}} the related search function using all keywords was not as effective when compared to the effectiveness using select keywords. The median precision value with select keywords was 0. 17. Conclusions – The related search functions <b>by</b> <b>references</b> for both Web of Science and Scopus were moderately effective in retrieving additional relevant documents on a given topic, and there was no significant difference in their performance. When comparing the three methods available in Scopus, the related search function <b>by</b> <b>references</b> was found to be more effective than the system’s related functions by authors and keywords...|$|R

5|$|Astrology, in its {{broadest}} sense, is {{the search}} for meaning in the sky. Early evidence for humans making conscious attempts to measure, record, and predict seasonal changes <b>by</b> <b>reference</b> to astronomical cycles, appears as markings on bones and cave walls, which show that lunar cycles were being noted as early as 25,000 years ago. This was a first step towards recording the Moon's influence upon tides and rivers, and towards organising a communal calendar. Farmers addressed agricultural needs with increasing knowledge of the constellations that appear in the different seasons—and used the rising of particular star-groups to herald annual floods or seasonal activities. By the 3rd millennium BCE, civilisations had sophisticated awareness of celestial cycles, and may have oriented temples in alignment with heliacal risings of the stars.|$|E
5|$|In {{opposition}} to the formal theories of the generative school, functional theories of language propose that since language is fundamentally a tool, its structures are best analyzed and understood <b>by</b> <b>reference</b> to their functions. Formal theories of grammar seek to define the different elements of language and describe the way they {{relate to each other}} as systems of formal rules or operations, while functional theories seek to define the functions performed by language and then relate them to the linguistic elements that carry them out. The framework of cognitive linguistics interprets language in terms of the concepts (which are sometimes universal, and sometimes specific to a particular language) which underlie its forms. Cognitive linguistics is primarily concerned with how the mind creates meaning through language.|$|E
5|$|The J. W. Long Law Library has 296,000 volumes and {{microform}} equivalents, {{which include}} {{both state and}} federal primary law sources, as well as treatises, periodicals and other secondary legal sources.

Additionally, it has special collections in tax law, public international law, and labor law, and it is a Selective Federal Government Documents Depository. Members of the public may access the library when the library is staffed by librarians. Law students also have access to Willamette University's Mark O.

5|$|There are {{a number}} of {{different}} measures of adult attachment, the most common being self-report questionnaires and coded interviews based on the Adult Attachment Interview. The various measures were developed primarily as research tools, for different purposes and addressing different domains, for example romantic relationships, parental relationships or peer relationships. Some classify an adult's state of mind with respect to attachment and attachment patterns <b>by</b> <b>reference</b> to childhood experiences, while others assess relationship behaviours and security regarding parents and peers.|$|E
5|$|This revised {{proposal}} was continued in a further white paper in March 1970, although this {{proposed that the}} counties be unitary authorities which would have no district councils below them. The incoming Conservative government resurrected two-tier local government in a consultative document published in February 1971, again with the same upper-tier boundaries. Some minor changes having been made to the existing county boundaries due to special local factors, the Local Government Act 1972 duly created Clwyd as a merger of Flintshire with most of Denbighshire, along with the Edeyrnion Rural District from Merionethshire. The 1970 white paper had introduced the name of Clwyd <b>by</b> <b>reference</b> to the River Clwyd and the Clwydian range of hills; Clwyd was the only new Welsh county which did not take its name from an ancient kingdom.|$|E

5|$|The {{official}} {{investigation was}} carried out by the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB, precursor to the NTSB). It emerged that pilot Roger Peterson had over four years of flying experience, of which one with Dwyer Flying Service, and had accumulated 711 flying hours, of which 128 on Bonanzas. He had also logged 52 hours of instrument flying training, although had passed only his written examination, and was not yet qualified to operate in weather that required flying solely <b>by</b> <b>reference</b> to instruments. He and Dwyer Flying Service itself were certified to operate only under visual flight rules, which essentially require that the pilot must be able to see where he is going. However, {{on the night of the}} accident, visual flight would have been virtually impossible due to the low clouds, the lack of a visible horizon, and the absence of ground lights over the sparsely populated area.|$|E
5|$|This is a concise work, {{in terms}} of its duration, the economy of {{thematic}} material presented, and also the narrow registers within which the four parts operate. The first movement is in 6/8 time and a monothematic sonata form. The development and recapitulation sections feature an example of Haydn's musical jokes. In this case he tinkers with the movement's sonata form <b>by</b> <b>reference</b> to an historical variation of it. The recapitulation starts only with a statement of the second phrase of the movement's theme, which is in the dominant. This would have been a common technique earlier in the eighteenth century that, in this instance, is liable to confuse the unknowing listener looking for the statement of the first phrase of the theme in the tonic. It is not until 27 measures later that the listener is presented with a more emphatic reprise, which is actually a coda. The coda involves the statement of the main theme in the tonic that the listener might have been expecting, and it does so after two measures of pointed silence.|$|E
