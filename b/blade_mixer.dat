40|$|This {{research}} project examined {{the feasibility of}} using a cavity transfer mixer (CTM) as a continuous reactor to perform reactions between either solid or liquid reagents and polymer melt; reactions which have previously been typically carried out in batch reactor systems. Equipment has been developed to allow uniform and reproducible introduction of reagents into the polymer melt. Reactions have also been performed using batch processing equipment to enable comparison {{with the performance of}} the CTM. It was concluded that: a) there are certain reactions which cannot be carried out in a CTM, but which can be performed in a batch system such as a mill or a sigma <b>blade</b> <b>mixer.</b> This was found to be the case for some neutralisation reactions where the product was quasi crosslinked. b) the reactions that can be carried out in a CTM are performed more efficiently in a CTM than on a batch process. For example, when monomers were to be grafted onto polymers, this was more safely and efficiently performed in the CTM than in a mill or a sigma <b>blade</b> <b>mixer.</b> Residence time distributions (RTDs) for three CTMs were studied in order to gain an insight into the effect of CTM geometry on RTD, polymer melt flow pattern and reactor performance. A mathematical model has been developed to predict the influence of process parameters on RTD and the results compared with experimentally observed trends. The comparison was good. A programme of research has been drawn up to form the basis of an industrially based sponsored development project of the CTM reactor.

40|$|International audienceSince tens of years, sulphur {{is a very}} {{classical}} additive in {{the composition}} of black ceramics because, if added in small amounts (i. e., less than 10 wt. % of the binder), it improves their mechanical properties without strongly degrading their graphitability and their conductivity. Macroscopic properties of black ceramics strongly depend {{on the quality of the}} interfaces between grains of solid filler (graphite, carbon black) and coke originating from the pyrolysis of the binder; thus, the binder should correctly wet the filler prior to the carbonisation process. Coal-tar pitch usually exhibits a high affinity for carbon grains. In the present work, the effect of the amount of sulphur on the viscosity of the molten binder and on the way it wets the solid filler was investigated. For that purpose, the penetration of mixtures of coal-tar pitch and sulphur inside a bed of carbon particles was studied as a function of temperature. The influence of the sulphur content on composition, optical texture, and transport properties of the derived black ceramics, as well as the way it was mixed with the other constituents, were also examined. It was found that the preparation of black ceramics may be achieved easily and in safe conditions, without evolution of H 2 S, using pitch–sulphur mixtures first molten in a <b>bladed</b> <b>mixer,</b> and having sulphur contents within the range 10 – 20 wt. %. The presence of sulphur increases the coke yield but lowers the ability to graphitise, thus limiting the transport properties of the resultant black ceramic.

40|$|Experiments of bulk solid mixing in a twin ribbon blade blender {{have been}} {{performed}} in this work in order to characterize mixing behavior in such a mixer for binary mixtures with different cohesionless materials. The effects of fill height and blade rotation speed on mixing homogeneity have been studied. Mixing homogeneity was determined by sampling. It has been observed that mixing is relatively fast towards a final mixing state within approximately 100 blade rotations for different combinations of material, fill height and blade rotational speed. Moreover, these final mixing states seemed stable within a range of fluctuations, which may prove useful in determining an optimal mixing time for binary, cohesionless particle mixtures and potentially lead {{to a reduction in}} the required number of blade rotations in mixers of this type in industry. Mixing homogeneity results indicated an increased final mixing homogeneity for increasing fill height, most clearly in the range of 30 – 70 vol. % in the studied twin ribbon <b>blade</b> <b>mixer.</b> The torque on one of the shafts was determined.

The parameters can be considered a suitable tool to score and select processes using rich lignocelluloses materials. The first efficiency (x) takes into account the quantity of energy that the process is able to extract as hydrogen, compared to the available amount of energy embedded in the refuse; the second efficacy (h) compares the {{energy conversion}} efficiency of the bioprocess using the refuse with the same energy conversion parameter obtained using glucose as a lignin-cellulose free substrate.

40|$|Carbon {{required}} for the reduction of alumina by electrolysis in the Hall-Héroult process is supplied by the anode. Anodes are produced from a mixture of petroleum coke with coal tar pitch as the binder. The minimum theoretical carbon consumption is 0. 334 kg C/kg Al. But due to current efficiency and oxidation losses the consumption is typically 400 kg C/kg Al. Petroleum coke is a by-product from crude oil refineries, but as its value represents only about 2 per cent of the overall production it has a limited interest to the producers. Mechanical and physical properties of coke {{are influenced by the}} crude oil, processes within the refineries and calcining of the coke. Continuous high demand for calcined coke by aluminium smelters has created a difficult situation with respect to quality and availability, leading to the use of lower quality coke in aluminium smelters and potential disturbances in the production. Understanding the consequences of varying calcined coke qualities is crucial for to possibly compensate and adjust process parameters in the subsequent use of the coke, in order to obtain economical production of aluminium. In the present work, the subject of study was four different petroleum coke types, where three were derived from a single source (SSA, SSB and SSC) and one was from a blend of different cokes. All of the cokes had different chemical and physical properties. Single source cokes have homogenous chemical and physical composition in the whole size range while the blended coke had heterogeneous composition due to the mixture of different coke types used. The blended coke consisted of several different coke types (25) {{in order to meet the}} required specification. This work also describes new characterisation/measurement methods which can contribute to a better understanding of variations in material properties due to physical and mechanical changes in the calcined coke feed materials. Each step in the production of pilot scale anodes is described. A new method was developed for the characterisation of the mechanical strength of calcined coke. This method, the drop test, originates from the study of materials for road construction for the determination of the grain stability of rock materials. The method determines the coke grain strength in the entire size distribution. On the other hand, established measuring methods for calcined coke, HGI (ASTM D 5003 - 95) and grain stability (ISO 10142), determine only the mechanical strength in a specific size range, + 0. 6 - 1. 18 mm and + 4 - 8 mm, respectively. In other words, both methods give limited information about coke mechanical strength distribution throughout the whole size range, which is especially important when blended cokes are used. Additionally, the results from the drop test are expressed in volume reduction, size reduction, impact force and amount of fines below 148 μm generated during the test. A good correlation between ISO 10142 and the drop test was found. The results show good correlation between the size and volume reduction and the specific grinding energy. The method can also determine the grain strength of a specific size fraction which might be critical to further processing during anode production. Totally, about 8 tons of four calcined coke types were processed during this work. The majority of this material was ground in the air swept ball mill, for production of the finest fraction, dust. The pilot scale air swept ball mill circuit is identical to the equipment used in industry today. This investigation showed the importance of process optimisation for the stable production of dust with the required specification (particle size and Blaine). Each coke exhibited different behaviour in the grinding circuit, due to different mechanical strengths, which is reported as a specific grinding energy. The mechanically weakest coke produced dust with the lowest specific grinding energy. The particle size variation in the coke used in the mill produced a significant disturbance in the product quality. It was found that the sweeping speed through the mill influences the particle size distribution in terms of the proportion of the finest particles. It also affected the particle roundness of the produced dust, which can influence the flowability of the coke when mixed with pitch. The ratio of ball sizes and the rotational speed of the mill influenced the particle size distribution, Blaine and specific grinding energy. On-line particle size control was utilised during the dust production. This system allowed continuous control of the product size by regulation of the air classifier rotor speed. Three different dust sizes were produced in the air swept ball mill, which were all below about 200 μm but contained different proportions of material below 63 μm. Sieved coke fractions together with dust were weighed according to a specified recipe and blended in a sigma <b>blade</b> <b>mixer</b> together with coal tar pitch. A vibration compactor was used for the production of green anodes under optimal conditions. The anodes were produced with three different pitch contents (15, 18 and 20 wt%) and three different dust sizes (45, 63 and 94 %, - 63 μm). Core samples of green anodes were investigated in an improved dilatometer for the determination of thermal expansion and shrinkage during baking. Improvements made to the dilatometer during this work contributed to better reproducibility, increased precision and a healthier working environment. An increase in the heating rate influenced the initial expansion, shrinkage and baking loss of the anode. The heterogeneous pitch distribution throughout the anode due to the forming force, friction between coke particles and between the paste and mould showed the importance of selecting a consistent sampling position. The results showed that the bottom samples have greater expansion due to a thicker pitch bridge layer while the top samples have reduced expansion. The sample packing material contributed to a higher initial expansion due to the reduced free surface area for binder volatiles release, and the shrinkage was reduced because of the radial thrusts from the packing material. Thermal dilation results showed differences between samples with varying pitch, dust size and coke type, which can be used to indicate the final properties of baked anodes. A good correlation was found between the thermal dilation after the pitch expansion and the dust content. Green anodes were baked under controlled conditions and then characterised. The baked apparent density showed a good correlation with the pitch content and dust size. The results showed that 18 % pitch content and 63 % - 63 μm produced the highest baked densities. The variation in coke type exhibited differences in baked density, specific electrical resistance, air permeability, CO 2 and air reactivity and modulus of elasticity. dr. ing. dr. ing...|$|E

Mixtures of free flowing and cohesive powders have also, been studied to get a more complete range of powders of different properties.

The relation between a modified power number(N-pM=P/rho(b) u(ch) (3) d(s) (2)) and a modified Froude number (Fr-M = u(ch) (2) /gd(s)) used in several previous publications is adapted and shown to depend on powder cohesion. These dimensionless numbers are built on the basis of a characteristic speed an, a characteristic length d(s), the bulk density rho(b) and the power consumption A. The filling ratio f is also taken in account. For a free flowing powder, of cohesion smaller than 0. 3 kPa, N-pM= a(f) center dot F-rM(- 1) while for a more cohesive powder, of cohesion higher than 0. 6 kPa the correlation N-pM= 6 center dot F-rM(b(f)) is more appropriate.

A method has been developed by which the process engineer {{will be able to}} design continuous mixing systems and to explore mixing strategies, thus enabling him {{to take advantage of the}} benefits of the continuous mixing of particulate solids. The method is based on the prediction of the degree of smoothing out of periodic fluctuations in composition from a knowledge of the residence time distribution of the mixer and the nature of the fluctuations. Experimental verification of the method has been carried out in a ribbon <b>blade</b> continuous <b>mixer</b> using both free flowing sand and cohesive chalk. The residence time distributions were measured by adding an impulse of coloured tracer and measuring the outgoing composition, continuously, by a reflectivity device.

Periodic fluctuations were approximated by a Fourier Series and the amplitude reduction of rectangular periodic impulses were computed and compared with the measured amplitude reduction. With few exceptions the agreement was satisfactory for engineering purposes. It is claimed that the method can be used for designing continuous mixing systems and it is shown how a minor ingredient can be added in periodic impulses rather than a continuous stream to produce a satisfactory mixture...|$|R
40|$|Processing of {{granular}} material often requires mixing steps {{in order to}} blend cohesive powders, distribute viscous liquids into powder beds or create agglomerates from a wet powder mass. For this reason, using <b>bladed,</b> high-speed <b>mixers</b> is frequently considered a good solution by many types of industry. However, despite the importance of such mixers in powder processing, the granular flow behavior inside the mixer bowl is generally not totally understood. In this work extensive experimentation was performed comparing {{the behavior of a}} lab-scale mixer (1. 9. l vessel volume) to that of a pilot-scale mixer (65. l vessel volume) with a mixture of some pharmaceutical excipients (e. g. lactose, cellulose).

The relative effects of process parameters and material properties on the bulk powder flow behavior were analyzed by performing a PLS analysis of the output parameters, including mean residence time, and axial dispersion coefficient {{as a function of}} input parameters (impeller speed, flow rate, bulk density and cohesion). The mean residence time was primarily affected by the bulk density and impeller speed, whereas the axial dispersion coefficient was affected by impeller speed and cohesion. Based on previously developed knowledge of mixing performance as a function of process parameters [1], a design rule to select the optimal number of impeller passes based on the bulk density was proposed. Impeller speed and cohesion showed a significant interacting effect on the output variable, the axial dispersion coefficient. Increase in cohesion leads to increase in the axial dispersion coefficient at higher impeller speeds, whereas a negligible effect of cohesion on the axial dispersion coefficient was observed at lower impeller speeds.

40|$|Mixing {{of fluids}} {{is one of}} the most {{important}} industrial operations. Static mixers, also known as motionless mixers, are very efficient devices used for mixing of both single phase and multiphase fluids. With a gradual increase in the usage of static mixers in various industrial operations, it is necessary to achieve higher mixing efficiency at the cost of minimum energy consumption. Mixing performance can be improved either by designing new internal geometry or by modifying an existing static mixer geometry. The objective of this research is to improve the mixing performance of static mixers by incorporating design modifications to the internal geometry. For that purpose, a static mixer with an open blade internal structure (such as SMX) was selected because of its complexed geometry and industrially proven mixing abilities. As a part of design modifications in the SMX mixer, perforations of varying sizes and different shapes of serrations were introduced to the static <b>mixer</b> <b>blades</b> using AutoCAD software. These modified static mixer geometries include perforated SMX with 2 holes of D/ 20 size on each blade, perforated SMX with 4 holes of D/ 20 size on each blade, perforated SMX with maximum number of D/ 20 holes, perforated SMX with maximum number of D/ 30 holes, perforated SMX with maximum number of D/ 40 holes, SMX with circular serrations, SMX with triangular serrations and lastly SMX with square shaped serrations. In order to select the best modified static mixer in terms of mixing performance, CFD simulations are performed using COMSOL Multiphysics software and the mixing performance of each modified static mixer geometry was compared with the standard SMX mixer. The mixing performance of each static mixer was compared on the basis of dispersive mixing and distributive mixing parameters. For laminar flow regime and incompressible fluid, simulation results for all the static mixers are first characterized in terms of pressure and velocity field, which showed good agreement with the literature data. For the comparison of dispersive mixing, shear rates and extensional efficiency of each static mixer is compared with that of a standard SMX mixer. Further, binary cluster particle tracer is injected in the flow domain to compute the distributive mixing capacity of static mixers. Distributive mixing of each mixer is quantified in terms of standard deviation. Based on the comparison of the simulation results for the dispersive and distributive mixing, the most efficient static mixer is targeted for its use in polymerization processes. Synthesis of polyacrylamide using a static mixer is explored in this research work. SMX mixer and the most efficient modified static mixer based on the overall mixing performance are chosen to carry out the homopolymerization of acrylamide using CFD simulations. It is observed that the modified static mixer performs better than the SMX mixer in terms of monomer conversion, reaction rate and polymer concentration...|$|R
40|$|Kurzfassung Innerhalb dieses Beitrags wird die numerische Simulationsmethode der Extended Discrete Element Methode (XDEM) vorgestellt, mit der die Wechselwirkung zwischen Reifen und steinigem Untergrund detailliert beschrieben werden kann. Dabei wird der Reifen als ein Kontinuum betrachtet, das mit der Finiten Element Methode (FEM) abgebildet wird. Der grobkörnige Untergrund, wie beispielsweise Sand oder Kies, wird als granulares Medium betrachtet. Dieses kann sehr vorteilhaft mit der Diskreten Element Methode (DEM) behandelt werden, die eine Betrachtung der individuellen Partikel zulässt. Basierend auf den Gesetzen von Newton werden Position und Orientierung aller Partikel berechnet, wobei Kräfte zwischen den Partikeln und dem Reifen berücksichtigt werden. Kräfte zwischen Partikeln und Reifen treten als Randbedingungen in der FEM Struktur des Reifens auf, und führen damit zur Deformation und somit zu Spannungverteilung in der Reifenstrucktur. Eine Integration in der Zeit bestimmt sowohl den Zustand des Untergrunds als auch die Reaktion des Reifens. Dies wird durch eine {{innovative}} Kopplung zwischen der Discrete Particle Method (DPM) zur Beschreibung des granularen Mediums und dem Finite Element Löser DiffPACK erreicht und deshalb als Extended Discrete Element Methode bezeichnet wird. Beides sind objekt- orientierte Software-Werkzeuge, die über eine Schnittstelle die notwendigen Daten austauschen, so dass der Anwender sein Augenmerk auf die Problemlösung richten kann als sich mit Datenaustausch und Algorithmen zu befassen. Damit wurde ein vielseitiges und flexibles Werkzeug zur Lösung vielfältiger Probleme wie auch die Bewegung eines Reifens im Schnee geschaffen. Das neuartige Konzept ist sowohl auf Windows als auch auf UNIX basierenden Betriebssystemen verfügbar. Abstract The {{objective of}} this contribution is to resolve different length scales in structure analysis by an interface coupling the Discrete Element Method (DEM) with the Finite Element Method (FEM) and therefore, is labelled Extended Discrete Element Methode (XDEM). This approach distinguishes itself from other methods in so far that no overlapping domains between Finite and Discrete Elements exist. Both domains are separated in physical space and numerical simulation domain. The proposed approach is relevant to almost all engineering applications that deal with granular matter such as storage in hoppers, transport on conveyor belts or displacement of granular material as in mixers or excavation of soil. For these applications an engineering device such as <b>mixer</b> <b>blades</b> or cutting tools are in contact with granular matter. Contacts with individual particles generate contact forces that act on both the engineering device and the granular material. The latter experiences a displacement of individual particles whereby the engineering structure responds with deformation and stresses. In order to predict and optimize both the behaviour and motion of granular material and the structures in contact, numerical simulation tools are increasingly employed [1]. Simulations are popular especially because experiments which are often expensive, time- consuming and sometimes even dangerous [2]. The continuous increase in computing power is now enabling researchers to implement numerical methods that do not focus on the granular assembly as an entity, but rather deduce its global characteristics from observing the individual behaviour of each grain. An interaction between granular media and a structure relies on a transfer of forces between them. Granular media consists of an ensemble of particles of which a number of particles may be in contact with a surface e. g. walls as surfaces of solid structures. The contact is resolved similar to inter-particle contacts by a representative overlap. It defines the position of impact {{as well as the}} force acting on the particle at this position. The same force, however, into the opposite direction defines a mechanical load for the structure. In order to determine the effect of forces on the solid structure, it is discretised by finite elements. The impact of the force is transferred to the nodes of the respective surface element and appears as a load for the finite element system. Hence, integrating particle dynamics and the response of the solid structure due to particle impacts advances both new position of particles and corresponding deformation and stress of the solid structure in time. Developing flexible software which is capable of performing simulation in different applications will enable the engineers to focus entirely on their specific problem and hence save them valuable time. This concept is supported by the software tools of the Discrete Particle Method (DPM) and Diffpack. Hence, the solid structure is analysed by the Finite Element Method under load due to the impact of individual particles that changes both in time and space. For this purpose traditional formulations of the Finite Element Method are employed that are available by the commercial multi-physics software package Diffpack. It represents object-oriented hierarchy of classes that provide an excellent interface to introduce external loads from particle impact onto the finite element structure. Diffpack is an object-oriented development environment, which comes as a rich set of C++ classes, for the numerical modelling and solution of arbitrary differential equations. User applications cover a wider range of engineering areas and span from simple educational applications to major product development projects. The behaviour of granular material is represented by the advanced software package of the Discrete Particle Method (DPM), which is based on the Discrete Element Method. It is designed to relieve users from underlying mathematics and software design and allows them to focus on physics and their applications. The software uses object oriented techniques that support objects representing three-dimensional particles of various shapes such as cylinders, discs or tetrahedrons for example, size and material properties. This makes it a highly versatile tool dealing with a large variety of different applications of granular matter arising in the automotive industry, such as road tire interaction. Various force models for the inter- particle and particle-wall contacts are also available. A minimal user interface easily allows extending the software further by adding user-defined impact models or material properties to an already available selection of materials and properties. Thus, the user is relieved of the underlying mathematics or software design, and therefore, is able to direct his focus entirely onto the application. The Discrete Particle Method is written in C++ programming language and works both in Linux and Windows environments...|$|R
