Using bufuralol- 1 '-hydroxylation to carbinol to optimize the procedure, 3 cytochrome P 450 isozymes (P 450 A, P 450 buf, P 450 C) were purified to apparent electrophoretic homogeneity from human liver microsomes.

40|$|<b>Bufuralol</b> 1 '-hydroxylation, a {{commonly}} used marker of hepatic CYP 2 D 6 activity, {{was investigated in}} human and rhesus monkey intestinal microsomes and compared with that in hepatic microsomes. The cumene hydroperoxide (CuOOH) -mediated metabolism of (+) -bufuralol suggested {{that at least two}} enzymes were responsible for <b>bufuralol</b> 1 '-hydroxylation in both human and monkey intestinal microsomes. In contrast, the kinetics of the CuOOH-mediated metabolism in human and monkey livers were monophasic. The Km values for the higher affinity component of the intestinal enzyme(s) of both species were similar to, while the corresponding Vmax values were much lower than, those obtained with the livers. <b>Bufuralol</b> metabolism mediated by NADPH exhibited biphasic kinetics and was less efficient than that observed in the presence of CuOOH in both human and monkey intestines, in agreement with the observations in the livers. Inhibition of <b>bufuralol</b> hydroxylase activity in the intestine and liver preparations from the same species by known CYP 2 D 6 inhibitors/substrates was qualitatively similar. Quinidine was the most potent inhibitor of (+) -bufuralol 1 '-hydroxylation in all tissues studied. Western immunoblots using anti-CYP 2 D 6 peptide antibody revealed a protein band in human and monkey intestinal microsomes of the same molecular weight as that observed in the liver preparations. The intestinal CYP 2 D protein content appeared to be much less than that of liver, and correlated with the (+) -bufuralol hydroxylase activity. Immunoinhibition studies indicated significant (up to 50 %) inhibition of the CuOOH-mediated (+) -bufuralol metabolism in human and monkey intestines only by anti-CYP 2 D 6, and not by anti-CYP 2 A 6, or anti-CYP 2 E 1. Inhibition of the <b>bufuralol</b> 1 '-hydroxylase activity by anti-rat CYP 3 A 1 was only slight (20 %) in human, but marked (60 - 65 %) in monkey intestinal microsomes. The hepatic metabolism of (+) -bufuralol in humans and monkeys was only inhibited (75 %) by anti-CYP 2 D 6, but not by anti-CYP 3 A 1. Overall, the results suggest that (1) tissue and species differences exist in the catalysis of (+) -bufuralol 1 '-hydroxylation, and (2) CYP 2 D 6 -related enzymes are partially or primarily responsible for the <b>bufuralol</b> hydroxylase activity in human and monkey intestines or monkey liver.

To examine the role of Phe 120, mutants of CYP 2 D 6 in which this residue has been substituted by alanine, leucine, tyrosine, serine, histidine, tryptophan or methionine residues have been prepared in bacterial membranes co-expressing human cytochrome NADPH cytochrome P 450 oxidoreductase.

Stopped-flow studies, however, suggested that apo-b(5) as well as b(5) did not cause stimulation of the reduction of CYP 2 C 10 by NADPH-P 450 reductase, while the reduction rates were dependent on the substrates in reconstituted systems.

The apparent dissociation constants (Kd) for quinidine binding to wild type enzyme or to the Glu 216 Asp and Asp 301 Glu mutants were 0. 25 - 0. 50 μM. The amide substitutions of Glu 216 or Asp 301 resulted in 30 to 64 -fold increases in Kd for quinidine. The double mutant Glu 216 Gln/Asp 301 Gln showed the largest decrease in quinidine affinity with a Kd of 65 μM. Changes in the mode of quinidine binding were indicated by changes in the optical difference spectra on binding. Alanine substitution of Phe 120, Phe 481 or Phe 483 had only a minor effect on the inhibition of <b>bufuralol</b> 1 '-hydroxylation and dextromethorphan O-demethylation, and on binding. In contrast to the wild-type enzyme, a number of the mutants studied were found to be able to metabolise quinidine.

40|$|Based on {{sequence}} alignments and homology modeling, threonine 309 in cytochrome P 450 2 D 6 (CYP 2 D 6) {{is proposed}} {{to be the}} conserved I-helix threonine, {{which is supposed to}} be involved in dioxygen activation by CYPs. The T 309 V mutant of CYP 2 D 6 displayed a strong shift from O-dealkylation to N-dealkylation reactions in oxidation of dextromethorphan and 3, 4 - methylenedioxymethylamphetamine. This may be explained by an elevated ratio of hydroperoxo-iron to oxenoid-iron of the oxygenating species. In consistence, using cumene hydroperoxide, which directly forms the oxenoid-iron, the T 309 V mutant again selectively catalyzed the O-dealkylation reactions. The changed ratio of oxygenating species can also explain the decreased activity and changed regioselectivity that were observed in 7 -methoxy- 4 -(aminomethyl) -coumarin and <b>bufuralol</b> oxidation, respectively, by the T 309 V mutant. Interestingly, the T 309 V mutant always showed a significantly increased, up to 75 -fold, higher activity compared to that of the wild-type when using cumene hydroperoxide. These results indicate that T 309 in CYP 2 D 6 is involved in maintaining the balance of multiple oxygenating species and thus influences substrate and regioselectivity. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|Cytochrome P- 450 CYP 2 D 6, human {{debrisoquine}} hydroxylase, metabolizes {{more than}} 30 prescribed drugs, {{the vast majority}} of which are small molecules containing a basic nitrogen atom. In contrast, the similar mouse protein Cyp 2 d- 9 was first characterized as a testosterone 16 alpha-hydroxylase. No common substrates have been reported for the two enzymes. Here we investigate the structural basis of this difference in substrate specificity. We have earlier used a combination of NMR data and homology modelling to generate a three-dimensional model of CYP 2 D 6 [Modi, Paine, Sutcliffe, Lian, Primrose, Wolf, C. R. and Roberts (1996) Biochemistry 35, 4541 - 4550]. We have now generated a homology model of Cyp 2 d- 9 and compared the two models to identify specific amino acid residues that we believe form the substrate-binding site in each protein and therefore influence catalytic selectivity. Although there are many similarities in active site structure, the most notable difference is a phenylalanine residue (Phe- 483) in CYP 2 D 6, which in the model is located such that the bulky phenyl ring is positioned across the channel mouth, thus limiting the size of substrate that can access the active site. In Cyp 2 d- 9, the corresponding position is occupied by an isoleucine residue, which imposes fewer steric restraints on the size of substrate that can access the active site. To investigate whether the amino acid residue at this position does indeed influence the catalytic selectivity of these enzymes, site-directed mutagenesis was used to change Phe- 483 in CYP 2 D 6 to isoleucine and also to tryptophan. CYP 2 D 6, Cyp 2 d- 9 and both mutant CYP 2 D 6 proteins were co-expressed with NADPH cytochrome P- 450 reductase as a functional mono-oxygenase system in Escherichia coli and their relative catalytic activities towards <b>bufuralol</b> and testosterone were determined. All four proteins exhibited catalytic activity towards <b>bufuralol</b> but only Cyp 2 d- 9 catalysed the formation of 16 alpha-hydroxytesterone. Uniquely, the CYP 2 D 6 F 483 I mutant acquired the ability to metabolize testosterone to a novel product, which was identified by MS and proton NMR spectroscopy as 15 alpha-hydroxytestosterone. NMR spin relaxation experiments were used to measure distances between the haem iron and protons of testosterone bound to the CYP 2 D 6 F 483 I mutant. These experiments demonstrate that very minor modifications to the active site structure of CYP 2 D 6 can have a profound influence on the substrate specificity of the enzyme...|$|E

The inhibition profiles of 20 known inhibitors of CYP 2 D 6 were characterized in vitro against four clinically relevant CYP 2 D 6 substrates (desipramine, dextro-methorphan, metoprolol, and thioridazine) and <b>bufuralol.</b> Dextro-methorphan exhibited the highest sensitivity to in vitro inhibition, whereas metoprolol was the least sensitive.
