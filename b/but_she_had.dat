While searching for targets {{in the vicinity of}} Venice in August 1915, U-12 struck a mine that blew her stern off, and sank with all hands, becoming the first Austro-Hungarian submarine sunk in the war. Her wreck was salvaged the next year by the Italians, who interred U-12s crewmen in a Venetian cemetery.|$|E

5|$|Indeed, when {{financial}} circumstances forced Manning {{to leave}} school at sixteen, {{she worked as}} a typist, and spent some time as a junior in a beauty salon. A talented artist, she took evening classes at the Portsmouth Municipal School of Art, where a fellow student described her as intellectual and aloof. In May 1928, she had a painting selected for an exhibition at Southsea, and was subsequently offered a one-woman show of her works. Manning seemed to be poised for a career as an artist, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> meanwhile continued her interest in literature, and at the age of twenty determined instead to be a writer. Her artist's eye is apparent in her later intense descriptions of landscapes.|$|E
5|$|Other minor {{roles were}} cut with {{subsequent}} drafts of the script. At the US premiere of Goblet of Fire, series producer David Heyman said that former Hogwarts professor Gilderoy Lockhart, played by Kenneth Branagh in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, {{was in the}} first draft of the script for Phoenix. However, neither Branagh nor the character of Lockhart appears in the final version. Tiana Benjamin was scheduled to return for the film in the role of Angelina Johnson, the captain of the Gryffindor Quidditch team, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> to withdraw due to a commitment to playing Chelsea Fox in EastEnders. The character, as well as the entire Quidditch subplot, was ultimately cut from the film. She did, however, record sound clips for the Order of the Phoenix video game.|$|E

5|$|Rambles in Germany and Italy, in 1840, 1842, and 1843 is {{a travel}} {{narrative}} by the British Romantic author Mary Shelley. Issued in 1844, {{it is her}} last published work. Published in two volumes, the text describes two European trips that Mary Shelley took with her son, Percy Florence Shelley, {{and several of his}} university friends. Mary Shelley had lived in Italy with her husband, Percy Bysshe Shelley, between 1818 and 1823. For her, Italy was associated with both joy and grief: she had written much while there <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> also lost her husband and two of her children. Thus, although she was anxious to return, the trip was tinged with sorrow. Shelley describes her journey as a pilgrimage, which will help cure her depression.|$|E
5|$|Ramona, {{published}} in 1884, {{was based in}} part on experiences that Helen Hunt Jackson had had during her visit to Rancho Camulos in 1882. Jackson spent only two hours on the ranch and did not meet Ysabel del Valle, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> a keen eye for details and used many of her observations in the novel. For example, the altar cloth in the rancho's chapel had a small tear in it which had been mended. In the novel, the character Margarita accidentally tears the altar cloth, and Ramona sews it back together. The book became extremely popular and inspired a great deal of tourism, which was stimulated by the improved access possible due to the opening of Southern Pacific railroad lines in Southern California.|$|E
5|$|Sarah, a strong-willed {{woman who}} liked to get her own way, tried the Queen's {{patience}} whenever she disagreed with her on political, court or church appointments. After her final break with Anne in 1711, Sarah {{and her husband were}} dismissed from the court, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> her revenge under the Hanoverians following Anne's death. She had famous subsequent disagreements with many important people, including her daughter the second Duchess of Marlborough; the architect of Blenheim Palace, John Vanbrugh; prime minister Robert Walpole; King George II; and his wife, Queen Caroline. The money she inherited from the Marlborough trust left her one of the richest women in Europe. She died in 1744 at the age of eighty-four.|$|E

5|$|Talbot died {{in about}} 1140, and his lands passed to Sybil, and her second husband, Josce de Dinan. He {{was buried in}} Gloucester Abbey. The lands at Swanscombe were divided between Talbot's two nieces, Cecily and Agnes, the daughters of Sybil and Pain fitzJohn. Cecily married first Roger of Hereford, son of Miles of Gloucester, and second William of Poitou and third Walter de Mayenne, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> no {{children}} by any of her marriages and on her death in 1207, her lands passed to the heirs of her sister Agnes. Cecily's death without heirs also meant that the feudal barony of Swanscombe passed to her sister's heirs. Agnes married first Warin de Mountchesney and second Haldenald de Bidun, and her descendants held the barony of Swanscombe until 1324, when the line died out.|$|E
5|$|Ten months later, {{she became}} editor of US Vogue. Under Mirabella, {{it had become}} more focused on lifestyles {{as a whole and}} less on fashion. Industry {{insiders}} worried that it was losing ground to the recently introduced American edition of Elle. After making sweeping changes in staff, she changed the style of the cover pictures. Mirabella had preferred tight head shots of well-known models in studios; Wintour's covers showed more of the body and were taken outside, like those Diana Vreeland had done years earlier. She used less well-known models, and mixed inexpensive clothes with high fashion: the first issue she was in charge of, November 1988, featured a Peter Lindbergh photograph of 19-year-old Michaela Bercu in a $50 pair of faded jeans and a bejeweled jacket by Christian Lacroix worth $10,000. It was the first time a Vogue cover model had worn jeans (Bercu was originally supposed to have worn the skirt that coordinated with the jacket, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> gained some weight and it didn't fit).|$|E
5|$|Voroshilov {{was laid}} {{down at the}} Marti South {{shipyard}} in Nikolayev on 15 October 1935; {{the second of the}} Project 26, to use their industrial designation, Kirov-class cruisers. She was launched on 28 June 1937, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> to wait for her Soviet-built machinery to be delivered before she was completed on 20 June 1940. On 26 June 1941 Voroshilov covered Soviet destroyers bombarding Constanta, after the Germans attacked the Soviet Union, and was slightly damaged by a mine exploded by the destroyer 's paravanes. She bombarded Axis troops near Odessa on 19 September with 148 180mm shells and was transferred to Novorossiysk shortly afterwards. On 2 November the ship was bombed in harbor by Junkers Ju 88 bombers of Kampfgeschwader 51. She was hit twice; one hit started a fire in #3 magazine that was extinguished by water flooding in from the second hit. Voroshilov had to be towed to Poti for repairs, which lasted until February 1942. She shelled Axis positions near Feodosiya on 19 March and 3 April 1942, but was damaged by fragments from bombs from Ju 88s on 10 April and had to return to Batumi for minor repairs.|$|E
