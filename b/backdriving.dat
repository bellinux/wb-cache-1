5000|$|A {{subset of}} CVT designs are called {{infinitely}} variable transmissions (IVT or IVTs), {{in which the}} range of ratios of output shaft speed to input shaft speed includes a zero ratio that can be continuously approached from a defined [...] "higher" [...] ratio. A zero output speed (low gear) with a finite input speed implies an infinite input-to-output speed ratio, which can be continuously approached from a given finite input value with an IVT. Low gears are a reference to low ratios of output speed to input speed. This low ratio is taken to the extreme with IVTs, resulting in a [...] "neutral", or non-driving [...] "low" [...] gear limit, in which the output speed is zero. Unlike neutral in a normal automotive transmission, IVT output rotation may be prevented because the back-driving (reverse IVT operation) ratio may be infinite, resulting in impossibly high <b>backdriving</b> torque; in a ratcheting IVT, however, the output may freely rotate in the forward direction.|$|E

40|$|A rotary {{coupling}} for connecting a driven part to {{a source}} of rotary force is described. This device transmits rotary force in one direction only and disengages to permit the driven part to free wheel when the input member is stopped and precludes the <b>backdriving</b> of rotary force from output member to input member. The coupling includes an input member having a splined shaft, a coupling member connected to the splined shaft, and a coaxial output member. The coupling member and the output member having complementary sets of axially facing clutch teeth. Guides {{in the form of}} helical grooves on the coupling member and spring loaded followers acting with the guides affect the engagement and disengagement of the clutch teeth by moving the coupling member toward and away from output member, the followers and guides themselves disengaging to permit free wheeling of output member when input member is stopped...|$|E
40|$|Scuffing-like {{damage has}} been found on the tooth {{surfaces}} of gears 5 and 6 of the NASA space shuttle rudder/speed brake power drive unit (PDU) number 2 after the occurrence of a transient back-driving event in flight. Tests were conducted using a pair of unused spare flight gears in a bench test at operating conditions up to 2866 rpm and 1144 in. -lb at the input ring gear and 14, 000 rpm and 234 in. -lb at the output pinion gear, corresponding to a power level of 52 hp. This test condition exceeds the maximum estimated conditions expected in a <b>backdriving</b> event thought to produce the scuffing damage. Some wear marks were produced, but they were much less severe than the scuffing damaged produced during shuttle flight. Failure to produce scuff damage like that found on the shuttle {{may be due to}} geometrical variations between the scuffed gears and the gears tested herein, more severe operating conditions during the flight that produced the scuff than estimated, the order of the test procedures, the use of new hydraulic oil, differences between the dynamic response of the flight gearbox and the bench-test gearbox, or a combination of these. This report documents the test gears, apparatus, and procedures, summarizes the test results, and includes a discussion of the findings, conclusions, and recommendations...|$|E
40|$|A new Design-for-Test (DjT) {{structure}} {{based on}} a configurable operational amplijier, {{referred to as a}} “swap amp ” is presented that allows access to embedded analogue blocks. The structure has minimal impact on circuit performance and has been evaluated on a custom designed Phase Locked Loop (PLL) structure. A test chip containing faulty and fault free versions of this PLL structure, with and without DjT modifications, has been fabricated and an evaluation of this DjT scheme based on the swap-amp structure carried out. It is shown that for embedded analogue blocks, the DjT strategy can not only improve and simplify analogue & mixed signal IC test, but can also be used for diagnostics. simple to implement and the problem of <b>backdriving</b> is totally eliminated. Application of the Df f scheme to a phase-locked-loop circuit is presented. The scheme is shown to greatly improve both detection and diagnostic capabilities associated with a number of hard and soft faults. The format of the paper will be as follows; Section 2 will identify related work, sections 3 and 4 will then discuss critical issues in the design of an analogue Dff architecture and identifies the optimal placement of switches. Section 5 will describe the design of the swap-amp and present an analysis of its performance. In section 6, a Dff scheme exploiting the “swap-amp’ ’ design is discussed and in section 7 the test chip fabricated to access the fault detection and diagnostic capabilities of the scheme is described. Section 8 will present results from the silicon and section 9 will conclude and discuss future work...|$|E
