The two commonly accepted houses of Tynwald are the House of Keys and the Legislative Council, but according to some, the Tynwald Court (consisting {{of the members of}} <b>both</b> <b>houses</b> <b>meeting</b> <b>together)</b> counts as a third house. Others disagree, saying that as there are no members of the Court who are not also members of the other houses, the Court should not be considered separately (by comparison, in Australia, Switzerland and India deadlocks between the two Houses can sometimes be resolved by a joint sitting, but experts would not classify either of those countries as [...] "tricameral").|$|E
