40|$|Deontic {{concepts}} and operators {{have been widely}} used in several fields where representation of norms is needed, including legal reasoning and normative multi-agent systems. In the meantime, abductive logic programming (ALP for short) has been exploited to formalize societies of agents, commitments and institutions, taking advantage from ALP operational support as (static or dynamic) verification tool. Nonetheless, the modal nature of deontic operators smoothly fits into abductive semantics and abductive reasoning, where hypotheses can be raised at run-time {{on the basis of the}} specified formulas. In recent works, a mapping of the most common deontic <b>operators</b> (<b>obligation,</b> prohibition, permission) to the abductive expectations of an ALP framework for agent societies has been proposed. This mapping was supported by showing a correspondence between declarative semantics of abductive expectations and Kripke semantics for deontic operators. Building upon such correspondence, in this work we introduce Deon [*]+[*], a language where the two <b>basic</b> deontic <b>operators</b> (namely, <b>obligation</b> and prohibition) are enriched with quantification over time, by means of ALP and Constraint Logic Programming (CLP for short). In this way, we can take into account different flavors for obligations and prohibitions over time, i. e., existential or universal. We also discuss how to address consistency verification of such deontic specifications by a suitable ALP proof procedure, enriched with CLP constraints...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the most}} common {{mechanisms}} used for speeding up problem solvers is macrolearning. Macros are sequences of <b>basic</b> <b>operators</b> acquired during problem solving. Macros are used by the problem solver as if they were <b>basic</b> <b>operators.</b> The major problem that macro-learning presents is the vast number of macros that are available for acquisition. Macros increase the branching factor of the search space and can severely degrade problemsolving efficiency. To make macro learning useful, a program must be selective in acquiring and utilizing macros. This paper describes a general method for selective acquisition of macros. Solvable training problems are generated in increasing order of difficulty. The only macros acquired are those that take the problem solver out of a local minimum to a better state. The utility of the method is demonstrated in several domains, including the domain of N Θ N sliding-tile puzzles.
