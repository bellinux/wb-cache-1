50|$|The {{contrast}} seeker is {{a simple}} device that can be implemented using very basic analog electronics. It first uses some form of automatic gain control to adjust the image brightness until it contains some areas with high-contrast spots. This produces a bias voltage signal to represent the <b>background</b> <b>brightness</b> level, making brighter objects stand out. Any rapid change in contrast along a given scan line causes the voltage from the camera to suddenly change. If the change is greater than a selected threshold, it triggers a second circuit that sends {{the output of the}} scanning time base generator into capacitors. Thus the capacitors store a voltage value representing the Y and X locations of any high contrast spot within the image.|$|E
40|$|The cosmic optical {{background}} {{is an important}} observable that constrains energy production in stars and more exotic physical processes in the universe, and provides a crucial cosmological benchmark against which to judge theories of structure formation. Measurement of the absolute <b>brightness</b> of this <b>background</b> is complicated by local foregrounds like the Earth's atmosphere and sunlight reflected from local interplanetary dust, and large discrepancies in the inferred brightness of the optical background have resulted. Observations from probes far from the Earth are not affected by these bright foregrounds. Here we analyze data from the Long Range Reconnaissance Imager (LORRI) instrument on NASA's New Horizons mission acquired during cruise phase outside the orbit of Jupiter, and find a statistical upper limit on the optical <b>background's</b> <b>brightness</b> similar to the integrated light from galaxies. We conclude that a carefully performed survey with LORRI could yield uncertainties comparable to those from galaxy counting measurements.

30|$|<b>Background</b> <b>brightness</b> masking, texture masking, and {{frequency}} masking effects of human vision system (HVS) are often applied to digital watermarking technology, {{which has a}} great relationship with the embedding strength {{and the value of}} the visible threshold value. In the visual system, brightness {{and frequency}} are much more important to image or video than color or direction. The higher the <b>background</b> <b>brightness</b> is, the less sensitive to the human eye. That is, <b>background</b> <b>brightness</b> can very well mask the change of image. In the transform domain algorithm, the human eye changes the image by the high-frequency coefficient or the diagonal coefficient, which does not reflect the change of the image, that is to say, the frequency coefficient can mask the change of the image. The more complex the image background texture is, the more difficult the human eye can judge the change of the image, the image texture can be changed by masking, so the embedding strength of the watermark can be increase moderately in the relatively complex background image.|$|E

40|$|A {{group of}} three pigeons was trained on a 4 -ply {{multiple}} schedule: a green color and a vertical line superimposed upon an achromatic background as positive stimuli, and a red color and a horizontal line on an achromatic background as negative stimuli. The pigeons were tested with the vertical line superimposed upon different achromatic background intensities, then with the vertical line superimposed upon different green background intensities, and finally with the vertical line and its training achromatic backgfound attenuated (and unattenuated) by a neutral density filter. The gradients peaked at the luminance of the achromatic background used during training and at the equivalent luminance for the green background when it was substituted for the achromatic <b>background.</b> The <b>brightness</b> contrast, not the background luminance, was the critical variable as the neutral density filter attenuated both the line and the <b>background</b> equally, leaving <b>brightness</b> contrast unchanged; {{there was no response}} decrement to this attenuated stimulus.

40|$|This {{empirical}} study {{demonstrates the}} feasibility of using 89 GHz Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer &ndash; Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) passive microwave brightness temperature data to detect heavily drizzling cells within marine stratocumulus. A binary heavy drizzle product is described {{that can be used}} to determine areal and feature statistics of drizzle cells within the major marine stratocumulus regions. Current satellite liquid water path (LWP) and cloud radar products capable of detecting drizzle are either lacking in resolution (AMSR-E LWP), diurnal coverage (MODIS LWP), or spatial coverage (CloudSat). The AMSR-E 89 GHz data set at 6 &times; 4 km spatial resolution is sufficient for resolving individual heavily drizzling cells. Radiant emission at 89 GHz by liquid-water cloud and precipitation particles from drizzling cells in marine stratocumulus regions yields local maxima in brightness temperature against an otherwise cloud-free <b>background</b> <b>brightness</b> temperature. The <b>background</b> <b>brightness</b> temperature is primarily constrained by column-integrated water vapor and sea surface temperature. Clouds containing ice are screened out. Once heavily drizzling pixels are identified, connected pixels are grouped into discrete drizzle cell features. The identified drizzle cells are used in turn to determine several spatial statistics for each satellite scene, including drizzle cell number and size distribution. The identification of heavily drizzling cells within marine stratocumulus regions with satellite data facilitates analysis of seasonal and regional drizzle cell occurrence and the interrelation between drizzle and changes in cloud fraction...|$|E

40|$|A {{new method}} of {{determining}} the <b>background</b> sky <b>brightness</b> for stellar photometric measurements with CCDs is described. By fitting and subtracting stellar profiles from a CCD image, one can measure the sky brightness directly at the position of each star after subtraction.

The 'direct sky' brightness for a star is the convergent value of the sky after a few such iterations and is the most direct measurement of the line-of-sight contribution of the background to the observed magnitude of a star. Using this method, a decrease of the random photometric errors by more than a factor of two over standard methods is possible, with the most significant improvements for stars in very crowded regions and areas of strong and highly variable nebulosity...|$|R

40|$|The K {{passband}} (central wavelength 2. 2 microns, FWHM 0. 4 micron) is {{the longest}} wavelength standard near-IR passband through which deep ground-based imaging is possible. Thermal emission from telescope, instrument, and sky limits the depth to which such imaging can reach by producing strongly temperature-dependent backgrounds in the range 11 - 13. 5 mag/sq arcsec. This paper describes how a passband, which is denoted as K-prime, located slightly shortward of the standard K passband (central wavelength 2. 1 microns), yet still within the same atmospheric window, leads to a significantly lower thermal component of the background, reducing the <b>background</b> surface <b>brightness</b> by up to 0. 9 mag sq arcsec, and thereby allowing deeper imaging to be obtained in the same integration time.

40|$|Primordial {{magnetic}} fields possibly {{generated in the}} very early universe are one of the candidates for the origin of {{magnetic fields}} observed in many galaxies and galaxy clusters. After recombination, the dissipation process of the primordial magnetic fields increases the baryon temperature. The Lorentz force acts on the residual ions and electrons to generate density fluctuations. These effects are imprinted on the cosmic microwave <b>background</b> (CMB) <b>brightness</b> temperature fluctuations produced by the neutral hydrogen 21 cm line. We calculate the angular power spectrum of brightness temperature fluctuations for the model with the primordial magnetic fields of a several nano Gauss strength and a power-law spectrum. It is found that the overall amplitude and the shape of the brightness temperature fluctuations depend on the strength and the spectral index of the primordial magnetic fields. Therefore, it is expected that the observations of the CMB brightness temperature fluctuations give us a strong constraint on the primordial magnetic fields.
