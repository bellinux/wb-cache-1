25|$|The {{population}} of Arizona, particularly in Phoenix, swelled as {{result of the}} war and it was the new military installations and associated manufacturers that provided the impetus for the growth. Many veterans who were stationed in Arizona during the war returned after the fighting was over, having found it to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> find work and raise a family. In 1940, the {{population of}} Arizona was less than 500,000, but by 1950 it had grown to 750,000. The population of Phoenix in 1940 was 65,000. By 1960 it had become the largest city in the Southwest with a population of 439,000.|$|E
25|$|Nonetheless, {{they both}} {{traveled}} (together with their Chinese teacher Mr. Wong whom Rev. Nelson had converted) toward Changshu (Dzang Zok), {{a city of}} about 100,000 people) about 70 miles northwest of Shanghai in February 1858. They preached, including on Chinese New Year's Day, and confirmed Rev. Nelson's suggestion that it might <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> establish a mission, and accordingly wrote bishop Boone for permission in May. However, a week after they received accommodation at a temple in February, a police officer advised the priest who gave them shelter not to harbor foreign devils. Before they returned in June, Britain's gunboat diplomacy had led to the Treaty of Tientsin. While Changshu's mayor was interested in their preaching (and became their new landlord), and many others also wanted the missionaries to stay, other Mandarin officials opposed them.|$|E

500|$|In the early-21st century, the Greater London Authority {{commissioned}} {{a plan to}} improve {{the road from the}} architectural firm, Terry Farrell and Partners. The original study proposed removing the underpass (which was subsequently cancelled) and providing a pedestrian crossing and removing the gyratory system connecting Tottenham Court Road and Gower Street. The scheme was approved by the Mayor of London, Ken Livingstone as [...] "the start of changing the Marylebone to Euston road from a highway into a series of linked public spaces." [...] The pedestrian crossing opened in March 2010. Livingstone's successor, Boris Johnson, favours keeping the Euston Road underpass and declared it to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> test his nerves when cycling around London.|$|E
500|$|The film {{received}} mixed {{reception in}} trade publications, but some advertisements would boast {{the power of}} the film or {{go so far as to}} call it a great American drama. The The Moving Picture News stated, [...] "As a sketch of country folk, admirable because it is true. The situations are well worked out. The conversion! Could it be? A New England church meeting would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> exhibit and - ask questions." [...] Though the reviewer in the The New York Dramatic Mirror however disagreed that the premise was plausible, [...] "A [...] old deacon forms the complicating element in this rather conventional and rather improbable story. That a girl could become a comic opera star without the knowledge of her parents is a strain for the imagination. That a simple little dance like the one in the picture could effect such a conversion is another tax on belief. The acting is good, especially in the heroine's role. The deacon displays an unnatural tendency in such a stern character when he rapturously kisses the photograph of his daughter." [...] It is unknown if the character of Deacon Sanders is really a church deacon because the synopsis states Deacon Sanders is a farmer who is [...] "nearly as poor as he is religious".|$|E

60|$|It {{was then}} {{too late for}} them to share our custom, but I {{am not sure that}} it was not one of these very horses or drivers whom we got another day for our drive about the town and its suburbs, and an {{excursion}} to a section of the Moorish aqueduct which remains after a thousand years. You can see it at a distance, but no horse or driver in our employ could ever find the way to it; in fact, it seemed to vanish on approach, and we were always bringing up in our hotel gardens without having got to it; I do not know what we should have done with it if we had. We were not able to do anything definite with the new villas built or building around Algeciras, though they looked very livable, and seemed proof of a prosperity in the place for which I can give no reason except the great natural beauty of the nearer neighborhood, and the magnificence of the farther, mountain-walled and skyed over with a September blue in November.
