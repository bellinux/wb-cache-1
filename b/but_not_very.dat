After purification, some of these tags are usually removed and the pure protein is obtained.|$|E

25|$|Early iron {{smelting}} {{made use}} of bloomeries which produced two layers of metal: one with a very low carbon content which is worked into wrought iron, and one with a high carbon outer layer. Since the high carbon iron is hot short, meaning it fractures and crumbles when forged, it was not useful without more smelting. As a result, it went largely unused in the west until the popularization of the finery forge. The wrought iron, with nearly no carbon in it, was very malleable and ductile <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>very</b> hard.|$|E
25|$|The Countach was {{styled by}} Marcello Gandini of the Bertone design studio, the same {{designer}} and studio that designed the Miura. Gandini {{was then a}} young, inexperienced designer— not very experienced in the practical, ergonomic aspects of automobile design, {{but at the same}} time unhindered by them. Gandini again produced another striking design. The Countach shape was wide and low (74.28 inches in width and 42.05 inches in height), <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>very</b> long (162.7 in length). Its angular and wedge-shaped body was made almost entirely of flat, trapezoidal panels.|$|E

The pre-war hubs were smooth {{and after the}} war, there was a raised part {{in the center of}} the hub. Tracks on the tanks and the 162a Light Dragon Artillery Tractor were done with wire-link {{sprocket}} chain wrapped around the hubs. This gave a mechanical, <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>very</b> realistic, appearance to the tracks.

25|$|The Royal Botanic Gardens in Sydney have {{published}} {{information on how}} to grow Wollemi Pines from seed which has been harvested from helicopters from the forest trees. The majority of seeds that fall from the cone are not viable so need to be sorted to retain the plump and dark ones. These can then be sown on top of seed raising mix and watered. Once the water has drained through the mix, the pot should be placed in a plastic bag and refrigerated for two weeks. After this, the pot should be removed from the plastic bag and placed somewhere warm <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>very</b> sunny until the seed germinates (remembering to keep them moist but not wet). This could take several months.|$|E
25|$|The {{apparent}} lack {{of airborne}} transmission among humans {{is believed to be}} due to low levels of the virus in the lungs {{and other parts of the}} respiratory system of primates, insufficient to cause new infections. A number of studies examining airborne transmission broadly concluded that transmission from pigs to primates could happen without direct contact because, unlike humans and primates, pigs with EVD get very high ebolavirus concentrations in their lungs, and not their bloodstream. Therefore, pigs with EVD can spread the disease through droplets in the air or on the ground when they sneeze or cough. By contrast, humans and other primates accumulate the virus throughout their body and specifically in their blood, <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>very</b> much in their lungs. It is believed that this is the reason researchers have observed pig to primate transmission without physical contact, but no evidence has been found of primates being infected without actual contact, even in experiments where infected and uninfected primates shared the same air.|$|E

25|$|Potamogeton alpinus {{generally}} {{grows in}} neutral to mildly acid (<b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>very</b> base-poor) water bodies such as lakes, slow-moving rivers and streams, and ponds. P. alpinus needs a deep fine substrate such as sand, silt or peat to root in {{and appears to}} avoid exposed situations. It is, mainly restricted to fairly nutrient-poor waters. In European rivers, it is associated with high quality environments. In a large-scale study of the plant communities of 3447 British lakes, red pondweed was found in 169, with a preference for circumneutral, moderate alkalinity lakes. Unlike other broad-leaved pondweeds, the stolons of red pondweed die back in winter, leaving constellations of resting buds rooted in the substrate, which regrow in spring. In rivers, red pondweed can persist entirely by asexual means (rooting of stem fragments and turion-like resting bodies, and growth in summer) though this may reflect weed cutting suppressing flowering and seed set.|$|E

[...] epitomizing the [...] "hip exclusivity" [...] of the burgeoning counterculture.
