This article aims to analyze the position and role, assess the resource availability, discuss the geographic distribution, market scale and industry development, and present the policy options of biomass in China. The resource availability and geographical distribution of <b>biomass</b> <b>byproducts</b> are assessed in terms of crop residues, manure, forest and wood <b>biomass</b> <b>byproducts,</b> municipal waste and wastewater. The position of biomass use for power generation is just next to hydropower among types of renewable energy in China. The potential quantity of all <b>biomass</b> <b>byproducts</b> energy in 2004 is 3511 Mtce (Mtce is the abbreviation of million tons of coal equivalents and 1 Mtce is equal to 10 (6) tce.), while the acquirable quantity is 460 Mtce. Biomass energy plays a critical role in rural regions of China. The geographical distribution and quantity of <b>biomass</b> <b>byproducts</b> resources depends mainly on the relationship between ecological zones and climate conditions. Our estimation shows that the total quantity of crop residues, manure, forest and wood <b>biomass</b> <b>byproducts,</b> municipal waste and wastewater resources are 728, 3926, 2175, 155 and 48240 Mt (million tons), respectively. Crop residues come mainly from the provinces of Henan, Shandong, Heilongjiang, Jilin and Sichuan. All manure is mainly located in the provinces of Henan, Shandong, Sichuan, Hebei and Hunan. Forest and wood <b>biomass</b> <b>byproducts</b> are mainly produced in the provinces or autonomous regions of Tibet, Sichuan, Yunnan, Heilongjiang and Inner Mongolia, while most of municipal waste mainly comes from Guangdong, Shandong, Heilongjiang, Hubei and Jiangsu. Most of wastewater is largely discharged from advanced provinces like Guangdong, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Shandong and Henan. Biomass byproducts' energy distribution also varies from province to province in China. Based on the analysis of the market scale and industry development, the article argues that China's biomass energy industry is still at a very early stage of development and that Feed-in Tariffs (FIT) might be the best policy option for China to promote its development of biomass energy. A successful enforcement of FIT in China needs some policy combination of special capital subsidies, R&D funding, tax incentives and pricing...|$|R

40|$|Bio-ethanol has {{received}} considerable attention {{as a basic}} chemical and fuel additive. Bio-ethanol is presently produced from sugar/starch materials, but can also be produced from lignocellulosic biomass via hydrolysis-fermentation route or thermo-chemical route. In terms of thermo-chemical route, a few pilot plants ranging from 0. 3 to 67 Â MW have been built and operated for alcohols synthesis. However, commercial success has not been found. In order to realize cost-competitive commercial ethanol production from lignocellulosic biomass through thermo-chemical pathway, a techno-economic analysis needs to be done. In this paper, a thermo-chemical process is designed, simulated and optimized mainly with ASPEN Plus. The techno-economic assessment is made in terms of ethanol yield, synthesis selectivity, carbon and CO conversion efficiencies, and ethanol production cost. Calculated results show that major contributions to the production cost are from biomass feedstock and syngas cleaning. A biomass-to-ethanol plant should be built around 200 Â MW.

The work was divided in three areas, 1 -preparation and characterization of model catalysts containing metal oxide overcoats and metal nanoparticles synthesized by {{atomic layer deposition}} (ALD), a gas-phase material deposition technique, 2 -the study of structure sensitivity for formic acid decomposition on planar Pt catalysts, and 3 -characterization of bimetallic Pt-M (M = Re, Mo) catalysts using surface sensitive techniques and theory. ^ In the first project, metal oxide overcoats, which {{have been found to}} prevent metal nanoparticle deactivation via sintering and coking in biomass upgrading reactions, were prepared by ALD. In this work, model alumina-overcoated catalysts were synthesized by exposing Pd(111), Pt(111), and Cu(111) surfaces to trimethylaluminum at ca. 10 - 6 mbar and a co-reactant (H 2 O or O 2) at ca. 10 - 6 or 0. 1 mbar. Nominal Al coverages differed on each surface after saturation trimethylaluminum exposure (≥ 500 L) at 200 °C in the order Pd(111) (1. 4 ML) 3 ̆e Pt(111) (1. 0 ML) 3 ̆e Cu(111) (no Al), and Al alloyed only with Pd(111). Trimethylaluminum adsorbed on Cu 2 O-covered Cu(111), consuming adsorbed oxygen. Overlayer morphologies and adsorbed carbon species were found to be different on each surface, indicating that the interaction of trimethylaluminum with transition metal surfaces is substrate-dependent. Details of each reaction mechanism are discussed. Atomic layer deposition was also used for the synthesis of metallic nanoparticles. Dissociative adsorption sites for M(II) (M = Pd or Cu) hexafluoroacetylacetonates (hfac) on rutile TiO 2 (110) to form adsorbed (hfac) and M(hfac) were determined, and annealing this surface resulted in the formation of M nanoparticles. ^ In the second project, formic acid decomposition kinetics were evaluated on planar Pt catalysts.

However, the recirculating fish-microalgae IMTA system is under constant threat from fish pathogens and phytoplankton-lytic bacteria. Therefore, it is necessary to apply proper disinfectants as prophylaxis or treatment which are effective against these threats, but safe to fish and microalgae. For this purpose, peracetic acid (PAA) is a valid option because it is highly effective against fish pathogens and bacteria at low concentrations and degrades spontaneously to harmless residues. In the present study, we exposed the culture of a marine microalgae Tetraselmis chuii once per day for four days to four PAA products with differing hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) /PAA proportions at two concentrations (1 and 2  mg L− 1 PAA).

A worldwide problem has become the depletion of petrochemical fuels and the continuous rise in oil prize that call us to make a global effort {{in order to find}} alternative energetic sources. A gradual replacement of fossil fuels by renewable energy sources (i. e. biofuels) is needed. In this scenario the use of microalgae {{can be seen as a}} possible solution to the problem of global warming since this group of fast-growing unicellular organisms shows several advantages (widespread availability, absent competition with agricultural land, utilization of cheap and abundant nutrient sources, high oil and biomass yields, high quality of the <b>byproducts,</b> generation of <b>biomass</b> for biofuel production with concomitant CO 2 sequestration and suitability for wastewater treatments and other industrial plants) which make them one of the most promising and attractive renewable sources for a fully sustainable and lowcarbon economy portfolio. Despite this growing interest, the current microalgae-based technology is still not widespread since it is affected by technical and economic constraints that hinder its full scale-up. Therefore, great R&D efforts are currently undertaken to produce biodiesel at competitive costs and with the required quality starting from microalgae feedstock.

40|$|The {{demand for}} {{sustainable}} alternative fuels is ever-increasing {{in the power}} generation, transportation, and energy sectors due to the inherent non-sustainable characteristics and political constraints of current energy resources. A number of alternative fuels derived from cellulosic biomass, algae, or waste are being considered, along with the conversion of electricity to non-carbon fuels such as hydrogen or ammonia (NH 3). The latter is receiving attention recently {{because it is a}} non-carbon fuel that is readily produced in large quantities, stored and transported with current infrastructure, and is often a <b>byproduct</b> of <b>biomass</b> or waste conversion processes. However, pure or anhydrous ammonia combustion is severely challenging due to its high auto-ignition temperature (650 2 ̆ 6 degC), low reactivity, and tendency to promote NOx formation. As such, the present study focuses on two major aspects of the ammonia combustion. The first is an applied investigation of the potential to achieve pure NH 3 combustion with low levels of emissions in flames of practical interest. In this study, a swirl-stabilized flame typically used in fuel-oil home-heating systems is optimized for NH 3 combustion, and measurements of NO and NH 3 are collected {{for a wide range of}} operating conditions. The second major focus of this work is on fundamental investigation of NOx formation mechanisms in flames with high levels of NH 3 in H 2. For laminar premixed and diffusion jet flames, experimental measurements of flame speeds, exhaust-gas sampling, and in-situ NO measurements (NO PLIF) are compared with numerically predicted flames using complex chemical kinetics within CHEMKIN and reacting CFD codes i. e., UNICORN. From the preliminary testing of the NOx formation mechanisms, (1) Tian (2) Konnov and (3) GRI-Mech 3. 0 in laminar premixed H 2 /NH 3 flames, the Tian and Konnov mechanisms are found to capture the reduction in measured flame speeds with increasing NH 3 in the fuel mixture, both qualitatively and quantitatively. The NOx predictions by all the three chemical mechanisms are observed to be in fairly good agreement with the measured NOx, qualitatively, however predictions are found to be 3 to 4 times higher than the measurements for both lean and rich H 2 /NH 3 premixed flames. For laminar H 2 /NH 3 diffusion flames, detailed 2 -D comparisons of in-situ NO measurements with the 2 -D simulated NO using the Tian, GRI-Mech 3. 0 and modified GRI-Mech chemical mechanisms are performed and found to differ from the measured NO by approximately an order of magnitude. For NH 3 seeded H 2 /air diffusion flames, GRI-Mech 3. 0 seemed to overpredict NO by more than an order of magnitude and failed to capture the fundamental flame characteristics, such as the flame length variation with increasing NH 3 in the fuel mixture. On the other hand, the predicted NO profiles by the Tian mechanism were not only found to be in better agreement with the measured NO, but they also captured the in-flame NO distribution as well, both qualitatively and quantitatively. Overall, the Tian mechanism is found to be the superior chemical mechanism to capture the NOx formation chemistry in NH 3 seeded flames...|$|R
40|$|The {{contribution}} of aerosol absorption on direct radiative forcing {{is still an}} active area of research, in part, because aerosol extinction is dominated by light scattering and, in part, because the primary absorbing aerosol of interest, soot, exhibits complex aging behavior that alters its optical properties. The consequences {{of this can be}} evidenced by the work of Ramanathan and Carmichael (2008) who suggest that incorporating the atmospheric heating due to brown clouds (plumes containing soot <b>byproducts</b> from automobiles, <b>biomass</b> burning, wood-burning kitchen stoves, and coal-fired power plants) will increase black carbon (BC) radiative forcing from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change best estimate of 0. 34 Wm- 2 (± 0. 25 Wm- 2) (IPCC 2007) to 0. 9 Wm- 2. This noteworthy degree of uncertainty is due largely to the interdependence of BC optical properties on particle mixing state and aggregate morphology, each of which changes as the particle ages in the atmosphere and becomes encapsulated within a coating of inorganic and/or organic substances. In July 2008, a laboratory-based measurement campaign, led by Boston College and Aerodyne, was initiated to begin addressing this interdependence. To achieve insights into the interdependence of BC optical properties on particle mixing state and aggregate morphology, measurements of both the optical and physical properties of flame-generated soot under nascent, coated, and denuded conditions were conducted. This poster presents data on black carbon (BC) light absorption measured by Photothermal Interferometry (Sedlacek and Lee 2007). In addition to examining nascent BC—to provide a baseline measurement—encapsulation with varying thicknesses of either dioctyl sebacate (DOS) or sulfuric acid was conducted to glean insights into the interplay between particle mixing state and optical properties. Additionally, some experiments were carried out where BC was coated and then denuded. In the case of DOS-coated soot, a monotonic increase in light absorption to nearly 100 % is observed as a function of DOS coating thickness. This observation is consistent with a coating-induced amplification in particle light absorption (Bond et al. 2006). In contrast, light absorption by sulfuric acid-coated soot displays unexpectedly complex behavior where the degree of amplification appears to be dependent upon the underlying soot core diameter...|$|R

The algae-to-biofuel venture was segmented into three modules: algal cultivation, lipid extraction and lipid processing. Each module was studied thoroughly and several strategies were proposed for the reduction of its associated fixed, capital and variable costs. As contrasted with a previous study, it was concluded that heterotrophic algal cultivation and transesterification lipid- processing technologies would improve the efficiency and reduce the total capital investment. Once each module was designed in detail, the three segments were stitched together to perform an overall economic analysis. Based on the current market price of $ 3. 30 per gallon for pure biodiesel, a project life of 15 years, and a 15 % discount rate, the results indicate that an algae-to- biodiesel process may not only be profitable, but also a sound and reasonable investment. The project’s projected Net Present Value (NPV) is $ 1. 3 billion and the Return on Investment (ROI) was determined to be 32 %. Although these economic results are promising, they are based on an analysis that necessarily invoked highly uncertain postulates in the dearth of published data. For example, the kinetics used to model the lipid-processing module were based on data collected for palm oil at similar conditions, while the details of lipid-extraction energy usage for a high-density slurry were approximated on the basis of results for low-density slurry. Furthermore, it was concluded that the income from the sale of the algal <b>biomass</b> <b>byproduct</b> of lipid-extraction is a critical factor in the profitability. Based on its protein content, this report considered the use of algal biomass as animal feed and determined its economic worth accordingly. However, to ensure the economic success of biodiesel production, an additional analysis should focus on algal usage of biomass as a feedstock and confirm the safety of its use. Further analyses could examine other potential applications for the byproduct, including opportunities within the pharmaceutical and power generation industries. Overall, in order to convince investors that the attractive economics published in this report may be translated into actual earnings, it is critical to move beyond modeling. Pilot studies must be conducted in order to bolster the proposed algae-to-biodiesel venture with experimental data and identify possible pitfalls...|$|R
40|$|There is {{a growing}} {{interest}} in efficient ways to use biomass for the substitution of fossil fuels and non-biomass materials. Wood-based building material can affect the energy and carbon balances through at least four mechanisms: the relatively low fossil energy needed to manufacture wood products compared with alternative materials; the avoidance of industrial process carbon emissions; the increased availability of biofuels from <b>biomass</b> <b>byproducts</b> {{that can be used}} to replace fossil fuels; and the physical storage of carbon in wood building materials. Increased use of wood-based building materials will likely affect relative prices on timber markets. That translates into changed forest management, which in turn affects forest growth, biofuel availability and mitigation through carbon storage in the forest. A more comprehensive analysis of the climate effects of increased wood in the construction sector would be made possible by integrating a range of models. These include models of wood substitution, sector product markets, and forest management models on regional and stand levels. Several partial studies have been conducted in this field. Still, a modeling framework that extends all the way from the construction sector over international markets down to the individual forest stand has not been employed. The purpose of this study is twofold. One is the analysis of climatic implications of increased wood use in building construction. For this purpose, a new integrated modeling framework is developed (see Figure 1). This framework is then used for the analysis of four different wood construction scenarios. The other objective of the current pilot project is to demonstrate the viability of the proposed modeling approach and the improvements needed. Thus, it constitutes a preparation for more comprehensive future studies. The four wood construction scenarios depict wood consumption up to the year 2030 for the European construction sector. They are characterized as follows: • Base: “Business-as-usual” corresponding to a growth rate of total European softwood sawn wood consumption estimated at 1. 48 % annually up to 2030. (The results of the other scenarios are measured against the Base scenario.) • Sweden: Wood is used instead of conventional concrete construction for building apartment blocks in Europe, gradually increasing to 1 million flats per year by 2030. The construction data are from a case study of a building constructed in Växjö, Sweden. • Finland: The same as case Sweden, but using construction data from a case study of a building in Helsinki, Finland. • 1 m 3 cap: Consumption of sawn wood in all European countries will reach 1. 0 m 3 per capita by 2030 (from the current average of 0. 2 m 3 per capita), corresponding to a European growth rate of 7 % per year. This is a rather extreme and probably unrealistic scenario. Table 1 summarizes the effects at year 2030, i. e. the last year of the projection period. The emission reduction figures are based on computations for all materials composing the buildings. The emission balance takes account of (i) fossil fuel combustion for material processing and logistics, (ii) reduction of emissions due to replacing fossil fuel with biomass residues from harvest, processing and demolition, (iii) avoided emissions from cement process reactions, and (iv) carbon stock change in wood materials. The marginal energy is assumed to be coal. It should be noted that the impact on carbon stocks in the forests is not included in the emission balance; this effect is assessed by the forest models (see below). The roundwood demand in each year of the projection period was distributed among supplying countries by the EFI-GTM model. The EFI-GTM is a partial equilibrium model for the forest sector, i. e. it encompasses forestry, wood using industries, markets for round wood and forest industry products, and solves the market clearing problem by consumers' and producers' surplus maximization. The global market consists here of 55 regions, where almost all the European countries are represented by their own regions. The model contains markets for 34 forest sector commodities (25 forest industry products, five types of roundwood and chips, and four types of waste paper). For each region, supply functions for production factors are defined, as well as a set of fixed-input technologies with specific capacities for producing intermediate and final products. The forest supply is represented by supply elasticities for timber and pulpwood. The Swedish roundwood supply is described with an elasticity of 0. 5 for both timber and pulpwood, based on runs with the Swedish regional forest model in this study. The model predicts that competition over the wood fibre increases in the future, and the prices of both pulpwood and saw logs rose in the Base case. Also, the Russian timber export tariff increases the prices in Scandinavia. In the Base case, the prices for softwood saw logs are projected to be 30 % higher, and pulpwood prices 54 % higher, in 2030 than in 2004. Note, however, that these increases can be considered a high estimate, since, for technical reasons, we chose to accept a higher rate of forest industry capacity accumulation than what we would have chosen in some other analyses. Table 2 shows the changes in Swedish harvest volumes and price changes in the scenarios Finland, Sweden and 1 m 3 cap, compared to the Base case, in year 2030. The scenario Sweden had the lowest market impacts, with the softwood saw log price being about 3 % up from the Base case level in 2030. In scenario 1 m 3 cap, the saw log price more than doubled from the Base case due to the drastically increased softwood lumber demand. The growth in softwood lumber production made saw log chips supply abundant and led to a decline in the pulpwood harvests and price. In scenario 1 m 3 cap, softwood pulpwood price came down by close to 20 % compared to the Base. Due to the substitution effect in panel production, the hardwood pulpwood price also fell. Either harvest volumes or timber prices for Sweden could then be transferred from the EFI-GTM to the Swedish forest regional model. In this analysis prices were put in the forest regional model and the ensuing result studied. For the forest regional model for Sweden, the SMAC model was used. The model is an area matrix model where harvests are derived by assuming that forest owners maximize their net present value over an infinite horizon with current prices (i. e. they assume constant prices; solution procedure is value iteration on the Markov model). Since the SMAC model operates with 5 -year growth periods, prices from EFI-GTM were averaged over 5 -year periods. Comparisons between EFI-GTM and SMAC of harvest volumes were only conducted for Base and 1 m 3 cap since price figures for scenarios Sweden and Finland are almost identical with the Base scenario. The saw log volumes of the two models are fairly similar for each of the scenarios over the first 10 years. However, for scenario 1 m 3 cap during the rest of the period, where the EFI-GTM projects a substantial increase, the SMAC model presents a reduced harvest of saw logs despite a rather dramatic increase in saw log price. The reason for this reduction is essentially that it is profitable, with relatively more profitability in final felling compared with thinning, to postpone final harvests and increase both the relative and absolute yield of timber in the future. In the long run, after some 60 years, saw log supply became larger for 1 m 3 cap than Base in the SMAC model projection. More detailed analyses of the management implications of the EFI-GTM price series were performed with a stand model, the Stand Management Assistant (SMA). SMA is an individual-tree, distance-independent growth and mortality model that finds optimal steady state stand management programs (planting density, timing and form of thinning and time of final harvest) by solving a non-linear, non-differentiable optimization problem with the Hooke and Jeeves method. The differences between scenarios Base and 1 m 3 cap were studied for a range of stand types. In most cases the model predicted for 1 m 3 cap: prolongation of the rotation period, increased number of thinnings, increased planting density, increased average standing volume, increased saw log production, reduction of pulpwood production, and increased average carbon stock. The effects were more pronounced on more fertile sites than in poorer sites, and more for spruce than for pine stands. The qualitative results from the SMAC and SMA models are more or less in agreement. Differences in the results can be attributed to the fact that stand establishment cannot change in the SMAC model, contrary to the SMA model, something which the SMA model shows has considerable influence on the design of the optimal management program. On the practical side the results indicate the following: • An increase of wood framed buildings would reduce net carbon emissions in the construction sector. The total net effect was not quantified because the changes could not be traced down to the forest. • The changes in the price relations between sawnwood and pulpwood of the EFI-GTM lead in the forest regional model to a change in the management programs towards prolonged rotations, leading to a medium term reduction of sawnwood supply. • The long term steady state analyses indicate small differences in carbon stock due to the price increases predicted by the scenarios. Sawnwood output increases, but is in most cases balanced by a similar reduction of pulpwood output. Rotations are prolonged and for several stand types the number of thinning is increased. The modeling system in this report represents an ambitious effort to combine models from different disciplines into one coherent system. It is no surprise that several gaps, overlaps and missing links have been detected. The following more general experiences were gained: • Linking the wood construction scenarios with the EFI-GTM, however demanding, works without major problems. The resulting demand for sawnwood can be distributed among countries by the EFI-GTM model in consistency with the construction scenarios. • The most problematic part of the system appears to be the linkage between the EFI-GTM and the forest regional model. In particular, the reaction of supply stemming from different price relations between sawnwood and pulpwood needs to harmonized. The SMAC model gives lower harvest volumes in Sweden in the first 2 - 3 decades compared to the EFI-GTM results because, seen from the forestry side, it is more profitable to postpone harvest given the assumed increase in saw log prices. To avoid this difference between EFI-GTM and the SMAC results one could run SMAC with both prices and volumes of saw logs and pulpwood fixed until 2030 according to the EFI-GTM results, so that only the forest management (silviculture and harvesting operations) are decided endogenously. It would also be advantageous to have the same temporal resolution in both models. • None of the models – the sector, regional or stand model – explicitly include biofuels. Given the growing importance of the biofuel market it would be desirable to adjust the models such that one could study the effects of changing demand and supply relations on economic indicators and forest management activities. • The detailed stand level model and the regional forest model could be better integrated with each other. • The overall consistency relies on a number of common parameters that are used in the different models, such as carbon emission factors and discount rates. They need keen attention to ensure consistency...|$|R
