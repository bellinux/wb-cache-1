An example for six products is considered, where the total production capacity on regular time is inadequate, so that overtime has to be used at an extra cost. A simple method is described for solving this problem when each product is produced once during a production cycle, the objective being to minimize the total set-up and holding costs per day. Schedules which involve batch splitting can reduce these costs further, and a guideline is proposed for the construction of sub-cycles.

40|$|A problem {{relating}} to the manufacture of automotive body panels concerns the appropriate choice of production size or <b>batch</b> <b>quantity</b> of a body panel production run that ensures a minimum inventory profile is maintained while not compromising production efficiency. Due to underlying variation within the body panel production process {{it is difficult to}} determine a relationship between the <b>batch</b> <b>quantity</b> and production efficiency. This thesis determines the appropriate production batch size through the creation of an iterative modelling methodology that initially examines the nature of the variation within the panel production process. Further iterations of the methodology apply appropriate analytical modelling methods until a satisfactory solution is achieved. The modelling construction is designed so that it is potentially applicable to a wider range of manufacturing problems. As there is variation inherent within the system, regression analysis, experimental design (traditional and Taguchi) are considered. Since an objective of creating the modelling methodology is the potential of apply the methodology to a wider variety of manufacturing problems, additional modelling methods are assessed. These include the operational research methods of mathematical programming (linear and non-linear and dynamic programming) and queuing systems. To model discrete and continuous behaviour of a manufacturing system, the application of hybrid automata is considered. Thus a suite of methodologies are assessed that assess variation, optimisation and networks of manufacturing systems. Through the iterative stages of the modelling approach, these analytical methods can be applied as appropriate to converge on to the appropriate solution for the problem under investigation. The appropriate methods identified to quantify a relationship between the batch production quantity and production efficiency include regression modelling and traditional experimental design. The conclusion drawn from the application of both methods is that relative to the inherent variation present in the production system, lower batch quantities can be chosen for production runs without affecting the production performance. Consequently, a minimum inventory profile can be maintained satisfying the objective of a lean system...|$|E

40|$|The {{multi-product}} single machine {{scheduling problem}} is not new in the literature. The usual method of solution offered consists of determining the Economic Batch Quantities (EBQ) and then finding an acceptable way of scheduling these quantities on the single facility. However, past experience shows that EBQs cannot be scheduled in the same solution because of some limitations, mostly when a product produced earlier has run out of stock. Eventually, an acceptable <b>batch</b> <b>quantity</b> has to be selected that will satisfy a set of given conditions or objectives. Before calculating the EBQ, it is generally necessary to determine the main cost factors, namely, the set up cost of the machine and the inventory holding cost of the product. A case study is described in this paper, in which the scheduling was carried out without the determination of these costs. However, deviations from this solution {{may have to be}} considered. A simple way of calculating the costs incurred by such deviations is described. batch production scheduling inventory control...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{considers}} a periodic-review, two-echelon inventory system with one central warehouse and several retailers facing stochastic demand. The retailers replenish their stock from the warehouse, {{which in turn}} places orders at an outside supplier with infinite capacity. Transportation times and costs are constant. No ordering costs are considered, but warehouse replenishments must be multiples of a given <b>batch</b> <b>quantity.</b> The objective is to find policies that minimize holding and backorder costs. The standard approach to approximately solve this problem {{is to use a}} "balance" assumption, meaning that negative stock allocations to the retailers are possible. This approach may lead to considerable errors for problems with large differences between the retailers in terms of service requirements and demand characteristics. To handle such situations we suggest and evaluate two computationally tractable heuristics: the Virtual Assignment ordering rule for warehouse replenishments and the Two-step Allocation rule for allocating stock from the warehouse to the retailers. Numerical evidence shows that, especially when combining these heuristics, we obtain considerable improvements for many problems over the standard approach. Savings of up to 50 % have been recorded.

Experience had shown that farmers could hardly make the cost of production from their sales. Also, grain losses are high when maize is harvested green. To minimize grain losses and thereby increase value and the profit margin of the farmer, a grain dryer is necessary for wet grains. Therefore, this paper presents the design and development of a batch in-bin maize grain dryer. Some properties of maize such as moisture content and bulk density were determined to get information required for design of the dryer. The dimension of drying chamber, amount of moisture to be removed in a <b>batch,</b> <b>quantity</b> of air required to effect drying, volume of air required to effect drying, blower capacity, quantity of heat required to effect drying and actual heat used to effect drying were all designed for.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} an imperfect production system which produces good and defective items {{and assume that}} defective items can be reworked. Due {{to the nature of}} rework process we do not restrict the rework rate to be equal to normal production rate or constant and assume that it is a random variable with an arbitrary distribution function. We also assume as it is true in most real world situation that the unit rework processing cost need not to be equal to unit normal processing cost. We consider the case in which during a specified period of time consisting of several cycles the rework process takes place only in its last cycle. For practical reasons such as the ease of production scheduling and resource planning we require that the length of the last cycle must have the same length as the other cycles of this period. For this purpose we assume in the last cycle of this period first the normal production starts after which the rework of all defective units produced in the period begins. After {{the end of the last}} cycle of the period the whole process will start all over again. Further we assume that, for reduction of set up cost for rework per unit time, the total number of setups for rework must be as small as possible. For this system we derive the expected total cost function consisting of inventory holding, waiting time of defectives for rework, setup, and processing costs per unit time.

40|$|Modern injection-moulding {{machinery}} {{which produces}} several, pairs of plastic footwear {{at a time}} brought increased production planning problems to a factory. The demand for its footwear is seasonal but the company's manning policy keeps a fairly constant production level thus determining the aggregate stock. Production planning must therefore be done within the limitations of a specified total stock. The thesis proposes a new production planning system with four subsystems. These are sales forecasting, resource planning, and two levels of production scheduling: (a) aggregate decisions concerning the 'manufacturing group' (group of products) to be produced in each machine each week, and (b) detailed decisions concerning the products within a manufacturing group to be scheduled into each mould-place. The detailed scheduling is least dependent on improvements elsewhere so the sub-systems were tackled in reverse order. The thesis concentrates on the production scheduling sub-systems which will provide most. of the benefits. The aggregate scheduling solution depends principally on the aggregate stocks of each manufacturing group and their division into 'safety stocks' (to prevent shortages) and 'freestocks' (to permit batch production). The problem is too complex for exact solution but a good heuristic solution, which {{has yet to be}} implemented, is provided by minimising graphically immediate plus expected future costs. The detailed problem splits into determining the optimal safety stocks and batch quantities given the appropriate aggregate stocks. It. is found that the optimal safety stocks are proportional to the demand. The ideal batch quantities are based on a modified, formula for the Economic <b>Batch</b> <b>Quantity</b> and the product schedule is created week by week using a priority system which schedules to minimise expected future costs. This algorithm performs almost optimally. The detailed scheduling solution was implemented and achieved the target savings for the whole project in favourable circumstances.
