40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. This paper {{describes}} a fundamental rethinking of {{the basis for}} the evaluation of the sunlight potential of spaces. It aims to provide a methodology to answer the question: how much sunlight can enter a room? The measure proposed is the cross-sectional area of sunlight beam that: (a) passes through a window; and, (b) enters the main volume of the internal space. The new measure – called the sunlight <b>beam</b> <b>index</b> – is described, and examples are given for a realistic residential house.

40|$|This {{paper was}} {{presented}} at PLEA 2017. This paper describes a back-to-basics rethinking for quantifying the sunlight and skylight potential of building apertures. The recently formulated sunlight <b>beam</b> <b>index</b> (SBI) approach has been conflated with a complementary metric called the aperture skylight index (ASI). The sunlight <b>beam</b> <b>index</b> {{is a measure of}} an aperture’s ‘connectedness’ to all of the annually occurring possible sun positions where sunlight can be incident on the aperture. In a complementary fashion, the aperture skylight index is a measure of an aperture’s ‘connectedness’ to the hemispherical sky vault. In the absence of any localised shading/obstructions, the sunlight <b>beam</b> <b>index</b> depends on the location, orientation (i. e. azimuth angle), aspect (i. e. zenith angle) and size of the aperture. The SBI is the cumulative measure of the cross-sectional area of sunbeam that can pass through a window aperture. In contrast, the ASI depends only on the size and aspect of the aperture in addition to shading/obstructions – it has no dimensions of time and it is not dependent on the azimuth orientation of the aperture relative to the hemisphere of sky. Obstruction of the aperture’s ‘connectedness’ to either the sky or the entirety of possible sun positions can be due to: features integral to the facade (e. g. external window reveal); shading devices; or, any external structures. The effect of obstructions, whatever their origin or complexity, is automatically accounted for in the computation of the indices – the only requirement is that they are included in the 3 D model of the scene. The approach provides designers and product specifiers with an intuitively simple “aperture rating system” to evaluate and compare the in-situ performance of building apertures in combination with any shading system. Application of the rating system is demonstrated for a residential dwelling...|$|E

We reached a double-ended output power of 16. 8 W from the free-running laser.

40|$|Abstract—Driving {{piezoelectric}} actuators by charge, {{or current}} rather than voltage {{is known to}} significantly reduce the hysteretic nature of these actuators. Although this feature of piezoelectric transducers {{has been known to}} the researchers for some time, still voltage amplifiers are being used as the main driving mechanism for piezoelectric devices. This is due to the perceived difficulty in building charge/current amplifiers capable of driving highly capacitive loads such as piezoelectric actuators. Recently, a new charge amplifier has been proposed which is ideal for driving piezoelectric loads used in applications such as active damping of vibration. Consequently, it is now possible to effectively, and accurately control the charge deposited on the electrodes of a piezoelectric transducer, and thereby avoid hysteresis alto-gether. This paper further investigates properties of piezoelectric transducers driven by charge sources when used with resonant controllers for structural vibration control applications.

The energy and angular distributions of ions at different locations along the hole sidewall showed that ions which neutralize on the top section of the surface of the hole are “bad, ” in the sense that these ions yield divergent neutral beams of relatively low energy. Ions that neutralize along the bottom section of the hole sidewall are “good, ” in the sense that these ions yield neutral beams that are less divergent and retain more of the energy of the parent ions.

Usually, 3 -D measurement by robot vision techniques is executed under the assumptions that cameras and objects are in aerial environments. However, an image distortion occurs when vision sensors measure objects in liquid. It {{is caused by the}} refraction of the light on the boundary between the air and the liquid, and the distorted image brings errors in a triangulation for the range measurement. Our proposed method can measure accurate 3 -D coordinates of objects ’ surfaces in liquid taken for calculating the refraction effect. The effectiveness of the proposed method is shown through experiments. By considering the refraction of the light, the accuracy of the 3 -D measurement of objects in water becomes same as that when there is no water, although the accuracy is bad when the refraction of the light is not considered. The accuracy of the 3 -D measurement is about 1 mm for objects located about 400 mm from the laser range finder.

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we present}} a {{detailed}} analysis of the iterative phase retrieval approach (IPRA) for determining the phase profile of the output microwave beam of a gyrotron from known intensity patterns emphasizing the field propagation techniques which are used to propagate the RF field of the microwave beam between known intensity planes. The propagation method, based on first Rayleigh–Sommerfeld diffraction integral (RSDI), is solved using fast Fourier transform (FFT) technique and zero padding. It is observed that the use of FFT and, therefore, the discretization of the RSDI propagation kernel introduce aberrations in the propagated field due to the superposition of the original field with its replicated versions. This problem is solved by approximations leading to the Huygens–Fresnel propagation method which further imposes the restrictions on the distances of propagation {{depending on the size of}} the transverse plane used to discretize the intensity pattern. This constraint of the distance of propagation causes problem in the iterative phase retrieval approach (IPRA) when more than two intensity planes are used. A method based on interpolation is proposed to overcome this restriction. IPRA is then further discussed to optimize several parameters, such as plane separation, plane dimension, mesh size, and measurement accuracies, which become more of an issue during the measurements of infrared intensity thermograms of the output microwave <b>beam.</b> <b>Index</b> Terms—Fourier transform, gyrotron, infrared intensity thermogram, millimeter wave, phase retrieval, zero padding.

In this work, the factors contributing to the variance on the signals are investigated, and their effects on the energy, time and spatial resolutions are analyzed. Good agreement was found between a model of the energy reso-lution and experiments with a 20 10 10 mm LYSO:Ce crystal coupled to a single channel large-area APD (LAAPD). With the same crystal coupled to an APD array, differences between model and experiment were observed at high APD gain. The measured energy resolution of % FWHM was domi-nated by scintillation photon statistics, with less important roles for the APD excess noise factor and electronic noise. On the other hand, electronic noise was an important factor both for the time and the spatial resolutions. The time resolution was found to depend strongly on the APD bias voltage, and was best at the highest bias. A time resolution of 1. 6 ns full width at half max-imum (FWHM) was measured against a BaF-PMT detector.

30|$|Unlike {{previous}} {{works in the}} literature, we focus on more practical coordinated beamforming transmission schemes for dual-cell MIMO systems based on random beamforming in this paper. For MIMO systems with random beamforming, {{in order to achieve}} good performance, proper user selection is essential. That also applies to coordinated beamforming transmission. To limit the amount of overhead signal between BSs and minimize the additional burden to the back haul connections, we consider the user selection schemes that exchange no or limited amount of control information to achieve coordinated beamforming. Specifically, we present and study selfish random beamforming (SRB), interference-aware random beamforming (IA-RB), both of which require no information exchange between cells, and random beamforming with limited coordination (LC-RB), where only the selected <b>beam</b> <b>index</b> is shared among BSs. We would {{like to point out that}} some of these schemes have already been discussed in certain standard activities, such as 3 GPP framework [18]. Instead of asymptotic analysis according to most of the literature, which assumes that the number of users is very large, our contribution is to accurately quantify their performance through statistical analysis. We firstly derive the exact analytical expression for the sum-rate of the resulting systems assuming that all the users are located along the cell boundary and average intercell interference power at mobile users can be considered approximately identical. Selected numerical examples show that LC-RB can offer significant sum-rate capacity gain with low system complexity. During the sum-rate performance analysis, we develop the exact statistics of users' SINRs based on some new statistic results of projection norm squares, which can be broadly applied into the performance analysis of other related systems.|$|E
