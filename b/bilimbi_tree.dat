50|$|The <b>bilimbi</b> <b>tree</b> reaches 5-10 m in height. Its trunk {{is short}} and quickly divides up into ramifications. Bilimbi leaves, 3-6 cm long, are {{alternate}}, imparipinnate and cluster at branch extremities. There are around 11 to 37 alternate or subopposite oblong leaflets. The leaves are quite {{similar to those of}} the Otaheite gooseberry. The trunk and branches of tree has to be exposed to sunlight for fruits to form (traditional knowledge), which is achieved by removing leaves except from branch end.|$|E
50|$|The Phyllanthus acidus is an {{intermediary}} between a shrub and tree, reaching 2 to 9 m (6Â½ to 30 ft) high. The tree's dense and bushy crown {{is composed of}} thickish, tough main branches, {{at the end of}} which are clusters of deciduous, greenish, 15-to-30-cm long branchlets. The branchlets bear alternate leaves that are ovate or lanceolate in form, with short petioles and pointed ends. The leaves are 2-7.5 cm long and thin, they are green and smooth on the upperside and blue-green on the underside. In general, the Otaheite gooseberry tree very much looks like the <b>bilimbi</b> <b>tree.</b>|$|E
50|$|Averrhoa bilimbi (commonly {{known as}} <b>bilimbi,</b> {{cucumber}} <b>tree,</b> or tree sorrel) is a fruit-bearing tree {{of the genus}} Averrhoa, family Oxalidaceae. It is a close relative of carambola tree.|$|R
40|$|<b>Bilimbi</b> or {{cucumber}} <b>tree</b> {{often be}} used from almost {{all parts of}} the plant as a traditional medicine. In addition, people often use the leaves as a material for insects, especially to make flies away from food. The information of local knowledge that bilimbi leaves contains insect control. The {{purpose of this study was}} to control of subterranean termites attack using extract of bilimbi (Averrhoa bilimbi L) leaves. The powder of the plant leaves was extracted using ethanol solution. The extracts were then prepared in different concentrations, namely 2 %, 4 %, and 6 %. Paper discs with 25 mm diameter were immersed in the each of the concentration. The other treated paper discs used chlorpyrifos as positive treatment. Untreated paper discs were also prepared as control. In this study, only one of tests were applied, which were contact poison. The effectiveness of the extract was determined based on the termite mortality and weight loss of the paper discs. Results showed that treatment has a very significant effect on the value of mortality. Treatment of various concentrations of bilimbi leaf extract significantly different from the control and termiticide. Treatment of bilimbi leaf extract concentration and termitisida show 100 % mortality whereas control only amounted to 23. 64 %...|$|R
