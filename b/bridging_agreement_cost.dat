Contingency generally refers to initial contingency amount estimated before bidding and {{will be included in}} original contract. Premium cost also will be issued to pay non-value additional works. As a result, additional works, which also refers to change orders, are paid mainly by initial contingency, supplemental <b>agreements</b> and premium <b>cost.</b> This paper mainly aims to compare initial amount of contingency to later investment paid for change orders by means of supplemental <b>agreements</b> or premium <b>cost.</b> If estimation of initial contingency is rather precise, even the initial contingency is high and will increases the original contract amount, it might still be beneficial to projects because it eliminates the cost-related influence caused by unforeseen additional works paid by fund prepared as contingency in advance.

40|$|Transaction costs {{analysis}} {{is concerned with}} ways of aligning appropriate governance modes with the attributes of economic transactions. Nowadays transaction costs are universally accepted, despite the difficulty in measuring and quantifying them. Starting from the customary definition of transaction costs, this paper proposes {{a model for the}} buyer/seller relationship, focusing on the uncertainty characterizing the exchange and the connected costs. In particular, according to a well-known classification, the transaction costs connected to the purchasing phase are divided into ex ante (drafting and negotiating agreements) and ex post (monitoring and enforcing <b>agreements)</b> <b>costs.</b> More precisely, we propose to employ appropriate deterministic models for evaluating ex ante costs and suitable statistical distributions for ex post costs. Obviously, both such costs categories require the quantification of several parameters related to the buyer operating the transaction and to the uncertainty characterizing the buyer/seller relationship.

40|$|This study {{evaluates the}} impact of pre-discovery {{licensing}} on innovation and product market efficiency. Pre-discovery licensing {{is a form of}} R&D cooperation between firms, which accounts for more than 95 % of all research collaborations. Pre-discovery licensing is pursued independently between firms, i. e., without governmental support. In contrast, in a research joint venture firms cooperate in R&D, as they usually seek protection and support from government enacted laws and programs which gives rise to selection problems. Despite existing work on research joint ventures, there has been little work on pre-discovery licensing. The estimation results of our dynamic count data model show that pre-discovery licensing reduces innovative activity. We continue to estimate a semi-structural model, which provides evidence that pre-discovery licensing <b>agreements</b> increase <b>costs</b> in the product market. Our results show that pre-discovery licensing increased the price of a semiconductor chip by $ 0. 225. Hence, consumers paid a total amount of $ 1. 6 billion more per year {{due to the fact that}} pre-discovery licensing <b>agreements</b> increase <b>costs.</b> Our findings stand in contrast to the empirical findings on research joint ventures, emphasizing the notion that selection is a critical argument which causes different results...|$|R

Wisconsin's dairy industry benefited from expansion of dry whey and lactose exports under the URWTO <b>agreement.</b> <b>Costs</b> under the complex agreement included an unanticipated increase in milk protein concentrate (MPC) imports.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{international cooperation}} on technological development {{as an alternative}} to international cooperation on GHG emission reductions. It is assumed that when countries cooperate they coordinate their investments so as to minimize the <b>agreement</b> <b>costs</b> of controlling emissions and that they also pool their R&D efforts so as to fully internalize the spillover effects of their investments in R&D. In order to analyze the scope of cooperation, an agreement formation game is solved in three stages. First, countries {{decide whether or not to}} sign the agreement. Then, in the second stage, signatories (playing together) and non-signatories (playing individually) select their investment in R&D. Finally, in the third stage, each country decides its level of emissions non-cooperatively. For linear environmental damages and quadratic investment costs, our findings show that the maximum participation in a R&D agreement consists of six countries and that participation decreases as the coalition information exchange decreases until a minimum participation consisting of three countries is reached. We also find that the grand coalition is stable if the countries sign an international research joint venture but in this case the effectiveness of the agreement is very low...|$|R

40|$|Recommendations and Guiding Principles as necessary. Section III of the 1999 report, {{entitled}} “Improving Market Practices and Conventions, ” {{focused on}} three broad areas: improvements in documentation policies and practices, {{with a special}} emphasis on timelines; improvements in documentation content, with special attention to close-out and valuation issues and the basis risk arising from inconsistencies in standard forms of industry documentation; and improvements in collateral management practices. The recommendations shared two common goals: to improve a creditor’s {{ability to deal with}} failing counterparties in a timely manner, and to enhance the market’s ability to contain the risks of failures of large, leveraged participants. The 1999 report led to the establishment of the Global Documentation Steering Committee, whose mission is to implement the documentation-related recommendations contained in Section III. In particular, the GDSC’s objective is to carry out the CRMPG’s 1999 mandate by minimizing ”documentation basis risk ” — the risk that market, credit and legal risk will be exacerbated by disparities in documentation — in the over-thecounter markets. Much progress has been made since 1999, but much remains to be done. First, a suite of robust, contractual tools to reduce documentation basis risk has been developed. These tools include recommendations made by the GDSC as part of its documentation harmonization efforts, the development of the Bond Market Association’s Cross-product Master Agreements and the publication of the 2002 ISDA Master Agreement and the 2001 ISDA <b>Bridge</b> <b>Agreement.</b> Although these contractual tool...|$|R
40|$|The {{restructuring}} of health systems {{and health care}} agencies, particularly large public hospitals, has been occurring {{for more than a}} decade in Australia. Similar reformist movements have been observed internationally and the experiences of countries such as the United Kingdom, New Zealand, Canada and the United States have had the most influence on Australian approaches to reform (Davis 1999, Hall 1999). Underlying many of the reforms has been the premise that a new balance is required to ensure that the operation of the health system serves the needs of patients (customers/clients) rather than the needs and aspirations of the health professions. At a systems level these reforms have resulted in internal market reforms typically organised around a split between purchasers (acting as the agent of patients) and providers (health professionals) (Duckett 1995). New social and economic relationships emerge in such a system where resource allocation based on professional judgement and autonomy is usurped by a system based on contracts, service <b>agreements,</b> <b>cost</b> containment and performance audits.
