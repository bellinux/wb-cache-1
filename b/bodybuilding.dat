5|$|Roughly spherical eggs of {{different}} animals {{give rise to}} extremely different bodies, from jellyfish to lobsters, butterflies to elephants. Many of these organisms share the same structural genes for <b>bodybuilding</b> proteins like collagen and enzymes, but biologists had expected that each group of animals would have its own rules of development.

The giraffe {{does not have a}} gene for a long neck, any more than the elephant has a gene for a big body. Their bodies are patterned by a system of switching which causes development {{of different}} features to begin earlier or later, to occur in this or that part of the embryo, and to continue for more or less time.|$|E
