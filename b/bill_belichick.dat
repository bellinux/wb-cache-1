5|$|<b>Bill</b> <b>Belichick</b> {{achieved}} his 200th career {{head coaching}} win (regular season and playoffs) on November 22, 2012, defeating the Jets 49–19; {{it was his}} 163rd such win as Patriots coach. The Patriots defeated the Jets in Week seven of the 2015 season by a score of 30–23, {{to give them a}} 6–0 record to date.|$|E
5|$|After leaving LSU, Mitchell {{was hired}} as {{defensive}} line coach of the Cleveland Browns of the National Football League (NFL) in 1991. He coached for the Browns under head coach <b>Bill</b> <b>Belichick</b> for three seasons, helping to develop Michael Dean Perry (who twice made the Pro Bowl in Mitchell's three seasons with the team) and Rob Burnett (who made his only Pro Bowl in Mitchell's final year with the club).|$|E
5|$|Nick Saban {{resigned}} as Toledo's head coach on February 13, 1991, after one season to become defensive {{coordinator of the}} National Football League's Cleveland Browns under <b>Bill</b> <b>Belichick.</b> As defensive coordinator for the New York Giants, Belichick had to postpone assembling his new coaching staff until after Super Bowl XXV. Therefore, Saban's resignation wasn't announced until well after the season had ended. Additionally, Saban wanted any potential move to occur after February 6, National Signing Day for recruits.|$|E
50|$|With {{the huge}} loss, the Jets fell to 4-7, and were swept by <b>Bill</b> <b>Belichick's</b> Patriots {{for the sixth}} time.|$|R
50|$|On January 3, 2008, the NFL {{announced}} McCarthy {{finished second}} in voting for The Associated Press 2007 NFL Coach of the Year, garnering 15 votes to <b>Bill</b> <b>Belichick's</b> leading 29 votes.|$|R
50|$|This {{game would}} be the {{pinnacle}} of <b>Bill</b> <b>Belichick's</b> tenure as defensive coordinator; his game plan, a radical scheme designed to maximize punishment of the Bills receivers now resides in the Pro Football Hall of Fame.|$|R
5|$|Despite being {{advised to}} retire several {{times by the}} doctor who worked on his knee, Bavaro managed to secure a {{contract}} in 1992 with the Cleveland Browns, who were coached by former Giants assistant coach <b>Bill</b> <b>Belichick.</b> He played one season for the Browns and managed to appear in all 16 games. After the season, he signed with the Philadelphia Eagles. He played in all 16 games again and had 43 receptions, 481yards, and 6 touchdowns in 1993. After playing one more season for the Eagles he retired in 1995 {{at the age of}} 31. Bavaro finished his nine NFL seasons with 351 receptions for 4,733yards and 39 touchdowns.|$|E
5|$|The 1990 season {{marked the}} end of an era. After the Super Bowl, {{defensive}} coordinator <b>Bill</b> <b>Belichick</b> left to become head coach of the Cleveland Browns. Parcells also decided to leave the Giants in the spring of 1991 to pursue a career in broadcasting. In addition, there was an ownership change in what {{had been one of the}} most stable front offices in professional sports. In February 1991, Tim Mara was diagnosed with cancer, and he sold his 50% interest in the team to Bob Tisch for a reported $80 million. This marked the first time since their inception in 1925 that the Giants had not been wholly owned and controlled by the Mara family.|$|E
5|$|The {{defeat in}} Mile High Stadium {{proved to be}} the last of Cleveland's streak of playoff {{appearances}} in the mid- to late-1980s. Kosar played through numerous injuries in 1989, including bruising on his right arm and a bad knee. Strong defense had carried the Browns to the playoffs even when the offense faltered, but that all crumbled in 1990. Kosar threw more interceptions than touchdowns {{for the first time in}} his career, and the defense allowed more points than any other in the league. The Browns' 2–7 start cost Carson his job. Jim Shofner was named interim head coach, and the team finished 3–13. After the season <b>Bill</b> <b>Belichick,</b> the defensive coordinator of the then-Super Bowl champion New York Giants, was named head coach.|$|E
50|$|In {{his book}} How Football Explains America, Sal Paolantonio noted the many {{parallels}} between the Patriots' philosophy and military training taught at West Point. This is likely the result of Bill Parcells' having coached at West Point {{for four years and}} <b>Bill</b> <b>Belichick's</b> close ties with the Naval Academy.|$|R
5000|$|On {{the court}} Crean {{is known to}} walk the sidelines with an {{intensity}} normally reserved for football coaches. For inspiration, Crean has a library filled with biographies of coaches and business executives, with favorites being Jim Collins' management guide [...] "Good to Great" [...] {{and the story of}} <b>Bill</b> <b>Belichick's</b> rise in New England, [...] "Patriot Reign".|$|R
2500|$|Four {{hours after}} the game ended, Tom Brady visited <b>Bill</b> <b>Belichick's</b> hotel room where, as per team rules, {{he had to get}} his coach's {{permission}} to miss the team flight and instead travel to Disney World in Orlando. Belichick gave him a perplexed look, and after a few seconds of dead silence, responded, [...] "Of course you can go. How many times do you win the Super Bowl?" ...|$|R
5|$|Once again {{facing the}} New England Patriots, the New York Giants headed to Lucas Oil Stadium, home of Eli's brother Peyton's team, the Indianapolis Colts. The Giants {{got off to}} an early lead by an {{intentional}} grounding call on Tom Brady {{in the end zone}} for a safety and retaining the ball for most of the 1st quarter. However, New England came back and battled to a 10–9 lead. Nearing the end of the 4th quarter with the Giants behind 17–15, Patriots coach <b>Bill</b> <b>Belichick</b> allowed them to score a touchdown with the idea that they would have nearly a minute to drive downfield and score. However, the New York defense held and broke up several Brady pass attempts. A last-second throw into the end zone by the Patriots QB was thwarted and the Giants had won their second Super Bowl 21–17 in four years at New England's expense.|$|E
5|$|The 1990 {{season and}} Super Bowl win {{marked the end}} of an era for the Giants. Shortly after the win, {{defensive}} coordinator <b>Bill</b> <b>Belichick</b> left to become head coach of the Cleveland Browns, and Parcells decided in the spring of 1991 to leave the Giants for a career in broadcasting. There was also an ownership change in what had been one of the most stable front offices in professional sports. In February 1991, after being diagnosed with Cancer, Tim Mara sold his 50% interest in the team to Bob Tisch for a reported $80 million. The sale was actually worked out before the Super Bowl but not announced until afterwards, so as to avoid distracting the team. It marked the first time since their inception in 1925 that the Giants had not been wholly owned and controlled by the Mara family.|$|E
5|$|The closest {{geographically}} {{has been}} the rivalry with the New York Jets. The Patriots and Jets {{have been in the}} same division (what is now the AFC East) since both teams' foundings in 1960, and have played each other at least twice a year since then. The rivalry between the Jets and Patriots has escalated since 1996, when Patriots head coach Bill Parcells left the Patriots under controversy to become the head coach of the Jets; he was replaced by former Jets coach Pete Carroll. Four years later Carroll was fired, and Parcells's assistant, <b>Bill</b> <b>Belichick,</b> resigned the day he was named the Jets' head coach to become the head coach of the Patriots. Six years after that, Eric Mangini, an assistant under Belichick, became the head coach of the Jets.|$|E
50|$|Originating as an NFL Network {{special on}} the career of Bill Parcells in November 2010, it premiered as an episodic series on September 15, 2011, with {{the first part of}} <b>Bill</b> <b>Belichick's</b> {{documentary}}. The documentary was viewed by about 657,000 viewers, the most-watched documentary in NFL Network's history, and was the second-most watched program in Boston at the time with 151,000 viewers, trailing behind a Boston Red Sox game. Season One was eventually released on DVD.|$|R
25|$|Unlike {{previous}} offseasons, {{head coach}} <b>Bill</b> <b>Belichick's</b> 2007 coaching staff remained generally unchanged. Wide receivers coach Brian Daboll left {{to become the}} quarterbacks coach for the New York Jets {{and was replaced by}} Director of Pro Personnel Nick Caserio. Former Duke University offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach Bill O'Brien was also hired as an offensive assistant. A former special teams contributor for the Patriots, linebacker Don Davis retired and joined the coaching staff as an assistant strength and conditioning coach. Offensive coaching assistant Mike Judge also joined Harvard University as a wide receivers coach.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] New England Patriots {{season was}} the franchise's 43rd {{season in the}} National Football League and 53rd overall. The Patriots did not improve upon their 13-3 record, {{finishing}} at 12-4, but did win the AFC East for the fourth season in a row, and a first-round bye {{as one of the}} top two seeds in the AFC for the third consecutive year. This season marks head coach <b>Bill</b> <b>Belichick's</b> 13th season as Patriots head coach, and the 11th season in which the Patriots played all of their home games at Gillette Stadium.|$|R
5|$|The Ravens' first regular-season {{win over}} the Patriots came on September 23, 2012. The game was {{emotional}} as receiver Torrey Smith was competing {{following the death of}} his brother in a motorcycle accident just the night before. Smith caught two touchdowns in a back and forth game; the Ravens erased a 13–0 lead {{in the first half and}} led 14–13, but the Patriots scored at the end of the second quarter for a 20–14 lead. The lead changed twice in the third quarter and the Patriots led 30–21 in the fourth, but the Ravens scored on Smith's second touchdown catch. The Ravens were stopped on fourth down but the Patriots had to punt; in the final two minutes a pass interference penalty on Devin McCourty put the ball at the Patriots 7-yard line; new Ravens kicker Justin Tucker booted a 27-yard field goal on the final play; the ball sailed directly over the upright and was ruled good; the quality of officiating by replacement referees caused controversy as <b>Bill</b> <b>Belichick</b> angrily reached for one of the referees as they were leaving the field, leading to a $50,000 fine later that week.|$|E
5|$|The Patriots' current coach, <b>Bill</b> <b>Belichick,</b> {{was hired}} in 2000, and a new home field, Gillette Stadium, was opened in 2002. Under Belichick, the team won three Super Bowls in four years (2001, 2003, and 2004). The Patriots {{finished}} the 2007 regular season with a perfect 16–0 record, becoming only the fourth team in league history to go undefeated in the regular season, {{and the only one}} since the league expanded its regular season schedule to 16 games. After advancing to Super Bowl XLII, the team's fourth Super Bowl in seven years, the Patriots were defeated by the Giants to end their bid for a 19–0 season. With the loss, the Patriots ended the year at 18–1, becoming only one of three teams to go 18–1 along with the 1984 San Francisco 49ers and the 1985 Chicago Bears. The Patriots' returned to the Super Bowl in 2012 but lost again to the Giants, 21–17. In 2015, they won Super Bowl XLIX, defeating the Seattle Seahawks by a score of 28–24. The Patriots became the first team to reach nine Super Bowls in the 2016–17 playoffs and faced the Atlanta Falcons in Super Bowl LI, which ended up paving the way for their fifth Super Bowl victory, tying them with the Dallas Cowboys and the San Francisco 49ers for the second-most in NFL history, 1 behind the Pittsburgh Steelers with 6; the game was also the first Super Bowl to go into overtime.|$|E
25|$|Veteran wide {{receiver}} Troy Brown. Head Coach <b>Bill</b> <b>Belichick</b> used Brown {{in the secondary}} during training camp, gave him playing time there during the preseason and saw Brown did very well.|$|E
2500|$|New England would tie {{the game}} with a nine-yard Brady {{touchdown}} pass to wide receiver Troy Brown, but the Bills re-took the lead a 53-yard field goal by Bills kicker Rian Lindell and an 18-yard touchdown run from running back Anthony Thomas. [...] Despite their first half struggles, the Patriots would win after a 17-yard pass to running back Kevin Faulk, a 14-yard field goal by rookie kicker Stephen Gostkowski, and a safety by defensive end Ty Warren on quarterback J. P. Losman to secure a 19–17 Patriots victory. The win was the 100th of <b>Bill</b> <b>Belichick's</b> career.|$|R
50|$|Before {{leading the}} Patriots to seven Super Bowl {{appearances}} and five Super Bowl wins as head coach, <b>Bill</b> <b>Belichick's</b> first {{job in the}} National Football League was as an assistant with the Baltimore Colts in 1975 under head coach Ted Marchibroda. In 1996, Belichick, then the {{head coach of the}} Cleveland Browns, returned to Baltimore following the Browns relocation but was fired shortly after the move. He was replaced by Marchibroda, who had just completed a four-season stint with the Indianapolis Colts. Belichick then took his first job with the Patriots, becoming an assistant under head coach Bill Parcells for the 1996 season.|$|R
50|$|New England would tie {{the game}} with a nine-yard Brady {{touchdown}} pass to wide receiver Troy Brown, but the Bills re-took the lead a 53-yard field goal by Bills kicker Rian Lindell and an 18-yard touchdown run from running back Anthony Thomas. Despite their first half struggles, the Patriots would win after a 17-yard pass to running back Kevin Faulk, a 14-yard field goal by rookie kicker Stephen Gostkowski, and a safety by defensive end Ty Warren on quarterback J. P. Losman to secure a 19-17 Patriots victory. The win was the 100th of <b>Bill</b> <b>Belichick's</b> career.|$|R
25|$|This game also marked three career playoff records: Brady and Patriots {{head coach}} <b>Bill</b> <b>Belichick</b> set records with 10 {{straight}} postseason victories, eclipsing Vince Lombardi's {{run with the}} Green Bay Packers in the 1960s.|$|E
25|$|The 2007 Pro Bowl {{marked the}} 28th {{consecutive}} {{time that the}} National Football League's all-star game is held in Honolulu. The NFC was coached by Sean Payton of the New Orleans Saints. The AFC was coached by <b>Bill</b> <b>Belichick</b> of the New England Patriots.|$|E
25|$|Brady and Patriots {{head coach}} <b>Bill</b> <b>Belichick</b> have {{combined}} to form the most successful quarterback-coach tandem in NFL history, winning more regular season games and postseason games than anyone else, as well as appearing in seven Super Bowls together. All of these events set new NFL records.|$|E
50|$|Daniel Edward Reeves (born January 19, 1944) is {{a former}} American {{football}} running back and coach in the National Football League (NFL). He participated in a combined nine Super Bowls as player and coach, the second-most in league history behind <b>Bill</b> <b>Belichick's</b> ten. Reeves played in two Super Bowls (V, VI), was an assistant coach in three more (X, XII, XIII), and was head coach in four: XXI, XXII, and XXIV with the Denver Broncos, and XXXIII with the Atlanta Falcons. Reeves is tied with Jeff Fisher for the NFL record of most regular-season losses as a head coach, with 165, though both coaches have an overall winning record.|$|R
5000|$|During his 14-year tenure {{with the}} Eagles, Reid {{compiled}} the best win total (120), winning percentage (.609) and playoff victory total (10) in team history. He captured six division titles and five {{trips to the}} NFC Championship game. During this period, no other franchise earned more divisional playoff round appearances (7) and only <b>Bill</b> <b>Belichick's</b> New England Patriots exceeded Philadelphia's (5) conference championship game appearances with (6). Reid also sent 19 players to 44 Pro Bowl appearances, the highest total for any team in the NFL during that period. None of these players had ever appeared in a Pro Bowl before Reid was hired.http://www.philadelphiaeagles.com/multimedia/photo-gallery/A-Look-Back-At-Andy-Reids-Tenure/e787fd3b-f67c-4258-a037-240e29cb964a ...|$|R
25|$|Coming off a fifth-place {{finish in}} head coach <b>Bill</b> <b>Belichick's</b> first season in 2000, the Patriots were not {{expected}} to fare much better in 2001. While Drew Bledsoe was signed to a 10-year contract extension in March, offensive tackle Bruce Armstrong retired, and wide receiver Terry Glenn had a preseason contract holdout and was also hit with a drug suspension by the NFL {{for the first four}} games of the season. Despite these high-profile losses, the Patriots were able to find adequate replacements at very low cost. Receivers Troy Brown and David Patten had career seasons, 1st-round draft pick Richard Seymour anchored the defensive line, and Antowain Smith (a free agent signed from Buffalo) ran for over 1,000 yards.|$|R
25|$|On September 10, <b>Bill</b> <b>Belichick</b> {{was accused}} by the Jets of authorizing {{his staff to}} film the Jets' {{defensive}} signals from an on-field location, a violation of league rules. The Jets confiscated the video camera used by video assistant Matt Estrella to film the signals during the game and filed a complaint to the league office, detailing the accusations.|$|E
25|$|The Giants are now 4–0 in Super Bowls {{in which}} <b>Bill</b> <b>Belichick</b> {{has been on}} the sidelines. Belichick was the Giants' {{defensive}} coordinator for their first two Super Bowl victories, and the opposing head coach in their last two. Three of the Giants' victories have come against AFC East teams, with the Giants having defeated the Buffalo Bills and Patriots twice.|$|E
25|$|Even {{the cast}} poked fun at their alter egos. On October 30, 2006, {{three of the}} series' cast members, {{appearing}} in their characters (Ferrera as Betty, Mabius as Daniel, and Newton as Amanda), gave New England Patriots head coach <b>Bill</b> <b>Belichick</b> a 'makeover' {{to make him look}} more like quarterback Tom Brady in a spoof that was featured on ESPN's Monday Night Countdown.|$|E
2500|$|Bill O'Brien – New England Patriots {{offensive}} {{assistant coach}} and quarterbacks coach on Head Coach <b>Bill</b> <b>Belichick's</b> staff, and current Head Coach of the Houston Texans. Bill O'Brien served 14 seasons {{as an assistant}} coach at the collegiate level, including four seasons as an offensive coordinator. He coached in the Atlantic Coast Conference for 12 seasons, including tenures at Maryland (2003–04), Georgia Tech (1995–2002) and Duke (2005–06). He served as the offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach at Duke University for two seasons prior to leaving Maryland. [...] He served as Ralph Friedgen's running backs coach from 2003 to 2004. In his first season with the Terrapins in 2003, Maryland finished second in the ACC in rushing and defeated West Virginia in the Gator Bowl.|$|R
5000|$|Defending plays {{from the}} wildcat {{requires}} linemen and linebackers {{to know and}} execute their own assignments without over-pursuing what may turn into a fake or a reverse. The formation's initial success in 2008 can be attributed in part to surprise—defenses had not practiced their countermeasures against such an unusual offensive strategy. [...] Since then, most teams are well prepared to stop the wildcat; an example came in November 2008 when the Patriots traveled to Miami nine weeks after the Dolphins win in Foxborough; <b>Bill</b> <b>Belichick's</b> defense limited the wildcat to just 27 yards and forced the Dolphins to try a conventional passing attack; the game lead changed six times but the Patriots wore out the Dolphins with a 48-28 win.|$|R
5000|$|The Patriots {{defeated}} the Jets on November 22, 2012 by {{a score of}} 49-19. The Patriots forced five turnovers, the most bizarre of which {{became known as the}} [...] "butt fumble", in which Mark Sanchez was flattened after running into the backside of lineman Brandon Moore and fumbling the ball to Steve Gregory, who ran back a 32-yard touchdown. This was during a sequence when the Patriots scored three touchdowns in just 52 seconds. The Patriots tied the NFL record for most points in a single quarter (35) and the win was <b>Bill</b> <b>Belichick's</b> 200th career NFL win as a head coach. The win nearly clinched the AFC East for the Patriots (they would clinch the title the next weekend at Miami).|$|R
