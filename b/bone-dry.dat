5|$|On January 14, 1919, Indiana {{became the}} twenty-fifth state {{to ratify the}} Eighteenth Amendment, which {{mandated}} nationwide prohibition. Three days later Nebraska became the thirty-sixth state to ratify the amendment, providing the two-thirds majority of states required to amend the U.S. Constitution. With the beginning of nationwide Prohibition on January 17, 1920, after formal ratification of the Eighteenth Amendment the previous day, efforts turned to enforcement of the new law. Protestant support for Prohibition remained intense in Indiana in the 1920s. Shumaker and the IASL lead a statewide grassroots campaign that successfully passed a new prohibition law for the state. Sponsored by Indiana representative Frank Wright and known as the Wright <b>bone-dry</b> law, it was enacted in 1925. The Wright law {{was part of a}} national trend toward stricter prohibition legislation and imposed severe penalties for alcohol possession.|$|E

[...] Contrasting with Carter's view, Monfette of IGN said that it speedily found itself [...] "mired in the annoying and absurd", adding: [...] "This third season may very well represent a case of over-writing a concept that has, perhaps tragically, run <b>bone-dry</b> on narrative fuel." [...] At the conclusion of season three, Entertainment Weekly Gregory Kirschling said [...] "the show lacked a defining happy, warm-gooseflesh moment", adding that the season [...] "didn't leave you dying for the [...] season premiere". Speaking of the fourth season, Laura Burrows of IGN said the series became [...] "a little more than mediocre, but less than fantastic", adding: [...] "This season proved that even strong chemistry and good acting cannot save a show that suffers from the inevitable recycled plot." ...|$|E
500|$|Returning to {{independent}} films in 2007, Hoffman {{began with a}} starring role in Tamara Jenkins's The Savages, where Laura Linney and he played siblings responsible for putting their dementia-ridden father (Philip Bosco) in a care home. Jake Coyle of the Associated Press stated that it was [...] "the epitome of a Hoffman film: a mix of comedy and tragedy told with subtlety, <b>bone-dry</b> humor, and flashes of grace". Hoffman received a Golden Globe nomination for his performance in The Savages. [...] He next appeared in Before the Devil Knows You're Dead, the final film by veteran director Sidney Lumet, where he played a realtor who embezzles funds from his employer to support his drug habit. Mosher comments that the character {{was one of the}} most unpleasant of Hoffman's career, but that his [...] "fearlessness again revealed the humanity within a deeply flawed character" [...] as he appeared naked in the opening anal sex scene.

2500|$|Butterworts need {{habitats}} {{that are}} almost constantly moist or wet, at least during their carnivorous growth stage. Many Mexican species lose their carnivorous leaves, and sprout succulent leaves, or die back to onion-like [...] "bulbs" [...] to survive the winter drought, at which point they can survive in <b>bone-dry</b> conditions.

2500|$|O'Brian's <b>bone-dry</b> {{and cutting}} wit is present {{throughout}} all his novels. Its delivery, {{whether in the}} form of narration or dialogue, is often so forthright that the reader may not perceive it at first. At times, however, O'Brian will spend a considerable portion of a volume setting up comical sequences - for example, Jack's use of rum in the [...] "debauchery" [...] of Maturin's pet sloth in HMS Surprise or Jack's assertion to William Babbington, while discussing nautical terminology, that [...] "Sheep ain't poetical", supporting his statement by saying: [...] "Remember that fellow in the play who calls out: 'My Kingdom for a horse'? Would not have been poetry at all, had he said sheep." [...] (See The Ionian Mission.) Drunk animals are a common motif through the series; for instance the following conversation between Jack and Stephen in Post Captain: [...] "'The carrier has brought you an ape.' 'What sort of an ape?' asked Stephen. 'A damned ill-conditioned sort of an ape. It had a can of ale at every pot-house on the road, and is reeling drunk. It has been offering itself to Babbington.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|In the Champagne, Chardonnay is one {{of three}} major grape {{varieties}} planted in the region. It is most commonly found in the Aube and Marne départments which, combined with Chablis, accounted {{for more than half of}} all plantings of Chardonnay in France during the 20th century. In the Côte des Blancs (white slope) district of the Marne, Chardonnay thrives on the chalk soil. The three main villages around the Côte grow Chardonnay that emphasizes certain characteristics that the Champagne producers seek depending on their house style. The village of Avize grows grapes that produce the lightest wines, Cramant makes the most aromatic, and Mesnil produces wines with the most acidity. The Côte des Blancs is the only district in the Champagne region [...] predominately planted with Chardonnay. In the four other main districts-Aube, Côte de Sézanne, Montagne de Reims, and Vallée de la Marne-Chardonnay lags behind Pinot noir in planting. In the outlying region of Aisne, only Pinot Meunier has a significant presence. Despite being less planted, the Blanc de Blancs style of Champagne (made from only Chardonnay grapes) is far more commonly produced than Blanc de Noirs. This is partly because Pinot noir and Pinot Meunier produce very coarse and heavy wines that lack the finesse and balance that Chardonnay brings to the mix. Nonsparkling still wine Chardonnay is produced under the Coteaux Champenois AOC. The wine is much more acidic than that of Chablis and is normally made <b>bone-dry.</b>|$|E

60|$|I {{have learned}} {{one of the}} prime virtues of a steel sailing-ship. Such a craft, heavily laden, does not strain her seams open in bad weather and big seas. Except for a tiny leak down in the fore-peak, with which we sailed from Baltimore and which is bailed out with a pail once in several weeks, the Elsinore is <b>bone-dry.</b> Mr. Pike tells me that had a wooden ship of her size and cargo gone through the {{buffeting}} we have endured, she would be leaking like a sieve.|$|E

Possessing a secret, preservative virtue, this sand had, ages ago, been brought from a distant land, to furnish a sepulcher for the Pontiffs; who here, side by side, and sire by son, slumbered all peacefully in the fellowship of the grave. Mohi declared, that were the sepulcher to be opened, it would be the resurrection of the whole line of High Priests. [...] "But a resurrection of bones, after all," [...] said Babbalanja, ever osseous in his allusions to the departed.|$|E

Their rudimentariness cannot know why we care for the things we care for. They have no faces, no minds and bowels: only deep, lustful roots stretching in earth, and vast, lissome life in air, and primeval individuality. You can sacrifice the whole of your spirituality on their altar still. You can nail your skull on their limbs. They have no skulls, no minds nor faces, they can't make eyes of love at you. Their vast life dispenses with all this. But they will live you down.|$|E
60|$|No, my dear friend; {{and that}} was the deuce of it. Waterproof it was not, no more than a sponge. Indeed, with such {{recklessness}} had I bequilted my jacket, that in a rain-storm I became a universal absorber; swabbing <b>bone-dry</b> the very bulwarks I leaned against. Of a damp day, my heartless shipmates even used to stand up against me, so powerful was the capillary attraction between this luckless jacket of mine and all drops of moisture. I dripped like a turkey a roasting; and long after the rain storms were over, and the sun showed his face, I still stalked a Scotch mist; and when it was fair weather with others, alas! it was foul weather with me.|$|E
60|$|Several thoroughfares, {{upper and}} lower, run {{parallel}} with the river; all are connected, like a chess-board, by cross-lanes at right angles, and their grass-grown centres are lined by open drains of masonry, now <b>bone-dry.</b> The pavement is composed of stone and dust, which during the rains becomes mud; the trottoirs are in some places of brick, in others of asphalte, in others of cracked slabs. Mostly, however, we walk on sand and gravel, which fills our boots with something harder than unboiled peas. The multiplicity of useless walls, the tree-clumps, and the green sward faintly suggested memories of a semi-deserted single-company station in Western India; and the decayed, tumble-down look of all around was a deadly-lively illustration of the Hebrew Ichabod.|$|E
60|$|The first night, accordingly, {{we pushed}} {{to the house of}} a Maclaren in Strathire, a friend of Duncan's, where we slept the twenty-first of the month, and whence we set forth again about the fall of night to make another easy stage. The twenty-second we lay in a heather bush on the hill-side in Uam Var, within view of a herd of deer, the happiest ten hours of sleep in a fine, {{breathing}} sunshine and on <b>bone-dry</b> ground, that I have ever tasted. That night we struck Allan Water, and followed it down; and coming {{to the edge of the}} hills saw the whole Carse of Stirling underfoot, as flat as a pancake, with the town and castle on a hill in the midst of it, and the moon shining on the Links of Forth.|$|E
6000|$|Our Rosh há Shanah ("New Year's Day") {{was further}} {{distinguished}} {{by the discovery}} of a vein and outcrop of metalliferous quartz, about half an hour's walk, and bearing nearly east (80 degrees mag.) from camp. We followed the Wady Sharmá, and found above its [...] "gate" [...] the masonry-foundation of a square work; near it lay the graves of the Wild Men, one with the normal awning of palm-fronds honoris causâ. There were signs of stone-quarrying, and at one place a road had been cut in the rock. Leaving on the north {{the left side of the}} watercourse, with its rushes (Scirpus), and huge-headed reeds (Arundo donax), its dates and Daums--the two latter often scorched and killed by the careless Bedawi--we struck into a parallel formation, the Wady el Wuday, <b>bone-dry</b> and much trodden by camels. Arrived at the spot, we found that the confused masses of hill subtending the regular cliff-line of the old coast, are composed of grey granite, seamed with snowy quartz, and cut by the usual bands of bottle-coloured porphyritic trap, which here and there becomes red. Some of the heights are of greenish-yellow chloritic felspar, well adapted for brick-making. The surface of the land is scattered with fragments of white silex and fine red jasper, banded with black oligistic iron: this rock, close, hard, and fine enough to bear cutting, appears everywhere in scatters and amongst the conglomerates. Only one fossil was picked up, a mould so broken as to be quite useless.|$|E
6000|$|After a silly {{fortnight}} at old Madiáma, I {{resolved to}} march upon its seaport, Makná, the <Greek> [...] of Ptolemy, {{which the people}} call also [...] "Madyan."[EN#100] We set out at seven a.m. (January 25th); and, after a walk of forty-five minutes, we were shown by Furayj a Ghadír, or shallow basin of clay, shining and bald as an old scalp from the chronic sinking of water. In the middle stood two low heaps of fine white cement, mixed with brick and gravel; while to the west we could trace {{the framework of a}} mortared Fiskíyyah ("cistern"), measuring five metres each way. The ruin lies a little south of west (241 deg. mag.) from the greater [...] "Shigd;" [...] and it is directly under the catacombed hill which bears the [...] "Praying-place of Jethro." [...] A tank in these regions always presupposes a water-pit, and there are lingering traditions that this is the [...] "Well of Moses," [...] so generally noticed by mediæval Arab geographers. It is {{the only one in the}} Wady Makná, not to mention a modern pit about an hour and a half further down the valley, sunk by the Bedawin some twenty feet deep: the walls of the latter are apparently falling in, and it is now <b>bone-dry.</b> But the veritable [...] "Moses' Well" [...] seems to have been upon the coast; and, if such be the case, it is clean forgotten. True, Masá'íd, the mad old Ma'ázi, attempted to trace a well inside our camp by the seashore; but the Beni 'Ukbah, to whom the land belongs, had never heard of it.|$|E
6000|$|At the Musaybah I {{stationed}} our tender, the Sambúk El-Musahhil, which carried our heavy goods, specimens by the ton; rations and stores; forge, planks, and crowbars. The sailors lost no time {{in showing}} their rapacity. Every day they dunned us for tobacco; and when we made a counter-demand for the excellent fish which was caught in shoals, they simply asked, [...] "What will you pay for it?" [...] I imprudently left my keg of specimen-spirits on board this ignoble craft, and the consequence was that it speedily became <b>bone-dry.</b> The Musaybah bight is a direct continuation of the Wady el-Melláh, which, joining that of El-Maka'dah, runs straight up to the Jebel el-Abyaz and to the Filon Husayn. These metalliferous quartzes cannot {{be further from the}} coast than a maximum distance of fourteen miles, and the broad, smooth watercourse, with its easy gradients, points it out as the site of the future tramway. I should prefer a simpler form of the [...] "Pioneer Steam Caravan or Saddleback-Railway System," [...] patented by Mr John L. Haddan, C.E., formerly of Damascus.[EN#29] He recommends iron as the best material for the construction; and the cost, delivered at Alexandria, would not exceed £1200, instead of £3000 to £20,000 per kilometre, including the rolling stock. As the distance from the port is nothing, £300 per kilometre would be amply sufficient for [...] "fixing up;" [...] but I should reduce the price to £500 for the transport of some 50 tons per diem. By proper management of the rails or the main rail, it would be easy for trained camels to draw the train up the Wady; and the natural slope towards the sea would give work only to the brake where derailments are not possible.|$|E
60|$|Any {{one who has}} eyes to see {{can assure}} himself that Axim is the {{threshold}} of the Gold-region. It abounds in diorite, a rock usually associated with the best paying lodes. After heavy showers the naked eye can note spangles of the precious metal in the street-roads. You can pan it out of the wall-swish. The little stream-beds, <b>bone-dry</b> throughout the hot season, roll down, during the rains, a quantity of dark arenaceous matter, like that of Taranaki, New Zealand, and the 'black sand' of Australia, which collects near the sea in stripes and patches. The people believe that without it gold never occurs; and, if they collect the common yellow sand, it is to extract from it the darker material. If the stuff does not answer the magnet, it is probably schorl (tourmaline), hornblende, or dark quartz. Strangers have often mistaken this emery-like rock for tin, which occurs abundantly in the northern region. It is simply titaniferous iron, iserine, pleonaste, ilmenite [Footnote: Or peroxide of iron, with 8 to 23 per cent, of blue oxide of titanium.] and degraded itabirite, the iron and quartz formation so called in the Brazil; and it is the same mineral which I found so general throughout the gold and silver fields of neglected Midian. It is found striating white sandstone about Tákwá and other places in the interior. The surface-stone is decomposed by the oxide of iron, and thus the precious dust with its ingrained gold is dissolved and separated from it. At a greater depth the itabirite will be found solid; and the occurrence of these oldest crystalline formations in large layers is a hopeful sign. When Colonel Bolton was interested in the Gold Coast diggings I advised him to send for a few tons of this metal, and to test it as 'pay-dirt.' A barrelful was forwarded from the coast to the Akankon Company: it was probably thrown away without experiment.|$|E
