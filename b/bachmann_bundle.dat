5000|$|In the heart's {{conduction}} system, Bachmann's bundle (also {{called the}} <b>Bachmann</b> <b>bundle</b> or the interatrial tract) is {{a branch of}} the anterior internodal tract that resides on the inner wall of the left atrium. It is a broad band of cardiac muscle that passes from the right atrium, between the superior vena cava and the ascending aorta. Bachmann's bundle is, during normal sinus rhythm, the preferential path for electrical activation of the left atrium. It is therefore considered {{to be part of the}} [...] "atrial conduction system" [...] of the heart.|$|E
40|$|Background: In {{patients}} undergoing {{coronary artery}} bypass surgery (CABGS), occurrence of atrial fibrillation (AF) is common in the postoperative period and is associated with increased morbidity with longer intensive unit care (ICU) and hospital stay. Prevention with antiarrhythmic drugs is of limited success and associated with significant side effects. Therefore alternative approaches, such as <b>Bachmann</b> <b>Bundle</b> pacing, are required. Methods and Results: 154 consecutive patients, mean age 58 ± 8. 8 years, including 134 males and 20 females, were randomized to three groups; Group I: No pacing n = 54, Group II: RA pacing n = 52, Group III: <b>Bachmann</b> <b>Bundle</b> pacing n = 48. All the groups were well matched with regard to age, left atrial size, ejection fraction and use of beta blockers. Patients in Groups II and III were continually paced {{at a rate of}} 100 beats per minute (bpm) or at 10 bpm more than patients ' intrinsic heart rate. All the patients were monitored for 72 hours by telemetry and occurrence of AF was noted. Incidence of AF was 0 % (none of 48 patients) in Group III as compared to 16. 6 % in Group I (9 of 54 patients) (p 0. 003) and 12. 5 % in Group II (5 of 52 patients) (p 0. 03). There was a trend towards shorter ICU stay in Group III (3. 9 days) as compared to Group II (4. 5 days) and Group I (4. 1 days). Among the three groups, the reduction in mean P wave duration also was greater in <b>Bachmann</b> <b>bundle</b> paced group. Conclusion: In patients undergoing CABGS, <b>Bachmann</b> <b>bundle</b> pacing is superior to right atrial / no pacing in the post operative period for preventing occurrence of AF and reducing ICU stay, commensurate with a reduction in mean P wave duration on surface ECG...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Different P-wave morphologies during {{sinus rhythm}} as {{displayed}} on standard ECGs have been postulated {{to correspond to}} differences in interatrial conduction. OBJECTIVE: The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the hypothesis by comparing P-wave morphologies using left atrial activation maps. METHODS: Twenty-eight patients (mean age 49 +/- 9 years) admitted for ablation of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation were studied. Electroanatomic mapping of left atrial activation was performed at baseline during sinus rhythm with simultaneous recording of standard 12 -lead ECG. Unfiltered signal-averaged P waves were analyzed to determine orthogonal P-wave morphology. The morphology was subsequently classified into one of three predefined types. All analyses were blinded. RESULTS: The primary left atrial breakthrough site was the fossa ovalis in 8 patients, <b>Bachmann</b> <b>bundle</b> in 18, and coronary sinus in 2. Type 1 P-wave morphology was observed in 9 patients, type 2 in 17, and type 3 in 2. Seven of eight patients with fossa ovalis breakthrough had type 1 P-wave morphology, 16 of 18 patients with <b>Bachmann</b> <b>bundle</b> breakthrough had type 2 morphology, and both patients with coronary sinus breakthrough had type 3 P-wave morphology. Overall, P-wave morphology criteria correctly identified the site of left atrial breakthrough in 25 (89 %) of 28 patients. CONCLUSION: In the vast majority of patients, P-wave morphology derived from standard 12 -lead ECG can be used to correctly identify the left atrial breakthrough site and the corresponding route of interatrial conduction...|$|E
40|$|The {{phenomenon}} of sinus node reentry {{was investigated in}} 20 dogs by programed atrial stimulation during sinus rhythm and atrial pacing. Recordings were made simultaneously at multiple atrial sites. In 18 dogs, a closely coupled premature atrial beat (A 2) introduced into {{the region of the}} coronary sinus, the right or the left atrial appendage, or the <b>Bachmann</b> <b>bundle</b> was followed 100 - 300 msec later by an accelerated beat (A 3) consistent with sinus node reentry. The atrial activation sequence and the P-wave morphology of A 3 and of the spontaneous sinus beats were similar. The occurrence of A 3 during sinus rhythm and atrial pacing was dependent on the coupling interval of A 2 and the arrival time of excitation in the region of the sinus node but was independent of the atrial site at which A 2 was introduced; A 3 could be clearly distinguished from local or atrioventricular node reentry and sinus node entrance block. Moreover, crushing of the sinus node (10 dogs) or vagal stimulation (7 dogs) prevented the appearance of A 3 in all dogs, presumably by blocking the sinus node reentry pathway. During graded vagal stimulation a progressiv...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Technical {{developments}} {{in the management of}} atrial arrhythmias revived interest into the detailed knowledge of atrial anatomy. The atrial septum (AS), known for its complex structure, has been particularly difficult to study, and our knowledge of the muscular bundles providing routes for intra-atrial and interatrial conduction within the AS remains limited. OBJECTIVE: The {{purpose of this study was}} to describe myocardial arrangement within the AS and adjacent parts of atrial walls for delineation of possible substrates for interatrial and intra-atrial conduction. METHODS: Human heart specimens from 84 postmortem studies were studied using conventional morphometric assessment, blunt dissection, and light microscopy of serial histological sections of AS. RESULTS: Interatrial muscular connections are present anteriorly, posteriorly between right pulmonary veins, and inferiorly between the coronary sinus and the right inferior pulmonary vein. The inferior connections can be more prominent than the <b>Bachmann</b> <b>bundle.</b> Atrial musculature in the fossa ovalis consists of muscular bands isolated by fatty tissue from the endocardium of the right and left atrium. They are arranged along the anterior-posterior axis and have connections with left atrial myocardium. Myocardial fascicles in the posterior-inferior and superior portions of the muscular rim of fossa ovalis originate on the right atrial side and can be traced toward the atrioventricular node. CONCLUSION: The general myocardial arrangement in the AS and adjacent regions of atrial walls are important for understanding propagation of atrial activation for selection of the optimal treatment strategy...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Clinical {{significance}} of out-pouching {{structures of the}} left atrium (LA) as potential embolic sources remains unclear. We sought to evaluate the association between stroke and LA out-pouching structures. METHODS: A case-control {{study was conducted to}} assess the prevalence of LA out-pouching structures in subjects with and without stroke. Case subjects were 270 stroke patients who had undergone cardiac CT. Control subjects were 270 age- and sex-matched patients without a history of stroke and who had undergone cardiac CT. Presence of LA out-pouching structures was determined by ECG-gated cardiac CT. The location of out-pouching structures was categorized as near <b>Bachmann</b> <b>bundle,</b> anterior, inferoseptal, inferior, and lateral. The prevalence, number and location of out-pouching structures and clinical characteristics were compared between the two groups. RESULTS: One hundred sixty eight out-pouching structures were identified in 139 stroke patients (51 %), while a total of 169 out-pouching structures were found in 155 control patients (57 %) (p= 0. 1949). The prevalence of LA out-pouching structures with different locations was not significantly different between the stroke group and control group. In the stroke group, the prevalence of out-pouching structures was not significantly different by subtypes of ischemic stroke and the prevalence of LA out-pouching structures was not different between patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and without AF. CONCLUSION: The left atrial out-pouching structures are commonly seen in a population with and without stroke with similar prevalence. Our study suggests that LA out-pouching structures are not significant risk factors of stroke...|$|E
40|$|D 6. 2. 1 Within the euHeart project, WP 6 aims at {{developing}} personalized biophysical {{models of}} the atria and ventricles {{in order to improve}} the planning of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) on patients suffering from atrial fibrillation (AF) and ventricular tachycardia (VT). Besides the collection of patient specific data, one important task to achieve the goals of this workpackage is to define the biophysical models on which will be the personalized simulation of AF and VT. For the atria, the Courtemanche-Ramirez-Nattel (CRN) model is used by IBT to model atrial electrophysiology whereas for the ventricles, INRIA has adopted the Mitchell-Schaeffer (MS) model to capture in a simplified way the main features of the ventricles depolarization and repolarization. In both cases, fast versions of these electrophysiological models are proposed to decrease the time of computation on patient specific models having a large number of elements. Furthermore, those models of cardiac electrophysiology take into account the fast anisotropic pathways (myocardial fibers, <b>Bachmann</b> <b>bundle</b> [...] .) that are anatomically defined in the atria and ventricles. The simulation of the ventricle electrophysiology is coupled with a myocardium mechanical model which simulates the myocardium deformation, chamber volume and pressure during a cardiac cycle. To simulate the pathological wave propagation involved in AF and VT, specific parameters and initial conditions of those electrophysiology models are defined reflecting the effect of atrial remodeling or scars. Some simulations of AF and VT are provided on simplified geometries as well as realistic patient specific meshes. Finally, a workflow for the evaluation of those AF and VT models is provided involving the following stages : image acquisition, image processing, personalization of the geometric and biophysical models, RF ablation lines planning...|$|E
