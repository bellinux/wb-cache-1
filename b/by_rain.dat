40|$|In {{this article}} we prove a new {{elliptic}} hypergeometric integral identity. It previously appeared (as a conjecture) in articles <b>by</b> <b>Rains,</b> and Spiridonov and Vartanov. Moreover it gives a different proof of an identity in another article <b>by</b> <b>Rains.</b> We also give some basic hypergeometric and classical limits of this identity. The classical limit gives identities (some known, some new) between generalizations of the Selberg integral. Comment: 13 page...|$|R
5|$|After being aided <b>by</b> <b>rain</b> {{while in}} a disadvantageous {{position}} during the Third Test, the Australians had only one tour match—a victory over Middlesex—to prepare for the next Test at Headingley. Barnes was unable to recover from his injury in this short space of time, {{and was replaced by}} Neil Harvey. Instead of opting to use reserve opener Brown to replace Barnes, Australia played Hassett out of position to partner Morris, while Harvey took a middle-order slot.|$|E
5|$|After the Tests, seven matches {{remained}} on Bradman's quest {{to go through}} a tour of England without defeat. played in four of the matches and was in fine form, hitting three consecutive centuries. Against the Gentlemen of England at Lord's, Hassett made 200 not out against a team that featured eight Test players. He then made 103 against Somerset and 151 against the South of England. Australia won the first two and were denied <b>by</b> <b>rain</b> in the third.|$|E

The Ohio Department of Transportation capped funding for maintaining the Fort Steuben Bridge in 1998 at around $200,000 (US$ with inflation) per year. The Fort Steuben Bridge was weight-restricted in 2006 due to the weakening of the structure over time. The assessment prompted a weight limit; reducing the bridge's traffic which consisted of heavy trucks. The bridge {{was known to be}} affected <b>by</b> <b>rain</b> vibration.|$|E

5|$|Horizontal orb webs {{are fairly}} common, despite being less {{effective}} at intercepting and retaining prey and {{more vulnerable to}} damage <b>by</b> <b>rain</b> and falling debris. Various researchers have suggested that horizontal webs offer compensating advantages, such as reduced vulnerability to wind damage; reduced visibility to prey flying upwards, because of the back-lighting from the sky; enabling oscillations to catch insects in slow horizontal flight. However, {{there is no single}} explanation for the common use of horizontal orb webs.|$|E
5|$|In England, Chappell rewarded {{the faith}} of the {{selectors}} by scoring the most first-class runs on the tour (1,261 runs, including 202 not out against Warwickshire), leading the Australian Test aggregates with 348 runs (at 43.50). His top score was 81 in the fourth Test at Leeds. Wisden lauded his play off the back foot and judged him the most difficult Australian batsman to dismiss. In a summer severely affected <b>by</b> <b>rain,</b> Australia drew the series and retained The Ashes.|$|E

Tornadoes may be obscured completely <b>by</b> <b>rain</b> or dust. These tornadoes are especially dangerous, as even experienced meteorologists might not see them. Tornadoes can appear in many shapes and sizes.|$|E

5|$|S.thiersii may be {{gathered}} inadvertently and {{thought to be}} edible {{due to the fact}} that it grows on lawns among grasses. This is in contrast to Amanita species which grow around trees and are thus usually seen in forests.

5|$|Staffa {{lies about}} 10kilometres (6mi) west of Mull, and 9km {{northeast}} of Iona. It is longitudinally oriented north-south, {{and is a}} kilometre long by about half a kilometre wide. The circumference is about 3.8km in extent. In the northeast the isle shelves to a shore, but otherwise the coast is rugged and much indented; numerous caves have been carved out <b>by</b> <b>rain,</b> streams and sea. There is enough grass to feed a few cattle, and the island has a spring.|$|E
5|$|This was {{the longest}} Wimbledon men's singles final in history, {{clocking}} in at four hours and forty-eight minutes. The match also featured numerous rain delays which meant the match finished in near darkness, at 21:15 BST, almost seven hours since the match started at 14:35 BST. It {{was to be the}} last Wimbledon final to be significantly affected <b>by</b> <b>rain,</b> as a retractable roof was being installed at Centre Court and would be in place by the 2009 Wimbledon Championships.|$|E

5|$|Traditionally, {{sun drying}} {{has been used}} for some {{products}} such as tomatoes, mushrooms, and beans, spreading the produce on racks and turning the crop at intervals. This method suffers from several disadvantages including lack of control over drying rates, spoilage when drying is slow, contamination by dirt, wetting <b>by</b> <b>rain,</b> and attack by rodents, birds, and insects. These disadvantages can be alleviated by using solar powered driers. The dried produce must be prevented from reabsorbing moisture during storage.|$|E
5|$|Volcanic ash's {{primary use}} {{is that of}} a soil enricher. Once the {{minerals}} in ash are washed into the soil <b>by</b> <b>rain</b> or other natural processes, it mixes with the soil to create an andisol layer. This layer is highly rich in nutrients and is very good for agricultural use; the presence of lush forests on volcanic islands is often as a result of trees growing and flourishing in the phosphorus and nitrogen-rich andisol.|$|E
5|$|During the tour, Peel {{made his}} Test debut and played all five matches. His first Test began on 12 December 1884. Opening the bowling, took eight wickets in the match; {{in the second}} innings, he took five for 51 on a pitch {{affected}} <b>by</b> <b>rain.</b> He was less effective in the remaining games, ending the series with 21 wickets {{at an average of}} 21.47, and scored 37 runs at an average of 7.40. He was not selected in the next Test matches played by England, against Australia in 1886, and missed the next English tour of Australia, in the winter of 1886–87, again organised by Shaw, Shrewsbury and Lillywhite.|$|E

5|$|Early in the season, Arthur Carr {{was named}} as England captain {{for the start}} of the series; Carr was a popular choice and the only other serious {{contender}} at the time was Percy Fender. Chapman played in two of the three trial matches and was chosen for the first Test but did not bat in a match ruined <b>by</b> <b>rain.</b> The second Test was drawn but Chapman scored fifty. Australia dominated most of the third Test but England saved the game; Chapman scored 15 and 42 not out in the match. However, Carr's tactical approach during the match was heavily criticised and he dropped a crucial catch on the first morning. Chapman was omitted from the side for the fourth Test, but fielded as substitute when Carr became ill during the game.|$|E
5|$|Early on {{the third}} day, Lindwall bowled Edrich for 28, before Compton and Hutton {{consolidated}} the innings with a partnership of 61 in 110 minutes. On 39, Compton fell to a reflex catch by Lindwall. Hutton managed to continue resisting before edging Miller to Tallon for 64, having top-scored in both innings, to leave England at 153/4. Thereafter, England collapsed in the fading light, prompting the umpires to call off play. The ground was then hit <b>by</b> <b>rain,</b> resulting in a premature end to the day's play. England had lost four wickets for 25 runs to end at 178/7.|$|E
5|$|Federer {{defeated}} Murray in {{four sets}} {{in three hours}} and 44 minutes, to capture a record equalling seventh Wimbledon championship, and a record breaking seventeenth Major title. The victory was also historic as it caused Federer to depose Djokovic as world No. 1 and break Sampras' record of 286 weeks at the summit of men's tennis (Federer had been just one week short when he lost the number one ranking in June 2010).
