40|$|A mandrel {{peel test}} is {{established}} {{for measuring the}} adhesive fracture toughness of a metal/rubber-toughened epoxy laminate system. By adopting an energy balance analysis {{it is possible to}} determine directly both adhesive fracture toughness and plastic work in bending <b>the</b> peel arm <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>mandrel.</b> <b>The</b> suitability of the procedure is examined for various types of metal peel arms, which are classified in terms of their ability to deform plastically during the test. The plastic work is also predicted theoretically, and comparisons are made between the measured and calculated values. The fracture energies determined from <b>the</b> <b>mandrel</b> tests are compared with those obtained from 90 ° fixed-arm peel tests. For the calculations of plastic work in bending in the fixed arm test, various options are used when modelling the tensile stress-strain behaviour of the peel arm material. In addition, the adhesive layer thickness is considered in terms of its influence on the calculation of adhesive fracture toughness...|$|R

30|$|The {{frequency}} domain electromagnetic method {{has already been}} widely used for tomographic imaging or electromagnetic well logging. However, different from open hole logging, the metal casing existing in production well logging has a strong shielding effect on the electromagnetic waves, thus bringing some difficulties to {{the application of the}} {{frequency domain}} electromagnetic method in production well logging. According to the relation of the field source geometry to <b>the</b> ring <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>mandrel,</b> <b>the</b> general expressions of frequency domain electromagnetic responses in axially symmetrical layered conductive medium are deduced. The propagation effects caused by the low-frequency electromagnetic waves in cased hole are also analyzed. The distribution curves of eddy current density and magnetic flux density along the radial direction in <b>the</b> <b>mandrel</b> indicate that <b>the</b> eddy loss within <b>the</b> <b>mandrel</b> is proportional to the transmission signal frequency and <b>the</b> <b>mandrel</b> conductivity. <b>The</b> secondary field responses of different casing materials show that the transmission frequency has an important effect on the ability of electromagnetic waves penetrating the metal casing. The transmission frequency should be ultra-low in order to enable the electromagnetic signal to penetrate the casing easily. The numerical results of frequency responses for different casing physical parameters show that the casing thickness has {{a significant impact on the}} choice of the transmission frequency. It is also found that the effect of the casing radius on the transmission frequency can be neglected.|$|R

40|$|The use {{of solid}} {{expandable}} tubular technology {{during the last}} decade has focused on solving many challenges in well drilling and delivery including zonal isolation, deep drilling, conservation of hole sizes, etc. not only as pioneered solution but also providing cost effective and long lasting solutions. Concurrently, the technology was extended for construction of multilateral in typical wells. The process of horizontal tubular expansion is similar to the vertical expansion of expandable tubular in down-hole environment with the addition of uniformly distributed force due to its weight. The expansion is targeted to increase its diameter such that post expansion characteristics remain within allowable limits. In this study a typical expandable tubular of 57. 15 mm outer diameter and 6. 35 mm wall thickness was used with two different elastomer seals of 5 and 7 mm thickness placed at equal spacing of 200 mm. The developed stress contours during expansion process clearly showed the high stress areas in the vicinity of expansion region which lies <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>mandrel.</b> These high stresses may result in excessive wear of <b>the</b> <b>mandrel.</b> It was also found out that the drawing force increases as <b>the</b> <b>mandrel</b> angle, expansion ratio, and friction coefficient increases.

5000|$|A spiral die is {{the most}} complex {{of the three major}} blown film die types. The polymer melt is evenly {{distributed}} into several feed tubes, which wind around a central mandrel. Each of these feed tubes is connected to the space between <b>the</b> <b>mandrel</b> and outer die walls; the feed tubes gradually diminish in diameter as they spiral <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>mandrel.</b> At <b>the</b> same time, the space between <b>the</b> <b>mandrel</b> and outer die walls is increased. This allows the polymer melt to layer and blend, resulting in a uniform melt profile free of weld lines. This die design produces the most uniform films, but is also the most expensive. Air pressure is introduced through the extrusion die so that after the polymer melt leaves the lip of the die, it expands in circumference. The tubing is also drawn along its length faster than it is being extruded. This leads to thinning of the film as it is expanded in both the draw (or machine) direction, and in the transverse (or hoop) direction. The ratio of the blown diameter to the extruded diameter is known as the blow-up ratio, and affects the resulting physical properties of the film, such as stiffness and strength. Film thickness and blow-up ratio can be varied by altering the take-up rate of the rollers, the internal pressure in the blown tube, and the melt extrusion rate.|$|R

40|$|International audienceIt {{is shown}} that an analogy {{can be made}} between the failure of {{unidirectional}} carbon fibre reinforced epoxy plates and filament wound carbon fibre composite pressure vessels and that their strengths and failure probabilities can be determined. Fibres in filament wound composite structures are placed on geodesic paths <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>mandrel,</b> which becomes <b>the</b> liner; {{so that when the}} structure is pressurised the fibres are only subjected to tensile forces, as in a unidirectional composite. Multiscale modelling reveals that composite failure is controlled by fibre breakage and that clustering of fibre breaks determines ultimate reliability of the structure. Time dependent relaxation of the matrix leads to delayed failure of the elastic fibres. A statistical study, using the stochastic properties of the fibres, determines the range of lifetimes which will be obtained in a given class of pressure vessel, leading to an evaluation of failure probabilities as a function of internal pressures. In this way the definition of safety factors, based on an understanding of the physical processes governing damage accumulation, becomes possible...|$|R
40|$|A {{theory is}} {{presented}} showing that cloaking of objects from antiplane elastic waves {{can be achieved}} by elastic pre-stress of a neo-Hookean nonlinear elastic material. This approach would appear to eliminate the requirement of metamaterials with inhomogeneous anisotropic shear moduli and density. Waves in the pre-stressed medium are <b>bent</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> cloaked region by inducing inhomogeneous stress fields via pre-stress. The equation governing antiplane waves in the pre-stressed medium is equivalent to the antiplane equation in an unstressed medium with inhomogeneous and anisotropic shear modulus and isotropic scalar mass density. Note however that these properties are induced naturally by the pre-stress. Since the magnitude of pre-stress can be altered at will, this enables objects of varying size and shape to be cloaked by placing them inside the fluid-filled deformed cavity region.

The angular size of the shadow is larger for the stationary observer. This observer, being in an inertial frame, is essentially accelerating such that the local gravitational acceleration of the black hole is precisely counteracted by the acceleration of their reference frame. This gives rise to a force on the observer directed away from the black hole itself, reducing the angular momentum of photons oriented towards the black hole (seen as the innermost four rays being <b>bent</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> horizon), effectively increasing the black hole’s capture cross-section and producing a larger shadow.

40|$|This paper proposes the {{characterization}} of speckle patterns of multimode fibers in view of sensing applications and particularly for detection of vibration or seismic activity. Plastic optical fibers are used in this work due to its excellent flexibility and adaptability to build sensor heads. We {{are interested in the}} response to vibration, for which we use a short cylindrical piezoelectric transducer (PZT) vibrating in radial direction. The multimode fiber was coiled as tightly as possible <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>mandrel</b> of <b>the</b> PZT and periodic stretching effect was caused by the radial oscillations of the actuator. The PZT is modulated with a frequency generator by applying a sinusoidal signal in the range of 0 to 20 Hz, so the speckle patterns can be time averaged. The fiber extreme is attached to a high speed camera with a plastic adaptor, centering the speckle pattern into the CCD. Maintaining the fiber position, a region of interest is selected to capture the video sequence and it is captured to detect the variations in the speckle pattern. Once having the video sequence, it is processed by averaging the pixel differences between two consecutive frames. This processed sequence is also filtered {{in order to reduce the}} high frequency noise component.

The organization of a particular functionalized surfactant with a slight cross-sectional mismatch between head and tail has been investigated by synchrotron radiation in floating monolayers and by atomic force microscopy (AFM) in Langmuir-Blodgett films. The transfer process was accompanied by an increase of the oblique unit cell area by 17 % and by an increase of the average diameter of perfectly ordered domains from 3 nm to approximately 10 nm.

40|$|PURPOSE: The {{design of}} RF coils for MRI {{transmit}} becomes increasingly challenging at high frequencies required for MRI at 7 T and above. Our {{goal is to}} show a proof of principle of {{a new type of}} transmit coil for higher field strengths. METHOD: We demonstrate an alternative transmit coil design based on dielectric waveguide principles which transfers energy via evanescent wave coupling. The operating principles and conditions are explored by simulations. The waveguide is applied for in vivo imaging at 7 T. RESULTS: The waveguide can be an efficient transmit coil when four conditions are fulfilled: (1) the waveguide should be operated just above the cutoff frequency of the lowest order transverse electric mode, (2) the waveguide should not operate at a frequency where the wavelength fits an integer number of times in the waveguide length and standing wave patterns become very prominent, (3) for homogeneous excitation, the waveguide should be <b>bent</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> object, and (4) there should be an air gap between the waveguide and the object. CONCLUSIONS: By choosing the dielectric and the dimensions adequately, the dielectric waveguide couples the magnetic field efficiently into the body. The waveguide can be redesigned for higher frequencies by simple adaptations and may be a promising transmit alternative. Magn Reson Med 76 : 1314 - 1324, 2016. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Contact {{flexible}} microstrip applicators (CFMA) {{are applied}} for superficial hyperthermia. In the clinic these flexible applicators are mostly applied bent along the body curvature. This paper investigates the {{specific absorption rate}} (SAR) patterns of CFMA applicators, when <b>bent</b> <b>around</b> an elliptical tissue- equivalent phantom. Methods: The 2 H (aperture size 14. 8 x 14. 3 cm <SU 2 </SU), 3 H (28. 7 x 20. 7 cm <SU 2 </SU), 4 H (19. 6 x 19. 6 cm <SU 2 </SU) and 5 H (19. 7 x 28. 5 cm <SU 2 </SU) applicators were examined. Measurements were performed for the 5 H applicator; existing measurement data were analysed for the 3 H applicator. Finite difference time domain (FDTD) simulations with a resolution of 2 x 2 x 1 mm <SU 3 </SU were performed for all applicators. Applicators were <b>bent</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> top and {{the side of the}} elliptical phantom to examine different curvatures. The SAR deposition, effective field size (EFS) and effective heating depth (EHD) were evaluated and compared to results for straight applicators. Results: Bending the applicators generally yielded a focusing effect of the SAR, which was most pronounced with a strong curvature, but especially the 5 H applicator showed a stronger power absorption at the sides of the applicator, compared to the centre region. The EFS became smaller when bending the applicators; this effect was also more pronounced for a strong curvature. The EHD increased for bent applicators, but the degree depended strongly on the location. Conclusion: The behaviour of bent CFMA applicators is not trivial and the SAR deposition is not similar for all applicators. The EFS decreases and the EHD increases, but very locally. Therefore, it is generally advisable to analyse the SAR distribution of flexible applicators in both straight and bent stat...|$|R
