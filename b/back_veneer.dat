50|$|The Strat Ultra {{featured}} an alder {{body with}} flamed maple top and <b>back</b> <b>veneers</b> , and Lace Sensor pickups. Depending {{on the production}} year, the guitar featured 3-ply white-black-white or aged white pearloid pickguard. Early versions had an American Deluxe 2-point bridge, later versions were delivered with either a Deluxe pop-in bridge or a Fender Deluxe locking tremolo assembly. It was the first post-CBS era Fender guitar to feature an ebony fingerboard with abalone dot position markers (some earlier models came with regular white dots). Introduced in 1990, it was discontinued in 1997.|$|R
40|$|A glue {{shear test}} was {{conducted}} using plywood panel, made from three wood species namely pine (Pinus merkusii Yung et de Vr.), Eucalyptus alba and Eucalyptus deglupta from West Java. The bolts were rotary peeled into veneer of 1. 5 mm thick. The veneer sheets were glue with {{urea formaldehyde resin}} in combination with meranti and kapur veneers. Each plywood sample thus consisted of three layer veneer and meranti merah (red meranti) and kapur (Dryobalanops oramatica Gaert) as face and <b>back</b> <b>veneers.</b> The bonding strength (glue shear strength) of each plywood type were then tested according to the Indonesian and Japaneess standard. The result indicates that {{there were significant differences}} between wood species and variation of extender composition according to the Indonesian standard and only percentage of extenders indicated significant difference using Japaneess standard. Percentage 10 % extender was the best bonding strength of plywood comprising with the others...|$|R

The {{advantage}} to this is it is available in large sizes, or sheets, as smaller pieces are joined together prior to adding the backing. This is helpful for users that {{do not wish to}} join smaller pieces of raw veneers together. This is also helpful when veneering curves and columns as the veneer is less likely to crack.|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents an}} analytical investigation that examined the seismic performance of steel stud backed and Concrete Masonry Units (CMU) <b>backed</b> masonry <b>veneer</b> wall systems, under {{in and out}} - of - plane loads, in medium rise building frames. The investigation was prompted by recently observed damage to brick veneer wall systems due to strong earthquake and wind events. Prior research on these systems had focused on veneer walls built using older construction practices, or on residential wood stud <b>backed</b> <b>veneer</b> wall systems, or wall systems in low rise building frames. In this investigation, analytical models of the wall systems were attached to models of medium rise building frames, and the combined models were dynamically analyzed under the action of carefully selected ground motions, using {{the state of the}} art OpenSees framework. The preliminary designs of the building frames were performed on the STAAD. Pro software, according to American Building Code provisions. The member sizes were selected by the software using its inbuilt design algorithms, so as to be representative of those commonly used in earthquake resistant design in the United States, in regions falling under seismic category D. These members were then transferred into the OpenSees framework, on which the dynamic analysis was performed. The Sylmar and Tarzana ground motion histories were appropriately scaled and used in the dynamic analysis. A parametric study was conducted in order to understand the effect of different parameters on the response of the combined system comprising the veneer walls and the main building frame. The parameters were selected so as to create systems that represented the masses and stiffnesses of a vast majority of systems used in construction practice. For the mainframe systems, these included the steel moment resisting and braced frames, and the reinforced concrete moment resisting and shear wall systems. For the veneer wall systems, the parameters varied included the type of backing wall, namely, the steel stud backing wall and the eMU backing wall, and the type of tie system, namely, a stiff tie system and a flexible tie system. All the models developed in this investigation were calibrated against experimental results. During the calibration process, models were developed on OpenSees that replicated experimental observations and the model parameters were adjusted till the results predicted by the models closely matched observations. To begin with, the results of this investigation describe the effect of modeling the wall systems, under in and out - of - plane loads, as their representative masses, and as analytical models, on the frame systems, at the Design Based Earthquake (DBE) and Maximum Considered Earthquake (MCE) levels of the Sylmar and Tarzana ground motions. Subsequently, they describe the effect of the mainframes on the veneer wall systems, under out-of-plane loads, at the MCE level of the same ground motions. Finally, the results of a collapse analysis of the wall systems under out - of - plane loads is presented, showing the intensity of the ground shaking which caused failure of the wall system, and the reason for the observed failure...|$|R
30|$|Felled {{trees were}} {{crosscut}} into 10.67  m long logs, from which two 5.33  m mill-length logs were obtained. Each mill-length log was crosscut into two veneer bolts (peeler blocks) which were steamed and peeled into veneer until the core measured approximately 8.9  cm in diameter. The veneer sheets were tracked during the peeling process, allowing each sheet to be uniquely traced <b>back</b> to the <b>veneer</b> bolt and consequently {{to the position}} within the bolt, log, and parent tree, thus enabling the construction of internal stiffness maps for each tree (after Todoroki et al. 2012).|$|R

Within the parameters of this alliance, the unresolved status of Taiwan still presents one of the most precarious security situations in the region, one {{that could lead to a}} major war with China. Within the larger scope of U. S. ChinaJapanTaiwan relations, Japan and Taiwans relationship would generally be considered the least prominent of all possible combinations. Despite this reality, when pulling <b>back</b> the <b>veneer</b> from this seemingly tertiary regional relationship, there is a depth of interaction that is difficult to categorize and that has the potential to greatly influence security and stability in the region. This thesis examines Japan and Taiwans special relationship through the lens of Japans national interests and assesses the implications for the future of the U. S. -Japan alliance.

The dominant American myth of selfhood is the "Protestant English pioneer," the conquering hero that pulled in the reigns on natives and wilderness. However, this heroic selfhood comes at an astonishing price. The maintenance of this identity structure requires the inscription of strict boundaries around the self. Completion of the hero narrative requires not only a mastery of self, but also the reification of that mastery though the domination of the external world. The emergence of a counter myth might allow the cultivation of a fluid selfhood, freed from the heroic narrative's egocentrism and domination of self and other. David Lynch and Clayton Eshleman are attempting a revision of selfhood. If experience must again be widened, then both Lynch and Eshleman must peel <b>back</b> the <b>veneer</b> of Billboard America and pry, apart the old consciousness. Lynch and Eshleman seek to forge this new version of self in the smithy of an American underworld...|$|R
