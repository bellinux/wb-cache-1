A <b>Bronze</b> Age ring and a late <b>Bronze</b> Age sherd were excavated nearby.

In Greek it is known as vasilikό (the royal one), or kalogeraki (little monk).

5|$|Domesticated {{horses were}} present in <b>Bronze</b> Age Britain from around 2000BC. <b>Bronze</b> Age horse trappings {{including}} snaffle bits have been found which were used in harnessing horses to vehicles; <b>Bronze</b> Age cart wheels have been found at Flag Fen and Blair Drummond, the latter dating from around 1255–815BC, though these may have belonged to vehicles pulled by oxen. Early <b>Bronze</b> Age evidence for horses being ridden is lacking, though bareback riding may have involved materials which have not survived or have not been found; but horses were ridden in battle in Britain by the late <b>Bronze</b> Age. Domesticated ponies were on Dartmoor by around 1500BC.|$|E

40|$|<b>Bronzing</b> was {{observed}} {{in many of the}} bean trials conducted at Fort Collins (Colorado, USA) during 1982 to study the influence of water and shading stress on photosynthesis and protein content of 3 dry bean var., Roza, Pinto U.

A scale of 1 - 5 was used with 1 as no <b>bronzing</b> and 5 as severe <b>bronzing</b> (more than 50 percent leaf area bronzed). Results suggest that <b>bronzing</b> severity increased when plants were shaded and decreased when plants were under moisture stress. These treatment trends occurred at a similar rate for the 3 var., but the degree of <b>bronzing</b> was influenced by the var. Irrigation and shade treatments apparently influenced stomatal opening and the length of exposure to pollutants. (CIAT...|$|R
