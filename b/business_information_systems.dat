25|$|The tonnage of the {{returning}} ships rose by 125 percent in this period. However, the Company's {{revenues from the}} sale of goods landed in Europe rose by only 78 percent. This reflects the basic change in the VOC's circumstances that had occurred: it now operated in new markets for goods with an elastic demand, in which it had to compete on an equal footing with other suppliers. This made for low profit margins. Unfortunately, the <b>business</b> <b>information</b> <b>systems</b> of the time made this difficult to discern for the managers of the company, which may partly explain the mistakes they made from hindsight. This lack of information might have been counteracted (as in earlier times in the VOC's history) by the business acumen of the directors. Unfortunately by this time these were almost exclusively recruited from the political regent class, which had long since lost its close relationship with merchant circles.|$|E

40|$|The present diploma thesis {{deals with}} the process of {{creating}} a decision model that helps in a decision making process. The main problem of the process is the selection of a scenario for setting up/upgrading a <b>business</b> <b>information</b> <b>system.</b> At the start of the thesis,information systems are presented, focusing on ERP systems, which are {{the most common form of}} <b>business</b> <b>information</b> <b>system</b> in mid- and big-sized companies. In the next part,the DEX methodology, on which the DEXi program is based, is presented. It is a combination of multi-attribute decision making and expert systems, which are explained in detail in chapter 3. 1. The model was created using the DEXi program. Main part of the thesis is chapter 4, in which the process of creating a decision making model is described and explained in detail. Furthermore, my choice of the criteria for the model and the description of how the utility functions were set were presented and explained. End result is a working decision model, that can be very useful for selecting a <b>business</b> <b>information</b> <b>system.</b> The model was also used in practice. Five different scenarios, which were chosen as possible options for upgrading the <b>business</b> <b>information</b> <b>system</b> in a company, were compared.
