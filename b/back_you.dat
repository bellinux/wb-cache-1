500|$|... "Skyfall" [...] was {{composed}} {{in the key}} of C minor using common time at 76beats per minute (Adagietto). Adele's vocal range spans , from the low note of G3 to the high note of C5, on the song. The lyrics closely follow the narrative of the film {{rather than focusing on}} romanticism. According to Epworth, the song is about [...] "death and rebirth", saying [...] "It's like, when the world ends and everything comes down around your ears, if you've got each other's <b>back,</b> <b>you</b> can conquer anything. From death to triumph, that was definitely something we set out to try and capture". The Daily Telegraph writer Neil McCormick described the lyrics as [...] "slightly sinister" [...] and containing references to a number of Bond tropes and motifs.|$|E
500|$|On May 12, 2009, Eminem {{released}} his sixth studio effort, Relapse, {{which included a}} song titled [...] "Bagpipes from Baghdad". The song's lyrics suggested Eminem was {{still in love with}} Carey, and that he [...] "wanted her back": [...] "I want another crack at ya" [...] and [...] "Nick Cannon better back the fuck up. I'm not playing, I want her <b>back,</b> <b>you</b> punk." [...] After the song's release, Cannon went on his website, defending Carey and expressing his disgust at his comments. Following Cannon's comments, Eminem responded sarcastically. He clarified that the song was actually [...] "wishing the couple the best", and that it was a misunderstanding. In an interview with BBC Radio, Eminem clarified that although contained a [...] "harsh" [...] line, he meant well. He later commented that he respected Cannon for his response, and that he expected him to stand up for his wife.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Entertainment Weekly, Murphy commented {{on the structure of}} the series' first season. [...] "I loved how it began. I loved it in the middle and I loved the end. The only thing really frustrating for me, to be honest with you, is that sometimes people would write this idea that we were making it up as we went along and I wanted to say, 'Really?' But I think now people are writing and saying, 'Oh yeah!' I'm excited for people to see it on DVD, because now that they know how it ended, [...] go back and see all of the little things, like people who have no reflections in mirrors. When you go <b>back,</b> <b>you</b> will see everything was set up." [...] When asked if the House [...] "pulled" [...] the Harmons to it, Murphy responded, [...] "I don't know if they were targeted. I don't think the Internet site had any supernatural pull to it...although that would have been hilarious. I thought it was two things: it was house porn because I think that house really is extraordinary. And also I think there's always that allure in American lives of the fresh start, moving West, starting fresh." ...|$|E

500|$|In two {{separate}} 2016 AMAs on Reddit, both Nick Jonas and Joe Jonas {{reflected on the}} episode. [...] "When it first came out I didn't think it was funny to be honest, but probably because I was actually living all of that in real time, so it just made it harder to come and live your life as a young person and have all that going on," [...] Nick said. [...] "But years later and once the purity rings were no longer around, it was very funny to me and I've actually watched the episode a few times." [...] "I loved it. When it first came out I was so pumped". Joe said. [...] "I know that Nick was really kind of not into watching it, but I {{thought it was the}} funniest thing at the time and it's kind of a compliment because obviously {{if you go to a}} comedy show and they pick you out and make fun of you, you can't heckle <b>back,</b> <b>you</b> gotta just take it and enjoy it, and for me I've always been a fan and I knew that was kind of a wow we made it moment, and also they were kind of attacking Disney more than me, so I didn't really feel threatened. Now I watch it back and laugh and Mickey kicked my ass so I won the episode by being beat up by Mickey Mouse." ...|$|E
500|$|When {{asked if}} the 1995 thriller film Seven was an {{inspiration}} to Saw, Whannell said [...] "For me as the writer, definitely. I mean, Seven is just a very well constructed film, and if you're writing a thriller, it can't hurt to study it. In terms of the story though, James and I never really felt Seven was that close to our film. I guess if you stand <b>back,</b> <b>you</b> have two detectives chasing a psychopath, who uses vile methods to teach people lessons, and those points echo Seven. What we always liked about Saw, though, {{was the fact that}} the story is told from the point of view of two of the psychopath's victims, instead of the police chasing after him, as you so often see." [...] Entertainment Weekly Owen Gleiberman compared the plot to Seven saying, [...] "In a blatant imitation of Seven, Saw features a lunatic sadist whose ghoulish crimes are meant, in each case, to mirror the sins of his victims. The twist here is that the psycho doesn't do the killing." [...] Richard J. Leskosky of Champaign-Urbana's The News-Gazette said [...] "Saw wants to be taken as another Seven. Though it features perverse gross-out scenes and a villain with a superficially pedantic motive behind his crimes (his victims, if they survive, have learned to appreciate life more), it lacks the finesse and polish of the David Fincher film." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1888 Lansbury {{agreed to}} act as {{election}} agent for Jane Cobden, who was contesting the first elections for the newly formed London County Council [...] (LCC) as Liberal candidate for the Bow and Bromley division. [...] Cobden, an early supporter of women's suffrage, was the fourth child of the Victorian radical statesman Richard Cobden. [...] The Society for Promoting Women as County Councillors (SPWCC), a new women's rights group, had proposed Cobden as the [...] candidate for Bow and Bromley and Margaret Sandhurst [...] for Brixton. [...] Lansbury counselled Cobden in the issues of greatest concern to the East End electorate: housing for the poor, ending of sweated labour, rights of public assembly, {{and control of the}} police. Specific questions of women's rights were largely avoided during the campaign. [...] On 19 January 1889 both women were elected; these triumphs were, however, short-lived. Sandhurst's [...] qualification to serve as a county councillor was successfully challenged in the courts by her Conservative Party opponents on the grounds of her sex, and her subsequent appeal was dismissed. Cobden was not immediately challenged, but in April 1891, after a [...] series of legal actions, [...] she was effectively neutered as a councillor by being prevented from voting on pain of severe financial penalties. [...] Lansbury urged her, during the hearings, [...] to [...] "go to prison and let the Council <b>back</b> <b>you</b> up by refusing to declare your seat vacant". Cobden did not follow this path. A Bill introduced in the House of Commons in May 1891 permitting women to serve as county councillors found little support among [...] MPs of any party; women were not granted this right until 1907.|$|E

500|$|American pressmen {{had been}} alerted to an {{upcoming}} Buddhist demonstration {{to coincide with}} Double Seven Day at Chanatareansey Pagoda {{in the north of}} Saigon. The group, which included Arnett, Browne, David Halberstam, Neil Sheehan of United Press International, and CBS's Peter Kalischer waited outside the building with their equipment. After an hour-long religious ceremony, the Buddhists filed out of the pagoda into a narrow alley along a side street, where they were blocked and ordered to stop by plain-clothed policemen. The Buddhists did not resist, but Arnett and Browne began taking photos of the confrontation. The police, who were loyal to Ngô Đình Nhu, thereupon punched Arnett in the nose, knocked him to the ground, kicked him with their pointed-toe shoes, and broke his camera. Halberstam, who won a Pulitzer Prize for his coverage of the Buddhist crisis, was a tall man, standing around [...] taller than the average Vietnamese policeman. He waded into the fracas swinging his arms, reportedly saying [...] "Get back, get <b>back,</b> <b>you</b> sons of bitches, or I'll beat the shit out of you!" [...] Nhu's men ran away without waiting for a Vietnamese translation, but not before Browne had clambered up a power pole and taken photos of Arnett's bloodied face. The police smashed Browne's camera, but his photographic film survived the impact. The other journalists were jostled and rocks were thrown at them. Photos of Arnett's bloodied face were circulated in US newspapers and caused further ill-feeling towards Diệm's regime, with the images of the burning Thích Quảng Đức on the front pages still fresh {{in the minds of the}} public.|$|E
500|$|From {{the year}} 2001 onwards, Eminem {{claimed to have}} dated Carey for six months {{throughout}} the gloomy times in her life. Carey denied ever having {{been involved with the}} rapper in a personal relationship, claiming that they had only met a handful of times, and it was professional. Subsequently, he referred to Carey in several of his songs in a negative light, claiming to have been angered by her not admitting to seeing him. On Charmbracelet, Carey included a song titled [...] "Clown", which critics suggested was aimed at Eminem. [...] "Clown"'s lyrics were described as [...] "languidly sinister" [...] by Sarah Rodman of The Boston Globe, and read: [...] "I should've left it at 'I like your music too'...You should never have intimated we were lovers / When you know very well we never even touched each other." [...] In 2005, during concerts on the rapper's Anger Management Tour, he began playing voice-mails and recordings that were reportedly left by Carey. One of the messages said: [...] "I heard you were getting back with your ex-wife. Why won't you see me? Why won't you call me?". After playing the excerpt, Eminem would pretend to be sick before launching into his song [...] "Puke". On May 12, 2009, Eminem released his sixth studio album Relapse, which included the song [...] "Bagpipes from Baghdad". The song's lyrics suggested Eminem was still in love with Carey and [...] "wanted her back": [...] "I want another crack at ya" [...] and [...] "Nick Cannon better back the f**k up.

[...] Flight attendant Sandra Bradshaw called {{her husband at}} 09:50:04 and {{told him she was}} preparing scalding water to throw at the hijackers. Passenger Lauren Grandcolas called her husband twice, once before takeoff and once during the hijacking. He missed both of her calls. She then passed her phone to Honor Elizabeth Wainio. Wainio called her stepmother at 09:53:43 and concluded, four and a half minutes later, by saying, [...] "I have to go. They're breaking into the cockpit. I love you." [...] Jarrah dialed in the VHF omnidirectional range (VOR) frequency for the VOR navigational aid at Reagan National Airport at 09:55:11 to direct the plane toward Washington, D.C. Bradshaw, on the phone with her husband, said [...] "Everyone is running up to first class. I've got to go. Bye." [...] Beamer told Jefferson that the group was planning to [...] "jump on" [...] the hijackers and fly the plane into the ground before the hijackers' plan could be followed through. Beamer recited the Lord's Prayer and the 23rd Psalm with Jefferson, prompting others to join in. Beamer requested of Jefferson, [...] "If I don't make it, please call my family and let them know how much I love them." [...] After this, Jefferson heard muffled voices and Beamer clearly answering, [...] "Are you ready? Okay. Let's roll." [...] These were Beamer's last words to Jefferson.|$|E
