Livingston also worked to reduced expenses by consolidating back office operations, metal purchases, and freight transportation. Inpro/Seal, a producer of bearing isolators, was purchased by Waukesha Bearings Corporation in 2009, which included 150,991 shares of Dover's common stock being issued to Inpro/Seal shareholders.

50|$|In early February 2014, as Bertha {{was being}} {{prepared}} to resume operation, workers discovered it was overheating {{and that a}} damaged main <b>bearing</b> <b>seal</b> needed to be replaced. Multiple options were discussed to fix the problem, but Bertha {{was expected to be}} out of commission until March 2015. In December 2014, workers began digging a 120 ft pit in order to lift Bertha's front end up to street level for repairs, but were delayed when groundwater pumping caused visible damage to nearby South King Street and some of its neighboring buildings. The front end of the machine, including the damaged cutter head, was successfully lifted onto the surface on the morning of March 31, 2015. Seattle Tunnel Partners (STP), the contractors overseeing the project, estimated that fixing Bertha would delay the opening of the new tunnel by an additional nine months to August 2017, which was later extended to March 2018 after additional damage was discovered in June 2015.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} the shape optimization {{process for the}} automotive wheel <b>bearing</b> <b>seal</b> lip using the finite {{element method and the}} response surface method. First, to predict performance of the <b>bearing</b> <b>seal</b> lip, we used the non-linear finite element analysis.

The objective function in optimizing process was obtained from results of the mud slurry test, which is one of many tests for evaluating performance of wheel bearing. After the mud slurry test for the four models which have the similar cross-sectional shape, we measured the wear area of the seal lip and the moisture content in grease. The objective function has been chosen by comparing the results of mud slurry test and characteristics of seal lip, such as contact force, contact area, contact pressure, and interference. Finally, within limited design parameters, we suggeste...|$|E

40|$|Discussion {{is given}} {{of the design}} and loss {{characteristics}} of 0. 87 kW-hr (peak) flywheel energy storage module suitable for aerospace and automotive applications. The maraging steel flywheel rotor, a 46 -cm- (18 -in-) diameter, 58 -kg (128 -lb) tapered disk, delivers 0. 65 kW-hr of usable energy between operating speeds of 10, 000 and 20, 000 rpm. The rotor is supported by 20 - and 25 -mm bore diameter, deep-groove ball bearings, lubricated by a self-replenishing wick type lubrication system. To reduce aerodynamic losses, the rotor housing was evacuated to vacuum levels from 40 to 200 millitorr. Dynamic rotor instabilities uncovered during testing necessitated {{the use of an}} elastometric-bearing damper to limit shaft excursions. Spindown losses from <b>bearing,</b> <b>seal,</b> and aerodynamic drag at 50 millitorr typically ranged from 64 to 193 W at 10, 000 and 20, 000 rpm, respectively.

40|$|A {{numerical}} model {{based on a}} transformed, conservative form of the three dimensional Navier-Stokes equation and an analytical model based on lumped fluid parameters are presented and compared with studies of modeled rotor <b>bearing</b> <b>seal</b> systems. The rotor destabilizing factors {{are related to the}} rotative character of the flow field. It is shown that these destabilizing factors can be reduced through a decrease in the fluid average circumferential velocity. However, the rotative character of the flow field is a complex three dimensional system with bifurcated secondary flow patterns that significantly alter the fluid circumferential velocity. By transforming the Navier-Stokes equations to those for a rotating observer and using the numerical code PHOENICS- 84 with a nonorthogonal body fitted grid, several numerical experiments were carried out to demonstrate the character of this complex flow field. In general, fluid injection and/or preswirl of the flow field opposing the shaft rotation significantly intensified these secondary recirculation zones and thus reduced the average circumferential velocity; injection or preswirl in the direction of rotation significantly weakened these zones...|$|E

40|$|Dascylium was an Achaemenid {{administrative}} centre, and a satrapal seat of north-western Anatolia. This paper investigates this satrapal capital's status, particularly {{its cultural}} {{association with the}} Persian heartland, and in addition serves to compare Dascylium to similar studies of Lydia, and its capital of Sardis. Archaeological evidence reveals that Dascylium's governors did not inherit monumental structures which they could adopt for their use as public buildings, {{despite the fact that}} history of the city dates back to the pre-Persian period. Instead, a new landscape evolved that we assume is the ideal satrapal centre, which can now be studied {{as a result of the}} excavations at Dascylium. Among them is included the most intriguing find; an assemblage of bullae – clay lumps <b>bearing</b> <b>seal</b> impressions – recovered from the site of the acropolis. A great number of king's legends shown on the bullae likely point to an intimate relationship between Persian sovereigns and subjects in the capital of their westernmost satrapy. The motifs of impressions also help reconstruct our image of cultural life as it was experienced by the Persian immigrants; for instance, the worship of Ahura Mazda, and hunting in paradeisoi. The reflections gleaned from these materials seem to represent those aspects of life colonists enjoyed at the empire's centre and thus brought with them to their new homeland. Some evidence also suggests the persistence of local cultures, but in a much reduced form compared to what is seen in Lydian or Sardian studies...|$|E
40|$|Analytical and {{experimental}} studies of the combustion process in a stratified charge rotary engine (SCRE) {{continue to be the}} subject of active research in recent years. Specifically to meet the demand for more sophisticated products, a detailed understanding of the engine system of interest is warranted. With this in mind the objective of this work is to develop an understanding of the controlling factors that affect the SCRE combustion process so that an efficient power dense rotary engine can be designed. The influence of the induction-exhaust systems and the rotor geometry are believed to {{have a significant effect on}} combustion chamber flow characteristics. In this report, emphasis is centered on Laser Doppler Velocimetry (LDV) measurements and on qualitative flow visualizations in the combustion chamber of the motored rotary engine assembly. This will provide a basic understanding of the flow process in the RCE and serve as a data base for verification of numerical simulations. Understanding fuel injection provisions is also important to the successful operation of the stratified charge rotary engine.
