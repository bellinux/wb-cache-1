From mid-2013 it was publicized that the NSA has been secretly monitoring and storing global internet traffic, including the <b>bulk</b> <b>data</b> collection of email and phone call data. Sales of Nineteen Eighty-Four increased by up to seven times within {{the first week of}} the 2013 mass surveillance leaks. The book again topped the Amazon.com sales charts in 2017 after a controversy involving Kellyanne Conway using the phrase [...] "alternative facts" [...] to explain discrepancies with the media.|$|E

Furthermore, the 64DD's software titles and hardware accessories let the user create movies, characters, and animations to be used within various games and shared online. The system could connect to the Internet through a now-defunct dedicated online service called Randnet for e-commerce, online gaming, and media sharing. Calling it [...] "the first writable <b>bulk</b> <b>data</b> storage device for a modern video game console", Nintendo designed the 64DD as an enabling technology platform for the development of new genres of games and applications, dozens of which were in development for several years.|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "most {{prominent}} addition" [...] to {{the protest}} was the [...] "Reform Government Surveillance" [...] coalition, which includes AOL, Twitter, LinkedIn, and Yahoo. It was not initially clear how the sites would participate. The group {{sent a letter}} to President Obama on November 11 and [...] "urged changes that would include a government agreement not to collect <b>bulk</b> <b>data</b> from Internet communications." [...] On the same day, Google announced its support for the USA Freedom Act, saying [...] "Google recognizes the very real threats that the U.S. and other countries face, but we strongly believe that government surveillance programs should operate under a legal framework that is rule-bound, narrowly tailored, transparent, and subject to oversight." [...] Matt Simons, director of social and economic justice at ThoughtWorks, nevertheless said the coalition's support of The Day We Fight Back [...] "rings a little hollow" [...] because of the late date of its announcement and its member's past disclosure of their customers' data to the NSA.|$|E

The conclusions obtained from <b>bulk</b> carbonate <b>data</b> are not as precise as those obtained from isotope studies on individual fossils which are very rare in all samples at hand. Most samples from Holes 390, 390 A, and 392 A are nannofossil oozes from the Blake Plateau; no samples of the fenestral limestone were taken.
