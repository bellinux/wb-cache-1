However, the size of the slope parameter is significantly less than one, suggesting that the government might face difficulties in financing its future debt. With respect to the revenue-expenditure nexus, the empirical evidence is favourable to the tax-spend hypothesis through the error correction term in the expenditures equation.

40|$|Unstable {{government}} debt dynamics can typically be corrected by various fiscal instruments, like appropriate adjustments in government spending, public transfers, or taxes. This paper investigates properties of state-contingent debt targeting rules which link stabilizing <b>budgetary</b> <b>adjustments</b> around a target level of long-run {{debt to the}} state of the economy. The paper establishes that the size of steady-state debt is a key determinant of whether it is possible to find a rule of this type which can be implemented under all available fiscal instruments. Specifically, considering linear feedback rules, the paper demonstrates that there may well exist a critical level of debt beyond which this is no longer possible. From an applied perspective, this finding is of particular relevance {{in the context of a}} monetary union with decentralized fiscal policies. Depending on the level of long-run debt, there might be a conflict between a common fiscal framework which tracks deficit developments as a function of the state of the economy and the unrestricted choice of fiscal policy instruments at the national level.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we provide new {{evidence}} {{on the importance of}} the so-called small state advantage for the allocation of the US federal budget. We also provide a new interpretation of the available empirical evidence. Analyzing outlays for the period 1978 - 2002, we show that not only does the population size of a state matter, but so too does its dynamics. Once population scale and change e¤ects are separated, the impact of population size is substantially reduced, and population change turns out to be an important explanatory variable of current spending patterns. The impact of scale and change e¤ects varies substantially across spending programs. Small states enjoy an advantage in defense spending, whereas fast growing ones are penalized in grants allocations. Our results imply that the interests of the states are not easily aligned around their population size alone. The distortion associated with population dynamics is concentrated on federal grants where formulas play a substantial role in limiting <b>budgetary</b> <b>adjustments.</b> Hence, {{a large part of the}} inverse relationship between spending and population appears to be driven by mechanisms of budgetary inertia which are compatible with incrementalist theories of budget allocation...|$|R

While deficit spending was the appropriate response to an unprecedented crisis, correcting these imbalances is now a critical challenge for economic policymakers. � Empirical evidence is equivocal about the appropriate size of government in the long run. But history does provide guidance as to how governments can correct large fiscal imbalances, while protecting economic growth. � In a review of every major fiscal correction in the OECD since 1975, we find that decisive <b>budgetary</b> <b>adjustments</b> that have focused on reducing government expenditure have (i) been successful in correcting fiscal imbalances; (ii) typically boosted growth; and (iii) resulted in significant bond and equity market outperformance. Tax-driven fiscal adjustments, by contrast, typically fail to correct fiscal imbalances and are damaging for growth. � The trade-off between withdrawing the stimulus too soon (and threatening the economy’s nascent recovery) and delaying the correction (and threatening a debt crisis) largely disappears when severe fiscal imbalances are corrected through reduced government expenditure. � Our results are robust to controlling for prior economic conditions that might otherwise explain growth differences. They are also consistent with the findings of previous academic work in this area. � That said, decisive expenditure-driven fiscal adjustments are politically difficult to implement and tend to take place only following a change in government and/or once bond markets force the government’s hand...|$|R
50|$|In November 2010 the Irish {{government}} {{published a}} National Recovery plan, which aimed {{to restore order}} to the public finances and to bring its deficit {{in line with the}} EU target of 3% of economic output by 2015. The plan envisaged a budget adjustment of €15 billion (€10 billion in public expenditure cuts and €5 billion in taxes) over a four-year period. This was front-loaded in 2011, when measures totalling €6 billion took place. Subsequent <b>budgetary</b> <b>adjustments</b> of €3 billion per year were put in place up to 2015, to reduce the government deficit to less than 3% of GDP. VAT would increase to 23% by 2014. A property tax was re-introduced in 2012. This was initially charged in 2012 as a flat rate on all properties and subsequently charged at a level of 0.18% of the estimated market-value of a property from 2013. Domestic water charges are to be introduced in 2015. Expenditure cuts included reductions in public sector pay levels, reductions in the number of public sector employees through early retirement schemes, reduced social welfare payments and reduced health spending.As a result of increased taxation and decreased government spending the Central Statistics Office (Ireland) reported that the Irish government deficit had decreased from 32.5% of GDP in 2010 (a level boosted by one-off support payments to the financial sector) to 5.7% of GDP in 2013. In addition Ireland's unemployment rate fell from a peak of 15.1% in February 2012 to 10.6% in December 2014. The number of people in employment increased by 58,000 (3.1% increase in employment rate) in the year to September 2013.

40|$|The {{transition}} process {{covers all}} sides of the economic system. The experience of the transition countries shows that the budgetary policy {{has been one of the}} most complicated elements of the transition process. Speaking about the role of the budgetary policy during the transition process, one can talk about two generations of the budgetary reforms. In the initial phases of the transition the first generation of the reforms was concentrated on the quantitative adjustment of the budget to the actual macroeconomic situation. It included the reduction of the deficit and debts, the dissolution of the interaction between the money supply growth and the financing of the budget deficit as well as the dismantling of the soft budget constraints. Nowadays when the overall economic stabilisation has been mainly reached in the transition countries and the fundamentals of the market-based institutions have been established, these countries are in the "post transition" stage which, in its turn, puts new challenges before them: such as strengthening the achieved macroeconomic stabilisation results and the sustainability of the budgetary policy, improving the functionality of market-based institutions and realising the structural reforms. First of all the budgetary policy should aim at the quality of the <b>budgetary</b> <b>adjustments,</b> thus determining the second generation of the budgetary reforms. The sustainability has been an important priority of the budgetary policy at all stages of the transition process. Indeed, assessing the sustainability on the basis of the size of the deficit and debts has been and still remains the most widely used method of evaluating the budgetary position of a transition economy. The opinion which is defended in this paper is that this method does not give enough information about the load-carrying sustainability of the budgetary policy. In this paper the stages of the transformation process have been characterised from the perspective of the changes of the budgetary policy and the conclusions have been formulated with the regard to the factors which determine the load-carrying sustainability of the budgetary policy and the budgetary risks. Moreover, the attempt has been taken, using the multidimensional approach, to observe the load-carrying sustainability of the budgetary policy in the interaction with the following factors: initial conditions, macroeconomic stability, structural and institutional reforms. The theoretical considerations have been applied to the Ukraine...|$|R
40|$|Using {{evidence}} from seven hyperinflationary episodes in four Latin American {{countries in the}} second half of the 1980 s, John Rogers and Ping Wang examine the causes and consequences of high inflation. The article emphasizes four issues: the welfare costs of inflation and real costs of stabilization, the common features of the chronically high inflations experienced in Latin American countries, the main causes of high inflation, and the widely different outcomes of several stabilization programs.; Rogers and Wang find that the welfare costs of even moderate periods of inflation may not be negligible, whereas the adverse macroeconomic effects of stabilization efforts are mostly temporary. The authors show that the spiral-like adjustment of the government budget and monetary growth may result in a high-inflation trap. The main causes of chronically high inflation include continuous fiscal-monetary extension, productivity slowdown, systematic undervaluation of the domestic currency, and diminished credibility of anti-inflation policies. Successful stabilization, in essence, results from <b>budgetary</b> <b>adjustment,</b> market liberalization, and the adoption of a nominal anchor (such as the nominal exchange rate), all of which ensure credibility of the public authorities.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the determinants of}} financial flows between {{the federal government and}} regional authorities in Russia. The main question is to what extent intergovernmental transfers correspond to the ‘ideal pattern’ – equalisation of the abilities of the regions to provide public goods – and to what extent, if at all, they reflect the influence of federal–regional political discourse (asymmetrical federalism). The main finding is that actual net transfers since 1994, although quite close to the ‘ideal patterns’, depended also on the results of the parliamentary (1993, 1995, 1999) and presidential (1996, 2000) elections and on the relations of the regions with the federal centre. The more votes cast for pro-central government parties in parliamentary elections and for Yeltsin in the 1996 presidential elections and the lower the tensions with Moscow after the elections, the more favourable was the fiscal balance for the region with the federal centre.

Further, clear differences among the states are found in (i) debt servicing and taxation changes as grant revenue increases; (ii) tax regimes in response to increasing net debt receipts; and (iii) debt servicing and taxation policy in times of increasing expenditure. Overall, the states have mostly been marginally unaffected by interest or unemployment rate changes over the period examined.

The estimation of separate fiscal policy reaction functions in good and bad times reveals that, controlling for other factors, the average stance of fiscal policy is expansionary when output is above potential, thus denoting a pro-cyclical bias in good times, while no strong evidence of a cyclical bias is found in bad times. The separate estimation of reaction functions for revenue and expenditure policy indicates that this pro-cyclical bias is an entirely expenditure-driven phenomenon. Probit regressions also reveal {{that the risk of}} pro-cyclicality in good times stems from expenditure behaviour, since expenditure-based <b>budgetary</b> <b>adjustment</b> is a highly significant determinant of the probability of pro-cyclical fiscal policy in good times.
