5|$|Waddington first {{played for}} Yorkshire after the First World War, {{when the team}} had been {{weakened}} by injuries and retirements. He made an immediate impression in 1919, his first season; he took 100 wickets and was largely responsible for Yorkshire's victory in the County Championship that year. After a similarly successful season in 1920, he was selected for the 1920–21 Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) tour of Australia, during which he appeared {{in two of the}} five Tests. However, the England team were outclassed; used in an unfamiliar tactical role, Waddington took just one wicket and never played for England again. He continued to be effective for Yorkshire, particularly against the weaker counties, but was often inconsistent. His reputation as an uncompromising opponent was cemented when he was found guilty of dissent and inciting the crowd in a game against Middlesex. A succession of injuries reduced his effectiveness and he retired from first-class cricket in 1927. He continued to play league cricket and worked for the family <b>business,</b> <b>a</b> fat-refining firm, but maintained his connection with Yorkshire cricket.|$|E
5|$|Because {{of release}} schedules—especially {{in the case}} of films {{released}} {{towards the end of the}} year—and different release patterns across the world, many films can do business in two or more calendar years; therefore the grosses documented here are not confined to just the year of release. Grosses are not limited to original theatrical runs either, with many older films often being re-released periodically so the figures represent all the <b>business</b> <b>a</b> film has done since its original release; a film's first-run gross is included in brackets after the total if known. Because of incomplete data it cannot be known for sure how much money some films have made and when they made it, but generally the chart chronicles the films from each year that went on to earn the most. In the cases where estimates conflict both films are recorded, and in cases where a film has moved into first place because of being re-released the previous record-holder is also retained. At least one film every year has generated $100 million in gross revenue at the box office since 1967, and from 2008 each year has succeeded in producing a billion dollar grossing film.|$|E

5|$|Despite having {{previously}} {{shown little}} inclination toward politics, Brown surprised political observers by declaring his candidacy {{for governor in}} 1979. With the state and nation facing difficult economic times, Brown promised to run the state government like a <b>business.</b> <b>A</b> strong media campaign funded by his personal fortune allowed him to win the Democratic primary {{and go on to}} defeat former Republican governor Louie B.

During his tenure, Brown exerted less influence over the legislature than previous governors and was frequently absent from the state, leaving lieutenant governor Martha Layne Collins as acting governor for more than one quarter of his term. He briefly considered a run for the U.S. Senate after his gubernatorial term, but withdrew from the race after only three weeks, citing health issues. He has continued to invest in business ventures, the most high profile of which was Kenny Rogers Roasters, a wood-roasted chicken restaurant he founded with country music star Kenny Rogers.|$|E
5|$|Johnson began {{thinking}} of life after basketball while still {{playing with the}} Lakers. He wondered why so many athletes had failed at business, and sought advice. During his seventh season in the NBA, he {{had a meeting with}} Michael Ovitz, CEO of Creative Artists Agency. Ovitz encouraged him to start reading business magazines and to use every connection available to him. Johnson learned everything he could about business, often meeting with corporate executives during road trips. Johnson's first foray into <b>business,</b> <b>a</b> high-end sporting goods store named Magic 32, failed after only one year, costing him $200,000. The experience taught him to listen to his customers and find out what products they wanted. Johnson has become a leading voice on how to invest in urban communities, creating redevelopment opportunities in underserved areas, most notably through his movie theaters and his partnership with Starbucks. He went to Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz with the idea that he could successfully open the coffee shops in urban areas. After showing Schultz the tremendous buying power of minorities, Johnson was able to purchase 125 Starbucks stores, which reported higher than average per capita sales. The partnership, called Urban Coffee Opportunities, placed Starbucks in locations such as Detroit, Washington, D.C., Harlem, and the Crenshaw District of Los Angeles. Johnson sold his remaining interest in the stores back to the company in 2010, ending a successful twelve-year partnership. Johnson has also invested in urban California real estate and financial service companies catering to America's underserved markets via his Canyon-Johnson and Yucaipa-Johnson funds. Another major project is with Chicago-based Aon Corp., an insurance services company is designed to promote minority businesses. In 2006-07, Johnson was part of a syndicate that bought the Williamsburgh Savings Bank Tower, then the tallest building in Brooklyn, for $71 million and converted the 512-foot high landmark structure from an office building into luxury condominiums.|$|E
5|$|MD 30 {{originated}} in the colonial era {{as part of a}} wagon road connecting the fledgling port of Baltimore with the new settlement that was to become Hanover. This highway was improved as a turnpike in the 19th century. MD 30 was constructed as a state road by the Maryland State Roads Commission in the late 1910s and early 1920s, and it became one of the original state-numbered highways in 1927. The state highway was relocated and widened near Reisterstown in the late 1930s and along the rest of its route in the early 1950s. The Hampstead Bypass was planned as early as the 1960s to ameliorate the increasing congestion along the MD 30 corridor that was only exacerbated when I-795 was completed to Reisterstown in the late 1980s. However, the construction of the bypass was continually delayed due to environmental issues and politics. The bypass was finally constructed between 2006 and 2009; the old highway through Hampstead became MD 30 <b>Business.</b> <b>A</b> MD 30 bypass of Manchester has also been discussed since the 1960s, but the Maryland State Highway Administration (MDSHA) has no plans to construct the new highway in the foreseeable future.|$|E
