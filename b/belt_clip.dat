2500|$|On September 12, 2006, Apple {{announced}} {{the release of}} the second generation iPod Shuffle, calling it [...] "the most wearable iPod ever". First shipments of the unit were slated for an October 2006 arrival, but actually started shipping on Friday, November 3, 2006. The second generation initially featured a lone 1GB model in a silver brushed aluminum case, similar to the second generation iPod Nano and the older iPod Mini. The new model was less than half the size of the first generation model at 41.2 x 27.3 x 10.5mm (1.62 x 1.07 x 0.41in), and was the size of the iPod Radio Remote. Apple claimed it was the [...] "world's smallest MP3 player". This generation included the new built-in <b>belt</b> <b>clip,</b> and the actual unit itself was thinner, with the entire device weighing only 15.5g (0.55ounces). The power/shuffle/no shuffle switch from the first generation version was separated into two controls to avoid an accidentally selected mode of operation. The formatting of the iPod itself was new to Apple, as the 2nd generation Shuffle only formatted itself to FAT32.|$|E

50|$|While the gunong {{dates back}} centuries before colonial times, {{it became more}} {{prevalent}} in 1915 when General John J. Pershing issued an order outlawing the wearing of swords. Now unable to carry traditional machetes or broadswords, people turned to the gunong {{to fill the gap}} without arousing the fears of the American colonial authorities. Around this time, the gunong became larger and was crafted with a pistol-grip handle rather than the old straight hilts. More extravagant fittings with chased bands on scabbards, <b>belt</b> <b>clips,</b> guards, and bulbous ferrules also became common. After World War II, thinner-bladed gunong were made from newer materials like nickel and aluminium.|$|R

Bullets, <b>belt</b> <b>clips,</b> and other artifacts from the Civil War {{have been found in}} those areas well into the 20th century. Christ Church, because of its association with George Washington, was not closed, but came under the control of army chaplains {{for the duration of the}} war. For African American escaped slaves, the military occupation of Alexandria created opportunity on an unprecedented scale. As Federal troops extended their occupation of the seceded states, escaped slaves flooded into Union-controlled areas. Safely behind Union lines, the cities of Alexandria and Washington offered not only comparative freedom, but employment. Over the course of the war, Alexandria was transformed by the Union occupiers into a major supply depot and transport and hospital center, all under army control.|$|R
50|$|The P-11 was {{designed}} by Swedish-born George Kellgren, the designer of many earlier Husqvarna (Sweden), Intratec, and Grendel brand firearms. The P-11 uses an aluminum receiver inside a polymer grip housing held on with polymer pins. The slide, barrel, and magazine are steel. The standard magazine holds 10 rounds, or 12 rounds in states not limited to 10-round magazines. Both fit flush {{to the bottom of}} the pistol. At 17.1 oz unloaded, the handgun itself is comparatively light. The P-11 lacks an external manual safety, relying instead on a long and heavy double action only (DAO) trigger pull, which requires 9 pounds of pressure, to prevent accidental discharge. A firing pin spring and low-mass hammer prevent discharge if the gun is dropped. The P-11 will also accept some Smith & Wesson 59 series magazines. An available adapter wraps around the base of 15-round Smith & Wesson model 59-style magazines. Smith & Wesson series 69 compact 12-round magazines will also work, with a matching short adapter sleeve, as well. Accessories such as trigger shoes, finger-rests, <b>belt</b> <b>clips,</b> steel guide rods to replace the factory installed polymer guide rod, gray- and OD green-colored polymer grip housings, night sights, and other accessories are also available from the manufacturer.|$|R

This allows the body light to be easily {{attached}} to clothes, or stuck on any magnetic metal such as buttons or <b>belt</b> buckles. <b>Clips</b> are often used to make earrings, a loop can make a pendant, or a ring can be welded to the back to make a finger ring. Double sided adhesive pads are sometimes used to stick the blinky directly to the body, most often in the navel.|$|R

The use of shot can also be more comfortable, as the shot conforms to the diver's body. Weight belts using shot are called shot belts. Each shot pellet should be coated to prevent corrosion by sea water, as use of uncoated shotgun shot for sea diving would result in the lead eventually corroding into powdery lead chloride ...|$|R
5000|$|The Weimar Republic {{revived the}} Stielhandgranate, {{and created a}} new version in 1924, the [...] "Model 1924 Stielhandgranate" [...] (M24) This design, unlike the {{previous}} M1916 and M1917, did include some rather significant changes to the original. While still retaining the same explosive, and same fuse, the main distinction between the Model 1924 and Model 1915 is a slightly shorter charge head, and most significantly the removal of a <b>belt</b> carry <b>clip.</b> Another very minor change in the design was a lengthening of the wooden handle. The intent of these design alterations was simply for mobility; German soldiers could easily (and often did) tuck the grenade in behind their uniform's belt, held tight and secure. Being slightly lighter, and smaller in thickness, it improved usage overall.|$|R
50|$|Wheelchair taxicabs {{are most}} often {{specially}} modified vans or minivans. Wheelchair-using passengers are loaded, {{with the help of}} the driver, via a lift or, more commonly, a ramp, at the rear of the vehicle. This feature is however a subject for concern amongst Licensing Authorities who feel that the wheelchair passenger could not easily exit the vehicle in the event of accident damage to the rear door. The latest generation of accessible taxis features side loading with emergency egress possible from either of the 2 side doors as well as the rear. The wheelchair is secured using various systems, commonly including some type of <b>belt</b> and <b>clip</b> combination, or wheel locks. Some wheelchair taxicabs are capable of transporting only one wheelchair-using passenger at a time, and can usually accommodate 4 to 6 additional able-bodied passengers.|$|R

40|$|AbstractAfter {{removing}} frozen {{sea buckthorn}} berries from {{the branches of}} sea buckthorn tree in a separator (patent EE 05717 B 1), the berries fall onto separator's moving conveyer belt under a certain angle of inclination, thus guiding the berries in the collector of separator. This paper presents the mathematical model of the berry motion along the conveyer and after falling from it. The nonlinear differential equations describing the berry motion on the conveyer and after falling from it take into account air resistance depending on the square value of berry's absolute velocity. All these equations were solved numerically by using Runge-Kutta method of 4 th order on Mathcad worksheet. This paper focuses on berry motion depending on belt velocity, friction coefficient between belt and berry, and inclination angle of the <b>belt.</b> Composed video <b>clip</b> visualizes berry motion and demonstrates how the berry moves from the initial position {{in the same direction}} as conveyer belt velocity, down to lower edge of the belt and falls from conveyer. Results of this paper can be used by engineers designing conveyors and by educators teaching agricultural machinery...|$|R
50|$|A stable belt {{is a wide}} webbing belt, {{usually a}} single solid colour or {{horizontally}} striped in two or more different colours. It is worn around the waist and when worn with Combat Soldier 95 it is worn through the trouser belt loops. In the British Army or Royal Marines, when worn with barrack dress, the belt is placed either in the belt loops of trousers or a skirt or over a jersey. In the Royal Air Force, it is worn with service working dress (No. 2 dress) either covering {{the top of the}} trousers (or skirt) and {{the lower part of the}} shirt or through the belt loops if they have been specially designed to accommodate the belt's width. Unlike the Army, it is never worn over a jersey. The original cavalry stable belts buckled at the side to avoid chafing the soldier's stomach as he bent down during stable work and also to avoid marking or catching on the horse harness, but many stable <b>belts</b> are now <b>clipped</b> at the front, sometimes behind a metal belt plate (usually bearing the badge of the regiment), although a few regiments such as the Light Infantry <b>clip</b> their stable <b>belts</b> at the front with the original two leather straps. A large number of units, however, continue to use the traditional method of securing the belt using two leather straps and metal buckles at the left-hand side.|$|R

50|$|The A2 {{had many}} {{innovative}} ideas, {{such as the}} space floor storage system which was a box that slotted in the rear passenger foot well, a rear cup holder which unclipped, and a double (false) floor boot where items could be hidden from thieves or where the space saver spare wheel could be stored. The warning triangle and first aid kit are stowed directly {{to the left of}} the boot opening. The toolkit was stored, depending on equipment, next to the battery. If space was needed for the navigation system and/or the Bose subwoofer, it was moved to the sandwich compartment in front of the right-front seat (driver on UK cars, passenger on LHD ones). The headrests also do not need to be removed from the rear seats when they are folded, and a four-seater can have the rear seats removed in a matter of seconds. The rear seat <b>belts</b> have a <b>clip</b> in the upper section of the c-pillar, so that when the seats are folded and returned to their normal position, the belts do not get tangled.More examples of energy saving can be found in the glovebox light that only turns on when the lights are on and the freewheel pulley on the alternator belt, meaning that the alternator is only used when necessary. The climate compressor is also turned off when the ambient temperature drops below 5 degrees C.The ECON function of the climate control (where fitted) also turns off the auxiliary heating or the compressor, depending on temperature. This functionality is unaffected by the presence of fuel-powered or electrical auxiliary heating.|$|R
40|$|Music is used {{to induce}} moods in {{experimental}} settings {{as well as for}} therapeutic purposes. Prior studies suggest that subjects listening to certain types of music experience strong moods and show physiological responses associated with the induced emotions. We hypothesized that cardiovascular and respiratory patterns could discriminate moods induced via music. 18 healthy subjects listened to 12 music clips, four each to induce happiness, sadness, and fear, while cardiovascular and respiratory responses were recorded using an electrocardiogram and chest strain-gauge <b>belt.</b> After each <b>clip</b> subjects completed a questionnaire. Subjects consistently reported experiencing the targeted mood, suggesting successful mood induction. Cardiovascular activity was measured by calculating time domain measures and heart rate changes during each clip. Respiratory activity was measured by total, inspiration, and expiration lengths as well as changes in mean respiration rate during each clip. Evaluation of individuals' patterns and mixed-model analyses were performed. Contrary to expectations, the time domain measures of subjects' cardiovascular responses did not vary significantly between the induced moods, although a heart rate deceleration was found during the sadness inductions and acceleration during the fear inductions. The time domain respiratory measures varied with clip type: the mean breath length was longest for the sad induction, intermediate during fear, and shortest during the happiness induction. However, analysis using normalized least mean squares adaptive filters to measure time correlation indicated that much of this difference may be attributable to entrainment of respiration to characteristics of the music which varied between the stimuli. Our findings point to the difficulty in detecting psychophysiological correlates of mood induction, and further suggest that part of this difficulty may arise from failure to differentiate it from tempo-related contributions when music is used as the inducer...|$|R
40|$|A {{laboratory}} {{study was conducted}} to quantify the effects of belt-positioning boosters on lap and shoulder belt fit. Postures and belt fit were measured for forty-four boys and girls ages 5 to 12 in four highback boosters, one backless booster, and on a vehicle seat without a booster. Belt anchorage locations were varied over a wide range. Seat cushion angle, seat back angle, and seat cushion length were varied in the no-booster conditions. All boosters produced better mean lap belt fit than was observed in the no-booster condition, but the differences among boosters were relatively large. With one midrange belt configuration, the lap belt was not fully below the anterior-superior iliac spine (ASIS) landmark {{on the front of the}} pelvis for 89 % of children in one booster, and 75 % of children failed to achieve that level of belt fit in another. In contrast, the lap belt was fully below the ASIS for all but two children in the best-performing booster. Child body size had a statistically significant but relatively small effect on lap belt fit. The largest children sitting without a booster had approximately the same lap belt fit as the smallest children experienced in the worst-performing booster. Increasing lap belt angle relative to horizontal produced significantly better lap belt fit in the no-booster condition, but the boosters isolated the children from the effects of lap belt angles. Reducing seat cushion length in the no-booster condition improved lap belt fit but changing cushion angle did not. Belt upper anchorage (D-ring) location had a strong effect on shoulder belt fit in conditions without shoulder belt routing from the booster. Unexpectedly, the worst average shoulder belt fit was observed in one highback booster with a poorly positioned shoulder <b>belt</b> routing <b>clip.</b> The shoulder <b>belt</b> was routed more outboard, on average, with a backless booster than without a booster, but raising the child also amplified the effect of D-ring location, such that children were more likely to experience poor shoulder belt fit due to outboard and forward D-ring locations when sitting on the booster. Taller children experienced more-outboard shoulder belt fit in conditions without shoulder belt routing by the booster and in the one booster with poor shoulder belt routing. Adjustable shoulder belt routing on three of the highback boosters effectively eliminated stature effects, providing approximately the same shoulder belt fit for all children. Seat back angle did not have a significant effect on shoulder belt fit. The belt fit was measured in each test condition using the 6 YO and 10 YO Hybrid-III ATDs. ATD belt fit was strongly correlated with child belt fit across test conditions, but offsets between the ATD and child belt fit scores were observed due to anatomical and postural differences between the ATDs and children. The results of this study have broad applicability toward the improvement of occupant restraints for children. The data show substantial effects of booster design on belt fit, particularly the effects of alternative lap and torso belt routing approaches. Regression analyses quantify the critical importance of belt anchorage location for child belt fit, providing an important foundation for efforts to optimize belt geometry for children. The strong correlation between ATD and child belt fit scores means that ATD-based measurements can reliably be used to assess booster and vehicle designs with respect to child belt fit...|$|R
