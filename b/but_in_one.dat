5|$|Childhood {{mortality}} {{was high}} in Medieval Scotland. Children were often baptised rapidly, by laymen and occasionally by midwives, {{because of the}} belief that unbaptised children would be dammed. It was more normally undertaken in a church and was a means of creating wider spiritual kinship with godparents. Cemeteries may not represent {{a cross section of}} Medieval society, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>one</b> Aberdeen cemetery 53 per cent of those buried were under the age of six and in one Linlithgow cemetery it was 58 per cent. Iron deficiency anaemia seems to have been common among children, probably caused by long-term breastfeeding by mothers that were themselves deficient in minerals. Common childhood diseases included measles, diphtheria and whooping-cough, while parasites were also common. In Lowland noble and wealthy society by the fifteenth century the practice of wet-nursing had become common. In Highland society there was a system of fosterage among clan leaders, where boys and girls would leave their parent's house to be brought up in that of other chiefs, creating a fictive bond of kinship that helped cement alliances and mutual bonds of obligation. The majority of children, even in urban centres where opportunities for formal education were greatest, did not attend school. In the families of craftsmen children probably carried out simpler tasks. They might later become apprentices or journeymen. In Lowland rural society, as in England, many young people, both male and female, probably left home to become domestic and agricultural servants, as they can be seen doing in large numbers from the sixteenth century. By the late Medieval era, Lowland society was probably part of the north-west European marriage model, of life-cycle service and late marriage, usually in the mid-20s, delayed by the need to acquire the resources to be able to form a household.|$|E
5|$|Often, all the mayflies in a {{population}} mature at once (a hatch), and {{for a day or}} two in the spring or autumn, mayflies are everywhere, dancing around each other in large groups, or resting on every available surface. In many species the emergence is synchronised with dawn or dusk, and light intensity seems to be an important cue for emergence, but other factors may also be involved. Baetis intercalaris, for example, usually emerges just after sunset in July and August, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>one</b> year, a large hatch was observed at midday in June. The soft-bodied subimagos are very attractive to predators. Synchronous emergence is probably an adaptive strategy that reduces the individual's risk of being eaten. The lifespan of an adult mayfly is very short, varying with the species. The primary function of the adult is reproduction; adults do not feed, and have only vestigial (unusable) mouthparts, while their digestive systems are filled with air. Dolania americana has the shortest lifespan of any mayfly: the adult females of the species live for less than five minutes.|$|E

5|$|Tallon was {{selected}} for but withdrew from the 194950 tour to South Africa due to illness caused by stomach ulcers, and employment reasons. His place was taken by Saggers, who made 21 dismissals in the five Tests. In the meantime, Tallon recovered and played in the Australian domestic season. After scoring 52 in the opening match for the season, he scored 98 and two scores of 58 not out to help Queensland end the season with consecutive wins. He ended with 349 runs at 43.63 and 11 dismissals in six matches. Tallon {{was selected}} for a brief tour of New Zealand {{at the end of}} the season with an Australian Second XI led by Bill Brown, and scored 116 in an unofficial Test in Dunedin. It was the top-score in Australia's 299 and the hosts led by only eight runs with one wicket in hand in their second innings when the match ended in a draw. Many of the matches during the tour were not first-class <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>one</b> such game, Tallon scored 70 not out as Australia defeated Otago by an innings.|$|E

25|$|In Greek mythology, Athena was {{believed}} to have been born from the head of her father Zeus. She was known as Athena Parthenos ("Athena the Virgin"), <b>but,</b> <b>in</b> <b>one</b> archaic Attic myth, the god Hephaestus tried and failed to rape her, resulting in Gaia giving birth to Erichthonius. In the founding myth of Athens, Athena bested Poseidon in a competition over patronage of the city by creating the first olive tree. Along with Aphrodite and Hera, Athena was one of the three goddesses whose feud resulted {{in the beginning of the}} Trojan War.|$|E
25|$|By 1960, {{changes were}} in place, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>one</b> respect, nothing much had happened. Desegregation was still only tolerated, not embraced, {{by the general}} public.

By the early 1960s, he was {{on the board of the}} Salesmanship Club, and by 1965, he was president of the Salesmanship Club and a member of the Citizens Council. In 1968, he was entrusted with leadership of the Greater Dallas Council of Churches and then the Community Relations Commission, both of which pushed him into the center of local race relations.|$|E
25|$|The {{restriction}} on weight meant the torpedo {{could not be}} fired from a torpedo tube, but instead was carried in a rear-facing trough. On firing it was pushed backwards by a cordite firing pistol and a long steel ram, entering the water tail-first. A trip-wire between the torpedo and the ram head would start the torpedo motors once pulled taut during release. The CMB would then turn hard over {{and get out of}} its path. There is no record of a CMB ever being hit by its own torpedo, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>one</b> instance the firing pistol was triggered prematurely and the crew had a tense 20 minutes close to the enemy whilst reloading it.|$|E

25|$|Being descendents {{of divine}} unions with privileged mortals, mythical heroes are an {{intermediate}} group between gods and men, {{and they are}} sympathetic to human ambitions. Thus, for example, Pindar not only invokes Zeus for help {{on behalf of the}} island of Aegina, but also its national heroes Aeacus, Peleus and Telamon. Unlike the gods, however, heroes can be judged according to ordinary human standards and they are sometimes shown in the poems to demean themselves. Even in that case, they receive special consideration. Thus Pindar refers obliquely to the murder of Phocus by his brothers Peleus and Telamon ("I am shy of speaking of a huge risk, hazarded not in right"), telling the audience that he will not talk of it ("silence is a man's wisest counsel"). The Theban hero Heracles was a favourite subject <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>one</b> poem he is depicted as small in order to be compared with a small Theban patron who had won the pankration at the Isthmian Games: a unique example of Pindar's readiness to shape traditional myths to fit the occasion, even if not always flattering to the mythical hero. A hero's status is not diminished by an occasional blemish but rests on a summary view of his heroic exploits.|$|E

The flesh is thick and white. When bruised or injured, the flesh either does not change color, or may stain pale yellowish, then often slowly discolors pinkish. The odor of the crushed flesh is mild or faintly phenolic, but is usually distinctly phenolic {{in the base of}} the stipe.|$|E
500|$|Pliny the Elder {{discusses}} beetles in his Natural History, {{describing the}} stag beetle: [...] "Some insects, {{for the preservation}} of their wings, are covered with a erust (elytra) – the beetle, for instance, the wing of which is peculiarly fine and frail. To these insects a sting has been denied by Nature; <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>one</b> large kind we find horns of a remarkable length, two-pronged at the extremities, and forming pincers, which the animal closes when it is its intention to bite." [...] The stag beetle is recorded in a Greek myth by Nicander and recalled by Antoninus Liberalis in which Cerambus is turned into a beetle: [...] "He can be seen on trunks and has hook-teeth, ever moving his jaws together. He is black, long and has hard wings like a great dung beetle". The story concludes with the comment that the beetles were used as toys by young boys, and that the head was removed and worn as a pendant.|$|E
