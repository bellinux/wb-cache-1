5|$|Beginning in 1976, Bob Lewis, an {{environmental}} activist in Aspen, organized revegetation efforts on some {{sections of the}} pass near the road that were having serious erosion problems. He realized eventually that a dedicated nonprofit organization would be a <b>better</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> address the many issues that remained. The Independence Pass Foundation (IPF) was established in 1989. Its first project, coordinated with the Forest Service, CDOT and Pitkin County, was the reconstruction of a curve near the popular Weller Lake trailhead.|$|E
5|$|Trying {{to come up}} with a <b>better</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> {{generate}} alternating current, Tesla {{developed a}} steam powered reciprocating electricity generator. He patented it in 1893 and introduced it at the Chicago World's Columbian Exposition that year. Steam would be forced into the oscillator and rush out through a series of ports, pushing a piston up and down that was attached to an armature. The magnetic armature vibrated up and down at high speed, producing an alternating magnetic field. This induced alternating electric current in the wire coils located adjacent. It did away with the complicated parts of a steam engine/generator, but never caught on as a feasible engineering solution to generate electricity.|$|E
5|$|While being {{examined}} {{to increase his}} ninja rank, Naruto meets the legendary ninja Jiraiya and learns how to summon toads to aid him in battle, and to control part of the Nine Tails's chakra energy. The exams are interrupted by the invasion of Konohagakure by the criminal Orochimaru and the ninja of Sunagakure. Naruto defeats the sand village's One Tail Jinchuriki Gaara and convinces him there is a <b>better</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> live. Shortly afterward, Naruto discovers the Akatsuki, a criminal organization that seeks to extract the Nine-Tails from his body. Though Jiraiya drives them off during this first meeting, learning its member Itachi is both Sasuke's brother, {{and the man who}} killed their family, the Akatsuki still plan to kidnap Naruto. While accompanying Jiraiya to find a new village leader, Naruto also learns the Rasengan, a sphere of chakra for offensive purposes. When Sasuke leaves the village to join Orochimaru's forces to obtain the power to kill Itachi, Naruto becomes part of a rescue team to retrieve him. Naruto and Sasuke ultimately have a one-on-one battle, though neither can bring himself to finish off the other. The two go their separate ways, but Naruto does not give up on Sasuke, leaving Konoha with Jiraiya to prepare himself for his next encounter with Sasuke and the Akatsuki.|$|E

25|$|Despite the low {{production}} rate, Mitchell Energy owner George P. Mitchell {{was convinced}} that he could find a <b>better</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> produce gas from the Barnett. Mitchell persevered for years {{in the face of}} low production rates in his initial wells, low gas prices, and low profitability. Industry commentators have written that few, if any, other companies would have continued drilling well after well in the Barnett Shale. Mitchell is widely credited with personally making a success of the Barnett Shale, and thus creating the gas production boom in the Barnett, and, when other companies imitated his techniques, many other shale-gas and tight-oil successes in the US and other countries.|$|E

25|$|Simply {{examining}} {{the performance of}} the best known value investors would not be instructive, because investors do not become well known unless they are successful. This introduces a selection bias. A <b>better</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> investigate the performance of a group of value investors was suggested by Warren Buffett, in his May 17, 1984 speech that was published as The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville. In this speech, Buffett examined the performance of those investors who worked at Graham-Newman Corporation and were thus most influenced by Benjamin Graham. Buffett's conclusion is identical to that of the academic research on simple value investing strategies—value investing is, on average, successful in the long run.|$|E
25|$|Crematoria in Europe {{were built}} in 1878 {{in the town of}} Gotha in Germany and later in Heidelberg in 1891. The first modern crematory in the U.S. was built in 1876 by Francis Julius LeMoyne after hearing about its use in Europe. During that time it was thought that people were getting sick by {{attending}} funerals of those recently deceased and that decomposing bodies were leaking into the water systems. LeMoyne built the crematory to cremate bodies in a controlled environment primarily for sanitary reasons. Cremation was used to destroy any organic matter that could cause illness and give families a <b>better</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> preserve ashes. Before LeMoyne’s crematory closed in 1901, it had performed 42 cremations.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the many}} values of {{dialogue}} journals is the opportunity {{for the teacher to}} provide informal counseling in a non-threatening, private context for individual students on their challenges and problems, whether about instructional or personal concerns. This use is closest to the goal and practice of Mrs. Reed, the original 6th grade teacher who had taken training with Dr. William Glasser on Reality Therapy for classroom teachers. The training led her to use the private written conversations to model the pragmatic, problem-solving perspective of Reality Therapy and to encourage students to think through issues and problems with her guidance. Of her writing with the students, she said, “I cannot think of any <b>better</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> learn so much about my students, myself, and my own teaching”.|$|E

25|$|Persons {{noted that}} the point of entry for the Spanish would have been from Scotland, Kent, or Milford Haven in Wales, citing that Henry VII had {{successfully}} invaded from there in 1485. Here it was believed the Spaniards would find a vast reservoir of Catholic support. Detailed charts on the ports of England and Wales had been drawn up, and other plans suggested occupying the Isle of Wight. A number of the King's advisers however saw an invasion of Ireland as a <b>better</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> destabilize England. The use of Ireland as a springboard for a new invasion was nothing new; Marquis of Santa Cruz, the first commander of the Spanish Armada, had advocated landing in Cork or Wexford in 1586. The plan was only scrapped because of the delays caused by Drake's raid on Cadiz the following year.|$|E
25|$|In 1942 a {{rationing}} {{system was}} begun to guarantee minimum amounts of necessities to everyone (especially poor people) and prevent inflation. Tires {{were the first}} item to be rationed in January 1942 because supplies of natural rubber were interrupted. Gasoline rationing proved an even <b>better</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> allocate scarce rubber. In June 1942 the Combined Food Board {{was set up to}} coordinate the worldwide supply of food to the Allies, with special attention to flows from the U.S. and Canada to Britain. By 1943 one needed government issued ration coupons to purchase coffee, sugar, meat, cheese, butter, lard, margarine, canned foods, dried fruits, jam, gasoline, bicycles, fuel oil, clothing, silk or nylon stockings, shoes, and many other items. Some items, like automobiles and home appliances, were no longer made. The rationing system did not apply to used goods like clothes or cars, but they became more expensive since they were not subject to price controls.|$|E

Ohio was admitted into the Union in 1803, {{and the city}} of Dayton was incorporated in 1805. The city was named after Jonathan Dayton, a captain in the American Revolutionary War who signed the U.S. Constitution and owned a significant amount of land in the area.
