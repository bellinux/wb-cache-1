5|$|The breed can {{tolerate}} other pets well, although the King Charles {{still has the}} hunting instincts of its ancestors and may not always <b>be</b> <b>friendly</b> towards smaller animals.

The king, ministers and {{citizens}} should, states the Manasollasa's first sub-book, refrain from injury to others, practice self-restraint and generosity, have faith in gods, feed and support the poor and helpless, and <b>be</b> <b>friendly.</b> The king, according to the text, should honour his ancestors and all guests.|$|E
5|$|I {{saw them}} as the {{ultimate}} all-American band. To me, they reflected the American character in general—an almost childish innocent aggression.... I thought, 'The Great Seal of the President of the United States' would be perfect for the Ramones, with the eagle holding arrows—to symbolize strength and the aggression {{that would be used}} against whomever dares to attack us—and an olive branch, offered to those who want to <b>be</b> <b>friendly.</b> But we decided to change it a little bit. Instead of the olive branch, we had an apple tree branch, since the Ramones were American as apple pie. And since Johnny was such a baseball fanatic, we had the eagle hold a baseball bat instead of the 's arrows.|$|E
5|$|Mrs. Puff is SpongeBob's {{paranoid}} driving {{teacher and}} the owner of the town boating school, which is similar to a driver's education facility. She would like nothing more than to pass SpongeBob, as he is her most dedicated and hard-working student, but he routinely panics when he tries to drive a boat and fails every driving test he takes. His failures often result in crashes that lead to mass destruction and endanger Mrs. Puff. While she tries her best to <b>be</b> <b>friendly</b> and patient with her students, Mrs. Puff finds SpongeBob's unintentional recklessness exasperating. She is the long-standing love interest and girlfriend of Mr. Krabs.|$|E

5|$|Members of {{the breed}} {{are not usually}} ridden until they are four years old, and {{structural}} development is not complete until age seven. Their most productive years are between eight and eighteen, although they retain their strength and stamina into their twenties. An Icelandic mare that lived in Denmark reached a record age of 56, while another horse, living in Great Britain, {{reached the age of}} 42. The horses are highly fertile, and both sexes are fit for breeding up to age 25; mares have been recorded giving birth at age 27. The horses tend to not be easily spooked, probably the result of not having any natural predators in their native Iceland. Icelandics tend to <b>be</b> <b>friendly,</b> docile and easy to handle, although also enthusiastic and self-assured. As a result of their isolation from other horses, disease in the breed within Iceland is mostly unknown, except for some kinds of internal parasites. The low prevalence of disease in Iceland is maintained by laws preventing horses exported from the country being returned, and by requiring that all equine equipment taken into the country be either new and unused or fully disinfected. As a result, native horses have no acquired immunity to disease; an outbreak on the island would be likely to be devastating to the breed. This presents problems with showing native Icelandic horses against others of the breed from outside the country, as no livestock of any species can be imported into Iceland, and once horses leave the country they are not allowed to return.|$|E

25|$|The partisans {{operated}} under constant threat of starvation. In order to survive, Jews {{had to put}} aside traditional dietary restrictions. While friendly peasants provided food, in some cases food was stolen from shops, farms or raided from caches meant for German soldiers. As the war progressed, the Soviet government occasionally airdropped ammunition, counterfeit money and food supplies to partisan groups known to <b>be</b> <b>friendly.</b>|$|E

25|$|As {{with most}} urban districts, Colorado's 1st Congressional District is racially diverse and {{has proven to}} <b>be</b> <b>friendly</b> {{territory}} for Democrats. Only two Republicans have been elected to the district's Congressional seat since the Great Depression. Dean M. Gillespie was the district's representative from 1944 to 1947, and Mike McKevitt served one term from 1970 to 1972, winning thanks to an ideological split among Denver Democrats.|$|E
25|$|In the meantime, Brătianu's {{had been}} {{replaced}} with the crisis government of General Alexandru Averescu, and this was soon followed by Alexandru Marghiloman's (chosen to negotiate the peace, as the German Empire was thought to <b>be</b> <b>friendly</b> towards Marghiloman). Nonetheless, Romania never did ratify the signed treaty, and denounced it in October 1918, immediately re-entering the conflict on the Entente's side. In November, the Compiègne armistice with Germany removed all legal value of the Bucharest Treaty.|$|E
25|$|The rebels {{encountered}} little resistance at {{the start}} of the attack on Saigon, and this allowed them to generate momentum. This was primarily to Diệm and Nhu's complacency and mistaken assumption that the military action was the start of Operation Bravo.

25|$|Although Oswald Garrison Villard's 1910 {{biography}} of Brown {{was thought to}} <b>be</b> <b>friendly</b> (Villard being the grandson of abolitionist Garrison), he also added fuel to the anti-Brown fire by criticizing him as a muddled, pugnacious, bumbling, and homicidal madman. Villard himself was a pacifist and admired Brown in many respects, but his interpretation of the facts provided a paradigm for later anti-Brown writers. By the mid-20th century, some scholars were fairly convinced that John Brown was a fanatic and killer, while some African Americans sustained a positive view of the man.|$|E
25|$|Pooh is very social. After Christopher Robin, {{his closest}} friend is Piglet, and he most often chooses {{to spend his}} time with {{one or both of}} them. But he also habitually visits the other animals, often looking for a snack or an {{audience}} for his poetry as much as for companionship. His kind-heartedness means he goes {{out of his way to}} <b>be</b> <b>friendly</b> to Eeyore, visiting him and bringing him a birthday present and building him a house, despite receiving mostly disdain from Eeyore in return.|$|E
25|$|Diệm {{rejected}} these moderate policies, {{believing that}} a militantly anti-Communist stance was the solution for South Vietnam. This {{coincided with a}} fact finding mission by Democratic Party U.S. Senator Mike Mansfield, a Roman Catholic and strong Diệm supporter, who advocated a suspension of U.S. aid if Diệm were removed. L'Express, the newspaper in Paris which printed his ideas, was considered to <b>be</b> <b>friendly</b> with French Prime Minister Pierre Mendès France. As a result, the US State Department interpreted it as a French manoevre to replace Diệm with Hội. Strongly disapproving of Hội's foreign policies, the State Department warned Mendes-France that U.S. policy would change if Hội became Prime Minister.|$|E
