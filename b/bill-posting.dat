6000|$|Returning to London, he {{had taken}} a {{situation}} in a bank, the chairman of which had been an old friend of his father. The advantage was that while earning a small income he had time to continue his studies; but the deadly monotony of the work had appalled him, and upon the death of his mother he had shaken the cloying dust of the City from his brain and joined a small [...] "fit-up" [...] theatrical company. On the stage he had remained for another eighteen months; had played all roles, from [...] "Romeo" [...] to [...] "Paul Pry," [...] had helped to paint the scenery, had assisted in the <b>bill-posting.</b> The latter, so he told me, he had found {{one of the most difficult}} of accomplishments, the paste-laden poster having an innate tendency to recoil upon the amateur's own head, and to stick there. Wearying of the stage proper, he had joined a circus company, had been [...] "Signor Ricardo, the daring bare-back rider," [...] also one of the [...] "Brothers Roscius in their marvellous trapeze act;" [...] inclining again towards respectability, had been a waiter for three months at Ostend; from that, a footman.|$|E
60|$|For example, {{consider}} what is I suppose {{by far the}} most important vehicle of ideas at the present time, which for a huge majority of adults is the sole vehicle of ideas, the newspaper. It is universal because it is cheap, and it is cheap because the cost of production is paid for by the advertisements of private enterprise. The newspaper is to a very large extent parasitic upon competition; its criticism, its discussion, its correspondence, are, from the business point of view, written on the backs of puffs of competing tobaccos, soaps, medicines and the like. No newspaper could pay upon its sales alone, and the same thing is true of most popular magazines and weekly publications. It is highly probable that whatever checks public advertisement in other directions, the prohibition of <b>bill-posting</b> upon hoardings, for example, the protection of scenery, railway carriages and architecture from the advertiser, stimulates the production of attractive literature. Necessarily what is published in newspapers and magazines must be acceptable to advertising businesses and not too openly contrary to their interests. With that limitation the newspapers provide a singularly free and various arena for discussion at the present time. It must, however, be obvious that to advance towards Socialism is, if not to undermine the newspaper altogether, at least to change very profoundly this material vehicle of popular thought....|$|E
6000|$|You will {{probably}} {{live as a}} tenant in a house which may either stand alone or {{be part of a}} terrace or collegiate building, but instead of having a private landlord, exacting of rent and reluctant of repairs, your house landlord will very probably be, and your ground landlord will certainly be, the municipality, the great Birmingham or London or Hampshire or Glasgow or such-like municipality; and your house will be built solidly and prettily instead of being jerry-built and mean-looking, and it will have bathroom, electric light, electrically equipped kitchen and so forth, as every modern civilized house might have and should have now. If your taste runs to a little close garden of your own, you {{will probably}} find plenty of houses with one; if that is not so, and you want it badly, you will get other people of like tastes to petition the municipality to provide some, and if that will not do, you will put yourself up as a candidate for the parish or municipal council to bring this about. You will pay very much the sort of rent you pay now, but you will not pay it to a private landlord to spend as he likes at Monte Carlo or upon foreign missions or in financing [...] "Moderate" [...] <b>bill-posting</b> or what not, but to the municipality, and you will pay no rates at all. The rent will do under Socialism what the rates do now. You cannot grasp too clearly that Socialism will abolish rates absolutely. Rates for public purposes are necessary to-day because the landowners of the world evade the public obligations that should, in common sense, go with the rent.|$|E
50|$|Upon {{arrival in}} Los Angeles, McLain was a {{machinist}} with Perry and Woodward Company {{for three years}} and then joined the Griffith and Lynch Lumber Company, but he was best known for his ownership of an advertising, or <b>bill-posting</b> business. He was a firefighter in 1889-90 and a deputy sheriff in 1891-93. For a time he was manager of the opera house in Los Angeles, resigning in 1891 when his wife died.|$|E
50|$|Allen was a Foreign Service {{officer from}} 1943—notably {{information}} counsellor at Ankara between 1947 and 1949—until {{he stepped down}} {{and returned to his}} native Ulster in 1949. There he divided his working time between running the family business (David Allen's, a major <b>bill-posting</b> company) and writing the two major books which he completed during the 1950s: Caucasian Battlefields (1953, with Pavel Muratov), and David Allens (1957, an account of the business and a collective biography of the Allen family). His last book, Russian Embassies to the Georgian Kings (1589-1605), written {{with the help of the}} translator Anthony Mango, was published in two volumes by the Hakluyt Society in 1970.|$|E
40|$|Mark K. Deming and Claudine de Vaulchier : The law and its monuments in 1791. Reflecting the Enlightenment's {{intellectual}} preoccupations, {{architecture in}} late 18 th-century France, {{was intended to}} exert a social and moralizing influence, especially through public buildings. Nowhere, perhaps, was such an idea more explicitly illustrated than in the Discours sur les monuments publics delivered by A. G. Kersaint in 1791, which called {{for the construction of}} several Parisien monuments embodying the new political order. Two of these were meant to strengthen the power of the law : the 'prytanée', a structure for <b>bill-posting,</b> originated in response to the conflict about placarding rights; three different types, throughout the city, were to be the main source of instructions for citizens. The second, the national assembly hall, was to provide the People's delegatesDeming Marc K., de Vaulchier Claudine. La loi et ses monuments en 1791. In: Dix-huitième Siècle, n° 14, 1982.

40|$|Between 1876 and 1900, {{large numbers}} of {{manufacturers}} began to advertise more widely {{in an effort to}} create national markets for their products. They commissioned lithographic firms to produce chromolithographed cards, booklets, calendars, and posters, which were then distributed to stores, stuffed into packages, or tacked up on <b>bill-posting</b> boards. The enormous increase in visual advertising in the late nineteenth century, then, must be understood {{in the context of the}} production, distribution, and consumption of chromolithography. While chromolithographic advertising may not have had the cultivating and democratizing influence on American society that reformers believed it could, it did blend in with other cultural forms, thus integrating the discourse of visual advertising into everyday life across class boundaries. Produced under a complex, irrational, and inefficient system by men and women from many walks of life, it was a crucial component in the development of consumer culture. Not only were individual brands developed largely through chromolithography, but also the very idea of the brand was made intelligible during the chromo era. Chromolithographic advertisements drew upon existing cultural forms and visual vernaculars to communicate an ideology of consumption by visually articulating consumption to whiteness and citizenship—and elevating it to a position as the most significant realm of activity. With a large number of firms vying for advertising work, lithographers desperate to compete turned to independent artists with "original ideas" in order to distinguish themselves and thus help them land contracts. As a result, watercolor and pastel artists from a range of social positions, both women and men, were brought into the process of visual-advertising design. The lithographic craftsmen who printed, and also sometimes designed, the advertisements identified as both consumers and workers, while expressing dismay that their trade had become little more than the "humble handmaid" of advertisers...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: Road traffic {{injuries}} are a widespread problem {{and are very}} difficult to prevent. The {{purpose of this study was}} to verify whether intensive versus basic road safety education programs are associated with different incidence and severity of nonfatal road injuries. METHOD: The study had an ecological design and involved Local Health Authority One (LHA 1) in Salerno, Italy, which includes 20 municipalities. Data on nonfatal road injuries occurring in the periods June to August 2003 and June to August 2008 were obtained from trained operators through the information system of the emergency department. All 20 municipalities received a basic community road safety education program (publicity campaign using <b>bill-posting,</b> brochures, mass media communication with press conferences, articles in local papers, radio and television interviews, and a dedicated LHA 1 web site), and 12 municipalities also received an intensive education campaign (in secondary schools, community conferences, and activities organized by police and firefighters). The incidence and severity of nonfatal road traffic injuries were compared between June to August 2003 (before the campaign) and June to August 2008. RESULTS: The total number of injuries in all 20 municipalities in 2003 and 2008 was 907 and 755, respectively. The incidence of injuries decreased in the study period both in the 8 municipalities where only the basic campaign was run (difference in incidence = - 0. 4; P =. 053) and in the 12 municipalities where the intensive campaign was implemented (difference in incidence = - 0. 5; P <. 001); focusing on severity, the incidence of severe injuries decreased or remained the same in the study period in the 2 studied group. DISCUSSION: The results are coherent with other European studies and show that an overall downward trend exists but is presumably not a direct consequence of road safety education. This does not mean that such campaigns are useless (they are important to raise awareness) but that they should be supplemented with complementary activities in order to be really effective...|$|E
