40|$|With the {{continuous}} development of informatization, {{the development of}} agriculture also opens a rapid development model under the <b>background</b> <b>of</b> informatization. Especially, the development of agricultural tourism industry in the growing tourism industry {{is subject to the}} concerns of the majority of agricultural workers. Under the <b>background</b> <b>of</b> informatization, the agricultural tourism encounters a new development opportunity. Compared with the development of the traditional agricultural industry chain, it has a tremendous change in the promotion of the agricultural tourism industry. This paper analyzes the interactive development status of agricultural tourism industry chain under the <b>background</b> <b>of</b> informatization and forecasts its development based on the time series model. This paper first establishes a forecasting model for the interactive development of agricultural tourism industry chain under the <b>background</b> <b>of</b> informatization based on the time series model, and considers the situation of excluding mutants in the specific condition under the <b>background</b> <b>of</b> informationization. The forecasting model obtained can be used to forecast the future interactive development trend of agricultural tourism industry chain under the <b>background</b> <b>of</b> informatization, thus providing a scientific reference for the rapid and healthy development of agricultural tourism industry chain under the <b>background</b> <b>of</b> informatization. Finally, according to the forecasting model and the interactive development status of agricultural tourism industry chain under the <b>background</b> <b>of</b> informatization, this paper proposes the relevant suggestions to provide powerful guidance for the harmonious development and rational allocation of the agricultural tourism industry chain under the <b>background</b> <b>of</b> informatization...|$|R
5|$|Dino Crisis {{utilizes}} {{an original}} 3D engine with real-time environments, {{as opposed to}} the pre-rendered <b>backgrounds</b> <b>of</b> the Resident Evil series. Mikami chose a real-time engine to enable better cinematic action and more dramatic character depictions that would otherwise be impossible. However, with the real-time engine came the challenge of hardware limitations, making it difficult for the team to create detailed environments. The team had to forego a jungle scene because of this issue. Mikami did however believe the team was able to create sufficiently detailed environments despite the hardware's polygon limitations. Like Resident Evil, the game takes place indoors in an enclosed environment. Mikami wanted to keep the claustrophobic feelings, thinking it was better to build fear.|$|E

5|$|The plot of Carnivàle {{takes place}} in the 1930s Dust Bowl and {{revolves}} around the slowly converging storylines of a traveling carnival and a Californian preacher. Out of the 17 actors receiving star billing in the first season, 15 were part of the carnival storyline. The second season amounted to 13 main cast members, supplemented by several actors in recurring roles. Although such large casts make shows more expensive to produce, the writers are benefited with more flexibility in story decisions. The <b>backgrounds</b> <b>of</b> most characters were fully developed before the filming of Carnivàle began but were not part of the show's visible structure. The audience therefore only learned more about the characters as a natural aspect in the story.|$|E

5|$|Diệm {{was killed}} in a November 1963 coup, {{allowing}} Thi to return to South Vietnam and resume his military service. Soon after arriving home, Thi found himself involved in another coup plot, acting as the link between Khánh and Đỗ Mậu, two generals disgruntled with their position under the military junta of Minh, who oversaw the overthrow of Diệm. Mau was one of the principal tacticians in the 1963 coup; although he did not command troops, he had a thorough knowledge of the <b>backgrounds</b> <b>of</b> the ARVN officers and their strengths, weaknesses and characteristics through his role as Diệm's director of military security, and this understanding had allowed him to engineer the previous coup. Minh's junta feared Mau's shrewdness and tried to sideline him by making him the Minister of Information, a relatively unimportant position.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1950s, Manne began to compose his own film scores, {{such as that}} for The Proper Time (1959), with the music also played by his own group, Shelly Manne and His Men, and issued on a Contemporary LP. In later years, Manne divided his time playing the drums on, adding special percussive effects to, and {{sometimes}} writing complete scores for both film and television. He even provided a musical setting for a recording of the Dr. Seuss children's classic Green Eggs and Ham (1960) and later performed in and sometimes wrote music for the <b>backgrounds</b> <b>of</b> numerous animated cartoons. For example, he joined other notable jazz musicians (including Ray Brown and Jimmy Rowles) in playing Doug Goodwin's music for the cartoon series The Ant and the Aardvark (19691971). Notable examples of later scores that Manne wrote himself and also performed in are, for the movies, Young Billy Young (1969) and Trader Horn (1973), and, for television, Daktari, 19661969. With these and other contributions to cartoons, children's stories, movies, television programs (and even commercials), Manne's drumming became woven into the popular culture of several decades.|$|E

5|$|There is epigraphic {{evidence}} from the Hellenistic period and Antigonid dynasty that that the Macedonian kingdom relied on various regional officials to conduct affairs of state. This included a number of high-ranking municipal officials, including the military-rooted strategos and politarch, i.e. the elected governor (archon) of a large city (polis), but also the politico-religious office of the epistates. Although these were highly influential members of local and regional government, Carol J.

At Yorkshire Hirst worked with young players in the cricket nets at Headingley, took charge of indoor trials during the winter, and travelled with the team as coach on a tour to Jamaica in 1936. Many Yorkshire players, with vastly differing temperaments, came under his influence and improved as players.

5|$|About a {{month before}} Minh's junta was overthrown, Khánh was {{approached}} {{by one of the}} principal tacticians in the removal of Diệm, General Đỗ Mậu. A colonel {{at the time of the}} previous coup, Mậu had been head of military security under Diệm. Although he did not explicitly command troops, Mậu had a thorough knowledge of the <b>backgrounds</b> <b>of</b> most of the senior ARVN officers and their strengths and weaknesses. This had allowed him to help engineer the previous coup. The MRC respected Mậu, but their fears about his shrewdness led them to place him in the relatively powerless post of Minister of Information. Mậu's closest aides were posted further away from any real power in an attempt to fragment his networks of influence. Mậu began to search for officers to replace the junta, searching for exiles in Cambodia and France as well as those who had returned to Vietnam after the overthrow of Diệm. The most important link in Mậu's plan was Colonel Nguyễn Chánh Thi, the former paratroop commander who had fled to Cambodia in the wake of the failed 1960 coup attempt against Diệm. Mậu persuaded the junta to install Thi as Khánh's deputy in I Corps. He tricked the junta into doing so by reasoning that as Khánh had largely been responsible for putting down the 1960 revolt, Thi would be an ideal mechanism for keeping Khánh in check, claiming that the two would be implacably opposed to one another. Privately, Mậu predicted that Thi would be a bridge between him in Saigon and Khánh in Huế. He was correct in thinking that the 1960 conflict would be irrelevant in the shifting of allegiances over time and that the pair would work together for their current aims of advancement. Mậu recruited a second figure in the form of General Trần Thiện Khiêm, who was one of Khánh's fellow cadets and had worked with Mậu during the November coup. Khiêm had assisted Diệm in putting down the 1960 plot and had since been demoted from being Chief of Staff of the ARVN to the commander of the III Corps that surrounded Saigon. Khiêm readily joined the plot and controlled the 5th and 7th Divisions of the ARVN, which were based in Biên Hòa and Mỹ Tho north and south of Saigon respectively. This brought the two division commanders subordinate to Khiêm into the plot, as long as they would obey his orders. Khiêm, Khánh and Mậu kept in touch surreptitiously on a regular basis, supplementing their forces with an assortment of Marine, Air Force and Special Forces officers. Another was General Dương Văn Đức, who had recently returned from exile in Paris and was an assistant to Kim, the chief of the junta's general staff. During this time, the plotters received encouragement from Harkins through their American advisers, something seen as crucial to the plot's increasing momentum.|$|E

40|$|The {{research}} goal is {{to study}} probability, period of development and characteristics of a clinical course of chronic prostatitis against the <b>background</b> <b>of</b> androgen deficiency in the aging male. Materials and methods: The Aging Male Symptoms (AMS) rating scale has been applied for androgen deficiency evaluation and the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) — for chronic prostatitis evaluation. 57 men with chronic prostatitis in combination with androgen deficiency in the aging male have been examined. Results: It has been concluded {{that the development of}} chronic prostatitis against the <b>background</b> <b>of</b> androgen deficiency in the aging male occurs in a shorter time period and about 1. 5 times more frequently compared to androgen deficiency in the aging male at the <b>background</b> <b>of</b> chronic prostatitis. The analysis of time periods between the onset of chronic prostatitis symptoms against the <b>background</b> <b>of</b> androgen deficiency in the aging male and androgen deficiency in the aging male symptoms against the <b>background</b> <b>of</b> chronic prostatitis showed that androgen deficiency in the aging male symptoms have been revealed 1 - 2 years earlier than the onset of chronic prostatitis. The development of androgen deficiency in the aging male against the <b>background</b> <b>of</b> chronic prostatitis has showed a backward tendency. Signs of chronic prostatitis have been more frequently occurred in a period of four-five years earlier the androgen deficiency in the aging male development. Conclusion: The risk of development of chronic prostatitis against the <b>background</b> <b>of</b> androgen deficiency in the aging male during the next two years is actually four times higher in comparison with the development of androgen deficiency in the aging male against the <b>background</b> <b>of</b> chronic prostatitis. According to the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), patients with chronic prostatitis in combination with androgen deficiency in the aging male showed higher degree of severity than patients with isolated development of chronic prostatitis...|$|R
