40|$|Key words: Speaking, a Series and Single Picture media 	Speaking {{is one of}} {{important}} skills in learning language especially English. It is much needed for students of English Education in university level because {{in the process of}} teaching and learning the lecturer always asks them to give opinions. Therefore, the learners should master it. To make them easy to express their ideas orally in teaching learning process, the researcher uses <b>a</b> <b>series</b> and single picture as media in speaking teaching learning process. The problem of the study are: (1) how is the student score in speaking taught <b>by</b> using <b>a</b> <b>series</b> picture?, (2) how is student score in speaking taught <b>by</b> using <b>a</b> single picture?, and (3) which media are more effective to improve the students’ ability in speaking. The purposes of this research are: (1) to know the students’ score in speaking taught <b>by</b> using <b>a</b> <b>series</b> picture, (2) to know the students’ score in speaking taught <b>by</b> using <b>a</b> single picture and (3) to know which media are more effective to improve the students’ ability in speaking. 	The design of the research is the comparative study. The samples that the researcher used are 31 students. To get the sample the researcher uses a random sample. To obtain the research data the researcher uses test. Whereas, to find out a significant different score on the students’ speaking when they are taught <b>by</b> using <b>a</b> <b>series</b> picture and when they are taught <b>by</b> using <b>a</b> single picture, the researcher uses t-test formula. The result of data analysis shows that the student’s score taught <b>by</b> using <b>a</b> <b>series</b> picture is bigger than taught <b>by</b> using <b>a</b> single picture. Based on statistical analysis shows that (8, 846 > 2, 042). It means that there is a significant influence between score of teaching <b>by</b> using <b>a</b> <b>series</b> picture and <b>by</b> using <b>a</b> single picture. It can be concluded that the students get good scores in achieving speaking after taught <b>by</b> using <b>a</b> <b>series</b> picture. The students speaking improve significantly so, teaching speaking <b>by</b> using <b>a</b> <b>series</b> picture is effective to improve students’ achievement on speaking. Therefore, it can be used as one of reference media to teach English especially speaking...|$|R
