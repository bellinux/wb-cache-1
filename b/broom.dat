By 1923 just the <b>Broom</b> Pit was working, employing more than 1,000 men and supplying coking, gas and household coal and fireclay to the brickworks. Nearly 900 men were employed there in 1940. At {{the time the}} collieries were nationalised in 1947, the workforce had reduced to 436. Operations at the pit ended in 1968 as the productivity of the colliery declined.|$|E

5|$|The type {{specimen}} of Euchambersia {{was found by}} Robert <b>Broom</b> on the South African farm of Vanwyksfontein, owned by a Mr. Greathead, {{near the town of}} Norvalspont. It consists of a single, distorted skull, catalogued as NHMUK R5696, which was described by <b>Broom</b> in 1931. A second, smaller skull, with the specimen number BP/1/4009, was found in 1966 and described by James Kitching in 1977. Both specimens are missing the lower jaw. They originated from the same general layer of rock, in the upper Cistecephalus Assemblage Zone of the Beaufort Group within the Karoo Supergroup. The Cistecephalus AZ has been dated to the Wuchiapingian stage of the Late Permian, between 256.2 and 255.2 Mya.|$|E

5|$|Currently, Paranthodon is {{classified}} as a stegosaur related to Stegosaurus, Tuojiangosaurus, and Loricatosaurus. Initially, when <b>Broom</b> assigned the name Palaeoscincus africanus to the Paranthodon fossils, he classified them as an ankylosaurian. This classification was later changed by Nopcsa, who found that Paranthodon best resembled a stegosaurid (before the group was truly defined). Coombs (1978) did not follow Nopcsa's classification, keeping Paranthodon as an ankylosaurian, like <b>Broom,</b> although he only classified it as Ankylosauria incertae sedis. A subsequent review by Galton and Coombs in 1981 instead confirmed Nopcsa's interpretation, redescribing Paranthodon as a stegosaurid from the Late Cretaceous. Multiple phylogenetic analyses have placed Paranthodon in Stegosauria, and often in Stegosauridae. A 2010 analysis including nearly all species of stegosaurians found that Paranthodon was outside Stegosauridae, and in a polytomy with Tuojiangosaurus, Huayangosaurus, Chungkingosaurus, Jiangjunosaurus, and Gigantspinosaurus. However, when the latter two genera were removed, Paranthodon grouped with Tuojiangosaurus just outside Stegosauridae, and Huayangosaurus grouped with Chungkingosaurus in Huayangosauridae. Below is the analysis with all included genera.|$|E

5|$|Beside the weapons, each zduhać {{carried a}} milk bucket and a peck measure; an {{alternative}} {{for the latter}} could be a shovel or <b>broom</b> from a threshing floor.

Seizing the milk buckets meant that the milk yield would be transferred.

5|$|Bubbles is {{an action}} game with puzzle {{elements}} where the player controls the protagonist, a soap bubble, from a top-down perspective. The {{object is to}} clean a kitchen sink by maneuvering over ants, crumbs, and grease spots to absorb them before they slide into the drain. As the bubble absorbs more objects, it grows in size, eventually acquiring first eyes and then a smiling mouth. At the same time, sponges and scrub brushes slowly move around the sink, cleaning {{it on their own}} in competition with the player. Touching either of these enemies costs a player one life unless the bubble is large enough to have a complete face. In this case, the enemy will be knocked away and the bubble will shrink. Sponges and brushes can be knocked into the drain for bonus points, eliminating them from play. Two other enemies in the sink are stationary razor blades and roaches that crawl out of the drain. Contact with a blade is always fatal, while the bubble can safely touch the roach only while carrying a <b>broom,</b> which will kill the roach with one hit. The <b>broom</b> can be acquired by running over a cleaning lady who appears in the sink from time to time.|$|E
