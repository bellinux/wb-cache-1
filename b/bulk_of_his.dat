5|$|Corbulo {{was given}} control over two provinces, Cappadocia and Galatia (modern-day central Turkey), with propraetorial and later proconsular {{authority}} or imperium. Although Galatia {{was considered a}} good recruiting-ground and Cappadocia had a few units of auxiliaries, the <b>bulk</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> army came from Syria, where half the garrison of four legions and several units of auxiliaries was transferred to his command.|$|E
5|$|According to Filitti, the war {{spelled out}} {{the end of}} Romania's aristocratic order, leaving the country prey to the nouveaux riches and the neo-Jacobins. As the Conservative Party itself {{collapsed}} into obscurity, he remained largely {{cut off from the}} outside world, and rejected many of the recent innovations. Reportedly, he wrote all his books and articles in dip pen, and never watched a motion picture. After 1919, he had to recover from financial ruin, having entrusted the <b>bulk</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> assets (what had not been lost in the war) to a broker, who gambled it away and then committed suicide.|$|E
5|$|Although Fannin, Dimmitt, and Linn {{continued}} {{to push for}} an attack on Goliad, Texian attention soon shifted towards Gonzales, where {{a small group of}} Texians were refusing to obey orders from Ugartechea. Colonists eagerly rushed to assist, and on October 2 the Battle of Gonzales officially opened the Texas Revolution. After learning of the Texian victory, Cos made haste for Béxar. He left with the <b>bulk</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> soldiers on October 5, but because he was unable to find adequate transportation most of his supplies remained at La Bahía.|$|E
60|$|Bill {{carefully}} {{removed all}} marks <b>of</b> <b>his</b> struggle {{and walked into}} dinner shamefacedly, all muscle gone out <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>bulk</b> <b>of</b> fat. <b>His</b> sudden return to primeval savagery grew monstrous in the cheerful kitchen, with its noise of hearty children, sizzling meat, and the clatter of dishes.|$|R
60|$|A gasp of relief, {{followed}} by an angry cry from Valentina, went up when they recognised those that came. First stepped the Count of Aquila in full armour, sword at side and dagger on hip, carrying his head-piece on the crook <b>of</b> <b>his</b> left arm. Behind him towered the <b>bulk</b> <b>of</b> Fortemani, <b>his</b> great face flushed with a strange excitement, a leather hacketon over his steel cuirass, girt, too, with sword and dagger, and carrying his shining morion in his hand. Last came Lanciotto and Zaccaria, both fully equipped and armed at all points.|$|R
60|$|It was Francesco, who, single-handed, {{and armed}} {{with no more}} than a whip, was {{scattering}} them from about his maltreated servant, as the hawk scatters a flight of noisy sparrows. And now between him and Lanciotto there stood no more than the broad <b>bulk</b> <b>of</b> Ercole Fortemani, <b>his</b> back to the Count; for, as yet, he had not realised the interruption.|$|R
5|$|As allied {{intentions}} became clear, General Pigot {{decided to}} redeploy his {{forces in a}} defensive posture, withdrawing troops from Conanicut Island and from Butts Hill. He also decided to move nearly all livestock into the city, ordered the levelling of orchards to provide a clear line of fire, and destroyed carriages and wagons. The arriving French ships drove several of his supporting ships aground, which were then burned to prevent their capture. As the French worked {{their way up the}} channel toward Newport, Pigot ordered the remaining ships scuttled to hamper French access to Newport's harbour. On 8 August d'Estaing moved the <b>bulk</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> fleet into Newport Harbour.|$|E
5|$|Brock felt {{he needed}} to go further. He was {{hampered}} by Governor General George Prevost, who had replaced Craig in late 1811. Prevost's orders from the government, and his own inclinations, were to emphasise defence. Prevost kept the <b>bulk</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> forces in Lower Canada to protect Quebec, and opposed any attack into United States. Brock also believed that he was handicapped by inertia and defeatism among the Legislature and other officials.|$|E
5|$|From Babylon, Alexander went to Susa, {{one of the}} Achaemenid capitals, and {{captured}} its treasury. He sent the <b>bulk</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> army to the Persian ceremonial capital of Persepolis via the Persian Royal Road. Alexander himself took selected troops on the direct route to the city. He then stormed the pass of the Persian Gates (in the modern Zagros Mountains) which had been blocked by a Persian army under Ariobarzanes and then hurried to Persepolis before its garrison could loot the treasury.|$|E
60|$|The sleeper stirred {{slightly}} and awoke. At the same moment, by some mysterious sympathy, {{a pair of}} beady bright eyes appeared in the <b>bulk</b> <b>of</b> fur near <b>his</b> curls, the cat stretched herself, and even a vague agitation was heard in the bottles on the shelf. Richelieu's blinking eyes wandered from the candle to his sister, and then the guilty hand was suddenly withdrawn under the bedclothes.|$|R
50|$|Of the {{writings}} {{that can be}} verifiably attributed to Fulbert, the <b>bulk</b> consists <b>of</b> <b>his</b> letters. His most famous letter was to Duke William V of Aquitaine on the duties of feudal lord and vassal. He also wrote to fellow churchmen {{on a variety of}} liturgical issues including the appointment of bishops, excommunication, and obedience. His letters also include correspondence about mundane issues of everyday life such as thanking people for medicine and setting up meetings. These letters provide insight into a variety of issues in the late tenth and early eleventh century France.|$|R
50|$|Travelling on his {{missions}} {{all across}} Russia provided Turbin with a <b>bulk</b> <b>of</b> material for <b>his</b> subsequent literary career. Highly acclaimed were <b>his</b> Notes <b>of</b> an Old Artillery Man published in 1857 by Sovremennik, {{as well as}} the accounts <b>of</b> <b>his</b> travels over Siberia (Saint Petersburgs's Vedomosti, 1863-1865). A series of historical studies by Turbin were published by Russkaya Starina in 1871-1873. Popular in the late 19th century were the theatre productions of Turbin's plays: Two Mothers-in-Law (Свекровь и теща, 1864), A Sprightly Lady (Бойкая барыня, 1864), A Pansioner at the Station (Пансионерка на станции, 1871), The Image of Nature (Картинка с натуры, 1864), A Hostess and a Guest (Хозяйка и постоялец, 1871), A Tamer Woman (Укротительница, 1871).|$|R
5|$|Kublai {{continued}} the assault against the Song, gaining a temporary foothold {{on the southern}} banks of the Yangtze. Kublai made preparations to take Ezhou, but a pending civil war with his brother Ariq Böke—a rival claimant to the Mongol Khaganate—forced Kublai to move back north with the <b>bulk</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> forces. In Kublai's absence, the Song forces were ordered by Chancellor Jia Sidao to make an immediate assault and succeeded in pushing the Mongol forces back to the northern banks of the Yangtze. There were minor border skirmishes until 1265, when Kublai won a significant battle in Sichuan.|$|E
5|$|The 182nd Paratrooper Brigade, {{comprising}} the 81st, 85th and 89th Battalions (each composed of three companies) {{under the command}} of Colonel Ismail Azmy, was assigned responsibility for defending the area south of Ismailia against an Israeli offensive. Azmy arrived at Nafisha with the <b>bulk</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> brigade at midnight on October 17, where he was briefed by Brigadier General Abd el-Munim Khalil, commander of Second Army. Khalil identified the west bank strong points as objectives for the paratroopers to secure, as the ramparts could be used to provide fire support to Egyptian forces on the east bank. The paratroopers would also hold Serabaeum and the bridges there over the Sweetwater Canal.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of the Standard, as the {{encounter}} {{came to be}} called, was a defeat for the Scots. Afterwards, David and his surviving notables retired to Carlisle. Although {{the result was a}} defeat, it was not by any means decisive. David retained the <b>bulk</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> army and thus the power to go on the offensive again. The siege of Wark, for instance, which had been going on since January, continued until it was captured in November. David continued to occupy Cumberland as well as much of Northumberland.|$|E
60|$|They {{came into}} view around the outjutting clump of trees. To the fore was the third man whose name he had not learnt. Then came eight dogs drawing the sled. At {{the front of the}} sled, guiding it by the gee-pole, walked John Thompson. The rear was brought up by Oleson, the Swede. He was {{certainly}} a fine man, Morganson thought, as he looked at the <b>bulk</b> <b>of</b> him in <b>his</b> squirrel-skin parka. The men and dogs were silhouetted sharply against the white of the landscape. They had the seeming of two dimension, cardboard figures that worked mechanically.|$|R
50|$|On July 30, 2013, Konz {{was signed}} to the 90 man roster by the Seattle Seahawks, and was {{switched}} back to offense at tight end during training camp and preseason games. After spending time {{working out in}} Southern California during the offseason, Konz showed up to camp having added 20 pounds <b>of</b> <b>bulk</b> from <b>his</b> original 234 pounds when he was drafted in 2010.|$|R
50|$|In 1988 Wright {{became the}} target of an inquiry by the House Ethics Committee. Their report in early 1989 implied that he had used <b>bulk</b> {{purchases}} <b>of</b> <b>his</b> book, Reflections <b>of</b> a Public Man, to earn speaking fees {{in excess of the}} allowed maximum, and that his wife, Betty, was given a job and perks to avoid the limit on gifts. Faced with an increasing loss of effectiveness, Wright tendered his resignation as Speaker on May 31, 1989, the resignation to become effective on the selection of a successor. He was the first Speaker to resign because of a scandal. On June 6, the Democratic Caucus brought Wright's speakership to an end by selecting his replacement, Tom Foley of Washington, and on June 30 Wright resigned his seat in Congress.|$|R
5|$|The French {{started their}} rule by {{sentencing}} 21 nationalist leaders, including Quwatli, {{to death on}} 1 August 1920. Quwatli managed to flee only hours before a warrant for his arrest was issued. From Damascus he fled by car to Haifa in British-mandated Palestine, and soon after to Cairo in Egypt. From there, Quwatli spent the <b>bulk</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> time traveling throughout the Arab world and Europe serving as the virtual ambassador of the Syrian-Palestinian Congress. He became the chief link between Arab nationalist activists in Europe and in the Arab world.|$|E
5|$|The King lent {{support to}} Fisher, {{in part because}} he disliked Beresford, and {{eventually}} Beresford was dismissed. Beresford continued his campaign outside of the navy and Fisher ultimately announced his resignation in late 1909, although the <b>bulk</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> policies were retained. The King was intimately involved in the appointment of Fisher's successor as the Fisher-Beresford feud had split the service, and the only truly qualified figure known to be outside of both camps was Sir Arthur Knyvet Wilson, who had retired in 1907. Wilson was reluctant to return to active duty, but Edward persuaded him to do so, and Wilson became First Sea Lord on 25 January 1910.|$|E
5|$|The {{commissioning}} of Cossa's tomb monument {{was negotiated}} {{for about a}} decade following Cossa's death. Cossa's last will and testament—written on his death bed on December 22, 1419—made several of the customary Florentine civic bequests, acts of charity, and traditional ecclesiastical courtesies, but the <b>bulk</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> estate was left to his nephews Michele and Giovanni. The bequests to his nephews took priority, and his estate remained disputed by various creditors while the tomb was being completed.|$|E
5000|$|History of the Kinetograph, Kinetoscope, and Kinetophonograph is a {{collection}} of essays on the history of film, written by the motion picture pioneer William Kennedy Dickson and his sister Antonia Dickson. The brother Dickson had lived in England before moving to the United States in 1879. In 1883, at age 23, Dickson earned the employment of Thomas Edison at his Machine Works company in New York City. In 1888, Edison commissioned Dickson for the development of what would become the kinetoscope, an early means of playing back motion picture film. Dickson moved later to Edison's [...] "Black Maria" [...] film production studio in West Orange, New Jersey; the <b>bulk</b> <b>of</b> History recounts <b>his</b> experiences working at this studio.|$|R
5000|$|In 1883, Basil became organist of St. Barnabas Church, Pimlico {{completing}} his Sonata in C# Minor here in 1885, selling the copyright to the publisher Schott for one shilling {{a year or}} two later. After this success, he moved to Ely Cathedral in 1887 where he wrote the <b>bulk</b> <b>of</b> Dithyramb, possibly <b>his</b> greatest organ work. His final appointment was as organist at Christ Church, Oxford and as precentor of Keble College, Oxford from 1892 to 1909. Whilst there he co-founded and conducted the Oxford Bach Choir which helped to earn him his degree as Doctor of Music. He conducted the Oxford Orchestral Association (1892-1898). He was musical editor of the 1908 Oxford Hymn Book and Examiner for Musical Degrees (1900-1925) ...|$|R
50|$|The <b>bulk</b> <b>of</b> Gouinlock's {{career was}} in Toronto (1888-1927) where most <b>of</b> <b>his</b> work is found.|$|R
5|$|The {{foggy weather}} made it {{difficult}} to see positions from either side, but Frederick and his commanders used the fog to their advantage. Leaving a cavalry unit and a cluster of infantry in front of the northernmost end of the Austrian line (the Austrian right), Frederick deployed the remainder (and <b>bulk)</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> forces toward Leuthen itself; Charles saw them start their redeployment, and may have interpreted the maneuver as withdrawal, at least for a while.|$|E
5|$|While {{still in}} Madras, Ramanujan {{recorded}} the <b>bulk</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> results in four notebooks of loose-leaf paper. They were mostly written up without any derivations. This {{is probably the}} origin of the misapprehension that Ramanujan was unable to prove his results and simply thought up the final result directly. Mathematician Bruce C. Berndt, in his review of these notebooks and Ramanujan's work, says that Ramanujan most certainly was able to prove most of his results, but chose not to.|$|E
5|$|After {{defeating}} the British in the Siege of Boston on March 17, 1776, commander-in-chief General George Washington brought the Continental Army {{to defend the}} port city of New York, then limited to the southern end of Manhattan Island. Washington understood that the city's harbor would provide an excellent base for the British Navy during the campaign, so he established defenses there and waited for the British to attack. In July, the British under the command of General William Howe landed a few miles across the harbor from Manhattan on the sparsely-populated Staten Island, where they were slowly reinforced by ships in Lower New York Bay during the next month and a half, bringing their total force to 32,000 troops. Washington knew the difficulty in holding the city with the British fleet in control of the entrance to the harbor at the Narrows, and he moved the <b>bulk</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> forces to Manhattan, believing that {{it would be the first}} target.|$|E
2500|$|Crosby's {{was among}} the most popular and {{successful}} musical acts of the 20th century. Although Billboard magazine operated under different methodologies for the <b>bulk</b> <b>of</b> Crosby's career, <b>his</b> chart numbers remain astonishing: 396 chart singles, including 41 No.1 hits. If the multiple times [...] "White Christmas" [...] charted are counted, that would bring that number up to 43 – more than The Beatles and Elvis combined. Crosby had separate charting singles in every calendar year between 1931 and 1954; the annual re-release of [...] "White Christmas" [...] extended that streak to 1957. He had 24 separate popular singles in 1939 alone. It is widely believed that Crosby is the best selling recording artist ever, with plus or minus 1 billion units sold. Statistician Joel Whitburn at Billboard determined that Crosby was America's most successful recording act of the 1930s and again in the 1940s.|$|R
60|$|Syme, at {{a crisis}} <b>of</b> <b>his</b> morbid fears for humanity, seemed stung by the mere stolidity of the {{automatic}} official, a mere <b>bulk</b> <b>of</b> {{blue in the}} twilight.|$|R
50|$|The <b>bulk</b> <b>of</b> Page's {{career was}} spent as a {{magazine}} photographer, and, as a result, few <b>of</b> <b>his</b> photographs were {{in private hands}} and his work was largely forgotten by the time <b>of</b> <b>his</b> death in 1985, {{at the age of}} 67.|$|R
5|$|Although {{the first}} day's {{progress}} was slower than expected, Operation Tractable resumed on 15 August; both armoured divisions pushed southeast toward Falaise. The Canadian 2nd and 3rd Infantry Divisions—with {{the support of}} the Canadian 2nd Armoured Brigade—continued their drive south towards the town. After harsh fighting, the 4th Armoured Division captured Soulangy but the gains made were minimal as strong German resistance prevented a breakthrough to Trun. On 16 August, the Canadian 2nd Infantry Division broke into Falaise, encountering minor opposition from Waffen-SS units and scattered pockets of German infantry. Although it would take two more days to clear all resistance in the town, the first major objective of Operation Tractable had been achieved. Simonds began to reorganize the <b>bulk</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> armoured forces for a renewed push towards Trun to close the Falaise Pocket.|$|E
5|$|Harold {{had spent}} mid-1066 {{on the south}} coast with a large army and fleet waiting for William to invade. The <b>bulk</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> forces were militia who needed to harvest their crops, so on 8 September Harold {{dismissed}} the militia and the fleet. Learning of the Norwegian invasion he rushed north, gathering forces as he went, and took the Norwegians by surprise, defeating them at the Battle of Stamford Bridge on 25 September. Harald Hardrada and Tostig were killed, and the Norwegians suffered such great losses that only 24 of the original 300 ships were required to carry away the survivors. The English victory came at great cost, as Harold's army was left in a battered and weakened state.|$|E
5|$|In 1344, the regency {{concluded}} a further alliance with Bulgaria, which required {{the surrender of}} Philippopolis (Plovdiv) and nine other towns in northern Thrace along the river Evros. Nevertheless, after their occupation, Ivan Alexander refrained from direct action against Kantakouzenos' forces operating in southern and eastern Thrace. At the same time, Momchil, a former brigand whom Kantakouzenos had entrusted with control over the region of Merope in the Rhodope mountains, switched over to the regency. In early 1344, Kantakouzenos was deprived of Umur and the <b>bulk</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> army, who had sailed home to repel a Latin attack on his main harbour, Smyrna. On their way, the Turkish force was attacked by the Serbs under Gregory Preljub, but prevailed at the Battle of Stephaniana. Nevertheless, Kantakouzenos was able to ward off joint attacks by Dušan and Apokaukos until Umur returned to his aid the next spring {{at the head of}} an army of 20,000men.|$|E

25|$|Protracted court {{battles over}} the {{disposition}} <b>of</b> <b>his</b> estate lasted {{well into the}} 1980s. Eventually, Arthur Marx was awarded the <b>bulk</b> <b>of</b> the estate's assets, and Erin Fleming was ordered to repay $472,000.|$|R
50|$|This oration, Against Timarchus, is {{considered}} important because <b>of</b> the <b>bulk</b> <b>of</b> Athenian laws it cites. As a consequence <b>of</b> <b>his</b> successful attack on Timarchus, Aeschines was cleared {{of the charge}} of treason.|$|R
