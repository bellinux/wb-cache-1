5|$|On March 9, 2006, a {{revision}} of the USA PATRIOT Act was signed into law. It amended the process for interim appointments of U.S. Attorneys, a clause Specter wrote during his chairmanship of the Senate Judiciary Committee. The change allowed the <b>Bush</b> <b>Administration</b> <b>to</b> appoint interim U.S. attorneys without term limits, and without confirmation by the Senate. The Bush administration used the law to place at least eight interim attorneys into office in 2006. Specter claimed that the changes were added by staff member Brett Tolman. For more information, see dismissal of U.S. Attorneys controversy.|$|E
5|$|Cheney {{publicly}} {{expressed concern}} that nations such as Iraq, Iran, and North Korea, could acquire nuclear components {{after the collapse of}} the Soviet Union in 1991. The end of the Cold War, the fall of the Soviet Union, and the disintegration of the Warsaw Pact obliged the first <b>Bush</b> <b>Administration</b> <b>to</b> reevaluate the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's (NATO's) purpose and makeup. Cheney believed that NATO should remain the foundation of European security relationships and that it would remain important to the United States in the long term; he urged the alliance to lend more assistance to the new democracies in Eastern Europe.|$|E
5|$|Ryan {{voted to}} extend {{unemployment}} insurance in 2002, 2008, and 2009, but has since voted against further extensions. In 2004 and 2005, Ryan pushed the <b>Bush</b> <b>administration</b> <b>to</b> propose {{the privatization of}} Social Security. His proposal ultimately failed when it did not gain {{the support of the}} then-Republican presidential administration. In 2005, Ryan and Senator John Sununu of New Hampshire introduced the Social Security Personal Savings Guarantee and Prosperity Act, also known as the Ryan-Sununu plan. The plan would have allowed employees to direct a portion of their Federal Insurance Contributions Act payroll tax on their wages to a private account which invested in a stock portfolio managed by the Social Security Administration. Versions of the plan were included in Ryan's later budget proposals.|$|E

5|$|In 1978 Robert Randall {{sued the}} federal {{government}} for arresting him for using cannabis to treat his glaucoma. The judge ruled Randall needed cannabis for medical purposes and required the Food and Drug Administration set up a program to grow cannabis on a farm at the University of Mississippi and to distribute 300 cannabis cigarettes a month to Randall. In 1992 George H. W. Bush discontinued the program after Randall tried to make HIV/AIDS patients eligible for the program. Thirteen people were already enrolled and were allowed to continue receiving cannabis cigarettes; today the government still ships cannabis cigarettes to four people. Irvin Rosenfeld, who became eligible to receive cannabis from the program in 1982 to treat rare bone tumors, urged the George W. <b>Bush</b> <b>administration</b> <b>to</b> reopen the program; however, he was unsuccessful.|$|E

25|$|In July 2006, Van Hollen {{urged the}} <b>Bush</b> <b>administration</b> <b>to</b> support a ceasefire {{supported}} by a peacekeeping force that would end the 2006 Lebanon War.

25|$|In 2006, Schumer led a {{bipartisan}} effort, {{with the help}} of Republicans like Congressman Peter T. King (NY), to stop a deal approved by the <b>Bush</b> <b>administration</b> <b>to</b> transfer control of six United States ports to a corporation owned by the government of United Arab Emirates (UAE), Dubai Ports World (see Dubai Ports World controversy). The 9/11 Commission reported that, despite recent alliances with the U.S., the UAE had strong ties to Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda prior to the 9/11 attacks. The measure in the House was H.R 4807, and in the Senate, S. 2333; these were introduced to require a 45-day review of this transfer of ownership. On March 9, 2006, Dubai Ports World withdrew its application to operate the ports.|$|E

He said, [...] "I have way too many friends who have just too few T-cells in their blood to be able to survive four more years of George Bush. This is the politics of survival." ...|$|R

25|$|Following {{the period}} of combat in March–April 2003, both protests and armed combat {{experienced}} a temporary decline in intensity. Protests against the war as a whole continued, often {{on the occasion of}} anniversaries of the war and visits by members of the <b>Bush</b> <b>administration</b> <b>to</b> foreign cities. Within the United States, general anti-war protests were joined by protests focusing on particular issues or strategies including: opposition to torture and abuse (such as that in the Abu Ghraib prison), calls for withdrawal of members of the coalition from Iraq, counter-recruitment, support for military resisters such as Lt. Ehren Watada, and opposition to military and corporate contractors. The largest protests during this period have been national, multi-issue mobilizations such as those on August 30, 2004, and April 29, 2006. Black bloc elements were present during some of the protests.|$|E
500|$|Hamdan v. Rumsfeld, , {{is a case}} {{in which}} the Supreme Court of the United States held that {{military}} commissions set up by the <b>Bush</b> <b>administration</b> <b>to</b> try detainees at Guantanamo Bay lack [...] "the power to proceed because its structures and procedures violate both the Uniform Code of Military Justice and the four Geneva Conventions signed in 1949." [...] Specifically, the ruling says that Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions was violated.|$|E
500|$|Corzine {{tried and}} failed to {{introduce}} legislation for chemical plant regulation six weeks after the September 11, 2001 attacks. Subsequent efforts by then-Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency and former New Jersey Governor Christine Todd Whitman in 2002 were also squelched. [...] Along with Hillary Clinton, {{he was one of the}} few senators who attempted to pressure the <b>Bush</b> <b>administration</b> <b>to</b> clamp down on regulation of the chemical and nuclear-power industries. His efforts helped make New Jersey one of the stricter states in the nation in terms of chemical plant regulation.|$|E

40|$|Early in its tenure, the George W. <b>Bush</b> <b>Administration</b> seemed <b>to</b> {{abandon the}} long-standing U. S. policy of "strategic ambiguity" on Taiwan {{in favor of}} "strategic clarity" that placed more {{emphasis}} on Taiwan's interests and less on PRC (People's Republic of China) concerns. Among other things, President Bush publicly stated in 2001 that the United States would do "whatever it take" to help Taiwan's defense. Since then, U. S. -Taiwan relations have undergone important changes, sparked {{in part by the}} increasing complexity and unpredictability of Taiwan's democratic political environment.

500|$|The release {{coincided with}} {{widespread}} skepticism among the German {{public about the}} honesty and motivation of the George W. <b>Bush</b> <b>administration,</b> <b>to</b> the extent that a Forsa survey published in Die Zeit in July 2003 found that nineteen percent of Germans (rising to thirty one percent among under 30s) believed that elements within the United States government were behind the 9/11 attacks. This provided fertile ground for The CIA and September 11, which sold strongly: von Bülow eclipsed the sales of writers who clung to a [...] "conventional" [...] interpretation of the 9/11 attacks, such as the intelligence expert Oliver Schrom.|$|E

Vince Reinhardt, a former Federal Reserve economist now at the American Enterprise Institute, said [...] "it would have helped for the <b>Bush</b> <b>administration</b> <b>to</b> empower the folks at Treasury and the Federal Reserve and the comptroller of the currency and the FDIC to look at these issues more closely", and additionally, that it would have helped [...] "for Congress to have held hearings".|$|E
