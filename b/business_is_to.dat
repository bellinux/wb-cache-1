Administrative controls form {{the framework for}} running the business and managing people.

I am talking about the accumulated evidence of the last 5 years that our present tax system, developed as it was, in good part, during World War II to restrain growth, exerts too heavy a drag on growth in peace time; that it siphons out of the private economy too large a share of personal and business purchasing power; that it reduces the financial incentives for personal effort, investment, and risk-taking." ...|$|E

Erik Simanis has reported that the model has a fatal flaw.

Because the high costs of doing business among the very poor demand a high contribution per transaction, companies must embrace the reality that high margins and price points aren't just a top-of-the-pyramid phenomenon; they're also a necessity for ensuring sustainable businesses {{at the bottom of the}} pyramid." [...] Marc Gunther states that [...] "The bottom-of-the-pyramid (BOP) market leader, arguably, is Unilever ... Its signature BOP product is Pureit, a countertop water-purification system sold in India, Africa and Latin America. It's saving lives, but it's not making money for shareholders." [...] This [...] leaves the ideal of eradicating poverty through profits or with a good business sense – not a sense of do-gooding rather questionable.|$|E
