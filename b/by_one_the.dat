5|$|All of the {{children}} attended the nearby George Street State School and one <b>by</b> <b>one</b> <b>the</b> brothers joined the Fitzroy Cricket Club as they reached their early teens. The club had a program whereby they gave a medal for every local school to award to the best cricketer in their ranks in that year. The successful student would then be given access {{to all of the}} club's facilities. All of the Harvey brothers were recipients were of this medal. At Fitzroy, they came under the influence of former Victorian all-rounder Arthur Liddicut and the club's veteran captain Joe Plant. The Harveys had no formal coaching, and their father, although a regular presence at the club, chose to stay in the background as their respective careers developed. Horace did not advise his sons on how to bat, allowing them to formulate their own style and technique. According to the Harvey brothers, it was their mother who was vocal and extroverted, in contrast to their reserved father. The boys who failed to score runs were given kitchen duty and according to them, their parents never showed favouritism.|$|E
5|$|At 05:00 {{the leading}} British ship, HMS Monarch, was within range {{and opened fire}} on the French squadron, which divided. One frigate went north and was intercepted by HMS Mars, while another, {{accompanied}} by the two corvettes, turned south and managed to outrun HMS Windsor Castle. The {{main body of the}} French force remained together and met the attack of Monarch and the British flagship HMS Centaur with their broadsides. Although outnumbered and outclassed by the British squadron the French ships fought hard, inflicting damage on the leading British ships and severely wounding Commodore Hood. Eventually the strength of the British squadron told, and despite a fierce resistance the French ships surrendered one <b>by</b> <b>one,</b> <b>the</b> British capturing four of the seven vessels in the squadron.|$|E

5|$|In autumn 1080, Melissenos left Kos and {{returned}} to Asia Minor. There, he succeeded in gaining {{the support of the}} local population, and in recruiting many Turkish tribesmen as mercenaries to his army. One <b>by</b> <b>one,</b> <b>the</b> cities of western and central Asia Minor opened up their gates to him, and Turkish garrisons were installed in them. Botaneiates tried to send Alexios Komnenos, who had recently suppressed the revolts of Nikephoros Bryennios and Nikephoros Basilakes, against him, but he refused. In February 1081, Melissenos's troops took Nicaea, where he was acclaimed as emperor, and defeated a loyalist army under the eunuch John.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, Christian Selmer was impeached on 27 February; {{his cabinet}} members {{followed}} one <b>by</b> <b>one,</b> <b>the</b> last being impeached on 1 April. On 11 March, Selmer resigned. Two acting Prime Ministers {{were drawn from}} his cabinet; Ole Bachke from 11 to 29 March and Niels Mathias Rye from 29 March to 3 April. Then, a new cabinet led by Selmer's former Minister of Finance Christian Homann Schweigaard was formed, but in reality it stood no chance of surviving as it faced the Liberal-dominated Parliament, whose means of pressuring the executive branch had been strengthened following the Impeachment trial. In June, as Schweigaard entered his last month as Prime Minister, the King summoned mathematics professor Ole Jacob Broch to form a compromise cabinet, but this failed owing to Conservative opposition, spearheaded by up-and-coming politician Emil Stang. Broch gave up on 22 June, and Johan Sverdrup became Prime Minister on 26 June. In light of this change in circumstances, the case against Hol had been annulled by Royal Resolution earlier on 6 June.|$|E
5|$|Increasing exports {{during the}} First World War {{led to a}} boom in {{industry}} and declining living standards in the industrial areas, particularly Catalonia and the Basque country. There was high inflation. The industrial sector resented its subjugation by the agrarian central government. Along with concerns about antiquated promotion systems and political corruption, the war in Morocco had caused divisions in the military. Regenerationism became popular, and the working class, industrial class, and the military were united in their hope of removing the corrupt central government. However, these hopes were defeated in 1917 and 1918 when the various political parties representing these groups were either appeased or suppressed by the central government, one <b>by</b> <b>one.</b> <b>The</b> industrialists eventually backed the government {{as a way to}} restore order. After the formation of the Communist International in 1919, there was a growing fear of communism within Spain and growing repression {{on the part of the}} government through military means. The PSOE split, with the more left-wing members founding the Communist Party in 1921. The Restoration government failed to cope with an increasing number of strikes amongst the industrial workers in the north and the agricultural workers in the south.|$|E

5|$|The episode {{begins with}} an unknown person {{lighting}} a candle in the homicide squadroom. One <b>by</b> <b>one,</b> <b>the</b> detectives arrive for the night shift on an unusually hot September evening. A furious Gee (Yaphet Kotto) calls maintenance {{to complain about the}} non-working air conditioner and learns it has been shut off for the night. Felton (Daniel Baldwin) and Lewis (Clark Johnson) try to find out who secretly lights the candle every night; they blow it out a number of times, but it always ends up lit again without anyone noticing. Munch (Richard Belzer) loudly complains about his ex-girlfriend breaking up with him. While the other detectives sweat and complain about the heat, a calm and comfortable Pembleton (Andre Braugher) wears a tie and drinks hot tea without sweating. Bayliss (Kyle Secor), who acts uncooperative with his partner Pembleton, says he has found the fingerprints of a man named James Hill who he believes is the murderer in the Adena Watson case. Officer Thormann (Lee Tergesen) brings in Hill, who {{turns out to be a}} 12-year-old boy (Kenny Blank), much to the amusement of the other detectives.|$|E
5|$|The two {{roots of}} any {{quadratic}} equation {{may be of}} three possible types: two different real numbers, two identical real numbers (i.e., a degenerate double root), or a pair of complex conjugate roots. The first case corresponds to the usual situation; each pair of roots corresponds {{to a pair of}} solutions that are related by circle inversion, as described below (Figure6). In the second case, both roots are identical, corresponding to a solution circle that transforms into itself under inversion. In this case, one of the given circles is itself a solution to the Apollonius problem, and the number of distinct solutions is reduced <b>by</b> <b>one.</b> <b>The</b> third case of complex conjugate radii does not correspond to a geometrically possible solution for Apollonius' problem, since a solution circle cannot have an imaginary radius; therefore, the number of solutions is reduced by two. Interestingly, Apollonius' problem cannot have seven solutions, although it may have any other number of solutions from zero to eight.|$|E
5|$|As the laneway {{meant that}} the playing area was long and narrow, the young boys also {{had to learn to}} play the ball {{straight}} in accordance with orthodox cricket technique. The Harveys played another form of cricket in their concreted backyard (using a marble instead of a ball) that sharpened their reflexes, and a miniature bat. All were right-handed batsmen with the exception of Neil. All the siblings attended the nearby George Street State School and, one <b>by</b> <b>one,</b> <b>the</b> brothers joined the Fitzroy Cricket Club as they reached their early teens. The club had a program whereby they gave a medal to local schools to award to their best cricketer in their ranks, who would then be given access to all of the club's facilities.

5|$|In June 1341, Andronikos III died suddenly, and a power {{struggle}} developed between Kantakouzenos, who initially assumed the powers of regency over Andronikos's underage son John V Palaiologos, and a powerful faction around the Patriarch John XIV Kalekas, the Empress-dowager Anna of Savoy and Alexios Apokaukos on the other. The dispute soon developed in outright conflict when the Patriarch, the Empress, and Apokaukos replaced Kantakouzenos as regent and imprisoned his family and supporters. In response, Kantakouzenos proclaimed himself emperor at Didymoteichon in October. The news of Kantakouzenos's proclamation sparked a wave of popular resistance across Macedonia and Thrace. The common people, impoverished by an exploitative and over-powerful aristocracy, viewed Kantakouzenos {{as a representative of}} the hated aristocrats and rallied behind the legitimate Palaiologos line and one <b>by</b> <b>one,</b> <b>the</b> cities were seized in the name of the Constantinopolitan regency. Thessalonica at first remained tranquil, and Synadenos contacted his old friend Kantakouzenos with the intention of surrendering the city to him. Such a move might well prove decisive, as possession of Thessalonica would enable Kantakouzenos to control Macedonia, Thessaly and Epirus, and in March 1342, he set out from Didymoteichon with his army in the direction of the city. Before he arrived there, however, Synadenos was overthrown and driven from the city by a rebellion led by a radical popular faction, the Zealots. Apokaukos with a fleet came to reinforce the new regime, and one of his sons was installed as its new governor.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} season, 2002–03, saw the Avalanche {{claim the}} NHL {{record for most}} consecutive division titles, nine, breaking the Montreal Canadiens streak of eight, won between 1974–82. The division title came after a bad start by the team, {{that led to the}} exit of head coach Bob Hartley, in December. General Manager Pierre Lacroix promoted assistant coach Tony Granato, who had only three months of coaching experience as an assistant, to the head coach position. The team's playoff spot seemed in doubt at one point, but the Avalanche managed to finish with 105 points, ahead of the Vancouver Canucks <b>by</b> <b>one.</b> <b>The</b> race to the title was exciting, namely the second-to-last game of the season, as the Avalanche needed to win the game to stay in the race, and Milan Hejduk scored with 10 seconds left in overtime to beat Anaheim. The title was guaranteed in {{the final day of the}} regular season, when the Avalanche beat the St. Louis Blues 5–2 and the Vancouver Canucks lost against the Los Angeles Kings 2–0. In the Western Conference Quarter-finals, the Avalanche blew a 3–1 series lead over the Minnesota Wild, and lost in overtime in Game 7. Peter Forsberg won the Art Ross Trophy for the leading scorer of the regular season, which he finished with 106 points (29 goals, 77 assists). Forsberg also won the Hart Memorial Trophy for the regular season's most valuable player and shared the NHL Plus/Minus Award with teammate Milan Hejduk. Hejduk scored 50 goals to win the Maurice 'Rocket' Richard Trophy, awarded annually to the leading goal scorer in the NHL. Forsberg was elected to the league's first All-Star team. Hejduk was elected to the second All-Star team.|$|E
