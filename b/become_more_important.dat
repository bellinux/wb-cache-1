5|$|As the {{commercial}} application of molecular diagnostics has <b>become</b> <b>more</b> <b>important,</b> {{so has the}} debate about patenting of the genetic discoveries at its heart. In 1998, the European Union's Directive 98/44/ECclarified that patents on DNA sequences were allowable. In 2010 in the US, AMP sued Myriad Genetics to challenge the latter's patents regarding two genes, BRCA1, BRCA2, which are associated with breast cancer. In 2013, the U.S. Supreme Court partially agreed, ruling that a naturally occurring gene sequence could not be patented.|$|E

He also described how his portforlio would contribute to economic competitiveness, the social dimension of the EU and the intercultural dialogue and stated that it would provide a forum for European political dialogue.|$|E
5|$|The Oilers re-signed Brewer, {{who was a}} free agent, to a one-year, $907,500 {{contract}} in August 2001. In his second season with the Oilers, Brewer was assigned to play against the opposing teams' best offensive players by Oilers head coach Craig MacTavish. Brewer began to play more minutes in games, typically placing among the NHL leaders in average minutes played per game. With this enhanced role on the team, Brewer finished his season with new career highs in assists and points {{for the second consecutive}} season, and matched his career high in goals. Although his single year contract expired, his role on the Oilers had <b>become</b> <b>more</b> <b>important</b> and Brewer expected a large raise for his third season with the Oilers.|$|E

5|$|The diet of the {{macaroni}} penguin {{consists of}} a variety of crustaceans, squid and fish, although the proportions that each makes up vary with locality and season. Krill, particularly Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba), account for over 90% of food during breeding season. Cephalopods and small fish such as the marbled rockcod (Notothenia rossii), painted notie (Lepidonotothen larseni), Champsocephalus gunneri, the lanternfish species Krefftichthys anderssoni, Protomyctophum tenisoni and P. normani <b>become</b> <b>more</b> <b>important</b> during chick-rearing. Like several other penguin species, the macaroni penguin sometimes deliberately swallows small (10– to 30-mm-diameter) stones; this behaviour has been speculated to aid in providing ballast for deep-sea diving, or to help grind food, especially the exoskeletons of crustaceans which are a significant part of its diet.|$|E

25|$|A {{significant}} amount of formic acid is produced as a byproduct {{in the manufacture of}} other chemicals.

Some nèi fēi also include vintage year and are production-specific to help identify the cake and prevent counterfeiting through a surfeit of different brand labels.|$|E
25|$|Seawater desalination, {{which already}} {{is used in}} some resorts on the Red Sea, {{is also likely to}} become an {{increasingly}} important source for municipal water supply in coastal areas of Egypt. For example, in October 2009 the West Delta Electricity Production Company awarded a contract for a power plant with a 10,000 m3/day seawater desalination plant near Alexandria. Brackish water desalination for irrigation may also <b>become</b> <b>more</b> <b>important.</b>|$|E

25|$|The {{references}} {{found in}} Antiquities have no parallel texts {{in the other}} work by Josephus such as the Jewish War, written twenty years earlier, but some scholars have provided explanations for their absence, such as that the Antiquities covers a longer time period and that during the twenty-year gap between {{the writing of the}} Jewish Wars (c. 70 CE) and Antiquities (after 90 CE) Christians had <b>become</b> <b>more</b> <b>important</b> in Rome and were hence given attention in the Antiquities.|$|E
25|$|As family {{responsibilities}} and vocational pressures lessen, friendships <b>become</b> <b>more</b> <b>important.</b> Among the elderly, friendships can provide {{links to the}} larger community, serve as a protective factor against depression and loneliness, and compensate for potential losses in social support previously given by family members. Especially for people who cannot go out as often, interactions with friends allow for continued societal interaction. Additionally, older adults in declining health who remain in contact with friends show improved psychological well-being.|$|E
25|$|Physical {{attractiveness}} is {{an important}} element of romantic relationships, particularly in the early stages characterized by high levels of passion.

Robert Sternberg has suggested that there are actually three components of love: intimacy, passion, and commitment. When two (or more) people experience all three, they are said to be in a state of consummate love.|$|E

25|$|Infrastructural {{power has}} <b>become</b> <b>more</b> <b>important</b> {{since the time}} of the American and French Revolutions.

As such, infrastructural power became considered a “positive” type of power; it is a source of legitimacy derived directly from civil society and therefore, at least in theory, directly from the people. Infrastructural power is fortified by the state’s ability to perform the services its constituents demand.|$|E

Israel supports it and has quietly begun to offer Palestinians desalination training. In 2012 the French government committed a 10 million-euro grant for the plant. Arab countries, coordinated by the Islamic Development Bank, committed to provide half of the necessary funds, matching an expected European financial commitment. The European Investment Bank provides technical assistance.|$|E
