5000|$|Problems {{arising from}} the {{requirement}} to dive-bomb at up to 60° were never satisfactorily solved, due to the constant increases in loaded weight. Despite strengthened airframes, {{it was possible to}} overstress the airframe during dive-bombing. Although the German bomb-sights of the 1930s were inadequate, the later versions of the Lotfernrohr 7 proved to be comparable to the American Norden bombsight. With the introduction of the Lotfe 7, which offered an error of 20 - 30 m from a release altitude of 3000 - 4000 m and Hermann Göring's rescinding of the dive-attack requirement on 15 September 1942, the barred-gate type dive brakes on the wing's lower surfaces, placed just forward of each of the outboard ends of the Fowler flap panels, were omitted from all He 177As built after the initial A-0 pre-production batch. A photo of one of the 12 [...] "destroyer" [...] He 177A-1/U2, heavy-cannon-armed test airframes, showed the retracted dive <b>brake</b> <b>panel</b> still fitted on the undersurface of the outer starboard wing.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Aerodynamic brake is a {{new type}} of non-adhesion brake mode used to {{high-speed}} train brake by unfolding the <b>brake</b> <b>panel</b> {{on the roof of the}} high speed train to increase aerodynamic resistance. This brake mode is effective especially in the condition of high speed. The article is aimed at designing a set of opening and closing mechanism to control the movement of the <b>brake</b> <b>panel.</b> The opening and closing mechanism mainly include three components of guide mechanism, the center of rotation and drive mechanism. The guide mechanism as auxiliary orientation is a functional unit of the bearing parts used to improve the movement and load conditions of the <b>brake</b> <b>panel.</b> The center of rotation is the key component to support the <b>brake</b> <b>panel</b> and transmit the braking force. The drive mechanism, the power source of the opening and closing mechanism, is designed to drive the <b>brake</b> <b>panel</b> up and down in the reciprocating motion. This paper focuses on the design of the three components, using the method of combining structural design and reliability design and aiming at the final optimal design...|$|E

An electric motor/differential unit {{is used for the}} electric-motion conversion and motion distribution.|$|E

40|$|The {{flow field}} around a {{proposed}} lunar return aerobrake is examined computationally assuming viscous, laminar flow and utilizing an effective gamma approach to incorporate real-gas effects. The flow fields for three cases are calculated with both an axisymmetric and a three-dimensional formulation. The three vehicle configurations have <b>braking</b> <b>panels</b> extended 50 deg, 55 deg, and 60 deg to the inflow (zero lift configurations). The resulting axisymmetric and 3 D flow fields are examined, {{and it is}} shown that despite complexities in the 3 D flow field, the total drag coefficients calculated from modified axisymmetric results {{are very close to}} those obtained from the 3 D solutions. The aerobrake is shown to achieve total drag coefficients as high as 8. 4 for a vehicle with panels deflected to 60 deg...|$|R
50|$|On Short Take-Off But Arrested Recovery {{aircraft}} carriers (STOBAR), conventional aircraft are launched using a ski-jump. The pilot increases the aircraft's thrust by switching on the afterburners, while holding the plane by <b>braking.</b> Two <b>panels</b> are raised {{from the deck}} of the aircraft carrier in front of the aircraft's main landing gear, ensuring the plane remains motionless. Upon command, the pilot releases the brake; the panels from the deck drop back into their slots; and the aircraft rapidly taxis forward under maximum thrust. Rolling over the ski ramp launches the plane both upward and forward.|$|R
5000|$|The Australian and New Zealand {{models were}} {{significantly}} different from the other Camry models around the world and had around 77% locally developed components to suit Australian and New Zealand roads and driving conditions. The <b>brakes,</b> body <b>panels</b> (which would only fit on the Australian made body and chassis), headlights, seats, radio antenna and suspension were all locally developed after 10,000 km of extensive testing in New Zealand under the supervision of Toyota engineers. Power output on the Altise Sport, V6 Sportivo and Azura models was [...] compared with the [...] of the standard V6 models due to a high-flow rear muffler.|$|R
50|$|The driver enters via a {{roof hatch}} that opens {{to the left}} rear. When driving closed-down, {{observation}} is via three day periscopes, while the center periscope can be rapidly replaced by an image-intensification periscope for driving at night. The driver guides the vehicle using a small steering wheel rather than tillers and, as an automatic transmission is fitted, there are just two pedals - accelerator and <b>brake.</b> The instrument <b>panel</b> is mounted on the left, with the transmission selection box on the right.|$|R
5000|$|On {{the night}} of 13 March 2003 the five protesters {{breached}} the perimeter fence of the RAF Fairford base using bolt-cutters, and once inside attacked instrument <b>panels,</b> <b>brake</b> cables and windscreens of support vehicles which were needed to supply the B-52 bombers due to fly that day. [...] They used hammers and are also reported to have been carrying grinding-paste to put into fuel tanks. [...] In their commitment to peaceful protest, {{two members of the}} group left notices on the damaged vehicles to warn operators and prevent an accident. They were discovered by a US serviceman, did not resist arrest, and were taken to Stroud police station. Their actions delayed the planned missions by a few hours, and caused £10,000 worth of damage.|$|R
50|$|Restart after a {{shutdown}} {{required the}} assistance of the parks' maintenance staff. One person would go to the manual brake release under the C brake while the other ran the control <b>panel</b> <b>brake</b> in the house. One train would be taken {{to the top of the}} lift and stopped. The second train would be stopped at the C brake before the second inverted loop. The third train would be in the house. To start the process, the C brake was pulled to release the train for the second loop. The lift train would be released as soon as the C block train was clear of the brake. Once the lift train cleared the house train was released. This was done several times during the first year of operation until the ride was reduced to two trains.|$|R
5000|$|Yamaha {{launched}} the YZF-R1 after redesigning the Genesis engine {{to create a}} more compact engine by raising the gearbox input shaft and allowing the gearbox output shaft to be placed beneath it. This design feature was revolutionary, called a 'stacked gearbox', it has set a precedent for other manufacturers to follow. This [...] "compacting" [...] of the engine made the total engine length much shorter overall, thereby, allowing the wheelbase of the motorcycle to be shortened significantly. This, in turn, allowed the frame design to place the weight of the engine in the frame to aid handling because of an optimized center of gravity. The swingarm was able to be made longer without compromising the overall wheelbase, which was a short 1385mm. Four Kehin CV carburetors of 40mm diameter fed fuel to the engine, 140 bhp was claimed by the factory, at the countershaft. USD 41mm front forks supplied by KYB mounted 300mm semi-floating disk <b>brakes.</b> The instrument <b>panel</b> was electrical with, self diagnosis system inbuilt, and digital speed readout. The exhaust system utilised an EXUP valve, which controlled the exhaust gas flow, to maximise engine power production at all revs, creating a high powered but also torquey engine. The twin headlights were powerful. The Yamaha YZF-R6 was introduced in 1999 as the 600 cc version of the R1 super bike.|$|R
50|$|The {{simulator}} provides engineers, {{teams and}} drivers {{the opportunity to}} test and develop the whole car setup and data analysis systems, to optimize the driving skills and to learn new tracks. Allows a driver to drive exactly the same monocoque used on the track, with the same controls (pedals, <b>brake,</b> instrument <b>panel)</b> and {{the same level of}} feedback (effort steering and brake). The helmet is mandatory, as well as the gloves, the shoes and the race suit. The advanced system of complete circuit simulation, obtained by laser scanning high-fidelity combined with sophisticated multi-body model, allows to replicate the real car behavior with unprecedented accuracy. The pilot has the opportunity to learn not only the speed with which it must take a curve, but the same curve as it really is; roughness of the terrain, bumps and curbs are entirely modeled thanks to the technology of laser scanning data processing. There are all the cars and the tracks of all the categories in which it operates Dallara, from Formula Three to IndyCar, from Monte Carlo to Indianapolis. It is possible to change any configuration parameter in the car {{to meet the needs of}} the pilot and test the changes in a controlled environment. The thermal model of the tire allows the preparation of structures for both the qualification for the race, considering the wear of the tires, the characteristics of the track and weather conditions. All changes can be imposed immediately via the user interface developed in Dallara. This has been specifically designed to ensure ease of use, data security and speed of execution. The simulator allows you to analyze the same data channels of a real car, with even greater precision in the absence of noise in the signal and error during calibration tool. The fidelity of the mathematical model has been validated carefully by professional pilots in various categories. It is also possible to access a series of channels normally impossible to obtain on a real machine (for example, the forces on the tires). This allows a more detailed and scrupulous behavior of the vehicle.|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Different {{models of}} {{tractors}} have been imported from foreign countries or assembled in Iran for many years. Consistency of foreign manufactured products with native specifications and {{the improvement of}} locally manufactured tractors are important problems that must be considered. Moreover, tractor dimensions, sitting space and some other important {{factors such as the}} ability of Iranian users to operate them must be taken into consideration. In this study, we surveyed the proper proportion of tractors dimension, location of control tools and driver’s work space, with Iranian users’ anthropometric data of drivers from five provinces. Human factors are of paramount importance in developing farm machinery given that these machines will often be operated by persons with minimum skills. Therefore, farm machinery should be made simple to operate and as free from hazards as possible. Materials and methods: Firstly, the anthropometric data for 250 users 20 - 60 years old was calculated. The drivers were selected randomly. Then the specifications of 4 tractors including: Ferguson 285, Ferguson 399, Valtra and New Holland were compared with the anthropometric data of user in 5 th and 95 th percentile value and their adaptation was studied. Anthropometric Data of subjects consisted of: standing height, full hand length, popliteal length, seat pan width, seat pan depth, elbow height, seat back support height, hand pan width, hand grip and full-leg length. Getting on the tractor is the first contact of an operator with a tractor. In assessing the suitability of the provision made for getting on the tractor, an experiment was arranged in which operators tried to get on 3 tractors. The mode of getting on the tractors, the agony on the operator’s face, the muscular reactions and individual opinion on the difficulties or comfort while undertaking the task were observed and recorded. The specifications of tractors compared with Anthropometric Data were measured, whiles the tractors were positioned on a level ground for measurements after the tires had been ganged. These specifications were tractor height, steering wheel height, footrest height, foot set height; tractor seat geometry as seat pan width, seat pan depth and seat pan support height; steering geometry as distance of steering wheel from seat reference point, steering wheel radius, steering wheel thickness, steering wheel inclination to the horizontal and seat reach adjustment; levers and pedals distance from seat reference point as gear lever, parking brake lever, hydraulic control lever, clutch pedal, accelerator pedal, <b>brake</b> pedal, front <b>panel,</b> workspace width and workspace length. Results and Discussion: The experiment that was conducted with operators attempting to get on the tractors indicated that tractor steps heights were higher than the desirable limit. Therefore, based on the ideas of the researcher and tractors drivers, getting on all tractors is difficult. With {{an increase in the number}} of steps or a decrease in their heights, the desirable condition can be created. Seat depth of new Holland and Valtra tractors were great for drivers in the 5 th percentile value. A variable thickness pad can solve this problem. Results of studies indicated that Seat depth of Massey Ferguson 285 and 399 was shorter than driver’s leg length of 95 th percentile value. To solve the problem an increase of 10 centimeters to pad height of these tractors was suggested. Seat pad of tractors were short for drivers in the 95 th percentile value. Distance of steering wheel from seat reference point (SRP) in Massey Ferguson 285 and Valtra was further than drivers hand length in the 5 th percentile value. Therefore, the drivers hand is short for driver’s good operation. Surveys indicated that drivers had problems for gear lever access in Massey Ferguson 399. Therefore, for good access on gear lever we must increase seat stroke range by 5 - 10 centimeters. The record available from Meteorological Organization indicated that air temperature and rain throughout the year in the study area is between 20 to 40 degrees Celsius and 100 to 300 mm change. Valtra and New Holland tractors having a driver cabs with heating and cooling equipment have the ideal space for the performance of their driver. Massey Ferguson 285 tractor does not have any driver cab and Roll Over Protection Structure (ROPS). Conclusions: This research was conducted in five provinces of Iran to assess ergonomics of some commonly and new used tractors in Iran containing Ferguson 285, Ferguson 399, Valtra and New Holland. As there was no data base with required details, data was collected directly by personal contact with tractor users. A questionnaire was filled out for each person and anthropometric data was calculated in all provinces for 250 users 20 - 60 year old that were selected at random. Then relevant specifications of 4 tractors were measured and compared with the relevant anthropometric data of users in the 5 th and 95 th percentile value and their adaptation was studied. The results indicated that tractor steps, Seat depth, distance of steering wheel and distance of some levers and pedals from seat reference point should be amended...|$|R
