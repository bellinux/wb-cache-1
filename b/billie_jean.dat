5|$|On August 11, 1952, Williams was {{dismissed}} from the Grand Ole Opry for habitual drunkenness and missing shows. He returned to Shreveport, Louisiana {{to perform in}} KWKH and WBAM shows and in the Louisiana Hayride, for which he toured again. His performances were acclaimed when he was sober, but {{despite the efforts of}} his work associates to get him to shows sober, his abuse of alcohol resulted in occasions when he did not appear or his performances were poor. In October 1952 he married <b>Billie</b> <b>Jean</b> Jones.|$|E

Soon after its premiere the video was also running on other video {{programs}} including BET's Video Soul, SuperStation WTBS's Night Tracks, and NBC's Friday Night Videos. In fact, Beat It was the first video shown on the latter's first ever telecast on July 29, 1983.|$|E
500|$|Jackson stated {{several times}} that [...] "Billie Jean" [...] {{was based on the}} groupies he and his {{brothers}} encountered while part of The Jackson 5. [...] "Billie Jean is kind of anonymous. It represents a lot of girls. They used to call them groupies in the '60s." [...] He added: [...] "They would hang around backstage doors, and any band that would come to town they would have a relationship with, and I think I wrote this out of experience with my brothers when I was little. There were a lot of <b>Billie</b> <b>Jeans</b> out there. Every girl claimed that their son was related to one of my brothers." [...] The reason for this was due to the fame of the Jackson 5, and wanting to have their money {{in order to have a}} way of living.|$|R

5|$|On October 18, 1952, Williams and <b>Billie</b> <b>Jean</b> Jones Eshlimar {{were married}} in Minden, Louisiana by a justice of the peace. It was the second {{marriage}} for both (each being divorced with children). The next day two public ceremonies were also held at the New Orleans Civic Auditorium, where 14,000 seats were sold for each. After Williams' death, a judge ruled that the wedding was not legal because Jones Eshlimar's divorce had not become final until eleven days after she married Williams. Williams' first wife, Audrey, and his mother, Lillie Williams, were the driving forces behind having the marriage declared invalid and pursued the matter for years. Williams had also married Audrey Sheppard before her divorce was final, on the tenth day of a required 60-day reconciliation period.|$|E

At the <b>Billie</b> <b>Jean</b> King Cup exhibition, Kuznetsova lost her match to Williams. For the first as the top seed, due to Serena Williams and Safina's withdrawal at the BNP Paribas Open, she was upset by Carla Suárez Navarro in the second round after receiving a first round bye. Kuznetsova was seeded, for the sixth and last time to date, first at the Sony Ericsson Open and after receiving a bye in the first round, managed to prevent another upset by defeating Peng Shuai in the second round. She then defeated 27th seed Ágnes Szávay to book a fourth round encounter with Marion Bartoli, losing to the French No. 1 in the quarterfinal.|$|E
5|$|She {{was born}} in Paris and moved with her family to Washington, D.C., in 1966. As a child, Smith was often teased because of her voice. She became a {{professional}} actress in 1982 after graduating from drama school and moved to New York City in 1984, where she appeared in the Broadway production of Tom Stoppard's The Real Thing. She made her film debut in 1985's Heaven Help Us, followed by roles in The Legend of <b>Billie</b> <b>Jean</b> and Maximum Overdrive.

She voiced Lisa for three seasons on The Tracey Ullman Show, and in 1989, the shorts were spun off into their own half-hour show, The Simpsons. For her work as the character, Smith received a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance in 1992.|$|E

25|$|Martina Hingis {{has come}} closer {{than any other}} {{currently}} active player to joining this elite group. She just needs the French Open singles, having reached the final in 1997 and 1999.

Collectively, the complex is called the USTA <b>Billie</b> <b>Jean</b> King National Tennis Center.|$|E
25|$|The US Open tennis tournament {{has been}} played since 1978 at the USTA <b>Billie</b> <b>Jean</b> King National Tennis Center, located {{just south of}} Citi Field.

25|$|Riggs first {{challenged}} <b>Billie</b> <b>Jean</b> King, {{but when}} she declined, Margaret Court stepped in. At the time in 1973, Court was 30 years old and the top female player in the world. On the day of their match on May 13, 5,000 fans came to a Mother's Day match in Ramona, California. Televised by CBS Sports, Riggs descended the stadium steps and presented Court with Mother's Day flowers, which she accepted while curtsying. Riggs used his drop shots and lobs to keep Court off balance. His quick victory (6–2, 6–1) landed Riggs {{on the cover of}} both Sports Illustrated and Time.|$|E
25|$|Riggs had {{originally}} challenged <b>Billie</b> <b>Jean</b> King, {{but she had}} declined. Following Court's loss to Riggs, King accepted his challenge, and the two met in the Houston Astrodome on prime time television on Thursday, September 20, in a match billed as The Battle of the Sexes. The oddsmakers and writers favored Riggs; he built an early lead, but King won in straight sets (6–4, 6–3, 6–3) for the $100,000 winner-take-all prize. Unlike a similar match between Jimmy Connors and Martina Navratilova in 1992, in which the rules were altered to favor the female player, this match was played using the normal rules of tennis.|$|E
25|$|WTT {{division}} semifinals {{and division}} championship series in 1974, were played over two legs, one match {{on the home}} court of each team. The team with the best aggregate score over the two matches was the winner. The Nets met the Philadelphia Freedoms in the Eastern Division Semifinals. The Freedoms had the best regular-season record {{in the league and}} were led by WTT Most Valuable Player <b>Billie</b> <b>Jean</b> King. As the higher seed, the Freedoms had the choice to play either the first or the second match at home. Despite playing two tight matches, the Nets lost them both, 26–22 at home and 23–22 in Philadelphia, and saw their season come to an end.|$|E
25|$|In the WTT Finals, the Racquets met the Philadelphia Freedoms {{who had the}} league's best regular-season {{record and}} were led by their player=coach and WTT Most Valuable Player <b>Billie</b> <b>Jean</b> King. The Racquets swept the best-of-three series, 27–21 at home and 28–24 in front of 5,134 fans in Philadelphia, to win the championship. In the second match, Andrew Pattison's 6–0 set win in men's singles proved {{too much for the}} Freedoms to {{overcome}} despite winning three of the five sets in the match. Buster Mottram started that set for the Freedoms against Pattison. King sent Brian Fairlie in as a substitute after Mottram fell behind, 3–0, and managed only three points in those three games. Fairlie didn't fare better, not getting any points in his first two games.|$|E
25|$|The 1975 Wimbledon Championships had Evert faced {{off against}} <b>Billie</b> <b>Jean</b> King in the semifinals, which saw Evert win {{the first set}} because of the fine groundstrokes she was hitting. King got a pivotal service break on the Evert serve {{in the first game}} of the second set, which proved decisive, which Evert showed her poise by {{breaking}} back in the fourth game, but this was not enough to get it done against the tenacious King, who broke back in the fifth and seventh service games. During the last set Evert was a cruising up three games and had a 40 to 15 point lead in the set, but King would not be denied, which Evert never once again won a game in the match and lost it in 62, 26, 36.|$|E
25|$|Williams {{was ranked}} World No. 31 going into Wimbledon and was seeded 23rd at the tournament {{due to her}} {{previous}} results at Wimbledon. Williams was a game away from defeat in her first round match against Alla Kudryavtseva and in her third round match against Akiko Morigami she was two points away from defeat, but she eventually won both 7–5 in the third set. She then advanced to reach her sixth Wimbledon final, after beating Maria Sharapova, Svetlana Kuznetsova and Ana Ivanovic in straight sets en route, where she defeated 18th seed Marion Bartoli also in straight sets. Williams thus became only the fourth woman in the open era to win Wimbledon at least four times, along with <b>Billie</b> <b>Jean</b> King, Martina Navratilova and Steffi Graf. She also became the lowest-seeded Wimbledon champion in history, breaking the record she herself set in 2005. Williams returned to the top 20 {{as a result of}} the win.|$|E
