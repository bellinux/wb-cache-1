However, it is often difficult in practice to identify these metamorphic phenomenon because they are usually weak and restricted in size. Peperitic sills, intruded into wet sedimentary rocks, commonly do not bake upper margins and have upper and lower autobreccias, closely similar to lavas.|$|E
40|$|In the 1960 's, Hsu and Maxwell {{imported}} {{two aspects}} of the geology of the Northern Apennines and Sicily to the Franciscan: argille scagliose [...] literally scaly clays [...] and olistostromes. Although the term argille scagliose was coined in 1840 to describe rocks with a certain mesoscopic fabric, by the 1960 's the term had been broadened In Italy to include many types of rock units with a chaotic aspect imparted by blocks of diverse sizes disposed in a clay matrix. These chaotic complexes were popularly inferred to have originated as submarine landslides. the term olistostrome was used for sedimentary bodies, consisting partly of argille <b>brecciate,</b> that were emplaced into normally bedded sections by slides or debris flows. Hence, when these terms were first used for Franciscan rocks, they strongly connoted an origin by sedimentary or mass-flow processes. During the past 30 years, the origin {{of much of the}} chaotic and disrupted Franciscan has remained controversial, while our understanding of N. Apennine geology has evolved. Can two major re-interpretations of Apennine geology now help to resolve Franciscan controversies? Recent work in the N. Apennines has enabled the subdivision of the chaotic complexes, consisting partly of argille scagliose and <b>brecciate,</b> into two kinds of units, which each have different origins and ages. Tectonosomes are disrupted Cretaceous and early Tertiary stratigraphic sequences that were probably deformed in a pre-Oligocene accretionary wedge; they now reside in the extensive Ligurian nappe. The nappe itself, which contains these remnants of a B-type accretionary wedge, is an A-type wedge that is advancing onto the continental Adria plate. The olistostromes are present in strata deposited in late Eocene and younger Epiligurian basins, riding piggyback on the nappe, and in foreland-basin deposits partly overridden by the nappe...|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} design is described {{to test the}} hypothesis that ice segregation near the top of permafrost and in {{the lower part of the}} active layer can <b>brecciate</b> frost-susceptible bedrock. Seasonal temperature cycles in the active layer and the top of permafrost were simulated to a first approximation within a block of chalk measuring 30 m × 31 m wide and 33 m high and insulated around the sides to minimize lateral heat transfer. The block, moistened first by capillary rise, was initially frozen from the surface downwards, simulating permafrost aggradation. Thereafter, the upper half of the block was cycled above and below 0 °C (simulating seasonal freezing and thawing of the active layer) while the lower half remained below 0 °C (simulating permafrost). During thaw cycles water was supplied to the surface and base of the simulated active layer. Temperature, unfrozen water content, surface frost heave and porewater pressure within the chalk were monitored during the experiment...|$|R
40|$|Sorkheh-Dizaj apatite-iron oxide deposit {{is located}} 32 km {{southeast}} of Zanjan. The area is situated within the Tarom subzone of Western Alborz-Azarbaijan structural zone. The oldest units at the Sorkheh-Dizaj area are Eocene trachyte, trachyandesite, olivine basalt and volcanoclastic <b>brecciate</b> tuff and lapilli tuff which intruded by a quartz-monzonite, monzonite and granite subvolcanic pluton of Upper Eocene- Early Oligocene age. Subvolcanic plutonic {{rocks in the}} area show characteristics of the I-type granites. Magmatism of the area is of synorogenic to postorogenic related to magmatic arc environments. Mineralization at the area {{is divided into three}} main zones (A, B and C) that all of which are located in the host subvolcanic pluton. These three zones are similar in terms of host rock, mineralogy, alteration, structure, texture and metal content. Mineralization in the volcanic rocks occurs as veins similar to those in three main zones, but less abundant. Geometry of the ore bodies is of vein type and their textures are stockwork, massive, banded, <b>brecciate</b> and vein-veinlet. The most important minerals at Sorkheh-Dizaj deposit are magnetite (low Ti) and apatite that associated with them minor sulfide minerals such as chalcopyrite, bornite and pyrite. Minerals such as ilmenite, spinel (titanium magnetite), galena and sphalerite occur in low contents. The supergene minerals like chalcocite, malachite, azurite, covellite, hematite and goethite have been formed due to weathering and supergene processes. The main alterations at the deposit are K-feldspar metasomatism, actinolitization, argillic, sericitization, silicification, tourmalinization, and chlorite-epidotic. Rare earth elements (REE) studies demonstrate that the deposit is more enriched in LREE than in HREE. The REE patterns in the apatite, magnetite and host rocks are similar suggesting a magmatic relationship. The REE contents of the apatites are higher than those of the host rocks and magnetites. Fluid inclusion studies were conducted on two generations of apatite in the deposit. Based on the studies, the temperature and salinity of the first generation apatites are higher than those for the second generation apatites. The most important characteristics of the Sorkheh-Dizaj iron-oxide apatite deposit indicated magmatic Fe-P-REE-rich fluids source for the mineralization. Comparison of the most important characteristics of the Sorkheh-Dizaj iron-oxide apatite deposit (including tectonic setting, host rock, mineralogy, alteration, structure and texture and geochemistry) with those of various types of iron mineralization in the world suggest that Sorkheh-Dizaj iron-oxide apatite deposit shows the most similarity with the Kiruna type iron-oxide apatite deposits classified as a subgroup of hydrothermal Iron Oxide Copper Gold (IOCG) deposits...|$|R

25|$|The interpretable {{geologic}} {{history of}} the Michelangelo quadrangle begins {{with the formation of}} the four ancient, multiring basins. From oldest to youngest, they are: Barma-Vincente, Bartok-Ives, Hawthorne-Riemenschneider, and Eitoku-Milton. These basins presumably formed during the period of heavy bombardment inferred from lunar history (Wilhelms, in press). Contemporaneous with their formation and shortly afterward, was the deposition of the intercrater plains material. This unit has a complex history of deposition; it was reworked in place and probably includes <b>brecciated</b> plutonic rocks and possibly ancient volcanic flows. Deposition of the intercrater plains material was waning as the next oldest basins (Dostoevskij, Tolstoj) were formed. Partly overlapping their formation was the deposition of the intermediate plains material, probably emplaced partly as distal basin ejecta and partly as volcanic flows. Regional deformation of these plains units by compressive tectonics, forming scarps, was contemporaneous with their deposition.|$|E

40|$|Many {{important}} geological {{concepts and}} features were first recognized and {{described in the}} Apennines and Sicily. In these areas, among the most distinctive features are rock units characterized in outcrop by variably disrupted strata or blocks of diverse sizes disposed in a clay-rich matrix. The stratal disruption and the intense weathering give an overall chaotic or non-bedded appearance to these units, and various names {{have been used for}} them, including argille scagliose, argille <b>brecciate,</b> caotico eterogeneo, Chaotic Complex, Undifferentiated Complex, Ligurian mélange, and olistostrome. Some of these terms, such as argille scagliose and olistostrome, have been applied to mélanges in other mountain chains, even while Apennine geologists continued to debate whether local examples resulted from tectonic or gravitational processes. The purpose of this chapter is to provide a brief review of past and current research on disrupted rock units in the Apennines. First, we briefly review how the nomenclature originated and evolved. Second, we summarize the criteria that are currently being used in the Northern Apennines to subdivide these units into two major types, tectonosomes and olistostromes, which originated by in situ tectonic deformation and by gravitational mass movements, respectively...|$|R

The intrusive bodies are of I-type calc-alkaline series formed in syn-collision to post collision settings of continental margin subduction zone.

The temperature and salinity of fluid inclusions in quartz veins associated with serpentine (in retrograde stage) range from 217 to 280 ˚c and 8 to 16 (wt %) NaCl respectively, indicating the mixing of magmatic and meteoric water in retrograde stage.

The record commences before 88 ka with valley cutting at Pegwell Bay. Valley filling had begun by c. 88 ka and continued to at least 74 ka, coinciding with a major episode of loess deposition in Europe. Permafrost aggradation commenced before c. 21 ka, <b>brecciating</b> near-surface chalk by ice segregation in permafrost and the overlying active layer. Deposition of aeolian sand (coversand) occurred at c. 24 21 ka, correlating with the Older Coversand I in mainland Europe. Permafrost degradation commenced at c. 21 ka, probably due to climate warming during Greenland Interstadial 2. The resulting active-layer deepening through ice-rich permafrost initiated soft-sediment deformation and formation of large-scale patterned ground in an active layer c. 2 m deep. Renewed permafrost aggradation between c. 21. 25 and 18 ka coincided with climate cooling during Greenland Stadial 2 c and led to cryoturbation in a thinner active layer. Final permafrost degradation commenced no later than c. 14. 7 ka, that is, the start of Greenland Interstadial 1 e, and may have occurred to some extent during the climate warming associated with Greenland Stadial 2 b (c. 19. 5 16. 9 ka). Renewed deposition of aeolian sand took place at c. 15. 5 ka, coincident with loess deposition on Thanet.

40|$|The Kangerlussuaq Alkaline Complex, East Greenland, {{is one of}} {{the largest}} {{alkaline}} complexes in the world. It is known to host a number of occurrences of base and precious metal mineralization, including the Flammefjeld porphyry Mo deposits and a suite of epithermal style base and precious metal veins in an area around the Søndre Syenitgletscher. Here we describe and date a previously unknown occurrence of molybdenite-pyrite-scheelite–bearing quartz veins associated with alkali basalt dikes that intrude the main syenites of the complex. The veins appear to be cogenetic with the dikes, which crosscut and <b>brecciate</b> granodiorites of the Cirque 1320 complex. Sulfur isotope signatures of molybdenite and pyrite in the veins give a tight range with mean δ 34 S of 2. 2 ± 0. 7 ‰, consistent with a magmatic S source related to the intrusion of the dikes. Molybdenite from the veins gave an Re-Os age of 52. 74 ± 0. 26 Ma, some 13 m. y. older than molybdenite at the Flammefjeld porphyry deposit, thus distinguishing this metallogenic episode as a distinct event, temporally unrelated to the known Mo mineralization at Flammefjeld. Significantly, in terms of the timing of regional metallogenesis and magmatism, our date suggests that the age of the Kangerlussuaq Alkaline Complex itself may be slightly older than the 50 Ma currently accepted, based on 40 Ar- 39 Ar dating from biotites in the main syenites. Given the common discrepancy in ore systems of 40 Ar- 39 Ar, which produce slightly younger dates than those by Re-Os and U-Pb, we suggest the actual age of the Kangerlussuaq Alkaline Complex may be closer to 53 to 52 Ma...|$|R
40|$|Highlights • Analytical and {{numerical}} {{methods are}} employed to investigate fluid flow in active mud volcanoes or SHHS. • The effects of conduit radius and fluid properties on the flow rate are presented. • Conduit radius of such piercement systems cannot exceed a few metres at depth. • Clasts, if not densely packed, {{will not affect}} the flow rate when they are smaller than {{a fifth of the}} conduit size. • A maximal exsolution depth between 1800 and 3200 m is inferred for CH 4 and between 750 and 1000 m for CO 2. Clastic eruptions involve the rapid ascension of sedimentary clasts together with fluids, gas and/or liquid phases that may further deform and <b>brecciate</b> the host rocks. These fluids transport the resulting mixture, called mud breccia, to the surface. Such eruptions are often associated with geological structures such as mud volcanoes, hydrothermal vent complexes and, more generally, piercement structures. They involve various processes, acting over a wide range of scales, which makes them a complex and challenging multi-phase system to model. Although piercement structures have been widely studied and discussed, only a few {{attempts have been made to}} model the dynamics of such clastic eruptions. The ongoing Lusi mud eruption, in the East Java back-arc basin, which began in May 2006, is a spectacular large scale clastic eruption. The Lusi eruptive behaviour has been extensively studied over the past decade and thus represents a unique opportunity to better understand ongoing clastic eruptions and thus fossil clastic systems. We use both analytical formulations and numerical models to investigate simple relationships between the mud breccia properties (density, viscosity, gas and clast content) and the volumetric flow rate. Our results show that the conduit radius of such piercement systems cannot exceed a few metres at depth, and that clasts, if not densely packed, will not affect the flow rate when they are smaller than a fifth of the conduit size. Using published data for the annual gas fluxes at Lusi, we infer a maximal depth at which exsolution starts. This occurs between 1800 m and 3200 m depth for methane and between 750 m and 1000 m for carbon dioxide. Based on annual gas fluxes, we estimate that the conduit radius should be no larger than 1. 5 m to match the maximal mud discharge, recorded at Lusi...|$|R
40|$|The Jericho {{kimberlite}} (173. 1. ±. 1. 3. Ma) {{is a small}} (~. 130. ×. 70. m), multi-vent {{system that}} preserves products from deep (>. 1. km?) portions of kimberlite vents. Pit mapping, drill core examination, petrographic study, image analysis of olivine crystals (grain size distributions and shape studies), and compositional and mineralogical studies, are used to reconstruct processes from near-surface magma ascent to kimberlite emplacement and alteration. The Jericho kimberlite formed by multiple eruptions through an Archean granodiorite batholith that was overlain by mid-Devonian limestones ~. 1. km in thickness. Kimberlite magma ascended through granodiorite basement by dyke propagation but ascended through limestone, at least in part, by locally <b>brecciating</b> the host rocks. After the first explosive breakthrough to surface, vent deepening and widening occurred by the erosive forces of the waxing phase of the eruption, by gravitationally induced failures as portions of the vent margins slid into the vent and, in the deeper portions of the vent (>. 1. km), by scaling, as thin slabs burst from the walls into the vent. At currently exposed levels, coherent kimberlite (CK) dykes (<. 40. cm thick) are found {{to the north and}} south of the vent complex and represent the earliest preserved in-situ products of Jericho magmatism. Timing of CK emplacement on {{the eastern side of the}} vent complex is unclear; some thick CK (15 - 20. m) may have been emplaced after the central vent was formed. Explosive eruptive products are preserved in four partially overlapping vents that are roughly aligned along strike with the coherent kimberlite dyke. The volcaniclastic kimberlite (VK) facies are massive and poorly sorted, with matrix- to clast-supported textures. The VK facies fragmented by dry, volatile-driven processes and were emplaced by eruption column collapse back into the volcanic vents. The first explosive products, poorly preserved because of partial destruction by later eruptions, are found in the central-east vent and were formed by eruption column collapse after the vent was largely cleared of country rock debris. The next active vent was either the north or south vent. Collapse of the eruption column, linked to a vent widening episode, resulted in coeval avalanching of pipe margin walls into the north vent, forming interstratified lenses of country rock-rich boulder breccias in finer-grained volcaniclastic kimberlite. South vent kimberlite has similar characteristics to kimberlite of the north vent and likely formed by similar processes. The final eruptive phase formed olivine-rich and moderately sorted deposits of the central vent. Better sorting is attributed to recycling of kimberlite debris by multiple eruptions through the unconsolidated volcaniclastic pile and associated collapse events. Post-emplacement alteration varies in intensity, but in all cases, has overprinted the primary groundmass and matrix, in CK and VK, respectively. Erosion has since removed all limestone cover...|$|R
2500|$|Central peaks {{are common}} within craters of c3 and c4 age, rare in craters of c2 age. Their origin may be genetically {{related to the}} inner rings of larger craters and basins. Crater floors are {{underlain}} by a zone of shattered and <b>brecciated</b> material formed by the shock wave resulting from impact. Crater-rim material consists of decompressed ejecta from the impact, whereas central peaks were probably formed by the converging flow of slump material from the crater walls (Shoemaker, 1981). If a crater was sufficiently large, the converging flow resulted in an inner ring rather than a central peak. An alternative model for central ring or peak formation was discussed by Melosh (1983), who suggested that they form {{as a result of}} rebound of fractured material analogous to the jet produced by a stone dropped into water. Depending {{on the size of the}} crater, the result is either a central peak or an inner ring. The limiting crater size for central peaks has been defined by Guest and others (1979, p.88) as about 150km. This size limit seems to be generally applicable in the Beethoven quadrangle with the exception of the ringed crater Judah Ha-Levi (lat 11° N., long 109°), which has an inner rim-crest diameter of about 80km. Although this crater appears to have two rings, its inner ring structure is morphologically fresher than the outer ring, and it may have been formed by a separate and later impact.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} conodont biostratigraphy and {{palaeoecology}} in the Darriwilian (Middle Ordovician) of Baltoscandia, with focus on limestone strata showing {{traces of the}} ~ 470 Ma L-chondrite parent body break-up. The evidence for this cosmic event includes abundant centimeter to decimeter-sized fossil meteorites and elevated levels of sediment-dispersed extraterrestrial L-type chromite found in a stratigraphical interval corresponding to the uppermost Lenodus antivariabilis, the L. variabilis, and the Yangtzeplacognathus crassus conodont biozones, and the lower Microzarkodina hagetiana Subzone of the Lenodus (Eoplacognathus?) pseudoplanus Zone. Whereas these fossil meteorites are found only on freshly-sawed limestone-slabs at the active Thorsberg quarry on Mount Kinnekulle, southern Sweden, the occurrence of chromite has been recorded from various localities in Sweden, {{as well as in}} Russia and south-central China. A high-resolution conodont biostratigraphy over the c. 2. 5 m thick, chromite-rich interval at the abandoned Hällekis quarry, Kinnekulle, was established in order to improve correlation between chromite-yielding sequences. Since the meteorite/chromite-rich interval here directly associates with a conspicuous rock sequence known as the ‘Täljsten’ interval, these strata were also investigated for palaeoecological and environmental changes. This anomalous interval has previously been suggested to represent a relative sea-level fall, but it has also been speculated that its formation could have been linked to the L-chondrite parent body break-up. Hence, the nature of the ‘Täljsten’ needed to be further explored in terms of faunal dynamics and depositional setting. The conodont fauna demonstrated continuous faunal reorganizations throughout the sampled sequence, as did additional microfaunal components. Along with observed changes in microfacies, it could be verified that the chromite-rich interval coincides with a gradually progressing regression-transgression cycle. An interesting find of tiny Panderodus conodont elements, including a serrate arcuatiform element, was made in a bed deposited just prior to the inferred maximum lowstand of the ‘Täljsten’ interval. Such serrate elements have previously been referred to as ecophenotypes of non-serrate forms, but sometimes also as distinctive species or subspecies. The Hällekis specimens, described as Panderodus serratus hallekisensis, represent one of the earliest records of the genus and hence provided clues to the primitive morphology and suprageneric relationship of Panderodus. Due to an observed tendency for overlapping morphologies and inconsistencies in identifications, the shapes of dextral Pa-elements from the zonal indices L. variabilis, Y. crassus and L. (E?) pseudoplanus were quantitatively compared using landmark-based geometric morphometrics. Linear shape of the posterior and posterio-lateral denticle rows combined was considered to best reflect the overall shape of the element-type in question, and 23 landmarks were used for the analysis; 4 fixed and 19 sliders (semi-landmarks). The analyses highlighted large-scale shape and symmetry related differences between the three species, but also revealed some overlaps. It also became clear that the three taxa display notable shape-variation of the dextral Pa element, a matter only looked into closer for L. variabilis. The Y. crassus elements included in the analysis suggest that the Baltoscandian and Chinese forms cannot be regarded as equivalents. The contingencies regarding the zonal indices naturally influence, e. g., the potential for a high-resolution correlation of chromite distribution between Kinnekulle and coeval sedimentary sequences at other localities. It was recently shown that the > 1000 km 2 Osmussaar Breccia in north-western Estonia contains non-reworked L-type chromite, suggesting a connection to an L-chondritic impactor. An assessment of the conodont fauna of the limestones above the <b>brecciate</b> layers indicates that the formation of the breccia concurred with the deposition of the meteorite/chromite-yielding strata in Sweden. The limestone bed immediately superposing the breccia could be brought to the Microzakodina ozarkodella Subzone of the L. (E?) pseudoplanus Zone, i. e. only slightly higher stratigraphically than the recognized upper limit for high abundances of extraterrestrial material. This stratigraphical divergence as compared to the Swedish interval can be explained by a period of non-deposition and a resulting hiatus, a conceivable scenario considering the numerous sedimentation-gaps characterizing the early Darriwilian of north-western Estonia...|$|R

The first little range is composed of a <b>brecciated</b> purple porphyritic claystone, with obscurely marked strata dipping at 70 degrees to the S.W.; the other ranges consist of--a pale-coloured feldspathic porphyry,--a purple claystone porphyry with grains of quartz,-- and a rock almost exclusively composed of brick-red crystals of feldspar. These outermost small lines of elevation extend in a N.W. by W. and S.E. by S. direction.|$|E
6000|$|L. There are a {{thousand}} {{ways in which}} it may have been done, the difficulty is not to account for the doing of it, but for the showing of it in some crystals and not in others You never by any chance get a quartz crystal broken or twisted in this way. If it break or twist at all which it does sometimes, like the spire of Dijon, it is by its own will or fault, it never seems to have been passively crushed But, for the forces which cause this passive ruin of the tourmaline,--here is a stone which will show you multitudes of them in operation at once It is known as [...] "biecciated agate," [...] beautiful, as you see, and highly valued as a pebble yet, so far as I can read or hear no one has ever looked at it with the least attention At the first glance, you see it is made of very fine red striped agates, which have been broken into small pieces, and fastened together again by paste also of agate There would be nothing wonderful in this, if this were all. It is well known that by the movements of strata, portions of rock are often shattered to pieces:--well known also that agate is a deposit of flint by water under certain conditions of heat and pressure: there is, therefore, nothing wonderful in an agate's being broken; and nothing wonderful in its being mended with the solution out of which it was itself originally congealed. And with this explanation, most people, looking at a <b>brecciated</b> agate, or <b>brecciated</b> anything, seem to be satisfied. I was so myself, for twenty years; but, lately happening to stay for some time at the Swiss Baden, where the beach of the Limmat is almost wholly composed of <b>brecciated</b> limestones, I began to examine them thoughtfully; and perceived, in the end, that they were, one and all, knots of as rich mystery as any poor little human brain was ever lost in. That piece of agate in your hand, Mary, will show you many of the common phenomena of breccias; but you need not knit your brows over it in that way; depend upon it, neither you nor I shall ever know anything about the way it was made, as long as we live.|$|E

Look there," [...] I said, pointing to the strata of stiff blue clay which were yet to be seen among the grass and bushes that clothed the sides of the pit, [...] "the formation is the same. I'll be bound that if we went down there we should find 'pipes' of soapy <b>brecciated</b> rock. Look, too," [...] and I pointed to a series of worn flat slabs of stone that were placed on a gentle slope below the level of a watercourse which in some past age had been cut out of the solid rock; [...] "if those are not tables once used to wash the 'stuff,' I'm a Dutchman." ...|$|E
60|$|In the {{northern}} {{parts of this}} group there are some cliffs of gravel and of the boulder formation. In the southern part (at P. Andres in Tres Montes), there is a volcanic formation, probably of tertiary origin. The lavas attain a thickness of from two to three hundred feet; they are extremely variable in colour and nature, being compact, or <b>brecciated,</b> or cellular, or amygdaloidal with zeolite, agate and bole, or porphyritic with glassy albitic feldspar. There is also much imperfect rubbly pitchstone, with the interstices charged with powdery carbonate of lime apparently of contemporaneous origin. These lavas are conformably associated with strata of breccia and of brown tuff containing lignite. The whole mass has been broken up and tilted at an angle of 45 degrees, {{by a series of}} great volcanic dikes, one of which was thirty yards in breadth. This volcanic formation resembles one, presently to be described, in Chiloe.|$|E
