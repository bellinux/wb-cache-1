The Russell family also drew media and critical attention for storylines involving various LGBT topics: Chad Harris-Crane's affair with Vincent and subsequent confusion about his sexual orientation, Simone's coming out as lesbian to her family, and the revelation that Vincent was intersex. While the show's treatment of sexual and gender identity has received mixed feedback from critics, Passions won the award for Outstanding Daily Drama at the 17th GLAAD Media Awards for its portrayal of Simone's sexuality.|$|E

25|$|<b>Black</b> <b>History</b> <b>Month</b> often sparks {{an annual}} {{debate about the}} {{continued}} usefulness and fairness of a designated month dedicated {{to the history of}} one race. Criticisms include questions over whether it is appropriate to confine the celebration of Black history to one month, as opposed to integration of Black history into the mainstream education the rest of the year. Another criticism is that contrary to the original inspiration for <b>Black</b> <b>History</b> <b>Month,</b> which was a desire to redress the manner in which American schools failed to represent Black historical figures as anything other than slaves or colonial subjects, <b>Black</b> <b>History</b> <b>Month</b> reduces complex historical figures to overly simplified objects of hero worship.

25|$|Carter G.

From 1915 {{to the end of}} his life in 1950, Woodson edited the Journal of Negro History, an important venue for black and white scholars writing on matters relating to race at variance with pre-1950s understandings which excluded an appreciation of the contributions African-Americans made to the American past. <b>Black</b> <b>History</b> <b>month</b> grew out of Woodson’s initial celebration of Black History Week in 1926, established to widen public awareness of black American’s impact on U.S. history. Once seen as mere folklore, he is credited with formalizing the field of academic black history in America as a prominent historian trained at University of Chicago and Harvard University. His academic legacy includes the Association for the Study of Negro Life and History. An image of the stamp is available at Arago online at the link in the footnote.|$|E
