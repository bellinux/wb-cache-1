500|$|Eberhardt {{relocated}} to BÃ´ne {{with her mother}} in May 1897. They initially lived with David and his wife, who both disapproved {{of the amount of}} time Eberhardt and her mother spent with Arabs. Eberhardt and her mother did not like the Davids' attitude, which was typical of European settlers in the area, and later avoided the country's French residents, renting an Arabic-style house far from the European quarter. Eberhardt, aware that a Muslim woman could go out neither alone nor unveiled, dressed as a man in a <b>burnous</b> and turban. She expanded on her previous studies of Arabic, and became fluent within a few months. She and her mother converted to Islam. Mackworth writes that while Eberhardt was a [...] "natural mystic", her conversion appeared to be largely for practical reasons, as it gave her greater acceptance among the Arabs. Eberhardt found it easy to accept Islam; Trophimowsky had brought her up as a fatalist and Islam gave her fatalism a meaning. She embraced the Islamic concept that everything is predestined and the will of God. Although Eberhardt largely devoted herself to the Muslim way of life, she frequently partook of marijuana and alcohol and had many lovers. According to a friend, Eberhardt [...] "drank more than a Legionnaire, smoked more kief than a hashish addict and made love for the love of making love". She was considered heterosexual, though approached sexual intercourse with a traditionally masculine attitude, often treating it as impersonal. The reason for her Arabic companions' tolerance of her lifestyle has been debated by biographers. According to Mackworth, the [...] "delicate courtesy of the Arabs" [...] led them to treat Eberhardt as a man because she wished to live as one. Eberhardt's behaviour made her an outcast with the French settlers and the colonial administration, who watched her closely. Seeing no reason as to why a woman would choose the company of impoverished Arabs over her fellow Europeans, they eventually concluded she must be an English agent, sent to stir up resentment towards the French.|$|E
2500|$|Full-length mantles {{were worn}} to about 1836, when mantles became shorter. [...] A mantlet or shawl-mantlet was a shaped garment {{like a cross}} between a shawl and a mantle, with points hanging down in front. [...] The <b>burnous</b> was a three-quarter length mantle with a hood, named after the similar garment of Arabia. [...] The paletot was knee-length, with three cape-collars and slits for the arms, and the pardessus was half or three-quarter length coat with a defined waist and sleeves.|$|E
6000|$|... "Thanks; {{perhaps it}} would be wise," [...] said Gwendolen, rising, and {{submitting}} very gracefully to take the <b>burnous</b> on her shoulders.|$|E
60|$|And many {{a bearded}} Bedouin draws back his yellow-striped <b>burnous</b> To gaze upon the Titan thews of him who was thy paladin.|$|E
60|$|Presently {{the door}} opened, {{and a young}} man stood before them clothed in the rough camel-hair garment, or <b>burnous,</b> which is common in the East.|$|E
6000|$|... "Music, awake her, strike!" [...] said Paulina (Mrs. Davilow, who, {{by special}} entreaty, had consented {{to take the}} part in a white <b>burnous</b> and hood).|$|E
60|$|Sidi Cadua silently {{pointed to}} a ragged old <b>burnous</b> in a dark corner of the little cellar, under which a human form lay {{crouched}} up and motionless.|$|E
60|$|Both {{turned to}} see The Sheik {{standing}} a few paces from them. Abdul still held the picture in his hand. Now he thrust it within his <b>burnous.</b>|$|E
60|$|Lucien outran his father, {{and quickly}} overtook Bacri and another man, who was {{completely}} enveloped {{in the folds}} of a <b>burnous,</b> such as was then, and still is, worn by the Bedouin Arabs.|$|E
60|$|Flaggan's {{tone and}} actions were such as to instil {{a spirit of}} prompt unquestioning {{obedience}} into his friend, who instantly went off; {{and in a few}} seconds, (which seemed years to Ted), returned with his <b>burnous.</b>|$|E
60|$|This {{question}} called {{forth from}} the seaman {{the greater part of}} his recent history, in return for which Lucien, drawing forward the hood of his <b>burnous,</b> and resting his elbows on his knees, briefly related that of himself and his kindred.|$|E
60|$|While the seaman quickly but quietly {{divested}} {{himself of}} the boar-skin, {{and put on the}} <b>burnous</b> with the hood well drawn over his face, he related to his friend the incident at the gate, without, however, mentioning the true cause of his behaviour.|$|E
6000|$|How thy white <b>burnous</b> welit streaming, {{like the}} storm-rack o'er the sea, [...] When thou rodest in the vanward of the Moorish chivalry; [...] How thy razzia was a whirlwind, thy onset a simoom, [...] How thy sword-sweep was the lightning, dealing death from out the gloom! ...|$|E
60|$|Rose said nothing, {{but under}} cover of her <b>burnous</b> gave Archie's hand a {{sympathetic}} squeeze, for his arms were unfolded now, as if the strain was over, and one lay on his knee while with the other he wiped his hot forehead {{with an air of}} relief.|$|E
60|$|I {{became aware}} of the voices of people calling to one another in the village. A white-robed, hooded figure, some man in a bathing wrap, absurdly suggestive of an Arab in his <b>burnous,</b> came out from one of the nearer bungalows, and stood clear and still and shadowless in the glare.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{glad you}} did not strike a little harder," [...] said Godwin, [...] "or I should now be in two pieces and drowned in my own blood, instead of in that of this dead brute," [...] and he looked ruefully at his <b>burnous</b> and hauberk, that were soaked with gore.|$|E
60|$|Ted {{had thrown}} off his <b>burnous</b> and washed himself by this time, and now, {{clad in a}} {{borrowed}} pair of ducks and striped shirt, he stood by the gun commenting pleasantly on his experiences of Algerine life, and pointing out the various buildings and objects {{of interest in the}} city to his mates.|$|E
60|$|Rais Ali {{went with}} extreme reluctance, {{but there was}} no {{resisting}} the persuasive violence of Ted's powerful arm, nor the emphatic kick of the muscular leg with which he propelled his Moorish friend into the street. He did not wait, however, to remonstrate, but immediately drew forward the hood of his <b>burnous</b> and hurried away.|$|E
60|$|After {{removing}} as much {{as possible}} of the brown earth from his visage and limbs, the seaman drew the hood of his <b>burnous</b> well over his face, and--having assiduously studied the gait of Moors--strode with Oriental dignity into the outer court, or apartment, of the bath, followed his friend into an unoccupied corner and proceeded to undress.|$|E
60|$|On {{hearing the}} {{footsteps}} in pursuit, Bacri and his companion had commenced to run, but perceiving that only two men followed them, they turned {{and stood in}} an attitude of defence. He who wore the <b>burnous</b> flung back the hood, and, freeing his sword-arm from its folds, displayed to the astonished gaze of Lucien and Francisco the face and form of Mariano.|$|E
60|$|Rowland was silent; he did {{not care}} for the thrust; but he was profoundly mystified. Christina beckoned to her poodle, and the dog marched stiffly across to her. She gave a loving twist to his rose-colored top-knot, and bade him go and fetch her <b>burnous.</b> He obeyed, {{gathered}} it up in his teeth, and returned with great solemnity, dragging it along the floor.|$|E
60|$|Soon after dinner, {{and before}} she had got acquainted with half her new possessions, Dr. Alec {{proposed}} a drive, to carry round the first instalment of gifts to the aunts and cousins. Rose was quite ready to go, being anxious to try a certain soft <b>burnous</b> from the box, which not only possessed a most engaging little hood, but had funny tassels bobbing in all directions.|$|E
6000|$|A man who forgave {{this would}} have much Christian feeling, supposing he had {{intended}} to be agreeable to the young lady; but before he seized the <b>burnous</b> Mr. Lush had ceased to have that intention. Grandcourt quietly took the drapery from him, and Mr. Lush, with a slight bow, moved away. [...] "You had perhaps better put it on," [...] said Mr. Grandcourt, looking down on her without change of expression.|$|E
60|$|Meriem had traversed {{half the}} length of the village street when a score of white-robed Negroes and half-castes leaped out upon her from the dark {{interiors}} of surrounding huts. She turned to flee, but heavy hands seized her, and when she turned at last to plead with them her eyes fell upon the face of a tall, grim, old man glaring down upon her from beneath the folds of his <b>burnous.</b>|$|E
60|$|A {{volley of}} balls laid it low for ever, but the {{incident}} diverted attention {{for a moment}} from the Dey, and afforded him time {{to escape from the}} audience-chamber. Darting up a staircase, he gained the palace-roof, from which he sprang to a neighbouring roof and descended hastily to the street, throwing off some of his brilliant apparel as he ran, and snatching up a common <b>burnous</b> in which he enveloped himself.|$|E
60|$|Arraying {{himself in}} {{the skin of the}} wild boar, he {{attempted}} to cover himself with an Arab <b>burnous,</b> but, do what he could, he found it impossible to draw the hood over him {{in such a way as}} to conceal the head of the boar, and after his recent escapade with the guard, he felt that it was not safe to venture forth again uncovered. He therefore resolved to keep the boar's head exposed, and to venture boldly forth, despite the attention it was sure to attract.|$|E
60|$|GALLOPED up {{the winding}} steep of Canobia the Sheikh Said Djinblat, {{one of the}} most popular chieftains of the Druses; amiable and brave, {{trustworthy}} and soft-mannered. Four of his cousins rode after him: he came from his castle of Mooktara, which was not distant. He was in the prime of manhood, tall and lithe; enveloped in a <b>burnous</b> which shrouded his dark eye, his white turban, and his gold-embroidered vests; his long lance was couched in its rest, as he galloped up the winding steep of Canobia.|$|E
60|$|It was a cool, tranquil, dewless {{night when}} they at last straggled out, mere {{black and white}} patches in the colorless moonlight. The brilliancy of the flower-hued {{landscape}} was subdued under its passive, pale austerity; even the gray and gold of the second terrace seemed dulled and confused. At any other time Clarence might have lingered over this strange effect, but his eyes followed only a tall figure, in a long striped <b>burnous,</b> that moved gracefully beside the soutaned priest. As he approached, it turned towards him.|$|E
60|$|They {{had both}} stopped. He {{was still holding}} her {{sleeping}} hand. His arm had stolen around the <b>burnous</b> so softly that it followed the curves of her figure as lightly as a fold of the garment, and was presumably unfelt. Grief has its privileges, and suffering exonerates a questionable situation. In another moment her fair head MIGHT have dropped upon his shoulder. But an approaching voice uprose in the adjoining broad allee. It {{might have been the}} world speaking through the voice of the lawyer Sanderson.|$|E
6000|$|Grandcourt {{gave his}} arm in silent compliance, nodding over his {{shoulder}} to Deronda, and Gwendolen too only half turned to bow and say, [...] "Thanks." [...] The husband and wife left the gallery and paced the corridors in silence. When the door had closed on them in the boudoir, Grandcourt threw himself into a chair and said, with undertoned peremptoriness, [...] "Sit down." [...] She, already in the expectation of something unpleasant, had thrown off her <b>burnous</b> with nervous unconsciousness, and immediately obeyed. Turning his eyes toward her, he began-- ...|$|E
60|$|He {{stared at}} us through his horn spectacles, and, {{able to make}} nothing of our faces, let his glance fall to our {{garments}} which were as ragged as his own, and of much the same pattern. Indeed, they were those of Thibetan monks, including a kind of quilted petticoat and an outer vestment not unlike an Eastern <b>burnous.</b> We had adopted them because we had no others. Also they protected us from the rigours of the climate and from remark, had there been any to remark upon them.|$|E
6000|$|The Moor dashed out and {{hastened to}} his {{post on the}} ramparts, while Ted Flaggan, drawing his <b>burnous</b> well round him, made {{straight}} for the northern gate of the town, casting an uneasy glance at his now white legs, of which at least the ankles and beginning of the brawny calves were visible. We use the term [...] "white" [...] out of courtesy, and {{in reference to the}} distinct difference between the bold seaman's limbs and those of the brown-skinned Arabs. In reality they were of a very questionable neutral tint, and covered with a large quantity of hair.|$|E
6000|$|They swooped {{through the}} air, the white foam vanished, they were safe. No; the hind feet of Flame had missed their footing, they fell, they were lost. A struggle. How tight those arms clung about him. How close that face was pressed against his own. Lo! it was over. They were {{speeding}} down the hill, and alongside of the grey horse Flame raced the black horse Smoke. Wulf on its back, with eyes {{that seemed to}} be starting from his head, was shouting, [...] "A D'Arcy! A D'Arcy!" [...] and behind him, turban gone, and white <b>burnous</b> floating like a pennon on the air, the grim-visaged Arab, who also shouted.|$|E
60|$|A creep of two {{or three}} yards brought him into a cavern which was just high enough to admit of a man {{standing}} erect, and about eight or ten feet wide. At the farther extremity of it there was a small stone lamp, the dim light of which revealed the figure of stout Francisco Rimini sound asleep on a bundle of straw, wrapped negligently in his <b>burnous,</b> and with a stone for his pillow. Beside him stood an empty tin dish and a stone jar of the picturesque form peculiar to the inhabitants of the Atlas Mountains; the sword given to him by Bacri lay within reach of his half-open hand.|$|E
60|$|Brilliancy and splendor became Mrs. Snowdon; {{she enjoyed}} luxury, and her beauty made many things {{becoming}} {{which in a}} plainer woman {{would have been out}} of taste, and absurd. She had wrapped herself in a genuine Eastern <b>burnous</b> of scarlet, blue, and gold; the hood drawn over her head framed her fine face in rich hues, and the great gilt tassels shone against her rippling black hair. She wore it with grace, and the barbaric splendor of the garment became her well. The fresh air touched her cheeks with a delicate color; her usually gloomy eyes were brilliant now, and the smile that parted her lips was full of happiness.|$|E
6000|$|It {{was hardly}} a bow that Gwendolen gave--rather, it was the {{slightest}} forward sweep of the head away from the physiognomy that inclined itself toward her, and she immediately moved toward her seat, saying, [...] "I want to put on my burnous." [...] No sooner had she reached it, than Mr. Lush was there, and had the <b>burnous</b> in his hand: to annoy this supercilious young lady, he would incur the offense of forestalling Grandcourt; and, holding up the garment close to Gwendolen, he said, [...] "Pray, permit me?" [...] But she, wheeling away from {{him as if he}} had been a muddy hound, glided on to the ottoman, saying, [...] "No, thank you." ...|$|E
