30|$|The {{prevalence}} of supraspinatus tendon calcification causing shoulder pain {{has been reported}} to be as high as 6.8 %, mainly due to the supraspinatus tendon subacromial impingement syndrome with shoulder pain causing limited motion [1]. Radiology department diagnostic ultrasound evaluation of supraspinatus tendon calcification with subacromial impingement syndrome {{has been reported to}} be more specific (95 % to 96 %) than sensitive (71 % to 81 %) in adult patients, and supraspinatus tendon calcification with subacromial impingement syndrome diagnosed through ultrasonography has been reported in young athletes who perform overhead sports such as tennis, volleyball, and swimming [2 – 8]. Supraspinatus tendon calcification has also been reported to cause shoulder pain in children [9]. Undiagnosed and untreated supraspinatus tendon calcification with subacromial impingement syndrome can progress to severe forms of subacromial and subdeltoid bursitis, and even more serious surgical problems such as <b>bicipital</b> <b>tendonitis</b> with rupture of the long head of the biceps tendon, adhesive capsulitis, and rotator cuff tears [5 – 7]. Emergency physicians using point-of-care bedside ultrasonography to rapidly diagnose supraspinatus tendon calcification with subacromial impingement syndrome can expedite rapid musculoskeletal specialist referral to potentially improve patient outcomes.|$|E
40|$|Background A 22 -year old collegiate {{acrobatics}} and tumbling {{female athlete}} underwent a SLAP repair surgery {{on her right}} shoulder and received physical therapy for ten months before reproduction of similar symptoms developed. Differential Diagnosis Rotator cuff tear, <b>bicipital</b> <b>tendonitis,</b> shoulder impingement syndrome, multidirectional instability. Treatment The patient underwent two separate surgeries that were 10 months apart. First surgery was a repair of the anterior labrum and clean-up of the rotator cuff and bicep tendon due to fraying. Patient then was completing surgery when pain and sensations arose. A non-surgical approach was taken with three injections in the bicep tendon, shoulder capsule, and interior of the glenohumeral joint. Following that pain had not diminished at all, so surgery two took place where inflammation and additional fraying of the rotator cuff and biceps tendon was discovered again, cleaned up and returned to rehab. Uniqueness Injuries in the shoulder on extensive overhead athletes is common however anterior tears of the labrum are not as common as posterior tears. Additionally, with multiple surgeries on various anatomical features of the shoulder and no diagnosis as {{to the cause of}} continuous pain and sensations experienced by the athlete. Conclusions With little knowledge of the source of pain and symptoms. The goal of treatment and rehabilitation would now be to help the athlete now attain quality of life pain free, and with full range of motion...|$|E
