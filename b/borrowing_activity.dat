Money supply continued to increase even after the BOJ tightened its monetary policy and reached a peak in 1990, thereafter continuing to mark still double-digit growth until the fourth quarter. Money supply and credit dropped sharply by 1991, as bank lending began to drop due to a shift in bank lending attitude.|$|E

This paper uses micro-level data to decompose consumer debt dynamics by separating the actions of consumer debt increasers and decreasers, and then further decomposing movements into percentage and size margins among the increasers and decreasers. We view such a decomposition as informative for macroeconomic models featuring a central role for consumer debt. Using this framework, we show that variations in <b>borrowing</b> <b>activity</b> among the increasers explain four times as much of the total variation in consumer debt as variations among the decreasers who are shedding debt, whether through paydowns or defaults. We also provide micro-level evidence of a sharp decline in the percentage of increasers during the financial crisis that is qualitatively consistent with a binding zero lower bound on nominal interest rates, and evidence of a cycle in the average size of debt changes among the increasers that is related to rising collateral values pre-crisis coupled with additional financial frictions after the crisis...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{new evidence}} on the transmission of monetary policy in the euro area, assessing the impact of an unexpected increase of the short-term interest on the lending and <b>borrowing</b> <b>activity</b> of the different economic sectors. We exploit the information content of the flow-of-funds statistics, that provide the most appropriate framework to analyse the flowing of funds from one sector (the lender) to the other (the borrower). We proceed in two steps. First, we estimate a small VAR model for the euro area over the period 1991 Q 1 to 2009 Q 2. Then, we extend the benchmark VAR model in order to include the flow-of-funds series and analyse {{the response of the}} latter variables to a contractionary monetary policy shock. We find that the policy tightening is followed by a worsening of the budget deficit; firms cut on their demand for bank loans, partially replacing them with inter-company loans, and draw on their liquidity to try to offset the fall of revenues associated with the slowdown of economic activity; households reduce net borrowing and increase precautionary saving in the short run. Consistent with the bank lending channel of monetary policy at work, the interest rate hike is followed by a short-run deceleration of credit growth, mainly driven by the response of banks.

40|$|Enhancements to the BIS debt {{securities}} statistics 1 The BIS has revised its {{debt securities}} statistics {{to enhance their}} comparability across different markets. International issues have been redefined as debt securities issued outside the market where the borrower resides, and statistics combining international and domestic issues are being released for the first time. The revised statistics highlight the growing size and internationalisation of bond markets. JEL classification: F 34, G 15. The internationalisation of bond markets has made {{it increasingly difficult to}} distinguish between international and domestic debt securities. The BIS has thus revised its methodology for classifying international issues, focusing now on the market of issue instead of the targeted investor base. In addition, the BIS has harmonised classifications with those in the Handbook on Securities Statistics and released for the first time data on total debt securities. This special feature outlines the reasons for these changes and discusses their impact on the statistics. Conceptual challenges The BIS has since the mid- 1980 s published statistics on <b>borrowing</b> <b>activity</b> in debt capital markets. Coverage has improved steadily over the years, expanding from the initial focus on international markets to cover more than 50 domestic markets as well. At the same time, changes in financial markets have challenged the usefulness of the statistics for financial stability analysis. 2 In particular, the growing size and diversity of debt securities markets have heightened the importance of comparable data across markets. Furthermore, the growing openness of local markets to foreign investors and issuers has blurred the distinction between international and domestic debt securities...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1984 Borrowed funds {{finance a}} {{majority}} of equipment purchases and production costs in agriculture. The costs of borrowing, however, have not been stable nor has the determination of interest payments remained the same in recent years. As interest rates become increasingly volatile and variable rate loans replaced constant rate loans, the borrower has become more exposed to the risks and uncertainties derived from cost variances for borrowed funds. The establishment and development of financial futures during the l 970 s provided an avenue for interest rate hedging. A participant in the financial futures market could conceivably establish an acceptable interest rate or return on an investment {{in much the same}} sense that a commodity trader can use the commodity futures to protect a price position. The original intent of the financial futures, however, was to serve the needs of larger financial institutions. This thesis explores the feasibility of utilizing these futures for the targeting of acceptable loan cost rates and the protection of an established interest rate. This study is an attempt at determining the broader applicability of interest rate hedging in agriculture. Basis activity, forward timing abilities, and price change coordination capacities were explored for two futures contracts in short-term financial instruments. Basis activity was characterized in terms of variance and closing price ranges and provided an indication of a general applicability of financial futures for interest rate hedging. The results for the forward timing tests indicated limited predictive ability or price determination capacity for these futures. Tests of the price coordination function of these futures indicated a high degree of correlation between price changes in a futures and a related cash market. Ratios of optimal loan sizes per futures contract size were determined from this third analysis, and coupled with maturity considerations provided an indication of what were the minimum levels of <b>borrowing</b> <b>activity</b> necessary for a worthwhile futures hedging activity. Overall, there appeared to be consistent and advantageous hedging opportunities provided a participant met some relatively large minimum needs requirements. These futures contracts are best at serving the needs of very large producers, marketers or retailers with short-term borrowing needs. These futures are not a viable mechanism for interest rate hedging for {{a majority of}} the agricultural producers in the Pacific Northwest...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{uses the}} Flow of Funds {{accounts}} {{to assess the}} impact of a monetary policy shock on the <b>borrowing</b> and lending <b>activities</b> of different sectors of the economy. Our measures of contractionary monetary policy shocks have the following properties: (i) they are associated with a fall in nonborrowed reserves, total reserves, M 1, the Federal Reserves' holdings of government securities and a rise in the federal funds rate, (ii) they lead to persistent declines in real GNP, employment, retail sales and nonfinancial corporate profits as well as increases in unemployment and manufacturing inventories, (iii) they generate sharp, persistent declines in commodity prices and (iv) the GDP price deflator does not respond to them for roughly a year. After that the GDP price deflator declines. Our major findings regarding the <b>borrowing</b> <b>activities</b> of different sectors can be summarized as follows. First, following a contractionary shock to monetary policy, net funds raised by the business sector increases for roughly a year. Thereafter, as the recession induced by the policy shock gains momentum, net funds raised by the business sector begins to fall. This pattern is not captured by existing monetary business cycle models. Second, we cannot reject the view that households do not adjust their financial assets and liabilities for several quarters after a monetary shock. This is consistent with a key assumption of several recent monetary business cycle models. ...|$|R

The history of Australia and New Zealand as borrowers and debtors. ii. The rise and consolidation of the British 'colonial' market in the London capital market from the mid-nineteenth century to the late 1920 s. iii. The interaction between the market disciplines to which all borrowers were subject, and the opportunities and constraints created by membership of the British Empire.

To extend and revise the statistics of Australasian public debt in the period 1850 - 1950. 3. To create a database of Australasian overseas public loans during that period. The project's specific objectives were to complete three stages of research: 1. The consultation of archival and printed official sources in the United Kingdom and Australia relating to Australasian <b>borrowing</b> <b>activity</b> and relations with overseas creditors during nineteenth century. These either had not been available to, or were not consulted by, earlier historians. 2. The collection of quantitative data for revised statistics of Australian and New Zealand public debt between 1850 and 1950. 3. The collection of data for a database of Australasian overseas public loans during that period. Main Topics : The database contains a record of every Australasian government loan offered in London by public advertisement between the first such issue in 1857 and 1914. The governments concerned are those of the seven British colonies of New South Wales, New Zealand, Queensland, South Australia, Tasmania, Victoria and Western Australia, and the four New Zealand provincial administrations of Auckland, Canterbury, Otago and Wellington which also attempted to raise capital by this means. There are no records of loans floated by the Commonwealth of Australia (the federal government created in 1901) because its first issue in London did not occur until 1916. Purely conversion operations in which holders were offered the exchange of new securities for old have been excluded. The dataset provides information about the activities of a significant group of borrowers in the London capital market during its rise and prime as the dominant international financial centre in the world economy. It contains details about the characteristics of all publicly advertised loan issues; their marketing arrangements; and their results. It therefore can be used to examine the way in which Australasian borrowers approached the London market, the success with which they did this, and the ways in which both changed over time. It can be used for comparison with the activity of other borrowers. More broadly, it contributes to our understanding of development of the London capital market during the period. Please note: this study does not include information on named individuals and would therefore not be useful for personal family history research. <br...|$|E

The collection of quantitative data for revised statistics of Australian and New Zealand public debt between 1850 and 1950. 3. 	The collection of data for a database of Australasian overseas public loans during that period. Main Topics : This dataset publishes new statistics of Australian colonial and state debt, and of capital raised by all Australian public borrowers (including corporation) in London, until 1914. Current historical statistics do not distinguish between stocks of debt held locally or abroad. Moreover, the time series of new capital subscribed or received in London prepared by Butlin, Simon, Hall, and others often aggregate all colonial public borrowing, have different terminal dates, and are inconsistent with each other. The new statistics remedy these deficiencies. Three types of table are presented. The first disaggregates, and where necessary corrects, the official annual statistics of stocks of outstanding debt of each Australian colony, distinguishing between the place of original sale, long and short-term securities, and gross new issues (i. e. the nominal value of all securities sold) and repayments. The second shows the stocks of long and short term debt held in Australia and the United Kingdom. These are taken principally from Statistical Registers, and include debt (e. g. stock issued by Savings Banks) omitted from the official statistics in the early years. The final type of table summarises the principal annual flows in London of capital created (including as a result of conversions and exchanges), subscribed, received, and amortized for each colonial government and for public corporations as a single group. It excludes flows arising from remittance of securities originally sold in the colonies, but includes transfers from London to colonial registers and purchases from sinking funds where they are known. The data is presented in 18 spreadsheets and are of seven separate borrowers: New South Wales (3 spreadsheets), Victoria (3), Queensland (3), South Australia (3), Tasmania (2), Western Australia (2), and public corporations (1).

30|$|It {{is indeed}} {{possible}} to make a similar line of argument between formal and informal jobs. The study that echoes this research most closely {{is the work of}} Catão et al. (2009), which explores the link between firm credit and formalization in Brazil. The study focuses on firms’ decisions to move toward formalization, asserting that firms must not only formally register to borrow credit, but also comply with considerable requirements regarding their balance sheets, income flows and tax liabilities. Since the strengthening of communications and data-gathering technologies permits governments to engage in monitoring more effectively and limit illegal <b>borrowing</b> <b>activities,</b> the study investigates the empirical relevance of the credit channel as a driving force of formality. Using the financial dependence methodology of Catão et al. (2009), Rajan and Zingales (1998) test whether the economic sectors that are more dependent on domestic bank credit are the site of quicker formal employment expansion as the terms of access to bank credit improve. The study shows that as the aggregate supply of formal bank credit increases, the formalization rate accelerates in the sectors that are more dependent on bank credits.|$|R
40|$|Capital {{regulations}} set on {{an international}} level can {{play a significant role}} in ensuring that internationally active banks have adequate level and structure of capital. The benchmark framework, known as Basle capital adequacy framework, specifically addresses this issue with respect to the internationally active banks. It provides quantitative rules on the desired level of economic capital requirements that each bank should aim at ensuring stable and efficient financial position. These rules affect directly the bank´s behaviour, mostly with respect to lending and <b>borrowing</b> <b>activities.</b> However, the concept also influences agents whose core businesses are not solely in the financial area. In general, these rules affect the overall macroeconomy, mostly through the channel of lending. This paper attempts to focus on the two-level approach of the capital rules analysing both approaches in a single framework using the empirical findings of a small and highly volatile economy, such as Iceland. The conclusions, however, are of equal importance in a cross-country context. On the first level, the analysis is concerned with the CAD on a macroeconomic level, where it is shown that higher macroeconomic volatility should add to the minimum capital requiremen...|$|R
30|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new scheme (or algorithm) {{in order to}} {{optimize}} the frequency assignment and to enable the reuse of same frequency by sufficiently distant cell. This is to maximize the number of communication (calls) but with {{a limited number of}} frequencies. The proposed scheme is called dual band frequency channel borrowing (DBFCB). In Simple Borrowing, channel assignments are borrowed from the adjacent cells and are returned to that cell after it has become free. When a new call initiates and reaches to a cell, and if currently, all the permanent channels allocated to the cell are busy, then channels are borrowed from adjacent cell provided the channels are available (in adjacent cell) and minimum reusable distance constraint is met. In Channel Borrowing algorithms, a database is maintained for the record of channels as per their status either currently in use, borrowed or free. Mobile switch center (MSC), taking care of the channel <b>borrowing</b> <b>activities,</b> runs the channel borrowing procedure, so that channels available are borrowed from the cell having relatively more free channels. Channel borrowing is done under minimum reusable distance constraint. The performance may be reduced for ongoing connections, due to increase of overheads in the base stations of the cellular Mobile system [15].|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, we {{consider}} a risk model which incorporates multiple threshold levels characterizing an insurer's minimal capital requirement, dividend paying situations, and external financial activities. Our model {{is based on}} discrete monetary and time units, and the main quantities of interest are the finite-time ruin probabilities and the expected total discounted dividends paid prior to ruin. We mainly focus {{on the development of}} computational methods to attain these quantities of interest. One of the popular methods in the current literature used for studying such problems involves a recursive approach which incorporates appropriate conditioning arguments on the claim times and sizes, and we implement this procedure as well. Furthermore, ruin can occur due to both a claim as well as interest expense accumulation as our model allows the insurer to borrow money from an external fund. In this thesis, {{we consider}} only non-stochastic interest rates for both lending and <b>borrowing</b> <b>activities.</b> After constructing appropriate recursive formulae for the finite-time ruin probabilities and the expected total discounted dividends paid prior to ruin, we investigate various numerical examples and make some observations concerning the impact our threshold levels have on finite-time ruin probabilities and expected total discounted dividends paid prior to ruin...|$|R
40|$|Archaeological {{investigations}} at the Sunrise Ridge Borrow Pit site (45 PI 408) in Mount Rainier National Park {{continue to}} yield information about precontact land {{use in the}} upland environment of the Cascade Mountain Range. The National Park Service (NPS) contracted Central Washington University (CWU) to conduct archaeological investigations at 45 PI 408 as part of mitigation for past damage to the site from historic gravel <b>borrowing</b> <b>activities.</b> Initial testing at 45 PI 408 was conducted between 1997 and 2001 {{in order to establish}} site boundaries. Excavations were conducted by CWU Archaeological Field School students under the guidance of Professor Patrick McCutcheon between 2011 and 2013 in an effort to characterize the site. A total of 19 1 x 1 meter units were excavated yielding thousands of artifacts and identifying several intact features. Analyses of the recovered materials from both testing and excavation are currently underway at CWU. These analyses include thermoluminescence dating of fire modified rock, radiocarbon dating of faunal remains and charcoal, macrobotanical analysis, analysis of the chipped stone tool assemblage, and obsidian source-to-site analysis. These analyses will refine the age of the site and allow inferences about changes in past lithic technologies through time, trade networks, and subsistence patterns. An excavation report detailing the findings of these analyses will be completed by Professor McCutcheon with the assistance of CWU students and submitted to the NPS...|$|R
40|$|This study {{sought to}} {{establish}} how various credit risk management practices affect performance of commercial banks in Nyeri County in Kenya. Even though commercial banks face several types of risks, credit risk stands out as the most severe. Credit risk {{is the possibility of}} loss to the lender on non-performing loans. Financial practice as well as theory provides a scientific process of credit risk management in financial institutions. However, lenders still face loan default and consequently this {{study sought to}} find out how those practices affect the performance of commercial banks in Nyeri County, Kenya. A census study was conducted where a population of 86 respondents was targeted comprising of branch managers, credit managers and credit officers. The findings of the study were that all commercial banks had a well written credit policy which is strictly and consistently followed. Only few commercial banks conduct a quantitative credit scoring model. In all banks, initial screening is done by credit officer and approval done at different levels depending on the amount. Majority of the banks check post <b>borrowing</b> <b>activities</b> of the borrower. In conclusion, credit risk management has an effect on loan performance amongst commercial banks. Thus, managers should evaluate more accurately the ability to pay back of a customer since the better the screening the better the performance of commercial banks...|$|R
