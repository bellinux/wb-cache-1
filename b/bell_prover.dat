5000|$|A <b>bell</b> <b>prover</b> (commonly {{referred}} to in the industry as a [...] "bell") consists of a vertical inner tank surrounded by an outer shell. A space between the inner tank and outer shell is filled with a sealing liquid, usually oil. An inverted tank, called the bell, is placed over the inner tank. The liquid provides an air-tight seal. Bell provers are typically counterweighted to provide positive pressure through a hose and valve connected to a meter. Sometimes rollers or guides are installed on the moving part of the bell which allows for smooth linear movement without the potential for immeasurable pressure differentials caused by the bell rocking back or forth.|$|E
50|$|The {{invention}} of {{programmable logic controllers}} (PLC) allowed gas meter repair facilities to automate most of the manual bell prover's process and calculations. Instead of manually raising and lowering the <b>bell</b> <b>prover,</b> solenoid valves connected to a PLC control air flows through the meter. Temperature, pressure, and humidity sensors {{can be used to}} feed data into an automated bell PLC, and calculations for meter proofs can be handled by a computer or electronic device programmed for such a purpose. In the early 1990s, the PLC was replaced by PACs (Programmable Automated Controls) and modern computer systems. Sensors to read the index of a meter were added to further automate the process, removing much of the human error associated with manual bell provers.|$|E

The analysis of key factors influencing the measurement accuracy and realization of gas flowrate and assessment {{of the impact of}} pressure fluctuations under gauging tank space of metrological plant of <b>bell</b> <b>prover</b> type was conducted. The practical solutions for accuracy increasing of <b>bell</b> <b>prover</b> by ensuring of pressure quasi stability under gauging tank by using servo drive for gauging tank control movement has been suggested. It is minimizes the transient process duration and allows optimal using of interior volume for realization of volume and volumetric gas flowrate. ?????? ?????????? ?? ???????? ????????????? ???????????????? ??????????? ??????? ????????? ?????? ? ????????? ??????? ????, ? ?????? ??????????? ????????? ?????????. ???????? ?????? ???????? ????????, ???????? ?? ???????? ????????? ? ??????????????? ??????? ????, ? ??????? ??????? ?????????? ???????? ? ???????????? ??? ???????? ??????????????? ????????? ???????????? ??????. ?????????? ???????????? ??????? ????????? ???????? ??????????? ??????????????? ????????? ????? ??????????? ????????????????? ???????? ??? ???????? ????? ?????????? ???????????? ??? ?????????? ????????? ????????. ??? ???????????? ????????????????? ??????????? ???????? ? ????????? ??????? ???????????? ????????????? ??????????? ?????? ??????? ??? ??????????????? ?????? ? ????????? ??????? ????...|$|E
50|$|Since {{the early}} 1900s, <b>bell</b> <b>provers</b> {{have been the}} most common {{reference}} standard used in gas meter proving, and has provided standards for the gas industry that is unfortunately susceptible to a myriad of immeasurable uncertainties.|$|R
50|$|Uncertainties {{commonly}} experienced, {{and possibly}} unaccounted for within a test when using <b>bell</b> <b>provers</b> {{can lead to}} incorrect proofs, by which an operator may adjust a gas meter incorrectly. Temperature inconsistencies between the bell air, meter and connecting hoses can account for most meter proof inaccuracies. Other factors may be mechanical such as stuck or sticky bell rollers or guides, loose piping connections or valves, {{a dent in the}} test area of the bell, incorrect counterweights, and human errors in the operation or calculations.|$|R

The focus of this research was to examine a novel method for calibrating natural gas flow meters. This new method can accommodate very large flow rates and it avoids common problems associated with current meter proving techniques. In this method, the amount of gas accumulated in a vessel of fixed. volume is determined by measuring the change in capacitance of the vessel with respect to time. Because the accumulator has a fixed volume, the problems inherent with the mechanical motions involved in volumetric <b>provers</b> such as <b>bell</b> <b>provers</b> and piston provers are eliminated. Accurate measurements can also be made in larger vessels than would be feasible for gravimetric provers, especially for in situ calibrations...|$|R
40|$|Abstract âˆ’ Bell provers {{have a wide}} usage for {{calibrating}} {{various types}} of flow meters by timing the bell ascendance. They are often used as a working standard. Known area of the bell along with measured displacement of the bell produce, with some measurement uncertainty, volume generated by the bell. This volume with measured time gives the flow generated by the bell. The temperature and {{the pressure of the}} gas in the bell are not constant. Further more the temperature and the pressure at the flow meter are not equal to those in the bell due to losses in pipes. Because of that it is imperative to measure all of them. When those measurands are stored in database entire measurement can be analyzed at referent conditions. In order to automate measurements with the <b>bell</b> <b>prover,</b> to improve the measurement uncertainty of the results, and to obtain some additional quantities like velocity and acceleration of the bell, computerized measurement equipment has been installed on the <b>bell</b> <b>prover...</b>|$|E
