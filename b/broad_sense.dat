5|$|Birds {{have been}} a part of human culture, in the <b>broad</b> <b>sense</b> of social behaviour, customs and {{practices}} including but not limited to expressive forms such as art, music and religion, for thousands of years. Human society makes use of birds both economically, including for food, and non-economically, for sport, pleasure, and inspiration.|$|E
5|$|Hymenoptera in {{the form}} of Symphyta (Xyelidae) first {{appeared}} in the fossil record in the Lower Triassic. Apocrita, wasps in the <b>broad</b> <b>sense,</b> appeared in the Jurassic, and had diversified into many of the extant superfamilies by the Cretaceous; they appear to have evolved from the Symphyta. Fig wasps with modern anatomical features first appeared in the Lower Cretaceous of the Crato Formation in Brazil, some 65 million years before the first fig trees.|$|E
5|$|The Internet is of {{interest}} to sociologists in various ways; most practically {{as a tool for}} research and as a discussion platform. The sociology of the Internet in the <b>broad</b> <b>sense</b> regards the analysis of online communities (e.g. newsgroups, social networking sites) and virtual worlds, thus there is often overlap with community sociology. Online communities may be studied statistically through network analysis or interpreted qualitatively through virtual ethnography. Moreover, organizational change is catalysed through new media, thereby influencing social change at-large, perhaps forming the framework for a transformation from an industrial to an informational society. One notable text is Manuel Castells' The Internet Galaxy—the title of which forms an inter-textual reference to Marshall McLuhan's The Gutenberg Galaxy. Closely related to the sociology of the Internet, is digital sociology, which expands the scope of study to address not only the internet but also the impact of the other digital media and devices that have emerged since {{the first decade of the}} twenty-first century.|$|E

30|$|Solving {{a dispute}} {{in a narrow}} sense means that a dispute is resolved. Note that this {{emphasizes}} the outcome. In a <b>broader</b> <b>sense,</b> however, solving a dispute includes handling and treating disputes, which {{can be thought of}} as dispute management (Merry 1979; Zhu 2011). In this paper, solving a dispute refers to this <b>broader</b> <b>sense.</b>|$|R

25|$|Where a {{chemical}} complex has similar demands for both benzene and xylene, then toluene disproportionation (TDP) {{may be an}} attractive alternative to the toluene hydrodealkylation. In the <b>broad</b> <b>sense,</b> 2 toluene molecules are reacted and the methyl groups rearranged from one toluene molecule to the other, yielding one benzene molecule and one xylene molecule.|$|E
25|$|Touch in {{this context}} refers to the {{perception}} of detailed, localized tactile information, such as two-point discrimination (the difference between touching one point and two closely spaced points) or the difference between coarse, medium or fine sandpaper. People without touch-position perception can feel the surface of their bodies and perceive touch in a <b>broad</b> <b>sense,</b> but they lack perceptual detail.|$|E
25|$|With {{the passage}} of time {{following}} the publication of Bentham's arrangement, D.ser. Niveae was gradually abandoned. As the flowers and fruit are highly similar across all species in the series, it is difficult to distinguish individual species. For this reason the name Dryandra nivea began to be used in a <b>broad</b> <b>sense,</b> to refer to the entire group, and the other species names fell into disuse.|$|E

25|$|Test, in this sense, {{can refer}} to any medical test (but usually {{in the sense of}} {{diagnostic}} tests), and in a <b>broad</b> <b>sense</b> also including questions and even assumptions (such as assuming that the target individual is a female or male).

25|$|In the <b>broad</b> <b>sense,</b> most {{chemotherapeutic}} drugs work by impairing mitosis (cell division), effectively targeting fast-dividing cells. As {{these drugs}} cause damage to cells, they are termed cytotoxic. They prevent mitosis by various mechanisms including damaging DNA and inhibition of the cellular machinery involved in cell division. One theory {{as to why}} these drugs kill cancer cells is that they induce a programmed form of cell death known as apoptosis.|$|E

It supervises the provinces, municipalities, and intercommunal utility companies.|$|E

In urban areas an additional 27% of the population used shared latrines. In rural areas, open defecation {{was estimated to be}} still practised by 12% of the population. The 2015 report by the Water and Sanitation Regulatory Board did not include any figures on access to sanitation in the <b>broad</b> <b>sense,</b> but only an estimate of access to sewerage in urban areas, which was estimated at 16%.|$|E
