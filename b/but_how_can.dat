500|$|The press {{were given}} {{advanced}} {{copies of the}} episode. Matthew Weiner pronounced himself shocked by what he considered spoilers in the review. Weiner criticized the episode's review by Alessandra Stanley of the New York Times, expressing that the publication revealed too much information. [...] He continued: [...] "I'm kind of powerless. It's the bargain you make. I wanted to have press, and {{it was nice to}} get that kind of space with those pictures. The alternative is not to share these things with the press any more – <b>but</b> <b>how</b> <b>can</b> you expect journalists to write about the show if you don’t? It was all very disappointing to me.|$|E
500|$|Much of {{the early}} {{criticism}} of the U.S. Highway System focused on the choice of numbers to designate the highways, rather than names. [...] Some thought a numbered highway system to be cold [...] compared to the more colorful names and historic value of the auto trail systems. [...] The New York Times wrote, [...] "The traveler may shed tears as he drives the Lincoln Highway or dream dreams as he speeds over the Jefferson Highway, <b>but</b> <b>how</b> <b>can</b> he get a 'kick' out of 46, 55 or 33 or 21?" [...] (A popular song later promised, [...] "Get your kicks on Route 66!") The writer Ernest McGaffey was quoted as saying, [...] "Logarithms will {{take the place of}} legends, and 'hokum' for history." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{the final}} scene of Act I, Nellie rejects Emile because of his part-Polynesian children. [...] In so doing, Nellie fails {{to live up to}} the American ideal that [...] "all men are created equal", which Emile had earlier affirmed. This scene was also toned down by Hammerstein; in early drafts, Nellie, {{initially}} unable to force out a word to describe Emile's first wife, after he supplies the word [...] "Polynesian", responds with [...] "colored". [...] This pronouncement, which makes Nellie less sympathetic as a character, was restored for the 2008 Lincoln Center production. [...] As Frank Rich of The New York Times commented, [...] "it's upsetting because Nellie isn't some cracker stereotype– she's lovable... <b>But</b> <b>how</b> <b>can</b> we love a racist?" [...] Most argues that even Emile is tainted by racism, as his lifestyle is dependent on the maintenance of a system whereby he benefits from underpaid native labor– Bloody Mary is able to attract workers to make grass skirts for sale to GIs because, as she puts it, [...] "French planters stingy bastards!" ...|$|E
500|$|Casting Crowns' lead vocalist, Mark Hall, {{commented on}} the lyrical content of the song, stating that: [...] "For believers, in context with our other songs, the {{messages}} are that God wants to use you, He wants you to grow and He wants {{you to have a}} purpose". Hall elaborated that: [...] "There are a trilogy of songs and messages that go together on the album. , “Glorious Day,” and “To Know You.” [...] reminds me to be more intentional about what I do. I {{may not be able to}} get on a plane and fly to China and give out Bibles and preach the gospel, <b>but</b> <b>how</b> <b>can</b> I witness to my co-workers and my friends and my family." [...] The portion of the chorus that says [...] "like voices in the wilderness we're crying out" [...] is a reference to John the Baptist; Hall said that one of his favorite characters in the New Testament was John the Baptist, and commented that [...] "he [...] was so black and white. This is wrong, and this is right. And he was speaking into a grey world, saying black and white things, and it cost him his life". He elaborated on that, commenting that: [...] "Until the whole world hears are the lines and the things that John the Baptist said into a culture that did not want to hear it. And we've got to be in a place in our walk with Jesus that he's filled us to where we step into something that's unpopular and we can speak the truth, but that we can also speak it in love. We've got to live in such a way that I have the purpose that John had".|$|E
500|$|A love {{triangle}} between Natasha, Andrew and Summer is formed. Natasha's {{feelings for}} Andrew grow when they organise a party together, but she notices Andrew's concern for Summer when she collapses and warns Summer away from Andrew. Natasha later asks Andrew if he loves her, {{but he does}} not reply. In December 2010, Summer and Andrew give into their feelings for each other and have sex. Novakovic said Natasha would be [...] "devastated" [...] if she knew what had happened and that she would not let Andrew and Summer off lightly. Andrew tells Natasha {{that he is going to}} business meeting, but he meets Summer instead. While they are together in Summer's house, a fire breaks out. Natasha sees the smoke and calls her father and the emergency services before entering the house to rescue Summer, unaware Andrew is also there. Novakovic explained Natasha's ordeal: [...] "Natasha is pulled from the fire by her dad, Michael. Andrew and Summer are rescued separately, and Natasha has no idea of the reason why Andrew was in the house - he was cheating on her with Summer!" [...] After the rescue, Natasha has to come to terms with the fact she will be scarred from a burn she sustains on her neck. Novakovic said that it is a [...] "big deal" [...] for Natasha, as she aspires to be a model and this could ruin her chances. Novakovic also opines that Summer wants nothing more than to be with Andrew, <b>but</b> <b>how</b> <b>can</b> she take him when Natasha tried to save her? Novakovic believed Natasha was blasé to their feelings adding [...] "Deep down, I think Natasha knows that there's something going on, but she doesn't want to admit it to herself. But sooner or later, I reckon she'll have to face the inevitable." ...|$|E

For example, Ted Sider is the same today as he was when he was born—he just changed. <b>But</b> <b>how</b> <b>can</b> this be if many parts of Ted today did not exist when Ted was just born?

2500|$|The {{claim in}} the [...] "Statement of 31 Republicans" [...] that a Harding victory meant {{brighter}} {{prospects for the}} League of Nations was badly received by some League proponents. Lowell came in for attack precisely because of his earlier claims to independence. One Harvard graduate, who had just formed the New Hampshire committee {{to raise funds for}} the University's endowment, wrote: [...] "One can understand a Republican partisan and respect him. One can understand a Democratic partisan and respect him. <b>But</b> <b>how</b> <b>can</b> any man explain this recent act of yours consistently with the dignity, gravity, high character and devotion to truth which should attach to the President of Harvard College?" [...] Charged with sacrificing his principles to expediency, Lowell admitted he had but provided his own definition of expediency: [...] "striving to find the most effective way of achieving a principle—refusing to beat one's head uselessly against a wall to attack an entrenchment in face instead if taking it by a turning movement." ...|$|E

2500|$|Ardent anti-imperialist American war {{correspondent}} Thomas Franklin Fairfax Millard (born 1868; died 8 September 1942 in Seattle, Washington), considered [...] "the {{founding father}} of American journalism in China" [...] who later [...] "probably {{has had a}} greater influence on contemporary newspaper journalism than any other American journalist in China,” then a special correspondent for the New York Herald in China since 1900, who also had his reports published in Britain's [...] The Daily Mail, and American magazines including Scribner's Magazine and The Cosmopolitan, and the English-language Kobe Weekly Chronicle of Japan, criticised Ament for his actions on the military expedition to San Ho in September 1900. Millard charged in Scribner's Magazine that the allied insistence on revenge was criminal. [...] "Seized with a vertigo of indiscriminating vengeance, the powers are trifling with {{the peace of the}} world. Events such as the months of September, October and November brought to China have carried war back to the Dark Ages, and will leave a taint in the moral atmosphere of the world for a generation to come". Upon his return to the United States in January 1901, in response to a letter urging the editor of The New York Times to retract his editorial of 26 January 1901 on [...] "Loot and Indemnity in China", Millard wrote I hope you will not retract your statements. They are well within the facts, as I know from personal observation. It may serve no good purpose to stir this matter up, <b>but</b> <b>how</b> <b>can</b> Christianity reform its mission work as long as it persists in its present hallucinations." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Indian cricket team, humiliated in {{all forms}} {{of the game in}} the tour, was the subject of ridicule from the media and former cricketers. The Australian wrote under the {{headline}} [...] "India's pillars of strength reduced to useless rubble" [...] Dhoni is not the only shaky pillar of what only eight months ago was the number one cricket nation in the world. VVS Laxman, once the scourge of Australian bowlers, is being flayed himself at home after scores of 2,1, 2, 66, 31 and 0. Virender Sehwag, who warmed up for this series by scoring the fastest double century in One-Day International history, also is trending south faster than Scott and Amundsen, having followed up his whirlwind 67 in Melbourne with innings of 7, 30, 4, 0 and 10. Worst of all, Dhoni has failed with the bat. The Indian captain is no thunderer at the best of times – neither is coach Duncan Fletcher, which may be part of the problem – <b>but</b> <b>how</b> <b>can</b> he demand more of his batsmen when he has nowhere to hide behind scores of 6, 23, 57no, 2, 12 and 2? India has not had a single century-maker in the past three Tests, The Daily Telegraph said that India's performance was [...] "so bad that the first question that came Michael Clarke's way at the press conference was 'did it feel as if you were playing Bangladesh?'". The newspaper also played up Dhoni's one-match ban due to the Indian team's slow over-rate in the third Test. Under the headline 'Dhoni dumped from Adelaide Test', the newspaper wrote, [...] "India's shambolic tour of Australia plunged into unprecedented disarray when their captain MS Dhoni was sensationally banned from playing in the final Test due to slow over rates". The Herald Sun wrote about how Australia built up a team after the Ashes humiliation last year while sarcastically mentioning the visiting players skipping practice sessions in the tour.As painful as it was, getting flogged in last year's Ashes may be remembered as the recession Australia had to have. Nothing is being taken for granted in Australian cricket any more. The new coaching unit is working well under head coach Mickey Arthur and Australia has worked hard to freshen up every aspect of its game. India, by contrast, just lobs along, its players pocketing millions each year and too spoilt to make major sacrifices. It's appropriate that many Indian players {{spent a lot of time}} last week sitting under trees at training, because their entire Test match game is being left in the shade.|$|E
