50|$|The {{making of}} coke in Connellsville {{had been a}} big part of P&LE traffic, but by the early 20th century it had lessened. The {{development}} of <b>by-products</b> <b>distillation</b> processing of coke had moved to the Pittsburgh area. The P&LE then extended up the Monongahela River to Brownsville, Pennsylvania in 1901. The Pennsylvania Railroad at the same time had extended to Brownsville. Both the PRR and the P&LE had plans to extend even further up the river into West Virginia coke fields. Most likely due to the South Penn, after they decided to work together by using the Monongahela Railway. The Monongahela Railway then was extended south to Martin, Pennsylvania reaching the Kondike Coke fields. Later in 1915 it reached Fairmont, West Virginia.|$|R

50|$|The second {{method for}} the {{synthesis}} of 2-methylundecanal begins with the conversion of undecanal to 2-methyleneundecanal by allowing it to react with formaldehyde {{in the presence of}} base. The 2-methyleneundecanal is then hydrogenated to give 2-methylundecanal. The required undecanal is generated from 1-decene by hydroformylation. The resulting solution is over 50% 2-methyleneundecanal. The double bond of this compound is hydrogenated and the resulting 2-methylundecanal is separated from the <b>by-products</b> using fractional <b>distillation.</b>|$|R
40|$|Creosote is a <b>by-product</b> {{of crude}} <b>distillation.</b> These wastes are formulated, by {{dilution}} in mineral oil and with addition of phenols, such as trichlorophenol and pentachlorophenol. Creosote is used mainly for painting railway sleepers, with biodegradation inhibition purposes. Also, creosote is employed for painting wood, {{which is in}} contact with water in coasts, lagoons, and rivers and many other applications. Creosote, as a <b>distillation</b> <b>by-product,</b> contains a very high complex mixture of hydrocarbons and metals. It {{has been reported that}} polyaromathic hydrocarbons PAHs, phenols and many metals are present in high concentrations in those fluids, though there is a big lack of data in literature. In this work, three creosotes (dark brown, light brown and a Fluka Chemical product) were characterized in terms of the 16 PAHs considered by USEPA as priority pollutants, total phenols content, as well as 10 metals analysed by Inductive Plasma. It was found that industrial and analysis grade creosotes resulted very different. Dark brown creosote has 215, 054 mg/kg of total PAHs, while light brown creosote, only 23, 690 mg/kg (one tenth). Strangely, the analysis grade product showed no PAHs presence. Regarding phenols, dark brown, light brown and analytical grade products showed contents of 1, 205, 2, 777 and 348, 215 mg/kg, respectively. Many metals were found in all the samples. These data are very important for environmental forensic applications. It is very important to underline that from the 16 PAHs considered by USEPA, 5 are considered as carcinogenic. Besides, the presence of phenols and metals, make creosote a very harmful product...|$|R
30|$|D 24 {{devices were}} {{demonstrated}} in the analysis and detection of mineral oil in increasingly low dilution factors. Mineral oil is a <b>by-product</b> of the <b>distillation</b> of petroleum to produce gasoline. It contains light mixtures of higher alkanes with the paraffins of this mineral oil ranging from about C 18 to C 40 : it roughly corresponds to the composition of base oil for manufacturing lubricating or hydraulic oils [26]. In a recent commentary [26], it is recommended to reduce the exposition to mineral oil to levels lower than ~[*] 50  mg/kg, i.e., 50  ppm. Analysis of mineral oil (m.o.) and related products is therefore of interest in environmental pollution and food safety. m.o was examined using Raman spectroscopy following the methods described in the previous BSA analysis.|$|R
40|$|Topic {{distillation}} is {{the process}} of finding authoritative Web pages and comprehensive “hubs ” which reciprocally endorse each other and are relevant to a given query. Hyperlinkbased topic distillation has been traditionally applied to a macroscopic Web model where documents are nodes in a directed graph and hyperlinks are edges. Macroscopic models miss valuable clues such as banners, navigation panels, and template-based inclusions, which are embedded in HTML pages using markup tags. Consequently, results of macroscopic distillation algorithms have been deteriorating in quality as Web pages are becoming more complex. We propose a uniform fine-grained model for the Web in which pages are represented by their tag trees (also called their Document Object Models or DOMs) and these DOM trees are interconnected by ordinary hyperlinks. Surprisingly, macroscopic distillation algorithms do not work in the finegrained scenario. We present a new algorithm suitable for the fine-grained model. It can dis-aggregate hubs into coherent regions by segmenting their DOM trees. Mutual endorsement between hubs and authorities involve these regions, rather than single nodes representing complete hubs. Anecdotes and measurements using a 28 -query, 366000 -document benchmark suite, used in earlier topic distillation research, reveal two benefits from the new algorithm: distillation quality improves, and a <b>by-product</b> of <b>distillation</b> is the ability to extract relevant snippets from hubs which are only partially relevant to the query...|$|R
40|$|Fusel oil is a <b>by-product</b> of a <b>distillation</b> of {{ethyl alcohol}} from {{fermentation}} of molasses, contains mainly C 3 -C 5 alcohols. This fusel oil {{can be used}} as a solvent, antifoaming agent, or as a fuel.

Amyl alcohols are the main components of fusel oil which amount to 30 - 50 % and have wide applications in many kinds of industries. These include pharmaceutical and food industries, where it is used as a raw material for producing flavours. The aim of this study is to design a distillation column for recovery of amyl, butyl, propyl and ethyl alcohol from fusel oil. A hand calculation was first made and generalized through HYSYS simulation program. The calculation results were compared with that of HYSYS program which has given satisfied results.

40|$|Fusel oil is a <b>by-product</b> of the <b>distillation</b> of {{ethyl alcohol}} from the {{fermentation}} of molasses and contains mainly C 3 -C 5 alcohols. Acetic acid and butyric acid esters of its major alcohol components have economic value as chemicals for {{flavor and fragrance}} manufacturing. This study presents some data regarding the uncatalyzed esterication of fusel oil with acetic acid, propionic acid and butyric acid. The reactions were carried out at two temperatures, i. e., 45 C and under the reflux conditions (80 − 85 C). The composition of raw fusel oil and the reaction mixtures were determined by gas chromatography. The reaction rate constants for the formation the esters were estimated based on the concentration-time relationships. The results indicated that esterication rate of fusel oil is very slow and, under identical conditions, the rate depends on the reacting acid. The formation rates of butyric acid esters {{were found to be}} higher than the those of acetic acid and propionic acid esters. After approximately 6. 5 hours of the reaction at 45 C, the estimated maximum production yield of the mixed acedic acid esters was around 19 %, propionic acid esters 24 % and butyric acid esters 35 %. Increasing reaction temperature increased the conversion ratios...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{objective}} of this work was to evaluate the antioxidant properties of Lavandula latifolia waste obtained after essential oil distillation. Samples of 12 wild populations of the Lavandula genus collected between 2009 and 2010 were hydrodistilled and their by-products were analyzed using the Folin–Ciocalteu, free radical scavenging activity (2, 2 -diphenyl- 1 -picrylhydrazyl), and the ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) methods. Rosmarinic acid, apigenin, and luteolin contents were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography–diode array detection. The mean of total phenolic content ranged from 1. 89  ±  0. 09  mg gallic acid equivalents/g dry weight to 3. 54  ±  0. 22  mg gallic acid equivalents/g dry weight. The average value of the half maximal effective concentration (EC 50) for scavenging activity ranged from 5. 09  ±  0. 17  mg/mL to 14. 30  ±  1. 90  mg/mL and the variability of the EC 50 in FRAP ranged from 3. 72  ±  0. 12  mg/mL to 18. 55  ±  0. 77  mg/mL. Annual variation was found among this samples and the environmental conditions of 2009 {{were found to be}} more favorable. The plants collected from Sedano showed the highest antioxidant power. Our results show that rosmarinic acid and apigenin in L. latifolia contributed to the antioxidant properties of the waste. In conclusion, the <b>by-product</b> of the <b>distillation</b> industry could be valorizing as a source of natural antioxidants...|$|R
