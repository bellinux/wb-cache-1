40|$|ObjectiveTo {{evaluate}} {{early and}} late results of open (OR) and endovascular aneurysm repair by iliac side <b>branch</b> <b>device</b> (EVRISB) for aneurysms involving the iliac bifurcation (AIB). MethodsBetween January 2004 and March 2010, 118 patients were diagnosed with AIBs and underwent OR or EVRISB at two European vascular centers. Particularly, 64 (54. 2 %) patients were treated by EVRISB and 54 (45. 8 %) by OR. In one center, 24 consecutive patients were treated by surgery because this was the standard therapeutic approach until January 2005. For {{the rest of the}} study period until March 2010, 64 consecutive patients with AIB suitable for EVRISB underwent placement of <b>branched</b> <b>devices.</b> In the other center, 30 consecutive patients with AIBs were treated by OR because advanced endovascular imaging was not available during the study period. ResultsNo significant differences in demographics, anatomical characteristics, or comorbidities of the patients were recorded between the two groups. Early (30 -day) mortality was 0 % for EVRISB versus 5. 5 % for the OR group (P. 05). Primary patency rates were 98. 4 % for EVRISB and 100 % for OR patients. Primary and secondary endoleak rates of the EVRISB group were 12. 5 % and 6. 3 %, respectively. ConclusionsEndovascular repair by iliac <b>branch</b> <b>device</b> of aneurysms involving the iliac bifurcation can be accomplished with very low morbidity and mortality rates.

40|$|During {{endovascular}} aneurysm repair (EVAR), {{interruption of}} the internal iliac arteries (IIAs) or the inferior mesenteric artery by stents or embolization is thought to cause colon ischemia.

On postoperative day 2, the patient complained of abdominal pain, a sigmoidoscopy was performed revealing colon ischemia.

40|$|The main {{objective}} of this thesis is to critically evaluate the clinical results of emerging aortic endovascular therapies and then to utilize dynamic imaging modalities [EKG gated dynamic computerized tomographic angiography (CTA) and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) ] to understand the limitations of these technologies and potential source of any complications. The first published mid-term results of aneurysm repair with fenestrated and branched endografts from a European center of excellence is described in Chapter 2. The use of fenestrated and <b>branched</b> <b>devices</b> for difficult re-operative aortic surgery as a salvage procedure was examined in Chapter 3. These two clinical trials revealed new complications specific to fenestrated and <b>branched</b> <b>devices.</b> For example, fractured or bent side-branches and occluded renal branch vessels were observed. The potential of repeated dynamic stresses related to the cardiac cycle was postulated {{as a source of}} the problems. The dynamic effect of placing a relatively stiff endograft into a compliant, pulsatile aorta was examined in Chapter 4 through EKG-gated cine CTA. The cardiac based dynamics of the aorta was confirmed in a separate cohort of patients in Chapter 5 using the different modality of EKG-gated cine MRA. Furthermore, stent-graft design specific differences in compliance of the aorta and endograft were noted following EVAR. The renal arteries are the most commonly preserved aortic branch vessels using a fenestrated or branched technique. Furthermore, the complications identified in the fenestrated and branched clinical papers were typically related to the renal arteries. Therefore, we focused our attention on the effects of EVAR on renal artery motion in Chapter 6. Based on earlier work noting differences in stent-graft design on aortic dynamics, we evaluated the effect of three stent-graft designs (infra-re-nal fixation, supra-renal fixation, and branched) on renal artery motion in Chapter 7. Clinicians are increasingly placing thoracic endografts for 'off-label' indications such as traumatic aortic rupture in an effort to provide a less invasive and more effective treatment for these seriously injured poly-trauma patients. Chapter 8 is a systematic analysis of anatomic factors which may predict the rare, potentially devastating complication of thoracic endoprosthesis collapse. Based in part on dynamic CT imaging of thoracic endoprosthesis collapse outlined in Chapter 8, an examination of normal descending aortic pulsatility was undertaken. The results are presented in Chapter 9 and provide insight into the local environment into which these thoracic stent-grafts are being placed. Chapter 10 provides a summary of the most important findings...|$|R

In particular, between April 2010 and August 2012, 16 consecutive patients with aortoiliac or solitary iliac aneurysms and coexisting AIIAs were treated with the novel suggested strategy. The follow-up included physical examination and computed tomography (CT) angiography postoperatively, duplex scan at 3 months, CT scan at 6 months, and then CT scan annually.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} was to present iliac <b>branched</b> <b>device</b> (IBD) {{implantation}} in a fit 67 -year-old man with tortuous iliac anatomy after previous emergent open abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair. The patient underwent open treatment for a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm in another hospital. The procedure was complicated by extreme blood loss which prevented concommitant treatment of two large iliac aneurysms. Later, the patient underwent stent-grafting of a right common iliac artery aneurysm (CIAA) with coil embolization of the internal iliac artery (IIA). He was then refferred to our institute for treatment of the left CIAA with preservation of the left IIA. An IBD was used to this purpose. The introduction system was inserted over a through-and-through wire, and the bridging stent-graft via a left axillary approach. An Excluder leg was used to mate the IBD with the surgical graft limb. Additional self-expanding stents were needed to keep the limbs of the surgical graft open. One year later the patient is doing well, without buttock claudication, and the aneurysm is well excluded.

40|$|Reinterventions seem {{to occur}} more {{frequently}} after endovascular aneurysm repair than after open surgical repair and are encountered in about 20 % versus 10 % of the cases, respectively.

The incidence and type of reintervention depends on {{the complexity of the}} primary procedure, irrespective of whether it was open or endovascular. The use of a device outside instructions for use is associated with a higher complication rate but it may nevertheless be fully justified. Advanced stent-grafts such as fenestrated and <b>branched</b> <b>devices</b> require secondary procedures more often than a standard stent-graft. Similarly, more complex open repair, e. g. a bifurcated bypass, reimplantation of visceral arteries or a redo procedure, is also associated with more reinterventions than a simple tube graft.

40|$|Purpose: To {{report a}} new {{technique}} to preserve the internal iliac artery (IIA) in cases of aortoiliac aneurysms. Technique: Under bilateral common femoral artery (CFA) exposure, a crossover sheath was inserted from the contralateral CFA to the ipsilateral IIA involved in the common iliac artery (CIA) aneurysm. A Viabahn stent-graft was positioned 2 cm inside the IIA. The main body abdominal stent-graft was inserted through the ipsilateral CFA with distal sealing in the external iliac artery (EIA). The gate was cannulated, and the limb extension was positioned in the contralateral CIA near the IIA orifice. After the first Viabahn deployment, a second device was deployed with a minimum 1 -cm overlap inside the first Viabahn and 2 mm distal to the limb extension. For bilateral CIA aneurysms, the Viabahn and extension limb were landed in the EIA with IIA embolization. In the past year, this technique {{has been used in}} 5 patients with success.

Methods: From January 2011 to December 2013, a new surgeon-modified IBD technique was performed in department of vascular surgery of Peking Union Medical College Hospital in five patients treated for CIA aneurysm with or without abdominal aortic aneurysm. A stent-graft limb was initially deployed in vitro, anastomosed with vascular graft, creating a modified IBD reloaded into a larger sheath, with or without a guidewire preloaded into the side branch. The reloaded IBD was then placed in the iliac artery, with a covered stent bridging internal iliac artery and the branch. Finally, a bifurcated stent-graft was deployed, and a limb device was used to connect the main body and IBD. Results: Technical successes were obtained in all patients. The mean follow-up length was 24 months (range: 6 - 38 months). All grafts remained patent without any sign of endoleaks.
