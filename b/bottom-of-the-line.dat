5000|$|If all the {{equipment}} necessary is at easy access and is built by the individual the result could more than likely be a very economical <b>bottom-of-the-line</b> telescope, as good as or even better than anything offered in the stores for the same value of price.|$|E
50|$|In December 2000, the Japanese-spec {{model was}} renamed Wagon R-Solio, {{and this was}} {{available}} both in the <b>bottom-of-the-line</b> X trim level and in a more sports-oriented trim level known as the 1.3. In June 2002, the 1.0 E trim level {{was added to the}} Wagon R-Solio lineup. In August 2003, a mid-facelift Wagon R-Solio was released. In April 2004, the Wagon R-Solio was renamed Solio, losing the Wagon R moniker entirely. In August 2005, a facelifted Solio was launched.|$|E
50|$|Beginning in 1975, {{there was}} a {{complete}} overhaul of Asahi Optical's Pentax SLR line when {{the first of the}} Pentax K-series SLRs were introduced - the Pentax K2, KM and KX. The SMC Pentax K mount lenses were introduced at the same time. The Pentax K1000 and K2 DMD followed in 1976. The K2/K2 DMD was the top-of-the-line model with aperture priority; the KX, the full-featured manual mechanical model; the KM, the basic manual mechanical model. The 1000 in the K1000's name was a direct reference that its top shutter speed was superior to Asahi Optical's previous <b>bottom-of-the-line</b> Pentax Spotmatic SP 500 of 1971. The spartan viewfinder had 91% coverage.|$|E
50|$|In {{the center}} of El-Madina lives Ali, {{a young man who}} wants to act but is unable to find proper work. The only escape for his {{creative}} instincts, besides nightly conversations with a poster of Robert De Niro’s Raging Bull, is occasional <b>bottom-of-the-line</b> stage melodramas. Ali makes money as a butchers’ accountant in his neighborhood’s souq, where his father is a vegetable vendor. This quarter, Rod al-Faraj, is emblematic of a number of inner city neighborhoods in Cairo, which have been erased, and isolated their residents to desert suburbs by an Egyptian government, wanting to restore its historic monuments and attract tourists. Throughout the film, there’s a point at which Ali’s souq, slotted for tourist gentrification, is shut by the Egyptian internal security. He finally decides to escape Egypt and pursue acting in France. Two years later we do find him acting, not on stage but in the boxing ring. Unable to find legal work, he has fallen in with a fellow countryman who pays him to “throw” fights in crooked boxing matches. Ali is again stripped of his livelihood. After his business is forcibly absorbed by French gangsters, Ali’s partner betrays him and flees to Egypt, leaving him penniless and without an identity. Ultimately the actor finds himself back in Rod al-Faraj, having to start his life quite literally from scratch.|$|E
40|$|Intrigued by {{the sound}} of another {{recently}} restored example, I attempted to bring a sadly abused, <b>bottom-of-the-line,</b> Hoseus-equipped banjo up to playable condition. Reminders, lessons learned, and the joy of (albeit crude) handiwork made it well- worth the purchase price. The actual sound and physics of the Hoseus contraption remain hidden in the complex interaction of the various parts, as demonstrated by the accompanying sound samples...|$|E
40|$|A {{new method}} is {{reported}} to protect carbon steel pipelines for wet transport of sweet and sour gases from internal corrosion up to the top-of-the line (TOL) by using corrosion inhibitors. The method functions not only at turbulent gas flow but also at stratified flow and even under stagnant conditions. According to the TOL spreading inhibitor concept inhibitor molecules are transported with a spreading liquid film (produced by spreading-active compounds) against the gravity from the <b>bottom-of-the-line</b> (BOL) along the pipe wall to the TOL. The thesis describes the universal applicabillity of this concept which works under all surface conditions encountered in sweet or sour wet gas transport lines. The surface can be metallic clean, covered with mill scale, rust or corrosion product scales. These surfaces can be dry, water wet or hydrophobic. Careful tuning of the spreading system, composed of the 1 - or 2 -phase BOL liquid, the spreading agent and the corrosion inhibitor, yields optimum corrosion protection on the entire pipeline surface also at high water condensation rates...|$|E
