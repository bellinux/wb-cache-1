The federal real-estate property had previously been managed by the Federal <b>Buildings</b> <b>Directorate</b> Vienna (...) in the Vienna province, and in the other provinces by the Federal Buildings Administrations (...) [...] The aim was to improve the cost-efficiency of various government departments. The underlying premise for this system of internal rent was that requiring departments to pay for and account for their usage of buildings would force them to rationalise their use of space and allow surplus space to be put to alternative use or sold.|$|E

The Communication and Building Directorate (C&B), which existed at the time, was entrusted with all construction work for the Provincial Government of the then East Pakistan. After the liberation of Bangladesh in 1971, the country inherited two separate organizations for the construction and maintenance of Government Buildings: the Central PWD and the <b>Buildings</b> <b>Directorate</b> of the Provincial Government. These two entities were merged into one department in 1977 to form the Public Works Department (PWD) of which he became the appointed Executive (Chief Engineer) before becoming the Agency Chief (Chairman) of Rajdhani Unnayan Kartripakkha (RAJUK) which was then known as Dhaka Improvement Trust since 1956 {{and sat at the}} RAJUK Bhaban in the capital city of Dhaka.|$|E

One important premise for <b>building</b> interlocking <b>directorate</b> networks is that enterprises must be aware of each other’s existence. The analysis of Kono et al. (1998) about Fortune 500 companies shows that the distance between the headquarters of enterprises can influence the construction of interlocking directorate networks between them.|$|R

50|$|In 1972, a {{committee}} {{headed by the}} then president Abu Sayeed Chowdhury was formed and renovation work began. The original sketch was ignored, while the Construction and <b>Building</b> <b>Directorate</b> followed the 1963 design. The construction went quickly, according to a modified design from 1963. The murals destroyed by the Pakistani army were not restored and the basement was sealed off. Hamidur Rahman's original design was not approved by the directorate in the renovation work. In the mid-eighties, the monument underwent further renovation {{under the supervision of}} the then Department of Architecture chief architect SHM Abul Bashar, which extended the area of the Shaheed Minar premises, giving it a square shape from a triangular one. Quarters concerned demanded proper implementation of the design by Hamidur Rahman with the help of sculptor Novera Ahmed and Danish architect Gean Deleuran. ASM Ismail said that because of the extension, two entrances to the basement murals were permanently closed, and after remaining in an abandoned state for 15 years, the murals had lost much of their gloss. In the 1983 renovation, the original poor materials were lined with marble stone. A museum and library were also featured in the original plan. In August 2010, the High Court issued eight directives for the maintenance and renovation of the Shaheed Minar and asked the Public Works Department to establish a museum and a library on its premises.|$|R

30|$|As {{shown in}} Table  2, {{the reason that}} {{commerce}} enterprises have a greater propensity for <b>building</b> interlocking <b>directorate</b> networks {{is because they are}} more sensitive to changes in the supply and demand of the market compared to manufacturing enterprises (the reference group). They thus have a greater need to have a stable system to reduce market uncertainties. This is also a core mechanism of resource dependence theory. For example, wholesale and retail businesses are particularly sensitive to any information about supply and demand in the market; they can use interlocking directorate networks to obtain such information so as to reduce market uncertainties.|$|R

30|$|Given {{that the}} {{information}} from the CSMAR dataset about listed companies’ ultimate controllers only began in 2004 and considering that the SASAC at the state level was set up in 2003 and regional levels of SASAC quickly followed thereafter, their supervising and administrative effects on state assets would only surface the following year. Thus, in model 2, we recorded year dummy variables, making 2004 the reference group. The results show that the odds of companies with the state as their ultimate controller <b>building</b> interlocking <b>directorate</b> networks is 70 % higher than other companies. This result also shows high statistical significance regarding QAP, which further validates hypothesis 1.|$|R
30|$|After {{the concept}} study was {{released}} in June 2013, a big debate arose regarding preservation {{of some of the}} older government <b>buildings.</b> The <b>Directorate</b> of Cultural Heritage, therefore, did their own study (with a mandate from the Ministry of Environment) of the preservation value of these government buildings. It concluded that two of the buildings the concept study recommended for demolition were of very high preservation value (The Directorate of Cultural Heritage 2013). The debate and the sudden ordering of the new study demonstrate that, even if not mentioned in the mandates, preservation also is a societal value that the FGC should not unnecessarily interfere with.|$|R

30|$|Based on model 2, model 4 further differentiates the {{administrative}} levels to which SOEs are affiliated. This model shows that compared to non-state-controlled enterprises, {{the chance for}} central government-controlled enterprises to build interlocking directorate networks is 2.74 times higher, the chance for provincial government-controlled enterprises is 1.83 times higher, and the chance for city government-controlled enterprises is 1.31 times higher. It is evident {{that the relationship between}} {{the administrative}} levels to which state-controlled companies are affiliated and their likelihood of <b>building</b> interlocking <b>directorate</b> networks is positive. All these results show high statistical significance regarding QAP. However, we also found that there is no statistical significance between county-controlled companies and nongovernment-controlled companies, which could infer that the enthusiasm of lower-level governments to participate in the administration of state-owned companies has decreased. In short, the findings of model 4 support hypothesis 4, i.e., the higher the administrative level to which government-controlled companies are affiliated, {{the more likely it is}} that these companies will build interlocking directorate networks.|$|R

5000|$|Alpha Group was {{severely}} downgraded during the dissolution and {{collapse of the}} Soviet Union. After {{the fall of the}} USSR, both Alpha and Vympel were transferred to the newly formed Main Guard Directorate (GUO), which was established {{on the basis of the}} KGB's Ninth Chief Directorate. In 1993, they were taken from GUO control, and for a time being put under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD). As part of the government shakeup following the June 1995 Budyonnovsk hospital hostage crisis in which the Alpha Group had a leading role, Yeltsin fired the first Director of the Federal Security Service (FSB), Sergei Stepashin. Two months later, Alpha and Vityaz were both transferred from the MVD to the FSB. Simultaneously, Mikhail Barsukov became the new head of the organization, and created the FSB Anti-Terrorist Center (ATC), headed by Gen. Viktor Zorin. Directorate [...] "A" [...] (Alpha) was tasked with protecting transportation and <b>buildings</b> while <b>Directorate</b> [...] "B" [...] (Vega/Vympel) was tasked with protecting strategic sites (another Directorate, [...] "K", was tasked with ideological counterintelligence); [...] "A" [...] and [...] "B" [...] were soon joined in a Tsentr Spetsnaz (Special Purpose Center) under Gen.

30|$|Based on this theory, one {{important}} goal for constructing interlocking directorate networks {{is to reduce}} enterprises’ dependence on external resources, thus reducing the uncertainties that {{may be caused by}} resources’ volatility. Board directors not only supervise managers within an enterprise {{but at the same time}} also play the role of a resource provider (e.g., consultant) and/or a matchmaking informer for the enterprise’s development. The social capital (i.e., relationships) of any interlocking directorate is precisely manifested through its ability to provide useful information for the enterprises; it is an effective means for enterprises to acquire the key development resources (Hillman and Dalziel 2003). Empirical research has shown that <b>building</b> an interlocking <b>directorate</b> network with investment banks can reduce enterprises’ dependence on investment banks (Baker 1990).|$|R
