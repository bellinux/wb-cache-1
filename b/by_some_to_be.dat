5|$|The {{services}} are {{named after the}} nearby Watford Gap, a crossing point of the limestone ridge {{just north of the}} village of Watford; the name is unrelated to the town of Watford in Hertfordshire.

5|$|Al-Maʿarri is {{controversial}} even today {{as he was}} sceptical of Islam, the dominant religion of the Arab World. In 2013, almost a thousand years after his death, the al-Nusra Front, a branch of al-Qaeda, beheaded a statue of Al-Maʿarri {{during the civil war}} in Syria. The statue had been crafted by the sculptor Fathi Muhammad. The motive behind the beheading is disputed; theories range from {{the fact that he was}} a heretic to the fact that he is believed <b>by</b> <b>some</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> related to the Assad family.|$|E

5|$|Banks {{fitted in}} well at Stoke, as Waddington built {{a team of}} veteran players who were judged <b>by</b> <b>some</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> past their best. The Potters {{struggled}} near {{the foot of the}} First Division table in the 1967–68 and 1968–69 campaigns, before rising to ninth place in the 1969–70 season. Banks remained a reliable stopper for the club, though on 1 March 1969 he was knocked unconscious at Roker Park by Sunderland's Malcolm Moore, and his replacement David Herd conceded four goals in a 4–1 defeat. Banks also played a season for the Cleveland Stokers of the American United Soccer Association in the summer of 1968: he played seven of the short-lived club's 12 games in Cleveland, Ohio.|$|E
5|$|Bar Hemingway was the {{favourite}} bar of Ernest Hemingway and is said <b>by</b> <b>some</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{the birthplace}} of the Bloody Mary cocktail which was invented for him. However, the claim is disputed as Fernand Petiot claimed to have invented the drink in 1921 while working at Harry's New York Bar, a frequent Paris hangout for Hemingway and other American expatriates, rather than in the bar in the Ritz itself. The bar has been restored to its original appearance, with rich wood panelling and leather upholstery and has 25 original photographs on the walls taken by the author of places and people that inspired him.|$|E
5|$|Carmelo Camet {{was born}} on October 29, 1904, the son of Francisco Carmelo Camet, a fencer at the 1900 Summer Olympics in Paris, and Clara Isa. The elder Camet, though officially an athlete from France, is {{considered}} <b>by</b> <b>some</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> Argentina's first Olympic participant. This is disputed, however, by those who claim that Horatio Torromé should hold this title as the first official Argentine representative. Carmelo had one brother, Carlos Ernesto Camet, who pursued a political career. Carlos, {{who served as a}} deputy to the national congress, was, like the rest of his family, supportive of the Radical Civil Union, an Argentine political reform party formed in the 1890s.|$|E

David has also obtained the WSA Player of the Year on seven occasions, 2005–2010 and 2012.|$|E
5|$|From Aristotle until Darwin, {{the natural}} world was {{predominantly}} considered static and unchanging. Prior to The Origin of Species, there was little appreciation or understanding of the dynamic and reciprocal relations between organisms, their adaptations, and the environment. An exception is the 1789 publication Natural History of Selborne by Gilbert White (1720–1793), considered <b>by</b> <b>some</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{one of the earliest}} texts on ecology. While Charles Darwin is mainly noted for his treatise on evolution, {{he was one of the}} founders of soil ecology, and he made note of the first ecological experiment in The Origin of Species. Evolutionary theory changed the way that researchers approached the ecological sciences.|$|E
5|$|It is {{considered}} <b>by</b> <b>some</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{the most important}} and pivotal of his early compositions because his performance of the song at an April 15, 1972, live radio concert at Sigma Studios on WMMR in Philadelphia, and the subsequent airplay this live version received on the station, brought him to the attention of major record labels, including Columbia, with whom he would sign a recording contract in 1973.|$|E

5|$|Its growing rarity {{increased}} interest from European museums and private collectors in obtaining skins and eggs of the bird. On 3 June 1844, {{the last two}} confirmed specimens were killed on Eldey, {{off the coast of}} Iceland, ending the last known breeding attempt. Later reports of roaming individuals being seen or caught are unconfirmed. A record of one great auk in 1852 is considered <b>by</b> <b>some</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the last sighting of a member of the species. The great auk is mentioned in several novels and the scientific journal of the American Ornithologists' Union is named The Auk in honour of this bird.|$|E
5|$|Nobel-laureate William Vickrey is {{considered}} <b>by</b> <b>some</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{the father of}} congestion pricing, as he first proposed it for the New York City Subway system in 1952. In the road transportation arena these theories were extended by Maurice Allais, Gabriel Roth who {{was instrumental in the}} first designs and upon whose World Bank recommendation the first system was put in place in Singapore. Also, it was considered by the Smeed Report, published by the British Ministry of Transport in 1964, but its recommendations were rejected by successive British governments.|$|E
5|$|On April 18, 1989, a {{group of}} 39 women went into the Pittston Coal {{headquarters}} and held a 36‑hour sit-down strike. The women stated {{that they would not}} leave until a contract was signed. When questioned by police and media reporters to give up their names, the women responded by saying that they were daughters of Mother Jones. The Daughters gained the attention of the media and completely halted production at Pittston for an entire day and a half. The women involved were not members of the UMWA but wanted to support their cause, and due to this they were linked to the UMWA and considered <b>by</b> <b>some</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a part of the union.|$|E
