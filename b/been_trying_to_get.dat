5|$|Haddock has <b>been</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> {{the local}} stonemason {{to fix a}} broken step at Marlinspike, but he is never available. Milanese opera diva Bianca Castafiore invites herself to Marlinspike Hall. Haddock, who dislikes her company, tries to leave before she arrives but trips on the broken step and sprains his ankle. The doctor puts his foot in a cast and imposes bed rest. Castafiore then arrives with her maid, Irma, and pianist, Igor Wagner.

5|$|C.J., however, {{seems more}} than {{reasonably}} distressed {{by the whole}} incident. She pays Hoynes a visit {{to give him a}} warning, and it becomes clear that {{she was one of the}} women with whom the Vice President had an affair. She makes it clear to him that, should he attempt smear tactics against any of these women, she will fight him on it, and he says he had no plans to include information about her in his book (when Hoynes' book is published in Season 6, a scene with C.J. confirms that he did not mention her in the book outside of her work as Press Secretary). C.J. later sadly relates to Toby how deeply she regretted sleeping with Hoynes. Distressed and in need of comfort, she decides to finally call her college boyfriend Ben, who has <b>been</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> in touch with her (and been ignored or shunted aside) for quite a while.|$|E

25|$|From 1996 to 2009, the IFF used a World Floorball Championship format {{where the}} last {{team in the}} A-Division was relegated to the B-Division, while the top team in the B-Division was {{promoted}} to the A-Division. This format caused much hardship for countries such as Australia, Canada, Slovakia, and Spain, who have all <b>been</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> to the B-Division from the C-Division since 2004. In 2010, the IFF adopted a FIFA-like continental qualification system, where teams must qualify {{to play at the}} world championships. Depending on the number of countries registered per continent or region, the IFF gives spots for the world championships. For example, Argentina, Brazil, Canada and the United States would need to play for one spot at the world championships in a continental qualification tournament for the Americas.|$|E

The video and a similar one posted on the web site of the Lexington Herald-Leader newspaper attracted the attention of television producer Matt Sharp of Sharp Entertainment. Brown relates that, while performing as a sideshow at the Mothman Festival in Point Pleasant, West Virginia, a group of executives from Sharp Entertainment and Animal Planet, who were there on an unrelated assignment, approached him about doing a television show. The executives told Brown that they had <b>been</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> in touch with him for over a year, but that his fellow performers had refused to deliver their messages to him.|$|E

While promoting the US theatrical release of The Zero Theorem, Gilliam revealed he and LaGravenese were meeting to see if The Defective Detective script could be made into a miniseries. If this comes together, {{it would be the first}} time Gilliam has ever directed for television. Stanley Kubrick had Gilliam in mind to direct a sequel to Dr. Strangelove.|$|E
