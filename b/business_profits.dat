The export of raw agricultural products, minerals, textiles and steel prompted an economic boom; subsequently the surplus balance of trade grew to over five hundred million pesetas. The extraordinary growth in <b>business</b> <b>profits</b> favoured industrial oligarchs and the merchant middle class, but increases in wages for workers did not keep pace with inflation—overall standards of living for the masses actually decreased. The urban industrial proletariat, meanwhile, kept up continuous pressure for wage increases.|$|E
25|$|The U.S. finance {{industry}} comprised only 10% {{of total}} non-farm <b>business</b> <b>profits</b> in 1947, but it grew to 50% by 2010. Over the same period, finance industry income as {{a proportion of}} GDP rose from 2.5% to 7.5%, and the finance industry's proportion of all corporate income rose from 10% to 20%. The mean earnings per employee hour in finance relative to all other sectors has closely mirrored the share of total U.S. income earned by the top 1% income earners since 1930. The mean salary in New York City's finance industry rose from $80,000 in 1981 to $360,000 in 2011, while average New York City salaries rose from $40,000 to $70,000. In 1988, there were about 12,500 U.S. banks with less than $300 million in deposits, and about 900 with more deposits, but by 2012, there were only 4,200 banks with less than $300 million in deposits in the U.S., and over 1,800 with more.|$|E

The deployment of minimarket also has entered the residential areas. The rapidly developing minimarket located closely in residential areas has a bad impact for the traditional stores.

2500|$|The recovery, however, proved short-lived. <b>Business</b> <b>profits</b> {{declined}} steeply between 1882 and 1884.

Manufacturing again collapsed - durable goods output fell by a quarter again. The decline became another financial crisis in 1884, when multiple New York banks collapsed; simultaneously, in 1883–1884, {{tens of millions of}} dollars of foreign-owned American securities were sold out of fears that the United States was preparing to abandon the gold standard. This financial panic destroyed eleven New York banks, more than a hundred state banks, and led to defaults on at least $32 million worth of debt. Unemployment, which had stood at 2.5% between recessions, surged to 7.5% in 1884–1885, and 13% in the northeastern United States, even as immigration plunged in response to deteriorating labor markets.|$|E

[...] Since 2006, [...] IDEAL won three infrastructure contracts yet it faces stiff competition {{from a number}} of other Mexican and Spanish construction companies. The number of contracts is fewer than its biggest local competitor, Empresas ICA. During the same period, Empresas obtained 18 Mexican projects valued at US$1.09billion, including airports, toll roads, hospitals and oil platforms. Some of the projects IDEAL has been awarded include the Nezahualcoyotl development, which is a landfill that was acquired for US$150million by Slim to develop a shopping mall, two schools, a hospital and a park on the site. Other contracts IDEAL has been awarded include a water-treatment plant contract, and a real estate partnership with the Mexican hospital chain Star Médica. IDEAL is also betting on one of the poorest landfills surrounding Mexico City. Slim has also planned to purchase several toll roads offered by the Mexican government that it took over from private companies following the December 1994 currency devaluation. Though speculation that the landfill will take about 12 years to yield a return, the development of a such poor area is revealed to promise handsome <b>business</b> <b>profits</b> over the years as Grupo Elektra, Mexico's largest consumer electronics retailer, sells 2,000 flat screen televisions a year at its store in the area, making it the third-best-selling outlet. Included in the development, IDEAL will also collect rent from a university, a hospital and a school that will be built around a mall, will have 178 stores, including Inditex's Zara fashion chain and Slim's Grupo Sanborns and the Mexican unit of Sears Holdings. A park in Nezahualcoyotl, {{the first of its kind}} will also be constructed. The park will comprise 34 soccer fields, 12 tennis, basketball and volleyball courts, a baseball field and a gym with a swimming pool.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — We {{consider}} whether the off-line compilation {{of a set}} of Service Level Agreements (SLAs) into low-level management policies can lead to the runtime maximization of the overall <b>business</b> <b>profit</b> for a service provider. Using a simple web application hosting SLA template for a utility service provider, we derive low-level QoS management policies and validate their consistency. We show how the default first come first served (FCFS) mechanism for the runtime scheduling of triggered policies fails to deliver an all times maximum <b>business</b> <b>profit</b> for the service provider. To achieve a better <b>business</b> <b>profit,</b> first a penalty/reward model that is derived from the SLA Service Level Objectives (SLOs) is used to assign runtime utility tags to triggered policies. Then three policy scheduling algorithms, which are based on the prediction of the future state of the running SLAs, are used to drive the runtime actions of the Policy Decision Point (PDP). The prediction function per see involved the unsolved problem of predicting in realtime the evolution of the transient state of a variant of an M/M/Ct/Ct queue. A simple approximative solution to the latter problem is provided. Finally, using the PS policy simulator tool, comparative simulation results for the <b>business</b> <b>profit</b> generated by each of the proposed policy scheduling algorithms are presented. PS is a novel tool which we have developed to respond to the increasing need of benchmarking SLA and policy-based management solutions. I...|$|R
