[...] İstanbul Technical University, Institute of Science and Technology, 2015 Gıdaların uzun süreli muhafaza ihtiyacı, insanlık tarihi boyunca, bir amaç ve zorunluluk olmuştur. Bu doğrultuda uygulanan en yaygın yöntemler, kurutma, tuzla salamura yapma, konserveleme ve soğutmadır. Bütün muhafaza yöntemleri, gıdaların besin değerlerini ve kalite değerlerini en üst düzeyde tutmayı amaçlamaktadır. Ancak gıdaların gerek kurutma, gerekse salamura veya konserveleme işlemlerinde, besin değerlerinde (özellikle vitamin) meydana gelen kayıplar oldukça fazladır. Bu nedenlere bağlı olarak soğutma yöntemi bir çok gıdaya uygulanabilirlik, besin / kalite değerlerinin korunması ve uygulama kolaylığı bakımından en etkili yöntemdir. Günümüz teknolojik imkanları dahilinde en yüksek verimli soğutma sistemi dondurma / şoklama / derin dondurma teknolojisidir. <b>Blast</b> <b>Freezer</b> sistemlerine yönelik olarak günümüzde oda tipi ve buzdolabı tipi olmak üzere iki genel kullanım sınıfı bulunmaktadır. Mevcut durumda oda tipi sistemler ülkemiz genelinde de üretilebilir iken, buzdolabı tipi sistemlerin boyut ve ağırlık kriterleri nedeniyle teknik altyapısının daha zor olduğu görülmüştür. Dondurma teknolojisi ile muhafaza etmenin temel prensibi, - 18 〬C derece ve daha düşük sıcaklık değerlerinde gıdayı hızlı bir şekilde dondurarak, gıda bozulmasına sebep olabilecek mikroorganizmaların çalışma ve çoğalma faaliyetlerinin tam olarak durdurulmasıdır. Bu çalışmanın amacı Hesaplamalı Akışkanlar Dinamiği (HAD) tekniğini kullanarak <b>Blast</b> <b>Freezer</b> buzdolabında akışın kabin içerisinde hedeflenen şekilde homojen şekilde dolaşmasını ve gıda kütle merkezinin ısısını 270 dakikada 100 〬C dereceden - 18 〬C dereceye düşürülmesini sağlamaktır. Bu çalışmayı literatürdeki çalışmalardan farklı kılan özellik, şok dondurucu üzerinde deneysel ve HAD yöntemleri yardımı ile tasarımın doğrulanması ve daha verimli bir prototipin imalatıdır. Çalışmada ileriki aşamada farklı fan motorları kullanılarak alternatif incelemeler yapılmıştır. Bu analizlerin sonucunda toplam debi ve her bir fandan çıkan debi değerleri bulunmuştur. Ayrıca kabin içindeki sıcaklık dağılımları ve deneysel çalışmalarla uyumluluğu gösteren ölçüm paketlerinin sıcaklık dağılımları da sunulmuştur.   Yapılan deneyler ve bunları destekleyen analizler doğrultusunda görülmüştür ki kabin içinde sıcaklık duvarlara yaklaştıkça artmaktadır. En soğuk paketler orta şok dondurucuda bulunmuştur. Sıcaklığın hızlı şekilde çok düşük değerlere düşmesi nedeni ile üst ve alt taraflardaki sıcaklık farkı çalışmamızı etkileyen önemli bir parametredir. Ayrıca kontrol panellerini kullanmadan, uyguladığımız sınır şartları ile çekirdek sıcaklığını istediğimiz sürede - 18 C dereceye düşürülmesi mümkün kılınmıştır. Preserving {{food was}} {{historically}} one of man’s main challenges. The general methods of protection include drying, bedding in salt, conserving and freezing. All protection methods aim {{to maintain the}} content and quality of food at the highest possible level. However, drying, salting and conserving operations all result {{in the loss of}} some contents, especially the vitamins. Therefore, considering the quality and content of the food, freezing could be applied to many foods and this method is easier.   Regarding the modern technological possibilities, the highest level of quality could be achieved using freezing, blasting and deep-freezing where food is reserved safe for storage and later consumption. Blast freezing  is commonly used in food catering and recently, in preparation of 'instant' foods, as it ensures the safety {{and the quality of the}} food product. A <b>blast</b> <b>freezer</b> is an appliance which reduces the core temperature of a cooked food from 100 ° C to - 18 ° C in 270 minutes using 3 powerful fans and a cooling unit.   The main principle of using the freezing method is to freeze food in  - 18 ° C and to quickly  reduce the core temperature. This research aims to use the CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) methods to reduce the temperature from 100 ° C to  - 18 ° C in 270 minutes so that activity and growth of microorganisms may be prevented which causes rinsing of the food. In the present research, the model is designed in Solidworks CAD (Computer Aided Design)  program, then analyzed in Ansys Fluent CFD program. The present research differs from the previous research work and literature mainly by  finding a relation between the CFD and the experimental results which led to manufacturing of an improved prototype. The air supply system is modelled as a closed-loop system while in former studies mass flow rates were given as boundary conditions. However, in this study the air supply system is completely modeled so that mass flow rates could be investigated numerically as well. Furthermore the CFD analysis was validated with experimental studies.   The layout of the thesis is roughly as follows. First and second chapters include literature review in which existing refrigerator analysis, principles, food placement and CFD modeling of fan and cooling units are presented. Third chapter encompasses presenting the purchased refrigerator, testing environment, equipment and data logger. In the next step, a numerical model was generated and transferred from CAD to CFD environment and analyzed in Chapter 4. In Chapter 5, production line and prototype are presented in brief. Finally, the results are presented in the sixth chapter.    In this thesis work, Unilab commercial program is utilized to select evaporator and condenser. Mesh generation using  Moving Reference Frame (MRF) method for modeling of the fan and the experimental approach of this study are based on the similar research and literature. In experiments, the model was installed in a laboratory test room. The packages were placed in the <b>Blast</b> <b>freezer</b> in 14 1 / 1 GN trays. Then, the space between back of the model and rear wall of test room was adjusted to be 500 mm, as well as at least 1500 mm for space between sides of the refrigerator and side walls. The test was commenced at fixed 35 〬C as ambient temperature. A package of 1 kg was placed in each tray. In total there were 14 packages weighting 14 kg. During a 240 -minute period the temperature of packages were recorded simultaneously utilizing 14 sensors. During the experiments, core temperature of packages were recorded during a 4 -hour process using data logger. The laboratory is conditioned to ensure the ambient temperature and relative humidity with respect to the tropical environment standards.   For CFD, simplified CAD design of <b>Blast</b> <b>freezer</b> was exported to Ansys and was meshed using a number of meshing methods. In Fluent software, obtained meshed file was imported and boundary conditions were applied. The material specifications of air as a coolant and polyurethane as insulation material were applied in the CFD program.   Consequently, pressure based k-εturbulence model was used to solve for the Navier-Stokes and energy equations. Then the airflow analysis and both airflow and temperature analysis were obtained for empty and full <b>Blast</b> <b>freezer</b> respectively.   The research is carried out using different fan motors. Upon conclusion, the sum total debit (mass flow)  and the debit of each fan is given. In addition to debit, temperature distribution in the cabin and in measuring packs and its agreement with other experiments is presented. Based on experiments and analyses, the temperature in the cabin increase as we approach the walls. The effect of weight of cooling air can be neglected due to the high speed of the exiting stream from fans. These fans also avoid downeard movement of cold stream.   In terms of air circulation, the model refrigerator can be divided into three parts: The first part is affected by upper fan. Second part is under the influence of middle fan and the last part is affected by the bottom fan. The research shows that air stream is more dense in middle zone. The reason relates to the fact that one side of the upper and bottom fans are closed; while for the middle fan both sides are open and this leads to stream of more air and cooling middle pockets. Because of the decrease of temperature to very low levels, the difference of temperature in upper and lower parts will not influence our research. Moreover, without using the control system, - 18 ° C could be achieved until we use the boundary conditions for obtaining the core temperature. Validated from the computational analysis and the experimental studies, it is seen that the coolest packages are found to be in the middle regions while the warmest ones are in the upper and lower regions. The highest mass flow rates are at the fan outlet and the lowest rates are found at the fan inlet.   The maximum velocity of 31. 123 and 26. 91 m/s were obtained for empty and full refrigerator respectively. Core temperature reduction in CFD and experimental model were agreeable. The average difference was 0. 694 ° C which is a negligible value and it implies the CFD model is valid. Therefore the prototype production is carried out with the respect to the CFD solutions.   After the prototype was manufactured, some tests according to the EN 16825 have been performed and it is approved that the prototype complied with the performance requirements. Then, this <b>Blast</b> <b>freezer</b> is presented to the market. Yüksek LisansM. Sc...|$|E

The carcasses were individually bagged, placed in a <b>blast</b> <b>freezer</b> (— 40 C) until the internal breast temperature reached — 2 C, and stored at — 2 C for 30 days. Carcass-halves were then sampled by either a preenrichment procedure (lactose broth) or by a shorter direct enrichment (selenite cystine broth) procedure. The marker organisms were detected on 73 of 79 inoculated carcass-halves when preenrichment was used, and on 79 of 80 when sampling was by direct enrichment. Recoveries were also good when whole carcasses inoculated with either 20 cells of S. heidelberg or S. senftenberg were stored for 3 and 6 months at — 23 C.

Results show that nucleation is highly affected by the initial temperature and heat transfer rate during phase change. The stochastic nature of nucleation only allowed us to consider it a random variable inside the model temperature restriction interval, it not yet being possible to know what triggers nucleation. However, this study allowed us to conclude that: (1) the structure of liquid water in the supercooled region plays a very significant role during the supercooling effect, (2) nucleation temperatures increase in the supercooled region due to the release of latent heat, and (3) strawberry morphology and operational variables {{have a profound effect on}} the supercooling capacity. In our opinion, supercooling is still an open subject, and only a deeper understanding of the structuring of water and dynamics of nucleation at the molecular level may lead to significant advances in the quality of frozen foods and cryopreservation.

Henwil wish to implement a second shift, which will run {{through the night and}} will allow them to double daily production. However the current production line at the abattoir is not capable of handling a second shift mainly due to a constraint in the blast freezing section. The current <b>blast</b> <b>freezer</b> configuration used at Henwil needs to run through the night in order to complete the freezing of products from the day’s production. For this reason Henwil have decided to install a carton freezer which is capable of freezing enough products to allow them to implement a second shift which will run through the night and ultimately double production. This study includes three major phases. The first phase was process mapping including all details of the process, data collection and topic research with reference to different simulation software packages. The second phase was composed of data analysis and simulation model construction representing the Henwil abattoir process in order to gain a holistic view of how the process runs and how it is affected by the proposed changes in the system. Finally the simulation model needed to be validated and findings documented including results and conclusions. The project seeks to advise Henwil on the impact that implementing a carton freezer will have on the current process and its resources and once it has been implemented how best to use the resources available to them in order to achieve optimum production from the line.

40|$|Graduation date: 1981 Peas (Pisum sativum) are an {{important}} constituent in the diet of many people. Peas may be cooked and eaten as green peas shortly after harvest, stored for short periods in the pods, or, after suitable treatment, stored for long periods before consumption. Many factors influence the yield and quality of frozen peas but maturity requires careful consideration because of the relation of maturity to color, flavor, and texture. The objectives of this thesis were {{to determine the effect}} of the maturity stage {{on the quality of the}} frozen peas during processing and storage and to correlate the interactions between the sensory evaluation panel with the physical and chemical quality factors measured. Venus pea variety grown under commercial conditions at the Sublimity area east of Salem, Oregon, were used in this study. The trials were randomized, for three stages of maturity with three replications per each stage of maturity. Each of the three maturity stages was harvested; vined; blanched by steaming at 98. 8 °C (210 °F) for 30 sec for the immature peas, 60 sec for the mature peas, and 90 sec for the overmature peas; frozen at - 37. 2 °C (- 35 °F) for 24 hr in an air <b>blast</b> <b>freezer</b> and stored at - 23. 3 °C (- 10 °F) for 4 and 8 month. During processing and. storage the following factors were determined: tenderometer value, total solids, alcohol insoluble solids, peroxidase activity, ascorbic acid., total sugars and sensory evaluation. In the sensory evaluation analysis starchiness, sweetness and tenderness intensity, as well as texture, flavor and overall desirability were measured. Analysis of variance and least significant difference were used to compare the effect of pea maturity during processing and storage on the different quality factors measured. Correlation coefficients were used to determine the relationship between these factors. Immature peas had lower tenderometer value than overmature peas. Tenderometer value of peas decreased, during processing. The highest total solids content was observed, in the overmature peas and the lowest total solids content in the immature peas. This behavior was also observed in the alcohol insoluble solids content. Raw peas in the three maturity stages had the same initial peroxidase activity and the significant effect of the maturity level found in the residual peroxidase was affected by the different blanching time applied at each maturity stage. The ascorbic acid content was significantly affected, by the maturity level and was reduced during the blanching treatment. Total soluble sugar content was higher in immature peas and lower in overmature peas. All the sensory evaluation parameters measured were affected by the maturity. In general, the taste panel found higher flavor desirability on the mature peas but when texture and overall desirability were measured immature and mature peas were equally preferred. Significant correlations were found between physical, chemical, and sensory parameters analyzed, some of them are tenderometer value and alcohol insoluble solids; total solids and alcohol insoluble solids; alcohol insoluble solids and overall desirability...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1967 Preservation of food by {{freezing}} is {{a common}} method of processing. Of relatively recent origin is the freeze-drying method. This method has several advantages over other methods of preservation, but is not free of problems, {{one of which is}} the maintenance of appearance and texture. In the present study, the effects of freezing, thawing, freeze-drying, and reconstitution on the physico-chemical properties of Northwest variety strawberries with particular reference to textural characteristics were investigated. Very little prior work is reported with regards to the effect of these factors on fruits. Strawberries were frozen at two different rates of freezing - slow frozen at 0 °F and quick frozen in a <b>blast</b> <b>freezer</b> at - 20 °F. Frozen berries were examined by physical and chemical methods to evaluate the changes. In a separate study, berries were thawed under standard conditions of relative humidity and temperature and the drip collected for analysis. Thawed berries were examined by both physical and chemical methods. To study the reconstitution behaviour of the berries, they were freeze-dried and reconstituted under standard conditions of berry to water ratio, temperature of water and time of reconstitution. Reconstituted berries and the remaining solutions were then examined. Measurements of the texture, color, total solids, alcohol insoluble solids, pectins, cellulose, ash, and constituents of ash were made on raw, frozen, thawed, and reconstituted berries. The results indicated the following conclusions: 1. An increase in percent soluble solids, pH, and titratable acids and a decrease in total solids and AIS of the berries were observed upon freezing. Slow frozen berries showed more pronounced effects. Smaller berries were observed to change the least. No significant differences were found in the other constituents. 2. Strawberries lose weight upon thawing depending on the chemical composition of the berries. An inverse relationship was observed between weight loss and total solids, AIS, pectic substances, cellulose, ash and mineral content of the berries. With gradual increase in the weight loss upon thawing, there was a progressive softening of the berries. A direct relationship was found between weight loss and the amount of pectic substances, sugars, titratable acids, ash, and minerals found in the drip. Slow freezing resulted in higher weight loss and smaller berries lost the least. 3. A linear relationship exists between weight loss of the berries upon thawing and the area of the drip. This method offers a convenient and quick procedure for evaluation of the quality of frozen strawberries, with the added advantage of collecting the drip and storing it for further analysis at a convenient time. 4. Ability to reconstitute was found to be related to rate of freezing and size of berry. Quick freezing and smaller berries gave the best results. 5. Direct relationship was found between the degree of reconstitution and total solids, AIS, pectic substances, cellulose, ash, and minerals. The amount of pectic substances, sugar, titratable acids, ash, and minerals leaching out of the berries into the reconstituting solution were smaller and were independent of the degree of reconstitution. 6. Individual berries showed a large variation in their chemical constituents, which was responsible for the differences in the thawing and reconstitution behavior of Northwest strawberries...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the effect of freezing methods and post-mortem ageing days for frozen beef m. longissimus lumborum (LL) on colour, moisture characteristics; characteristics and sensory characteristics. There were 3 freezing treatments: fresh, never frozen (FR); quick-frozen (QF), and slow-frozen (SF). All fresh and frozen beef m. longissimus lumborum samples were aged for 3 or 14 -days and frozen beef samples were frozen before ageing. Materials and methods Three replications of 7 beef samples (steaks) per treatment (total of 3 -days, n= 126) were used. Fresh beef samples (FR) were kept in a cold room at 3 °C until the next morning (Day 3). Slow-frozen samples (SF) were packed in a single layer on 3 shelves of a house hold freezer (AEG Skandiluxe) to reach a core temperature of - 20 °C. Quick-frozen samples (QF) were placed in a single layer on 3 shelves of an IcematicT 15 - 2 P <b>blast</b> <b>freezer</b> to a reach to core temperature of - 30 °C in 3 hours. All samples for the two freezing treatments were stored after the freezing processing at - 20 °C freezer room and were then thawed in vacuum packages for 18 hours at 3 °C in a dark chiller before analyses. Results Moisture characteristics The freezing methods and ageing days had a significant effect (P< 0. 001) on moisture characteristics but showed no effect on cooking losses. Drip loss and more pressed out water were higher for samples aged for 3 -days compared to 14 -days ageing postmortem. The effect of ageing days on moisture characterises was different for fresh compared to frozen beef samples (interaction: P< 0. 001). Drip loss of frozen steaks during 3 -days ageing post-mortem was significantly higher (P< 0. 001) than those aged for 14 -days. Drip loss between fresh samples aged for 3 and 14 -days nor between frozen samples aged for 3 or 14 -days. Colour characteristics Most colour characteristics were significantly affected by freezing methods and postmortem ageing days. Fresh beef samples had significantly higher (P< 0. 001) values for redness (a*) and chroma, lower values (P< 0. 05) for hue (closer to typical red colour) and were brighter (higher L*) than samples of both freezing methods. Higher (P< 0. 001) OxyMb and lower MetMb were recorded for fresh compared to frozen samples. Beef samples aged for 3 -days had lower (P< 0. 05) b* (less yellow) and hue angle values than those aged for 14 -days. DeoxyMb and OxyMb were higher and MetMb lower (P< 0. 05) in 3 -days samples compared to 14 -days samples. Sensory characteristics Freezing method had a significant effect (P< 0. 001) on WBSF, tenderness related sensory attributes and meat flavour. Fresh samples were tougher than frozen samples according to WBSF and sensory scores for first bite, overall tenderness, and residual connective tissue. In addition, quick-frozen samples were also significantly more tender (P< 0. 001) than slow-frozen samples according to all three tenderness related sensory parameters. Conclusion Overall, freezing methods and post-mortem ageing days influenced moisture and colour characteristics of beef. Quick freezing method improves tenderness measured as WBSF or sensory tenderness, but neither freezing method nor post-mortem ageing period (day 3 and day 14) had a meaningful effect on cooking losses.

40|$|Previous {{research}} has shown that pre-slaughter stress of cattle reduces beef quality because of its effect on post mortem muscle pH. Spray washing in the cattle yard is a hygiene requirement of the New Zealand Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries (MAF) {{in order to reduce the}} contamination of carcasses. However, the washing stresses the animal. This study investigated the effect of spray-washing cattle on beef quality. Spray washing of cattle resulted in considerably more variation in the ultimate pH (pHu) of the meat (5. 52 to 6. 48) compared to meat from dry animals (5. 50 to 5. 79). The increased variability in pHu was reflected in the meat shear force values from the spray-washed animals, which ranged from 5. 2 to 14. 5 kgF, while that from the dry animals ranged between 4. 8 and 8. 6 kgF. There was a tendency for meat from spray-washed animals to be tougher than meat from dry animals (p = 0. 089). The effect of spray washing on calpain I autolysis, desmin and troponin T degradation during post mortem period was determined. Results showed that spray washing tended to cause an increase (p = 0. 07) in post mortem degradation of desmin but had no significant effect on troponin T degradation or calpain I autolysis. The second part of the research investigated the effect of post-slaughter processing conditions on turkey breast meat tenderness, and the biochemical basis for the toughening of turkey breast meat. Anecdotal evidence showed that consumers perceived turkey breast meat as being tough. The preliminary results of this research indicated that the tenderness of turkey breast meat was variable and the mean shear force was higher than would be acceptable to consumers. The observed toughening of turkey breast meat may be a result of post-slaughter treatments of turkey carcasses, such as the rate of carcass cooling, stunning method and carcass deboning time. The effect of these factors on turkey breast meat tenderness were investigated in this research. Post-slaughter temperature and pH of turkey breast muscle was measured at different times. The carcass temperature ranged from 32 °C to 36 °C at 15 minutes post slaughter. Immersion chilling (1 st water bath and 2 nd ice slush bath) rapidly reduced the internal breast muscle temperature to about 10 °C by 75 min after stunning. In all three experiments (2, 3 & 4), cold blast treatment significantly decreased the internal breast muscle temperature compared to the breast muscle that was chilled only. The breast muscle temperature immediately after a cold blast treatment (about six hours post-slaughter) ranged from 2 - 6 °C. In this study, the mean pH of turkey breast muscle at 15 min post-slaughter was 6. 52, indicating that turkey breast muscle exhibited accelerated rigor mortis compared to lamb or beef. The pH of turkey breast muscle at six hours post-slaughter was close to the ultimate pH, which ranged from 5. 80 to 5. 96. Results of this research showed that turkey processing conditions have a toughening effect on the resulting breast meat. Deboning of turkey breast muscle three hours post-slaughter caused between a 80 % and 90 % increase in toughness of the meat compared to muscle aged on the bone for 24 hours. The use of a <b>blast</b> <b>freezer</b> to rapidly cool the breast also toughened the meat by an average of 30 %. The mechanisms responsible for the meat toughening were both muscle contraction and a reduction of proteolysis. The sarcomere length of muscles deboned three hours post mortem was significantly shorter than muscles deboned at 24 hours post mortem. The myofibrillar fragmentation index (MFI), which is a measure of proteolysis, was significantly higher for muscles aged on bone for at least 24 hours compared to muscles deboned three hours post-slaughter. It is known that meat tenderness improves during post mortem ageing. Results of experiment 4 showed that six days extended ageing of pre-rigor or post-rigor deboned turkey breast muscle significantly improved the meat tenderness. In both muscles deboned at 3 hand 24 h post mortem, there was a 25 % decrease in the shear force values after the 6 -day ageing period. During the ageing period, MFI increased significantly both for muscles deboned at three hours post-slaughter (p = 0. 025) and for the muscles aged on bone for 24 hours prior to deboning (p = 0. 018). Activities of calpain I, II and calpastatin were measured at three different times during post-slaughter ageing (0, 3 and 24 hours) in muscles aged on bone for 24 hours and muscles deboned three hours post-slaughter and then, aged for 24 hours. The activity of calpain I rapidly declined with increasing post mortem time to the extent that only trace levels were detected at three hours, and no calpain activity was detected at 24 hours post mortem. In contrast, there was no loss in calpain II activity over the post mortem period. Calpastatin retained only 35 % of its at-death activity in turkey breast muscle at three hours post-slaughter and there was no calpastatin activity at 24 hours post-slaughter. Furthermore, deboning time had no significant effect on the activity of calpain I, II and calpastatin at 24 hours post mortem. Based on these results, it can be concluded that the observed toughening of turkey breast meat originates from the rapid cooling of turkey carcasses and the three hours post slaughter deboning time. The mechanism of the toughening of turkey breast muscle deboned three hours post mortem is likely to be a direct result of cold shortening rather than reduced calpain activity. This suggests that the reduced proteolysis as measured by MFI is a result of reduced accessibility of the cal pain to myofibrillar protein because of the shortened sarcomere length of muscles deboned at three hours post slaughter and then aged for 24 hours...|$|E
