5|$|The two {{examples}} witness the chthonic {{nature of these}} mythological creatures: a hero can enter the chthonic space and discover the secret of that world, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> allowed to relate that secret to other humans.

5|$|Tytila (died around 616) was a semi-historical pagan king of East Anglia, a small Anglo-Saxon kingdom {{which today}} {{includes}} the English counties of Norfolk and Suffolk. Early sources, including Bede's Ecclesiastical History of the English People, identify {{him as an}} early member of the Wuffingas dynasty who succeeded his father Wuffa. A later chronicle dates his reign from 578, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> known to have definitely ruled as king and nothing of his life is known.

While Daenerys and her entourage go sightseeing at a market, Ser Jorah Mormont receives a pardon for him to return to the Seven Kingdoms from an informant of Lord Varys. Jorah realizes this means the order to assassinate Daenerys has been officially issued and quickly saves her from a wine merchant who tries to poison her.

5|$|The Decepticons {{learn from}} NSA Chief Galloway that Megatron is buried {{deep in the}} Laurentian Abyss. Starscream {{disables}} the Deep-6 aircraft carriers that guard Megatron's remains in the Laurentian Abyss, allowing the Decepticons {{to gain access to}} Megatron's remains. Megatron is revived, and the Decepticons return to the east coast. Megatron disables Optimus Prime and has Starscream destroy a museum that Sam entered, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> among the ruins. They learn he was transported to Cairo, Egypt via a space bridge created by Jetfire. Megatron arrives on the outskirts of Cairo and engages Autobots in combat. Jetfire and Bumblebee challenge him, but are defeated. Elsewhere, Long Haul destroys the Axion Gun that the Autobots gave to the NEST Troops. Megatron learns that The Fallen has betrayed him by promising to make him a Prime, learning that Primes are born, not made. Megatron then destroys him before he can fully activate the Sun Harvester, later hearing from Starscream that Optimus Prime has deactivated the machine. Victorious, he begins plans to form an army of new Decepticons.|$|E
5|$|By the 9th century, {{the crisis}} of the Classic Maya {{collapse}} was sweeping across the region, with populations plummeting and city after city falling into silence. Increasingly endemic warfare in the Maya region caused Tikal's supporting population to heavily concentrate close to the city itself, accelerating the use of intensive agriculture and the corresponding environmental decline. Construction continued {{at the beginning of the}} century, with the erection of Temple 3, the last of the city's major pyramids, and the erection of monuments to mark the 19th K'atun in 810. The beginning of the 10th Bak'tun in 830 passed uncelebrated, and marks the beginning of a 60-year hiatus, probably resulting from the collapse of central control in the city. During this hiatus, satellite sites traditionally under Tikal's control began to erect their own monuments featuring local rulers and using the Mutal emblem glyph, with Tikal apparently lacking the authority or the power to crush these bids for independence. In 849, Jewel K'awiil is mentioned on a stela at Seibal as visiting that city as the Divine Lord of Tikal <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> recorded elsewhere and Tikal's once-great power was little more than a memory. The sites of Ixlu and Jimbal had by now inherited the once exclusive Mutal emblem glyph.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{discovering}} her pregnancy, Quinn convinces Finn {{that he is}} the father, {{despite the}} fact that they never actually had a sexual encounter. Quinn claims that due to his premature ejaculation problem, and during their time in a hot-tub, Finn had ejaculated in the tub and Quinn had received the sperm. The real father is Finn's best friend Puck (Mark Salling), who offers to support Quinn and the baby, but is rejected for his irresponsibility. Quinn decides to have the baby adopted, and agrees to give it to Terri (Jessalyn Gilsig), the wife of glee club director Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison), who is faking a pregnancy. When news of her pregnancy is revealed to the school, Quinn is cut from the cheerleading squad and her popularity declines. Her parents evict her, and Quinn moves in with Finn and his mother. She begins to reconsider having the baby adopted, and gives Puck a chance to prove himself, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> reliable so she returns to her plan of giving the baby to Terri. Quinn blackmails Sue into letting her rejoin the Cheerios, but ultimately decides against it, preferring to remain with the glee club, where she feels accepted. Finn learns the truth about the baby's paternity from Rachel, and breaks up with Quinn. Puck again offers to support her, but she turns him down and tells him that she wants to handle the pregnancy by herself. She moves in with Puck's family, but after forming a friendship with fellow New Directions member Mercedes Jones (Amber Riley), Quinn lives with her family instead. She gives birth to a daughter, named Beth by Puck, who is adopted by Shelby Corcoran (Idina Menzel), coach of rival glee club Vocal Adrenaline and Rachel's biological mother.|$|E

25|$|A grotesquely ugly man {{hired by}} Sakigake to {{investigate}} Tengo and, later, Aomame. He becomes a point-of-view character in part {{three of the}} novel. He is tireless in his investigation, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> a member of Sakigake himself.

They struck, that's all he needs, a SAM site. A protective reaction strike against a SAM site.|$|E

Most scholars view him as a literary fiction, but some have tried to harmonise the Book of Daniel with history by identifying him with various known figures, notably Cyrus or Ugbaru, the general who was first to enter Babylon when it fell to the Persians in 539 BCE.|$|E
25|$|According to Catholic teaching, {{the whole}} of Christ, body and blood, soul and divinity, is in the sacrament, under each of the {{appearances}} of bread and wine and in {{each part of the}} appearances of bread and wine (since the substance of bread or wine is in each part of ordinary bread or wine, and the substance of Christ is in each part of the consecrated and transubstantiated elements of the host and the cup of the sacrament), <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> in the sacrament as in a place and is not moved when the sacrament is moved. He is perceptible neither by the sense nor by the imagination, but only by the intellectual eye.|$|E
25|$|Kennedy is the {{grandson}} of Celtic and Manchester United player Jimmy Delaney, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> related to the Northern Irish footballer John Kennedy, a midfielder who played for Celtic in the 1960s. He came through Celtic's youth system and signed his first professional contract {{on the same day}} as fellow defender Stephen McManus. He made his first-team debut aged 16 during the 1999–00 season. In the 2003–04 season, he had a run in the Celtic starting eleven and came under scrutiny from scouts of AC Milan who contacted Celtic about making a move.
