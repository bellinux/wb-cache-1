25|$|Catastrophic {{environmental}} {{damage caused by}} long-term contamination can also create a ghost town. Some notable examples are Times Beach, Missouri, whose residents were exposed to {{a high level of}} dioxins, and Wittenoom, Western Australia, which was once Australia's largest source of <b>blue</b> <b>asbestos,</b> but was shut down in 1966 due to health concerns. Treece and Picher, twin communities straddling the Kansas–Oklahoma border, were once one of the United States' largest sources of zinc and lead, but over a century of unregulated disposal of mine tailings led to groundwater contamination and lead poisoning in the town's children, eventually resulting in a mandatory Environmental Protection Agency buyout and evacuation. Contamination due to ammunition caused by military use may also lead to the development of ghost towns. Rerik West, an area of Rerik, Germany, had been home to a Group of Soviet Forces in Germany barracks during the German Democratic Republic, but following German reunification it was abandoned due to ammunition contamination from the barracks. Located on a peninsula separated from Rerik by a small isthmus, in 1992 it was turned into a restricted area {{while the rest of the}} town remained populated.|$|E

2500|$|The Railways Department {{attempted}} {{to replace the}} Northerner and Silver Star with a refurbished Silver Star {{which would be a}} 50% seating and 50% sleeper train, redeploy eight 30-seat cars from the Northerner rolling stock to the Wellington - Napier Endeavour service, and relocate the three 32-seat and three 36-seat Endeavour cars to the Christchurch - Picton route, but these plans came to nothing after the Silver Star stock was withdrawn from service and <b>blue</b> <b>asbestos</b> insulation was found inside the coaches. [...] The relevant union refused to work with the dangerous material, and the carriages lay parked in sidings for over ten years while their future was debated. In 1982 Minister of Railways, George Gair, facing a cost of $7 million, for the asbestos removal and modernisation of the carriages, as well as rail losses and demand for other new rail equipment, commission Boston consultants, Booz Allen Hamilton to review NZR and in particular to investigate the most economical way of providing the rail passenger options. The NZ Ministry of Transport refused to accept, NZR estimate that the rebuilt Silver Star would exceed the Northerners patronage by 60% and operate profitably [...] The Railways then suggested that higher utilisation of the rebuilt Silver Star cars would be achieved by using them on both night and day services on the NIMT allowing [...] Silver Fern railcars, to be redeployed on other routes. In 1985 Minister of Railways, Richard Prebble delayed a decision, and [...] with the full cost of removing the <b>blue</b> <b>asbestos</b> and reconstructing the train reaching, $20 million, cancelled the conversion. In line with the Booz Allen Report, which found modern rail car trainsets, vastly more economic [...] than small trains.

2500|$|J.W.Roberts Ltd. {{was founded}} in Armley in 1874 as a textile producer, {{primarily}} working with cotton, hemp and jute. By 1906, its factory on Canal Road, known as the Midland Works, specialised {{in the manufacture of}} asbestos insulation mattresses for steam locomotive boilers and {{is believed to have been}} one of only two factories in the world at the time which processed <b>blue</b> <b>asbestos.</b> In 1920 it merged with Turner Brothers Asbestos Company Ltd., Newalls Insulation Company Ltd., and the Washington Chemical Company Ltd., to form Turner & Newall Ltd., which in 1925 became a public company. T's rapid growth has been attributed to a product called [...] "Sprayed Limpet Asbestos", developed in the Armley works in 1931. This was made by mixing raw asbestos with water and cement, the resulting slurry being spray applicated on to the surface to be insulated, creating a cheap sound- and fireproof coating. Sprayed Limpet Asbestos generated huge profits for T who exported the product to 60 countries where it was applied to a wide range of buildings including schools, churches and theatres and also the London Underground. The factory at Armley closed in 1959.|$|E

40|$|In this survey, {{asbestos}} fiber levels within the breathing zone of employers {{and in the}} environment of an asbestos-cement factory were monitored on membrane filter and counted by phase contrast optical microscope considering length/diameter> 3 :I (Asbestos International Associational method). The plant was fairly old and utilized both white (chrysotile) and <b>blue</b> (chrocidolite) <b>asbestos.</b> In each workshop, 8 -h time-weighted average concentrations (Ctw,) or its equivalent were calculated as fiber/ml. Average and range of concentrations were determined as well. Results indicated that {{asbestos fiber}}s were dispersed all over the plant and major sources of emission were mills (raw materials and waste products) and finishing. In addition, longer daily shift durations (12 -h) increased workers’ exposure levels more than 2 times than that of 8 -h shift (&# 945;= 0. 05, t 0. 95. 17).

40|$|South Africa&# 039;s {{gold mines}} {{are the largest}} and {{historically}} among the most profitable in the world. Yet at what human cost? This book reveals how the mining industry, abetted by a minority state, hid a pandemic of silicosis for almost a century and allowed miners infected with tuberculosis to spread disease to rural communities in South Africa and to labour-sending states. In the twentieth century, South African mines twice faced a crisis over silicosis, which put its workers at risk of contracting pulmonary tuberculosis, often fatal. The first crisis, 1896 - 1912, saw the mining industry invest heavily in reducing dust and South Africa became renowned for its mine safety. The second began in 2000 with mounting scientific evidence that the disease rate among miners {{is more than a}} hundred times higher than officially acknowledged. The first crisis also focused upon disease among the minority white miners: the current crisis is about black migrant workers, and is subject to major class actions for compensation.

40|$|The <b>blue</b> {{amphibole}} <b>asbestos,</b> crocidolite, {{which occurs}} as interbedded seams in banded ironstones of the Lower Griquatown {{stage of the}} Transvaal System in the Northern Cape Province, is the finely fibrous form of the soda-amphibole riebeckite. Despite the widespread occurrence of the Precambrian type of banded ironstones, crocidolite is a mineral of rare occurrence and is only developed to a relatively minor extent in South Africa, Western Australia and Central China. The composition, structure and properties of riebeckite {{in general and of}} crocidolite in particular are discussed and four new chemical analyses are given. Particular attention is paid to the mode of occurrence of fibrous riebeckite and it is suggested that the name "crocidolite" be reserved for the asbestiform riebeckite which occurs interbedded with banded ironstones. The general geology, lithology and mineralogy of Precambrian banded ironstones are described and their distribution in space and time is discussed. It is found that no banded ironstones are known to be younger than 1000 million years. This fact is related to special conditions of atmosphere, surface temperature and biological development which existed during the so-called Primitive Period of the Precambrian, a period which lasted from approximately 3000 million years to 1000 million years ago. The banded ironstones of the Transvaal System are described in some detail and seven new chemical analyses as well as trace element data are given. The genesis of banded ironstones is discussed at some length and particular attention is paid to the authigenesis of riebeckite. It is concluded that banded ironstones were deposited in seasonally fluctuating, typically "non-aggressive", fresh to brackish water lakes which were fed by sluggish, mature rivers. The solutions of iron and silica, alkaline earths and clay colloids carried by these rivers were derived from basic igneous rocks by chemical weathering in a tropical, monsoon-type climate. Recognisable detrital material is virtually absent from the banded ironstones of the Transvaal System, but it is thought that the stilpnomelane layers are aeolian deposits and that their composition gives some indication of the material which remained behind as "lateritic" soils in the source area. It is suggested that both crocidolite and riebeckite were formed by the low temperature dehydration, in situ, of an ordered precursor which could have been a clay mineral similar in structure to attapulgite, but containing ferrous and ferric ions in the octahedral layer. This clay mineral acquired sodium by cation exchange during dry periods when the depositional lakes were enriched in sodium. It is found that the actual formation of crocidolite is completely unrelated to dynamic stress. It formed only where layers of proto-riebeckite were in close contact or traversed by magnetite layers. It grew by the diffusion of proto-riebeckite through the magnetite layers, its transformation to riebeckite during its passage, and final addition to fibre growth points in contact with the magnetite layer. This process was initiated by slight temperature gradients in the magnetite layers and was propagated by a type of thermal autocatalysis. The temperature gradients in the magnetite layers resulted from their superior heat conductivity combined with differences in depth of burial of the strata. Economic deposits of crocidolite formed where a sufficient number of layers of protoriebeckite were in contact with magnetite layers which maintained or repeatedly attained the requisite temperature levels. The superimposed economic deposits of the Kuruman area, which appear to be related to folding, are due to an early period of folding, possibly even slumping during deposition, which took place prior to the formation of crocidolite and caused the thickening of the protoriebeckite layers in the crests and troughs of folds by plastic flow from the flanks. Three appendices, giving details of chemical and spectrographic analyses and of chemical experiments carried out, are attached...|$|R
