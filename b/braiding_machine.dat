50|$|Maypole braiders work by a {{circular}} braiding process. They were {{well suited to}} be driven by the steam engines of the industrial revolution and were common {{by the beginning of the}} 20th century being easily powered by electric motors. Common types of braiding machines work in much the same way as the process of decorating a maypole. At the start of decorating a maypole an even number of ribbons tied to the top of the pole. A group of people form a ring about the base of the pole and take a ribbon in hand. Half the people then travel clockwise and the other half counter clockwise. When the people pass one another they pass alternately to the right and to the left. This results in a downward forming braid on the pole. As the braid works its way down the pole, the ribbons become shorter and the angle of forming changes as the braid works lower on the pole. On a standard <b>braiding</b> <b>machine,</b> the supply lines are a constant angle and at a constant tension and hence the output braided product is uniform.|$|E

50|$|In 1960, Wim van der Lee and {{his manager}} made {{old and new}} rope-making {{technologies}} meet. They designed large <b>braiding</b> <b>machines</b> that could manufacture heavy hawsers for the shipping and off-shore industries. The ropes for these hawsers were twisted on the old ropewalk.The industry {{was faced with a}} major challenge in 1965 when the first synthetic yarn hit the markets which had many times the resistance of manila, and, additionally, is impervious. With developments in the synthetic industry taking place at breakneck speed, the family decided to buy into synthetic fibre, which meant closing their own spinning mill.On 1 July 1984, Wim van der Lee’s daughter and son, Saskia and Gijsbert van der Lee, and their cousin Willem Hendrik Schreijgrond, the oldest son of Christina van der Lee, who is Wim van der Lee’s sister, were appointed as supervisory directors alongside Johan Joseph Breen.Bernhard de Wit was appointed as director. By importing raw materials the family could now specialise. This change in production led to a new factory being built in 1993. Van der Lee’s product range, which is made using modern scutchers and <b>braiding</b> <b>machines,</b> now largely varies to include all kinds of ropes, yet the old craft still lives on at the G. van der Lee Rope Factory; hawsers for fisheries, water sport and replicas of VOC ships and the ropes are still twisted on the 350-metre long ropewalk.|$|R
50|$|<b>Braiding</b> <b>machines,</b> {{although}} they have an apparent complex movement of bobbins, are mechanically simple and robust. Modern versions are very reliable and consequently can operate for many hours or even days without attention. This has enabled factories with hundreds of machines to be operated by just a few workers, reducing wages, and making products cheaper and/or profits higher. These modern machines have incorporated electronic controls with automated controls. Although ropes, cords and fishing line are still the core products of most braiding companies {{there are many other}} products including webbing, cable shielding and automotive products such as reinforced brake lines.|$|R
40|$|A {{machine for}} {{producing}} bias weaves (thick, multiaxial weaves) is presented. It {{consists of a}} fill/warp weaving apparatus superimposed on a general <b>braiding</b> <b>machine.</b> The <b>braiding</b> <b>machine</b> consists {{of a set of}} moveable columns which hold spools of bias fibers, and a mechanism to shift spools from one column to the next. Jacquard-movable warp fibers run between the columns. This machine allows the use of a beat-up mechanism that {{does not need to be}} removed from the weave. A large set of braids which are produceable on the proposed bias-weaving machine are described, along with the machine operations required to produce them. The design of a tension-regulating thread package for use in this bias-weaving machine is also presented. This mechanism can take-up a finite amount of thread and is insensitive to friction variations. The design was chosen based on the systematic development and elimination of alternative designs. It may be easily adapted to other uses-a shuttle is given as an example. by Jonathan D. RohrsThesis (S. M.) [...] Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Dept. of Mechanical Engineering, 2003.

30|$|In a real {{braiding}} process, {{the natural}} forming point occurs {{somewhere between the}} forming ring and the carriers. This position depends on parameters such as take-up speed, yarn fineness and yarn-to-yarn coefficient of friction. The smaller the take-up speed, the higher the coefficient of friction and the coarser the yarn, the closer the natural forming point will be to the carriers. In the FE model, the yarns were modelled as converging {{to the center of}} the <b>braiding</b> <b>machine</b> and, when the simulation started, they were pulled from the take-up node (Fig.  5 b) in the positive y-direction through the forming ring at a speed equal to the real <b>braiding</b> <b>machine</b> take-up speed υtu. Based on experimental observations, the position of the take-up nodes relative to the carriers was adjusted depending on the take-up speed to be as close as possible to where the braid would form in a real braiding process. Opposite to the take-up nodes, linear elastic springs modelled with discrete elements, were attached to each yarn end to simulate the carrier tensioning springs (0.2 N was the effective pre-tension applied by the springs to the attached yarns). These springs, as in a real carrier, were restrained to move in the y-direction during their movement on the x-z plane, and were used to maintain a uniform tension in the yarns throughout the braiding simulation. The tension of the yarns at the beginning of the virtual braiding process was not uniform among different yarns. This is because of the difference in the yarn length and the relative position of the yarns with respect to the forming point. In order to even out the tension in each yarn before the starting of the braiding process, the springs were pulled in the negative y-direction for two seconds while keeping the uppermost nodes fully constrained. From their initial position, the eyelets and the yarn ends with springs were moved along a prescribed path established by Eq. 10 on the x-z plane. Their velocity was equal to the maximum carriers’ velocity of the <b>braiding</b> <b>machine</b> used for the manufacture of microbraids.|$|E

40|$|The {{operating}} principles of two prototype <b>braiding</b> <b>machines</b> {{for the production}} of generalized braid patterns are described. Both processes afford previously unachievable control of the interlacing of fibers within a textile structure that make them especially amenable to the fabrication of textile preforms for composite materials. They enable independent control of the motion of the individual fibers being woven, thereby enabling the greatest possible freedom in controlling fiber orientation within a structure. This freedom enables the designer to prescribe local fiber orientation to better optimize material performance. The processes have been implemented on a very small scale but at a level that demonstrates their practicality and the soundness of the principles governing their operation...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} a comprehensive series of mechanical tests performed on two high performance polymeric fibres, microbraids and microbraid reinforced polymer composites (mBRPC).

Quasi-static tensile tests performed on mBRPC showed improved mechanical properties, for certain architectures, with respect to those noted for unidirectional composites manufactured using same technique...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This study proposes {{coronary}} stents in {{a manner}} of reticular tube, which are made by applying a braiding method. Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) plied yarns are braided into hollow braids on a 16 -spindle <b>braid</b> <b>machine,</b> followed by being cross-link treated to form the coronary stents. The surface observation and a compressive test are used to evaluate the resulting products. The test results show that cross-link treatment does not pertain to the reticular, tubular manner of the braids. However, a low cross-linking concentration results in a light shade and a greater compressive strength in the coronary stents. In addition, the acidification of the cross-linking solution affects the compressive modulus. The coronary stents presented by this study are proved to be biodegradable and have compressive strength and a reticular-and-tubular form...|$|R

30|$|Braiding {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{technique}} employed for the manufacture of fabrics and ropes. It is also commonly used to produce near-net shaped preforms for advanced fibre reinforced composites. This paper presents an explicit finite element approach to create and simulate the braiding process for the virtual manufacture of 2 D braids. The process starts from the definition of an analytical function which describes the movement of the carriers on a braiding track plate. Models of idealised Maypole-type <b>braiding</b> <b>machines</b> are built and used to shape virtual yarns into braids. This procedure can be used in a parameter control fashion, to optimise or to create virtual braided structures, which can serve as input for other structural analyses. It is emphasised that multiple cylinders are required for the modelling of a multifilament yarn to achieve better correlation with the experimental results. A parametric study is presented to investigate the effect of the number of virtual cylinders to represent a real yarn and the shape of the final braid. Excellent correlation was found between the virtual models and the experimental results when comparing the braid angle and yarn width.|$|R

40|$|The {{development}} of prototype <b>braiding</b> <b>machines</b> {{for the production}} of generalized braid patterns is described. Mechanical operating principles and control strategies are presented for two prototype machines which have been fabricated and evaluated. Both machines represent advances over current fabrication techniques for composite materials by enabling nearly ideal control of fiber orientations within preform structures. They permit optimum design of parts that might be subjected to complex loads or that have complex forms. Further, they overcome both the lack of general control of produced fiber architectures and the complexity of other weaving processes that have been proposed for the same purpose. One prototype, the Farley braider, consists of an array of turntables that can be made to oscillate in 90 degree steps. Yarn ends are transported about the surface formed by the turntables by motorized tractors which are controlled through an optical link with the turntables and powered through electrical contact with the turntables. The necessary relative motions are produced by a series of linear tractor moves combined with a series of turntable rotations. As the tractors move about, they weave the yarn ends into the desired pattern. The second device, the shuttle plate braider, consists of a braiding surface formed by an array of stationary square sections, each separated from its neighbors by a gap. A plate beneath this surface is caused to reciprocate in two perpendicular directions, first in one direction and then in the other. This movement is made possibly by openings in the plate that clear short columns supporting the surface segments. Yarn ends are moved about the surface and interwoven by shuttles which engage the reciprocating plate as needed to yield the desired movements. Power and control signals are transmitted to the shuttles through electrical contact with the braiding surface. The shuttle plate is a passively driven prime mover that supplies the power to move all shuttles and the shuttles are simple devices that employ only a solenoid to engage the shuttle plate on command. Each shuttle is assigned a unique identity and is controlled independently. When compared to each other, the Farley braider is felt to have the advantage of speed and the shuttle plate braider, the advantage of simplicity...|$|R
