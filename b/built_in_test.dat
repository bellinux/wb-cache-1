50|$|The Grifo M3 was {{developed}} specifically {{to fit the}} Mirage III {{and has been in}} full operation on the Mirage III since 2001. It has a power consumption of 200 W, operates in the X-band and is compatible with IR guided, semi-active and active radar guided missiles. The circular antenna has a diameter of 47 cm. The radar has over 30 different operational air-to-air/air-to-surface mission and navigation modes. Air to air modes include Single/Dual Target Track and Track While Scan. Air to surface modes include Real Beam Map, Doppler Beam Sharpening, Sea Low/High, Ground Moving Target Indicator, Ground/Sea Moving Target Track. Other optional modes include Raid Assessment, Non Cooperative Target Identification, SAR (synthetic aperture radar) and Precision Velocity Update. Low, medium and high pulse repetition frequencies reduce effects of ground clutter. Digital adaptive pulse compression technology, dual channel receiver, scanning coverage +/-60 degrees in both azimuth and elevation, air cooling, weighs less than 91 kg, MTBF (flight guaranteed) over 220 hours.

40|$|Abstract – Idealy, {{everyone}} {{would like to}} embed test into their products today, whether it’s to reduce costs, build in support capabilities, ensure better quality, reduce dependacy on expert technicians, or for one of many other intelligent motivations. However, it seems the technology of <b>Built</b> <b>in</b> <b>Test</b> (BIT) has not taken off or been adopted like many believed it would. The reasons for this poor adoption are diverse: some blame it on design, others fault product specifications and even others {{blame it on the}} fundementals of the technology itself. The underlying root cause of slow BIT adoption may be a result of an inaccurate belief that designing an embedded test is more difficult than designing any other test. In reality, understanding what to embed is simply a function of knowing the coverage you are seeking and at what level {{you want to be able}} to diagnose the problem when a failure occurs. Presented in this paper are several considerations on how to best approach <b>Built</b> <b>in</b> <b>Test.</b> This preferred approach is illustrated by explaining the importance of understanding how to achieve effective and appropriate coverage levels, while also maintaining a useful level of diagnostic resolution. Understanding and application of these concepts will effectively enable optimal design and implementation of <b>Built</b> <b>in</b> <b>Test.</b> I...|$|E

Work pertaining to {{this project is}} associated with a system done at the Litton Guidance/Control Systems Division in Woodland Hills, California. The purpose of the datalink interface is to process information between the Guidance System and an aircraft Central Processing System. The interface is designed around the Intel 8039 Microprocessor. The project consists of a time of day interface, <b>built</b> <b>in</b> <b>test</b> functions, uplink interface and a downlink interface. The downlink and uplink sections will control the flow of information to and from the Central Processing System. Both interfaces are serial interfaces with the downlink running at a continuous 50 KHz and the uplink running at a gated 5 KHz. The time of day interface is also serial and is used for synchronization purposes. The <b>built</b> <b>in</b> <b>test</b> functions are used to verify proper operation of the downlink and uplink interfaces.
