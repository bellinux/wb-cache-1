This evokes the imagery of Ader's works around the theme of falling and the myth surrounding Ader's disappearance at sea. [...] Horvitz's book “Sad, Depressed People” relates back to Ader's movie “I'm too sad to tell you” in that all of the stock images Horvitz collected show people with their heads in their hands, as does Ader.|$|R

60|$|Then {{he strode}} more quickly down the forest side towards the building, which now {{revealed}} its austere proportions, though Dick {{could see that}} they were mitigated by a strange, formal flower-garden, with quaint statues and fountains. There were grim <b>black</b> allees of <b>clipped</b> trees, a curiously wrought iron gate, and twisted iron espaliers. On one side the edifice was supported by a great stone terrace, which seemed to him as broad as a Parisian boulevard. Yet everywhere it appeared sleeping in the desertion and silence of the summer twilight. The evening breeze swayed the lace curtains at the tall windows, but nothing else moved. To the unsophisticated Western man it looked like a scene on the stage.|$|R
40|$|The use {{of black}} leaf-clips for dark {{adaptation}} under high solar radiation conditions {{is reported to}} underestimate the maximum quantum yield of PSII photochemistry (Fv/Fm) measured by the continuous-excitation fluorometer Pocket PEA. The decrease in Fv/Fm was due to a rise in minimum fluorescence emission (Fo), probably resulting from increased leaf temperature (Tl). In field-grown tomato and pepper, fluorescence parameters and Tl in the region covered by the <b>black</b> leaf <b>clip</b> were measured in clipped leaves exposed to solar radiation during dark adaptation (clipped-only leaves) and in clipped leaves protected from solar radiation by aluminium foil (shrouded clipped leaves). Results confirmed significant Fv/Fm underestimates in clipped-only leaves primarily due to increased Fo. In one tomato experiment, Tl increased from 30 to 44. 5 °C in clipped-only leaves, with a negligible rise in shrouded clipped leaves. In two respective pepper experiments, Tl in clipped-only leaves increased from 27 to 36. 2 °C and 33 to 40. 9 °C. Based {{on the results of}} this study, a clip-effect parameter (PCE) on fluorescence emission is proposed as the difference for Fv/Fm (or –Fo/Fm) between shrouded clipped leaves and clipped-only leaves, which resulted to be 0. 706 for tomato, and 0. 241 and 0. 358 for the two pepper experiments...|$|R

25|$|The {{music video}} {{features}} {{the members of}} The Dells, who recorded both the single featured in the music video and the version featured in the movie.
