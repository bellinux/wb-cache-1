5|$|Saleh has {{repeatedly}} stated that Afghan intelligence believed and had shared information about Osama Bin Laden hiding {{in an area}} close to Abbottabad, Pakistan, four years before he (Bin Laden) was killed there. Saleh had shared the information with Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf who had angrily <b>brushed</b> <b>off</b> the claim taking no action.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, Saleh engaged several NDS agents infiltrating the Pakistani {{tribal areas}} {{to search for}} bin Laden and other al-Qaeda and Taliban leaders. Several al-Qaeda members could be identified, but it was {{determined}} that Bin Laden was not in the area. In 2006, Saleh was presented with evidence that bin Laden was living in a major settled area of Pakistan just 20 miles from the town of Abbottabad, Pakistan. He shared the intelligence with former Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf who angrily <b>brushed</b> <b>off</b> the claim, taking no action.|$|E
5|$|When collected, {{the skin}} of the cap is left intact, and dirt is <b>brushed</b> <b>off</b> the surface. Pores are left unless old and soft. Boletus aereus is {{especially}} suited for drying, a process which enhances its flavour and aroma. Like other boletes, the mushrooms can be dried by being sliced and strung separately on twine, then hung close to the ceiling of a kitchen. Alternatively, the mushrooms can be dried by cleaning with a brush (washing is not recommended), and then placed in a wicker basket or bamboo steamer on top of a boiler or hot water tank. Once dry, they are kept in an airtight jar. They are easily reconstituted by soaking in hot, but not boiling, water for about twenty minutes; the water is infused with the mushroom aroma and can be used as stock in subsequent cooking. When dried, a small amount of the mushroom can improve the taste of less flavoursome fungi-based dishes.|$|E

25|$|After Napoleon's abdication, Ambert {{received}} the Commander's Cross of the Légion d'Honneur on 9 November 1814. He also {{was decorated with}} the Order of Saint Louis, probably at this time. In 1815 he held command of the 9th Military Division. When Napoleon landed, Ambert tried to give him advice but was <b>brushed</b> <b>off.</b> Nevertheless, he rallied to Napoleon during the Hundred Days and was asked to defend {{the line of the}} Ourcq Canal.

In hot weather, staphylococcal infection of the hair follicles and sweat glands can lead to severe and painful dermatitis.|$|E

25|$|Apollinaire {{described}} the Herbst salon of 1913 {{as the first}} Orphist Salon. There were many works by Robert and Sonia Delaunay, in addition to abstract works by Picabia and Cubist works by Metzinger, Gleizes, Léger {{and a large number}} of Futurist paintings. This exhibition was a turning-point in Apollinaire’s artistic strategy for Orphism. After becoming entangled through some remarks in an argument between Delaunay and Umberto Boccioni about the ambiguousness of the term ‘simultaneity’ he did not use the term Orphism again in his art related articles. The artists labeled Orphists also <b>brushed</b> <b>off</b> the term and developed stylistic trends of their own.|$|E
25|$|Within the British Government, meanwhile, concern {{had grown}} about {{the welfare of}} Maori and {{increasing}} lawlessness among the 2000 British subjects in New Zealand, who were concentrated in the Bay of Islands. Because {{of the population of}} British subjects there, officials believed colonisation was now inevitable {{and at the end of}} 1838 the decision was made to appoint a Consul as a prelude to the declaration of British sovereignty over New Zealand. And when Lord Glenelg was replaced as Colonial Secretary in late February, his successor, Lord Normanby, immediately <b>brushed</b> <b>off</b> demands from the New Zealand Colonisation Association for the royal charter that had been previously offered to the New Zealand Association.|$|E
25|$|At the 2005 UK Championship, held in York, Davis {{reached his}} 100th major career final, {{and made his}} first {{appearance}} in the UK final since 1990. En route he beat defending champion Stephen Maguire 9–8, a win which included a 145 break; and then Stephen Hendry 9–6 in the semi-finals to reach the final, where he lost 6–10 against Ding Junhui. Before the World Championships Davis <b>brushed</b> <b>off</b> suggestions of retirement, and he reached the second round, where he lost to Murphy. Davis's performances through the 2006/2007 season, including reaching the UK Championship quarter-finals and the Welsh Open semi-finals, ensured {{he was still a}} top 16 player at the age of 50.|$|E

25|$|In mid 2008 {{after the}} {{indictment}} had been served, {{it was discovered}} that the main police investigator in the preliminary investigation had started working for one of the plaintiffs, Warner Brothers, before the date of the indictment. Sunde's lawyer Peter Althin questioned the neutrality and reliability of the preliminary investigation in the event that the investigator had entered the new employment during the investigation, and suspected the job might have been a reward for good work in The Pirate Bay investigation. Althin believed that the investigation might have to be redone if that was the case. The prosecutor Håkan Roswall responded that it wouldn't have posed problems for the investigation because the police were working under his directive, and the investigator's superior officer <b>brushed</b> <b>off</b> the incident as nothing remarkable. Warner Brothers commented merely that the investigator hadn't received any compensation during the time he worked for the Swedish police. According to Roswall, this type of concurrent employment would not be an individual incident, but that the decision of possible bias would be for the court to decide, and that the investigator is not a key witness in the case. The investigator could not be reached during the trial and was taken off the witness list.|$|E

[...] "They sensed that something was afoot, but their superiors <b>brushed</b> <b>off</b> their fears," [...] Binda says. [...] "The senior Rhodesian authorities had been lulled into a sense of arrogant self-confidence based on the security forces' past successes." [...] This false veneer of security was smashed on 21 December 1972 when a group of ten ZANLA cadres led by Rex Nhongo attacked the white-owned Altena Farm near the north-eastern village of Centenary, about [...] west of Mount Darwin.|$|E
500|$|Gavin Fuller of The Daily Telegraph {{said the}} episode was good but lacked {{significant}} background motivation into the villains. Fuller also noted {{the revelation of}} River Song being Amy's grown up child [...] "is perhaps a narrative strand which would sit uncomfortably with a series where loss has often been <b>brushed</b> <b>off</b> {{as soon as the}} next couple of episodes". However, he did have praise for the performance of Smith's Doctor, commenting [...] "the last few weeks have seen Matt Smith's Doctor in a welcome generally more serious vein, which he kept up here, with leavening at the right moments where his alien lack of comfort with human emotions, although used to comic effect, rang very true, as did his awkwardness when discovering the truth about River".|$|E

[...] Rowe views Hudson as a codification of an issue decided by public opinion, including during the 1800 presidential election: [...] "Hudson set onto tablets the principles that guided the Jeffersonians during their wanderings in the desert." ...|$|E
