5|$|Linezolid has no {{clinically}} {{significant effect on}} most Gram-negative bacteria. Pseudomonas and the Enterobacteriaceae, for instance, are not susceptible. In vitro, it is active against Pasteurella multocida, Fusobacterium, Moraxella catarrhalis, Legionella, <b>Bordetella,</b> and Elizabethkingia meningoseptica, and moderately active (having a minimum inhibitory concentration for 90% of strains of 8mg/L) against Haemophilus influenzae. It has also been used to great effect as a second-line treatment for Capnocytophaga infections.|$|E
5|$|Guinea pigs do not {{generally}} thrive when housed with other species. Housing of guinea pigs with other rodents such as gerbils and hamsters may increase instances of respiratory and other infections, and such rodents may act aggressively toward the guinea pig. Larger animals may regard guinea pigs as prey, though some (such as dogs) {{can be trained}} to accept them. Opinion is divided over the cohousing of guinea pigs and domestic rabbits. Some published sources say that guinea pigs and rabbits complement each other well when sharing a cage. However, as lagomorphs, rabbits have different nutritional requirements, so the two species cannot be fed the same food. Rabbits may also harbor diseases (such as respiratory infections from <b>Bordetella</b> and Pasteurella), to which guinea pigs are susceptible. Even the dwarf rabbit is much stronger than the guinea pig and may cause intentional or inadvertent injury.|$|E
25|$|This {{family is}} also known as Ptx and {{contains}} the toxin responsible for whooping cough. Pertussis toxin is secreted by the gram-negative bacterium, <b>Bordetella</b> pertussis. Whooping cough is very contagious and cases are slowly increasing in the United States despite vaccination. Symptoms include paroxysmal cough with whooping and even vomiting. The bacterium <b>Bordetella</b> pertussis was first identified as the cause of whooping cough and isolated by Jules Bordet and Octave Gengou in France in 1900.|$|E
25|$|Organisms {{spread by}} droplet {{transmission}} include respiratory viruses (e.g., influenza, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus), <b>Bordetella</b> pertussis, pneumococci, diphtheria, and rubella.|$|E
25|$|Pertussis {{is caused}} by the {{bacterium}} <b>Bordetella</b> pertussis. It is an airborne disease which spreads easily through the coughs and sneezes of an infected person.|$|E
25|$|Kennel cough is an {{infectious}} respiratory disease {{which can be}} caused by one of several viruses or by <b>Bordetella</b> bronchiseptica. It most commonly occurs in dogs in close confinement such as kennels.|$|E
25|$|<b>Bordetella</b> bronchiseptica {{has been}} {{identified}} in cats with owners that also are infected with this pathogen. Individuals having this infection have usually been cancer or transplant patients. Those with this infection can develop serious pneumonia.|$|E
25|$|In {{more than}} 90% of cases {{the cause is}} a viral infection. These viruses may be spread through the air when people cough or by direct contact. Risk factors include {{exposure}} to tobacco smoke, dust, and other air pollution. A small number of cases are due {{to high levels of}} air pollution or bacteria such as Mycoplasma pneumoniae or <b>Bordetella</b> pertussis.|$|E
25|$|Pertussis {{is caused}} by the {{bacterium}} <b>Bordetella</b> pertussis. It is an airborne disease which spreads easily through the coughs and sneezes of an infected person. People are infectious to others from the start of symptoms until about three weeks into the coughing fits. Those treated with antibiotics are no longer infectious after five days. Diagnosis is by collecting a sample {{from the back of the}} nose and throat. This sample can then be tested by either culture or by polymerase chain reaction.|$|E
25|$|Acute {{bronchitis}} {{usually has}} a cough that lasts around three weeks. In more than 90% of cases {{the cause is}} a viral infection. These viruses may be spread through the air when people cough or by direct contact. Risk factors include exposure to tobacco smoke, dust, and other air pollution. A small number of cases are due {{to high levels of}} air pollution or bacteria such as Mycoplasma pneumoniae or <b>Bordetella</b> pertussis. Treatment of acute bronchitis typically involves rest, paracetamol (acetaminophen), and NSAIDs to help with the fever.|$|E
25|$|An {{increase}} in lymphocyte concentration {{is usually a}} sign of a viral infection (in some rare case, leukemias are found through an abnormally raised lymphocyte count in an otherwise normal person). A high lymphocyte count with a low neutrophil count might be caused by lymphoma. Pertussis toxin (PTx) of <b>Bordetella</b> pertussis, formerly known as lymphocytosis-promoting factor, causes a decrease in the entry of lymphocytes into lymph nodes, which can lead to a condition known as lymphocytosis, with a complete lymphocyte count of over 4000 per μl in adults or over 8000 per μl in children. This is unique in that many bacterial infections illustrate neutrophil-predominance instead.|$|E
25|$|Sulfatide {{acts as a}} {{glycolipid}} receptor that {{functions to}} aid in the adherence of these bacteria to the mucosal surface. Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae and Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae are pathogens that cause respiratory disease in swine. Haemophilus influenza, <b>Bordetella</b> pertussis, Mycoplasma pneumonia, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa cause respiratory disease in humans. Accordingly, sulfatide is located in the tracheas of both human and swine, and through the use of sulfatide present in the trachea, these several bacteria are capable of adherence to the respiratory tract. Hsp-70 on the outside of H. influenzae, has also been shown {{to aid in the}} ability of this bacteria to bind to sulfatide.|$|E
25|$|Rhamnolipids {{have long}} been {{reported}} to have antimicrobial properties. They {{have been shown to}} have activity against a range of bacteria including Serratia marcescens, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus subtilis with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) ranging from 0.5µg/mL to 32µg/mL. Activity against several fungi such as Fusarium solani and Penicillium funiculosum have also been observed with MICs of 75µg/mL and 16µg/mL respectively. Rhamnolipids have been suggested as antimicrobials able to remove <b>Bordetella</b> bronchiseptica biofilms. The mode of killing has been shown to result from intercalation of rhamnolipids into the cell membrane causing pores to form which result in cell lysis, at least in the case of Bacillus subtilis. The anti-microbial action of rhamnolipids may provide a fitness advantage for Pseudomonas aeruginosa by excluding other microorganisms from the colonised niche. Furthermore, rhamnolipids have been shown to have anti-viral and zoosporicidal activities. The antimicrobial properties of rhamnolipids may confer a fitness advantage for Pseudomonas aeruginosa in niche colonisation as Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a soil bacterium, as well as competing with other bacteria in the cystic fibrosis lung.|$|E
2500|$|A {{number of}} {{different}} bacteria can infect the human throat. [...] The most common is Group A streptococcus, but others include Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, <b>Bordetella</b> pertussis, Bacillus anthracis, Corynebacterium diphtheriae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae.|$|E
2500|$|For dogs {{expected}} to board, be shown, or {{to enter a}} kennel situation within 6 months, vets may recommend administering <b>Bordetella,</b> which protects again a respiratory illness commonly known as [...] "kennel cough" [...] in addition to canine parainfluenza virus (another kennel cough agent).|$|E
2500|$|For cats {{expected}} to board, be shown, or {{to enter a}} kennel situation within 6 months, vets may recommend administering <b>Bordetella,</b> which protects again a respiratory illness commonly known as [...] "kennel cough." [...] However, studies have not shown this product to reduce severity of the feline respiratory disease complex.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are some}} {{bacteria}} that are contagious from dog to dog. [...] The most notable {{of these are}} <b>Bordetella</b> bronchiseptica, one {{of the causes of}} kennel cough, Leptospira sp, which cause leptospirosis, and Brucella canis, cause of brucellosis in dogs. [...] There are also common tick-borne bacterial diseases, including Lyme disease, ehrlichiosis, and Rocky Mountain spotted fever.|$|E
2500|$|Cases of {{veterinary}} vaccines used in humans have been documented, whether intentional or accidental, with some cases of resultant illness, most notably with brucellosis. [...] However, {{the reporting of}} such cases is rare and very little has been studied about the safety and results of such practices. [...] With the advent of aerosol vaccination in veterinary clinics for companion animals, human exposure to pathogens that are not naturally carried in humans, such as <b>Bordetella</b> bronchiseptica, has likely increased in recent years. [...] In some cases, most notably rabies, the parallel veterinary vaccine against a pathogen may {{be as much as}} orders of magnitude more economical than the human one.|$|E
2500|$|Vaccinations are an {{important}} preventative animal health measure. The specific vaccinations recommended for dogs varies depending on geographic location, environment, travel history, and the activities the animal frequently engages in. In the United States, regardless {{of any of these}} factors, it is usually highly recommended that dogs be vaccinated against rabies, canine parvovirus, canine distemper, and infectious canine hepatitis (using canine adenovirus type 2 to avoid reaction). [...] The decision on whether to vaccinate against other diseases, including leptospirosis, Lyme disease, <b>Bordetella</b> bronchiseptica, parainfluenza virus, and canine coronavirus, should be made between an owner and a veterinarian, taking into account factors specific to the dog.|$|E
50|$|DA2PPC {{does not}} include <b>Bordetella.</b> But the {{combination}} of <b>Bordetella</b> with DA2PPC prevents kennel cough, by preventing adenovirus, distemper, parainfluenza, and <b>Bordetella.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Bordetella</b> {{endotoxins}} {{are unique}} to the genus, species, and strain. B. trematum is the only <b>Bordetella</b> species with a semirough lipopolysaccharide which contains a single O-unit. The lipid A unit of B. trematum is identical {{to that of the}} opportunistic bacterium B. hinzii, but unlike any other <b>Bordetella</b> species.|$|E
50|$|<b>Bordetella</b> holmesii is a Gram-negative, {{rod-shaped}} bacterium of {{the genus}} <b>Bordetella.</b> It was named in recognition of Barry Holmes, a biologist. It is asaccharolytic, oxidase-negative, and nonmotile, producing a brown pigment. It is associated with septicemia, endocarditis, and respiratory illness, especially in immunocompromised patients, such as asplenic or AIDS patients.It is often seen in conjunction with <b>Bordetella</b> pertussis infections (whooping cough), although not always.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Bordetella</b> bronchiseptica is a small, Gram-negative, {{rod-shaped}} bacterium of {{the genus}} <b>Bordetella.</b> It can cause infectious bronchitis in dogs and other animals, [...] but rarely infects humans. Closely related to B. pertussis - the obligate human pathogen that causes pertussis (whooping cough); B. bronchiseptica can persist in the environment for extended periods.|$|E
5000|$|DNA-rRNA {{hybridization}} {{was used}} to place B. trematum LMG 13506T in the Alcaligenaceae family. [...] Amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis revealed a 94% similarity between the B. trematum reference strain and the Bordatella reference species, B. pertussis. [...] Later, additional evidence to determine placement at the genus level came from DNA-DNA hybridization of B. trematum strains LMG 13506 and LMG 14446 against reference strains of other <b>Bordetella</b> and Alcaligenes species. Results showed the species B. trematum to be most like members of the <b>Bordetella</b> genus. [...] SDS-PAGE analysis of whole-cell proteins allowed for development of a dendrogram displaying that <b>Bordetella</b> is not a monophyletic genus. [...] DNA-rRNA hybridization and 16S rRNA sequence analysis shows a close relationship between <b>Bordetella</b> and Alcaligenes. [...] It {{is often difficult to}} differentiate between the two genera; in fact, some species across the genera are phenotypically identical.|$|E
