5|$|Among the 15 known {{isotopes}} of mendelevium (mass {{numbers from}} 245 to 260), the most studied is 256Md, which mainly decays through the electron capture (α-radiation is ≈10%) with the half-life of 77 minutes. Another alpha emitter, 258Md, has a half-life of 53 days. <b>Both</b> <b>these</b> isotopes are produced from rare einsteinium (253Es and 255Es respectively), that therefore limits their availability.|$|E
5|$|An {{abortive}} {{effort to}} support the French invasion fleet was also made by the Navy of the Batavian Republic, which despatched the small frigates Furie and Waakzaamheid to Ireland with military supplies on 24 October. Within hours of leaving port, <b>both</b> <b>these</b> ships were intercepted and captured by the British frigate HMS Sirius under the young Captain Richard King at the Action of 24 October 1798.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the {{expansion}} of the British Empire, a similar approach was also gaining popularity in Britain. An Anglicised interpretation of Islamic architecture is exemplified by the Brighton Royal Pavilion, completed in 1823, and the Sezincote House, completed a few years earlier. <b>Both</b> <b>these</b> buildings drew heavily on the Islamic motifs, which were later to be evident at the Vorontsov Palace and were new and novel designs {{at the time of the}} Prince's visit to England.|$|E

5|$|Hall, who had {{converted}} to the Roman Catholic Church in 1912, was devoutly religious. She {{was also a}} believer in communication with the dead who had once hoped to become a medium– a fact that brought her into conflict with the church, which condemned spiritualism. <b>Both</b> <b>these</b> beliefs {{made their way into}} The Well of Loneliness.|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} skull length, the {{smallest}} subspecies {{of the blue}} wildebeest is the western white-bearded wildebeest. It is also the darkest subspecies, the eastern white-bearded wildebeest being the lightest race. <b>Both</b> <b>these</b> subspecies possess a creamy white beard, whereas the beard is black in both the Nyassaland wildebeest and the common wildebeest. The longest muzzles {{are found in the}} Nyassaland wildebeest, and the shortest in female western white-bearded wildebeest.|$|E

Actors Bradley Stryker, as Ryan's brother Trey, and Shailene Woodley, as Marissa's younger sister Kaitlin, were both only guest stars at this point. However <b>both</b> <b>these</b> characters, portrayed by different actors, {{would return to}} {{a larger role in}} later seasons.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after these}} events, Russia {{experienced}} the February Revolution, which brought to power a liberal Russian Provisional Government. As {{a consequence of}} these, the whole transfer project was delayed, but the Russian acceptance of self-determination facilitated renewed political action. According to veteran Simion Gocan, the soldiers were inspired by <b>both</b> <b>these</b> revolutionary promises and the American entry into World War I, which seemingly made Wilsonian Self-Determination an official Entente policy.|$|E
5|$|The Churchill Machine Tool Co was {{put into}} members' {{voluntary}} liquidation on 25 October 1973 with several other companies in the Herbert group. The company's name resurfaced only {{to be put into}} voluntary liquidation again on 15 March 1985. The winding-up resolutions on <b>both</b> <b>these</b> occasions occurred at meetings held at Canal Road, Coventry, although the appointed people were different.|$|E

Many other enzymes are inhibited by herbicides, including enzymes needed for the biosynthesis of lipids and carotenoids and the processes of photosynthesis and oxidative phosphorylation.|$|E
5|$|The {{stability}} of the 6s shell {{is due to the}} presence of a filled 4f shell. An f shell poorly screens the nuclear charge that increases the attractive Coulomb interaction of the 6s shell and the nucleus (see lanthanide contraction). The absence of a filled inner f shell is the reason for the somewhat higher melting temperature of cadmium and zinc, although <b>both</b> <b>these</b> metals still melt easily and, in addition, have unusually low boiling points.|$|E

5|$|A {{few weeks}} {{before the start of the}} {{services}} to Paddington the Bristol and Exeter Railway (B) had opened, on 14 June 1841, its trains reversing in and out of the GWR station. The third railway at Temple Meads was the Bristol and Gloucester Railway, which opened on 8 July 1844 and was taken over by the Midland Railway (MR) on 1 July 1845. This used the GWR platforms, diverging onto its own line on the far side of the bridge over the Floating Harbour. <b>Both</b> <b>these</b> new railways were engineered by Brunel and were initially broad gauge. Brunel also designed the Bristol and South Wales Union Railway, but this was not opened until 25 August 1863, nearly four years after his death. It terminated at Temple Meads.|$|E
5|$|A unique {{feature of}} {{architecture}} of ancient Sri Lanka, vatadages were {{built for the}} protection of small stupas that had an important relic enshrined in them or were built on hallowed ground. If the Polonnaruwa Vatadage is the shrine built by Parakramabahu I, the relic of the tooth of the Buddha would have been enshrined within it. Another possibility is that the alms bowl used by the Buddha may have been enshrined here. <b>Both</b> <b>these</b> relics were important objects in ancient Sri Lankan culture, and would have made the Polonnaruwa Vatadage {{one of the most significant}} and venerated buildings in the country.|$|E

He then competed in Barcelona where he was beaten by Dominic Thiem in the semi-finals. Murray continued to struggle in his next two tournaments, losing to Borna Coric in the third round of Madrid, and to Fabio Fognini in second round of Rome, where he was defending champion.

5|$|After {{the land}} had been surveyed, the first buyer was the Education Board, {{securing}} {{land for a}} school in the market square, and a teacher's house on the adjacent section. <b>Both</b> <b>these</b> buildings were also built in concrete and exist to this day. The school was built to a northern hemisphere design and has windows {{on the south side}} only to stop children from becoming distracted, but the windows are on the wrong side to utilise the sun. Since the school closed in 1938 it has been used for functions and as a hall. The former teacher's house is used as a bach. Both buildings are owned by Ashburton District Council.|$|E

He participated in French victories at Hohenlinden and later at Austerlitz, where he commanded the 2nd Dragoon Division in Marshal Joachim Murat's Cavalry Reserve. His division was a key to Soult's successful attack on the Russian center. He suffered wounds at <b>both</b> <b>these</b> battles and after the latter, he received le Grand Aigle de la Légion d'honneur (Grand Eagle of the Legion of Honor), and appointed Chamberlain to the Emperor. Subsequently, he was decorated as a Commander of the Order of the Iron Crown, and appointed as Colonel of the Grenadiers à Cheval (mounted grenadiers), of the Imperial Guard, in 1806, a position he held until his death 1813.|$|E
