6000|$|... "No; I'll go too," [...] said Twinkle. [...] "I'd {{be just as}} scared {{waiting outside}} as I would be in. And I 'in <b>bigger</b> <b>than</b> <b>you</b> are, Chub." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'O Joey, a boy no <b>bigger</b> <b>than</b> <b>you</b> are!' said Picotee reprovingly. Her {{personal}} interest in the passion, however, provoked her to inquire, in the next breath, 'Who is it? Do tell, Joey.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "About your age, I expect," [...] {{said the}} old man slowly; [...] "but I was a much <b>bigger</b> chap <b>than</b> <b>you</b> are. A stunted little chap like you ought not to smoke." ...|$|R
6000|$|Hulton made {{a sign of}} agreement. [...] "That's so. I reckon {{you could}} do a <b>bigger</b> trade <b>than</b> <b>you</b> {{have the money to}} handle. However, I guess you and Featherstone mean to {{continue}} the partnership?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Your {{hands are}} <b>bigger</b> <b>than</b> mine, and <b>you</b> will stretch my glove dreadfully," [...] began Meg, whose gloves were a tender point with her.|$|R
6000|$|... "I hope {{we shall}} be great friends, cousins. I am older and <b>bigger</b> <b>than</b> <b>you</b> are, but {{everything}} is new and strange to me, and I shall have to depend upon you to teach me everything." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{suspected}} {{where you}} were leading. Still you see, I'd sooner stay. For one thing, I hate leaving an awkward job half finished. You're beginning to feel the job is <b>bigger</b> <b>than</b> <b>you</b> thought it was when you undertook it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|There was {{a twinkle}} {{in the eyes of}} Paddy the Beaver as he replied: [...] "Well, now that you have found out that you can't do that, because I am <b>bigger</b> <b>than</b> <b>you</b> and can stop you, {{what are you going to}} do about it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{vegetable}} {{in question}} {{is a kind of}} fungi called the Giganti Lycoperdon, and it attains its enormous size in one night! It springs from a seed so small that you could not see it, and grows, while you are asleep, to be <b>bigger,</b> perhaps, <b>than</b> <b>you</b> are yourself! ...|$|R
5000|$|For example, when r = 2, {{you have}} two colors, say red and blue. W(2, 3) is <b>bigger</b> <b>than</b> 8, because <b>you</b> can color the {{integers}} from {1, ..., 8} like this: ...|$|R
5000|$|As time progressed, various new {{versions}} of the phrase were created, for example: [...] "Doopravdy nejsem vůl, Servít" [...] (I'm really not an asshole, Servít), [...] "Všichni jste volové! Servít" [...] (You are all assholes! Servít), [...] "Promiň Servíte jsou i větší volové" [...] (Sorry Servít, there are <b>bigger</b> assholes <b>than</b> <b>you)</b> and so on.|$|R
60|$|His {{wife is a}} very small-sized lady--not much <b>bigger</b> <b>than</b> <b>you,</b> {{my little}} Mary--but very fond {{of all sorts of}} dumb animals; and by {{constantly}} watching their actions and ways, she has come to have quite a strange power over them, as I shall relate.|$|E
6000|$|... "He is {{a pretty}} little fellow, if {{anything}} a trifle <b>bigger</b> <b>than</b> <b>you,</b> Whitefoot, and he is dressed much like you with a yellowish-brown coat and white waistcoat. He has just such a long tail covered with hair its whole length. But you should see his ears. He has the largest ears of {{any member of the}} whole family. That is why he is called Bigear. He likes best to be out at night, but often comes out on dull days. He eats seeds and small nuts and is especially fond of juniper seeds. He always lays up a supply of food for winter. Often he is found very high up on the mountains.|$|E
6000|$|... "There {{are several}} bigger than Jumper," [...] replied Old Mother Nature, and {{smiled as she}} saw the funny look of {{surprise}} {{on the faces of}} Peter and Jumper. [...] "There is one way up the Frozen North and there are two cousins way out in the Great West. They are as much bigger than Jumper as Jumper is <b>bigger</b> <b>than</b> <b>you,</b> Peter. But I haven't time to tell you about them now. If you really want to learn about them, be here promptly at sun-up to-morrow morning. Hello! Here comes Reddy Fox, and he looks to me as if a good breakfast would not come amiss. Let me see what you have learned about taking care of yourselves." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Buck up, Larry. You're {{always talking}} about the wonders of human nature, and here I am giving you another sample of it and you ain't appreciating it. I'm a <b>bigger</b> dreamer <b>than</b> <b>you</b> are, that's all, and I'm sure dreaming what's coming true. It's the biggest, best dream I ever had, and I'm going after it to get it--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You were," [...] he said, with enthusiasm. [...] "You both were. I used {{to think}} Fenn was a <b>bigger</b> idiot <b>than</b> <b>you,</b> but now I'm {{inclined}} {{to call it a}} dead heat. What's the good of going on trying to see which of you can make the bigger fool of himself? You've both lowered all previous records." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{imagine you}} are {{giving me a}} <b>bigger</b> job <b>than</b> <b>you</b> know. If Festing has taken the {{railroad}} contract, he'll probably stop until he had carried it out. Now I don't imagine I'd find it amusing to loaf about and watch him work; for one thing, it's pretty cold in the ranges after the snow comes." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Let 'em laugh," [...] Jack said, [...] "they won't laugh long. I {{never was}} laughed at, {{and why should}} you be? They canna call us Jennies, for we sixteen will play any sixteen wi'in five miles round, at any game they like, or fight 'em {{if it comes to}} that. We has only got to stick together. I sha'n't be one of the night-school, but I am one wi' you, and we'll just stick together. Don't let us mind if they do laugh; if they go on at it, and I doubt they will, just offer to fight anyone your own size, and if he be <b>bigger</b> <b>than</b> <b>you</b> like I'll take him in hand." ...|$|E
6000|$|Great {{things were}} {{happening}} to Happy Jack Squirrel. He was actually {{on his way}} to Farmer Brown's house, and he had a feeling that other things were likely to happen when he got there. Now you may not think that it was anything very great that Happy Jack should be {{on his way to}} Farmer Brown's house. Very likely you are saying, [...] "Pooh! that's nothing!" [...] This may be true, and then again it may not. Suppose you do a little supposing. Suppose you had all your life been terribly afraid of a great giant fifty times <b>bigger</b> <b>than</b> <b>you.</b> Suppose that great giant had stopped hunting you and by little deeds of kindness had at last won your love. Suppose you learned that something was the matter with him, and you made up your mind to visit him at his great castle where there were other great giants whom you did not know. Wouldn't you think that great things were happening to you? ...|$|E
60|$|We {{are now in}} the Broad Walk, and it is as {{much bigger}} than the other walks as your father is <b>bigger</b> <b>than</b> <b>you.</b> David {{wondered}} if it began little, and grew and grew, till it was quite grown up, and whether the other walks are its babies, and he drew a picture, which diverted him very much, of the Broad Walk giving a tiny walk an airing in a perambulator. In the Broad Walk you meet all the people who are worth knowing, and there is usually a grown-up with them to prevent their going on the damp grass, and to make them stand disgraced at the corner of a seat if they have been mad-dog or Mary-Annish. To be Mary-Annish is to behave like a girl, whimpering because nurse won't carry you, or simpering with your thumb in your mouth, and it is a hateful quality, but to be mad-dog is to kick out at everything, and there is some satisfaction in that.|$|E
6000|$|... "Jenkins," [...] he said, {{addressing}} the keeper, [...] "do what Mr. Quatermain has said and attend {{to your own}} business. Perhaps you are not aware that he has shot more lions, elephants, and other <b>big</b> game <b>than</b> <b>you</b> have cats. But, however that may be, it is not your place to try to instruct him or any of my guests. Now go and see to the beaters." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Baas, the White One who {{was called}} Star, asked me of your son, the young Baas Harry, and I {{told her that}} when last I had seen him he was strong and well and would make a <b>bigger</b> man <b>than</b> <b>you</b> were, whereat she sighed and shook her head. Then the Missie Marie said: 'Tell the Baas, Hans, that I also have a child which he will see one day, {{but it is not}} a son.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{they are}} wonderful, Beric," [...] Aemilia said. [...] "When {{you told us}} {{that you were not}} yet full grown I thought you were jesting, but I see now that truly these men are <b>bigger</b> even <b>than</b> <b>you</b> are. I wish I had such golden hair as most of them have, and such a white skin. Golden hair is fashionable in Rome, you know, but it is scarce, except in a few whose mothers were Gauls who have married with Romans." ...|$|R
60|$|Others, {{older men}} than Silverbridge, saw {{as much as}} did our young friend, but they were more complaisant and more reasonable. They, too, heard the crackle of the buckram, and were aware that the last touch of awe had come upon that brow just as its owner was {{emerging}} from {{the shadow of the}} Speaker's chair;--but to them it was a thing of course. A real Cæsar is not to be found every day, nor can we always have a Pitt to control our debates. That kind of thing, that last touch has its effect. Of course it is all paint,--but how would the poor girl look before the gaslights if there were no paint? The House of Commons likes a little deportment on occasions. If a special man looks <b>bigger</b> <b>than</b> <b>you,</b> you can console yourself by reflecting that he also looks bigger than your fellows. Sir Timothy probably knew what he was about, and did himself on the whole more good than harm by his little tricks.|$|E
6000|$|... "You shall hear. We {{are still}} at breakfast, all silent--for what have we to talk about here? What have we but our devotions, our kitchen-garden, and our wretched, wretched bits of breakfasts and dinners? I say we are all silent, when there comes {{suddenly}} such a ring at the bell as never was heard before--a very devil of a ring--a ring that caught us all with our bits--our wretched, wretched bits!--in our mouths, and stopped us before we could swallow them. 'Go, brother of mine,' says the father superior to me, 'go; it is your duty--go to the gate.' I am brave--a very lion of a Capuchin. I slip out on tiptoe--I wait--I listen--I pull back our little shutter in the gate--I wait, I listen again--I peep through the hole--nothing, absolutely nothing that I can see. I am brave--I am not to be daunted. What do I do next? I open the gate. Ah! sacred Mother of Heaven, what do I behold lying all along our threshold? A man--dead!--a big man; <b>bigger</b> <b>than</b> <b>you,</b> bigger than me, bigger than anybody in this convent--buttoned up tight in a fine coat, with black eyes, staring, {{staring up at the}} sky, and blood soaking through and through the front of his shirt. What do I do? I scream once--I scream twice--and run back to the father superior!" ...|$|E

50|$|I {{think we}} set up an {{impossible}} task, because our hedonistic version of happiness is impossible to sustain.

[...] "This petty little business, {{as you call}} it, bears {{directly}} on a very big business, <b>bigger</b> perhaps <b>than</b> either <b>you</b> or Miss Tuppence know.

5000|$|Constantine {{has heard}} the truth from Maximian’s hitmen and arrives with Beroe, Licinia, the Empress’s maids and his pretorians. In his hand is the signed pardon for his son, but Maximian proudly and cynically {{confirms}} that his son is dead. Meanwhile Fausta has regained some of her strength and tells Constantine about her lies. When the infuriated Emperor remonstrates that she will pay the ultimate price, she confesses that she has taken a deadly poison. Everyone is horrified and in unison respond, [...] "Evil woman; there is no <b>bigger</b> monster <b>than</b> <b>you</b> on earth." ...|$|R
