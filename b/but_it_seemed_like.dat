25|$|Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club {{gave the}} episode an A- grade, saying: What’s most {{striking}} about “No Sanctuary,” {{apart from its}} attempts at thematic resonance, is how quickly and brutally the question of Terminus is resolved. If you’d asked me beforehand, I would’ve guessed {{that it would take}} {{at least a couple of}} episodes before Rick and the others could free themselves. I wouldn’t have been exactly excited about that, because the longer you stay in a community full of murderous cannibals without any major character being killed, the more the tension just drips away, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> a reasonable assumption to make, especially when taking into consideration how tricky it was going to be to build the rest of the season. Without the prison home base or an obvious major villain (goodbye, the Governor), we need something to create structure—a group of psychos who harvest human flesh seems like too good a concept to dispose of immediately.|$|E
2500|$|That {{was what}} we liked to call a [...] "pay the rent" [...] job. It wasn't a script I liked, but I {{remember}} my agent at the time saying, [...] "Look, {{you only have to}} work two weeks, and they're going to pay you a lot of money. We'll just say it was your first movie and they just didn't release it." [...] I think people were all fucked up on drugs. I don't know. I was a little removed, because I wasn't on the movie the whole time, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> it was just a mess. Like, when I'd go, I'd think--I like to make a movie where I know who the boss is. I like a big boss. I like a real director. And it seemed like it was just, [...] "Who's driving the ship here? What's going on?" ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{track was}} {{produced}} by Wilson, who intended to encapsulate {{the feel of the}} Drifters' version of [...] "On Broadway". The instrumental was made on April 6, 1965 at United Western Recorders, requiring 44 takes before Wilson could deem a satisfactory performance. Problems had arisen from the tempo and guitar part in the introduction, which fatigued Wilson, engineer Chuck Britz, and the dozen-plus session players. The song did not appear to have lyrics or a title at this juncture, and Wilson can be heard calling the song [...] "Oh Yeah" [...] and [...] "You're Grass and I'm a Power Mower". Wilson remembers: [...] "When we got into the studio with Chuck, he said that he wanted Carl’s twelve-string guitar in the intro to sound more direct. I didn’t know what that meant. 'Can he play it in the booth?' Chuck said. I had never thought about that before, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> a good idea. Carl was standing next to me in the booth and all the other musicians were out in the studio. I conducted it like an orchestra." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Let me {{have the}} feel of <b>it.</b> Lordy, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> old times to have one's hand on a musket. What's the manual, sergeant, eh? Cock your firelock--look to your priming--present your firelock--eh, sergeant? Oh, Jimini, I've broke your musket in halves!" ...|$|R
5000|$|Commenting on the {{suggestion}} that he is [...] "The Fixer" [...] {{referred to in the}} song's title, Vedder stated, [...] "My answer is, aren't we all? Maybe I'm wrong to think that, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> we are...I'm thinking more on a worldview or a community view." ...|$|R

Doesn’t have Tourette’s, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> <b>it.</b> She’d sing {{if there}} wasn’t the {{potential}} for onstage embarrassment. Loves being the manager, it’s a pretty essential position to the team’s success. Ideally, this actress should truly be a great belter.|$|R
2500|$|At Darlington, {{while running}} {{in the top five}} with 3 laps to go, Busch got tapped from behind by Clint Bowyer and spun out, hitting a barrier head-on. Because of energy {{absorbing}} walls, Busch was uninjured, but waved angrily towards Bowyer under caution and showed discontent with Bowyer in post-race ceremonies. In regards to the incident with Bowyer, Busch said [...] "That was a terrible way to end {{what could have been a}} decent night. We struggled at times to get the balance of the Haas Automation Chevrolet right, but we kind of found our spot just past the halfway point and made slight adjustments the rest of the way. We called for a two-tire stop at the end hoping to gain some track position, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> everyone had the same idea. We gained a little, but the guys behind us all had four tires. I tried to hold them off the best I could, but someone (Bowyer) moved me out of their way and it ruined our night. I hate it for the team, but we keep learning each week and we will get better." ...|$|E
2500|$|Breault and I {{separated}} {{to pound}} {{on each of}} the boat’s sides. In this way, the rescuers would know that there were two of us. Breault played a kind of tune with his hammer, indicating to the diver that we were in good shape and cheerful. Neither of us knew Morse Code. We [...] had no food or water, and only a flashlight. We were confident we could stay alive for forty-eight hours. The high pressure and foul air gave us severe headaches. We did very little moving or talking; it excited our hearts too much. We heard scraping on the hull for hours. A couple of times we felt the O-5 being lifted, and then we got tossed roughly when the slings broke. We knew they were hard after us. This buoyed our hopes [...] for rescue tremendously. Finally, the sub began to be tilted upward slowly. We felt we would escape this time, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> forever. The last 20 minutes were unbearable. We heard our comrades walking on deck. Breault opened the hatch and we could see daylight. [...] We were saved!!! ...|$|E

500|$|Many villages {{lost both}} power and water, leaving {{survivors}} unable {{to fend for}} themselves. The injured were often up to [...] away from the nearest hospital. One doctor, highlighting the desperate need for physicians to treat the injured, said [...] "I don't know how many casts I have done today, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> hundreds." ...|$|R
5000|$|Big Island Mike Mapu - Mike Mapu runs [...] "Big Island Mike's Immersion Excursions" [...] {{with the}} help of his {{daughter}} Pua, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> the tourists just aren't interested. He practically has to force tourists to catch fish, string necklaces, and go snorkeling. Could there be something shady about the way he does business? ...|$|R
5000|$|Darren Franich of Entertainment Weekly {{gave the}} episode a mixed to {{positive}} review, saying, [...] "This {{was a solid}} and world-buildy second outing for Under the Dome. The episode mostly served to further establish {{the boundaries of the}} New Dome Order; not much happened until the end, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> the final act will have serious reverberations throughout the town." ...|$|R
60|$|There {{was a loud}} {{exclamation from}} Captain Barclay, and a scream of delight from their mother, and Milly; {{and it was a}} good ten minutes before they were sitting round the table, talking coherently. It was but six weeks since they had left, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> years; and there was as much to tell, and to talk about, as if they had just returned, after an absence of half a lifetime, in India.|$|E
6000|$|We {{paused a}} moment in the hall to look at the big [...] "Grandfather" [...] clock. It was not going, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> an old, {{familiar}} acquaintance to us, with the gilt balls on its three peaks; the little dial and pointer which would indicate the changes of the moon, and the very dent in its wooden door which father had made when he was a boy, by kicking it in a fit of naughtiness.|$|E
6000|$|These trivial tales {{illustrate}} {{a period in}} his life and adventures which I only know by rumour. Our own acquaintance was, to a great degree, literary and bookish. Perhaps it began [...] "with a slight aversion," [...] <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed,</b> <b>like</b> madeira, to be ripened and improved by his long sea voyage; and the news of his death taught me, at least, {{the true nature of the}} affection which he was destined to win. Indeed, our acquaintance was like the friendship of a wild singing bird and of a punctual, domesticated barn-door fowl, laying its daily [...] "article" [...] for the breakfast- table of the citizens. He often wrote to me from Samoa, sometimes with news of native manners and folklore. He sent me a devil-box, the [...] "luck" [...] of some strange island, which he bought at a great price. After parting with its [...] "luck," [...] or fetish (a shell in a curious wooden box), the island was unfortunate, and was ravaged by measles.|$|E
40|$|Russia and the EU talk {{in their}} summit communiqués about their {{strategic}} partnership, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> an awkward partnership. The relationship {{is not that}} bad, certainly not life-threatening, but {{there is room for}} improvement. This working paper from the European Security Forum considers the complex relationship between Russia and the West, including the complementary qualities and the differences in how the each views the world...|$|R
50|$|It is a {{different}} type of movie which is never experienced in Malayalam film industry before or later <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> the movie is not widely accepted in theaters. Maybe because of the period in which films dealing such subjects are not acceptable. The success story could be different, if this movie is released nowadays, when something new will be accepted. The film is not available on videos release.|$|R
5000|$|In {{addition}} to his literary criticism, Whiter published his etymological research, first as Etymologicon Magnum in 1800, then as Etymologicon Universale in 1822 (vol. 1 and 2) and 1825 (vol. 3); August Baron Merian, a correspondent of Samuel Butler, stated that he [...] "pit(ied)" [...] Whiter, and described him as [...] "(a) great etymologist—perhaps the greatest that ever lived. A genius certainly; <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems,</b> <b>like</b> most eminentartists, [...]" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If I do that," [...] said Atherton, gravely, [...] "I {{must make}} my conditions," [...] {{and now they}} sat down {{together}} on the sofa from which he had risen. [...] "I can't be subjected again to your--disappointments,"--he arrested with a motion of his hand the profuse expression of her penitence and good intentions,--"and I've felt {{for a long time}} that this was no attitude for your attorney. You ought to have the right to question and censure; but I confess I can't grant you this. I've allowed myself to make your interests too much my own in everything to be able to bear it. I've thought several times that I ought to give up the trust; <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> giving up so much more, that I never had the courage to do it in cold blood. This morning you gave me my chance to do it in hot blood, and if I resume it, I must make my terms." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{have spoken}} {{first of the}} ethical works of Tolstoy, because they are of the first {{importance}} to me, but I think that his aesthetical works are as perfect. To my thinking they transcend in truth, which is the highest beauty, all other works of fiction that have been written, and I believe that they do this because they obey {{the law of the}} author's own life. His conscience is one ethically and one aesthetically; with his will to be true to himself he cannot be false to his knowledge of others. I thought the last word in literary art had been said to me by the novels of Tourguenief, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> the first, merely, when I began to acquaint myself with the simpler method of Tolstoy. I came to it by accident, and without any manner, of preoccupation in The Cossacks, one of his early books, which had been on my shelves unread for five or six years. I did not know even Tolstoy's name when I opened it, and it was with a kind of amaze that I read it, and felt word by word, and line by line, the truth of a new art in it.|$|E
60|$|Somehow this thrilled me. I {{could not}} exactly say how or why; <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> a gleam of light at last. There are, I think, moments when the mind accepts {{something}} as true; {{though it can}} account for neither {{the course of the}} thought, nor, if there be more than one thought, the connection between them. Hitherto we had been in such outer darkness regarding Mr. Trelawny, and the strange visitation which had fallen on him, that anything which afforded a clue, even of the faintest and most shadowy kind, had at the outset the enlightening satisfaction of a certainty. Here were two lights of our puzzle. The first that Mr. Trelawny associated with this particular curio a doubt of his own living. The second that he had some purpose or expectation with regard to it, which he would not disclose, even to his daughter, till complete. Again it was to be borne in mind that this sarcophagus differed internally from all the others. What meant that odd raised place? I said nothing to Miss Trelawny, for I feared lest I should either frighten her or buoy her up with future hopes; but I made up my mind that I would take an early opportunity for further investigation.|$|E
6000|$|... "From me," [...] {{answered}} the Lady Peveril--"from me, whose youth your kindness sheltered--from {{the wife of}} Peveril, your gallant Lord's companion in arms--you {{have a right to}} command everything; but, alas! that you should need such assistance as I can render--forgive me, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> some ill-omened vision of the night--I listen to your words as if I hoped to be relieved from their painful import by awaking." ...|$|R
6000|$|She now {{spoke with}} more hurry and agitation, [...] "Yes, yes, papa, {{it was the}} very thing you warned me against--I mean--I mean--the being set in my own way, and liking to tease the boys. O if I could but speak to tell you all, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> a weight here choking me," [...] and she touched her throat. [...] "I can't get it out in words! O!"

5000|$|Yo, so I {{just wanted}} to say a few things about John Cardiel. First off, he's an {{original}}; his style—there's not too many people who skate like him. The way he skates is amazing, 'cause he'll skate so fast, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> the faster he goes, the more control he has ... which is, you know, unexplainable. But he's unbelievable. I'm not trying to kiss too much butt, but he's a ripper, an original ripper ... He's an original Coors.|$|R

50|$|In the meantime, Dow Chemical {{was looking}} into {{how it might}} utilize large lignite {{deposits}} in Texas to reduce its dependence on natural gas to fuel its vast on-site power generating facilities.

To escape her anger Cheo-soo goes out for a smoke. Heejung leads him to the rooftop where she points to where her home is.|$|R
5000|$|GamePro {{gave the}} game a {{negative}} review, summarizing, [...] "if you liked The Jetsons ... {{then you might}} be able to wade through this game. Intermediate gamers need not apply much to this one, though. The Jetsons game is basic hop-n-bop, space-style, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> all the other hop-n-boppers out there."
