After an introduction to the topic, chapter 2 shows that the institutional setting of fiscal policy making needs to be considered when assessing the sustainability of fiscal policy. Using data for the U. S. and German state governments, the results of fiscal sustainability tests depend on whether fiscal transfers are taken into account. If fiscal transfers are not included in the primary surplus, the test results do not indicate that the U. S. and German state governments pursued sustainable fiscal policies. Chapter 3 examines whether the municipalities' voting behavior in state elections in a German state influenced the distribution of discretionary grants from the state level to the municipalities. The results show that discretionary grants were awarded to municipalities with many core supporters of the incumbent state government. In Chapter 4, a test on explosive time-series behavior is applied to the Target balances of the German Bundesbank.

40|$|Dicyphus hesperus Knight (Hemiptera: Miridae) is an {{omnivorous}} natural {{enemy of}} greenhouse whitefly, Trialeurodes vaporariorum Westwood (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae) {{that can be}} used in biological control programs. Omnivorous natural enemies consume both plant and prey food and offer certain advantages and disadvantages to biological control; therefore, understanding these species prior to their use is important. Much is currently known about D. hesperus. However, variation in the quality of plant and/or prey resources for consumers is common in agroecosystems. The impacts of varying within-species resource quality on D. hesperus have not been investigated. The objective of my dissertation was to investigate the effect of varying plant and prey quality on the life history and behaviour of D. hesperus. To approach this question, I used nitrogen (N) fertilizer to manipulate the quality of tomato plants, Solanum lycopersicum L. (Solanales: Solanaceae). Prey reared on high and low N tomato plants were offered in feeding trials to represent natural variation in prey quality. I observed how these factors, independently or simultaneously, affected oviposition preference (Chapter 2); development and survival of D. hesperus nymphs (Chapter 3); olfactory response (Chapter 4); prey preference and consumption rate (Chapter 5); and the activity <b>budget</b> (<b>Chapter</b> 6) of D. hesperus. Based on optimal oviposition theory, optimal foraging theory, and the plant vigor and plant stress hypotheses, I predicted that high N tomato plants, and whitefly prey reared on those plants, would be most preferred. I also predicted that the behaviour of D. hesperus would vary in response to the quality of the resources available. As expected, both factors influenced the life history and behaviour of D. hesperus. For example, high N tomatoes were preferred for oviposition and prey reared on high N plants were preferred for consumption. Foraging behaviour of D. hesperus adults also varied in response to varying levels of plant N when prey from high and low N tomatoes were provided. My results can be used to inform the development of biological control programs using omnivores, and D. hesperus in particular. My research highlights the importance of considering within-species variation in quality when making pest management decisions...|$|E

These models comprise a large number of tiny sensor nodes working cooperatively towards building a wireless communication network. This doctoral dissertation focuses on the study/ proposal of energy-efficient algorithms for topology control and dissemination/ harvesting of information in large-scale Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). Chapter 1 of this dissertation is a detailed introduction in the subject of Wireless Sensor Networks. Specific details of recent technological advances towards making it technically feasible to produce large numbers of tiny sensor motes are explained. A large ensemble of sensor motes, which are embedded in the physical space, can produce a “smart environment”. The technical characteristics of “smart environments” are listed and the major models for Wireless Sensor Networks operation (as they have been proposed in literature) are explained. In Chapter 2, a novel technique is proposed for distributed clustering of sensor nodes in a large scale Wireless Sensor Network. The proposed Directed Budget Based (DBB) and Directed Budget Based with Random Delays (DBB-RD) algorithms have their basis on two previously published algorithms for distributed clustering of nodes in wireless networks, called Rapid and Persistent. The algorithms begin the distributed clustering process by distributing a set of coupons/ tokens offered to the initiator node evenly among the neighbors of that node; the process is then repeated in consecutive cycles of operation until the tokens are completely distributed or no more growth is possible in the network. The directed budget-based clustering algorithms called DBB and DBB-RD are proved through simulations to be energy-beneficial for the wireless sensor network due to both the reduced total number of exchanged messages in the network and the final cluster sizes achieved (close to the desired offered <b>budget).</b> ? <b>Chapter</b> 3 describes an innovative technique for information diffusion in a large scale WSN. The described technique is based on random walks for information propagation inside the sensor network, which is modeled as a random geometric graph. The classic, well known, random walk involves the proliferation of the agent in the network by choosing uniformly at random among all next hop neighbors of the currently visited node. In contrast to this, the in-chapter- 3 -described technique involves the design of a “freezing” mechanism for the direction of movement of the random walk agent, such that the agent is allowed to be forwarded towards a specific direction in the network. The particular forwarding direction is retained by the random walk-with-jumps agent {{for as long as the}} agent will stay in the “freezing state”. It is shown through both simulations and analysis that the incorporation of such a freezing mechanism into the otherwise pure random walk movement of the random walk agent will be beneficial for the overall covering process of the sensor network. ...|$|E
40|$|Fixed {{nitrogen}} (N) limits phytoplankton growth {{throughout the}} low latitude ocean. The oceanic reservoir of this essential nutrient {{is therefore a}} critical determinant of the fertility of the ocean as a whole, {{and the strength of}} the biological pump that sequesters carbon in deep waters out of contact with the atmosphere. Two biological processes dominate the ocean's N budget: a source of N through N 2 fixation by diazotrophic plankton, and a sink through bacterial denitrification when oxygen is depleted. These processes are subject to external climate-related forces that push the N budget out of balance, but also coupled through internal feedbacks that strive to restore a balance and stabilize the N reservoir. The feedback mechanism can be thought to operate like a "nutrient thermostat", in which the nitrogen-to-phosphorous (N:P) requirement of phytoplankton represents a setpoint towards which the ratio of N and P reservoirs is restored. This dissertation comprises four projects that address different aspects of the general question: how flexible is the oceanic N reservoir? 	Chapters 2 and 3 examine the flexibility of the setpoint towards which the N reservoir is restored. In Chapter 2, a diagnostic model is used to show that the N:P of nutrient drawdown by marine phytoplankton, long considered to have a universal "Redfield ratio" of 16 : 1, varies significantly at the scale of marine biomes due to stoichiometric diversity between taxa. Thus the mean N:P of marine phytoplankton, previously thought of as a fundamental biological property, only reflects the balance of high and low N:P biomes under modern-ocean conditions. Chapter 3 explores the role of this variability in the nutrient thermostat feedbacks. An ecosystem model is used to show that the ratio of nutrient reservoirs it is biased upwards towards the high N:P requirements of subtropical phytoplankton that cohabit and compete directly with N 2 -fixers. This resolves a discrepancy between the observed N reservoir and the predictions of "Redfieldian" models, which lose too much N before reaching equilibrium. We also demonstrate {{an important role in the}} nutrient thermostat for ocean circulation, which communicates stoichiometric signatures between biomes. Changes in the N reservoir may thus be driven, over millennial timescales, by a restructuring of plankton biomes and the circulation pathways that connect them. Chapters 4 and 5 examine the potential for variations in the N reservoir via direct forcing of the oceanic N <b>budget.</b> <b>Chapter</b> 4 focuses on the process of N 2 -fixation, which may be limited either by an external supply of Fe through the atmosphere, or the internal generation of N deficits that allow diazotrophs to compete with faster-growing plankton, which are susceptible to N-limitation. Multiple geochemical constraints are used to show that N 2 -fixation in the modern ocean is limited by Fe inputs at the community scale, but strongly coupled to N loss through denitrification at the basin scale. These results reconcile biochemical evidence for Fe-stress in diazotroph communities with the existence of regulatory feedbacks that maintain a balanced the N budget. Within the regime of intermediate Fe-control, the oceanic N reservoir would respond weakly to the enhanced dust fluxes hypothesized for a glacial climate, but strongly to the reduced fluxes expected under climate warming. Chapter 5 uses a biogeochemical model to derive a simple framework for understanding the strength of N cycle feedbacks. A feedback response to any N-budget forcing comprises two components: a fast initial adjustment period involving only the upper ocean, in which changes in the N reservoir are minor, and a slow millennial response involving deep ocean circulation. The magnitude of changes in the N reservoir depend on the fraction of forced anomalies that "leak" into the deep ocean, and the timescale over which those deep-ocean anomalies are removed. Feedbacks through N 2 -fixation, rather than denitrification, are most efficient at preventing leakage and removing deep-ocean anomalies, and are strong enough to prevent major perturbation to the N reservoir, unless Fe shortages confine diazotrophs to small regions of the ocean...|$|E

Understanding how economic systems interact with ecosystems requires models that include geospatial heterogeneity. Integration {{of economic and}} ecological systems is vital for sustainable development, especially with respect to climate change, food security and the management of common property resources. Advances in remote sensing and geographic information systems have created a wealth of data applicable to economics, but {{it is challenging to}} incorporate high-resolution, global data in existing economic models. In this thesis, I integrate geospatial data with economic theory to analyze important environmental problems. The next three chapters describe the techniques I use for modeling geospatially-explicit economic systems and apply them to current environmental challenges. Chapter one addresses the tradeoffs between food production and environmental protection. I address the question of how we can optimally feed a growing population (requiring a 100 % increase in calorie production by 2050) while minimizing the loss of carbon storage (which is important for mitigating climate change). I use high-resolution, gridded global data to give geospatial specificity to the results of the optimization. The framework I present in this chapter includes only one production choice and one environmental good, but it is more broadly applicable to multiple goods and multiple ecosystem services. This chapter also shows how using geospatial data can increase the policy relevance of an analysis. For example, instead of claiming that tropical forests are in general very valuable, using geospatial data allows for the more precise claim that this specific 10 kilometer patch of forest is better kept as forest than cultivated. Spatially explicit information like this can help construct more specific policies, such as food-for-carbon swaps or identifying which parcels ought to be protected first given a limited conservation <b>budget.</b> <b>Chapter</b> two presents a microeconomic model of spatial foraging that addresses how humans gather goods on a spatially heterogeneous landscape when transport costs are non-negligible. The general problem of foraging arises when multiple agents located in space compete for resources that are characterized by their location. I use agent-based simulation methods to account for agents that must move over the landscape subject to terrain and road networks, depletion by rival agents and spatial heterogeneity with a large number of agents (10 million). The model is applicable to several topics in environmental economics, including fuelwood collection and fisheries management, but also more general economic topics such as housing, employment search, transportation, pollution and urban economics. Another contribution of chapter two is that it makes several methodological advances that allow for spatially-explicit agent-based simulation on extremely large systems. These advances are of two types: first, I present data creation methods that allow for high resolution data to be created globally, relying on satellite-derived data products and spatial downscaling techniques to estimate environmental and social indicators, such as population density or spatially defined wages. Second, I identify computational methods (and implement them in a software application) that allows for fast calculation of agent interactions and movement of space. I discuss the data storage types necessary for this along with a method of vectorizing the calculations to enable computation of extremely large systems (with as many as 10 billion agents). Chapter two concludes an application of the spatial foraging model in which I assess how villagers in Tanzania gather firewood from forests. Firewood collection is a useful example because the need for a spatially explicit model is clear. Transportation costs of firewood are very high relative to their value and firewood in almost always collected by agents foraging for their own consumption. For instance, Fabe and Grote (2013) report that 97. 5 % of household in Tanzania use firewood as their main fuel, but only 13 % of firewood is purchased. I define behavior rules in the simulation based on a microeconomic agricultural household production model (Singh et al. 1986, Bardhan and Udry 1999) apply them to high-resolution geospatial data for Tanzania. I iteratively simulate individual agents' foraging actions and observe the value of firewood obtained. The estimates obtained from this method match existing estimates of firewood collection while providing more detail about where the firewood is collected. The empirical application presented in chapter two is useful to practitioners of ecosystem serve estimation. Calculating the ecosystem service value of non-timber forest products (NTFPs) has been difficult in practice due to computational and theoretical problems. Existing estimation approaches identify the abundance of NTFPs on different forest types but do not explicitly state how agents gather the firewood. The approach I use accounts for how these gathering decisions interact with the abundance of NTFPs to determine the ecosystem service value. The final chapter in this thesis presents a theoretical model that that incorporates reciprocity in a utility maximization model to analyze common-property resource dilemmas. This model, which I refer to as the commons reciprocity utility model, allows agents to make interpersonal comparisons of utility in order to reward cooperators and punish detractors. Extending traditional utility theory in this way is useful to describe the wide-spread observation that individual economic agents do not always free-ride and do not always fall for the tragedy of the commons (Hardin 1968; Ostrom 1990). Although this chapter is primarily focused on theory, I provide two environmental examples to illustrate how it can be applied (including full details in Appendix 2). First, I discuss how international negotiations on climate change can be modeled in this framework by describing each nations' decisions to meet their emissions abatement targets in reciprocal terms. Specifically, nations will reward other nations who do meet their abatement goals and will punish those who do not. I provide a numerical example of this situation that shows increased levels of abatement, higher than the prediction of strong free-riding. Second, I apply the commons reciprocity utility model to a forest commons to explore how agents' decisions to engage in sustainable forestry or to clear-cut the forest depends on the reciprocal relationships of nearby agents. This example is preliminary, but shows how the model {{can be applied to the}} agent-based simulation techniques introduced in chapter two. At the deepest level, the goal of this thesis is not to present a complex system of models, but is to answer the question of "how ought we live?" As humans harness an ever-greater portion of available energy and focus it into ever-more complex arrangements, the question of understanding our place in our environment grows more challenging. It requires modeling economic behavior in conjunction with the geospatial landscape on which we act. It is my hope that the methods presented here help condense the nebulous connections among economic and ecological systems into useful bits of truth...|$|E
40|$|Satellites {{have always}} been {{considered}} to be extremely expensive and risky business, which not only requires extensive knowledge and expertise in this field but also huge budget. Primarily, this concept was based on initial development and launching cost. Secondly, it was also impossible to repair and substitute parts (this was true up to 1993 : the first Hubble Space Telescope servicing mission), which makes design more tough because it requires advanced fault tolerance solutions and extreme reliability. But {{with the passage of}} time many space actors entered in this market. Low cost design techniques played an important role in the aerospace market growth in the past years, but they can still play a major part in future developments. At present, several private companies are also providing launch services which further lower the accumulative cost. Many universities and SMEs (Small Medium Enterprises) worldwide are also trying to reduce satellite costs. The Department of Electronics and Telecommunication (DET) at Politecnico di Torino has been working on NanoSatellites since 2002 and developed their first NanoSatellite called PiCPoT, which was intended to be launched together with other university satellites by a DNEPR LV rocket in July 2006. Unfortunately a problem in the first stage of the carrier led to the destruction of all satellites. After that DET started work on a comprehensive NanoSatellite project called AraMiS (Italian acronym for Modular Architecture of Satellites). The main idea of the AraMiS is modularity at mechanical, electronic and testing levels using Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) components. These modules can be assembled together to get the targeted mission, which allows an effective cost sharing between multiple missions. AraMiS satellites have mass up to 5 kg with different shapes and dimensions. AraMiS-C 1 is a CubeSat Standard satellite developed on the AraMiS approach. Four sides of the AraMiS-C 1 are equipped with identical tiles called 1 B 8 _CubePMT that mount solar panels on the exterior and a combined power management, attitude control and computing subsystem on the interior. The other two sides are devoted to the telecommunication tiles called 1 B 9 _CubeTCT which carry a commercial deployable UHF antenna (one side) and a patch type SHF antenna (the other side). Thesis discusses in detail the design, implementation and testing of the 1 B 8 _CubePMT module. It is developed on the design approach of AraMiS architecture with dimension 98 × 82. 5 × 1. 6 mm 3. 1 B 8 _CubePMT module contains electric power supply (EPS) and attitude determination & control subsystems (ADCS) of AraMiS-C 1 satellite. The integration of such a large number of systems in a small area was not a trivial job. Several techniques were employed for reduction of size, weight and power consumption of the different subsystems while still achieving best performances. COTS components were selected for the EPS subsystems, on the basis of power loss analysis and minimum dimensions which helped in efficiency enhancement and also miniaturization of the subsystems. ADCS subsystems components were also selected on the basis of minimum dimensions and lower power consumptions while still achieving targeted performances. The most interesting feature of the 1 B 8 _CubePMT module is the design and integration of a reconfigurable magnetorquer coil within four internal layers occupying no excess space. Coils in each layer are treated separately and can be attached/detached through straps. Changing the arrangement of these straps make the magnetorquer reconfigurable. Different housekeeping sensors have been employed at various points of the 1 B 8 _CubePMT module. Thesis also discusses thermal modeling of CubeSat, AraMiS-C 1 satellite and 1 B 8 _CubePMT module. Thermal resistance and temperature differences between different sides of the satellites and individual tiles have been found. At the end, preliminary thermal and spin analysis of NanoSatellites have been presented. Chapter 1 gives an introduction to the problem and proposed solutions which will be discussed in this thesis. Chapter 2 presents an introduction to AraMiS project and AraMiS-C 1 satellite. Chapter 3 discusses different satellite design flow configurations and their comparison. Chapter 4 discusses 1 B 8 _CubePMT module which is a CubeSat standard power management tile, developed on the AraMiS concept, for AraMiS-C 1 satellite. It has EPS and ADCS subsystems which are the most essential elements of any aerospace mission. Chapter 5 deals with the design and development of the EPS system of AraMiS-C 1 satellite. This chapter discusses how to reduce the size, weight and power consumption of the EPS subsystems while achieving better efficiency and fulfilling satellite power requirements. The selection of COTS components on the basis of power loss analysis and minimum dimensions is discussed in detail. Housekeeping sensors such as current, voltage and temperature sensors which are employed at different points of the 1 B 8 _CubePMT module to cope with anomalies, have been discussed in detail in this chapter. At the end of the chapter, the designed EPS is evaluated on the basis of AraMiS-C 1 power <b>budget.</b> <b>Chapter</b> 6 discusses design and implementation of attitude determination sensors (ADS) of the AraMiS-C 1 satellite. 1 B 8 _CubePMT has three types of attitude determination sensors: sun sensor, magnetometer and gyroscope. This chapter discusses in detail the design and operation of these sensors. Chapter 7 discusses the attitude control (ADC) system of AraMiS-C 1 satellite. The design and implementation of a reconfigurable magnetorquer coil which is embedded inside the 1 B 8 _CubePMT module, is discussed in detail. The designed magnetorquer has been evaluated on different parameters and compared with the magnetic actuator already available in the market. In chapter 8 testing procedure and results of 1 B 8 _CubePMT subsystems are discussed in detail. Chapter 9 presents thermal modelling of NanoSatellites. Detailed and simplified thermal models of CubeSat panel have been discussed. Thermal resistances measured through both models are compared. Generic thermal model of a CubeSat is presented. Utilizing the proposed models, thermal resistance of 1 B 8 _CubePMT and AraMiS-C 1 are measured. In order to verify the theoretical results, the thermal resistance of the AraMiS-C 1 is measured through an experimental setup. Chapter 10 discusses preliminary thermal and spin analysis of NanoSatellites in space environment. All the heat sources and their effects on the satellite have been discussed. A thermal balance equation has been established and satellite temperature for different structures and various conditions has been found. At the end a satellite spin analysis on the basis of different absorption coefficient related with colors, has been discusse...|$|E

40|$|International audienceLaunched in {{the early}} 1990 s in the United Kingdom, Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) induced radical changes in both the {{public-private}} boundaries {{and the production of}} state-provided services. Such 'budgetary revolution' impacted the biggest state spender in capital expenditures, that is, the Ministry of Defence. Today many MoDs are expected to leverage on the British experience and develop their own approach of PPPs to overcome both the ineffectiveness of their defence spending and today's stalemate in public <b>budgets.</b> This <b>chapter</b> leverages on British experiences {{over the past two decades}} to analyse the benefits and limits of PPPs in the realm of defence. Does such contractual arrangement fit defence-related investment? This chapter explores the on-going redefinition of public and private realms in military matters and it puts into relief the key dimensions of PPPs in terms of contractual arrangement...|$|R

Information on budgets in general, the definition and purpose thereof, as well as the use of the budget as a tool for management was readily available. Similarly information on forecasting and forecasting models could be found, but no pUblished research indicating a method or model for the forecasting of the Working Budget in South African Airways was available, nor was any evidence found of the use of a more sophisticated model other than forecasting a budget based on historical tendencies. In chapter one {{the purpose of the study}} is defined followed by a short description of the contents of each chapter. Chapter two underlines the importance of the managerial functions in a company. The level of management will determine the degree of the functions to be performed, whether it be planning, organising, directing, activating or controlling. Management tools are available to ease the task, and one of these tools are budgets, which could be regarded as the most important tool.

40|$|This {{research}} {{seeks to}} discover {{why and how}} presidents choose their administrative strategies. The hypothesis advanced argues the political beliefs of a president make some administrative strategies more appealing than others. ^ Chapter One offers a critique of current explanations of presidential behavior, including the 2 ̆ 2 classic 2 ̆ 2 models of the 2 ̆ 2 rational decider 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 personality 2 ̆ 2 models of decision making. A third model, that of 2 ̆ 2 political belief, 2 ̆ 2 is described and discussed. The chapter concludes by arguing this belief model can escape the methodological problems plaguing the other 2 ̆ 2 classic 2 ̆ 2 approaches to explaining behavior. ^ Chapters Two, Three and Four test this model by examining the reorganizational and budget decisions of the Nixon, Carter and Reagan administrations. Chapter Two demonstrates that Richard Nixon 2 ̆ 7 s belief in the individual 2 ̆ 7 s power to control one 2 ̆ 7 s life best explains his decisions to decentralize government through reorganization and revenue sharing. Chapter Three concludes that Jimmy Carter 2 ̆ 7 s belief in a progressive agenda to democratize government best explains his decision to reorganize government from the 2 ̆ 2 bottom-up 2 ̆ 2 and {{through the use of}} zero base <b>budgeting.</b> <b>Chapter</b> Four finds that Ronald Reagan 2 ̆ 7 s decisions to reorganize the executive branch from 2 ̆ 2 within 2 ̆ 2 and to alter the budget process are best explained by his belief in government as an agent for social change, but only in specific areas of activity. ^ Chapter Five concludes the research by briefly examining the Bush presidency, and concludes that Bush, like Jimmy Carter, is a president more concerned with 2 ̆ 2 process 2 ̆ 2 than 2 ̆ 2 policy. 2 ̆ 2 Each 2 ̆ 2 classic 2 ̆ 2 methodology is demonstrated to be flawed, and the 2 ̆ 2 belief 2 ̆ 2 model is shown to best explain the behavior of each president. For that reason, the project closes, political science under-appreciates the role of political belief in decision making. ...|$|R

40|$|The public {{discussion}} about the probability of asymmetric shocks in Europe has not lost any of its topicality {{since the start of}} European Economic and Monetary Union. Hence, this paper asks which mechanisms of adjustment are in principle suitable for the compensation of such asymmetric shocks. Chapter one gives some introductory notes on the consequences of the common European monetary policy. Chapter two is dedicated to the existing market-based instruments; a special emphasis is given to the role of international labour mobility {{as well as to the}} flexibility of relative regional prices. In the next two chapters, this contribution examines institutional mechanisms of adjustment; chapter three analyses the role of automatic stabilisers, the possible stabilising effects of the EU budget, the consequences of the EU structural aid and finally the merits and probabilities of setting in place a European system of fiscal equalisation. Chapter four is dedicated to the discussion of discretionary mechanisms against asymmetric shocks, mainly national fiscal policies and discretionary EU <b>budget</b> transfers. <b>Chapter</b> five deals with a regional approach to absorb asymmetric shocks. 1 The authors want to thank Nilgün Terzibaş for technical assistance and helpful comments...|$|R
