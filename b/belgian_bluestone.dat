2500|$|According to the American Association of Port Authorities, {{the port}} of Antwerp was the seventeenth largest (by tonnage) port {{in the world in}} 2005 and second only to Rotterdam in Europe. Importantly it handles high volumes of {{economically}} attractive general and project cargo, as well as bulk cargo. Antwerp's docklands, with five oil refineries, are home to a massive concentration of petrochemical industries, second only to the petrochemical cluster in Houston, Texas. [...] Electricity generation is also an important activity, with four nuclear power plants at Doel, a conventional power station in Kallo, as well as several smaller combined cycle plants. There is a wind farm {{in the northern part of}} the port area. There are plans to extend this in the period 2014â€“2020. [...] The old <b>Belgian</b> <b>bluestone</b> quays bordering the Scheldt for a distance of [...] to the north and south of the city centre have been retained for their sentimental value and are used mainly by cruise ships and short sea shipping.|$|E
40|$|Construction {{is a field}} {{which is}} {{concerned}} by environment. Tools as environmental product declarations are increasingly often used to compare several products and {{to take account of}} the environmental sphere in the choice. Environmental declarations of <b>Belgian</b> <b>bluestone</b> and sandstone products were realized in accordance with the ISO standards and following the standard NF P 01 - 010. The main goals of these studies were to obtain Belgian environmental product declarations to strengthen existing databases and to provide defences against Asian competition. Indeed, competition with China for bluestone products and with India for sandstone pavement is very important due the fact of the very competitive prices for foreign products. The impacts on climate change, resources and acidification of the sole transport were taken into account for foreign products and they are at less as important as these obtained for the whole life cycle of Belgian products.

40|$|This study {{performs}} the environmental product declarations for three Belgian mineral products, two granite and one sandstone paving. Both main goals {{of this work}} were to obtain Belgian environmental product declarations to strengthen existing databases and to get similar information for their Asian counterparts. Indeed, competition with China for bluestone products and with India for sandstone pavement is very important due to very competitive prices despite their foreign origin and possibly higher induced environmental impacts. Environmental product declarations of <b>Belgian</b> <b>bluestone</b> and sandstone products were conducted {{in accordance with the}} ISO standards and following the stand-ard NF P 01 - 010. CML 2001 method was used to obtain environmental impacts for ten categories as climate change, acidification, abiotic resources depletion, etc. Boundaries of the Belgian systems are the same and the life cycle assessment comprises all steps from the extraction of minerals to the implementation on site. Use and end of life steps were neglected due to the low required maintenance and the inert nature of the paving. For Asian products, the analysis is reduced to the transportation of the functional unit, mainly {{due to the lack of}} reliable data. This work highlights the negative effect of long distance transportation of heavy and non-energetic products. Indeed, the environmental impacts of the sole transport of Asian products are at least as important as those obtained for the whole life cycle of Belgian products, whatever the category taken into account (climate change, acidification, air pollution, etc.). CML 2001 methodology was successfully applied to these five studies about three Belgian products and two abroad transportation steps. Comparison of the 5 corresponding environmental product declarations permits to highlight the importance of the transport on environment and to promote, supposing equal performance, local prod-ucts in a more environmental-friendly point of view.
