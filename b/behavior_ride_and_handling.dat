40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{a comparison}} of performance for an active antiroll bar (ARB) system using two types of control strategy. First of all, the LQG control strategy is investigated and then a novel LQG CNF fusion control method is developed to improve the performances on vehicle <b>ride</b> <b>and</b> <b>handling</b> for an active antiroll bar system. However, the ARB system has to balance the trade-off between <b>ride</b> <b>and</b> <b>handling</b> performance, where the CNF consists of a linear feedback law and a nonlinear feedback law. Typically, the linear feedback is designed to yield a quick response at the initial stage, while the nonlinear feedback law is used to smooth out overshoots in the system output when it approaches the target reference. The half car model is combined with a linear single track model with roll dynamics which are used for the analysis <b>and</b> simulation of <b>ride</b> <b>and</b> <b>handling.</b> The performances of the control strategies are compared and the simulation results show the LQG CNF fusion improves the performances in vehicle <b>ride</b> <b>and</b> <b>handling...</b>|$|R

40|$|Design of {{a vehicle}} {{suspension}} involves a difficult compromise among the <b>ride,</b> <b>handling</b> <b>and</b> directional control performance characteristics. While a soft suspension is desired to enhance ride quality, hard suspension springs are required to achieve good <b>handling</b> <b>and</b> directional control performance. Auxiliary roll stiffeners, in conjunction with soft suspension, are frequently used to attain an acceptable compromise between <b>ride</b> <b>and</b> <b>handling</b> performance {{of a vehicle}}. Alternatively, an improved compromise between <b>ride</b> <b>and</b> <b>handling</b> can be realized by interconnecting hydro-pneumatic suspension struts in the roll plane. The interconnected suspension can provide soft suspension rate for improved <b>ride</b> quality, <b>and</b> firm roll stiffness and damping for adequate <b>handling</b> <b>and</b> control performance. In this dissertation, a hydro-pneumatic suspension, interconnected in the roll plane, is analytically investigated for its <b>ride</b> <b>and</b> <b>handling</b> performance potentials. A highway bus equipped with the interconnected hydro-pneumatic suspension system is modeled in the roll plane as a four-degrees-of-freedom dynamical system subject to excitations arising from road irregularities and roll moment caused by directional maneuvers. The static and dynamic properties of the interconnected suspension are derived and {{discussed in terms of}} its load-carrying capacity, suspension rate, roll stiffness, and damping forces. The <b>ride</b> <b>and</b> <b>handling</b> performance characteristics of the interconnected suspension are deterministic excitations. A passive variable damping mechanism is proposed and investigated to achieve improved vehicle ride quality. The vibration isolation performance characteristics of the interconnected suspension employing the variable damping valves are further investigated for deterministic and random excitations. From the computer simulation results, it is concluded that the interconnected hydro-pneumatic suspension with inherent enhanced anti-roll stiffness and damping characteristics can provide an improved compromise between <b>ride</b> comfort <b>and</b> <b>handling</b> performance of a vehicle...|$|R
40|$|The paper deals {{primarily}} with MIRA's contribution {{in the areas}} of vehicle <b>ride</b> <b>and</b> <b>handling.</b> Vehicle <b>ride</b> <b>and</b> <b>handling</b> are defined in broad terms to delineate the areas under consideration, ride being concerned with passenger reaction, <b>and</b> <b>handling</b> with the driver-vehicle relationship. The most difficult problem of all <b>ride</b> <b>and</b> <b>handling</b> studies is considered to be the human subject since human variability, adaptability, sensitivity and absence of a fixed scale of values render study in the simpler engineering senses difficult. Instrumentation systems used in the measurement of vehicle <b>ride</b> <b>and</b> <b>handling</b> studies are considered in a general way. A typical ride instrumentation system is illustrated. Assessment of vehicle ride is considered under two headings, subjective and objective. The methods for subjective assessment of stimuli are discussed and as an illustration of the techniques involved the design of a subjective ride experiment is given. Brief details of the objective measurement technique and the ways of analysing the subsequent data are presented, and typical spectra obtained from the data analysis are shown. The correlation between the subjective and objective results is discussed. Objective assessment of vehicle handling is considered in some detail. The ways of determining steady state behaviour based on the under/over-steer concept are detailed. The use of a tethered testing technique to over-come difficulties of steady state testing while braking and under limiting adhesion conditions is outlined. Assessment of handling under transient conditions is investigated by means of step input and frequency response tests. Typical results are used to illustrate vehicle behaviour. Further <b>ride</b> work <b>and</b> subjective assessment of handling are briefly discussed, as are probable future techniques that may be used in the assessment of vehicle <b>ride</b> <b>and</b> <b>handling...</b>|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} optimal control for semi-active vehicle suspensions. A specific goal is to develop an algorithm which is capable of optimising <b>ride</b> <b>and</b> <b>handling</b> behaviour simultaneously in an experimental situation. A time-domain optimal control approach is adopted in which <b>ride</b> <b>and</b> <b>handling</b> are modelled as exogenous disturbances acting on the vehicle: road disturbances (modelled stochastically), and driver inputs (treated as deterministic quasi-static disturbances). A control algorithm is derived from a solution of the stochastic Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equation for the finite horizon case. The advantages of the approach are demonstrated experimentally on a test vehicle performing a steering manoeuvre on a bumpy roundabout...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a comparison of}} <b>ride</b> <b>and</b> <b>handling</b> analysis for an active anti-roll bar system using various types of controller. Work using conventional and modern control approaches has been investigated by previous researches. This study further extends this work by investigating a particular modern control technique using a linear quadratic regulator, linear quadratic Gaussian and composite nonlinear feedback controller in designing the closed loop feedback for an anti-roll bar system control scheme. A simple linear quadratic regulator and a linear quadratic Gaussian are first investigated. An active anti-roll bar system has to balance the trade-off between <b>ride</b> comfort <b>and</b> <b>handling</b> performance. The new linear quadratic Gaussian composite nonlinear feedback (LQG-CNF) fusion control strategy is developed to improve the performances on vehicle <b>ride</b> comfort <b>and</b> <b>handling</b> for an active anti-roll bar system. The linear half car model is combined with a single track model with roll dynamics.

40|$|<b>Ride</b> <b>and</b> <b>handling</b> are {{important}} areas {{for safety and}} improved vehicle control during driving. To meet the demands on <b>ride</b> <b>and</b> <b>handling</b> a number of measures can be taken. This master thesis work {{has focused on the}} early design phase. At the early phases of design, the level of details is low and the design freedom is big. By introducing a tool to support the early vehicle body design, the potential of finding more efficient structures increases. In this study, topology optimization of a vehicle front structure has been performed using OptiStruct by Altair Engineering. The objective has been to find the optimal topology of beams and rods to achieve high stiffness of the front structure for improved <b>ride</b> <b>and</b> <b>handling.</b> Based on topology optimization a proposal for a beam layout in the front structure area has been identified. A vital part of the project has been to describe how to use topology optimization as a tool in the design process. During the project different approaches has been studied to come from a large design space to a low weight architecture based on a beam-like structure. The different approaches will be described and our experience and recommendations will be presented. Also the general result of a topology-optimized architecture for vehicle body stiffness will be presented...|$|R
