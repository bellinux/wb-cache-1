40|$|Using {{secondary}} data analysis, {{this paper}} examines the societal impact of mainland Chinese expectant mothers who gave birth in Hong Kong (HK). In 2009, 45. 4 % of live births {{were born to}} this group of women, compared to 10. 2 % in 1995. These women agreed unanimously that giving birth in HK would secure {{the future of their}} child with permanent residency, access to free education, subsidised health care, social welfare benefits and a better standard of living. For parents who choose to have more than one child, cross-border birthing can provide an opportunity to bypass China’s one-child policy. This rising trend has put heavy pressure on the already stretched obstetric services at the expense of local women. The Hospital Authority (HA) responsible for public hospitals acknowledged that in the 2004 - 5 financial year, 1 670 mainland women failed to pay HK$ 12. 64 million (USD 1. 63 m) in hospital bills; and in 2005 - 6, 2 138 women defaulted HK$ 28. 58 m (USD 3. 68 m). In response to protests at this situation and the lack of an effective policy, HA introduced an obstetric package in February 2007. Non-local expectant mothers must now pay HK$ 39 000 (USD 5 000) in advance to cover one antenatal visit, delivery service and delivery-related hospitalisation for three days; non-compliant women would be charged HK$ 48 000 (USD 6 154). Mainland women who are over 28 weeks’ gestation are now denied entry at immigration checkpoint if {{they do not have a}} prior booking. Between February and December 2007, an HA audit showed a 229 % increase in booking for public hospitals alone and secured HK$ 257. 4 m (USD 33 m) in fees. Non-compliant cases and last-minute hospital admissions were significantly reduced. In addition to the high <b>bill</b> <b>settlement</b> rate, this policy has provided a steady workload and training opportunities for many health care providers. If these new citizens remain in HK, they may contribute to the prosperity as well as alleviating the ageing population of HK...|$|E

50|$|In 1982 Pine Tree Legal Assistance, Thomas Tureen, and Richard Hayward {{constructed}} a <b>settlement</b> <b>bill</b> {{which was then}} proposed to congress. Through this proposed <b>settlement</b> <b>bill</b> the Western Pequots {{would be able to}} gain instant federal recognition through congress. This approach allowed the tribe to avoid going through the much harsher and longer Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) which the Western Pequots would have almost certainly {{not have been able to}} pass as they did not have any sort of complete historical records or way to be certain of “blood quantum.” At the Congressional hearing concerning the tribe and the proposed <b>settlement</b> <b>bill</b> the Western Pequots were represented by Thomas Tureen, Skip Hayward, and another lawyer by the name of Jackson King. King worked out a deal with Tureen that in the proposed <b>settlement</b> <b>bill</b> they would ask the federal government to give the Western Pequots enough money to buy out the landowners he was representing. On February 24, 1983 the Pequot <b>settlement</b> <b>bill</b> was approved by the Senate. Unexpectedly, however, then President Ronald Reagan vetoed the bill, stating that if the Pequots were granted federal recognition it would set a dangerous precedent for other tribes as well as stating that the state of Connecticut was not paying its fair share of the settlement. However, through intense lobbying and the help of Senator Lowell Weicker and Indian lobbyist Susan Harjo the Western Pequots were able to line up enough votes to threaten to override the veto. Rather than possibly suffer the embarrassment of being overridden on such a small bill, President Reagan made a compromise with the Western Pequots, and the tribe was granted federal recognition as the Mashantucket Pequot Tribe of Connecticut.|$|R

Besides the degree of difficulty in deriving appropriate charging policies agreeable by a concerned party, there are substantial technical challenges {{to come up with}} a good usage-based accounting system.

This system consists of dedicated traffic capturing card(s) to improve its performance, an agent which generates flow and packet records based on application signatures, and a server which classifies applications precisely with our novel classification algorithm and correlates sub-flows of incoming and outgoing directions if necessary.

The {{purpose of this paper is}} to investigate the customers’ understanding of the term ‘internet banking’ and how they experience this service. This paper will also try to identify the factors influencing their knowledge towards Internet banking. This paper will provide suggestions to the banking institutions on how to implement this Internet banking in the most efficient way in term of gaining the high quality Internet banking services. This research was carried out qualitatively. Selected customers from the various government departments were interviewed and their responses were recorded, transcribed, interpreted, and analysed based on the theme(s) of the research. Data were collected through an in-depth, open-ended interview method. The criteria for selecting the participants are their educations, occupations, ages, and their gender. Participants were 10 government officers in the various departments in Dungun, Terengganu. This research found that generally most of the participants understand the concept of internet banking. The sources of their knowledge are from banks, work experiences, friends, readings, and promotional activities through advertisements. Most of them have experiences of using IB for bill payment, Inter-bank Fund Transfer, Loan Payment, Balance Enquiry, credit card payment and also checking the summary of payments...|$|R
