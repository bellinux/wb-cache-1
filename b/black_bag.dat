A bag matching the description was later found in a nearby desert area containing 9mm ammunition, and it is believed to belong to Loughner. Later that morning, at approximately 7:30a.m., Loughner was stopped by an Arizona Game and Fish Department officer after running a red light, but was released with a reminder when it was determined that he did not have any outstanding warrants.|$|E

The body bag was placed on a white table at the rail of the ship, and the table was tipped to let the body bag slide into the sea, but the body bag did not slide and took the table with it. The table bobbed on the surface while the weighted body sank.|$|E

500|$|The {{investigations}} and surveillance would, in part, assess how the anti-Vietnam War movement could damage Nixon's campaign. Nixon's staff also {{anticipated that the}} Democratic campaign would employ the services of Intertel, a private investigation firm led by former Department of Justice officials who had served under Robert F. Kennedy, a Democrat and former Attorney General. Caulfield noted that this firm {{had the potential to}} employ [...] "formidable and sophisticated" [...] intelligence-gathering techniques, and Sandwedge was his attempt to create a Republican counterpart to it. The plan would involve <b>black</b> <b>bag</b> operations, targeting political enemies of the campaign. Electronic surveillance was also an element of the proposal, with plans to scrutinize the private lives of the targets, including their tax records and sexual habits. The Sandwedge proposal also included a list of people willing to work with Caulfield on the project; these included several investigators and officials of Inland Revenue, and a former sheriff of Cook County, Illinois.|$|E
500|$|The play {{opens with}} Marjorie Taylor in bed, in 1905. [...] Wife of small town doctor Joseph Taylor, {{she has just}} had a son. [...] The people of the town predict great things for Joseph Taylor, Jr., or Joe as he will {{come to be called}} (Musical number: [...] "Joseph Taylor, Jr."). [...] Joe learns what a baby learns: the comforting {{presence}} of his mother, the presence of another figure, who does not smell as nice, and who always leaves as soon as he picks up his <b>black</b> <b>bag.</b> [...] Joe is seen as a baby and then not again as a child; the audience takes his perspective. [...] Joe's Grandma notices him trying to walk, calls for Marjorie to witness the first steps, and once he takes them, as the chorus states, [...] "the world belongs to Joe" [...] ("One Foot, Other Foot"). [...] Joe grows to school age, and loses his beloved Grandma. [...] He is comforted by Jennie Brinker, a businessman's daughter. [...] The two grow to high school age and date, though Joe lacks the nerve to kiss her, to Jennie's frustration. [...] As Joe prepares to leave for college, Dr. Taylor hopes that his son will help him in his medical practice, and he and Marjorie wonder if Joe will marry Jennie ("A Fellow Needs a Girl").|$|E
2500|$|Charles Goetzinger {{conducted}} an experiment using the mere-exposure {{effect on his}} class at Oregon State University. Goetzinger had a student come to class in a large <b>black</b> <b>bag</b> with only his feet visible. The <b>black</b> <b>bag</b> sat {{on a table in}} the back of the classroom. Goetzinger's experiment was to observe if the students would treat the <b>black</b> <b>bag</b> in accordance to Zajonc's mere-exposure effect. His hypothesis was confirmed. The students in the class first treated the <b>black</b> <b>bag</b> with hostility, which over time turned into curiosity, and eventually friendship. This experiment confirms Zajonc's mere-exposure effect, by simply presenting the <b>black</b> <b>bag</b> over and over again to the students their attitudes were changed, or as Zajonc states [...] "mere repeated exposure of the individual to a stimulus is a sufficient condition for the enhancement of his attitude toward it".|$|E

2500|$|The New Palace {{became the}} target of Fenian bombs on 24January 1885, along with the Tower of London. The first bomb, a <b>black</b> <b>bag</b> {{containing}} dynamite, was discovered by a visitor on the steps towards the Chapel of St Mary Undercroft. Police Constable (PC) William Cole attempted to carry it to New Palace Yard, but the bag became so hot that Cole dropped it and it exploded. The blast opened a crater in the floor [...] in diameter, damaged {{the roof of the}} Chapel and shattered all the windows in the Hall, including the stained-glass South Window at St Stephen's Porch. Both Cole and PC Cox, a colleague who had joined him to offer assistance, were seriously injured. A second explosion followed almost immediately in the Commons Chamber, causing great damage—especially to its south end—but no injuries, as it was empty at the time. The incident resulted in the closure of Westminster Hall to visitors for several years; when visitors were re-admitted in 1889, it was under certain restrictions and never while the two Houses were sitting.|$|E

40|$|Source {{separation}} {{is a common}} method {{for dealing with the}} increasing problem of Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) in society. The citizens are then responsible for separating waste fractions produced in their home. If the consumers fail to sort the waste according to the source separation scheme, it will lead to an ineffective system. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to analyze the environmental, economic and social aspects of incorrect waste sorting in a medium sized Swedish city that has established a source separation system. In order to determine the extent to which citizens correctly sort their waste, food waste (<b>black</b> <b>bags)</b> and combustible fraction (white bags), were collected randomly from a residential area and categorized in different waste fractions. The results show that approximately 68 wt% of the waste in the white and 29 wt% in the <b>black</b> <b>bags</b> were not sorted correctly. This incorrect sorting accrues over 13 million SEK per year cost for this community. In order to improve the inhabitants’ participation in the waste management system, it is necessary to change different factors such as convenience and easy access to the recycling stations in the local MSW management systems as well as to review current regulation and policy...|$|R

Obata cited Devilmans Akira Fudou when stating that he believed that <b>black</b> <b>bags</b> were appealing.

Obata believes that the design evokes [...] "a feeling of mystery" [...] and that the reader cannot determine Ls true thoughts. Obata also said that the bags under Ls eyes were useful for inspiring speculation about his lifestyle and background. The outfit Obata designed for L was a [...] "simple" [...] white, long-sleeved shirt and jeans, to convey that L does not put thought into choosing his clothing.
