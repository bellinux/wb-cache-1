50|$|The {{company was}} founded in 1870 as Rei√üzeugrichter and {{manufactured}} drawing table tools. In 1874 the founder Emil Oskar Richter invented the <b>bow</b> <b>compass.</b> After switching its focus to overhead projectors in the late 1960s, it was renamed to VEB Polytechnik. After {{the collapse of the}} GDR, the remains of VEB Polytechnik were rescued in a new company called Polytechnik Frankenberg GmbH. It produced overhead projectors and hand lever cutting machines. The new company was closed in 2006.|$|E
40|$|Abstract- In {{the past}} all {{engineering}} students took a drafting class. This involved {{the use of}} T-squares, triangles, architectural scales, pounce, eraser shields, <b>bow</b> <b>compasses,</b> pencils, and patience. It gave students {{a sense of how}} drawings and diagrams are made and used. As new subjects have come into the curriculum most engineering programs have dropped the drafting requirement, or at least replaced it with a computerbased CAD course. Also dropped, as a consequence, is the ability of engineering students to visually express the ideas they see in class and those that form in their heads. This paper describes the effort to address this change. This project {{is the result of a}} joint effort between an engineering and an art professor to empower students with the simple skills of producing reliable hand drawings for their notes and when expressing their design ideas. The result is a one-hour, lunch-time seminar open to engineering and science students to improve their technical freehand sketching techniques. They were coached by both professors in the techniques of hand sketching, including drawing straight and orthogonal lines, circles and ellipses, 2 - and 3 -D diagrams, graphs and charts, and labeling and lettering. Specific activities were used to gauge the improvement by the students as they progressed through the onesemester mini-course. This paper shares the best and the worst of this endeavor.

By the time she reached 150 ft, her gyrocompass was again working and she began turning slowly to starboard. The destroyer was kept astern.|$|R
50|$|A <b>bow</b> {{window or}} <b>compass</b> window is a curved bay window. Bow windows are {{designed}} to create space by projecting beyond the exterior wall of a building, {{and to provide a}} wider view of the garden or street outside and typically combine four or more casement windows, which join together to form an arch.|$|R
5000|$|Several objects may {{be found}} to assist {{navigation}} and survival: a fishing rod, <b>compass,</b> <b>bow</b> and binoculars. Unlike in many survival games, these tools are simply found and {{do not need to}} be crafted. The game can present items in multiple locations depending on how the player chooses to explore. In an article on Kotaku, Luke Plunkett discussed Eidolon as a development of the survival genre, noting that it was distinguished from earlier games in the genre by the easy and forgiving nature of the gameplay, as well as its [...] "peaceful" [...] atmosphere.|$|R
