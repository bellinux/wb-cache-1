25|$|Primary {{batteries}} {{readily available}} to consumers range from tiny <b>button</b> <b>cells</b> used for electric watches, to the No. 6 cell used for signal circuits or other long duration applications. Secondary cells are made in very large sizes; very large batteries can power a submarine or stabilize an electrical grid and help level out peak loads.|$|E
25|$|In {{the mid-1970s}} the first calculators {{appeared}} with field-effect, twisted nematic (TN) LCDs with dark numerals against a grey background, though the early ones often had a yellow filter over them {{to cut out}} damaging ultraviolet rays. The advantage of LCDs {{is that they are}} passive light modulators reflecting light, which require much less power than light-emitting displays such as LEDs or VFDs. This led the way to the first credit-card-sized calculators, such as the Casio Mini Card LC-78 of 1978, which could run for months of normal use on <b>button</b> <b>cells.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Lithium is {{the metal}} with lowest density {{and with the}} {{greatest}} electrochemical potential and energy-to-weight ratio. [...] The low atomic weight and small size of its ions also speeds its diffusion. [...] So theory suggests it would make an ideal material for batteries. Experimentation with lithium batteries began in 1912 under [...] G.N. Lewis, and in the 1970s the first lithium batteries came onto the market. [...] Three volt lithium primary cells such as the CR123A type and three volt <b>button</b> <b>cells</b> are still widely used, especially in cameras and very small devices. [...] Energizer and other brands market 1.5 volt lithium primary cells, with advantages for some applications over alkaline cells.|$|E
2500|$|Batteries may {{be harmful}} or fatal if swallowed. Small <b>button</b> <b>cells</b> can be swallowed, in {{particular}} by young children. While in the digestive tract, the battery's electrical discharge {{may lead to}} tissue damage; such damage is occasionally serious {{and can lead to}} death. Ingested disk batteries do not usually cause problems unless they become lodged in the gastrointestinal tract. The most common place for disk batteries to become lodged is the esophagus, resulting in clinical sequelae. Batteries that successfully traverse the esophagus are unlikely to lodge elsewhere. The likelihood that a disk battery will lodge in the esophagus {{is a function of the}} patient's age and battery size. Disk batteries of 16mm have become lodged in the esophagi of 2 children younger than 1 year. [...] Older children do not have problems with batteries smaller than 21–23mm. Liquefaction necrosis may occur because sodium hydroxide is generated by the current produced by the battery (usually at the anode). Perforation has occurred as rapidly as 6 hours after ingestion.|$|E

Solid oxide technology is capable of both power generation and hydrogen production. That {{makes it possible for}} the development of a reversible solid-oxide system that can respond to market conditions to produce electricity or hydrogen on demand. New high-temperature electrolyzer cell materials are needed to enable cost-effective hydrogen production system designs based on reversible steam electrolysis. Two test methods were established for the eventual development of the reversible, durable electrode materials: the <b>button</b> <b>cell</b> test and the oxygen electrode test. The <b>button</b> <b>cell</b> test is capable of evaluating the performance and degradation of full solid oxide cells with dual atmosphere of air and hydrogen-steam.

Higher-power devices such as hearing aids, where high capacity is important and low self-discharge less so as the cell will usually be used up before it has time to discharge, may use zinc-air cells which have much higher capacity for a given size, but dry out over a few weeks even if not used.|$|E
