5|$|A {{chelator}} for binding a radioisotope can <b>be</b> <b>attached.</b> Pendetide, {{a derivative}} of pentetic acid, {{is used for}} example in capromab pendetide to chelate indium-111.

Consequently, indium (111In) capromab pendetide is the name for the above example including indium-111.|$|E

The cylinders are isolated from the manifold when closed, and the manifold can <b>be</b> <b>attached</b> or disconnected while the cylinders are pressurised.|$|E

5|$|Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, {{like all}} dinucleotides, {{consists}} of two nucleosides joined {{by a pair of}} bridging phosphate groups. The nucleosides each contain a ribose ring, one with adenine attached to the first carbon atom (the 1' position) and the other with nicotinamide at this position. The nicotinamide moiety can <b>be</b> <b>attached</b> in two orientations to this anomeric carbon atom. Because of these two possible structures, the compound exists as two diastereomers. It is the β-nicotinamide diastereomer of NAD that is found in organisms. These nucleotides are joined together by a bridge of two phosphate groups through the 5' carbons.|$|E
