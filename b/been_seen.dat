5|$|As a character, Spencer has <b>been</b> <b>seen</b> as an everyman figure, his blank {{expression}} and plain dress keeping him a simple archetype.

5|$|CSF {{returns to}} the {{vascular}} system by entering the dural venous sinuses via arachnoid granulations.

CSF has also <b>been</b> <b>seen</b> to drain into lymphatic vessels, particularly those surrounding the nose via drainage along the olfactory nerve through the cribriform plate. The pathway and extent are currently not known, but may involve CSF flow along some cranial nerves and be more prominent in the neonate. CSF turns over {{at a rate of}} three to four times a day.
