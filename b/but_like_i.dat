Buck said, [...] "The verses {{are the kinds of}} things R.E.M. uses a lot, going from one minor to another, kind [...] like those 'Driver 8' chords.

[...] Buck noted that [...] "Losing My Religion" [...] was [...] "probably the most typical R.E.M.-sounding song on the record. We are trying to get away from those kind of songs, <b>but</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> said before, those are some good chords." [...] Orchestral strings play through parts of the song. The song is in natural minor.|$|E

The Miller Lite Ford Fusion was just flying, and this is I'm couldn't ask for a better way to enter the Chase than to win and take the first seed. We're ready. We want to run for another Cup. We really feel like this team has it."

However, {{if it is true that}} I am a problem for my team then I will go. <b>But</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> said, I am happy here. The press can write what they want." [...] Following the comments, Barcelona President Joan Laporta was quick to quash rumours of transfers involving Eto'o and Ronaldinho.|$|E

[...] We didn't have quite enough,” Newman said. “That's disappointing, <b>but</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> said, it was an awesome team effort, and I think, again, this is a great racetrack to have a race like this, and I thought there was some amazing passing, and we don't get that at every racetrack.” ...|$|E

To win for RUSSIAN TIME after only four races of {{existence}} is a very good feeling." [...] He believed that he may have pushed too hard at the wrong time in the race, [...] "it was just a case of keeping it on the racing line and hoping they'd battle it out behind me. Felipe's car was like a rocket at the end. Big thanks to my new team: to win in our fourth race, with no pre-season testing, is amazing." [...] Nasr spoke about car management and maintaining the pace levels with the leaders and believed he could have won in an alternative situation, [...] "But anyway, it’s still a good result.
