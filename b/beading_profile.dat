This is quite the opposite of traditional subtractive manufacturing where components are formed from an oversized raw material, forming the desired shape of a component involves the removal of unwanted material by means of various machining processes such as milling, shaping, turning and others.

The T-GMAW process was used in pulse-pulse mode on 6 mm plain carbon steel plate to determine the effect of welding travel speed (WTS) (1. 0 - 2. 0 m/min) and contact-tip-to-workpiece distance (CTWD) (20 - 35 mm) on weld metal microstructure and <b>bead</b> <b>profile.</b> In this mode, the leading and trailing welding wires alternately transfer metal into a single molten weld pool at welding travel speeds much greater than those used in conventional single-wire {{gas metal arc}} welding (GMAW).

40|$|This study {{attempts}} {{to develop a}} set of parameters controlling the <b>bead</b> <b>profile</b> of deposits in powder melting, based on the spatial energy distribution of laser. Four parameters, identified as the laser material interaction parameters were used to study the <b>bead</b> <b>profile</b> formation in powder melting. The focus is put on control of the dimensional accuracy of powder deposits independently of the optical set-up and laser system. In the initial stage to understand the effect of welding parameters {{on the development of}} the fusion zone, a solid metal with homogenous and known thermal properties was used. The results indicate that for large beam diameters, typically used in cladding, power density and interaction time control the depth of penetration and beam diameter and interaction time controls the weld width. However, for small beam diameters, typically used in powder bed additive manufacturing, it was found that it is more difficult to achieve steady state conduction welds due to high conduction losses to the bulk material and rapid transition to keyhole regime. Therefore, with small beam diameters it is challenging to achieve pure conduction welds, which should guarantee good quality of deposits and low spatter. In the second part, the melting behaviour of solid material and powder for the same material type was compared. The build height in powder melting depends on layer thickness of the deposited powder and energy density, which needs to be provided to fuse the powder to the workpiece, which is equivalent to penetration in laser welding of solids. Similar to solid melting, the build width in powder melting is controlled by beam diameter and the interaction time. It was also found that with small beam diameters and large particle sizes it is more difficult to generate keyhole in the base plate, as compared to solid material. Therefore, despite the presence of spatter in the process, a full keyhole is often not generated. A set of parameters to describe the conduction welding process based on spatial distribution of laser energy has been developed. This enables achievement of a particular weld profile with various optical set-ups and potentially transfers of results between machines. However, more complex melting characteristics of powder requires some additional factors to be included to develop a similar model for powders...|$|R

40|$|In welding, {{the depth}} of penetration, weld profile and the {{corresponding}} thermal cycle are the three basic outcomes that a user wishes to control flexibly. In laser welding applications, controlled application of power and energy density {{is the key to}} achieve predictable control of these characteristics. Creation of an analytical model is an important step towards understanding the underpinning science of laser metal interaction in controlling the depth, bead geometry and thereby temperature profile of a weld. The “power factor model”, which correlates the power applied per unit length to the laser metal interaction time, has been originally developed and validated for mild steel, guides a user on the selection laser system parameters, to achieve specific weld profile. This study is performed to extend the power factor–interaction time model to aluminium alloys by understanding the underpinning laser aluminium interaction parameters in terms of power density, interaction time, specific point energy and their correlation with the weld <b>bead</b> <b>profiles.</b> Although the power factor and interaction time showed a rectangular hyperbolic relationship, as observed in low carbon steel, for a specific weld depth and profile, the absolute magnitude and the characteristic profile of the curve is different due to the intrinsic differences in physical and thermal properties of aluminium as compared to steel. It was shown that identical depth of penetration but different weld metal profile can be obtained for a specific beam diameter for a range of power and travel speed by keeping the energy input per unit length constant...|$|R
