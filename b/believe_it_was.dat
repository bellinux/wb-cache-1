5|$|In 1950, Cornwall County Council and Plymouth City Council {{discussed}} {{the feasibility of}} building a road bridge. The government was unenthusiastic about the idea, as they did not <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> financially viable and there were more urgent projects in post-war Britain. After being rebuked, both councils agreed to self-fund the entire project, which would be paid for in tolls. The scheme received Royal Assent in July 1957. Invitations to tender were sent on 4 March 1959, and a proposal from the northeast England-based Cleveland Bridge & Engineering Company was accepted on 9 June.|$|E

5|$|Modern {{scholars}} {{debate whether}} the Ming dynasty had sovereignty over Tibet. Some <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> {{a relationship of}} loose suzerainty that was largely cut off when the Jiajing Emperor (r. 1521–67) persecuted Buddhism in favor of Daoism at court. Others argue that the significant religious {{nature of the relationship}} with Tibetan lamas is underrepresented in modern scholarship. Others note the Ming need for Central Asian horses and the need to maintain the tea-horse trade.|$|E
5|$|One catechesis of Symeon's, On Faith, {{along with}} a {{composite}} work titled One Hundred and Fifty-Three Practical and Theological Texts, {{are included in the}} Philokalia, a collection of texts by early Christian mystics. Another text in the Philokalia, titled The Three Methods of Prayer is also attributed to Symeon—it describes a method of practicing the Jesus Prayer that includes direction on correct posture and breathing while reciting the prayer. It is extremely unlikely that he wrote that text—some scholars attribute it to Nikiphoros the Monk, while others <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> written by disciples of Symeon.|$|E

5|$|Amenemhat IV {{first came}} to power as a junior coregent of his {{predecessor}} Amenemhat III, whose reign marks {{the apex of the}} Middle Kingdom period. The coregency is well attested by numerous monuments and artefacts where the names of the two kings parallel each other. The length of this coregency is uncertain; it could have lasted from one to seven years, although most scholars <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> only two years long. The Turin Canon, a king list redacted during the early Ramesside period, records Amenemhat IV on Column 6, Row 1, and credits him with a reign of 9 years, 3 months and 27 days. Amenemhat IV is also recorded on Entry 65 of the Abydos King List and Entry 38 of the Saqqara Tablet, both of which date to the New Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|Charles's wife, Isabeau of Bavaria, {{held the}} ball to honor the {{remarriage}} of a lady-in-waiting. Scholars <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a traditional charivari, with the dancers disguised as wild men, mythical beings often associated with demonology, that were commonly represented in medieval Europe and documented in revels of Tudor England. The event was chronicled by contemporary writers such as the Monk of St Denis and Jean Froissart, and illustrated {{in a number of}} 15th-century illuminated manuscripts by painters such as the Master of Anthony of Burgundy. The incident later provided inspiration for Edgar Allan Poe's short story Hop-Frog.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, Haifa al 'Atiqa was {{repopulated}} with many Arab Christians in an overall neighborhood {{in which many}} Middle Eastern Jews were established inhabitants, as Haifa expanded outward from its new location. The ultimate origin of the name Haifa remains unclear. One theory holds it derives from {{the name of the}} high priest Caiaphas. Some Christians <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> named for Saint Peter, whose Aramaic name was Keiphah. Another theory holds it could be derived from the Hebrew verb root חפה (hafa), meaning to cover or shield, i.e. Mount Carmel covers Haifa; others point to a possible origin in the Hebrew word חוֹף (hof), meaning shore, or חוֹף יָפֶה (hof yafe), meaning beautiful shore.|$|E

5|$|Dying {{stands of}} B. coccinea were {{observed}} in 1989, and the fungus Cryptodiaporthe melanocraspedia isolated as the cause in 1995. The disease, a form of aerial canker, manifested initially as dead dry brown leaves and the tips of new growth. Plants would die from the top downwards, with larger branches affected over time. Under the outer bark, orange and brown patches of necrosis spread out from leaf nodes until they encircle the stem, which then dies. Flower spikes may be affected during flowering season. In humid spells during warm weather, white or pink spore tendrils are produced on dead wood. One affected stand monitored over three years from October 1989 to June 1992 showed a 97% mortality of plants (compared with a baseline 40%). Investigators Bryan Shearer and colleagues isolated another virulent pathogen that they identified as a species of Zythiostroma, however it appeared to invoke an immune response in the plant. This immune response, coupled {{with the fact that}} it had not been observed in the wild, led them to <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> not a major pathogen of the species. This species has since been reclassified and named as Luteocirrhus shearii.|$|E
