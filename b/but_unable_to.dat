He left Paris {{and stayed in}} Algiers, where he recuperated until May 1889, walking and reading <b>but</b> <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> compose.|$|E
5|$|The voyage was re-attempted on 3 July, but Integrity again {{ran into}} heavy weather off Cape Howe {{and was forced}} to turn towards the shore to seek shelter. The cutter entered what would later be known as Twofold Bay on the New South Wales South Coast, where to her crew's {{surprise}} they discovered Contest, undamaged <b>but</b> <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> return to sea in the storm.|$|E
5|$|After {{the battle}} on the {{southern}} side of the Shangani was over, Forbes and his column conducted a cursory search for survivors from Wilson's party, <b>but,</b> <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> cross the river, could see nothing {{to tell them what}} had happened. Guessing (correctly) that all Company men beyond the river had been killed, they turned and trekked back to Bulawayo in miserable fashion, their supplies all but gone and the Matabele impeding their progress at every turn.|$|E

Horrified, <b>but</b> <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> escape, Daniels is returned to stasis.|$|E
5|$|Simpson {{immersed}} {{himself in}} the world of cycling, writing letters asking for advice. Naturalised Austrian rider George Berger responded, travelling from London to Harworth to help him with his riding position. In late 1955, Simpson ran a red light in a race and was suspended from racing for six months by the BLRC. During his suspension he dabbled in motorcycle trials, nearly quitting cycling <b>but</b> <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> afford a new motorcycle necessary for progress in the sport.|$|E
5|$|Barrow {{managed in}} the major leagues with the Detroit Tigers of the AL in 1903, {{finishing}} fifth, a thirteen-game improvement from their 1902 finish. With the Tigers, Barrow feuded with shortstop Kid Elberfeld. Tigers' owner Sam Angus sold the team to William Yawkey before the 1904 season. Barrow managed the Tigers again in 1904, <b>but</b> <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> coexist with Frank Navin, Yawkey's secretary-treasurer, Barrow tendered his resignation. He then managed the Montreal Royals of the Eastern League {{for the rest of the}} season. He managed the Indianapolis Indians of the Class-A American Association in 1905 and Toronto in 1906. Disheartened with baseball after finishing in last place, Barrow hired Joe Kelley to manage Toronto in 1907, and after signing the rest of the team's players, became manager of the Windsor Arms Hotel in Toronto.|$|E

Though struggling, Will tells his father of their {{imagined}} daring {{escape from the}} hospital to the nearby lake, where everyone from Edward’s past is there to see him off. Will takes Edward into the river, where he transforms into the giant catfish and swims away. A satisfied Edward dies, knowing Will finally understands his love for storytelling. At the funeral, Will and Joséphine are surprised when all the people from Edward’s stories come to the service, though each one is a slightly less fantastical version than described. Will, finally understanding his father’s love for life, passes on Edward’s stories to his own son.|$|E
5|$|In 1811, Alceste {{entered the}} Adriatic and on 4–5 May, she and Belle Poule {{participated in a}} raid at Parenza, (Istria). Having chased a brig into the harbour, <b>but</b> <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> follow due to the rocks and shallow water, the two frigates stood outside and opened fire on her and the battery {{protecting}} her. After an hour, the brig was forced to move nearer the shore, out of range. At 23:00, the British landed 200 seamen and all their marines on an island nearby, and also landed two 9-pounders and two howitzers that they placed in one battery, and a field piece that they placed further away. From there, {{they were able to}} engage the French in Parenza in a five-hour mutual bombardment. The brig was eventually destroyed and the men and cannons returned to their ships. Belle Poule had one man killed and three wounded, and Alceste had two men killed during the action. All casualties occurred ashore.|$|E
5|$|In the 1854 elections, Lincoln {{was elected}} to the Illinois {{legislature}} but declined to take his seat. In the aftermath of the elections, which showed the power and popularity of the movement opposed to the Kansas-Nebraska Act, Lincoln instead sought election to the United States Senate. At that time, senators were elected by the state legislature. After leading in the first six rounds of voting, <b>but</b> <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> obtain a majority, Lincoln instructed his backers to vote for Lyman Trumbull. Trumbull was an antislavery Democrat, and had received few votes in the earlier ballots; his supporters, also antislavery Democrats, had vowed not to support any Whig. Lincoln's decision to withdraw enabled his Whig supporters and Trumbull's antislavery Democrats to combine and defeat the mainstream Democratic candidate, Joel Aldrich Matteson.|$|E

5|$|Knott was one {{of several}} {{candidates}} seeking the Democratic gubernatorial nomination in 1883. Other prominent candidates included Congressman Thomas Laurens Jones, former Confederate general Simon Bolivar Buckner, Judge John S. Owsley, and Louisville mayor Charles Donald Jacob. Balloting began on May 16, 1883, with Jones as the leading vote-getter <b>but</b> <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> secure a majority. After four ballots, Jacob withdrew his name, and Knott moved into the lead. The following day, Owsley dropped out of the balloting, and Knott extended his lead. Though Buckner remained on the ballot, the race came down to Jones and Knott. Delegates from Owen County switched to Knott, and other counties soon followed suit. Jones withdrew, and Knott was nominated unanimously.|$|E
5|$|Nixon {{suffered}} a severe stroke on April 18, 1994, while preparing to eat dinner in his Park Ridge, New Jersey home. A blood clot {{resulting from the}} atrial fibrillation he had suffered for many years had formed in his upper heart, broken off, and traveled to his brain. He was taken to New York Hospital–Cornell Medical Center in Manhattan, initially alert <b>but</b> <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> speak or to move his right arm or leg. Damage to the brain caused swelling (cerebral edema), and Nixon slipped into a deep coma. He died at 9:08p.m. on April 22, 1994, with his daughters at his bedside. He was 81 years old.|$|E
5|$|Rowley {{dismissed}} {{this idea}} given the shattered state of Africaine and instead towed the frigate back to Île Bourbon, shadowed by Astrée and Iphigénie {{on the return}} journey. The French frigates did achieve some consolation in pursuing Rowley from a distance, running into and capturing the Honourable East India Company's armed brig Aurora, sent from India to reinforce Rowley. On 15 September, Boadicea, Africaine and the brigs arrived at Saint Paul, Africaine sheltering under the fortifications of the harbour while the others put to sea, again seeking to drive away the French blockade <b>but</b> <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> bring them to action. Bouvet returned to Port Napoleon on 18 September, and thus was not present when Rowley attacked and captured the French flagship Vénus and Commodore Hamelin at the Action of 18 September 1810.|$|E

5|$|Throughout the day {{the chase}} continued, the British frigates gaining slowly on their quarry and as {{darkness}} fell Pique closed with the larger French ship. At 23:00 Milne {{was close enough to}} open fire on Seine, to which Bigot responded without reducing speed. For the next {{two and a half hours}} the frigates exchanged broadsides at full speed as the French coastline rapidly approached ahead. At 01:35 a shot from Seine struck the main topmast on Pique, bringing it crashing down. The consequent loss of speed forced Milne back, Seine pulling away from the smaller ship <b>but</b> <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> escape Jason which was steadily gaining.|$|E
5|$|With the Fatimids and Kalb poised against him, Hassan {{appealed for}} Salih's help to {{maintain}} their tribes' virtual autonomy throughout Syria against Fatimid encroachment. Accordingly, Salih mobilized his Kilabi forces to reinforce the Tayy in Palestine. Salih and Hassan first encountered the Fatimid–Kalb army {{in the vicinity of}} Gaza, <b>but,</b> <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> halt their advance, they withdrew to the north. On 12 or 25 May 1029, the two sides fought at al-Uqhuwanah, on the eastern shores of Lake Tiberias. For unknown reasons, Hassan and his forces fled in the heat of battle, leaving Salih and his men to face off Anushtakin's army alone. The Kilab were decisively defeated and Salih, his youngest son and his vizier were slain.|$|E
5|$|Determined {{to become}} part of the fashion industry, <b>but</b> <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> make a breakthrough, Everest decided to use his {{knowledge}} of tailoring. He answered an advertisement placed in the London Evening Standard, in 1982, by Tommy Nutter; 'Boy wanted in Savile Row'. He pestered Nutter for weeks, until he was given the job. Nutter's client base included rock stars, celebrities, politicians and businessmen; he famously dressed The Beatles and The Stones. Everest also mixed with future celebrities of the fashion world. John Galliano, who had been studying at the Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design, passed on some design skills to Everest, while on work placement with Nutter. Everest met his future wife Catherine (now an actress and film producer) at this time, while she was also working with Nutter. The couple have two daughters. Everest's time under Nutter, a Savile Row revolutionary in the 1960s, inspired him to experiment with tone and pattern in his own designs. In 1986, after nearly five years as Nutter's apprentice, Everest was persuaded to move on to work for Malcolm Levene. He had become disillusioned with Savile Row, particularly with their lack of appreciation for Nutter's more modern approach. Everest found that working with Levene, a small menswear retailer based away from Savile Row, on Chiltern Street, provided a welcome change. During Everest's first year there, Levene's turnover doubled.|$|E

5|$|Further success {{followed}} in early 1777 with {{the capture of}} the 18-gun American privateer General Montgomery. News had reached England that this vessel was off the island of Madeira in March, having sailed from the Port of Philadelphia in February with a crew of 100 men. Levant was sent in pursuit, with her crew sighting the General Montgomery at midday on 8 March. Captain Murray ordered Levant to fly false colours, hoisting a Dutch flag to avoid alerting the privateer's crew. General Montgomery had also disguised herself by flying a British flag. For several hours the Americans allowed Levant to draw near, finally turning to flee when Murray fired a warning shot. A seven-hour chase ensued, extending into the night with the two ships often within musket shot <b>but</b> <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> bring their broadside cannons to bear. At around 1:00am the wind strengthened and Levant was able to overhaul her prey, forcing the out-gunned Americans to surrender. Nine of General Montgomerys crew enlisted aboard Levant, with the remainder being conveyed to Portsmouth where they remained imprisoned in poor conditions {{until the end of}} the war.|$|E
5|$|In 1928, {{she began}} writing her autobiography, {{with the support}} of a group of American admirers, {{including}} journalist H. L. Mencken, poet Edna St. Vincent Millay, novelist Theodore Dreiser and art collector Peggy Guggenheim, who raised $4,000 for her. She secured a cottage in the French coastal city of Saint-Tropez and spent two years recounting her life. Berkman offered sharply critical feedback, which she eventually incorporated at the price of a strain on their relationship. Goldman intended the book, Living My Life, as a single volume for a price the working class could afford (she urged no more than $5.00); her publisher Alfred A. Knopf, however, released it as two volumes sold together for $7.50. Goldman was furious, <b>but</b> <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> force a change. Due {{in large part to the}} Great Depression, sales were sluggish despite keen interest from libraries around the US. Critical reviews were generally enthusiastic; The New York Times, The New Yorker, and Saturday Review of Literature all listed it as one of the year's top non-fiction books.|$|E
5|$|The {{crash was}} only {{accessible}} to vehicles via a single residential street. With {{the surge of}} rescue personnel who converged on the area, the roads leading to the site soon became choked with traffic. Emergency vehicle drivers abandoned their vehicles counter to established policy {{in the course of}} the rescue efforts. This prevented other vehicles from being able to access the crash area. The road was so impassible, many rescue workers left their vehicles miles away and made it to the scene on foot. Fog also grounded rescue helicopters for two hours. As a result, many critically injured survivors were not evacuated until 23:30. Eventually, four helicopters from the New York City Police Aviation Unit evacuated 21 people from the crash site. There were also major problems with communication by rescuers. Radio frequencies became overloaded and authorities on site were unable to make command decisions in some cases. The head of surgery of the Nassau County Medical Center was present at the scene <b>but</b> <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> direct patients to the best locations because many rescuers were radioing the center itself to get advice on where they should send the survivors. Medical professionals on site reported that some hospitals received the most up-to-date information by watching the news coverage. Despite these problems, however, only three of the passengers found alive died of their injuries.|$|E
