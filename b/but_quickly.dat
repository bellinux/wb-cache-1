5|$|Magnum XL-200 {{has been}} the target of false rumors since 1998 {{claiming}} the structure was sinking due to unstable ground. The rumors supposedly started as an April Fools Day joke in an Ohio newspaper, <b>but</b> <b>quickly</b> spread via the Internet. Cedar Point quickly denounced such rumors.|$|E

The rest of the party arrived at the shore of Lake Petén Itzá, <b>but</b> <b>quickly</b> retreated back to Guatemala.|$|E

We were ushered into the house very <b>quickly,</b> <b>but</b> not so <b>quickly</b> <b>but</b> that our host, a white-haired man with a fiery face, came out quickly to meet us.|$|R

A light engine travelling towards Tulse Hill {{was waiting to}} cross the south junction when it was struck from behind by an express passenger train from Victoria that had passed a signal at danger. The driver of the light engine and two passengers from the express were hospitalised <b>but</b> <b>quickly</b> discharged.|$|E
5|$|Beyond the pass, {{the road}} descends through three more long switchbacks {{to the floor}} of the Lake Creek valley. From there it heads south at first <b>but</b> <b>quickly</b> curving to the east. As it assumes that heading it passes the other set of gates, just west of the very small {{settlement}} of Everett, near where Lake Creek's North Fork joins the main stream.|$|E
5|$|Melish likely {{held back}} {{much of the}} issue for later resale, and with few pieces available, prices for the set spiked, rising to over five times the issue price. The value dropped {{somewhat}} when the boom in commemorative coins burst in late 1936, <b>but</b> <b>quickly</b> recovered and the coins are valuable today. Melish has been assailed by numismatic writers for greed.|$|E

5|$|Opposing Force {{returns to}} the same setting as Half-Life, but instead portrays the events from the {{perspective}} of a U.S. Marine, one of the enemy characters in the original game.

5|$|The Fragrant Hill Hotel {{opened on}} 17 October 1982 <b>but</b> <b>quickly</b> fell into disrepair. A member of Pei's staff {{returned}} for a visit several years later and confirmed the dilapidated condition of the hotel. He and Pei attributed this to the country's general unfamiliarity with deluxe buildings. The Chinese architectural community at the time gave the structure little attention, as their interest at the time centered {{on the work of}} American postmodernists such as Michael Graves.|$|E
5|$|The Sultan of Oman ordered six Mercedes 450 limousines in 1977, <b>but</b> <b>quickly</b> {{discovered}} {{that they were not}} as safe as he had been led to believe. His ex-SAS bodyguards tested one of the cars in the desert in July 1977, by firing at it, but a bullet hit an emergency air cylinder, which led to the petrol tank blowing up, burning the whole car. The remaining cars were immediately sent back, with a demand to refund the money spent.|$|E

5|$|The Turkish {{army was}} at first {{quartered}} in Baghdad, <b>but</b> <b>quickly</b> came into conflict with {{the remnants of the}} old Abbasid establishment in the city and the city's populace. The latter resented their loss of influence and career opportunities to the foreign troops, who were furthermore often undisciplined and violent, spoke no Arabic, and were either recent converts to Islam or still pagans. Violent episodes between the populace and the Turks thus became more and more common.|$|E
5|$|The album debuted at #8 on the Billboard 200 {{and sold}} about 81,000 copies in its opening week, his best since Bat Out of Hell II: Back Into Hell. However, it slipped to #60 after three weeks. The album also reached #3 in the UK charts, <b>but</b> <b>quickly</b> fell off.|$|E
5|$|Tom Noonan as Francis Dollarhyde. Noonan {{credits his}} ability to improvise during rehearsals for his casting. He took up {{bodybuilding}} to prepare physically for the part. He began preparation for his role by studying other serial killers, <b>but</b> <b>quickly</b> rejected this approach. While shooting the film, Noonan remained in character at all times, keeping away from cast members playing his pursuers.|$|E

5|$|Ytterbium metal tarnishes {{slowly in}} air. Finely {{dispersed}} ytterbium readily oxidizes in air and under oxygen. Mixtures of powdered ytterbium with polytetrafluoroethylene or hexachloroethane burn with a luminous emerald-green flame. Ytterbium reacts with hydrogen to form various non-stoichiometric hydrides. Ytterbium dissolves slowly in water, <b>but</b> <b>quickly</b> in acids, liberating hydrogen gas.|$|E
5|$|After {{earning his}} {{doctoral}} degree, Fetter accepted an instructorship at Cornell, <b>but</b> <b>quickly</b> left after being offered {{a position as}} a professor at Indiana University. In 1898, Stanford University lured him away from Indiana, but Fetter resigned from Stanford three years later over a dispute regarding academic freedom. After leaving Stanford in 1901, Fetter went back to Cornell, where he remained for ten years. In 1911, he again found himself in professional transition, accepting the position of chairman in an interdisciplinary department at Princeton University which incorporated history, politics, and economics. Fetter was the first chairman of Princeton University's Department of Economics and Social institutions.|$|E
5|$|After the Ducks were {{eliminated}} {{in the first}} round of the 2008 playoffs, he again contemplated retirement, <b>but</b> <b>quickly</b> made the decision to return for the 2008–09 season. He regained captaincy of the Ducks, and played in his fifth All-Star Game during the season in which he scored 59 points in 82 games. In what proved to be his final season, 2009–10, Niedermayer scored 48 points in 80 games. He announced his retirement as a player on June 22, 2010, but remained with the Ducks organization as a consultant to general manager Bob Murray. He turned to coaching in 2012–13 season, serving as a Special Assignment Coach with the Ducks.|$|E

5|$|After {{the end of}} the war, both ships {{continued}} {{service in}} the eastern Mediterranean and Black seas. Waldeck-Rousseau joined the Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War and operated in support of the White Russians against the Red Bolsheviks; shortly after arriving, her crew mutinied over poor conditions <b>but</b> <b>quickly</b> resumed their duties. Edgar Quinet meanwhile remained in the Mediterranean during the Greco-Turkish War, and during the Great Fire of Smyrna, at the climax of the conflict, she rescued 1,200 people from the city.|$|E
5|$|Archer {{requests}} {{the coordinates}} of Xindus, the Xindi homeworld, from Kessick. But the alien refuses to help unless Archer helps him escape. Archer declines, {{but he soon}} learns that the foreman had ulterior motives, since he has ordered three warships to overpower Enterprise and enslave his crew. Kessick claims {{to know how to}} escape the mine, but asks for Archer's help in return for guiding the Starfleet officers. Archer reluctantly agrees, and Kessick leads him and Tucker through the mine's sewage removal system. However, the group is soon detected in a conduit, and the foreman floods the system with plasma in an effort to kill them. They narrowly escape being killed, <b>but</b> <b>quickly</b> {{fall into the hands of}} the mine's security forces.|$|E
5|$|Born in Swetes, Antigua, Ambrose came to cricket at a {{relatively}} late age, having preferred basketball in his youth, <b>but</b> <b>quickly</b> made an impression as a fast bowler. Progressing through regional and national teams, he was first chosen for the West Indies in 1988. He was almost immediately successful and remained in the team {{until his retirement in}} 2000. On many occasions, his bowling was responsible for the West Indies winning matches which seemed lost, particularly in association with Courtney Walsh. Against Australia in 1993, he took seven wickets while conceding a single run; in 1994 he was largely responsible for bowling England out for 46 runs, taking six for 24 (six wickets for 24 runs).|$|E
