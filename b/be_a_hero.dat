5|$|According {{to local}} legend Marko's mother was Evrosiya (Евросия), {{sister of the}} Bulgarian voivoda Momchil (who ruled {{territory}} in the Rhodope Mountains). At Marko's birth three narecnitsi (fairy sorceresses) appeared, predicting that he would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>hero</b> and replace his father (King Vukašin). When the king heard this, he threw his son into the river in a basket {{to get rid of}} him. A samodiva named Vila found Marko and brought him up, becoming his foster mother. Because Marko drank the samodivas milk, he acquired supernatural powers and became a Bulgarian freedom fighter against the Turks. He has a winged horse named Sharkolia ("dappled") and a stepsister, the samodiva Gyura. Bulgarian legends incorporate fragments of pagan mythology and beliefs, although the Marko epic was created as late as the 14–18th centuries. Among Bulgarian epic songs, songs about Krali Marko are common and pivotal.|$|E
5|$|Nine {{months after}} Percy Jackson's defense of Mount Olympus in The Last Olympian, Percy finds himself alone {{and on the}} run from monsters in {{southern}} California without his memories. Under the initial guidance of Lupa, the wolf-goddess and protector of ancient Rome, he makes his way toward Camp Jupiter, the Roman demigod training camp and counterpart to the Greek demigod's Camp Half-Blood. Upon arriving, he is again attacked by several Gorgons, (Stheno and Euryale) and successfully defends a disguised goddess Juno as well as the camp {{with the help of the}} guards on duty. Because he protected her during the attack, Juno announces his arrival with her approval, identifying that Percy is a son of Neptune. She further tells him privately that he can only regain his memory by learning to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>hero</b> again and successfully survive the challenges he encounters at camp.|$|E
5|$|He never {{attended}} {{school and was}} illiterate for some years of his early life. He learned {{to read and write}} reportedly out of curiosity after reading and hearing comic books and stories of Kalimán and Porfirio Cadena, El Ojo del Vidrio on the local radio station. In his autobiography, Moreno González said that as a child he believed he had the superhuman ability of speaking telepathically with animals like Kalimán did in the comics. He said he wanted to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>hero</b> like the comic characters. As a child, he was accustomed to seeing gunmen near his home, and played las guerritas ("war games") for fun. While playing the game, he often pretended to be dead, only to say later on that he had been wounded in the game but that he had managed to survive. At the age of twelve, he moved to Apatzingán and made a living by selling matches, peeling onions, working at a melon field, and throwing out the trash from several booths at a marketplace. As a teenager in the late 1980s, Moreno González migrated illegally to the United States, settling in California, where he eventually began selling marijuana. After some years, he moved to Texas and in 1994 was arrested for drug trafficking charges in McAllen. Nearly a decade later in 2003, the U.S. government charged him with conspiracy to distribute five tons of narcotics and issued an arrest warrant. Moreno González then fled back to Mexico.|$|E

When the two arrive at the Rodriguez residence to see José's ill father, the doctor's suspicions are confirmed to everyone there and reveals that the cure to the Monster Flu can be created by a witch that resides {{at the top of}} Horned-Owl Mountain.

Upset over Peter's constant excuses and not wanting to lose the best friend she ever had, Mary Jane suggests they take a break from their relationship ("I Just Can't Walk Away (Say It Now)"). Hurt, Peter decides not to resume his heroic acts as Spider-Man and gives his costume to J. Jonah Jameson, telling him that Spider-Man has quit. He later takes Mary Jane to a night club and impulsively proposes to her. While there, the Green Goblin intercepts the city's TV signals and sends a message to Spider-Man threatening his loved ones.

25|$|Frik du Preez is {{probably}} the greatest Northerns hero of all heroes. The Springbok lock and flank {{was not only a}} dazzling player on the field, but was equally popular off the field. Together with his close friend, Mof Myburgh, both played a total of 109 matches for the Northern Transvaal. Du Preez and Myburgh were inseparable, and Myburgh also proved to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>hero</b> of note. Despite being rather short for a lock, Du Preez's line-out work was practically unequalled and his powerful sprints struck fear in the hearts of his opposition, while he also kicked for posts for the Springboks and Northern Transvaal and put away some magnificent drop goals. How popular he was, even outside Pretoria, is apparent from {{the fact that he was}} carried, shoulder high, off the field after his last game at Newlands in Cape Town in a match that Northerns won by 25-14. Frik retired at the end of the 1971 season. Du Preez was nominated by the magazine SA Rugby as the South African player of the century, and was the first South African to be honoured, along with Dr Danie Craven, in the International Hall of Fame in Auckland, New Zealand.|$|E

500|$|In {{the early}} drafts of the script, there were [...] "so many copies of people {{running around the}} place" [...] which made the story too confusing, so Graham and the {{production}} crew worked {{to make it more}} rational. The episode also contains a subplot in which Rory helps and protects Jennifer as she is scared and affected by the Gangers, which proved a twist in Amy and Rory's relationship. Karen Gillan enjoyed the twist. Amy had previously always had Rory [...] "in the palm of her hand" [...] and a different side of the character was shown as she experienced the same emotions Rory felt when she seemed interested in the Doctor. Arthur Darvill also thought it gave Rory a chance to [...] "man up" [...] and <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>hero</b> by protecting someone.|$|E
500|$|... "Deep Space Homer" [...] {{was written}} by then-executive {{producer}} David Mirkin. Mirkin had worked on {{the idea for the}} episode for a long time, basing the story on NASA's Teacher in Space Project to send ordinary civilians into space in order to spark interest amongst the general public. There was some controversy amongst the show's writing staff during production. Some of the writers felt that having Homer go into space was too large an idea. Matt Groening felt that the idea was so big that it gave the writers [...] "nowhere to go". Several silly gags were therefore toned down to make the episode feel more realistic, including an idea that everyone at NASA was as stupid as Homer. The writers focused more upon the relationship between Homer and his family and Homer's attempts to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>hero.</b>|$|E
