5000|$|One {{tradition}} of the Tour Down Under is that the fans choose an unknown rider and treat him the way they would a star, by mobbing him at hotels and painting {{his name on the}} road. The rider must be a non-English speaking domestique who most likely will not get a start at a major race and will simply act as a <b>bottle</b> <b>carrier.</b> For 2012, [...] rider Mol was chosen.|$|E
5000|$|The British {{were the}} first European army to replace leather belts and pouches with webbing, a strong {{material}} made from woven cotton, which had been pioneered in the United States by the Mills Equipment Company. The 1908 Pattern Webbing equipment comprised a wide belt, left and right ammunition pouches which held 75 rounds each, left and right braces, a bayonet [...] and attachment for the entrenching tool handle, an entrenching tool head in web cover, water <b>bottle</b> <b>carrier,</b> small haversack and large pack. A mess tin was worn attached {{to one of the}} packs, and was contained inside a cloth buff-coloured khaki cover. Inside the haversack were personal items, knife and when on Active Service, unused portions of the daily ration. The large pack could sometimes be used to house some of these items, but was normally kept for carrying the soldier's Greatcoat and or a blanket. The full set of 1908 webbing could weigh over [...]|$|E
50|$|The brewery {{offers an}} {{uncommon}} recycling program through which usable <b>bottle</b> <b>carriers</b> may be redeemed for promotional merchandise. 200,000 <b>bottle</b> <b>carriers</b> can be redeemed for the official St. Arnold's 1957 Bentley.|$|R
50|$|In times gone by, objects hand-woven from dried grasses, for {{household}} use {{were used in}} every home. Rush matting and other objects were necessary for every day living. Nowadays, it is the older people who still have the skills to hand weave such items. Baskets, mats, fans, <b>bottle</b> <b>carriers,</b> etc. were all simply essential utensils for everyday life, while now they are also sold as decorative items or souvenirs to visitors. There was also local pottery and tile production at one time, which has disappeared with modern times. However, hand-made embroidery and also crochet work is experiencing somewhat of a revival.|$|R

40|$|On site {{measurements}} of pH, conductivity and temperature for thirteen {{sites in the}} Humber catchment and three sites in the Tweed catchment within the period 1994 to 1997 {{as part of the}} Land Ocean Interaction Study project (LOIS). Sites were sampled at regular weekly intervals and more intermittently during high flows (on average an extra sampling once a month per site). Samples were obtained using a wide neck PTFE bottle in a plastic covered <b>bottle</b> <b>carrier</b> (lowered from bridges where possible otherwise collected by immersing sample bottle by hand in the water as near the main flow as possible). pH and conductivity reading were taken using Mettler Toledo Check Mate meters and probes. Temperature readings were obtained using a PT 100 probe with a Digitron 3204 Pt meter (RS components). The measurements were carried out by members of the field sampling team at York University, as part of the Land Ocean Interaction Study (LOIS) ...|$|E
40|$|Discrete {{data for}} major ions and {{nutrients}} in river water for 13 {{sites in the}} Humber catchment over the periods 1993 to 1997 and 1996 to 1997 and for 3 sites from the Tweed catchment over the period 1994 to 1997. Ions and nutrients measured were: Ammonia, Calcium (dissolved), Magnesium (dissolved), Potassium (dissolved), Sodium (dissolved), Bromide-ion, Carbon (organic dissolved), Chloride-ion, Nitrate, Nitrite, Phosphorus (soluble reactive), Phosphorus (total dissolved), Silicate (reactive dissolved), Sulphate, Carbon (organic particulate), Nitrogen (particulate), Phosphorus (total). Sites were sampled at regular weekly intervals and more intermittently during high flows (on average an extra sampling once a month per site). Samples were obtained using a wide neck PTFE bottle in a plastic covered <b>bottle</b> <b>carrier</b> (lowered from bridges where possible otherwise collected by immersing sample bottle by hand in the water as near the main flow as possible). Samples were filtered through Whatman 0. 45 um sterile membrane filters immediately on return to laboratory. Samples stored in sterilin tubes in the dark at 40 C and analysed by Dionex DX 100 ion chromatography system. Silicate reactive dissolved and Chloride-ion concentrations were determined by automated colourimetry and dissolved organic carbon concentrations were determined using a TOCsin II aqueous carbon analyser. Some samples on the River Aire were collected using EPIC automatic samplers. The analysis {{was carried out by}} members of the analytical chemistry section at York University (from April 1994 until November 1996) and at Wallingford Institute of Hydrology (September 1993 to April 1994 and December 1996 to April 1997), as part of the Land Ocean Interaction Study (LOIS) ...|$|E

40|$|Concentration {{increases}} in the isotopic germanium carrier solutions via evaporation would produce weight losses in the carrier solutions. Since the <b>bottle</b> containing each <b>carrier</b> is usually weighed {{before and after the}} removal of carrier for a given run, the possibility exists of finding evidence for increasing carrier concentration in this record. With few exceptions the weighings were performed on the same top-loading balance in the external chemistry lab. The primary purpose was to monitor carrier usage, not to look for evidence for increasing carrier concentration. However, in order to look for this evidence, it is necessary only to compare the weights of the closed bottles between the times of carrier removal. This comparison has been performed and is reported here. Bear in mind that {{there is some evidence that}} the <b>bottle</b> containing <b>carrier</b> was not always weighted in the same way (e. g. perhaps a plastic bag was not removed from the bottle or the bottle cap was removed before weighing). Another possible source of weighing errors is the occasional buildup of static charges, especially on dry winter days. Such problems of static electricity were easily recognized and overcome. For the most part, the resulting record agrees with the assumption that the weighings were performed consistently. Carrier solution data were analyzed and a correction factor was calculated...|$|R

40|$|A {{study was}} made {{to find out the}} effect of reduced {{humidity}} and antitranspirants on in vitro hardening and ex vitro survival of micropropagated Citrus plantlets. Relative humidity inside the culture vessel was reduced with silica gel and antitranspirants used were Alar and 8 -hydroxyquinoline (8 HQ). Results indicated that plants under silica gel treatment exhibited reduced shoot growth in vitro and lower ex vitro survival. 8 HQ (2 mg/l) was found effective in controlling excessive water loss which helped in more ex vitro survival as compared to control. Key words: Antitranspirants, micropropagation, Citrus, acclimatization (CLM) were aseptically cultured in tissue culture bottle (450 ml capacity) with soilrite as a <b>carrier.</b> <b>Bottles</b> were filled upto one third with soilrite and one fourth strength MS salt solution were added depending on its capacity of absorption before autoclaving at 15 lb for 20 min.
