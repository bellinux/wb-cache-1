It only took 16 seconds from his substitution to his goal, a World Cup record that still stands. Following his break through on the international stage, he was named Danish Player of the Year.

5000|$|Some {{directors}} explicitly {{dislike the}} phrase [...] "director's cut" [...] because {{it implies that}} they disapprove of the theatrically released cut.

50|$|Bajrami transitioned from {{full contact}} karate to kickboxing {{under the tutelage}} of fellow karateka-turned-kickboxers Andy Hug and Michael Thompson, and amassed an undefeated record {{fighting}} domestically before being recruited by the world's premier kickboxing promotion, K-1 in 1998. In his promotional debut, Bajrami entered into a one night, eight-man tournament held on May 6, 1998 at K-1 Fight Night '98 in Zurich. He needed an extension round to get past Matteo Minonzie in the quarter-finals, and was then eliminated from the tournament in the semis when his bout with Rob van Esdonk was stopped by the doctor in the first round. The stoppage was controversial as Bajrami claimed to have been hit by an illegal elbow from van Esdonk and refused to return to his feet, prompting the doctor to deem him unable to fight. He was <b>back</b> <b>in</b> action <b>just</b> over <b>a</b> month later when he fought to a five-round draw with Kirkwood Walker at K-1 Dream '98 in Nagoya, Japan on July 17, 1998.|$|R

Desperately in love, George wishes things were different: that he had met Jane before she married Doug, making her not so jaded. After a car accident, George finds himself exactly ten years <b>back</b> <b>in</b> time, <b>just</b> <b>a</b> few days before Doug and Jane’s wedding.

George also gets revenge on a guy at work who took (his colleague) Harvey's plans and caused him not to get the promotion he'd been wanting. Jane's friend, Mary Brown, knows all about Doug cheating on Jane, but she can't bring herself to tell Jane. She and George {{talk about it and}} plan to get Jane to find out about Doug and the wedding coordinator. Mary wants Jane to go with George, since she despises Doug for cheating on her best friend.

They get into a minor crash and George wakes up ten years into the future, from where he is. He and Jane are married and are celebrating their 10th anniversary with a renewal of their vows.

40|$|Humans can {{synchronise}} movements with auditory beats or rhythms without apparent effort. This {{ability to}} entrain {{to the beat}} is considered automatic, such that any perturbations are corrected for, even if the perturbation was not consciously noted. Temporal correction of upper limb (e. g. finger tapping) and lower limb (e. g. stepping) movements to a phase perturbed auditory beat usually results <b>in</b> individuals being <b>back</b> <b>in</b> phase after <b>just</b> <b>a</b> few beats. When a metronome is presented {{in more than one}} sensory modality, a multisensory advantage is observed, with reduced temporal variability in finger tapping movements compared to unimodal conditions. Here, we investigate synchronisation of lower limb movements (stepping in place) to auditory, visual and combined auditory-visual metronome cues. In addition, we compare movement corrections to phase advance and phase delay perturbations in the metronome for the three sensory modality conditions. We hypothesised that, as with upper limb movements, there would be a multisensory advantage, with stepping variability being lowest in the bimodal condition. As such, we further expected correction to the phase perturbation to be quickest in the bimodal condition. Our results revealed lower variability in the asynchronies between foot strikes and the metronome beats in the bimodal condition, compared to unimodal conditions. However, while participants corrected substantially quicker to perturbations in auditory compared to visual metronomes, there was no multisensory advantage in the phase correction task – correction under the bimodal condition was almost identical to the auditory-only condition. On the whole, we noted that corrections in the stepping task were smaller than those previously reported for finger tapping studies. We conclude that temporal corrections are not only affected by the reliability of the sensory information, but also the complexity of the movement itself...|$|R
