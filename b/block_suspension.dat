40|$|Background and {{objective}} Residual carcinoma cells {{play an important}} role in the result of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of pulmonary malignancies, and Platinum-based adjuvant chemotherapy is one of the important treatment regimen to reduce residual carcinoma cells after RFA. ERCC 1 (excision repair cross-complementation group 1) is an important factor affecting Platinum-based chemotherapy effects. Residual carcinoma cells exhibit some changes of their features after RFA; however, there is no report about the change of their ERCC 1 expression by now. This study focused on the change of ERCC 1 expression in residual VX 2 squamous carcinoma cells in rabbit lung after RFA. Methods The model of VX 2 squamous carcinoma in rabbit lung was established by injection of tissue <b>block</b> <b>suspension.</b> Fifty-eight New Zealand White rabbits with VX 2 squamous carcinoma were randomly devided into the control group (n= 10) and the RFA group (n= 48). During the RFA procedure in these models, residual carcinoma cells were achieved by controlling the range of electrode expanding, power output and treatment time. At different points of time, the positive rates of ERCC 1 expression in residual carcinoma were detected by immunohistochemistry. Results Comparing with the control group, the positive rate of ERCC 1 expression in residual carcinoma in RFA group increases transiently within 1 d to 5 d (53. 7 %± 1. 6 % & 32. 9 %± 2. 5 %), and 5 d later, it decline to the level of the control group. Conclusion The ERCC 1 expression of residual pulmonary carcinoma increase within 5 d after RFA. Thus platinum-based adjuvant chemotherapy may be ineffective in this period...|$|E

In the first part the flow of emulsions in smooth contracting cylindrical microchannels is investigated. It is received that a significant role at dynamic blocking of channels is played by the inclusions comparable by size to the diameter of a narrowing. This is {{in spite of the fact}} that their influence on the change of a flow rate of emulsion before blocking is insignificant. In the second part the generation of emulsion in a complex structure of microchannels (micromodels) when water is displaced by composition of hydrocarbon with surfactants is investigated.

On this basis, percolation rules and <b>blocking</b> characteristics of <b>suspension</b> in heterogeneous reservoir were investigated. It is showed that suspension injection could remarkably reduce the permeable ratio and improve the heterogeneity significantly. Low-speed and low-viscosity injection could achieve shallow profile control, and high-speed and high-viscosity injection could achieve deep profile control. Adjusting the injection rate or viscosity of carrying fluid slug {{at the right time}} to make the particle retention concentration profile in thief zones and the water-flood front keep consistent could achieve dynamic profile control. For the reservoirs without a good interlayer, the optimum injection rate and viscosity of carrying fluid were chosen based on the connectivity of layers, and in the reservoirs with good interlayers the injection rate and viscosity should be lowered appropriately under the field permitting conditions. When the suspension concentration was constant, the instantaneous fractional flow of high permeable layer first decreased sharply and then ramped up with the increasing injection volume. Initial percolation coefficient is the basis of a high utilization of suspension and a good result in profile control.

By grafting withdrawn rats either with immature hippocampal <b>blocks</b> or with <b>suspensions</b> of cultured astrocytes, we hoped to arrest the process of cell loss or even reverse it, because it is known that grafted material might display trophic and eventually protective effects in conditions of brain damage. The dentate granule and hippocampal CA 3 pyramidal cells were counted both in the grafted hemisphere and in the contralateral one. Grafts of astrocyte suspensions did not interfere with the ongoing process of cell death in withdrawn rats. Conversely, grafts of hippocampal tissue impeded the degeneration observed in the granule and pyramidal cells of the grafted hemisphere, although in the contralateral one the cell loss persisted. We therefore conclude that the protective effect displayed by solid grafts might be a local process dependent on the release of diffusible trophic agents. We cannot explain the absence of any effect displayed by astroglial grafts, inasmuch as in different experimental situations such an effect was described...|$|R

40|$|Aluminium {{die-casting}} {{is widely}} used in the automotive industry. Brackets, engine <b>blocks,</b> wheels and <b>suspension</b> arms etc. are typical applications. Due to the gases contained in the melt, more or less spherical pores arise in the cast components during the cooling procedure, usually with a higher concentration in the middle. The distribution of the pores depends both on the casting condition and on {{the form of the}} components and is stochastic. In the past, the simple way is often chosen for the fatigue life estimation of aluminium die-casting: The fatigue strengths of the material, e. g. in the form of S-N curves, are determined by an unnotched specimen which are then used in the fatigue calculation. However, the application of these data to real components with notches leads in many cases to fatigue life estimations which are by far too conservative. In the present paper a simple geometrical model of pores is presented. Using this model, the notch stress caused by a pore can be estimated. The behaviour of pores in a real component with notches will be treated. It will be shown that the mentioned conservative nature of the fatigue life prediction and the apparent notch insensitivity of aluminium die-casting {{can be explained by the}} facts that the stress distribution in a real component, contrary to an unnotched specimen, is inhomogeneous and that the porosity density on the surface is often low...|$|R

Recently, it has been maintained that chronic H. pylori infections in adults are linked to a higher risk of coronary heart diseases. In this respect, the acute toxic effects of the H. pylori lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on embryonal cardiomyocytes at different developmental stages was evaluated. White Leghorn chick embryos and smooth (S) [...] form NCTC 11637 strain H. pylori organisms were used. Both whole heath-killed H. pylori suspensions (3. 10 (6) bacteria/egg) and isolated S-LPS (500 ng/egg) or S-Lipid A (500 ng/egg) were non-lethal to 4 -day embryos, becoming moderately lethal (5 % to 30 %) to 6 - and 8 -day embryos and highly lethal (> 90 %) to 10 - to 17 -day embryos. The contractile activity of isolated atrial fragments from 10 -day embryos was completely inhibited, within 5 min, following treatments with heath-killed H. pylori (3 x 10 (6) /ml), or S-LPS (500 ng/ml), or S-Lipid A (500 ng/ml); the block determined by S-LPS and S-Lipid A was irreversible, while the <b>block</b> by bacterial <b>suspensions</b> was completely reversible upon withdrawal. Following a 24 -hour treatment with S-LPS or S-Lipid A of single-cell cultures of cardiomyocytes (isolated from 10 -day embryos) a dose-dependent cell loss was observed, as assessed by total protein dosage and direct counting of adherent cells. Propidium Iodide/Annexin V FACS-analysis confirmed the occurrence of cellular necrosis, but did not show any evidence of apoptotic processes. The release of superoxide anion radicals by cultured cardiomyocytes was as follows: S-Lipid A (25 micrograms/ml) > S-LPS (25 micrograms/ml) > heath killed H. pylori suspensions (3 x 10 (6) /ml); control cultures did not release detectable amounts of superoxide anion radicals. Furthermore, cultured cardiomyocytes produced increased amounts of NO (N-monomethylarginine-inhibitable) following stimulation with S-LPS (25 micrograms/ml) or S-Lipid A (25 micrograms/ml) (but not heath killed H. pylori 3 x 10 (6) /ml suspensions). Under all the above experimental conditions S-polysaccharide proved to be non-toxic. Concluding, H. pylori LPS is relatively non-toxic to the less differentiated cardiomyocytes; cardiomyocytes which are more advanced in their biochemical differentiation become highly sensitive to LPS and produce ROS and NO. ROS are probably responsible for the early toxic actions, while both ROS and NO are likely {{to be involved in the}} later degenerative/necrotic effects...|$|R
5000|$|The {{export of}} coal {{had become the}} railway's main business, but the staiths at Stockton had {{inadequate}} storage {{and the size of}} ships was limited by the depth of the Tees. A branch from Stockton to Haverton, on the north bank of the Tees, was proposed in 1826, and the engineer Thomas Storey proposed a shorter and cheaper line to Middlesbrough, south of the Tees in July 1827. Later approved by George Stephenson, this plan was ratified by the shareholders on 26 October. The Tees Navigation Company was about to improve the river and proposed that the railway delay application to Parliament, but, despite opposition, at a meeting in January 1828 it was decided to proceed. A more direct northerly route from Auckland to the Tees had been considered since 1819, and the Tees & Weardale Railway had applied unsuccessfully to Parliament for permission for such a line in 1823, 1824 and 1825. This now became a 11+1/2 mi line linking Simpasture on the S&DR's line near today's Newton Aycliffe station with Haverton and Stockton, via a route that was 6 mi shorter than via the route of the S&DR, and named the Clarence Railway in honour of the Duke of Clarence, later King William IV. Meetings held in Stockton in early 1828 supported the Tees Navigation and the Clarence Railway, but the S&DR received permission for its branch on 23 May 1828 after promising to complete the Hagger Leases Branch and to build a bridge across the Tees at least 72 ft wide and 19 ft above low water, so as not to affect shipping. Two members of the management committee resigned, as they felt that Stockton would be adversely affected by the line, and Meynell, the S&DR chairman, stepped down from leadership. The Clarence Railway was approved a few days later, with the same gauge as the S&DR. The route of the Clarence Railway was afterwards amended to reach Samphire Batts, later known as Port Clarence, and traffic started in August 1833; by the middle of 1834 Port Clarence had opened and 28 mi of line was in use. The S&DR charged the d per ton per mile landsale rate for coal it carried the 10 mi from the collieries to Simpasture for forwarding to Port Clarence, rather than the lower shipping rate. By July 1834, the Exchequer Loan Commissioners had taken control of the Clarence Railway.The Croft branch opened in October 1829. Construction of the suspension bridge across the Tees started in July 1829, but was suspended in October after the Tees Navigation Company pointed out the S&DR had no permission to cross the Old Channel of the Tees.

40|$|For {{the past}} several decades there have been many {{attempts}} to improve suspension performance due to its importance within vehicle dynamics. The suspension system main functions are to connect the chassis to the ground, and to isolate the chassis from the ground. To improve upon these two functions, large amounts of effort are focused on two elements that form the building <b>blocks</b> of the <b>suspension</b> system, stiffness and damping. With the advent of new technologies, such as variable dampers, and powerful microprocessors and sensors, suspension performance can be enhanced beyond the traditional capabilities of a passive suspension system. Recently, Yin et al. [1, 2] have developed a novel dual chamber pneumatic spring that can provide tunable stiffness characteristics, which is rare compared to the sea of tunable dampers. The purpose of this thesis is to develop a controller {{to take advantage of the}} novel pneumatic spring’s functionality with a tunable damper to improve vehicle dynamic performance. Since the pneumatic spring is a slow-acting element (i. e. low bandwidth), the typical control logic for semi-active suspension systems are not practical for this framework. Most semi-active controllers assume the use of fast-acting (i. e. high bandwidth) variable dampers within the suspension design. In this case, a lookup table controller is used to manage the stiffness and damping properties for a wide range of operating conditions. To determine the optimum stiffness and damping properties, optimization is employed. Four objective functions are used to quantify vehicle performance; ride comfort, rattle space (i. e. suspension deflection), handling (i. e. tire deflection), and undamped sprung mass natural frequency. The goal is to minimize the first three objectives, while maximizing the latter to avoid motion sickness starting from 1 Hz and downward. However, these goals cannot be attained simultaneously, necessitating compromises between them. Using the optimization strength of genetic algorithms, a Pareto optima set can be generated to determine the compromises between objective functions that have been normalized. Using a trade-off study, the stiffness and damping properties can be selected from the Pareto optima set for suitability within an operating condition of the control logic. When implementing the lookup table controller, a practical method is employed to recognize the road profile as there is no direct method to determine road profile. To determine the road profile for the lookup table controller, the unsprung mass RMS acceleration and suspension state are utilized. To alleviate the inherent flip-flopping drawback of lookup table controllers, a temporal deadband is employed to eliminate the flip-flopping of the lookup table controller. Results from the semi-active suspension with tunable stiffness and damping show that vehicle performance, depending on road roughness and vehicle speed, can improve up to 18 % over passive suspension systems. Since the controller does not constantly adjust the damping properties, cost and reliability may increase over traditional semi-active suspension systems. The flip-flopping drawback of lookup table controllers has been reduced through the use of a temporal deadband, however further enhancement is required to eliminate flip-flopping within the control logic. Looking forward, the novel semi-active suspension has great potential to improve vehicle dynamic performance especially for heavy vehicles that have large sprung mass variation, but to increase robustness the following should be considered: better road profile recognition, the elimination of flip-flopping between suspension states, and using state equations model of the pneumatic spring within the vehicle model for optimization and evaluation...|$|R

Depending on the requirements of sensitivity alone or sensitivity and resonance frequency, Displacement-amplifying Compliant Mechanisms (DaCMs) are designed using the selection map-based technique, which indicates the limits of what is possible for given specifications on size and microfabrication. In order to prove {{the benefits of a}} DaCM, we modified the designs of two very sensitive capacitive micromachined accelerometers from the literature by incorporating DaCMs and showed that, within the same footprint on the chip, the displacement sensitivity could be enhanced by more than 60 % while the resonance frequency was also improved by more than 30 %. As the focus of the thesis is to explore the integration of DaCMs into accelerometers, the analytical, computational, and practical aspects are discussed in detail. Both single and dual axis in-plane accelerometers are considered. The fabrication processes used are Silicon-on-Insulator Multi-user MEMS Processes (SOIMUMPs) and a customized Silicon-on-Insulator (SOI) based process. The fabricated accelerometers are packaged and brought to the product form. They were tested at the die level {{as well as in the}} packaged form. Under dynamic conditions, the measured amplification factor of the fabricated single-axis in-plane accelerometer was observed to be 11. The overall dimension of the accelerometer was 4. 25 mm × 1. 25 mm. The first in-plane natural frequency of the fabricated accelerometer was found to be 6. 25 kHz. The voltage sensitivity of the packaged accelerometer with the DaCM measured 26. 7 mV/g at 40 Hz with differential capacitance sensitivity of 3926 ppm/g around the base capacitance of 0. 75 pF. The fabricated dual-axis accelerometer has a special configuration of twelve folded-beam <b>suspension</b> <b>blocks</b> that de-couple any displacements along the two in-plane orthogonal axes. The decoupling feature is retained even after adding the DaCMs along both the axes. The total device size was 8. 6 mm × 8. 6 mm. The device was also fabricated and packaged inside a ceramic flat-pin package using hybrid die-to-die wire-bonding. Die-level dynamic characterization showed that the average geometric advantage achieved using the DaCMs is 6. 2 along both the in-plane axes. The measured axial voltage sensitivity of about 580 mV/g for both the axes was achieved with a cross-axial sensitivity of less than 2 % and a natural frequency of 920 Hz. The static capacitance sensitivity was found to be 0. 296 × 106 ppm/g with a base capacitance of 0. 977 pF. Also presented in this work is a wide-band dual-axis accelerometer without an amplifying mechanism. Its first two in-plane modal frequencies measured 14. 2 kHz. The measured sensitivity of the packaged accelerometer along both the axes of the device was found to be 62 mV/g at 200 Hz. Aiming at towards cost-effective accelerometers for small-volume markets, we also developed a single-axis and two dual-axis meso-scale spring-steel in-plane accelerometers equipped with Allegro A 1395 linear Hall-effect sensors for sensing the displacement of the proof-mass. The single-axis in-plane meso-scale accelerometer also contains a DaCM. It is observed through simulation that the single-axis design with a DaCM is 39 % more sensitive and has 41 % more bandwidth compared to a single-axis design without a DaCM. The measured sensitivity of the fabricated single-axis spring-steel accelerometer with a DaCM was found to be 71. 4 mV/g with a minimum resolvable acceleration of 14 milli-g. The unique features of the first generation of dual-axis accelerometers are that a rechargeable Li-ion battery adds to the proof-mass. It also contains a de-coupling mechanism that can decompose any planar acceleration into its axial components. The second generation of dual-axis accelerometers is more compact in size. All the mechanical elements of the accelerometers are made of EN J 42 /AISI 1080 spring steel foil machined using Wire-cut Electro-Discharge- Machining. The measured sensitivity of the first generation of dual-axis meso-scale accelerometers is 78 and 108 mV/g along the X and Y axes whereas the second generation device exhibits a sensitivity of 40 mV/g for both the axes. The thesis concludes that the sensitivity of a displacement-based sensor can be improved using a suitably designed DaCM without compromising the resonance frequency and hence the bandwidth. Furthermore, the work describing the development of meso-scale accelerometers also establishes spring steel as a viable material for meso-scale applications...|$|R
