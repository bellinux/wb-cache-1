40|$|Fish {{produce a}} variety of wastes {{including}} solids, ammonia, {{carbon dioxide and other}} materials. These wastes must be removed from the culture water or they become toxic to the fish. Many methods have been developed to remove the wastes fish produce. However, in this paper we will concentrate on removal of ammonia and nitrite, both of which are highly toxic to fish and other aquatic organisms. In fresh water systems there are two common methods used to remove ammonia: ion exchange and <b>biological</b> <b>filters.</b> In brackish or salt water systems ion exchange is not a viable alternative because salt in the culture water quickly (usually in a matter of minutes) saturates all of the adsorption sites on the ion exchange media. Thus, <b>biological</b> <b>filters</b> are the only widely used method of removing ammonia and nitrite from all types of aquacultural systems. <b>Biological</b> <b>filters</b> consist of some solid media that serves as a surface on which bacteria can attach and live. Water containing ammonia and/or nitirite flow over this media (and the bacteria attached to it). The bacteria remove the ammonia from the water and use it as an energy source to drive their life processes. These bacterial excrete nitrite, require oxygen and produce carbon dioxide as byproducts of their respiration. A different group of bacteri...|$|R
40|$|Abstract] This study {{aimed to}} monitor and {{characterize}} bacterial populations of two <b>biological</b> air <b>filters</b> during their start up phase (four months). The main objective of this work {{was to assess the}} potentiality of a microbiological approach to better understand the evolution of the bacterial populations within biofilters and therefore help to select biomass carrier media. The two <b>biological</b> <b>filters</b> were operated at full-scale (480 m 3), filled with organic materials and dedicated to the removal of ammonia and Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs). The first step of the work consisted in developing an extraction method for the biomass fixed on the solid supports. The second step investigated biofiltersâ€™ microbial ecology using molecular tools: DAPI (4, 6 -DiAmino- 2 - PhenylIndole), TVC (Total Viable Counts), FISH (Fluorescent In Situ Hybridization) and SSCP (Single Strand Conformation Polymorphism). The findings of the experiments did not show a significant evolution of total bacterial concentrations in biofilms of both <b>biological</b> <b>filters</b> during their start up phase. However, SSCP data analysis underlined important variations in the composition of bacterial populations. Finally, examination of the results highlighted the interest to inoculate organic media {{in order to reduce the}} acclimation time of microbial populations...|$|R
40|$|International audienceA novel {{heterogeneous}} respirometer for in situ {{assessment of}} the biological activity and mass transport phenomena of biofilm developed on packing materials of gas-phase <b>biological</b> <b>filters</b> is presented. The flexible respirometer configuration allows reproducing the operational features of biofilters and biotrickling filters to obtain reliable diagnoses of the bioreactor performance. A batch-operating mode was chosen for the biological assessment in which dynamic concentrations of oxygen, pollutant, and carbon dioxide were online recorded and used to calibrate a mathematical model that considers the principal phenomena occurring in the respirometer. The maximum elimination capacity of two different packing materials colonized by sulfide-oxidizing bacteria and toluene-oxidizing fungal populations was estimated and compared with previously reported values. Additionally the rate controlling phenomena were analyzed using the biofilm effectiveness factor. The experimental system can be easily applied to pilot- and industrial-scale gas-phase <b>biological</b> <b>filters</b> when the kinetic expression of pollutant degradation is available...|$|R
50|$|Live rock {{is highly}} valued in the {{aquarium}} trade. It introduces a {{diverse array of}} bacteria, algae, and invertebrates to the closed marine environment and functions as a superior <b>biological</b> <b>filter</b> that hosts aerobic and anaerobic nitrifying bacteria required for the nitrogen cycle that processes waste. Live rock becomes the main biological nitrification base or <b>biological</b> <b>filter</b> of a saltwater aquarium. Additionally, live rocks have a stabilizing effect on the water chemistry, in particular on helping to maintain constant pH by release of calcium carbonate. Lastly, live rock, especially when encrusted with multiple colors of coralline algae, becomes a major decorative element of the aquarium and provides shelter for the inhabitants. It {{is often used to}} build caves, arches, overhangs, or other structures in the tank, a practice known as aquascaping.|$|E

In addition to the standard physical and chemical analytical techniques, the biological growth potential technique, the lC method of determining primary productivity and biomass determination by way of the chlorophyll a method, were also used. The most important findings were: 1. that the activated sludge process purifies the water more effectively than the <b>biological</b> <b>filtering</b> process; 2. that no seasonal fluctuations affecting the effectiveness of the purifying systems were found, and 3. that the biological growth potential of the effluent in the Jukskei River was such that it could still cause algal growth.

40|$|An {{interesting}} alternative {{introduced in}} some treatment plants consists of using GAC filtration without regeneration, taking {{benefit of the}} activity of microbial communities colonizing the GAC particle (AWWA, 1981; Bablon et al. 1986). In fact, this biological filtration {{has the advantage of}} specifically removing biodegradable compounds - the most undesirable fraction of DOC - in order to avoid bacterial regrowth in distribution networks. In order to improve the understanding of the processes involved in biological filtration and to derive guidelines for a rational management of these filters, extensive studies were conducted in the three plants of the Syndicat des Eaux d'Ile de France, located in the Parisian suburbs (Choisy-le-Roi, Mery-sur-Oise, Neuilly-sur-Marne).

25|$|Hobbyist aquaria {{often do}} not have {{sufficient}} bacteria populations to adequately denitrify waste.

The benefit of using live rock is fourfold: First, live rock acts as a <b>biological</b> <b>filter,</b> adding beneficial bacteria.

Thirdly, it provides a natural reef appearance with ample places to locate corals. Lastly, live rock will also help balance and stabilize pH in the aquarium.|$|E

50|$|NSPs {{rely on a}} {{combination}} of hydraulic design techniques in conjunction with a finefilter. Materials such as leaves, pollen, dust or suntan lotion commonly found floating on the water's surface are removed by a specialized skimmer or overflow channel. These specially designed devices allow optimal skimming of the water surface and reduce silting. Downstream, a bioreactive <b>biological</b> <b>filter</b> removes and retains additional particulate matter down to a particle size of 100 micrometres. Pumps different from those found in conventional pools hydraulically optimize water flow rates and volumes, thereby accelerating the cleaning process even further. This mechanically enhanced natural filtration produces clear, clean water.
