The European colonials wore European fashion straight out of the Netherlands, or even Paris, while the natives wore their traditional clothings that are distinct in every regions. As the years progressed and the Dutch influence became stronger, many natives began mixing European styles within their traditional clothing. High-ranking natives within the colony as well as nobility, would wear European style suits with their batik sarongs for special occasions and even for everyday use. More and more native Indonesians began to dress more European. This of course came with the idea that those who wore European clothing were more progressive and open towards a European society and the etiquette that came with it. More and more the European influence was gaining precedence within native Indonesians. This probably {{stems from the fact that}} many natives were treated <b>better</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> wore European clothing. Their European counterparts acknowledged them, and that in turn was most likely a catalyst for adoption western clothing into traditional Indonesian clothing.|$|E
25|$|With this {{domestic}} {{record of}} captaincy success, Deane was picked as captain for the South Africa side for the 1927–28 English tour of South Africa, ahead of Herbie Taylor who {{had led the}} 1924 tour of England, but whose form had reportedly suffered in the big matches from {{the pressures of the}} captaincy. Poor batting led to defeat in the first match of the series and in the second the South Africans had a first-innings lead of 117, with Deane contributing 41 to a total of 250, but still lost the match by 87 runs. The turnaround in the series started with third Test, which was drawn with the South Africans finally posting a respectable total. Deane was instrumental in this: in the first innings, with the score at 146 for seven, he and Buster Nupen both made scores of more than 50, with Deane going on to 77. In the second innings, an all-round better batting performance by the South Africans secured the draw with Deane making a further 73. A new fast-medium bowling combination allied to less brittle batting brought a South African victory in the fourth Test, with Deane batting when victory by four wickets was achieved. And the series was tied at two wins apiece with a South African victory in the final match by eight wickets. As captain, Deane won the toss five times out of five in the series; unusually for the time in which he played, he put the England team in to bat three times, claiming that his young side would play <b>better</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> knew the odds they had to face.|$|E

2500|$|While most wines {{can benefit}} from lying on their side, Champagne and other {{sparkling}} wines tend to age <b>better</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> are kept upright. This is because the internal pressure caused by the trapped carbonic gas provides enough humidity and protection from oxygen. Caterer Magazine claims that the preference for upright storage of Champagne is shared by the Comité Interprofessionnel du Vin de Champagne (CIVC) who conducted an extensive study of Champagnes that were stored in various conditions and orientations. This study found that Champagne stored on its side aged more quickly because oxygen was allowed to seep in after the Champagne corks lost their elasticity due to contact with the wine.

2500|$|The Gemara helped {{explain why}} (as [...] reports) God chose a rainbow as {{the symbol of}} God's promise.

2500|$|The {{emphasis}} on thinness and on an ideal female body shape and size is psychologically {{detrimental to}} the well-being of many young women. Many have thus resorted to grooming, dieting, and surgical pursuits, in order to be happy. Global eating disorder rates such as, anorexia and bulimia are gradually rising in adolescent girls. The National Eating Disorders Association, reported that 95% of individuals aged 12 to 26 currently suffer from an eating disorder, and anorexia is the third most common illness amongst teenagers. Based on another study by Dove, 87% of individuals with low body-esteems often avoid eating, and would rather place their health at risk for the sick of beauty. With the habitual use of social media, teenage girls in particular, are most prone “to internalize negative messages and obsess about weight loss to obtain a thin appearance”. As a result, pressures from social media doubles for adolescent girls between the ages of 13 to 18 years old, {{and more than half of}} have already reported the need to diet. The pressure on females “to cope with the effects of culturally induced body insecurity” is therefore severe, with many others previously citing that “their lives would be <b>better</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> were not judged by their looks and body shape, [...] this is leading to low self-esteem, eating disorders, mental health problems and depression”.|$|E

On 8 August 1944, Slim was promoted to lieutenant general, and, on 28 September 1944, he was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath (KCB). In December 1944, during a ceremony at Imphal in front of the Scottish, Gurkha and Punjabi regiments, Slim and three of his corps commanders (Christison, Scoones and Stopford) were knighted by the viceroy Lord Wavell and invested with honours. [...] Slim was presented with his insignia as KCB, and the others with their KBEs. Slim was also mentioned in despatches. By the end of 1944, the majority of the men serving in the British 14th Army were in fact not British as of the 12 divisions that made up the 14th Army, 2 were British, 7 were Indian and 3 came from Britain's African colonies. In addition, there were 6 Chinese divisions, 2 regiments from the U.S Army and various tribal militias made up of Shan, Chin, Naga, Kachin and Karen peoples raised by the OSS and the SOE fighting on the Allied side in Burma, requiring Slim to play the role of the diplomat as much as a general to hold these disparate forces made up of so many different peoples together.|$|E

The difference between these two courses is that in the [...] "Special" [...] stream, students take 'Higher Mother Tongue' (available for Standard Mandarin, Malay and Tamil only) instead of 'Mother Tongue'. A pass in the Higher Mother Tongue 'O' Level Examination constitutes the fulfilment of the Mother Tongue requirement in Singapore, whereas Normal Mother Tongue Students will have to go through one more year of study in their Mother Tongue after their 'O' Levels to take the 'A' Level H1 Mother Tongue Examinations and fulfil the MOE's requirement. A foreign language, either French, German, Japanese or Spanish can be taken in addition to the mother tongue or can replace it. This is especially popular with students who are struggling with their mother tongues, expatriates, or students returning from abroad. Non-Chinese students may also study Standard Mandarin and non-Malay students Malay as a third language. This programme is known as CSP (Chinese Special Programme) and MSP (Malay Special Programme). Mother Tongue teachers conduct these lessons in school after usual hours. Students of Higher Mother Tongue languages are allowed to have up to two points taken off their O-level scoring, unless the student's Higher Mother Tongue is used as their L1 in computation of L1R5. a scoring system discussed below where a lower value is considered <b>better,</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> meet set benchmarks.
