5|$|The Ordainers {{once more}} sent Gaveston into exile in 1311, but by 1312 he was <b>back.</b> <b>Now</b> the king's {{favourite}} was officially an outlaw, and Arundel {{was among the}} earls who swore to hunt him down. The leader of the oppositionafter Lincoln's death the year beforewas now Thomas, Earl of Lancaster. In June 1312 Gaveston was captured, tried before Lancaster, Arundel and the earls of Warwick and Hereford, and executed. A reconciliation was achieved between the king and the offending magnates, and Arundel and the others received pardons, but animosity prevailed. In 1314 Arundel was among the magnates who refused to assist Edward in a campaign against the Scots, contributing to the disastrous English defeat at the Battle of Bannockburn.|$|E
25|$|A knot {{in three}} {{dimensions}} can be untied when placed in four-dimensional space. This is done by changing crossings. Suppose one strand is behind another as seen from a chosen point. Lift it into the fourth dimension, {{so there is no}} obstacle (the front strand having no component there); then slide it forward, and drop it <b>back,</b> <b>now</b> in front. Analogies for the plane would be lifting a string up off the surface, or removing a dot from inside a circle.|$|E

The carapace lifts {{off from the}} front, like a helmet, as its surrounding skin ruptures, but it remains attached at the <b>back.</b> <b>Now</b> the spider works its limbs free and typically winds up dangling by a new thread of silk attached to its own exuviae, which in turn hang from the original silk attachment.|$|E

In the interior of the house, the forms of the rooms were simple but combined to make a more complex structure like Breuer and Gropius advocated. The house has four bedrooms and four bathrooms.|$|E
25|$|He {{lived with}} his mother in Mecca for three years until she took him to Yathrib to visit some {{relatives}} (uncles from the mother side), and she died on the way <b>back.</b> <b>Now</b> orphaned, Muhammad, aged 6, was passed into the custody of his grandfather, Abd al-Muttalib, who was eighty years old. According to traditional accounts, Muhammad was very close to his grandfather, as had been his father before him. However, two years later, his grandfather died. Muhammad then came under the care of his uncle Abu Talib, the new leader of the Hashim clan of the Quraysh tribe. In 6th-century Arabia, there was general disdain for guardians who took care of the weaker members of the tribes in Mecca. Although Muhammad's guardians saw that he did not starve to death, it was hard for them to do more for him, especially as the fortunes of the clan of Hashim seem to have been declining at that time.|$|E

25|$|During {{the course}} of the three series, Audrey and Richard grow closer. Hostile to each other at the start, they grew to {{understand}} and accept each other, as both try to adapt to each other's ways. The last two 1981 episodes show Richard having problems at Cavendish. With his board of directors refusing to let Richard buy a refrigerated plant in Argentina, he seriously considers selling the manor to raise the money to buy the plant himself. Trying to help Richard, Audrey asks her uncle, a well-respected and connected member of the financial community, to lend Richard a hand. Thanks to him, things begin to go Richard's way. Unfortunately, Audrey's uncle dies before the deals are signed. Richard decides to sell the manor to pay for the refrigerated plant. By a twist of fate, Audrey inherits her uncle's fortune and buys the manor <b>back.</b> <b>Now</b> back home and on her own turf, Audrey asks Richard to marry her. Taken aback, Richard says yes and they are married in the final episode, broadcast on 15 October.|$|E

500|$|To begin 1979, Washington won 38–2 and 41–7 against non-conference opponents, with Tyler scoring once in both {{games and}} {{averaging}} 8.2 yards per carry. In their conference opener the next week, the Huskies won on a late-fourth-quarter punt return touchdown from Mark Lee, Lee's first ever punt return; Tyler gained 81 yards over 16 rushing attempts. The winning continued for two games, with Tyler scoring from three yards in both. Called [...] "one of the Pac-10's most under-rated players", the <b>back</b> <b>now</b> needed 65 yards to tie Credell Green for tenth on Washington's list of career rushing yards leaders. The now twelfth-ranked Huskies lost their next two games, to Arizona and the Pittsburgh Panthers. To conclude the season, Washington, then number 13, upset the Texas Longhorns 14–7 with Tyler rushing 19 times for 70yards.|$|E

500|$|While {{many critics}} found the band's new sound refreshing, NME criticized the Chili Peppers for rarely using their {{trademark}} funk sound, asking: [...] "Can {{we have our}} brain-dead, half-dressed funk-hop rock animals <b>back</b> <b>now,</b> please? All this false empathy is starting to make my removed rib tingle." [...] Pitchfork, while considering the album a triumph over One Hot Minute, felt Californication lacked the funk that was ever-present in Blood Sugar Sex Magik. It went on to scrutinize some lyrics for being overly sexual, but also considered Frusciante to be [...] "the best big-time American rock guitarist going right now". Critic Robert Christgau gave the album a one-star honorable mention rating, describing the band as [...] "New Age fuck fiends" [...] and citing [...] "Scar Tissue" [...] and [...] "Purple Stain" [...] as highlights.|$|E
500|$|The 1997 was {{the least}} {{successful}} season ever for the Highlanders. They finished last, and managed only three wins. They spent their pre-season playing in Scotland and England where they won all seven matches. Carl Hoeft said of the pre-season; [...] "Looking <b>back</b> <b>now,</b> it's safe to say it wasn't probably the best way we could have prepared. Even now, people think were crazy when I tell them what we did". They were now coached by Glenn Ross and captained by Taine Randell. Their eight defeats that season included a 7543 defeat by Natal in Durban. The points scored by Natal included 50 points by Gavin Lawlessa competition record. Their three victories that season included defeating the Canterbury Crusaders at Carisbrook, and the Waikato Chiefs at Taupowhere Doug Howlett scored three tries for the Highlanders.|$|E
500|$|Boycott's slow scoring led to {{increasing}} media pressure, and owing to his perceived selfish attitude, he was {{dropped from the}} team after the match. He remembered in 1987 that [...] "the decision stunned me at the time, though looking <b>back</b> <b>now</b> I see that it had become inevitable. I was mortified with embarrassment and filled with an angry, burning sense of injustice which I can remember clearly and painfully to this day." [...] A combination of low confidence and a throat infection limited Boycott to two further Test appearances, playing once more against India and once against Pakistan, {{for the rest of}} the year. He nevertheless again topped the domestic averages with 1260 at 48.46. In 1967, Boycott toured the West Indies with England, where he hit a rich seam of form. He scored 463 runs at 66.14 in a series England won 1–0.|$|E

500|$|... tall, slim boy, {{straight}} as an arrow. His {{face was a}} perfect oval, his hair was as black as a raven's wing, {{and his eyes were}} large and of that peculiar soft, melting blackness, which excites pity when one is in distress. His skin was a clear, dark olive, bordering on the swarthy, and this, with his high cheek bones, would have led us to suppose that his nationality was different from our own, had we not known that his name was plain Henry P. There was an air of good breeding and refinement about him, that, with his small hands and feet, would have set us to thinking, had it not been that in our youth and intensely enthusiastic natures, we gave no thought to our comrades' personal appearance. We can look <b>back</b> <b>now</b> and see the shy, reserved nature of the boy, the dark, melancholy eyes, the sad smile, the sensitive twitching of the lips.|$|E
500|$|A {{muscle strain}} forced Mackin {{to miss a}} {{pre-season}} friendly against Shrewsbury Town in July 2008 and he returned to pre-season training later that month. He was shown a red card after picking up two yellow cards in his first appearance of 2008–09, which was Wrexham's first match in the Conference Premier, as they beat Stevenage Borough 5–0 at home on 9 August 2008. On reflection, Mackin said [...] "As for the second yellow I felt the ball was there to be won and I thought that's what I did. Looking <b>back</b> <b>now</b> I know I should have stayed on my feet". He was handed a one-match suspension and returned in a 1–1 draw away to Rushden & Diamonds on 17 August 2008. Mackin scored his first goal {{of the season with}} a 25-yard shot against Grays Athletic, which was Wrexham's only goal in a 2–1 away defeat on 20 September 2008. Despite starting the season as a regular in the team, he found opportunities hard to come by after the arrival of Dean Saunders as manager.|$|E
500|$|Early in 1954, Waugh's doctors, {{concerned}} by his physical deterioration, advised {{a change of}} scene. On 29 January, he took a ship bound for Ceylon, hoping {{that he would be}} able to finish his novel. Within a few days, he was writing home complaining of [...] "other passengers whispering about me" [...] and of hearing voices, including that of his recent BBC interlocutor, Stephen Black. He left the ship in Egypt and flew on to Colombo, but, he wrote to Laura, the voices followed him. Alarmed, Laura sought help from her friend, Frances Donaldson, whose husband agreed to fly out to Ceylon and bring Waugh home. In fact, Waugh made his own way <b>back,</b> <b>now</b> believing that he was being possessed by devils. A brief medical examination indicated that Waugh was suffering from bromide poisoning from his drugs regimen. When his medication was changed, the voices and the other hallucinations quickly disappeared. Waugh was delighted, informing all of his friends that he had been mad: [...] "Clean off my onion!". The experience was [...] fictionalised a few years later, in The Ordeal of Gilbert Pinfold (1957).|$|E

500|$|According to {{the sheet}} music {{published}} by Alfred Publishing on Musicnotes.com, [...] "Lacrymosa" [...] {{is an alternative}} metal, gothic rock and post-grunge song set in a common time and performed in slow tempo of 48 beats per minute. Although the original Lacrimosa sequence was performed in D-minor, it was transposed into E-minor by Lee and Terry Balsamo. The instrumentation in the song is provided by piano, guitar, violins and drums. Lee's vocal range from the low note of B3 to the high note of E5; the SATB choir vocals range from the low note of B2 to the high note of E4. According to Gauntlet writer Claire Colette, [...] "Lacrymosa" [...] has a [...] "violin intro, synth worth of a Nine Inch Nails album, and Omen-esque choral sections that are very haunting." [...] It then goes on with a pinon-themed melody before the [...] "power guitar section" [...] joins in. Lyrically, the song speaks about a break-up, as illustrated in the verse [...] "And you can blame it on me / Just set your guilt free, honey / I don't want to hold you <b>back</b> <b>now</b> love".|$|E
500|$|In June 2011, Julian re-joined {{his former}} club, now renamed simply Stevenage, on a free transfer, {{three years after}} leaving the club. The move meant that Julian would be playing under the {{management}} of Graham Westley once more, who first brought Julian to Stevenage in 2005 – Westley said [...] "Alan sees the opportunity {{in the long term}} and we all know how much quality he will bring into the squad. He is a different type of character but another man that you would happily go into the trenches with". On signing for Stevenage, Julian said [...] "I had a great time at Stevenage before and coming <b>back</b> <b>now</b> and we are in League One, it is a dream come true". As a result of Chris Day dislocating his finger, Julian started in the club's first game of the 2011–12 campaign, keeping a clean sheet in Stevenage's 0–0 home draw against Exeter City. He played the first three games of the season, before first choice goalkeeper Chris Day returned from injury. Julian made just two further appearances during the campaign; in a 2–2 draw with AFC Wimbledon in the Football League Trophy, and an appearance as a second-half substitute in Stevenage's 2–2 home draw against Huddersfield Town. He was released by Stevenage when his contract expired in May 2012.|$|E
