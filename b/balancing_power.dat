50|$|Several {{theories}} {{of international relations}} draw upon the idea of polarity. The balance of power was a concept prevalent in Europe prior to the First World War, the thought being that by <b>balancing</b> <b>power</b> blocs it would create stability and prevent war.

50|$|VAM is used {{to achieve}} the goal of <b>power</b> <b>balancing</b> the {{physical}} channels across the multiple physical antennas especially when MIMO is deployed in the downlink. VAM gives an illusion to the UE that there are actually lesser antennas at the base station than it actually has. The unbalanced <b>balanced</b> <b>power</b> across two transmits paths are transformed into <b>balanced</b> <b>power</b> at physical antenna ports by VAM. This is achieved using phase and amplitude coefficients (V11, V12, V21, V22) as depicted in the figure.
