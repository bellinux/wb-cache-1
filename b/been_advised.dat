5|$|A {{study of}} the mineral {{contents}} of various edible mushrooms found that C.micaceus contained the highest concentration of potassium in the 34species tested, close to half a gram of potassium per kilogram of mushroom. Because the species can bioaccumulate detrimental heavy metals like lead and cadmium, it has <b>been</b> <b>advised</b> to restrict consumption of specimens collected from roadsides or other collection sites that may be exposed to or contain pollutants.|$|E
5|$|On 9 September, McLaren lodged an {{official}} {{complaint with the}} FIA about the incident. In the appeal hearing on 22 September, McLaren alleged that they had twice <b>been</b> <b>advised</b> by race director Charlie Whiting that Hamilton had correctly returned the position to Räikkönen. Furthermore, they presented telemetry evidence suggesting that Hamilton had not only crossed the finish line after Räikkönen, {{but that he was}} travelling 6.7km/h slower at the time.|$|E
5|$|The move of {{the company}} of the 45th Battalion down the exposed slope was disastrous, {{possibly}} as the company commander had not <b>been</b> <b>advised</b> of the particular difficulties involved. Moving in artillery formation, they were shelled and came under intense machine gun fire, suffering 11 killed and 37 wounded. The survivors scrambled to the embankment in small groups. Although the Official History is silent on who was responsible for this debacle, in his notebooks, the Official Historian, Charles Bean, blamed Imlay.|$|E

5|$|Verity had <b>been</b> <b>advised</b> {{by friends}} {{at the start of}} the season that he would need an {{exceptional}} performance to achieve selection on the 1932–33 Ashes tour of Australia; Alan Hill believes the performance against Nottinghamshire guaranteed Verity would be chosen to tour. In the middle of August, Verity was one of the last men added to the MCC team captained by Douglas Jardine.|$|E
5|$|A 3km {{protection}} zone, 10km {{surveillance zone}} and a restricted zone encompassing 2000km2 were set up. Another 159,000 turkeys were slaughtered with the cull being completed {{on the evening}} of 5 February. Also on 5 February there was criticism that nearby farmers had not <b>been</b> <b>advised</b> as to the action to be taken. Around 320 workers at the plant were given anti-viral drugs. Although a vet from the site was admitted into hospital, suffering from a 'mild respiratory illness' during the evening of 6 February, it was found not to be bird flu. The plant was thoroughly disinfected, with cleaning complete on 12 February, and permission being given for production to resume.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Donna {{returns home}} to warn her mother, Sylvia (Jacqueline King), and {{grandfather}} Wilfred Mott (Bernard Cribbins) about the Doctor, having <b>been</b> <b>advised</b> {{to do so}} by Martha. Concerned about the implications of telling the truth, Donna decides against warning her mother. The Doctor investigates the ATMOS device attached to Donna's car and discovers a secondary function: the device can emit a poisonous gas. Wilfred attempts to take the car off the road, but is trapped when Staal activates all 400 million ATMOS devices installed in cars worldwide. The episode's cliffhanger depicts Donna shouting for help while the Doctor stares helplessly at a street full of cars emitting the gas, while on their ship orbiting the planet, the Sontarans prepare themselves for battle.|$|E

5|$|The local Partisans had <b>been</b> <b>advised</b> of the {{presence}} of the camp and the children, probably by Branko Davila, a doctor who had worked at the pre-existing children's home on the camp site. At dawn on 26August 1942, the Partisan 4th Kordun Brigade attacked the camp and dispersed the Ustaše guard force. The children heard the shooting and began shouting that the Partisans had arrived. Despite attempts by the nuns to hide the children, Partisan troops broke into the buildings and rescued many children. Some of the fighters even found a brother or sister within the camp. The Partisans gave what food they had to the children, and led away from the camp all the children that could walk.|$|E
5|$|An {{investigation}} {{found that the}} crew of the train had not <b>been</b> <b>advised</b> that there was a raised fire risk at the time. WCRC was found not to have co-operated fully with the investigation. The ADC found that WCRC's Safety Management System was deficient due to confusion over whether or not {{the crew of the}} train had been informed of the increased fire risk. WCRC failed to inform Network Rail of its plans to try to prevent future incidents of a similar nature. The ADC found that this was in breach of WCRC's Safety Management System. WCRC chairman David Smith instructed his staff that no further correspondence would be gone into over the matter. The ADC found that this instruction was prejudicial to the safe operation of WCRC's Safety Management System. The instruction was later rescinded. WCRC was also found to be in breach of its Track Access Contract.|$|E
5|$|Following the Belgian Grand Prix on 27 August, {{the teams}} {{conducted}} a four-day testing {{session at the}} Monza circuit and concentrated on optimising their car set-ups for low downforce. Jos Verstappen set the quickest times on the first day, ahead of Pedro Diniz. Coulthard was quickest on the second day. Fisichella suffered a high speed crash going into the Ascari chicane, bringing a brief halt to testing. He visited Rome to undergo a medical examination and was diagnosed with an inflamed tendon in his right ankle, but was cleared to race having <b>been</b> <b>advised</b> to take five days of rest. Jacques Villeneuve set the quickest times {{on the third day}} as rain shortened the team's running. Minardi's Gastón Mazzacane suffered a high speed accident at the Ascari chicane, forcing testing to be stopped. Ralf Schumacher was fastest on the fourth and final day of testing. Michael Schumacher's car developed a malfunction and pulled off the race track, limiting Ferrari's testing time as the car's power unit was changed.|$|E

5|$|In 1985, Goldstone {{ruled that}} the government's mass sacking of 1,700 black staff at Baragwanath Hospital in Soweto had been illegal. The {{following}} year, {{he was the first}} judge to free a political prisoner who had been detained under a recently imposed state of emergency under which the government had given itself draconian police powers. Another important ruling against the state in 1988 resulted in the release of a detainee who had not <b>been</b> <b>advised</b> by the police that he was entitled to a lawyer. In 1989, Goldstone became the first South African judge under apartheid to take on a black law clerk, an African-American Yale Law student named Vernon Grigg. Goldstone also used his judicial prerogatives to visit thousands of people who had been imprisoned without trial, including some who later became members of the post-apartheid South African government. Although he could do little to free them, his visits served to reassure the prisoners – and serve notice to the prison administration – that someone in a position of power was taking an active interest in their well-being. Few white judges at the time enjoyed the trust and respect of the black majority; Goldstone became a notable exception.|$|E
5|$|On 21 January 2012, Wilkie {{announced}} that he was withdrawing his support for the Gillard Government after it broke the agreement he had signed with Gillard to implement mandatory pre-commitment for all poker machines by 2014. He stated that he would support the government's alternative plan to trial pre-commitment in the ACT and require that pre-commitment technology be installed in all poker machines built from 2013, but that this fell short of what he had been promised in return for supporting the government. In response, Gillard and Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs Jenny Macklin argued that there was not enough support in the House of Representatives for Wilkie's preferred option for it to be passed, and that they had <b>been</b> <b>advised</b> it was technically unfeasible to implement mandatory commitment within the time frame he had specified.|$|E
