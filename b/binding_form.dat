40|$|Binding of {{the natural}} estrogens, {{estradiol}} and estriol, was investigated, in 34 samples of human benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH) tissue, using Scatchard analysis and agar gel electrophoresis. Saturation binding analysis using {{a wide range of}} concentrations of both ligands resulted in curvilinear Scatchard plots. This confirmed the presence of two <b>binding</b> <b>forms</b> for estradiol: a true estrogen receptor, and a protein with lower affinity and higher capacity. Both binding species were also demonstrated and quantified with estriol. The electrophoretic process, after incubation at low and high ligand concentrations also resulted in separation, for both estrogens, of two binding peaks. They are probably two distinct forms of the low affinity, high capacity binding measured by Scatchard. The procedure used in our laboratory was not able to provide accurate determination of the concentrations of these <b>binding</b> <b>forms.</b> Possible modifications to alleviate these drawbacks are discussed.

The analyzer consists of a temperature programmed thermolysis unit for sample decomposition and mercury release, coupled downstream to an atomic absorption spectrometry for mercury detection. No sample digestion was needed and this greatly simplifies the analytical procedure and minimizes potential sources of contamination. The precision of the method is in general better than 1. 4 %; the detection limit (3 σ) is 6. 3 ng/g; the recovery based on the analysis of standard reference materials ranges from 93. 5 to 107 %. The performance of the method has been compared with inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) technique and excellent agreements were observed between the two methods. The method {{has been applied to}} the investigation of the distribution and <b>binding</b> <b>forms</b> of mercury in rats, which had been fed orally with cinnabar and HgCl 2. The results obtained show that mercury is mainly accumulated in the tissues of liver and kidney, meanwhile, the mercury levels in different tissues change with the feeding time, dosage and the chemical form of mercury compounds. In addition to total mercury measurements, the mercury thermal release profiles obtained from temperature programmed thermolysis provides mercury <b>binding</b> <b>forms</b> information, and preliminary data suggest the presence of protein/polypeptide-bound Hg compounds in kidney samples of rats. © 2005 Elsevier B.

50|$|The {{choice of}} these United States Iraq war resisters {{to go to}} Canada has led to {{considerable}} debate in Canada's society, press, legal arenas, and political arenas. On 3 June 2008 and 30 March 2009, two motions were passed in the Parliament of Canada {{in support of the}} war resisters' efforts to stay in Canada. An Angus Reid Strategies poll taken on 6 and 7 June 2008, showed that 64% of Canadians agreed with that motion.

The activity of this enzyme has been followed by reactivation of hormone binding sites and phosphorylation on tyrosine of calf uterus phosphatase-inactivated receptor. Phosphorylation of the receptor has been demonstrated by interaction of kinase 32 P-phosphorylated proteins with anti-receptor antibody followed either by sucrose gradient centrifugation or SDS-PAGE of the immunoprecipitated proteins. Hormone stimulation of the kinase is inhibited by receptor occupancy of the anti-oestrogen tamoxifen. Oestradiol-receptor complex increases the affinity of the kinase for the dephosphorylated receptor. Findings of this report {{are consistent with the}} observation that several protein tyrosine kinases that are associated with peptide hormone receptors are stimulated by the binding of the hormone to the receptor.

In this study, a method using electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) had been developed and employed to study the stoichiometries of Cd(II) and Cu(I) binding with MT- 2 a. Mt- 2 a was purified from MT mixture by reversed phase liquid chromatography and identified by ESI-MS. Different amounts of Cd and Cu were then added in MT- 2 a samples and ESI-MS was employed to determine the mass difference of MT in different samples. The results showed that Cd(II) prefer to cooperatively bind in alpha-domain with the form of Cd 42 +S 11; while Cd is attached in separate binding sites for the formation of Cd 32 +S 9 cluster, which intermediately formed with five and six Cd ions were detected.

In this study nucleo-protein binding of tri-cationic meso-tri(4 -N-methylpyridyl) -mono-(4 -carboxyphenyl) porphyrin (TMPCP) and tetrapeptides conjugated TMPCP (TMPCP- 4 P) and bi-cationic meso- 5, 10 -bis(4 -N-methylpyridyl) - 15, 20 -di-(4 -carboxyphenyl) porphyrin (BMPCP- 4 P 2) was investigated with comprehensive spectroscopic methods. The key observation is that tetrapeptide-conjugates of cationic porphyrins {{with two or three}} positive charges bind to encapsidated DNA in T 7 phage nucleoprotein complex. The binding modes were analyzed byfluorescent en-ergy transfer,fluorescent life time and CD measurements. Intercalative binding ismost feasiblewhen tricationic ligands complex withDNA, especiallywhen it is in close connection with protein capsid. It was found that larger ligand BMPCP- 4 P 2 binds externally to encapsidated T 7 DNA, and complex externally as well as by intercalation when the DNA accommodate to relaxed B-conformation. In the case of TMPCP and TMPCP- 4 P the intercalation is the predominant <b>binding</b> <b>form</b> both in nucleoprotein (NP) and preheated complexes.

It has been previously demonstrated that beta(1), integrins alpha 4 beta(1) and alpha 5 beta(1) are expressed in a nonligand <b>binding</b> <b>form</b> by human hemopoietic progenitor cells but can be activated into a ligand <b>binding</b> <b>form</b> {{by a variety of}} stimuli including intracellular stimuli generated by cytokine receptors and extracellular stimuli generated by function-activating anti-beta(1) integrin monoclonal antibodies (MAbs). In both instances, the activation of beta(1) integrins {{is believed to be the}} result of conformational,changes propagating along the beta(1) integrin chain which in turn increase accessibility to the ligand. A cluster of either function-activating or function-inhibiting anti-beta(1) integrin MAbs have been shown to bind within a 12 amino acid long regulatory loop between residues 207 and 218 of the human beta(1) integrin chain. We describe in this report the first MAb (96. 9 H 9) specific for this regulatory loop whose binding is cation-dependent and requires either Ca 2 + or Mn 2 + but not Mg 2 +. In addition, the activation of alpha 4 beta(1) and alpha 5 beta(1) integrins by 96. 9 H 9 is a two-step process with distinct cation requirements. Whereas Ca 2 + is sufficient to promote binding of the antibody to the beta(1) integrin chain, Mg 2 + is necessary for activating function following 96. 9 H 9 binding. Our data therefore suggest that the regulatory epitope of the human beta(1) integrin chain is flexible with multiple conformations according to the cationic environment...|$|E

LPS- 27 containing hexa-acylated lipid A, similar to the LPS present in usual gram-negative bacteria, stimulated an inflammatory response in human U 937 cells through Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR 4). LPS- 37, which did not contain hexa-acylated lipid A, exhibited strong antagonistic activity to the TLR 4 -mediated inflammatory response. The phagocytic activity in the cells was not affected by LPS- 37. To estimate the activity of LPS in its bacterial <b>binding</b> <b>form,</b> formalin-killed bacteria (FKB) were prepared from Y. pestis cells grown at 27 °C or 37 °C (termed FKB- 27 and FKB- 37, respectively). FKB- 27 strongly stimulated the inflammatory response. This activity was suppressed {{in the presence of}} an anti-TLR 4 antibody but not an anti-TLR 2 antibody. In addition, this activity was almost completely suppressed by LPS- 37, indicating that the activity of FKB- 27 is predominantly derived from the LPS- 27 bacterial <b>binding</b> <b>form.</b> In contrast, FKB- 37 showed no antagonistic activity. The results arising from the current study indicate that Y. pestis causes infection in humans without stimulating the TLR 4 -based defense system via bacterial binding of LPS- 37, even when bacterial free LPS- 37 is not released to suppress the defense system. This is in contrast to the findings for bacteria that possess agonistic LPS types, which are easily recognized by the defense system via the bacterial binding forms...|$|E
