5|$|Before take-off, D'Mario placed three cloth-covered foam {{cushions}} {{on top of}} {{a heating}} vent under the instructor navigator's seat in the aft section of the lower deck. Shortly after take-off, another cushion was placed under the seat. The flight was uneventful until the scheduled mid-air refueling from a KC-135 Stratotanker, which had to be conducted manually because of an error with the B-52G's autopilot. About one hour after refueling, while the aircraft was circling above its designated area, Captain Haug directed co-pilot Svitenko to take his rest period. His seat was taken by the spare pilot, D'Mario. The crew was uncomfortable because of the cold, although the heater's rheostat was turned up, so D'Mario opened an engine <b>bleed</b> <b>valve</b> to draw additional hot air into the heater from the engine manifold. Because of a heater malfunction, the air barely cooled as it traveled from the engine manifold to the cabin's heating ducts. During the next half-hour, the cabin's temperature became uncomfortably hot, and the stowed cushions ignited. After one crew member reported smelling burning rubber, they looked for a fire. The navigator searched the lower compartment twice before discovering the fire behind a metal box. He attempted to fight it with two fire extinguishers, but could not put it out.|$|E

50|$|The {{propellant}} <b>bleed</b> <b>valves</b> used in {{both the}} fuel and oxidizer systems were poppet-type, which were spring-loaded to the normally open position and pressure-actuated to the closed position. Both propellant <b>bleed</b> <b>valves</b> were mounted to the bootstrap lines adjacent to their respective turbopump discharge flanges. The valves allowed propellant to circulate in the propellant feed system lines to achieve proper operating temperature prior to engine start, and were engine controlled. At engine start, a helium control solenoid valve in the pneumatic control package was energized allowing pneumatic pressure to close the <b>bleed</b> <b>valves,</b> which remained closed during engine operation.|$|R

2500|$|The wide use of {{feedback}} controllers {{did not become}} feasible until the development of wide band high-gain amplifiers to use the concept of negative feedback. This had been developed in telephone engineering electronics by Harold Black in the late 1920s, but not published until 1934. Independently, Clesson E Mason of the Foxboro Company in 1930 invented a wide-band pneumatic controller by combining the nozzle and flapper high-gain pneumatic amplifier, which had been invented in 1914, with negative feedback from the controller output. This dramatically increased the linear range of operation of the nozzle and flapper amplifier, and integral control could also be added {{by the use of}} a precision <b>bleed</b> <b>valve</b> and a bellows generating the Integral term. The result was the [...] "Stabilog" [...] controller which gave both proportional and integral functions using feedback bellows. Later the derivative term was added by a further bellows and adjustable orifice.|$|E

50|$|Although the {{operating}} pressure was maintained by an automatically controlled <b>bleed</b> <b>valve</b> once the plant had reached steady state, the valve {{could not be used}} during start-up, when there was no air feed, the plant being pressurised with nitrogen. During start-up the <b>bleed</b> <b>valve</b> was normally isolated and there was no route for excess pressure to escape; pressure was kept within acceptable limits (slightly wider that those achieved under automatic control) by operator intervention (manual operation of vent valves). A pressure-relief valve acting at 11 kg/cm2 (156 psi) gauge was also fitted.|$|E
5|$|In the Space Shuttle {{the main}} {{oxidizer}} and fuel <b>bleed</b> <b>valves</b> were used after shutdown to dump any residual propellant, with residual liquid oxygen venting through {{the engine and}} residual liquid hydrogen venting through the liquid hydrogen fill and drain valves.

50|$|The {{propellant}} {{feed system}} consists of separate fuel and oxidizer turbopumps (the bearings {{of which were}} lubricated by the fluid being pumped because the extremely low operating temperature of the engine precluded use of lubricants or other fluids), several valves (including the main fuel valve, main oxidizer valve, propellant utilization valve and fuel and oxidizer <b>bleed</b> <b>valves),</b> fuel and oxidizer flowmeters, and interconnecting lines.|$|R
50|$|The air {{pressure}} system on a tire changer provides {{the air to}} inflate tires mounted on wheels. The {{air pressure}} system consists of 4 components: air hose, air inflation gauge, inflation pedal and manual pressure <b>bleed</b> <b>valve.</b> The air hose is located {{near the top of}} the tire changer, and it allows compressed air to travel into the tire. A specialized end is used on the air hose to clamp firmly onto valve stems of the wheels. The air inflation gauge displays the air pressure within the tire when the air hose is connected to the valve stem. The air inflation gauge displays the pressure in pounds per square inch (psi). Directly below the air hose on the side of the tire changer is the inflation pedal that enables the inflation of the tire. When the inflation pedal is raised, a burst of air is released from valves next to each rim clamp toward the bottom bead of the tire to help with inflation. The manual <b>bleed</b> <b>valve</b> is located next to the air hose and air inflation gauge. The manual <b>bleed</b> <b>valve</b> allows the manual release of air pressure from tire.|$|E
50|$|There {{are several}} {{advantages}} in using a Double Block and <b>Bleed</b> <b>Valve.</b> Significantly, {{because all the}} valve components are housed in a single unit, the space required for the installation is dramatically reduced thus freeing up room for other pieces of essential equipment.|$|E

50|$|When {{the engine}} cutoff signal was {{received}} by the electrical control package, it de-energized the main-stage and ignition phase solenoid valves and energized the helium control solenoid de-energizer timer. This, in turn, permitted closing pressure to the main fuel, main oxidizer, gas generator control, and augmented spark igniter valves. The oxidizer turbine bypass <b>valve</b> and propellant <b>bleed</b> <b>valves</b> opened and the gas generator and LOX dome purges were initiated.|$|R
40|$|The {{feasibility}} of self actuating <b>bleed</b> <b>valves</b> {{as a shock}} stabilization system in the inlet of the YF- 12 is considered for vortex valves, slide valves, and poppet valves. Analytical estimation of valve performance indicates that only the slide and poppet valves located in the inlet cowl can meet the desired steady state stabilizing flows, and of the two the poppet valve is substantially faster in response to dynamic disturbances. The poppet valve is, therefore, selected as the best shock stability system for the YF- 12 inlet...|$|R
50|$|Start {{sequence}} {{was initiated}} by supplying energy to two spark plugs {{in the gas}} generator and two in the augmented spark igniter for ignition of the propellants. Next, two solenoid valves were actuated; one for helium control, and one for ignition phase control. Helium was routed to hold the propellant <b>bleed</b> <b>valves</b> closed and to purge the thrust chamber LOX dome, the LOX pump intermediate seal, and the gas generator oxidizer passage. In addition, the main fuel and ASI oxidizer valves were opened, creating an ignition flame in the ASI chamber that passed {{through the center of}} the thrust chamber injector.|$|R
50|$|Larger valves are {{available}} for larger systems and these may be more sophisticated. They usually have a manual <b>bleed</b> <b>valve</b> or screw.

2500|$|The {{aircraft}} {{involved in}} the accident was a Beechcraft 200 Super King Air, registration VH-SKC, serial number BB-47, manufactured in 1975. The aircraft had 18,771 hours of service before the accident. The amount of air passed into the cabin is controlled by <b>bleed</b> air <b>valves</b> on the engines. The positions of the <b>bleed</b> air <b>valves</b> can be altered by the pilot. According to the accident report, [...] "The aircraft was not ﬁtted with a high cabin altitude aural warning device, nor was it required to be."

50|$|Around 3 {{minutes and}} 45 seconds after {{taking off from}} Irkutsk, at an {{altitude}} of 4.000 ft, the engine no 2 suddenly failed. A destruction occurred on the engines air starter that did not shut down after the engine was started and continued to operate at high revs (over 40,000 rpm) with open air <b>bleed</b> <b>valves</b> from the engines. The rotating disk of the turbine then flew from the starter's compartment and entered the engine and compartment area. This ultimately led to the destruction of the left engine's fuel lines. The hydraulic system elements, broke through the rear case of the combustion chamber and left the engine. The fuel supply for the fuel injectors stopped, which led to the ignition of flames on the engine no 2. The engine no 2 burst into flames.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The current paper {{reports a}} {{numerical}} investigation of stall inception in a transonic compressor rotor, NASA Rotor- 67, {{by using the}} whole flow passages in the computations. Sur-face roughness is added {{to one of the}} blades in order to trigger rotating stall. During stall incep-tion, the tip clearance vortex moved away from the suction surface of the roughened blade’s upper neighbour, leading to vortex breakdown. The stall cell was found to propagate opposite the direction of the blade rotation at about 30 per cent of rotational speed. The effect of air bleeding on stabilizing the compressor is also studied in this work. The mean mass flowrate removed from the <b>bleed</b> <b>valves</b> was 1. 2 per cent of the mainstream flowrate. This amount of bleeding was found to effectively suppress the stalling disturbances...|$|R

50|$|A {{block and}} bleed {{manifold}} with one block valve and one <b>bleed</b> <b>valve</b> {{is also known as}} an isolation valve or {{block and bleed}} valve; a block and bleed manifold with multiple valves is also known as an isolation manifold. This valve is used in combustible gas trains in many industrial applications. Block and bleed needle valves are used in hydraulic and pneumatic systems because the needle valve allows for precise flow regulation when there is low flow in a non-hazardous environment.|$|E
50|$|This type of Double Block and Bleed Valves have a {{patented}} design which incorporates two {{ball valves}} and a <b>bleed</b> <b>valve</b> into one compact cartridge type unit with ANSI B16.5 tapped flanged connections. The major benefit of this design configuration {{is that the}} valve has the same face-to-face dimension as a single block ball valve (as specified in API 6D and ANSI B16.10), which means the valve can easily be installed into an existing pipeline {{without the need for}} any pipeline re-working.|$|E
40|$|This project {{developed}} the inlet metering system. An inlet metering system represents a new option in hydraulic pump design. Traditional pressure controlled hydraulic pumps rely on either swashplate displacement (for variable displacement pumps) or <b>bleed</b> off <b>valves</b> (for fixed displacement pumps). Variable displacement pumps require mechanically complex parts which are expensive to machine {{and prone to}} break down. <b>Bleed</b> off <b>valves</b> represent a significant loss in system efficiency. In contrast, the inlet metering system is able {{to make use of}} a fixed displacement pump (which is relatively inexpensive and mechanically robust) and a two-way spool valve. This dissertation goes through the process of designing the valve and pump dimensions, presents a theoretical dynamic analysis, studies the control law associated with this pump, and examines the energy requirements associated with inlet metering system operation. A prototype of the design was constructed and experimental data was used to validate the efficiency analysis. The major finding associated with this work was that the inlet metering system can be designed to display a first order pressure response. This means that when the inlet metering system is operated, the actual pressure in the system will never exceed the desired pressure. In contrast, traditional hydraulic systems will display up to 60 % pressure overshoot, meaning the systems must be designed to handle pressures significantly greater than operating pressures. Additionally {{it was found that the}} inlet metering system is more efficient than using a <b>bleed</b> off <b>valve,</b> but less efficient than using a variable displacement pump...|$|R
50|$|Applications {{for use in}} this {{industry}} {{take full advantage of}} the many benefits electroless nickel has to offer. Deposit properties such as uniformity, corrosion resistance, lubricity and wear resistance are all reasons why the use of EN for automotive applications continues to grow. Historically, a cost sensitive market segment, auto makers have embraced the use low cost materials plated with a thin film of electroless nickel to meet strict requirements in an economical fashion. Fuel injection systems, aluminum fuel filters, brake pins and <b>bleed</b> <b>valves</b> are just a few applications that take full advantage of the deposit’s corrosion resistance. Differential pinion shafts and a variety of pins and washers are plated in large quantities due to the coatings lubricity, wear resistance and anti-galling properties (Figure 15). Brake pistons are plated in bright, medium phosphorus electroless nickel and heat treated to increase hardness and wear resistance. High deposit luster is desired and actually improves the surface finish of the piston resulting in reduced friction (Figure 16). Cast iron slip yokes are plated with EN to eliminate noise associated with galling.|$|R
40|$|Multiple-spool gas {{turbines}} are usually utilized for power supply in aircrafts, ships, and terrestrial electric utility plants. As a result, having a reliable model {{of them can}} aid with the control design process and stability analysis. Since several interconnected components are coupled both thermodynamically and through shafts, these engines cannot be modeled linearly as single shaft {{gas turbines}}. In this paper, intercomponent volume method (ICV) has been implemented for turbine modeling. A switched feedback control system incorporating bump-less transfer and antiwindup functionality is employed as governor for the engine. Validation with test results from a three spool gas turbine highlights high accuracy of turbine-governor model in various maneuvers. Results show that over-speed after load rejection is considerable {{due to the fact}} that in this arrangement, the power turbine (PT) is not coupled with the compressor which acts like a damper for single shaft gas turbines. To address this problem, <b>bleed</b> <b>valves</b> (mainly before combustion chamber) are used to arrest the over-speed by 20 %. In addition, a switch is employed into the governor system to rapidly shift fuel to permissible minimum flow...|$|R
50|$|These valves replace {{existing}} traditional techniques {{employed by}} pipeline engineers {{to generate a}} {{double block and bleed}} configuration in the pipeline. Two block valves and a <b>bleed</b> <b>valve</b> are as a unit, or manifold, to be installed for positive isolation. Used for critical process service, DBB valves are for high pressure systems or toxic/hazardous fluid processes. Applications that use DBB valves include instrument drain, chemical injection connection, chemical seal isolation, and gauge isolation. DBB valves do the work of three separate valves (2 isolations and 1 drain) and require less space and have less weight.|$|E

50|$|To provide {{third stage}} restart {{capability}} for the Saturn V, the J-2 gaseous hydrogen start tank was refilled in 60 seconds {{during the previous}} firing after the engine had reached steady-state operation (refill of the gaseous helium tank was not required because the original ground-fill supply was sufficient for three starts). Prior to engine restart, the stage ullage rockets were fired to settle the propellants in the stage propellant tanks, ensuring a liquid head to the turbopump inlets. In addition, the engine propellant <b>bleed</b> <b>valves</b> were opened, the stage recirculation valve was opened, the stage prevalve was closed, and a LOX and LH2 circulation was effected through the engine bleed system for five minutes to condition the engine to the proper temperature to ensure proper engine operation. Engine restart was initiated after the “engine ready” signal was received from the stage. This {{was similar to the}} initial “engine ready”. The hold time between cutoff and restart was from a minimum of 1.5 hours to a maximum of 6 hours, depending upon the number of earth orbits required to attain the lunar window for translunar trajectory.|$|R
