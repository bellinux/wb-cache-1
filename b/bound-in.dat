5000|$|Stockham {{was very}} {{concerned}} with the economic plight of divorced women with children and prostitutes who wanted {{to get off the}} street. She felt that these women had no marketable skills and would be unable to support themselves, so she had copies of her book Tokology, a layperson's guide to gynecology and midwifery, privately printed and gave them to [...] "unfortunate women" [...] to sell door-to-door in Chicago. Each copy came with a <b>bound-in</b> certificate signed by Stockham and entitling the bearer to a free gynecological exam.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the late}} 1970s and early 1980s, when {{computer}} programs and other binary data were often stored on audio cassettes, {{a number of}} microcomputer hobbyist magazines published [...] "flexible program sheets" [...] under various trademarked names including [...] "Floppy ROM", [...] "Flexisoft", and [...] "Discoflex". These <b>bound-in</b> thin plastic 33 RPM audio recordings stored computer data such as video game programs that would be played on a turntable and dubbed onto a cassette. It was also possible to connect the record player's output to the computer's cassette (analog signal) input port and load the data into the computer directly. This method of storing computer data later expanded to include non-flexi-disc novelty releases from musicians such as Chris Sievey.|$|E
5000|$|The Rocketeer's first {{adventure}} {{appeared in}} 1982 {{as a backup}} feature in issues #2 and #3 of Mike Grell's Starslayer series from Pacific Comics. Two more installments appeared in Pacific's showcase comic Pacific Presents #1 and 2. The fourth chapter ended in a cliffhanger that was later concluded in a special Rocketeer issue released by Eclipse Comics. The complete story was then collected by Eclipse in a single volume titled The Rocketeer (...) [...] It was published in three versions: a trade paperback edition, a trade hardcover, and a signed, limited edition hardcover. Noted fantasy author Harlan Ellison, {{a fan of the}} Rocketeer and also an acquaintance of Dave Stevens, wrote the introduction to the collection; both Dave Stevens and Harlan Ellison signed the limited edition on a specially <b>bound-in</b> bookplate.|$|E
5000|$|Smith {{was known}} for {{bringing}} public attention to piano works of musical worth that had fallen into obscurity for non-musical reasons. His [...] "Rare Finds" [...] column in Piano Today magazine combined editions of piano pieces with essays about the piece and the composer. David Dubal wrote that [...] "Smith's editions of rare piano musics are exemplary, and his articles in the magazine Piano Today are eagerly read." [...] He published books combining essays and sheet music, in some cases with a <b>bound-in</b> CD of his own performances. He also presented his ideas in recitals, recordings, books, and radio broadcasts. Stuart Isacoff called him [...] "a walking encyclopedia of the piano" [...] and credited him with help in writing A Natural History of the Piano. [...] He also appeared in the documentary film Seymour: An Introduction.|$|E
5000|$|Early {{issues of}} Eightball feature {{a mixture of}} very short, often crudely humorous comics ("Zubrick and Pogeybait", [...] "The Sensual Santa"), topical rants and satires ("Art School Confidential", [...] "On Sports"), longer, more {{reflective}} self-contained stories ("Caricature", [...] "Immortal Invisible"), and serialized works. The first extended story serialized in Eightball was Like a Velvet Glove Cast in Iron, which ran in issues #1-10. Glove was followed by Ghost World (issues #11-18). Beginning with #19 each issue of Eightball {{has been devoted to}} a single storyline, as opposed to the more eclectic format of the earlier issues. Issues #19-21 serialized the graphic novel David Boring, while issues #22 and 23 each consisted of a collection of short, fragmentary stories in diverse styles and formats that meshed into a unified narrative ("Ice Haven" [...] and [...] "The Death Ray"). The issues of Eightball beginning with #19 have been published in full color in a larger magazine-sized format. Eightball #18 included a <b>bound-in</b> copy of Clowes's pamphlet Modern Cartoonist.|$|E
5000|$|According to the Chicago Manual of Style, [...] "Errata, {{lists of}} errors and their corrections, {{may take the}} form of loose, {{inserted}} sheets or <b>bound-in</b> pages. An errata sheet is definitely not a usual part of a book. It should never be supplied to correct simple typographical errors (which may be rectified in a later printing) or to insert additions to, or revisions of, the printed text (which should wait for the next edition of the book). It is a device to be used only in extreme cases where errors severe enough to cause misunderstanding are detected too late to correct in the normal way but before the finished book is distributed. Then the errors may be listed with their locations and their corrections on a sheet that is tipped in, either before or after the book is bound, or laid in loose, usually inside the front cover of the book. (Tipping and inserting must be done by hand, thus adding considerably to the cost of the book.)" ...|$|E

40|$|In {{the last}} ten years, {{there has been a}} steady {{increase}} in the attention paid to Massively Multiplayer Online Role Play Games (MMOs) as a site of academic research. A number of large and influential academic studies have been undertaken in a range of disciplines inside MMOs such as EverQuest (Taylor, 2006), Star Wars Galaxies (Ducheneaut & Moore, 2004), Lineage I and II (Steinkeuhler, 2004) and EverQuestII (Castronova et al, 2009). Generally, these studies require the researcher to be embedded in-world, participating as a player in the game. In this paper, we ask: what bounds on research, if any, are ostensibly set by the contractual terms of service of MMOs by which all participants are <b>bound—in</b> particular the duty to "play"; whether this has any problematic bearing on the practice of research; and, if so, whether there are solutions to these problems? This paper will consider the contractual terms used in the End User Licence Agreements (EULAs) of two MMOs, EvE Online and City of Heroes, in order to further explore the practical implications of those terms. This paper concludes that researchers need to consider whether their research is ethical, both in terms of formal compliance with Institutional Research Board (IRB) requirements and how it may impact upon or disrupt the player community. If it does have a disruptive impact, this may take the research not only outside the notion of ethical research, but also outside of the concept of "play" authorised by the EULA itself.

40|$|Performance, in its multi-participant aspects, {{tends to}} emphasise the {{relationship}} between the individual and the collective. Through an examination of practices of co-working in contemporary performing arts, and with a particular focus on choreographic practices, the thesis develops a theory of co-labouring grounded in the idea of an economy of belonging. Borrowing from Brian Massumi’s concept of ‘becoming-together’ (Massumi, 2002, 2011), this thesis assumes that the development of a sense of belonging is bound to temporal processes of becoming, and that such transient ways of being can be identified as central to an understanding of current collective formations. The thesis argues that the notion of becoming together in performance-making is likely to promote an ethics of belonging which foregrounds the practitioner’s affective commitment to the other, to relational modes of working and encompasses multiple and open-ended action modes. Co-labouring in performance is revealed as a site of human interaction which can yield new insights into the construction of contemporary digital collective identities. Building on post and para-human ideas of the multiplicity of self (Rotman, 2008), co-working is presented as a way to address {{the relationship between}} individual and collective becoming in advanced technological society. A central aim of the thesis is to investigate how far relational modes of working can enhance performance-making and the practitioner’s experience and sense of the self. Engaging with post-autonomist ideas of immaterial labour (Lazzarato, 1996; Negri, 2008), the thesis further assesses the extent to and conditions under which contemporary practices demonstrate patterns of resistance to dominant modes of working. The complexities of modes of co-working are examined {{through the use of a}} reflective research metadiscourse, which incorporates distinct registers of practice, commentary and analysis. These include a historical register, the use of case studies, and a practice-led stream of inquiry <b>bound-in</b> to and tied back to the theoretical. This approach allows for a multidimensional but also a critical view of modes of co-labouring; it reveals that an informed coworking is bound to the possibility of individual transformation for the co-workers in performance. In other words, the thesis argues that performance mastery (Melrose, 2003) can be seen as partly constituted by the participants’ negotiation of {{the relationship between the}} individual and collective...|$|E
