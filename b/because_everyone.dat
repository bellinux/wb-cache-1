5|$|The Fasci {{movement}} {{was made up}} of a federation of scores of associations that developed among farm workers, tenant farmers, and small sharecroppers as well as artisans, intellectuals, and industrial workers. The immediate demands of the movement were fair land rents, higher wages, lower local taxes and distribution of misappropriated common land. Between 1889 and 1893 some 170 Fasci were established in Sicily. According to some sources the movement reached a membership of more than 300,000 by the end of 1893. The Fasci constituted autonomous organizations with their own insignia (red rosettes), uniforms and sometimes even musical bands, and their own local halls for reunions and congresses. They were called Fasci (Fascio literally means bundle) <b>because</b> <b>everyone</b> can break a single stick, but no one can break a bundle of sticks.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the pool}} halls in 1870s Pittsburgh also {{broadcast}} horse races via telegraph. The often colorful race descriptions soon captured young Smith's attention and he wrote down and stockpiled the names and times of the winning horses for a year to form crude racing charts. In the fall of 1879, Smith placed his first bet on a 5:1 odds horse named Gabriel running in a race at the Brighton Beach racetrack at Coney Island. He won $38 when the horse won by 2 lengths but did not show any outward signs of emotion while the race was run. Determined that he could win at horse racing, Smith quit {{his job at the}} cork factory and accrued more than $5,000 from betting on horse races in the next two years, hiding the proceeds under his mattress at home. Upon his mother eventually discovering the money, he reasoned with her that he was not really gambling because he was making logical predictions based on the past performances of horses and not merely guessing. By 1885, Smith had {{become one of the most}} touted gamblers in Pittsburgh and had won over $100,000 without ever seeing a horse race run firsthand. However, Smith was becoming too famous in Pittsburgh. He could not maintain the favorable, high odds when placing bets that he had attained earlier in his career when he was a virtual unknown <b>because</b> <b>everyone</b> in the crowd would lower the odds by betting his choices.|$|E

5000|$|It helps build discipline, <b>because</b> <b>everyone’s</b> natural {{instinct}} is to begin {{as fast as they}} can. It takes a lot of self-restraint to allow others to run ahead and not be pulled along with them, in turn throwing the racing strategy out the window. To run a negative split the runner has to run his/her own race.|$|R
25|$|Standardized {{tests are}} {{perceived}} as being fairer than non-standardized tests, <b>because</b> <b>everyone</b> gets the same test and the same grading system. This is fairer and more objective than {{a system in which}} some students get an easier test and others get a more difficult test. The consistency also permits more reliable comparison of outcomes across all test takers, <b>because</b> <b>everyone</b> is taking the same test. The prevalence of standardized testing in formal education has also been criticized for many reasons, however.|$|E
25|$|According to Simmel, {{in small}} groups, secrets are less needed <b>because</b> <b>everyone</b> {{seems to be}} more similar. In larger groups secrets are needed {{as a result of their}} heterogeneity. In secret societies, groups are held {{together}} by the need to maintain the secret, a condition that also causes tension because the society relies on its sense of secrecy and exclusion.|$|E
25|$|I {{told people}} the {{complete}} opposite. I told them I raised it up 140 volts. I felt so bad. I felt so f—ing horrible, man. They said, “Please don’t attempt what Eddie Van Halen {{said in the}} last interview, <b>because</b> <b>everyone</b> was blowing their amps.” Everyone fried their amps ’cause of me. I felt so bad. I never lied again after that.|$|E
50|$|An {{organization}} may {{be having}} competing frameworks for interpreting a job. Equivocality refers to multiple interpretations of the field. Each interpretation is unambiguous but differ {{from each other and}} they may be mutually exclusive or in conflict. Equivocality result not only <b>because</b> <b>everyone’s</b> experiences and values are unique but also from unreliable or conflicting preferences and goals, different interests or vague roles and responsibilities.|$|R

It was the first single at the number one spot after 3½ years (their last number one hit being [...] "As for One Day".) The song's lyrics were {{credited}} for its success, with lines like [...] "walking, you're not alone <b>because</b> <b>everyone's</b> here with you, praying for peace". It {{was a bit of}} a turn from the hyperactive singles the group had been releasing. Tsunku's group, Sharan Q, also made a rock cover of this song.|$|R
40|$|In {{times of}} declining enrollment, {{increasing}} budget constraints, increased FTE scrutiny, {{and the need}} for departments to justify their personnel, having a student services coordinator (SSC) might seem like a luxury position that is subject to elimination. Yet, we suggest that a SSC is crucial to forestry programs, and that the benefits far outweigh the costs. An effective SSC can provide personal attention and mentoring which are keys for successful recruitment and retention, therefore, increasing FTEs. These key activities are often neglected without a SSC, <b>because</b> <b>everyone’s</b> time is already overcommitted...|$|R
25|$|Eyler and Giles {{noted that}} at the {{beginning}} and end of a college semester that included three hours of community service a week, students reported a much higher regard for cultural differences. At the end of the semester those who had participated in service-learning were noted as saying that the most important things that they had learned were not to judge others, and to appreciate every type of person <b>because</b> <b>everyone</b> shares some similar key characteristics.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, newly learned {{words are}} seldom put into use. This arises <b>because</b> <b>everyone</b> in China {{communicates}} through Mandarin and English {{is perceived to}} be of little use in the country. This is further reinforced through the national Band 4 examination where 80% of the test was the writing component, 20% was devoted to listening, and speaking was excluded entirely. According to a national survey, only half of the teachers consider that vocabulary should be learned through conversation or communication. A far smaller percentage support activities such as role playing or vocabulary games.|$|E
25|$|Chapter Eleven – Who Stole the Tarts?: Alice {{attends a}} trial in which the Knave of Hearts is accused of {{stealing}} the Queen's tarts. The jury is composed of various animals, including Bill the Lizard; the White Rabbit is the court's trumpeter; and the judge is the King of Hearts. During the proceedings, Alice finds that she is steadily growing larger. The dormouse scolds Alice and tells her she {{has no right to}} grow at such a rapid pace and take up all the air. Alice scoffs and calls the dormouse's accusation ridiculous <b>because</b> <b>everyone</b> grows and she cannot help it. Meanwhile, witnesses at the trial include the Hatter, who displeases and frustrates the King through his indirect answers to the questioning, and the Duchess's cook.|$|E
5000|$|He next {{competed in}} the 1500-metre {{freestyle}} in Shanghai where he again finished second behind Sun who swam to a world record time. Of a second finish behind Sun, Cochrane could only say that [...] "He shows that he's had that much more base-work training and he can get to that world record, which is fantastic. I think it's great, especially for the distance events <b>because</b> <b>everyone's</b> {{been talking about this}} world record year after year and there's more pressure that's built up...He's showed amazing stroke and amazing ability." ...|$|R

25|$|This {{distinction}} had {{implications for}} New Divinity preaching and evangelism that were departures from traditional Puritan beliefs. For the Puritans, conversion was a gradual process involving spiritual crises, humiliation, and sorrow for sin. Only after these struggles and utilizing {{the means of}} grace (prayer, seeking God, reading the Bible, and attending church) would the individual discern within himself faith and love for Christ and be encouraged to repent. New Divinity ministers, however, called all sinners to repent and believe the gospel immediately <b>because</b> <b>everyone</b> had the natural ability to do so. There was no reason, they said, to wait for any period of conviction and spiritual struggle. While immediate repentance was criticized by Old Calvinists, there was practically little {{difference between the two}} approaches. When asked how to repent, Old Calvinists and New Divinity ministers had the same advice: seek God through the means of grace and in time God might give the seeker new affections and inclinations to believe in Christ.|$|E
25|$|Joey {{offers to}} pay Patrick to take Kat {{to the prom}} so he can take Bianca. Patrick {{initially}} refuses, but relents when Joey offers him more money. Kat is still angry with Patrick, but he wins her over by serenading her with the accompaniment of the marching band, and she helps him sneak out of detention. They go on a date which turns romantic, but Kat becomes suspicious and angry when Patrick insists that she go {{with him to the}} prom, an event she is adamantly against. Bianca is irritated that Cameron hasn't asked her to the prom, and so accepts Joey's invitation, but Walter won't allow it unless Kat goes too. Kat confesses to Bianca that she dated Joey when they were freshmen and, succumbing to peer pressure, had sex with him. Afterward she regretted it and Joey dumped her, so she vowed to never again do anything just <b>because</b> <b>everyone</b> else was doing it. Bianca insists that she can make her own choices, so Kat agrees to go to the prom with Patrick, and Bianca decides to go with Cameron instead of Joey.|$|E
500|$|Senna {{was given}} a state funeral in São Paulo, Brazil on 5 May 1994. Approximately 500,000 people lined the streets to watch the coffin pass. Senna's rival Alain Prost was among the pallbearers. The {{majority}} of the Formula One community attended Senna's funeral; however {{the president of the}} sport's governing body, the FIA, Max Mosley attended the funeral of Ratzenberger instead which took place on 7 May 1994 in Salzburg, Austria. Mosley said in a press conference ten years later, [...] "I went to his funeral <b>because</b> <b>everyone</b> went to Senna's. I thought it was important that somebody went to his." ...|$|E
5000|$|Since college, Mellencamp, {{with the}} {{exception}} of his continuing addiction to nicotine, has lived a drug and alcohol-free lifestyle. In 1984, when asked about his views on drugs, he told Bill Holdship of Creem magazine, [...] "If you want to stick needles in your arms, go ahead and fucking do it. You're the one that's going to pay the consequences. I don't think it's a good idea, and I sure don't advocate it, but I'm not going to judge people.

If England had been sure to win without my aid, I might have stood aloof. It is <b>because</b> <b>everyone's</b> help is needed that such services as I can render are due to her.

500|$|Producer John Lloyd, {{speaking}} to The Times in 1989 hinted {{that it was}} the draining scripting and rehearsal process that led to the writers deciding not to make another series: [...] "Things do get very tense by the end of a series, <b>because</b> <b>everyone</b> involved in the thing is very clever, and very funny, and they all want to push the scripts along. It's a very exhausting process, {{and by the end of}} it we all swear we'll never, ever, do another one. But then you start to think how rare it is to get so many good people in the same room and you talk yourself into doing another series." ...|$|E
500|$|The album's {{tentative}} title Sheep {{was something}} Cobain created as an inside joke directed towards {{the people he}} expected to buy the album. He wrote a fake advertisement for Sheep in his journal that read [...] "Because you want to not; <b>because</b> <b>everyone</b> else is." [...] Novoselic said {{the inspiration for the}} title was the band's cynicism about the public's reaction to Operation Desert Storm. As recording sessions for the album were completed, Cobain grew tired of the title and suggested to Novoselic that the new album be named Nevermind. Cobain liked the title because it was a metaphor for his attitude on life and because it was grammatically incorrect.|$|E
500|$|According to Pelé, indoor {{football}} presented difficult challenges; {{he said it}} was a lot {{quicker than}} football on the grass and that players were required to think faster <b>because</b> <b>everyone</b> is close to each other in the pitch. Pelé accredits indoor football for helping him think better on the spot. In addition, indoor football allowed him to play with adults when he was about 14-years-old. In one of the tournaments he participated, he was initially considered too young to play, but eventually went on to end up top scorer with fourteen or fifteen goals. [...] "That gave me a lot of confidence", Pelé said, [...] "I knew then not to be afraid of whatever might come".|$|E
5000|$|Randy Alcorn {{says that}} [...] "In heaven {{there will be}} no evil desires or corruption." [...] Thus, <b>because</b> <b>everyone's</b> [...] "human nature is deficient," [...] no one can go to heaven {{immediately}} after death.

500|$|Beginning in 1996, Warren {{served as}} the island's only police officer. However, since {{no one had been}} arrested on the island since the 1950s, her duties {{involved}} issuing driving licenses and stamping visitors' passports. Warren had no qualifications or formal training to be a police officer, and was given the job <b>because</b> <b>everyone</b> on the island had a [...] "job". [...] The island's jail was described as [...] "the size of a garden shed and riddled with termites," [...] and its cells had been used to store building materials and lifejackets. When the island came into the international spotlight due to a sexual abuse scandal, a law enforcement professional sent to the island criticized their practices, stating [...] "It was glaringly obvious...that their standard of policing was not really adequate." ...|$|E
500|$|Renwick {{decided to}} use the {{flashback}} structure for several reasons. He felt that the episode should be about [...] "life After Victor, which I think will be more interesting and not the route people are expecting you to take." [...] He realised that most viewers would have been aware of Victor's death because of the press coverage; there would be little point in having the death be the climax of the episode <b>because</b> <b>everyone</b> already knew the outcome. However, the focus would be upon Victor's death rather than the details of the accident. Renwick's decision to kill Victor in a road accident was fuelled by the writer's concerns about reckless driving. Also, the suddenness of an accident, as opposed to death by illness, would not negate the comic tone {{of the rest of the}} episode. The twist that the person responsible for Victor's death is Margaret's new best friend was designed to add some complexity to the show.|$|E
500|$|Ultimate Play the Game, {{represented}} by its co-founding brothers, Tim and Chris Stamper, was uncommonly taciturn {{in matters of}} press and marketing, though they provided some details on Knight Lore development to Crash magazine. While Knight Lore was released as the third game in the Sabreman series, the Stamper brothers had finished it first. They withheld the game {{for about a year}} for market reasons: they thought that Knight Lore advancements—copyrighted as the Filmation engine—would hurt sales of their upcoming Sabre Wulf, and used the extra time to prepare another Filmation game (Alien 8) to preempt the sales that would be lost when other publishers would try to copy the technique. [...] "We just had to sit on it <b>because</b> <b>everyone</b> else was so far behind," [...] Tim Stamper recalled. Sabre Wulf was released to commercial and critical success in 1984. Alien 8 and the next two Sabreman titles—Underwurlde and Knight Lore—followed in close succession {{before the end of the}} year.|$|E
5000|$|Regarding the track, [...] "For One Night Only", Anderson stated: [...] "It was {{originally}} called [...] "Fighting and Shagging". I {{found that one}} really hard to write. I knew we needed this upbeat, going-out song, but I can't do that. ... I'm sure people go out a lot more now than they used to. Even my gran's generation, they'd have a sherry at New Year {{and that would be}} it. So I was thinking, big nights out must have been few and far between, and when you did go out, there would be no holding back. If your drunk character - <b>because</b> <b>everyone's</b> got one - could only come out once a year, it would be hugely exaggerated." ...|$|R
