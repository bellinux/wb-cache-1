In 1739, local gardener Thomas Huddle began to build property on the north side. John Rocque's Map of London, published in 1746, shows urban buildings as far as North Audley Street, but only intermittent rural property thereafter. Buildings <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> erected {{on the corner of}} Oxford Street and Davies Street in the 1750s. Further development along the street occurred between 1763 and 1793. The Pantheon, a place for public entertainment, opened at No.173 in 1772.|$|E

5|$|After this tournament, the gambit finally <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> taken seriously. Top {{players like}} Savielly Tartakower and Siegbert Tarrasch {{started to play}} it. Schlechter {{published}} in 1918 the monograph Die budapester Verteidigung des Damengambits, which can be considered the first book on this opening. The gambit reached its peak of popularity (around five Budapest Gambits for every thousand games played) around 1920, {{so much so that}} many White players adopted the move-order 1.d4 Nf6 2.Nf3 to avoid it.|$|E

5|$|At {{the same}} time, {{powerful}} and influential nobles <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> buried with the royal family; {{the most famous}} of these tombs is the joint tomb of Yuya and Tjuyu, KV46.

5|$|Banking also {{developed}} in this period. The Bank of Scotland was suspected of Jacobite sympathies {{and so a}} rival Royal Bank of Scotland was founded in 1727.
