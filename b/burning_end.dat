25|$|Passive smoking: Passive {{smoking is}} the usually {{involuntary}} consumption of smoked tobacco. Second-hand smoke (SHS) is the consumption where the <b>burning</b> <b>end</b> is present, {{environmental tobacco smoke}} (ETS) or third-hand smoke is the consumption of the smoke that remains after the <b>burning</b> <b>end</b> has been extinguished. Because of its perceived negative implications, this form of consumption has {{played a central role}} in the regulation of tobacco products.|$|E
25|$|Second-hand {{smoke is}} a mixture of smoke from the <b>burning</b> <b>end</b> of a cigarette, pipe or cigar, and the smoke exhaled from the lungs of smokers. It is involuntarily inhaled, lingers in the air hours after {{cigarettes}} have been extinguished, and may cause a wide range of adverse health effects, including cancer, respiratory infections and asthma. Non-smokers who are exposed to second-hand smoke at home or work are thought, due {{to a wide variety of}} statistical studies, to increase their heart disease risk by 25–30% and their lung cancer risk by 20–30%. Second-hand smoke has been estimated to cause 38,000 deaths per year, of which 3,400 are deaths from lung cancer in non-smokers.|$|E

60|$|Camp Fires.--Large Logs.--The {{principle}} of making large logs to burn brightly, {{is to allow}} air to reach them on all sides, and yet to place them so closely together, that each supports the combustion of the rest. A common plan {{is to make the}} fire with three logs, whose ends cross each other, as in the diagram. The dots represent the extent of the fire. As the ends burn away, the logs are pushed closer together. Another plan is to lay the logs parallel with the <b>burning</b> <b>ends</b> to the windward, then they continue burning together.|$|R
5000|$|The {{misconception}} of 56Fe's high {{nuclear binding}} energy probably originated from astrophysics. During nucleosynthesis in stars {{the competition between}} photodisintegration and alpha capturing causes more 56Ni to be produced than 62Ni (56Fe is produced later in the star's ejection shell as 56Ni decays). The 56Ni is the natural end product of silicon-burning {{at the end of}} a supernova's life and is the product of 14 alpha captures in the alpha process which builds more massive elements in steps of 4 nucleons, from carbon. This alpha process in supernovae <b>burning</b> <b>ends</b> here because of the higher energy of zinc-60, which would be produced in the next step, after addition of another [...] "alpha" [...] (or more properly termed, helium nucleus).|$|R

60|$|Slone {{lay in the}} shade, {{his head}} propped on his saddle, and while gazing down into the shimmering hollow he began to plan. He {{calculated}} {{that he must be}} able to carry fire swiftly across {{the far end of the}} basin, so that he would not be absent long from the mouth of the pass. Fire was always a difficult matter, since he must depend only on flint and steel. He decided to wait till dark, build a fire with dead cedar sticks, and carry a bundle of them with <b>burning</b> <b>ends.</b> He felt assured that the wind caused by riding would keep them burning. After he had lighted the grass all he had to do was to hurry back to his station and there await developments.|$|R
50|$|Historically, lemurs ranged {{across the}} entire island inhabiting {{a wide variety of}} habitats, {{including}} dry deciduous forests, lowland forests, spiny thickets, subhumid forests, montane forest, and mangrove. Today, their collective range is restricted to 10% of the island, or approximately 60000 km2. Most of the remaining forests and lemurs are found along the periphery of the island. The center of the island, the Hauts-Plateaux, was converted by early settlers to rice paddies and grassland through slash-and-burn agriculture, known locally as tavy. As erosion depleted the soil, the cyclical forest regrowth and <b>burning</b> <b>ended</b> as the forest gradually failed to return. Today, the level of floral diversity increases with precipitation, from the dry southern forests to the wetter northern forests to the rainforests along the east coast. Increased foliage corresponds to increased faunal diversity, including the diversity and complexity of lemur communities.|$|R
60|$|But as it chanced, Vrouw Prinsloo {{was close}} at hand. Seizing a flaming bough from the fire, that intrepid woman ran at the lion and, as it opened its huge mouth to roar or bite, thrust the <b>burning</b> <b>end</b> of the bough into its throat. The lion closed its jaws upon it, then finding the mouthful not to its taste, {{departed}} even {{more quickly than}} it had come, uttering the most dreadful noises, and leaving Marie quite unhurt. Needless to say, after this I really worshipped the Vrouw Prinsloo, though she, good soul, thought nothing of the business, which {{in those days was}} but a common incident of travel.|$|E
60|$|This {{then was}} his last opportunity. He rolled himself to the fire, and with his teeth seized {{the end of one}} of the burning sticks. He raised himself into a sitting position, and with the {{greatest}} difficulty laid the <b>burning</b> <b>end</b> of the stick across the cords which bound his wrists. It seemed to him that they would never catch fire. The flesh scorched and frizzled, and the smoke rose up with that of the burning rope. The agony was intense, but it was for life, and Malcolm unflinchingly held the burning brand in its place until the cords flew asunder and his hands were free. Although almost mad with the pain, Malcolm set to work instantly to undo the other ropes. As soon as one of his arms was free he seized a hatchet, which lay near him, and rapidly cut the rest. He was not a moment too soon, for as he cut the last knot he heard the sound of steps, and two women appeared at the door.|$|E

50|$|As core {{hydrogen}} burning progresses, a very {{massive star}} would slowly expand {{and become more}} luminous, becoming a blue hypergiant and eventually an LBV while still fusing hydrogen in the core. When hydrogen at the core is depleted after 2-2.5 million years, hydrogen shell burning continues with further increases in size and luminosity, although hydrogen shell burning in chemically homogeneous stars may be very brief or absent since the entire star would become depleted of hydrogen. In the late stages of hydrogen burning, mass loss is extremely high due to the high luminosity and enhanced surface abundances of helium and nitrogen. As hydrogen <b>burning</b> <b>ends</b> and core helium burning begins, massive stars transition very rapidly to the Wolf-Rayet stage {{with little or no}} hydrogen, increased temperatures, and decreased luminosity. They are likely to have lost over half their initial mass at this point.|$|R

50|$|The final {{comic opera}} touch to the woes of the Union fleet was a mistaken signal {{in the last}} phase of the gun battle. Captain Handy of the Vincennes chose to misread a signal the Richmond made to the vessels outside the bar to “Get Underway”. Handy ordered the {{engineer}} to set and light a fuse to the magazine of the Vincennes to blow her up, then ordering the crew to abandon ship, reported to the Richmond. Captain Pope on the Richmond was confronted with the unlikely spectacle of an officer even more timid and panicky than himself. Fortunately for the Union, the engineer of the Vincennes lit the fuse to the magazine as ordered, then cut off the <b>burning</b> <b>end</b> of the fuse and threw it overboard. Since no explosion was forthcoming, Handy and crew were ordered back to their ship by the disgusted Captain Pope.|$|E
5000|$|The {{first attempt}} to make the process of firing a small arm easier was the [...] "matchlock". The matchlock {{incorporated}} a [...] "lock" [...] (so called because of its resemblance to door locks of the day) that was actuated by a trigger, originally called a [...] "tricker." [...] The lock was a simple lever which pivoted when pulled, and lowered the match down to the touchhole. The match was a slow burning fuse made of plant fibers that were soaked in a solution of nitrates, charcoal, and sulfur, and dried. This [...] "slow-match" [...] was ignited before the gun was needed, and it would slowly burn, keeping a hot ember at the <b>burning</b> <b>end.</b> After the gun was loaded and the touchhole primed with powder, the burning tip of the match was positioned so that the lock would bring it {{into contact with the}} touchhole. To fire the gun, it was aimed and the trigger pulled. This brought the match down to the touchhole, igniting the powder. With careful attention the slow-burning match could be kept burning for long periods of time, {{and the use of the}} lock mechanism made fairly accurate fire possible.|$|E
