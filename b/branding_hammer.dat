5000|$|The Arm & <b>Hammer</b> <b>brand</b> is a {{registered}} trademark of Church & Dwight, an American manufacturer of household products.

50|$|Arm & Hammer is a {{registered}} trademark of Church & Dwight, an American manufacturer of household products. The logo of this brand is a depiction of a muscular arm holding a hammer inside a red circle. Originally associated only with baking soda and washing soda, the company began to expand the brand to other products in the 1970s, using baking soda as a deodorizing ingredient, including toothpaste, laundry detergent, underarm deodorant, and cat litter. The Arm & <b>Hammer</b> <b>brand</b> {{is one of the}} longest-running and most recognized U.S. trademarks.|$|R
50|$|The two firms joined back {{together}} again in 1896 and became Church and Dwight Company. The Cow Brand and Arm & <b>Hammer</b> <b>Brand</b> were seen by the public as one and the same, so both logos were often used after the merger. One example was where they gave away recipe books with both trademarks on the cover. This new company was for fifty years {{one of the most}} well known grocery store supply vendors in the United States. Dwight was the first president of Church and Dwight Company and continued that position until his death in 1903.|$|R
5000|$|In 1996, Faball Enterprises {{licensed}} the Hammer {{product name}} to Faball USA. This company maintained {{the brand name}} since that time until its acquisition by Ebonite International on February 8, 2002. Faball Enterprises was formed in 1978 by Johnny Wonders and Earl Widman. In 1981, they created the second urethane ball {{in the market and}} Hammer was born. Hammer was the first to put a logo {{on the side of the}} ball. After a PBA player was featured in a tournament telecast using the ball with its visible claw hammer logo, sales exploded. The <b>Hammer</b> <b>brand</b> was also the first to produce a urethane two-piece ball.|$|R
5000|$|During the {{recording}} of The Volta Regime album in 2009, a young potential rapper named Sarkodie approached Hammer for a recording deal. After auditioning, <b>Hammer</b> <b>branded</b> Sarkodie as a rap encyclopedia due to the various styles he could conjure on impulse. He then tagged Sarkodie as a special case and encouraged him to master one particular style of his which was tongue twisting. This artist also proved himself {{to be the only}} local rapper with the ability to freestyle off the head with intelligent rhymes mixed with logic. Hammer did not want to waste time on Sarkodie so he quickly signed him for a five-year contract and created spaces on two of Ayigbe Edem’s songs (u dey craze and give it up) to introduce him before {{the recording}} of his debut album. However, after the release of Ayigbe Edem’s album, Sarkodie’s demand soared and the promotion of Ayigbe Edem’s album seemed to conflict with the timing of {{the recording of}} Sarkodie’s album. This resulted in a dispute that could have delayed Sarkodie’s recording. Hammer later agreed to let Sarkodie go as he wanted to focus all attention on Edem at the time. Sarkodie moved on to win the Artiste of the year 2010 at the 2010 Ghana Music Awards with his debut. Relationship between Hammer and Sarkodie was never affected by this as Sarkodie went on to name his album ‘makye’ which was given to him by Hammer upon their first meeting. Their latest project [...] "Saa Okodie No", which was produced by hammer was recently aired on 106 & Park and contributed to Sarkodie's nomination at the recent BET Awards 2012 where he won the Best International Act.|$|R
