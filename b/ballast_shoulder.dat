The <b>ballast</b> <b>shoulder</b> always should be at least 150 mm wide, and may be as wide as 450 mm.The shape of the ballast is also important. Stones must be irregularly cut, with sharp edges, so that they properly interlock and grip the ties in order to fully secure them against movement; spherical stones cannot do this. In order to let the stones fully settle and interlock, speed limits are often lowered on sections of track {{for a period of time}} after new ballast has been laid.|$|E
50|$|Many {{conditions}} {{affect the}} stability of track when under thermal forces.

30|$|To {{reduce the}} {{computational}} {{costs in the}} 3 D idealization, {{only half of the}} structure was modeled, which takes advantage of the symmetry of the railway cross section and loading pattern. Considering the assumed depth of the soil cover (1.5 m of covering material including the ballast and embankment layers) and a slope of 1 vertically to 1.5 horizontally of the <b>ballast</b> <b>shoulders,</b> the longitudinal dimension of each bridge was modeled. The 3 D mesh was created using railway cross-sectional segments along the longitudinal axis of each structure.|$|R
2500|$|It is {{not always}} {{necessary}} to replace the ballast if it is fouled, nor must all the ballast be removed {{if it is to}} be cleaned. Removing and cleaning the <b>ballast</b> from the <b>shoulder</b> is often sufficient, if <b>shoulder</b> <b>ballast</b> is removed to the correct depth. While this job was historically done by manual labour, this process is now, like many other railway maintenance tasks, a mechanised one, with a chain of specially-designed railroad cars handling the task. One wagon cuts the ballast and passes it via a conveyor belt to a cleaning machine, then the cleaning wagon washes the ballast, and deposits the dirt and ballast into other wagons for disposal and re-use, respectively. Such machines can clean up to [...] of ballast in an hour.|$|R

50|$|A {{special case}} is heat related buckling: {{in hot weather}} the rail steel expands. This is managed by {{stressing}} continuously welded rails (they are tensioned mechanically to be stress neutral at a moderate temperature) and by providing proper expansion gaps at joints and ensuring that fishplates are properly lubricated. In addition, lateral restraint is provided by an adequate <b>ballast</b> <b>shoulder.</b> If any of these measures are inadequate, the track may buckle; a large lateral distortion takes place, which trains are unable to negotiate. (In nine years 2000/1 to 2008/9 there were 429 track buckle incidents in Great Britain).|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} model tests used {{to investigate}} how <b>ballast</b> <b>shoulder</b> width and height {{contribute to a}} railway sleeper’s resistance to lateral movement {{for a range of}} shoulder widths and heights. Deflection and resistance were measured and photographs taken during the tests. The photographs were analyzed using a digital image correlation technique to identify the zones of ballast surface disturbance, which demonstrated that a bulbed failure volume was mobilized at the ultimate limit state. An idealized three-dimensional failure mechanism is proposed, and resistances are calculated using the limit equilibrium approach. The calculation provides a reliable estimate of the measured resistance. The work identifies the optimum shoulder width and height. The calculations are extended to demonstrate that when a number of sleepers are moved simultaneously, the sleeper end resistance may be one-third less per sleeper than that indicated in tests on an isolated sleeper. Image analysis and limit equilibrium calculations show that this is caused by overlapping of mobilized failure volumes from adjacent sleepers...|$|E

40|$|The {{increasing}} demand for fast and economical transportation systems sets railways {{as one of}} the most important transportation modes. In addition due to technological advances new trains are increasingly fast. This fact requires an improvement to the construction as well as to maintenance operations of railway systems. Knowledge of applying geophysical sensor techniques on pavements was transferred to railways by taking advantage of the ability of ground penetrating radar to map substructure conditions on a continuous non-destructive basis. The study examines pilot sections, which are integrated in the National Railway System of Greece and are representative of the Greek Railways regarding structural and operational elements. For the present study a Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) system as well as the Videocar of the National Technical University of Athens have been used. The GPR system consists of an air-coupled 1 GHz frequency antenna and a ground coupled 400 MHz antenna. Data was acquired between concrete and wood ties as well as from the <b>ballast</b> <b>shoulders</b> beyond the ends of the ties, using the two antennas with multiple antenna orientations and polarizations. Automatic processing of the data was developed to quickly generate hard copy sections of radar images. Substructure conditions were observed such as thickness of the ballast and sub ballast layers, variations in layer thickness along the track, pockets of water trapped in the ballast, and soft subgrades from high water content. In addition, locations and depths of subsurface drainage pipes, trenches, and utilities were quickly and continuously mapped. In addition to in-situ measurements a Global Position System (GPS) was used in order to record exact coordinates of the sections under study. © 2007 Taylor & Francis Group, London...|$|R
40|$|The sleeper {{to ballast}} {{interface}} plays {{a crucial role}} in the stability of ballasted railway track, transferring both vertical and lateral loads safely from the superstructure to the sub-base. However, current conceptual models for the behaviour of the interface are incomplete and too simplistic to assess the response of the track system to the loads exerted by modern trains. For example, the increased curving speeds associated with tilting trains introduce potentially significant combinations of vertical, horizontal and moment loading which are not explicitly considered in current assessment procedures. Also, the relative contributions of the base, crib and <b>shoulder</b> <b>ballast</b> to lateral sliding resistance are at present poorly quantified. The behaviour of the sleeper to ballast interface was investigated in a series of tests in an apparatus capable of applying combinations of load representative of real trains. This article presents test data quantifying the relative contributions to total sliding resistance of the base, crib and shoulder. New calculations are presented, which enable the resistance from the crib and various sizes of <b>shoulder</b> <b>ballast</b> to be quantified. The results of the experiments and calculations are compared with each other wnd with the literature, and reasonably consistent patterns of behaviour are identifie...|$|R
40|$|Maintenance and {{eventual}} renewal of ballasted track constitute major operational costs for a railway network. Thus significant benefits would accrue {{from a more}} robust track design having a longer service life and reduced maintenance requirements. This paper presents results from a laboratory study exploring the potential to achieve this through improving the ballast grading and reducing the <b>ballast</b> <b>shoulder</b> slope. Cyclic loading tests were carried out on a section of track representing one sleeper bay in plane strain, in the Southampton Railway testing Facility (SRTF). A cyclic load representing a 20 tonne axle load was applied at 3 Hz for at least 3 million cycles, during which measurements of permanent and resilient vertical deflection were made. Certain interventions are found to result in lower rates of permanent settlement and different resilient ranges of movement. Supplementary measurements to determine longitudinal pressure, ballast breakage and attrition, and shoulder slope movement were used to explore the mechanisms responsible for the observed improvements in ballast bed performance. It is concluded {{that the use of}} finer ballast gradings and a shallower shoulder slope have the potential to reduce maintenance requirements...|$|E
40|$|In service, railway tracks must {{withstand}} transverse and longitudinal forces {{arising from}} running vehicles and thermal loads. The mechanical design adopting {{any of the}} track models available in the technical literature requires that {{the strength of the}} track is fully characterized. In this paper, the results of an experimental research activity on the sleeper-ballast resistance along the lateral and the longitudinal directions are reported and discussed. In particular, the work is aimed at identifying the strength contributions offered by the base, the ballast between the sleepers, and the <b>ballast</b> <b>shoulder</b> to the global resistance of the track in the horizontal plane. These latter quantities were experimentally determined by means of an ad hoc system designed by the authors. Field tests were carried out on a series of track sections that were built to simulate scenarios in which the ballast was removed from the crib and/or the shoulder. The results of this study indicate that, as far as the scenarios here investigated are concerned, the strength percent contributions from the crib, the sleeper base and the shoulder are respectively equal to about 50 %, 25 %, and 25 % in the lateral direction, and 60 %, 30 %, and 10 % in the longitudinal one. Moreover, the comparison of the acquired data with literature results reveals that a detailed knowledge both of the testing conditions and the activated ballast failure mechanisms are needed in order to correctly use test data for design purpose...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the effect of}} vehicle dynamics on lateral deterioration of the track alignment. As rail traffic runs along a route, the forces imposed upon the track cause the ballast to settle, and hence the track geometry deteriorates. At a specified value of deterioration the track geometry needs to be restored by tamping or other methods. As the deterioration is mainly in the vertical direction, this aspect has been more widely studied and models {{have been developed to}} predict vertical track geometry deterioration. On the other hand, lateral track deterioration is not as well understood, and this thesis aims to fill the gap in this knowledge. However, the understanding of the lateral deterioration mechanisms becomes more important as speed and capacity increase. This thesis describes statistical studies of track lateral deterioration, as well as the development and validation of a vehicle-track lateral dynamic interaction model. This work is undertaken to contribute to the fundamental understanding of the mechanisms of track lateral deterioration, therefore making the effective control and reduction of the lateral deterioration achievable. The statistical analysis provides a better understanding of three aspects of track lateral irregularities, namely: the relationship between vertical and lateral irregularities, the relationship between track curvature and track lateral irregularity and the change in track lateral deterioration over time. The vertical and lateral track irregularity magnitudes are clearly correlated. The track quality in the vertical direction is generally worse than in the lateral direction, however the number of track sections with lateral quality significantly worse than the vertical is non-negligible. The lateral irregularities tend to be larger on curves. It is notable that less than ten percent of the track studied has a constant lateral deterioration due to frequent maintenance activities and bidirectional lateral dynamic forces. Unlike vertical settlement, lateral deterioration develops exponentially in both magnitude and wavelength, and the major influences are found from the irregularities with wavelength longer than 10 m. The change in track lateral irregularity with different curve radii and the lateral deterioration rate are described in separate exponential power functions due to the limitation of the available track data. The parameters for these empirical equations do not remain constant due to the change in track conditions. Current track lateral models mainly focus on lateral failures such as buckling and lateral sliding. The development of lateral track irregularities tends to be studied using representative values of net lateral forces and net L/V (Lateral/Vertical) load ratios. Unlike other track lateral deterioration models, the model developed in this thesis focuses on the development of lateral irregularities based on the dynamic interactions between the vehicles and the track system. This model makes it possible to carry out more integrations and analysis of the track lateral deterioration in a realistic dynamic simulation, using vehicle models, contact conditions, track initial irregularities, and traffic mix more close to the reality. The vehicle-track lateral dynamic interaction model was validated against track geometry data measured on the West Coast Mainline (WCML) in England. It has been found that the model gives a reasonably accurate prediction of the development of lateral track irregularities. However, it also tends to predict a short wavelength deterioration that is not seen in the actual track deterioration. Improvements to the model are suggested by either adding more factors or simplifying the model depending on specific target application. Enhancing the model by including more details, such as longitudinal forces, temperature effect, more layered track systems, uneven track bed conditions and more representative wheel-rail contact conditions etc., may help understand the reason of the additional short wavelength. A sensitivity analysis was performed in order to identify the critical factors that influence lateral track deterioration. The track damage caused by specific vehicles can be controlled by understanding different vehicle dynamics behaviour on a particular track section or route. Vehicles with simple suspension design and heavy axle loads tend to cause more lateral track damage. Within a certain speed range, there will be a critical speed that generates the largest lateral deterioration. Vehicles with different dynamic behaviours can generate a potential offset of the lateral deterioration, so it is possible to design the traffic mix to cancel out the peak deterioration. However, it may not be very practical to redesign the traffic mix due to different traffic requirements. Subsequently, actions can be taken to effectively reduce track lateral deterioration, such as optimise the suspension design, vehicle weight, the selection of an optimal operation speed, and enhance the traffic mix design. As the most important interface between vehicle and track, the wheel-rail contact condition has an extremely large influence on lateral deterioration. Wheel and rail profiles with different wear conditions can cause altered vehicle-track lateral dynamic interaction. It is found that increasingly worn wheel/rail profiles within an acceptable tolerance can effectively reduce the lateral deterioration. Lateral deterioration can also be reduced by increasing all the track stiffness values, damping values and the mass of rails and sleepers, or alternatively, by decreasing the sleeper spacing. The sleeper-ballast interface is found to play the most important role in lateral deterioration. The interfaces between the sleeper and <b>ballast</b> <b>shoulder,</b> crib and base determines the non-linear characteristic such as hysteresis and sliding features. Improving the strength of the sleeper-ballast interface can improve the elastic limits and hysteresis characteristics, hence reducing the lateral deterioration. The findings of the investigation indicate that the model provides in-depth knowledge of the mechanisms influencing lateral deterioration and provides effective solutions with consideration of vehicles, wheel-rail contact and the track system. Further work would include track data with sufficient information in order to develop a more comprehensive empirical model that describes the lateral deterioration, inclusion of more potentially influential factors such as: temperature, ground condition, traffic etc. The model can be improved by taking into account additional factors such as the influence of longitudinal forces from the wheels to the rails, different weather and temperatures, subgrade and ground conditions, etc. The reason for the high frequency noise in the deterioration prediction is not understood yet and it should be discussed in terms of more accurate vehicle simulation results and more comprehensive rail and wheel worn profiles measured on the target track and vehicles. Furthermore, the sleeper-ballast lateral characteristics are not well understood and the previous research in this area is quite limited. To improve on the present work {{it would be useful to}} carry out laboratory tests in order to capture more accurately track lateral stiffness and damping values as well as the comprehensive non-linear characteristic of track lateral residual resistance behaviour...|$|E

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to develop a fuller understanding of the mechanical behaviour of the sleeper/ballast interface, related in particular, to the forces applied by high speed tilting trains on low radius curves. The research has used literature review, field measurements, and laboratory experiments on a single sleeper bay of track. Theoretical calculations are also presented. Field measurements are carried out using geophones to record time/deflection for sleepers during passage of Pendolino trains on the West Coast Main Line. Calculations are presented to quantify normal and extreme magnitudes of vertical, horizontal and moment (VHM) loads on individual sleepers. Results from laboratory experiments, on the pre-failure behaviour of the sleeper to ballast base contact area, show that lateral load/deflection behaviour is load path dependent and relations are determined for improved computer modelling of the sleeper/ballast interface. Further test results are used to establish the failure envelopes for combined VHM loading of the sleeper/ballast base contact area. Tests show that the sleeper/ballast base resistance at failure occurs at a load ratio (H/V) of about 0. 45 (24 °) at 2 mm of displacement tending to 0. 57 (30 °) at greater displacements. In addition, measurements from pressure plates within the testing apparatus are used to describe the development of confining stress within the ballast during 100 cycles of vertical load. The development of confining stress is assessed with reference to a finite element model of the laboratory apparatus and it is shown that the earth pressure ratio moves towards the active condition for peak load and the passive condition at minimum load per cycle. The contribution to lateral resistance of the crib ballast and varying sizes of <b>shoulder</b> <b>ballast</b> is also established and it is found that the shoulder and crib resistance can best be characterised by taking the mean resistance over a range of deflection from 2 mm to 20 mm. Calculations are presented, supported by the experimental data, to quantify the resistance from different sizes of <b>shoulder</b> <b>ballast</b> and a chart is presented which can be used as the basis for shoulder specification in practice.

40|$|Railway ballast is an unbound {{granular}} medium which undergoes non-uniform lateral spread when {{subjected to}} high-frequency cyclic loading. In order {{to simulate the}} lateral spread of ballast upon loading, a modified large-scale process simulation test (PST) apparatus with five independent movable plates of equal height forming {{one of the side}} walls has been built at University of Wollongong, Australia. However, the experiments alone cannot provide a comprehensive study of the lateral flow of ballast in a micro-mechanical perspective. The discrete element method (DEM) has therefore been used to complement the modified large-scale PST apparatus and to provide much needed micro-mechanical insight to the lateral flow of aggregate particles, such as the contact force distribution, particle movement and porosity change. The simulation results provided acceptable predictions of the trend of vertical and lateral displacements of two-ball clump assembly upon loading. In addition, these simulations evaluate the effect of confining pressures (10 - 30 kPa) due to the crib and <b>shoulder</b> <b>ballast,</b> on vertical settlement and the lateral spread of ballast under high frequency cyclic load. The vertical stress decreases significantly with depth from an applied vertical stress of 460 kPa at the sleeper-ballast interface to 210 kPa at the base wall (ballast-subballast interface), which is in agreement with the experimental results.
