5000|$|McLoughlin Bros., Inc. was a New York {{publishing}} firm active between 1828 and 1920. The {{company was}} a pioneer in color printing technologies in children's books. [...] The company specialized in retellings or bowdlerizations of classic stories for children. The artistic and commercial roots of the McLoughlin firm were first developed by John McLoughlin, Jr. (1827-1905) who made his younger brother Edmund McLoughlin (1833 or 4-1889) a partner in 1855. By 1886, the firm published {{a wide range of}} items, including cheap chapbooks, large folio picture <b>books,</b> <b>linen</b> <b>books,</b> puzzles, games, paper soldiers and paper dolls. Many of the earliest and most valuable board games in America were produced by McLoughlin Brothers of New York. In 1920 the corporation was sold to Milton Bradley & Company. McLoughlin ceased game production at this time, but continued publishing their picture books.|$|R

6000|$|On August 9, 1683, Walton {{wrote his}} will, 'in the neintyeth {{year of my}} age, and in perfect memory, for which praised be God.' He professes the Anglican faith, despite 'a very long and very trew {{friendship}} {{for some of the}} Roman Church.' His worldly estate he has acquired 'neither by falsehood or flattery or the extreme crewelty of the law of this nation.' His property was in two houses in London, the lease of Norington farm, a farm near Stafford, besides <b>books,</b> <b>linen,</b> and a hanging cabinet inscribed with his name, now, it seems, in the possession of Mr. Elkin Mathews. A bequest is made of money for coals to the poor of Stafford, 'every last weike in Janewary, or in every first weike in Febrewary; I say then, because I take that time to be the hardest and most pinching times with pore people.' To the Bishop of Winchester he bequeathed a ring with the posy, 'A Mite for a Million.' There are other bequests, including ten pounds to 'my old friend, Mr. Richard Marriott,' Walton's bookseller. This good man died in peace with his publisher, leaving him also a ring. A ring was left to a lady of the Portsmouth family, 'Mrs. Doro. Wallop.' ...|$|R

50|$|Joseph Ades, the {{youngest}} of seven children, was born in Manchester, England, where his father worked in the textile industry. Leaving school at 15, he became an office boy before becoming intrigued by the local markets that would spring-up in the World War II-devastated landscapes of Northern England. He started out hawking comic <b>books</b> before selling <b>linens,</b> textiles, jewelry, and toys directly on the streets.|$|R
50|$|Win Ng's {{whimsical}} {{designs and}} animal drawings became a thematic {{focal point for}} many extremely popular Taylor & Ng products, from coffee mugs to kitchen aprons, pot holders, and dishtowels.

60|$|At {{last the}} day came, the {{carriage}} drove up, the little humble packets containing tokens {{of love and}} remembrance were ready and disposed in the hall long since--George was in his new suit, for which the tailor had come previously to measure him. He had sprung up with the sun {{and put on the}} new clothes, his mother hearing him from the room close by, in which she had been lying, in speechless grief and watching. Days before she had been making preparations for the end, purchasing little stores for the boy's use, marking his <b>books</b> and <b>linen,</b> talking with him and preparing him for the change--fondly fancying that he needed preparation.|$|R
5000|$|The Liber Linteus Zagrabiensis (Latin for [...] "Linen Book of Zagreb", also rarely {{known as}} Liber Agramensis, [...] "Book of Agram") {{is the longest}} Etruscan text and the only extant <b>linen</b> <b>book,</b> dated to the 3rd century BCE. It remains mostly untranslated {{because of the lack}} of {{knowledge}} about the Etruscan language, though the few words which can be understood indicate that the text is most likely a ritual calendar.|$|R
50|$|In July 1960 the auctioneers erected an {{enormous}} marquee {{on the terrace}} lawn outside {{of the front door}} of Isel Hall, overlooking the River Derwent. The three-day sale, comprising 1,071 lots, filled 30 pages of the sale catalogue. There were 20 lots of metal ware, 37 of plated ware, 109 of silver, 264 of furniture, 34 of carpets and rugs, 66 of china and glass, and many more of paintings, curtains, <b>books</b> and <b>linen.</b> One may gain an understanding of the work of the linen maids in the great country houses by studying the content of the catalogue. Almost 300 lots of linen came under the hammer, including 31 tablecloths, 60 linen sheets, 90 table napkins, and over 200 towels.|$|R
60|$|Nevertheless, {{thanks to}} the editors, such at last became the popular {{literary}} enthusiasm in behalf of Pierre, that two young men, recently abandoning the ignoble pursuit of tailoring for the more honorable trade of the publisher (probably with an economical view of working up in <b>books,</b> the <b>linen</b> and cotton shreds of the cutter's counter, after having been subjected to {{the action of the}} paper-mill), had on the daintiest scolloped-edged paper, and in the neatest possible, and fine-needle-work hand, addressed him a letter, couched in the following terms; the general style of which letter will sufficiently evince that, though--{{thanks to the}} manufacturer--their linen and cotton shreds may have been very completely transmuted into paper, yet the cutters themselves were not yet entirely out of the metamorphosing mill.|$|R
50|$|The Linen Rolls were records which, {{according}} to one recent theory, originated from notes jotted by officials on their linen clothing, allegedly contained antique lists of annual state officials, and perhaps included records about other matters also. The mysterious <b>Linen</b> <b>Books,</b> stated to have been preserved in the temple of Juno Moneta, need not be dismissed as sheer forgeries fabricated by Gaius Licinius Macer. Yet it is not very likely that {{they went back to}} the fourth century BC, as he believed they did; they may not have been {{more than a hundred years}} old.|$|R
60|$|His mother saw She {{was gone}} by his look {{when he came}} home. He was eager to fly too now, as were other folks round about Chatteris. Poor Smirke wanted to go away from {{the sight of the}} syren widow. Foker began to think he had had enough of Baymouth, and that a few supper-parties at Saint Boniface would not be unpleasant. And Major Pendennis longed to be off, and have a little pheasant-shooting at Stillbrook, and get rid of all {{annoyances}} and tracasseries of the village. The widow and Laura nervously set about the preparation for Pen's kit, and filled trunks with his <b>books</b> and <b>linen.</b> Helen wrote cards with the name of Arthur Pendennis, Esq., which were duly nailed on the boxes; and at which both she and Laura looked with tearful wistful eyes. It was not until long, long after he was gone, that Pen remembered how constant and tender the affection of these women had been, and how selfish his own conduct was.|$|R
6000|$|We must fancy {{that the}} parting between the {{brothers}} is over, that George {{has taken his}} place in Mr. Braddock's family, and Harry has returned home to Castlewood and his duty. His heart is with the army, and his pursuits at home offer the boy no pleasure. He does not care to own how deep his disappointment is, at being obliged to stay under the homely, quiet roof, now more melancholy than ever since George is away. Harry passes his brother's empty chamber with an averted face; takes George's place {{at the head of}} the table, and sighs as he drinks from his silver tankard. Madam Warrington calls the toast of [...] "The King" [...] stoutly every day; and, on Sundays, when Harry reads the service, and prays for all travellers by land and by water, she says, [...] "We beseech Thee to hear us," [...] with a peculiar solemnity. She insists on talking about George constantly, but quite cheerfully, and as if his return was certain. She walks into his vacant room, with head upright, and no outward signs of emotion. She sees that his <b>books,</b> <b>linen,</b> papers, etc., are arranged with care; talking of him with a very special respect, and specially appealing to the old servants at meals, and so forth, regarding things which are to be done [...] "when Mr. George comes home." [...] Mrs. Mountain is constantly on the whimper when George's name is mentioned, and Harry's face wears a look of the most ghastly alarm; but his mother's is invariably grave and sedate. She makes more blunders at piquet and backgammon than you would expect from her; and the servants find her awake and dressed, however early they may rise. She has prayed Mr. Dempster to come back into residence at Castlewood. She is not severe or haughty (as her wont certainly was) with any of the party, but quiet in her talk with them, and gentle in assertion and reply. She is for ever talking of her father and his campaigns, who came out of them all with no very severe wounds to hurt him; and so she hopes and trusts will her eldest son.|$|R

5000|$|Tiberianus {{also served}} as Praefectus Urbi of Rome from February 18, 291 to August 3, 292. The Historia Augusta relates an {{incident}} where the supposed writer of Aurelian’s biography had a discussion with Tiberianus, which has been traditionally dated to during his term as Urban Prefect:Junius Tiberianus, the prefect of the city, an illustrious man and one to be named only with a prefix of deep respect, took me up into his carriage, that is to say, his official coach. There his mind being now at leisure, relaxed and freed from law-pleas and public business, he engaged in much conversation {{all the way from}} the Palatine Hill to the Gardens of Varius, his theme being chiefly the lives of the emperors. And when we had reached the Temple of the Sun, consecrated by the Emperor Aurelian, he asked me who had written down the record of the life of that prince. When I replied that I had read none in Latin, though several in Greek, that revered man poured forth in the following words the sorrow that his groan implied: [...] "Shall the Deified Aurelian, that most famous of princes, that most firm of rulers, who restored the whole world to the sway of Rome, be unknown to posterity? God prevent such madness! And yet, if I am not mistaken, we possess the written journal of that great man and also his wars recorded in detail in the manner of a history, and these I should like you to procure and set forth in order, adding thereto all that pertains to his life. All these things you may learn in your zeal for research from the <b>linen</b> <b>books,</b> for he gave instructions that in these all that he did each day should be written down. I will arrange, moreover, that the Ulpian Library shall provide you with the <b>linen</b> <b>books</b> themselves. It would be my wish that you write a work on Aurelian, representing him, to the best of your ability, just as he really was." ...|$|R
40|$|The famous Zagreb Mummy, {{on whose}} linen wrappings the longest known Etruscan text called Liber linteus Zagrebiensis (“The <b>linen</b> <b>book</b> of Zagreb”) was written, {{came to the}} Archaeological museum Zagreb {{together}} with an Egyptian papyrus containing fragmental texts of The Book of the Dead. For almost 160 years experts {{have been trying to}} answer the questions of the relation of this Egyptian mummy to the Etruscan text. The Papyrus Zagreb 602 written in hieratic script is one of the important traces in this research. It is in good condition and many small fragments are almost impossible to put together, but the vignette with the names of two persons to whom it was dedicated is preserved. The text reveals that the priest of the god Khnum, the nobleman Perekh-Khons was buried together with his wife Nesi-Khons probably in Upper Egypt during the end of the Late or in the Ptolemaic period. The date generally fits to the C 14 dating of the mummy, but no other data taken from it points to the assumption that the mummy was the woman called Nesi-Khons...|$|R
50|$|The church also houses {{some items}} that were once used in St James’ church, which is located further down the Antrim Road towards Belfast city centre. About 30 years older than St Peter’s, St James’ is a very {{imposing}} building {{in the midst of}} the commercial heart of the Antrim Road, right beside Belfast Royal Academy. Unfortunately, the congregation dwindled rapidly from the onset of the Troubles in the 1970s as many Protestants moved out of this part of north Belfast in response to sectarian tensions in the area. Consequently, it was determined that St Peter's and St James should join together and share a Rector. Finally in 2007 the difficult decision was taken to close the church and deconsecrate the building as a place of Anglican worship. The church is now rented by an Orthodox community. The Eagle Lectern, a hymn <b>book</b> stand, a <b>linen</b> cupboard, several flower stands, hymn boards, and diocesan Sunday School banner, the Mothers' Union banner, two Holy Tables, and several other items of interest, were removed from St James and now furnish St Peter's. The north aisle, in which a Prayer Desk and 30 chairs from St James' are kept, was renamed the St James' Chapel in tribute to the former church. It is used for small congregations for non-sacramental services.|$|R
