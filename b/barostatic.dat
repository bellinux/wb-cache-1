In 16 healthy subjects, a bal-loon was inflated to 44 mmHg and then deflated to 0 mmHg in 4 -mmHg steps at 10, 30, and 60 ml/min, allowing volume fluctuations to stabilize at each pressure increment. There-after, these “quasi-static ” P-V curves were compared with “dynamic ” distensions to 300 ml, at 1 and 10 ml/s, before and after intravenous atropine in another five subjects. During quasi-static curves, balloon volume stabilized at each pres-sure increment. Quasi-static P-V curves were reproducible within individuals and approximated to a power exponential function and revealed hysteresis, indicative of viscoelasticity. Body mass index influenced quasi-static P-V curves durin...|$|E
40|$|For an {{adequate}} blood supply to support metabolic demands, vertebrates regulate blood pressure to maintain sufficient perfusion to avoid ischemia and other tissue damage like edema. Using a pharmacological approach (phenylephrine and sodium nitroprusside) we investigated baroreflex sensitivity at 15, 25, and 30 °C in toads Rhinella schneideri. Baroreflex sensitivity presented a high thermal dependence (Q 10 = 1. 9 – 4. 1), and the HR– baroreflex curve was shifted {{up and to}} the right as temperature increased from 15 to 30 °C. Baroreflex variables, namely, HR range, gain 50 (maximal gain) and normalized gain 50 increased 206, 235, and 160 % from 15 to 30 °C, respectively. The cardiac limb of the baroreflex response to pharmacological treatments was significantly blunted after full autonomic blockade. In addition, there was a clear baroreflex–HR response mainly to hypotension at all three temperatures tested. These findings indicate that toads present temperature dependence for cardiac limb of the <b>barostatic</b> response and the cardiac baroreflex response in R. schneideri is primarily hypotensive rather than hypertensive as well as crocodilians and mammals. Thus, the cardiac baroreflex compensation to changes in arterial pressure might present different patterns among amphibian species, since the previously reported bradycardic compensation to hypertension in some anurans was not observed in the toad used in the present study...|$|E
40|$|Background Nutrient-sensing {{studies in}} humans {{frequently}} use intragastric intubation. A non-invasive alternative {{would be the}} use of freeze-dried lipids (FDL) capsules. We proposed to validate this method in pigs by (i) demonstrating that low-dose FDL can increase vagal activity, gastric compliance (GC), and delay gastric emptying time (GET); (ii) evaluating the release kinetics of encapsulated FDL. Methods Nine conscious pigs fitted with duodenal catheter and gastric cannula were administered FDL (3 -mL freeze-dried Intralipid(®)). Vagal tone was estimated via heart rate variability (HRV) measurements, GC was measured via the <b>barostatic</b> method, and GET after a test meal was evaluated via scintigraphy. FDL vs placebo (methylcellulose [MC]) capsules release kinetics were also evaluated via scintigraphy. Key Results Duodenal FDL infusion increased GC in 2 / 8 trials only, but systematically delayed GET compared to saline (96  vs 70  min; p =  0. 018). The presence of FDL in the duodenum decreased heart rate, increased vagal tone, and HRV. FDL capsules released their content in the duodenum before MC capsules (41  vs 67  min; p =  0. 013), and MC induced ECG data quite similar to FDL except for HRV (p =  0. 011). Conclusions and Inferences Low-dose FDL was a potent signal to induce vagal reflex and increase GET. FDL capsules released their content in the duodenum and activated the vagal pathway after approximately 40  min, which is an important data for designing future paradigms in humans.

40|$|The baroreflex, or {{pressure}} reflex, is {{the primary}} mechanism in adult vertebrates for rapid regulation of arterial pressure through changes in heart rate and peripheral resistance. Such a mechanism is important for buffering fluctuations in arterial pressure, to maintain tissue perfusion pressure and, ultimately, to supply metabolic fuels to the end-organs (Van Vliet and West, 1994). While the functional significance of the baroreflex is clear in adult organisms, {{the importance of this}} reflex during embryonic or fetal development is less clarified. The two primary species used to study vertebrate cardiovascular development, sheep and chickens, both possess a functional baroreflex during fetal or embryonic life (Blanco et al., 1988; Segar, 1992; Altimiras and Crossley, 2000). This suggests that either the baroreflex is an important component of cardiovascular regulation during development or that it simply becomes functional in anticipation of its neonatal utility. Work in embryonic chickens suggests the latter, given that <b>barostatic</b> reflexes emerge very late in development and have a lower gain compared with those in adults (Altimiras and Crossley, 2000). By contrast, fetal sheep possess a baroreflex as early as 60 % of gestation, with a decrease in sensitivity and an increasing set point during development (Blanco et al., 1988; Segar, 1997; Segar et al., 1992). This apparent contradiction between a mammalian fetus and an avian embryo {{may be the result of}} differing gestational conditions. While the sheep develops in utero, the chicken develops independent of the mother in an egg case. The delayed baroreflex maturation in chickens could therefore be a particular feature of development within an egg case. To further understand the relevance of an embryonic baroreflex, we chose to study it in embryos of the American alligator. American alligators develop within an egg case, similar to the chicken embryo, thus excluding embryonic maternal physiological interactions. While this is a characteristic shared with birds, reptile eggs exhibit a greater permeability to water flux, possibly subjecting the developing animal to periods of dehydration that might require the earlier onset of a cardiovascular regulatory mechanism. Thus, thi...|$|E
