40|$|PURPOSE: <b>Brostallicin</b> (PNU- 166196) is a {{cytotoxic}} {{agent that}} binds to the minor groove of DNA with significant antitumor activity in preclinical studies. This trial {{was designed to}} determine the maximum tolerated dose, the toxicity profile, and the pharmacokinetics of <b>Brostallicin</b> in cancer patients. Experimental Design: Patients were treated with escalating doses of <b>Brostallicin</b> ranging from 0. 85 to 15 mg/m(2) administered as a 10 -min i. v. infusion every 3 weeks. Blood samples for pharmacokinetic analysis were collected during {{the first and second}} course, and analyzed by liquid-chromatography with tandem-mass spectrometric detection. RESULTS: Twenty-seven evaluable patients received a total of 73 courses. Grade 4 neutropenia was the only dose-limiting toxicity at 12. 5 mg/m(2), whereas grade 4 thrombocytopenia (1 patient) and grade 4 neutropenia (2 patients) were the dose-limiting toxicities at 15 mg/m(2). Other side effects, including thrombocytopenia and nausea, were generally mild. The maximum tolerated dose was defined at 10 mg/m(2). The clearance and terminal half-life of <b>Brostallicin</b> were dose-independent, with mean (+/-SD) values of 9. 33 +/- 2. 38 liters/h/m(2) and 4. 69 +/- 1. 88 h, respectively. There was no significant accumulation of <b>Brostallicin</b> with repeated administration. Significant relationships were observed between systemic exposure to <b>Brostallicin</b> and neutrophil counts at nadir. One partial response was observed in a patient with a gastrointestinal stromal tumor. CONCLUSION: <b>Brostallicin</b> was found to be well tolerated, with neutropenia being the principal toxicity. The recommended dose for additional evaluation in this schedule is 10 mg/m(2) ...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: <b>Brostallicin</b> is a {{novel and}} unique {{glutathione}} transferase-activated pro-drug with promising anticancer activity, currently in phase I and II clinical evaluation. In this work, we show that, {{in comparison with the}} parental cell line showing low GST levels, the cytotoxic activity of <b>brostallicin</b> is significantly enhanced in the human breast carcinoma MCF- 7 cell line, transfected with either human GST-π or GST-μ. Moreover, we describe in detail the interaction of <b>brostallicin</b> with GSH in the presence of GSTP 1 - 1 and GSTM 2 - 2, the predominant GST isoenzymes found within tumor cells. The experiments reported here indicate that <b>brostallicin</b> binds reversibly to both isoenzymes with Kd values in the micromolar range (the affinity being higher for GSTM 2 - 2). Direct evidence that both GSTP 1 - 1 and GSTM 2 - 2 isoenzymes catalyze theMichael addition reaction of GSH to <b>brostallicin</b> has been obtained both by anHPLC-MS technique and by a new fluorometric assay. We also saw the rapid formation of an intermediate reactive species, which is slowly converted into the final products. This intermediate, identified as the R-chloroamido derivative of the GSH-brostallicin adduct, is able to alkylate DNA in a sequence-specific manner and appears to be the active form of the drug. The kinetic behavior of the reaction between <b>brostallicin</b> and GSH, catalyzed by GSTP 1 - 1...|$|E

40|$|The {{mechanism}} of action of many antitumor agents involves DNA damage, either by direct binding of the drug to DNA or to DNA-binding proteins. However, most of the DNA-interacting agents have only a limited degree of sequence specificity, which implies that they may hit all the cellular genes. DNA minor groove binders, among which the derivs. of distamycin A play an important role, could provide significant improvement in cancer management, increasing gene specificity, due to high selectivity of interaction with thymine-adenine (TA) rich sequences. Here, the authors report and discuss the synthesis, in vitro and in vivo activities, and some mechanistic features of -haloacrylamido derivs. of distamycin A. The final result of this work was the selection of <b>brostallicin</b> (its HCl salt is PNU- 166196). <b>Brostallicin,</b> presently in phase II clin. trials, shows {{a broad spectrum of}} antitumor activity and an apoptotic effect higher than distamycin deriv. tallimustine. An important in vitro toxicol. feature of <b>brostallicin</b> is the very good ratio between myelotoxicity on human hematopoietic progenitor cells and cytotoxicity on tumor cells, in comparison with clin. tested DNA minor groove binders. A peculiarity of <b>brostallicin</b> is its in vitro reactivity in the DNA alkylation assays only in the presence of glutathione. Moreover brostallicin's antitumor activity, both in in vitro and in vivo tumor models, is higher in the presence of increased levels of glutathione/glutathione-S-transferase. These findings contribute to the definition of <b>brostallicin</b> as a novel anticancer agent that differs from other minor groove binders and alkylating agents for both the profile of activity and the {{mechanism of}} action and to classify the -bromoacrylamido derivs. of distamycin as a new class of cytotoxics. Moreover, due to its interaction with glutathione, <b>brostallicin</b> may have a role for the tailored treatment of tumors characterized by constitutive or therapy-induced overexpression of glutathione/glutathione-S-transferase levels...|$|E
40|$|This work is {{research}} {{dealing with}} binding {{agents in the}} minor groove of DNA. Minor groove binders (MGBs) are agents {{with the ability to}} specifically bind to specific DNA sequences. Together with DNA they form a stable complex. The degree of stability of this complex can be assessed from the change in the melting temperature of ligand/DNA complexes compared with free DNA. The structure of DNA is described in relation to its function and its importance. The basic properties of MGBs are mentioned and how they bond in the minor groove, i. e. the rules used by these agents for "reading" a DNA sequence. An overview is provided of the types of chemical structures, in particular the natural origin described in literature as MGBs. They are most commonly described with the occurring compounds, mainly those with clinical significance. The MGB-BP 3 compound is among the most interesting compounds with antibacterial activity, which is effective against the most common pathogens of nosocomial infections. Further development of the CC- 1065 analogues is also beneficial as anticancer drugs. Trabectedin has already been approved for use in cancer patients, and <b>brostallicin</b> and irofulven are undergoing clinical evaluation. It is also worth mentioning the development of furamidine prodrugs with anti-protozoal activity [...] . ...|$|E
