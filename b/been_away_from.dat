5|$|In 756, Emperor Xuanzong {{was forced}} to flee the capital and abdicate. Du Fu, who had <b>been</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the city, took his family {{to a place of}} safety and {{attempted}} to join the court of the new emperor (Suzong), but he was captured by the rebels and taken to Chang'an. In the autumn, his youngest son, Du Zongwu (Baby Bear), was born. Around this time Du Fu is thought to have contracted malaria.|$|E
5|$|Laliberté {{sought out}} Gilles Ste-Croix as {{replacement}} for the artistic director position. Ste-Croix, who had <b>been</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the company since 1985, agreed to return. The company went through more internal troubles, including a failed attempt to add Normand Latourelle as a third man to the partnership. This triumvirate lasted only six months before internal disagreements prompted Gauthier and Laliberté to buy out Latourelle. By the end of 1989, Cirque du Soleil was once again in a deficit.|$|E
5|$|His first post upon {{returning}} to his home country was an advisory position with the Canadian Radio and Television Commission (CRTC) in Ottawa, where he battled Canada's private broadcasters, especially CTV, over new Canadian content regulations. This lasted {{for only a few}} months, before in August 1970 he became the new Government Film Commissioner, the Chairman of the National Film Board of Canada, returning to the same institution for which he had worked in the 1940s. In this role, he experienced considerable problems in Quebec resulting from {{the fact that he did}} not speak French, at a time when the NFB's French Program branch was attracting young Quebec nationalist filmmakers. Some staff members also felt that he had <b>been</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the NFB for too long, while the filmmaker Denys Arcand felt that Newman did not understand Quebec culture.|$|E

5|$|In {{his final}} days, Irwin sold his rights from his {{scoreboard}} business for $2000. Though he sent $1500 to May and only $500 to Elizabeth, his Boston widow {{was surprised at}} the gesture since Irwin rarely visited Boston and provided almost no financial support to their family. In fact, May said that he had not <b>been</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> New York {{for more than a few}} days at a time in 27 years. She said that his only long trips were baseball-related, when he would scout players in other cities. Before he left New York for the final time, he told May that he was going to say goodbye to friends in Boston and that he would return to New York. Though neither woman knew of the other, Irwin's New York son Harold learned about an unknown brother while he was visiting his father in the hospital just before Irwin's death.|$|E
5|$|The new Chief of Staff, General Malin Craig offered Eichelberger {{command of}} the 29th Infantry, the {{demonstration}} regiment based at Fort Benning, Georgia. Eichelberger turned this down, as he had <b>been</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the infantry for many years, and some infantry officers might be jealous. Instead, he accepted {{command of the}} 30th Infantry, a less prestigious unit stationed at the Presidio of San Francisco, but there were still officers who resented someone attaining command of a regiment {{at the age of}} 52. Before departing, he took a brief course at the Infantry School at Fort Benning to reacquaint himself with the infantry. As part of the 3rd Infantry Division, the 30th Infantry took part in a series of major training exercises over the next two years.|$|E

Longing to return home, and also prompted by rumors of excessive drinking, Ulysses tendered his resignation. Shocked by the news, Jesse intervened, feeling Ulysses was making a terrible mistake, and urged Congressmen Andrew Ellison, and old friend of Jesse's, to get the War Department to order Grant home on recruitment duty instead, or otherwise grant him a six-month leave. Ellison presented the request to Secretary of War Jefferson Davis, but the request was denied. This {{would prove to be}} one more example of Jesse's involvement with his son's affairs.|$|E

25|$|For Hsinbyushin, his {{obsession}} to defeat Siam had come true. He now controlled a fragile empire that stretched from Manipur to Laos and Siam, which approximated Bayinnaung's 16th century empire. However he now faced {{a far more}} difficult task of holding it together, all the while waging a war against China. He had planned to leave behind a substantial garrison at Ayutthaya, either placing a protected Siamese prince on the throne or appointing senior Burmese officials to rule the country directly. But {{because he had to}} allow Shan, Laotian and Siamese levies, some of whom had <b>been</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> home for nearly two years, to return home, Hsinbyushin had a limited number of forces available to him {{in the second half of}} 1767.|$|E
25|$|The Jefferson-Wayles {{descendants}} {{and most}} historians denied for nearly 200 {{years that he}} was the father of Hemings' children. Since the mid-20th century, there have been challenges to that denial, as historians have re-examined some of the evidence and thought to interpret it differently. Disagreements have arisen since the late 20th century over how to interpret historical evidence related to the issue. According to an 1868 letter by Jefferson biographer Henry Randall to the historian James Parton, Jefferson's grandson, Thomas Jefferson Randolph, said that Jefferson's surviving daughter Martha stated on her deathbed that Jefferson had <b>been</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> Monticello for 15 months before one of Hemings' children was born, so could not be the father. But historian Dumas Malone later documented that Jefferson had been at Monticello nine months before the birth of each of Hemings' children.|$|E
25|$|Just {{over two}} thirds of the global {{production}} is eaten directly by humans with the rest being fed to animals or used to produce starch. This means that the annual diet of an average global citizen {{in the first decade of}} the 21st century included about 33kg (or 73lb) of potato. However, the local importance of potato is variable and rapidly changing. It remains an essential crop in Europe (especially eastern and central Europe), where per capita production is still the highest in the world, but the most rapid expansion over the past few decades has occurred in southern and eastern Asia. The geographic shift of potato production has <b>been</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> wealthier countries toward lower-income areas of the world (although the degree of this trend is ambiguous), leading to 2008 being named as the International Year of the Potato.|$|E

25|$|A {{number of}} later Christian texts, usually {{dating to the}} second century or later, exist as New Testament apocrypha, among which the gnostic gospels have been of major recent {{interest}} among scholars. The 1945 discovery of the Nag Hammadi library created {{a significant amount of}} scholarly interest and many modern scholars have since studied the gnostic gospels and written about them. However, the trend among the 21st century scholars has been to accept that while the gnostic gospels may shed light on the progression of early Christian beliefs, they offer very little to contribute {{to the study of the}} historicity of Jesus, in that they are rather late writings, usually consisting of sayings (rather than narrative, similar to the hypothesised Q documents), their authenticity and authorship remain questionable, and various parts of them rely on components of the New Testament. The focus of modern research into the historical Jesus has <b>been</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> gnostic writings and towards the comparison of Jewish, Greco-Roman and canonical Christian sources.|$|E
25|$|In June 1948, Gee {{was playing}} for the Homer Braves in the Southern Tier League. He threw a {{complete}} game shutout against the Ithaca Vets in early June, allowing only four hits. Later that month, Gee attempted a comeback with the Giants. Gee had <b>been</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the major leagues for two years. He pitched during batting practice for the Giants before a game in Boston on June 30, 1948, and Giants manager Mel Ott continued to inspect his work for several days thereafter. Gee did not rejoin the Giants. He pitched a six-hit victory for the Homer Braves against Groton {{in his first game}} after returning from his tryout with the Giants. Several days later, he threw a one-hitter and struck out 11 batters against the Ithaca Vets. Ithaca's sole hit in the game was a ground ball off the third baseman's glove. In late July 1948, Gee was the winning pitcher in both games of a Sunday double header. Gee compiled a 19–2 record for Homer in 1948.|$|E
25|$|After asking Gibson to {{take over}} his {{personal}} finances and switching his management from Jacobs and Roxborough to Marshall Miles, the Louis camp negotiated {{a deal with the}} IRS under which Louis would come out of retirement, with all Louis's net proceeds going to the IRS. A match with Ezzard Charles—who had acquired the vacant heavyweight title in June 1949 by outpointing Walcott—was set for September 27, 1950. By then, Louis was 36 years old and had <b>been</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> competitive boxing for two years. Weighing in at 218, Louis was still strong, but his reflexes were gone. Charles repeatedly beat him to the punch. By the end of the fight, Louis was cut above both eyes, one of which was shut tight by swelling. He knew he had lost even before Charles was declared the winner. The result was not the only disappointing aspect of the fight for Louis; only 22,357 spectators paid to witness the event at Yankee Stadium, and his share of the purse was a mere $100,458. Louis had to continue fighting.|$|E

25|$|On day {{two of the}} inquiry, Major Cooper gave {{evidence}} in respect of the flight of the aircraft, {{based on interviews with}} between 100 and 150 witnesses. He stated that the final manoeuvring of the aircraft was consistent with the pilot experiencing engine trouble and attempting to return to Croydon Airport. He stated {{that it was impossible to}} state that the engine had suffered a partial failure due to the partial obstruction of the petrol pipe. In the week before the crash, the aircraft had <b>been</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> Croydon for six days, having landed at Amsterdam, the Netherlands, Ostend, Belgium and Lympne, Kent, before returning to Croydon on the morning of 24 December. No licensed engineer was available at any of the airports away from Croydon. On arrival at Croydon, the engine was reported to be running rough. Routine servicing was carried out and the oil tank drained and refilled with fresh oil. The engine had then been ground tested, including being run for 20 minutes. Major Cooper opined that further investigation should have been undertaken given the report of rough running. It was revealed that a chart recording engine speeds during a flight from Ostend to Lympne was available, but Major Cooper had chosen not to analyse it. Sir Arthur Colefax stated that he would arrange for the document to be analysed to see if it would reveal any rough running in the engine. Evidence was given in respect of the petrol pipe. Major Cooper stated that it would not have been passed as fit for use in military aircraft, due to its construction. The inquiry was adjourned until 27 January.|$|E
