5|$|In early 1945, the German {{war effort}} {{was on the}} verge of {{collapse}} and Himmler's relationship with Hitler had deteriorated. Himmler considered independently negotiating a peace settlement. His masseur, Felix Kersten, who had moved to Sweden, acted as an intermediary in negotiations with Count Folke Bernadotte, head of the Swedish Red Cross. Letters were exchanged <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>men,</b> and direct meetings were arranged by Walter Schellenberg of the RSHA.|$|E
5|$|Morenz's {{daughter}} Marlene married Bernie Geoffrion, {{who also}} {{played for the}} Canadiens and Rangers, and was later inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame. When the Canadiens retired Geoffrion's number {{on the night of}} his death on March 11, 2006, the team recognized the link <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>men.</b> As Geoffrion's banner was being raised to the rafters, Morenz' banner was lowered halfway to the ice. Once Geoffrion's banner reached Morenz' banner, the two were raised together.|$|E
5|$|Scott {{was given}} {{leave from the}} Navy to write the {{official}} expedition account, The Voyage of the Discovery; this was published in 1905, and sold well. However, Scott's account {{in the book of}} Shackleton's breakdown during the southern journey led to disagreement <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>men,</b> particularly over Scott's version {{of the extent to which}} his companion had been carried on the sledge. The implication was that Shackleton's breakdown had caused the relatively unimpressive southern record.|$|E

5|$|This was {{not enough}} to cause a {{complete}} fallout <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>men,</b> though from this point on Warwick increasingly stayed away from court. The promotion of Warwick's brother George to Archbishop of York shows that the earl was still in favour with the king. In July 1465, when Henry VI was once more captured, it was Warwick who escorted the fallen king to his captivity in the Tower.|$|E
5|$|After {{following}} his father {{into the local}} politics of his home county, Clements agreed to chair the gubernatorial campaign of Thomas Rhea in 1935. Already committed to Rhea, he turned down an offer from Happy Chandler to chair his campaign, beginning the rift <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>men.</b> Clements {{went on to the}} Kentucky Senate in 1941. In 1944, he was selected as Democratic floor leader of the senate and successfully campaigned for a larger budget than that proposed by Republican governor Simeon Willis. His stand against Willis made him popular in the Democratic Party, and he went on to serve two terms in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1944 to 1948.|$|E
5|$|Between 1905 and 1907, Taft came {{to terms}} with the {{likelihood}} he would be the next Republican nominee for president, though he did not plan to actively campaign for it. When Justice Henry B. Brown resigned in 1905, Taft would not accept the seat although Roosevelt offered it, a position Taft held to when another seat opened in 1906. Edith Roosevelt, the First Lady, disliked the growing closeness <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>men,</b> feeling that they were too much alike and that the president did not gain much from the advice of someone who rarely contradicted him.|$|E

5|$|By early 1944 Treloar was overworked {{and unhappy}} {{to be in}} Melbourne instead of at the Memorial. He was also uncomfortable with {{the way in which}} Bean and the AWM's acting {{director}} Arthur Bazley were running the Memorial in his absence, and sought to intervene in its management. This degree of intervention frustrated Bazley, and led to increasing conflict <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>men</b> who had worked together since 1917. Their relationship worsened in 1945, and the Memorial's board was eventually forced to make a ruling on what Bazley and Treloar's responsibilities were. In 1946, Bazley left the Memorial to take a job in the Department of Immigration due to continuing tensions with Treloar.|$|E
5|$|Conwy Castle {{fell into}} {{disrepair}} {{again by the}} early 17th century. Charles I sold it to Edward Conway in 1627 for £100, and Edward's son, also called Edward, inherited the ruin in 1631. In 1642 the English Civil War broke out between the Charles' royalist supporters and Parliament. John Williams, the Archbishop of York, {{took charge of the}} castle on behalf of the king, and set about repairing and garrisoning it at his own expense. In 1645, Sir John Owen was appointed governor of the castle instead, however, leading to a bitter dispute <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>men.</b> The Archbishop defected to Parliament, the town of Conwy fell in August 1646 and in November General Thomas Mytton finally took the castle itself after a substantial siege.|$|E
5|$|Deal Castle {{continued}} {{to be used as}} a military fortification throughout the 18th century, and in 1728 it was equipped with 11 culverin guns. The following year, however, the captain, naval officer Sir John Norris, redeveloped the castle to improve his personal accommodation. Similar work had been carried out at Walmer in 1708 by the Duke of Dorset, Lionel Sackville, and there may have been some competition <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>men.</b> The keep was redesigned with medieval-style battlements, and wood-panelled accommodation at the rear overlooking the sea; the porter's lodge was also updated.|$|E
60|$|Scarce a {{word was}} spoken <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> young <b>men</b> {{as they walked}} across to Nelly Hardy's little cottage by the schoolhouse. The candles were already lighted, and Nelly rose as they entered.|$|R

5|$|Edward's {{relationship}} with Gaveston inspired Christopher Marlowe's 1592 play Edward II, {{along with other}} plays, films, novels and media. Many of these {{have focused on the}} possible sexual relationship <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>men.</b> Edward's contemporaries criticised his performance as a king, noting his failures in Scotland and the oppressive regime of his later years, although 19th-century academics later argued that the growth of parliamentary institutions during his reign was a positive development for England over the longer term. Debate has continued into the 21st century as to whether Edward was a lazy and incompetent king, or simply a reluctant and ultimately unsuccessful ruler.|$|E
5|$|In 1812, Jonathan Jennings {{defeated}} Harrison's chosen {{candidate and}} became the territory's representative to Congress. Jennings used his position there to attempt to speed up Indiana's path to statehood by immediately introducing legislation to grant Indiana statehood, even though {{the population of the}} entire territory was under 25,000. Jennings did this against the wishes of incoming governor Thomas Posey, and there was noted disagreement <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>men</b> on the subject. No action was taken on the legislation at the time, though, because of the outbreak of the War of 1812.|$|E
5|$|Maxwell's time at King's was {{probably}} the most productive of his career. He was awarded the Royal Society's Rumford Medal in 1860 for his work on colour and was later elected to the Society in 1861. This period of his life would see him display the world's first light-fast colour photograph, further develop his ideas on the viscosity of gases, and propose a system of defining physical quantities—now known as dimensional analysis. Maxwell would often attend lectures at the Royal Institution, where he came into regular contact with Michael Faraday. The relationship <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>men</b> could not be described as being close, because Faraday was 40years Maxwell's senior and showed signs of senility. They nevertheless maintained a strong respect for each other's talents.|$|E

5|$|On 24 June Burke and McDougal {{departed}} for Falkirk {{to visit the}} latter's father. Burke knew that Hare was short of cash and had even pawned some of his clothes. When the couple returned, they found that Hare was wearing new clothes and had surplus money. After he was asked, Hare denied that he had sold another body. Burke checked with Knox, who confirmed Hare had sold a woman's body for £8. It led to an argument <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>men</b> and they came to blows. Burke and his wife moved into {{the home of his}} cousin, John Broggan (or Brogan), two streets away from Tanner's Close.|$|E
5|$|Phrynion learnt that Neaira {{was back}} in Athens, and {{attempted}} to take her back from Stephanus. Stephanus resisted, claiming that as Neaira was a free woman he had no right; a claim which Phrynion proceeded to challenge in court, though he was persuaded to settle the case by arbitration instead. The arbitrators decided that Neaira was indeed free, and {{that in addition to}} this she was her own kyria (mistress); this was an extremely unusual decision in a society where all citizen women, at least, had a kyrios (master). Despite this unusual level of freedom, however, Neaira was compelled to split her time <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>men</b> as they agreed, without any input herself.|$|E
5|$|Rowan {{was known}} {{throughout}} his life as an avid gamester. On January 29, 1801, Rowan joined Dr. James Chambers and three other men for a game of cards at Duncan McLean's Tavern in Bardstown. After several beers and games of whist, Chambers suggested playing Vingt-et-un for money instead. Rowan had determined not to gamble during this session of gaming, but impaired by the alcohol, he agreed. After a few hands, an argument broke out between Chambers and Rowan. The exact nature of the argument is not known. Some accounts claim it was over who was better able to speak Latin and Greek; others suggest that general insults were exchanged <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>men.</b> A brief scuffle followed the disagreement.|$|E

But Cuffer came to Shelley's assistance, and <b>between</b> them <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>men</b> dragged <b>the</b> boy {{into the room and}} shut the door after him. Dick struggled vigorously even when in the apartment until Cuffer caught up an empty water pitcher and flourished it over his head.|$|R
60|$|And {{because he}} thus kept aloof, his ears {{were not so}} {{completely}} filled with the din, nor his mind so wholly engrossed by <b>the</b> hand-to-hand struggle <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> young <b>men,</b> {{that he did not}} perceive that other sound, which, in spite of barred windows and drawn curtains, came up from the street below.|$|R
5|$|Successes {{during this}} time {{included}} Aditya Chopra's Mohabbatein (2000), and Karan Johar's family drama Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham... (2001), which Khan cites as {{a turning point in}} his career. Both films co-starred Amitabh Bachchan as an authoritarian figure, and presented ideological struggles <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>men.</b> Khan's performances in the films were met with wide public appreciation, and he was awarded his second Filmfare Critics Award for Best Actor for Mohabbatein. Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham... remained the top-grossing Indian production of all time in the overseas market for the next five years.|$|E
5|$|Wartime Mikkeli is {{identified}} with Marshal Mannerheim, {{the commander of}} the Finnish army and later President of Finland. His personal railway carriage, which he used as a command post during the war, is parked in a siding at Mikkeli station. It is possible to look inside the carriage through its windows at any time. But public entry to the carriage is only permitted once a year, on Mannerheim's birthday (June 4). The carriage was the venue of Mannerheim's famous 1942 meeting (near Immola) with Hitler, on which occasion a private conversation <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>men</b> was secretly recorded. Photographs of this meeting are on display in the carriage. Mannerheim was a regular diner at the Mikkelin Klubi, where his favourite drink was schnapps.|$|E
5|$|Alderson's {{situation}} worsened at the Battle of Festubert in May 1915, {{when the}} Canadian Division {{failed to make}} any headway and suffered nearly 2,500 casualties. Another operation a month later, the Second Battle of Givenchy, cost 366 casualties for no appreciable gain. Again, Alderson was not solely at fault in these actions and he remained popular with British Army Headquarters, Prime Minister Borden and with his men, resulting in promotion to command the entire Canadian Expeditionary Force when a second Division arrived late in 1915. Despite this popularity, Sam Hughes continued to hold a grudge against Alderson and opposed him in political circles, taking offense at Alderson's refusal to accept promotions made by Hughes or Carson of untried Canadian officers and instead promoting veteran British officers in their place. The main area of argument <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>men</b> however was again over the Ross rifle.|$|E
