40|$|A fully {{relativistic}} {{treatment of}} the S-matrix elements describing two-photon <b>bound</b> - <b>bound</b> <b>transition</b> amplitudes in hydrogen-like ions is undertaken in the present work. Several selected transitions from the ground state vertical bar 1 (2) S > towards the L and M shells (vertical bar 2 (2) S >, vertical bar 3 (2) S >, vertical bar 3 (2) D(3 / 2) > and vertical bar 3 (2) D(5 / 2) >) are described. For that purpose, we use the complete set of relativistic Sturmian functions derived by Szmytkowski (1997 J. Phys. B: At. Mol. Opt. Phys. 30 825) from the first-order Sturm-Liouville problems for the Dirac equation. The method followed consists of writing the matrix elements in terms of Green functions expanded over the first-order Dirac - Coulomb Sturmians. Previous approaches used a Sturmian basis associated with the Gell-Mann-Feynman equation. On the other hand, a distinctive feature of our tensor treatment is that the expressions derived are quite general and {{could be applied to}} any multipole of the two-photon <b>bound</b> - <b>bound</b> <b>transitions.</b> In the case of dipole transitions, considered also by Szymanowski et al (1997 Phys. Rev. A 56 700) in their calculations, the selection rules derived from our method lead to two additional terms related to l(1 p) = 2 and l(2 p) = 2. The numerical results obtained for the transition from the ground state vertical bar 1 (2) S > towards the L and M shells enable us to draw inferences as to the improvements of our method...|$|R
40|$|Context: The {{presence}} of heavier chemical elements in stellar atmospheres influences the spectral energy distribution (SED) of stars. An uneven surface distribution of these elements, together with flux redistribution and stellar rotation, are commonly {{believed to be}} the primary causes of the variability of chemically peculiar (CP) stars. Aims: We aim to model the photometric variability of the CP star PHI Dra based on the assumption of inhomogeneous surface distribution of heavier elements and compare it to the observed variability of the star. We also intend to identify the processes that contribute most significantly to its photometric variability. Methods: We use a grid of TLUSTY model atmospheres and the SYNSPEC code to model the radiative flux emerging from the individual surface elements of PHI Dra with different chemical compositions. We integrate the emerging flux over the visible surface of the star at different phases throughout the entire rotational period to synthesise theoretical light curves of the star in several spectral bands. Results: The synthetic light curves in the visible and in the near-UV regions are in very good agreement with the observed variability of the star. The lack of usable far-UV measurements of the star precludes making any conclusions about the correctness of our model in this spectral region. We also obtained 194 new BVRI observations of PHI Dra and improved its rotational period to P= 1. 716500 (2). Conclusions: We show that the inhomogeneous distribution of elements, flux redistribution, and rotation of the star are fully capable of explaining the stellar variability in the visible and the near-UV regions. The flux redistribution is mainly caused by <b>bound</b> [...] free <b>transitions</b> of silicon and <b>bound</b> [...] <b>bound</b> <b>transitions</b> of iron...|$|R
40|$|Current {{and future}} {{experiments}} with antihydrogen (H) {{for a study}} of matter [...] antimatter (CPT) symmetry and antimatter gravity require ultracold H in order to reach ultimate levels of precision. A promising path towards the production of anti-atoms much colder than a few kelvin involves the pre-cooling of antiprotons by laser-cooled anions. Due to the unusual binding of the valence electron in anions [...] dominated by polarization and correlation effects [...] only few candidate systems with <b>bound</b> [...] <b>bound</b> <b>transitions</b> suitable for laser cooling exist. We report on a combination of experimental and theoretical studies to fully determine the relevant binding energies, transition rates and branching ratios of the most promising candidate La^-. Using a combination of transverse and collinear laser spectroscopy, we determined the resonant frequency of the laser cooling transition to be 96. 592713 (91) THz and the transition rate of its highest-intensity hyperfine component to be A = 4. 90 (50) × 10 ^ 4 s^- 1. We developed a novel relativistic high-precision theoretical treatment of the La^- ion and demonstrate a drastic improvement of theoretical accuracy. Values of yet unmeasured energy levels, transition rates, branching ratios, and level lifetimes calculated in this work complement experimental information on the laser cooling cycle of La^-. The new data establish the suitability of La^- for laser cooling and show that the cooling transition is significantly, by a factor ≈ 50 %, stronger than previously assumed. Unwanted branching to other decay channels is negligible and can easily be repumped if necessary. Present theoretical methodology may be applied to other negative ions.
