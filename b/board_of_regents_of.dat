5|$|In 1867, United States Supreme Court justice Stephen Johnson Field {{assigned}} Deady {{to serve}} as a circuit court judge for the United States circuit court located in San Francisco, California. Deady did the same in 1868 and 1869 since there was no circuit court judge assigned to the West Coast at that time, spending three months in San Francisco each year. This was a common practice during this period, as United States Supreme Court justices still rode circuit, and often assigned federal district court judges to serve on the appellate level circuit courts. The Judiciary Act of 1869 reduced much of this process, as did the Judiciary Act of 1891 that established the current United States courts of appeals with Oregon in the Ninth Circuit. While serving on the district court, Deady {{served as president of the}} <b>Board</b> <b>of</b> <b>Regents</b> <b>of</b> the State University (later University of Oregon) from 1873 to 1893.
