5|$|The mass <b>balance,</b> or {{difference}} between accumulation and ablation (melting and sublimation), of a glacier {{is crucial to}} its survival. Climate change may cause variations in both temperature and snowfall, resulting in changes in mass <b>balance.</b> A glacier with a sustained negative <b>balance</b> loses equilibrium and retreats. A sustained positive <b>balance</b> is also out of equilibrium and will advance to reestablish equilibrium. Currently, nearly all glaciers have a negative mass <b>balance</b> and are retreating.|$|E

Many researches have proposed various designs of assembly line <b>balancing</b> to solve this problem.

5|$|Because the <b>balance</b> of {{payments}} sums to zero, {{a current account}} surplus indicates a deficit in the asset accounts and vice versa. A current account surplus or deficit indicates {{the extent to which}} a country is relying on foreign capital to finance its consumption and investments, and whether it is living beyond its means. For example, assuming a capital account <b>balance</b> of zero (thus no asset transfers available for financing), a current account deficit of £1 billion implies a financial account surplus (or net asset exports) of £1 billion. A net exporter of financial assets is known as a borrower, exchanging future payments for current consumption. Further, a net export of financial assets indicates growth in a country's debt. From this perspective, the <b>balance</b> {{of payments}} links a nation's income to its spending by indicating the degree to which current account imbalances are financed with domestic or foreign financial capital, which illuminates how a nation's wealth is shaped over time. A healthy <b>balance</b> of payments position is important for economic growth. If countries experiencing a growth in demand have trouble sustaining a healthy <b>balance</b> of payments, demand can slow, leading to: unused or excess supply, discouraged foreign investment, and less attractive exports which can further reinforce a negative cycle that intensifies payments imbalances.|$|E

40|$|<b>Balanced</b> {{truncation}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} common model reduction schemes. In this note, we present a survey of <b>balancing</b> related model reduction methods and their corresponding error norms, and also introduce some new results. Five <b>balancing</b> methods are studied: (1) Lyapunov <b>balancing,</b> (2) Stochastic <b>balancing</b> (3) Bounded real <b>balancing,</b> (4) Positive real <b>balancing</b> and (5) Frequency weighted <b>balancing.</b> For positive real <b>balancing,</b> we introduce a multiplicative-type error bound. Moreover, for a certain subclass of positive real systems, a modified positive-real <b>balancing</b> scheme with an absolute error bound is proposed. We also develop a new frequency-weighted <b>balanced</b> reduction method with a simple bound on the error system based on the frequency domain representations of the system gramians. Two numerical examples are illustrated to verify the efficiency of the proposed methods. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{this book}} {{advanced}} <b>balancing</b> methods for planar and spatial linkages, hand operated and automatic robot manipulators are presented. It is organized into three main parts and eight chapters. The main parts are {{the introduction to}} <b>balancing,</b> the <b>balancing</b> of linkages and the <b>balancing</b> of robot manipulators. The review of state-of-the-art literature including more than 500 references discloses particularities of shaking force/moment <b>balancing</b> and gravity compensation methods. Then new methods for <b>balancing</b> of linkages are considered. Methods provided {{in the second part}} of the book deal with the partial and complete shaking force/moment <b>balancing</b> of various linkages. A new field for <b>balancing</b> methods applications is the design of mechanical systems for fast manipulation. Special attention is given to the shaking force/moment <b>balancing</b> of robot manipulators. Gravity <b>balancing</b> methods are also discussed. The suggested <b>balancing</b> methods are illustrated by numerous examples...|$|R

40|$|Load <b>balancing</b> {{middleware}} is {{used extensively}} to improve scalability and overall system throughput in distributed systems. Many load <b>balancing</b> middleware services are simplistic, however, {{since they are}} geared only for specific usecases and environments. These limitations {{make it hard to}} use the same load <b>balancing</b> service for anything other than the distributed application it was designed for originally. This lack of generality forces continuous re-development of application-specific load <b>balancing</b> services. Not only does re-development increase deployment costs of distributed applications, but it also increases the potential of producing nonoptimal load <b>balancing</b> implementations since proven load <b>balancing</b> service optimizations cannot be reused directly. This paper presents a set of load <b>balancing</b> service features that address many existing middleware load <b>balancing</b> service inadequacies, such as lack of server-side transparency, centralized load <b>balancing,</b> sole support for stateless replication, fixed load monitoring granularities, lack of fault tolerant load <b>balancing,</b> non-extensible load <b>balancing</b> algorithms, and simplistic replica management.

5|$|Glacier retreat {{results in}} the loss of the low-elevation region of the glacier. Since higher {{elevations}} are cooler, the disappearance of the lowest portion decreases overall ablation, thereby increasing mass <b>balance</b> and potentially reestablishing equilibrium. If the mass <b>balance</b> of {{a significant portion of the}} accumulation zone of the glacier is negative, it is in disequilibrium with the climate and will melt away without a colder climate and or an increase in frozen precipitation.|$|E

40|$|This study proposes an {{improved}} cell <b>balancing</b> circuit for fast equalization among lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries. A simple voltage sensorless charge <b>balancing</b> circuit {{has been proposed}} in the past [1]. This cell <b>balancing</b> circuit automatically transfers energy from high-to low-voltage battery cells. However, the circuit requires a switch with low on-resistance because the <b>balancing</b> speed {{is limited by the}} on-resistance of the switch. <b>Balancing</b> speed decreases as the voltage difference among the battery cells decrease. In this study, the <b>balancing</b> speed of the cell <b>balancing</b> circuit is enhanced by using the auxiliary circuit, which boosts the <b>balancing</b> current. The charging current is determined by the nominal battery cell voltage and thus, the <b>balancing</b> speed is almost constant despite the very small voltage differences among the batteries. Simulation results are provided to verify the validity of the proposed cell <b>balancing</b> circuit. ? ??? 2014 ? ???????? ????? ?????...|$|R
