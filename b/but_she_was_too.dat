In 2006 Barlow claimed {{that she had}} again been asked to return to Coronation Street, but had refused as she felt the storylines were {{not good enough for}} Mavis. Barlow stated in 2007 that she is unlikely to return, because she would be unable to cope with the accelerated production schedule of one more episode a week since her last appearance in 1997. Executive producer Kim Crowther said in 2009 that she would have liked Mavis to return to the serial.|$|E

There, she silenced the Austrian coastal batteries protecting the main port, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> badly damaged {{to take part in the}} ensuing Battle of Lissa. The ship's postwar career was limited due to a combination of drastically reduced naval budgets and the appearance of more modern ironclads. Formidabile was used as a training ship starting in 1887; she was discarded in 1903 and broken up for scrap.|$|E
5|$|Both Task Forces {{needed to}} refuel, but TF 17 {{finished}} first and Fletcher took Yorktown and her consorts northward toward the Solomon Islands on 2 May. TF 11 {{was ordered to}} rendezvous with TF 17 and TF 44, the old ANZAC Squadron, further west into the Coral Sea on 4 May. The Japanese opened Operation Mo by occupying Tulagi on 3 May. Alerted by Allied reconnaissance aircraft, Fletcher decided to attack Japanese shipping there the following day. The air strike on Tulagi confirmed {{that at least one}} American carrier was in the vicinity, but the Japanese had no idea of its location. They launched a number of reconnaissance aircraft the following day to search for the Americans, but without result. One H6K flying boat spotted Yorktown, but was shot down by one of Yorktowns Wildcat fighters before she could radio a report. US Army Air Force (USAAF) aircraft spotted Shōhō southwest of Bougainville Island on 5 May, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> far north to be attacked by the American carriers, which were refueling. That day, Fletcher received Ultra intelligence that placed the three Japanese carriers known to be involved in Operation Mo near Bougainville Island, and predicted 10 May as the date of the invasion. It also predicted airstrikes by the Japanese carriers in support of the invasion several days before 10 May. Based on this information, Fletcher planned to complete refueling on 6 May and to move closer to the eastern tip of New Guinea {{to be in a position}} to locate and attack Japanese forces on 7 May.|$|E

At 01:31, U-156 surfaced in San Nicolaas Harbour some [...] offshore and attacked the two British tankers at anchor. Hartenstein fired one torpedo from his bow tubes at Pedernales. The torpedo attack was successful and Pedernales was hit amidships. Loaded with crude oil, the steamer immediately burst into flames, killing eight of her 26 crewmen and wounding her captain Herbert McCall. Oranjestad then began to lift anchor and steam away <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> late and was hit by a second torpedo fired from U-156.

He said: [...] "We didn't want that soap star-turned-singer vibe but how cool {{would it be}} if she already was a singer? Neighbours developed a character to suit her {{rather than the other}} way around." [...] Goodrem worked with the writers to incorporate her music into the show, and Wheatley used the exposure that Neighbours gave Goodrem to relaunch her singing career. Nina had a powerful voice and wrote her own songs, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> shy to sing them in public. Harold Bishop (Ian Smith) discovered Nina's singing talent one day, and Connor entered one of her songs, [...] "Born To Try", in a talent contest at UniFM, where it won. As Nina was too shy to go and receive the prize, Tahnee Coppin (Anna Jennings-Edquist) tried to take credit for the song instead. Connor stopped her and Nina overcame her shyness to sing her song. Within weeks of it being performed, [...] "Born to Try" [...] became the number one single in Australia.|$|E

At age 20, incipient cataracts were discovered when she suffered a major episode of conjunctivitis. After marriage at 21, her husband's wealth made it possible for Calment never to have to work.

In the summer, the couple would stay at Uriage for mountaineering up to the glacier ("Even at 16 I had good legs"). She also went hunting with her husband in the hills of the Provence to shoot rabbits and wild boars. Her husband introduced her to smoking, offering cigarettes after a meal, but it was not her passion. ("After the meal, after just one, I'd had enough of it".) Calment smoked cigarettes from the age of 21 (1896) to 117 (1992). According to one source, she smoked no more than two cigarettes per day and it is not known whether she inhaled, whereas an earlier medical source states that she smoked cigars with her husband before changing to cigarettes more recently.|$|E

With her newly arrived sister Queen Elizabeth, Barham escorted Formidable as her aircraft attacked the Italian airfield at Scarpanto at dawn on 26 May with some success. While covering the evacuation of Crete the following day, the ship was attacked by Junkers Ju 88 bombers from II./LG (Demonstration Wing) 1 and Heinkel He 111 bombers of II./KG (Bomber Wing) 26. One [...] bomb struck 'Y' turret and started a fire inside the turret that took 20 minutes to quench.

2500|$|The same year, Bimal Roy {{cast her}} as Chandramukhi {{opposite}} Dilip Kumar in the critically acclaimed Devdas, {{which was the}} adaptation of the novel with same title by Sharat Chandra Chatterji. The industry initially was not in favour of this choice when they heard about Vyjayanthimala being cast in Bimal Roy's film, the response being: [...] "Why don't you take comedian Kishore Kumar as Devdas?". Initially Nargis was selected for Chandramukhi's role, but she {{refused to accept the}} role. The role was later offered to Bina Rai and Suraiya but they too turned it down as they wanted to essay the lead role of Paro, which was earlier offered to Meena Kumari. Subsequently, the film unit suffered with financial crisis and at this point Vyjayanthimala offered to do the role of Chandramukhi, where she said to Bimal Roy, [...] "I am ready if you think I can do it". On the other hand, Nabendu Ghosh, the script writer of Devdas, said that, [...] "I did not approve of Vyjayanthimala , but we had no option – no one wanted to play Chandramukhi, and we were committed to our distributors... She was, of course, a very good actress, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> young for Chandramukhi, as envisioned by Saratbabu". On her performance, Rediff wrote: [...] "Vyjayanthimala imbues Chandramukhi with true sympathy. Who better than Chandramukhi would know the pain of a hopeless love?... Vyjayanthimala, a star after the blockbuster Nagin, still had to establish her acting credentials when Roy went against the tide and cast her in the role of Chandramukhi". While Upperstall.com describes her performance as: [...] "Vyjayantimala's Chandramukhi is embellished with her graceful dance style that evolves with the evolution in her character within the film from a popular dancing woman to a woman, who, in love with Devdas, has unconsciously mutated to reflect the mainstream woman. For Vyjayantimala, the character marked a turning point from glamour to pure histrionics, offering her scope to explore her potential as a dramatic actress without taking away from her, the most outstanding gift she brought to cinema– her dance". Subsequently, she won the Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actress but refused to accept it, stating that her role was a leading one and in equal importance to the role played by Suchitra Sen and not supporting. In 2006, a poll conducted by Rediff ranked her role of Chandramukhi {{as one of the best}} Tawaif characters in Bollywood. Subsequently, the same role was listed in The Times of India's [...] "10 Celluloid Hookers You Loved" [...] at number six by Nikhat Kazmi. Though the film was critically successful, it did not garner much support at the box office and ended up as 10th highest-grossing movie of 1955 with an average verdict [...]|$|E
