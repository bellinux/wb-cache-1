5|$|As governor, Seward {{incurred}} considerable {{personal debt}} {{not only because}} he had to live beyond his salary to maintain the lifestyle expected of the office, but also <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not pay down his obligation from the land company purchase. At the time he left office, he owed $200,000. Returning to Auburn, he absorbed himself in a profitable law practice. He did not abandon politics, and received former president Adams at the Seward family home in 1843.|$|E
5|$|Burr, sensing {{an attack}} on his honor, and {{recovering}} from his defeat, demanded an apology in letter form. Hamilton wrote a letter in response and ultimately refused <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not recall the instance of insulting Burr. Hamilton would also {{have been accused of}} recanting Cooper's letter out of cowardice. After a series of attempts to reconcile were to no avail, a duel was arranged through liaisons on June 27, 1804.|$|E
5|$|In 1941 Kallman {{ended their}} sexual {{relationship}} <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not accept Auden's insistence on mutual fidelity, {{but he and}} Auden remained companions {{for the rest of}} Auden's life, sharing houses and apartments from 1953 until Auden's death. Auden dedicated both editions of his collected poetry (1945/50 and 1966) to Isherwood and Kallman.|$|E

50|$|After the {{television}} show ended, both cars were offered back to Dean Jeffries for $1,000 each, who had right of first refusal. He declined to purchase the cars <b>because</b> <b>he</b> felt <b>he</b> <b>could</b> build new ones cheaper.|$|R
5|$|In {{regards to}} the English dub, Shinkai {{did not feel that}} he could judge the quality of the voice acting since he could not speak English natively. He felt that it was good due to the {{feedback}} he had received and <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> feel the emotion in the characters' voices. However, he noted that the experience would be different for viewers and that the final judgment could only be made by English-speaking audiences.|$|E
5|$|This contradicted Wright's earlier {{statement}} when stopped by {{police in the}} district {{in the early hours}} of the morning: he implied he was unaware he was in the red light district and was driving around <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not sleep. Wright's rented flat was located in the red light area.|$|E
5|$|Wilhelm was one {{of eleven}} {{children}} born to poor tenant farmers John and Ethel (née Stanley) Wilhelm in Huntersville, North Carolina. He played baseball at Cornelius High School in Cornelius, North Carolina. There, he began experimenting with a knuckleball after reading about pitcher Dutch Leonard. He felt that, <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not throw fast, honing a knuckleball offered him his best shot at success. He used a tennis ball to practice.|$|E
50|$|On September 4, 2008, Culpepper {{announced}} his retirement. He expressed his frustrations with the NFL in a 506 word retirement letter. The main reason of his retirement was <b>because</b> <b>he</b> felt <b>he</b> <b>could</b> {{still be a}} starting quarterback in the NFL.|$|R
50|$|Joel Comm {{began his}} career as a radio personality, where he played music and was a weatherman. He later became a mobile disc jockey and then moved to Internet {{marketing}} <b>because</b> <b>he</b> knew <b>he</b> <b>could</b> become wealthier with an online career.|$|R

5|$|After {{thirteen}} months, {{a shortage}} of funds forced Johnson to leave Oxford without a degree, and he returned to Lichfield. Towards the end of Johnson's stay at Oxford, his tutor, Jorden, left Pembroke {{and was replaced by}} William Adams. He enjoyed Adams as a tutor, but by December, Johnson was already a quarter behind in his student fees, and he was forced to return home. He left behind many books that he had borrowed from his father <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not afford to transport them, and also because he hoped to return to Oxford soon.|$|E
5|$|After {{thirteen}} months, poverty forced Johnson {{to leave}} Oxford {{without taking a}} degree, and he returned to Lichfield. During his last weeks at Oxford, Jorden left Pembroke, and Johnson was given William Adams as a tutor in his place. He enjoyed Adams as a tutor, but by December, Johnson was already a quarter behind in his student fees, and {{he was forced to}} return home. He left behind many of the books that his father had previously lent him, both <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not afford the expense of transporting all of them and as a symbolic gesture that he hoped to return to the school soon.|$|E
5|$|In 1840, {{about six}} camels were shipped from Tenerife to Adelaide, {{but only one}} survived the journey to arrive on 12 October that year. The animal, a male called Harry, was owned by the {{explorer}} John Ainsworth Horrocks. Harry was ill-tempered but was included in an expedition the following year <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> carry heavy loads. The next major group of camels were imported into Australia in 1860, and between 1860 and 1907 10 to 12 thousand were imported. These were used mainly for riding and transport.|$|E

5|$|Perlman, a {{frequent}} collaborator with director Jean-Pierre Jeunet, {{said in a}} 2009 AMC Networks featurette that Alien Resurrection was his only film in which he feared for his life. During the filming of the underwater scene, Perlman struggled with the aquatic set and nearly drowned <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not reach its openings. In a character-breaking occurrence, Perlman nearly compromised a shot of Sigourney Weaver making a basket from behind but editor Hervé Schneid was able to remove Perlman's reaction from the scene. In From Alien to The Matrix: Reading Science Fiction Film, Roz Kaveney interprets Johner and Number 8 as monogamous animals, with a weaker, aggressive male unsuccessfully attempting to seduce a stronger female.|$|E
5|$|Sir William Rae, the Lord Advocate, {{followed}} a regular technique: {{he focused on}} one individual to extract a confession on which the others could be convicted. Hare was chosen and, on 1 December, he was offered immunity from prosecution if he turned king's evidence and provided the full details {{of the murder of}} Docherty and any other; <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not be brought to testify against his wife, she was also exempt from prosecution. Hare made a full confession of all the deaths and Rae decided sufficient evidence existed to secure a prosecution. On 4 December formal charges were lain against Burke and McDougal for the murders of Mary Paterson, James Wilson and Mrs Docherty.|$|E
5|$|The {{family lived}} in Norman until Warren was 11, when they moved to Oklahoma City. When she was 12, her father, a {{salesman}} at Montgomery Ward, had a heart attack—which led to many medical bills, {{as well as a}} pay cut <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not do his previous work. Eventually, this led to the loss of their car from failure to make loan payments. To help the family finances, her mother found work in the catalog order department at Sears. When she was 13, Warren started waiting tables at her aunt's restaurant.|$|E
50|$|Gavin: Braden's former {{friend who}} cheated with Analise on him. When {{he tries to}} make a move on Joss, Braden loses control and hits him, this time really hard, <b>because</b> <b>he</b> feared <b>he</b> <b>could</b> take Joss away from him. It's the point where Braden realizes that he truly loves Joss.|$|R

5|$|Bakshi chose {{rotoscoping}} as {{a cost-effective}} way {{to complete the}} movie's battle scenes with his own finances. <b>Because</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not afford to hire a film crew or actors, or develop 35mm stock, Bakshi requested prints of films that contained the type of large battle scenes needed, including Sergei Eisenstein's Alexander Nevsky, and spliced together the footage he needed. However, the cost of printing photographs of each frame would have cost $3 million. Learning that IBM had introduced an industrial-sized photocopier, Bakshi {{asked one of the}} company's technical experts if {{he would be able to}} feed 35mm reels into the machine to produce enlarged copies of each frame. The experiment worked, and Bakshi got the pages he needed for a penny per copy.|$|E
5|$|Brezhnev {{conspired to}} oust Podgorny from the {{collective}} leadership {{as early as}} 1970. The reason was simple: Brezhnev was third, while Podgorny was first in the ranking of Soviet diplomatic protocol; Podgorny's removal would have made Brezhnev head of state, and his political power would have increased significantly. For much of the period, however, Brezhnev was unable to have Podgorny removed, <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not count on enough votes in the Politburo, since the removal of Podgorny would have meant weakening of {{the power and the}} prestige of the collective leadership itself. Indeed, Podgorny continued to acquire greater power as the head of state throughout the early 1970s, due to Brezhnev's liberal stance on Yugoslavia and his disarmament talks with some Western powers, policies which many Soviet officials saw as contrary to common communist principles.|$|E
5|$|Historian Carl Sferrazza Anthony {{noted that}} {{ordinary}} citizens responded to Nixon. When {{a group of}} rural people visited the White House to present a quilt to the First Lady, many were overcome with nervousness; upon hearing their weeping, Pat hugged each individual tightly, and the tension dissipated. When a young boy doubted that the Executive Mansion was her house <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not see the washing machine, Pat led him through the halls and up an elevator, into the family quarters and the laundry room. She mixed well with people of different races, and made no distinctions on that basis. During the Nixons' trip to China in 1972, foreign minister Zhou En-lai was suffienciently smitten with her so as to give two rare giant pandas to the ambassador as a gift from China.|$|E

5|$|In December 1888, the Chiswick Press {{published}} Morris' The House of the Wolfings, {{a fantasy}} story set in Iron Age Europe {{which provides a}} reconstructed portrait {{of the lives of}} Germanic-speaking Gothic tribes. It contained both prose and aspects of poetic verse. A sequel, The Roots of the Mountains, followed in 1890. Over the coming years he would publish a string of other poetic works; The Story of the Glittering Plain (1890), The Wood Beyond the World (1894), The Well at the World's End (1896), The Water of the Wondrous Isles (1897) and The Sundering Flood (1898). He also embarked on a translation of the Anglo-Saxon tale, Beowulf; <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not fully understand Old English, his poetic translation was based largely on that already produced by A.J. Watts. On publication, Morris' Beowulf would be critically panned. Following the death of the sitting Poet Laureate of Great Britain and Ireland, Alfred, Lord Tennyson, in October 1892, Morris was offered the position, but turned it down, disliking its associations with the monarchy and political establishment; instead the position went to Alfred Austin.|$|E
5|$|The 1973–74 season saw {{the arrival}} of a new player in Johan Cruyff, who was bought for a world record £920,000 from Ajax. Already an {{established}} player with Ajax, Cruyff quickly won over the Barcelona fans when he told the European press that he chose Barcelona over Real Madrid <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not play for a club associated with Franco. He further endeared himself when he named his son Jordi, after the local Catalan Saint George. Next to champions like Juan Manuel Asensi, Carles Rexach and Hugo Sotil, he helped the club win the 1973–74 season {{for the first time since}} 1960, defeating Real Madrid 5–0 at the Santiago Bernabéu along the way. He was crowned European Footballer of the Year in 1973 during his first season with Barcelona (his second Ballon d'Or win; he won his first while playing for Ajax in 1971). Cruyff received this prestigious award a third time (the first player to do so) in 1974, while he was still with Barcelona.|$|E
5|$|The strongman behind Haakon's monarchy {{had been}} his foster-father Tore Tordsson ("Steigar-Tore"), who refused to {{recognise}} Magnus as king after Haakon's death. With Egil Aslaksson and other noblemen, he had the otherwise-unknown Sweyn Haraldsson set up as a pretender. Although later sagas maintain that Sweyn was Danish, some modern historians have speculated {{that he may have}} been a son of Harald Hardrada. The revolt was based in the Uplands, but also gained support from noblemen elsewhere in the country. After several weeks of fighting, Magnus captured Tore and his supporters and had them hanged on the island of Vambarholm (outside Hamnøy, Lofoten, in northern Norway). Magnus was reportedly furious <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not pardon Egil, a potentially useful, young and resourceful nobleman. As king, his honour would only allow a pardon if other noblemen pleaded for Egil's life; this did not happen.|$|E

50|$|Edwig Van Hooydonck (born 4 August 1966 in Ekeren) is {{a former}} {{professional}} road racing cyclist from Belgium. He won the prestigious Tour of Flanders twice and Brabantse Pijl four times. He retired from professional cycling <b>because</b> <b>he</b> felt <b>he</b> <b>could</b> no longer compete with other cyclists, {{who were at the}} time starting to dope themselves, without himself cheating too. At this time Erythropoietin (EPO) was becoming a widely used doping agent in the sport.|$|R
