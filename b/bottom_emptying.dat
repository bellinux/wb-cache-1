40|$|Although some {{methods for}} {{determining}} lime requirement of pond soils {{are available and}} commonly used, {{there is still no}} consensus on whether it is more effective to apply liming materials to the <b>bottoms</b> of <b>empty</b> ponds or to wait and apply them over the water surface after ponds are filled. There is also little information on how deep lime reacts in pond sediment over time, and whether the depth of reaction is different when liming materials are applied to the water or to the soil. Therefore, three techniques for treating fish ponds with agricultural limestone were evaluated in ponds with clayey soils at a commercial fish farm. Amounts of agricultural limestone equal to the lime requirement of bottom soils were applied to each of three ponds by: direct application over the pond water surface; spread uniformly over the <b>bottom</b> of the <b>empty</b> pond; spread uniformly over the <b>bottom</b> of the <b>empty</b> pond followed by tilling of the bottom. Effectiveness of agricultural limestone applications did not differ among treatment methods. Agricultural limestone also reacted quickly to increase total alkalinity and total hardness of pond water to acceptable concentrations within 2 weeks after application. The reaction of lime to increase soil pH was essentially complete after one to two months, and lime had no effect below a soil depth of 8 cm. Tilling of pond bottoms to incorporate liming materials is unnecessary, and tilling consumes time and is an expensive practice; filled ponds can be limed effectively...|$|R

A hopper dredge usually has doors in its <b>bottom</b> to <b>empty</b> the dredged materials, but some dredges empty their hoppers by splitting the two halves of their hulls on giant hydraulic hinges. Either way, as the vessel dredges, excess water in the dredged materials is spilled off as the heavier solids settle {{to the bottom of the}} hopper. This excess water is returned to the sea to reduce weight and increase the amount of solid material (or slurry) that can be carried in one load. When the hopper is filled with slurry, the dredger stops dredging and goes to a dump site and empties its hopper.|$|R

40|$|We have {{performed}} the numerical modeling of Ge(111) -(2 x 1) surface electronic properties in vicinity of P donor impurity atom {{located near the}} surface. We have found a notable increase of surface LDOS around surface dopant near the <b>bottom</b> of <b>empty</b> surface states band π^*, which we called split state due to its limited spatial extent and energetic position inside the band gap. We show, that despite of well established bulk donor impurity energy level position {{at the very bottom}} of conduction band, surface donor impurity on Ge(111) -(2 x 1) surface might produce energy level below Fermi energy, depending on impurity atom local environment. It was demonstrated, that impurity, located in subsurface atomic layers, is visible in STM experiment on Ge(111) -(2 x 1) surface. The quasi- 1 D character of impurity image, observed in STM experiments, is confirmed by our computer simulations with a note that a few π-bonded dimer rows may be affected by the presence of impurity atom.

50|$|In {{addition}} to Peak 7, {{a new high}} speed quad was built to connect Peak 9 to Peak 8. The Peak 8 SuperConnect replaced the aging Lift 4 and improved navigation between the two peaks (prior to 2002, transitioning from Peak 9 to Peak 8 required going {{to the top of}} Peak 9 and taking a black trail called Shock or a blue run called Union to the bottom of Lift 4). It originates on Peak 9 at the junction of the trails Red Rover and Sundown (just down a hill from Lift A), crosses over the Beaver Run SuperChair and Lift C, runs to a midway load and turn station at Lift 4's loading station, then runs up Lift 4's line to end near the Vista Haus. To guarantee that chairs are available for people using the mid-station, a system of automatic loading gates was introduced.

50|$|Sea-water {{may have}} been {{collected}} in tidally-fed sun pans cut into tidal channels to allow for solar evaporation {{in the initial stages}} of the process, although no such features have been positively identified. Instead, sea water seems to have been collected in the clay-lined settling tanks, which were submerged by the high-tide or were filled manually when the tide was lower. The depth of these tanks suggests that they were designed to allow the alluvial mud and other unwanted solids in the water to settle to the <b>bottom,</b> to be <b>emptied</b> out later. As this settling procedure could take several hours, having more than one tank allowed for them to be at different stages of the settling process, meaning that salt making could continue with little down-time.|$|R

When Sam works out the solution, Sam and Lens than drive to Albernathy, on Sam's urging. Here, they find the man they thought was Cordwainer, alive and well -- who is actually an escaped convict named Delos. Delos killed Cordwainer before winter, which explains the change in personality. He then pretended to be him. The journals in the strong boxes were revealed to be blocks of ice, which explains the small holes and the traces of sawdust. The gristmill was set on fire in order to thaw Cordwainer's body, which had been frozen since winter.|$|R

40|$|Fermi-edge {{absorption}} theory {{predicting the}} spectrum, A(ω) ∝ω^- 2 δ_ 0 /π+δ^ 2 _ 0 /π^ 2, {{relies on the}} assumption that scattering phase, δ_ 0, is frequency-independent. Dependence of δ_ 0 on ω becomes crucial near the resonant condition, where the phase changes abruptly by π. In this limit, due to finite time spent by electron on a resonant level, the scattering is dynamic. We incorporate this time delay into the theory, solve the Dyson equation with a modified kernel and find that, near the resonance, A(ω) behaves as ω^- 3 / 4 |ω|. Resonant scattering off the core hole takes place in 1 D and 2 D in the presence of an empty subband above the Fermi level; then attraction to hole splits off a resonant level from the <b>bottom</b> of the <b>empty</b> subband.
