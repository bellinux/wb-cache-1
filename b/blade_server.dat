50|$|The {{popularity}} of <b>blade</b> <b>servers,</b> {{and their own}} appetite for power, {{has led to an}} increase in the number of rack-mountable uninterruptible power supply (or UPS) units, including units targeted specifically towards <b>blade</b> <b>servers</b> (such as the BladeUPS).|$|R

50|$|On some managed systems, notably <b>blade</b> <b>server</b> systems, {{the serial}} ports on the managed {{computers}} are not normally {{connected to a}} traditional serial port socket. To allow users to access applications on these computers via the serial port, the input/output of the serial port is redirected to the network. For example, a user wishing to access a <b>blade</b> <b>server</b> via the serial port can telnet to a network address and log in. On the <b>blade</b> <b>server</b> the login {{will be seen as}} coming through the serial port.|$|E
50|$|The SPARC T3 series servers {{include the}} T3-1B, a <b>blade</b> <b>server</b> module that {{fits into the}} Sun Blade 6000 system. All other T3 based servers are rack mounted systems.

50|$|<b>Blade</b> <b>servers</b> do not, however, {{provide the}} answer to every {{computing}} problem. One can view them {{as a form of}} productized server-farm that borrows from mainframe packaging, cooling, and power-supply technology. Very large computing tasks may still require <b>server</b> farms of <b>blade</b> <b>servers,</b> and because of blade servers' high power density, can suffer even more acutely from the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning problems that affect large conventional server farms.|$|R

5000|$|The first commercialized <b>blade</b> <b>server</b> {{architecture}} {{was invented}} by Christopher Hipp and David Kirkeby, and their patent (...) was assigned to Houston-based RLX Technologies. RLX, which consisted primarily of former Compaq Computer Corporation employees, including Hipp and Kirkeby, shipped its first commercial <b>blade</b> <b>server</b> in 2001. RLX was acquired by Hewlett Packard in 2005.|$|E

50|$|At {{the same}} time, the {{increased}} density of blade-server configurations can still result in higher overall demands for cooling with racks populated at over 50% full. This {{is especially true}} with early-generation blades. In absolute terms, a fully populated rack of <b>blade</b> <b>servers</b> is likely to require more cooling capacity than a fully populated rack of standard 1U servers. This is because one can fit up to 128 <b>blade</b> <b>servers</b> in the same rack that will only hold 42 1U rack mount servers.|$|R

50|$|Virtual Connect {{is a new}} Virtualization {{technology}} from Hewlett-Packard (HP) that de-couples fixed <b>blade</b> <b>server</b> adapter network addresses from the associated external networks so that changes in the <b>blade</b> <b>server</b> infrastructure and the LAN and SAN environments donâ€™t require a complex choreography among server, LAN, and SAN teams for every task. Using the built-in HP Virtual Connect Manager for small configurations or the HP Virtual Connect Enterprise Manager for larger environments, administrators can define a server connection profile for each <b>blade</b> <b>server</b> bay before a server is installed. This profile establishes the Media Access Control (MAC) addresses for all network interface controllers (NICs), the World Wide Names (WWNs) for all host bus adapters (HBAs), and the Fibre Channel SAN boot parameters along with their associated network uplink connections, and then associates them to a <b>blade</b> <b>server</b> bay so {{that even if the}} server is changed, the configuration and connection profile stay constant. When a new server takes its place, the same profile is associated and used by the new server.|$|E
