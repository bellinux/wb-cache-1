50|$|By {{the later}} {{decades of the}} 19th century, {{probably}} around 1880, the supply of these fine antique rugs from Persia was on the low side. Therefore, many of the merchants from Tabriz decided to establish workshops in Sultanabad to produce rugs for the western market. This region had a fine carpet weaving tradition and was a perfect place to set up looms and rug workshops. Sarouk is a village located 30 {{miles north of the}} city of Sultanabad (today called Arak). Sarouk is famous for weaving very heavy <b>body</b> <b>carpets.</b>|$|R

The refurbishment programme was completed in 2016.|$|R
25|$|Many of {{the auto}} {{component}} companies other than Maruti Suzuki started to offer components and accessories that were compatible. This caused a serious threat and loss of revenue to Maruti Suzuki. Maruti Suzuki started a new initiative under the brand name Maruti Genuine Accessories to offer accessories like alloy wheels, <b>body</b> cover, <b>carpets,</b> door visors, fog lamps, stereo systems, seat covers and other car care products. These products are sold through dealer outlets and authorized service stations throughout India.|$|R

25|$|In the 1980s and 1990s, Gweedore had a {{thriving}} factory industry, where up to 20 large companies were established producing rubber, <b>carpets,</b> <b>body</b> toning equipment and cleaning agents. However, by 2001 {{most of these}} companies had closed due to competition from Eastern Europe. Up to 4,000 jobs were lost, and this had a serious economic and social effect on Gweedore and surrounding areas. The factory in the townland of Crolly has been manufacturing porcelain dolls since 1939 under the name Crolly Dolls.|$|R

One night in October 1976, Mrs Hogg {{attacked}} her husband, hitting and kicking until he [...] "grabbed her round {{the neck and}} squeezed hard". Margaret Hogg suffocated and Peter wrapped her <b>body</b> in a <b>carpet,</b> tied it to a block of concrete, drove north overnight from Surrey and dumped the body in Wast Water lake in the Wasdale valley in the Lake District National Park, England.|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, he was twice convicted of {{burglary}} and served prison time in Delaware. He was also convicted of forgery of his parents' accounts, and {{spent more time}} in jail. In 1969, just nine days after being released from prison, he murdered his mother, Margaret Bloodgood (whom he later claimed to be his stepmother). According to reports, he rolled her <b>body</b> in a <b>carpet</b> and left it in Dismal Swamp, where it was soon found. His death sentence was ultimately commuted to life imprisonment after Furman v. Georgia, the 1972 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that the death penalty, as then administered, was unconstitutional.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — The {{automotive}} industry is currently spending {{millions of dollars}} on NVH work to develop new materials and damping techniques. The new design methods are starting to consider NVH issues throughout the whole design process. This involves integrating extensive modeling, simulation, evaluation, and optimization techniques into the design process to insure both noise and vibration comfort. New materials and techniques are also being developed so that the damping treatments are lighter, cheaper, and more effective. Some of the methods used to control noise, vibration, and harshness include the use of different carpeting treatments, the addition of rubber or asphalt material to car panels, gap sealant, and the injection of expandable foam into <b>body</b> panels. The <b>carpeting</b> treatments include varying types of foam padding combined with different weights of rubber-backed carpet...|$|R
25|$|Although {{isolated}} {{instances of}} carpet production pre-date the Muslim invasion of Spain, the Hispano-Moresque examples are the earliest significant <b>body</b> of European-made <b>carpets.</b> Documentary evidence shows production beginning in Spain {{as early as}} the 10th century AD. The earliest extant Spanish carpet, the so-called Synagogue carpet in the Museum of Islamic Art, Berlin, is a unique survival dated to the 14th century. The earliest group of Hispano-Moresque carpets, Admiral carpets (also known as armorial carpets), has an all-over geometric, repeat pattern punctuated by blazons of noble, Christian Spanish families. The variety of this design was analyzed most thoroughly by May Beattie. Many of the 15th-century, Spanish carpets rely heavily on designs originally developed on the Anatolian Peninsula. Carpet production continued after the Reconquest of Spain and eventual expulsion of the Muslim population in the 15th century. 16th-century Renaissance Spanish carpet design is a derivative of silk textile design. Two of the most popular motifs are wreaths and pomegranates.|$|R
25|$|Police then {{compared}} the orange carpet fibers found on Harrison's {{body to the}} ones in Buell's van, which was {{the same color as}} the one seen in 1982. The rear-view windows were of a different shape, although it was later revealed that they had been replaced. It was later concluded that the fibers on Harrison's <b>body</b> and the <b>carpet</b> in the van were a likely match and records from Sears indicated that Buell had purchased the same type of car seat that was once contained in the bag and box used to conceal the body. Paint found on the jeans near the dump site matched that on the outside of Robert Anthony Buell's residence as well. The jeans themselves were similar to other pairs that he owned. Spray paint in his garage was also matched to some that was present on the box. A fingerprint on plastic concealing Harrison's body did not.|$|R

500|$|The battle {{illustrated}} {{the power of}} concentrated artillery fire and the wastefulness of massed attacks by infantry against modern firepower. Hundreds of Chinese dead lay {{in front of the}} UN positions, with the valley floor [...] "almost covered with dead Chinese". Wilton later recounted that on [...] "the approaches to 2 RAR [...] the <b>bodies</b> literally <b>carpeted</b> the ground sometimes two deep". Later, it was estimated that Chinese casualties numbered between 2,000 and 3,000 killed, with the majority of them inflicted by the New Zealand gunners. At least nine Chinese battalions were believed to {{have been involved in the}} attacks. The fighting between 24–26 July had cost the Australians five killed and 24 wounded, while during the previous two weeks on The Hook 2 RAR had lost a total of 17 men killed and 31 wounded. It had been a bitter struggle to the very end and as a testimony to the ferocity of the fighting, the Royal Australian Regiment was subsequently granted the battle honour [...] "The Samichon". Many Australians were later awarded bravery decorations for their actions. The New Zealand gunners had played a crucial role in stemming the Chinese assault and during these final actions the commander of 163 Battery, 16 RNZA—Major James Spence—had positioned himself well-forward in order to effectively co-ordinate the indirect fires of his guns. Spence was subsequently awarded the Military Cross, while a member of his tactical party, Gunner Arthur Bolton, was later Mentioned in Despatches. In total over the three nights more than 23,000 rounds were fired by the Commonwealth Divisional Artillery.|$|R
25|$|Ridgway {{was arrested}} in 1982 and 2001 on charges related to prostitution. He became {{a suspect in the}} Green River killings in 1983. In 1984, Ridgway took and passed a {{polygraph}} test (quality control protocols later developed in the FBI after careful review determined that Ridgway actually failed his polygraph test), and on April 7, 1987, police took hair and saliva samples from Ridgway. Around 1985, Ridgway began dating Judith Mawson, who became his third wife in 1988. Mawson claimed in a 2010 television interview that when she moved into his house while they were dating, there was no carpet. Detectives later told her he had probably wrapped a <b>body</b> in the <b>carpet.</b> In the same interview, she described how he would leave for work early in the morning some days, ostensibly for the overtime pay. Mawson speculated that he must have committed some of the murders while supposedly working these early morning shifts. She claimed that she had not suspected Ridgway's crimes before she was contacted by authorities in 1987, and had not even heard of the Green River Killer before that time because she did not watch the news.|$|R
50|$|The {{origin of}} the {{ceremony}} {{can be traced back}} to the time when Sultan Ali (who was invited from Medina to Mashhad Ardehal more than 12 centuries ago) was killed in the city by his enemies. After his followers from the area arrived too late to help him they wrapped his <b>body</b> in a <b>carpet.</b> They then washed his body in a stream 150 meters away, before burying him. So for hundreds of years people in their thousands from the surrounding area and beyond (including Qum, Kashan, Nashlaj, Khomein, Mahallat, Saveh, Delijan, Golpayegan, Yazd, and many other towns) have flocked to Mashhad Ardehal to mourn and represent this event each year on the second Friday of the Iranian month of Mehr (early October), since this was the day Sultan Ali was killed. Some pilgrims even walk to the shrine from places that are large distances away. The crowd of pilgrims then leave the shrine carrying the remains of the same sacred carpet (that was used to wrap the body of Sultan Ali) on their shoulders, and while mourning, symbolically beat the remains of the carpet with long sticks to show their hatred towards the enemies of Sultan Ali and to demand revenge for his martyrdom, and also as a means to clean the carpet. Throughout the ceremony no outsider is allowed to touch the remains of the carpet. The pilgrims wear black clothes, sing religious songs, cry and beat their chests (as a sign of grief and mourning) and rotate their sticks in the air and rotate the carpet around the yard of the shrine. They then wash the carpet in a special stream of water near the shrine. The people believe the water then becomes holy, with many pilgrims applying the stream water upon their bodies and also bottling the water to take home with them. The pilgrims then return the carpet back to the shrine and the mourning ends at noon with a giant feast, where thousands are fed for free, before finally returning to their homes.|$|R
