50|$|Like other right whales, the North Atlantic right whale, {{also known}} as the {{northern}} right whale or <b>black</b> <b>right</b> <b>whale,</b> is readily distinguished from other whales by the callosities on its head, a broad back without a dorsal fin, and a long arching mouth that begins above the eye. The body of the whale is very dark gray or black, occasionally with white patches on the belly. The right whale's callosities appear white due to large colonies of cyamids or whale lice.|$|E
60|$|We {{continued}} our voyage {{for some}} weeks without any incidents of greater moment than the occasional meeting with whaling-ships, and more frequently with the <b>black</b> or <b>right</b> <b>whale,</b> so called in contradistinction to the spermaceti. These, however, were chiefly found {{south of the}} twenty-fifth parallel. On the sixteenth of September, being {{in the vicinity of}} the Cape of Good Hope, the schooner encountered her first gale of any violence since leaving Liverpool. In this neighborhood, but more frequently to the south and east of the promontory (we were to the westward), navigators have often to contend with storms from the northward, which rage with great fury. They always bring with them a heavy sea, and one of their most dangerous features is the instantaneous chopping round of the wind, an occurrence almost certain to take place during the greatest force of the gale. A perfect hurricane will be blowing at one moment from the northward or northeast, and in the next not a breath of wind will be felt in that direction, while from the southwest it will come out all at once with a violence almost inconceivable. A bright spot to the southward is the sure forerunner of the change, and vessels are thus enabled to take the proper precautions.|$|R

40|$|Intense whaling nearly {{abolished}} the North Atlantic <b>right</b> <b>whale</b> (Eubalaena glacialis) population. Present day {{threats to the}} species are collisions with vessels, entanglement in ﬁshing gear, and environmental variability. In this body of work we quantify the relationship between <b>right</b> <b>whales</b> and their prey, ricegrain sized crustaceans called copepods, and employ a spatial model to predict the potential distribution of <b>right</b> <b>whales</b> on a weekly basis. Time series datasets of <b>right</b> <b>whale</b> abundance and copepod concentration were analyzed to quantify the relationship between <b>right</b> <b>whales</b> and their prey. We found signiﬁcant relationships between <b>right</b> <b>whales</b> and copepods in Cape Cod Bay and the Great South Channel. These results tell us that accurate regional-scale models of copepod concentration {{can be used to}} infer the time and location of good <b>right</b> <b>whale</b> feeding conditions. The environmental niche of <b>right</b> <b>whales</b> was characterized using modeled prey abundance, sea surface temperature, chlorophyll concentration and bathymetry. With environmental data for the time and location of each <b>right</b> <b>whale</b> occurrence between 2002 and 2006, we trained and tested a model to predict <b>right</b> <b>whale</b> habitat suitability on a weekly basis. The accuracy of predictions was good, and the feasibility of our approach was veriﬁed. Results suggest that <b>right</b> <b>whale</b> habitat preferences are dynamic and that the distribution of prey is an important to the distribution of whales. We built an operational forecasting model of <b>right</b> <b>whale</b> habitat suitability in Cape Cod Bay, and used it to make weekly predictions for the year 2009. Modeled concentration of two <b>right</b> <b>whale</b> prey taxa (C. ﬁnmarchicus and Pseudocalanus spp.) sea surface temperature, chlorophyll and bathymetry were used as predictor variables. Predictions were veriﬁed with occurrences of <b>right</b> <b>whales</b> in Cape Cod Bay from 2009. Model output was used to assess the utility of moving shipping routes in Cape Cod Bay. The model was then projected, beyond the model-training region, into Massachusetts Bay. Results suggested that altering of shipping lanes in Cape Cod Bay is unlikely {{to reduce the risk of}} ship-strikes. A signiﬁcant positive relationship was found between predicted habitat suitability and the number of acoustic detections of <b>right</b> <b>whales</b> in Massachusetts Bay. We conclude that our modeling approach could be used to: 1) issue weekly forecasts of <b>right</b> <b>whale</b> habitat quality, 2) assess conservation actions, 3) guide survey effort in other regions, and ultimately to reduce human-caused risk to the <b>right</b> <b>whales...</b>|$|R

5000|$|Balaenidae [...] is {{a family}} of whales of the parvorder Mysticeti that {{contains}} two living genera. Historically, it {{is known as the}} <b>right</b> <b>whale</b> family, as it was thought to contain only species of <b>right</b> <b>whales.</b> Through most of the 20th Century, however, that became a much-debated (and unresolved) topic amongst the scientific community. Finally, in the early 2000s, science reached a definitive conclusion: the bowhead whale, once commonly known as the Greenland <b>right</b> <b>whale,</b> was not in fact a <b>right</b> <b>whale.</b> [...] The family of Balaenids, therefore, comprises the <b>right</b> <b>whales</b> (genus Eubalaena), and in a genus all to its own, the very closely related bowhead whale (genus Balaena).|$|R
5000|$|Members of Balaenidae {{can live}} over 70 years and were hunted {{extensively}} in the late 1800sfor their blubber.

40|$|A {{variety of}} marine mammal {{species have been}} shown to {{conserve}} energy by using negative buoyancy to power prolonged descent glides during dives.

Some of the most powerful fluke strokes observed in tagged <b>right</b> <b>whales</b> occur as they counteract this buoyancy as they start a dive. By contrast, <b>right</b> <b>whales</b> use positive buoyancy to power glides during ascent. <b>Right</b> <b>whales</b> appear to use their positive buoyancy for more efficient swimming and diving. However, this buoyancy may pose added risks of vessel collision. Such collisions are the primary source of anthropogenic mortality for North Atlantic <b>right</b> <b>whales,</b> whose population is critically endangered and declining. Buoyancy may impede diving responses to oncoming vessels and <b>right</b> <b>whales</b> may have a reduced ability to manoeuvre during free ascents.
