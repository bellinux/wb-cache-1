5|$|Michael decides {{the workers}} are {{stressed}} because they are reluctant to express their feelings, so he organizes a comedic roast of himself in the warehouse. Dwight tricks most of the employees into signing his apology letter by pretending it is a sign-in sheet, but Phyllis (Phyllis Smith) catches on and refuses to sign it. Each {{of the office and}} warehouse workers gleefully take jabs at Michael, who initially seems to enjoy the jokes, but grows increasingly uncomfortable and offended. When it comes time for him to roast his employees, Michael ends up storming out of the warehouse, visibly upset. After the roast, Michael takes a personal day (much to the concern of his employees, who start to feel <b>bad</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> scathing jokes towards Michael) and spends time at a playground to reflect, feeding pigeons by tossing whole slices of bread on the ground and making bird noises, despite the lack of birds in the winter weather. Dwight tricks Phyllis into signing his apology letter by bribing a mailman to ask her to sign for a fake package. Michael returns to the office, where he roasts each of his co-workers with one-liners. Stanley laughs heartily when Michael roasts him, breaking the tension. Michael tells his employees that they are the reason he got into the paper business, and they applaud him.|$|E
2500|$|The {{administration}} of President Franklin D. Roosevelt subjected Mellon to intense investigation {{of his personal}} income tax returns. The US Justice Department empaneled a grand jury, which declined to issue an indictment. Roosevelt hated Mellon, {{as the embodiment of}} everything he thought was <b>bad</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> 1920s; Mellon vehemently denied the charges. A two-year civil action beginning in 1935, dubbed the [...] "Mellon Tax Trial", eventually exonerated Mellon, albeit several months after his death.|$|E

In 1965, the Bacius {{set up their}} own magazine, International Poetry Letter – Mele (from the Hawaiian for [...] "song"), which sought to establish connections between Latino, French, American and Romanian literature. Although noted for the quality of its illustrations, Mele had a very minor circulation, with at most 300 copies per issue, all of them xerographed by Baciu's students.|$|E

2500|$|The {{origin of}} the term [...] "neuroethics" [...] has {{occupied}} some writers. Rees and Rose (as cited in [...] "References" [...] on page 9) claim neuroethics is a neologism that emerged only {{at the beginning of}} the 21st century, largely through the oral and written communications of ethicists and philosophers. [...] According to Racine (2010), the term was coined by the Harvard physician Anneliese A. Pontius in 1973 in a paper entitled [...] "Neuro-ethics of 'walking' in the newborn" [...] for the Perceptual and Motor Skills. The author reproposed the term in 1993 in her paper for Psychological Report, often wrongly mentioned as the first title containing the word [...] "neuroethics". Before 1993, the American neurologist Ronald Cranford has used the term (see Cranford 1989). [...] Illes (2003) records uses, from the scientific literature, from 1989 and 1991. [...] Writer William Safire is widely credited with giving the word its current meaning in 2002, defining it as [...] "the examination of what is right and wrong, good and <b>bad</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> treatment of, perfection of, or unwelcome invasion of and worrisome manipulation of the human brain".|$|E
2500|$|Hammond did {{return to}} {{complete}} his studies in 1905 and played a third season for Yost's football team. [...] In November 1905, Collier's Weekly published an article by E.S. Jordan making allegations of improprieties in Michigan's football program, including the recruitment of football players. [...] The recruitment of Hammond was alleged {{to be the most}} [...] "flagrant case of proselyting that has come" [...] to the attention of Western educators." [...] Jordan claimed that Hammond failed to get through his studies at Hyde Park High School, but [...] "was nevertheless taken to Michigan and given a brief tutoring by special instructors and was soon up in the requirements for entrance." [...] In an article published in the Chicago Daily Tribune, Hammond defended himself:"Tom Hammond feels <b>bad</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> attack on him. [...] He says he played at Hyde Park for three years, and that Hyde Park refused to allow any man to play who was back in his work. [...] He admits he left there in the junior year. [...] He admits he worked up under a tutor to enter here, and says he had to pass a stiff examination to get in. [...] He says his work in his classes now and in summer school will indicate the sincerity of his purpose." ...|$|E

The best housekeepers slip up sometimes. I thought maybe Miss Sterling was just learning to keep house and cook--that rabbit would surely make you think so--and I says to myself, 'Little lady, sugar or no sugar I'll stand by you,' and I raises up my bowl again and drinks the last drop of the lemonade.

He and she were an astonishing and satisfying contrast; in the midst of your amazement you felt the divine propriety of a woman like her wanting just such a wiry, smoky-complexioned, black-browed, black-bearded, bald-headed little man as he was.

60|$|He {{was in this}} {{successful}} mood {{when word}} came to him that Mrs. Lapham was going; Tom Corey seemed to have brought it, {{but he was not}} sure. Anyway, {{he was not going to}} hurry. He made cordial invitations to each of the gentlemen to drop in and see him at his office, and would not be satisfied till he had exacted a promise from each. He told Charles Bellingham that he liked him, and assured James Bellingham that it had always been his ambition to know him, and that if any one had said when he first came to Boston that in less than ten years he should be hobnobbing with Jim Bellingham, he should have told that person he lied. He would have told anybody he lied that had told him ten years ago that a son of Bromfield Corey would have come and asked him to take him into the business. Ten years ago he, Silas Lapham, had come to Boston a little worse off than nothing at all, for he was in debt for half the money that he had bought out his partner with, and here he was now worth a million, and meeting you gentlemen like one of you. And every cent of that was honest money,--no speculation,--every copper of it for value received. And here, only the other day, his old partner, who had been going to the dogs ever since he went out of the business, came and borrowed twenty thousand dollars of him! Lapham lent it because his wife wanted him to: she had always felt <b>bad</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> fellow's having to go out of the business.|$|E
