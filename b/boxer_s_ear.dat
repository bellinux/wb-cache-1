40|$|This review {{describes}} {{mean and}} turbulent flow and mass transport {{in the presence}} of aquatic vegetation. Within emergent canopies, the turbulent length scales are set by the stem diameter and spacing, and the mean flow is determined by the distribution of the canopy frontal area. Near sparse submerged canopies, the bed roughness and near-bed turbulence are enhanced, but the velocity profile remains logarithmic. For dense submerged canopies, the drag discontinuity {{at the top of the}} canopy generates a shear layer, which contains canopy-scale vortices that control the exchange of mass and momentum between the canopy and the overflow. The canopy-scale vortices penetrate a finite distance into the canopy, δe, set by the canopy drag. This length scale segregates the canopy into two regions: The upper canopy experiences energetic turbulent transport, controlled by canopy-scale vortices, whereas the lower canopy experiences diminished transport, associated with the smaller stem-scale turbulence. The canopy-scale vortices induce a waving motion in flexible blades, called a monami.

40|$|This paper {{highlights}} {{some recent}} trends in vegetation hydrodynamics, focusing on conditions within channels and spanning spatial scales from individual blades, to canopies or vegetation patches, to the channel reach. At the blade scale, the boundary layer formed {{on the plant}} surface {{plays a role in}} controlling nutrient uptake. Flow resistance and light availability are also influenced by the reconfiguration of flexible blades. At the canopy scale, there are two flow regimes. For sparse canopies, the flow resembles a rough boundary layer. For dense canopies, the flow resembles a mixing layer. At the reach scale, flow resistance is more closely connected to the patch-scale vegetation distribution, described by the blockage factor, than to the geometry of individual plants. The impact of vegetation distribution on sediment movement is discussed, with attention being paid to methods for estimating bed stress within regions of vegetation. The key research challenges of the hydrodynamics of vegetated channels are highlighted.

These studies were performed in part to unravel details of the previously observed isolated rupture of dye-labeled PC vesicles on glass (Johnson, J. M.; Ha, T.; Chu, S.; <b>Boxer,</b> <b>S.</b> G. Biophys. J. 2002, 83, 3371 - 3379), specifically to differentiate partial rupture, that is, pore formation and leakage of entrapped dye, from full rupture to form bilayer disks. In addition, the adhesion potential of PC vesicles on glass was calculated based upon the adhesion-driven flattening of adsorbed vesicles and a newly developed theoretical model. The vesicles were found to flatten considerably upon adsorption to glass (width-to-height ratio of approximately 5), which leads to an estimate for the adhesion potential and for the critical rupture radius of 1. 5 × 10 - 4 J/m 2 and 250 nm, respectively. Independent of vesicle size and loading with dye molecules, the adsorption of intact vesicles was observed at all concentrations below a threshold concentration, above which the formation of smooth lipid bilayers occurred.

40|$|Seismic wave {{propagation}} through two-dimensional core-mantle boundary (CMB) ultralow-velocity zones (ULVZs) is modeled using a global pseudospectral algorithm. Seismograms are synthesized for {{several types of}} ULVZ models to investigate {{the effect of these}} structures on SKS and SPdKS phases. One-dimensional models and two-dimensional models with different, quasi- 1 -D velocity structures on the source and receiver sides of the CMB provide a baseline for comparison with other 2 -D models. Models with finite length ULVZs are used to test the sensitivity of the SPdKS travel time and waveform to different portions of the P diffracted wave path. This test shows that SPdKS waves are only sensitive to ULVZs with lengths > 100 km. Our results give three tools for identifying and characterizing 2 -D ULVZ structures. First, dual SPdKS pulses indicate exposure to at least two separate CMB velocity structures, either different source and receiver-side CMB velocities or different adjacent velocity regions for which Pdiff inception occurs outside of and propagates into a ULVZ. Second, high-amplitude SKS precursors indicate a very “strong” (i. e., thick and/or large velocity perturbations) ULVZ. Hence, the absence of SKS precursors in most previous ULVZ studies indicates that very strong, sharp ULVZs are not common. Third, mean SPdKS delays relative to PREM constrain the minimum ULVZ strength and length combinations required to produce a given travel time delay.

40|$|The {{absorption}} and Stark effect {{spectra of}} the 1250 nm hand {{associated with the}} oxidized special pair (P+) in Rhodobacter sphaeroides reaction centers have been measured. The absorption spectrum in the 1000 - 1450 nm region is essentially identical whether P+ is generated by chemical oxidation or continuous illumination. The Stark effect on the 1250 nm band of P+ is relatively small compared to the Stark effect seen for the Qv transition of P. A quantitative analysis indicates that the change in dipole moment for the 1250 nm band is very small.

They occur in the Wasatch Mountains of northern Utah and have similar parent materials, altitudes, and slope percentages. Ostler soils have a dense cover of Gambel oak (Quercus gambelii) and occur preferentially on north aspects. Mule 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>ear</b> (Wyethia amplexicaulis) is the dominant vegetation on Hawkins soils, which are most frequent on south aspects. Erosion is prevalent on Hawkins soils because the mule 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>ear</b> does not adequately cover the soil surface during the fall, winter, and early spring. The dense oak woods and the litter cover on the Ostler soil protect it from erosion. Both soils dried sufficiently for cracks to develop in their clayey portions. The Ostler soil was drier, probably because it has more and longer transpiring vegetation than the Hawkins soil. The Ostler subsoil and the Hawkins solum both had cracks, slickensides, high clay contents, high COLE values, and smectite as the dominant clay mineral. These characteristics of high shrink-swell activity were most strongly expressed in the Hawkins soil. The Ostler subsoil clay was overlain abruptly by loam surface soil. The textural difference was attributed to lessivage, eolian contributions mixed with preexisting surface soil by soil animals, and in situ clay formation in the subsoil. Eolian additions were inferred from the presence of easily weathered silt and clay-size minerals in the Ostler A horizons and within the zone of mixing in the Hawkins soil. These minerals were not present or were less abundant in the Ostler subsoil and in the Hawkins C horizon. The formation of Hawkins soils (Vertisols) probably resulted from erosional exposure of the clay subsoil of Ostler soils or their precursors...|$|R

As canopy drag increases, the propagating front varies from the classic profile of an unobstructed gravity current to a triangular profile.

In the absence of directed attention, this "change deafness" [4] was greater for objects arising from a common location in space than for objects separated in azimuth.

The results reveal that the Stark spectrum of the Qx and Qy transitions of the pheophytins has a second-derivative line shape, indicating that the Stark effect is dominated by differences in the dipole moment between {{the ground and the}} electronically excited states of these transitions (¢í). The ¢í values for the Qx and Qy transitions of HB are small (¢í) 0. 6 - 1. 0 D f- 1), whereas that of the Qx transition of the active pheophytin HA is remarkably large (¢í) 3 D f- 1). The Stark spectrum of the red-most absorbing pigments also shows a second-derivative line shape, but this spectrum is considerably red-shifted as compared to the second derivative of the absorption spectrum.

J. Phys. Chem. A 2000, 104, 11 853]. This paper explains the physical origins of the observed Stark effects using two theoretical models and, in the process, computes several molecular parameters for each nitrile. A model with a single vibrational mode, developed with perturbation theory, is found to explain most of the experimental Stark effects. Because it cannot account for coupling between modes, which is ubiquitous and important for resonant vibrations and for combination mode absorption, another model is developed which considers multiple vibrational modes and three spatial degrees of freedom. It is found that difference dipole moments arise {{from a combination of}} mechanical anharmonicity and electronic perturbations of chemical bonds, where the two factors have about equal magnitudes for nitriles. Transition polarizabilities are dominated by the effects of electronic polarizability of the sample molecule, which alters the partial charges on atoms in an electric field. Stark effects of resonant transitions are found to be equal to linear combinations of the effects for the basis states, which explains an experimental observation. For overtone and combination transitions, Stark shifts are predicted to be the sums of the shifts of the component transitions. Absolute overtone intensities can be calculated from difference dipole results, which is experimentally verified. In summary, these theories largely explain the physical origins of observed vibrational Stark effects and can predict Stark effects {{for a wide variety of}} other systems...|$|R
40|$|Subpicosecond time-resolved {{absorption}} measurements at 77 K on two reaction center (RC) mutants of Rhodobacter capsulatus are reported. In the DLL mutant the D helix of the M subunit {{has been}} substituted with the D helix from the L subunit, {{and in the}} DLL-FYLFM mutant, three additional mutations are incorporated that facilitate electron transfer to the M side of the RC. In both cases the helix swap {{has been shown to}} yield isolated RCs that are devoid of the native bacteriopheophytin electron carrier HL (Chuang, J. I.; <b>Boxer,</b> <b>S.</b> G.; Holten, D.; Kirmaier, C. Biochemistry 2006, 45, 3845 - 3851). For DLL, depending whether the detergent Deriphat 160 -C or N-lauryl-N,N-dimethylamine-N-oxide (LDAO) is used to suspend the RCs, the excited state of the primary electron donor (P*) decays to the ground state with an average lifetime at 77 K of 330 or 170 ps, respectively; however, in both cases the time constant obtained from single-exponential fits varies markedly {{as a function of the}} probe wavelength. These findings on the DLL RC are most easily explained in terms of a heterogeneous population of RCs. Similarly, the complex results for DLL-FYLFM in Deriphat-glycerol glass at 77 K are most simply explained using a model that involves (minimally) two distinct populations of RCs with very different photochemistry. Within this framework, in 50 % of the DLL-FYLFM RCs in Deriphat-glycerol glass at 77 K, P * deactivates to the ground state with a time constant of 400 ps, similar to the deactivation of P * in the DLL mutant at 77 K. In the other 50 % of DLL-FYLFM RCs, P * has...|$|R
