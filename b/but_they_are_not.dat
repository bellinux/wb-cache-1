5|$|Cortinarius violaceus {{mushrooms}} are considered edible, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> choice; instead, the primary {{appeal of the}} species to mushroom hunters, according to Arora, is its beauty. Its similarity to some other (inedible or toxic) webcaps renders it risky to eat. The taste after cooking is reportedly bitter.|$|E

Workers are both diurnal and nocturnal, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> active throughout any 24-hour period. Low activity occurs during clear sunny days; however, colonies are extremely active shortly after rain.|$|E
5|$|A Project Leader {{is elected}} once per {{year by the}} developers. The leader has special powers, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> absolute, and {{appoints}} delegates to perform specialized tasks. Delegates make decisions as they think is best, taking into account technical criteria and consensus. By way of a General Resolution, the developers may recall the leader, reverse a decision made by the leader or a delegate, amend foundational documents and make other binding decisions. The voting method {{is based on the}} Schulze method (Cloneproof Schwartz Sequential Dropping).|$|E
5|$|As of December 2007, the TTB lists both Zinfandel and Primitivo as {{approved}} grape varieties for American wines, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> listed as synonyms. U.S. producers, therefore, must label a wine {{according to whether}} it is Zinfandel or Primitivo. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) proposed in 2002 that they be recognised as synonyms, but no decision on this proposal (RIN 1513–AA32, formerly RIN 1512-AC65) has been made.|$|E

5|$|Bivalves filter {{large amounts}} of water to feed and breathe <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> {{permanently}} open. They regularly shut their valves to enter a resting state, {{even when they are}} permanently submerged. In oysters, for example, their behaviour follows very strict circatidal and circadian rhythms according to the relative positions of the moon and sun. During neap tides, they exhibit much longer closing periods than during spring tides.|$|E
5|$|Fishers {{have also}} been {{captured}} and bred by zoos, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> a common zoo species. Fishers are poor animals to exhibit because, in general, they hide from visitors all day. Some zoos have had difficulty keeping fishers alive since they are susceptible to many diseases in captivity. Yet {{there is at least}} one example of a fisher kept in captivity that lived to be ten years old, and one case of a fisher living to be approximately 14 years old, well beyond its natural lifespan of 7 years.|$|E
5|$|In {{diaphragm}} cell electrolysis, an asbestos (or polymer-fiber) diaphragm separates a cathode and an anode, {{preventing the}} chlorine forming at the anode from re-mixing with the sodium hydroxide and the hydrogen formed at the cathode. The salt solution (brine) is continuously fed to the anode compartment and {{flows through the}} diaphragm to the cathode compartment, where the caustic alkali is produced and the brine is partially depleted. Diaphragm methods produce dilute and slightly impure alkali, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> burdened {{with the problem of}} mercury disposal and they are more energy efficient.|$|E

Also, he finds that Dong Zhuo is truly a monster, and starts a revolt in Wan Castle and cuts him down. Now in charge of Dong Zhuo's army, he defeats Cao Cao, Liu Bei, and Sun Jian in several campaigns, and takes over the land.|$|E
5|$|Sea otters {{spend much}} of their time grooming, which {{consists}} of cleaning the fur, untangling knots, removing loose fur, rubbing the fur to squeeze out water and introduce air, and blowing air into the fur. To casual observers, it appears as if the animals are scratching, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> known to have lice or other parasites in the fur. When eating, sea otters roll in the water frequently, apparently to wash food scraps from their fur.|$|E
5|$|The {{body of the}} long-toed {{salamander}} is dusky black with a dorsal stripe of tan, yellow, or olive-green. This stripe can also be broken up {{into a series of}} spots. The sides of the body can have fine white or pale blue flecks. The belly is dark-brown or sooty in color with white flecks. Root tubercles are present, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> quite as developed as other species, such as the tiger salamander.|$|E

5|$|There {{are also}} many {{cases where the}} remains of the fetus are found {{separate}} from the body of the mother, but expulsion was not through the birth canal, and separation of the two bodies may have been influenced by external environmental factors. The process of separation is so unusual that a specific term for the phenomenon may not have been proposed to the scientific community. These cases may have comparable results, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> cases of postmortem fetal extrusion.|$|E
5|$|Charlie {{has barely}} made it into his new flat in London when his father dies suddenly. Charlie hurries home for the funeral, where he finds the factory near bankruptcy. The factory makes good quality men's shoes, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> stylish and not cheap, and the market for them is drying up. Charlie is {{determined}} to save the factory and his father's legacy, though he has no desire to run Price & Sons himself. The workers, {{many of whom have}} known Charlie his entire life, do not understand why Charlie had moved away in the first place, and many are hostile and skeptical of the new management.|$|E

Ned and Maude are pleased {{to be a part of}} Springfield's history, and refuse Marge's offer of returning the deposit. Unfortunately, the house is destroyed seconds later when Li'l Bandit and Wiggum's police car crash through the house. Marge returns Flanders' down payment. Hutz, annoyed at the damage costs and especially by the return of the money, fires Marge. At the end of the episode, Homer takes Marge to the government unemployment office to collect a welfare check.|$|E

Readville is the terminus of the Fairmount Line, although a small number of rush hour trains continue through the station to and from the Franklin Line.

5|$|The Alexandrian texts were {{incorporated}} {{into the body of}} classical Greek literature that was preserved, catalogued and studied by scholars of the Hellenistic period. From then until the fourth centuryAD, copies of his orations multiplied and they were in a relatively good position to survive the tense period from the sixth until the ninth centuryAD. In the end, sixty-one orations attributed to Demosthenes survived till the present day (some however are pseudonymous). Friedrich Blass, a German classical scholar, believes that nine more speeches were recorded by the orator, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> extant. Modern editions of these speeches are based on four manuscripts of the tenth and eleventh centuriesAD.|$|E
