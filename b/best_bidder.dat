In particular, the optimal information acquisition point is the same, regardless of the other bidders' actions. This makes it natural to focus on symmetric, undominated equilibria, as in the Vickrey auction. An existence theorem for such a class of equilibria is presented. The paper also presents some results and numerical simulations that compare this sequential auction with the one-shot auction. 8 equential auctions typically yield more expected revenue for the seller than their one-shot counterparts. 80 the possibility of mid-auction information acquisition can provide an explanation for why sequential procedures are more often adopted...|$|R

[...] "First, let me suppose I make it a malt-house, Here I have {{computed}} the profit will fall t'us: There's nine hundred pounds for labour and grain, I increase it to twelve, so three hundred remain; A handsome addition for wine and good cheer, Three dishes a-day, and three hogsheads a-year; With a dozen large vessels my vault shall be stored; No little scrub joint shall come on my board; And you and the Dean no more shall combine To stint me at night to one bottle of wine; Nor shall I, for his humour, permit you to purloin A stone and a quarter of beef from my sir-loin. If I make it a barrack, the crown is my tenant; My dear, I have ponder'd again and again on't: In poundage and drawbacks I lose half my rent, Whatever they give me, I must be content, Or join with the court in every debate; And rather than that, I would lose my estate." [...] Thus ended the knight; thus began his meek wife: [...] "It must, and it shall be a barrack, my life. I'm grown a mere mopus; no company comes But a rabble of tenants, and rusty dull rums.[5] With parsons what lady can keep herself clean? I'm all over daub'd when I sit by the Dean. But if you will give us a barrack, my dear, The captain I'm sure will always come here; I then shall not value his deanship a straw, For the captain, I warrant, will keep him in awe; Or, should he pretend to be brisk and alert, Will tell him that chaplains should not be so pert; That men of his coat should be minding their prayers, And not among ladies to give themselves airs." [...] Thus argued my lady, but argued in vain; The knight his opinion resolved to maintain.

Dear madam, whene'er of a barrack I think, An I were to be hang'd, I can't sleep a wink: For if a new crotchet comes into my brain, I can't get it out, though I'd never so fain.

40|$|ABSTRACT We study auctions for a {{commodity}} in unlimited supply, e. g., a digital good. In particular we consider three desirable properties for auctions: * Competitive: the auction achieves a constant {{fraction of the}} optimal revenue even on worst case inputs. * Truthful: any <b>bidder's</b> <b>best</b> strategy is to bid the maximum value {{they are willing to}} pay. * Envy-free: after the auction is run, no bidder would be happier with the outcome of another bidder (for unlimited supply auctions, this means that there is a single sale price and goods are allocated to all bidders willing to pay this price). Our main result is to show that no constant-competitive truthful auction is envy-free. We consider two relaxations of these requirements, allowing the auction to be untruthful with vanishingly small probability, and allowing the auction to give non-envy-free outcomes with vanishingly small probability. Under both of these relaxations we get competitive auctions...|$|R
40|$|In a multi-attribute {{combinatorial}} double auction (MACDA), sellers and buyers' preferences over multiple synergetic {{goods are}} best satisfied. In recent studies in MACDA, it is typically assumed that bidders must know the desired combination (and quantity) of items and the bundle price.

This study presents a new packaging model called multi-attribute combinatorial bidding (MACBID) strategy and it is used for an agent in either sellers or buyers side of MACDA. To find the combination (and quantities) of the items and the total price which <b>best</b> satisfy the <b>bidder's</b> need, the model considers bidder's personality, multi-unit trading item set, and preferences as well as market situation. The proposed strategy is an extension to Markowitz Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) and Five Factor Model (FFM) of Personality. We use mkNN learning algorithm and Multi-Attribute Utility Theory (MAUT) to devise a personality-based multi-attribute combinatorial bid. A test-bed (MACDATS) is developed for evaluating MACBID. This test suite provides algorithms for generating stereotypical artificial market data as well as personality, preferences and item sets of bidders. Simulation results show that the success probability of the MACBID's proposed bundle for selling and buying item sets are on average 50 % higher and error in valuation of package attributes is 5 % lower than other strategies...|$|R

40|$|Following {{the hostile}} bid for Societe Generale in Belgium, {{companies}} have adopted poison warrants {{as a means}} of deterring raiders. However, they appear to circumvent many important rules of Belgian takeover legislation. It is demonstrated that poison warrants would mainly benefit larger shareholders in companies subject to attack. Two important sources of these benefits are the fact that the warrant technique implicity allows the large shareholders to make a partial offer and the fact that this partial offer may carry a low price. Because of this unequal treatment of the inside and outside control contestant, the <b>best</b> <b>bidder</b> need not win and hence efficiency improving takeovers need not take place. If a takeover does take place, the warrants shift a larger fraction of the gains toward the large shareholdersstatus: publishe...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a dynamic {{model for the}} real estate market. Households have stochastic behavior and compete for quasi-unique locations (real estate goods), which are assigned to the <b>best</b> <b>bidder</b> through an auction-type mechanism. The producers are modeled as maximizers of their profits over the long-term through the production of real estate assets, represented by {{the present value of}} future sales. It is assumed that the producers do not possess complete information about future levels of demand or prices. Rather, it is assumed that producers are myopic, meaning that they take the actual and historic prices in each period as the relevant information for their decision-making. A notion of equilibrium is used that adjusts prices given two situations: supply and demand surplus. In the supply surplus case, the prices are diminished and supply in the market is reduced until supply equals demand. In the case of demand surplus, the prices rise and demand diminishes (homeless households) until demand equals supply...|$|E
30|$|Interactions among {{resource}} agents, workflow agents, order {{agents and}} collaborative scheduling agents are through a mechanism that extends the well-known contract net protocol originally proposed by Smith (1980) by {{taking into account}} the dependency between workflows in supply chains. In contract net protocol, there are two roles an agent can play: manager or bidder. Four stages are involved to establish a contract between a manager and one or more bidders: (1) call for proposals (CFP): The manager announces a task to all potential bidders. The announcement contains the description of the task. (2) Submission of proposals: On receiving the tender announcement, bidders capable of performing the task draw up proposals and submit them to the manager. (3) Awarding of contract: On receiving and evaluating the submitted proposals, the manager awards the contract to the <b>best</b> <b>bidder.</b> (4) Establishment of contract: The awarded bidder may either commit itself to carry out the task or refuse to accept the contract by sending messages to the manager. For the latter case, the manager will reevaluate the bids and award the contract(s) to another bidder(s).|$|E
40|$|Abstract – The paper {{presents}} a procedure for forecasting the lead times of production orders {{on the basis}} of past actual lead time data. A customer for a particular production order will select the <b>best</b> <b>bidder.</b> It is rather risky to make a bid just {{on the basis of}} sales experience. A procedure is therefore proposed by which, {{on the basis of the}} actual lead times of operational and assembly orders processed in the company's workplaces in the past, the expected lead time of a planned production order can be forecasted. The result of the proposed procedure for forecasting lead times is an empirical distribution of possible lead times for a production order. On the basis of this distribution, it is possible to forecast the probable lead time of a production order, taking into account a confidence interval. Using the proposed procedure, the sales department can make a delivery time forecast for the customer of the planned production order. As an illustration of using the procedure for forecasting lead times of production orders, a case study is presented: lead time of production order for the "tool for manufacturing the filter casing " was forecasted; the tool is manufactured by a Slovenian company...|$|E
40|$|Public {{tendering}} {{implies the}} free concurrence and competition of bidding companies that certify their solvency, {{so that those}} companies proposing the most attractive bid, both technically and economically, are awarded the contracts and carry them out according to the same terms and conditions that they proposed. Generally, there is high competition in public tendering, both concerning the number of bidders (constantly increasing), {{as well as the}} profit margin (constantly decreasing). On the other side, handling the procurement process, there is a contracting authority that spends public money while trying to fulfill a particular socio-economic objective. This paper will take the contracting authority’s (auctioneer’s) point of view which is in charge of devising and implementing the awarding criteria, as well as choosing the <b>best</b> <b>bidder.</b> Particularly, this paper will focus on some aspects of the Economic Scoring Formula (ESF) design. The ESF constitutes a set of mathematical expressions that transform the economic bids submitted by the bidders into scores, so that, eventually, the bidders can be ranked and the best one selected. We will conclude that, despite apparently simple, how ESF are configured eventually have profound consequences on bidding behavior and some bidding results, like a higher or lower bid dispersion...|$|E

In the supply surplus case, the prices are diminished and supply in the market is reduced until supply equals demand. In the case of demand surplus, the prices rise and demand diminishes (homeless households) until demand equals supply. This equilibrium condition yields prices that are jumpy over time, resembling observations of inventories in the real estate market and the manufacture industry.
