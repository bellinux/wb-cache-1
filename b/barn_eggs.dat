50|$|Based on {{data in the}} European Commission's {{socio-economic}} report {{published in}} 2004, (prior to battery cages being banned in the EU) it cost €0.66 to produce 12 battery eggs, €0.82 to produce 12 <b>barn</b> <b>eggs</b> and €0.98 to produce 12 free-range eggs. This means that in 2004, one free-range egg cost 2.6 cents more to produce than a battery egg, and a barn egg cost 1.3 cents more to produce than a battery egg. The Commission’s report concludes that, if costs were to increase by 20%, which it says {{is the type of}} percentage increase in terms of variable costs that producers are likely to face as a result of switching to free-range, the industry will potentially suffer a loss of producer surplus of €354 million (EU-25).|$|E

40|$|Organic {{production}} {{benefits from}} fair competition and sustained consumer confidence. The latter {{can only be}} assured by paper trailing and verification assessments. Traditional analytical strategies for guaranteeing quality and uncovering adulteration have relied on {{the determination of the}} amount of a marker compound or compounds in a material and a subsequent comparison of the value(s) obtained with those established for equivalent material. Since it is unlikely to find a unique marker that allows discrimination between organic and conventional produce, selective fingerprinting (profiling) combined with chemometrics is a more promising approach. In this study, carotenoid High Performance Liquid Chromatography-Diode Array Detection profiling combined with k-nearest neighbour classification chemometrics was used to predict the production system (organic vs. non-organic) of chicken eggs. A proof-of-concept set (training set for the model) was composed of eggs from 24 organic farms, 12 free range, and 12 barn farms in the Netherlands. The identities of organic, free range, and <b>barn</b> <b>eggs</b> were predicted with success rates of 100 %, 100 %, and 84 %, respectively. The identity of eggs determined using an additional market test set with eggs from 12 organic, 12 free range, and 12 barn farms originating from the Netherlands and New Zealand resulted in correct classifications for 35 of the 36 samples. The results {{of this study indicate that}} this fingerprint approach is a promising tool for analytical verification of the production system of organic eggs. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Ascaris suum Goeze, 1782, {{the large}} roundworm, {{is a common}} {{parasite}} of pigs (Sus scrofa domestica Linnaeus, 1758) throughout the world. It is an important cause of economic loss to the pig industry and control of this parasite is difficult. In addition, A. suum is of zoonotic importance and therefore raises concerns related to manure disposal. There are reports describing the epidemiology of A. suum from {{other areas of the}} world but little is known regarding the situation in Saskatchewan. This thesis project examined aspects of the occurrence, epidemiology and control of this parasite in Saskatchewan. The project comprised four inter-related studies. First, two surveys investigating the prevalence and intensity of A. suum were conducted at a Saskatchewan abattoir examining livers and intestines of market pigs. Fifty-three percent of animals examined in these surveys displayed evidence of ascarid infection (adult parasites, hepatic lesions or both). Second, a postal survey to determine anthelmintic use in Saskatchewan during 1995 was sent to 5 80 pig producers selected based on annual pig production. Response rate was 33 % and represented 20 % of the province's annual market pig output. Of all respondents, 76 % treated some animals. Sows were treated most commonly (90 %) followed by weanlings (86 %), boars (75 %) and growers (67 %). Determination of a parasite problem was not based on quantitative measures of infection and treatment patterns {{did not appear to be}} based on known epidemiological information. Third, a study investigated the effects of seasonal temperature variations on the rate of development to infectivity of A. suum eggs in a Saskatchewan <b>barn.</b> <b>Eggs</b> from experimental egg cultures placed in the barn each month (July, 1997 to July, 1998) were monitored weekly for development to the infective larval stage assessed by bioassay. Development to the infective stage took from three to four weeks in summer to as long as 11 - 12 weeks in winter. Lastly, two groups of pigs were monitored from weaning to market by regular fecal examinations for A. suum infection. No pigs became definitively patent during the study but 92 % of animals examined post-mortem had liver lesions consistent with ascarid larval migration...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this working paper is to {{estimate}} marginal willingness to pay for eggs carrying different labels. Among other things these labels indicate environmental features and different levels of animal welfare for the hens that produce the eggs. The data on eggs {{are part of a}} very comprehensive panel data set covering household purchases of non-durables during a five year period. For each family a wide range of background characteristics are available. Detailed data on eggs are available during the one year period from July 1999 to June 2000 used in this working paper. Compared to simple statistics, such as the average market share of different egg types, econometric estimations make it possible to disentangle the effect of labels from the effects of e. g. differences in prices. Discrete models such as the multinomial logit make it particularly simple to estimate the willingness to pay for different characteristics of goods, in this case different labels. Had the purpose been to estimate substitution effects, a continuous model would have been used instead. The estimations are conducted using the new and flexible Mixed Multinomial Logit model (MMNL) also known as Random Parameter Logit (RPL). Mixed multinomial logit allows heterogeneity among households by letting the parameters of the household utility functions be drawn from a common distribution instead of restricting them to be identical for all households. Estimating the parameters of the distribution of the parameters of the utility functions yields not only a measure of the marginal willingness to pay for different types of eggs, but also a measure of the degree of heterogeneity among the households. The eggs are divided into battery eggs (‘buræg’), <b>barn</b> <b>eggs</b> (‘skrabe æg’), free-range eggs (‘fritgående’) and organic eggs (‘økologiske’) and the marginal willingness to pay for the three last types relative to battery eggs are estimated. The marginal willingness to pay for different types of eggs turns out to vary whit the chain of stores in which the purchase is made. Econometric estimations using store-level data reveals that customers in some stores (e. g. Superbrugsen) are generally willing to pay for labels indicating environmental and animal friendly production methods, while customers in other stores (e. g. Bilka) are reluctant to do so. Combining data from many different stores leads to contra-intuitive results caused by the high level of heterogeneity among customers, prices and variety in the different stores. It is found that models allowing the consumers’ evaluation of the different labels to vary with background characteristics, such as the geographical location of the household residence, are significantly better than models ignoring background variables completely. Models allowing the evaluation to vary with attitudes, such as attitude to branded goods, are also significantly better than the model ignoring these effects. The effect of the age of the main buyer is, in most cases, not significant. It is reasonable to expect the value of different labels to vary between households. Animal welfare may be very important to some households, but have little or no value in other households. These differences are perceived as ‘heterogeneity of preferences’ in the econometric model. The labels ‘barn eggs’ and ‘free-range eggs’ mainly indicates increased animal welfare, whereas the ‘organic’ label indicates a more environmentally friendly production as well as a higher level of animal welfare. Some households may also perceive the organic eggs as being healthier than other egg types because the hens are fed with organic feed. The heterogeneity of marginal willingness to pay for organic eggs can therefore be induced by differences in the perception and evaluation of at least three different attributes, whereas the heterogeneity of marginal willingness to pay for barn and free-range eggs is expected to arise only from differences in perception and evaluation of animal welfare. Data supports this hypothesis as the estimated heterogeneity of marginal willingness to pay is generally higher for organic eggs than for the two other egg types. ...|$|E

40|$|Avian {{communication}} {{has been}} traditionally {{believed to be}} mainly mediated by visual and auditory channels.

Olfaction has also been suggested {{to play a role in}} parent-offspring communication not only in the post- but also in the pre-hatching period. Volatile compounds produced during embryogenesis and passively released through the eggshell pores may indeed represent the only cue at parents' disposal to assess offspring quality, including the sex composition of their clutch before hatching. In turn, sex identification before hatching may mediate adaptive strategies of allocation to either sex. In the present study, we analyzed odour composition of <b>barn</b> swallow <b>eggs</b> incubated in their nest in order to identify any sex-related differences in volatile compounds emitted. For the first time in any bird species, we also investigated whether odour composition is associated with relatedness. The evidence of differences in odour composition among eggs containing embryos of either sex indicates that parents have a cue to identify their brood sex composition even before hatching which can be used to modulate their behavior accordingly. Moreover, odour similarity within nests may represent the prerequisite for kin recognition in this species...|$|R

40|$|Dioxins and dioxin-like (DL) {{polychlorinated biphenyls}} (PCB) are {{persistent}} organic pollutants that enter the body mainly by food intake. A small margin exists between current exposure levels in the human population and the levels causing biological effects.

40|$|The main {{objective}} of this work was to evaluate the interaction between selenium concentration in both commercial and Se-enriched eggs and other essential/toxic elements (Ca, Mg, Fe, Zn, Pb, and Cd), taking into account a possible synergic action of iodine. Commercial eggs were purchased from several sale points or directly from the producers (farmyard eggs). Fortified eggs were obtained by supplementing chickenfeed for 6 weeks with Se as sodium selenite (1. 0 microg/g Se) or Se plus iodine (1. 0 microg/g Se+ 3. 7 microg/g I). Se in experimental egg yolks significantly increased over the basic value by 39 % in the Se group and 61 % in the Se+I group, suggesting that I addition may enhance Se absorption. Levels of Se in commercial yolks were identical in free-range, <b>barn</b> or battery <b>eggs,</b> but significantly lower in farmyard and higher in organic eggs where the Se content approximated that found in Se fortified eggs. A significant reduction in Cd was observed in Se+I treated yolks compared to both control and Se alone diet, thus suggesting a high sensitivity of Cd to the detoxifying effect of Se combined with I. Furthermore, Se+I supplementation {{was associated with a}} significant Zn reduction, a finding which needs clarification to avoid attempts to maximize one component affecting the levels of other essential elements...|$|R

40|$|The Wildlife and Pollution {{contract}} {{covers a}} long-term monitoring programme {{to examine the}} levels of pollutants in selected wildlife species in Britain. The programme was started when there were serious concerns over the effects of organochlorine insecticides and organomercury fungicides on several birds and mammals. This early work demonstrated {{the effects of the}} organochlorines, and eventually contributed to the ban on their use in this country and abroad. The programme has measured levels of these compounds in predatory and fish-eating birds since then. Investigations have also been made into the levels of industrial polychlorinated biphenys (PCBs), following their identification as pollutants in 1966. Mercury levels, derived from both agricultural and industrial sources, have also been tracked. In addition, the contract supports a wildlife incident investigation service, which can examine the causes of unexpected mortality incidents (that are not obviously related to oil pollution or to agricultural pesticides). In recent years, investigations have been made into the effects of the newest generation of rodenticides on <b>barn</b> owls. Gannet <b>eggs</b> are regularly collected biennially from two colonies and, when available, from other sites; eggs were collected from only one site in 1997. No major incidents were investigated in 1997. As this programme is now the longest running of its kind anywhere in the world, the findings stimulate considerable interest internationally, as well as in Britain. Annual reports give an interim summary of results. Every three years these annual results are gathered together into a more substantial report (like the present one) in which they are integrated with previous findings. In addition, results are published periodically in the scientific literature. Recent key papers are listed in this report under sub-project summaries. ...|$|R
40|$|Functional foods enriched with folate may be {{beneficial}} {{as a means of}} optimizing folate status in consumers. We recently developed novel eggs enriched with folate through folic acid supplementation of the hen’s feed, but their potential to influence consumer folate status is unknown because the natural folate forms incorporated into the eggs may not necessarily be retained during storage and cooking. This study aimed to determine the stability of natural folates in folate-enriched eggs under typical conditions of storage and cooking. Total folate was determined by microbiological assay following tri-enzyme treatment in folate-enriched <b>eggs</b> and un-enriched (<b>barn</b> and free-range) on the day they were laid, after storage (up to 27 days) and after using four typical cooking methods (boiling, poaching, frying, scrambling) for different durations. On the day of laying, the folate content of enriched eggs was found to be significantly higher than that of un-enriched <b>barn</b> or free-range <b>eggs</b> (mean ± SD; 123. 2 ± 12. 4 vs. 41. 2 ± 2. 8 vs. 65. 6 ± 18. 5 µg/ 100 g; p < 0. 001). Storage at refrigerator and room temperature for periods up to the Best Before date resulted in no significant losses to the folate content of folate-enriched eggs. Furthermore, folate in enriched eggs remained stable when cooked by four typical methods for periods up to the maximum cooking time (e. g., 135 ± 22. 5, 133. 9 ± 23. 0 and 132. 5 ± 35. 1; p = 0. 73, for raw, scrambled for 50 s and scrambled for 2 min, respectively). Thus, natural folates in folate-enriched eggs remain highly stable with little or no losses following storage and cooking. These findings are important because they demonstrate the feasibility of introducing folate-enriched eggs into the diet of consumers as functional foods with enriched folate content. Further studies will confirm their effectiveness in optimizing the biomarker folate status of consumers...|$|R
40|$|Evidence is {{presented}} to indicate that: a) The cuticular layer of the shell is rarely present as an even covering at any stage in the laying year. So, {{its role as a}} first line of defence is questionable. b) The shell membranes do inhibit bacterial transfer to some degree, even when they are structurally disrupted; however, if the challenge is great enough, then their function as effective barriers is reduced. c) In the absence of the shell membranes, Salmonella enteritidis Phage type 4 does not move freely across the shell, but it is either facilitated or inhibited in its passage by structural variation in the true shell, particularly {{at the level of the}} mammillary layer. Statistical data support in most instances a significant and positive correlation between the presence of structural defects and bacterial transfer. d) In a three tier battery system, a tier effect exists with respect to ease of translocation of microoganisms, with eggs from the top tier being more susceptible, i. e. structurally inferior. e) The results confirm earlier work that shell quality declines with age, and extends this finding to show that this morphological deterioration is accompanied by a decreased resistance to bacterial movement. f) Patent gas exchange pores, whilst obvious portals for bacterial ingress, are in this respect of secondary importance to structural defects within the shell. Evidence is also provided to substantiate the assumption that birds, irrespective of strain, display diverse shell structural quality. One of the strains evaluated (strain B) was structurally better than the other (strain A), at the beginning and middle of lay, and was also more capable of withstanding bacterial challenge in all three laying periods tested. 4. The housing system can influence shell quality; thus <b>Barn</b> and Battery <b>eggs</b> were structurally superior to their Range counterparts, at the end of lay. 5. The tagging of Salmonella with immunogold markers proved to be a valuable technique, which allowed a more precise localisation of the bacteria within the shell's ultrastructure, as viewed by the Scanning Electron Microscope (S. E. M.). This method gave support to other findings in this work, confirming that bacterial transfer was specifically encouraged by late fusion and alignment of the mammillae and pitting occurrences, with the cone layer probably implicated in the process of penetration in vivo.
