As for the hippies in the county who may be upset at the depiction of hippies, I say, 'Tough shit, hippie.'" ...|$|E
5000|$|Food {{and eating}} were {{frequent}} themes of Satie's own extramusical humor. His poverty made him uncomfortably familiar with hunger at times, leading to his wry observation, [...] "It's odd. You'll find someone in every bar willing to <b>buy</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>drink.</b> No one ever dreams of presenting {{you with a}} sandwich." [...] According to his brother Conrad, the composer's appetite was gargantuan on those occasions when {{he was able to}} eat to his heart's content: he could devour a 30-egg omelette or 150 oysters in one sitting. His affinity for the bawdy, food-obsessed Rabelais is made clear in the Trois petites pièces montées.|$|E
50|$|Flirting can {{be sexually}} suggestive, which can {{intentionally}} elicit a sexual response from another person. Research has identified different motivations {{for engaging in}} flirting behaviors. There is flirting with a sexual motivation, which is done {{with a view to}} engaging in Human sexual activity and there is also flirting with a fun motivation, in which the interaction itself is the pleasurable part. An instrumental motivation of flirting behavior is flirting performed in order to accomplish an instrumental goal, such as getting someone to <b>buy</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>drink.</b> However, flirting can sometimes lead to unintentional responses. If the motivation behind sexually suggestive behavior is misinterpreted or miscommunicated, then a sexual response could be elicited where it is not wanted. If escalated, this can lead to sexual harassment in the workplace or sexual coercion in a relationship. In line with evolutionary explanations of sexually suggestive behavior, research has shown that females are more likely to consider the use of flirting as being for relational purposes, and males are more likely to interpret female flirting as having a sexual motivation.|$|E

5000|$|The Verve headlined the Main Stage on the Saturday night, {{opening with}} [...] "This Is Music" [...] and {{completing}} their set with [...] "The Drugs Don't Work", [...] "Lucky Man", [...] "Bitter Sweet Symphony" [...] and [...] "Love Is Noise". Richard Ashcroft {{referred to the}} area's main use as a racecourse when he informed the crowd: [...] "The dressing rooms are dead good, they've got pictures of the jockeys and the champions on the walls site is usually a racecourse. The funny thing is all the trainers have got all the same name over here. I guess if you've got the look... Anyway this if for Tony Soprano, Tony Montana and all 'The Rolling People'." [...] He then politicised [...] "Bitter Sweet Symphony" [...] by criticizing the United Nations - [...] "Shame on the United Nations, shame on the United Nations, the people of Zimbabwe need you" [...] - and dedicating it to Zimbabwe and all the slaves (including Cristiano Ronaldo who was only earning £120,000 per week). [...] Days later, Ashcroft was struck down by severe pharyngitis and a chest infection, forcing the band to cancel another festival appearance at the Italia Wave Festival in Livorno. At the end of The Verve's set at Oxegen, The Prodigy were still performing over on the O2 Stage whilst Manic Street Preachers had just finished headlining the Green Room. They opened with [...] "Motorcycle Emptiness" [...] and [...] "You Stole the Sun from My Heart" [...] and ended with [...] "If You Tolerate This Your Children Will Be Next" [...] in a set which also included [...] "The Masses Against The Classes", [...] "Autumnsong", [...] "Your Love Alone Is Not Enough" [...] and [...] "Nicky Wire's favourite pop song of 2007", [...] "Umbrella". A Welsh flag was draped across the stage throughout their set. [...] "A Design for Life" [...] was introduced with the following statement from frontman James Dean Bradfield: [...] "How many drinking songs {{do you think we}} have here? One, two, four or five? Well, give me a fiver and I'll <b>buy</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>drink.</b> This is a Welsh international drinking song".|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the role of}} function in representations of space by robots – that is, dealing directly and explicitly with those aspects of space and objects in space that serve some purpose for the robot. It is suggested that taking function into account helps increase the generality and robustness of solutions in an unpredictable and complex world, and the suggestion is affirmed by several instantiations of functionally conceived spatial models. These include perceptual models for the “on ” and “in ” relations based on support and containment; context-sensitive segmentation of 2 -D maps into regions distinguished by functional criteria; and, learned predictive models of the causal relationships between objects in physics simulation. Practical application of these models is also demonstrated {{in the context of}} object search on a mobile robotic platform. Acknowledgements I have many people to thank for all of the help, criticism, cooperation, encouragement, inspiration and (not to forget) financial support that has been instrumental in the writing of this thesis and the research and related work that has led up to it.
