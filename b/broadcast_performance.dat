One thought that [...] "such a medley of fearful discords could never be called music", while another opined that [...] " [...] should not cry for more Mozart, Haydn or Beethoven if modern composers would all give us sheer beauty like this".|$|E

500|$|Sir Adrian Boult's 1948 <b>broadcast</b> <b>performance</b> {{with the}} BBC Symphony Orchestra was {{recorded}} by the BBC, but not issued until 2009 when it was made available in MP3 form. The first issued recording of the complete symphony was Stokowski's Carnegie Hall performance with the New York Philharmonic and combined New York choirs on 9April 1950. Nearly two years before, in July 1948, the Hungarian-born conductor Eugene Ormandy had recorded the [...] "Veni creator spiritus" [...] movement at the Hollywood Bowl. Since Stokowski's version, at least 70 recordings of the symphony {{have been made by}} many of the world's leading orchestras and singers, mostly during live performances.|$|E

In regards to the extensive radio tour, Swift commented, [...] "Radio tours for most artists last six weeks. Mine lasted six months. That's because I wanted it to.

500|$|Despite its {{popularity}} {{as a stage}} work, Gianni Schicchi was not available as a recording until after the Second World War, a neglect described by a Gramophone reviewer as [...] "extraordinary". One of the earliest recordings, a Turin Radio 1950 <b>broadcast</b> <b>performance</b> conducted by Alfredo Simonetto, was praised for its lively presentation but was considered by the critic Philip Hope-Wallace to be [...] "too rough a piece of recording to be warmly recommended". By contrast, the 1958 recording under Gabriele Santini, with a cast including Tito Gobbi and Victoria de los Ángeles, was still being discussed nearly 50 years later as the classic performance, with Gobbi's singing at a standard rarely equalled. Among more recent recordings, that of the complete Trittico with the London Symphony Orchestra under Antonio Pappano (1998) has been generally recommended. There are numerous video recordings now available.|$|E
500|$|During 1948, amid many engagements, Ferrier {{performed}} Brahms's Alto Rhapsody at the Proms in August, {{and sang}} in Bach's Mass in B minor at that year's Edinburgh Festival. On 13 October she joined Barbirolli and the Hallé Orchestra in a <b>broadcast</b> <b>performance</b> of Mahler's song cycle Kindertotenlieder. She {{returned to the}} Netherlands in January 1949 {{for a series of}} recitals, then left Southampton on 18 February to begin her second American tour. This opened in New York with a concert performance of Orfeo ed Euridice that won uniform critical praise from the New York critics. On the tour which followed, her accompanist was Arpád Sándor (1896–1972), who was suffering from a depressive illness that badly affected his playing. Unaware of his problem, in letters home Ferrier berated [...] "this abominable accompanist" [...] who deserved [...] "a kick in the pants". When she found out that he had been ill for months, she turned her fury on the tour's promoters: [...] "What a blinking nerve to palm him on to me". Eventually, when Sándor was too ill to appear, Ferrier was able to recruit a Canadian pianist, John Newmark, with whom she formed a warm and lasting working relationship.|$|E
500|$|The {{generally}} positive {{reception of}} the premiere persuaded Arthur Bliss, then serving as the BBC's director of music, to arrange a <b>broadcast</b> <b>performance</b> of [...] the work. [...] This [...] took place on 10 January 1945 shortly after which, in February, Tippett conducted the work [...] at the Royal Albert Hall. [...] The radio broadcast had been heard by Howard Hartog, a music writer and publisher who just after the [...] war was [...] in Occupied Germany, attempting to re-establish the North German Radio Symphony Orchestra in Hamburg. As part of this endeavour he [...] decided to mount a performance of [...] A Child of Our Time, with Hans Schmidt-Isserstedt conducting. Because of his pacifism and record as a conscientious objector, Tippett was not allowed into the occupied zone and thus missed the performance. However, in 1947 {{he was able to}} travel to Budapest where his friend, the Hungarian composer Mátyás Seiber, had organised a performance by Hungarian Radio. The local singers' problems with the English text meant that the work was sung in Hungarian, which Tippett, who conducted, described as [...] "a very odd experience".|$|E

500|$|Wilson {{sued the}} BBC. The {{corporation}} vigorously defended its {{action on the}} grounds that the letter was justified criticism of a performer. Wilson questioned the letter writer's competence to pass judgement on his performance: while Wilson conceded that he used the [...] "intrusive H", as a legitimate ornament which his teacher, Jean de Reszke, inserted into several works, and admitted that he had used it at two points in his <b>broadcast</b> <b>performance,</b> neither of these occurrences had been pointed out in the letter. Furthermore, two of the letter's cited examples, [...] "Pilate's Wife" [...] and [...] "purple robe", did not appear in his part of the work at all. During the three-day court case several expert witnesses were called, including Clive Carey who brought as evidence a score annotated by de Reszke. The judge, Lord Hewart, urged the jury to be [...] "extremely liberal": after 45 minutes deliberation, the jury decided against the BBC and the letter writer, and awarded Wilson £2,000 damages. The BBC chose not to appeal and shouldered the entire cost: in an internal memo the BBC Director General, John Reith, observed that in such cases a British jury would tend to favour the individual, rather than a corporation, and that to appeal might appear an unjustified use of the BBC's monetary power.|$|E
2500|$|Verdi {{originally}} {{chose to}} write a brief orchestral prelude instead of a full overture for the opera. He then composed an overture of the [...] "potpourri" [...] variety to replace the original prelude. However, {{in the end he}} decided not to have the overture performed because of its—his own words—"pretentious insipidity". This overture, never used today, was given a rare <b>broadcast</b> <b>performance</b> by Arturo Toscanini and the NBC Symphony Orchestra on 30 March 1940, but was never commercially issued.|$|E

2500|$|The opera has {{not been}} {{frequently}} performed, {{although it has been}} given more frequently in recent times, as evidenced by recordings of many live staged or concert performances over the last fifty or more years; this indicates something of a growing interest in this opera. [...] For instance, there was a <b>broadcast</b> <b>performance</b> on 29 March 1951 in Italy with the RAI Orchestra and a staging as part of the 1969 Maggio Musicale Fiorentino in Florence, followed shortly thereafter by a 1971 performance broadcast on 11 June 1971 in Italy and given by the Orchestra and Chorus of RAI Torino.|$|E
2500|$|Twice at the Met, Nilsson {{sustained}} {{injuries that}} kept her from performing. In February 1971, she sprained her ankle during a performance of [...] "Elektra" [...] that resulted in cancellation of one performance (that {{was replaced by a}} historical performance of Fidelio starring Christa Ludwig). Nilsson recovered to sing the <b>broadcast</b> <b>performance</b> of Elektra on 27 February. More seriously, in March 1974 she fell and dislocated her shoulder during a rehearsal of Götterdämmerung. While recuperating in her hospital room at Roosevelt Hospital she said, [...] "other than my bruises and my black and blues I feel fine". Although able to sing Brünnhilde for the first two performances with her arm in a sling, her injury caused her to miss subsequent performances, including that season's Götterdämmerung broadcast. The New York Times review of the production's 8 March opening night is reprinted in the Metropolitan Opera Archives.|$|E
