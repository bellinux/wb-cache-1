40|$|The {{determination}} of the necessary amount of water {{is one of the}} main parameters of an agriculture irrigation system. One of the efficient consequences of the measurements of the system is the increase of productivity, and therefore the profitable advantage of it. The satisfactory amount of water is therefore a very important condition for the growing accomplishment of the plant causing the production, with fewer costs. The aim of this work is the development of a mathematical model, based on the Fuzzy Theory, to determine the stream of latent heat, having as a result the calculation of the transpiration dissipated that defines the necessary amount of water for the cultivations of plants in protected environments; intending above all the balance of water usage and electricity in the agriculture activity. This model can be used in the implementation of a system that controls the outflowing of irrigations, determining the time and volume of water that is necessary for the furnishing of it. The required amount of water for the supplement of the system is the gathered through the {{determination of}} the stream of latent heat, for its highness is the equivalent to the volume of water transpired by the plant. The model adopts three variables to begin with, which are: the <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>solar</b> <b>radiation,</b> stream of the soil heat and the air temperature, which are the amounts that are measured by the installed equipments in the planted area. Through this model is possible to determine the stream of latent heat (LE), having it as the variable of exit of the model. To have this model validated there were used data, that were obtained in the experiment that was done by the cultivation of Euruca Sativa L., in an incubator covered by polyethylene at the Department of Science, at Faculdade de Ciências Agrônomicas and the results were obtained trough simulations that were done in the Laboratory of this Institution [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Forests play an {{important}} role in regulating the global climate through storing carbon that would otherwise be released as CO 2 to the atmosphere, and affecting the global energy <b>balance</b> through absorption <b>of</b> <b>solar</b> <b>radiation.</b> Forests are also affected directly by the impact of increased CO 2 levels and temperatures on ecosystem processes, and indirectly by human responses seeking to mitigate the net emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) or adapt to new climates. This paper attempts to assess the significance of these different aspects, within the context of poverty reduction. It provides a brief assessment of the global role of deforestation on net global GHG emissions; assesses the positive and negative direct effects of climate change on forest productivity, forest disturbance, carbon sequestration, water and air quality, biodiversity and cultural services; and discusses the indirect effects on forestry of human responses to minimise net GHG emissions, through new markets, other land use change, and global, national and local initiatives...|$|R
40|$|We {{present an}} {{adiabatic}} {{model of the}} earth's atmosphere that describes the thermal behavior observed under the greenhouse effect. The adiabatic regime assumes an average distribution of thermodynamic variables in the atmosphere, which depend only on altitude. Non radiative thermal contributions are included by adjusting the adiabatic coefficient, such that the thermal lapse rate coincides with the measured value in the tropics, equal to 6. 5 K/km. Global warming is derived from an energetic <b>radiation</b> <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> the incoming <b>solar</b> <b>radiation,</b> and radiations from the earth's ground and troposphere. We assume the increase of CO 2 concentration in {{the atmosphere in the}} industrial era, as the main cause of global warming. Using the concept of radiative forcing, we derived expressions for the tropospheric emissivity as a function of CO 2 concentration. Moreover, we established a simple expression to describe the lapse rate behavior with increasing CO 2 concentration in the troposphere. Finally, we discuss some experimental techniques for the detection of global warming in the next decades. © by the Sociedade Brasileira de Física...|$|R

This paper presents some idea of creating energy efficient building envelope. The focus is put on reduction of heat transfer through it. Different structures of external walls are analyzed. In high latitude countries walls should be characterized by high thermal resistance and high thermal capacity (good storage ability). In the paper traditional multilayer wall structures with specific paints on external wall surfaces are analyzed. Paints are characterized by different solar absorptivity. Also modern structures with the Phase Change Materials are analyzed. In simulation study it was assumed that PCMs are applied in a form of the light thermal mass panels that are integrated with the external wall structure. Mathematical model of dynamics of a building has been developed. In the paper stress has been put on energy transfer through walls of different structures. The model takes into account the influence <b>of</b> <b>solar</b> <b>radiation</b> on energy <b>balance,</b> including availability <b>of</b> <b>solar</b> <b>radiation</b> on walls <b>of</b> different location (inclination and orientation).

Há vários anos, no Brasil, a radiação solar global vem sendo monitorada por actinógrafos, com alguns pesquisadores duvidando da confiabilidade destes dados, comparando o sensor deste instrumento, que é constituído por placa bimetálica, com o do piranômetro elaborado com termopilha. Neste trabalho, compara-se as medidas da radiação solar global, monitorada por um actinógrafo, e por um piranômetro da Kipp e Zonen (modelo CM 3) instrumento de maior precisão, em diferentes condições de cobertura do céu,.

To better understand carbon and nutrient dynamics, {{it is important}} to know the contribution <b>of</b> <b>solar</b> <b>radiation</b> to leaf litter decomposition of different arid-zone species. Here we investigated: (1) whether such contribution varies among plant species at given irradiance regime, (2) whether interspecific variation in such contribution correlates with interspecific variation in the decomposition rate under shade; and (3) whether this correlation can be explained by leaf traits. We conducted a factorial experiment to determine the effects <b>of</b> <b>solar</b> <b>radiation</b> and environmental moisture for the mass loss and the decomposition constant k-values of 13 species litters collected in Northern China. The contribution <b>of</b> <b>solar</b> <b>radiation</b> to leaf litter decomposition varied significantly among species. <b>Solar</b> <b>radiation</b> accelerated decomposition in particular in the species that already decompose quickly undershade.
