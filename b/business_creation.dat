40|$|In 2004, 41 Zones Franches Urbaines (ZFU) have {{replaced}} less generous Zones de Redynamisation Urbaine (ZRU). ZFUs are particularly generous Enterprise Zones schemes in which establishments are exempted from all taxes and social contributions for 5 years. A {{first wave of}} ZFUs was zoned in 1997, followed by a second one in 2004 and a third one in 2006. In spite {{of the cost of}} such policies (the net cost of the second-wave ZFUs was around 125 million euros in 2005), the impact has never been assessed by econometricians. In this study, we aim to evaluate the net effect of the ZFU policy on both employment and <b>business</b> <b>creations,</b> using the transformation of less generous ZRUs into ZFUs in 2004. We use micro data on establishments and jobs at an infra-municipal scale. Differences-in-differences as well as standard propensity score matching are used to try to take selection bias into account. We finally identify a significantly positive effect on both <b>business</b> <b>creations</b> and employment. Yet, these effects are weak especially when compared to the magnitude of the costs. local employment, local policies, enterprise zones, evaluation...|$|R

To consider the importance of local taxes we build a Poisson model to explain the number of <b>business</b> <b>creations</b> observed in a given municipality. First results suggest that there are unobserved factors driving firm creation that are positively correlated with the level of local taxes. To deal with this potential source of endogeneity, we present an approach close to Regression Discontinuity Design. We find that, everything else being equal, higher local taxes actually tend to deter firms from setting up in a given zone but the effect is weak. Copyright � 2008 The Author(s). ...|$|R
