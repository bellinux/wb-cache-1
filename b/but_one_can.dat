5|$|Although Hermes o Logios was {{the most}} {{important}} publication for the transmission of progressive ideas to the Greek people, which should ultimately lead to the emancipation and independence, there was hardly any information of signs of an ongoing revolution, at least on the surface. There was the Austrian censure to be reckoned with, as the reactionary minister Klemens von Metternich and his secret police kept a very close eye on the activities of the local Greek community. The lack of items on politics, polity, law and social structures does not indicate an immanent revolution. Several editors were also members of the patriotic organization Filiki Etaireia and staunch supporters of the struggle for independence, <b>but</b> <b>one</b> <b>can</b> hardly maintain that this fervent patriotism is reflected in the subjects treated inside the periodical. Even in the last years, {{on the eve of the}} Greek War of Independence, in the fields of philology, sciences, philanthropy, etc., nothing out of the ordinary was published. On the other hand, there is no doubt that the contributors of Hermes o Logios dreamed of the liberation of the Greek nation and of an independent state.|$|E

25|$|In modern usage, {{there are}} six basic {{trigonometric}} functions, tabulated here with equations that relate them to one another.

25|$|Applying these {{concepts}} {{to a whole}} sequence is basic to higher strategy. If Black starts a sequence that properly ends in an even number of plays, Black retains sente in doing this. If Black starts a sequence that properly ends after an odd number of plays, Black loses sente and takes gote. Accepting gote should only be in return for some profitable exchange. Correct play in the yose (endgame) can consist of playing available sente sequences, and then taking the largest gote sequence on the board, though that description is a simplification. A reverse sente play is a special type of gote play, preventing the opponent from making some sente move. The relative value of reverse sente plays depends on the overall position, <b>but</b> <b>one</b> <b>can</b> count it as twice the value {{of what it would}} be if purely gote.|$|E
25|$|ISO/IEC 6937:2001, Information {{technology}} — Coded {{graphic character}} set for text communication — Latin alphabet, is a multibyte extension of ASCII, or rather of ISO/IEC 646-IRV. It {{was developed in}} common with ITU-T (then CCITT) for telematic services {{under the name of}} T.51, and first became an ISO standard in 1983. Certain byte codes are used as lead bytes for letters with diacritics (accents). The value of the lead byte often indicates which diacritic that the letter has, and the follow byte then has the ASCII-value for the letter that the diacritic is on. Only certain combinations of lead byte and follow byte are allowed, and there are some exceptions to the lead byte interpretation for some follow bytes. However, that no combining characters at all are encoded in ISO/IEC 6937. <b>But</b> <b>one</b> <b>can</b> represent some free-standing diacritics, often by letting the follow byte have the code for ASCII space.|$|E

500|$|While mass-classifiers do not {{necessarily}} bear any semantic relationship to the noun {{with which they are}} used (e.g. box and book are not related in meaning, <b>but</b> <b>one</b> <b>can</b> still say [...] "a box of books"), count-classifiers do. The precise nature of that relationship, however, is not certain, since there is so much variability in how objects may be organized and categorized by classifiers. Accounts of the semantic relationship may be grouped loosely into categorical theories, which propose that count-classifiers are matched to objects {{solely on the basis of}} inherent features of those objects (such as length or size), and prototypical theories, which propose that people learn to match a count-classifier to a specific prototypical object and to other objects that are like that prototype.|$|E
500|$|The historiography {{is often}} {{positive}} toward Caxias and several historians have ranked {{him as the}} greatest Brazilian military officer. To historian Nelson Werneck Sodré, he was [...] "not only the greatest military commander of his continent , in his time, but [...] a great politician". Moreover, Caxias was [...] "—more than D. PedroII—the Empire." [...] Francisco Doratioto said that the duke [...] "in Paraguay had doubts, pride, resentment, and made mistakes; in short, {{he was a real}} character ... Caxias, however, was able to rise above his limitations, imposed on himself great personal sacrifices and incorporated the responsibility of accomplishing the objective... In this context, Caxias was, indeed, a hero; he carried with him, it is true, social and political prejudices of his time, <b>but</b> <b>one</b> <b>can</b> not demand from the past the observance of present-day values." ...|$|E
500|$|Kant's Grundlegung zur Metaphysik der Sitten (1785) expounded a moral {{system based}} on the {{categorical}} imperative, one formulation of which is: [...] "Act only according to that maxim through which you can {{at the same time}} will that it become a universal law." [...] Rational agents must act on [...] "principles of pure rational agency," [...] writes Moore; that is, principles that regulate all rational agents. But Williams distinguished between thinking and acting. To think rationally is to think in a way compatible with belief in the truth, and [...] "what is takes for one to believe the truth is the same as what it takes for anyone else to believe the truth," [...] writes Moore. <b>But</b> <b>one</b> <b>can</b> act rationally by satisfying one's own desires (internal reasons for action), and what it takes to do that may not be what it takes for anyone else to satisfy theirs. Kant's approach to treating thinking and acting alike is wrong, according to Williams.|$|E

500|$|Visual {{effects were}} {{delivered}} by London's Moving Picture Company (MPC), and {{were applied to}} the 1,000 or so shots in the film, {{though most of the}} effects simply painted out puppet supports and similar set equipment. Some visual effects elements—groups of birds and butterflies, were created completely in CG, though others were composited as visual effects from real-life elements. Pete Kozachik explained that the trick for shooting the characters by themselves was obtaining visually interesting shots that would dependably support the director's storytelling, saying: [...] "The challenge is keeping the action clear and simple with lighting and composition. There's a discipline to clear storytelling with these puppets. You want to be abstract, <b>but</b> <b>one</b> <b>can</b> easily go overboard with these critters because they aren't as familiar to the audience as real humans. The characters don't necessarily translate the same as if you're shooting a real person. You have to consciously balance arty atmosphere and graphic clarity so as to not confuse the audience about what it is they're looking at." ...|$|E
