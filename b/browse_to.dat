500|$|The Trash (or [...] "Wastebasket" [...] in the British version) empties {{when the}} Finder terminates. If MultiFinder is not running, this occurs {{as soon as}} an {{application}} launches. Icons on the desktop in System 6 are not organized into a single folder, as in later operating systems. Instead, the system records whether each file is on the desktop or not. This is inefficient and confusing, as the user cannot <b>browse</b> <b>to</b> the desktop in applications besides the Finder, even within the standard Open and Save As dialog boxes. Furthermore, these dialogs are primitive, mostly unchanged since 1984. The lack of aliases, shortcuts to files, was another limitation of file management on System 6. Custom file and folder icons are also not supported. These problems were all remedied in System 7.|$|E
60|$|To a stranger, {{and perhaps}} {{also to the}} inmates, the idea of gloom about the place was greatly {{increased}} {{by the absence of}} any garden or lawn near the house. Immediately in front of the mansion, and between it and the park, there ran two broad gravel terraces, one above another; and below these the deer would come and <b>browse.</b> <b>To</b> the left of the house, at nearly {{a quarter of a mile}} distant from it, there was a very large garden indeed,--flower-gardens, and kitchen-gardens, and orchards; all ugly, and old-fashioned, but producing excellent crops in their kind. But they were away, and were not seen. Oat flowers were occasionally brought into the house,--but the place was never filled with flowers as country houses are filled with them now-a-days. No doubt had Lady Scroope wished for more she might have had more.|$|E

50|$|Another {{reason for}} this change in diet and habitat {{is that in the}} winter, the more open areas of the elks’ habitat are covered in snow. This can {{restrict}} movement and therefore make the elk more vulnerable to becoming prey to the carnivores in the area when they cannot easily escape. So these snowy areas encourage elk to move to under the trees, where the branches act as a cover from the snow. This move will also cause them {{to increase the amount of}} browsing time, when snow is heavy, compared to normal <b>browse</b> <b>to</b> graze ratios.|$|E

50|$|In {{the early}} stages of the Openclipart project, a website was created that lacked {{thumbnails}} and was hard to <b>browse.</b> <b>To</b> help propagate the images in the library, downloadable Openclipart packages were released. These packages were available directly from the Openclipart website, or as an add-on for various Linux distributions including Fedora, or an NSIS installer for Windows. Each package included most of the clipart to date and were manually sorted into categories, a laborious process. The Openclipart package version 0.20 was released in 2010. The Openclipart packages received only a few more incremental updates during 2010, mostly for seasonal clipart.|$|E
50|$|There {{are various}} open access {{aggregators}} that index open access journals or articles. ROAD synthesizes information about open access journals {{and is a}} subset of the ISSN registry. Users may <b>browse</b> <b>to</b> find open access journals by country or by subject. SHERPA/RoMEO lists international publishers that allow the published version of articles to be deposited in institutional repositories. The Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ) contains over 8,000 open access journals of varying open access policies that scholars can search and browse. The Open Archives Initiative (OAI) lists 2937 conforming repositories. Searching each open access repository individually is impractical. The resources in these repositories can be harvested, using the OAI Protocol and aggregated into online systems which in-turn provide access to millions of resources from a single online location.|$|E

50|$|Silverlight 2 {{also allows}} limited {{filesystem}} access to Silverlight applications. It {{can use the}} operating system's native file dialog box to <b>browse</b> <b>to</b> any file (to which the user has access). The file is sanitized of path information, to prevent the application from getting access to information such as user name, and can be opened only in read-only mode. For local storage of data, Silverlight provides isolated local storage (isostorage), namely, outside the browser cache, in a folder hidden inside the private user-profile folder. It is set to 1 MB per URL by default, but this can be changed by the user. Data stored by a Silverlight application in the isostorage is identified by the URL from which it loads, and can be accessed by that application only. All instances of Silverlight share the same isostorage, so all instances of the same Silverlight application can share the saved data, {{even if they are}} running on different browsers.|$|E
5000|$|Agricultural {{practices}} on them are primarily directed toward providing forage for wintering geese. Refuge cropland use is planned and implemented to produce at least 150000 lb of [...] "hot foods", and about 175000 lb of <b>browse</b> <b>to</b> meet the forage requirements of geese, ducks, {{and other wildlife}} for the critical period of December and January. Approximately 700 acre of the refuge are planted with winter wheat, millet, and corn. These crops are grown to {{be made available to}} wintering waterfowl and other wildlife from October through February. White-tailed deer also utilize these areas for food and cover. Its personnel and one cooperative farmer plant and manage about 600 acre annually, mostly in wheat, for wildlife including geese, deer, and turkey. Moist Soil Units (MSU) are managed to provide habitat for waterfowl, long-legged wading birds and other shorebirds. Water levels are lowered during spring migrations to provide forage for shorebirds passing through the area. During summer, the MSUs are drained to allow vegetation to grow. Reflooding occurs during late summer and early fall for wintering waterfowl that arrive beginning in late August. Up to 70,000 great white pelicans use refuge waters during their annual spring and fall migrations.|$|E
50|$|Gorillas are {{dedicated}} herbivores that {{spend much of}} their day extracting and processing fibrous plant foods. Opportunities to perform feeding-related behaviors are therefore likely to {{have a significant impact on}} the welfare of gorillas in zoos. Increasing the amount of browse, or leafy branches, available to the gorillas may be one way to increase feeding opportunities, but browse can be difficult to obtain in a seasonal environment. The Detroit Zoo recently invested in a freezer for <b>browse</b> <b>to</b> increase the availability of this valuable resource during the winter months. Using frozen mulberry harvested over the previous summer, we investigated the impact of browse availability on feeding-related and social behaviors in the three silverbacks living together as a bachelor group at the Detroit Zoo. We systematically manipulated the amount of browse and alfalfa hay available and measured its effects on the gorillas’ behavior. We also collected fecal and saliva samples to analyze hormonal indicators of welfare. Data analysis indicated that when more browse was available, the gorillas spent more time processing food, displayed less agonistic behavior, and were more active. We also examined fecal glucocorticoid metabolites as a possible measure of stress, as well as C-reactive protein, a salivary biomarker for inflammation. These analyses helped to shed light on the physiological changes accompanying the behavioral differences we observed in relation to browse availability. The results of this investigation will be used to inform the management of the gorillas at the Detroit Zoo and in other zoological parks.|$|E
