5|$|Henry VIII <b>broke</b> <b>from</b> {{communion with}} the Catholic Church, over issues {{relating}} to his divorce, under the Acts of Supremacy in 1534 which proclaimed the monarch head of the Church of England. In contrast with much of European Protestantism, {{the roots of the}} split were more political than theological. He also legally incorporated his ancestral land Wales into the Kingdom of England with the 1535–1542 acts. There were internal religious conflicts during the reigns of Henry's daughters, Mary I and Elizabeth I. The former took the country back to Catholicism while the latter <b>broke</b> <b>from</b> it again, forcefully asserting the supremacy of Anglicanism.|$|E

5000|$|... eStat.cz started it's {{internet}} television in 2008. Some media {{called it a}} television of the Civic Democratic Party. eStat.cz television was used by Mirek Topolánek and Pavel Bém. Ivo <b>Brokeš</b> <b>from</b> eStat.cz stated that politicians from other parties can use it too.|$|R
50|$|The {{concept for}} the song came around just after Shura <b>broke</b> away <b>from</b> {{recording}} with Hiatus, a music producer called Cyrus Shahrad. She <b>broke</b> away <b>from</b> the band on a temporary basis {{so that she could}} be able to build up her songwriting skills as well as studying at university.|$|R
5|$|In Jamaica, heavy {{rainfall}} triggered widespread street flooding, forcing nearly all businesses in Kingston to close {{for the duration}} of the storm. Along the coast, several ships <b>broke</b> <b>from</b> their moorings; one of them struck a wharf, damaging another vessel, and was scuttled to prevent further destruction.|$|E
5|$|In May 1947 {{the artistic}} {{collaboration}} between Hergé and Jacobs ended after an argument. Hergé had been {{jealous of the}} immediate success of Jacobs' Blake and Mortimer series, and had turned down Jacobs' request that he be credited as co-creator of the new Adventures of Tintin. That same month, Hergé <b>broke</b> <b>from</b> his manager, Thiery, after discovering that the latter had been siphoning off money for himself.|$|E
5|$|The Rega Planar 3, {{together}} with its successors, the P3 and RP3, {{is a well-known}} budget audiophile turntable by British hi-fi manufacturer, Rega Research available since 1977.

5|$|At {{the south}} end of the ground, behind one goal, the Park End Stand backs onto Walton Lane which borders Stanley Park. The name of the stand was {{originally}} the Stanley Park End but it's commonly referred to as the Park End. The single tiered stand <b>broke</b> <b>from</b> the multi-tiered tradition of Goodison Park. The Park End has the smallest capacity at Goodison Park. The current layout of the stand was opened on 17 September 1994 with a capacity of 5,750. It was opened by David Hunt, a Member of Parliament. During the structure's development, fans were able to watch matches by climbing trees in neighbouring Stanley Park.|$|E
5|$|Family {{and family}} history also plays an {{important}} role in the poem. Eliot found information on his family from Sketch of the Eliot Family, which described how Eliot's family lived in East Coker for 200 years. When Andrew Eliott left, he disrupted the family history. Similarly, Eliot <b>broke</b> <b>from</b> his own family when he travelled away from his family, a family that he saw was declining. Within the poem, Eliot emphasizes the need for a journey and the need for inward change.|$|E
5|$|However, not {{everyone}} {{was satisfied with}} the new liturgical and political directions of the AFM. Wessel's political ties led to the radicalization of younger black pastors, {{the loss of the}} majority of the English membership, and a major division of Afrikaner members who did not share his political views. These Afrikaners not only disagreed with Wessel politically but also with du Plessis liturgically. In 1958, they <b>broke</b> <b>from</b> the AFM and formed the Pentecostal Protestant Church.|$|E

25|$|Luther's {{rejection}} of {{the primacy of the}} Roman Pontiff led {{to the start of the}} Protestant Reformation, during which numerous Protestant sects <b>broke</b> away <b>from</b> the Roman Catholic Church. The Church of England also <b>broke</b> away <b>from</b> the Catholic Church at this time, although for reasons different from Martin Luther and the Protestants.|$|R

5|$|In 1908, the New York State Legislature created Route14, an {{unsigned}} legislative {{route that}} extended from Corning to Rochester via South Bristol and Pittsford. The majority of Route14 south of Pittsford was routed {{on what is}} now NY64; however, {{in the vicinity of}} Bloomfield, Route14 <b>broke</b> <b>from</b> modern NY64 and used what later became NY20C to access Holcomb. At the same time, the portion of current NY64 that overlaps with US20 and NY5 was included in Route6, a cross-state highway connecting Albany to Buffalo. On March1, 1921, Route14 was altered to bypass Holcomb to the south on what is now NY64.|$|E
5|$|In 1985, {{after losing}} and then regaining the title from rival Leilani Kai at the inaugural WrestleMania, Richter was {{scheduled}} to defend her title at Madison Square Garden on November 25 of that same year against a mysterious masked opponent known only as The Spider. During the match, The Spider <b>broke</b> <b>from</b> the pre-scripted events and pinned Richter's shoulders to the mat. The referee—who was in on the plan—delivered a swift three count, despite Richter kicking out after a count of one. Richter ignored the bell and continued to attack the Spider, unmasking the new champion to reveal that it was The Fabulous Moolah in disguise.|$|E
5|$|Originally, NY5 entered Buffalo {{from the}} south on Fuhrmann Boulevard and Michigan Avenue and {{followed}} South Park Avenue and Main Street through the city before rejoining its modern alignment at Goodell Street. In the mid-1950s, a new limited-access highway was constructed along Fuhrmann Boulevard from Lackawanna to the Buffalo River. At the river, the new roadway <b>broke</b> <b>from</b> Fuhrmann and continued directly into downtown, returning to grade level two blocks south of Niagara Square. The expressway, known as the Buffalo Skyway, became part of a rerouted NY5 by 1956. Visually, the Skyway cuts off the city from the Buffalo inner harbor. In 2008, there was momentum to tear it down, but the momentum has passed.|$|E

5|$|Two films {{featuring}} Bean {{have been}} released, with Atkinson reprising {{his role as}} the character in both. The first film, , was directed by Mel Smith and released in 1997, and followed the misadventures of Mr. Bean, as he oversaw the transfer of Whistler's Mother to a Los Angeles art gallery. The film <b>broke</b> <b>from</b> the program's traditional narrative, by using a subplot with more developed characters, whereby Bean was not the sole centre of attention, but interacted with a suburban Californian family that he stays with during the film. The film grossed more than US$250million globally ($45million in the USA) on a budget estimated at $22million.|$|E
5|$|While {{the general}} routing of NY18 between Youngstown and Rochester {{was the same}} in 1930 as it is now, it {{initially}} followed a slightly different alignment through eastern Orleans County and western Monroe County. NY18 <b>broke</b> <b>from</b> its current alignment at Carr Road and followed Carr, Kenmore and Kendall Roads through the town of Kendall to the hamlet of Morton, from where it continued to Hamlin via the now-decommissioned NY360 and NY19. Additionally, NY18 utilized Hamlin Center Road and what is now NY260 between Hamlin and Roosevelt Highway.|$|E
5|$|A 1947 fire {{destroyed}} the clubhouse of the Toronto Argonaut Rowing Club and damaged the Grey Cup. Many other trophies and artifacts {{in the clubhouse}} melted or were damaged beyond repair but the Grey Cup survived by catching onto a nail when the shelf upon which it sat collapsed. The trophy has been broken on six other occasions: in 1978, when it was dropped by celebrating Edmonton Eskimos players; in 1987, when an Eskimos' player sat on it; in 1993, when Edmonton's Blake Dermott head-butted it; in 2006, when the trophy broke away from its base as the BC Lions celebrated their victory; in 2012 {{when one of the}} handles broke off as the Toronto Argonauts celebrated; and finally in 2014 when trophy <b>broke</b> <b>from</b> its base again by the Calgary Stampeders after their win. The CFL commissioned a replica of the trophy in 2008.|$|E

5|$|Born in 1888 in Omaha, Nebraska, Stevens became {{involved}} in the fight for suffrage while a college student at Oberlin College. After graduating with a degree in sociology in 1911, she taught briefly before becoming a paid regional organizer for the National American Woman Suffrage Association's Congressional Union for Woman Suffrage (CUWS). When the CUWS <b>broke</b> <b>from</b> the parent organization in 1914, Stevens became the national strategist. She was in charge of coordinating the women's congress, held at the Panama Pacific Exposition in 1915. When the CUWS became the National Woman's Party (NWP) in 1916, Stevens organized party delegates for each of the 435 Congressional Districts in an effort to attain national women's enfranchisement and defeat candidates who were opposed to women's rights. Between 1917 and 1919, Stevens was a prominent participant in the Silent Sentinels vigil at Woodrow Wilson's White House to urge the passage of a constitutional amendment for women's voting rights and was arrested several times for her involvement. After the 19th Amendment secured women's right to vote, she wrote a book, titled Jailed for Freedom (1920), which recounted the sentinel's ordeals.|$|E
5|$|Born to {{a middle-class}} family in Surrey, Valiente began {{practicing}} magic while a teenager. Working {{as a translator}} at Bletchley Park during the Second World War, she also married twice in this period. Developing her interest in occultism after the war, she began practicing ceremonial magic with a friend while living in Bournemouth. Learning of Wicca, in 1953 she was initiated into the Gardnerian tradition by its founder, Gerald Gardner. Soon becoming the High Priestess of Gardner's Bricket Wood coven, she helped him to produce or adapt many important scriptural texts for Wicca, such as The Witches Rune and the Charge of the Goddess, which were incorporated into the early Gardnerian Book of Shadows. In 1957, a schism resulted in Valiente and her followers leaving Gardner to form their own short-lived coven. After investigating the Wiccan tradition of Charles Cardell, in 1963 she was initiated into Raymond Howard's Coven of Atho. In 1964 she then went to work with Robert Cochrane in his coven, the Clan of Tubal Cain, although she later <b>broke</b> <b>from</b> this group.|$|E
5|$|By late 1830, and {{certainly}} {{by the spring}} of 1831, trouble in South Wales looked likely and, probably in response, Bute <b>broke</b> <b>from</b> his normal annual plans and in May travelled south from Scotland to Cardiff Castle. With a reform bill looking likely, tensions grew between the different political factions in Glamorganshire and how the potential new parliamentary seats should be shared out, especially between Bute and his conservative allies, Crawshay and Guest. Radical demonstrations occurred in Merthyr Tydfil, one of the largest industrial communities, in May, and the crowd set light to effigies of conservative politicians. Violence broke out and arrests were made on 10 May; the prisoners were released by the angry crowd and the local authorities effectively lost any control of the town. A general insurrection ensued on 30 May.|$|E
