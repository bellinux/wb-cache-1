While {{on the return}} voyage, she bombarded Russian positions at Libau. She ran aground off Steinort during the operation, and Augsburg struck a mine off Bornholm. After being freed from her grounding, the ship was repaired; Michelsen temporarily served as the detachment commander in place of Behring from 13 February to 9 March, when the ship was ready to return to service. Behring returned to Prinz Adalbert on 20 March. In the meantime, the Russians had briefly captured Memel. The Admiralstab (Admiralty Staff) detached the II Battle Squadron, II Scouting Group, and two flotillas of torpedo boats from the High Seas Fleet to reinforce the forces in the Baltic. The ships began to make diversionary attacks to support the German Army's campaign to retake Memel; Prinz Adalbert supported one such operation, a raid of the II Scouting Group into the <b>Bothnian</b> <b>Sea</b> to attack Russian merchant shipping on 23 March. The following day, the ships from the High Seas Fleet were recalled to the North Sea, leaving Behring's cruisers alone once again.|$|E

40|$|The Great Cormorant (Phalacrocorax carbo sinensis) is a piscivorous {{close to}} top-predator with dense nesting colonies. I studied how this species affects the {{underwater}} primary production on their ‘colony islands’, {{where they can}} exert influence via trophic cascades. The term “trophic cascade” means that the abundance of one high trophic level affects not only the adjacent level but also the abundance of all lower trophic levels. It has been thought that great cormorants affect the colony islands’ underwater primary production in two different ways: 1) via a top-down effect, which happens by removing fish that potentially increases herbivore abundances and decreases primary production 2) via a bottom-up effect, by accumulating guano on the colony island where nutrients can leach into the surrounding waters. I tested the underwater primary production of colony islands with three experiments that measured 1) the standing biomass of filamentous algae 2) the growth and herbivory of Fucus vesiculosus (a brown macroalga and an important foundation species in the Baltic Sea) and 3) the underwater light intensity (as a proxy for phytoplankton volume). These tests were carried out at the eight colony islands that {{are located in the}} Archipelago- and <b>Bothnian</b> <b>Seas.</b> Each colony island had a control island in its near vicinity. The experiments showed that the colony islands’ underwater primary production is higher than that found at its nearest control islands. While the Fucus vesiculosus had higher biomass, light intensity showed a decrease. It seems that primary production is higher only near the colony islands’ shoreline and in shallow (1 metre) water. It is possible that the number of herbivores around the colony islands is also greater than at the control islands. Although this was not detected in the experiments, it may influence the results of the standing biomass experiment. According to these experiments and previous studies, it is likely that cormorants affect the underwater nature of colony islands mainly through a bottom-up effect, arising from the run-off of nutrients from accumulated guano...|$|R

40|$|Two {{long-lived}} halogen radionuclides (36 Cl, T 1 / 2 = 301 kyr, and 129 I, T 1 / 2 = 15. 7 Myr) {{have been}} studied by means of Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS) at the Uppsala Tandem Laboratory. The 36 Cl measurements in natural samples using a medium-sized tandem accelerator (~ 1 MeV/amu) have been considered. A gas-filled magnetic spectrometer (GFM) was proposed for the separation of 36 Cl from its isobar, 36 S. Semi-empirical Monte-Carlo ion optical calculations were conducted to define optimal conditions for separating 36 Cl and 36 S. A 180 ° GFM was constructed and installed at the dedicated AMS beam line. 129 I has been measured in waters from the Arctic and North Atlantic Oceans. Most of the 129 I currently present in the Earth's surface environment {{can be traced back}} to liquid and gaseous releases from the nuclear reprocessing facilities at Sellafield (UK) and La Hague (France). The anthropogenic 129 I inventory in the central Arctic Ocean was found to increase proportionally to the integrated 129 I releases from these reprocessing facilities. The interaction and origin of water masses in the region have been clearly distinguished with the help of 129 I labeling. Predictions based on a compartment model calculation showed that the Atlantic Ocean and deep Arctic Ocean are the major sinks for the reprocessed 129 I. The variability in 129 I concentration measured in seawater along a transect from the Baltic Sea to the North Atlantic suggests strong enrichment in the Skagerrak–Kattegat basin. The 129 I inventory in the Baltic and <b>Bothnian</b> <b>Seas</b> is equal to ~ 0. 3 % of the total liquid releases from the reprocessing facilities. A lake sediment core sampled in northeastern Ireland was analyzed for 129 I to study the history of the Sellafield releases, in particular the nuclear accident of 1957. High 129 I concentration was observed corresponding to 1990 and later, while no indication of the accident was found. The results of this thesis research clearly demonstrate the uniqueness and future potential of 129 I as a tracer of processes in both marine and continental archives...|$|R

40|$|The out-migration of Atlantic salmon smolts was {{studied at}} {{the lower part of}} the Umeå River (River Umeälven) from the Norrfors dam towards the <b>sea</b> (<b>Bothnian</b> Bay) in {{northern}} Sweden. Two-year old hatchery-reared Atlantic salmon (n= 250) were tagged with acoustic transmitters and released downstream of the Norrfors dam and monitored while migrating downstream. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of feed restriction and rearing density on the migratory behaviour of Atlantic salmon smolts in {{the lower part of the}} flow-controlled river Umeälven in northern Sweden. Twenty acoustic receivers were deployed along the river section to cover all possible migration routes. Hatchery-reared Atlantic salmon smolts from five treatment groups were tagged using acoustic transmitters and released in late May 2012. A majority of the smolts migrated to the sea within a week after release. The smolts showed different migration speeds at different parts of the river. However, the average migration speed was similar for all treatment groups except for the strongest feed restricted treatment group that was significantly slower. The total mortality was higher in the old river channel downstream the dam to the Confluence area. No effects of any treatments could be detected on either migration speed or mortality...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{reconstruct}} diatom production in the subarctic northern tip of the Baltic <b>Sea,</b> <b>Bothnian</b> Bay, based on down-core analysis of Si isotopes in biogenic silica (BSi). Dating of the sediment showed that the samples covered the period 1820 to 2000. The sediment core record can be divided into two periods, an unperturbed period from 1820 to 1950 and a second period affected by human activities (from 1950 to 2000). This has been observed elsewhere in the Baltic Sea. The shift in the sediment core record after 1950 is likely caused by large scale damming of rivers. Diatom production was inferred from the Si isotope composition which ranged between &delta; 30 Si − 0. 18 &permil; and + 0. 58 &permil; in BSi, and assuming fractionation patterns due to the Raleigh distillation, the production was shown to be correlated with air and water temperature, which in turn were correlated with the mixed layer (ML) depth. The sedimentary record showed that the deeper ML depth observed in colder years resulted in less production of diatoms. Pelagic investigations in the 1990 's have clearly shown that diatom production in the Baltic Sea is controlled by the ML depth. Especially after cold winters and deep water mixing, diatom production was limited and dissolved silicate (DSi) concentrations were not depleted in the water column after the spring bloom. Our method corroborates these findings and offers a new method to estimate diatom production over much longer periods of time in diatom dominated aquatic systems, i. e. a large part of the world's ocean and coastal seas...|$|R

40|$|The {{processing}} of terrestrial {{dissolved organic matter}} (DOM) in coastal shelf seas {{is an important part}} of the global carbon cycle, yet, it is still not well understood. One of the largest brackish shelf seas, the Baltic Sea in northern Europe, is characterized by high freshwater input from sub-arctic rivers and limited water exchange with the Atlantic Ocean via the North Sea. We studied the molecular and isotopic composition and turnover of solid-phase extractable (SPE) DOM and its transformation along the salinity and redox continuum of the Baltic Sea during spring and autumn. We applied ultrahigh-resolution mass spectrometry and other geochemical and biological approaches. Our data demonstrate a large influx of terrestrial riverine DOM, especially into the northern part of the Baltic Sea. The DOM composition in the central Baltic Sea changed seasonally and was mainly related to autochthonous production by phytoplankton in spring. Especially in the northern, river-dominated basins, a major fraction of riverine DOM was removed, likely by bio- and photo-degradation. We estimate that the removal rate of terrestrial DOM in the Baltic <b>Sea</b> (<b>Bothnian</b> Bay to the Danish Straits/Kattegat area) is 1. 6 – 1. 9 Tg C per year which is 43 – 51 % of the total riverine input. The export of terrestrial DOM from the Danish Straits/Kattegat area toward the North Sea is 1. 8 – 2. 1 Tg C per year. Due to the long residence time of terrestrial DOM in the Baltic Sea (total of ca. 12 years), seasonal variations caused by bio- and photo-transformations and riverine discharge are dampened, resulting in a relatively invariant DOM molecular and isotopic signature exported to the North Sea. In the deep stagnant basins of the Baltic Sea, the DOM composition and dissolved organic nitrogen concentrations changed seasonally, likely because of vertical particle transport and subsequent degradation releasing DOM. DOM in the deep anoxic basins was also enriched in sulfur-containing organic molecules, pointing to abiotic sulfurization of DOM under sulfidic conditions...|$|R
40|$|This study about existence, {{causes and}} effects of oxidations in sulphide-bearing sediments in the coastland of northen Sweden is based upon an unique waterchemical sample program during 1990 - 2007 {{including}} the following parameters: pH, alkalinity, colournumber (mg Pt/l), COD (Chemical Oxygen Demand), sulphate, totalphosphorus, totalnitrogen and conductivity. For the years 2003 - 2007 the program was supplemented with metals. This investigation focus on the waterchemistry in surface water in lakes, watercourses and estuaries. The main objectives {{of this study is}} to give valuable contribution to the answers of the following research questions: What characterize the total waterchemistry in surface water where sulphide oxidations occur in the catchment areas?What conditions are responsible for and determine the large waterchemical variation in the watercourses? What conditions regulate the episodes of accidification?What period in summer show the most pronounced impact from sulphide oxidation on surface water chemistry?What chemical reactions and mechanisms are responsible for the changing waterquality connected with episodes of acidification?How large are the conribution from sulphide oxidation to acidity and high metal concentrations in watercourses relatively other potential sources?In what amounts are metals transported out in the estuaries in the Bothnian Bay from small coastal watercourses compared to big mountain rivers?Have the metals different distrubution patterns in the estuary?What is the environmental and ecotoxicological effects of suldphide oxidations in coastal areas of the Bothnian Bay nowadays and in the future?What consequences have the existence of sulphide oxidations for environmental monitoring and management and for the implementation of the EU Water Frame Work Directive?Results and conclusions from the investigations can be summarized:(1) An extreme waterchemical variation occur in the watercourses within and between years, The existence of sulphide oxidations in the catchment areas are responsible for the extreme variation. (2) The climate in the investigation areas with its over time variable precipitiation causes large variations in the groundwater table which have an impact on and regulate the size of oxidations occuring in the catchments sulphide-bearing sediments and this in turn produces a large waterchemical variation in the watercourses (= ”Climate-induced sulphide oxidations”) (3) Episodes, with a total and radical change of the waterchemistry, occur in the watercourses as a result of climate-induced sulphide oxidations. This ”waterchemical reversal” is distinguished by the fact that previous high values for the parameters (group A:) pH, alkalinity, COD, colour, P, Fe and Cr will decrease considerable simultaneously as the concentrations for the parameters (group B:) sulphate, conductivity, Al, Cd, Co, Mn, Ni and Zn make a pronounced increase. All the results throughout this study show positive correlations between parameters in the same group (A or B) and negative correlations between the groups. During 1990 - 2007 there were at least three large climate-induced episodes of acidification with the waterchemical reversal here described. (4) Despite the huge waterchemical differens between identified episodes and more regular interepisodes, the relatively high concentration of metals and sulphur during the interepisodes confirms that oxidations in the catchments sulphide sediments constantly have an impact more or less on the waterquality of the surface water. (5) The size of sulphide oxidations in the catchment during different years are in the studied watercourse waterchemically more pronounced in june compared to maj or july. An explanation for those circumstances is presented. (6) Sulphide oxidations are the main cause to acidity and high metal concentrations in the investigated watercourses. The contribution to the pH-decline from factors such as increase in natural organic (humic) acidity or antropogenic acid deposition are of minor significance. (7) The total metal transport from Persöfjärden is of the same magnitude (Ni, Zn) or exceeds that in Kalix River (Al, Co, Mn) with a catchment approximately 100 times larger. The results from the studied watercourses indicate that the large number of small catchments i coastal areas in nothen Sweden could be a significant an so far unknown metal source for the <b>Bothnian</b> bay/Baltic <b>Sea.</b> (8) A metal-retention study shows that the metals transported in a stream have different distribution pattern in the estuary. The estuary acts like a significant trap for Al and Fe and like a source for Mn. For Co, Cd, Ni and Zn have more or less the same amounts that entered the estuary passed it. Mechanisms for the metals deposition to and leakage from the sediments are discussed. (9) To explain the chemical reactions and mechanisms responsible for the ”waterchemical reversal” with a significant decline of humic substances some hypothetical explanations are presented where Fe and Al are playing an important role in the flocculation of organic substances. The hypothesis support the consistently results that Fe have a high positive correlation and Al a negative correlation with organic substances (COD/ colour). (10) The significant positive correlations between phosphorous and COD/colour respectively iron indicate that the large decline in the concentrations of phosphorous during the episodes is due to the fact that phosphotous is removed from the water together with (1) flocculated organic substances and/or (2) precipitated iron. (11) Some observed ecotoxicological effects of the climate-induced sulphide oxidations are death of fish, increased distribution of some macrophytes, temporary dissappearance of some ”sea-birds” and absence of algae-blooming 1990 - 2007. (12) The unexpected high concentrations of cadmium found in liver from fish in the Bothnian Bay and the large variation between years could be the the result of the variable outflush of cadmium that natural climate-induced sulphide oxidations produce in coastal watercourses in northen Sweden and Finland. (13) The occurence of climate-induced sulphide oxidations have a radical impact on the waterchemical and biological parameters that are measured by routine in environmental monitoring. For that reason, for one thing to make it possible to discriminate antropogenic sources of acidity and high metal concentrations from natural sulphide oxidations, it is necessary to put specially demand for the design and interpretation of monitoring programs in sulphide-bearing ares. The climate induced sulphide oxidations have a significant impact on seven of Swedens 16 Environmental Objectives. Kunskapen om och i vilken utsträckning sulfidoxidationer äger rum i norra Norrlands kustland är låg. Det finns inga studier som visar de vattenkemiska förändringar med avseende på normalparametrar och metaller som vattendrag och sjöar genomgår som ett resultat av sulfidoxidationer. Denna undersökning om förekomst, orsaker och effekter av oxidationer i sulfidrika sediment i Norrbottens kustland vilar på ett unikt vattenkemiskt provtagningsprogram omfattande 8 normalparametrar (pH, alkalinitet, färgtal, COD, sulfat, totalfosfor, totalkväve och konduktivitet) under åren 1990 - 2007 kompletterat med metaller under 2003 - 2007. Rapportens huvudsakliga syften är att öka kunskaperna om sulfidoxidationer genom att lämna värdefulla bidrag till svaren på följande forskningsfrågor:· Vad karakteriserar den totala vattenkemin (normalparametrar och metaller) i vattendrag som avvattnar områden där sulfidoxidationer äger rum?· Vilka förhållanden styr den stora vattenkemiska variationen i vattendragen? Vad är orsaken till försurningsepisoder?· Under vilken tid på sommaren kan graden av sulfidoxidationer i avrinningsområdet bäst avläsas vattenkemiskt i vattendragen?· Vilka kemiska mekanismer ligger bakom den förändrade vattenkemin med bland annat ett klarare vatten i samband med sulfidoxidationsepisoder?· Hur stort är sulfidoxidationernas bidrag till surhet och höga metallhalter i vattendragen relativt andra potentiella källor?· Hur stora mängder metaller (i ton) transporteras ut i Bottenvikens fjärdar från små kustnära vattendrag jämfört med stora fjällälvar? · Var tar de uttransporterade metallerna vägen när de når fjärden? Hur ser transportmönstret ut för olika metaller?· Vilka ekotoxikologiska effekter har sulfidoxidationer i norra Norrlands kustland? Har den pågående landhöjningen och förekomsten av sulfidoxidationer några framtida ekotoxikologiska effekter?· Vilka konsekvenser har förekomsten av sulfidoxidationer för miljöövervakning, recipientkontroll och arbetet med EU:s vattendirektiv?Resultat och slutsatser från undersökningen kan sammanfattas:En stor vattenkemisk variation uppträder i vattendragen mellan och inom år, där existensen av sulfidoxidationer i avrinningsområdet är orsaken till den stora vattenkemiska variationen. Undersökningsområdets klimat är, med sin över tiden oregelbundna variation i nederbördsmängder, ansvarig för grundvattennivåns fluktuationer och därmed för graden av sulfidoxidationer som kan äga rum i avrinningsområdets sulfidbärande marklager vilket i sin tur orsakar en stor vattenkemisk variation i vattendragen (”klimatsyrda sulfidoxidationer”). I de avrinnande vattendragen uppträder som ett resultat av de klimatstyrda sulfidoxidationerna episoder med en total och genomgripande förändring av vattenkemin. Detta ”vattenkemiska omslag” kännetecknas av att tidigare höga värden för parametergruppen (A) pH, alkalinitet, färgtal, COD, fosfor, järn och krom sjunker dramatiskt samtidigt som halterna för parametergruppen (B) sulfat, konduktivitet, aluminium, kadmium, kobolt, mangan, nickel och zink stiger markant. Genomgående visar alla resultat i hela undersökningen på en positiv samvariation mellan parametrarna inom samma grupp (A resp B) och en negativ samvariation för parametrar mellan grupperna. Under perioden 1990 - 2007 kan tre större sulfidoxidationsepisoder urskiljas som kännetecknas av mycket klart vatten och med ovan beskrivna vattenkemiska förändringTrots den stora skillnaden i vattenkemi mellan identifierade episoder och tiden däremellan (interepisoder) visar de relativt höga grundhalterna av vissa metaller under interepisoderna att avrinnande ytvatten ständigt är mer eller mindre påverkat av avrinningsområdets sulfidleror och oxidationer i dessa. Graden av sulfidoxidationer i avrinningsområdet under olika år visar sig vattenkemiskt tydligare i juni jämfört med maj eller juli. En förklaringsmodell för orsakerna till detta presenteras. Sulfidoxidationer är den huvudsakliga orsaken till låga pH och höga metallhalter i de undersökta vattendragen. Bidragen från naturligt förekommande organiska syror (humusämnen) eller från luftdeponerade försurande föroreningar är endast marginella. Den totala metalltransporten från Persöfjärden kan under ett år överstiga eller vara i nivå med hela Kalix älv med ett ca 100 gånger större årsflöde. Metalltransporten från Holmsundet och Persöfjärden indikerar att det stora antalet små och kustnära avrinningsområden i norra Sverige kan utgöra en betydande men hittills okänd källa för metaller till Bottenviken och Östersjön. En metallretentionsstudie visar att de metaller som frigörs i samband med sulfidoxidationer och strömmar ut i en studerad fjärd transporteras olika långt. Fjärden fungerar som en tydlig fälla för Al och Fe. Metallerna Co, Ni, Cd och Zn transporteras i stor utsträckning vidare genom fjärden. För Mn fungerar fjärden som en källa det vill säga mer Mn lämnar fjärden än vad som kommer in. Kemiska mekanismer för sedimentation, fastläggning och läckage av de olika metallerna relaterat till fjärdens nuvarande successionstadie med avseende på landhöjningen behandlas. De kemiska mekanismer som orsakar det vattenkvalitativa omslaget vid episoderna behandlas. Utklarningen av vattnet (sjunkande värden för färgtal och COD) är ett uttryck för att organiskt material (humusämnen) i kollodial form genom flockningsreaktioner blir mindre lösligt och sedimenterar. Flera olika hypoteser för hur utflockningen går till, där Al och Fe sannolikt spelar en huvudroll, framläggs. Hypoteserna överensstämmer med resultaten att järn genomgående uppvisar en mycket hög positiv korrelation med färgtal/COD samtidigt som aluminium har en negativ korrelation med färgtal/COD. De genomgående mycket höga positiva korrelationerna mellan fosfor och färgtal/COD respektive järn tyder på att de kraftigt sjunkande fosforhalterna vid episoderna beror på att fosfor har lämnat vattenmassan med utflockande organiskt material och/eller medfällts med järn. Några observerade effekter som mycket sannolikt är ett resultat av sulfidoxidations-episoderna är (1) fiskdöd, mest sannolikt orskade av de höga aluminiumhalterna kombinerat med ett lågt pH och ett klart vatten fritt från organiskt material, (2) ökad utbredning och numerär av vissa arter av vattenväxter (makrofyter), (3) minskat antal av vissa arter sjöfåglar och (4) frånvaro av störande algutvecklingar 1990 - 2007. En förklaringsmodell presenteras där klimatstyrda sulfidoxidationer görs ansvarig för de fortsatt höga halterna av kadmium i lever från fisk i Bottenviken. Den stora spridning och mellanårsvariation som kadmiumhalterna i fisk uppvisat under åren kan vara ett resultat av den stora mellanårsvariation i uttransporterat kadmium som de klimatstyrda sulfidoxidationerna skapar i kustnära vattendrag i norra Sverige och Finland. Närvaron av klimatstyrda sulfidoxidationer påverkar på ett genomgripande sätt huvuddelen av de vattenkemiska och biologiska parametrar och områden som rutinmässigt mäts vid miljöövervakning och recipientkontroll. För att i sulfidjordsland kunna särskilja antropogena metall- och/eller försurande utsläpp från de som naturliga sulfidoxidationer kan åstadkomma ställs det speciella krav på utformningen och tolkningen av vattenkemiska kontrollprogram. De klimatstyrda sulfidoxidationerna har en tydlig påverkan på sju av Sveriges 16 nationella miljömål. Godkänd; 2009; 20090316 (erixon...|$|R

The surface area of <b>Bothnian</b> <b>Sea</b> is approximately 79,000 km². The largest coastal towns, from south to north, are Rauma and Pori in Finland, and Gävle and Sundsvall in Sweden. Umeå (Sweden) and Vaasa (Finland) lie in the extreme north, near Bothnian Bay.|$|E
50|$|Between Finland and Sweden Jotnian sediments {{are common}} in the Gulf of Bothnia, the <b>Bothnian</b> <b>Sea</b> and the Åland Sea {{including}} South Kvarken. Known Jotnian rocks at the Åland Sea are sandstones and belong to the Söderarm Formation (informal). Above these there are Upper riphean and Vendian sandstones and shales. Fully within Swedish waters there is a Jotnian sediment occurrence at the Landsort Basin between Gotland and Stockholm archipelago. Jotnian rocks found in the Landsort Basin are red sandstones. In the <b>Bothnian</b> <b>Sea</b> offshore Pori in Satakunta Jotnian sediments reaches a thickness of thousand metres, in other locations thickness is much less, for example 100 m at the Sylen shoal and yet in other places of the <b>Bothnian</b> <b>Sea</b> Jotnian sediments are absent. The Sub-Cambrian peneplain cuts across Jotnian rocks in the <b>Bothnian</b> <b>Sea.</b>|$|E
