40|$|In North Europe the {{domestic}} heating systems an the hot-water supply are mainly {{supplied by the}} process of combustion of fossil sources as natural gas or <b>fuel</b> <b>oil.</b> As a result to individual consumption and seasonal heating periods during a year the high difference in the required heat varies significantly. The boiling system adjusts itself towards the changing heat consumption by operating in a stop and go modus with different operation time. A harmful amount of CO- an CxHy- emissions results from the start and stop operation during a year. By regulating automatically the power of the burner in a boiler system these emissions can be reduced. This operation mode is not practicable with standard boilers. While changing the power, contents of the flew gas can condense inside the boiler and corrode its wall. Especially in <b>boilers</b> for <b>fuel</b> <b>oil</b> combustion sulfuric acid can result from condensation because of sulfur contents in <b>fuel</b> <b>oil.</b> Investigations on 2 new <b>boiler</b> principles for <b>fuel</b> <b>oil</b> combustion and for a high power range were made. The first principle is a gas condensing boiler which is designed for permanent condensation and desulfurization of the flew gas. In this boiler a bubble column is used for heat and mass transfer. With the second principle a boiler can operate in a high power range without any condensation. Condensation is avoided to construct very simple designed boilers. The heat is transferred in special wickless Heat Pipes. With these two Heat Transfer Principles heat can be transferred in a power range of up to 1 : 10 nearly without a loss of the systems thermal effectivity...|$|R

40|$|Chemical-looping {{combustion}} (CLC) is {{a promising}} technology for future energy conversion {{on the basis}} of combustion of fossil fuels with inherent CO 2 separation. In comparison to other carbon-capture technologies {{there is no need for}} energy demanding gas separation in order to obtain pure CO 2. In the past, CLC research has mainly focused on the use of gaseous and solid fuels. This work the first comprehensive study of the use of liquid fuels in chemical-looping combustion. The work in the thesis includes (1) investigation of several different oxygen carriers based on nickel, iron, manganese and copper with kerosene as fuel, (2) design of an injection system for heavy liquid fuels for the fuel reactor of a pilot-scale chemical-looping reactor, (3) long-term operation of ilmenite oxygen carrier with a <b>fuel</b> <b>oil</b> in a pilot-scale unit and (4) tests with ilmenite oxygen carrier and a vacuum residue from Saudia Arabia as fuel. Experiments were conducted in a bench-scale reactor and in a pilot-scale reactor, and for each reactor a fuel injection system was designed and tested. Two types of kerosene, with and without sulphur, were tested in the bench-scale reactor during 240 h of fuel injection and a fuel input between 100 Wth and 580 Wth. In the pilot-scale system, a <b>fuel</b> <b>oil</b> type 1 and different blends of a vacuum residue and <b>fuel</b> <b>oil</b> 1 were tested during 72 h of fuel operation. Here, the fuel input was varied between 4. 5 kWth and about 6 kWth. Six different oxygen-carrier materials, out of which four were synthesized and two were of mineral origin, were tested in the bench-scale unit. The different materials showed clear differences in fuel conversion and structural integrity. Ilmenite oxygen carrier, which is a mineral iron-titanium oxide, was found to have a high structural stability, which was unmatched by the synthesized materials. Fuel conversion, however, was significantly lower than that of the synthesized oxygen carriers, and it is likely that temperatures above 950 °C are needed in order to achieve reasonable conversion levels. Long-term testing was carried out with the ilmenite oxygen carried in the pilot-scale reactor system. The conditions in this unit are much harsher than those in the bench-scale reactor and similar to those in an industrial-scale circulating fluidized-bed <b>boiler.</b> With <b>fuel</b> <b>oil</b> 1 as <b>fuel,</b> different trends in fuel conversion could be observed with respect to reactor temperature, fuel flow and solids circulation.
