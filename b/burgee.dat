5|$|On 22 August 1958, Eisenhower {{announced}} {{a moratorium on}} nuclear testing, effective 31 October 1958. This did not mean an immediate end to testing; on the contrary, the United States, the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom all rushed to perform as much testing as possible before the deadline, which the Soviets did not meet, conducting tests on 1 and 3 November. A new British test series, known as Grapple Z, commenced on 22 August. It explored new technologies {{such as the use}} of external neutron initiators, which had first been tried out with Orange Herald. Core boosting using tritium gas and external boosting with layers of lithium deuteride were successfully tested in the Pendant and <b>Burgee</b> tests, allowing a smaller, lighter Tom for two-stage devices. The international moratorium commenced on 31 October 1958, and Britain ceased atmospheric testing for good.|$|E
5|$|Centered on Post Oak Boulevard and Westheimer Road, the Uptown District boomed {{during the}} 1970s and early 1980s when a {{collection}} of midrise office buildings, hotels, and retail developments appeared along Interstate610 West. Uptown {{became one of the}} most prominent instances of an edge city. The tallest building in Uptown is the 64-floor, -tall, Philip Johnson and John <b>Burgee</b> designed landmark Williams Tower (known as the Transco Tower until 1999). At the time of construction, it was believed to be the world's tallest skyscraper outside a central business district. The new 20-story Skanska building and BBVA Compass Plaza are the newest office buildings built in Uptown after 30years. The Uptown District is also home to buildings designed by noted architects I. M. Pei, César Pelli, and Philip Johnson. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, a mini-boom of midrise and highrise residential tower construction occurred, with several over 30 stories tall. Since 2000 more than 30 high-rise buildings have gone up in Houston; all told, 72 high-rises tower over the city, which adds up to about 8,300 units. In 2002, Uptown had more than 23million square feet (2,100,000m²) of office space with 16million square feet (1,500,000m²) of class A office space.|$|E

500|$|Ohio's flag is {{the only}} non-rectangular U.S. state flag. It is a rare example of a non-quadrilateral civil flag, another {{well-known}} example being the flag of Nepal. According to vexillologist Whitney Smith, it may be loosely based upon cavalry flags of the Civil War and Spanish–American War. The flag has been officially defined as a [...] "burgee" [...] since 2002, even though <b>burgees</b> are typically used as maritime flags. Its shape, lack of text, and mirror symmetry {{allow it to be}} flown or hung in various orientations without affecting legibility. On account of the flag's uncommon shape, foreign manufacturers have occasionally set the entire design against a white, rectangular field.|$|R
5000|$|HipHopDX {{gave the}} album a fairly average rating of 3.5/5.

[...] Omar <b>Burgees,</b> a reviewer at HipHopDX, went on to say; Hardcore material representative of Hip Hop made in the mid-to-late ‘90s has been taking a beating in some circles. Somewhat backhanded phrases like “Rappity-Rap” and “boom bap” epitomize aggressive, multisyllabic, Rap infused with similes and metaphors accented with sample-based production. Army of the Pharaohs rarely (if ever) give off the appearance of being threatened by this stigma, in part, because their individual and collective careers originated from that era. Some 16 years later, after multiple lineup changes and over a decade of watching Rap evolve (or devolve…depending on your perspective), AOTP splits their time between simultaneously preserving Hip Hop’s Golden Era and asserting their current relevance by competitively out-rhyming each other.|$|R

25|$|The museum {{opened a}} second major addition, this one {{designed}} by Philip Johnson and his partner, John <b>Burgee,</b> in 1977.

The expansion, {{which included a}} three-story section, enclosed the triangular space at the far western end of the building site, thus bringing the physical plant to its western-most limit. Johnson’s 1977 addition created an administrative wing, a 105-seat auditorium, a two-story storage vault, a spacious library, and two interior grassed courts that insulated occupants of the library and administrative offices from heavy traffic passing nearby.|$|E
25|$|Though small, Roosevelt Island has a {{distinguished}} architectural history.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine the {{influence}} of national culture on supply chain coordination. It investigates whether uncertainty avoidance (UA) influences information sharing (IS) trust and personal interest (PI), which are the main elements that influence supply chain coordination (SCC). This research adopts a survey methodology, followed by expert interviews used as a justification method for survey results. Survey data was collected from 138 international supply chain members, mainly from Middle East and Far East. A total of 11 people were selected as potential interviewees. These people worked in various departments in different companies and were of various nationalities. The findings revealed that the cultural aspect of uncertainty avoidance influences information sharing and trust. This study adds a new contribution to the literature on supply chain management (SCM), as noted in <b>Burgees</b> et al. 's (2006) review of supply chain literature, studies that examine the social aspect of supply chains, including culture, have been neglected.

[...] Next after the starboard spreader is the port spreader. House flags (those defining the owner) are usually flown from the mainmast truck. When a club <b>burgee</b> is flown, it will normally be hoisted to the truck of the most forward mast. On a sloop, then, not having a foremast, the house flag could be moved to the port spreader if the starboard spreader was in use, and a <b>burgee</b> was being flown. On a ketch, the house flag would be moved to the mizzen.|$|E

[...] Before the building was constructed, an 8-foot-tall, 600 pound model was pieced together in Tarentum, Pennsylvania by Renato [...] "Reno" [...] Chieruzzi in the basement of his home.
