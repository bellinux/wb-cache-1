500|$|The {{game was}} {{developed}} for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox side-by-side, with a PC version initially described as [...] "possible". Creative director Emmanuel Valdez said that [...] "for the longest time we were debating {{whether or not to}} <b>bring</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> for GameCube," [...] before deciding [...] "there's just not a lot there in the GameCube market right now." [...] There were also plans to port the game for the PlayStation Portable. The game engine for Darkwatch features middleware engines RenderWare, Havok and Quazal, while Autodesk MotionBuilder was used to create character animation and motion capture.|$|E
500|$|The {{standard}} 3dB {{hybrid transformer}} {{is shown in}} figure 16. [...] Power at port 1 is split equally between ports 2 and 3 but in antiphase to each other. [...] The hybrid transformer is therefore a 180° hybrid. [...] The centre-tap is usually terminated internally but it is possible to <b>bring</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> as port 4; in which case the hybrid {{can be used as a}} sum and difference hybrid. [...] However, port 4 presents as a different impedance to the other ports and will require an additional transformer for impedance conversion if it is required to use this port at the same system impedance.|$|E
500|$|The {{stated goal}} of the subsidy reform is [...] "to {{rejuvenate}} Iran's economy, increase productivity, give it a new footing and <b>bring</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> of the slump {{it has been in}} for so long". Concretely, the government plans to replace the subsidies with targeted social assistance. Consequences of the economic reform plan are that Iran will be less vulnerable to US sanctions because it will reduce fuel imports. The reform plan will also save money for the Iranian people because it will end a multibillion-dollar-a-year contraband (17% percent of fuel production in Iran is smuggled abroad daily). Due to subsidies, Iran had long had one of the cheapest gas prices in the world, 10 cents per liter or 40 cents per gallon.|$|E

500|$|Jay-Z {{would have}} the film – American Gangster – playing on the {{monitors}} above the recording booth {{as a source of}} motivation during the recording sessions. In an interview with MTV, producer LV from The Hitmen said [...] "Jay {{would have the}} beats...He'd do the record, and he'd send it back to us. We'd fill in the blanks as far as making them full records. From having live horns, live strings, live drummers. This percussion dude, he was coming in with bottles, banging on bottles, just sprinkles of shit. We went all out. We brought in musicians to <b>bring</b> <b>it</b> <b>out.</b> Jay probably just heard a sample and some drums. Once we got the vocals back, we brought in all the extra candy".|$|E
2500|$|Anger has {{finished}} writing Hollywood Babylon III, {{but has not}} yet published it, fearing severe legal repercussions if he did so. Of this he has stated that [...] "The main reason I didn't <b>bring</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> was that I had a whole section on Tom Cruise and the Scientologists. I'm not {{a friend of the}} Scientologists." [...] Despite withholding legal action against the highly critical 2015 film Going Clear, the Church of Scientology was known on earlier occasions to heavily sue those making accusations against them.|$|E
2500|$|Diamandis first {{joined the}} club's investors {{when he was}} invited to buy the shares that Steve McMahon had left, which he bought through a member of his staff to keep his name off of the club's records. He said he did this to prevent any accusations of {{conflict}} of interest. He became involved as a member of back-room staff when the club asked him to find investors in 2000. On viewing the club's finances at the time he said [...] "I was pretty taken aback by what I'd seen"; the club had recently received £3.5million and he was [...] "shocked that so soon after such a big investment the club needed another £1.5million to stay afloat". Part of the group that arranged insolvency, he negotiated the provision of £125,000 each from Willie Carson and Cliff Puffet before an administrator was appointed. At one point Cliff Puffett asked him to help fund that month's salary, which he refused whilet demanding to know why there was a money hole. He was instrumental in creating the consortium to re-take over the club and <b>bring</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> of administration. Bob Holt, Willie Carson and Cliff Puffet again invested £125,000 each and developers St. Modwen Properties provided capital to the scheme. Ten months later the group regained control from the club's creditors, saying [...] "We only got control by a mistake they made in that they spent too long electing a board and arranging an AGM".|$|E
