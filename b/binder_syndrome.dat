40|$|Patients with {{chondrodysplasia}} punctata (CDP) usually {{present with}} Binder-type features, and often CDP is misdiagnosed as <b>Binder</b> <b>syndrome.</b> This study reviewed {{the management and}} outcome of patients with <b>Binder</b> <b>syndrome</b> and CDP in a multidisciplinary setting. METHODS: The notes and radiographs of the patients managed at the Australian Craniofacial Unit with a multidisciplinary setting since 1976 were reviewed, and data were collected on patient demographics, associated medical and surgical problems, subsequent management, and complications. RESULTS: Seventy-seven patients were treated over the 30 -year period (5 patients were lost to follow-up); of the remaining 72 patients, 60 (83 %) had <b>Binder</b> <b>syndrome,</b> and 12 (17 %) were patients with CDP. Forty were males, and 32 were females, with an age range of 6 months to 47 years. Thirteen patients (18 %) had a strong family history, and 65 patients (90 %) have so far undergone surgical correction, and of those, 35 (54 %) have completed their treatment, the longest follow-up time being 18 years. The mean number of surgical procedures was 2. 4, and 18 patients (28 %) had postoperative complications, which included partial necrosis of the maxilla, osteomyelitis of the mandible, facial nerve and inferior alveolar nerve neuropraxia, nasal bone graft exposure, and cellulitis. DISCUSSION: Because of the phenotypic characteristics shared by both <b>Binder</b> <b>syndrome</b> and CDP, it is most likely that <b>Binder</b> <b>syndrome</b> is not a syndrome, nor is it an entity, but {{most likely to be}} an "association. " We would advocate that these patients should be managed in a multidisciplinary setting. Shaheel Chummun, N. R. McLean, M. Nugent, P. J. Anderson and David J. Davi...|$|E
40|$|The patient {{reported}} here displayed the most characteristic features of <b>Binder</b> <b>syndrome</b> (OMIM: 155050), a rare maxillonasal malformation with unknown etiology. She was sent for genetic evaluation {{at the age}} of 10 years because of facial dysmorphism and borderline intellectual disability. Cytogenetic analyses showed a de novo supernumerary small ring chromosome with a pericentromeric region of chromosome 5 in all lymphocytes. Array analysis revealed that the marker contains a 20, 950 kb genomic region comprising cytogenetic bands 5 p 14. 1 to q 11. 1. Altogether 7 reports have been published in the literature with partial trisomy of chromosome 5 overlapping with our case. These 8 cases were analysed for phenotype/genotype correlation which suggested that the maxillonasal anomalies of Binder phenotype and trisomy of pericentromeric region of chromosome 5 may be in causal relationship. Further functional annotation studies of genes localized in this genomic region should take this into consideration. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on a patient with association of a chromosome abnormality and clinical characteristics of Binder phenotype.

40|$|<b>Binder′s</b> <b>syndrome</b> or maxillonasal {{dysplasia}} {{is a rare}} clinical entity {{characterized by}} abnormal development (dysplasia) of nasomaxillary region. Management of the syndrome varies with the severity of facial anomalies present and association with other anomalies. Interdisciplinary team management of this malformation is essential.

40|$|Abstract: <b>Binder's</b> <b>Syndrome</b> {{also known}} as Maxillo-Nasal Dysplasia is a {{developmental}} disorder primarily affecting the anterior part of the maxilla and nasal complex (nose and jaw). It is a rare disorder and the causes are unclear. It is an uncom-mon condition characterized by a retruded mid-face with an ex-tremely flat nose. Hereditary factors and vitamin D deficiency during embryonic growth have been researched as possible causes. Morphological characteristics of the syndrome are of fundamental importance for the correct diagnosis and treatment planning of these patients. We hereby report to you a rare case of <b>Binder's</b> <b>syndrome</b> with clinical, radiographic features and discussed the treatment options...|$|R
40|$|<b>Binder′s</b> <b>syndrome</b> is an {{uncommon}} entity characterized by midfacial hypoplasia along with Class III incisal relationship.

40|$|<b>Binder′s</b> <b>syndrome</b> or nasomaxillary {{hypoplasia}} or maxillonasal dysplasia is {{an uncommon}} developmental disorder predominantly affecting the maxillary anterior {{region and the}} nasal complex. A concave profile, broad and flat nose, short columella, convex upper lip, and malocclusion are the major clinical findings. The characteristic features of this syndrome are developmental failure in the premaxillary area, with concomitant defects of the nasal skeleton. We present two cases showing the characteristic features of this rare syndrome...|$|R
40|$|Aim: Being an {{uncommon}} congenital condition, the treatment modalities of maxillonasal dysplasia are not clearly defined. Our {{aim is to}} discuss the availability and utility of various treatment options to achieve optimum results. In patients with <b>Binder′s</b> <b>syndrome,</b> the midface appears flattened, the columella is short and the upper lip slants backwards. Materials and Methods: We report here 15 patients with <b>Binder′s</b> <b>syndrome</b> who were operated {{over a period of}} 5 years. Different treatment options in the form of correction of the depressed nasal dorsum and maxillary hypoplasia with split cranial bone graft or synthetic materials such as high-density porous polyethylene implant were used. Two patients with Angle class III malocclusion underwent a Le Fort I osteotomy for maxillary advancement. The patients were followed over a period of 3 years. Results: We achieved a reasonable augmentation of the nose and the maxilla in our patients. We faced complications in two of our patients; in one patient there was fracture of the dorsal nasal bone graft and the other patient had protrusion of paranasal screws into the palate, which were removed. Conclusion: In this series of cases, we were able to utilise various treatment modalities appropriately to achieve satisfactory outcome with no significant complications...|$|R

40|$|Background: Nasomaxillary {{hypoplasia}} {{is a rare}} congenital disorder {{involving the}} central face. It imparts a distinctive appearance to the individual face as the age advances. Severity of the disorder varies, so do the manifestations. Methods: This was a retrospective study conducted on the records and photographic data of 560 rhinoplasty cases performed between 2006 March and 2016 March. About 16 cases of nasomaxillary hypoplasia were selected from the group and they were classified based on {{the severity of the}} features. Surgical correction performed in each group was detailed. Results: Three percent of the 560 rhinoplasties performed in our centre turned out to be cases of <b>Binder's</b> <b>syndrome.</b> Nasal correction with locoregional autologous cartilage grafts was sufficient in mild cases. Loco-regional cartilage grafts along with costal cartilage grafts were needed for moderate and severe cases. Anterior nasal floor along with alar base augmentation was performed to achieve a proper aesthetic profile in moderate and severe cases. Post-operative results were excellent in mild and moderate cases and acceptable in severe cases. Discussion: We attempted to correct the deformity only after growth of the nose and maxilla was completed. We used cartilage grafts as a mainstay as cartilage has long-term stability without resorption unlike bone grafts. Instead of following en bloc technique of cartilage assembly, we have reconstructed the nasal dorsum, columella and tip separately as this principle is more functionally acceptable with less warping or stiffness of the nose. Importance was given to proper anchorage of grafts. Conclusion: We have attempted to put together the various features into three categories of mild/moderate/severe based on previous anthropometric studies of nasal anatomical parameters. The second objective of our study was to advise a logical surgical protocol for each group so that future surgeons can follow an easy surgical guideline to attain optimal cosmetic and functional results...|$|R
