30|$|Interestingly, the {{triangular}} structure is often exploited for rhetorical reasons, {{in particular in}} advertisements. A commercial slogan (popular in the 1980 s) such as “Don’t <b>buy</b> <b>a</b> car, <b>buy</b> <b>a</b> Saab” has a real impact. Here the sentence initially understood as “Don’t <b>buy</b> <b>a</b> car 0 … ” yields a contradiction as a Saab is a car 0. Reinterpreted as “Don’t <b>buy</b> <b>a</b> car 1 …” (in which car 1 is the class of cars that are not Saab), it gets the exclusive interpretation. The cognitive effort is worthwhile in terms of effect as the hearer ends up with “buy a Saab” and “don’t <b>buy</b> <b>a</b> car {{that is not a}} Saab”.|$|R

5|$|In 2014 Consumer Reports {{published}} {{results from}} a survey conducted with 19 secret shoppers that went to 85 dealerships in four states, making anonymous visits between December 2013 and March 2014. The secret shoppers asked a number of specific questions about cars to test the salespeople’s knowledge about electric cars. The consumer magazine decided to conduct the survey after several consumers who {{wanted to buy a}} plug-in car reported to the organization that some dealerships were steering them toward gasoline-powered models. The survey found that not all sales people seemed enthusiastic about making PEV sales; a few outright discouraged it, and even one dealer was reluctant to even show a plug-in model despite having one in stock. And many sales people seemed not to have a good understanding of electric-car tax breaks and other incentives or of charging needs and costs. Consumer Reports also found that when it came to answering basic questions, sales people at Chevrolet, Ford, and Nissan dealerships tended to be better informed than those at Honda and Toyota. The survey found that most of the Toyota dealerships visited recommended against <b>buying</b> <b>a</b> Prius Plug-in and suggested <b>buying</b> <b>a</b> standard Prius hybrid instead. Overall, the secret shoppers reported that only 13 dealers “discouraged sale of EV,” with seven of them being in New York. However, at 35 of the 85 dealerships visited, the secret shoppers said sales people recommended <b>buying</b> <b>a</b> gasoline-powered car instead.|$|E
