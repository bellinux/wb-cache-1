5|$|In {{the post-war}} years, archaeological {{interest}} in the castle grew. From 1951 onwards the Ministry of Works carried out a long-running research project into the Device Forts, the section on Camber being written by the historian Martin Biddle and finally published in 1982. Biddle carried out an exploratory archaeological survey of the site in 1962 and the following year the ruins were closed to allow more extensive archaeological excavation by the Ministry. These were initially carried out by Biddle and Alan Cook, with support from local school children and from young offenders from the <b>Borstal</b> institution in Dover.|$|E
5|$|Stuart William Morgan is an English {{lorry driver}} and former heating {{engineer}} from Poole. One {{of five children}} of John and Julianne Morgan, {{he was raised in}} Tunbridge Wells, Kent, where his father was employed as a council foreman and his mother– a refugee from the former East Germany– worked as a school cleaner. Morgan left school with three CSEs, and in 1974 served a custodial sentence in <b>borstal</b> following a conviction for burglary. After attending Croydon Polytechnic to train as a plumber and heating engineer, he established a plumbing business in the Tunbridge Wells area. He moved to Dorset following the failure of that business in 1983 and worked as a heating engineer for Bournemouth Borough Council. He became a lorry driver in 1991.|$|E
5|$|Silcott was 26 {{years old}} when he was arrested, the oldest of the six charged with murder. He was born in Tottenham in 1959; his parents, both Seventh-day Adventists, had arrived in England from Montserrat two years earlier. He told Rose that he had {{experienced}} racism throughout his entire upbringing, particularly from the police. After leaving school at 15, he took a series of low-paying jobs and in 1976 began breaking into houses. The following year he was convicted of nine counts of burglary and sent to <b>borstal</b> for a few months, and in 1979 he was sentenced to six months for wounding. In September 1980 he stood trial for the murder of 19-year-old Lennie McIntosh, a postal worker, who was stabbed and killed at a party in Muswell Hill in 1979. The first trial resulted in a hung jury; a second trial saw him acquitted.|$|E
50|$|Born in the East End of Glasgow, at {{an early}} age he became {{involved}} in criminal activity, including shoplifting and burglary during the early 1960s. Although in and out of approved schools and <b>Borstals</b> during his teenage years, he was eventually recruited into the small Bar-L team, based around the Barlanark area of Glasgow and specializing in armed robbery.|$|R
40|$|A {{previous}} study {{has suggested that}} epilepsy is commoner in prisons than in the general population. We devised a standard definition of “epilepsy” and then interviewed {{a representative sample of}} the “epileptics” in prisons. The results confirmed the initial conclusion, and showed the point prevalence of epilepsy in prison and <b>Borstals</b> to be at least 7 · 1 / 1, 000 men...|$|R
25|$|Ireland {{suffered}} a severely dysfunctional upbringing. He committed various crimes {{from the age}} of 16 and had served time in <b>borstals</b> and prisons. While living in Southend, he started frequenting the Coleherne pub, a gay pub in Earl's Court. Ireland sought men who liked the passive role and sadomasochism, so he could readily restrain them as they initially believed it was a sexual game.|$|R

50|$|Ryan {{was born}} in Tipperary, Ireland, and in his youth served time in <b>borstals.</b> He was {{involved}} in film stunt work, and was injured during work in 1975 on The Slipper and the Rose released the following year. He began his series of hoaxes in the mid-1970s, he said, after one newspaper contacted the police (falsely) claiming he was the Black Panther, the armed robber and murderer.|$|R
50|$|Spurr {{joined the}} Prison Service in 1983, {{the same year}} that <b>borstals</b> were abolished, {{initially}} as a prison officer in HMP Leeds. He then moved to HMP Stanford Hill to begin training as an Assistant Governor after a year. Following the completion of his training he transferred to HMP Swaleside, before becoming Deputy Governor of HMYOI Aylesbury and then Governing Governor of the same establishment in 1993.|$|R
50|$|The Children and Young Persons Act 1908 {{introduced}} {{a set of}} regulations that {{became known as the}} Children's Charter. This imposed severe punishments for neglecting or treating children cruelly. It was made illegal to sell cigarettes to children or send them out begging. Separate juvenile courts were set up, which sent children convicted of a crime to <b>borstals</b> (a forerunner to modern youth detention centres), instead of prison.|$|R
25|$|Ireland {{was born}} in Dartford, Kent to an {{unmarried}} teenage couple. Shortly after his birth, his father left him and his 17-year-old mother. He is not named on his birth certificate and Ireland did not know his identity. He was raised in poverty by his mother; they moved many times. In the early 1960s, she married. When she became pregnant, she put Ireland into care; he later returned to her. In 1966 she married another man. During the 1960s in Sheerness, Kent, Ireland was propositioned on three occasions and spied on once by men who were sexually attracted to him. In his mid-teens, {{he was sent to}} <b>borstal</b> for theft and whilst there deliberately set fire to another resident's belongings. At age 17, Ireland was convicted of robbery. He escaped and was returned to <b>borstal.</b>|$|E
25|$|Perhaps {{her last}} {{work as an}} {{individual}} was the writing and production of the film Bambule in 1970, where she put focus {{on a group of}} <b>borstal</b> girls in West Berlin; {{by the time it was}} scheduled to be aired, she had become wanted for the breakout of Andreas Baader, and its broadcast was delayed until 1994.|$|E
25|$|Camp Hill {{is located}} {{adjacent}} {{but to the}} west of Albany and Parkhurst, on the very edge of Parkhurst Forest, having been converted first to a <b>borstal</b> and later to a Category C prison. It was built on the site of an army camp (both Albany and Parkhurst were barracks); there is a small estate of tree-lined roads with the former officers' quarters (now privately owned) to the south and east. Camp Hill closed as a prison in March 2013.|$|E
50|$|The years {{following}} {{the second world war}} saw a large increase {{in the size of the}} prison population. Despite a large prison building programme including 17 medium security and open prisons and <b>borstals,</b> prisons became more and more overcrowded leading to the introduction of 'threeing-up'. The abolition of the death penalty also led to introduction into the prison system of large numbers of decade-spanning sentences for convicted serious offenders.|$|R

The <b>Borstal's</b> Governor later informs them {{the damage to the}} dinner hall will be repaid through lost earnings. The film ends with the Governor declaring a minute's silent prayer for Davis and Toyne.|$|R
5000|$|Approved School {{is a term}} {{formerly}} used in the United Kingdom for {{a residential}} institution to which young people could be sent by a court, usually for committing offences but sometimes because they were deemed to be beyond parental control.

500|$|Friday lasted {{two months}} as a {{plasterer}} {{before moving on}} to become first a van driver for a grocery firm, then a window cleaner. His laid-back attitude and indifference was already clear: in his father's words, [...] "he didn't care". Friday regularly stole by this time, but despite numerous convictions, did not go to a detention centre until he was 16. Having been caught stealing what Tony recalled to be [...] "a car radio or something", he was released almost immediately because he suffered from asthma. However, after he re-offended three months later he was sent to Feltham <b>Borstal</b> where he served 14 months. During his time there, Friday became stronger and fitter and also starred for the <b>Borstal</b> football team. He was selected for the prison league's all-star men's team, still aged 16, and allowed out of <b>Borstal</b> to train and play with Reading's youth team, for which he appeared three times in the South East Counties League during the 1968–69 season.|$|E

5000|$|In the United States, {{a reform}} {{school was a}} penal institution, {{generally}} for teenagers. In the United Kingdom and its colonies reformatories were set up from 1830 onwards for youngsters who were {{convicted of a crime}} as an alternative to an adult prison. In parallel, [...] "Industrial schools" [...] were set up for vagrants and children needing protection. Both were 'certified' by the government from 1850, and in 1930 the systems merged and both ẃere 'approved' and became approved schools. They were distinct from <b>borstals,</b> (1902-1982 UK)- which were, enclosed juvenile prisons.|$|R
2500|$|The Probation Act 1907 {{established}} a probation service to provide supervision {{within the community}} for young offenders {{as an alternative to}} prison. In 1908, the Children and Young Persons Act 1908 formed part of the [...] "Children's Charter" [...] which imposed punishments for those neglecting children. It became illegal to sell children tobacco, alcohol and fireworks or to send children begging. Juvenile courts and <b>borstals</b> were created instead for young offenders so {{they did not have to}} stand in adult courts and go to adult prisons for most offences. The 1908 Education (Scotland) Act enforced medical inspection, free books and travel, free meals and clothing grants, and some bursaries.|$|R
5000|$|It {{established}} juvenile {{courts and}} introduced the registration of foster parents, thus regulating baby-farming and wet-nursing {{and trying to}} stamp out infanticide. Local authorities were also granted powers to keep poor children out of the poorhouse/workhouse and protect them from abuse. The act also prevented children working in dangerous trades and prevented them from purchasing cigarettes and entering pubs. The act also prevented children from learning the [...] "Tricks of the Trade" [...] in adult prisons, where children were often sent to serve time if a crime had been committed. Instead the Children's Charter had allocated <b>Borstals.</b> It eventually led to many councils setting up social services and Orphanages.|$|R
500|$|Within a year {{of moving}} to Manchester, Brady was caught with a sack full of lead seals he had stolen {{and was trying to}} smuggle out of the market. He was sent to Strangeways for three months. Because he was still under 18, he was sentenced to two years in <b>borstal</b> for [...] "training". He was sent to Latchmere House in London, and then Hatfield <b>borstal</b> in the West Riding of Yorkshire. After being {{discovered}} drunk on alcohol he had brewed he was moved to the much tougher unit at Hull. Released on 14 November 1957, Brady returned to Manchester, where he took a labouring job, which he hated, and was dismissed from another job in a brewery. Deciding to [...] "better himself", he obtained a set of instruction manuals on book-keeping from a local public library, with which he [...] "astonished" [...] his parents by studying alone in his room for hours. In January 1959, Brady applied for and was offered a clerical job at Millwards, a wholesale chemical distribution company based in Gorton. He was regarded by his colleagues as a quiet, punctual, but short-tempered young man. He read books including Teach Yourself German and Mein Kampf, as well as works on Nazi atrocities. He rode a Tiger Cub motorcycle, which he used to visit the Pennines.|$|E

5000|$|Since Gilbert and Sullivan {{used the}} phrase in The Mikado, [...] "short, sharp shock" [...] {{has been used in}} {{political}} discourse in the UK. The phrase met renewed popularity with respect to government policy on young offenders pursued by the Conservative government of 1979-1990 under Margaret Thatcher, having appeared in the 1979 Conservative Policy manifesto, which promised that the party would [...] "experiment with a tougher regime as a short, sharp shock for young criminals". These policies led to the enactment of the Criminal Justice Acts of 1982 and 1988 which, among other reforms, replaced <b>borstals</b> with the youth detention centres in place today.|$|R
50|$|A {{number of}} his works {{achieved}} notoriety and widespread criticism from the conservative end of the political spectrum, including Scum (1977), dealing with the subject of <b>borstals</b> (youth prisons), which was banned by the BBC, and subsequently remade by Clarke as a feature film released in 1979 (the original television version was only screened after his death). Clarke directed the television play Made in Britain (1982), starring Tim Roth (in his television debut) as a racist skinhead and his negative relationship with authorities and racial minorities, from a screenplay by David Leland. The feature film Rita, Sue and Bob Too (1987), was adapted by the working class writer Andrea Dunbar from her stage work.|$|R

2500|$|The {{album cover}} {{features}} {{a photograph of}} a thirteen-year-old Irish Catholic boy carrying his belongings after being forced from his home in Belfast, Northern Ireland because of civil unrest in 1971.

50|$|Working {{with her}} {{graduate}} students at Newcastle University, Heathcote {{spent much of}} the late 1970s and 80's researching, developing, and evaluating Mantle of the Expert across a range of settings - primary and secondary schools, special schools, <b>borstals,</b> and adult and child mental hospitals. Her method was to teach week long sessions, planned in advance with her students, which involved them playing different roles in the classroom. Although often involving a great deal of improvisation and discussion, Heathcote's Mantle of the Expert contexts were carefully planned and often elaborately embellished with resources, props, and costumes created by the graduate students. Essentially experimental in nature, these sessions were discussed, analysed, and evaluated by Heathcote and her students, and formed the foundations for the student's studies of the approach. In some cases these 'experiments' were documented.|$|R
5000|$|Mitchell was one {{of seven}} {{children}} born into a working-class family from Limehouse, East London. At the age of nine he stole a bicycle from another child, {{for which he was}} taken before a juvenile court and put on probation. As an adult, Mitchell possessed great physical strength and liked to demonstrate it by lifting a grand piano off the floor or picking up two fully-grown men, one in each hand. He also had a short temper and, according to Martin Fido, [...] "the mind of a child of 13 or under". From the age of 17 Mitchell was regularly incarcerated in <b>borstals</b> and prisons, mostly for shop-breaking and larceny.

5000|$|In {{response}} to this categorisation, Sillitoe once regarded this connection by commenting on a pretend book called “Hurry on Jim by Kingsley Wain that started by someone with eighteen pints and fifteen whiskies in him falling downstairs on this way to the top”. It is suggested that Sillitoe was never simply an “angry young man” but someone who {{would continue to be}} bitter despite youth, due to his deep hatred for class. The [...] "Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner" [...] was only the beginning of his “revolutionary philosophy” that became clear in his other works. [...] "The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner" [...] suggests a revolution to combat class issues of the time. Smith says “in the end the governor is going to be doomed while blokes like me will take the pickings of his roasted bones and dance like maniacs around his <b>Borstal’s</b> ruins”. While it was suggested at the time that Sillitoe created a character to express extreme views, as time passed it has become clear that Sillitoe and Smith’s views are not very different.|$|R
