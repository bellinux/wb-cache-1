40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{consideration of}} how lesbian mothers negotiate maternal identities in families {{where there are}} two mothers but only one birth mother. Although this paper considers only one specific family arrangement, it does acknowledge the diverse structures of lesbian families including single lesbian mothers and couples where neither mother has a biological link with their baby. Some narratives of lesbian headed families with one biological mother suggest that maternal identities may be negotiated through the equal distribution of maternal care, domestic work and paid work, {{which could lead to}} egalitarian parenting roles. A division of labour such as this also has the potential to eliminate or reduce biologically based separation between birth and non-birth mothers. Based on research conducted on modernised versions of <b>breast</b> <b>milk</b> sharing, this overview article aims to suggest possible ways that the unconventional or alternative uses of <b>breast</b> <b>milk</b> may be useful in rethinking the separation between birth and non-birth mothers (in families where this distinction is relevant) and the division of labour when caring for children. These alternative uses include the provision of <b>breast</b> <b>milk</b> by non-birth mothers, particularly through inducing lactation and having their infant suckle at the breast, and the buying and selling of <b>breast</b> <b>milk</b> <b>collected</b> from lactating women. Importantly, these are all methods which have been used successfully by other non biological mothers such as adoptive mothers. Through the interviews, observations and wider reading that I have conducted as part of my own research, I highlight these alternative uses for <b>breast</b> <b>milk</b> which lesbian co-parents could incorporate into their parenting roles in order to establish identity based around the embodiment of breast feeding or the provision of <b>breast</b> <b>milk</b> if it is their desire to do so. These unconventional uses of <b>breast</b> <b>milk</b> may offer strategies for lesbian-headed families (and other family forms where not all family members are biologically related, such as in adoptive families) to minimise the difference between birth mother and non-birth mother and, thus, facilitate their equal recognition as dual mothers from the very early stages of their parenting experience.

Seventy-nine percent of the donors resided in the Seoul-Kyunggi area, and 60 &# 37; of the donors were in their 30 s. Most information and motivation came from the Internet (66 &# 37;) or television (14 &# 37;). A total of 2, 736 L of <b>breast</b> <b>milk</b> was <b>collected,</b> and 1, 979 L were processed. The cumulative number of recipients was 160 preterm or full-term infants and 21 adults, each group receiving the <b>breast</b> <b>milk</b> 337 and 41 times, respectively. In total, infants received 1, 663 L and adults received 179 L. Conclusion : Through the present study, the role and importance of a human <b>milk</b> bank in <b>collecting,</b> pasteurizing, and storing surplus <b>breast</b> <b>milk</b> in through sanitary, medically proven methods and providing this <b>breast</b> <b>milk</b> to recipients could be appreciated and reevaluated.

40|$|Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are food-chain {{contaminants}} {{that have}} been shown to induce adverse developmental effects in humans. In the course of an epidemiologic study established to investigate neurodevelopmental deficits induced by environmental PCB exposure in the Inuit population of northern Québec (Nunavik, Canada), we compared three biomarkers of prenatal exposure and models to predict PCB plasma concentration at 6 months postpartum. Concentrations of 14 PCB congeners were measured by high-resolution gas chromatography with electron capture detection in lipids extracted from maternal plasma, cord plasma, <b>breast</b> <b>milk</b> (<b>collected</b> at ~ 1 month postpartum), and 6 -month-old infant plasma samples. Similar congener profiles were observed in all biologic samples, and PCB- 153, the most abundant and persistent PCB congener, was strongly correlated with other frequently detected PCB congeners in all biologic media. When expressed on a lipid basis, maternal plasma, cord plasma, and milk concentrations of this congener were strongly intercorrelated, indicating that PCB concentration in any of these biologic media is a good indicator of prenatal exposure to PCBs. A multivariate model that included maternal PCB- 153 plasma lipid concentration, breast-feeding duration, and the sum of two skin-fold thicknesses (an index of infant body fat mass) explained 72 % of PCB- 153 plasma concentration variance a...|$|R
40|$|Transmission {{of human}} {{immunodeficiency}} virus type 1 (HIV- 1) via breast-feeding can occur throughout lactation. Defining both fluctuation in breast-milk virus level over time and how breast-milk virus correlates with mother-to-child transmission is important for establishing effective interventions. We quantified breast-milk HIV- 1 RNA levels in serial samples collected from 275 women for up to 2 years after delivery. Higher maternal plasma virus load, lower maternal CD 4 T cell count, and detection of HIV- 1 DNA in maternal genital secretions {{were significantly associated with}} elevated breast-milk HIV- 1 RNA. Within women who breast-fed, median virus load in colostrum/early milk was significantly higher than that in mature <b>breast</b> <b>milk</b> <b>collected</b> 14 days after delivery (). Breast-feeding mothers who transmitted HIV- 1 to their infants had bothP. 004 significantly higher breast-milk viral RNA throughout lactation and more-consistent viral shedding, compared with mothers who did not transmit HIV- 1. In breast-feeding women, a 2 -fold–increased risk of transmission was associated with every 10 -fold increase in breast-milk virus load (95 % confidence interval, 1. 3 – 3. 0; P!). These results indicate that the risk of infant infection from breast-feeding is influenced by breast-milk. 001 virus load, which is highest early after delivery.

40|$|BackgroundMost {{premature}} {{babies are}} discharged with low body weight. Creamatocrit represents the lipid concentration of <b>breast</b> <b>milk.</b> We expected the creamatocrit technique {{could be applied}} in the nutrition plan for premature infants who were exclusively fed by human milk. MethodsBreast milk samples {{were obtained from the}} mothers whose babies were admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit or sick baby room. The <b>breast</b> <b>milk</b> provider was enrolled under the criteria of stable <b>breast</b> <b>milk</b> expression 2 weeks after having given birth. <b>Breast</b> <b>milk</b> was <b>collected</b> for 7 consequent days. Creamatocrit technique and calorie analysis were performed on the processed <b>breast</b> <b>milk</b> samples. ResultsFourteen pairs of mothers and infants were enrolled in our study. The median gestational age and birth weight were 29 weeks (27 – 36 weeks) and 1393 g (680 – 3050 g), respectively. The mean calorie and creamatocrit values for all the 98 <b>breast</b> <b>milk</b> samples were 0. 67 kcal/mL and 5. 98 %, respectively. The linear correlation between creamatocrit value and laboratory-measured calories was found to be calories (kcal/mL) = 0. 39 + 0. 048 ×creamatocrit (%) (p< 0. 05).

40|$|Levels of {{chemicals}} in humans (body burdens) are useful indicators {{of environmental quality}} and of community health. Chemical body burdens are easily monitored using <b>breast</b> <b>milk</b> samples <b>collected</b> from first-time mothers (primiparae) with infants 2 – 8 weeks of age. Currently, there is no body-burden monitoring program using <b>breast</b> <b>milk</b> in the United States, although ad hoc systems operate successfully in several European countries. In this article we describe the value of such monitoring and important considerations of {{how it might be}} accomplished, drawing from our experiences with pilot monitoring projects. <b>Breast</b> <b>milk</b> has several advantages as a sampling matrix: It is simple and noninvasive, with samples collected by the mother. It monitors body burdens in reproductive-age women and it estimates in utero and nursing-infant exposures, all important to community health. Time-trend data from <b>breast</b> <b>milk</b> monitoring serve as a warning system that identifies chemicals whose body burdens and human exposures are increasing. Time trends also serve as a report card on how well past regulatory actions have reduced environmental chemical exposures. Body-burden monitoring using <b>breast</b> <b>milk</b> should include educational programs that encourage breast-feeding. Finally, and most important, clean <b>breast</b> <b>milk</b> matters to people and leads to primary prevention—the limiting of chemical exposures. We illustrate thes...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{investigate}} the raw milk hygiene and quality among the small holder dairy farmers in Tawau area. A total of 216 samples were collected from the respective dairy farmers and <b>milk</b> <b>collecting</b> <b>centre</b> located at Mile 15, Tawau. Preliminary results indicated that the quality of the raw milks obtained at farm level contained were inferior with high bacteria load (> than 107 CFU/ml). The total coliform (2. 9 - 3. 8 CFU/mL) and Staphylococcus count (2. 3 - 3. 6 CFU/mL) were relatively high in certain samples. However, none of the food borne pathogens was found. Trace back study revealed that the causes of contamination were attributed by poor hygienic handling among the dairy farmers and insufficient for immediate chilling of raw milk. A significant reduction in bacteria load was observed if the raw milk chilled immediately at farm. The implementation of modified pre-milking sanitizing practices improved the microbiology quality of the raw milks obtained from respective dairy farms. Future study will focus more on the effect of prolong storage towards the microbiological quality of raw milk...|$|R
40|$|The H 4 IIE rat {{hepatoma}} {{cell line}} was {{employed as a}} cell model to screen 7 -ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase (EROD) -TCDD equivalents (EROD-TEQ) of human <b>breast</b> <b>milk</b> samples <b>collected</b> from Hong Kong and Guangzhou, China. The screening methods employed a 96 -well plate spectrofluorometer-EROD assay. For cell-line validation, our results demonstrated a dose-dependent increase in the Ah receptor-mediated response (i. e., CYP 1 A 1 mRNA and EROD) of the cells upon exposure {{to a number of}} known Ah receptor agonists, including 2, 3, 7, 8 -tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), 2, 3, 7, 8 -tetrachlorodibenzothiophene, benzo[a]pyrene, and β-naphthaflavone. TCDD induced CYP 1 A 1 mRNA and EROD was in a close positive correlation (r= 0. 98). For the screening of dioxin-like compounds, <b>breast</b> <b>milk</b> samples <b>collected</b> during lactation weeks 3 - 5 were used. One hundred (from Hong Kong) and 48 (from Guangzhou) <b>breast</b> <b>milk</b> samples were assayed, of which 65 % and 68 % of the samples, respectively, showed detectable dioxin-like activities using the H 4 IIE cell EROD screening method. For sixty-five samples from Hong Kong the mean EROD-TEQ values ranged from 58. 1 to 96. 5 pg/g of milk fat for those aged 21 - 36 years while 32 samples from Guangzhou had mean values of 98. 8 - 202. 1 pg/g of milk fat. In comparisons of the EROD-TEQ values for different age groups from both cities, {{there were no significant differences}} (P< 0. 05). However, the mean and median EROD-TEQ values of the Guangzhou population were in general higher than those of the Hong Kong population. The results of the present study indicate that it is feasible to use the H 4 IIE cell-line as a model for screening dioxin-like compounds in human <b>breast</b> <b>milk.</b> In addition, the method is rapid and cost-effective, particularly for a routine and high-throughput sample screening analysis, compared to the costly and time-intensive chemical analytical techniques. © 2003 Elsevier Inc.
