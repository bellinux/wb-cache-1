5|$|In January 2001, Connex Norge {{offered to}} {{purchase}} Timetoget from NSB, and start operations. However, by February, Connex had changed their mind, {{and no longer}} wanted to purchase the company. Terje <b>Bulling</b> admitted that Timetoget {{had a very good}} agreement for operating the Arendal Line, and that a fourth Y1 railcar had been bought from Sweden for this route. However, when NSB had tried to sell Timetoget, this agreement {{was not part of the}} estate. By April, NSB estimated that they had lost NOK10 million on their engagement in Timetoget. However, they had three Y1 trains, and would be able to start using them on the Bratsberg Line and the Arendal Line.|$|E
5|$|The {{first trial}} with the Y1 railcars was {{performed}} on 1August 2000. The one unit {{was not able to}} complete the route due to technical problems, but the other train was able to. Terje <b>Bulling,</b> the CEO of Timetoget, stated that he was aiming for 140,000 passengers in 2001, but was worried because NSB, due to lack of engineers, was driving passengers with by taxi between Notodden Station and Nordagutu. On 5October, Vidar Østreng, vice president in NSB and chairman of Timetoget, announced that NSB, due to lack of engineers, would have to reduce the production of train services. He indicated that the least profitable routes, including the Bratsberg Line, would be closed. At the same time, NSB said one possibility could be that they sold their 89% stake in the company, thereby bypassing NSB's rules for engineer training. Five days later, the engineers in NSB stated that they would not operate trains between Larvik Station and Skien, and Kongsberg Station and Bø Station, if Timetoget was allowed to operate. These sections of the Vestfold Line and Sørlandet Line, respectively, are shared with the Bratsberg Line. The engineers considered lack of sufficient training such a safety risk {{that it would not be}} secure to operate on the lines. At the same time, NSB announced that they would stop operating trains on the Bratsberg Line from 20October.|$|E
25|$|The fight {{took place}} at MGM Grand Garden Arena. From round one, Mayweather tagged Ortiz repeatedly.

Not only was he gambling as he had never gambled before, but he was gambling at the biggest table {{in the world and}} for stakes so large that even the case-hardened habitues of that table were compelled to sit up. In spite of the unlimited selling, his persistent buying compelled Ward Valley steadily to rise, and as Thursday approached, the situation became acute. Something had to smash. How much Ward Valley was this Klondike gambler going to buy? How much could he buy? What was the Ward Valley crowd doing all this time? Daylight appreciated the interviews with them that appeared--interviews delightfully placid and non-committal. Leon Guggenhammer even hazarded the opinion that this Northland Croesus might possibly be making a mistake. But not that they cared, John Dowsett explained. Nor did they object. While in the dark regarding his intentions, of one thing they were certain; namely, that he was <b>bulling</b> Ward Valley. And they did not mind that. No matter what happened to him and his spectacular operations, Ward Valley was all right, and would remain all right, as firm as the Rock of Gibraltar. No; they had no Ward Valley to sell, thank you.

60|$|This son it was {{who kept}} them in the {{neighborhood}} of London, for the Admiral was as fond of ships and of salt water as ever, and was as happy in the sheets of a two-ton yacht as on the bridge of his sixteen-knot monitor. Had he been untied, the Devonshire or Hampshire coast would certainly have been his choice. There was Harold, however, and Harold's interests were their chief care. Harold was four-and-twenty now. Three years before he had been taken in hand by an acquaintance of his father's, the head of a considerable firm of stock-brokers, and fairly launched upon 'Change. His three hundred guinea entrance fee paid, his three sureties of five hundred pounds each found, his name approved by the Committee, and all other formalities complied with, he found himself whirling round, an insignificant unit, in the vortex of the money market of the world. There, under the guidance of his father's friend, he was instructed in the mysteries of <b>bulling</b> and of bearing, in the strange usages of 'Change in the intricacies of carrying over and of transferring. He learned to know where to place his clients' money, which of the jobbers would make a price in New Zealands, and which would touch nothing but American rails, which might be trusted and which shunned. All this, and much more, he mastered, and to such purpose that he soon began to prosper, to retain the clients who had been recommended to him, and to attract fresh ones. But the work was never congenial. He had inherited from his father his love of the air of heaven, his affection for a manly and natural existence. To act as middleman between the pursuer of wealth, and the wealth which he pursued, or to stand as a human barometer, registering {{the rise and fall of}} the great mammon pressure in the markets, was not the work for which Providence had placed those broad shoulders and strong limbs upon his well knit frame. His dark open face, too, with his straight Grecian nose, well opened brown eyes, and round black-curled head, were all those of a man who was fashioned for active physical work. Meanwhile he was popular with his fellow brokers, respected by his clients, and beloved at home, but his spirit was restless within him and his mind chafed unceasingly against his surroundings.|$|E

[...] "Something you just now said." [...] "What did I say?" [...] "About our taking pains." [...] "To cock the hay?--because it's going to shower? [...] I said {{that more than half}} an hour ago.

[...] The hand that knows his business won't be told [...] To do work better or faster--those two things. [...] I'm as particular as anyone: [...] Most likely I'd have served you just the same. [...] But I know you don't understand our ways. [...] You were just talking what was in your mind, [...] What was in all our minds, and you weren't hinting. [...] Tell you a story of what happened once: [...] I was up here in Salem at a man's [...] Named Sanders with a gang of four or five [...] Doing the haying. No one liked the boss. [...] He was one of the kind sports call a spider, [...] All wiry arms and legs that spread out wavy [...] From a humped body nigh as big's a biscuit. [...] But work! that man could work, especially [...] If by so doing he could get more work [...] Out of his hired help. I'm not denying [...] He was hard on himself. I couldn't find [...] That he kept any hours--not for himself. [...] Daylight and lantern-light were one to him: [...] I've heard him pounding in the barn all night. [...] But what he liked was someone to encourage. [...] Them that he couldn't lead he'd get behind [...] And drive, the way you can, you know, in mowing-- [...] Keep at their heels and threaten to mow their legs off. [...] I'd seen about enough of his <b>bulling</b> tricks [...] (We call that <b>bulling).</b> I'd been watching him. [...] So when he paired off with me in the hayfield [...] To load the load, thinks I, Look out for trouble. [...] I built the load and topped it off; old Sanders [...] Combed it down with a rake and says, 'O. K.' [...] Everything went well till we reached the barn [...] With a big catch to empty in a bay. [...] You understand that meant the easy job [...] For the man up on top of throwing down [...] The hay and rolling it off wholesale, [...] Where on a mow it would have been slow lifting. [...] You wouldn't think a fellow'd need much urging [...] Under these circumstances, would you now? [...] But the old fool seizes his fork in both hands, [...] And looking up bewhiskered out of the pit, [...] Shouts like an army captain, 'Let her come!' [...] Thinks I, D'ye mean it? 'What was that you said?' [...] I asked out loud, so's there'd be no mistake, [...] 'Did you say, Let her come?' 'Yes, let her come.' [...] He said it over, but he said it softer. [...] Never you say a thing like that to a man, [...] Not if he values what he is. God, I'd as soon [...] Murdered him as left out his middle name. [...] I'd built the load and knew right where to find it. [...] Two or three forkfuls I picked lightly round for [...] Like meditating, and then I just dug in [...] And dumped the rackful on him in ten lots. [...] I looked over the side once in the dust [...] And caught sight of him treading-water-like, [...] Keeping his head above. 'Damn ye,' I says, [...] 'That gets ye!' He squeaked like a squeezed rat. [...] That was the last I saw or heard of him. [...] I cleaned the rack and drove out to cool off. [...] As I sat mopping hayseed from my neck, [...] And sort of waiting to be asked about it, [...] One of the boys sings out, 'Where's the old man?' [...] 'I left him in the barn under the hay. [...] If ye want him, ye can go and dig him out.' [...] They realized from the way I swobbed my neck [...] More than was needed something must be up. [...] They headed for the barn; I stayed where I was. [...] They told me afterward. First they forked hay, [...] A lot of it, out into the barn floor. [...] Nothing! They listened for him. Not a rustle. [...] I guess they thought I'd spiked him in the temple [...] Before I buried him, or I couldn't have managed. [...] They excavated more. 'Go keep his wife [...] Out of the barn.' Someone looked in a window, [...] And curse me if he wasn't in the kitchen [...] Slumped way down in a chair, with both his feet [...] Stuck in the oven, the hottest day that summer. [...] He looked so clean disgusted from behind [...] There was no one that dared to stir him up, [...] Or let him know that he was being looked at. [...] Apparently I hadn't buried him [...] (I may have knocked him down); but my just trying [...] To bury him had hurt his dignity. [...] He had gone to the house so's not to meet me. [...] He kept away from us all afternoon. [...] We tended to his hay. We saw him out [...] After a while picking peas in his garden: [...] He couldn't keep away from doing something." [...] "Weren't you relieved to find he wasn't dead?" [...] "No! and yet I don't know--it's hard to say. [...] I went about to kill him fair enough." [...] "You took an awkward way.
