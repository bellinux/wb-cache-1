5|$|By {{the time}} Marcos was campaigning to become President, Imelda's {{influence}} in Marcos's political career was crucial. Her husband may have <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> tactician, {{but it was}} Imelda's determination and popularity that ensured votes for him. Marcos heavily relied on Imelda, and as time passed, Imelda {{was no longer a}} clone of Marcos. Instead, she had become his political partner.|$|E
5|$|Stuart {{was born}} in Ottawa, Ontario, the eldest son of William Stuart and Rachel Hodgson. He had two brothers, Alex and Bruce, and two sisters, Jessie and Lottio. Stuart was {{involved}} in sports from an early age. His father had <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> curler and was once point skip of the Ottawa Curling Club, and both Hod and Bruce played hockey from a young age, often for the same teams. Stuart also played rugby and football, and played for the local professional football team, the Ottawa Rough Riders.|$|E
5|$|The UCR and the Frepaso united as a {{political}} coalition, the Alliance for Work, Justice and Education, led by Alfonsín, Fernando delaRúa and Rodolfo Terragno from the UCR, and Carlos Álvarez and Graciela Fernández Meijide from the Frepaso. The coalition won the 1997 legislative elections. Alfonsín {{did not agree with}} delaRúa about the fixed exchange rate used by then. He thought that it had <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> measure in the past but had become detrimental to the Argentine economy, while delaRúa supported it.|$|E

5|$|Her {{mother took}} {{an active role}} in her daughter's {{education}}, taking her to the library often. Celia had <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> student in her youth, graduating from high school at age fifteen, yet could not further her own education because her family chose to send her brother to college instead. Celia wanted her daughter to get more education, which she thought would allow Ruth to become a high school history teacher. Ruth attended James Madison High School, whose law program later dedicated a courtroom in her honor. Celia struggled with cancer throughout Ruth's high school years and died the day before Ruth's high school graduation.|$|E
5|$|The safety fougasse design had the {{advantage}} that without the propelling charge the fougasse was sufficiently safe {{that it did not}} require a guard. Banks records that installing the charge only when there was clear danger relatively close at hand was a safety feature required to protect the public from accidents. The ammonal used for the main propellant charge is a cheap industrial explosive that is notoriously hygroscopic, becoming less effective when it absorbs moisture. Even though the charge was packed into a rubber bag in a tin and sealed with insulating tape, it would not have <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> idea to store it for long in the damp conditions of a flame fougasse installation.|$|E
5|$|Trew {{contends that}} the capture of {{northern}} Caen had a psychological impact on the French population, convincing them the Allies were there to stay and that the liberation of France could not be far off. By Operation Charnwood's conclusion, Allied losses since 6 June had amounted to over 30,000 men, excluding {{those who had been}} evacuated due to sickness and those suffering from battle exhaustion. Buckley believes Charnwood to have <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> idea but one that proved better in concept than in execution, influenced as it was by the mounting political pressure on 21st Army Group to produce results. Copp wrote that the broad-based assault plan across the entire front worked, preventing the Germans bringing to bear superior firepower on any one formation.|$|E

[...] As thus put, the question admits of but one reply. But as thus put, it assumes the point at issue. We contend that, as appetite <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> guide to all the lower creation--as it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> guide to the infant--as it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> guide to the invalid--as it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> guide to the differently-placed races of men--and as it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> guide for every adult who leads a healthful life; it may safely be inferred that it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> guide for childhood.

25|$|For {{several years}} Brixttofte was the Mayor of Farum with his party having had an {{absolute}} majority.

25|$|Some {{argue that}} it is {{impossible}} to do the calculation that utilitarianism requires because consequences are inherently unknowable. Daniel Dennett describes this as the Three Mile Island effect. Dennett points out that not only is it impossible to assign a precise utility value to the incident, it is impossible to know whether, ultimately, the near-meltdown that occurred was a good or bad thing. He suggests that it would have <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> thing if plant operators learned lessons that prevented future serious incidents.|$|E
25|$|It {{was never}} a success financially. In fact, we lost money, if I {{remember}} correctly, on every single release bar one. I did quite like it but it was terribly indulgent. Not as indulgent {{as it would have}} been had I not had a business partner, admittedly... I liked having a label. It enabled you to put out stuff that you liked without, in those days, having to worry about whether it was going to work commercially. I've never <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> business man.|$|E

He gave up on his accounting work and focused entirely on his boxing career.|$|E

25|$|R. B. Bennett's {{family was}} poor, {{subsisting}} {{mainly on the}} produce of a small farm. His early days inculcated a lifelong habit of thrift. The driving force in his family was his mother. She was a Wesleyan Methodist and passed this faith and the Protestant ethic on to her son. Bennett's father {{does not appear to}} have <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> provider for his family, though the reason is unclear. He operated a general store for a while and tried to develop some gypsum deposits.|$|E

If he had killed her, he asked, why would he have cooperated with the police investigation {{as much as he}} had, to the point of allowing officers to search his home without obtaining a search warrant?
