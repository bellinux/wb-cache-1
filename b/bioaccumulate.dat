5|$|Amanita regalis has {{the ability}} to <b>bioaccumulate</b> the heavy metal vanadium, a {{phenomenon}} first reported in Amanita muscaria in 1931. A field study of Scandinavian specimens found vanadium contents ranging from 38 to 169mg of vanadium per kg of dry mushroom (average of 119mg/kg). For comparison, the vanadium concentration in most other mushrooms is typically less than 2mg/kg.|$|E
5|$|Fruit bodies can <b>bioaccumulate</b> heavy metals, {{including}} toxic ones, from polluted soil. For this reason, consuming mushrooms {{harvested from}} potentially contaminated sites—such as near roadsides subject to heavy traffic—is not recommended. In a Turkish study of various edible mushroom species collected from lawns, near roads, {{and the inner}} parts of forests, the fruit bodies of L.sanguifluus were determined to have accumulated high levels of zinc, manganese, nickel, cobalt, cadmium, and lead.|$|E
5|$|Lithium {{is found}} in trace amount in {{numerous}} plants, plankton, and invertebrates, at concentrations of 69 to 5,760 parts per billion (ppb).

5|$|A {{study of}} trace {{elements}} in mushrooms {{in the eastern}} Black Sea Region of Turkey found E.sinuatum to have {{the highest levels of}} copper (64.8 ± 5.9μg/g dried material—insufficient to be toxic) and zinc (198μg/g) recorded. Caps and stalks tested in an area with high levels of mercury in southeastern Poland showed it to <b>bioaccumulate</b> much higher levels of mercury than other fungi. The element was also found in high levels in the humus-rich substrate. Entoloma sinuatum also accumulates arsenic-containing compounds. Of the roughly 40μg of arsenic present per gram of fresh mushroom tissue, about 8% was arsenite and the other 92% was arsenate.|$|E
5|$|It is {{considered}} a threatened species in the Åland Islands of Finland. A study of the species' distribution in Sweden reported that in the 1940s and 50s, it grew in beech woods with broad-leaved grasses and herbs in topsoils with soil pH levels between 5.0 and 6.6, but the populations have since decreased owing to soil acidification during the last several decades. Fruit bodies collected near arsenic-contaminated sites {{have been shown to}} <b>bioaccumulate</b> arsenic, largely in the form of arsenobetaine.|$|E
5|$|Most {{ingested}} uranium is excreted during digestion. Only 0.5% {{is absorbed}} when insoluble forms of uranium, {{such as its}} oxide, are ingested, whereas absorption of the more soluble uranyl ion can be up to 5%. However, soluble uranium compounds tend to quickly pass through the body, whereas insoluble uranium compounds, especially when inhaled by way of dust into the lungs, pose a more serious exposure hazard. After entering the bloodstream, the absorbed uranium tends to <b>bioaccumulate</b> and stay {{for many years in}} bone tissue because of uranium's affinity for phosphates. Uranium is not absorbed through the skin, and alpha particles released by uranium cannot penetrate the skin.|$|E

5|$|The Asiatic dayflower is {{considered}} a weed both in areas where it was introduced and {{in certain parts of}} its native range. The flowers' interactions with pollinators have been well studied and have helped to support important hypotheses about pollination in the field of plant ecology. Recent research has also revealed that the Asiatic dayflower can <b>bioaccumulate</b> a number of metals, making it a candidate for revegetating and essentially cleaning spoiled copper mines. Several animals and fungi use the plant as a food source, with a few species feeding upon it exclusively.|$|E
5|$|The Atlantic puffin {{and other}} pelagic birds are {{excellent}} bioindicators {{of the environment}} as they occupy a high trophic level. Heavy metals and other pollutants are concentrated through the food chain and, as fish are the primary food source for Atlantic puffins, there is great potential for them to <b>bioaccumulate</b> heavy metals such as mercury and arsenic. Measurements can be made on eggs, feathers or internal organs and beached bird surveys, accompanied by chemical analysis of feathers, can be effective indicators of marine pollution by lipophilic substances as well as metals. In fact these surveys {{can be used to}} provide evidence of the adverse effects of a particular pollutant, using fingerprinting techniques to provide evidence suitable for the prosecution of offenders.|$|E
5|$|Agaricus bernardii is a {{saprobic}} species. Its mushrooms fruit singly, scattered, or {{in groups}} on the ground. They grow in sandy soils, lawns, and in habitats with a high salt concentration, like along ocean coasts and salt marshes. Once primarily a maritime species, the fungus has spread inland to roadside verges where salt {{has been applied to}} de-ice the roads. Fruit bodies sometimes form underground. Mushrooms can also grow in fairy rings, especially when in grasslands or pastures. A Czech study determined that the mushrooms will strongly <b>bioaccumulate</b> silver from contaminated soil. Although the average concentration of silver in the soil is typically less than 1 milligram per kilogram of soil, it can be significantly elevated near industrial sites such as mines and smelters. The concentration of silver in the caps—which reached levels of up to 544mg per kg of mushroom tissue (dry weight)—was about twice that of the stems.|$|E

5|$|First {{described}} scientifically by Elias Fries in 1818, the {{bay bolete}} was reclassified as Xerocomus badius in 1931, {{and it is}} still listed thus in several sources. Modern molecular phylogenetic studies show Xerocomus to be polyphyletic (not descended from a common ancestor), and the bay bolete is not particularly closely related to species in that genus. Often considered a poor relation of the cep (Boletus edulis), I.badia is nevertheless regarded as a choice edible mushroom by some authors, such as food expert Antonio Carluccio, and is sold in markets in Europe and central Mexico. Its mushrooms are less often infested by maggots than other boletes. Several European studies have demonstrated that the mushroom can <b>bioaccumulate</b> some trace metals from the soil, such as mercury, cobalt, and nickel. Additionally, the mushroom contains a pigment that concentrates radioactive caesium; specimens collected in Europe following the 1986 Chernobyl disaster had 137Cs concentrations several times greater than those collected before the incident.|$|E
5|$|Lactarius sanguifluus, {{commonly}} known as the bloody milk cap, is a species of fungus in the family Russulaceae. First described from France in 1811, the species was given its current name by Elias Fries in 1838 when he transferred it to Lactarius. Found in Asia, Mediterranean Africa, and Europe, fruit bodies (mushrooms) grow scattered or in groups on the ground under conifers, especially Douglas fir. When bruised or cut, the fruit bodies ooze a blood-red to purple latex that slowly turns greenish upon exposure to air. The caps are orangish to reddish-brown, and become funnel-shaped with age. The gills are pinkish to purplish. Different forms have been described from Italy, but these are not universally accepted as distinct. L.sanguifluus mushrooms are edible, and sold in rural markets of Europe and Asia. Fruit bodies grown in polluted soil, including roadsides subject to heavy traffic, can <b>bioaccumulate</b> toxic heavy metals. Several sterols and pigment have been isolated and identified from the mushrooms.|$|E
5|$|The flavour {{has been}} {{described}} as nutty and slightly meaty, with a smooth, creamy texture, and a distinctive aroma reminiscent of sourdough. Young, small porcini are most appreciated by gourmets, as the large ones often harbour maggots (insect larvae), and become slimy, soft and less tasty with age. Fruit bodies are collected by holding the stipe near the base and twisting gently. Cutting the stipe with a knife may risk the part left behind rotting and the mycelium being destroyed. Peeling and washing are not recommended. The fruit bodies are highly perishable, due largely to the high water content (around 90%), the high level of enzyme activity, and the presence of a flora of microorganisms. Caution should be exercised when collecting specimens from potentially polluted or contaminated sites, as several {{studies have shown that the}} fruit bodies can <b>bioaccumulate</b> toxic heavy metals like mercury, cadmium, caesium and polonium. Bioaccumulated metals or radioactive fission decay products are like chemical signatures: chemical and radiochemical analysis can be used to identify the origin of imported specimens, and for long-term radioecological monitoring of polluted areas.|$|E

5|$|The fruit bodies can <b>bioaccumulate</b> {{the toxic}} heavy metal arsenic {{from the soil}} {{in the form of}} the {{compound}} methylarsonic acid. Although less toxic than arsenic trioxide, it is still relatively dangerous. Concentrations over 1000mg/kg (dry weight) are often reached. As reported in one 2004 publication, a mature specimen collected near the town of Český Šternberk in the Czech Republic was found to have an arsenic content of 7090mg/kg dry weight, the highest concentration ever reported in a mushroom. Typically, the arsenic content of mycorrhizal mushrooms collected from unpolluted areas is lower than 1mg/kg. In a 2007 Turkish study of 23 wild edible mushroom species (collected from areas not known to be polluted), S.coronaria had the highest concentration of arsenic at 8.8mg/kg dry weight, while the arsenic concentration of the other tested mushrooms ranged from 0.003mg/kg (in Sarcodon leucopus) to 0.54mg/kg (in Lactarius salmonicolor).|$|E
