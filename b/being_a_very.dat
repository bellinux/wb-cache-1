5|$|Series {{creator and}} {{executive}} producer David Chase served as showrunner and head writer {{for the production of}} all six seasons of the show. He was deeply involved with the general production of every episode and is noted for <b>being</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> controlling, demanding and specific producer. In addition to writing or co-writing 2–7 episodes per season, Chase would oversee all the editing, consult with episode directors, give actors character motivation, approve casting choices and set designs and do extensive but uncredited re-writes of episodes written by other writers.|$|E

Leslie's father, Bill Burke (Latham Gaines), tells Jess that she loved him, and thanks him for <b>being</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> good friend to her, since she had trouble making friends at her old school. Jess feels overwhelming guilt for Leslie's death, but his father consoles him to keep their friendship alive for her sake.|$|E
5|$|The keep {{is unusual}} {{both for the}} period and for Devon as a whole, <b>being</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> strong {{defensive}} structure, albeit without any independent source of water or facilities to support a garrison {{in the event of}} a siege. Other rectangular 11th century keeps in Devon existed, including at Exter and Lydford, and were typically associated with the king or major nobles. Few were built on top of fresh mottes, as at Okehampton, and this may have been made possible in this case because the motte was largely natural and therefore able to support the heavy weight.|$|E

5|$|Ultimately Hercule {{was forced}} to {{surrender}} after attempts to board Mars failed. Both ships were battered and burnt, with the French suffering at least 290 casualties and the British 90. Hercule was conveyed to Britain in the aftermath and later repaired and served in the Royal Navy until 1810. Both L'Héritier and the deceased Hood were highly praised for their conduct during the battle, which is noted as <b>being</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> rare example {{during this period of}} an action between two ships of approximately equal strength without any external influence.|$|E
5|$|Copernicium is {{the tenth}} and last {{member of the}} 6d series and is the {{heaviest}} group 12 element in the periodic table, below zinc, cadmium and mercury. It is predicted to differ significantly from the lighter group12 elements. The valence s-subshells of the group 12 elements and period 7 elements {{are expected to be}} relativistically contracted most strongly at copernicium. This and the closed-shell configuration of copernicium result in it probably <b>being</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> noble metal. Its metallic bonds should also be very weak, possibly making it extremely volatile, like the noble gases, and potentially making it gaseous at room temperature. However, it should be able to form metal–metal bonds with copper, palladium, platinum, silver, and gold; these bonds are predicted to be only about 15–20kJ/mol weaker than the analogous bonds with mercury.|$|E
5|$|Despite <b>being</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> weak storm, forecasters were wary about Katrina, as Central America {{was devastated}} by Hurricane Mitch exactly one year earlier. There was {{considerable}} fear of additional flash flooding and mudslides across the mountainous region. Immediately after being declared a tropical depression, {{a tropical storm}} warning was issued for Nicaragua, and it was extended to the San Andrés islands of Colombia shortly afterward. Officials in Honduras evacuated 71 families from the district of Colón and another 17 families from other at-risk areas. Along the coastline of Honduras, a red alert was declared as torrential rains were anticipated to produce deadly mudslides in areas still recovering from Mitch nearly one year ago.|$|E

60|$|Alexander, however, was <b>very</b> {{far from}} <b>being</b> <b>an</b> infidel, <b>very</b> far from not <b>being</b> <b>a</b> Christian, <b>very</b> far from not believing in God, {{as he has}} left {{abundant}} evidence in the Bulls he issued during his pontificate. It is certainly wrong to assume--and this is pointed out by l'Espinois--that a private life which seems to ignore the commandments of the Church must preclude {{the possibility of a}} public life devoted to the service of the Church. This is far from being the case. Such a state of things--such a dual personality--is by no means inconsistent with churchmen of the fifteenth, or, for that matter, of the twentieth century.|$|R
5|$|The predilection {{of insects}} for this {{mushroom}} was noted by 19th-century British mycologist Anna Maria Hussey, {{who wrote in}} 1847: {{there are very few}} of the soft-fleshed tribes, all of which are the nurseries of innumerable insects, so much in favour as the poisonous Boletus luridus, on breaking an old one it is a living mass of larvae. Our present subject is so soon attacked by insects that it is very rare to find specimens devoid of wriggling life, and <b>being</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> common and abundant kind, it must be of great service in the economy of insect existence. Several fly species have been recorded feeding on the fruit bodies, including Phaonia boleticola, P.rufipalpis, Thricops diaphanus, and, in North America, Drosophila falleni, Pegomya mallochi, P.winthemi, Megaselia pygmaeoides, and Muscina assimilis. In contrast, slugs tend to avoid consuming this species.|$|E
