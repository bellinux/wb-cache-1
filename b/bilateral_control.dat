But the strategies do not give full play to its advantages that the neutral-point current can only flow through the connected midlines in both sides of the converter but does not flow through the DC-bus capacitors. In this paper, firstly the NP potential model based on the NP current injected is proposed.

40|$|In recent years, {{although}} there are many researches on <b>bilateral</b> <b>control,</b> there is only little research on improvement of operationality. It will be so effective for operators to improve the operationality of the <b>bilateral</b> <b>control</b> system.

Objective of this research is to eliminate the chattering and to reduce the impact on human operator at contact motion and to introduce controlling force to the slave manipulator to provide more comfort at the human operator's end. In this paper, a new method of improving the operationality which is based on a virtual torsional spring between master and slave system is discussed.

Enabling a human operator the ability to reach and manipulate a remote location will be possible with the various applications of <b>bilateral</b> <b>control.</b> In that sense, ideal <b>bilateral</b> <b>control</b> allows extension of a person's sensing to a remote environment by a master slave structure. So, the coupled goals of <b>bilateral</b> <b>control</b> is to enforce the slave system track the motion generated on the master system and to reflect the forces from the slave system. This thesis investigates {{the current state of the}} art in bilateral teleoperation. For that purpose, design and analysis of <b>bilateral</b> <b>control</b> is made based on the use of disturbance observers. First, a known control structure is investigated in the context of acceleration control. Following this, a case study is made to show a different application of <b>bilateral</b> <b>control,</b> namely grasping force control. Performance improvement in <b>bilateral</b> <b>control</b> is also studied and correspondingly, a novel functional observer is proposed for better estimation of velocity, acceleration and disturbance. In the second half of the thesis, <b>bilateral</b> <b>control</b> with time delay is realized. Design is made via separating the position and force into two different loops. For position control under time delay, a previously proposed control scheme is used in which use of communication disturbance observer with convergence terms was discussed. Observation made about the divergence from the master reference under contact motion is analyzed and a model following control structure is proposed to eliminate the remaining disturbance from the slave plant. For force control under time delay, first the response of a local controller is analyzed. In order to improve the system transparency, a new method is proposed in which environment stiffness was used for force control loop rather than the delayed slave force. In this structure, estimation of environment stiffness was made via an indirect adaptive control scheme. The analyzed structures were also tested experimentally under a master slave system consisting of 1 DOF linear motors. Experiments show the validity of the contributions made for <b>bilateral</b> <b>control</b> with and without time delay...|$|E

40|$|Bilateral tele- {{operation}} {{is one of}} a major part in robotics as well as in motion control. Most of the researchers have done experiments on bilateral tele-operation but still they haven’t given much attention on vibration suppression of bilateral tele-operation even though it’s important on latest technology. This research is mainly focuses on vibration suppression of <b>bilateral</b> <b>control</b> system. Initially a frequency response analysis is done to the <b>bilateral</b> <b>control</b> system to identify the natural frequency of the system. PD controller parameters, motor inertia, force coefficient and disturbance observer filter coefficient values are varied to identified the parameter effect of the system. By varying the parameter values cutoff frequency can be shifted to the left side. Those analyses depicts that the conventional <b>bilateral</b> <b>control</b> system has the capability to suppress vibrations up to some certain extent. Further suppression can be done by moving the cutoff frequency point to the left side while reducing the frequency bandwidth. This can be done by adding filters to the system. <b>Bilateral</b> <b>control</b> system mainly focuses on force and position responses of master and slave. So that slave environment vibrations can be reflected to the master side in both forms of position and force. System was tested with adding a position filter, force filter and finally the both filters. Vibrations of the system cannot be suppressed by using a position filter. Because its’ differing master and slave force response magnitudes. Above analysis was done by using the available hardware unit. According to the simulation and practical results of modified system with force filters gives good results and the cutoff frequency point is slightly shifted to the left side. But by adding filters to the system main equations of the convention <b>bilateral</b> <b>control</b> system are violated. New concept of virtual impedance controller is introduced to the system as another vibration suppression method. Rigid link in between master and slave is replaced by an impedance controller. This system also behaves as a <b>bilateral</b> <b>control</b> system but the force and position are controlled independently one after another. Through a frequency response analysis natural frequency of the new system is identified. Internal and external vibrations can be suppressed by changing the parameters of the virtual impedance controller along with PD controller parameters. Compared to the frequency responses of the conventional <b>bilateral</b> <b>control</b> system the modified system with virtual impedance controller frequency responses has a lower cutoff frequency value. Then the parameter effect is analyzed for the system with virtual impedance controller. By varying the PD parameters, spring coefficient and damping coefficient values, system cutoff frequency point can be adjusted. So that the unwanted vibrations of a <b>bilateral</b> <b>control</b> system can be suppressed by using the above method. The above analysis was verified with simulation results and practical results...|$|E

40|$|<b>Bilateral</b> <b>control</b> is {{bi-directional}} {{control of}} force-position between two systems {{connected by a}} communication link. It is typically used for teleoperation with forcefeedback, such that the master system is handled by an operator. Motions of the operator are fed forward to the slave system, generally remote to the operator and forces encountered are fed back to the master system, enabling a telepresence of the operator in the remote environment. The necessity of <b>bilateral</b> <b>control</b> lies in its applicability to the tasks that cannot be handled by autonomous manipulators and/or reached by human beings. Main issues of consideration for <b>bilateral</b> <b>control,</b> namely transparency, scaling and time delay, are addressed and two discrete-time sliding-mode approaches are presented as solutions to highly transparent bilateral controllers that support scaling. First approach has a force-hybrid architecture, where the cascaded sliding mode hybrid force/position controller on the slave side reacts to the external forces directly. Therefore, it provides a protection (reflex) mechanism on the slave side to large external forces, that the operator cannot respond in time due to the time delay. Second approach has a decentralized nature.

40|$|Functionality and {{performance}} of modern machines are directly affected by the implementation of real-time control systems. Especially in networked teleoperation applications, force feedback control and networked control {{are two of the}} most important factors and determine the performance of the whole system. In force feedback control, generally it is necessary but difficult and expensive to attach sensors (force/torque/pressure sensors) to detect the environment information in order to drive properly the feedback force.
