5|$|As per his contract, Webber {{started the}} year in Melbourne with Red Bull Racing. He {{recorded}} top-six lap times {{in each of the}} three practice sessions, and was on his way to the top ten in the qualifying session when the front right <b>brake</b> <b>disc</b> in his car failed going into turn 6 during Q2, sending him spinning off into the sand trap ending his qualifying session, and resulting in 15th position on the grid. Although starting well, he momentarily went off the track at turn 1 to avoid being involved in contact that had already erupted. Webber made several positions by turn 3 but an incident involving himself, Kazuki Nakajima and Anthony Davidson when he was slightly contacted by Davidson whilst trying to avoid the struggle between the other two drivers, ended his race.|$|E
25|$|Either type could {{potentially}} fixed by ensuring a clean mounting surface {{on either side}} of the <b>brake</b> <b>disc</b> between the wheel hub and <b>brake</b> <b>disc</b> hub before usage and paying attention to imprinting after extended usage by leaving the brake pedal heavily depressed at the end of heavy usage. Sometimes a bed in procedure can clean and minimize DTV and lay a new even transfer layer between the pad and <b>brake</b> <b>disc.</b> However it will not eliminate hot spots or excessive run out.|$|E
25|$|While {{all types}} of brakes will {{eventually}} wear out the braking surface, a <b>brake</b> <b>disc</b> is easier and cheaper to replace than a wheel rim or drum.|$|E

40|$|A thermoelastic {{simulation}} of functionally graded (FG) <b>brake</b> <b>discs</b> {{is performed using}} finite element (FE) ANSYS. The material properties of two types of FG <b>brake</b> <b>discs</b> are assumed to vary in both radial and thickness directions according to a power law distribution. The <b>brake</b> <b>discs</b> are in contact with one hollow pure pad disc. Dry contact friction is considered as the heat source. The proper thicknesses of pad discs are found to have full-contact status. The behaviour of the thermoelastic results for thickness and radial FG <b>brake</b> <b>discs</b> are compared. The {{results show that the}} behaviour of temperature and vertical displacement in these two types of FG <b>brake</b> <b>discs</b> are the same. However, the variations of radial displacement for different grading indices are not the same. The behaviour of other results are quite similar. Thus, it can be concluded that the variation direction of material properties in FG <b>brake</b> <b>discs</b> can affect the results...|$|R
25|$|Cracking {{is limited}} mostly to drilled discs, which may develop small cracks around edges of holes drilled {{near the edge}} of the disc due to the disc's uneven rate of {{expansion}} in severe duty environments. Manufacturers that use drilled discs as OEM typically do so for two reasons: appearance, if they determine that the average owner of the vehicle model will prefer the look while not overly stressing the hardware; or as a function of reducing the unsprung weight of the brake assembly, with the engineering assumption that enough <b>brake</b> <b>disc</b> mass remains to absorb racing temperatures and stresses. A <b>brake</b> <b>disc</b> is a heat sink, but the loss of heat sink mass may be balanced by increased surface area to radiate away heat. Small hairline cracks may appear in any cross drilled metal disc as a normal wear mechanism, but in the severe case the disc will fail catastrophically. No repair is possible for the cracks, and if cracking becomes severe, the disc must be replaced.|$|E
25|$|When {{braking force}} is applied, {{the act of}} {{abrasive}} friction between the brake pad and the disc wears both the disc and pad away. The brake dust that is seen deposited on wheels, calipers and other braking system components consists mostly of disc material. Brake dust can damage the finish of most wheels if not washed off. Generally, a brake pad that aggressively abrades more disc material away, such as metallic pads, will create more brake dust. Some higher performing pads for track use or towing use may wear away much quicker than a typical pad causing additional dust from heightened <b>brake</b> <b>disc</b> wear and brake pad wear.|$|E
25|$|In 1978, {{inspired}} by a dominating 1–2 finish for Falcon hardtops at the 1977 Hardie Ferodo 1000, Ford introduced the limited-edition Cobra, which used the last 400 hardtop coupé bodyshells. Based on the Falcon GS Hardtop model, each Cobra was individually numbered and featured highlights such as Globe 15-in alloy road wheels copied from Ferrari intended to aid <b>brake</b> <b>disc</b> cooling, ER70 H15 radial-ply tyres, comprehensive instrumentation, bonnet scoops, driving lights, dual exhaust, four-wheel disc brakes, and a distinctive white and blue colour scheme. The 5.8-l engines were installed in cars numbered 002 to 199 and No 351, and the 4.9-litre engines were installed in the rest (001, plus 200 to 400 except for no. 351).|$|E

25|$|Discs {{are usually}} damaged {{in one of}} four ways: scarring, cracking, warping or {{excessive}} rusting. Service shops will sometimes respond to any disc problem by changing out the discs entirely, This is done mainly where {{the cost of a}} new disc may actually be lower than the cost of labour to resurface the old disc. Mechanically this is unnecessary unless the discs have reached manufacturer's minimum recommended thickness, which would make it unsafe to use them, or vane rusting is severe (ventilated discs only). Most leading vehicle manufacturers recommend <b>brake</b> <b>disc</b> skimming (US: turning) as a solution for lateral run-out, vibration issues and brake noises. The machining process is performed in a brake lathe, which removes a very thin layer off the disc surface to clean off minor damage and restore uniform thickness. Machining the disc as necessary will maximise the mileage out of the current discs on the vehicle.|$|E
25|$|Hamilton was {{the fastest}} {{driver in the}} third (and final) {{practice}} session, which was held in chilly but bright weather conditions, {{with a time of}} one minute and 37.107; Rosberg struggled with a brake issue until the session's closing minutes and went faster in the first and second sectors but an untidy final sector caused by an glazed left rear <b>brake</b> <b>disc</b> only allowed him to improve his best time by one thousand of a second and the result meant he was second-fastest. Massa was third-fastest; his teammate Bottas was fourth, Alonso fifth and Ricciardo sixth. Hülkenberg was seventh-quickest, Adrian Sutil eighth, Räikkönen ninth and Button completed the top ten ahead of qualifying. Upon switching settings on his car's steering wheel, Hamilton spun under braking at turn 12, and Rosberg ran wide at the eleventh and twelfth corners. Vergne's session was prematurely ended when his engine cut out.|$|E
25|$|For the 1997 season, Frentzen {{replaced}} Damon Hill at the Williams-Renault {{team that}} had won the drivers' championship three times since 1992. At the first race of the season, the Australian Grand Prix, Frentzen went into the lead at the first corner and remained there until his first pit stop. He was running third late in the race when a <b>brake</b> <b>disc</b> exploded, throwing him off the circuit and into retirement. He came back strongly in round four to take his first win at San Marino but the season was disappointing; after the family-atmosphere at Sauber, Frentzen found life at Williams difficult, in particular having a troubled relationship with Patrick Head. Despite qualifying for many races on the front row he {{had a tendency to}} drift back in the race, usually finishing well behind teammate Jacques Villeneuve. However, because of Michael Schumacher's disqualification from the driver's championship Frentzen ended up second in the championship with 42 points to teammate Villeneuve's 81 having scored just a single win to Villeneuve's seven.|$|E

2500|$|Run-out is {{measured}} using {{a dial indicator}} on a fixed rigid base, with the tip perpendicular to the brake disc's face. It is typically measured about [...] from the outside diameter of the disc. The disc is spun. The difference between minimum and maximum value on the dial is called lateral run-out. Typical hub/disc assembly run-out specifications for passenger vehicles are around [...] Runout can be caused either by deformation of the disc itself or by runout in the underlying wheel hub face or by contamination between the disc surface and the underlying hub mounting surface. Determining {{the root cause of}} the indicator displacement (lateral runout) requires disassembly of the disc from the hub. Disc face runout due to hub face runout or contamination will typically have a period of 1 minimum and 1 maximum per revolution of the <b>brake</b> <b>disc.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Towards {{the back}} of the Thursday time sheet, Schiattarella and Verstappen shared the former's chassis to set the 20th and 19th-fastest times respectively, as Verstappen's gearbox was still refusing to run smoothly. Schiattarella spun at La Rascasse and {{attempted}} to execute a spin-turn at the blind entry to the corner, almost collecting Roberto Moreno's Forti in the process; he was given a $20,000 fine, suspended for three races, for [...] "creating a very dangerous situation". Verstappen then took over the car and crashed it, restricting the Simtek team to a total of ninelaps between its two drivers. Behind Boullion, Andrea Montermini (Pacific) set the 22nd-quickest time, ahead of Moreno, who had to share his car with Diniz after the latter's gearbox failed, restricting him to 25thplace, over fourseconds slower than his teammate. Occupying the lastspot on the provisional grid, Bertrand Gachot failed to set a time due to a sheared <b>brake</b> <b>disc</b> on his Pacific, which caused his left-rear wheel to fall off on his first out-lap, forcing him to abandon his car out on the circuit.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the second}} {{practice}} session, {{which took place}} in mild weather conditions and was later affected by rain on portions of the track, Mark Webber in the No. 1 Porsche set the fastest lap time of the day at one minute and 40.997 seconds twenty minutes into practice. He finished 0.014 seconds faster than the second-placed Fässler, who in turn, was 0.125 seconds quicker than his team-mate Loïc Duval in third. Dumas' car suffered a front-left <b>brake</b> <b>disc</b> failure, causing him to drive into the turn one barriers and damaged the front-end of his car, rendering him unable to take any further part in practice and triggering a full course yellow. Stéphane Richelmi's No. 36 Signatech Alpine led LMP2 early on in the session but Rast ended it as the fastest driver in the class with a time of one minute and 48.965 seconds, more than a second faster than Brundle's Strakka car. LMGTE Pro was led by Stanaway in the No. 97 Aston Martin while Rui Águas in the No. 83 AF Corse Ferrari was the fastest in LMGTE Am. Lamy and David Cheng were summoned by the stewards to race control after the two made contact.|$|E

50|$|Compared to drum <b>brakes,</b> <b>disc</b> <b>brakes</b> offer better {{stopping}} performance {{because the}} disc is more readily cooled. As a consequence discs are {{less prone to}} the brake fade caused when <b>brake</b> components overheat. <b>Disc</b> <b>brakes</b> also recover more quickly from immersion (wet brakes are less effective than dry ones).|$|R
5000|$|The use of {{very wide}} tyres favors <b>disc</b> <b>brakes,</b> as rim brakes require ever-longer arms {{to clear the}} wider tyre. Longer arms tend to flex more, {{degrading}} <b>braking.</b> <b>Disc</b> <b>brakes</b> are unaffected by tyre width.|$|R
2500|$|This type of {{thickness}} variation has many causes, {{but there are}} three primary mechanisms which contribute the most to the propagation of disc {{thickness variation}}s connected to uneven pad transfer. The first is improper selection of brake pads for a given application. Pads which are effective at low temperatures, such as when braking {{for the first time}} in cold weather, often are made of materials which decompose unevenly at higher temperatures. This uneven decomposition results in uneven deposition of material onto the <b>brake</b> <b>disc.</b> Another cause of uneven material transfer is improper break in of a pad/disc combination. For proper break in, the disc surface should be refreshed (either by machining the contact surface or by replacing the disc as a whole) every time the pads are changed on a vehicle. Once this is done, the brakes are heavily applied multiple times in succession. This creates a smooth, even interface between the pad and the disc. When this is not done properly the brake pads will see an uneven distribution of stress and heat, resulting in an uneven, seemingly random, deposition of pad material. The third primary mechanism of uneven pad material transfer is known as [...] "pad imprinting." [...] This occurs when the brake pads are heated to the point that the material begins to break-down and transfer to the disc. In a properly broken in brake system (with properly selected pads), this transfer is natural and actually is a major contributor to the braking force generated by the brake pads. However, if the vehicle comes to a stop and the driver continues to apply the brakes, the pads will deposit a layer of material in the shape of the brake pad. This small thickness variation can begin the cycle of uneven pad transfer.|$|E
2500|$|Once {{the disc}} has {{some level of}} {{variation}} in thickness, uneven pad deposition can accelerate, sometimes resulting in changes to the crystal structure of the metal that composes the disc in extreme situations. As the brakes are applied, the pads slide over the varying disc surface. As the pads pass by the thicker section of the disc, they are forced outwards. The foot of the driver applied to the brake pedal naturally resists this change, and thus more {{force is applied to}} the pads. The result is that the thicker sections see higher levels of stress. This causes an uneven heating of the surface of the disc, which causes two major issues. As the <b>brake</b> <b>disc</b> heats unevenly it also expands unevenly. The thicker sections of the disc expand more than the thinner sections due to seeing more heat, and thus the difference in thickness is magnified. Also, the uneven distribution of heat results in further uneven transfer of pad material. The result is that the thicker-hotter sections receive even more pad material than the thinner-cooler sections, contributing to a further increase in the variation in the disc's thickness. In extreme situations, this uneven heating can actually cause the crystal structure of the disc material to change. When the hotter sections of the discs reach extremely high temperatures ( [...] ), the metal can undergo a phase transformation and the carbon which is dissolved in the steel can precipitate out to form carbon-heavy carbide regions known as cementite. This iron carbide {{is very different from the}} cast iron the rest of the disc is composed of. It is extremely hard, very brittle, and does not absorb heat well. After cementite is formed, the integrity of the disc is compromised. Even if the disc surface is machined, the cementite within the disc will not wear or absorb heat at the same rate as the cast iron surrounding it, causing the uneven thickness and uneven heating characteristics of the disc to return.|$|E

40|$|<b>Disc</b> <b>brakes</b> are {{invariably}} used {{in all the}} automobiles {{either to}} reduce the rotational speed of the wheel or to hold the vehicle stationary.
