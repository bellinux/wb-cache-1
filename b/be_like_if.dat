In the middle of the night, Brian breaks into Dexter's apartment and attempts to stab Debra, only to find a prosthetic body in her place; Dexter then chokes him unconscious with a garrote. In the refrigeration unit in Brian's apartment, Dexter ties him to the killing table with plastic wrap. After an emotionally charged conversation, Dexter slices his brother's throat and leaves him upside down to drain, staging it as a suicide. Dexter and Debra arrive at a crime scene, and he imagines what it would <b>be</b> <b>like</b> <b>if</b> everyone knew and happily accepted the truth about him.|$|E

25|$|In 1895 Wells was an {{established}} writer and he married his second wife, Catherine Robbins, moving {{with her to}} the town of Woking in Surrey. Here he spent his mornings walking or cycling in the surrounding countryside, and his afternoons writing. The original idea for The War of the Worlds came from his brother during one of these walks, pondering on what it might <b>be</b> <b>like</b> <b>if</b> alien beings were suddenly to descend on the scene and start attacking its inhabitants.|$|E
25|$|In essence, Kant’s {{remarks in}} the preface prepare the reader for {{the thrust of the}} ideas he goes on to develop in the Groundwork. The purpose of the Groundwork is to prepare a {{foundation}} for moral theory. Because Kant believes that any fact which is grounded in empirical knowledge must be contingent, he can only derive the necessity that the moral law requires from a priori reasoning. It is with this significance of necessity in mind that the Groundwork attempts to establish a pure (a priori) ethics. Such an ethics explains the possibility of a moral law and locates what Kant calls the “supreme principle of morality.” The aim of the following sections of the Groundwork is to explain what the moral law would have to <b>be</b> <b>like</b> <b>if</b> it existed and to show that, in fact, it exists and is authoritative for us.|$|E

500|$|... "Long John Peter" [...] {{contained}} several {{pop culture}} references. When Chris sees Anna {{for the first}} time, he starts singing the song [...] "Crazy for You", which was originally performed by Madonna in the film Vision Quest (1985). When Peter is fighting a British man, the title music from The Sea Hawk (1940), composed by Erich Wolfgang Korngold, is used. The episode imagines what it would <b>be</b> <b>like</b> <b>if</b> Michael J. Fox, who has [...] Parkinson's disease, would star as Zorro.

500|$|Rosenbaum {{believed}} that Lex {{was trying to}} be a hero in season one, but that his character showed signs of having to fight [...] "ambiguity" [...] and stay on the straight path. The tension-filled relationship with his father, which is first established in the pilot episode, comes to a crossing in the season one finale, when Lex is left with the decision to either help his father remove the structural beam that has fallen on him, or let him die. Rosenbaum wanted the audience to see that Lex was really contemplating what his life would <b>be</b> <b>like</b> <b>if</b> Lionel was no longer around. As Rosenbaum explained the scene: ...|$|E
500|$|Unlike in a {{traditional}} film soundtrack, Moore often wrote music [...] "not necessarily to always match the images on the screen, but to sometimes play against it." [...] Moore explained that {{a traditional}} soundtrack needs to convey {{the mood of the}} scene and advance the film's storyline, but {{that he did not have}} to do that with Graveyard Mountain Home [...] "because the director's not around". [...] "I thought, well what would it <b>be</b> <b>like</b> <b>if</b> I did a totally different kind of mood than this scene is trying to convey? When you put that music with that scene what happens there? Sometimes it's kind of interesting what happens," [...] Moore explained.|$|E

500|$|The {{concept for}} Forever {{came from a}} {{conversation}} between series creator Matt Miller and his five-year-old son about death. After the conversation, Miller began to imagine what life would <b>be</b> <b>like</b> <b>if</b> a person was immortal but everyone else, including that person's own children, were mortals. [...] He created a character who viewed immortality as a curse because of the pain of seeing family and friends die and who would attempt {{to find a way}} to end his immortality. [...] That concept informed Miller's decision to make his character a doctor-turned-medical examiner who used his occupation for research into his immortality and Miller's decision to structure the series as a procedural. [...] The details about the character's immortality and his ability and his desire to end it would serve as the series' main story arc.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Rolling Stone, Swift revealed that [...] "Mine" [...] was inspired by an unnamed crush in mind, saying [...] "I was reflecting back on a boy I liked at a certain time." [...] She also told MTV that the song is {{about what it would}} <b>be</b> <b>like</b> <b>if</b> she actually let her guard down. During a live Ustream chat with fans on July 20, 2010, Swift explained that the song is about [...] "her tendency to run from love" [...] after seeing many relationships end in goodbye and breakups. She continued, [...] "I think I've developed this pattern of sort of running away {{when it comes time to}} fall in love and to stay in a relationship. The song is sort of about finding the exception to that and finding someone who would make you believe in love and realize that it could work out." ...|$|E

The song's keyboards, whistle, guitars, bass, percussion and drum programming were provided by Eman, with additional keyboards and drum programming by Koerkmeier and Andrew Goldstein. On July 29, 2011, the audio of [...] "It Girl" [...] was uploaded to Derulo's official YouTube account. When speaking of the song, Derulo told The Daily Telegraph, [...] "I wanted to put myself in a position as if I'd found my It Girl, to make myself feel like if I found that one true love. I've basically described what it would <b>be</b> <b>like</b> <b>if</b> I found her."

500|$|Stevens {{is known}} for {{projecting}} a professional, [...] "corporate" [...] look from the sidelines.

Friends and family and faith, they're {{going to take the}} cake over all this stuff." [...] Stevens met his wife, Tracy (née Wilhelmy), while attending DePauw University. Tracy, who played soccer for DePauw, quickly learned of Brad's love for basketball; on their third date he drove her {{an hour and a half}} to attend a high school basketball game. Tracy graduated from Rocky River High School in 1995, and from DePauw in 1999. She returned to school in 2000, driving five hours from Case Western's law school to Indianapolis on weekends to see Brad.

500|$|Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club {{awarded the}} episode a [...] "B+" [...] {{and called it}} [...] "a solid example of the show’s mid-period form". However, {{he noted that the}} episode {{is not one of the}} series bests, unlike the way many fans portray it—due largely to the fact that [...] "it allows us to see what it would <b>be</b> <b>like</b> <b>if</b> Mulder and Scully were a happily married couple"—and that [...] "the episode’s monster is a little hard to figure out". Other reviews were more mixed. Tom Kessenich, in his book Examination: An Unauthorized Look at Seasons 6–9 of the X-Files gave the episode a more mixed review, writing [...] "after {{watching}} 'Arcadia', I feel like I just had a couple slices of pizza for dinner on Thanksgiving. Not bad, but hardly the feast I have come to expect." [...] Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a mixed review and awarded it two stars out of four. Vitaris, despite praising David Duchovny's performance during the scenes wherein he [...] "rebels against the rules", called the episode's main villains [...] "stereotypes of self-indulgent, insulated suburbanites." ...|$|E
500|$|Two {{young female}} millworkers in 1873 Maine visit the town's {{carousel}} after work. One of them, Julie Jordan, attracts {{the attention of}} the barker, Billy Bigelow ("The Carousel Waltz"). [...] When Julie lets Billy {{put his arm around her}} during the ride, Mrs. Mullin, the widowed owner of the carousel, tells Julie never to return. Julie and her friend, Carrie Pipperidge, argue with Mrs. Mullin. [...] Billy arrives and, seeing that Mrs. Mullin is jealous, mocks her; he is fired from his job. Billy, unconcerned, invites Julie to join him for a drink. As he goes to get his belongings, Carrie presses Julie about her feelings toward him, but Julie is evasive ("You're a Queer One, Julie Jordan"). Carrie has a beau too, fisherman Enoch Snow ("(When I Marry) Mister Snow"), to whom she is newly engaged. [...] Billy returns for Julie as the departing Carrie warns that staying out late means the loss of Julie's job. Mr. Bascombe, owner of the mill, happens by along with a policeman, and offers to escort Julie to her home, but she refuses and is fired. Left alone, she and Billy talk about what life might <b>be</b> <b>like</b> <b>if</b> they were in love, but neither quite confesses to the growing attraction they feel for each other ("If I Loved You").|$|E
5000|$|... "I {{originally}} intended that Janis {{would play a}} cameo in the novel but she wouldn't go away," [...] author James McKenzie told Q News (Australian magazine).

500|$|After arriving, Artie offers Marge a $1 million {{proposal}} {{to spend a}} weekend with him, {{just to see what}} life would <b>be</b> <b>like</b> <b>if</b> they were married. Marge initially rejects the offer, but eventually can no longer stand Homer's snoring. She chooses to spend the weekend so she can get the money for the surgery. They have a good time until Artie tricks Marge into making out with him against her will in a re-enactement of their prom during the 1970s made to mirror the one they attended in [...] "The Way We Was" [...] (with even its original attendants who were paid by Artie to show up disguised as they were at that time). Homer, having just anxiously arrived to check up on them, sees Artie kissing an unwilling Marge and, unaware of the true premises, is devastated, and leaves with Lenny away from Springfield. Lenny seems similarly dejected about his relationship with Carl; he and Homer get a job in an oil field in West Springfield, a likely death spot for the two of them. On the way there, they discuss the loves they left behind. All cacti resemble Marge to Homer, and Lenny mournfully points out the image of Carl that he carved on a mountain one blissful summer. Meanwhile, Marge leaves Artie furiously, only to discover what Homer had done when she gets home. She finds he is not there and that he had left a tape behind.|$|E
500|$|The {{scene was}} also a pivotal point in the {{development}} of Elsa's character and was initially planned to depict her becoming evil. Robert Lopez, who composed the song with his wife, Kristen Anderson-Lopez, explained, [...] "Elsa was going to go from being this perfect princess that had tried to keep her personality down her whole life to saying, 'Screw it. I'm gonna be me.'" [...] They had wanted to use the song as a way {{to gain a better understanding}} of the character and what she would <b>be</b> <b>like</b> <b>if</b> she was no longer living in fear, which ultimately resulted in her becoming much more complex. The final lyrics and Menzel's [...] "ability to be so fragile and vulnerable and then break into this powerhouse voice" [...] turned the plot around and led to Elsa being revised as a [...] "good" [...] character. She initially attempts to suppress her powers in order to avoid hurting others, particularly Anna, and when she is no longer able to do so, she banishes herself from the kingdom to protect those around her. Lead writer Paul Briggs said that Anna's support is what Elsa needs most when her secret is exposed. [...] "The strength of the family bond is what makes this story so powerful," [...] he explained, [...] "because it's her sibling who's willing to look beyond her powers and stand between her and the world if that's what it takes." ...|$|E
500|$|This episode {{featured}} {{a lot of}} character development {{that many of the}} actors had been waiting for. Lana's jealousy over Clark and Chloe going to the prom begins to come out; although Kristin Kreuk believes that Lana {{does not want to be}} jealous, and wants to be able to support Clark with his newfound feelings for Chloe. According to Eric Johnson, Whitney finally gets to show a side of himself that Johnson wishes the audience would have been able to see sooner, as Whitney gives Lana a private dance before the prom knowing that she will not be able to go because he is leaving town. To add further depth to his character not previously seen, Millar and Gough decided to send Whitney off to war, instead of killing the character outright. The idea of sending Whitney off to war was something that came to Millar and Gough midway through the season. They knew they did not want to kill him, because they wanted the ability to bring him back at some point in the future, so they came up with this [...] "noble, heroic, send-off" [...] for the character. For Lex, this episode featured the moment when he finally began to contemplate what his life would <b>be</b> <b>like</b> <b>if</b> his father was no longer a part of it. As Rosenbaum sees it, the moment that Lex hesitates to free his father from the support beam that collapses on him is the moment that the audience gets to see a hint of the evil man they know Lex will one day become. This is a brief moment where Lex forgets who he is, and if he had let his father die he would have certainly made his [...] "turn to the dark side".|$|E
