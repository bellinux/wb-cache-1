5|$|On July 25, 1994, Scott Peterson {{died in a}} {{motorcycle}} accident. On March 23, 2009, Steve Doll died when a <b>blood</b> <b>clot</b> from his lungs entered his heart. On January 9, 2017, Rex King died from kidney failure.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} symptom of HIT is {{enlargement}} or extension of a previously diagnosed <b>blood</b> <b>clot,</b> or {{the development of}} a new <b>blood</b> <b>clot</b> elsewhere in the body. This may take the form of clots either in arteries or veins, causing arterial or venous thrombosis, respectively. Examples of arterial thrombosis are stroke, myocardial infarction ("heart attack"), and acute leg ischemia. Venous thrombosis may occur in the leg or arm in the form of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and in the lung in the form of a pulmonary embolism (PE); the latter usually originate in the leg but migrate to the lung.|$|E
5|$|Libby {{died at the}} UCLA Medical Center in Los Angeles on September 8, 1980, from a <b>blood</b> <b>clot</b> in his lung {{complicated}} by pneumonia. His papers are in the Charles E. Young Research Library at the UCLA. Seven volumes of his papers were edited by Leona and Rainer Berger and published in 1981.|$|E

40|$|Hippocrates and Aristotle {{recognized}} that <b>blood</b> <b>clots</b> outside the body {{but it was}} not until 1720 that John Louis Petit {{recognized that}} control of hemorrhage following amputation was associated with the <b>blood</b> <b>clotting</b> process. 1 138 years later Rudolph Virchow formulated his postulates regarding clots in venous thrombosis. 2 The association of <b>blood</b> <b>clots</b> with acut...|$|R
5|$|Treatment is with {{anticoagulants}} (medication that suppresses blood clotting), {{and rarely}} thrombolysis (enzymatic {{destruction of the}} <b>blood</b> <b>clot).</b> Given that there is usually an underlying cause for the disease, tests may be performed to look for these. The disease may be complicated by raised intracranial pressure, which may warrant surgical intervention such as the placement of a shunt.|$|E
5|$|Any <b>blood</b> <b>clot</b> forms {{due to an}} {{imbalance}} between coagulation (the formation of the insoluble blood protein fibrin) and fibrinolysis. The three major mechanisms for such {{an imbalance}} are enumerated in Virchow's triad: alterations in normal blood flow, injury to the blood vessel wall, and alterations in the constitution of blood (hypercoagulability). Most cases of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis are due to hypercoagulability.|$|E
5|$|Cerebral venous sinus {{thrombosis}} (CVST) is {{the presence}} of acute thrombosis (a <b>blood</b> <b>clot)</b> in the dural venous sinuses, which drain blood from the brain. Symptoms may include headache, abnormal vision, any of the symptoms of stroke such as weakness of the face and limbs {{on one side of the}} body, and seizures. The diagnosis is usually by computed tomography (CT/CAT scan) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) employing radiocontrast to demonstrate obstruction of the venous sinuses by thrombus.|$|E
5000|$|In July 2014, NBCA {{launched}} its newly designed [...] "Stop the Clot" [...] website with resources for health professionals, patients {{and family members}} including healthcare provider listings, patient stories, a knowledge base of articles and reference materials on <b>blood</b> <b>clots</b> and <b>blood</b> <b>clotting</b> disorders. NBCA also sponsors educational seminars and publishes materials {{to raise awareness of}} <b>blood</b> <b>clotting</b> issues.|$|R

50|$|CVCs are a {{risk factor}} for forming <b>blood</b> <b>clots</b> (venous thrombosis) {{including}} upper extremity deep vein thrombosis. It is thought this risk stems from activation of clotting substances in the blood by trauma to the vein during placement. The risk of <b>blood</b> <b>clots</b> is higher in a person with cancer, as cancer is also {{a risk factor}} for <b>blood</b> <b>clots.</b> Anti-clotting drugs such as heparin and fondaparinux have been shown to decrease the incidence of <b>blood</b> <b>clots,</b> specifically deep vein thrombosis, in a person with cancer with central lines. Additionally, studies suggest that short term use of CVCs in the subclavian vein is less likely to be associated with <b>blood</b> <b>clots</b> than CVCs placed in the femoral vein in non-cancer patients.|$|R
5|$|During his {{recuperation}} Formby contracted gastroenteritis and had {{a suspected}} <b>blood</b> <b>clot</b> on his lung, after which he underwent an operation to clear a fishbone that was stuck in his throat. He had recovered sufficiently by April 1953 to undertake a 17-show tour of Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), before a special appearance at the Southport Garrick Theatre. That September {{he turned on the}} Blackpool Illuminations.|$|E
5|$|In the episode, Megan (Dana Delany) {{investigates the}} murder of Ted Harbison (Kevin Kaine), who dies shortly after surgery and has {{to face up to}} her past, by going back to her former hospital; and Ethan (Geoffrey Arend) and Curtis (Windell Middlebrooks) autopsy Jessica Archer (Christina Hendricks), a woman who died from a <b>blood</b> <b>clot,</b> and meet her twin sister Karen (Hendricks), for whom Ethan begins to develop feelings.|$|E
5|$|Warfarin {{is used to}} {{decrease}} the tendency for thrombosis or as secondary prophylaxis (prevention of further episodes) in those individuals who have already formed a <b>blood</b> <b>clot</b> (thrombus). Warfarin treatment can help prevent formation of future blood clots and help {{reduce the risk of}} embolism (migration of a thrombus to a spot where it blocks blood supply to a vital organ).|$|E
25|$|Patient {{education}} and compliance {{reduces the risk}} of developing <b>blood</b> <b>clots.</b> These excerises and use of equipment and follow up by clinicians {{reduces the risk of}} developing <b>blood</b> <b>clots.</b>|$|R
50|$|Mutations in this {{condition}} change amino acids, which in turn disrupts <b>blood</b> <b>clotting.</b> Functional protein S is lacking, which normally turns off clotting proteins, this increases risk of <b>blood</b> <b>clots.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Sometimes {{the fluid}} {{contains}} thick pus or <b>blood</b> <b>clots,</b> {{or it may}} have formed a hard skin or peel. This {{makes it harder to}} drain the fluid. To help break up the pus or <b>blood</b> <b>clots,</b> the doctor may use the chest tube to put certain medicines into the pleural space. These medicines are called fibrinolytics. If the pus or <b>blood</b> <b>clots</b> still do not drain out, surgery may be necessary.|$|R
5|$|A {{pulmonary}} embolism is a <b>blood</b> <b>clot</b> that becomes {{lodged in the}} pulmonary arteries. The majority of emboli arise because of deep vein thrombosis in the legs. Pulmonary emboli may be investigated using a ventilation/perfusion scan, a CT scan of the arteries of the lung, or blood tests such as the D-dimer. Pulmonary hypertension describes an increased pressure {{at the beginning of}} the pulmonary artery that has a large number of differing causes. Other rarer conditions may also affect the blood supply of the lung, such as granulomatosis with polyangiitis, which causes inflammation of the small blood vessels of the lungs and kidneys.|$|E
5|$|Deep vein {{thrombosis}}, or deep {{venous thrombosis}} (DVT), is {{the formation of a}} <b>blood</b> <b>clot</b> (thrombus) within a deep vein, most commonly the legs. Nonspecific signs may include pain, swelling, redness, warmness, and engorged superficial veins. Pulmonary embolism, a potentially life-threatening complication, is caused by the detachment (embolization) of a clot that travels to the lungs. Together, DVT and pulmonary embolism constitute a single disease process known as venous thromboembolism. Post-thrombotic syndrome, another complication, significantly contributes to the health-care cost of DVT.|$|E
5|$|In December 2012 Clinton {{was hospitalized}} {{for a few}} days for {{treatment}} of a <b>blood</b> <b>clot</b> in her right transverse venous sinus. Her doctors had discovered the clot during a follow-up examination for a concussion she had sustained when she fainted and fell nearly three weeks earlier, as a result of severe dehydration from a viral intestinal ailment acquired during a trip to Europe. The clot, which caused no immediate neurological injury, was treated with anticoagulant medication and her doctors have said she has made a full recovery.|$|E
40|$|C-refctive protein prolongs blood {{coagulation}} time in phospholipids-dependent coagulation tests. O. P. Bliznukov, L. D. Kostin, A. J. Martinov, T. A. Lisitsina, T. M. Reshetnyak, V. J. Lauga Objective. To study {{influence of}} different CRP forms on <b>blood</b> <b>clotting</b> time in standard phospholipid clotting tests. Material and methods. Purified native CRP. monomeric CRP (0 - 1. 6 M), immune complexes of native CRP and rabbit polyclonal anti-CRP antibodies (1. 6 M) {{were added to}} blood plasma of healthy donors. <b>Blood</b> <b>clotting</b> time was registered using optical coagulometer.

Results. Native CRP was able to increase <b>blood</b> <b>clotting</b> time in all mentioned clotting tests, excluding prothrombin time. CRP influence on <b>blood</b> <b>clotting</b> time showed a concentration dependence. Polyclonal rabbit anti-CRP antibodies had no inhibitory effect on CRP prolonged <b>blood</b> <b>clotting</b> time.

25|$|Thrombosis prevention, {{also known}} as {{thrombosis}} prophylaxis, are treatments to prevent the formation of <b>blood</b> <b>clots</b> inside a <b>blood</b> vessel. Some people are at a higher risk {{for the formation of}} <b>blood</b> <b>clots</b> than others. Prevention measures or interventions are usually begun after surgery as people are at higher risk due to immobility. There are medication-based interventions and non-medication-based interventions. The risk of developing <b>blood</b> <b>clots</b> can be modified by life style modifications, the discontinuation of oral contraceptives, and weight loss. In those at high risk both interventions are often used. The treatments to prevent the formation of <b>blood</b> <b>clots</b> is balanced against the risk of bleeding.|$|R
50|$|The haemostatic (<b>blood</b> <b>clotting)</b> system {{involves}} {{the interaction of}} proteins in the blood, the blood vessel wall and {{the flow of blood}} to control bleeding and <b>blood</b> <b>clotting.</b> Developmental Haemostasis is a term that represents the maturation of the haemostatic system from birth to adulthood. There are differences in the concentration, structure and activity of many proteins involved in <b>blood</b> <b>clotting.</b> These changes {{play an important role in}} physiological development and are important in providing appropriate diagnosis and treatment of bleeding and clotting disorders (e.g. thrombosis). The age-specific differences in the <b>blood</b> <b>clotting</b> system may contribute to the fact that children are less prone to developing thrombosis compared to adults.|$|R
5|$|On July 14, 2017, McCain {{underwent}} a minimally invasive craniotomy at Mayo Clinic Hospital in Phoenix, Arizona, {{in order to}} remove a <b>blood</b> <b>clot</b> above his left eye. His absence prompted Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to delay {{a vote on the}} Better Care Reconciliation Act. Five days later, Mayo Clinic doctors announced that the laboratory results from the surgery confirmed the presence of a glioblastoma, which is a very aggressive brain tumor. Standard treatment options for this tumor include chemotherapy and radiation, although even with treatment, average survival time is approximately 14 months. McCain is a survivor of previous cancers, including melanoma.|$|E

In the WWF, Well Dunn faced the promotion's top tag teams and were contenders for the WWF Tag Team Championship. They had a feud with The Bushwhackers that lasted for most of Well Dunn's tenure with the company. The team split up in 1996 but reunited briefly in 1998. During this reunion, Doll attacked King and the team disbanded permanently. Doll died from complications related to a <b>blood</b> <b>clot</b> in 2009, and Well died in 2017 from kidney failure.|$|E
5|$|This event {{marked the}} {{introduction}} of the Lethal Lockdown and Xscape matches, which became annually held matches at future Lockdown events. During the event, Chris Candido received an injury during his tag team match with Lance Hoyt against Apolo and Sonny Siaki, which later led to Candido's death from a <b>blood</b> <b>clot</b> as a result of surgery for the injury. Jason Clevett of the professional wrestling section of the Canadian Online Explorer rated the event a 6 out of 10, two marks lower than the 2006 event's ranking by Chris Sokol.|$|E

5000|$|In 1997, Russell Doolittle, {{on whose}} work Behe based {{much of the}} blood-clotting {{discussion}} in Darwin's Black Box, wrote a rebuttal to the statements about irreducible complexity of certain systems. In particular, Doolittle mentioned {{the issue of the}} <b>blood</b> <b>clotting</b> in his article, [...] "A Delicate Balance." [...] Later on, in 2003, Doolittle's lab published a paper in the peer-reviewed journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences which demonstrates that the pufferfish lacks at least three out of 26 <b>blood</b> <b>clotting</b> factors, yet still has a workable <b>blood</b> <b>clotting</b> system. According to Doolittle, this defeats a key claim in Behe's book, that <b>blood</b> <b>clotting</b> is irreducibly complex.|$|R
40|$|<b>Blood</b> <b>clots</b> stop {{bleeding}} and provide cell-instructive microenvironments. Still, in vitro models {{used to study}} implant performance typically neglect any possible interactions of recruited cells with surface-adhering <b>blood</b> <b>clots.</b> Here we study the interaction and synergies of bone marrow derived human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) with surface-induced <b>blood</b> <b>clots</b> in an in vitro model by fluorescence microscopy, scanning and correlative light and electron microscopy, ELISA assays and zymography. The clinically used alkali-treated rough titanium (Ti) surfaces investigated here are known to enhance <b>blood</b> <b>clotting</b> compared to native Ti and to improve the healing response, but the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Here we show {{that the presence of}} <b>blood</b> <b>clots</b> synergistically increased hMSC proliferation, extracellular matrix (ECM) remodelling and the release of matrix fragments and angiogenic VEGF, but did not increase the osteogenic differentiation of hMSCs. While many biomaterials are nowadays engineered to release pro-angiogenic factors, we show here that clot-entrapped blood cells on conventional materials in synergy with hMSCs are potent producers of pro-angiogenic factors. Our data might thus not only explain why alkali-treatment is beneficial for Ti implant integration, but they suggest that the physiological importance of <b>blood</b> <b>clots</b> to create pro-angiogenic environments on implants has been greatly underestimated. The importance of <b>blood</b> <b>clots</b> might have been missed because the pro-angiogenic functions get activated only upon stimulation by synergistic interactions with the invading cells...|$|R
5|$|Venous thrombosis, the {{formation}} of a <b>blood</b> <b>clot</b> in a vein, is a common cause of death in breast cancer patients; patients with recurrent disease are typically maintained on anticoagulants for their lifetimes. A research study has suggested that extracts from P.impudicus can reduce the risk of this condition by reducing the incidence of platelet aggregation, and may have potential as a supportive preventative nutrition. It was used in medieval times as a cure for gout and as a love potion.|$|E
5|$|Vertebral artery {{dissection}} (VAD) is a flap-like tear of {{the inner}} lining of the vertebral artery, which {{is located in the}} neck and supplies blood to the brain. After the tear, blood enters the arterial wall and forms a <b>blood</b> <b>clot,</b> thickening the artery wall and often impeding blood flow. The symptoms of vertebral artery dissection include head and neck pain and intermittent or permanent stroke symptoms such as difficulty speaking, impaired coordination and visual loss. It is usually diagnosed with a contrast-enhanced CT or MRI scan.|$|E
5|$|Alveolar osteitis is a {{complication}} of tooth extraction (especially lower wisdom teeth) {{in which the}} <b>blood</b> <b>clot</b> is not formed or is lost, leaving the socket where the tooth used to be empty, and bare bone is exposed to the mouth. The pain is moderate to severe, and dull, aching, and throbbing in character. The pain is localized to the socket, and may radiate. It normally starts two to {{four days after the}} extraction, and may last 10–40 days. Healing is delayed, and it is treated with local anesthetic dressings, which are typically required for five to seven days. There is some evidence that chlorhexidine mouthwash used prior to extractions prevents alveolar osteitis.|$|E
40|$|<b>Blood</b> <b>clots</b> and {{retracted}} (1) <b>blood</b> <b>clots</b> {{have been}} found to differ in their susceptibility to drug mediated fibrinolysis (2).

40|$|Acute airway {{obstruction}} after hemoptysis occurs due to {{the presence}} of <b>blood</b> <b>clots.</b> These conditions may result in life-threatening ventilation impairment. We report a case of obstruction of the large airway by endobronchial <b>blood</b> <b>clots</b> which were removed using bronchoscopic cryotherapy at the bedside of intensive care unit. A 66 -year-old female with endometrial cancer who had undergone chemotherapy, was admitted to the intensive care unit due to neutropenic fever. During mechanical ventilation, the minute ventilation dropped to inadequately low levels and chest radiography showed complete opacification of the left hemithorax. Flexible bronchoscopy revealed large <b>blood</b> <b>clots</b> obstructing the proximal left main bronchus. After unsuccessful attempts to remove the clots with bronchial lavage and forceps extraction, <b>blood</b> <b>clots</b> were removed using bronchoscopic cryotherapy. This report shows that cryotherapy via flexible bronchoscopy at the bedside in the intensive of intensive care unit is a simple and effective alternative for the removal of endobronchial <b>blood</b> <b>clots...</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>Blood</b> <b>clotting</b> is {{a precise}} cascade {{engineered}} {{to form a}} clot with temporal and spatial control. Current control of <b>blood</b> <b>clotting</b> is achieved predominantly by anticoagulants and thus inherently one-sided. Here we use a pair of nanorods (NRs) to provide a two-way switch for the <b>blood</b> <b>clotting</b> cascade by utilizing their ability to selectively release species on their surface under two different laser excitations. We selectively trigger release of a thrombin binding aptamer from one nanorod, inhibiting <b>blood</b> <b>clotting</b> and resulting in increased clotting time. We then release the complementary DNA as an antidote from the other NR, reversing {{the effect of the}} aptamer and restoring <b>blood</b> <b>clotting.</b> Thus, the nanorod pair acts as an on/off switch. One challenge for nanobiotechnology is the bio-nano interface, where coronas of weakly adsorbed proteins can obscure biomolecular function. We exploit these adsorbed proteins to increase aptamer and antidote loading on the nanorods. National Science Foundation (U. S.) (Grant DMR # 0906838...|$|R
