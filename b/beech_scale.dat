50|$|Cryptococcus fagisuga, {{commonly}} known as the <b>beech</b> <b>scale</b> or woolly <b>beech</b> <b>scale,</b> is a felted scale insect in the superfamily Coccoidea that infests beech trees of the genus Fagus. It is associated with the transmission of beech bark disease because the puncture holes it makes in the bark allow entry of pathogenic fungi which have been identified as Nectria coccinea var. faginata and sometimes Nectria galligena.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>beech</b> <b>scale</b> insect, Cryptococcus fagisuga, is {{invasive}} to North America and is host-specific, feeding {{exclusively on}} beech trees. [...] It {{can be observed}} on the trunk and limbs of the tree as woolly, white tufts that will later develop into broad strips. The woolly, white tufts and broad strips are the colonies of the <b>beech</b> <b>scale</b> insect that are formed in tiny crevices along the bark. An adult <b>beech</b> <b>scale</b> insect has a soft body, is yellow in color, ranges from 0.5 to 1.0 millimeter long, and has an elliptical shape. [...] The <b>beech</b> <b>scale</b> insect also has a stylet that it uses to penetrate the bark of the tree for feeding purposes. There are no male <b>beech</b> <b>scale</b> insects and the female insects reproduce parthenogenetically. [...] In mid to late summer, the <b>beech</b> <b>scale</b> insect lays its eggs and dies. The eggs are pale yellow and are laid on the bark in strings of four to eight eggs. [...] The first-stage nymphs begin to hatch in late summer and eggs will continue until early winter. [...] They have short antennae and legs, and move around until they find a suitable and safe place {{to settle down and}} force their stylet into the bark to begin feeding. At this point, they begin to secrete the woolly wax cover that they use for protection. This is the second stage of their life cycle and when the spring season arrives they molt again and become adult females. A second type of scale insect, Xylococcus betulae, which is non-host-specific, is native to North America and causes beech bark disease to a lesser degree than Cryptococcus fagisuga.|$|E

However, Beechcraft's deteriorating financial situation in the 1990s doomed the concept, and only the first Triumph prototype was built. He joined lead engineer Jon Karkow on the Virgin Atlantic GlobalFlyer program, doing the wing aerodynamic design and predicting performance. Steve Fossett flew solo {{around the world in}} 2005 with this aircraft. Roncz designed a two seat aircraft for production in Australia. It is a three-surface aircraft called the Eagle XTS with outstanding handling qualities, which was produced in Australia and also in Malaysia. Later he modified the airplane to use a Continental IO-240 engine, and took charge of certifying that airplane, the Eagle 150B, in the USA. He also worked on the Explorer, a large cargo airplane built in Australia, which is faster than the Cessna Caravan. The Genesis glider was his first flying wing design. Several of his UAV designs are being produced in Israel, and are in use by US military forces. He worked with Jon Karkow at Icon Aircraft to develop the spin-resistant wing on the A5.

40|$|Three reasons {{have urged}} the Walloon Forest Administration (Walloon Public Service) on to solicit {{the help of}} forest {{researchers}} to bring practical responses to the adaptation of its current forests management: (i) the progression of research in applied autecology, (ii) the development of software for the management and the analysis of georeferenced data (GIS technologies) and, (iii) the awareness of the potential negative impacts of climate change on forests. To answer to this request, this research aims to model the autecology of the main forest tree species at the Walloon Region <b>scale</b> (<b>Beech,</b> Oak, Norway Spruce, Douglas-fir and valuable broadleaves species). The results {{will be used to}} update current practical tools to assess the adequacy of forest tree species on sites, especially in the climate change context. The research is built into three main steps: • update the autecology knowledge for the targeted forest tree species through a state of the art; • compile and create different ecological parameters that can explain the major part of trees growth such as climatic, topographic, geologic, edaphic and phytosociological data gathered from forest plots or geodatabases. In the context of climate change, a particular attention will be brought on bioclimatic and soil moisture conditions because of their narrow link with the potential risk of trees ecophysiological stress; • model tree species reaction to environmental conditions with tree growth indicators. Three types of indicators with different spatio-temporal scales are foreseen: stand site index (30 - 50 years), periodic diameter growth (5 - 10 years) and tree-ring growth (1 - 3 years). The use of these three scales is justified by the interest presented by their cross-validations which are necessary for an accurate extrapolation of results to the entire region. Results should indicate the tree species behaviour, especially towards stress conditions. The integration of climatic data, provided by global climate models based on IPCC's climate scenarios, in autecological models could be used to assess the behaviour of forest stands in future climate conditions. From those results, we expect to identify and assess accurately the risky “sites-species pairs” to avoid {{in the context of a}} sustainable silviculture. Finally, results will be used to provide autecological synthesis and practical tools to help forest managers and foresters to identify the best “site-species pairs” (tree-site adequacy maps, sites catalogue and computer platform) ...|$|R
50|$|There {{are a few}} {{controls}} for beech bark disease. One important management strategy is prohibiting the movement of nursery stock or other materials that may harbor the <b>beech</b> <b>scale</b> insect. Insecticides, generally not applied under forest conditions, are primarily used on high-value ornamental trees. The use of other organisms as controls is also a possibility. The ladybird beetle is a beetle that preys on the <b>beech</b> <b>scale</b> insect. A fungus that parasitizes the Neonectria fungus could also be employed. The problem with using these organisms to control beech bark disease is that {{their impact on the}} disease has not been evaluated extensively. In a forest setting, controlling the beech bark disease is too costly. Timely salvage cutting {{is the best way to}} reduce the losses of beech in a forest.|$|E
50|$|Beech bark {{disease has}} become a major killer of beech trees in the Northeastern United States. This disease occurs when the <b>beech</b> <b>scale</b> insect, Cryptococcus fagisuga, attacks the bark, {{creating}} a wound that is then infected by one of two different species of fungi in the genus Nectria. This causes a canker to develop and the tree is eventually killed.|$|E
50|$|Beech bark {{disease has}} been {{recorded}} as affecting common beech trees, Fagus sylvatica, in Europe since before 1849. Until 1914 {{it was thought that}} the <b>beech</b> <b>scale</b> insect itself was responsible for the disease. Subsequently it was discovered that a fungus, then identified as Nectria ditissima, was in fact killing the trees infested by the scale. Around 1890 the scale insect was accidentally introduced into Nova Scotia. By 1932, the scale and its associated Nectria fungus had spread to many areas of the Maritime Provinces and parts of eastern and south central Maine. It continues to spread in North America and is now found in Quebec, Ontario, New England, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and West Virginia. Attempts are being made to discover the geographic origin of <b>beech</b> <b>scale</b> {{in order to try to}} identify any natural enemies that might hold promise for its biological control. From these studies and associated ribosomal DNA analysis, it seems likely that the pest originated in the region of northeast Greece, northern Iran, the Caucasus and the Black Sea drainage basin on the host beech subspecies F. sylvatica orientalis.|$|E
50|$|The <b>beech</b> <b>scale</b> is monophagous, {{being found}} only on beech trees, and sucks sap from the parenchyme tissue of the bark. The small wounds {{produced}} when it feeds allow the Nectria fungi to invade infested trees. The insect colonises beech trees that are aged {{at least thirty}} years. Studies have shown that younger trees produce defensive chemicals which deter infestation. A ladybird beetle Chilocorus stigma feeds on this scale and is common {{throughout most of the}} Eastern United States, but this predator does not reduce scale populations sufficiently to control infestations. Persistent severely cold weather may kill <b>beech</b> <b>scale</b> and air temperatures of -37°C {{have been shown to be}} lethal to insects not protected by snow. Although trees are weakened when supporting scale colonies, this does not usually cause mortality, which only occurs after the trees have been invaded by the Nectria fungi. It usually takes three to six years of infestation by the scale insect before the fungus reaches critical levels. Where beech bark disease becomes established, most of the larger trees will die. Some trees seem to be partially resistant to the disease and a small number seem to be completely resistant. This may be partly due to the fact that trees with smooth bark provide fewer cracks and crevices in which the scale insect can flourish.|$|E
50|$|Along {{with the}} closely related common wasp and {{two species of}} Polistes, the German wasp is {{considered}} to be a pest in New Zealand. It was probably introduced in the late 19th century, but did not appear in large numbers until around 1940. Wasp numbers reach their greatest densities in beech forest of the South Island, due to the abundance of honeydew produced by the <b>beech</b> <b>scale</b> insect in this type of forest. It has a serious effect on the forest ecology, since less honeydew remains available for the native birds. German wasps were, however, quickly succeeded in much of the South Island and its beech forests by the introduction of the common wasp in the 1970s.|$|E
50|$|There are two fungi {{common to}} North America that are {{important}} to the beech bark disease process. They are Neonectria faginata and Neonectria ditissima. The primary fungus is N. faginata, though N. ditissima is very important in some areas. These fungi infect the tree through the wounds caused by the <b>beech</b> <b>scale</b> insect and then begin to produce spores. Spores are contained in perithecia, which are red, lemon-shaped fruiting bodies that form in clusters on the bark. These perithecia mature in the fall, and once they have become sufficiently moist, they each release eight spores that are carried by the wind to other beech trees. Even though the perithecia occur on dead bark, they still have the ability to produce viable spores the next year.|$|E
50|$|Various {{insects and}} arachnids reside around the Petitcodiac River. Among them is the stonefly, the mayfly, the caddisfly, the simulium, the {{subfamily}} of tanypodinae, and the Hydracarina. Non-native species, such as the black-footed spider, the <b>beech</b> <b>scale,</b> the white-marked tussock moth, and the mountain ash sawfly have also made their home in the Petitcodiac River watershed. At the southern extremities of the watershed, 50 to 90 percent of the world's semipalmated sandpipers feed on the mud shrimp at Shepody Bay. Around 269,445 stop there before migrating to South America, a number which accounts for at least 7.7 {{percent of the total}} population. Among others, the semipalmated plover (around 2 percent of the North American population), the short-billed dowitcher, the red knot, the sanderling, and the least sandpiper are also known for migrating through the Important Bird Area.|$|E
50|$|There are no male <b>beech</b> <b>scale</b> {{insects and}} the females {{reproduce}} by parthenogenesis. From midsummer onwards, they deposit {{four to eight}} pale yellow eggs, attached {{to each other in}} strings end to end, on the bark of the trees where they have been feeding. The wingless larvae that hatch out about twenty days later are known as crawlers or nymphs. They have well-developed legs and short antennae. Some remain concealed under the female, which dies after the eggs are laid, and others disperse to cracks and crevices on the tree. A few get washed down or fall to the ground and most of these perish. Occasionally one may find its way to another beech tree, perhaps wafted there by the wind or on the foot of a bird, and founds a new colony. Having found a location on a suitable tree, the crawler forces its tubular stylet into the bark and starts to feed. At this stage, it moults and becomes a second-stage, legless nymph, and will remain sedentary for the rest of its life. It secretes wax from glands and is soon covered in a protective coating of wool-like material. After overwintering it completes a second moult in the spring to become a mature female.|$|E
40|$|Pathogens and parasites play {{important}} roles in ecological communities and their influence is meaningful when they represent a newly arrived invader. At geographic scales, invading tree pests have caused major disruptions of terrestrial ecosystems. The bark disease of American beech (Fagus grandifolia Ehrl.) {{is an example of}} a disease invasion that has had a major impact on forest composition throughout northeastern North America in the past 50 years. The combined infestation of the European <b>beech</b> <b>scale</b> insect Cryptococcus fagisuga Lind., and the subsequent invasion of fungi (Nectria spp.) have substantially altered the structure of American beech populations. Because the scale insect must precede the fungus, it is the key component of disease spread. Despite this, there is little ecological research in North America on the <b>beech</b> <b>scale</b> insect. I examined the population and local dispersal dynamics of the <b>beech</b> <b>scale</b> insect on American beech populations in continuous forest inventory plots within the Edmund Niles Huyck Preserve in eastern New York State.

Artificial inoculations have demonstrated N. coccinea ability to produce restricted beech bark decay. Necrosis’s perennity and spread seem to be conditionned by C. fagisuga population’s density. Results of 1976 - 1977 experimental studies, lay down necessary association of two organisms implicated : Each day, from October 1976 to June 1977, germinating ascospores have been sprayed on beech bark infested with <b>beech</b> <b>scale</b> (population density 3 - 4 E. J. Parker, scoring system). Two kinds of symptoms, red bark discoloration and slime flux, reveal successful N. coccinea infection, and corresponding necrosis (reisolation, november 1977).

Restricted {{to one or two}} centimeters square, in lack of <b>beech</b> <b>scale,</b> necrosis rapidly extend to several decimeters square, where C. fagisuga are abounding. C. fagisuga brings a bark physiological disorder, rendering bark more vulnerable to N. coccinea destructive ability. Mechanical (vaccum cleaner, brush) or chemical (oleoparathion) elimination of <b>beech</b> <b>scale</b> on N. coccinea infected (or no) bark, confirms previous observations. Infections never occur, in lack of <b>beech</b> <b>scale,</b> or after insecticide treatment.

40|$|The beech bark disease complex {{has long}} been an {{extremely}} important exotic pest issue as it has spread throughout eastern North America since its introduction in 1890. This insect-fungal disease complex is continuing its expansion and reaching new areas such as the state of Michigan. As it does so, it has serious implications for the health of both individual trees and beech–containing ecosystems as whole. Numerous tree characteristics affect abundance of <b>beech</b> <b>scale</b> on individual trees, including tree age, diameter, area and texture of bark, bark chemical composition, other bark-dwelling organisms, tree genetics, side of tree bole examined, and crown health variables. <b>Beech</b> <b>scale</b> colonization is generally greater in favorable microsites. These microsites include such characteristics as large areas of rough bark, higher levels of bark nitrogen, favorable associations with bark-dwelling organisms, more shade, and low temperature fluctuations. The development of beech bark disease through its three stages of progression once <b>beech</b> <b>scale</b> is on trees in an area is affected by a number of factors such as tree age, size, vigor, and stress levels from other factors. Spread of beech bark disease through ecosystems is likely most strongly controlled by the spatial patterns of beech stands and beech trees within stands, although other agents such as wind and animals can play important roles as well. Research to date in Michigan supports the importance of contiguous forest stands in increasing the rate of beech bark disease spread. Beech bark disease has a wide array of effects on tree health, including notably greater levels of damage, poorer tree crown conditions, and reduced radial wood growth. Negative effects can occur even when the amount of <b>beech</b> <b>scale</b> present on the tree is relatively small. Further research directions are suggested...|$|E

40|$|It is {{currently}} proposed {{that there are}} two species of honeydew-producing sooty <b>beech</b> <b>scale</b> insects (Ultracoelostoma spp.) in New Zealand.

BBD has caused mortality of American beech (Fagus grandifolia Ehrh.) in some of Michigan’s northern hardwood forests, and it is a threat to those forests not yet infested. The {{purpose of this study was}} to 1) determine the continuing impacts of beech bark disease on the state’s beech resource, and 2) monitor changes to forest composition and health in disease infested stands. Plots that were first sampled in 2001 were visited again in 2007, and comparisons made on the progress of the disease. Stands visited were divided between the Upper Peninsula and Lower Peninsula. Evidence of disease was noted in 9 plots where it was previously undocumented, showing a pattern of rapid westward movement of the disease. Overall, stands infested with beech bark disease exhibited reduced health (exhibited by poorer levels of foliage transparency, higher levels of crown dieback, and higher severities of damage) and high mortality of beech trees, with a 16 % increase in dead basal area in infected areas. The disease is more advances in the Lower Peninsula, likely due to a more recent establishment of the disease there. However, most of the new cases were in the Upper Peninsula.

40|$|Biotic {{threats to}} trees often arise from {{interactions}} among {{two or more}} species, frequency insects and fungi, that function together to defeat host defenses, secure resources and colonize new hosts. Feedbacks among plant enemies can have large positive feedbacks that can destabilize populations and permit outbreaks. Feedbacks can be rapid and direct (e. g. within trees or among years) or can arise from slowly developing changes in host resource quantity or quality at the scale of forest stands or landscapes. Climate may also influence system dynamics by altering feedbacks within or among species or through density independent effects. We evaluated major drivers of population dynamics of beech bark disease (BBD), an important forest disease in eastern deciduous forests of North America, using data from 28 study sites in the eastern United States monitored for up to 14 yr between 1979 and 1992. Both primary causal agents of BBD – the introduced felted <b>beech</b> <b>scale.</b> Cryptococcus fagisuga and native fungi Neonectria spp. – Showed strong simple density dependence in all study populations. Surprisingly, densities of scale insects and fungi {{had little or no}} effects on population growth rates of the other, despite their habit of living in close physical relationships. For both insects and fungi, ecologically important features of the density dependent functions (slope, carrying capacity and density independent variance) were variable across sites. Climatic effects on density-dependent functions (and scatter around them) were evident but generally weak and variable. The most striking predictor of patterns in density dependence was duration since establishment of BBD in the region. Apparently BBD alters forests over decades in ways that strengthen self-regulation among causal agents without eliminating or even dramatically reducing host populations.

40|$|Abstract Background Beech bark {{disease is}} an insect-fungus complex that damages and often kills American beech trees and has major {{ecological}} and economic impacts on {{forests of the}} northeastern United States and southeastern Canadian forests. The disease begins when exotic <b>beech</b> <b>scale</b> insects feed on the bark of trees, and is followed by infection of damaged bark tissues {{by one of the}} Neonectria species of fungi. Proteomic analysis was conducted of beech bark proteins from diseased trees and healthy trees in areas heavily infested with beech bark disease. All of the diseased trees had signs of Neonectria infection such as cankers or fruiting bodies. In previous tests reported elsewhere, all of the diseased trees were demonstrated to be susceptible to the scale insect and all of the healthy trees were demonstrated to be resistant to the scale insect. Sixteen trees were sampled from eight geographically isolated stands, the sample consisting of 10 healthy (scale-resistant) and 6 diseased/infested (scale-susceptible) trees. Results Proteins were extracted from each tree and analysed in triplicate by isoelectric focusing followed by denaturing gel electrophoresis. Gels were stained and protein spots identified and intensity quantified, then a statistical model was fit to identify significant differences between trees. A subset of BBD differential proteins were analysed by mass spectrometry and matched to known protein sequences for identification. Identified proteins had homology to stress, insect, and pathogen related proteins in other plant systems. Protein spots significantly different in diseased and healthy trees having no stand or disease-by-stand interaction effects were identified. Conclusions Further study of these proteins should help to understand processes critical to resistance to beech bark disease and to develop biomarkers for use in tree breeding programs and for the selection of resistant trees prior to or in early stages of BBD development in stands. Early identification of resistant trees (prior to the full disease development in an area) will allow forest management through the removal of susceptible trees and their root-sprouts prior to the onset of disease, allowing management and mitigation of costs, economic impact, and impacts on ecological systems and services. </p...|$|E
