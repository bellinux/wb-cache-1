500|$|The Economist {{wrote in}} June 2012: [...] "Outside Germany, a {{consensus}} has developed on what Mrs. Merkel {{must do to}} preserve the single currency. It includes shifting from austerity to a far greater focus on economic growth; complementing the single currency with a <b>banking</b> <b>union</b> (with euro-wide deposit insurance, bank oversight and joint means for the recapitalisation or resolution of failing banks); and embracing a limited form of debt mutualisation to create a joint safe asset and allow peripheral economies the room gradually to reduce their debt burdens. This is the refrain from Washington, Beijing, London, and indeed most of the capitals of the euro zone. Why hasn't the continent's canniest politician sprung into action?" ...|$|E
2500|$|In October 2014, the Deputy Prime Minister Janusz Piechociński {{suggested}} that Poland should join the Eurozone in 2020 at the earliest. The newly elected Prime Minister, Ewa Kopacz, having replaced Donald Tusk {{for the final}} year of the government's term, at the same time commented: [...] "Before answering the question which target date should be set for the euro changeover, we must ask another: What is the situation of the eurozone and where are they going? If the eurozone will strengthen, then Poland should fulfill all the criteria for inclusion, which would in any case be good for the economy." [...] The PM hereby referred to the earlier political decision of first letting the National Coordination Committee for Euro Changeover complete its update of the changeover plan, which await a prior establishment of the <b>banking</b> <b>union,</b> before setting a target date for euro adoption.|$|E
2500|$|As of April 2015, the Romanian {{government}} concluded it {{was still}} on track to attain its target for euro adoption in 2019, both in regards of ensuring full compliance with all nominal convergence criteria and in regards of ensuring a prior satisfying degree of [...] "real convergence". The Romanian target for [...] "real convergence" [...] ahead of euro adoption, is for its GDP per capita (in purchasing power standards) to be above 60% of the same average figure for the entire European Union, {{and according to the}} latest outlook, this relative figure was now forecast to reach 65% in 2018 and 71% in 2020, after having risen at the same pace from 29% in 2002 to 54% in 2014. Finally, the Romanian government also expressed its commitment fully to join all pillars of the <b>Banking</b> <b>Union,</b> as soon as possible. According to a eurobarometer poll in April 2015, 68 percent are in favor of introducing the euro (a decrease of 6 percent from 2014), whereas 26 percent are opposed (an increase of 2 percent from 2014).|$|E

2500|$|On 28 September 2000, a euro {{referendum}} {{was held}} in Denmark resulting in a 53.2% vote against the government's proposal to abrogate the euro opt-out. [...] Since 2007, the Danish government has discussed holding another referendum on euro adoption. [...] However, the uncertainty, {{both in terms of}} the stability of the euro and the establishment of new political structures at the EU level, resulting first from eruption of the Financial Crisis and then subsequently from the related European government-debt crisis, led the government to postpone the referendum to a date after the end of its legislative term. When a new government came to power in September 2011, they outlined in their government manifest, that a euro referendum would not be held during its four-year term, due to a continued prevalence of this uncertainty. As part of the European elections in 2014, it was argued collectively by the group of pro-European Danish parties (Venstre, Konservative, Social Democrats and Radikale Venstre), that an upcoming euro referendum would not be in sight until the [...] "development dust had settled" [...] from creation of multiple European debt crisis response initiatives (including the establishment of <b>Banking</b> <b>Union,</b> and the Commission's - still in pipeline - proposal package for creating a strengthened genuine EMU). When a new Venstre-led government came to power in June 2015, their government manifest did not include plans for holding a euro referendum within their four-year legislative term. Opinion polls, which had generally favoured euro adoption from 2002 to 2010, showed a rapid decline in support {{during the height of the}} EU debt crisis, reaching a low in May 2012 with 26% in favor towards 67% against while 7% were in doubt.|$|E

50|$|The <b>banking</b> <b>union</b> in the European Union is the {{transfer}} of responsibility for banking policy from the national to the EU level in several countries of the European Union, initiated in 2012 {{as a response to}} the Eurozone crisis. The motivation for <b>banking</b> <b>union</b> was the fragility of numerous banks in the Eurozone, and the identification of vicious circle between credit conditions for these banks and the sovereign credit of their respective home countries. In several countries, private debts arising from a property bubble were transferred to sovereign debt as a result of banking system bailouts and government responses to slowing economies post-bubble. <b>Banking</b> <b>union</b> was formulated as a policy response to this challenge.|$|E
