5|$|Ancient Egyptian {{artisans}} used {{stone to}} carve statues and fine reliefs, but used wood as a cheap and easily carved substitute. Paints {{were obtained from}} minerals such as iron ores (red and yellow ochres), copper ores (<b>blue</b> <b>and</b> <b>green),</b> soot or charcoal (black), and limestone (white). Paints could be mixed with gum arabic as a binder and pressed into cakes, which could be moistened with water when needed.|$|E
5|$|Bioluminescence occurs widely among animals, {{especially}} in the open sea, including fish, jellyfish, comb jellies, crustaceans, and cephalopod molluscs; in some fungi and bacteria; and in various terrestrial invertebrates including insects. About 76% of the main taxa of deep-sea animals produce light. Most marine light-emission is in the <b>blue</b> <b>and</b> <b>green</b> light spectrum. However, some loose-jawed fish emit red and infrared light, and the genus Tomopteris emits yellow light.|$|E

5|$|If {{the green}} parrots Leguat {{referred}} to {{were not the}} Rodrigues parrot (Necropsittacus rodericanus), they might perhaps have been a green colour morph of Newton's parakeet, as Julian Hume has suggested. As A. Newton observed in his original description, some feathers of the female specimen display both <b>blue</b> <b>and</b> <b>green</b> tinges, depending on the light. This may {{explain some of the}} discrepancies. The green parrots mentioned could also instead have been storm-blown members of Psittacula species from other islands, that survived on Rodrigues for a short time.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to bald eagles, which {{live in the}} IBA year round and have successfully established a breeding population there, the IBA is home to belted kingfishers, scarlet tanagers, black-throated blue warblers, common mergansers, <b>blue</b> <b>and</b> <b>green</b> heron, hermit thrushes, and wood ducks. Large numbers of ospreys use the gorge during spring and fall migration periods. The woodlands are inhabited by the ruffed grouse, Pennsylvania's state bird, and wild turkeys. Swainson's thrush breeds in the IBA and the northern harrier breeds and overwinters in Pine Creek Gorge.|$|E
5|$|Incandescent {{lights are}} filled with argon, to {{preserve}} the filaments at high temperature from oxidation. It {{is used for the}} specific way it ionizes and emits light, such as in plasma globes and calorimetry in experimental particle physics. Gas-discharge lamps filled with pure argon provide lilac/violet light; with argon and some mercury, blue light. Argon is also used for <b>blue</b> <b>and</b> <b>green</b> argon-ion lasers.|$|E

5|$|Scales, more specifically, mostly {{consist of}} hard beta keratins which are {{basically}} transparent. The colours {{of the scale}} are due to pigments in the inner layers of the skin and not due to the scale material itself. Scales are hued for all colours in this manner except for <b>blue</b> <b>and</b> <b>green.</b> Blue {{is caused by the}} ultrastructure of the scales. By itself, such a scale surface diffracts light and gives a blue hue, while, in combination with yellow from the inner skin it gives a beautiful iridescent green.|$|E
5|$|Surveys {{also show}} that green is the color most {{associated}} with the calm, the agreeable, and tolerance. Red is associated with heat, blue with cold, and green with an agreeable temperature. Red is associated with dry, blue with wet, and green, in the middle, with dampness. Red is the most active color, blue the most passive; green, in the middle, {{is the color of}} neutrality and calm, sometimes used in architecture and design for these reasons. <b>Blue</b> <b>and</b> <b>green</b> together symbolize harmony and balance.|$|E
5|$|The Aurigids had a {{spectacular}} outburst in 1994, when many grazing meteors—those {{that have a}} shallow angle of entry and seem {{to rise from the}} horizon—were observed in California. The meteors were tinted <b>blue</b> <b>and</b> <b>green,</b> moved slowly, and left trails at least 45° long. Because they had such a shallow angle of entry, some 1994 Aurigids lasted up to 2 seconds. Though {{there were only a few}} visual observers for part of the outburst, the 1994 Aurigids peak, which lasted less than two hours, was later confirmed by Finnish amateur radio astronomer Ilkka Yrjölä. The connection with Comet Kiess was finally confirmed in 1994. The 2007 outburst of the Aurigids was predicted by Peter Jenniskens and was observed by astronomers worldwide. Despite some predictions that there would be no Alpha Aurigid outburst, many bright meteors were observed throughout the shower, which peaked on September 1 as predicted. Much like in the 1994 outburst, the 2007 Aurigids were very bright and often colored <b>blue</b> <b>and</b> <b>green.</b> The maximum zenithal hourly rate was 100 meteors per hour, observed at 4:15am, California time (12:15 UTC) by a team of astronomers flying on NASA planes.|$|E

5|$|The WindSeeker at Knott's Berry Farm {{differed}} from the other five in several ways. Rather than white, <b>blue,</b> <b>and</b> <b>green</b> on the tower, Knott's adopted a color scheme using orange, purple, and yellow to reflect the Spanish California theme of the Fiesta Village section of the park. The tower at Knott's had no lights at the top. The ride's sign had a Mexican theme and did not light up.|$|E
5|$|The {{attack was}} {{to involve the}} New Zealand Division's 2nd and Rifle Brigades, with 4th Brigade in reserve, attacking along Belluvue Spur and onto Goudberg Spur while the 3rd Australian Division, {{on the right of}} the New Zealanders, {{attempted}} to take Passchendaele itself. On the division's left was the 9th (Scottish) Division. The plan required both New Zealand brigades to advance with a one-battalion frontage, with three battalions of each brigade leapfrogging each other in sequence to capture objectives designated Red, <b>Blue</b> <b>and</b> <b>Green</b> lines, the last of which was Goudberg Spur.|$|E
5|$|The eyes of {{slow lorises}} are forward-facing, which gives stereo vision. Their eyes {{are large and}} possess a {{reflective}} layer, called the tapetum lucidum, that improves low-light vision. It is possible that this layer blurs the images they see, as the reflected light may interfere with the incoming light. Slow lorises have monochromatic vision, meaning they see in shades of only one color. They lack the opsin gene {{that would allow them}} to detect short wavelength light, which includes the colors <b>blue</b> <b>and</b> <b>green.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} NBN logo, {{featuring the}} numeral three inside a ring {{was replaced by}} several others over the years. The three was used due to the station's frequency allocation, being transmitted on VHF channel 3 from a transmitter atop Mount Sugarloaf near Newcastle. On 22 November 1979 the logo was updated with the letters NBN replacing the numeral three. The <b>blue</b> <b>and</b> <b>green</b> logo coincided with the renaming of the station from Channel Three to the current name, NBN Television, and its parent company renaming from the Newcastle Broadcasting and Television Corporation to NBN Limited.|$|E
5|$|The panel {{comprises}} four individual {{pieces of}} oak, painted over a chalk ground bound with glue. The preparation wood is dated to around 1410, giving an estimated {{date for the}} Van der Weyden in the mid-1430s. The dominant pigments are lead white (often used in the panel to highlight <b>blue</b> <b>and</b> <b>green</b> passages), charcoal black, ultramarine, lead-tin-yellow, verdigris and red lake. There has been some discolouration– some greens are now brown, including pigments used to depict grass in the background.|$|E
5|$|The sunset moth {{is black}} with {{iridescent}} red, <b>blue</b> <b>and</b> <b>green</b> markings. There is a fringe of white scales {{on the wing}} edges, wider on the hindwings. The moth has six tails, very often lost or damaged during its life. Pattern variations are common, and the moth is often partly asymmetrical; {{one of the factors}} causing this is temperature shock during the pupal stage.|$|E

5|$|Glass beads for {{jewellery}} {{have traditionally}} been made in Hebron. Blue beads and glass beads with 'eyes' (owayneh) were made for use as amulets since they were considered particularly effective against the evil-eye. In the Museum of Mankind collections, there exist several glass necklaces that were made in Hebron during the Mandate period or earlier. Besides necklaces made of <b>blue</b> <b>and</b> <b>green</b> beads, and 'eyes' beads, there are examples of beads of small hands, also called a Hamsa, representing the hand of Fatimah, {{the daughter of the}} prophet Muhammad. Most of a woman's jewellery was given to her at marriage; in the early 1920s, in Bayt Dajan, a glass bracelet (ghwayshat) made in Hebron would be considered a necessary part of the jewellery of a bride's trousseau.|$|E
5|$|In 2005 the Defense Department {{announced}} that it would be shifting 18,000 jobs to Fort Belvoir in Virginia and at least 5,000 jobs to Fort Meade in Maryland by 2012, as part of that year's Base Realignment and Closure plan. In anticipation of such a move, local officials and the military proposed extending the <b>Blue</b> <b>and</b> <b>Green</b> Lines to service each base. The proposed extension of the Green Line could cost $100 million per mile ($60 million per kilometer), and a light rail extension to Fort Belvoir was estimated to cost up to $800 million. Neither proposal has established timelines for planning or construction.|$|E
