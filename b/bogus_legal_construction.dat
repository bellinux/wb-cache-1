40|$|In Part I of this article, Dalton briefly {{reviews the}} way legal {{scholars}} commonly define sex-based discrimination, particularly {{as it pertains}} to issues of reproduction. Part II is a brief historical review of <b>legal</b> <b>constructions</b> of parenthood. In Part III, Dalton examines two legal concepts: retroactive legitimation and presumed fatherhood. Both concepts were introduced in 1872 and each independently encouraged judges to think of fatherhood as consisting of two distinct spheres, the biological and the social. She then traces the legal development of these concepts through a series of presumed father, retroactive legitimation, and putative father cases. In Part IV Dalton extends the analysis to include <b>legal</b> <b>constructions</b> of motherhood by introducing lesbian co-mother and female surrogacy cases into the mix. This allows the author to directly compare <b>legal</b> <b>constructions</b> of motherhood to <b>legal</b> <b>constructions</b> of fatherhood. In Part V Dalton discusses gendered aspects of the legal institution of marriage and the complicated role marriage plays in <b>legal</b> <b>constructions</b> of parenthood. In Part VI she delves into several recent lesbian co-mother and surrogacy cases to explore how some judges are attempting to expand <b>legal</b> <b>constructions</b> of motherhood in ways that would bring them more on par with <b>legal</b> <b>constructions</b> of fatherhood. And finally, in Part VII, Dalton offers final remarks and concludes that judges 2 ̆ 7 inability to conceive of a gender neutral subject, at least when considering issues related to human reproduction, creates serious legal disadvantages for virtually all women. As the analysis below makes clear, the resulting discrimination is grounded in gendered constructions of parenthood and not, as many courts conclude, in the biological differences between men and women...|$|R

40|$|This thesis has {{developed}} a woman-centred analytical framework and accompanying court room strategy to critically evaluate the <b>legal</b> <b>construction</b> of abused women who kill and their reactions to abuse {{in the context of}} the defences to homicide. This builds upon the existence of extensive empirical evidence which explains the defensive nature of female perpetrated intimate partner homicides. Despite such information, the recognition of abused women’s reactions as reasonable within the context of domestic violence is not reflected within the defences to homicide. Instead, abused women must fall within masculine constructions of appropriate reaction, or else be constructed within a psychological framework premised upon the existence of a mental abnormality. In order to challenge the <b>legal</b> <b>construction</b> of abused women who kill, this thesis evaluated the strategic possibilities apparent within the admissibility of expert testimony concerning domestic violence. It used abused women’s narratives and social contexts to demonstrate the reasonable nature of their reaction. The potential of such testimony was explored when the strategy was applied to the current partial and complete defences to homicide. Upon application, it became clear that the defences to homicide are implicitly gender biased, making the admissibility of such testimony insufficient to challenge prevailing and masculine notions of appropriate behaviour. Therefore, this thesis has argued that it is necessary to implement a partial defence of excessive force in self defence. This would recognise the defensive nature of abused women’s reactions to abuse whilst enabling abused women’s narratives and social contexts to be used as a means of challenging the current <b>legal</b> <b>constructions</b> of abused women who kill. It is hoped that these narratives will be used to facilitate further legal reform until abused women’s reactions to abuse can appropriately be incorporated into the complete defence of self defence. ...|$|R
