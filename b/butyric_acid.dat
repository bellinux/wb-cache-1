5|$|Several {{chemical}} compounds with potential biological activities {{are found in}} sundews, including flavonoids (kaempferol, myricetin, quercetin and hyperoside), quinones (plumbagin, hydroplumbagin glucoside and rossoliside (7–methyl–hydrojuglone–4–glucoside)), and other constituents such as carotenoids, plant acids (e.g. <b>butyric</b> <b>acid,</b> citric acid, formic acid, gallic acid, malic acid, propionic acid), resin, tannins and ascorbic acid (vitamin C).|$|E
5|$|Another {{way of life}} of chemotrophs in {{the absence}} of {{possible}} electron acceptors is fermentation, wherein the electrons taken from the reduced substrates are transferred to oxidised intermediates to generate reduced fermentation products (e.g., lactate, ethanol, hydrogen, <b>butyric</b> <b>acid).</b> Fermentation is possible, because the energy content of the substrates is higher than that of the products, which allows the organisms to synthesise ATP and drive their metabolism.|$|E
5|$|Certain {{bacteria}} form close spatial {{associations that}} are essential for their survival. One such mutualistic association, called interspecies hydrogen transfer, occurs between clusters of anaerobic bacteria that consume organic acids, such as <b>butyric</b> <b>acid</b> or propionic acid, and produce hydrogen, and methanogenic Archaea that consume hydrogen. The bacteria in this association are unable to consume the organic acids as this reaction produces hydrogen that accumulates in their surroundings. Only the intimate association with the hydrogen-consuming Archaea keeps the hydrogen concentration low enough to allow the bacteria to grow.|$|E

40|$|Medium-chain-length fatty acids, such as nonanoic (9 : 0) and octanoic (8 : 0) acids, {{are more}} toxic to Ralstonia eutropha than {{volatile}} fatty acids such as acetic, propionic and <b>butyric</b> <b>acids.</b> Nonanoic acid was degraded to acetic and propionic acids via beta -oxidation by Ralstonia eutropha for cell growth and synthesis of polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs). In a mixture of the fatty acids, utilization of nonanoic acid was depressed by acetic and propionic acids, and vice versa. The PHA accumulation from the {{volatile fatty acids}} was decreased from 53 % (w/w) of dry cell mass to 23 % due to the nonanoic acid. Similar phenomena were also observed with octanoic acid and its metabolic intermediates, acetic and <b>butyric</b> <b>acids...</b>|$|R
5|$|The brain consumes up {{to twenty}} percent of the energy used by the human body, more than any other organ. Brain {{metabolism}} normally relies upon blood glucose as an energy source, but during times of low glucose (such as fasting, endurance exercise, or limited carbohydrate intake), the brain uses ketone bodies for fuel with a smaller need for glucose. The brain can also utilize lactate during exercise. Long-chain fatty acids cannot cross the blood–brain barrier, but the liver can break these down to produce ketone bodies. However, short-chain fatty acids (e.g., <b>butyric</b> <b>acid,</b> propionic acid, and acetic acid) and the medium-chain fatty acids, octanoic acid and heptanoic acid, can cross the blood–brain barrier and be metabolized by brain cells. The brain stores glucose in the form of glycogen, albeit in significantly smaller amounts than that found in the liver or skeletal muscle.|$|E

A complete random design was used with four replications. The nutritional composition, pH, ammonical nitrogen and lactic, acetic, propyonic and <b>butyric</b> <b>acids</b> were determined.

25|$|The process {{involves}} a biological/chemical method for converting any biodegradable material (e.g., urban wastes, such as municipal solid waste, biodegradable waste, and sewage sludge, agricultural residues such as corn stover, sugarcane bagasse, cotton gin trash, manure) into useful chemicals, such as carboxylic acids (e.g., acetic, propionic, <b>butyric</b> <b>acid),</b> ketones (e.g., acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, diethyl ketone) and biofuels, {{such as a}} mixture of primary alcohols (e.g., ethanol, propanol, n-butanol) and/or a mixture of secondary alcohols (e.g., isopropanol, 2-butanol, 3-pentanol). Because of the many products that can be economically produced, this process is a true biorefinery.|$|E
25|$|The undigested residue {{from the}} {{fermentation}} {{may be used}} in gasification to make hydrogen (H2). This H2 can then be used to hydrogenolyze the esters over a catalyst (e.g., copper chromite), which are produced by esterifying either the ammonium carboxylate salts (e.g., ammonium acetate, propionate, butyrate) or the carboxylic acids (e.g., acetic, propionic, <b>butyric</b> <b>acid)</b> with a high-molecular-weight alcohol (e.g., hexanol, heptanol).

40|$|In {{the course}} of {{investigating}} certain aspects of carbohydrate fermentation in the rumen of the sheep it became necessary to estimate the individual concentrations of formic, acetic, propionic and <b>butyric</b> <b>acids</b> in aqueous solutions containing all four components. Two main procedures are available for such analyses: the distillation method of Hillig & Knudsen (1942), which is based essentially on the classical Ducleaux (1874, 1900 a, b, 1908) procedure, and the method of Osburn, Wood & Werkman (1936) which involves partition of the acids between water and ether phases. In each of these methods formic acid is estimated by a separate procedure. Preliminary examination of the partition method proved its effectiveness for the assay of mixtures containing acetic, propionic and <b>butyric</b> <b>acids</b> except {{when one of the}} components constituted either a very large or a very small proportion of the mixture.

25|$|As the {{chlorine}} atom moves {{further away from}} the acidic O—H bond, its effect diminishes. When {{the chlorine}} atom is just one carbon removed from the carboxylic acid group, the acidity of the compound increases significantly compared to butanoic acid (a.k.a. <b>butyric</b> <b>acid).</b> However, when the chlorine atom is separated by several bonds, the effect is much smaller. Bromine is much more electronegative than either carbon or hydrogen, but not as electronegative as chlorine, so the pKa of 2-bromobutanoic acid is slightly greater than the pKa of 2-chlorobutanoic acid.|$|E
25|$|The {{first four}} names {{were derived from}} methanol, ether, propionic acid and <b>butyric</b> <b>acid,</b> {{respectively}} (hexadecane is also {{sometimes referred to as}} cetane).

Hence, pentane, C5H12; hexane, C6H14; heptane, C7H16; octane, C8H18; etc. The prefix is generally Greek, however alkanes with a carbon atom count ending in nine, for example nonane, use the Latin prefix non-.

40|$|Introduction. Berries contain high {{amounts of}} dietary fibre and {{flavonoids}} {{and have been}} associated with improved metabolic health. The mechanisms are not clear but the formation of SCFAs, especially propionic and <b>butyric</b> <b>acids,</b> could be important. The potent antioxidant and antimicrobial properties of flavonoids could also be a factor, but little is known about their fate in the gastrointestinal tract. Aim. To compare how blackcurrants, blackberries, raspberries, and Lactobacillus plantarum HEAL 19 affect formation of SCFAs, inflammatory status, caecal microbial diversity, and flavonoids. Results and Conclusions. Degradation of the dietary fibre, formation of SCFAs including propionic and <b>butyric</b> <b>acids,</b> the weight of the caecal content and tissue, and the faecal wet and dry weight were all higher in rats fed blackcurrants rather than blackberries or raspberries. However, the microbial diversity of the gut microbiota was higher in rats fed raspberries. The high content of soluble fibre in blackcurrants and the high proportion of mannose-containing polymers might explain these effects. Anthocyanins could only be detected in urine of rats fed blackcurrants, and the excretion was lower with HEAL 19. No anthocyanins or anthocyanidins were detected in caecal content or blood. This may indicate uptake in the stomach or small intestine...|$|R
