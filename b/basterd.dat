5000|$|A {{review by}} Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly called it [...] "a {{harrowing}} nail-biter of a movie". Ella Taylor of NPR wrote In Darkness [...] "satisfies for {{the intensity of}} the performances and for the artful contrasting of life on the teeming streets of L'viv with life and death in the dim, rat-infested sewers", adding that it [...] "is often a thrilling adventure picture — as if Anne Frank had found an Inglourious <b>Basterd</b> to help her make The Great Escape". Ty Burr of The Boston Globe called the film [...] "a harrowing Holocaust tale, but one that speaks to humankind's capacity to endure, to fight on in the face of terrible cruelty", adding that Holland [...] "elicits taut performances from a strong cast". David Denby of The New Yorker called it [...] "the most volatile that Holland has directed. With a distinguished, hardworking cast of German and Polish actors", noting that [...] "honesty is the movie's greatest strength". Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter said this [...] "harrowing, engrossing, claustrophobic and sometimes literally hard to watch … robust, arduous drama is more ironic and multi-faceted than most such tales and should be well received by the considerable art house audience worldwide partial to the subject matter". Joe Morgenstern of The Wall Street Journal said this [...] "brave epic" [...] film's [...] "suspense, derived from a true story, is excruciating and inspiring in equal measure". A. O. Scott of The New York Times called In Darkness [...] "suspenseful, horrifying and at times intensely moving … touching, warm and dramatically satisfying". On the other hand, Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times dismissed the film as redundant and inferior to Schindler's List which was [...] "more entertaining" [...] in his view. Michael Atkinson of the Village Voice claimed that [...] "Holland does skirt the ethical entrapment of Schindler's List (over-lionizing the Aryan rescuer)", adding: [...] "It's not fair, but there it is: We've been here before." [...] The German authorities in occupied Poland referred to non-Jews, including Poles, as Aryans; colloquially, documents proving one's non-Jewish identity were called [...] "Aryan papers", and the areas prohibited to Jews were known collectively as [...] "the Aryan side". the Polish districts of citi David Edelstein of New York Magazine wrote: [...] "In outline, In Darkness is a standard conversion melodrama, but little within those parameters is easy. The darkness lingers into the light." [...] Mick LaSalle of San Francisco Chronicle called it [...] "an extraordinary movie, and somehow good art … a gripping piece of history and also an exploration into the mysteries of the human soul", and gave it [...] "the highest recommendation".|$|E
