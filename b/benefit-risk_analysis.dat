Methods: This was a blinded end point analysis of randomly selected 12 -week routine/open-label data of the German Pain Registry on adult patients with cLBP-NC who initiated an index treatment {{in compliance with the}} current German prescribing information between 1 st January and 31 st October 2015 (OXN/TAP, n= 128 / 133). Primary end point was defined as a composite of three efficacy components (≥ 30 % improvement of pain, pain-related disability, and quality of life each at the end of observation vs baseline) and three tolerability components (normal bowel function, absence of either central nervous system side effects, and treatment-emergent adverse event [TEAE]-related treatment discontinuation during the observation period) adopted to reflect BRP assessments under real-life conditions. Results: Demographic as well as baseline and pretreatment characteristics were comparable for the randomly selected data sets of both index groups without any indicators for critical selection biases. Treatment with OXN resulted formally in a BRP noninferior to that of TAP and showed a significantly higher primary end point response vs TAP (39. 8 % vs 25. 6 %, odds ratio: 1. 93; P= 0. 014), due to superior analgesic effects. Between-group differences increased with stricter response definitions for all three efficacy components in favor of OXN: ≥ 30 %/≥ 50 %/≥ 70 % response rates for OXN vs TAP were seen for pain intensity in 85. 2 %/ 67. 2 %/ 39. 1 % vs 83. 5 %/ 54. 1 %/ 15. 8 % (P= ns/ 0. 031 /< 0. 001), for pain-related disability in 78. 1 %/ 64. 8 %/ 43. 8 % vs 66. 9 %/ 50. 4 %/ 24. 8 % (P= 0. 043 / 0. 018 / 0. 001), and for quality of life in 76. 6 %/ 68. 0 %/ 50. 0 % vs 63. 9 %/ 54. 1 %/ 34. 6 % (P= 0. 026 / 0. 022 / 0. 017). Overall, OXN vs TAP treatments were well tolerated, and proportions of patients who either maintained a normal bowel function (68. 0 % vs 72. 2 %), reported no central nervous system side effects (91. 4 % vs 89. 5 %), or completed the 12 -week evaluation period without any TEAE-related treatment discontinuations (93. 0 % vs 92. 5 %) were similar for both index medications (P= ns for each comparison). Conclusion: In daily practice, the BRP of OXN proved to be noninferior to that of TAP in patients with cLBP-NC, but showed a superior efficacy if stricter analgesic response definitions were evaluated.

40|$|Adherence to {{medication}} {{in patients}} with rheumatoid arthritis is low, varying from 30 to 80 %. Improving adherence to therapy could therefore dramatically improve the efficacy of drug therapy. Although indicators for suboptimal adherence can be useful to identify nonadherent patients, and could function as targets for adherence-improving interventions, no indicators are yet found to be consistently and strongly related to nonadherence. Despite this, nonadherence behavior could conceptually be categorized into two subtypes: unintentional (due to forgetfulness, regimen complexity or physical problems) and intentional (based on the patient’s decision to take no/less medication). In case of intentional nonadherence, patients seem to make a <b>benefit–risk</b> <b>analysis</b> weighing the perceived risks of the treatment against the perceived benefits.

40|$|To be able {{to perform}} a {{comprehensive}} and rigorous <b>benefit-risk</b> <b>analysis</b> of individual food components, and of foods, a number of fundamental questions need to be addressed first.

This article examines the last of these issues, focusing upon concepts for the development of new biomarkers of health. Clearly, there is scope for refinement of classical biomarkers so that they may be used to detect even earlier signs of disease, but this approach defines health solely as the absence of detectable disease or disease risk.

Here, we determine blood ethanol and acetaldehyde concentrations in 49 preterm infants (median birth weight[*]=[*] 1190 g) dosed with iron or furosemide, medicines that contain different amounts of ethanol, and in 11 control group infants (median birth weight[*]=[*] 1920 g) who were not on any medications. Median ethanol concentrations in neonates administered iron or furosemide were 0. 33 (range[*]=[*] 0 – 4. 92) mg/L, 0. 39 (range[*]=[*] 0 – 72. 77) mg/L and in control group infants were 0. 15 (range[*]=[*] 0. 03 – 5. 4) mg/L. Median acetaldehyde concentrations in neonates administered iron or furosemide were 0. 16 (range[*]=[*] 0 – 8. 89) mg/L, 0. 21 (range[*]=[*] 0 – 2. 43) mg/L and in control group infants were 0. 01 (range[*]=[*] 0 – 0. 14) mg/L.

40|$|PURPOSE: Difficulties may be {{encountered}} when undertaking a {{benefit-risk assessment}} {{for an older}} product with well-established use but with a benefit-risk balance that may have changed over time. This case study investigates this specific situation by applying a formal benefit-risk framework to assess the benefit-risk balance of warfarin for primary prevention of patients with atrial fibrillation. METHODS: We used the qualitative framework BRAT {{as the starting point}} of the <b>benefit-risk</b> <b>analysis,</b> bringing together the relevant available evidence. We explored the use of a quantitative method (stochastic multi-criteria acceptability analysis) to demonstrate how uncertainties and preferences on multiple criteria can be integrated into a single measure to reduce cognitive burden and increase transparency in decision making. RESULTS: Our benefit-risk model found that warfarin is favourable compared with placebo for the primary prevention of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation. This favourable benefit-risk balance is fairly robust to differences in preferences. The probability of a favourable benefit-risk for warfarin against placebo is high (0. 99) in our model despite the high uncertainty of randomised clinical trial data. In this case study, we identified major challenges related to the identification of relevant benefit-risk criteria and taking into account the diversity and quality of evidence available to inform the benefit-risk assessment. CONCLUSION: The main challenges in applying formal methods for medical benefit-risk assessment for a marketed drug are related to outcome definitions and data availability. Data exist from many different sources (both randomised clinical trials and observational studies), and the variability in the studies is large. Copyright © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|E

Methods A comprehensive review was performed to identify visuals used for medical risk and benefit–risk communication. The identified visual displays were grouped into visual types, and each visual type was appraised based on five criteria: intended audience, intended message, knowledge required to understand the visual, unintentional messages that may be derived from the visual and missing information that may be needed to understand the visual. Results Sixty-six examples of visual formats were identified from the literature and classified into 14 visual types. We found that there is not one single visual format that is consistently superior to others for the communication of benefit–risk information. In addition, we found that most of the drawbacks found in the visual formats could be considered general to visual communication, although some appear more relevant to specific formats and should be considered when creating visuals for different audiences depending on the exact message to be communicated. Conclusion We have arrived at recommendations for the use of visual displays for benefit–risk communication. The recommendation refers to the creation of visuals. We outline four criteria to determine audience–visual compatibility and consider these to be a key task in creating any visual.

The objective {{of this study is}} to evaluate the incremental net benefit (INB) framework for undertaking quantitative benefit–risk assessment by performing a quantitative <b>benefit–risk</b> <b>analysis</b> of alosetron for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome from the patients’ perspective. MethodsA discrete event simulation model was developed to determine the INB of alosetron relative to placebo, calculated as “relative value-adjusted life-years (RVALYs). ”ResultsIn the base case analysis, alosetron resulted in a mean INB of 34. 1 RVALYs per 1000 patients treated relative to placebo over 52 weeks of treatment. Incorporating parameter uncertainty into the model, probabilistic sensitivity analysis revealed a mean INB of 30. 4 (95 % confidence interval 15. 9 – 45. 4) RVALYs per 1000 patients treated relative to placebo over 52 weeks of treatment. Overall, there was > 99 % chance that both the incremental benefit and incremental risk associated with alosetron are greater than placebo. As hypothesized, the INB of alosetron was greatest in patients with the worst quality of life experienced at baseline. The mean INB associated with alosetron in patients with mild, moderate, and severe symptoms at baseline was 17. 97 (− 0. 55 to 36. 23), 29. 98 (17. 05 – 43. 37), and 35. 98 (23. 49 – 48. 77) RVALYs per 1000 patients treated, respectively.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundPatients, physicians, {{and other}} {{decision}} makers make implicit but inevitable trade-offs among {{risks and benefits}} of treatments. Many methods have been proposed to promote transparent and rigorous <b>benefit-risk</b> <b>analysis</b> (BRA). ObjectiveTo propose a framework for classifying BRA methods on the basis of key factors that matter most for patients by using a common mathematical notation and compare their results using a hypothetical example. MethodsWe classified the available BRA methods into three categories: 1) unweighted metrics, which use only probabilities of benefits and risks; 2) metrics that incorporate preference weights and that account for the impact and duration of benefits and risks; and 3) metrics that incorporate weights based on decision makers’ opinions. We used two hypothetical antiplatelet drugs (a and b) to compare the BRA methods within our proposed framework. ResultsUnweighted metrics include the number needed to treat and the number needed to harm. Metrics that incorporate preference weights include those that use maximum acceptable risk, those that use relative-value–adjusted life-years, and those that use quality-adjusted life-years. Metrics that use decision makers’ weights include the multicriteria decision analysis, the benefit-less-risk analysis, Boers’ 3 by 3 table, the Gail/NCI method, and the transparent uniform risk benefit overview. Most BRA methods can be derived as a special case of a generalized formula in which some are mathematically identical. Numerical comparison of methods highlights potential differences in BRA results and their interpretation. ConclusionsThe proposed framework provides a unified, patient-centered approach to BRA methods classification based on the types of weights that are used across existing methods, a key differentiating feature...|$|E

MethodsWe developed a decision-analytic model to compare the treatment of latent TB infection in subgroups of contacts to no treatment over a 6 -year time horizon in a Canadian setting. Contacts were stratified into 32 groups {{on the basis of}} five binary variables: type of contact (close or casual), tuberculin skin test (TST) results (positive or negative at 5 mm cutoff), Bacillus Calmette-Guérin vaccination status, place of birth (foreign- or Canadian-born), and age group (cutoff 35 years). Risk of TB reactivation was calculated for each subgroup from a longitudinal registry of contacts, adjusted for several potential confounders and comorbid conditions. We calculated the quality-adjusted life-years gained because of delayed or prevention of active TB via treatment of latent TB infection versus quality-adjusted life-years lost because of the adverse events to INH. ResultsA targeted policy based on adopting INH therapy only in subgroups with positive expected incremental net health benefit resulted in a different treatment decision than the current guidelines in five subgroups comprising 3. 9 % of the contacts. Namely, the targeted policy comprised no INH therapy in casual contacts with a positive vaccination history even with a positive TST result and INH therapy in foreign-born close contacts younger than 35 years even with a negative TST result. ConclusionsFrom a benefit-risk viewpoint, INH treatment of contacts should be tailored on the basis of risk assessment algorithms that consider a range of factors at the time of screening...|$|E

In addition, {{the potential impact of}} CD on growth, pubertal and emotional development of patients underlines the need for a specific management strategy of pediatric-onset CD. To develop the first evidenced based and consensus driven guidelines for pediatric-onset CD an expert panel of 33 IBD specialists was formed after an open call within the European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation and the European Society of Pediatric Gastroenterolog, Hepatology and Nutrition. The aim was to base on a thorough review of existing evidence a state of the art guidance on the medical treatment and long term management of children {{and adolescents}} with CD, with individualized treatment algorithms based on a <b>benefit-risk</b> <b>analysis</b> according to different clinical scenarios. In children and adolescents who did not have finished their growth, exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) is the induction therapy of first choice due to its excellent safety profile, preferable over corticosteroids, which are equipotential to induce remission.

The experts discuss several factors potentially predictive for poor disease outcome (such as severe perianal fistulizing disease, severe stricturing/penetrating disease, severe growth retardation, panenteric disease, persistent severe disease despite adequate induction therapy), which may incite to an anti-TNF-based top down approach. These guidelines are intended to give practical (whenever possible evidence-based) answers to (pediatric) gastroenterologists who take care of children and adolescents with CD; they are not meant to be a rule or legal standard, since many different clinical scenario exist requiring treatment strategies not covered by or different from these guidelines...|$|E

This review assesses the clinical pharmacology of dapsone and its adverse drug reactions in relation to haemolysis, glucose- 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase (G 6 PD) deficiency, blood dyscrasias and methaemoglobinaemia. Studies are summarised reporting its use in leprosy, dermatological and other conditions, and malaria, in relation to maternal and infant outcomes. A total of 924 pregnancies were identified during which dapsone therapy was taken. Only limited data are available and this precludes a meaningful quantitative <b>benefit-risk</b> <b>analysis.</b> Mild degrees of haemolysis consistently occur with continued therapy, although adverse effects may be less likely with intermittent treatment, as most reported adverse effects have occurred with long-term use of dapsone. There are a number of gaps in knowledge where more data are needed. These include no data on pharmacokinetics in pregnancy and whether these are altered with co-administration of chlorproguanil. Potential complications in women with severe anaemia are unknown and there is no information on haemolytic effects in women or the fetus with G 6 PD deficiency. The use of dapsone in HIV-infected women in malarious areas could carry increased risks because of the immunosuppressive actions of the drug. Trials of dapsone therapy in pregnancy should be considered in malarious areas where there is good reason for its deployment. Controlled trials have provided data on maternal tolerance, and dapsone in combination with other antimalarial drugs can offer clear benefit in terms of improved birthweight. The use of dapsone combinations should be considered when no good alternative is available and the threat of malaria is the greater ris...|$|E
