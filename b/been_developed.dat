5000|$|At {{least one}} package, WinIDAMS, <b>was</b> <b>developed</b> for the {{purposes}} of making key technologies available to those who could not otherwise afford them, to empower development. [...] OpenStat and Instat <b>were</b> <b>developed</b> as teaching aids. Other packages <b>were</b> <b>developed</b> for specific purposes but can be more generally used. Examples <b>are</b> Irristat, <b>developed</b> for agricultural analysis, and Epi Info, developed for public health. Several of the packages, PSPP, R and Osiris don't appear to give any statements about why they <b>were</b> <b>developed,</b> other than just general use for statistical analysis.|$|R

5|$|Despite Putnam's {{rejection}} of functionalism, it {{has continued to}} flourish and has <b>been</b> <b>developed</b> into numerous versions by thinkers as diverse as David Marr, Daniel Dennett, Jerry Fodor, and David Lewis. Functionalism helped lay the foundations for modern cognitive science and is the dominant theory of mind in philosophy today.|$|E
5|$|Emphasis in Alzheimer's {{research}} {{has been placed on}} diagnosing the condition before symptoms begin. A number of biochemical tests have <b>been</b> <b>developed</b> to attempt earlier detection. One such test involves the analysis of cerebrospinal fluid for beta-amyloid or tau proteins, both total tau protein and phosphorylated tau181P protein concentrations.|$|E
5|$|If the ylide carbon is {{substituted}} with an aryl or allyl group, the reagent {{is referred}} to as a semi-stabilized ylide. These have <b>been</b> <b>developed</b> extensively, second only to the classical methylene reagents (R1=R2=H). The substitution pattern on aryl reagents can heavily influence the selectivity of the reaction as per the criteria above.|$|E
