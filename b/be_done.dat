5|$|Bicycle kicks are {{generally}} done in two situations, one defensive {{and the other}} offensive. A defensive bicycle kick is done when a player facing his side's goal uses the action to clear {{the ball in the}} direction opposite his side's goalmouth. Sports historian Richard Witzig considers defensive bicycle kicks a desperate move requiring less aim than its offensive variety. An offensive bicycle kick is used when a player has his back to the opposing goal and is near the goalmouth. According to Witzig, the offensive bicycle kick requires concentration and a good understanding of the ball's location. Bicycle kicks can also <b>be</b> <b>done</b> in the midfield, but this is not recommended because safer and more accurate passes can <b>be</b> <b>done</b> in this zone.|$|E

5|$|German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer criticised Kant's {{belief that}} ethics should concern {{what ought to}} <b>be</b> <b>done,</b> insisting that the scope of ethics should be to attempt to explain and {{interpret}} what actually happens. Whereas Kant presented an idealized version of what ought to <b>be</b> <b>done</b> in a perfect world, Schopenhauer argued that ethics should instead be practical and arrive at conclusions that could work in the real world, capable of being presented {{as a solution to}} the world's problems. Schopenhauer drew a parallel with aesthetics, arguing that in both cases prescriptive rules are not {{the most important part of}} the discipline. Because he believed that virtue cannot be taught—a person is either virtuous or is not—he cast the proper place of morality as restraining and guiding people's behavior, rather than presenting unattainable universal laws.|$|E
