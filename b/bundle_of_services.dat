40|$|Abstract. In search-based {{markets with}} noisy signals, like {{the market for}} used cars, experts can play an {{important}} role. These experts act as information brokers, revealing the true value of a good in exchange for the payment of a fee. Sometimes these experts may choose to sell only <b>bundles</b> <b>of</b> their <b>services</b> (three car inspections for a fixed price, e. g.). We analyze <b>bundling</b> <b>of</b> <b>services</b> in a model of expert-mediated (one-sided) search, and derive optimal strategies for experts and buyers. Our analysis reveals some surprising results. In particular, there are situations where offering only non-unit-size <b>bundles</b> <b>of</b> <b>services</b> can be pareto-improving for the expert and the buyer. Further, in markets with low search costs, the optimal strategy for the expert may well be to offer unlimited services for a single flat fee...|$|R

40|$|<b>Bundling</b> <b>of</b> <b>services</b> by {{insurance}} payers {{is a common}} problem, especially for osteopathic physicians (DOs) seeking reimbursement for osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT). In their August article, Karen T. Snider, DO, and Douglas J. Jorgensen, DO, CPC, 1 elucidate reimbursement issues related to OMT by focusing on two common problems: (1) insurance companies bundling OMT with evaluation and management services, and (2) lack of justification for OMT services provided. Regarding the <b>bundling</b> <b>of</b> <b>services,</b> {{it is important to}} clarify the appropriate codes for evaluation and management services. As stated in the article, 1 When OMT is provided, the evalua-tion and management service should be billed using the appropriate code (eg, 99212 through 99215) with a- 25 modifier to indicate that a separately identifiable service was performed on the same day. In the interest of completeness, DOs should note that evaluation and man-agement codes begin with 99211, which is the lowest level of billing for an estab-lished patient office visit <b>service.</b> 2 Exclu-sion <b>of</b> the 99211 code should not be perceived as always being inappro-priate. However, for visits in which OMT is provided with an evaluation and management service, this code would likely not be used. The 99211 evaluation and manage-ment code is used for focused visits in which physicians or auxiliary personnel provide minimal service to a patient (eg, blood pressure measurement). 2 Therefore, a situation in which a DO would provide a minimal evaluation (ie, 99211 service) and OMT would be rare. For more information on how to use codes, DOs are encouraged to con-sult the current CPT manual 2 or th...|$|R

METHODS HIV patients without prior history of tuberculosis enrolled in the KIULARCO cohort between 2005 and 2013 were included. Cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate rates and predictors of tuberculosis ascertainment. RESULTS Of 7114 HIV positive patients enrolled, 5123 (72 %) had no history of tuberculosis. Of these, 66 % were female, median age was 38 years, median baseline CD 4 + cell count was 243 cells/µl, and 43 % had WHO clinical stage 3 or 4. During follow-up, 421 incident tuberculosis cases were notified with an estimated incidence of 3. 6 per 100 person-years (p-y) [95 % confidence interval (CI) 3. 26 - 3. 97]. The incidence rate varied over time and increased significantly from 2. 96 to 43. 98 cases per 100 p-y after the introduction of the <b>bundle</b> <b>of</b> <b>services</b> in December 2012. Four independent predictors of tuberculosis ascertainment were identified:poor clinical condition at baseline (Hazard Ratio (HR) 3. 89, 95 % CI 2. 87 - 5. 28), WHO clinical stage 3 or 4 (HR 2. 48, 95 % CI 1. 88 - 3. 26), being antiretroviralnaïve (HR 2. 97, 95 % CI 2. 25 - 3. 94), and registration in 2013 (HR 6. 07, 95 % CI 4. 39 - 8. 38).
