It seeks to provide insights into the national special education traditions in these countries and aims to establish how these have influenced current developments in inclusive education together with and alongside powerful external change agents. This research focuses on policy makers' perspectives on changes associated with inclusion. There are significant similarities in the way inclusive education reforms are being perceived and implemented in both countries, and analysis suggests there is a strong need for regional co-operation with shifts in both policy and practice...|$|R

The countries included in the research are the Czech Republic (CZ), Estonia (EE), Hungary (HU), Poland (PL), Slovenia (SI), Latvia (LV), Lithuania (LT), Slovakia (SK), <b>Bulgaria</b> (<b>BG)</b> and Romania (RO).

40|$|Open {{markets are}} an {{integral}} part of urban areas that provide a means for intense sharing of knowledge and practices about plants among people from different social groups and different cultural and geographical origins. This study focuses on the diversity of wild plants found in open markets in urban areas on both sides of the Bulgarian-Turkish border, sold as food and plants for prevention, treatment and healing. Information was collected from open markets by free-listed observations and semi-structured interviews in border regions of Southern and South-eastern <b>Bulgaria</b> (<b>Bg)</b> and North-western Turkey (Tr). The present investigation was carried out through 2011 - 2013. A total of 41 wild plants belonging to 20 families were documented. In this study, two main groups of wild plants were outlined: medicinal and edible, sold mostly as fresh fruits, dry fruits, fresh aerial parts, preserved foods and mono-component herbal teas. The specific use of plants in the border sub-regions can be outlined as follows: as edible greens (Tr), as edible fruits (Bg), as ready-prepared herbal mixtures (Bg), as fresh herbs (Tr). Urtica urens (Tr) is a culturally distinctive plant as well as use of edible greens mixture (Tr) and use of the wild fruits for healthy and traditional food (Tr). Approximately 17 % of the plants were common and widely reported on both sides of the border: such as Urtica dioica, Rumex patientia, Rumex acetosella, Cotinus coggygria, Hypericum perforatum, Sideritis scardica (endemic), Rosa canina and Tilia spp...|$|R
5000|$|Since 1992, {{the letter}} license plate code used letters common {{to both the}} Latin and Cyrillic alphabets, {{irrespective}} of whether {{they have the same}} phonetic value or not: А, В, Е, К, М, Н, О, Р, С, Т, У, Х, the same as today. A similar system is used in Greece, Russia, Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Ukraine. Regions are as per ISO 3166-2:BG. The new 1992 issue of plates used a white background, in the format [...] "X(X) NNNN Y". All former yellow background plates became invalid. In 1993, The hyphens/stops between letter and number blocks were also phased out and also became invalid in 1993. During the mid-1990s, the [...] "X NNNN Y" [...] combinations began to run out in many provinces (as there were only 90,000 possible combinations), and so a second letter was added to the series. Between 2000-2008, the left-hand blue band Bulgaria flag was phased in, eventually becoming a legal requirement on 1 July 2006. These plates were all in the [...] "X(X) NNNN YY" [...] format, but the shape of the letters was changed to the current standard - namely, the letters were made more [...] "square" [...] and heavier-set than previously. These plates all began with the series [...] "AA", thereby repeating some combinations that had already existed before, albeit without the EU strip. On 1 January 2007 <b>Bulgaria</b> (<b>BG)</b> and Romania (RO) joined the European Union, and the standardised Europlate was introduced soon after.|$|R
40|$|Hyperaccumulation {{of nickel}} to {{concentrations}} above 1000 mg kg- 1 on a dry matter basis has become {{recognized as an}} unusual response by some plant species to the elevated nickel concentrations generally found in soils derived from ultramafi c rocks (oft en referred to as serpentine soils). Such soils are widespread in the Balkans. Th ese soils host some widespread species and {{a smaller number of}} regional or local endemics. Several serpentine areas in Albania (AL), <b>Bulgaria</b> (<b>BG)</b> and Greece (GR) have been surveyed {{because of the presence of}} nickel hyperaccumulating endemics, including some that are common for all three studied countries. Th e objectives of the study were to widen understanding of the distribution of the nickel hyperaccumulators and their uptake behaviour in relation to the characteristics of their native soil environments. Collection and chemical analysis of both plant and soil samples has allowed evaluation of phenotypic effi cacy in hyperaccumulating nickel. In total, eight taxa were studied. In this work the highest Ni concentrations in leaves (1. 5 - 2. 0 %) were found in Alyssum murale at Pojska (AL), A. murale at Kazak (BG), A. markgrafi i at Gjegjan (AL) and Th laspi kovatsii at Fotinovo (BG). Th e maximum quotients of plant Ni concentration to soil Ni concentration range from 13. 9 for A. markgrafi i to 6 - 7 for A. murale, T. kovatsii and T. tymphaeum from northern Greece. Eight of the taxa collected in this work show hyperaccumulation of Ni; these include A. murale subsp. pichleri and all of Th laspi species studied from serpentine in Bulgaria. In total, twenty-fi ve Ni hyperaccumulating taxa are now known from the Brassicaceae of Albania, Bulgaria and Greece. Because of its high biomass production, A. murale is likely to be the most suitable species for Ni phytomining in the Balkans...|$|R
