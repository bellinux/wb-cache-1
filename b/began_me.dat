6000|$|To the leavened soil they trod, calling, I sing, for the last; Not cities, nor man alone, nor war, nor the dead: But {{forth from}} my tent {{emerging}} for good--loosing, untying the tent-ropes; In the freshness, the forenoon air, in the far-stretching circuits and [...] vistas, again to peace restored; To the fiery fields emanative, and the endless vistas beyond--to the south [...] and the north; To the leavened {{soil of the}} general Western World, to attest my songs, To the average earth, the wordless earth, witness of war and peace, To the Alleghanian hills, and the tireless Mississippi, To the rocks I, calling, sing, and all {{the trees in the}} woods, To the plain of the poems of heroes, to the prairie spreading wide, To the far-off sea, and the unseen winds, and the sane impalpable air.

60|$|In {{the third}} year I <b>began</b> <b>me</b> a pillar of rock. Rather was it a pyramid, four-square, broad at the base, sloping upward not steeply to the apex. In this fashion I was {{compelled}} to build, for gear and timber there was none in all the island {{for the construction of}} scaffolding. Not until the close of the fifth year was my pyramid complete. It stood on the summit of the island. Now, when I state that the summit was but forty feet above the sea, and that the peak of my pyramid was forty feet above the summit, it will be conceived that I, without tools, had doubled the stature of the island. It might be urged by some unthinking ones that I interfered with God's plan {{in the creation of the}} world. Not so, I hold. For was not I equally a part of God's plan, along with this heap of rocks upjutting in the solitude of ocean? My arms with which to work, my back with which to bend and lift, my hands cunning to clutch and hold--were not these parts too in God's plan? Much I pondered the matter. I know that I was right.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{can trace}} its lineage {{to a paper}} I wrote as an undergraduate at Baylor University. My fascination with Horace and with Odes 4 began there under Timothy Johnson, now at the University of Florida. It was he and Alden Smith who <b>began</b> <b>me</b> on the path along which this dissertation is a milestone. I also had opportunity to develop ideas contained in this dissertation with R. T. Scott while at Bryn Mawr College. The ideas reached maturity at the University of Texas at Austin. In Karl Galinsky's seminar on Roman Religion, I began thinking about Horace's meditations on death and immortality. It was in Penelope Davies ' seminar on Roman Imperial Funeral Monuments that the connection between Odes 4 and the Mausoleum of Augustus first occurred to me. I owe a special debt of gratitude to Karl Galinsky. His approach to Classics and to the intellectual life is something I try to emulate. His insight, encouragement, and direction have guided me {{through the process of}} completing this dissertation. I am also grateful to my committee: Timothy Moore, Michael White, Penelope Davies, and Eleanor Winsor Leach. They read and re-read countless drafts. If anything is well-argued o...|$|E
