40|$|This report {{analyzes}} a {{broad spectrum}} of strategies for actively or passively controlling the inlet state of fixed-geometry expansion devices such as capillary and orifice tubes, to match compressor mass flow rates with minimal performance degradation in an efficient R 410 A a/c system. A TXV system was selected as the baseline for an exhaustive series of design options, including from heat exchanger sizing to use of receivers, internal heat exchangers, <b>bladder</b> <b>accumulator</b> and simple air flow modulation. Results yielded insights that can be generalized to other refrigerants and systems. Orifice tubes were found to produce higher efficiency than capillary tubes across the entire range of operating conditions, although the difference can be mitigated by proper choice of the latter???s length and diameter. Only one configuration appears to be capable of matching TXV system performance across a wide range of operating conditions: a short tube orifice with low side receiver and internal heat exchanger.

40|$|All {{commonly}} used Hydro-Fluoro-Carbon (HFC) refrigerants {{have a high}} Global Warming Potential (GWP), higher than 1000, and some countries have already enacted legislative measures towards a limitation in the use or a gradual phase-out of HFCs. HFO 1234 ze(Z) {{was identified as a}} new low GWP refrigerant, which {{has the potential to be}} a global sustainable solution particularly for heat pump application. HFO 1234 ze(Z) is a pure compound which exhibits low pressure and is classified by ANSI / ASHRAE Standard 34 (2010) as class A 2 L refrigerants (lower flammability and lower toxicity). Therefore, it can be used in direct expansion systems without the need for a secondary loop as alternative for HFC 236 fa and HC 600 a. This paper presents the experimental heat transfer coefficients and pressure drop measured during HFO 1234 ze(Z) saturated vapour condensation inside a small commercial BPHE: the effects of refrigerant mass flux and saturation temperature were investigated. The experimental facility consists of a refrigerant loop, a water-glycol loop and two water loops. In the first loop the refrigerant is pumped from the sub-cooler into the evaporator where it is evaporated to achieve the set condition at the condenser inlet. The refrigerant goes through the condenser where it is condensed and then it comes back to the post-condenser and the sub-cooler. A variable speed volumetric pump varies the refrigerant flow rate and a <b>bladder</b> <b>accumulator,</b> connected to a nitrogen bottle and a pressure regulator, controls the operating pressure in the refrigerant loop. The second loop is able to supply a water-glycol flow at a constant temperature used to feed the sub-cooler and the post-condenser. A set of 42 saturated vapour condensation data points with refrigerant down-flow and water up-flow was carried out at four different saturation temperatures: 25, 30, 35 and 40 °C. The experimental results were presented in terms of heat transfer coefficients and frictional pressure drop. The heat transfer coefficients show weak sensitivity to saturation temperature and great sensitivity to refrigerant mass flux. At low refrigerant mass flux (3 ̆c 20 kg/m 2 s) the heat transfer coefficients are independent of mass flux and condensation is controlled by gravity. For higher refrigerant mass flux (3 ̆e 20 kg/m 2 s) the heat transfer coefficients depend on mass flux and forced convection condensation occurs. The frictional pressure drop shows a linear dependence on the kinetic energy per unit volume of the refrigerant flow and therefore a quadratic dependence on the refrigerant mass flux. HFO 1234 ze(Z) shows heat transfer coefficients higher both than HC 600 a and HFC 236 fa and frictional pressure drop higher than HFC 236 fa and lower than HC 600 a. The experimental results were compared against theoretical models for condensation heat transfer coefficients (Nusselt 1916 and Akers et al. 1959) and a new linear correlation for two-phase frictional pressure drop was presented...|$|E

It also {{had to be able to}} function at temperatures from −40 °F to +180 °F. There was a single insurmountable problem—weight, which was a problem since World War II aircraft were quite small. The use of a gas/oil separator, today called a bladder, solved the problem.|$|R
40|$|Abstract – The {{effect of}} {{synthetic}} leachate on the hydraulic conductivity of a clayey {{soil in the}} Urmia city landfill site, Iran, was investigated using a triaxial permeability apparatus. The <b>bladder</b> <b>accumulators</b> were fabricated for flexible wall triaxial permeability apparatus to facilitate synthetic leachate permeation in the apparatus. The landfill soil was tested and classified as silty clayey sand (SM-SC) and did not fulfill the requirements as a soil for landfill liner. Hence, the landfill soil was mixed with 12 % of a clayey soil from a nearby location to bring the index parameters of the mixed soil into a range specified for a landfill liner soil. The synthetic leachate was prepared with three different Ca++ concentrations. The mixed soil was compacted wet of optimum water content and permeated with tap water. After equilibrium, the tap water was replaced with synthetic leachate with three different Ca++ concentrations. The hydraulic conductivities of 1. 33 × 10 - 8 cm/s, 1. 81 × 10 - 8 cm/s, and 1. 77 × 10 - 8 cm/s were obtained for the soil permeated with synthetic leachate, compared with the average hydraulic conductivity of 1. 52 × 10 - 8 cm/s when permeated with tap water for tests A, B, and C, respectively. The synthetic leachate with a 1000 mg/L Ca++ concentration caused about a 13 % reduction in hydraulic conductivity in test A which {{could be due to}} the decrease in the void ratio because of the consolidation of the sample. The percentages of increase of hydraulic conductivity for tests B and C, in comparison with the values for tap water permeation, were 18 % and 20 %, respectively, which is attributed to double layer contraction and increased pore space, resulting from the adsorption of divalent cations into the soil matrix...|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} a new device (PCD) for {{prevention}} of water hammer due to fast valve closure in liquid filled pipe systems is developed. Investigations on {{the influence of}} the steady state initial velocity and pressure of the medium in the pipe, the valve closing time and check valves on water and cavitational hammer as well as investigations concerning the performance and the operational reliability of a PCD are made by the use of modern measurement technology. The theoretical part of this thesis contains simulations, which are concerned with the fast valve closure in liquids carrying pipelines with and without a PCD, taking fundamental operating conditions into account. Furthermore, a new code for the computing of water hammer damping with a PCD is developed, which uses the implicit Euler-Method for numerical solution. The new code is embedded as a dynamic boundary condition "shut-off valve" into thesimulation procedure. It is shown that the pressuretime course during the fast closure of single, liquid filled pipe systems is estimated well {{with the help of a}} PCD. Therefore, the new model is suitable for the design of a PCD in order to prevent unacceptable water hammer in piping systems. Several operating conditions can be analysed and compared cost-efficiently. Because of that particularly suitable operating conditions can be determined with the help of the new model. The new device distinguishes from common methods for prevention of water hammer, like surge tanks and air chambers, by omitting direct contact of the medium with gases (i. e. air). In contrast to air chambers and <b>bladder</b> <b>accumulators,</b> the PCD is not liable to the German "Druckbehälterverordnung" Due to its compact design it can be easily implemented in already existing plants. Collector and separator systems, required when using safety valves and rupture discs, are not necessary. A significant improvementtowards common positioner devices lies in its closed control loop. As a consequence, good damping can be achieved even at different steady state initial velocities of the medium...|$|R
50|$|A {{hydraulic}} hybrid vehicle uses hydraulic and mechanical components instead of electrical. A {{variable displacement pump}} replaces the electric motor/generator. A hydraulic accumulator stores energy. The vessel typically carries a flexible bladder of pre-charged pressurized nitrogen gas. Pumped hydraulic fluid is compressed against the bladder storing the energy in the compressed nitrogen gas. Some versions have a piston in a cylinder rather than a pressurized <b>bladder.</b> The hydraulic <b>accumulator</b> is potentially cheaper and more durable than batteries. Hydraulic hybrid technology was originally implemented in Germany in the 1930s. Volvo Flygmotor used petro-{{hydraulic hybrid}}s experimentally in buses from the early 1980s.|$|R
40|$|Accumulators are {{important}} components {{used in many}} systems at commercial boiling water reactors (BWRs) and pressurized water reactors in the United States. The accumulators are vessels attached to fluid systems to provide 1) a limited backup source of stored fluid energy for hydraulic/pneumatic mechanical equipment, 2) a damping effect on pressure pulses in fluid systems, and 3) a volume of fluid to be injected passively into a fluid system. Accumulators contain a gas that is compressed or expanded as the fluid from the system enters or exits the accumulator. The gas and fluid in accumulators are usually separated from each other by a piston or bladder. In support of the U. S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission's Nuclear Aging Research Program (NPAR), the Pacific Northwest Laboratory conducted an analysis of available industry databases to determine if accumulator components already had been studied in other NPAR assessments and to evaluate each accumulator type for applicable aging issues. The results of this preliminary study indicate that two critical uses of accumulators have been previously evaluated by the NPAR program. NUREGICR- 5699, Aging and Service Wear of Control Rod Drive Mechanisms for BUT Nuclear Plants (Greene 199 I), identified two hydraulic control unit components subject to aging failures: accumulator nitrogen-charging cartridge valves and the scram water accumulator. In addition, NUREGICR- 6001, Aging Assessment of BWR Standby Liquid Control Systems (Buckley et al. 1992), identified two predominant aging-related accumulator failures that result {{in a loss of}} the nitrogen blanket pressure: (charging) valve wear and failure of the gas bladder. The present study has identified five prevalent aging-related accumulator failures: rupture of the <b>accumulator</b> <b>bladder</b> separation of the metal disc {{from the bottom of the}} bladder leakage of the gas from the charging valve leakage past the safety injection tank manway cover gasket leakage past O-rings. An additional study of the accumulator subcomponents associated with these failures is recommended, including an evaluation of current inspection programs to verify that they are detecting the aging degradation effects. The study may also provide beneficial input to the design of passive accumulator applications in advanced reactor designs...|$|R
40|$|Blowout preventers are {{designed}} to shut in a well under pressure so that formation fluids that have moved into the wellbore can be contained and circulated out while continuous control of the well is maintained. Control Systems for the BOPs are of necessity highly efficient hydraulic systems. The objective is to operate functions, such as closing rams, on the BOP stack in as short a time as possible. Supplying enough volume of pressured hydraulic fluid to operate those emergency functions is essential. To have the necessary quantity of control fluid under pressure requires storing this fluid in accumulators. These accumulators operate by the expansion and compression of nitrogen gas that is separated from hydraulic fluid by either rubber <b>bladders</b> or pistons. <b>Accumulators</b> are used both {{on the surface and}} at the seafloor. As long as you use accumulators on the surface or in relatively shallow waters, you may not {{have a problem with the}} volume of hydraulic fluid capacity of gas charged accumulators. The problem may arise when the wellhead is at water depth of more than 3500 ft. In deep water drilling, the accumulators should be placed on the subsea blowout preventer stack to reduce hydraulic response times and provide a hydraulic power supply in case of interruption of surface communication. Accumulators are also used in subsea production control systems to provide local storage that allows smaller line sizes in control umbilicals. Hydraulic fluid capacity of an accumulator drops to 15 % of its capacity on the surface and even less, depending on the water depth. A large number of accumulators are needed to perform BOP functions that could have been done by just a few of them on the surface or at relatively shallow water depth. Gas inside gas charged accumulators does not behave like an ideal gas as we go to very deep water, due to high hydrostatic pressure at that water depth. The higher the ambient pressure, the more the gas behaves like a real gas rather than an ideal gas and the lower the fluid capacity of the accumulators. Compressed gas has energy in it, and can release this energy at the time desired, that??s why it is used in accumulators. Now, we have to look for something that is able to store energy, but unlike the nitrogen, its functionality must not be affected by the increasing hydrostatic pressure of water as a function of water depth. Springs and heavy weights will be discussed as two options to replace nitrogen in accumulators. Efficient deep water accumulators would reduce the number of accumulators required in deepwater and cut the cost of the project. With the advent of such efficient accumulators, we can hope that one of the numerous problems of deepwater drilling has been solved and we can think of drilling in even deeper waters...|$|R
40|$|For {{the last}} two decades the rubber {{division}} of BJ-Hughes, has been in the forefront of rubber technology as applied to products for the oil-well drilling industry. We welcomed the opportunities presented when we were selected to participate in the GEM program and extend our appreciation to L'Garde Inc., Department of Energy and Radian Corporation. Our first efforts, approximately 15 months ago were to duplicate the four compounds recommended by L'Garde and verify our ability to obtain equal physical properties. After some minor problems in obtaining exact duplication of the chemicals. we did succeed in matching the properties obtained by L'Garde. Aflas, a copolymer of teflon and propylene manufactured in Japan by Asahi Glass and represented by Xenox. Inc., is the basis elastomer for GEM formulation 291. Advantages of Aflas are high temperature resistance up to 550 F. (Short term), resistance to H{sub 2 }S and amine environment, acids, basis, many solvents and hydrocarbons. It also has excellent resistance to steam and will not hydrolize when exposed to high temperature and high pressure steam. It has excellent physical properties including long term compression-set resistance at high temperature. We have submitted two products manufactured from GEM 297 to customers for evaluation. One was an <b>accumulator</b> <b>bladder</b> for a hydraulic pumping system with hot oil on one side and nitrogen on the other. However, our customer reported that its service life was no better than they experienced with epichlorhydrin. The second application was an '' 0 '' ring for sealing a bearing in a drill bit. Compound 291 was {{one of a group of}} compounds and did not perform as well as several of the others. At the present time we are not planning any further investigation of this compound unless some application would seem to require Aflas over other elastomers. Viton, which is a DuPont fluoroelastomer, forms the basis for GEM formulation 255. Although the particular viton used in the original work is no longer available, a currently available material is equal or better in all respects. Most applications of Viton involve a sealing function of some sort. Lasting sealability when exposed to high heat, pressure, and aggressive chemicals or hydrocarbons is the strong point of Viton. Compared to the earlier compound, 255 shows superior resistance to oils and organic fluids and very good resistance to hot water, steam and aqueous acids. We did extensive work with the compound, evaluating various modifications and adjusting for several possible applications. Sample products submitted to customer for evaluation include packers, stabilizers, O'rings and bladders. We have also submitted compression-set buttons and tensile slabs at prospective users request. Of these, the stabilizers and O'rings were outperformed by other materials, while results with the packers and bladders have not been completed. We feel 255 is an excellent compound and that along with our variations, these Viton materials will be very useful in future products. GEM formulation 266 (a blend of Viton and EPDM) was also the basis of extensive investigation for us. We checked many variations, including DuPonts recommendations for such blends and in general, we feel such compounds are a promising compromise for some difficult applications. So far we have submitted drill-bit O'rings which did not prove resistant enough to abrasion; and stabilizers, which are still to be evaluated...|$|R
