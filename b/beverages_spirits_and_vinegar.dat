40|$|The mean goal of {{the study}} was to map food {{products}} that are constant or regular in Brazilian imports during 1989 - 2012 periods. Analyzing Brazilian agricultural imports face to Brazilian total imports it is possible to observe a decreasing cost of food imports in terms of Brazilian imports. Moreover, the study highlights big share of specific products in Brazilian agricultural imports, that is, at first, edible vegetables and certain roots, cereals, edible fruits and nuts, and animal or vegetable fats and oils; at second, dairy products, <b>beverages,</b> <b>spirits</b> <b>and</b> <b>vinegar,</b> live animals, meat and edible meat offal, oil seeds and oleaginous fruits, preparations of vegetables, and miscellaneous edible preparations. Future questions can include, for example, similar analyses at level of agricultural inputs employed in Brazil. Moreover, it would be useful to investigate if it is worth for Brazil boost internal production in the case of non-regular imports of foods...|$|E
40|$|In 2004 and 2007 twelve {{countries}} {{joined the}} European Union (EU), bringing about {{significant changes in}} the field of European agriculture. One of the major changes was the transformation of the agri-food trade of these countries. This paper analyses the effects of EU enlargement on the competitiveness of fruit spirits in six Central and Eastern European countries (CEECs), especially regarding geographical indications, by using the theory of revealed comparative advantages. Although the majority of the studied CEEC fruit spirits was both competitive and had a comparative advantage in the EU- 15 beverages market in the period 2001 - 2011, during this time the competitiveness in terms of quality and price of fruit spirits in the region declined. The results indicate that these countries are losing their market positions in their traditional fruit spirit sector in the EU- 15 beverages market {{in spite of the fact}} that the majority of these products have a geographical indication. These changes are in line with the overall trend of an increasing trade deficit in the overall <b>beverages,</b> <b>spirits</b> <b>and</b> <b>vinegar</b> market of the six CEECs with the EU- 15 after 2003. By contrast, the well-known grappa of Italy is shown to be competitive in terms of both price and quality during this period. It is clear that such products with geographical indications can be competitive in European markets...|$|E

The authors have recently worked on converting such biomass into middle heating-value gas via dual fluidized bed gasification (DFBG) integrated with various process intensification technologies. This article is devoted to highlighting those technical ways, including the choice of the superior technical deployment for a DFBG system, the impregnation of Ca onto fuel in fuel drying, the integration of gas cleaning with fuel gasification via two-stage DFBG (T-DFBG), and the decoupling of fuel drying/pyrolysis and char gasification via the decoupled DFBG (D-DFBG). The attained results demonstrated that the superior deployment of bed combination for the DFBG should be a bubbling/turbulent fluidized bed gasifier integrated with a pneumatic riser combustor. In terms of improving efficiency of fuel conversion into combustible gas and suppressing tar generation during gasification, the impregnation of Ca onto fuel exhibited distinctively high upgrading effect, while both the T-DFBG and D-DFBG were also demonstrated to be effective to a certain degree.

For all microorganisms, macroscopic and microscopic descriptions were performed. The identification of enterobacteria and lactic acid bacteria was carried out with biochemical tests, for mold a microscopic identification was applied by staining with lactophenol blue solution and for yeast the APIC AUX 20 kit was used. Count values in average were 2. 7 and 2. 5 log CFU / ml of total coliforms and enterobacteria, 1. 8 log CFU / ml of lactic acid bacteria and 2. 5 log CFU / ml for yeasts and molds.   During the three fermentation phases the most representative species were partially identified: 13 strains of Enterobacteriaceae, 9 strains of lactic acid bacteria, 15 strains of mold and 6 strains of yeast. </p...|$|R
