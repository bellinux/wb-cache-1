5000|$|This {{model was}} {{recognised}} {{to have become}} inaccurate for modern bearings. Particularly owing to improvements {{in the quality of}} <b>bearing</b> <b>steels,</b> the mechanisms for how failures develop in the 1924 model are no longer as significant. By the 1990s, real bearings were found to give service lives up to 14 times longer than those predicted. An explanation was put forward based on fatigue life; if the bearing was loaded to never exceed the fatigue strength, then the Lundberg-Palmgren mechanism for failure by fatigue would simply never occur. This relied on homogeneous vacuum-melted steels, such as AISI 52100, that avoided the internal inclusions that had previously acted as stress risers within the rolling elements, and also on smoother finishes to bearing tracks that avoided impact loads. The [...] constant now had values of 4 for ball and 5 for roller bearings. Provided that load limits were observed, the idea of a 'fatigue limit' entered bearing lifetime calculations: if the bearing was not loaded beyond this limit, its theoretical lifetime would be limited only by external factors, such as contamination or a failure of lubrication.|$|E

40|$|<b>Bearing</b> <b>steels</b> are {{a family}} of {{hardened}} steel alloys typically used for applications which require moving components. Given bearing steels’ prevalence in the aerospace industry, recent interest has arose regarding their corrosion properties. Corrosion resistance correlates with wear resistance and can provide a metric to assess and predict the relative wear lifetime of a bearing steel. Historically, an emphasis {{has been placed on}} designing <b>bearing</b> <b>steels</b> for high hardness values and a long fatigue life. However, low corrosion resistance can accelerate the wear rate of a bearing steel leading to unanticipated failure of the bearing component, increased maintenance cost, and possible catastrophic failure of an aircraft. This research aims to correlate the composition and microstructure of new candidate <b>bearing</b> <b>steels</b> with corrosion resistance. Generally, higher chromium content in the bearing steel gives higher corrosion resistance, but also greater cost and lower hardness. An optimized surface treatment is being sought. The corrosion properties of <b>bearing</b> <b>steels</b> with different surface treatments were determined using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The steel microstructure was analyzed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). Results indicated that the corrosion rate is dependent on composition, microstructure, and surface hardening method...|$|E

The goal of this work was to provide relevant corrosion rate data from different bearing case hardening processes to drive the development of cost efficient and better performing bearings.

40|$|This work {{integrates}} in-situ {{neutron diffraction}} and crystal plasticity {{finite element modeling}} to study the kinematic stability of retained austenite in high carbon <b>bearing</b> <b>steels.</b> The presence of a kinematically metastable retained austenite in <b>bearing</b> <b>steels</b> can significantly affect the macro-mechanical and micro-mechanical material response. Mechanical characterization of metastable austenite is a critical component in accurately capturing the micro-mechanical behavior under typical application loads. Traditional mechanical characterization techniques are unable to discretely quantify the micro-mechanical response of the austenite, and as a result, the computational predictions rely heavily on trial and error or qualitative descriptions of the austenite phase. In order to overcome this, in this present work, we use in-situ neutron diffraction of a uniaxial tension test of an A 485 Grade 1 bearing steel specimen. The mechanical response determined from the neutron diffraction analysis was incorporated into a hybrid crystal plasticity finite element model that accounts for the martensite's crystal plasticity and the stress-assisted transformation from austenite to martensite in <b>bearing</b> <b>steels.</b> The modeling response was used to estimate the single crystal elastic constants of the austenite and martensite phases. The results show that using in-situ neutron diffraction coupled with a crystal plasticity model, can successfully predict both the micro-mechanical and macro-mechanical responses of <b>bearing</b> <b>steels</b> while accounting for the martensitic transformation of the retained austenite...|$|E

40|$|The {{potential}} for significant performance increases, using ceramic materials in un-lubricated {{rolling element bearing}} applications, {{has been the subject}} of research over the past two decades. Practical advantages over steel include increased ability to withstand high loads, severe environments and high speeds. However, widespread acceptance has been limited by the inability to predict wear life for ceramic bearing applications. In this thesis, the rolling contact wear of 52100 <b>bearing</b> <b>steel</b> and Over-aged Magnesia-Partially-Stabilised Zirconia (OA-Mg-PSZ) ceramic are examined using a newly developed rolling contact wear test rig. The new wear test rig simulates the system geometry of an un-lubricated hybrid (ceramic and <b>steel)</b> ball <b>bearing.</b> The new wear test rig is versatile in that it allows low cost samples to be utilised resulting in a larger number of samples that can be tested. Wear samples of 52100 <b>bearing</b> <b>steel</b> and OA-Mg-PSZ produced by the new wear test rig were examined for mass loss and wear depth. The wear behavior of both the steel and ceramic material showed a dependence on operating variables time and load. Load was varied between 300 N to 790 N. Typical mass loss after 1 hour of testing 52100 <b>bearing</b> <b>steel</b> at 790 N was 0. 03 grams as compared to OA-Mg-PSZ which was 0. 001 grams. The rolling contact wear of the OA-Mg-PSZ was an order of magnitude lower than that of the 52100 <b>bearing</b> <b>steel.</b> The wear mechanism for 52100 <b>bearing</b> <b>steel</b> was typical of plastic deformation and shearing near and below the surface of rolling contact. Once cracks extend to reach the surface, thin flat like sheets are produced. In OA-Mg-PSZ the wear mechanism initially is that of plastic deformation on the scale of the surface asperities with asperity polishing occurring followed by lateral cracks and fatigue spallation. Results obtained using the new rolling contact wear test rig led to the establishment of a new equation for wear modeling of 52100 <b>bearing</b> <b>steel</b> and OA-Mg-PSZ ceramic materials...|$|R

40|$|Hydrogen {{embrittlement}} is {{a problem}} that offers challenges both to technology and to the theory of metallurgy. In the presence of a hydrogen rich environment, applications such as rolling bearings display a significant decrease in alloy strength and accelerated failure due to rolling contact fatigue. In spite of these problems being well recognised, there is little understanding as to which mechanisms are present in hydrogen induced bearing failure. The objective of this thesis are twofold. First, a novel alloy combining the excellent hardness of <b>bearing</b> <b>steels,</b> and resistance to hydrogen embrittlement, is proposed. Second, a new technique to identify the nature of hydrogen embrittlement in <b>bearing</b> <b>steels</b> is suggested. The new alloy was a successful result of computer aided alloy design; thermodynamic and kinetic modelling were employed to design a composition and heat treatment combining (1) fine cementite providing a strong and ductile microstructure, and (2) nano-sized vanadium carbide precipitates acting as hydrogen traps. A novel technique is proposed to visualise the migration of hydrogen to indentation-induced cracks. The observations employing this technique strongly suggest that hydrogen enhanced localised plasticity prevails in <b>bearing</b> <b>steels.</b> While proposing a hydrogen tolerant bearing steel grade, and a new technique to visualize hydrogen damage, this thesis is expected to aid in increasing the reliability of bearings operating in hydrogen rich environments.
