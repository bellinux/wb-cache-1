The column temperature was raised beyond the normal boiling point of the eluent and a sufficient column backpressure was applied to prevent the mobile phase from boiling by inserting a narrow <b>bore</b> <b>tubing</b> between the separation column and the detector. The narrow <b>bore</b> <b>tubing</b> also functions to cool the effluent down to the room temperature before it reaches the detector. Therefore, normal SEC detectors can be used without any modification.

Two solutions are commercially available: the hydrostatic CCC columns, also called centrifugal partition chromatographs (CPC), with disks of interconnected channels and rotary seals, and the hydrodynamic CCC columns with bobbins of coiled open tube and no rotary seals. It was demonstrated {{that the amount of}} liquid stationary phase retained by a coiled tube was higher with larger <b>bore</b> <b>tubing</b> than with small bore tubes. At constant column volume, small <b>bore</b> <b>tubing</b> will be longer producing more efficiency than larger bore tube that will better retain the liquid stationary phase. Since the resolution equation in CCC is depending on both column efficiency and stationary phase retention ratio, the influence of the tubing bore should be studied. This theoretical work showed that there is an optimum tubing bore size depending on solute partition coefficient and mobile phase flow rate. The interesting result of the theoretical study is that larger tubing bores allow for dramatically reduced experiment durations for all solutes: in reversed phase CCC (polar mobile phase), hydrophobic solutes are usually highly retained. These apolar solutes can be separated by the same coil at high flow rates and reduced Sf with similar retention times as polar solutes separated at smaller flow rates and much higher Sf...|$|E

Because of the low vapour pressure of water, even at 200 °C, the instrumentation required is simple and standard HPLC systems can be readily adapted by the addition of a high temperature oven and the creation of a pressure restrictor.

The research {{is motivated by}} the need to explore the inputs and mechanisms responsible for the creation of beneficial tribological coatings on medical grade silicone rubber tubing and how to quantify them. Despite the fact that biomedical conduits are routinely made lubricious by a host of different methods, there is an insufficiency in the present state of knowledge with regard to how to precisely quantify conduit bore lubricity. Test methods, newly invented, to characterize <b>tubing</b> <b>bore</b> lubricity are described in detail with greater emphasis on the extraction of coefficients of friction relative to historical testing methods. A new invention for characterizing the lubricity of biomedical conduits makes use of a pressure cuff or air-bladder to compress a plasma-treated silicone tubing sample onto a friction element. The instrument setup is a metal sliding-friction-element/silicone- tubing system. The tubing is stationary while the friction element that has been inserted into the <b>tubing</b> <b>bore</b> is pulled. The tubing is held in place with a known and regulated pressure, which allows the normal force pressing on the sliding component to be known. The pull force (tangential force) is registered and recorded using a commercial pull-test frame. Knowing the normal and tangential forces means that the coefficient of friction for the system can be extracted using this instrument. The running-in behavior observed during biomedical conduit friction assessment is quantified and a hypothesis regarding its source is set forth. The theme of the hypothesis is that material related to the constituents of silicone rubber is taken up by the friction element (coil, in this case) over several test cycles and thereby alters the system until it stabilizes. Subsequently, the coil becomes equilibrated with the chemical makeup of its environment, and this is why the resistance force stabilizes. The results of extensive experimentation showed that pristine coils displayed markedly more running-in phenomenon when compared to either an exercised coil or a stored-in-silicone tubing coil. The outcome of the thesis is a thorough understanding of <b>tubing</b> <b>bore</b> lubricity quantification...|$|R

Gradients formed by using two low pressure syringe pumps are stored in a length of narrow <b>bore</b> <b>tubing</b> (gradient loop) mounted on a standard high pressure switching valve. The preformed gradient is pushed through the column by using a high pressure syringe pump.

Advantages include gradient operation without the use of split flows, pressure programed flow control for rapid sample loading and recycling to initial conditions, and a flow rate range of 0. 1 – 20 μL/min, which is suitable for packed capillary columns 50 – 500 μm in diameter.

40|$|BACKGROUND Limited {{research}} on delivered FIO 2 for oxygen delivery devices makes choosing {{the most effective}} device for our patients difficult. This is particularly true when caring for patients in high levels of respiratory distress. Hypothesis: When a patient’s level of distress increases, the actual FIO 2 differs from the following published estimates: 0. 28 - 0. 36 on 2 - 4 LPM via nasal cannula, 0. 40 - 0. 60 on 6 - 10 LPM via simple mask, 0. 60 - 0. 80 + on 12 - 15 LPM via nonrebreather mask, 0. 80 - 1. 0 on 30 - 50 LPM via high flow nasal cannula and 0. 24 - 0. 90 on 1 - 15 LPM via OxyMaskTM. [1] METHODS A 2010 Hans Rudolph, Inc. Series 1101 Breathing Simulator was attached to a mannequin using large <b>bore</b> <b>tubing</b> and one way valves in order to simulate inhalation and exhalation. A new sensor {{was placed in a}} Hudson RCI galvanic fuel cell oxygen analyzer, calibrated to room air and 100 % oxygen, and used to measure FIO 2 in the trachea. The oxygen delivery devices were connected via small <b>bore</b> <b>tubing</b> to an H/K tank using a Thorpe tube to measure oxygen flow. The baseline values were as follows: RAW 3 cmH 2 O/L/sec, CST 60 mL/cmH 2 O, respiratory rate 20 br/min, percent inhale 20 %, load effort SHORTIE, and effort slope of 20. The manipulated variables were oxygen flow rate and level of distress. The oxygen flow rates tested were between 2 and 50 LPM. The level of distress was represented by PIFR (peak inspiratory flow rate) which was established by increasing amplitude to result in PIFR of 40, 70 and 90 LPM. With each oxygen flow rate and level of distress, a measurement was taken after the FIO 2 had stabilized for 60 seconds. RESULTS At a PIFR of 40 LPM, all devices performed at or above FIO 2 expectations {{with the exception of the}} OxyMaskTM. At a PIFR of 40 LPM and oxygen flow rates of 10 LPM or greater, the OxyMaskTM performed below the published FIO 2. Actual FIO 2 delivery for all devices was lower than published estimates when the PIFR was 90 LPM.

The carrier stream consists of an alkaline solution containing iodate and an excess of iodide: injections of acid and then of acidified sulphite are made. The decrease in the iodine signal (measured at 352 nm) {{in the presence of}} sulphite is proportional to the sulphite concentration in the injectate.

40|$|The {{development}} of methods capable of determining individual metal species at trace levels {{is a widely}} researched topic. The majority of the techniques developed for this purpose involve the use of “coupled” instrumental techniques to separate and detect metal species at low concentrations, also additional derivatisation steps are often required prior to detection. This approach requires lengthy analysis times and high manual input to construct and maintain the interface between the two instruments. Complicated sample preparation procedures are also necessary for tissue samples. These factors discourage the implementation of routine environmental monitoring of trace metal species. In {{the course of this}} study, alternative techniques for trace metal speciation are examined. The criteria for these techniques is that each should be straightforward in design and operation requiring a minimal level of manual input while remaining cost effective. The use of a solid phase extraction technique known as Matrix Solid Phase Dispersion (MSPD) is evaluated for extracting arsenic species from fish tissues. MSPD involves physically grinding up tissue samples with a quantity of chromatographic packing material and packing the resulting mixture into a column followed by selective elution of the analytes with mobile phase. The technique is developed and validated for five arsenic species. The effectiveness of this technique is then assessed by comparison with an existing liquid-liquid extraction protocol. The feasibility of capillary electrophoretic methods (CE) for routine trace metal speciation is examined for arsenic and methylated tin species respectively. This technique involves the separation of charged species in narrow <b>bore</b> capillary <b>tubing</b> under the influence of an electric field. CE offers the benefits of highly efficient separations, short analysis times, minimal sample preparation requirements and small reagent consumption. Problems with low sensitivity can be overcome with electrostacking and indirect detection methods which allows the technique to be extended to the area of trace metal analysis...|$|R
40|$|A {{petroleum}} {{production system}} is generally modelled {{based on the}} concept of nodal analysis, where the entire system is broken down into discrete elements such as near-well <b>bore,</b> <b>tubing,</b> surface choke and flow line. Operating flow rates and pressures can be estimated with a nodal analysis procedure by calculation of the intersection of performance curves. Input parameters in nodal analysis of production systems are considered deterministic, however, some of these parameters are better represented as distributions. In this report, the ensemble-based data assimilation methods “ensemble Kalman filter” (EnKF) and “particle filter” (PF) are applied to steady-state models of a production system for tuning of uncertain model parameters during the test separator phase. The performance of the EnKF and the PF is tested with the use of twin experiments. The calibrated model parameters of the choke, tubing and the near-well bore elements with EnKF and PF can be used to create an ensemble of performance curves leading to an ensemble of operating flow rates and pressures. The foreseen next step is to use the posterior distributions of model parameters as inputs for soft sensing of flow rates during semi-steady-state production for a single phase oil reservoir, where the oil rate and reservoir pressure are considered as unknown parameters. In the twin experiments as used in this thesis, a total number of three steady-state pressure drop measurements was used to estimate a total of six independent parameters which constitutes an ill-posed problem, resulting in non-unique parameter estimates. It is recommended to alleviate this issue by either reducing the number of parameters or by using multiple separator tests at different flow rates. Petroleum Engineerin...|$|E
40|$|Ultra-high-pressure liquid {{chromatography}} (UHPLC) using columns packed with sub- 2 μm particles has {{great potential for}} separations of many types of complex samples, including polymers. However, the application of UHPLC {{for the analysis of}} polymers meets some fundamental obstacles. Small particles and narrow <b>bore</b> <b>tubing</b> in combination with high pressures generate significant shear and extensional forces in UHPLC systems, which may affect polymer chains. At high stress conditions flexible macromolecules may become extended and eventually the chemical bonds in the molecules can break. Deformation and degradation of macromolecules will affect the peak retention and the peak shape in the chromatogram, which may cause errors in the obtained results (e. g. the calculated molecular-weight distributions). In the present work we explored the limitations of UHPLC for the analysis of polymers. Degradation and deformation of macromolecules were studied by collecting and re-injecting polymer peaks and by off-line two-dimensional {{liquid chromatography}}. Polystyrene standards with molecular weight of 4 MDa and larger were found to degrade at UHPLC conditions. However, for most polymers degradation could be avoided by using low linear velocities. No degradation of 3 -MDa PS (and smaller) was observed at linear velocities up to 7 mm/s. The column frits were implicated as the main sources of polymer degradation. The extent of degradation was found to depend on the type of the column and on the column history. At high flow rates degradation was observed without a column being installed. We demonstrated that polymer deformation preceded degradation. Stretched polymers eluted from the column in slalom chromatography mode (elution order opposite to that in SEC or HDC).

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The literature relevant to the generation of volatile hydrides for analytical atomic spectroscopy has been reviewed, with particular reference to atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS). This reveals some conflicting information concerning the nature of various interference effects and strategies to overcome them. The use of flow injection (FI) procedures has been demonstrated by several research groups, to be beneficial. A {{review of the literature}} concerning the application of FI techniques to AAS shows that there is a sustained interest in the use of such a combination for analytical purposes. In particular, an interest in the on-line coupling of chemical pretreatment of samples is evident. Atomic absorption spectrometry has a limited working range and requires frequent calibration, consequently, {{there is a need for}} a rapid, precise on-line dilution procedure. The potential of FI systems with wide <b>bore</b> manifold <b>tubing</b> for on-line dilution was assessed and found to be limited by variations in dispersion coefficient arising from differences in specific gravities between the sample and carrier fluids. This could be overcome only by the use of unrealistically high flow rates. The use of FI procedures for the generation of volatile hydrides of selenium and arsenic was investigated. Optimization studies of system parameters, including the atomization step, were undertaken which demonstrated the benefits in applying FI in hydride generation atomic absorption spectrometry (HGAAS). Analytical methods were devised and evaluated for the determination of Se in copper metal and As in nickel alloy. These procedures involved the use of an on-line matrix removal step in which potentially interfering matrix elements were retained on a strong cation exchange resin (Dowex 50 W). The manifold was designed so that the FI value acted as the interface between the matrix isolation stage and the vapour generation stage, a strategy which allowed independent optimization of each stage. Location of the ion exchange resin in the sample loop of a six-port rotary valve allowed the resin to be regenerated easily and rapidly, with a throughput capability of the order of 50 h⁻¹ and permit the proposed full automation of the whole analytical procedure. In the determination of As in nickel alloy a novel stopped-flow pre-reduction step was developed to permit AsIII quantification, therefore, achieve optimum sensitivity. The two systems permitted limits of detection for Se and As of 2. 1 and 3. 9 ng ml⁻¹ respectively. Direct comparisons were made with existing matrix isolation systems to emphasise the benefits of system design...|$|R
30|$|Wax {{deposition}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} challenging flow assurance issues in oil production processes. The related problems span from reservoirs to refineries, but their consequences can be particularly challenging when the affected area is difficult to reach, such as producing wells. The wax deposition in the areas adjoining the bore, the <b>bore</b> face, the <b>tubing</b> string and the pump is the result of the cooling effect, which occurs when the oil flows from the high-pressure reservoir into the wellbore to the surface. During the depressurization the oil expands, and the heat is drawn from the oil. The temperature loss induces crystallization of the wax and the subsequent plugging of the well. In this case, wax deposition leads to the decrease of well flow rates and eventually causes total blockage. This paper sums up the main technologies applied to prevent or remediate the wax deposition formed inside the wells. A comprehensive review was presented, and the main advantages and disadvantages of these techniques were highlighted. For instance, the mechanical removal is still a widely used technique for solving wax problems inside wells, despite being a costly procedure; heating is another frequent used technique, but it can cause formation damage; bacterial treatments still require further studies on site conditions; changing the operational conditions may be undesirable due to other management field circumstances; coating and insulating materials generally are not fully efficient, being required to implement complementary techniques; cold flow was only tested in pipelines and it was not applicable to wells; finally WIT, electric and magnetic field or oscillatory motion are practical applications that have not been fully proven yet.|$|R

Ten runs have been performed using the system of which six were predominantly commissioning runs.

Initially the fuel was pyrolysed, with the volatiles produced being combusted and providing the energy to drive the process, and then the char product was gasified by reaction with the pyrolysis gases. Normally, the gasifier is operated with reaction zone supported on a bed of char, although it has been operated for short periods without a char bed. At steady state the depth of char remains constant, but by adjusting the air inlet rate it has been shown that the depth of char can be increased or decreased.

40|$|This thesis was {{submitted}} for {{the degree of}} Doctor of Philosophy and awarded by Brunel University. Countercurrent chromatography (CCC) is an advanced liquid-liquid extraction technique that purifies chemical components from complex mixtures. The Brunel CCC' is a J-type centrifuge based upon this technique. This machine can process 5 g quantities of sample every 5 hours [Sutherland 1998]. To process 1 tonne of sample per year would require 200 Brunel CCCs, which is not practical as an industrial process. A practical alternative is to use one machine with 200 times the processing capability. To construct such a machine requires {{a greater understanding of}} the stationary phase retention inside a coil (column) and the column efficiency (mass transfer between the mobile and stationary phases). This thesis contains research into stationary phase retention. A hypothesis that all J-type centrifuges act as constant pressure drop pumps is proposed. This hypothesis combined with the Hagan-Poiseuille equation for laminar flow produces a theoretical basis for plotting the stationary phase retention against the square root of the mobile phase flow rate as proposed by Du et al [1999]. Supporting experimental evidence is presented showing that the mobile phase flows in a laminar manner and that the pressure drop across a coil is constant for a given set of operating conditions. It is shown that the pressure drop is the same in both normal and reverse phase modes if specific conditions are met. The pressure drop is shown to be independent of <b>tubing</b> <b>bore</b> for helical coils provided that the same helical pitch is used. The experimental results also show how the pressure drop varies with the phase system and rotational speed. Hopefully this is a significant advance in predicting the stationary phase retention of industrial scale J-type centrifuges...|$|R
