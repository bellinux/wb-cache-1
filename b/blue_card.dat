Silver and Gold members must re-qualify for the Elite tier to continue receiving Elite Status benefits. With the expiration of Elite status benefits, the member will use their <b>Blue</b> <b>card</b> to start earning tier-qualifying miles again. Miles expire after 3 years.|$|E
25|$|A ten-minute {{penalty is}} {{indicated}} {{through the use}} of a <b>blue</b> <b>card</b> and can be caused by protesting or behaving incorrectly, attacking an opponent violently or stopping the ball incorrectly to get an advantage.|$|E
25|$|A {{technical}} foul {{results in a}} <b>blue</b> <b>card</b> on a player where that player must substitute with another player of the same position. The substitution does not, however, result in a power play for the other team, and play is not stopped when this card is rendered. A play may accrue an unlimited number of {{technical foul}}s during a match.|$|E

25|$|When a <b>blue</b> <b>card</b> is issued, it is {{considered}} to be a non-stacking yellow card, and can either result in being sent back to hoops or spend one minute in the penalty box. When a yellow card is issued the player must sit in the penalty box for one minute. If the opposing team scores before the minute is up then the player will be allowed to return to the game. He or she is still considered off broom and must tag their teams hoops in order to resume play. If a player receives two yellow cards, then the card will become red. If a player receives a red card, that player must sit in the penalty box for two minutes.|$|E
25|$|Each merit badge has a {{pamphlet}} (booklet) {{published by the}} Boy Scouts of America associated with it; the pamphlet contains information on completing the requirements for the badge. Scouts must meet up with their Scoutmaster to receive a signed <b>blue</b> <b>card</b> in order to begin working on a merit badge. The Scout then contacts an adult who is registered as a counselor for that merit badge {{in order to learn}} which badge requirements they must complete before meeting up with the counselor. Once these requirements are completed, the Scout meets with the counselor to demonstrate that he's completed the requirements. The counselor then 'signs off' on each requirement. After completing the merit badge, the Scout can then buy his merit badge patch.|$|E
2500|$|Frisch was {{the first}} to {{demonstrate}} (in 1914) that honey bees had color vision, which he accomplished by using classical conditioning. [...] He trained bees to feed on a dish of sugar water set on a colored card. He then set the colored card {{in the middle of a}} set of gray-toned cards. If the bees see the colored card as a shade of gray, then they will confuse the <b>blue</b> <b>card</b> with at least one of the gray-toned cards; bees arriving to feed will visit more than one card in the array. On the other hand, if they have color vision, then the bees visit only the <b>blue</b> <b>card,</b> as it is visually distinct from the other cards. A bee’s color perception is comparable to that of humans, but with a shift away from the red toward the ultraviolet part of the spectrum. For that reason bees cannot distinguish red from black (colorless), but they can distinguish the colors white, yellow, blue and violet. Color pigments which reflect UV radiation expand the spectrum of colors which can be differentiated. For example, several blossoms which may appear to humans to be of the same yellow color will appear to bees as having different colors (multicolored patterns) because of their different proportions of ultraviolet.|$|E

When {{used on the}} dungeon grid map, <b>blue</b> <b>cards</b> increase the hunter's movement range for that round. If an E card is used, it will warp the hunter directly to the exit. When used in combat, they increase the hunter's ability to escape from battle for one round. If an E card is used in combat, it will result in definite success in escaping.|$|R

2500|$|President Demis Nikolaidis {{and several}} other {{managers}} and chairmen were angered with the court's decision, stating that the Hellenic Football Federation knew about the usage of the illegal player prior to the game and had indeed issued a registration (<b>blue</b> <b>card),</b> but didn't do anything about it. Panathinaikos also challenged the result at the Court of Arbitration in Sport (CAS) with no success, as the Hellenic Federation {{did not support the}} claim. Rivaldo had stated his intention to leave Greece if the ruling went in favour of Olympiakos and AEK were not declared champions. He stated, [...] "a team that was not good enough to win the title on the pitch does not deserve the trophy." ...|$|E

The program's elite levels are {{comparable}} to those of other airlines' frequent-flyer programs, requiring members to fly 30,000 miles per two-year cycle (initial entry into this level requires 50,000 miles). Qualification for the highest level is based on lifetime flight miles, requiring a customer to fly 1 million miles for Million Miler, which is the highest elite status; or 500,000 miles for Morning Calm Premium, which comes second. Both membership levels are eligible for SkyTeam Elite Plus privileges. Membership in these levels are granted for life.|$|E

6000|$|... "I am Inspector Ratcliffe," [...] he said, {{with a sort}} of haste that verged on harshness. [...] "My name {{is pretty}} well known to the police, and I can see well enough that you belong to them.

60|$|The alleged Pole was {{a little}} pale under his tangle of dark hair, but he put two fingers into the pocket with {{apparent}} coolness {{and pulled out a}} blue strip of card. When Syme saw it lying on the table, he woke up again to the world outside him. For although the card lay at the other extreme of the table, and he could read nothing of the inscription on it, it bore a startling resemblance to the <b>blue</b> <b>card</b> in his own pocket, the card which had been given to him when he joined the anti-anarchist constabulary.|$|E
5000|$|Established in Germany in 1934, The <b>Blue</b> <b>Card’s</b> {{sole purpose}} was to provide {{financial}} assistance to Jews fleeing from that country’s growing persecution.

[...] It was re-established in the United States in 1939, to continue aiding refugees escaping from the Holocaust. Today, it is the only organization in the United States whose sole mission is to aid needy Holocaust survivors by providing cash assistance.|$|R

[...] "But as you think policeman only a relative term, of course I {{have nothing to do}} with you. I am in the British police force; but as you tell me you are not in the British police force, I can only say that I met you in a dynamiters' club. I suppose I ought to arrest you." [...] And with these words he laid on the table before Syme an exact facsimile of the <b>blue</b> <b>card</b> which Syme had in his own waistcoat pocket, the symbol of his power from the police.|$|E
6000|$|CHARTERIS (turning to Craven and {{preparing}} {{to read the}} letter). Now for Julia. (The Colonel turns away to hide his face from Charteris, anticipating a shock, and {{puts his hand on}} a chair to steady himself.) [...] "My dearest boy. Nothing will make me believe that this odious woman can take my place in your heart. I send some of the letters you wrote me when we first met; and I ask you to read them. They will recall what you felt when you wrote them. You cannot have changed so much as to be indifferent to me: whoever may have struck your fancy for the moment, your heart is still mine"--and so on: you know the sort of thing--"Ever and always your loving Julia." [...] (The Colonel sinks on the chair and covers his face with his hand.) You don't suppose she's serious, do you: that's the sort of thing she writes me three times a day. (To Cuthbertson) Grace is in earnest though, confound it. (He holds out Grace's letter.) A <b>blue</b> <b>card</b> as usual! This time I shall not trust the waste paper basket. (He goes to the fire, and throws the letters into it.) ...|$|E
6000|$|Thus it {{was that}} when Gabriel Syme came out again into the crimson light of evening, in his shabby black hat and shabby, lawless cloak, he came out {{a member of the}} New Detective Corps for the {{frustration}} of the great conspiracy. Acting under the advice of his friend the policeman (who was professionally inclined to neatness), he trimmed his hair and beard, bought a good hat, clad himself in an exquisite summer suit of light blue-grey, with a pale yellow flower in the button-hole, and, in short, became that elegant and rather insupportable person whom Gregory had first encountered in the little garden of Saffron Park. Before he finally left the police premises his friend provided him with a small <b>blue</b> <b>card,</b> on which was written, [...] "The Last Crusade," [...] and a number, the sign of his official authority. He put this carefully in his upper waistcoat pocket, lit a cigarette, and went forth to track and fight the enemy in all the drawing-rooms of London. Where his adventure ultimately led him we have already seen. At about half-past one on a February night he found himself steaming in a small tug up the silent Thames, armed with swordstick and revolver, the duly elected Thursday of the Central Council of Anarchists.|$|E

6000|$|... "That is {{the rest}} of the story," [...] said the impersonator. [...] "When I myself left the company, {{followed}} by reverent applause, I went limping down the dark street, hoping that I should soon be far enough away {{to be able to walk}} like a human being. To my astonishment, as I was turning the corner, I felt a touch on the shoulder, and turning, found myself under the shadow of an enormous policeman. He told me I was wanted. I struck a sort of paralytic attitude, and cried in a high German accent, 'Yes, I am wanted--by the oppressed of the world. You are arresting me on the charge of being the great anarchist, Professor de Worms.' The policeman impassively consulted a paper in his hand, 'No, sir,' he said civilly, 'at least, not exactly, sir. I am arresting you on the charge of not being the celebrated anarchist, Professor de Worms.' This charge, if it was criminal at all, was certainly the lighter of the two, and I went along with the man, doubtful, but not greatly dismayed. I was shown into a number of rooms, and eventually into the presence of a police officer, who explained that a serious campaign had been opened against the centres of anarchy, and that this, my successful masquerade, might be of considerable value to the public safety. He offered me a good salary and this little <b>blue</b> <b>card.</b> Though our conversation was short, he struck me as a man of very massive common sense and humour; but I cannot tell you much about him personally, because--" ...|$|E
