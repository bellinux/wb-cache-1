25|$|<b>Blood</b> <b>substitutes</b> (also called {{artificial}} blood or blood surrogates) are artificial substances aiming {{to provide an}} alternative to blood-based products acquired from donors. The main <b>blood</b> <b>substitutes</b> used today are volume expanders such as crystalloids and colloids mentioned above. Also, oxygen-carrying substitutes are emerging.|$|E

25|$|A {{number of}} <b>blood</b> <b>substitutes</b> have been {{explored}} (and still are), but thus far they all suffer from many challenges. Most {{attempts to find}} a suitable alternative to blood thus far have concentrated on cell-free hemoglobin solutions. <b>Blood</b> <b>substitutes</b> could make transfusions more readily available in emergency medicine and in pre-hospital EMS care. If successful, such a blood substitute could save many lives, particularly in trauma where massive blood loss results. Hemopure, a hemoglobin-based therapy, is approved for use in South Africa.|$|E

25|$|<b>Blood</b> <b>substitutes</b> such as hemoglobin-based oxygen {{carriers}} are in development; however, as of 2013 {{there are none}} available for commercial use in North America or Europe. These products are only available for general use in South Africa and Russia.|$|E
25|$|Thus far, {{there are}} no {{available}} oxygen-carrying <b>blood</b> <b>substitutes,</b> which is the typical objective of a blood (RBC) transfusion; however, there are widely available non-blood volume expanders for cases where only volume restoration is required. These are helping doctors and surgeons avoid the risks of disease transmission and immune suppression, address the chronic blood donor shortage, and address the concerns of Jehovah's Witnesses {{and others who have}} religious objections to receiving transfused blood.|$|E
25|$|A {{large number}} of {{pharmaceuticals}} contain halogens, especially fluorine. An estimated one fifth of pharmaceuticals contain fluorine, including several {{of the most widely}} used drugs. Examples include 5-fluorouracil, fluoxetine (Prozac), paroxetine (Paxil), ciprofloxacin (Cipro), mefloquine, and fluconazole. The beneficial effects arise because the C-F bond is relatively unreactive. Fluorine-substituted ethers are volatile anesthetics, including the commercial products methoxyflurane, enflurane, isoflurane, sevoflurane and desflurane. Fluorocarbon anesthetics reduce the hazard of flammability with diethyl ether and cyclopropane. Perfluorinated alkanes are used as <b>blood</b> <b>substitutes.</b>|$|E

50|$|The {{functions}} of blood are many. Normally, for example, {{white blood cells}} defend against disease, platelets allow clotting, and blood proteins perform various functions. In addition, the blood composition includes additional molecules and electrolytes to function properly. Some of these components are substitutable with modern technology, and may, at least, be added to an oxygen-carrying <b>blood</b> <b>substitute</b> {{to create a more}} complete <b>blood</b> <b>substitute.</b>|$|R

2500|$|Much {{research}} {{has been devoted to}} overcoming hypoxia including the use of high pressure oxygen tanks, hyperthermia therapy (heat therapy which dilates blood vessels to the tumor site), <b>blood</b> <b>substitutes</b> that carry increased oxygen, hypoxic cell radiosensitizer drugs such as misonidazole and metronidazole, and hypoxic cytotoxins (tissue poisons), such as tirapazamine. [...] Newer research approaches are currently being studied, including preclinical and clinical investigations into the use of an oxygen diffusion-enhancing compound such as trans sodium crocetinate (TSC) as a [...] radiosensitizer.|$|E
2500|$|Fluorinated {{compounds}} often display distinct solubility properties. [...] Dichlorodifluoromethane and chlorodifluoromethane {{were widely}} used refrigerants. CFCs have potent {{ozone depletion potential}} due to the homolytic cleavage of the carbon-chlorine bonds; their use is largely prohibited by the Montreal Protocol. Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), such as tetrafluoroethane, serve as CFC replacements {{because they do not}} catalyze ozone depletion. [...] Oxygen exhibits a high solubility in perfluorocarbon compounds, reflecting again on their lipophilicity. [...] Perfluorodecalin has been demonstrated as a <b>blood</b> <b>substitutes,</b> transporting oxygen to the lungs.|$|E
2500|$|The carbon-fluorine bond is {{commonly}} found in pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals because it is generally metabolically stable and fluorine acts as a bioisostere of the hydrogen atom. [...] An estimated one fifth of pharmaceuticals contain fluorine, including several of the top drugs. Examples include 5-fluorouracil, flunitrazepam (Rohypnol), fluoxetine (Prozac), paroxetine (Paxil), ciprofloxacin (Cipro), mefloquine, and fluconazole. [...] Fluorine-substituted ethers are volatile anesthetics, including the commercial products methoxyflurane, enflurane, isoflurane, sevoflurane and desflurane.

5000|$|The idea {{to use a}} <b>blood</b> <b>substitute</b> is old as well {{as human}} {{intention}} to resuscitate a life with transfusion of real blood. In the past, many but often obscure trials were conducted. One recommendation from Sir Christopher Wren (17th century) who suggested wine and opium as <b>blood</b> <b>substitute</b> [...] At {{the beginning of the}} 20th century, the development of modern transfusion medicine initiated through the excellent work of Landsteiner and co-authors opened the possibility to understanding the general principle of blood group serology. [...] Simultaneously, significant progress was made in the fields of heart and circulation physiology {{as well as in the}} understanding of the mechanism of oxygen transport and tissue oxygenation. These two points paved the way for blood transfusion to become a standard part of medical treatment. Complexity of blood compatibility, lack of suitable anticoagulants and insufficient storage methods combined with a disproportion between demand and availability implicated just in early phase of transfusion medicine needs to find one universal <b>blood</b> <b>substitute.</b> The term [...] "blood substitute" [...] is a misnomer. Under the term <b>blood</b> <b>substitute,</b> we understand in first line the substitution of a) facility of red blood cells e.g. haemoglobin as oxygen carriers and b) volume substitution. More accurately the term means [...] "red-cell substitutes" [...] or solutions of [...] "haemoglobin or non-haemoglobin based oxygen carriers".|$|R

50|$|Perfluoromethyldecalin is a {{fluorocarbon}} liquid - a perfluorinated {{derivative of}} the hydrocarbon methyldecalin. It is chemically and biologically inert. It is mainly of interest as a <b>blood</b> <b>substitute,</b> exploiting the high solubility of air in this solvent.|$|R

5000|$|When {{used as an}} {{intravenous}} emulsion, Oxycyte {{can carry}} as much as five times more oxygen than hemoglobin, making it {{an effective means of}} transporting oxygen to tissues and carrying carbon dioxide to the lungs for disposal.

50|$|Blood {{products}} {{may also}} be called blood-based products to differ from <b>blood</b> <b>substitutes,</b> which generally refer to artificially produced products. Also, although many blood products {{have the effect of}} volume expansion, the group is usually distinguished from volume expanders, which generally refer to artificially produced substances and are thereby within the scope of <b>blood</b> <b>substitutes.</b>|$|E

50|$|An oxygen-carrying blood substitute, {{sometimes}} called artificial haemoglobin, is an artificially made {{red blood cell}} substitute whose main function is to carry oxygen, as does natural hemoglobin. The use of oxygen-carrying <b>blood</b> <b>substitutes</b> is often called oxygen therapeutics to differentiate from true <b>blood</b> <b>substitutes.</b> The initial goal of oxygen carrying <b>blood</b> <b>substitutes</b> is merely to mimic blood's oxygen transport capacity. There is additional longer range research on true artificial red and white blood cells which could theoretically compose a blood substitute with higher fidelity to human blood. Unfortunately, oxygen transport, one function that distinguishes real blood from other volume expanders, has been very difficult to reproduce.|$|E
50|$|Placental {{umbilical}} cord blood: Cord blood collected asceptically from the placenta {{after the birth}} of a healthy baby can be used safely as a <b>blood</b> <b>substitute.</b> It has a higher haemoglobin content and growth factors than normal blood from an adult, which has the potential to benefit patients in varying diseases.|$|R
40|$|Editor's Highlight: The {{development}} of hemoglobin-based oxygen carriers (HBOCs) {{as a replacement}} for whole-blood transfusions has been impeded by their systemic toxicity.

40|$|Completely noninvasive {{monitoring}} of hemoglobin concentration {{has not yet}} been fully realized in the clinical setting. This study investigates the viability of measuring hemoglobin concentration noninvasively by evaluating the performance of two types of sensor using a tissue phantom perfused with a <b>blood</b> <b>substitute.</b> An electrical sensor designed to measure blood volume changes during the cardiac cycle was used together with an infrared optical sensor for detection of erythrocyte-bound hemoglobin. Both sensors demonstrated sensitivity to changes in pulse volume (plethysmography). The electrical sensor produced a signal referred to as capacitance plethysmograph (CPG) a quantity which was invariant to the concentration of an infrared absorbing dye present in the <b>blood</b> <b>substitute.</b> The optical sensor signal (photoplethysmograph) increased in amplitude with increasing absorber concentration. The ratio PPG:CPG is invariant to pulse pressure. This quantity is discussed as a possible index of in vivo hemoglobin concentration...|$|R
