The freeway runs eastward through {{residential}} neighborhoods on the city's west side as it approaches the interchange with US131. This complex structure is {{adjacent to the}} Grand River north of the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Museum. The carriageways for I-196 run through the interchange on different levels, with the eastbound traffic carried down near river level and the westbound lanes above the criss-crossing carriageways of US131's freeway. I-196 crosses the river {{on the opposite side}} of the interchange and both directions return to the same level. The freeway picks up an additional lane at this point as the median is replaced by a concrete barrier.|$|E
5|$|MD 410 {{follows the}} {{northern}} edge of the town of Chevy Chase and crosses Coquellin Run, then follows the southern edge of Columbia Country Club to its intersection with MD 185 (Connecticut Avenue). The highway leaves the town of Chevy Chase and passes through an unincorporated area of Chevy Chase, within which the highway meets the northern end of MD 186 (Brookville Road) and descends into the valley of Rock Creek. At the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hill,</b> MD 410 intersects Jones Mill Road and Beach Drive, the main road through Rock Creek Park. The state highway crosses Rock Creek, passes to the north of Meadowbrook Park and leaves the valley as a four-lane road with narrow median and flanking service roads. MD 410 reaches {{the top of the hill}} at Grubb Road and descends into the valley of a branch of Rock Creek. The highway becomes undivided at Sundale Drive and crosses the stream just west of the northern corner of the District of Columbia and its attendant boundary marker, then leaves the stream valley and ascends to an intersection with MD 390 (16th Street) at the western edge of downtown Silver Spring.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} Channon reached the two platoons, they were {{crossing}} over two small hills {{just north of}} Kantongyon. As they crossed {{over one of the}} hills, Channon and his radio operator were wounded by Chinese mortar rounds. Channon took the radio from Walker, who was now incapacitated, and joined the two platoons at the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hill.</b> Channon then called Jess Tidwell for instructions, who responded, “move out when the tanks move out.” Two tanks had passed through a gap in the hills and were in front of them. Soon, the two tanks moved out at high speed to join their company {{in the center of the}} valley. As the Rangers started to move forward, toward the nose of a ridge from which the fire was coming about 700-800 yards ahead, they began taking casualties from machine gun and rifle fire. About 100 yards out from the ridge, they received a heavy mortar barrage, resulting in a number of them being wounded. Channon also received a couple of burp gun rounds to his lower left leg. Shortly after, a couple of light tanks arrived. Pete Hamilton (1st Plt Ldr) and Channon crawled up on the tanks, bore-sighted the guns on the machine guns and blew them away. About 30 yards out from a Chinese trench at the base of the ridge nose, they received a heavy volley of grenades. Abandoning protocol (once you start a charge, you are not supposed to hit the ground), Channon, knowing that he’d have no trouble getting his Rangers up again, had them hit the ground. When they got up, the Rangers took the ridge nose in a bayonet and grenade fight. When their position was secure, Platoon Sergeant Barber reported that they only had eight Rangers capable of continuing on. Pete Hamilton had been too seriously wounded to continue.|$|E

25|$|Birutė Hill is {{the highest}} dune at the seaside resort of Palanga on the Baltic Seashore, and now {{a part of the}} Palanga Botanical Garden. Archaeological {{research}} shows that there was a village at the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> in the 10th century. In the 13th century, when the Teutonic Knights and Livonian Order invaded, the villagers built a defense system with a tower. After an initial defeat, the system was rebuilt and made even stronger; it now had two towers and a wall surrounded the top of the hill. However, when this was burned {{in the second half of}} the 14th century, a pagan shrine and observatory was built in its place instead.|$|E
25|$|On {{the hill}} to the east of Grenadier Pond, {{extending}} up to Colborne Lodge Road, is a landscaped ornamental garden area.

25|$|After another {{crossing}} {{under the}} railway, the river skirts {{the eastern edge}} of Bramford and circles a hill, on top of which is Sproughton Manor, a grade II listed house built for Col Henry Phillipps in 1863 by the architect William Eden Nesfield. Sproughton Lock and mill are at the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hill.</b> The mill is built in red brick and dates from the late eighteenth century. The mill race passes below the mill, which was operational until 1947, but all the machinery has been removed. Parts of the adjacent mill house date from around 1600. After passing under the A14 road, the river briefly heads north-east, through Chantry Cut, where Chantry Lock is situated, to pass under the railway. There are two bridges, as the railway line forks {{on the south side of}} the river. A flood barrier has been installed below the first bridge. Now passing through Ipswich, the river also forks, with the eastern branch being the River Gipping, and the western branch forming the start of the River Orwell. A modern sluice is located on the Orwell just below the junction. A final weir marks the position of Handford Sea Lock, below which the two channels rejoin. An outfall is situated below the junction, beyond which the river is tidal.|$|E
25|$|Grosjean {{stopped on}} track near a fire marshal with smoke bellowing from his engine on lap 65 {{and became the}} race's second (and final) retirement. Hülkenberg passed Magnussen for eighth on lap 68, while Räikkönen lost {{traction}} in his tyres at the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> heading towards the Senna cichane, allowing teammate Alonso to pass him for sixth on the same lap. Hamilton pressured Rosberg and reduced the time deficit to his teammate to be 0.8 seconds behind {{at the start of}} the 71st (and final) lap, but Hamilton was unable to get close enough to affect an overtaking manoeuvre and Rosberg crossed the start/finish line first to win the race. Massa finished third, with Button in fourth and Vettel fifth. Alonso took sixth ahead of teammate Räikkönen, Hülkenberg was eighth, and Magnussen secured ninth. Bottas fended off an challenge from Kvyat in the final laps to secure the final points-scoring position of tenth. Maldonado, Vergne, Gutiérrez, Pérez and Sutil were the last of the classified finishers. It was Rosberg's fifth victory of the season, his first in Brazil, and the eighth of his career. Mercedes's one-two finish was their eleventh of the season, braking the previous record held by McLaren since 1988 with Alain Prost and Ayrton Senna. It was also the team's 15th victory of the year, equalling the record jointly held by McLaren and Ferrari. There were seven lead changes in the race: three drivers reached the front of the field. Rosberg led four times for a total of 59 laps, more than any other driver.|$|E
25|$|PFC. Jose Ramon Sanchez born in Brooklyn, NY was {{assigned}} to Company D, 1st Battalion, 4th Marines, 3rd Marine Division. On June 6, 1968, he was {{among a group of}} fellow Marines who comprised a patrol operating in the rugged jungle covered mountains southwest of Khe Sanh, Quảng Trị Province, South Vietnam. Their mission was to block NVA troops and supplies from infiltrating toward Khe Sanh. The Marines engaged a communist force of unknown size in heavy combat. As the fierce firefight raged around them, the Marines, who were out numbered and rapidly running low on ammunition, requested an emergency extraction. A CH46A Sea Knight helicopter was sent for Sanchez {{and the rest of the}} patrol who were on Hill 672. As the helicopter gained altitude, it was immediately struck by intense and accurate enemy ground fire causing it to enter into a nose-low attitude and crash onto an east/west mountain ridgeline, roll down to the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> and burst into flames. Within an hour and a half, a search and recovery (SAR) team was inserted into the crash site. The team members pulled the charred bodies of the aircrew and passengers from what was left of the burned out helicopter and placed them in body bags. Of the 12 of the 23 Marines aboard who were killed, 4 were reported as MIA/KIA, besides Sanchez the other three were L/Cpl. LaPlant, L/Cpl. Palacios and L/Cpl. Harper. Various attempts to recover the bodies of the four were made to no avail.|$|E

From about 18 to 25 March the retreating winter had a last fling, with vicious rainstorms, snow almost page 241 to <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hills,</b> and freezing cold; but this ended very quickly, and by <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> month the sun was out again and the valley warming up with <b>the</b> advance <b>of</b> spring. <b>The</b> oranges ripened and were a pleasant variation in the rations, succeeded by apricots as the weeks wore on.|$|R
50|$|On February 11, {{three days}} before his planned date of attack, San Martín called a war council to decide on a plan. Their main goal {{was to take the}} Chacabuco Ranch, the royalist headquarters, at <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hills.</b> He decided to split his 2,000 troops into two parts, sending them down two roads on either side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mountain. The right {{contingent}} was led by Miguel Estanislao Soler, and the left by O’Higgins. The plan was for Soler to attack their flanks, {{while at the same time}} surrounding their rear guard in order to prevent their retreat. San Martín expected that both leaders would attack at the same time, so the royalists would have to fight a battle on two fronts.|$|R
