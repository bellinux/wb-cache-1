5|$|Hamilton {{crossed the}} line to win his second race of the season, with Rosberg {{following}} him home in 2nd and Vettel completing the podium with 3rd. Pastor Maldonado had an eventful race. On lap 33, while running in seventh position ahead of teammate Romain Grosjean, he missed the pit entry and lost time, dropping several positions. He then proceeded to spin his car on lap 39 as he attempted {{to make up for}} lost time, and on lap 48 he had a collision with Jenson Button following a long battle for position, damaging his car and retiring with rear <b>brake</b> <b>failure</b> a few laps later. The stewards later deemed Button to be at fault for the incident.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{completion}} of design work, KnAAPO constructed the first prototype, which was finished in mid-2007. The prototype, Su-35-1, was then transferred to the Gromov Flight Research Institute at Zhukovsky Airfield, in preparation for its maiden flight. On 19 February 2008, Sergey Bogdan took the aircraft aloft for its 55-minute first flight from Zhukovsky, accompanied by an Su-30MK2 acting as a chase plane. Bogdan later piloted the second prototype on its maiden flight on 2 October from KnAAPO's Dzyomgi Airport. The flight-test programme was expected to involve three flying prototypes, but on 26 April 2009, a day before its scheduled maiden flight, the fourth Su-35 (there's a static test aircraft) crashed during a taxi run at Dzyomgi Airport. The aircraft struck a barrier {{at the end of}} the runway and was destroyed by fire; the pilot ejected and sustained burn injuries. A commission was opened to investigate the crash, but several sources initially speculated that the incident had been the result of a <b>brake</b> <b>failure</b> or a faulty fuel pump.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} year, 1960, was a {{bad year}} for the carrier's air group, with four Sea Venoms and two Gannets damaged in separate incidents aboard Melbourne. All four Sea Venom incidents occurred in March, with three attributed to aircrew error and one to <b>brake</b> <b>failure.</b> The year began with exercises en route to Adelaide, followed by {{a visit to the}} Royal Hobart Regatta. The carrier's Strategic Reserve deployment ran from April to June, and was followed by manoeuvres along the east coast of Australia until September. In the lead up to Melbournes 1961 deployment to the Strategic Reserve, the carrier visited Bombay, Karachi, and Trincomalee. It was the first time a flagship of the RAN had entered Indian waters. Melbourne returned to Australia in June, and on 15 June led several ships in a ceremonial entry to Sydney Harbour to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the RAN. In August, Melbourne was called upon to lead Exercise Tuckerbox, in the Coral Sea. Following the conclusion of Tuckerbox, the carrier visited several New Zealand ports before returning to Sydney for demonstration exercises and public relations activities.|$|E

25|$|By 1 February 2007, 38 three-car {{sets were}} {{withdrawn}} due to continuing <b>braking</b> <b>failures,</b> meaning that {{almost half of}} the Siemens Nexas fleet (or around 10% of the total fleet) was out of revenue service. Amidst the media reporting an escalating problem with the risk of the entire fleet potentially having to be suspended, Siemens issued a statement on 31 January 2008 saying that they believed there had been no evidence during investigations of the <b>braking</b> <b>failures</b> that would require the entire fleet of trains to be withdrawn from service. Testing of affected trains was carried out on the Werribee line between Newport and Laverton, with soapy water sprayed onto the rails {{to increase the amount of}} wheel slip experienced, in an effort to replicate the brake fault. The entire fleet has now re-entered service, although with a restriction not to run single unit (3 car) operations.|$|R
5|$|Graves, {{who fell}} to second in class, went into Rivage's gravel trap with a left-front <b>brake</b> <b>failure,</b> {{causing him to}} retire. Toyota retired their No. 6 entry from the race because of an engine failure caused by an {{electrical}} fault. Smoke bellowed from the rear-end of Nakajima's Toyota upon leaving La Source and he {{went back into the}} pit lane where his mechanics worked on rectifying the problem allowing Oliver Jarvis in the No. 8 Audi to inherit the lead. Webber drove straight at the Bus Stop chicane, spun, and drove into the pit lane. Stefan Mücke, who was affected by turbocharger issues, lost control of the No. 66 Ford after one of his rear tyres was punctured, and narrowly avoided going airborne. The vehicle made heavy contact with the left-hand side barriers at Raidillon, heavily damaging the front-end and removing both of its doors, as well as littering debris onto the circuit. His car stopped in the centre of the track, causing the No. 2 Porsche to swerve to avoid hitting the vehicle, and the safety car was deployed to allow marshals to repair the heavily damaged tyre barrier. Drivers were instructed to steer onto the right-hand side of the track at Eau Rouge because the stranded car blocked the turn. Mücke was transported to the track's medical centre and later taken to the local hospital for a precautionary check-up because of bruising.|$|E
5|$|Ferrari's {{strategy}} for {{staying in the}} championship battle saw them introduce upgrades to the F2012 at every remaining race in the season, starting with an extensive revision for the Indian Grand Prix, but whatever advantage they offered was still not enough for Fernando Alonso to catch Sebastian Vettel. Vettel dominated the weekend, setting the fastest time in every practice session before qualifying on pole, and leading every lap of the sixty-lap race, though he was denied his third Grand Chelem when Jenson Button set the fastest lap of the race on the final lap. Fernando Alonso finished second, conceding another seven championship points to Vettel. The Ferrari driver rounded up both McLaren drivers {{at the start of}} the race and proceeded to chase down Mark Webber for second, only overtaking the Australian on the long back straight when his car developed a KERS fault fifteen laps from the end that it never recovered from. Webber held off a late challenge from Lewis Hamilton to complete the podium. Further down the order, Kimi Räikkönen finished seventh after spending most of the race trapped behind Felipe Massa, and later claimed that mistakes on Saturday had robbed him of a podium on Sunday, while Pedro de la Rosa retired from the race when he suffered a <b>brake</b> <b>failure</b> that saw him spin into the barriers at Turn 4. The race was marked by a series of explosive punctures after cars made light contact with one another; Michael Schumacher's right-rear tyre deflated on the first lap when he made contact with Jean-Éric Vergne at the first corner; Sergio Pérez suffered a puncture under similar circumstances when he glanced Daniel Ricciardo's front wing, with the loose rubber damaging the floor of Pérez's car enough that he was forced into retirement; and Pastor Maldonado also had a tyre punctured when he and Kamui Kobayashi touched at speed on the approach to Turn 5, forcing the Venezuelan to run wide onto the tarmac run-off, but suffering no lasting damage.|$|E
5|$|The race saw two drivers {{out before}} the start lights even went out, as first Sebastian Vettel stopped on track during the warm-up lap with an engine failure before Jolyon Palmer pulled into the pit lane instead of lining up on the grid, {{suffering}} from a hydraulic failure. It {{was the first time}} in Vettel's career that he was unable to start a race. At the start, Rosberg pulled into the lead ahead of Hamilton, who came into contact with Valtteri Bottas and dropped back to ninth place. Both Bottas and Ricciardo damaged their front wings in the situation. Felipe Massa took advantage and moved into second behind Rosberg. Further back, Sergio Pérez and Carlos Sainz also made contact, leaving Sainz with a puncture and Pérez with front wing damaged and both had to pit for repairs. Daniil Kvyat and Nico Hülkenberg were two more victims of contact during the first lap. The order after five laps was Rosberg, Massa, Bottas, Ricciardo and Räikkönen, who took fourth a lap later. The same lap, Jenson Button retired with a failure of his energy recovery system. After yet another lap, Räikkönen moved ahead of Bottas as well into third. Hamilton recovered from his first-turn accident and soon moved ahead of Bottas as well, laying in fourth place on lap eight. On lap ten, Bottas received a drive-through penalty for his collision with Hamilton at the start. By lap eleven, Esteban Gutiérrez retired with <b>brake</b> <b>failure,</b> while his teammate Grosjean was in fourth place.|$|E

25|$|During braking, the {{friction}} surfaces (brake pads and rims) will experience thermal heating. In normal use {{this is not}} a problem, as the brakes are applied with limited force and for a short time, so the heat quickly dissipates to the surrounding air. However, on a heavily laden bike on a long descent, heat energy may be added more quickly than it can dissipate causing heat build-up, which may damage components and cause <b>brake</b> <b>failure.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Heat {{build-up}} {{can lead}} to <b>failure</b> with disc <b>brakes.</b> Disc brakes heat discs {{in the same way}} as rim brakes heat rims, but discs provide an inherently smaller surface to dissipate heat. Excessive heat leads to boiling hydraulic fluid, resulting in brake fade or total failure. Overheating is more common in road cycling assuming the brakes are undersized to reduce weight. Recorded cases of disc <b>brake</b> <b>failures</b> [...] usually involves several kilometers of downhill, combined with small underweight discs.|$|R
50|$|But {{the steep}} {{slope of the}} Rue de Belleville caused the more {{spectacular}} accidents. The greatest was on 6 January 1906, when a ruptured grip resulted in a runaway car. It continued the whole length of the Rue de Belleville, crossing the Rue des Pyrénées at nearly 120 km/h (according to the press reports) before being derailed and overturning in the Rue du Faubourg-du-Temple. The passengers panicked and ran, causing 17 injuries. In 1907 and 1909, <b>brake</b> <b>failures</b> caused two collisions between the tramcars and Mekarski system cars at the Rue des Pyrénées crossroads.|$|R
