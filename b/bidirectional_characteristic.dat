40|$|In {{order to}} match the {{voltages}} between high voltage battery stacks and low voltage super-capacitors with a high conversion efficiency in hybrid energy sources electric vehicles (HESEVs), a high ratio bidirectional DC-DC converter with a synchronous rectification H-Bridge is proposed in this paper. The principles of high ratio step down and step-up operations are analyzed. In terms of the <b>bidirectional</b> <b>characteristic</b> of the H-Bridge, the bidirectional synchronous rectification (SR) operation is presented without any extra hardware. Then the SR power switches can achieve zero voltage switching (ZVS) turn-on and turn-off during dead time, and the power conversion efficiency is improved {{compared to that of}} the diode rectification (DR) operation, as well as the utilization of power switches. Experimental results show that the proposed converter can operate bidirectionally in the wide ratio range of 3 ~ 10, when the low voltage continuously varies between 15 V and 50 V. The maximum efficiencies are 94. 1 % in the Buck mode, and 93. 6 % in the Boost mode. In addition, the corresponding largest efficiency variations between SR and DR operations are 4. 8 % and 3. 4 %. This converter is suitable for use as a power interface between the battery stacks and super-capacitors in HESEVs...|$|E
30|$|The above {{relevant}} researches {{revealed the}} excellent thermal performance of heat pipe BTMSs mainly {{based on the}} cooling effect at constant charge/discharge rate with different arrangements. As known, various heat transfer phenomena occur within a heat pipe, including transient conduction, phase change and fluid dynamics during cooling/heating with batteries’ charging/discharging, which {{makes it difficult to}} obtain the full and real temperature variation characteristics in such complex heat transfer processes through theoretical analysis and calculation, especially using small sized heat pipes and/or under real driving conditions. In this case, for optimizing a BTMS, it is crucial to investigate in depth the experimental dynamic thermal performance for more accurate thermal analysis and design. So far, battery preheating through BTMS can be only found in limited researches [30, 31]. Recently, Wang et al. [32] provided a full experimental characterization forcing both cooling and heating of an “L” type heat pipe (flat on evaporator and tube on condenser) BTMS with liquid heat transfer on the condensers under “off-normal” operating conditions. Moreover, considering the miniaturization and compaction of the cooling/heating device to meet the requirements on optimal structure and arrangement in EVs, the advantage of heat pipes’ <b>bidirectional</b> <b>characteristic</b> should be fully utilized for a well-design and high-efficient heat pipe BTMS to provide not only good cooling effect at high temperatures but also excellent preheating performance under low temperatures. In this paper, we explored the using of UMHP for both cooling and heating of a Li-ion battery pack in EVs. The experiments under different operation conditions are carried out to characterize the cooling/heating effects of the proposed UMHP BTMS. The main contributions of this work are developing such a small sized heat pipe and presenting its application to a BTMS with both cooling and heating, and then the experimental temperature characteristics of UMHPs can be performed to guide thermal analysis and optimization of heat pipe BTMSs.|$|E

Here, we have {{investigated}} both the sensory coding properties and antidromic discharges that occur during real walking in the freely behaving crayfish. The activity of the sensory nerve innervating the proprioceptor CBCO, a chordotonal organ that monitors both angular movement and position of the coxo-basipodite (CB) joint, which is implicated in vertical leg movements, was recorded chronically along with the electromyographic activity of the muscles that control CB joint movements. Two wire electrodes placed on the sensory nerve were used to discriminate orthodromic from antidromic action potentials and thus allowed for analysis of both sensory coding and antidromic discharges. A distinction is proposed between 3 main classes of sensory neuron, according to their firing in relation to levator muscle activity during free walking. In parallel, we describe 2 types of antidromic activity: one produced exclusively during motor activity and a second produced both during {{and in the absence of}} motor activity. A negative correlation was found between the activity of sensory neurons in each of the 3 classes and identified antidromic discharges during walking.

40|$|The use of Variable Length Codes (VLC) to {{increase}} the coding efficiency based on the statistical characteristics of the data has long been employed in digital communication systems. However the catastrophic degradation of VLC encoded data which results from bit errors {{has led to the}} development of reversible variable length codes (RVLC) that can be decoded bidirectionally thereby having more efficient error resilient capabilities. Up to this point, no soft decoding algorithm for RVLC has been devised that effectively exploit the <b>bidirectional</b> <b>characteristics</b> of such codes. This paper introduces a novel decoding algorithm for reversible variable length codes that make use of the Massey metric while limiting the complexity of a purely unidirectional sequential decoder. and sequential decoding among others [6, 8 - 11]. Each of these methods has its respective pros and cons. Though some papers introduced RVLC decoding methods that could be employed in applications such as the MPEG- 4 standard [12], no paper concretely showed how soft-values could be employed with RVLC. The methods proposed by J. Webb ensured memory efficient partitioning of the code table that results in quicker access. Albeit the direct application of these algorithms to the decoding of RVLC (which is a subset of VLC) is possible, so doing would decrease performance as well as adding unwanted increase in complexity at the decoder side.

Video-enhanced, polarized light, and {{differential interference contrast}} microscopy have demonstrated the presence of positively birefringent fibrils within these lamellipodia. The fibrils correspond to the microtubules and bundles of microtubules observed in whole-mount transmission electron micrographs of lamellipodia. Microtubular fibrils exhibit two types of movements within the lamellipodia: lateral and axial translocations. Lateral movements are often accompanied by reversible lateral associations between adjacent fibrils within a lamellipodium. This lateral association-dissociation of adjacent fibrils has been termed 'zipping' and 'unzipping'. Axial translocations are bidirectional. The axial movements of the microtubular fibrils can result in the extension of filopodia by pushing against the plasma membrane of the lamellipodia.

40|$|We {{report the}} growth and {{characterization}} of gadolinium oxide films deposited on Si(100) and fused quartz in the temperature range of 450 – 800 °C by a low-pressure metalorganic chemical vapor deposition technique using a β-diketonate complex of gadolinium as the precursor. The x-ray diffractometry study of the films reveals that, irrespective of the growth temperature, the films grown on fused quartz (i. e., an amorphous substrate) and silicon (i. e., a single-crystal substrate) comprise the cubic Gd_ 2 O_ 3 phase with a (111) texture. However, the films grown on fused quartz at higher temperatures also show {{the presence of the}} monoclinic phase of Gd_ 2 O_ 3. The growth of strongly oriented films on fused quartz has been understood on the basis of minimization of the surface energy. The scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy studies reveal that the films grown at or above 525 °C are densely packed and grainy. Optical properties of the films, as studied by ultraviolet (UV) -visible spectrophotometry and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, are found to depend strongly on the chemical vapor deposition condition. The analyses reveal further that the films grown at or above 500 °C are free of heteroatoms, i. e., C, N, and H. The optical band gap of the films is in the range of 5. 0 – 5. 4 eV. Electrical characterization was carried out on Al/Gd_ 2 O_ 3 /Si metal-insulator-semiconductor structures by capacitance–voltage (C–V) and current–voltage analyses. The effective dielectric constant of the films was in the range of 7 – 23. The <b>bidirectional</b> C–V <b>characteristics</b> show a counterclockwise hysteresis due to the presence of slow interface traps. A minimum leakage current of 4. 6 X 10 ^- 5 A/cm^ 2 at the 1 -MV / cm field was demonstrated...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—A {{significant}} obstacle {{for service}} robots is the execu-tion of complex tasks in real environments. For example, {{it is not}} easy for service robots to find objects that are partially observable and are located at a place which is not identical but near the place where the robots saw them previously. To overcome the challenge effectively, robot knowledge represented as a semantic network can be extremely useful. This paper presents an ontology-based unified robot knowledge framework that integrates low-level data with high-level knowledge for robot intelligence. This frame-work consists of two sections: knowledge description and knowl-edge association. Knowledge description includes comprehensively integrated robot knowledge derived from low-level knowledge regarding perceptual features, part objects, metric maps, and primitive behaviors, as well as high-level knowledge about percep-tual concepts, objects, semantic maps, tasks, and contexts. Knowl-edge association uses logical inference with both unidirectional and <b>bidirectional</b> rules. This <b>characteristic</b> enables reasoning to be performed even when only a partial information is available. The experimental results that demonstrate the advantages of using the proposed knowledge framework are also presented.
