5|$|The prepatellar bursa and the {{olecranon}} bursa {{are the two}} bursae {{that are}} most likely to become infected, or septic. Septic bursitis typically occurs when the trauma to the knee causes an abrasion, though it is also possible for the infection to <b>be</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> bacteria traveling through the blood from a pre-existing infection site. In approximately 80% of septic cases, the infection is caused by Staphylococcus aureus; other common infections are Streptococcus, Mycobacterium, and Brucella. It is highly unusual for septic bursitis to <b>be</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> anaerobes, fungi, or Gram-negative bacteria. In very rare cases, the infection can <b>be</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> tuberculosis.|$|E
5|$|Gene flow is the {{exchange}} of genes between populations and between species. It can therefore {{be a source of}} variation that is new to a population or to a species. Gene flow can <b>be</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> the movement of individuals between separate populations of organisms, as might <b>be</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> the movement of mice between inland and coastal populations, or the movement of pollen between heavy metal tolerant and heavy metal sensitive populations of grasses.|$|E

5|$|Catastrophic injuries—defined {{as serious}} {{injury to the}} spine, spinal cord, or brain—and {{fatalities}} are uncommon in football; both have become less common since the 1970s, although {{a small number of}} them still occur each year.

Despite the decrease in catastrophic injuries, a greater number of NFL players have reported major injuries and shortened careers since the 1970s, in part due to the increasing size and speed of players and the use of artificial turf.|$|E
