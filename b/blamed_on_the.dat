5|$|A play, The Doom Bar, about {{smuggling}} and wrecking {{was written}} in the early 1900s by Arthur Hansen Bush. Although there was no interest in London it was well received in America, and was scheduled to tour in Chicago and New York.

This was reduced to four trains a day in March 2009. These services ceased in January 2011 after passenger number reduced; the closure was <b>blamed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Great Recession.|$|E
5|$|John's counter-offensive stalled at {{the siege}} of Wesenberg in 1574, when German and Scottish units of the Swedish army turned against each other.

The war in Livonia was a great financial burden for Sweden, {{and by the end}} of 1573, Sweden's German mercenaries were owed 200,000 daler. John gave them the castles of Hapsal, Leal and Lode as security, but when he failed to pay they were sold to Denmark.|$|E
5|$|Overall, almost 36,000residences {{were damaged}} {{as a result}} of Catarina's onslaught; of those, 993 {{collapsed}} completely. The commercial sector fared slightly better, as only 2,274buildings were damaged and 472 collapsed. Finally, 397public buildings were damaged and three were destroyed. These account for 26% of the total buildings in the region, and property damage of $25.6million (2004 USD $ USD). Four-fifths of the damaged houses had some sort of roof failure or collapse. Most of the damage was <b>blamed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> low quality of the construction; brick residences typically lacked plaster, beams, or columns, for example. The areas affected the most were those inhabited by low-income families, usually with annual family salaries of less than $400USD.|$|E

5|$|The Great Stink was {{an event}} in central London in July and August 1858 during which the hot weather {{exacerbated}} the smell of untreated human waste and industrial effluent that was present {{on the banks of}} the River Thames. The problem had been mounting for some years, with an ageing and inadequate sewer system that emptied directly into the Thames. The miasma from the effluent was thought to transmit contagious diseases, and three outbreaks of cholera prior to the Great Stink were <b>blamed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ongoing problems with the river.|$|E
5|$|The {{destruction}} of Robinson's Arch {{occurred during the}} events surrounding the Roman sacking of Jerusalem in 70CE. It has traditionally been <b>blamed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Roman legions which destroyed the Temple Mount enclosure and eventually {{set fire to the}} entire city. More recently, this has been attributed to the Zealot factions which had wrested control of the Temple Mount and fortified it prior to its fall. Some of these continued to hold out in Jerusalem's Upper City for a month after the city had been breached by the Romans. By wrecking the overpass, as well as the viaduct at Wilson's Arch to the north, the defenders made access to the Temple platform much more difficult for besieging forces.|$|E
5|$|The {{series was}} {{originally}} written in six parts, but Davies excised {{a large portion}} of the fifth episode because the crew expressed concerns with its pacing. The series was filmed in late 2003 under the direction of Sheree Folkson and Tim Whitby, and utilised many areas of Swansea that Davies was familiar with since his childhood. It aired as four-hour-long episodes and a ninety-minute finale on Thursday nights preceding Christmas 2003. Eventually, Mine All Mine would be his least successful series and ended its run with just over two million viewers, which he later <b>blamed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> series' high eccentricity.|$|E

5|$|Although the country's {{reliance}} on foreign workers {{has been a}} concern to the Saudi government since the mid-1950s, the situation has persisted because of a reluctance by Saudis to take on menial work and a shortage of Saudi candidates for skilled jobs. This has, in part, been <b>blamed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Saudi education system, which {{has been criticized for}} its emphasis on religion and rote learning. The Saudi economy has, therefore, remained dependent on Westerners for expertise in specialised industries and on the Asian workforce for the construction industry as well as for menial and unskilled tasks. In response, since 1995 the Saudi government has initiated a policy of Saudization, replacing foreign workers with Saudi nationals. For example, in 2000, it was decreed that the work force of businesses with more than 20 employees must be at least 25 per cent Saudi. In the private sector, there has been a reluctance to employ Saudis and Saudization is generally considered to have been a failure. Saudis themselves may be unwilling to take certain jobs, considering them to lack social value.|$|E
5|$|Eduardo Alberto Duhalde {{was born}} in Lomas de Zamora, in the Greater Buenos Aires. He {{graduated}} as a lawyer in 1970. He {{was elected to the}} city legislature the next year, and presided over it. He joined the Justicialist Party (PJ), and soon became leader of its local branch. He was elected to the local legislature of Lomas de Zamora, and appointed its president. The legislature impeached the mayor Ricardo Ortiz, as well as Pedro Turner, who was appointed mayor afterwards. This was part of a political reorganization promoted by President Juan Perón. Duhalde was appointed mayor in 1973 as a result. Many members of the Peronist Youth were killed in Lomas de Zamora during the Pasco massacre, which Duhalde <b>blamed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Argentine Anticommunist Alliance. He was ousted from office during the 1976 Argentine coup d'état. He worked as a real estate broker during the following years.|$|E

The official communist party newspaper Pravda said that poor construction, like other issues of neglect in the Soviet system, could be <b>blamed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Era of Stagnation from the era of Leonid Brezhnev.|$|E
