5|$|In 1895 and 1897, Cantor {{published}} a two-part paper in Mathematische Annalen under Felix Klein's editorship; these were his last significant papers on set theory. The first paper begins by defining set, subset, etc., {{in ways that}} would be largely acceptable now. The cardinal and ordinal arithmetic are reviewed. Cantor wanted the second paper to include a proof of the continuum hypothesis, but had to settle for expositing his theory of well-ordered sets and ordinal numbers. Cantor attempts to prove that if A and B are sets with A equivalent to a subset of B and B equivalent to a subset of A, then A and B are equivalent. Ernst Schröder had stated this theorem a <b>bit</b> <b>earlier,</b> but his proof, as well as Cantor's, was flawed. Felix Bernstein supplied a correct proof in his 1898 PhD thesis; hence the name Cantor–Bernstein–Schröder theorem.|$|E

The Acolouthia of the Holy and Great Saturday and hence the Epitaphios {{procession}} (see below), started according to ancient customs during the Saturday Matins (Orthros), but nowadays, it frequently begins a <b>bit</b> <b>earlier,</b> at the night of Holy and Great Friday.|$|E
25|$|It is {{not known}} what {{happened}} with both MojmírII and SvatoplukII {{because they are not}} mentioned in written sources after 906. In three battles (4–5 July and 9 August 907) near Bratislava, the Magyars routed Bavarian armies. Some historians put this year as the date of the break-up of the Great Moravian Empire, due to the Hungarian conquest; other historians take the date a little <b>bit</b> <b>earlier</b> (to 902).|$|E

25|$|Fiber-tempered {{ceramics}} {{associated with}} shell middens left by Late Archaic hunter-fisher-gatherers {{appeared in the}} Atlantic coastal plain of Florida, Georgia and South Carolina starting in 2500 BC. The earliest attested pottery is in the Stallings culture area, around the middle Savannah River. Fiber-tempered pottery of the Orange culture in northeast Florida has been dated to 2000 BC or a <b>bit</b> <b>earlier.</b> Fiber-tempered pottery of very similar form spread along coasts and river valleys of the Southeastern United States from the Atlantic coast into Alabama, reaching northwestern Florida (Norwood culture) and the Gulf coast by 1300 BC, the interior Middle South by 1100, and Poverty Point by 1000 BC.|$|E
25|$|Production was reinitiated in the {{evacuated}} workshops of Factory No. 82 by Factory No. 500 in June 1942, thirty-two engines being completed {{during the}} year. Development of supercharged versions began {{about the same}} time, using geared, centrifugal type superchargers adapted from the Mikulin AM-38 and the Klimov M-105 engines with intercoolers. That from the AM-38 was more successful and was put into production as the M-30B. Thirty-five incomplete M-30 engines were modified beginning in August into M-30Bs and then thirty-four M-30Bs were produced {{during the rest of}} 1942. Oddly the ACh-30B, as the engine was now known, was not formally accepted for series production until 19 June 1943, but production had begun quite a <b>bit</b> <b>earlier</b> than that. Factory No. 45 began production {{in the fourth quarter of}} 1943. Some 1450 ACh-30Bs were built before production ended at both factories in September 1945.|$|E

There was endless pressures to extend them,". He continued saying the pressure to retain such incentives had come from developers, owners of sites, areas {{that did not have}} the developments, community councils, politicians and civic society.|$|E

2500|$|Probably she {{was born}} near Palanga to a Samogitian or Curonian magnate family. The story of her {{marriage}} to Kęstutis became a romantic legend in Lithuania. Chronicles mention that Birutė was a priestess (...) and served the Pagan gods by guarding the sacred fire. When Kęstutis heard of her beauty, he visited the shire {{and asked her to}} marry him. She refused because she had promised the gods to guard her virginity until her death. Kęstutis then took her by force to Trakai and threw a big wedding. She and Kęstutis had three sons and three daughters. Vytautas, their first son, was born around 1350. This suggests that the marriage took place in 1349 or a <b>bit</b> <b>earlier.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In 1984, Vainio {{started his}} season by {{finishing}} third at the Rotterdam Marathon {{with a personal}} record of 2:13:04. After the race he gave a doping sample in the test organized by the Finnish Athletics Association. The test did not have official status and was merely {{considered to be a}} control test to help avoid Finnish athletes getting caught at the tests performed in international championships. Therefore, only the so-called A-sample was taken and not the B-sample, which is used to ensure the test result after a positive A-sample. However, Vainio's A-sample was tested positive for anabolic steroids, and the head coach of the Finnish Athletics Federation, Antti Lanamäki, delegated Timo Vuorimaa, the head coach of long-distance runners, to inform Vainio about the test result. Vuorimaa informed Vainio only by mentioning that there was something strange in his test sample, not providing detailed information about the substance. Vainio believed that he had only been using [...] testosterone and not anabolic steroids at all. Therefore, his only action was to give up drug use a little <b>bit</b> <b>earlier</b> prior to the anticipated tests.|$|E
2500|$|The Saka {{people were}} known as the Sai (塞, sāi, sək in Old Sinitic) in ancient Chinese records. These records {{indicate}} that they originally inhabited the Ili and Chu River valleys of modern Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan. [...] In the Chinese Book of Han, the area was called the [...] "land of the Sai", i.e. the Saka. [...] According to the Sima Qian's Shiji, the Indo-European Yuezhi, originally from the area between Tängri Tagh (Tian Shan) and Dunhuang of Gansu, China, were assaulted and forced to flee from the Hexi Corridor of Gansu by the Mongolic forces of the Xiongnu ruler Modu Chanyu in 177-176 BC. In turn the Yuezhi were responsible for attacking and pushing the Sai (i.e. Saka) south. [...] The Saka crossed the Syr Darya into Bactria around 140 B.C. Later the Saka would also moved into Northern India, {{as well as other}} Tarim Basin sites like Khotan, Yanqi (焉耆, Karasahr), Shache (莎車, Yarkand) and Qiuci (龜茲, Kucha). [...] One suggestion is that that the Saka become Hellenized in the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom, and they or an ethnically-mixed Greco-Scythians either migrated to Yarkand and Khotan, or a <b>bit</b> <b>earlier</b> from Taxila [...] in the Indo-Greek Kingdom.|$|E

Lest I mislead, StreetArt is also an engaging art book, surveying a graphically oriented style heavy on collage and future shock or nostalgia schlock imagery." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{format is}} derived {{directly}} from {{the design of the}} teletypewriter, which was designed this way because the electromechanical technology of its day was not precise enough for synchronous operation: thus the systems needed to be re-synchronized at the start of each character. Having been re-synchronized, the technology of the day was good enough to preserve bit-sync {{for the remainder of the}} character. The stop bits gave the system time to recover before the next start <b>bit.</b> <b>Early</b> teleprinter systems used five data bits, typically with some variant of the Baudot code.|$|R
