2500|$|Only {{weeks before}} the Vironia was due to enter service on her new route, Estonia sank in a storm killing 852 people. The <b>bow</b> <b>visor</b> {{construction}} of Estonia, which caused her sinking, was of the same type {{as that of the}} Vironia. As a result of the disaster, the Vironia was renamed Mare Balticum to avoid association with the sunken ship due to the similar name ("Viro" [...] means [...] "Estonia" [...] in Finnish). She was docked and rebuilt in Naantali and her <b>bow</b> <b>visor</b> was welded shut. She eventually entered service on Stockholm-Tallinn on November 11, 1994.|$|E
2500|$|The Diana IIs large {{car deck}} on deck 4 {{was during the}} 1980s deemed to be larger than {{necessary}} and of its port side was rebuilt with additional cabins. In preparations of her entry into EstLine service in 1994, the ship received its most extensive modification to date. Apart from the sealing of the <b>bow</b> <b>visor</b> a [...] "duck tail" [...] was added at the stern. Also, the ship's funnel was once again rebuilt to sport a more solid look. The bow remained inaccessible until its complete rebuilding prior to the ships entry into the Tallinn—Helsinki service in 1996.|$|E
50|$|There {{have been}} several {{recorded}} incidents in which <b>bow</b> <b>visors</b> have partially opened whilst the ship is in motion, resulting in the some ships having to put in to have their visor locking mechanisms strengthened.|$|R
50|$|A trip aboard Chi-Cheemaun {{is a long}} {{standing}} Great Lakes tradition {{dating back to the}} 1930s when a small, wooden vessel, Kagawong, first ferried automobiles across the Georgian Bay between Tobermory and South Baymouth. It features a drive-on, drive-off bow and stern loading and unloading through a <b>visored</b> <b>bow</b> system and a square door stern section. The ship is 111 m with a 19 m beam and has capacity for 648 passengers and 143 vehicles, including room for large highway vehicles such as buses and transport trucks.|$|R
50|$|The {{car deck}} {{featured}} two lanes {{either side of}} the central casing and featured two hoistable mezzanine decks for additional car capacity. Car deck access was via a two piece <b>bow</b> ramp and <b>visor,</b> with a single piece stern ramp. The superstructure featured a main mast above the wheel house carrying the radar scanners and aerials, and a main mast aft incorporated into the forward edge of the funnel, cleverly concealing the main engine exhausts. Her original single lounge bar saloon was soon divided with a screen to cordon off different areas. The cafeteria and servery was situated aft of the saloon and in common with vessels of the time, she was fitted out with a number of sleeping berths allowing passengers to embark the night before an early departure. Early in her Caledonian MacBrayne career, she was fitted with stabilisers, improving stability. Suilven was the first vessel in the Caledonian MacBrayne fleet to carry the fleet branding on the hull side in large steel letters, welded to the hull side. Air conditioning was fitted for her service in Fiji.|$|R
2500|$|The wreck was {{examined}} and videotaped by remotely operated underwater vehicles and by divers from a Norwegian company, Rockwater A/S, contracted {{for the investigation}} work. The official report indicated that the locks on the bow door had failed from the strain of the waves and the door had separated {{from the rest of}} the vessel, pulling the ramp behind it ajar. The <b>bow</b> <b>visor</b> and ramp had been torn off at points that would not trigger an [...] "open" [...] or [...] "unlatched" [...] warning on the bridge, as is the case in normal operation or failure of the latches. The bridge was also situated too far back on the ferry for the visor to be seen from there. While there was video monitoring of the inner ramp, the monitor on the bridge was not visible from the conning station. The <b>bow</b> <b>visor</b> was under-designed, as manufacturing and approval process did not consider the visor and its attachments as critical items regarding ship safety. The first metallic bang was believed to have been the sound of the visor's lower locking mechanism failing, and subsequent noises were the visor 'flapping' against the hull as the other locks failed, before tearing free and exposing the bow ramp. The subsequent failure of the bow ramp allowed water into the vehicle deck, which was identified as the main cause of the capsizing and sinking: RORO ferries with their wide vehicle decks are particularly vulnerable to capsizing if the car deck is even slightly flooded because of free surface effect: the fluid's swirling motion across such a large area hampers the boat's ability to right itself after rolling with a wave.|$|E

50|$|A <b>bow</b> <b>visor</b> is {{a feature}} of some ships, in {{particular}} ferries and Roll-on/roll-off ships, that allows the bow to articulate up and down, providing access to the cargo ramp and storage deck near the water line. In modern ferry design over the last 25 years, though, bow visors {{have given way to}} clam doors that act like a clamshell and are believed to be safer than <b>bow</b> <b>visor</b> doors.|$|E
5000|$|During {{her days}} as the Manx Viking, she {{served on the}} Heysham-Douglas service of Sealink-Manx Line. Her maximum speed was 18 kn, with a draught of 5 m, and a {{metacentric}} height of around 2 m, giving excellent stability and seakeeping qualities. She was licensed for 777 passengers and {{at this stage of}} her life was quoted as [...] During Canadian service this figure was stated as , while a 1984 Sealink press release quotes [...] " [...] a weight of 3,589.43 tonnes". The ship was the first RORO ferry on Manx routes, and the first there to carry both freight and passenger traffic being suitable for cars, commercial trucks and trailers. She was fitted with numerous motorcycle stands to allow for Isle of Man TT and Manx Grand Prix traffic. As built, the ship had cranes for self-loading of containers onto the afterdeck; these were unused by Manx Line. Manx Line added a <b>bow</b> door and <b>visor,</b> along with extra lifeboats; becoming the only passenger ship in Manx waters with lifeboat accommodation for all aboard. She was also the first ferry in Manx waters to have inside accommodation for all passengers. At the time her 450 tonne fuel capacity gave her the longest range of any ferry in British waters: she was theoretically capable of travelling from Heysham to Port Stanley in the Falkland Islands without refuelling. She was considered for Falklands duty, but not used.|$|R

50|$|A roll-on, {{roll-off}} {{design with}} a <b>bow</b> <b>visor,</b> Caribou had 2 vehicle decks and 5 decks above, the {{main passenger deck}} being Deck 5. She measured 179 metres in overall length and 25 metres in breadth, weighing 27,212 tons. Her capacity included 1,200 passengers and 370 automobiles or 77 tractor trailers. She had up to 106 crewmembers.|$|E
50|$|Equipment failure {{caused the}} {{shipwreck}} of cruiseferry Estonia in 1994. The stress of stormy seas on hull and bow especially caused the <b>bow</b> <b>visor</b> to break off, in turn tearing the watertight bow {{door open and}} letting seawater flow onto the car deck. She capsized with tragic consequences. Failure of pumps {{can lead to the}} loss of a potentially salvageable ship with only a minor leak or fire.|$|E
50|$|The totally {{enclosed}} car deck {{has room for}} up to 70 cars. Headroom on the bow and stern ramps is 4.7 metres. She {{is equipped with a}} <b>bow</b> <b>visor,</b> bow ramp and stern ramp. The two-part folding bow ramp is shaped like an inverted ‘L’. When raised, the main section plugs the access to the car deck. The forward section folds out flat upon contact with the linkspan.|$|E
50|$|MV Ionas {{car deck}} could take {{vehicles}} up to 16.5 {{feet in height}} and 32-ton in weight. She had a <b>bow</b> <b>visor,</b> a stern-and side-ramps with a hoist that could handle 27.5 tons. Traffic for the hoist was marshalled by automatic barriers. Her bow-visor, raised by a racking system, rather than a hinge, was not watertight, limiting her passenger-carrying capacity later in her career. The bow-ramp was in several sections, which coiled back into the vehicle deck, reducing available car spaces.|$|E
50|$|In a <b>bow</b> <b>visor</b> door, {{the forces}} {{acting on the}} door from {{the impact of the}} waves are absorbed by the hinges and locks which may fail. With clam doors, the forces of the waves are absorbed by the {{surrounding}} bow superstructure. Furthermore, on seagoing vessels there should be inner bow doors or 'collision bulkhead doors' in place behind the loading ramp. These doors are an upper extension of the collision bulkhead and act as a secondary barrier against water entering the car deck, should the primary bow door(s) fail.|$|E
50|$|On {{one such}} return journey from Jeddah, {{carrying}} hundreds of Egyptian pilgrims, she sank after colliding with Hyndman Reefs on the Egyptian coast {{in the early}} hours of 17 December 1991. The impact holed the bows and forced open the <b>bow</b> <b>visor.</b> The ship very quickly took on water and sank, on her starboard side within minutes. Loss of life was considerable, with the official figure being quoted as 470. Rumour suggests that there were many more on board, however this is debatable as official records list the number of passengers and crew as 690.|$|E
5000|$|Entering {{service in}} 1989, she {{was built by}} MIL Davie Incorporated in Lauzon, Quebec, and is {{specifically}} designed for the 520 km seasonal route across the Cabot Strait between North Sydney, Nova Scotia and Argentia, Newfoundland and Labrador.

50|$|Of drive-through design, Isle of Arran has an {{open plan}} car deck with space for 76 cars in five lanes. She is {{fitted with a}} <b>bow</b> <b>visor</b> and bow and stern ramps. The open stern allows her to carry tankers and other large {{vehicles}} {{at the same time}} as passengers. There is insufficient height for lorries and coaches down either side of the car deck due to a gallery deck. From the car deck one must go outside to access the passenger accommodation. On Deck 3 there is a sheltered seating area, access to car deck and passenger lounges and a luggage area. There was originally a TV lounge with a children's room, but these were taken away in 2009 to boost crew accommodation.|$|E

The car deck is accessed by bow and stern ramps, the latter being offset from {{the centre of the}} ship to accommodate the linkspan in Ullapool. The bow ramp is a folding design that is watertight and further protected by a conventional upward hinging <b>bow</b> <b>visor.</b> The bow ramp was originally off-set to suit Stornoway's original linkspan until new facilities opened in April 1997. During an overhaul at Greenock in 2016, the bow ramp was changed to be off-set to port in order to prepare her for her new role as the summer Barra ferry, to make berthing in Oban easier.|$|E

The <b>bow</b> <b>visor</b> is clearly open by about 12-16 inches at the base, closest to the waterline. The sea floor, 29 meters deep, is littered with debris. Notably, two ridged life boats rest between the smoke stacks and the stern. At the stern of the ship, divers can enter the large car door. The wreck still contains cars and luggage.|$|E
50|$|MV Hebridean Isles design {{incorporates}} a <b>bow</b> <b>visor,</b> {{bow and stern}} ramps, and a vehicle hoist with side ramps. This made her suitable for all the routes served by the large fleet units. Her spacious car deck can accommodate almost 70 cars, with passenger accommodation on two decks forward of the hoist. One deck comprises the cafeteria furthest aft, then the entrance concourse, shop and information point, with the reclining lounge and bar towards the bow. The bar was converted to a Coffee Cabin in December 2008. Above the cafeteria is the observation lounge with crew accommodation forward of this. The bridge is on the next level at the bow. Externally there is ample deck space including, like the Isle of Arran, a deck area forward of the bridge, giving passengers a view ahead.|$|E

"How in the hell nobody has thought of this earlier. " These are often the first comments of the new locking mechanism for gates and hatches, invented by Mauno Lahtinen, an entrepreneur in machine building, and Paavo Holttä, an economist. The story began from a great disaster. The passenger vessel ESTONIA capsized on 28 September 1994 in the Baltic Sea. Total 852 lives were lost. The failure of the <b>bow</b> <b>visor</b> caused the disaster. A <b>bow</b> <b>visor</b> is a gate in the head of a ferry. It reminds the visor in the helmet of a motorcyclist...|$|E
40|$|In September 1994 the RO-RO Ferry Estonia sank of {{the coast}} of Finland, with the tragic loss of over 900 {{passengers}} and crew. The preliminary results of the official inquiry showed that the ferry sank because the <b>bow</b> <b>visor</b> was knocked loose {{by the force of}} the waves. This allowed the car deck to flood, resulting in the capsize and sinking of the ship. During the course of a project to modernize an existing ferry, the Institute for Marine Dynamics and Marine Atlantic carried out a series of model experiments to determine the wave induced loads on the <b>bow</b> <b>visor.</b> The model was rested for a range of speeds, significant wave heights and directions, to determine the maximum load likely to occur in operating conditions. Measured loads were correlated with measure motions and these relationships together with strip theory calculations were used to determine if the data set could be expanded beyond the region where physical experiments were carried out. This paper presents the results of the model experiments, giving measured values for ship motions and <b>bow</b> <b>visor</b> loads, together with the predictions from strip theory. It also compares the measure loads with those predicted from the International Association of Classification Societies (IACS). The results show that the IACS predictions compare well with the measured data for vertical and longitudinal loads in waves up to 6 metres significant height. They also show the the IACS formula over-predicts lateral loads for the wave conditions and ship speeds tested. Peer reviewed: NoNRC publication: Ye...|$|E
40|$|Field {{testing of}} a {{modified}} Totally Enclosed Motor Propelled Survival Craft (TEMPSC) {{was conducted in}} March 2013 in managed level ice conditions. This testing {{was part of a}} multi-year trials program, conducted by the National Research Council (NRC), which aims to investigate design considerations for a conventional TEMPSC operating in ice. During the March 2013 testing campaign, the TEMPSC was equipped with a side impact panel and <b>bow</b> <b>visor,</b> both instrumented with load cells to measure local ice impact forces. The resulting local ice load measurements taken during this field trials campaign are presented and the operational performance is discussed. This was the first year during the trials campaign in which local loads on the stem were measured and recorded. The results of this set of field trials could be useful to support the implementation of new TEMPSC design considerations to allow for better performance in harsh, northern conditions. It could also provide operational insight to promote more effective and low stress navigation through ice conditions. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|E
