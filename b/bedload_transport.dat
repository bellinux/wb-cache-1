40|$|Global {{trends of}} {{increasing}} urbanization have led many researchers {{to attempt to}} quantify the resulting impacts on channel morphology and on the ecological health of urban channels. Overall, {{there has been a}} lack of research on the effectiveness of stormwater management facilities in reducing the potential for <b>bedload</b> sediment <b>transport</b> within the channel. This study aimed to characterize the impact of stormwater management facilities on <b>bedload</b> sediment <b>transport</b> potential within a particular urban stream. A field study was undertaken along Morningside Creek, a tributary of the Rouge River in Toronto, Ontario. A tracer study using 300 stones with radio frequency identification tags was undertaken over a two year period, tracking the positions of the stones after major storm events. A hydrologic model was then prepared for the catchment area, detailing the stormwater management features. A critical shear stress of 0. 043 was determined for the threshold of particle mobilization, using a hiding factor to account for the increase in shear stress in the displacement of larger particles. The travel distances of the tagged particles were shown to follow a non-linear decreasing function with particle size. A variety of hydrometrics were measured based on the high resolution water level measurements taken within the creek. The cumulative excess shear stress was used as the basis for determining bedload sediment potential within the creek. A model of <b>bedload</b> sediment <b>transport</b> was developed by modifying the excess shear stress relationship first proposed by DeVries (2000). The hydrologic model was used to compare a variety of stormwater management scenarios to determine their effectiveness in reducing the potential for sediment transport within the creek. It was determined that the detention ponds in the Morningside Creek catchment provide a 33 % reduction in <b>bedload</b> sediment <b>transport</b> potential. Analysis of the hydrologic model revealed that increases in imperviousness lead to a proportionate increase in <b>bedload</b> sediment <b>transport.</b> The hydrologic model also determined that for storms of a similar return period, longer storm durations generate larger <b>bedload</b> sediment <b>transport</b> potential...|$|R

50|$|Sedimentation is the {{tendency}} for particles in suspension to settle out of the fluid {{in which they are}} entrained and come to rest against a barrier. This is due to their motion through the fluid in response to the forces acting on them: these forces can be due to gravity, centrifugal acceleration, or electromagnetism. In geology, sedimentation is often used as the opposite of erosion, i.e., the terminal end of sediment transport. In that sense, it includes the termination of transport by saltation or true <b>bedload</b> <b>transport.</b> Settling is the falling of suspended particles through the liquid, whereas sedimentation is the termination of the settling process. In estuarine environments, settling can be influenced by {{the presence or absence of}} vegetation. Trees such as mangroves are crucial to the attenuation of waves or currents, promoting the settlement of suspended particles.|$|E

That is, the surface layer displayed at low flow is coarser than both the substrate and mean annual <b>bedload</b> <b>transported.</b> The surface layer {{is difficult to}} sample at the high flows that transport most of the gravel. As a result, {{the question as to}} whether the surface layer remains armored at high flows is something of a mystery. The few measurements available suggest that some form of armoring may be in place at high flows as well. In lieu of more measurements, numerical modeling provides an avenue to explore this issue. Research is presented on 1 D modeling of aggradation and degradation to mobile-bed equilibrium in gravel-bed streams. In the model, a hydrograph is cycled repeatedly so that water discharge goes up and down in time. The magnitude of the bedload feed rate and the size distribution of the feed material are, however, held constant at the upstream end of the reach.

40|$|<b>Bedload</b> <b>transport</b> is a {{fundamental}} process for alluvial rivers, creating bedform topography that both stabilizes the channel and provides a diversity of habitat for aquatic organisms. <b>Bedload</b> <b>transport</b> also controls the storage and mobilization of heavy minerals and contaminants, and is {{an important aspect of}} channel migration that both revitalizes river floodplains and can threaten human infrastructure within river valleys. Numerous equations have been developed to predict <b>bedload</b> <b>transport,</b> ranging from simple regressions to complex multi-parameter formulations. For the practicing hydrologist or geomorphologist it is often unclear which transport equation is best suited for a given situation, or which equation is most likely to generate the most accurate results. A possible solution is to use a variety of <b>bedload</b> <b>transport</b> equations at a given location and average the results. Unfortunately, the predicted transport rates often differ by orders of magnitude, giving little confidence in the averaged transport rate. In addition, local conditions are often very different from those that many <b>bedload</b> <b>transport</b> equations were developed from. A number of {{attempts have been made to}} quantify the performance of existing <b>bedload</b> <b>transport</b> equations (Gomez and Church 1989; Yang and Huang 2001). However, the ability to test equation performance within coarsegrained mountain streams has, until recently, been hampered by a lack of <b>bedload</b> <b>transport</b> data for these stream types.

40|$|A 1 : 50 scale {{hydraulic}} model was designed based on Froude Number similarity using hydrological and sediment {{data from a}} braided gravel-bed river (the North Branch of the Ashburton River, Canterbury, New Zealand). An experimental programme was devised to investigate firstly, the relationships between discharge-slope product and <b>bedload</b> <b>transport</b> rate under steady and varying discharges; and secondly, the changes in <b>bedload</b> <b>transport</b> rate resulting from flow abstractions. Seven experiments using steady flow conditions were conducted (with six different discharge-slope combinations), and eleven experiments using unsteady flow conditions were also conducted (with five different discharge-slope combinations). The experiments were carried out in a 20 m x 3 m tilting flume equipped with a sediment feed device and an automated data acquisition and control system. In all experiments water at 30 °c was used to reduce viscosity-related scale effects. Braided stream development was in some experiments found to be limited by the 3 m flume width; however, using available data from the narrower reaches of the North Branch of the Ashburton River, it was shown that good hydraulic similarity was achieved. Analyses of the experimental results revealed that <b>bedload</b> <b>transport</b> rates in braided channels are highly variable, with relative variability being inversely related to mean <b>bedload</b> <b>transport</b> rate. Variability was also found to be cyclic with short-term variations being caused by the migration of bedforms. Assessments of two <b>bedload</b> <b>transport</b> prediction rate equations were made: the Schoklitsch (1962) equation and the Bagnold (1980) equation. It was concluded that the Schoklitsch (1962) equation {{is unlikely to be}} useful for braided gravel-bed rivers, however the Bagnold (1980) equation was found to be very reliable, with the experimental data displaying a close adherence to the empirical 3 / 2 power-law dependence of <b>bedload</b> <b>transport</b> rate on excess stream power which is the basis of this equation. Average <b>bedload</b> <b>transport</b> rate was found to be dependent on channel form, although insufficient measurements were made to define the relationship. <b>Bedload</b> <b>transport</b> was found to be more efficient under steady flow than under unsteady flow, and it was postulated that this is caused by a tendency for channel form to evolve towards a condition which maximises <b>bedload</b> <b>transport</b> for the occurring flow.

40|$|A two-layer {{shallow water}} type model is {{proposed}} to describe <b>bedload</b> sediment <b>transport.</b> The upper layer is filled by {{water and the}} lower one by sediment. The key point falls on {{the definition of the}} friction laws between the two layers, which are a generalization of those introduced in Fernández-Nieto et al. (ESAIM: M 2 AN, 51 : 115 - 145, 2017). This definition allows to apply properly the two-layer shallow water model for the case of intense and slow <b>bedload</b> sediment <b>transport.</b> Moreover, we prove that the two-layer model converges to a Saint-Venant-Exner system (SVE) including gravitational effects when the ratio between the hydrodynamic and morphodynamic time scales is small. The SVE with gravitational effects is a degenerated nonlinear parabolic system. This means that its numerical approximation is very expensive from a computational point of view, see for example T. Morales de Luna et al. (J. Sci. Comp., 48 (1) : 258 - 273, 2011). In this work, gravitational effects are introduced into the two-layer system without such extra computational cost. Finally, we also consider a generalization of the model that includes a non-hydrostatic pressure correction for the fluid layer and the boundary condition at the sediment surface.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Contaminated sediments are {{a serious}} threat to Great Lakes ecosystems. Numerous efforts {{currently}} under examination for sediment remediation are focused on expensive, recently developed destruction and extraction technologies. A simple alternative to these technologies may be artificial armoring. Several flume tests were designed to evaluate the capability of gravel armoring to isolate contaminated Buffalo River sediment from the water column. The sediment was placed in a sediment pocket of a recirculating flume and subjected to velocities up to 32 cm S·I. Measurements of bedload and suspended load were recorded. In subsequent runs, the sediment was armored with limestone gravel. Various factors such as the size of the gravel, the thickness of the armoring layer and the duration of the run were changed. Armored runs typically showed a 98 % reduction in the mass of <b>bedload</b> <b>transported</b> and a greater than 99 % reduction in suspended solids when compared to the unarmored runs. Suspended sediment and bedload data from the armored and unarmored runs show logarithmic relations as predicted by theory.

On average, levels of Fe were 84 % lower and levels of Cr were 93 % lower in the water column for armored runs as compared to unarmored runs...|$|R

The planform position {{is seen to}} change during high flows as the position of channels and bars is seen to change. These changes are produced as pulses of <b>bedload</b> <b>transport</b> are mobilized and transported downstream, causing an observable change in the river planform and morphology. While {{it is known that}} <b>bedload</b> <b>transport,</b> morphological change and planform change in a braided river are inter-related the relationships have not been quantified. The first component of this research was to build on previous results by re-analyzing daily areas of planform change on a proglacial reach of the Sunwapta River, Alberta. The second component was to extend the field data by replicating selected hydrographs from Sunwapta River in a small-scale physical model in which simultaneous measurements of <b>bedload</b> <b>transport,</b> morphological change and equivalent areas of planform change were measured. Planform change, morphological change and <b>bedload</b> <b>transport</b> were all found to increase in relation to an increase in peak discharge of the experimental hydrographs, with some variability among repeated hydrographs.

40|$|This study maps the facies {{architecture}} and geometry of stratigraphic surfaces within the tide-influenced upper Sego Sandstone exposed in the Book Cliffs between Crescent Junction and Thompson Springs, Utah. A bedding diagram was constructed by correlating 32 measured stratigraphic logs across this 8. 5 kilometer strike-oblique outcrop to interpret depositional environments and the sequence stratigraphic setting of this tidally-influenced sandstone. Five facies associations are defined: marine shale, lower shoreface, tidally-influenced bedsets, heterolithic tidal bedsets, and tidal flat deposits. Vertical facies trends define two sandy intervals {{separated by a}} marine shale, that are interpreted to record episodic progradation of deltaic shorelines. Erosion surfaces {{at the base of}} these intervals are interrupted to record tidal scouring of the sea floor during falling stage regression. Sandstone-bodies within these intervals shingle westward recording delta lobes that thinned and became more heterolithic. Although sandstone intervals are interpreted to record progradation, internal cross stratification is dominantly tidal-flood oriented. This is interpreted to record preferential preservation of <b>bedload</b> <b>transported</b> by flood tidal currents onshore, even though net sediment was directed offshore in a suspended ebb-oriented hypopycnal plume and as fluid mud during uncommon river floods.

Using the Swiss flood and landslide damage database – which collects financial damage data of naturally triggered floods, debris flows and landslides – we estimated the contribution of fluvial <b>bedload</b> <b>transport</b> processes to total damage costs in Switzerland. For each database entry an upper and lower limit of financial losses caused by or related to <b>bedload</b> <b>transport</b> processes was estimated, {{and the quality of the}} estimate was judged.

40|$|Graduation date: 1981 Utilizing both vortex and Helley-Smith samplers, bedload {{measurements}} {{were obtained for}} three storms during the 1977 - 78 winter at Flynn Creek. Flynn Creek drains a 2 km^ 2 undisturbed watershed in the Coast Range of western Oregon. The highest peak flow observed for the two-year study, including both 1977 and 1978 water years, was 0. 79 m^ 3 s^- 1 km^- 2, and represents approximately an average annual peak flow based on fifteen previous years of streamflow data. Results of measurements obtained with the vortex sampler indicated that as streamflow increased <b>bedload</b> <b>transport</b> rate increased. Temporal variations in <b>bedload</b> <b>transport</b> rate also indicated that as the storm season progressed, <b>bedload</b> <b>transport</b> rates increased even though streamflow did not necessarily increase above the streamflow of the previous storm. This may {{be a result of}} some critical discharge being necessary to initiate <b>bedload</b> <b>transport.</b> The calculated critical discharge for Flynn Creek was 0. 72 m^ 3 s^- 1 km^- 2 and was exceeded several times during the storm season. The peak <b>bedload</b> <b>transport</b> rate of 325 kg/hr occurred at a discharge of 0. 77 m^ 3 s^- 1 km^- 2. Significant (p = 0. 01) differences in <b>bedload</b> <b>transport</b> versus water discharge relationships occurred between storms. Helley-Smith <b>bedload</b> <b>transport</b> rates were consistently larger than vortex rates observed during all storms except on December 13, 1977, when the rates were approximately equal. The higher transport rates measured with the Helley-Smith sampler are attributed to sampler design and indicate that the sampler is more efficient for sand-sized material. Sand-sized particles represent the predominant particle size transported as bedload in Flynn Creek. <b>Bedload</b> <b>transport</b> did not occur uniformly with time, but rather occurred in "pulses" that did not appear to follow any pattern. Variations in stream cross sections and scour and fill measurements indicated that the release of bedload material occurred nonuniformly at many locations {{along the length of the}} stream channel. Information collected with cross-sectional measurements during 1977 indicated that the bed slope upstream of the fish trap may have been adjusting to the change in height of the streambed in the fish trap. Consequently, sediment data from different years should be compared with caution until it can be determined that the stream has come to equilibrium.

Values of the spatial lag coefficient are calculated from measured data and compared with values predicted by the theoretical relations. This investigation verifies the proposed spatial lag equation and indicates the form of the spatial lag coefficient relation. A temporal lag scheme which is able to predict the temporal variation of bed roughness and sediment transport capacity under non-steady flow conditions is developed and calibrated against measured data. An impulse model is used to predict the temporal variation of the variable which chracterises the temporal response of the alluvial system, the equivalent steady flow rate. The performance of the temporal lag scheme is tested against additional measured data which verifies the proposed temporal lag scheme.

Then the turbulence dissipates towards the end of the onshore flow, settling the suspended sediment to the bed. In contrast, the backwash is dominated by the sheet flow and <b>bedload</b> sediment <b>transport.</b> The flow velocity increases towards the end of the backwash causing more bed-generated turbulence, which results in sediment transport near the bed.

The mud crab Austrohelice crassa, is a key burrowing species in New Zealand estuaries that has shown context-specific interactions with its environment. Here we use annular flumes to test if sediment stability and erodibility were altered {{as a function of}} A. crassa burrow density in two contrasting sediment types: a cohesive sandy-mud and a non-cohesive sand. Three burrow density treatments (n= 3) reflecting the natural density range in each sediment type (sand; 0 - 100 m- 2, sandy-mud; 0 - 400 m- 2), were collected from the field and subjected to sequential increases in water flow velocity. Flow profiles were measured and bed shear stresses were calculated for each treatment. Increasing burrow density reduced the mass of sediment eroded at 0. 35 ms- 1 (ME- 35, gm- 2) in cohesive sandy-mud, while in non-cohesive sand a unimodal pattern was observed, whereby erosion rates were greatest at the lowest burrow density (19 m- 2). In the cohesive sediment, the linear decrease in erodibility with increasing burrow density was likely affected by the sluicing of fine particulates (silt-clay) from burrows when the tide was out creating both a smoothing and consolidating effect on the sediment surface. A reduction in flow velocity due to the increased presence of surficial pellets and greater trapping of <b>bedload</b> <b>transported</b> material was attributed to the reduction in the mass of sediment eroded in sand at high burrow densities. This study demonstrates that burrow builders influence sediment transport by more than just vertical particle mixing and highlights some of the complexities of small-scale sediment processes.

This thesis is organized into four chapters. These chapters analyze hydraulic, sediment transport and morpho-sedimentary measurements collected on a riffle-pool-riffle sequence of the Des Coeurs river during seven controlled experimental floods. Chapter 2 tests the velocity reversal hypothesis (Keller, 1971), with results demonstrating that no velocity reversal was observed in the field, for peak flow up to 123 % of the bankfull discharge. Chapter 3 demonstrates {{the existence of a}} <b>bedload</b> <b>transport</b> reversal: below 60 % of bankfull discharge, sediment transport on the riffle exceeds transport in the pool; as discharge increased, more sediment was exported from the pool than imported, thereby maintaining the pool. Chapter 4 demonstrates that the <b>bedload</b> <b>transport</b> reversal is caused by the spatial heterogeneity of the sediment transport patterns (sediment supply, particle displacements and sediment sorting), which underlies the importance of developing two-dimensional <b>bedload</b> <b>transport</b> formulae. Chapter 5 tests the two-dimensional applicability of well-known <b>bedload</b> <b>transport</b> formulae developed in a one-dimensional environment. None of the formulae could be applied with accuracy in a two-dimensional environment. However, site-specific calibration considerably improves <b>bedload</b> <b>transport</b> rate and grain-size distribution prediction. This thesis improves the understanding of the morpho-sedimentary dynamics of pool-riffle sequence; it argues that a purely hydraulic view of pool-riffle sequence is insufficient to understand their stability. It explains pool-riffle maintenance {{as a result of a}} <b>bedload</b> <b>transport</b> reversal caused by the spatial heterogeneity of the sediment transport patterns, and raises the importance of acquiring two-dimensional sediment transport data to improve two-dimensional <b>bedload</b> <b>transport</b> formulae...|$|E

40|$|This study uses outputs from {{hydrodynamic}} and <b>bedload</b> <b>transport</b> models {{combined with}} satellite imagery, aerial photography, and bathymetric data {{to understand the}} distributions and mechanisms maintaining six spatially extensive bedform facies in western Torres Strait. Changes in bedform morphology occur along north-south variations in coastal geometry and east-west variations in hydrodynamic regime. Numerous islands create an environment that favours the formation of banner banks in the south, while other sandbank morphologies occur on an extensive and comparatively 'flat' basement to the north. The western side of Torres Strait experiences net <b>bedload</b> <b>transport</b> that is directed to the west throughout the year and favours the formation of bedforms that prefer unidirectional <b>bedload</b> <b>transport</b> regimes (i. e. barchan-shaped sandbanks and sand ribbons). The {{eastern side of the}} strait experiences seasonal changes in the direction of net <b>bedload</b> <b>transport</b> and maintains 'S' and 'V' shaped sandbanks. Sediment availability also influences the bedform facies. Western Torres Strait experiences net westward <b>bedload</b> <b>transport</b> through the Strait However, sandbanks (indicating high sediment availability) are found in the central shallow and high current velocity areas, while sand ribbons (indicating low sediment availability) are a distal fades on the western side of the Strait. This sequence of bedforms indicates that sediments are preferentially trapped within the central portion of the Strait and not transported further west into the Gulf of Carpentaria...|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} a process-based mathematical model of suspended and <b>bedload</b> sediment <b>transport</b> under long, non-breaking waves {{on a plane}} beach, and we use this model to investigate {{the relationship between the}} hydrodynamics of run-up and run-down and the resulting erosive and depositional 'signature' which the wave leaves. In particular, we compare the results of our 'forward' model with several recently proposed methods for reconstructing tsunami hydrodynamics from their deposits. We find that sediment <b>transport,</b> both as <b>bedload</b> and in suspension, is strongly controlled by asymmetries in the direction of maximum velocity; in the latter case it is also affected by settling lag, especially around the point of maximum run-up. The combination of these effects appears to preclude simple methods of reconstructing tsunami hydrodynamics from the large-scale features of their signatures; however, our results suggest some promising avenues for further investigation...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} gain {{understanding}} of kinetic sieving-type segregation in <b>bedload</b> sediment <b>transport,</b> numerical experiments of two-size particle mixtures were carried out, using a validated coupled fluid-discrete element model developed at Irstea. A 3 D 10 % steep domain consisting at initial time of a given number of layers of 4 mm particles deposited {{on top of a}} coarser 6 mm particle bed, was submitted to a turbulent and supercritical fluid shear flow (Shields numbers of 0. 1 and 0. 3). The elevation of the centre of mass of the infiltrated fine particles is observed to follow the same logarithmic decrease with time, whatever the initial number of fine layers. This decrease is steeper for a higher Shields number. The main result is that this typical behaviour is related at first order to the shear rate depth profile...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the numerical approximation of <b>bedload</b> sediment <b>transport</b> due to water evolution. For the hydrodynamical component we consider Shallow Water equations. The morphodynamical component is defined by a continuity equation, which is defined in function of the solid transport discharge. We present several deterministic models, such as Meyer-Peter & Müller, Van Rijn or Grass model. We also present an unified definition for the solid transport discharge, and we compare with Grass model. Both components define a coupled system of equations that can be rewrite as a non-conservative hyperbolic system. To discretize it, we consider finite volume methods with or without flux limiters and high order state reconstructions. Finally we present several tests, where we observe numerically the order of the numerical schemes. Comparisons with analytical solutions and experimental data are also presented...|$|R
