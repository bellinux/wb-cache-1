25|$|The Foreigner Talk (FT) {{hypothesis}} {{argues that}} a pidgin or creole language forms when native speakers attempt to simplify their language {{in order to address}} speakers who do not know their language at all. Because of the similarities found in this type of speech and speech directed to a small child, it is also sometimes called <b>baby</b> <b>talk.</b>|$|E
25|$|One {{component}} of the young child's linguistic environment is child-directed speech (also known as <b>baby</b> <b>talk</b> or motherese), which is language spoken in a higher pitch than normal with simple words and sentences. Although the importance of its role in developing language has been debated, many linguists think that it may aid in capturing the infant's attention and maintaining communication. When children begin to communicate with adults, this motherese speech allows the child the ability to discern the patterns in language and to experiment with language.|$|E
50|$|Tattletail is a {{video game}} created by Waygetter Electronics. The player must care for their virtual pet toy, <b>Baby</b> <b>Talking</b> Tattletail, while {{avoiding}} the pursuit of its recalled predecessor, Mama Tattletail. The game was released on Steam on December 28, 2016.|$|R

50|$|For {{the five}} nights leading upto Christmas, the player must tend to their <b>Baby</b> <b>Talking</b> Tattletail toy by feeding it, {{grooming}} it, and {{allowing him to}} charge while completing a set of objectives each night. While the <b>Baby</b> <b>Talking</b> Tattletail isn't a threat, it is prone to generating a lot of sound, which alerts Mama Tattletail to your location. While completing a set task, the player must avoid Mama by staying quiet when she is near (indicated by her mechanical noises and glowing red eyes). Failure to do so or going too close will result in Mama attacking the player in a jump scare, sending the player back to a random checkpoint in the night.|$|R
25|$|Clooney's first {{role was}} {{as an extra}} in the {{television}} mini-series Centennial in 1978, {{which was based on}} the novel of the same name by James A. Michener and was partly filmed in Clooney's hometown of Augusta, Kentucky. Clooney's first major role came in 1984 in the short-lived sitcom E/R (not to be confused with ER, the better-known hospital drama, on which Clooney also co-starred a decade later). He played a handyman on the series The Facts of Life and appeared as Bobby Hopkins, a detective, on an episode of The Golden Girls. His first prominent role was a semi-regular supporting role in the sitcom Roseanne, playing Roseanne Barr's supervisor Booker Brooks, followed by the role of a construction worker on <b>Baby</b> <b>Talk,</b> a co-starring role on the CBS drama Bodies of Evidence as Detective Ryan Walker, and then a year-long turn as Det. James Falconer on Sisters. In 1988, Clooney {{played a role in the}} comedy-horror film Return of the Killer Tomatoes. In 1990, he starred in the short-lived ABC police drama Sunset Beat. During this period, Clooney was a student at the Beverly Hills Playhouse acting school for five years.|$|E
25|$|Elderspeak is a {{specialized}} speech style used by younger adults when addressing older adults. The speaker makes accommodations that include producing shorter, less complex sentences, using simpler vocabulary, filler words, fragmented sentences, lexical filters, and repetition. Elderspeak also includes using {{terms that are}} overly endearing, asking closed questions that prompt an answer, and using the collective “we”. Young people tend to speak at a slower rate and include more pauses when communicating with elders. This speech style is often patronizing in nature and resembles <b>baby</b> <b>talk.</b> Elderspeak stems from a reliance on stereotypes about cognitive abilities of older persons, and its use may {{be a result of}} or contribute to ageism, a form of discrimination based on age differences. Young people tend to believe that aging is associated with cognitive declines, including declines in language processing and production. However, this speech pattern is primarily based on stereotypes, as evidenced by its use in situations where older adults are clearly functioning well. When conversing with older persons, younger people often accommodate their speech based on their personal evaluation of their conversation partner’s ability, rather than their actual ability. Working to overcome elderspeak through awareness and self-monitoring as well as through formal educational programs are strategies individuals and other care providers can use to promote successful aging for older clients. Therefore, although some aspects of elderspeak may be beneficial for some recipients, it is generally seen as inappropriate and can hinder intergenerational communication.|$|E

Parents and caregivers often come together to talk about issues related to caring for young children, like nutrition, sleep or childhood development, but what is unique about these sessions is that the topics will be focused on the civic issues that impact our families. Each session will include a short presentation by an expert speaker or panel, followed by small group discussions.

500|$|One {{major element}} of the child-rearing {{strategy}} described in the book was treating Liu as an adult and [...] "encourag her to develop a mature style of thinking". [...] Liu's parents never used <b>baby</b> <b>talk</b> when Liu was a child, and they allowed her to argue with them but required her to present reasoned arguments like an adult. [...] According to education scholar Ben Mardell, the book's focus on independent thinking and intellectual development was a [...] "break with the past" [...] in China, where both early and higher education often emphasize rote learning.|$|E
500|$|Soon after Presley {{commenced}} {{basic training}} at Fort Hood, Texas, {{he received a}} visit from Eddie Fadal, a businessman he had met on tour. According to Fadal, Presley had become convinced his career was finished—"He firmly believed that." [...] But then, during a two-week leave in early June, Presley recorded five songs in Nashville. In early August, his mother was diagnosed with hepatitis and her condition rapidly worsened. Presley, granted emergency leave to visit her, arrived in Memphis on August 12. Two days later, she died of heart failure, aged 46. Presley was devastated; their relationship had remained extremely close—even into his adulthood, they would use <b>baby</b> <b>talk</b> {{with each other and}} Presley would address her with pet names.|$|E

50|$|Players {{acquire a}} shake {{flashlight}} to navigate in the darkness, but Mama Tattletail {{has the ability}} to kill the player's flashlight when they look directly at her. <b>Baby</b> <b>Talking</b> Tattletail is afraid of the dark and is quite vocal about it, creating a necessity to replenish the flashlight by shaking it quickly. However, the flashlight's shake also generates sound, so the player must be careful about when and where to shake. Baby Tattletail also requires periodic recharging of the battery, feeding and grooming; failing to do so will also trigger loud complaints from Baby Tattletail, which in turn triggers Mama to attack.|$|R
2500|$|Osment {{was born}} in Los Angeles, California, the son of Theresa (née Seifert), a teacher, and Michael Eugene Osment, a theater and film actor, both natives of Birmingham, Alabama. Osment was raised Roman Catholic. He has one sibling, actress Emily Osment, who is almost four years younger.

2500|$|While most {{children}} {{throughout the world}} develop language at similar rates and without difficulty, cultural and socioeconomic differences {{have been shown to}} influence development. [...] An example of cultural differences in language development can be seen when comparing the interactions of mothers in the United States with their infants with mothers in Japan. [...] Mothers in the United States use more questions, are more information-oriented, and use more grammatically correct utterances with their 3-month-olds. [...] Mothers in Japan, on the other hand, use more physical contact with their infants, and more emotion-oriented, nonsense, and environmental sounds, as well as <b>baby</b> <b>talk,</b> with their infants. [...] These differences in interaction techniques reflect differences in [...] "each society's assumptions about infants and adult-to-adult cultural styles of talking." ...|$|E
2500|$|There were {{distinct}} {{letters for}} the nine consonants -p, -t, -c, -k, -m, -n, -s, -y, and w, when they {{occurred at the}} end of a syllable.In addition, four [...] "final" [...] consonants had no syllabic forms: -h, -l, -r, and the sequence -hk. These were originally written midline, but are now superscripted. (The glyph for -hk represents the most common final sequence of the language, being a common grammatical ending in Cree, and was used for common -nk in Ojibwe.) The consonants -l and -r were marginal, only found in borrowings, <b>baby</b> <b>talk,</b> and the like. These, and -h, could occur before vowels, but were written with the final shape regardless. (-L and -r are now written the size of full letters when they occur before vowels, as the finals were originally, or in some syllabics scripts have been replaced with full rotating syllabic forms; -h only occurs before a vowel in joined morphemes and in a couple grammatical words.) ...|$|E

5000|$|The <b>Talking</b> <b>Baby</b> is {{described}} by creator Sean Keenan as an [...] "R-rated puppet show," [...] though the baby in question is not actually a puppet but rather an anatomically correct baby doll. During the <b>Talking</b> <b>Baby</b> segments, audience members are able to see Keenan's hand as he operates the baby, changing its hand positions and turning its head. The ostensible function of <b>Talking</b> <b>Baby</b> is to review movies, but the character often goes off on tangents about characters, actors, directors or concepts involved in the movie and quite often has not seen the movies he reviews. The <b>Talking</b> <b>Baby</b> segment is the raunchiest and most profanity-laden of each show, with the Baby promising to [...] "clean it up" [...] for children and the elderly before descending into a tirade of obscenity. One {{of the most popular}} sketches in the show, <b>Talking</b> <b>Baby</b> was eventually made the spokesman for MTV2 in the early 2000s.
