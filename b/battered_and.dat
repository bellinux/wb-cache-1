5|$|Japanese tempura is {{a popular}} deep-fried food that {{generally}} consists of <b>battered</b> <b>and</b> fried seafood and vegetables. Japanese deep-fried dishes, or Agemono, include other styles besides tempura, such as Karaage, Korokke, Kushikatsu, and Tonkatsu. In areas of south-east Asia such as Thailand, insects are commonly deep-fried for human consumption. Western-style fast food items such as donuts, deep-fried chicken, and deep-fried potatoes are also becoming popular in Asia.|$|E
5|$|As the {{deadline}} passed on April 2, Melkonian's armor entered the intersection and encountered {{a line of}} Azeri tanks and infantry. A firefight ensued but lasted for only several minutes as the defense line was soon <b>battered</b> <b>and</b> destroyed. Many of the Azeri forces were ill-prepared for the attack as Melkonian noted when pointing out to their lack of equipment. Despite having his force reduced down {{to a total of}} sixty-eight men, a force too weak to take the capital, he ordered them to continue forward.|$|E

5|$|Fried chicken (also {{referred}} to as Southern fried chicken for the variant in the United States) is a dish consisting of chicken pieces usually from broiler chickens which have been floured or <b>battered</b> <b>and</b> then pan-fried, deep fried, or pressure fried. The breading adds a crisp coating or crust to the exterior. What separates fried chicken from other fried forms of chicken is that generally the chicken is cut at the joints, and the bones and skin are left intact. Crisp well-seasoned skin, rendered of excess fat, is a hallmark of well made fried chicken.|$|E
5|$|The {{opposing}} armies met at {{the village}} of Albuera. Both sides suffered heavily in the ensuing struggle and the French finally withdrew on 18 May. Beresford's army was too <b>battered</b> <b>and</b> exhausted to pursue, but was able to resume the investment of Badajoz. Despite Soult's failure to relieve the town, the battle had little strategic effect on the war. Just one month later, in June 1811, the Allies were forced to abandon their siege by {{the approach of the}} reconstituted French Armies of Portugal and Andalusia.|$|E
5|$|Ultimately Hercule {{was forced}} to {{surrender}} after attempts to board Mars failed. Both ships were <b>battered</b> <b>and</b> burnt, with the French suffering at least 290 casualties and the British 90. Hercule was conveyed to Britain in the aftermath and later repaired and served in the Royal Navy until 1810. Both L'Héritier and the deceased Hood were highly praised for their conduct during the battle, which is noted as being a very rare example {{during this period of}} an action between two ships of approximately equal strength without any external influence.|$|E
40|$|The {{coating process}} of food {{products}} with various mixtures prior to frying {{is a common}} application in kitchens whereas it still requires much investigation in technological area. In this study, <b>batter</b> <b>and</b> breading technology used in coating of foods is reviewed. The coating process was defined, and the function of predusting, <b>battering</b> <b>and</b> breading, the general composition of <b>batter</b> <b>and</b> breading mixtures and {{the functions of the}} ingradients were explained. In the coating application, the most important problem known as adhesion and the effects of it on the efficiency and cost were investigated. <b>Batter</b> <b>and</b> breading processing equipments used in the industry and the process lines were reviewed, and the problems, new designs and the latest patents relating them were discussed. New coating systems known as tumbling and fluidization were investigated and compared with other systems...|$|R

5|$|Balchen's fleet was {{successful}} in driving off the French, who retired {{in the face of}} his superior fleet without firing a shot, and Hardy's convoy was escorted safely to Gibraltar. On the way to the Portuguese Coast, Balchen finally made his fortune in prize money, capturing six heavily laden French West Indiamen. On his return journey however, the fleet was sailing through the Western Approaches in early October when it was hit by a violent storm. Scattered across the Channel, they one by one returned to England in a <b>battered</b> <b>and</b> leaking condition until, a few days later, only HMS Victory was missing. Victory, Balchen's flagship, was, at the time, one of the largest ships in the world, holding a broadside of 100 guns. She was also very new, having been completed less than seven years before.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} morning of 13 March 1806 {{he was in the}} Mid-Atlantic when his lookouts spotted sails in the distance. Turning his force around to investigate, Linois hoped to {{encounter}} a merchant convoy but instead discovered the large British second rate HMS London looming out of the darkness ahead. Unable to escape, Linois fought until his ships were <b>battered</b> <b>and</b> he himself was badly wounded, but he eventually surrendered to the squadron under Admiral Warren that had followed London. Napoleon's fury at Linois was unabated and the French admiral remained a prisoner of war for the next eight years.|$|E
5|$|Harold {{had spent}} mid-1066 {{on the south}} coast with a large army and fleet waiting for William to invade. The bulk of his forces were militia who needed to harvest their crops, so on 8 September Harold {{dismissed}} the militia and the fleet. Learning of the Norwegian invasion he rushed north, gathering forces as he went, and took the Norwegians by surprise, defeating them at the Battle of Stamford Bridge on 25 September. Harald Hardrada and Tostig were killed, and the Norwegians suffered such great losses that only 24 of the original 300 ships were required to carry away the survivors. The English victory came at great cost, as Harold's army was left in a <b>battered</b> <b>and</b> weakened state.|$|E

5|$|I {{examined}} Mr. Andrew Wilson on Feb. 15 & 16, 1982. He {{had multiple}} bruises, swellings and abrasions {{on his face}} and head. His right eye was <b>battered</b> <b>and</b> had a superficial laceration. Andrew Wilson had several linear blisters on his right thigh, right cheek and anterior chest which were consistent with radiator burns. He stated he'd been cuffed to a radiator and pushed into it. He also stated that electrical shocks had been administered to his gums, lips and genitals. All these injuries occurred prior to his arrival at the Jail. There must be a thorough investigation of this alleged brutality.|$|E
5|$|On 3 September 1943, Italy {{surrendered}} to the Allied powers. Hoping to occupy {{as much of the}} country as possible before the German Army could react, the U.S. Fifth Army prepared to attack Salerno. On 10 September, elements of the division conducted its second landing at Agropoli and Paestum with the 36th Infantry Division, on the southernmost beaches of the attack. Opposing them were elements of the German 29th Panzergrenadier Division and XVI Panzer Corps. Against stiff resistance, the 45th pushed to the Calore River after a week of heavy fighting. The Fifth Army was <b>battered</b> <b>and</b> pushed back by German forces until 20 September, when Allied forces were finally able to break out and establish a more secure beachhead.|$|E
5|$|Strachan was unsurprised at the French reaction, and {{returned}} fire immediately, {{the proximity of}} the ships preventing any manoeuvres. Within twenty minutes the combat was decided, the French captain hauling down his colours with his ship <b>battered</b> <b>and</b> more than 60 men wounded or dead. The French ship carried significantly weaker cannon than Phoenix, with 6 and 12 pounder guns to the 9 and 18 pounders aboard the British squadron. In addition, Résolue was heavily outnumbered: no other French warships were in the area while the British had three large frigates within sight. French losses eventually totalled 25 men killed and 60 wounded, Strachan suffering just six killed and 11 wounded in return.|$|E

5|$|The carvings at {{the east}} {{entrance}} are <b>battered</b> <b>and</b> blurry. One in {{the southeast corner of}} the mandapa (see 2 on plan) depicts Shiva and Parvati in Mount Kailash in the Himalayas, and the shows the Umamaheshvara story. The scene includes rocky terrain and clouds layered horizontally. On top of a rock sit the four-armed Shiva and Parvati by his side. Nandi stands below her, while celestial apsaras float on the clouds above. There are traces of a crown and a disc behind Shiva, but it is all damaged. The scene is crowded with accessory figures, which may be because the eastern entrance was meant to have a devotional focus.|$|E
5|$|As {{darkness}} fell, Furieuse disappeared ahead, Mounsey pursuing in {{the hope}} of rediscovering his opponent during the night. At 03:00 on 6 July, the British lookouts spotted the French ship in the distance and the chase began again, Bonne Citoyenne proving much faster than the French ship as the wind strengthened. At 09:10 it became clear to Kerdaniel that he could not escape his opponent and instead turned to meet her, opening fire five minutes later as Bonne Citoyenne came within range. Mounsey replied immediately, the two ships exchanging fire at close range for nearly seven hours, the smaller and more manoeuvrable Bonne Citoyenne successfully turning several times to vary her broadsides and prevent her guns overheating. In the exchange, the British ship fired 129 broadsides, while Furieuse only managed 70: Bonne Citoyenne lost three cannon to fractures caused by the intense heat generated by repeated firing. With his ammunition spent, Mounsey swung towards Furieuse at 18:16 to board and capture her, at which point Kerdaniel, whose ship was <b>battered</b> <b>and</b> unmanoeuvrable, surrendered.|$|E
5|$|Nelson {{followed}} in Vanguard, bringing {{the next two}} ships into action with the starboard side of the French van, catching the French ships in a crossfire that rapidly <b>battered</b> <b>and</b> dismasted the ships, despite determined defence. As the French van was destroyed, HMS Bellerophon and HMS Majestic attacked the French centre. Outnumbered and faced with the massed broadsides of Orient and the 80-gun Franklin and Tonnant, both British ships suffered massive damage. Culloden, {{bringing up the rear}} of the British line, passed too close to the northern shoal and grounded, Troubridge suffering severe damage to his hull despite efforts by Mutine and Leander to drag the ship off. By 19:00 darkness had fallen, and within an hour the French van had been defeated, Guerrier, Conquérant, Spartiate, Aquilon and Peuple Souverain all either in British hands or too badly damaged to continue fighting. The British too had suffered damage, with Vanguard and Goliath badly hit while to the south both Bellerophon and Majestic had been forced to cut their anchor cables and pull away from their respective opponents. Bellerophon had been dismasted, Majestics captain George Blagden Westcott had been killed, and on Vanguard Nelson had suffered a severe head wound.|$|E

5|$|The ARVN III Corps commander, General Toan, {{organized}} five {{centers of}} resistance {{for the defense}} of the city. These fronts were so connected as to form an arc enveloping the area west, north, and east of the capital. The Cu Chi front, to the northwest, was defended by the 25th Division; the Bình Dương front, to the north, was the responsibility of the 5th Division; the Biên Hòa front, to the northeast, was defended by the 18th Division; the Vũng Tàu and 15 Route front, to the southeast, was held by the 1st Airborne Brigade and one battalion of the 3rd Division; and the Long An front, for which the Capital Military District Command was responsible, was defended by elements of the re-formed 22nd Division. South Vietnamese defensive forces around Saigon totaled approximately 60,000 troops. However, as the exodus made its way into Saigon, along with them were many ARVN soldiers, causing the number of men under arms in the city to exceed 250,000. Unfortunately, these units were mostly <b>battered</b> <b>and</b> leaderless, which threw the city into further anarchy.|$|E
5|$|The single's {{music video}} was co-directed by Carey and Daniel Pearl. It was {{inspired}} by the Tennessee Williams play Baby Doll and a dream Carey had one night. The video begins with scenes of a man leaving his home one early morning; only his feet are shown. Carey is first seen residing in the derelict house, {{in the middle of a}} large meadow. She awakes, sad and depressed, wearing <b>battered</b> <b>and</b> disheveled clothing. As she walks down the stairs, Carey sits on the staircase, lamenting in agony at her loneliness. As the video climaxes, Carey is seen finally leaving the foyer, apparently for the first time in many years, escaping from the misery she once called home. As she reaches the outskirts of the property, Carey mounts a horse, which assists her in jumping over the barbed fence. After leaving, Carey is seen smiling for the first time in the video, while waiving her arms in the air.|$|E
5|$|With the {{immediate}} threat gone, Saumarez {{was able to}} direct his squadron's efforts to salvaging the <b>battered</b> <b>and</b> grounded Venerable. The calm sea and light winds aided this operation, and at 14:00, assisted by Thames and the boats of Caesar and Spencer, Venerable was once again afloat. Hood's ship was taken under tow by first Thames and then Spencer, the British squadron turning back towards Gibraltar at 18:00, the crew rigging a series of jury masts and sails to assist the process. By 08:00 on 14 July, Venerable was again able to sail independently, the squadron arriving at Gibraltar later that day. At Gibraltar the returning squadron was greeted with cheers and a 21-gun salute. Spencer, Audacious and Thames remained at sea off Cadiz to continue the blockade, which remained in place {{until the end of}} the French Revolutionary Wars in March 1802 at the Peace of Amiens.|$|E
