25|$|According to this argument, {{the fact}} the Electoral College {{is made up of}} real people instead of mere numbers allows for human {{judgment}} and flexibility to make a decision, if it happens that a candidate dies or becomes legally disabled {{around the time of the}} election. Advocates of the current system argue that human electors would <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> position to choose a suitable replacement than the general voting public. According to this view, electors could act decisively during the critical time interval between when ballot choices become fixed in state ballots until mid-December when the electors formally cast their ballots. In the election of 1872, losing Liberal Republican candidate Horace Greeley died during this time interval, which resulted in disarray for the Democratic Party, who also supported Greeley, but the Greeley electors were able to split their votes for different alternate candidates. A situation in which the winning candidate died has never happened. In the election of 1912, Vice President Sherman died shortly before the election when it was too late for states to remove his name from their ballots; accordingly, Sherman was listed posthumously, but the eight electoral votes that Sherman would have received were cast instead for Nicholas Murray Butler.|$|E

500|$|Rangel was {{an early}} and strong {{supporter}} of Hillary Clinton's 2008 presidential campaign for the Democratic nomination. His actions during 2007 included taking {{a shot at the}} marital histories of former Mayor of New York Rudy Giuliani, then the Republican front-runner, and his wife Judith Giuliani, resulted in Rangel issuing a no-excuses apology. [...] As 2008 unwound, the Democratic primaries and caucuses turned into a historic battle between Clinton and Senator Barack Obama. Although Obama had a real chance of becoming the first African-American president, a development that Rangel viewed with pride, and although some racially tinged comments entered the contest and Clinton's support among African Americans plunged, Rangel stayed loyal to her, saying [...] "There’s just {{no question in my mind}} that Hillary would <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> position than a freshman senator. This ain’t no time for a beginner." [...] (Rangel's wife Alma, on the other hand, publicly supported Obama.) [...] Rangel did endorse Obama once he finally clinched the nomination in early June 2008.|$|E

500|$|Off Cadiz, the {{squadron}} under Saumarez was notified of Linois's arrival by Lieutenant Janvarin at 02:00 on 5 July and immediately turned back towards Gibraltar, tacking against the wind. The frigate HMS Thames was detached and sent [...] westwards {{to the mouth}} of the Guadalquivir River to collect HMS Superb under Captain Richard Goodwin Keats, which was blockading the river with the small brig HMS Pasley. Keats did follow Saumarez back to Algeciras, and was in distantly in sight when the battle commenced, but on hearing an inaccurate report from an American merchant ship that Linois had escaped the bay and was at sea once more, Keats reasoned that the French must be returning to Toulon and that he would <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> position returning to the blockade of Cadiz than attempting to join Saumarez's chase. The lugger HMS Plymouth was also detached to Lisbon with despatches for the Admiralty informing them of Saumarez's intentions. The British admiral, knowing that Linois was still anchored in the bay, intended to descend on Algeciras immediately but was beset by a series of calm spells that prevented his squadron from doing more than slowly drifting eastwards away from Superb and towards Algeciras. It was not until the morning of 6 July therefore that Saumarez {{was in a position to}} attack the anchored French squadron. In anticipation of Saumarez's arrival, Linois had formed his squadron into a strong defensive position, the three ships of the line anchored in a line north to south across in shallow waters off the mouth of Algeciras harbour, protected by Spanish forts at either extremity and around the town itself, where Murion was anchored in shallower water. Linois led the line himself in Formidable, but despatched parties from the crews of the ships of the line to augment the Spanish defences.|$|E
2500|$|By 1978 {{the economy}} {{had started to}} show signs of recovery, with {{inflation}} falling to single digits, unemployment falling, and living standards starting to rise during the year. Labour's opinion poll ratings also improved, with most showing the party to have gained a narrow lead.

In the event he decided to extend his wage restraint policy for another year hoping that the economy would <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> shape for a 1979 election. However during the winter of 1978–79 there were widespread strikes among lorry drivers, railway workers, car workers and local government and hospital workers in favour of higher pay-rises that caused significant disruption to everyday life. These events came to be dubbed the [...] "Winter of Discontent".|$|E
2500|$|Given the {{ambiguity}} {{in the legal}} sources and the policy decision involved, the Court took the view that Parliament would <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> position to create a defence to contempt of court. Until Parliament did so, however, {{it was for the}} court to determine the operation of fair criticism at common law. On this point, the Court held that the concept of fair criticism should go towards liability. Due to the quasi-criminal nature of scandalizing contempt, the alleged contemnor should not be disadvantaged by having the evidential burden placed on him or her. The Court of Appeal concluded with a caveat that the approach adopted was only provisional in nature, since the characterisation of fair criticism was not fully canvassed before it. Chan has said that requiring the Prosecution to prove the absence of fair criticism is to be [...] "commended for enhancing the protection of the alleged contemnor’s right of free speech".|$|E

2500|$|Lisa Shalett, chief {{investment}} officer at Merrill Lynch Wealth Management noted that, [...] "for {{the last two decades}} and especially in the current period, ... productivity soared ... U.S. real average hourly earnings are essentially flat to down, with today's inflation-adjusted wage equating to about the same level as that attained by workers in 1970. ... So where have the benefits of technology-driven productivity cycle gone? Almost exclusively to corporations and their very top executives." [...] In addition to the technological side of it, the affected functionality emanates from the perceived unfairness and the reduced trust of people towards the state. The study by Kristal and Cohen showed that rising wage inequality has brought about an unhealthy competition between institutions and technology. [...] The technological changes, with computerization of the workplace, seem to give an upper hand to the high-skilled workers as the primary cause of inequality in America. The qualified will always be considered to <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> position as compared to those dealing with hand work leading to replacements and unequal distribution of resources.|$|E
2500|$|Pope Clement VII died on 25 September 1534, {{having lived}} 56 years. [...] The Conclave of 1534 opened on 10 October 1534, and Cardinal de Lorraine was present {{as the leader}} of the French faction, which {{numbered}} between ten and twelve members. [...] Their candidate was Cardinal François de Tournon, who had negotiated the marriage of Henri, King Francis' second son, and Catherine de' Medici. Cardinal Alessandro Farnese was supported by Cardinal Ippolito d'Este and his fellow Florentine cardinals who had been created by Clement VII. [...] The Italians favored Agostino Trivulzio, the Protector of France before the Holy See and the holder of several French episcopal benefices, [...] whose uncles were Marshals of France, but he realized that he could not marshal sufficient votes to be elected. [...] He therefore threw his support behind the oldest of the cardinals, Alessandro Farnese, hoping that Farnese's reign would be a short one and that he would <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> position at the next conclave. [...] Farnese was elected by acclamation on 11 October, the first day of voting, and was formally elected by ballot the next morning. [...] He chose the name Paul III, and reigned for fifteen years. [...] Trivulzio died the year before Paul did.|$|E
