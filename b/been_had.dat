5|$|In the 19th century, the {{official}} view was increasingly questioned. The aristocratic Ancien Régime had been weakened severely during the Napoleonic Wars, when the Confederacy {{had been a}} French satellite state. The episode of the Helvetic Republic, short-lived as it had <b>been,</b> <b>had</b> instilled democratic ideals in the population. The restauration of the Ancien Régime {{after the end of}} the Napoleonic era proved to be only temporary, until Switzerland became a federal state in 1848 when its first democratic constitution was passed. During the restoration, democratic publishers instrumented and interpreted the history of the peasant war as an allegory on the then current struggle for democracy, seeing the peasant war of 1653 as an early precursor of their own efforts to overcome the authoritarian regime. Well-known examples are the illustrations by Martin Disteli from 1839/40, who used scenes from the peasant war in such allegoric ways.|$|E

The foundations of the walls were trenches full of damp concrete, drying in patches; the rooms--it was incredible they could ever be rooms--were shaped out as squares and oblongs of coarse, wet grass and sorrel.

25|$|However, Charmley {{dismisses the}} {{concerns}} of contemporaries such as Charles Webster and Lord Cecil of Chelwood that Bevin, a man of very strong personality, was “in {{the hands of his}} officials”. Charmley argues that much of Bevin's success came because he shared the views of those officials: his earlier career had left him with an intense dislike of communists, whom he regarded as workshy intellectuals whose attempts to infiltrate trade unions were to be resisted. His former Private Secretary Oliver Harvey thought Bevin’s staunchly anti-Soviet policy was what Eden’s would have <b>been</b> <b>had</b> he not been hamstrung, as at Potsdam, by Churchill’s occasional susceptibility to Stalin’s flattery, whilst Cadogan thought Bevin “pretty sound on the whole”.|$|E

The Indiana women's coach, Bea Gorton, patterned her style of play and practices after Knight, {{and it was the}} observation of the style of play at the AIAW event that persuaded her to choose Indiana. The effect would become more direct. Because Gorton designed her practices based upon what she observed from Knight, VanDerveer started attending Knight's practices to see what she would be doing later that day in practice. VanDerveer carried what she learned from Knight to her practices at Stanford.|$|E

Therefore, the HM V trams were numbered starting from one and not from 376, {{as they would have}} <b>been</b> <b>had</b> the old numbering been continued. The HM V trams were built to be compatible with the HP II type trailers that had been constructed in 195859, also by Karia.

25|$|With stylometric {{approaches}} it {{is possible}} to identify certain characteristics which are very typical of Shakespeare, {{such as the use of}} particular poetic techniques or the frequency with which various common words are used, and these have been used to argue that Marlowe could not have written Shakespeare's works. In every case so far where these data have been plotted over time, however, Marlowe's corpus has been found to fit just where Shakespeare's would have <b>been,</b> <b>had</b> he written anything before the early 1590s as all of Marlowe's were. On the other hand, whereas stylometry might be useful in discerning where two sets of work are not by the same person, it can be used with less confidence to show that they are. This was something that T.C. Mendenhall, whose work some Marlovians have nevertheless thought proves their theory, was at pains to point out.|$|E
25|$|Studying {{earthquakes}} {{has shown}} to be a difficult task when considering all the limitations created by natural disasters. Clinical interviews are difficult because of the widespread damage to infrastructure and roads, which leads to reliance on self-report. Self-report can introduce bias to results, leading to skewed data. Researchers are unable to reliably compare an individual's mental health status to their health status previous to the trauma because they must rely on retrospective self-report. Retrospective self-report is affected greatly by the individual's current state of distress. The displacement of large numbers of citizens following a trauma poses as a problem for researchers of natural disasters. It is predicted {{that the people who are}} displaced experience the worst of the damage, and therefore the reported levels of PTSD and depression are often lower than they would have <b>been</b> <b>had</b> the displaced citizens been available to collect data from. Because large number of citizens are being displaced, it is difficult to find a representative sample population. For example, after the Christchurch earthquakes, studies reported that older educated females of European New Zealand descent were over represented in their sample population, which isn't accurate of the Christchurch population as a whole.|$|E
