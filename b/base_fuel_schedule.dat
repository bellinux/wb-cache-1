40|$|Railroad {{companies}} spend {{billions of}} dollars each year to purchase fuel for thousands of locomotives across the railroad network. Each fuel station charges a site-dependent fuel price, and the railroad companies must pay an additional flat contracting fee {{in order to use}} it. This paper presents a linear mixed-integer mathematical model that integrates not only fuel station location decisions but also locomotive <b>fueling</b> <b>schedule</b> decisions. The proposed model helps railroads decide which fuel stations to contract, and how each locomotive should purchase fuel along its predetermined shipment path, such that no locomotive runs out of fuel while the summation of fuel purchasing costs, shipment delay costs (due to fueling), and contracting charges is minimized. A Lagrangian relaxation framework is proposed to decompose the problem into <b>fueling</b> <b>schedule</b> and facility location selection sub-problems. A network shortest path formulation of the <b>fueling</b> <b>schedule</b> sub-problem is developed to obtain an exact optimal solution to the <b>fueling</b> <b>schedule</b> sub-problem. The proposed framework is applied to a large-scale empirical case and is shown to effectively reduce system costs.

40|$|The major {{aspects of}} this project are {{proceeding}} toward completion. Prior to this quarter, design criteria, tentative site selection, facility layout, and preliminary facility cost estimates were completed and issued. Processing of bio-solids was completed, providing material for the pilot operations. Pilot facility design, equipment selection, and modification were completed during {{the fourth quarter of}} 2000. Initial pilot facility shakedown was completed during the fourth quarter. After some unavoidable delays, a suitable representative supply of MSW feed material was procured. During this first quarter of 2001, shredding of the feed material and final feed conditioning were completed. Pilot facility hydrolysis production was completed to produce lignin for co-fire testing. During this quarter, TVA completed the washing and dewatering of the lignin material produced from the MSW hydrolysis. Seven drums of lignin material were washed to recover the acid and sugar from the lignin and provide an improved fuel for steam generation. Samples of both the lignin and bio-solids fuel materials for co-fire testing were sent to the co-fire facility (EERC) for evaluation. After sample evaluation, EERC approved sending the material and all of the necessary fuel for testing was shipped to EERC. EERC has requested and will receive coal typical of the fuel to the TVA-Colbert boilers. This material will be used at EERC as baseline material and for mixing with the bio-fuel for combustion testing. EERC combustion testing of the bio <b>based</b> <b>fuels</b> is <b>scheduled</b> to begin in August of 2001. The TVA-Colbert facility has neared completion of the task to evaluate the co-location of the Masada facility on the operation of the power generation facility. The TVA-Colbert fossil plant is fully capable of providing a reliable steam supply. The preferred steam supply connection points and steam pipeline routing have been identified. The environmental review of the pipeline routing has been completed and no major impacts have been identified. Detailed assessment of steam export impacts on the Colbert boiler system have been completed and a cost estimate for steam supply system was completed. The cost estimate and the output and heat rate impacts will be used to determine a preliminary price for the exported steam. The preliminary steam price will be determined in the next quarter...|$|R

This article shows the effect of olefin addition (and in particular 1 -octene and octa- 1, 7 -diene addition) in a Diesel <b>base</b> <b>fuel.</b> Tests are made with a jet-stirred reactor and an engine bench. The current Diesel fuel cetane numbers are not really adapted for a perfect control of HCCI combustion. In HCCI conditions, the autoignition of a Diesel fuel occurs {{too early in the}} cycle. This study shows that, with the jet-stirred reactor, 1 -octene addition allows decreasing the advancement of the cool flame reaction of n-octane. Engine bench experiments show that, at 1500 rpm, 1 -octene and octa- 1, 7 -diene addition decrease the physical delay and increase the chemical auto-ignition delay of the Diesel <b>base</b> <b>fuel.</b> These results can be explained by olefin chemistry: olefin double bonds imply reactions (with radicals) that are in competition with the cool flame reactions.

40|$|AbstractThe steep rise {{of demand}} of {{petroleum}} <b>based</b> <b>fuel</b> {{is because of}} rapid and fast industrialization of automotive sector. There are limited reserves for petroleum <b>based</b> <b>fuels.</b> These limited reserves {{are located in the}} certain regions of the world. Therefore the countries those are not having the sufficient stock of petroleum <b>based</b> <b>fuel,</b> are facing the problems of increase cost of fuel which mainly due to the cost involved in the import of the petroleum <b>based</b> <b>fuel.</b> Hence it is required to find out and investigate the other resources of the alternative fuels, which can be produced from nearby and locally available sources such as Alcohol, Biodiesel, Vegetable oil etc. Methyl or ethyl esters of fatty acids produced from vegetable oil or an animal fat is called biodiesel. Non edible oil or animal fats are the main recourses for production of biodiesel such as Jatropha, Palm, Marine fish oil, Soybean, Cottonseed etc. Biodiesel blends are prepared in any proportion with diesel to use in a conventional diesel engine. By using biodiesel in an engine there is a significant reduction in the harmful pollutants in the environment. This paper reviews the production, properties, performance and emission analysis of different feedstock of blends of biodiesel and experimental work carried out in the various parts of the world...|$|R
40|$|The {{blending}} of ethanol with PRF (Primary reference fuel) 84 was investigated and compared with FACE (Fuels for Advanced Combustion Engines) A gasoline surrogate {{which has a}} RON of 83. 9. Previously, experiments were performed at four HCCI conditions but the chemical effect responsible for the non-linear blending behavior of ethanol with PRF 84 and FACE A was not understood. Hence, in this study the experimental measurements were simulated using zero-dimensional HCCI engine model with detailed chemistry in CHEMKIN PRO. Ethanol {{was used as an}} octane booster for the above two <b>base</b> <b>fuels</b> in volume concentration of 0 %, 2 %, 5 % and 10 %. The geometrical data and the intake valve closure conditions were used to match the simulated combustion phasing with the experiments.

LTHR formation depended on the <b>base</b> <b>fuel</b> type and the engine operating conditions suggesting that the <b>base</b> <b>fuel</b> composition has {{an important role in the}} formation of LTHR. The effect of ethanol on LTHR was explained by low temperature chemistry reactions and OH/HO evolution.
