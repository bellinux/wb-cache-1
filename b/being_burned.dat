5|$|In Christianity, Saint Apollonia is {{the patron}} saint of {{toothache}} and other dental problems. She was an early Christian martyr who was persecuted for her beliefs in Alexandria during the Imperial Roman age. A mob struck her repeatedly in the face until all her teeth were smashed. She was threatened with <b>being</b> <b>burned</b> alive unless she renounced Christianity, but she instead chose to throw herself onto the fire. Supposedly, toothache sufferers who invoke her name will find relief.|$|E

5000|$|The {{episode was}} written by Jon Vitti and {{directed}} by Mark Kirkland. Originally, the writers wanted to have Burns sell the plant to the Japanese, but they decided {{that it would have}} been too clichéd; the plot, however, remained the same with the Germans. The title is an inaccurate German translation of [...] "Burns sells the power plant", the correct version <b>being</b> <b>Burns</b> verkauft das Kraftwerk.|$|R

5|$|Coal is now {{delivered}} to the station mainly using rail transport and is unloaded at the station using a merry-go-round system. Trains supplying the station use the Newbiggin and Lynemouth branch line of the Blyth and Tyne Railway, which also serves the smelter. This line was originally used to export coal from the local coalfield, and also had passenger services. These passenger services ceased in 1964, and now the line is only used to serve the power station and smelter. Coal from the local opencast mines is brought to the station by road using heavy goods vehicles. Coal is graded and washed at the station prior to <b>being</b> <b>burned.</b>|$|E
5|$|During the retreat, Crawford and {{an unknown}} number of his men were captured. The Indians {{executed}} many of these captives in retaliation for the Gnadenhutten massacre that occurred earlier in the year, in which about 100 peaceful Indians were murdered by Pennsylvanian militiamen. Crawford's execution was particularly brutal: he was tortured for at least two hours before <b>being</b> <b>burned</b> at the stake. His execution was widely publicized in the United States, worsening the already-strained relationship between Native Americans and European Americans.|$|E
5|$|In 1925, NESCo set up {{separate}} {{plant at}} the power station for the low temperature carbonisation treatment of coal, before <b>being</b> <b>burned</b> in boilers and the steam used for electricity generation. The treatment plant was manufactured by Babcock & Wilcox, and {{set up in a}} self-contained boiler house which contained four boilers, four retorts and pulverising mills. The building was also fitted with gas-stripping and by-product plants. The carbonising plant could handle up to 100 tonnes of coal per day, while its boilers produced 78,000lb of steam per hour. This plant was extended in 1931.|$|E

5|$|The Shihab emirs {{requested}} Shahin {{and his men}} {{withdraw from}} Baabda's vicinity to avoid conflict. However, on 29 May, clashes occurred in the Matn village of Beit Mery between its Druze and Christian residents, {{which led to the}} participation of their respective coreligionists from other villages in the vicinity. By 30 May, the Druze had defeated the Keserwan fighters in Beit Meri. Fighting subsequently spread throughout Matn, with 35–40 Christian villages <b>being</b> <b>burned.</b> According to Lebanese historian Leila Tarazi Fawaz, the Keserwan fighters proved to be undisciplined and ineffective against the more experienced, unified and better organized Druze forces.|$|E

5|$|Under the {{protection}} of the National Guard, some miners returned to work and some strikebreakers, imported from the eastern coalfields, joined them as Guard troops protecting their movements. In February 1914, {{a substantial portion of the}} troops were withdrawn, but a large contingent remained at Ludlow. On April 20, 1914, a general fire-fight occurred between strikers and troops, which was antagonized by the troops and mine guards. The camp was burned, resulting in 15 women and children, who hid in tents at the camp, <b>being</b> <b>burned</b> to death. Costs to both mine operators and the union were high.

Basilius, threatens and forces King Oswald into revealing the location of Commodus, who has been traded to the fearsome men north of Hadrian's Wall. Basilius orders Vitallion and Marius to retrieve him. After crossing the border into Caledonia, the party is ambushed, Vitallion is taken hostage by barbarians, and Marius is separated from his legion.

5|$|During the Prussian {{invasion}} of Hesse in June 1866, Victoria and Elisabeth {{were sent to}} England {{to live with their}} grandmother until hostilities were ended by the absorption of Hesse-Kassel and parts of Hesse-Darmstadt into Prussia. During the Franco-Prussian War of 1870, military hospitals were set up in the palace grounds at Darmstadt, and she helped in the soup kitchens with her mother. She remembered the intense cold of the winter, and <b>being</b> <b>burned</b> on the arm by hot soup. In 1872, Victoria's eighteen-month-old brother, Friedrich, was diagnosed with haemophilia. The diagnosis came as a shock to the royal families of Europe; it had been twenty years since Queen Victoria had given birth to her haemophiliac son, Prince Leopold, Duke of Albany, {{and it was the first}} indication that the bleeding disorder in the royal family was hereditary. The following year, Friedrich fell from a window onto stone steps and died. It was the first of many tragedies to beset the Hesse family.|$|E

Walternate, watching the altercation on monitors, notes Olivia has gained the marksmanship ability that the alternate Olivia possesses, and begins to think the serum is working. Brandon (Ryan McDonald) theorizes in a later conversation that the rush of adrenaline effectively enhanced the potency of his chemical agents to brainwash Olivia.|$|E

5|$|The player must explore solar systems, gather clues, {{and find}} special {{artifacts}} that grant {{access to the}} Crystal Planet, ultimately destroying it before the player's home system flares. Commander McConnell's last journal entry {{can be found on}} the surface of the Crystal Planet; in it, he shares his discovery that Endurium is actually a race of living, sentient beings who are <b>being</b> <b>burned</b> up as fuel for interstellar travel. Because their metabolism is extremely slow due to their crystalline makeup, they are not even aware of outside life and have come to view other races as a virus.

5|$|According to legend, Sherwood's sons put {{her body}} near the fireplace, and a wind {{came down the}} chimney. Her body {{disappeared}} amid the embers, with the only clue being a cloven hoofprint. Sherwood lies in an unmarked grave under some trees in a field near the intersection of Pungo Ferry Road and Princess Anne Road in Virginia Beach. Stories about the Devil taking her body, unnatural storms, and loitering black cats quickly arose after her death, and local men killed every feline they could find; this widespread killing of cats might have caused the infestation of rats and mice recorded in Princess Anne County in 1743. Her home on Muddy Creek stood for over 200 years. After <b>being</b> <b>burned</b> {{several times in the}} 20th century by vandals, all that was left in 2002 were the brick chimneys, which were bulldozed in November 2002.

5|$|One of {{the best}} {{preserved}} phases of Temple 16 is the Rosalila, built over the remains of five previous versions of the temple. Archaeologist Ricardo Agurcia discovered the almost intact shrine while tunneling underneath {{the final version of}} the temple. Rosalila is notable for its excellent state of preservation, including the entire building from the base platform up to the roof comb, including its highly elaborate painted stucco decoration. Rosalila features K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo' placed at the centre of a mythological tableau, combining the founder of the dynasty with the sky deity Itzamna in avian form. The mythological imagery also includes anthropomorphic mountains, skeletons and crocodiles. Vents in the exterior were designed so smoke from incense <b>being</b> <b>burned</b> inside the shrine would interact with the stucco sculpture of the exterior. The temple had a hieroglyphic stone step with a dedicatory inscription. The stone step is less well preserved than the rest of the building, but a date in AD571 has been deciphered. Due to the deforestation of the Copán valley, the Rosalila building was the last structure at the site to use such elaborate stucco decoration — vast quantities of firewood could no longer be spared to reduce limestone to plaster. A life-size copy of the Rosalila building has been built at the Copán site museum.|$|E
