The architect Edmund Blacket designed the original Neo-Gothic sandstone Quadrangle and Great Tower buildings, which were completed in 1862. The rapid expansion of the university in the mid-20th century resulted in the acquisition of land in Darlington across City Road. The Camperdown/Darlington campus houses the university's administrative headquarters, and the Faculties of Arts, Science, Education and Social Work, Pharmacy, Veterinary Science, Economics and <b>Business,</b> <b>Architecture,</b> and Engineering.

40|$|Abstract — The i * {{framework}} {{has been}} widely used to derive business process models {{as an attempt to}} fulfill business strategies in the business/IT environment. However, in a dynamic environment the derivation methods do not easily adapt to radical changes required either in goals or process models due to the absence of a <b>business</b> process <b>architecture</b> that permits <b>business</b> processes improvement. The current approaches for <b>business</b> process <b>architecture</b> modelling, and particularly the Riva-based method, lack the integration of business goals for both deriving the process of <b>business</b> process <b>architecture</b> development and/or aligning business goals to a pre-existing <b>business</b> process <b>architecture</b> model. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that is i*-based to align a Riva <b>business</b> process <b>architecture</b> with <b>business</b> goals, and vice versa, with full traceability in both directions to tackle the above shortcomings. This approach has been initially evaluated using the Cancer Detection pilot study in the Cancer Care and Registration process in Jordan. This goal-driven alignment has demonstrated a systematic bridging of the gap between goal-oriented and business process models in a dynamic environment. Moreover, the business goals integration has improved the Riva <b>business</b> process <b>architecture</b> development process and produced new knowledge for the as-is Riva process architecture and its associated business process models, where many are run as software services...|$|R

60|$|Miss Kilburn {{saw them}} in the spring, when their {{usefulness}} was least apparent, {{and she did not}} know whether to praise the spirit of progress which showed itself in them as well as in other things at Hatboro'. She had come prepared to have misgivings, but she had promised herself to be just; she thought she could bear the old ugliness, if not the new. Some of the new things, however, were not so ugly; the young station-master was handsome in his railroad uniform, and pleasanter to the eye than the veteran baggage-master, incongruous in his stiff silk cap and his shirt sleeves and spectacles. The station itself, one of Richardson's, massive and low, with red-tiled, spreading veranda roofs, impressed her with its fitness, and strengthened her for her encounter with the <b>business</b> <b>architecture</b> of Hatboro', which was of the florid, ambitious New York type, prevalent with every American town {{in the early stages of}} its prosperity. The buildings were of pink brick, faced with granite, and supported in the first story by columns of painted iron; flat-roofed blocks looked down over the low-wooden structures of earlier Hatboro', and a large hotel had pushed back the old-time tavern, and planted itself flush upon the sidewalk. But the stores seemed very good, as she glanced at them from her carriage, and their show-windows were tastefully arranged; the apothecary's had an interior of glittering neatness unsurpassed by an Italian apothecary's; and the provision-man's, besides its symmetrical array of pendent sides and quarters indoors, had banks of fruit and vegetables without, and a large aquarium with a spraying fountain in its window.|$|E

First, a survey was conducted among 39 practitioners, in which the opinion of the practitioners on the use and usefulness of the approaches was evaluated. Second, four case studies were conducted, in which process architectures from practice were analysed to determine the approaches or elements of approaches that were used in their design. Both evaluations showed that practitioners have a preference for using approaches that are based on reference models and approaches that are based on the identification {{of business}} functions or business objects. At the same time, the evaluations showed that practitioners use these approaches in combination, rather than selecting a single approach.

40|$|Companies are {{required}} to understand their customers more in depth in order to answer to the challenges introduced by the growingly complex operating environment. This understanding can be acquired through customer analytics in which the available customer information is analyzed {{with the help of}} advanced analytical applications. This research studied both customer analytics and the <b>business</b> intelligence <b>architecture</b> required to make customer analytics work. The aim of this study was especially to identify the correlation between the <b>business</b> intelligence <b>architecture</b> maturity and the insightfulness of customer analytics. In addition, particularly the application areas of customer analytics producing customer insight, which can be used to increase sales or sustain current sales, were focused on. The research was conducted as a case study including five different case companies. A semi-structured interview was used as a data collection method. Additionally, case descriptions including both the current status of <b>business</b> intelligence <b>architecture</b> and customer analytics in the case companies were created based on these semi-structured interviews. Furthermore, the case descriptions were analyzed in order to evaluate the <b>business</b> intelligence <b>architecture</b> maturity, amount of different application areas of customer analytics, and the level of customer analytics’ sophistication in the case companies. The results of these analyses were then compared to each other creating understanding from the correlation between these three entities. Based on these results a conclusion was drawn that there exists a correlation especially between the use of comprehensive customer information and advanced analytical applications and the insightfulness of company’s customer analytics. Furthermore, there also exists a correlation between the insightfulness of the company’s customer analytics and its ability to use customer information to further increase sales.
