40|$|The TV {{industry}} {{has evolved into}} a multi-sided market in recent years, with distribution platforms increasingly occupying a central position in the market. Whereas until recently their business models resembled that of utility providers, distributors start playing a multi-sided role, liaising with third-party content providers, advertisers and viewers. As a result, we might expect a struggle for platform leadership between TV <b>broadcasters</b> and <b>distributors.</b> This struggle is further intensified by the rise of over-the-top (OTT) TV platforms, which challenge existing power relationships in the TV industry and give rise to conflicts of interests in the media value chain. This paper attempts to provide {{a deeper understanding of the}} platformisation in the TV industry, and explore the levers both TV <b>broadcasters</b> and <b>distributors</b> employ in building power to pursue platform leadership...|$|R

50|$|Due to the {{localization}} process, {{many people}} who grew up watching anime did so not realizing that it originated in Japan. After the success of Power Rangers (which first aired in 1993), U.S. television companies began broadcasting Sailor Moon and Dragon Ball Z in 1995 and 1996 respectively. However, due to the relative failure of the latter two (both shows brought success when aired {{at a later time}} on Cartoon Network), anime did not seem like it would become mainstream. However, the anime boom in the U.S. began with the airing of the anime series Pokémon in syndication in 1998, which served as proof to U.S. <b>broadcasters</b> and <b>distributors</b> that Japanese media could succeed in the U.S. market.

40|$|This article {{explores the}} ways in which smartphones, mobile {{technology}} and media and, with this, the growing practice of viewing and interacting with content on multiple screens and devices, are informing changes to the TV industry and the content it produces in the United Kingdom. The article reflects on how British TV companies, producers and executives understand their role and the types of content that is currently being commissioned and funded within this changing mediascape. Based on industry data from Ofcom and PACT, interviews with producers, commissioning editors and executives as well as participant observation at industry events, the article argues that mobile media is having a profound impact on the British production sector and ecology. In order to understand and describe the players and practices that make up the ‘TV industry’ today, it is now necessary to rethink how content is defined and where it appears. There is also a need to reconsider who the content producers, <b>broadcasters</b> and <b>distributors</b> are within this industry, and include a wider spectrum of producers as well as the telecoms, aggregators and social media networks as funders and distributors of audiovisual content within this ecology. These reconfigurations impact not only on constitution of the TV industry itself, its modus operandi and the content it produces but also on how arts bodies, policymakers and academics need to approach this ecology...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Given {{the recent}} changes in the policy {{governing}} Internet content distribution, such as theinstitution of per listener royalties for Internet radio <b>broadcasters,</b> content <b>distributors</b> now {{have an incentive to}} under-report the size of their audience. Previous audience measurementschemes only protect against inflation of audience size. We present the first protocols for audience measurement that protect against both inflation and deflation attempts by contentdistributors. The protocols trade-off the amount of additional information the content distributors must distribute to facilitate audience inference with the amount of infrastructurerequired and are applicable to Internet radio, web plagiarism, and software license enforcement. 1 Introduction Internet content distributors often want to prove to a third party that they have a large number of vistors or listeners. Such information is usually used to set advertising rates, so content distributors have an incentive to inflate these numbers. Various schemes for preventing content distributors from reporting artificially inflated audience sizes have been proposed [21, 13, 18]. With the advent of per listener royalty fees for Internet radio [15] and the growth of web content plagiarism [11], content distributors now have an incentive to report artificially small audiences, but none of the prior schemes for audience measurement prevent such behavior. We present two new audience measurement protocols which prevent content distributors from reporting artificially deflated audience sizes. Besides the application to Internet radio, these protocols have a variety of uses, as we describe in Section 1. 3...|$|R
25|$|The CRTC's {{simultaneous}} substitution rules {{require that}} when a Canadian network licences a television show from a US network and shows {{it in the same}} time slot, upon request by the Canadian <b>broadcaster,</b> Canadian broadcast <b>distributors</b> must replace the show on the US channel with the broadcast of the Canadian channel, along with any overlays and commercials. As Grey's Anatomy is on ABC, but is carried in Canada on CTV at the same time, for instance, the cable, satellite, or other broadcast distributor must send the CTV feed over the signal of the carried ABC affiliate, even where the ABC version is somehow different, particularly commercials. (These rules are not intended to apply in case of differing episodes of the same series; this difference may not always be communicated to distributors, although this is rather rare.) Viewers via home antenna who receive both American and Canadian networks on their personal sets are not affected by sim-sub.|$|R
50|$|Such {{codes of}} best {{practices}} have permitted communities of practice {{to make more}} informed risk assessments in employing fair use in their daily practice. For instance, <b>broadcasters,</b> cablecasters, and <b>distributors</b> typically require filmmakers to obtain errors and omissions insurance before the distributor will take on the film. Such insurance protects against errors and omissions made during the copyright clearance of material in the film. Before the Documentary Filmmakers' Statement of Best Practices in Fair Use was created in 2005, it was nearly impossible to obtain errors and omissions insurance for copyright clearance work that relied in part on fair use. This meant documentarians had either to obtain a license for the material or to cut it from their films. In many cases, {{it was impossible to}} license the material because the filmmaker sought to use it in a critical way. Soon after the best practices statement was released, all errors and omissions insurers in the U.S. shifted to begin offering routine fair use coverage.|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} a {{corporate}} {{case study of}} major Canadian <b>broadcaster</b> and <b>distributor</b> Alliance Atlantis, {{an examination of the}} company {{in the context of the}} Canadian film and television industry at the end of the twentieth century in order to shed light on what it is to be a mini-major studio and how a company such as Alliance Atlantis responds to changes in the industry in which it operates. In chapter one, I begin with a broad overview of the origins of the film and television production industry in Canada in order to provide context around the founding of Alliance and Atlantis. From there, I trace the growth of the two companies through several key events, up to just before they merged. Chapter two begins with a discussion of various media mergers that had taken place in North America in the 1990 s and 2000 s. The merger of Alliance and Atlantis and the response that that event garnered from the industry is then explored, as is the company's subsequent growth, particularly in the area of broadcasting. I begin chapter three with a discussion of the state of Canada's production industry in the early 2000 s, and then move into Alliance Atlantis' announcement that it was exiting the business of production. The chapter ends with an assessment of how the decision to shut down the production side of its business has paid off for Alliance Atlantis. By the end of this thesis, it is clear that Alliance Atlantis has diverged dramatically from its production origins, and instead identifies itself first and foremost as a broadcaster...|$|R
