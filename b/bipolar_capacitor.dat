25|$|Aluminum {{electrolytic}} capacitors are polarized capacitors {{because of their}} anodization principle. They can only be operated with DC voltage applied with the correct polarity. Operating the capacitor with wrong polarity or with AC voltage leads to a short circuit and can destroy the component. The exceptions is the <b>bipolar</b> aluminum electrolytic <b>capacitor,</b> which has a back-to-back configuration of two anodes in one case {{and can be used}} in AC applications.|$|R
40|$|The {{physical}} {{properties of the}} wide band-gap beta-SiC make it a promising material for future applications in high-power, high-temperature and high-frequency devices. Up to now, SiC has been successfully employed in field effect transistors, <b>bipolar</b> storage <b>capacitors</b> and ultraviolet detectors. In this work, we present new attempts to prepare crystalline beta-SiC at 650 degrees C by means of Pulsed Laser Deposition (PLD). X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) and Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) {{have been used to}} determine the crystalline and morphological properties of the deposited beta-SiC thin films grown on different substrates: sapphire and silicon. The optical constants in the visible range and the band gap energy have been determined by Spectroscopic Ellipsometry (SE) which is a powerful non-destructive technique for high accuracy measurements. SiC thin films deposited on sapphire give rise to hetero-epitaxial growth resulting in an organized structure while the sample deposited on silicon grows polycrystalline. The correlation between the band-gap energy and the crystalline phases and growth conditions will be discussed. (C) 2011 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinhei...|$|R
2500|$|Snubbers are energy-absorbing {{circuits}} used {{to eliminate}} voltage spikes caused by circuit inductance when a switch opens. The {{purpose of the}} snubber is to improve electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) by eliminating the voltage transient that occurs when a switch abruptly opens, or by suppressing sparking of switch contacts (such as an automotive ignition coil with mechanical interrupter), or by limiting the voltage slew rate of semiconductor switches like thyristors, GTO thyristors, IGBTs and <b>bipolar</b> transistors. Snubber <b>capacitors</b> (or higher power [...] "damping capacitors") require a very low self-inductance and very low ESR capacitor construction. [...] These devices are also expected to be highly reliable because, if the snubber RC circuitry fails, a power semiconductor will be destroyed in most cases.|$|R
