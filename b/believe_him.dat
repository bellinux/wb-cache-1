5|$|Because the feats the Baron {{describes}} are overtly implausible, {{they are}} easily recognizable as fiction, {{with a strong}} implication that the Baron is a liar.

In any case, the Baron appears to believe every word of his own stories, no matter how internally inconsistent they become, and he usually appears tolerantly indifferent to any disbelief he encounters in others.|$|E
