5|$|Following the Gator Bowl loss, Virginia Tech {{offensive}} coordinator and quarterbacks coach Rickey <b>Bustle</b> became {{the head coach}} at Louisiana-Lafayette as had been announced prior to the game. His position {{offensive coordinator}} was filled by then-offensive line coach Bryan Stinespring. To fill the quarterbacks coach position vacated by <b>Bustle,</b> Tech hired former Notre Dame offensive coordinator Kevin Rogers.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of December, Virginia Tech's offensive preparations for the Gator Bowl were disrupted when offensive coordinator Gary Tranquill abruptly quit the team in order to join friend Nick Saban, who had been hired as the head coach at Michigan State. Virginia Tech head coach Frank Beamer announced simultaneous with Tranquill's departure that assistant head coach Billy Hite would control the offense during the Gator Bowl. Shortly after the announcement of Tranquill's departure, Virginia Tech announced that former offensive coordinator Ricky <b>Bustle</b> would be returning to the team to fill the position after the Gator Bowl. Though {{he was not able}} to actively coach the team during the Gator Bowl, <b>Bustle</b> offered advice and strategy to Beamer during the weeks before the game.|$|E
5|$|As the day {{of their}} May 9, 1840, wedding approached, some family members still looked upon Houston with {{uncertainty}} and were determined to stop what they believed would be a disastrous union for Margaret. She would not be deterred, however, and the Reverend Peter Crawford officiated over the wedding of Margaret and the man {{with whom she had}} fallen in love. The newlyweds spent their honeymoon week at the Lafayette Hotel before sailing to Galveston, where Nancy and the Bledsoes had already established residences. Houston retained a house he owned in the city named for him, but Margaret had no taste for the hustle and <b>bustle</b> and preferred the lesser-populated Galveston. She and her personal slaves, who had accompanied the newlyweds from Alabama, shared her mother's house while Houston traveled.|$|E

5|$|Both Virginia Tech and Clemson endured {{questions}} about their coaching staffs {{in the weeks and}} months prior to the Gator Bowl. Virginia Tech head coach Frank Beamer was interviewed by North Carolina prior to the end of the regular season, and he debated whether or not to accept that school's head football coaching job. On November 27, one week before Tech's selection by the Gator Bowl, Beamer announced that he would not be departing for North Carolina or any other school. Beamer also was considered for the vacant head-coaching position with the NFL's Washington Redskins, but he also declined that position. Other Virginia Tech football coaches were targeted by teams to fill vacant head-coaching positions. Virginia Tech offensive coordinator Rickey <b>Bustle</b> was interviewed for a job at Toledo, but he declined the position. Virginia Tech defensive coordinator Bud Foster was interviewed for the head-coaching job at Virginia, but he likewise declined the job.|$|E
5|$|The steel-hooped cage crinoline, first {{patented}} in April 1856 by R.C. Milliet in Paris, and {{by their}} agent in Britain a few months later, became extremely popular. Steel cage crinolines were mass-produced in huge quantity, with factories across the Western world producing tens of thousands in a year. Alternative materials, such as whalebone, cane, gutta-percha and even inflatable caoutchouc (natural rubber) were all used for hoops, although steel was the most popular. At its widest point, the crinoline could reach a circumference of up to six yards, although by the late 1860s, crinolines were beginning to reduce in size. By the early 1870s, the smaller crinolette and the <b>bustle</b> had largely replaced the crinoline.|$|E
5|$|Virginia Tech's {{offense was}} {{slightly}} {{worse than the}} national average during the regular season. The Hokies were ranked No. 64 in total offense, averaging 374.09 yards per game. In particular, Tech's passing offense was lacking. That segment of the offense was ranked No. 86, averaging 179.36 yards. This figure was somewhat balanced by the Hokies' rushing attack, which was ranked No. 55 (194.73 ypg). Despite the worse-than-average yardage totals, Tech was ranked No. 25 in scoring offense, or 32.64 points per game. Prior to the Gator Bowl, it was announced that Virginia Tech offensive coordinator Rickey <b>Bustle</b> would be leaving the team to take the same position at the Louisiana-Lafayette. Despite the move, he confirmed he would coach the Hokies during the bowl game in his last act as a Virginia Tech coach.|$|E
