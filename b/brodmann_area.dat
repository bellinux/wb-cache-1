25|$|The {{orbitofrontal cortex}} (OFC) is a prefrontal cortex {{region in the}} frontal lobes in the brain which is {{involved}} in the cognitive processing of decision-making. In non-human primates it consists of the association cortex areas <b>Brodmann</b> <b>area</b> 11, 12 and 13; in humans it consists of <b>Brodmann</b> <b>area</b> 10, 11 and 47.|$|E
25|$|In humans, {{damage to}} the retrosplenial cortex results in {{topographical}} disorientation. Most cases involve {{damage to the}} right retrosplenial cortex and include <b>Brodmann</b> <b>area</b> 30. Patients are often impaired at learning new routes and at navigating through familiar environments. However, most patients usually recover within 8 weeks.|$|E
25|$|Functional neuroimaging {{research}} suggests the insula {{is involved in}} two types of salience. Interoceptive information processing that links interoception with emotional salience to generate a subjective representation of the body. This involves, first, the anterior insular cortex with the pregenual anterior cingulate cortex (<b>Brodmann</b> <b>area</b> 33) and the anterior and posterior mid-cingulate cortices, and, second, a general salience system concerned with environmental monitoring, response selection, and skeletomotor body orientation that involves all of the insular cortex and the mid-cingulate cortex.|$|E
50|$|Many of the <b>areas</b> <b>Brodmann</b> defined {{based solely}} on their {{neuronal}} organization have since been correlated closely to diverse cortical functions. For example, <b>Brodmann</b> <b>areas</b> 1, 2 and 3 are the primary somatosensory cortex; area 4 is the primary motor cortex; area 17 is the primary visual cortex; and areas 41 and 42 correspond closely to primary auditory cortex. Higher order functions of the association cortical areas are also consistently localized to the same <b>Brodmann</b> <b>areas</b> by neurophysiological, functional imaging, and other methods (e.g., the consistent localization of Broca's speech and language area to the left <b>Brodmann</b> <b>areas</b> 44 and 45). However, functional imaging can only identify the approximate localization of brain activations in terms of <b>Brodmann</b> <b>areas</b> since their actual boundaries in any individual brain requires its histological examination.|$|R

The former {{is located in the}} transverse temporal gyrus (<b>Brodmann</b> <b>areas</b> 41 and 42), in the temporal lobe, while the latter is located in the posterior section of the occipital lobe (<b>Brodmann</b> <b>areas</b> 17, 18 and 19).|$|R

2500|$|Much {{research}} has been done recently on the link between music and language, especially singing. It is becoming increasingly clear that these two processes are very much alike, and yet also different. Levitin describes how, beginning with the eardrum, sound waves are translated into pitch, or a tonotopic map, and then shortly thereafter “speech and music probably diverge into separate processing circuits” (130). There is evidence that neural circuits used for music and language may start out in infants undifferentiated. There are several areas of the brain that are used for both language and music. For example, <b>Brodmann</b> <b>Area</b> 47. Levitin recounts how in certain studies, “listening to music and attending its syntactic features,” similar to the syntactic processes in language, activated this part of the brain. In addition, “musical syntax [...] [...] [...] has been localized to [...] [...] [...] areas adjacent to and overlapping with those regions that process speech syntax, such as Broca’s area” and “the regions involved in musical semantics [...] [...] [...] appear to be [...] near Wernicke’s area.” Both Broca’s area and Wernicke’s area are important steps in language processing and production.|$|E

50|$|While the ventromedial {{prefrontal cortex}} {{does not have}} a universally agreed on demarcation, in most sources, it is {{equivalent}} to the ventromedial reward network of Ongur and Price. This network includes <b>Brodmann</b> <b>area</b> 10, <b>Brodmann</b> <b>area</b> 14, <b>Brodmann</b> <b>area</b> 25, and <b>Brodmann</b> <b>area</b> 32, as well as portions of <b>Brodmann</b> <b>area</b> 11, <b>Brodmann</b> <b>area</b> 12, and <b>Brodmann</b> <b>area</b> 13. However, not all sources agree on the boundaries of the area. Different researchers use the term ventromedial prefrontal cortex differently. Sometimes, the term is saved for the area above the medial orbitofrontal cortex, while at other times, 'ventromedial prefrontal cortex' is used to describe a broad area in the lower (ventral) central (medial) region of the prefrontal cortex, of which the medial orbitofrontal cortex constitutes the lowermost part. This latter, broader area, corresponds to the area damaged in patients with decision-making impairments investigated by António Damásio and colleagues (see diagram, and below).|$|E
