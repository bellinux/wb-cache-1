The surrounding area has largely been redeveloped from its 19th-century industrial past. The ditch that originally linked the defences of the fortress to the River Seine had been dug out {{at the start of the}} 19th century to form the industrial harbour of the <b>Bassin</b> de l'Arsenal, linked to the Canal Saint Martin, but is now a marina for pleasure boats, while the Promenade Plantée links the square with redeveloped parklands to the east.|$|E

25|$|Napoleon {{also looked}} after the {{infrastructure}} of the city, which had been neglected for years. In 1802, he began construction of the Ourq canal to bring fresh water {{to the city and}} built the <b>Bassin</b> de la Villette to serve as a reservoir. To distribute the fresh water to the Parisians, he built a series of monumental fountains, the largest of which was the Fontaine du Palmier, on the Place du Châtelet. He also began construction of the Canal Saint-Martin to further river transportation within the city.|$|E

In his haste, Riquet had underestimated the number of rivers that in case of flood would silt up and swell the canal. The barrage of Saint-Ferréol was too small and its supply system was inefficient.|$|E
