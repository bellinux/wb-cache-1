40|$|Methods were devised for the assay of tRNA methylases of rat bone. The {{activities}} of bone tRNA methylases {{are similar to}} those from other mammalian tissues. However, unlike reports on liver methylases, no inhibitors were found in the supernatant fraction from pH 5 precipitate of <b>bone</b> <b>extracts.</b> The effects of vitamins A and D on the methylation of tRNA by cell-free extracts of rat bone were studied. Deficiency of either vitamin resulted in a decrease in the rate and extent of tRNA methylation, whereas the administration of vitamin A to hypovitaminotic-A rats and vitamin D to hypovitaminotic-D rats increased the rate and extent of tRNA methylation. These effects appear to be apart from changes in ribonuclease activity or in concentrations of calcium or magnesium. No evidence of inhibitors of tRNA methylases was found in <b>bone</b> <b>extracts</b> from vitamin-deficient rats nor of activators in <b>bone</b> <b>extracts</b> from deficient rats given vitamin A or D. The pattern of tRNA methylation under conditions of vitamin A or D deficiency was not changed, suggesting a generalized cellular deficiency. It was of significance to find that the specificity for methylation of specific bases in tRNA was different after the administration of vitamin A as contrasted with the effects of vitamin D. The possible significance of tRNA methylation to the biochemical action of the vitamins on bone is discussed...|$|E
40|$|Background: Osteoporosis is a {{condition}} in which the bones become brittle, increasing the risk of fractures. Complementary medicines have traditionally used animal bones for managing bone disorders, such as osteoporosis. This study aimed to discover new natural products for these types of conditions by determining mineral and protein content of <b>bone</b> <b>extracts</b> derived from the Australian wallaby. Methods: Inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopic analysis were used for mineral tests, proteome analysis was using LC/MS/MS and the effects of wallaby <b>bone</b> <b>extracts</b> (WBE) s on calcium deposition and alkaline phosphatase activity were evaluated in osteogenic cells derived from adipose tissue-derived stem cells (ADSCs). Results: Concentrations of calcium and phosphorus were 26. 21 % and 14. 72 % in WBE respectively. Additionally, minerals found were wide in variety and high in concentration, while heavy metal concentrations of aluminium, iron, zinc and other elements were at safe levels for human consumption. Proteome analysis showed that extracts contained high amounts of bone remodelling proteins, such as osteomodulin, osteopontin and osteoglycin. Furthermore, in vitro evaluation of WBEs showed increased deposition of calcium in osteoblasts with enhanced alkaline phosphatase activity in differentiated adipose-derived stem cells. Conclusion: Our results demonstrate that wallaby <b>bone</b> <b>extracts</b> possess proteins and minerals beneficial for bone metabolism. WBEs may therefore be used for developing natural products for conditions such as osteoporosis and further investigation to understand biomolecular mechanism by which WBEs prevent osteoporosis is warranted...|$|E

40|$|Recent studies {{support the}} concept that IGF-binding protein- 5 (IGFBP- 5) stimulates bone formation, at least in part, via IGF-independent mechanisms. To {{evaluate}} this hypothesis further, we evaluated in vitro and in vivo effects of IGFBP- 5 on bone formation parameters using the IGF-I knockout (KO) mouse. Treatment of serum-free cultures of osteoblast clones derived from IGF-I KO mice with recombinant human IGFBP- 5 increased both proliferation and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity in a dose-dependent manner, an effect comparable to that seen with IGF-I. IGF-II levels from media conditioned by osteoblasts derived from IGF-I KO mouse were below those detectable by RIA. To eliminate possible actions of IGF-II, if any was produced by osteoblasts derived from IGF-I knockout mice, the IGFBP- 5 effect was studied {{in the presence of}} exogenously added IGFBP- 4, a potent inhibitor of IGF-II actions in bone cells. Addition of IGFBP- 4 blocked IGF-I– but not IGFBP- 5 –induced cell proliferation in osteoblasts derived from IGF-I knockout mice. Consistent with in vitro results, a single local injection of IGFBP- 5 to the outer periosteum of the parietal bone of IGF-I KO mice increased ALP activity and osteocalcin levels of calvarial <b>bone</b> <b>extracts.</b> The magnitudes of IGFBP- 5 –induced increases in ALP and osteocalcin in parietal <b>bone</b> <b>extracts</b> of IGF-I KO mice were comparable to those seen in C 3 H mice.

40|$|The {{identification}} of the plasminogen activator (PA) types present in bone and the regulation of their activity by parathyroid hormone (PTH) were investigated in cultures of fetal mouse calvariae {{with the use of}} either a chromogenic substrate or a zymographic assay. PA was detected essentially in the tissue extracts of the explanted bones, with only 1 - 2 % of the total activity released in the surrounding culture media. From their electrophoretic behavior compared to PAs of other mouse tissues and from their response to a specific antibody raised against the tissue type PA (tPA), two major molecular species, of 70 and 48 kD were identified as tPA and urokinase (uPA), respectively, a third minor species of 105 kD being likely to correspond to complexes between tPA and an inhibitor; the culture fluids, moreover, contained enzymatically active degradation products of uPA of 42 and 29 kD. The PA activity of the <b>bone</b> <b>extracts</b> was only minimally affected by the addition of fibrinogen fragments to the chromogenic assays. PTH induced bone resorption and stimulated in parallel the accumulation of PA in the tissue; other bone-resorbing agents, 1, 25 -dihydroxyvitamin D 3 and prostaglandin E 2, had similar effects. Densitometric scanning of the zymograms of the <b>bone</b> <b>extracts</b> indicated that PTH stimulated only the production of tPA and had no effect on that of uPA. However, PTH also enhanced the release of uPA (both the 48 kD and the 29 kD forms) from the bones into the media. Although inhibiting bone resorption, calcitonin had no effect on the PTH-induced accumulation of PA in bone or on the release of tPA, but it prevented the PTH-induced accumulation of 29 kD uPA in the culture fluids. Thus these studies support the view that tPA and possibly also uPA may have a role in the physiology of bone; the nature of this role remains to be elucidated, however. status: publishe...|$|E

In this work, we extracted the noncollagenous proteins of fetal rat long bones {{and found that the}} extract contained significant amounts of CSA. The biologic activity of the extract was abolished after trypsin digestion and eluted at 24 and 37 kD on filtration HPLC. The CSA of <b>bone</b> <b>extract</b> and of both HPLC peaks could be inhibited by 3 - 34 and 7 - 34 parathyroid hormone analogs.

Using cleavage assays, gel electrophoresis, and mass spectrometry, we report that OPN is a full-length protein substrate for PHEX. Degradation of OPN was essentially complete, including hydrolysis of the ASARM motif, resulting in only very small residual fragments. Western blotting of Hyp (the murine homolog of human XLH) mouse <b>bone</b> <b>extracts</b> having no PHEX activity clearly showed accumulation of an approximate to 35 kDa OPN fragment that was not present in wild-type mouse bone.

Incubation of Hyp mouse <b>bone</b> <b>extracts</b> with PHEX resulted in the complete degradation of these fragments. in conclusion, these results identify full-length OPN and its fragments as novel, physiologically relevant substrates for PHEX, suggesting that accumulation of mineralization-inhibiting OPN fragments {{may contribute to the}} mineralization defect seen in the osteomalacic bone characteristic of XLH/HYP.

Here we showed in vitro that 17 beta-estradiol (E 2) specifically induced expression of Bmp 6 mRNA in MC 3 T 3 -E 1 preosteoblastic cells and that <b>bone</b> <b>extracts</b> from OVX rats lack BMPs. Next we demonstrated that 125 I-BMP- 6 administered systemically accumulated in the skeleton and also restored the osteoinductive capacity of ectopically implanted DB from OVX rats. BMP- 6 applied systemically to aged OVX rats significantly increased bone volume and mechanical characteristics of both the trabecular and cortical bone, the osteoblast surface, serum osteocalcin and osteoprotegerin levels, and decreased the osteoclast surface, serum C-telopeptide, and interleukin- 6. E 2 was significantly less effective, and was not synergistic with BMP- 6. Animals that discontinued BMP- 6 therapy maintained bone mineral density gains for another 12 weeks. BMP- 6 increased in vivo the bone expression of Acvr- 1, Bmpr 1 b, Smad 5, alkaline phosphatase, and collagen type I and decreased expression of Bmp 3 and BMP antagonists, chordin and cerberus. These results show, for the first time, that systemically administered BMP- 6 restores the bone inductive capacity, microarchitecture, {{and quality of the}} skeleton in osteoporotic rats...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{minimize}} the risk of contamination associated with tissue transplantation, tissue banks commonly chemically treat the tissues whenever possible. As viral inactivation uses agents lethal to microorganisms, it is imperative to assure that chemically inactivated tissue remains biocompatible. In vitro assays can be an effective means to assess the acute cytotoxicity of chemically treated human allografts. We have used different types of cells cultured in the presence of treated tissue extract. A standard cell line, a human fibroblast (WI 38), which was the same for all the samples, was chosen. In addition, as the banked tissues (bone and fascia lata) were prepared to be used in bone or as a dura mater substitute, two other cell types were also used: an osteoblastic cell line (SaOS- 2) and a neuronal cell line (Neuro 2 A). Cytotoxic assessment was performed by qualitative evaluation of cell morphology based on confluence, granulation, vacuolization and swelling analysis. In addition, quantitative methods based on the use of neutral red (NR) and 3 - (4, 5 -dimethylthiazol- 2 -yl) - 2, 5 diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) were assayed. Qualitative and quantitative evaluation of fascia lata and <b>bone</b> <b>extracts</b> did not show deleterious effects on cell cultures. These results show that in vitro methods can be appropriate to select a non-toxic procedure before it is used in the human body and that several strong chemical treatments can result in a tissue suitable for human...|$|E
40|$|Kudzu and {{red clover}} isoflavones are phytoestrogens {{that have been}} {{investigated}} as alternatives to estrogen replacement for treatment of osteoporosis, cardiovascular disease, and neurological disorders. However, the pharmacokinetics of these compounds are not clearly understood. In the present studies, we utilized 14 C-radiolabeled crude isoflavone extracts to track the absorption, distribution, and elimination of kudzu and red clover isoflavones in rats. A dose of approx. 0. 148 MBq (4 ??Ci) of radiolabeled extract {{was found to be}} sufficient to be metabolically tracked in rats using a scintillation counter. Analysis showed radiolabel accumulated in all major tissues, including bones, and that kudzu isoflavone extracts underwent enterohepatic circulation. We then produced a 14 C-radiolabeled kudzu isoflavone-enriched fraction from a high isoflavone yielding kudzu hairy root genotype in vitro, which was used to track the absorption, distribution, and elimination of kudzu isoflavones in rats. Pharmacokinetics showed that kudzu isoflavones were rapidly absorbed, distributed into all tissues including bones, underwent enterohepatic circulation, and was largely eliminated in the urine and feces. Femur <b>bone</b> <b>extracts</b> were analyzed by HPLC-ESI-MS and found to contain puerarin, daidzein, and puerarin glucuronide, which suggests that kudzu isoflavones may {{be able to have a}} role in promoting bone health. To improve kudzu isoflavone yields in vitro for further studies, kudzu hairy root cultures were elicited with acetate and salicylic acid in varied concentrations and treatment durations. However, acetate and salicylic acid failed to significantly improve isoflavone synthesis in kudzu hairy roots...|$|E
50|$|The bone {{morphogenetic}} proteins (BMPs) are {{a family}} of secreted signaling molecules that can induce ectopic bone growth. BMPs {{are part of the}} transforming growth factor-beta (TGFB) superfamily. BMPs were originally identified by an ability of demineralized <b>bone</b> <b>extract</b> to induce endochondral osteogenesis in vivo in an extraskeletal site. Based on its expression early in embryogenesis, the BMP encoded by this gene has a proposed role in early development. In addition, the fact that this BMP is closely related to BMP5 and BMP7 has led to speculation of possible bone inductive activity.As of April 2009, an additional function of BMP6 has been identified as described in Nature Genetics April; 41 4:386-8. BMP6 is the key regulator of hepcidin, the small peptide secreted by the liver which is the major regulator of iron metabolism in mammals.|$|R
