50|$|The Bing test, was {{devised by}} German {{otologist}} Albert Bing (1844-1922) in 1891. The test uses a low-frequency tuning fork {{to test for}} the occlusion effect. The tuning fork can {{be replaced by a}} <b>bone-conduction</b> <b>vibrator</b> in the audiometric Bing test.|$|E
40|$|Objective: Bone-conducted {{vibration}} (BCV) in the midline at the hairline (Fz), {{results in}} short latency potentials recorded by surface electrodes beneath the eyes - the ocular vestibular-evoked myogenic potential (oVEMP). The early negative {{component of the}} oVEMP, n 10, is due to vestibular stimulation, however it {{is similar to the}} early R 1 component of the blink reflex. Here we seek to dissociate n 10 from R 1. Methods: Surface potentials were recorded from the infraorbital electromyogram of 10 healthy subjects, 6 patients with bilateral vestibular loss, 2 with unilateral vestibular loss, 4 with facial palsy and 3 with facial and vestibular nerve lesions on the same side. BCV was delivered at Fz, the inion, the glabella or the supra-orbital ridge using a tendon hammer or a <b>bone-conduction</b> <b>vibrator.</b> Results: Onset latencies of the n 10 evoked by taps at Fz or inion were significantly shorter than the R 1 components of blink responses to supraorbital and glabellar stimuli. Upward gaze increased the amplitude of The n 10 was absent bilaterally in patients with bilateral vestibular loss and beneath the contralesional eye in patients with unilateral vestibular loss, but in both these groups of patients R 1 was preserved. In severe facial palsy the R 1 component was absent or delayed and attenuated ipsilesionally, but n 10 was preserved bilaterally. In subjects with unilateral facial and vestibular nerve lesions (Herpes Zoster of the facial and vestibulocochlear nerves) the dissociation was complete - the ipsilesional R 1 was absent or attenuated whereas the ipsilesional n 10 was preserved. Conclusions: n 10 is distinguished from R 1 by its earlier onset, laterality, modulation by gaze position and dissociation in patient groups. Significance: The n 10 component evoked by BCV at Fz is not the R 1 component of the blink reflex. (C) 2009 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
