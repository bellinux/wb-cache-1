5|$|A {{conservative}} {{force that}} acts on a closed system has an associated mechanical work that allows energy to convert only between kinetic or potential forms. This means {{that for a}} closed system, the net mechanical energy is conserved whenever a conservative force acts on the system. The force, therefore, is related directly to the difference in potential energy between two different locations in space, and can <b>be</b> <b>considered</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> an artifact of the potential field {{in the same way}} that the direction and amount of a flow of water can <b>be</b> <b>considered</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> an artifact of the contour map of the elevation of an area.|$|E

5|$|Properties {{common to}} {{terrestrial}} organisms (plants, animals, fungi, protists, archaea, and bacteria) {{are that they}} are cellular, carbon-and-water-based with complex organization, having a metabolism, a capacity to grow, respond to stimuli, and reproduce. An entity with these properties is generally considered life. However, not every definition of life considers all of these properties to be essential. Human-made analogs of life may also <b>be</b> <b>considered</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> life.|$|E
5|$|Range {{queries are}} also straightforward. Once {{the ranks of}} the two values are known, the number of {{elements}} {{greater than or equal to}} the first value and less than the second is the difference of the two ranks. This count can be adjusted up or down by one according to whether the endpoints of the range should <b>be</b> <b>considered</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> part of the range and whether the array contains keys matching those endpoints.|$|E

5|$|The {{median income}} per {{household}} member was clocked at $24,672 in 2005. This {{means that the}} average Joe earns roughly $32,000 a year, lives in a household with an income of $46,000 with $24,000 of gross annual income per member. Personal income changes considerably over the life-time of the average American, from $28,000 at age 25 to about $42,000 {{at the age of}} 65.

5|$|Besides {{providing}} locomotion {{opportunities for}} winged animals and {{a conduit for}} the dispersal of pollen grains, spores and seeds, the atmosphere can <b>be</b> <b>considered</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a habitat in its own right. There are metabolically active microbes present that actively reproduce and spend their whole existence airborne, {{with hundreds of thousands}} of individual organisms estimated to be present in a cubic metre of air. The airborne microbial community may be as diverse as that found in soil or other terrestrial environments, however these organisms are not evenly distributed, their densities varying spatially with altitude and environmental conditions. Aerobiology has been little studied, but there is evidence of nitrogen fixation in clouds, and less clear evidence of carbon cycling, both facilitated by microbial activity.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the known}} species are little studied. Some 600 species (a quarter of the total) are known from a single record from a single host. Over 94% of species are {{associated}} with mammalian hosts, and only about 3% of species can <b>be</b> <b>considered</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> specific parasites of birds. The fleas on birds {{are thought to have}} originated from mammalian fleas; at least sixteen separate groups of fleas switched to avian hosts during the evolutionary history of the Siphonaptera. Occurrences of fleas on reptiles is accidental, and fleas have been known to feed on the hemolymph (bloodlike body fluid) of ticks.|$|E

5|$|Nitrous oxide (N2O), {{better known}} as {{laughing}} gas, is made by thermal decomposition of molten ammonium nitrate at 250°C. This is a redox reaction and thus nitric oxide and nitrogen are also produced as byproducts. It is mostly used as a propellant and aerating agent for sprayed canned whipped cream, and was formerly commonly used as an anaesthetic. Despite appearances, it cannot <b>be</b> <b>considered</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the anhydride of hyponitrous acid (H2N2O2) because that acid is not produced by the dissolution of nitrous oxide in water. It is rather unreactive (not reacting with the halogens, the alkali metals, or ozone at room temperature, although reactivity increases upon heating) and has the unsymmetrical structure N–N–O (N≡N+O−↔−N=N+=O): above 600°C it dissociates by breaking the weaker N–O bond.|$|E
5|$|The September 11 {{attacks in}} the United States caused NATO to invoke Article5 of the NATO Charter {{for the first time}} in the organization's history. The Article says that an attack on any member shall <b>be</b> <b>considered</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> an attack on all. The {{invocation}} was confirmed on 4October 2001 when NATO determined that the attacks were indeed eligible under the terms of the North Atlantic Treaty. The eight official actions taken by NATO in response to the attacks included Operation Eagle Assist and Operation Active Endeavour, a naval operation in the Mediterranean Sea which is designed to prevent the movement of terrorists or weapons of mass destruction, as well as enhancing the security of shipping in general which began on 4October 2001.|$|E
5|$|Theistic {{evolution}} was {{the idea}} that God intervened in the process of evolution, to guide {{it in such a way}} that the living world could still <b>be</b> <b>considered</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> designed. The term was promoted by Charles Darwin's greatest American advocate Asa Gray. However, this idea gradually fell out of favor among scientists, as they became more and more committed to the idea of methodological naturalism and came to believe that direct appeals to supernatural involvement were scientifically unproductive. By 1900, theistic evolution had largely disappeared from professional scientific discussions, although it retained a strong popular following.|$|E

5|$|In this situation, {{the court}} had decided in {{previous}} cases that immigration detention, {{for the purposes of}} processing and removal, did not infringe on Chapter III. Al-Kateb argued that if indeed the provisions of the Migration Act extended as far as to allow the indefinite detention of people like him, then it would have gone beyond those valid purposes and would infringe Chapter III. That is, non-judicial detention is permitted for the purposes of facilitating the removal of unlawful non-citizens, and if the prospects of removal are remote or impracticable for the reasonably foreseeable future, then the detention can no longer <b>be</b> <b>considered</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> for the purpose of removal. Al-Kateb's argument in this respect relied on a decision of the Federal Court in another case, Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v Al Masri, in which a Full Court of the Federal Court found that a person in a very similar situation to Al-Kateb was entitled to be released.|$|E
