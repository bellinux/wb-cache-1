Knowing that the Orange light is too powerful for them, Jordan returns the lantern to a joyful Larfleeze, who tries to reward them but, due to the Orange Light's influence, is unable to, prompting the three Lanterns to simply leave.|$|R

40|$|Background: <b>Body</b> armour, <b>duty</b> belts <b>and</b> belt mounted {{holsters}} {{are standard}} equipment {{used by the}} Swedish police and {{have been shown to}} affect performance of police specific tasks, to decrease mobility and to potentially influence back pain. This study aimed to investigate the effects on gait kinematics and kinetics associated with use of an alternate load carriage system incorporating a thigh holster. Methods: Kinematic, kinetic and temporospatial data were collected using three dimensional gait analysis. Walking tests were conducted with nineteen active duty police officers under three different load carriage conditions: a) <b>body</b> armour <b>and</b> <b>duty</b> belt, b) load bearing vest, <b>body</b> armour <b>and</b> thigh holster and c) no equipment (control). Findings: No significant differences between testing conditions were found for temporospatial parameters. Range of trunk rotation was reduced for both load carriage conditions compared to the control condition (p <  0. 017). Range of hip rotation was more similar to the control condition when wearing thigh holster rather than the belt mounted hip holster (p <  0. 017). Moments and powers for both left and right ankles were significantly greater for both of the load carriage conditions compared to the control condition (p <  0. 017). Interpretation: This study confirms that occupational loads carried by police {{have a significant effect on}} gait kinematics and kinetics. Although small differences were observed between the two load carriage conditions investigated in this study, results do not overwhelmingly support selection of one design over the other...|$|R
40|$|Reasons for {{performing}} study: Locomotion adaptation mechanisms {{have been observed}} in horses, but little information is available in relation to banked and nonbanked curve locomotion, which might be important to optimise training environments. Objectives: To determine if adaptation mechanisms in horses existed when moving on a banked compared to a flat curve and whether adaptation was similar in different gaits. Methods: Eight infrared cameras were positioned {{on the outside of}} a 10 m lungeing circle and calibrated. Retroreflective markers were used to define left and right metacarpus (McIII) and proximal phalanges (P 1), metatarsus (MtIII), head and sacrum. Data were recorded at 308 Hz from 6 horses lunged at walk, trot and canter on a flat and 10 ° banked circle in a crossover design. Measurements extracted were speed, stride length, McIII inclination, MtIII inclination, relative <b>body</b> inclination <b>and</b> <b>duty</b> factor. Data were smoothed with a fourth order Butterworth filter with 30 Hz cut-off. ANOVA was used to determine differences between conditions and limbs. Results: Adaptation mechanisms were influenced by gait. At canter inside forelimb duty factor was significantly longer (P< 0. 05) on a flat curve compared to a banked curve; at walk this was reversed. McIII inclination, MtIII inclination <b>and</b> relative <b>body</b> inclination were significantly greater (P< 0. 05) at trot and canter on a flat curve, so more inward tilt was found relative to the bearing surface. Conclusion: Adaptation to curved motion is gait specific. At faster gaits it appears that horses negotiate a banked curv...|$|R
40|$|The {{so-called}} ‘Blackwater scandal' - {{a reference}} to the seventeen Iraqi civilians killed on Nisour Square by security guards of the private military company (PMC) Blackwater in September 2007 - puts into question the proposition that private military contractors or ‘mercenaries' could be relied upon to act effectively and responsibly in peacekeeping and other international operations. Arguably, Blackwater's frequently observed callousness, if typical of other Private Military Companies (PMCs), gravely undermines this proposition. After closely analysing the Nisour Square incident and the Blackwater company in a wider context of revealed patterns of violence by the personnel of multiple PMCs, the article concludes that the use of ‘mercenaries' is in principle still possible, doable and defensible - after the necessary reforms and improvements have been made. Yet it remains doubtful whether a sufficient number of PMCs and their personnel are or will become (self-) disciplined, well-trained and trustworthy enough for large, complex and dangerous operations. One certainly should strengthen the (pre) conditions for deploying these ‘contractors' in both international military missions which involve combat <b>duties</b> <b>and</b> operations, and international civilian missions with a military component focused on (<b>body)</b> guard <b>and</b> sentry <b>duties</b> only...|$|R
40|$|Legal studies occupy an {{important}} place in Colleges of Further Education {{as a necessary}} constituent of vocational training for business appointments. At {{the same time the}} ubiquity of legal considerations make such studies invaluable as part of a person's general education. This work is an enquiry into the extent and nature of these studies and an analysis of the information produced in order to test the validity of the many generalisations made concerning the teaching of Law. Both in quantity and in standard of work, Law is comparable with the other basic commercial subjects of Accounts and Economics. It appears in many courses and the characteristics of each will be outlined and discussed, with particular attention paid to national certificate, professional and degree courses and courses provided for the legal profession. Textbooks and library facilities, so important in the ease of Law, will be examined. She following four chapters will be devoted to syllabuses and examinations with emphasis upon the subject General Principles of Law, and its value as a first subject for legal study. Analysis of syllabuses and examination papers shows wide variation as between different examining <b>bodies.</b> Qualifications <b>and</b> <b>duties</b> of full-time <b>and</b> part-time lecturers will be examined together with the problems arising out of their appointment.

5000|$|The first monster truck {{ever built}} was {{a pickup truck}} that was {{modified}} with a larger suspension and larger tires. Today, trucks now have custom built tubular chassis, with four-link suspension to provide up to 4-feet of clearance and they also now have fiberglass bodies that go onto the chassis separately and {{are designed to be}} easily removed and easily replaced when damaged. Mounted just behind the driver on most trucks are the engines, which are typically supercharged and run on methanol, an alcohol and corn-based oil, and have displacement up to 575 cubic inches (9.42 L). Axles are mostly taken from either heavy-duty military trucks or road vehicles like school buses, and are modified to have a planetary gear reduction at the hub to help turn the tires. All trucks have hydraulic steering in both the front and the rear (four wheel steering), with the front wheels controlled by the steering wheel and the rear wheels by a toggle switch. The tires are typically [...] "Terra" [...] tires used on fertilizer spreaders, and have measurements of 66″×43″×25″ (1.7×1.1×0.6 m). Most trucks utilize a modified and/or custom designed automatic transmission, such as a Turbo 400, Powerglide, Ford C6 transmission, or a Torque-flite 727. A limited number of trucks utilize a Lenco transmission, which traces its roots to drag racing. Most of the automatic transmissions are heavily modified with transbrakes, manual valve <b>bodies,</b> <b>and</b> heavy <b>duty</b> gear sets. Trucks running a Lenco use a centrifugal clutch as opposed to a torque converter, which are used in automatic transmissions. Lenco transmissions are usually found in two-speed or three speed configurations, and are commonly shifted using compressed CO2.|$|R

40|$|FSW is a {{solid state}} welding process which is widely used with high {{strength}} Aluminum Alloys (AA) such as AA- 7 xxx series.

In this work, FSW was applied on AA- 7010 using tool rotational speed of 850 rpm at a welding speed of 56 mm/min. The tool axial load was maintained constant within the whole welding runs. The resulting weldments were divided into two groups namely; as-welded and shot-peened conditions. Tensile and axial fatigue testing with stress-ratio (R= 0. 1) were used to evaluate and compare tensile properties and S-N curves of the welded and welded + peened conditions. The weldments were also characterized using optical microscopy, fractography, mechanical and fatigue testing as well as micro-hardness profiles across the weldment...|$|R
