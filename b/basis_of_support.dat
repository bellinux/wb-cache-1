5|$|Maximian {{realized}} {{that he could not}} immediately suppress the rogue commander, so in 287 he campaigned solely against tribes beyond the Rhine instead. As Carausius was allied to the Franks, Maximian's campaigns could be seen as an effort to deny the separatist emperor in Britain a <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>support</b> on the mainland. The following spring, as Maximian prepared a fleet for an expedition against Carausius, Diocletian returned from the East to meet Maximian. The two emperors agreed on a joint campaign against the Alamanni. Diocletian invaded Germania through Raetia while Maximian progressed from Mainz. Each emperor burned crops and food supplies as he went, destroying the Germans' means of sustenance. The two men added territory to the empire and allowed Maximian to continue preparations against Carausius without further disturbance. On his return to the East, Diocletian managed what was probably another rapid campaign against the resurgent Sarmatians. No details survive, but surviving inscriptions indicate that Diocletian took the title Sarmaticus Maximus after 289.|$|E

In the following four weeks, the single dropped in the chart, then jumped from number 21 to number three on 3April 2005, selling 14,701 units that week, through the releases of the CD maxi and vinyl.

He served as a senior officer in the war department in the Tory governments for two decades, but switched over to the Whig coalition in 1830. [...] The Tories despised him thereafter as a turncoat, {{and many of the}} more radical Whigs were distrustful of his basically conservative views that saw him fainthearted or opposed to reform measures. He typically warned on the one hand against delays and [...] on the other hand against excessive enthusiasm for reforms. The solution was a compromise. He was keenly sensitive to public opinion, and indeed often shape it with his dealings with newspaper editors. [...] When he sensed the public demand had reached an unstoppable momentum he would work for a watered-down reform. [...] He routinely gave the same advice to foreign governments. Diplomats across Europe took careful note of his move from Tories to the Whigs, and suspected him of sympathy with the reform movements which were setting off upheavals in France, Belgium and elsewhere, and which frightened the reactionary governments of the major powers Russia, Austria, and Russia. [...] In reality he drew his foreign policy ideals from Canning. His main goals were to promote British strategic and economic interests worldwide, remain aloof from European alliances, to mediate peace in Europe, and to use British naval power sparingly as needed. [...] He worried most about France as an adversary, although he sometime collaborated with them as in securing the independence of Belgium from the kingdom of the Netherlands. [...] He preferred liberal and reform-oriented nations much more than reactionary powers. [...] He placed a high priority on building up strength in India, He spoke often of pride in British nationalism, which found favour in public opinion and gave him a strong <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>support</b> outside Parliament.|$|E

50|$|It {{has been}} speculated that Hadrian {{intended}} to assimilate the Jewish Temple into the civic-religious <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>support</b> to his reign, {{as he had done}} with Greek and other traditional places of worship. It has also been ventured that Hadrian attempted to unify all belief systems in his empire as a coherent whole that would serve as a <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>support</b> for his autocratic legitimacy - a project that had already been devised earlier by Hellenized Jewish intellectuals such as Philo. The neighbouring Samaritans had already undergone such a process of Hellenisation and religious syncretism, integrating their religious rites with Hellenistic ones. Hadrian probably sanctioned this Hellenised Samaritan worship when, after the suppression of the Jewish revolt, he built a temple to the Hellenistic (and probably syncretic) god Zeus Hypsistos ("Highest") on Mount Gerizim. This attempt at conciliation between Judaism and Hellenism foundered when faced with strict Jewish monotheism. Therefore, the Romans appear to have been surprised by the outbreak of the uprising.|$|E

Using election surveys and data on the policy positions and media representation of the political parties from the 1970 s to the 2000 s, the article finds that the Social Democratic Party in Austria maintained a strong working class base. In contrast, the Social Democratic Party in Switzerland facilitated a major transformation <b>of</b> the class <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> its <b>support</b> by emphasising new cultural issues.
