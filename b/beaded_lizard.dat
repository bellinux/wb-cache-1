5|$|The Gila monster has one close living relative, the <b>beaded</b> <b>lizard</b> (H. horridum), {{as well as}} many extinct {{relatives}} in the Helodermatidae, the evolutionary history of which may {{be traced back to the}} Cretaceous period. The genus Heloderma has existed since the Miocene, when H. texana lived, and fragments of osteoderms from the Gila monster have been found in late Pleistocene (10,000–8,000 years ago) deposits near Las Vegas, Nevada. Because the helodermatids have remained relatively unchanged morphologically, they are occasionally regarded as living fossils. Although the Gila monster appears closely related to the monitor lizards (varanids) of Africa, Asia and Australia, their wide geographical separation and the unique features not found in the varanids indicate the Gila monster is better placed in a separate family.|$|E

Though the Gila monster is venomous, its sluggish nature means it represents little threat to humans. However, it has earned a fearsome reputation and is sometimes killed despite being protected by state law in Arizona.|$|E

500|$|Though the Gila monster is venomous, its laggard {{movement}} {{means it}} poses little threat to humans. However, it {{has earned a}} fearsome reputation and is often killed by humans because of fear. Among Native American tribes, the Gila monster had a mixed standing. The Apache believed its breath could kill a man, and the Tohono O'Odham and the Pima believed it possessed a spiritual power that could cause sickness. In contrast, the Seri and the Yaqui believed the Gila monster's hide had healing properties. The Gila monster has even starred as a monster in a B movie, The Giant Gila Monster (though the titular monster was actually portrayed by a Mexican <b>beaded</b> <b>lizard).</b> It played a minor role in the motion picture The Treasure of the Sierra Madre. [...] Myths about the animal include that the animal's breath is toxic enough to kill humans, that it can spit venom and that it can leap several {{feet in the air}} to attack. Another myth held that the Gila monster did not have an anus and therefore expelled waste from its mouth, the source of its venom and [...] "fetid breath". The official mascot of [...] Eastern Arizona College located in Thatcher, Arizona, is Gila Hank, a gun-toting, cowboy-hat-wearing Gila monster. A similar character as an old western outlaw was seen in 2011 animated film Rango, called Bad Bill; the character was voiced by Ray Winstone.|$|E
2500|$|It has {{recently}} been suggested that all snakes may be venomous to a certain degree, with harmless snakes having weak venom and no fangs. Most snakes currently labelled [...] "nonvenomous" [...] would still be considered harmless according to this theory, as they either lack a venom delivery method or are incapable of delivering enough to endanger a human. This theory postulates that snakes may have evolved from a common lizard ancestor that was venomous—and that venomous lizards like the gila monster, <b>beaded</b> <b>lizard,</b> monitor lizards, and the now-extinct mosasaurs may also have derived from it. They share this venom clade with various other saurian species.|$|E
5000|$|The Guatemalan <b>beaded</b> <b>lizard</b> (Heloderma charlesbogerti), {{also called}} the Motagua Valley <b>beaded</b> <b>lizard,</b> is a highly {{endangered}} species of <b>beaded</b> <b>lizard,</b> a venomous lizard endemic to the dry forests of the Motagua Valley in southeastern Guatemala, [...] an ecoregion known as the Motagua Valley thornscrub. It is the only allopatric <b>beaded</b> <b>lizard</b> species, separated from the nearest population (H. alvarezi) by 250 km of unsuitable habitat. The Guatemalan <b>beaded</b> <b>lizard</b> is the rarest and most endangered species of <b>beaded</b> <b>lizard</b> and {{it is believed that}} fewer than 200 of these animals exist in the wild, {{making it one of the}} most endangered lizards in the world.

40|$|Seasonal {{resource}} scarcity {{in the tropical}} deciduous forest (TDF) forces many animals, including <b>beaded</b> <b>lizards,</b> to take refuge in the soil for extended periods of time. To investigate which characteristics may be ideal when resources are less abundant, we measured soil characteristics in habitats used by Mexican <b>Beaded</b> <b>Lizard’s</b> (Heloderma horridum) in the TDF of Jalisco, Mexico. Utilizing a Brownian Bridge Kernel Density Estimation to identify activity centers in both wet and dry season sites, fourteen soil samples were collected in areas where <b>beaded</b> <b>lizards</b> have been observed or had a high probability of being observed. The soil characteristics measured include soil permeability, percent water content, sediment size distribution, and color. Measured habitat characteristics include percent canopy cover, slope, and height of primary vegetation. All samples were collected and measured in the dry season, March 2014. Results indicate that dry and wet season soils differ in sediment size, slope, percent water, and color indicating that soil used in the dry season is different from soil used in the wet. Another notable observation was that all dry season sites had oxidized soil (determined by red color), whereas the wet season sites showed no pattern with respect to soil color...|$|R

50|$|<b>Beaded</b> <b>lizards</b> {{are found}} in the Pacific drainages from {{southern}} Sonora to southwestern Guatemala and two Atlantic drainages, from central Chiapas to southeastern Guatemala.

50|$|The tongue can be {{extended}} outside the mouth, and is often long. In the <b>beaded</b> <b>lizards,</b> whiptails and monitor lizards, the tongue is forked and used mainly or exclusively to sense the environment, continually flicking out to sample the environment, and back to transfer molecules to the vomeronasal organ responsible for chemosensation, analogous to but different from smell or taste. In geckos, the tongue is used to lick the eyes clean: they have no eyelids. Chameleons have very long sticky tongues which can {{be extended}} rapidly to catch their insect prey.|$|R
50|$|Larger species, such as monitor lizards, {{can feed}} on larger prey {{including}} fish, frogs, birds, mammals and other reptiles. Prey may be swallowed whole and torn into smaller pieces. Both bird and reptile eggs {{may also be}} consumed as well. Gila monsters and <b>beaded</b> <b>lizards</b> climb trees to reach both the eggs and young of birds. Despite being venomous, these species rely on their strong jaws to kill prey. Mammalian prey typically consists of rodents and leporids; the Komodo dragon can kill prey as large as water buffalo. Dragons are prolific scavengers, and a single decaying carcass can attract several from 2 km away. A 50 kg dragon is capable of consuming a 31 kg carcass in 17 minutes.|$|R
50|$|While {{invertebrates}} {{are essentially}} {{immune to the}} effects of this venom, effects on vertebrates are more severe and varied. In mammals such as rats, major effects include a rapid reduction in carotid blood flow followed by a marked fall in blood pressure, respiratory irregularities, tachycardia, and other cardiac anomalies, as well as hypothermia, edema, and internal hemorrhage in the gastrointestinal tract, lungs, eyes, liver, and kidneys. In humans, the effects of bites are associated with excruciating pain that may extend well beyond the area bitten and persist up to 24 hours. Other common effects of bites on humans include local edema (swelling), weakness, sweating, and a rapid fall in blood pressure. <b>Beaded</b> <b>lizards</b> are immune {{to the effects of}} their own venom.|$|R

40|$|Research into snake venoms has {{revealed}} extensive variation at all taxonomic levels. Lizard venoms, however, have received scant research attention in general, and no studies of intraclade variation in lizard venom composition have been attempted to date. Despite their iconic status and proven usefulness in drug design and discovery, highly venomous helodermatid lizards (gila monsters and <b>beaded</b> <b>lizards)</b> have remained neglected by toxinological research. Proteomic comparisons of venoms of three helodermatid lizards {{in this study}} has unravelled an unusual similarity in venom-composition, despite the long evolutionary time (~ 30 million years) separating H. suspectum from the other two species {{included in this study}} (H. exasperatum and H. horridum). Moreover, several genes encoding the major helodermatid toxins appeared to be extremely well-conserved under the influence of negative selection (but with these results regarded as preliminary due to the scarcity of available sequences). While the feeding ecologies of all species of helodermatid lizard are broadly similar, there are significant morphological differences between species, which impact upon relative niche occupation...|$|R
40|$|Although {{reptiles}} {{are well}} known for their low energy requirements and high efficiencies of biomass conversion, few studies have addressed the ecology and energetics of species with very low activity levels. I investigated the ecology and energetics of two such reptilian groups: helodermatid lizards, and viperid snakes. I radiotracked Mexican <b>beaded</b> <b>lizards</b> and three rattlesnake species in their natural environments to determine their activity patterns, the time and energy they invest in activity, home ranges, thermal biology, habitat and other resource use, and behavior. I measured metabolic rates in the laboratory to determine rates of energy use. <b>Beaded</b> <b>lizards</b> had a mean home range of 21. 6 ha, an activity peak at 1800 hrs and traveled, on average, 25. 3 km during approximately 121 h of surface activity over the year. They had very low metabolic rates during rest. However, helodermatids had maximal rates of oxygen consumption that were among the highest of any lizard measured, a trait that may be adaptive during their intensive male-male agonistic behaviors. Males had significantly higher capacities for aerobic activity than did females. Heloderma horridum can fulfill its annual maintenance energy requirements with a quantity of prey equivalent to approximately 1. 4 times its body mass. Rattlesnakes had a mean home range size of 4. 6 hectares and traveled, on average, 12. 4 km over approximately 95 hours of annual surface activity. Rattlesnakes spent considerable time inactive on the surface, whereas Heloderma spent {{the vast majority of}} their time resting in shelters. Heloderma and Crotalus had similar body temperature preferences for activity (around 30 C). Like Heloderma, Crotalus had very low rates of metabolism during rest. A 300 -g rattlesnake had a standard metabolic rate only 40 % that of other squamate reptiles of similar mass, and could fulfill its yearly maintenance energy requirements with a prey quantity equivalent to 0. 93 x its body mass, which could be met with 2 - 3 large meals. After feeding, free-ranging rattlesnakes exhibited thermophilic responses that varied, in part, due to their reclusive behavior, and thermal constraints in the environment. The temperatures selected for digesting and activity are apparently similar in rattlesnakes...|$|R
5000|$|The earless monitor lizard was {{described}} in 1878 by Franz Steindachner. The genus name Lanthanotus means [...] "hidden ear" [...] and the species name borneensis refers to its home island of Borneo. The uniqueness of the species was recognized from the start and Steindachner placed it in its own family, Lanthanotidae. In 1899 George Albert Boulenger relegated it to the family Helodermatidae, together with the <b>beaded</b> <b>lizards</b> and gila monster. Further studies were conduced in the 1950s where {{it was found that}} although it is related to Helodermatidae, this relationship is relatively distant, the similarity is in part the result of convergent evolution and they should be recognized as separate families. Both are part of a broader Anguimorpha, but the relationship among the various families has been a matter of dispute. Several earlier studies have placed the earless monitor lizard together with Helodermatidae and Varanidae (true monitor lizards) in Varanoidea. More recent genetic evidence has found that the nearest relative of the earless monitor lizard is Varanidae. Most authorities continue to recognize them as separate families as the divergence between them is deep, but some have suggested that the earless monitor lizard should be included as a subfamily, Lanthanotinae, of the Varanidae. Together they form a clade and its sister group is Shinisauridae; at a higher level the sister groups of these three are Helodermatidae and others families in Anguimorpha. The most recent common ancestor diverged in the mid-Cretaceous.|$|R

40|$|Although adenoviruses (AdVs) {{have been}} found {{in a wide variety of}} reptiles, {{including}} numerous squamate species, turtles, and crocodiles, the number of reptilian adenovirus isolates is still scarce. The only fully sequenced reptilian adenovirus, snake adenovirus 1 (SnAdV- 1), belongs to the Atadenovirus genus. Recently, two new atadenoviruses were isolated from a captive Gila monster (Heloderma suspectum) and Mexican <b>beaded</b> <b>lizards</b> (Heloderma horridum). Here we report the full genomic and proteomic characterization of the latter, designated lizard adenovirus 2 (LAdV- 2). The double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) genome of LAdV- 2 is 32, 965 bp long, with an average G+C content of 44. 16 %. The overall arrangement and gene content of the LAdV- 2 genome were largely concordant with those in other atadenoviruses, except for four novel open reading frames (ORFs) at the right end of the genome. Phylogeny reconstructions and plesiomorphic traits shared with SnAdV- 1 further supported the assignment of LAdV- 2 to the Atadenovirus genus. Surprisingly, two fiber genes were found for the first time in an atadenovirus. After optimizing the production of LAdV- 2 in cell culture, we determined the protein compositions of the virions. The two fiber genes produce two fiber proteins of different sizes that are incorporated into the viral particles. Interestingly, the two different fiber proteins assemble as either one short or three long fiber projections per vertex. Stoichiometry estimations indicate that the long fiber triplet is present at only one or two vertices per virion. Neither triple fibers nor a mixed number of fibers per vertex had previously been reported for adenoviruses or any other virus...|$|R
