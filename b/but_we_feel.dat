500|$|The team {{rested on}} December 29—the day {{following}} their final regular-season game. They began preparations {{for their first}} post-season game on Tuesday, December 30 through Thursday, January 1, before three days of weekend rest. Roethlisberger did not practice until Monday, January 5—Tomlin stated of the injury, [...] "We will proceed slowly with him because we have that luxury. <b>But</b> <b>we</b> <b>feel</b> comfortable with where he is relative to Sunday and where he’s capable of being next week." [...] Although the January 1 practice {{was expected to be}} normal, Tomlin allowed players to leave after team meetings and a walk-through. Multiple Steelers stated that they would watch the games of the Wild Card round. Some including James Farrior and Ryan Clark watched as fans; however, Chris Hoke said, [...] "I will be watching the guys I am going against... That is how I watch it." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{features}} {{the death of}} Jeremy Davies character Daniel Faraday. Daniel {{was introduced in the}} fourth season and was originally intended to be a minor character only. However, his quiet demeanor and seemingly good heart made him a favorite with the fans, so Lindelof and Cuse decided to expand Daniel's role, which has led to him being a key player in Losts eventual resolution. In response to Daniel's death, Cuse said, [...] "It was an incredibly painful thing to kill this beloved character, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>feel</b> that’s what this show has to do. His death is kind of the culminating event in the entire season. It really ends one chapter and commences the start of the final chapter of the entire series." [...] Once the show runners explained that to Davies, he was saddened that his full-time status on Lost was coming to an end, but put the story [...] "above his own personal self". Damon seconded Carlton's emotions, adding that Jeremy took the news well: [...] "When Carlton and I called Jeremy to explain what was going to be happening with Daniel, we’ve never had a more awesome exit interview with somebody on the show. For us, Daniel really was the cornerstone of the fifth season – he really shined. I can’t imagine what Season 5 would have looked like without Jeremy Davies. When you think about all the crazy stuff that had to come out of that guy’s mouth, for him to be as interesting and emotional and poetic as he was is really extraordinary." [...] The cast of the show said Davies would be missed, though he may not be done with Lost — Carlton commented that Jeremy's [...] "full-time" [...] status was over, but dead characters have been known to reappear on the show. Michael Emerson, who plays Ben, said Davies was [...] "a great sensitive guy who got deep into his character, he really lived it." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "Monster" [...] {{received}} general acclaim upon release. Rolling Stone gave Monster {{four and}} a half stars. Critic Robert Palmer noted that Stipe's lyrics dealt with issues of identity ("The concept of reality itself is being called into question: Is this my life or an incredible virtual simulation?") and that occasionally the singer [...] "begins to sound not unlike the proverbial rock star, whining about all those fans who just won't let him alone." [...] He added, [...] "What's truly impressive about Monster is the way R.E.M. make an album with such potentially grave subject matter so much fun." [...] NME gave the album a seven out of ten rating. Reviewer Keith Cameron wrote, [...] "It’s fun, frequently, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>feel</b> distanced, engaged only on a secondhand level. Moreover, the loudly trumpeted fox factor has been conspicuous by its absence." [...] Cameron concluded, [...] "At best stunning, at worst merely diverting, Monster sounds like the album they 'had' to make, to clear out their system, a simple prop to occupy our time..." [...] Allmusic rated the album {{two and a half stars}} out of five; Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote, [...] "Monster doesn't have the conceptual unity or consistently brilliant songwriting of Automatic for the People, but it does offer a wide range of sonic textures that have never been heard on an R.E.M. album before." ...|$|E

Red Shirt presented an image of Native Americans that Europeans could associate with progress, nobility, and civilization. Queen Victoria adored Chief Red Shirt and requested a special command performance. Red Shirt commented to The Brisbane Courier [...] on the future of Natives in the United States. [...] "The red man is changing in every season. [...] The Native of the next generation will not be the Native of the last. [...] Our buffaloes are nearly all gone, the deer have entirely vanished, and the white man takes more and more of our land. But the United States government is good. True, it has taken away our land, and the white man have eaten up our deer and our buffalo, but the government now gives us food that we may not starve. They are educating our children and teaching them to use farm implements. [...] Our children will learn the white man’s civilization and to live like him. [...] It is our only outlook in the future. [...] Now we are dependent upon the rations of the Government <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>feel</b> we are fully entitled to that bounty. [...] It {{is a part of the}} price they pay for the land they have taken from us, and some compensation to us for having killed off the herds upon which we subsisted. [...] For myself, I know it is no use fighting against the United States government. [...] I accept my fate. [...] The red man cannot kill all the white men that live in villages as big as the largest forests. [...] But some of our young men do not know this, and they may perhaps elect to die like their fathers with their tomahawks in their hands rather than starve to death like a dog upon the prairie." ...|$|E
