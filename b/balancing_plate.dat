40|$|Abstract Background More {{than one-third}} of US adults 65 and over fall every year. These falls may cause serious injury {{including}} substantial long-term morbidity (due declines in activities of daily living) and death. The emergency department (ED) visit represents an opportunity for identifying high risk elders and potentially instituting falls-related interventions. The unique characteristic of the ED environment and patient population necessitate that risk-assessment modalities be validated in this specific setting. In order to better identify elders at risk of falls, we {{examined the relationship between}} patient-provided history of falling and two testing modalities (a <b>balance</b> <b>plate</b> system and the timed up-and-go [TUG] test) in elder emergency department (ED) patients. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional observational study of patients ≥ 60 years old being discharged from the ED. Patient history of falls in the past week, month, 6 months, and year was obtained. <b>Balance</b> <b>plate</b> center of pressure excursion (COP) measurements and TUG testing times were recorded. COP was recorded under four conditions: normal stability eyes open (NSEO) and closed (NSEC), and perturbed stability eyes open and closed. Correlation between TUG and COP scores was measured. Univariate logistic regression was used to identify the relationship between patient-provided falls history and the two testing modalities. Proportions, likelihood ratios, and receiver-operating-characteristic (ROC) curves for prediction of previous falls were reported. Results Fifty-three subjects were enrolled, 11 % had fallen in the previous week and 42 % in the previous year. There was no correlation between TUG and any <b>balance</b> <b>plate</b> measurements. In logistic regression, neither testing modality was associated with prior history of falls (p > 0. 05 for all time periods). <b>Balance</b> <b>plate</b> NSEO and NSEC testing cutoffs could be identified which were 83 % sensitive and had a negative likelihood ratio (LR-) of 0. 3 for falls in the past week. TUG testing was not useful for falls in the past week, but performed best for more distant falls in the past month, 6 months, or year. TUG cutoffs with sensitivity over 80 % and LR(-) of 0. 17 - 0. 32 could be identified for these time periods. Conclusion Over 40 % of community-dwelling elder ED patients report a fall within the past year. <b>Balance</b> <b>plate</b> and TUG testing were feasibly conducted in an ED setting. There is no relationship between scores on <b>balance</b> <b>plate</b> and TUG testing in these patients. In regression analysis, neither modality was significantly associated with patient provided history of falls. These modalities should not be adopted for screening purposes in elders in the ED setting without validation in future studies or as part of multi-factorial risk assessment. </p...|$|R

40|$|Revolutionary new {{technology}} that creates balanced conditions {{across the face of}} a multi-hole orifice plate has been developed, patented and exclusively licensed for commercialization. This balanced flow technology simultaneously measures mass flow rate, volumetric flow rate, and fluid density with little or no straight pipe run requirements. Initially, the <b>balanced</b> <b>plate</b> was a drop in replacement for a traditional orifice plate, but testing revealed substantially better performance as compared to the orifice plate such as, 10 times better accuracy, 2 times faster (shorter distance) pressure recovery, 15 times less acoustic noise energy generation, and 2. 5 times less permanent pressure loss. During 2004 testing at MSFC, testing revealed several configurations of the balanced flow meter that match the accuracy of Venturi meters while having only slightly more permanent pressure loss. However, the balanced meter only requires a 0. 25 inch plate and has no upstream or downstream straight pipe requirements. As a fluid conditioning device, the fluid usually reaches fully developed flow within 1 pipe diameter of the <b>balanced</b> conditioning <b>plate.</b> This paper will describe the basic balanced flow metering technology, provide performance details generated by testing to date and provide implementation details along with calculations required for differing degrees of flow metering accuracy...|$|R

The motion estimation technique {{for the analysis}} of video sequences is a coarse to fine procedure based on the block matching algorithm (BMA). The method makes it possible to estimate the movement of selected elements on the scene with a sub-pixel precision.

40|$|AbstractTraditionally, {{the visual}} {{composition}} of food on a plate, or plating, has often {{taken place in}} an intuitive manner. In restaurants, plating is refined through an iterative process until the composition ‘just feels right’, often driven by the experienced whim of the chefs working at the ‘pass’. Increasingly, though, science is starting to deliver insights that could explain, or disconfirm, the chefs’ intuitions and ‘rules-of-thumb’. Recently, researchers interested in the aesthetics of food have started to assess people׳s overall preferences {{when it comes to}} the visual composition of food on the plate, and the impact that this may have on the consumption experience. The research shows that principles borrowed from the visual arts can, to a certain extent, be applied to plating. In experimental aesthetics, one assertion that is often made is that people prefer balanced over unbalanced visual compositions. Here, we report on a series of citizen science experiments conducted at the Science Museum, in London, that demonstrate a clear preference for balanced over unbalanced presentations of exactly the same ingredients over all compositions. This preference for <b>balanced</b> <b>plating</b> is considered in light of the recent trend by many modernist chefs toward asymmetric plating (i. e., when all of the edible elements are crowded onto just one side of the dish) ...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} {{determine}} physical fitness differences in students with different cardiorespiratory endurance levels, a study was conducted on a sample of students of the Faculty of Sport and Physical Education at the University of Nis. The sample was divided into two subsamples, where the first subsample comprised 27 female students and the other 35 male students. Physical fitness was assessed using eight tests from the Eurofit battery of tests: the single-leg balance test - {{for the assessment of}} general <b>balance,</b> <b>plate</b> tapping - for the assessment of speed of movement, sit-and-reach - for the assessment of flexibility, the standing broad jump - for the assessment of explosive strength, the handgrip test - for the assessment of static strength, sit-ups - for the assessment of repetitive trunk strength, the bent arm hang - for the assessment of muscular endurance and the 10 x 5 meter shuttle run - for the assessment of the speed/agility. Cardiorespiratory endurance was estimated with the aid of 20 m endurance shuttle-run test. Based on the level of cardiorespiratory endurance, the participants in each subsample, were divided into three groups using a cluster analysis: high (VKRI), average (PKRI) and low level (NKRI). The physical fitness differences of students with different cardiorespiratory endurance levels were calculated using the one-way analysis of variance. The results showed that there were no differences in physical fitness of students with different cardiorespiratory endurance levels. Based on the results it can be concluded that the level of cardiorespiratory endurance does not affect the components of physical fitness among students of both sexes...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} {{stability of}} physical fitness and physical activity from adolescence into middle adulthood in Flemish females. METHODS: Within {{the scope of the}} Leuven Longitudinal Study on Lifestyle, Fitness and Health, 138 females (mean age= 16. 6 +/- 1. 1 yr) from the Leuven Growth Study of Flemish Girls were seen in adulthood (mean age= 40. 5 +/- 1. 1 yr). Several body dimensions and motor fitness tests were taken. Physical activity was assessed by means of a sports participation inventory. Inter-age correlations were calculated between adolescent and adult values. Cross-tabulation was used to identify the percentage of subjects remaining in the same BMI and physical activity group or shifting from one group to another from adolescence to adulthood. Odds ratios for less activity and overweight in adulthood according to adolescent activity or weight status were calculated. RESULTS: Except for flamingo <b>balance,</b> <b>plate</b> tapping, leg lifts, and arm pull, all anthropometric and physical fitness characteristics were stable from adolescence to adulthood (r ranging from 0. 49 to 0. 96). Sports participation was not a stable characteristic (r= 0. 13). From adolescence to adulthood, 84. 5 and 63. 6 %, respectively, remained in the normal-weight and overweight group, whereas 62. 5 and 54. 4 %, respectively, remained in the less active and active group. The odds of being overweight in adulthood was 9. 53 (95 % CI: 3. 1 - 29. 8) times greater in overweight compared with normal-weight adolescent girls. CONCLUSION: In Flemish females, anthropometric and fitness characteristics demonstrate higher levels of stability from adolescence to middle adulthood than physical activity. Weight status during adolescence is indicative of adult weight status, and a pattern of less activity rather than activity tends to continue from youth to adulthood. status: publishe...|$|R

The inter-teeth space is modeled adopting a two-volumeapproach, properly tailored both for the pump and for themotor units behavior description. In both cases, thecommunications between the interconnected inter-teethvolumes and the high and low pressure ports aresketched as variable equivalent turbulent restrictors; flowareas have been determined as functions of the gearsand of the meshing grooves main design parameters. The inter-teeth pressures, and the leakage flows, arecalculated solving the incompressible and isothermalcontinuity equation, contemporarily applied to bothvolumes and properly combined with the classicalturbulent orifice equation. Successively, for a referenceoperating condition, properly chosen for underlining theinter-teeth meshing cycle and corresponding to a verylow pressure load, the meshing processes of an externalgear pump and of an external gear motor are compared. Among others, the attention is focused on the behaviorof those hydraulic variables more conditioning themeshing cycle, and the differences rising up in interteethpressure peaks and in cavitation interval amplitudeand angular positioning are evidenced. Then, themeshing process analysis is expanded to cover theexternal gear units common operating field, both interms of rotational speed (from 500 to 3000 rpm) and interms of the high pressure port value (from 10 to 250 bar). In all cases, the general trend shows that cavitationhas a deeper influence on external gear pumpsoperation, while external gear motors are subjected tomore significant pressure peaks, particularly markedduring the low pressure part of the meshing cycle.

40|$|Submerged {{arc welding}} (SAW) of {{stainless}} steel to carbon steel plate can produce a number of quality problems. Lack of control of the consumable wire position within the weld preparation can lead to uneven dilution from the parent plates. In addition a relatively heavy but equal dilution from both parent plates will also create problems. In the situation of SAW of duplex stainless steel to carbon steel with a Y weld preparation, which had a 4 mm nose on it, an undesirable situation was created, in which hard zones in the weld metal were observed. In addition, {{it was found that}} a bias of the electrode wire to the carbon steel side of the weld preparation created a situation where excessively high hardness measurements occurred (> 600 HV 10). Those specific regions were found to contain martensite, which was positively identified using selected area electron diffraction in a TEM investigation on thin foils taken from the high hardness region. A V weld preparation with central positioning of the consumable resulted in acceptable hardness levels in the root region combined with a skeletal ferrite microstructure. This allowed the dilution in the root area to be reduced, whilst achieving a <b>balanced</b> parent <b>plate</b> dilution in the remainder of the weld from the SAW process...|$|R
