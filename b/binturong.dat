5|$|According to {{a survey}} in 1989–90, Tripura hosts 90 land mammal species from 65 genera and 10 orders, {{including}} such species as elephant (Elephas maximus), bear (Melursus ursinus), <b>binturong</b> (Arctictis <b>binturong),</b> wild dog (Cuon alpinus), porcupine (Artherurus assamensis), barking deer (Muntiacus muntjak), sambar (Cervus unicolor), wild boar (Sus scrofa), gaur (Bos gaurus), leopard (Panthera pardus), clouded leopard (Neofelis nebulosa), and many species of small cats and primates. Out of 15 free ranging primates of India, seven are found in Tripura; this is {{the highest number of}} primate species found in any Indian state. The wild buffalo (Bubalus arnee) is extinct now. There are nearly 300 species of birds in the state.|$|E
5|$|Other notable mammal {{species in}} the zoo's {{collection}} include oriental small-clawed otters, Asian lions, meerkats, sun bears, Sumatran tigers, giant anteaters, <b>binturong,</b> African wild dogs, Grévy's zebras, greater one-horned rhinoceros, banteng, red river hogs, swamp wallabies, striped skunks, pygmy hippopotamus, Scottish wild cats, Malayan tapirs, white-faced saki monkeys, ring-tailed lemurs, cottontop tamarins, geladas, chinese gorals, red panda, Siberian musk deer, Nile lechwe, grey kangaroo and Barbary macaques.|$|E
25|$|The {{animals of}} Southeast Asia are diverse; {{on the islands}} of Borneo and Sumatra, the orangutan, the Asian elephant, the Malayan tapir, the Sumatran {{rhinoceros}} and the Bornean clouded leopard can also be found. Six subspecies of the <b>binturong</b> or bearcat exist in the region, though the one endemic to the island of Palawan is now classed as vulnerable.|$|E
50|$|<b>Binturongs</b> are omnivorous, {{feeding on}} small mammals, birds, fish, earthworms, insects and fruits. Captive <b>binturongs</b> are {{particularly}} fond of plantains, {{but would also}} eat fowls' heads and eggs. They also prey on rodents. Fish and earthworms are likely unimportant items in their diet, as they are neither aquatic nor fossorial, coming across such prey only when opportunities present themselves. Since {{they do not have}} the attributes of a predatory mammal, most of the <b>binturong's</b> diet is probably of vegetable matter. Figs are a major component of their diet.|$|R
50|$|In captivity, the <b>binturong's</b> diet {{includes}} commercially prepared meat mix, bananas, apples, oranges, canned {{peaches and}} mineral supplement.|$|R
50|$|World of Adaptations (formerly Australasia): it {{features}} animals from Southeast Asia and Oceania, including northern white-cheeked gibbons, emus, Matschie's tree kangaroos, babirusas, and <b>binturongs.</b>|$|R
25|$|There are two {{villages of}} Arem an Ma Coong {{ethnic groups in}} the core zone of the Phong Nha-Kẻ Bàng National Park. Within the buffer zone, there is a {{population}} of 52,000. They are mainly Kinh people and other minority groups of Chut and Van Kieu, many of them exploit forest products as part of their livelihoods. The increase of visitors to this park is also a problem to the park since unexpected pollution (water pollution, rubbish), human impacts on caves and grottos may cause damage to them and especially threaten biodiversity. Hunting is a significant threat to the wildlife because local people have a great consumption demand on wild meat and this has contributed to the significant decrease of species such as the wild pig, <b>binturong</b> and primates. While local authorities have taken no legal action, nevertheless, some civil servants and policemen are the owners of restaurants that serve wild animal meats hunted in this national park. Phong Nha-Kẻ Bàng National Park is currently not meaningful for protection of tigers, Asian elephants, and wild bulls.|$|E
500|$|Slow lorises {{are slow}} and {{deliberate}} climbers, and often {{hold on to}} branches with three of their four limbs. To move between trees, they carefully grip the terminal branches of the neighboring tree and pull themselves across the small gap. They will also grip branches with only their hind feet, lift themselves upright, and quickly launch forward with their hands to catch prey. Due to their slow movement, all lorises, including the slow lorises, have a specially adapted mechanism for defense against predation. Their slow, deliberate movement hardly disturbs the vegetation and is almost completely silent. Once disturbed, they immediately stop moving and remain motionless. In Indonesia, slow lorises are called malu malu or [...] "shy one" [...] because they freeze and cover their face when spotted. If cornered, they may adopt a defensive posture by curling up and lunging at the predator. The Acehnese name, buah angin ("wind monkey"), refers {{to their ability to}} [...] "fleetingly but silently escape". Little is known about the predation of slow lorises. Documented predators include snakes, the changeable hawk-eagle (Nisaetus cirrhatus), and Sumatran orangutans (Pongo abelii). Other potential predators include cats, sun bears (Ursus malayanus), binturongs (Arctictis <b>binturong),</b> and civets.|$|E

50|$|<b>Binturongs</b> are {{confined}} to tall forest.They are not uncommon in the forested plains and hills throughout Assam, but more common in foothills and hills with good tree cover. They have been recorded in Manas National Park, in Dulung and Kakoi Reserved Forests of the Lakhimpur district, in the hill forests of Karbi Anglong, North Cachar Hills, Cachar and Hailakandi Districts.In Myanmar, <b>binturongs</b> were photographed {{on the ground in}} the Tanintharyi Nature Reserve at an altitude of 60 m, in the Hukaung Valley at altitudes from 220 - 280 m, in the Rakhine Yoma Elephant Reserve at 580 m and at three other sites up to 1190 m elevation.In Thailand's Khao Yai National Park, several individuals were observed feeding in a fig tree and on a vine.In Laos, they have been observed in extensive evergreen forest.In Malaysia, <b>binturongs</b> were recorded in secondary forest surrounding a palm estate that was logged in the 1970s.In Palawan, they are found in primary and secondary lowland forest, including grassland-forest mosaic from sea level to 400 m.|$|R

50|$|A hypocarnivore is {{an animal}} that consumes less than 30% meat for its diet, the {{majority}} of which consists of non-vertebrate foods that may include fungi, fruits, and other plant material. Examples of living hypocarnivores are the black bear (Ursus americanus), <b>binturong</b> (Arctictis <b>binturong),</b> kinkajou (Potos flavus) and humans.|$|E
50|$|<b>Binturongs</b> {{are common}} in zoos, and captive {{individuals}} represent a source of genetic diversity essential for long-term conservation.

5000|$|The <b>binturong</b> ( [...] ) (Arctictis <b>binturong),</b> {{also known}} as bearcat, is a viverrid native to South and Southeast Asia. It is {{uncommon}} in much of its range, and has been assessed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List because of a declining population trend that is estimated at more than 30% {{over the last three}} decades.|$|E
50|$|Also in the civet {{family are}} the spotted linsang and <b>binturong,</b> {{which is also}} known as the bearcat.
