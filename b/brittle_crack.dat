The event escalated and the whole bridge disappeared in less than a minute, killing 46 drivers or passengers on the bridge at the time.|$|E
5000|$|Rankine {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{engineers}} to recognise that fatigue failures of railway axles was caused by the initiation and growth of brittle cracks. In the early 1840s he examined many broken axles, especially after the Versailles train crash of 1842 when a locomotive axle suddenly fractured and led to the death of over 50 passengers. He showed that the axles had failed by progressive growth of a <b>brittle</b> <b>crack</b> from a shoulder or other stress concentration source on the shaft, such as a keyway. He was supported by similar direct analysis of failed axles by Joseph Glynn, where the axles failed by slow growth of a <b>brittle</b> <b>crack</b> in a process now known as metal fatigue. It was likely that the front axle of one of the locomotives involved in the Versailles train crash failed in a similar way. Rankine presented his conclusions in a paper delivered to the Institution of Civil Engineers. His work was ignored however, by many engineers who persisted in believing that stress could cause [...] "re-crystallisation" [...] of the metal, a myth which has persisted even to recent times. The theory of recrystallisation was quite wrong, and inhibited worthwhile research until the work of William Fairbairn a few years later, which showed the weakening effect of repeated flexure on large beams. Nevertheless, fatigue remained a serious and poorly understood phenomenon, and was the root cause of many accidents on the railways and elsewhere. It is still a serious problem, but at least is much better understood today, and so can be prevented by careful design.|$|E

40|$|Stress {{enhancement}} in {{the vicinity}} of <b>brittle</b> <b>cracks</b> makes the macroscale failure properties extremely sensitive to the microscale material disorder. As a result, crack propagation is sometimes observed to display a jerky dynamics with seemingly random sudden jumps spanning a broad range of scales, reminiscent of earthquakes. This so-called crackling dynamics cannot be captured via standard continuum fracture theory. The understandings of the key processes that drive such a dynamics then represent a crucial step toward predictive statistical models for heterogeneous brittle failure. In this context, we designed an experimental setup which permits to drive <b>brittle</b> <b>cracks</b> in opening mode at adjustable velocity throughout model materials of adjustable microstructure. During the fracture, both the mechanical behavior and the acoustic emission are recorded in real time, and post-mortem, the morphology of the fracture surface is obtained by profilometry.

5000|$|Common {{features}} that may cause crack initiation are inclusions, voids or empty {{holes in the}} material, contamination, and stress concentrations. [...] "Hachures", are the lines on fracture surfaces which show crack direction. The broken crankshaft shown at right failed from a surface defect near the bulb at lower centre, the single <b>brittle</b> <b>crack</b> growing up into the bulk material by small steps, a problem known as fatigue. The crankshaft also shows hachures which point back to {{the origin of the}} fracture. Some modes of crack growth can leave characteristic marks on the surface that identify the mode of crack growth and origin on a macro scale e.g. beachmarks or striations on fatigue cracks. The areas of the product can also be very revealing, especially if there are traces of sub-critical cracks, or cracks which have not grown to completion. They can indicate that the material was faulty when loaded, or alternatively, that the sample was overloaded at the time of failure.A cusp is formed where brittle cracks meet, as shown on the picture of a failed catheter (Cp). The cusp was formed by brittle failure of the catheter on a breast implant in silicone rubber. The origin of the cracks is at the shoulder at the left-hand side. Identifying such features will allow a fracture surface map to be made of the surface being studied. The implant failed because of overload, all the imposed loads being concentrated at the connection between the catheter and the bag holding salt solution. As a result, the patient reported loss of fluid from the implant, and it was extracted surgically and replaced.|$|E

Once the crack had penetrated the inner bore, fuel started leaking onto the road. Diesel is especially hazardous on road surfaces because it forms a thin oily film that cannot be seen easily by drivers. It is akin to black ice in lubricity, so skids are common when diesel leaks occur. The insurers of the van driver admitted liability and the injured driver was compensated.|$|E

On the other hand, although the local fracture stress concept has been emerging as a factor governing the behavior recently, the local fracture stress has not been evaluated sufficiently because the crack front shape and forming of shear lip have prevent us from implementing accurate FEM analysis of <b>brittle</b> <b>crack</b> propagation. So, we implemented <b>brittle</b> <b>crack</b> propagation tests using specimen with side groove which is designed to increase stress near the plate surface and make the crack front straight.

40|$|Abstract. <b>Brittle</b> <b>crack</b> {{arrestability}} {{is extremely}} important in welded joints of heavy gauge steel plates used in large container ships. Recently, much attention {{has been focused on}} potential crack propagation along welds using large heat input. This paper examines the application of a T-joint to the strength deck structure of container ships to enhance crack arrestability. The crack arrest toughness, Kca, for crack arrest was varied. The ESSO test of T-joint components showed that <b>brittle</b> <b>crack</b> was arrested at the T-joint if the steel plate used for the flange had a high Kca value in the range from 4900 to 7300 N/mm 3 / 2. FE-analysis of the stress intensity factor K indicated that <b>brittle</b> <b>crack</b> propagation was arrested under the condition that the K-value at the running crack tip was less than the Kca of the material. In the T-joint, it was noted that the K-value around the area of the deepest point of the crack decreased and was finally less than the Kca of the flange plate when the <b>brittle</b> <b>crack</b> penetrated suddenly into the flange plate to a 10 mm depth.

40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{this work}} is to {{increase}} the study of the notch translaminar propagation of the woven structures, using the InfraRed Thermography (IRT). A test of notch propagation under quasi-static traction was developed and used to study the failure phenomena on two different draping sequences. For each study, a local estimation of dissipated energies, associated with different damages, is carried out using the measurement of the surface temperature field. The study of heat source fields combined with micrographic observations allowed to define the matrix micro-cracking as the predominant damage phenomenon in crack tip. The critical energy release rate, obtained using IRT, corresponds to critical energy release rate reported in the literature for translaminar rupture of laminates. Furthermore, when <b>brittle</b> <b>cracking</b> develops in a thermosetting matrix laminate, the majority of irreversible mechanical energy (> 90 %) is dissipated as heat.

Especially, the arresting technology of crack propagation is the last stand for the structure. It is so important issue that the conditions which can be stopped reliably crack propagation should be clarified thoroughly. On the background of such social importance, lots of experimental and theoretical researches have been conducted from both mechanical and microstructural viewpoints. Though {{it has been reported that}} the limit speed of <b>brittle</b> <b>crack</b> propagation is the Rayleigh wave speed and the speed is about 2, 900 m/s in steels, the real speed of <b>brittle</b> <b>crack</b> propagation in steels is about 1, 000 m/s and lower. The reason for that is considered braking effects with crack propagation, for example unevenness in the facet, tear ridge, microcrack, twin deformation and side ligament, namely the elements that dominate the arresting toughness. In this study, the 3 % silicon steel where microstructure is ferrite single phase and its grain size is 4 - 5 mm of very large is used. It is assumed that the <b>brittle</b> <b>crack</b> propagation speed in single crystal grain is very fast because there is no need to consider tear ridge between crystal grains. In this experiment, it is succeeded in shooting of brittle fracture of steel by high speed camera. As a result of that, it was revealed that the <b>brittle</b> <b>crack</b> propagation rate of 3 % silicon steel is much lower than ordinary carbon steel.
