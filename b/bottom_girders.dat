40|$|Ship {{collisions}} and grounding represent significant potential incidents {{which may}} result in very unfavorable consequences, such as economic loss, environmental damage and fatalities. In this context, continuous effort is being made by the research community {{for the purpose of}} mitigating or preventing the collision or grounding events from developing into consequences disproportional to the original causes. This continuous concern is exemplified by the successive series of International Conference on Collision and Grounding of Ships (ICCGS), initiated in 1996 in San Francisco and carried over once every three years since 2001 in Copenhagen. The present thesis focuses on the internal mechanics of ships subjected to collision and grounding accidents. Simplified methods for structural analysis are developed as well as their application It is stated in the Foreword of the Proceedings of the first ICCGS, “ Improved techniques for structural analysis will have a profound impact on the design of the ships of the future, enhancing both safety and environmental performance. ”  A significant part of the thesis is dedicated to the development of simplified analytical methods for structural analysis of ships during collision and grounding. In many cases, it is essential that the structural performance of ships during accidents can be evaluated quickly, e. g. in a decision support system for ships in emergency or critical situations or in a rational design procedure, where the structural crashworthiness of ships in a large number of accident scenarios needs to be assessed. Compared to empirical methods, experimental methods and non-linear finite element methods (NLFEM), simplified method based on plastic mechanism analysis is considered the most suitable and advanced method in such circumstances. Web girders represent a category of important components in double and single hull ship structures. Accordingly, the behavior of web girders during collision and grounding is investigated comprehensively. Depending on the loading scenarios, two types of deformation modes are identified, namely local denting and sliding deformation.  An improved theoretical model for local denting is proposed, taking into account important deformation features that have not been considered by the existing models. The first plastic mechanism for the sliding deformation mode of web girders is developed. This mode is especially geared to the analysis of ship grounding over blunt type seabed obstructions where longitudinal <b>bottom</b> <b>girders</b> are subjected to continuous sliding process. It is also relevant for side stringers during sliding collision. It is recognized that the shape and size of the striking object are of crucial importance with respect to the structural damage of ships during collisions and grounding. As for ship grounding, three major types of underwater obstructions have been defined according to the characteristics of damage occurred during grounding, namely “ rock”, “reef” and “shoal”. Most existing studies of ship grounding to date are concerned with “rock” type, sharp obstruction. An integrated simple tool is established to assess the strength of double bottom grounding over blunt seabed obstructions with large contact surface such as “shoal”. The simple method is composed by the proposed and existing simplified methods for individual structural members. Good correlation between the simplified analysis and numerical simulation is obtained. Though the response of plates under patch load was initially investigated for ships navigating in ice conditions, it is also of interest for ship collision or stranding analysis {{due to the fact that}} the damage is generally local. The resistance of patch loaded plates is derived by extending the classical “roof-top” or “envelope” yield line model. Further, a new yield line pattern, “double-diamond”, is proposed. It gives better prediction in the plastic bending phase. More importantly, the present formulation includes the resistance due to membrane effect when significant permanent deformation is developed. This is especially useful for plate design or damage estimation when abnormal/rare actions such as collisions are considered. Numerous crashworthy structural concepts have been proposed, notably in the past two decades. However, any of such novel concepts will have a long way to go from being accepted to being applied. This necessitates studies on ways to improve the structural crashworthiness under the present design regime. Applying the formulation developed for plates under partial lateral loads, a direct and simple design procedure is established for strengthening the side hull against large impact loads. By considering the ductility limit of the material consistently, a simple expression relating the stiffener spacing directly to the allowable permanent deformation has been derived. Eventually, the required plate thickness is simply connected to the material yield strength and the stiffener spacing. The design procedure follows the principles of the accidental limit state (ALS) criterion and the strength design principles adopted by the NORSOK standard for design of offshore steel structures. The attractiveness of the design approach is that it is based on closed-form solutions for plating and stiffeners. As the design load, the collision force is represented by a relatively simple pressure-area relationship. The procedure is demonstrated and verified by the design of a ship-shaped FPSO tank side structure subjected to collision from a 7, 500 tons displacement supply vessel.       PhD i marin teknikkPhD in Marine Technolog...|$|E
50|$|The same rail {{has been}} tested to 80 t axle {{loadings}} for mainline use, {{and can be used}} in tunnels and other locations where the loading gauge is restricted. Replacing flat <b>bottom</b> <b>girder</b> rails on sleepers and ballast with LR55 in tunnels can increase the head room by a minimum of 300 mm, without the need to excavate the tunnel invert. A method statement to undertake this transformation allows contractors to proceed on an incremental basis without closing the tunnel to rail traffic. Temporary transition rails link flat bottom and LR55 rails, until the conversion is completed. The extra loading gauge can then be used to install overhead electrification, or to move larger rail vehicles. These can include double deck passenger trains and freight trains with high cube (9 ft) maritime containers.|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{quantify}} the influence of temperature changes on integral abutment bridge movements, thirty-two Sokkia RS 30 N reflective targets were strategically attached to a bridge along its length. These targets were surveyed every month for twelve consecutive months. These changes in length coincided with restraint conditions between purely fixed and simply supported. Movement of expansion joints was also recorded. The movements of the expansion gaps at opposite corners appear to exhibit similar movements. This behavior indicates a type of twisting motion occurring within the bridge {{as a result of}} unequal movements at the east and west sides of each abutment. This motion suggests that the bridge abutments experience forces that incite weak axis bending in the abutments, especially in the north abutment. These quantitative bridge movements were compared to predicted behavior from a finite-element model. A detailed finite-element model of the bridge was created using SAP 2000 (Computers and Structures, Inc.) software. The detailed model was developed using solid elements for all components of the bridge except piles and bents. Longitudinal surface springs were placed at the abutment elements in order to simulate the soil-abutment interaction. A typical temperature load was assigned to the bridge deck and girder elements to compare the calculated stress concentrations in the model with the observed cracking on the abutment. The model produced high stress concentrations in the abutment adjacent to the <b>bottom</b> <b>girder</b> flange. This corresponded to the same location of observed cracking. The finite-element model also showed lateral movement of the north abutment. This lateral abutment contributed to the unequal movements of the bridge spans. Once the comparison between the measured bridge behavior of the survey and the findings of the detailed finite element model was completed, a simplified model was used to evaluate the bending moment and stresses in the abutment of the 400 South Street Bridge. The simplified model was also used to perform a parametric study on the influence of skew, span length, and temperature gradient on weak-axis abutment moments...|$|R

40|$|A {{new steel}} girder bridge system was {{developed}} at the University of Nebraska. The innovative girder design is a box girder folded from a single steel plate that has a trapezoid shape with an opening on the <b>bottom.</b> The <b>girder</b> has application in short span bridges and accelerated construction situations. The structural performance of the girder requires investigation in all stages of a bridge’s lifecycle. This thesis contains descriptions and results from the first two tests {{from a series of}} tests developed to evaluate this new girder shape. The objective of these two tests was to investigate the constructability of the girders. During construction a bridge is in its least stable condition and {{it is important that the}} bridge components exhibit both adequate strength and stability during this critical stage. To this end, two girders were tested in flexure over a simple span as a non-composite beam simulating the loading the girders would be subjected to during construction. The results of the two tests indicate that the folded girder as a whole, and its components, provide adequate strength and stability at construction load levels. Failure occurred at loads that were above normal construction load levels and resulted in a ductile failure mode, which is a well documented benefit of steel components. The girders remained stable through all phases of loading including failure. The top flange was the weakest component of the beam during construction due to its role as a compression element that has a slender and un-braced form. The compression in the top flange caused local buckling in the top flange even at elastic load levels. This was the cause for loss of stiffness and failure in both specimens. Incorporation of a ridge at the center of the top flange of specimens, results of which are not reported in this thesis, proved to resolve this very early buckling issue...|$|R
40|$|The dynamic {{flexural}} behaviour of railway bridges {{is influenced by}} the torsional behaviour, and the flexural response tends to be amplified as the flexural natural frequency (the 1 st vibrational mode) and torsional frequency (the 2 nd vibrational mode) are adjoining. To avoid this phenomenon, the installation of concrete segment panels was considered for the reinforcement of torsional stiffness by connecting <b>bottom</b> flanges between <b>girders.</b> This alternative can increase the torsional stiffness by providing the restraint in torsional vibration and reduce the influence of torsional behaviour on the amplification of flexural responses. This study investigates the effect of the concrete segment panels on the control of torsional dynamic responses and on the increment of torsional frequency. The excitation tests on a full-size bridge specimen with 30 m span length were conducted with respect to the installation length of concrete panels up to 7 m from each ends. The results show that the installation of concrete segment panel augments the torsional frequency up to 22 % while the flexural frequency keeps its original value. It is concluded that the dynamic behaviour of girder bridges can be controlled by the adjustment of installation length of concrete panels, thereby reducing the torsional responses...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to analyze the temperature and shrinkage stresses of the mid-span cross-section of a 20 meters box girder to find the reasons which cause the longitudinal cracks in the web and <b>bottom</b> of box <b>girder.</b> According to the results of damage inspeation, there are many longitudinal cracks in the web and bottom slab of box girders, especially the web of the edger beam, the crack is very clear. Ansys ver. 10 software is used to analyze two dimensional finite element model of a typical cross section of a real bridge to calculate the temperature stresses caused by temperature difference between inside and out side of the box and the shrinkage stresses based on moisture diffusion. The results of analysis show that the outer surface of the web and bottom slab of the fabricated box girder will produce tensile stress at the effect of negative temperature difference. If the concrete reaches a certain age, the tensile stress does not cause creaks in the cross-section. The shrinkage stress changes with the moisture gradient in the box section. It will reach the maximum in 15 days and then decreases with the growth of the age. Shrinkage stress may cause cracking of the concrete surface because of the tensile strength is low in the early age...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new strengthening concept proposed for road bridges {{in the project}} SUREBridge (Sustainable Refurbishment of Existing Bridges), co-funded by the European Commission through the ERA-NET Plus Infravation 2014 Call. The project proposes an innovative and holistic refurbishment approach by using fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) materials. The approach is designed for bridge upgrading, including repair and strengthening actions in {{the most effective and}} efficient way in terms of reducing construction time, resource consumption, and traffic disruption. SUREBridge concept consists of bonding prestressed carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) laminates to the tensile parts of flexural members (such as <b>bottom</b> flange of <b>girders),</b> and installing glass fiber reinforced polymer (GFRP) panels to the compressive parts (such as top of the existing concrete deck). A novel prestressing system is used to apply prestressed CFRP laminates eliminating the need for mechanical anchorage of the composite strips. The GFRP panels contribute by increasing the overall bending stiffness of the section and unloading the compressive concrete which might not be in a good condition. The GFRP panels are fabricated in a robust modified sandwich-type that ensures load-spreading onto the concrete. The bespoke design of the decks allows for widening the bridge and the incorporation of a curb to avoid further water ingress to the concrete substructure. The effectiveness of the proposed technique is demonstrated through lab test of the stepwise prestressing method and a case study of strengthened prototype beams. Furthermore, a theoretical model has been set up to predict the strengthened cross section’s ultimate bending moment...|$|R
40|$|Some time ago, we have {{developed}} a computer programme called PRECON 3 D for a three-dimensional non-linear analysis of reinforced and prestressed concrete structures where the structures are discretized by three-dimensional finite elements with an embedded one-dimensional element of reinforcement and prestressed tendons. Non-linear triaxial behaviour of concrete {{is involved in the}} material model, including all dominant influences in concrete (yielding in compression, fracture in tension, softening and hardening). The non-linear behaviour of reinforcement and prestressed tendons is described by the one-dimensional elasto-viscoplastic model. The tendon element geometry is described by the second order space function which is determined by its projections. Programme PRECON 3 D can be used very simple because the material model is defined by elementary material parameters (Young’s modulus, Poisson’s coefficient, maximal uniaxial tensile and compression stresses, coefficient of tensile correction, maximal tensile and maximal compression strains). Furthermore, the developed model makes it possible to compute prestressing structures in phases including losses caused by friction and the losses which result from the concrete deformation. In the described analyses we have performed the numerical testing of the prestressed concrete girders from the engineering practice (prefabricated element), which were reinforced with various cross-sectional area of prestressed reinforcement and various tendons geometry. During analyses next parameters were observed: deflections of the girders, concrete stresses and strains at the top and <b>bottom</b> of the <b>girders,</b> compressive and tensile strains of the reinforcement.

40|$|Righman McConnell, Jennifer E. While it {{is known}} that bridges have the {{capacity}} to easily sustain loads greater than their design loads, a codified method for quantifying this reserve capacity that accounts for the three-dimensional structural behavior does not exist. This state of practice is the overall motivation for this research. Cross-frames have been shown to significantly influence the load distribution behavior that leads to significant reserve capacity. Furthermore, it is also known that the role of cross-frames becomes more significant in skewed and curved bridges and also that the skew angle influences the reserve capacity. Thus, this research aims to quantify the forces in cross-frames of two in-service skewed, steel I-girder bridges and calibrate corresponding finite element models that accurately capture these forces. Two bridges of varying skews, SR 1 over US 13 and SR 299 over SR 1, both located in New Castle County, Delaware, were selected for field testing. Cross-frames and girder locations were instrumented and the bridges were load tested with a weighed truck. Overall between the two bridges, the field tests captured data for 11 cross-frames and 6 girder locations. For the bridge with less skew, SR 299 over SR 1, the maximum bottom flange stress was 1. 7 ksi while the maximum cross-frame stress is of similar magnitude, 1. 5 ksi. For the more-heavily skewed bridge, SR 1 over US 13, the maximum bottom flange stress was 1. 5 ksi while the maximum cross frame stress is more than double this value, 3. 6 ksi. This suggests that the potential for cross-frame yielding is an important consideration in determining the reserve capacity of steel bridges. Finite element models of each bridge were created and calibrated based on results from the field tests in order to accurately capture the forces in the structure. The finite element model for SR 1 over US 13 predicted stresses at <b>bottom</b> flange <b>girder</b> locations within 20 % of the field test results. Cross-frames with a pinned connection to the stiffener were shown to result in the best representation of the cross-frame stresses, but future work is needed to further explore this connection. Hand calculations of the expected stress in the bottom flange according to American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials specifications matched the finite element model for SR 299 over SR 1 well, but the bridge behavior captured during the field testing differs from conventional expectations. Further work is needed to identify the source of this unexplained behavior and more accurately calibrate this model. The knowledge gained from these efforts can be used in future work to more broadly study the three-dimensional behavior of steel I-girder bridges. Specifically, through calibrating a FEA technique in this work, additional finite element analysis exploring additional variables can be carried out in future work.

40|$|A {{number of}} {{prestressed}} concrete I-girder bridges {{built in the}} past several decades have demonstrated the ability of precast, prestressed spliced girder bridges to compete with structural steel plate girder bridges in the 120 ft– 300 ft span range. Some states limit the maximum transportable length of a member to 120 ft and the weight to 70 tons. Others, including Nebraska, have permitted lengths up to 175 ft and weights up to 100 tons. ^ When span lengths exceed the maximum shippable length or weight, however, girder segments must be spliced at intermediate locations in the girder away from the piers. ^ There are several other ways to extend the span capacity limits of standard products. These include using high strength concrete, establishing moment continuity for superimposed deck and live loading, and utilizing pier geometry to allow longer spans. Each of these methods is discussed and examples are provided. ^ This dissertation discusses the design and construction of spliced-girder bridges. Design theory, post-tensioning analysis and details, segment-to-segment joint details and examples of recently constructed spliced-girder bridges are given. ^ In recent years the trend towards increased span capacity of girder bridges has continued due to the need for improved safety and fast bridge replacement. Precast concrete members must now span further while minimizing the superstructure depth in order to compete favorably with a new breed of high performance structural steel I-beams. This dissertation presents four systems for creating continuous spliced concrete I-girders. ^ For continuous large span precast prestressed concrete spliced I-girder bridges, the optimum solution is often a haunched girder system. Because of the need to use standard sizes as repetitively as possible and to clear overhead obstructions during shipping, a separate precast haunch block attached to the <b>girder</b> <b>bottom</b> flange is used to form a deeper section for the negative moment zone. ^ This dissertation summarizes an extensive theoretical and experimental research into the feasibility of splicing a haunch block onto a standard I-girder to form an efficient negative moment zone. ...|$|R
40|$|Accelerated Bridge Construction (ABC) {{utilizing}} precast components {{continues to}} be used as an effective tool for bridge construction due to time and cost saving techniques as well as the reduction of environmental impacts. However, in seismic regions, the use of precast members and ABC methods are limited due to concerns about poor performance of connections primarily between cap beam and girders. With sponsorship from the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans), two alternative connections between precast bulb tee girders and bridge cap were designed utilizing extended girder prestressed strands. The connections were designed to resist positive moments at the girder to cap connection. Positive moments occur at the connection when seismic forces cause upward deflection of the precast girders resulting in tension forces along the <b>bottom</b> of the <b>girder</b> to cap connection. The tension forces cause damage to the connection and can also unseat or disconnect the girders from the cap beam resulting in span collapse. The two connections were designed to minimized connection damage and prevent unseating of the girders. In one connection the extended strands were curved and relied on bond strength for anchorage along the 60 in. embedment length. The other connection consisted of spliced strands with anchor plates and chucks which relied on the transfer of forces through strand splices. Both connections also included three grouted dowel bars placed through the girder web. The connections were designed to provide adequate seismic moment resistance up to a combined load of gravity, horizontal ground acceleration corresponding to the column overstrength moment, as well as shear and moment values up to 0. 5 g vertical acceleration. A 40 % scale test unit was constructed in the Iowa State University structures laboratory and the two connections were tested. An analytical model was formulated to analytically quantify the behavior of each connection. The results of the tests showed that both connections had adequate capacity to resist horizontal and vertical ground acceleration forces as specified in current Caltrans seismic design criteria. Adjustments were made to the analytical model based on results of the test to improve the accuracy of the model. The overall results of the test demonstrate that ABC methods can be safely implemented in high seismic regions and be relied upon for dependable performance...|$|R
40|$|Corrosion induced {{deterioration}} {{is one of}} {{the main}} reason for repair and rehabilitation programs in conventional steel reinforced concrete bridge decks. Of all bridges in the United States, over 50 percent are constructed of conventional reinforced or prestressed concrete (NACE, 2013), where one in three bridges are considered structurally deficient or functionally obsolete due to corrosion of the steel reinforcement. According to NACE International (2013) the annual cost of corrosion-related maintenance for highway bridges in the U. S. is estimated at $ 13. 6 billion. Over the past couple of decades, fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) bars have been noted by researchers and engineers as a corrosion-resistant alternative for either conventional reinforcing steel or prestressing strands. High strength-to-weight ratio, corrosion resistance, ease in placement of the bars and accelerated implementation due to light weight are the special characteristics that make these bars an appealing alternative. Up to this end, extensive research has been conducted on the structural performance of FRP reinforced concrete beams and slabs; however, less attention has been paid to FRP reinforced concrete bridge girders in composite action with the bridge deck. Accounting for the effect of composite action between the bridge girder and deck can significantly impact the structural performance of the girder including the load and deformation capacities as well as the failure mode. Therefore, separate tests of the FRP concrete beams and slabs may not be sufficient to study the structural behavior and to provide design guidelines for engineers. This thesis presents the experimental and analytical investigations on structural performance of a full-scale AASHTO I-girder Type I, reinforced and prestressed with aramid fiber reinforced polymer (AFRP) bars, where the bridge girder is composite with the deck. The major objectives of this research were to develop a reliable prestressing anchorage system, examine the constructability of the full-scale specimen, study the load and deformation capacities, determine whether or not the design criteria per AASHTO LRFD were met, and improve the performance of the specimen by adjusting the prestressing layout. The specimen was constructed at a prestressing plant in San Marcos, Texas and tested at the High Bay Structural and Material Testing Laboratory on the campus of Texas A&M University. The cross-section of the bridge girder was composed of self-consolidating concrete with a total of 24 prestressed and 8 non-prestressed AFRP bars. The bridge deck consisted of a 203 mm (8 in.) conventional steel reinforced concrete slab. A flexure test was conducted to determine the moment-curvature relationship, flexure load capacity, and failure mode. The test was conducted as a simply supported, four point bending test in order to create a region of constant moment at the center of the beam. Two shear tests were conducted to determine the shear capacity, failure mode, maximum strain in the web, and moment-curvature relationship. The shear tests were conducted as a simply supported, three point bending test with varying load placement. The results of these tests were compared to a similar study which investigated the structural performance of a conventional steel reinforced AASHTO I-girder Type I with topping deck (Trejo et al. 2008). The specimen was also analyzed analytically to determine the effect on performance of varying the prestressing ratio of the separate layers in the bottom flange of the girder. The goal of this analysis was to determine an optimal prestressing layout to improve the performance at the ultimate state, while still satisfying serviceability limits. The prestressing ratio of the layers were varied from 0 to 50 percent in 5 percent increments to study the moment and curvature at both the cracking and ultimate states, along with the available compressive stress due to prestressing at the <b>bottom</b> of the <b>girder.</b> The results of this research confirms that the experimental specimen showed adequate strength and deformation capacities, satisfying the AASHTO LRFD design criteria. Additionally, the experimental specimen showed significantly greater cracking when compared to the conventional steel reinforced specimen, which is an early warning of impending failure. It was also determined that reducing the prestressing ratio of the AFRP bars in the lower layers improves the ductility of the specimen. The moment capacity can also be improved depending on the prestressing layout. However, reducing the prestressing ratio of the bottom layers causes the cracking moment and available compressive stress at the <b>bottom</b> of the <b>girder</b> to diminish. In order to compensate for this loss, the non-prestressed bars in the web can be prestressed. The optimal prestressing layout features the bottom three layers of the specimen prestressed to 35, 40, and 45 percent of their ultimate capacity, and two of the three layers of middle bars prestressed to 50 percent of their ultimate capacity...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the flow structure under a partially inundated bridge deck measured by using particle image velocimetry (PIV) and flow visualization techniques. The approaching flow was subcritical having Froude number Fin the range 0. 12 similar to 0. 55. The proximity ratio P-r(= ratio of clearance below the bridge deck h {{to the total}} depth of deck D) was varied from 0. 57 to 2. Depending upon the Froude number F and proximity ratio P-r, four types of flow structures under the bridge deck were recognized. In flow Type I, the water surface elevation on the downstream side of bridge deck is slightly lower than the counterpart on the upstream side, and the shear layer formed at the <b>bottom</b> of upstream <b>girder</b> continuously fluctuates and touches soffit of all girders. In the case of flow Type II, the water surface on downstream side of bridge deck is lower than that on the upstream side and the shear layer originating from the upstream girder impinges near the third cavity between girders. However, in both the cases, the cavities between the girders are completely occupied by vortices. On the contrary, {{in the cases of}} flow Type III and flow Type IV, the flow is separated from the upstream girder edge. However, in flow Type III, the separated flow impinges on successive girders and cavities are partially filled by water; while in flow Type IV, the flow is totally separated from the deck bottom like orifice flow. The phenomena of vortex formation within the cavities are discussed for the cases of flow Type I and flow Type II. Also, for the vertical distribution of mean streamwise velocity in the shear layer below bridge deck, the nonlinear regression equations are developed. Using the distributions of measured mean streamwise velocity within the shear layer below the bridge deck at different streamwise distances, the similarity profile is obtained. The mean velocity deficit (u(sl) - u(su)) and representative thickness b(s) are considered as the appropriate characteristic velocity and length scales for developing similarity profile. The proposed characteristic scales provided unique similarity profiles having promising regression coefficient. The similarity profile proposed is suitable for more general case of bridge deck having different bridge girders and even for rectangular block without girder. Further, the turbulence characteristics for the flow below the bridge deck are also presented...|$|R
40|$|Demand {{continues}} to increase for bridges with long spans and shallow depths. Due to safety concerns, four-span overpasses are being replaced with two span overpasses to avoid placement of piers near the highway shoulders. In the meantime, the bridge profile is restricted due to existing businesses nearby. Thus, nearly the same superstructure depth must be used for double the span length. This dissertation focuses on topics aiming at providing precast prestressed concrete girders with the shallowest possible depth for a given span. It forms parts of larger projects conducted by the University of Nebraska for the Nebraska Department of Roads and for the Wire Reinforcement Institute. Specifically, the following issues were researched: (1) Use of 0. 7 in. diameter Grade 270 ksi strands for pretensioning of precast concrete girders at a strand spacing of 2 inches by 2 inches. This arrangement gives nearly 190 percent of the prestressing with 0. 5 in. diameter strands and nearly 135 percent with 0. 6 in. strands. The research focuses on the required confinement steel to allow determination of transfer and development lengths according to current procedures in the AASHTO LRFD Bridge Design Specifications for smaller strands. (2) Develop a self consolidating concrete (SCC) mix, using Nebraska aggregates that will allow for a specified design strength at service of 15 ksi and a minimum strength at one day of 10 ksi, representing the demand {{at the time of}} release of the prestress to the concrete member. Prior to this study, standard concrete strength prevailing in Nebraska has been 8 ksi at service and 6. 5 ksi at release. It was the goal of the research to keep the cost of materials as low as possible but not exceeding $ 250 per cubic yard, compared to the proprietary mixes that cost approximately four times this amount. (3) Use of 80 ksi welded wire reinforcement (WWR) as the auxiliary reinforcement for shear, web end splitting and flange confinement. This would result in higher quality product, less reinforcement congestion, about 25 percent savings in the steel materials, and considerable savings in girder fabrication costs. ^ A combination of theoretical and experimental work has resulted in the following findings: (1) A shear friction model can be used to estimate the required amount of confinement of the bottom flange. (2) A reasonable reinforcement detail is needed, even with very heavily prestressed NU I <b>girder</b> <b>bottom</b> flange, to allow use of the current methods of estimating strands transfer and development lengths. (3) Two SCC mixes with materials costs less that $ 200 dollars per cubic yard and with the required strengths were able to be developed. The mixes exhibited excellent flowability and predictable engineering properties. (4) Grade 80 WWR was successfully used. Its shear resistance was theoretically predictable. It produced higher capacity than the Ultra High Performance steel fiber concrete demonstrated by the Federal Highway Administration, with much lower costs and conventionally predicable design strength. ...|$|R
