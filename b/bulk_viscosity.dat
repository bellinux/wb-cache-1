40|$|Magnetohydrodynamics of {{strongly}} magnetized relativistic fluids {{is derived}} in the ideal and dissipative cases, {{taking into account}} the breaking of spatial symmetries by a quantizing magnetic field. A complete set of transport coefficients, consistent with the Curie and Onsager principles, is derived for thermal conduction, as well as shear and <b>bulk</b> <b>viscosities.</b> It is shown that in the most general case the dissipative function contains five shear <b>viscosities,</b> two <b>bulk</b> <b>viscosities,</b> and three thermal conductivity coefficients. We use Zubarev's non-equilibrium statistical operator method to relate these transport coefficients to correlation functions of equilibrium theory. The desired relations emerge at linear order in the expansion of the non-equilibrium statistical operator with respect to the gradients of relevant statistical parameters (temperature, chemical potential, and velocity.) The transport coefficients are cast in a form that can be conveniently computed using equilibrium (imaginary-time) infrared Green's functions defined with respect to the equilibrium statistical operator.
