50|$|However, {{with the}} onset of globalized {{industry}} and Mexico's transition from an agricultural economy to one revolving around services and manufacturing, the ideas about women and work have been shifting dramatically. Women now see a way that they can participate in the market economy to make extra money for their families, and still are able to maintain the additional work they do at home which has no monetary value. As men are migrating for other, mostly industrial, work opportunities and agrarian work is decreasing, women have come to dominate the textile industry, which caters mainly to tourists.

5000|$|The purported {{main goal}} of {{workfare}} is {{to generate a}} [...] "net contribution" [...] to society from welfare recipients.

Welfare-to-work programs aim to break the cycle of poverty in which welfare dependence can <b>become</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>life.</b> Workfare participants may retain certain employee rights throughout the process, however, often workfare programs are determined to be [...] "outside employment relationships" [...] and therefore the rights of beneficiaries can be different.|$|E
5000|$|A {{grey area}} may exist when {{payments}} to smooth transactions are made. United States law is particularly strict in limiting {{the ability of}} businesses {{to pay for the}} awarding of contracts by foreign governments; however, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act contains an exception for [...] "grease payments"; very basically, this allows payments to officials in order to obtain the performance of ministerial acts which they are legally required to do, but may delay in the absence of such payment. In some countries, this practice is the norm, often resulting from a developing nation not having the tax structure to pay civil servants an adequate salary. Nevertheless, most economists regard bribery as a bad thing because it encourages rent seeking behaviour. A state where bribery has <b>become</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> is a kleptocracy.|$|E

There was a great emphasis on the respect of authority and the love of their country, their countrymen, and their corps. They were expected to live their lives in every respect according to the gendarme oath, the “gendarme ten commandments,” and their motto of “faithfully, honorably, valiantly,” (“Híven, becsülettel, vitézül”).

50|$|Boyd Bode {{was the son}} of Henry Bode and Gertrude Weinenga. His {{father was}} a {{minister}} of the First Christian Reformed Church and he also farmed. In 1848, his family was part of a religious migration of Germans to the United State. In the 1870s his family bought farm land and moved to Iowa. Bode had seven younger brothers and sisters and {{he was the only one}} to pursue an education. He earned his degree in 1896 from William Penn College in Oskaloosa, Iowa. Bode achieved another A.B. at the University of Michigan. He then earned his Ph.D. at Cornell University in 1900. Bode married Bernice Ballard and had two children in 1903. Bode’s realistic approach to educational philosophy mimicked that of John Dewey. From 1900 to 1909 he was a professor of philosophy and philosophy of education at the University of Wisconsin. He left Wisconsin and moved to Illinois to become involved in the university’s department of education. While at the University of Illinois he published An Outline of Logic, which in the field of philosophy, launched him into becoming a young scholar. Bode received a great compliment and was asked to come to Ohio State University to become a professor in education and head the Department of Principles and Practices of Education. This was his first time not teaching philosophy and instead education. However, he continued preaching the philosopher’s cynicism and concern for logic while teaching education. Instead of a typical lecture during class, Bode approached a different way of teaching by questioning and challenging his students. He was very well liked by his colleagues and this is shown in a quote from Ralph Tyler who worked with him at Ohio State University, “My admiration for his keen intelligence, his persistent questioning, and his ready wit led me to become a good friend of Bode’s.” This quote shows just how well liked and admired Bode was for his significance to education. In 1927, he came out with another triumphant publication titled Modern Educational Theories. Bode felt school and education was to be the establishments which allowed social equality to <b>become</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>life.</b> He made this clear in two more publications titled Democracy as a Way of Life and Progressive Education at the Crossroads. Bode retired in 1944 and had several bridge jobs taking positions in Cairo, Egypt, and several universities as a teacher. In 1946 he accepted an offer of being the graduate lecturer in philosophy at the University of Florida where he spent the rest of his life until his death in 1953.|$|E
5000|$|As {{the drummer}} with The Small Faces, Faces and The Who, Kenney Jones {{has been at}} the heart of three biggest bands ever to have come out of the UK. From the moment Jones began {{drumming}} in the front room of his parent’s home in Stepney, East London, he knew music would {{play a central role in}} his life. At the age of just 15, being part of a band had <b>become</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>life.</b> In 1965 when Jones was 16 he had his first hit record when he shot to fame with The Small Faces, who were at the heart of the Mod revolution which swept Britain at the time, and a band who have been cited as a major influence on musicians during the 50 years which have followed. When The Small Faces split Jones was instrumental in forming The Faces and inviting Rod Stewart to feature as lead singer in a line-up which also included Ronnie Wood, Ian McLagan, and Ronnie Lane. The Faces took the rock world by storm in the early 1970s on both sides of the Atlantic and became one of the most raucous, fun-loving bands of the time, with a fanatical following. The Faces split in the mid-1970s and Jones along with Steve Marriott, Ian McLagan and new man, Rick Wills, re-form The Small Faces, touring for a couple of years and making two albums before deciding to call it a day. By this time Jones was recognised as one of the top drummers in the rock industry, and it was no surprise that he was The Who’s choice to replace Keith Moon after his tragic death in 1978. Once again Jones found himself part of a hugely successful band as The Who toured the world and recorded new albums, Face Dances and It’s Hard. After leaving The Who, Jonesy hooked up with former Bad Company singer Paul Rodgers to form The Law in the early 1990s, releasing a critically acclaimed album, The Law, which reinforced Jones'’s reputation as a gifted and talented musician. Although The Small Faces, Faces, The Who and The Law have been the four main bands in his life, Jones has also been much sought-after during his career and has performed with some of the biggest names around. He has recorded a single of his own called [...] "Ready or Not", and has appeared on many albums including those by The Rolling Stones, Andy Fairweather Low, Joan Armatrading, Marsha Hunt, Mike Batt, Pete Townshend, Chuck Berry, Jerry Lee Lewis, David Essex, John Lodge and Wings.|$|E
