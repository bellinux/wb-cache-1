50|$|It {{was assumed}} in the Hyde Amendment that <b>billable</b> <b>hours</b> would be capped at $125 per hour. However, since {{the work done}} {{in this case was}} by highly-paid attorneys, the rate of <b>billable</b> <b>hours</b> was {{considerably}} higher than $125. Judge Merryday scrutinized the 11,251 <b>billable</b> <b>hours</b> submitted by Cohen and associates and subtracted only 310 hours from the total. Cohen argued that because of the complexity of the case and its successful outcome, the rate of <b>billable</b> <b>hours</b> should be multiplied by three. (That is a standard practice in civil cases.) The judge declined to multiply the fees but agreed that a substantial increase in fees was warranted in this case, setting an important precedent, as an increase in fees had never previously been allowed in a Hyde Amendment case.|$|R
50|$|Using {{data from}} the National Association for Legal Career Professionals (NALP) a system of report cards and rankings of law firms has been created.

Rankings cover an array of information {{that is important to}} future lawyers including firms’ minimum <b>billable</b> <b>hour</b> requirements, average associate hours worked, demographic diversity, average pro bono hours, and the number of part-time attorneys.|$|E
5000|$|Lawyers {{are paid}} for their work {{in a variety of}} ways. In private practice, they may work for an hourly fee {{according}} to a <b>billable</b> <b>hour</b> structure, a contingency fee (usually in cases involving personal injury), or a lump sum payment if the matter is straightforward. Normally, most lawyers negotiate a written fee agreement up front and may require a non-refundable retainer in advance. Recent studies suggest that when lawyers charge a fixed-fee rather than billing by the hour, they work less hard on behalf of clients and client get worse outcomes. [...] In many countries there are fee-shifting arrangements by which the loser must pay the winner's fees and costs; the United States is the major exception, although in turn, its legislators have carved out many exceptions to the so-called [...] "American Rule" [...] of no fee shifting.|$|E

40|$|This article {{discusses}} {{the unintended consequences}} of the <b>billable</b> <b>hour</b> derby and suggests changes to address the deleterious effects of increasing <b>billable</b> <b>hour</b> requirements. A brief introduction identifies law firms’ recent tendency to increase the <b>billable</b> <b>hour</b> requirements to fund the heightened salaries of associates. This article analyzes the results from an empirical study focused {{on the effects of}} <b>billable</b> <b>hour</b> expectations and firm cultures. Part I generally reviews the study findings. Part II {{discusses the}} work and report of the ABA Commission, while Part III indentifies those issues and approaches that the ABA and firm managers should explore.

40|$|This Article {{addresses}} the frustration with billable hours in large law firms. The Author gathered empirical data {{to gauge the}} short and long-term effects of increases in <b>billable</b> <b>hour</b> expectations. An empirical {{study was conducted in}} 1999 - 2000 of associate satisfaction, law firm culture, and billing practices. The Article compares these findings to a 2005 NALP study on billable hours and a Work-Life split. 	The Article concludes by considering what forces and players will change the current course of conduct in which law firm leaders treat increases in billable hours expectations as a necessary evil. The studies show the costs and consequences of <b>billable</b> <b>hour</b> pressure. The Author offers solutions to fix the <b>billable</b> <b>hour</b> culture...|$|E
40|$|Although <b>billable</b> <b>hour</b> {{pressure}} {{has taken a}} toll on partners as well as associates, associates {{appear to be the}} most disenchanted casualties of the <b>billable</b> <b>hour</b> derby. In discussing attorney dissatisfaction, some authors have relied on the results of studies of law students and attorneys, noting that there is a limited amount of empirical data {{on the state of the}} profession. In an attempt to help fill the gap, I conducted an empirical study to gauge the effects of <b>billable</b> <b>hour</b> pressure and practices on the current crop of associates. The information obtained in my study provides guidance in both analyzing problems and formulating workable solutions. For example, one expert asserts that attorneys generally will not accept lower compensation to work less because lawyers tend to be competitive and driven. Another perspective is that Generation- X associates appear to be a different breed of attorney desiring a balance in their work and personal lives. Associates 2 ̆ 7 opinions enable academics, law firm managers and bar leaders to intelligently evaluate current concerns and shepherd the future of the legal profession. Part I briefly describes the survey design and the general profile of the survey respondents. Part II discusses current billing practices and pressures analyzing the study results related to billing expectations and guidance as well as firm culture and work alternatives. Using findings from the study, Part III considers the detrimental micro and macro effects of increasing <b>billable</b> <b>hour</b> expectations. Finally, Part IV proposes various steps and measures that can be taken to address the negative consequences of emphasizing <b>billable</b> <b>hour</b> production...|$|E

40|$|This article {{looks at}} the ethical and {{diversity}} implications of high <b>billable</b> <b>hour</b> requirements. While corporate counsel have increasingly demanded a diverse legal workforce and emphasized the need to lower the costs of outside counsel, law firms have not responded to these concerns {{in a manner that}} is producing results. Instead, women continue to drop out of law firm practice at higher rates than their male counterparts and the costs of legal services remain high. High <b>billable</b> <b>hour</b> requirements exacerbate both these problems and have implications as well for ethical lawyering. Using data from a variety of disciplines, the article shows that not only do high <b>billable</b> <b>hour</b> requirements make large law firms difficult places for women to succeed, but they also foster work environments that are inefficient and therefore cost clients more. This has implications on a lawyer 2 ̆ 7 s ethical duty not to discriminate based on sex and not to charge an unreasonable fee, and also increases the potential of lawyers making mistakes. Studies of lawyers suggest that high <b>billable</b> <b>hour</b> requirements exacerbate the difficulties women have in practice, especially for those women who have family responsibilities. This leads to high dropout rates from law firm practice that hurt both law firms and their clients. Lowering billable hours will increase the possibility that women will succeed in these workplaces while making lawyers more efficient. Using studies of sleep deprivation and sleep restriction, this article explores what clients are getting for their money from sleep-deprived high <b>billable</b> <b>hour</b> lawyers. It is clear that both sleep deprivation and chronic sleep restriction impair the average person 2 ̆ 7 s ability to function on many levels [...] including neurocognitive performance that has important implications for lawyering. In addition, studies of workplace productivity have shown that limiting working hours can actually increase productivity. Thus, limiting hours logically should produce more efficient and ethical lawyering while making law firms more feasible work environments for women...|$|E
