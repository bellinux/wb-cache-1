50|$|The Pakamatic was {{introduced}} in 1959 and utilised an aluminium alloy body which was left un-painted. A single reciprocating packer plate compacted the refuse which was discharged by rearward tipping of the body. The design was by Fernand Rey and was produced under licence to Semat-Rey of France. The Pakamatic proved to be highly popular with customers. The 'N designation denotes a narrow <b>bodied</b> <b>vehicle.</b>|$|E
50|$|SCY 786 X is an SD PN Revopak. It was {{purchased}} new by the Isles of Scilly Council in 1982. The 'N' denotes {{that it is}} a narrow <b>bodied</b> <b>vehicle</b> (just 6 ft. 8 ins. wide) suited to the narrow streets of St. Mary's. The body is the shortest available at 9 cu. yds. capacity giving an overall length of 19 ft. 7 ½ ins. The vehicle gave good service on the island but required a replacement cab as the atmosphere on the Isles of Scilly is heavily salt laden.|$|E

50|$|The train's two dining {{cars have}} been {{replaced}} over the years. Dining Car 1, {{which used to be}} a Gresley kitchen car, was damaged in a shunting incident on depot and, as a wooden (Teak) <b>bodied</b> <b>vehicle</b> was deemed unsafe to continue passenger operations, it was withdrawn from mainline service. It was followed in 1992 by Pullman car Raven, acquired {{at the same time as}} the others in the train. Dining Car 2 used to be 99131, an ex-LNER SC1999 c0ach named Victory. It was replaced by the Pullman car Swift, which was acquired in 2011 and converted by Assenta Ltd in Scotland.|$|E
5000|$|The Type M's first presentation, at the 1923 Motor Show, was {{accompanied}} by a press release which boasted that [...] "Audi is one of those German automakers that believes doing the job properly is more important than price" [...] („Die Audi-Werke zählen zu jenen deutschen Automobilfabriken, welche die Preisfrage hinter die konstruktive Aufgabe zurückstellen“). [...] This approach may have helped to win the car more admirers, but paying customers were harder to find. The Type M came with a manufacturer's recommended retail price of 22,300 Marks for a large six-light [...] "Pullman-Limousine" [...] <b>bodied</b> <b>vehicle.</b> The car was expensive and reportedly brought Audi very close to bankruptcy. 228 were produced, plus two prototypes.|$|E

50|$|In June 2012 No. 93 was {{approved}} for main line operation, {{even though the}} re-introduction of wooden <b>bodied</b> <b>vehicles</b> had not been allowed for many years, and was subject to restrictions to reduce the possibility of collisions and any subsequent damage. Since then No. 93 has run on various railways including the Bodmin and Wenford, the South Devon, and the Looe branch (Network Rail).|$|R
5000|$|A {{rear body}} roll cage was fitted in all {{conventionally}} <b>bodied</b> <b>vehicles</b> and some Wolfs were later upgraded {{with an extra}} front roll cage. It {{is worth noting that}} this [...] "roll cage" [...] is not mounted to the chassis, merely the rear body tub and has questionable benefit were the vehicle subjected to being rolled over. The specially designed Ambulance bodied Wolfs have no such protection.|$|R
50|$|SCORE Class 1 is an open-wheel unlimited-class that competes in the SCORE {{off-road}} race series {{including the}} Baja 1000, Baja 500, San Felipe 250 and the SCORE Desert Challenge. Class 1 {{is defined as}} an unlimited four-wheel single and two-seat <b>vehicles.</b> No production <b>bodied</b> <b>vehicles</b> allowed in this class. Engines must be normally aspirated.

5000|$|Hermann Graber died in 1970 and the {{production}} of special bodied cars at Wichtrach came to an end. About 800 Graber <b>bodied</b> <b>vehicles</b> had by now been produced. The business continued to operate under the control of his widow, specialising now in the repair and maintenance of car bodies. Between 1980 and 1996 the Graber business held a franchise as an official Ferrari importer. In 2001 the residuum of the business was acquired by a well-known Swiss classic car restorer named Markus Scharnhorst, and relocated to Toffen.|$|R
50|$|The Train's owner, Richard Edmondson {{had refused}} to sell which left L&R with {{little choice but to}} {{purchase}} a replacement Train, a task which was accomplished over the winter of 1989/90. With the replacement Royal Scotsman now formed by mostly steel <b>bodied</b> <b>vehicles,</b> the original wooden bodied vintage cars were relaunched as The Queen of Scots, with both Trains departing Edinburgh on tours of the Scottish Highlands during the summer of 1990. Unfortunately, that same year, the Gulf war broke out and large numbers of American tourists ceased travelling to the UK which left bookings for both Trains short of expectations.|$|R

50|$|Construction on {{the tunnel}} began in 1999, and opened to traffic in June 2003. As {{part of the}} {{developing}} Indus Highway system, the tunnel serves as a shorter, alternate route to the Kohat Pass, situated between the cities of Peshawar and Kohat. The new route decreases {{the time required to}} travel through the Kotal Pass by about 20 minutes. The main advantage of the tunnel is that long <b>bodied</b> <b>vehicles</b> can now use the Indus Highway whereas previously the hairpin bends on the Kotal Pass made it impossible for such vehicles to travel. It also helps alleviate traffic congestion, improve traffic safety and promote economic development.|$|R
50|$|In 1953, {{another four}} trolleybuses {{of the same}} model {{were added to the}} fleet. They were {{numbered}} from 214 to 217. In the same year, nine Alfa Romeo 900 AF <b>vehicles,</b> <b>bodied</b> by Piaggio and with Ansaldo electrical equipment, came into circulation in La Spezia. Their fleet numbers were 218 to 226.|$|R
50|$|The Arbel (also called Loubières, Loubière, Symétric, Symétric-Paris, or Arbel-Symétric) was a fiber-glass <b>bodied</b> hybrid petrol-electric <b>vehicle</b> {{produced}} by the Compagnie Normande d'Etudes pour l'Application de Procédés Mécaniques made as individual models from 1951 to 1953 and again 1957 to 1959. Only a limited number were made throughout the period, mainly for experimentation or prototyping.|$|R
50|$|The first <b>vehicle</b> <b>bodied</b> by TVAC was R101 NBV, a DAF 55 truck, for the Lancashire Fire and Rescue Service, {{the brigade}} {{that covered the}} area that TVAC's factory is located in. This body {{had a number of}} {{technological}} innovations. The bodies were made with injected resin, and were an integral unit containing the main body and water tank. This made the appliance lighter, and also left more room for storage compartments.|$|R
50|$|In {{the period}} of the early 1950s new {{technological}} motive power was introduced onto Queensland Railways, when the first diesel-electric locomotives (DEL) arrived from the General-Electric Company. The new motive power was revolutionary and did not require the labour-intensive maintenance and preparation, nor produce the dirty environment of steam locomotives. The first DELs to be shedded at Rockhampton were in 1966, for use on export coal traffic. Prior to this DELs were worked through on the main line from Brisbane to Cairns. Diesel-electric locomotives were serviced at a separate location in the Rockhampton yard. With the introduction of the new technology, withdrawals of steam locomotives took place. The final steam locomotive was overhauled in Rockhampton Workshops in 1969. The roundhouse was officially closed to steam traction on 29 September 1969.Following closure as a steam depot the roundhouse was then used as a wagon repair and maintenance centre from 1969 until 1988 for wooden <b>bodied</b> <b>vehicles.</b> The roof was completely rebuilt in 1976-8 with hardwood timber being used to replace original pine framing. In 1982-3 in several stalls old concrete slabs were replaced with mass concrete, following complaints from employees. Carriage lifting gear and machinery was also installed at this time, as a partial modernisation of the working environment. In 1983 an office for subforemen was also built into one of the stalls in the roundhouse. In 1988 one of the bays was converted into a store area for breakdown equipment. The roundhouse was utilised as a wagon repair shop until 1990. In 1992-3 as part of a $20 million redevelopment of the Rockhampton Workshops, an administration complex was inserted into two bays of the south- eastern axis of the roundhouse, adjacent to the entry/exit road.|$|R
5000|$|Rat - The Rat was a {{fiberglass}} <b>bodied</b> three-wheeler off-road <b>vehicle</b> made in {{the early}} '70s. There were two models, the Rat and the Rat Truk-R. The Rat had a red body and came with a 5 HP Tecumseh engine. The Truk-R had silver metal flake body with a pickup style bed. It came with a larger 8 HP Tecumseh engine. (Rat catalog reference) The Rat used some mini bike parts in its construction, including the turbine style 6" [...] front wheel.|$|R
50|$|The first {{production}} Roadliners {{began to}} enter service during 1966. Early UK Roadliner customers were corporations in Wolverhampton and Sunderland, independents West Riding Automobile Company, Wakefield, Yorkshire and AA Motors, Ayr. PMT’s first production batch arrived in 1966-7. By {{the end of}} production in 1972 a total of 333 Roadliners had been built, besides the UK, examples had gone to Australia, Belgium, Canada, Poland, South Africa, Spain and Switzerland. Plaxton <b>bodied</b> the most <b>vehicles</b> overall and the largest export territory was South Africa, who took the last examples built.|$|R
5000|$|The {{original}} {{price of the}} car had been promoted at [...] "less than 300 pounds"; however, {{by the time the}} company was formed and before production had commenced it had already risen to an estimated 430 pounds. In January 1950 it was revealed that the car would cost [...] "less than 500 pounds" [...] inclusive of sales tax. By March 1951 no cars had been delivered and the company revealed that the expected pricing was now [...] "549 pounds plus sales tax" [...] meaning that the total purchase price would be [...] "less than 600 pounds". [...] The first aluminium <b>bodied</b> Pacific Convertible <b>vehicles</b> sold in April 1952 cost 695 pounds including sales tax.|$|R
50|$|MerseyRider began life in {{the autumn}} of 1992 as a {{low-cost}} operation set up by Merseybus a few months prior to the sale to privatisation. MerseyRider operated on lower margins and what would prove controversial pay-rates than Merseybus and initially operated out of Liverline's former Blackstock Street depot near Liverpool City Centre after Liverline had moved to a new depot in Bootle. Many of Merseybus's Merseytravel contracts were transferred to MerseyRider as well as Liverline's commercial service 102 (Walton/Broadway - Broadgreen Hospital). At first the fleet included Merseybus's remaining Willowbrook bodied Leyland Atlanteans and a number of hired minibuses which were replaced at the beginning of 1993 by new K-registration Marshall bodied Mercedes-Benz 811Ds and a handful of similar G-registration <b>vehicles</b> <b>bodied</b> by Carlyle and bought secondhand from Cambus. These vehicles were painted in a cream and green livery not dissimilar to the former Liverpool Corporation/Merseyside Transport scheme.|$|R
5000|$|By 1974 François Guerbet {{had been}} {{fighting}} for several years to prove that an urban electric car was more than an impossible dream. [...] He believed that using lead-acid battery technology (then the only available option given the amount of charge needed to propel a vehicle) {{it would be impossible}} both to match the performance of a [...] "normal" [...] petrol driven car and achieve a reasonable range between recharging stops. [...] But by restricting the top speed to 50 km/h (31 mph) and using a very light <b>bodied</b> tricycle format <b>vehicle</b> carrying 200 kg of batteries, {{it should be possible to}} travel 100 km (61 miles) with a 120 kg load (e.g. a 70 kg person with 50 kg of luggage). [...] In essence, that combination was the blue print for the Midinette which Guerbet first presented on 25 April 1975 at the annual Paris Inventions Fair.|$|R
