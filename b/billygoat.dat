60|$|As he stood, bent nearly double, {{his back}} was toward the <b>billygoat,</b> which in their {{interest}} and excitement the soldiers were holding in a careless manner.

6000|$|Ghip-Ghisizzle was overjoyed at the {{prospect}} of being Boolooroo of the Blues, but he looked solemn at the promise Trot exacted. [...] "I'm not cruel," [...] he said, [...] "and I don't approve of patching in general, so I'll willingly destroy the Great Knife. But before I do that, I want the privilege of patching the Snubnosed Princesses to each other--mixing the six as much as possible--and then I want to patch the former Boolooroo to the <b>billygoat,</b> which is the same punishment he was going to inflict upon Cap'n Bill." ...|$|E
60|$|The Boolooroo stared a moment, {{and then}} he fell back to his throne, {{laughing}} boisterously. The idea of patching Cap'n Bill to a goat was vastly amusing to him, and the more he thought of it the more he roared with laughter. Some of the soldiers laughed, too, being tickled with the absurd notion, and the Six Snubnosed Princesses all sat up straight and permitted themselves to smile contemptuously. This would indeed be a severe punishment, therefore the Princesses were pleased {{at the thought of}} Cap'n Bill's becoming half a <b>billygoat,</b> and the billygoat's being half Cap'n Bill.|$|E
6000|$|After {{they had}} eaten {{all they could}} and the {{servants}} had been sent away, Trot related her adventures, telling how {{with the assistance of}} the <b>billygoat</b> she had turned the tables on the wicked Boolooroo. Then she gave Rosalie back her magic ring, thanking the kind Witch for all she had done for them. [...] "And now," [...] said she, [...] "I want to say to Ghip-'Sizzle that jus' as soon as we can find Button-Bright's umbrel we're going to fly home again. I'll always be Queen of Sky Island, but the Pink and Blue Countries must each have a Ruler. I think I'll make 'Sizzle the Boolooroo of the Blues, but I want you to promise me, Ghip, that you'll destroy the Great Knife and its frame and clean up the room and turn it into a skating rink an' never patch anyone as long as you rule the Blueskins." ...|$|E
60|$|Beaumoris {{is in the}} Treasury: he has {{a salary}} of eighty pounds a year, on which he {{maintains}} the best cab and horses of the season; and out of which he pays seventy guineas merely for his subscriptions to clubs. He hunts in Leicestershire, where great men mount him; he is a prodigious favorite behind the scenes at the theatres; you may get glimpses of him at Richmond, {{with all sorts of}} pink bonnets; and he is the sworn friend of half the most famous roues about town, such as Old Methuselah, Lord <b>Billygoat,</b> Lord Tarquin, and the rest: a respectable race. It is to oblige the former that the good-natured young fellow is here to-night; though it must not be imagined that he gives himself any airs of superiority. Dandy as he is, he is quite affable, and would borrow ten guineas from any man in the room, in the most jovial way possible.|$|E
6000|$|John D. Kinney, a Cincinnati boy, and {{a first-rate}} fellow, too, {{who came out}} with judge Turner, was my comrade. We staid at the Lake four days--I had plenty of fun, for John {{constantly}} reminded me of Sam Bowen {{when we were on}} our campaign in Missouri. But first and foremost, for Annie's, Mollies, and Pamela's comfort, be it known that I have never been guilty of profane language since I have been in this Territory, and Kinney hardly ever swears.--But sometimes human nature gets the better of him. On the second day we started to go by land to the lower camp, a distance of three miles, over the mountains, each carrying an axe. I don't think we got lost exactly, but we wandered four hours over the steepest, rockiest and most dangerous piece of country in the world. I couldn't keep from laughing at Kinney's distress, so I kept behind, so that he could not see me. After he would get over a dangerous place, with infinite labor and constant apprehension, he would stop, lean on his axe, and look around, then behind, then ahead, and then drop his head and ruminate awhile.--Then he would draw a long sigh, and say: [...] "Well--could any <b>Billygoat</b> have scaled that place without breaking his ---- ------ neck?" [...] And I would reply, [...] "No,--I don't think he could." [...] "No--you don't think he could--" [...] (mimicking me,) [...] "Why don't you curse the infernal place? You know you want to.--I do, and will curse the ---- ------ thieving country as long as I live." [...] Then we would toil on in silence for awhile. Finally I told him--"Well, John, what if we don't find our way out of this today--we'll know all about the country when we do get out." [...] "Oh stuff--I know enough--and too much about the d---d villainous locality already." [...] Finally, we reached the camp. But as we brought no provisions with us, the first subject that presented itself to us was, how to get back. John swore he wouldn't walk back, so we rolled a drift log apiece into the Lake, and set about making paddles, intending to straddle the logs and paddle ourselves back home sometime or other. But the Lake objected--got stormy, and we had to give it up. So we set out for the only house {{on this side of the}} Lake--three miles from there, down the shore. We found the way without any trouble, reached there before sundown, played three games of cribbage, borrowed a dug-out and pulled back six miles to the upper camp. As we had eaten nothing since sunrise, we did not waste time in cooking our supper or in eating it, either. After supper we got out our pipes--built a rousing camp fire in the open air-established a faro bank (an institution of this country,) on our huge flat granite dining table, and bet white beans till one o'clock, when John went to bed. We were up before the sun the next morning, went out on the Lake and caught a fine trout for breakfast. But unfortunately, I spoilt part of the breakfast. We had coffee and tea boiling on the fire, in coffee-pots and fearing they might not be strong enough, I added more ground coffee, and more tea, but--you know mistakes will happen.--I put the tea in the coffee-pot, and the coffee in the teapot--and if you imagine that they were not villainous mixtures, just try the effect once.|$|E
