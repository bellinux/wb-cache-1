5|$|Early radio {{telescope}} interferometers used a single baseline for measurement. Later astronomical interferometers, {{such as the}} Very Large Array illustrated in Fig11, used arrays of telescopes arranged in a pattern on the ground. A limited number of <b>baselines</b> will result in insufficient coverage. This was alleviated by using {{the rotation of the}} Earth to rotate the array relative to the sky. Thus, a single baseline could measure information in multiple orientations by taking repeated measurements, a technique called Earth-rotation synthesis. <b>Baselines</b> thousands of kilometers long were achieved using very long baseline interferometry.|$|E

40|$|Background: Self-reported {{physical}} activity (PA) and sleep duration (SLP) change markedly throughout adolescence. We sought to quantify changes in objectively-measured PA, sedentary time (ST) and SLP through adolescence, and to investigate <b>baseline</b> body composition and <b>baseline</b> activity levels as determinants of change. Methods: Individually calibrated combined {{heart rate and}} movement sensing was used to estimate PA energy expenditure (PAEE), SLP, daily ST and time in light (LPA), moderate (MPA), vigorous (VPA), and moderate-to-vigorous {{physical activity}} (MVPA) in 144 adolescents (50 % boys) of mean age 15. 1 (± 0. 3) y at <b>baseline</b> and 17. 5 (± 0. 3) y at follow-up. Changes in PA (ΔPA), ST (ΔST) and SLP (ΔSLP) were calculated as follow-up minus <b>baseline</b> values. Waist circumference (WC) was measured at <b>baseline</b> and follow-up, as was fat mass index (FMI) and fat-free mass index (FFMI) by a pooled estimation method including bio-impedance. Comparison of <b>baseline</b> and follow-up activity was made by mixed-model ANOVA. Linear regression adjusted for <b>baseline</b> demographics, total and weekend hours of monitor wear time and the seasons of activity measurements, was used to investigate <b>baseline</b> body composition as determinants of ΔPA, ΔST and ΔSLP. A further model adjusted for <b>baseline</b> of the outcome assessed <b>baseline</b> activity {{as a predictor of}} behaviour change, and investigated associations for <b>baseline</b> body composition independent of the <b>baseline</b> level of the outcome. Results: From <b>baseline</b> to follow-up levels of MPA and VPA declined (p[*]≤[*] 0. 039). The annual decline in MVPA was equivalent to - 4. 5 and - 3. 0 min/d in boys and girls, respectively. <b>Baseline</b> FMI, FFMI and WC were positively associated with ΔLPA and negatively associated with ΔST in boys when adjusted for <b>baseline</b> of the outcome (p[*]≤[*] 0. 037 for all). SLP increased from <b>baseline</b> to follow-up (p[*]=[*] 0. 004) but ΔSLP was not associated with <b>baseline</b> body composition (p[*]≥[*] 0. 13). For all variables, higher <b>baseline</b> levels were associated with greater declines over time (p[*]≤[*] 0. 003). Conclusions: Levels of higher-intensity PA decline from mid-to-late adolescence, whereas the duration of sleep increases. Changes in LPA and ST may be associated with <b>baseline</b> body composition, but the <b>baseline</b> level of the outcome is consistently the strongest predictor of changes in adolescent activity...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Many {{randomized}} trials involve measuring a continuous outcome - such as pain, body weight or blood pressure - at <b>baseline</b> and after treatment. In this paper, I compare four possibilities for how such trials can be analyzed: post-treatment; change between <b>baseline</b> and post-treatment; percentage change between <b>baseline</b> and post-treatment {{and analysis of}} covariance (ANCOVA) with <b>baseline</b> score as a covariate. The statistical power of each method was determined for a hypothetical randomized trial under a range of correlations between <b>baseline</b> and post-treatment scores. Results ANCOVA has the highest statistical power. Change from <b>baseline</b> has acceptable power when correlation between <b>baseline</b> and post-treatment scores is high;when correlation is low, analyzing only post-treatment scores has reasonable power. Percentage change from <b>baseline</b> has the lowest statistical power and was highly sensitive to changes in variance. Theoretical considerations suggest that percentage change from <b>baseline</b> will also fail to protect from bias {{in the case of}} <b>baseline</b> imbalance and will lead to an excess of trials with non-normally distributed outcome data. Conclusions Percentage change from <b>baseline</b> should not be used in statistical analysis. Trialists wishing to report this statistic should use another method, such as ANCOVA, and convert the results to a percentage change by using mean <b>baseline</b> scores. </p...|$|R

25|$|Long base line, LBL. This {{consists}} of an array {{of at least three}} transponders. The initial position of the transponders is determined by USBL and/ or by measuring the <b>baselines</b> between the transponders. Once that is done, only the ranges to the transponders need to be measured to determine a relative position. The position should theoretically be located at the intersection of imaginary spheres, one around each transponder, with a radius equal to the time between transmission and reception multiplied by the speed of sound through water. Because angle measurement is not necessary, the accuracy in large water depths is better than USBL.|$|E

25|$|One small 2009 {{double-blind}} study of autistic children found that 40 hourly treatments of 24% oxygen at 1.3 atmospheres provided {{significant improvement in}} the children's behavior immediately after treatment sessions but this study has not been independently confirmed. More recent, relatively large-scale controlled studies have also investigated HBOT using treatments of 24% oxygen at 1.3 atmospheres and have found less promising results. A 2010 {{double-blind study}} compared HBOT to a placebo treatment in children with autistic disorder. Both direct observational measures of behavioral symptoms and standardized psychological assessments were {{used to evaluate the}} treatment. No {{differences were found between the}} HBOT group and the placebo group on any of the outcome measures. A second 2011 single-subject design study also investigated the effects of 40 HBOT treatments of 24% oxygen at 1.3 atmospheres on directly observed behaviors using multiple <b>baselines</b> across 16 participants. Again, no consistent outcomes were observed across any group and further, no significant improvements were observed within any individual participant. Together these studies suggest that HBOT at 24% oxygen at 1.3 atmospheric pressure does not result in a clinically significant improvement of the behavioral symptoms of autistic disorder.|$|E
