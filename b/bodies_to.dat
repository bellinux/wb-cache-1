5|$|On 4October, the {{recovery}} crews began moving the <b>bodies</b> <b>to</b> the temporary base {{established at the}} nearby Jarinã ranch. The BAF deployed a C-115 Buffalo aircraft to transport the <b>bodies</b> <b>to</b> Brasília for identification.|$|E
5|$|Brown (1973) {{considered}} their heavy muscular <b>bodies</b> <b>to</b> be a striking characteristic, stating this {{made it difficult}} to hold them for venom extraction owing to their strength.|$|E

50|$|The {{tandem seating}} allowed the <b>body</b> <b>to</b> be long and narrow, {{with a low}} frontal area. This also allowed the <b>body</b> <b>to</b> taper like an {{aircraft}} fuselage, within a practical length.|$|R
5|$|During the 1948 Arab-Israeli War the Old City {{together}} with the Wall was controlled by Jordan. Article VIII of the 1949 Armistice Agreement provided for Israeli Jewish access to the Western Wall. However, for the following nineteen years, despite numerous requests by Israeli officials and Jewish groups to the United Nations and other international <b>bodies</b> <b>to</b> attempt to enforce the armistice agreement, Jordan refused to abide by this clause. Neither Israeli Arabs nor Israeli Jews could visit their holy places in the Jordanian territories.|$|E
5|$|Fires in the {{workings}} hampered rescue efforts, {{and it took}} several days before they were under control. It took six weeks {{for most of the}} <b>bodies</b> <b>to</b> be recovered and the fire to be extinguished. The subsequent enquiry pointed to errors made by the company and its management leading to charges of negligence against Edward Shaw, the colliery manager, and the owners. Shaw was fined £24 while the company was fined £10; newspapers calculated the cost of each miner lost was just 5 pence.|$|E
5|$|In 1831 and 1848, serious {{outbreaks}} of cholera had overwhelmed the crowded cemeteries of London, causing <b>bodies</b> <b>to</b> be stacked in heaps awaiting burial, and even relatively recent graves to be exhumed {{to make way}} for new burials. Public health policy at this time was generally shaped by the miasma theory, and the bad smells and risks of disease caused by piled bodies and exhumed rotting corpses caused great public concern.|$|E

50|$|The {{cause for}} Fibrinolysis syndrome, is the {{inability}} of the <b>body</b> <b>to</b> produce blood-coagulates to stop bleeding. What causes the <b>body</b> <b>to</b> not produce blood-coagulates are the low levels of fibrin, or therefore non-existent fibrin.|$|R
50|$|Body art {{is also a}} {{sub-category}} {{of performance}} art, in which artists use or abuse their own <b>body</b> <b>to</b> make their particular statements.More extreme body art can involve mutilation or pushing the <b>body</b> <b>to</b> its physical limits.|$|R
5|$|In 1921 the Metre Convention was {{extended}} to cover all units of measure, not just length and mass and in 1933 the 8th CGPM resolved {{to work with other}} international <b>bodies</b> <b>to</b> agree standards for electrical units that could be related back to the international prototypes. Since 1954 the CIPM committee that oversees the definition of units of measurement, the Consultative Committee for Units, has representatives from many international organisations including the ISR, IEC and ISO under the chairmanship of the CIPM.|$|E
5|$|In 1923 fifty {{motor car}} bodies {{were ordered to}} allow some of the {{original}} 1904–05 car <b>bodies</b> <b>to</b> be scrapped. From 1926 two stock pools were created. Main line trains were formed from 101 new motor cars supplemented by motor cars rebuilt from the steel bodied cars originally constructed in 1910–14 and 1923, and trailers modified from the original wooden bodied cars. A small pool of unmodified 'local stock' worked the shuttles from Acton Town to South Acton, South Harrow and Hounslow.|$|E
5|$|Other highly {{specialized}} feeders include cookiecutter sharks, which feed on flesh sliced out of other larger fish and marine mammals. Cookiecutter teeth are enormous {{compared to the}} animal's size. The lower teeth are particularly sharp. Although {{they have never been}} observed feeding, they are believed to latch onto their prey and use their thick lips to make a seal, twisting their <b>bodies</b> <b>to</b> rip off flesh.|$|E
50|$|Fuser Type: Appears in episode 11. Powers include {{reducing}} its <b>body</b> <b>to</b> liquid, levitation, spheres around its <b>body</b> <b>to</b> protect the fractal knot, can regenerate its entire {{body in a}} matter of hours, and can fuse with opponents.|$|R
50|$|In {{association}} football, extended runs in cup competitions {{can cause}} fixture congestion. A team may appeal <b>to</b> a governing <b>body</b> <b>to</b> extend their season {{but it is}} not compulsory for a governing <b>body</b> <b>to</b> act upon a request.|$|R

5|$|Sponges have unspecialized {{cells that}} can {{transform}} into other types and that often migrate between the main cell layers and the mesohyl in the process. Sponges {{do not have}} nervous, digestive or circulatory systems. Instead, most rely on maintaining a constant water flow through their <b>bodies</b> <b>to</b> obtain food and oxygen and to remove wastes.|$|E
5|$|The Bog People {{is divided}} into six chapters. The first is devoted to Tollund Man, and the second to Grauballe Man, {{two of the best}} known Iron Age bog <b>bodies</b> <b>to</b> have been {{discovered}} in Jutland, Denmark. The third and fourth chapters are devoted to the wider context of bog bodies first in Denmark and then in other parts of Europe. The final two chapters are devoted to a wider exposition of life and death in Iron Age Denmark.|$|E
5|$|The Flag of Scotland, {{also known}} as the Saint Andrew's Cross or more {{commonly}} The Saltire, is the national flag of Scotland. The Saltire is the correct flag for all individuals and corporate <b>bodies</b> <b>to</b> fly in order to demonstrate both their loyalty and Scottish nationality. It is also, where possible, flown from Scottish Government buildings every day from 8am until sunset, with certain exceptions; for example United Kingdom National Days.|$|E

5000|$|A {{provitamin}} is {{a substance}} that may be converted within the <b>body</b> <b>to</b> a vitamin. The term previtamin is a synonym. For example, [...] "Provitamin B5" [...] is a name for panthenol, which may be converted in the <b>body</b> <b>to</b> vitamin B5 (pantothenic acid).|$|R
5|$|The Gebelein predynastic mummies are six {{naturally}} mummified bodies, {{dating to}} approximately 3400BC from the Late Predynastic period of Ancient Egypt. They {{were the first}} complete predynastic <b>bodies</b> <b>to</b> be discovered. The well-preserved bodies were excavated {{at the end of}} the nineteenth century by Wallis Budge, the British Museum Keeper for Egyptology, from shallow sand graves near Gebelein (modern name Naga el-Gherira) in the Egyptian desert.|$|E
5|$|A {{mandatory}} order is {{an order of}} the High Court which commands a public body to perform a public duty, and is usually employed to compel public <b>bodies</b> <b>to</b> exercise the powers given to them. It {{may be used in}} combination with another remedy, most commonly a quashing order. In such a case, the quashing order will set aside the unlawful decision, and the {{mandatory order}} will require the public body to reconsider the matter. A person who complies with a mandatory order cannot have legal proceedings taken against him or her for doing so.|$|E
5|$|After {{receiving}} Staines's report, the Admiralty {{decided to}} take no action. In the following years, many ships called at Pitcairn Island and heard Adams's various stories of {{the foundation of the}} Pitcairn settlement. Adams died in 1829, honoured as the founder and father of a community that became celebrated over the next century as an exemplar of Victorian morality. Over the years, many recovered Bounty artefacts have been sold by islanders as souvenirs; in 1999, the Pitcairn Project was established by a consortium of Australian academic and historical <b>bodies,</b> <b>to</b> survey and document all the material remaining on-site, as part of a detailed study of the settlement's development.|$|E

5|$|Although {{attacks against}} living humans are rare, the spotted hyena readily feeds on human corpses. In the {{tradition}} of the Maasai and the Hadza, corpses are left in the open for spotted hyenas to eat. A corpse rejected by hyenas is seen as having something wrong with it, and liable to cause social disgrace, therefore {{it is not uncommon for}} <b>bodies</b> <b>to</b> be covered in fat and blood from a slaughtered ox. In Ethiopia, hyenas were reported to feed extensively on the corpses of victims of the 1960 attempted coup and the Red Terror. Hyenas habituated to scavenging on human corpses may develop bold behaviours towards living people; hyena attacks on people in southern Sudan increased during the Second Sudanese Civil War, when human corpses were readily available to them.|$|E
5|$|Camouflage uses any {{combination}} of materials, coloration, or illumination for concealment to make the organism hard to detect by sight. It is common in both terrestrial and marine animals. Camouflage can be achieved in many different ways, such as through resemblance to surroundings, disruptive coloration, shadow elimination, self-decoration, cryptic behavior, or changeable skin patterns and color. Animals such as the flat-tail horned lizard of North America have evolved to eliminate their shadow and {{blend in with the}} ground. The bodies of these lizards are flattened, and their sides thin towards the edge. This body form, along with the white scales fringed along their sides, allows the lizards to effectively hide their shadows. Additionally, these lizards hide any remaining shadows by pressing their <b>bodies</b> <b>to</b> the ground.|$|E
5|$|Delay issues aside, the {{development}} team encountered further {{challenges in the}} creation of the game. Implementing the top-down perspective became a particular issue and resulted in a lot of trial and error. With a true top-down view, players would be unable to see characters' faces and <b>bodies.</b> <b>To</b> circumvent this issue, objects in the world were tilted at an angle so that they were more visible in the top-down view. Mouri requested that the game run at sixty frames per second instead of thirty to stabilise the stereoscopic 3D and smoothen movement animations. While doubling the frame rate increased the processing load, it allowed the developers to implement a feature where players could select items by dragging and dropping them from their inventory using the Nintendo 3DS's touchscreen and stylus; at thirty frames per second this feature felt too sluggish for the stylus's movement.|$|E

50|$|As {{with many}} {{competition}} rounds, variations develop and the PPC family of cartridges {{has served as}} the foundation for many. In the native 22 and 6mm calibers, there are numerous improved versions both with a shorter <b>body</b> <b>to</b> reduce powder capacity and longer <b>body</b> <b>to</b> increase powder capacity.|$|R
50|$|QPM {{produces}} 70-100% more of lysine and tryptophan {{than the}} most modern varieties of tropical maize. These two amino acids allow the <b>body</b> <b>to</b> manufacture complete proteins, thereby eliminating wet-malnutrition. In addition tryptophan can be converted in the <b>body</b> <b>to</b> Niacin, which theoretically reduces the incidence of Pellagra.|$|R
