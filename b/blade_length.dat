The knife retained {{the profile of}} Emerson's custom piece {{in addition to the}} ATS-34 steel and the titanium liners. However, on Benchmade's offering the titanium bolsters and micarta scales were replaced with G10 fiberglass scales, the slotted screws were replaced by Torx head screws, and the pocket clip was repositioned so that the knife could be carried in the pocket in a tip-down position.|$|E
5|$|The {{improvement}} in running {{time and the}} wide broadcast of the race results provided a public demonstration of how the <b>blade</b> <b>length</b> affects performance. Pistorius' stride length was actually 9 percent longer (2.2m vs 2.0m), but Oliveira took more strides (99 vs 92). The combination of stride length and stride rate led to a clearly unusual performance with the longer blades. Pistorius' management {{issued a statement saying}} that Pistorius is always 1.84 meters tall, regardless of what prostheses he wears, and that the decision to maintain this height for his running blades was an issue of fairness.|$|E
5|$|A {{controversy}} over the effects of running <b>blade</b> <b>length</b> arose at the 2012 Paralympic Games, as Brazilian runner Alan Oliveira and USA runner Blake Leeper changed to longer running blades {{within a few months}} before the 2012 Paralympic Games. This led to marked improvement in their running times. Pistorius complained after the 200m race that the blades provided artificially lengthened running strides, which would be an infringement of the IPC rules, regardless of that the blades were within the allowable height limits for the athletes concerned. His complaint was supported by single-leg runners including Jerome Singleton and Jack Swift, who called for the T43 double blade and T44 single blade classes to be separated in future events, as single blade runners were unable to adjust the height of the prostheses, and must always match the length of their biological leg with a running blade.|$|E
40|$|The {{presented}} master's thesis {{deals with}} the safety assessment of several variants of the impeller with different <b>blades</b> <b>length.</b> The motivation for creating this thesis {{is to find the}} solution of the problem situation which is characterized by the breakdown of the steam turbine impeller with <b>blades</b> <b>length</b> of 30 mm. As confirmed in this thesis, the impeller with <b>blades</b> <b>length</b> of 30 mm is operated in the resonance. Likewise, according to the technical standard ČSN EN ISO 10437 its operation is not safe. As the correction action for the problem situation solving is proposed the prolongation of the impeller's blades. The safety is detected for six variants of impeller with dierent <b>blades</b> <b>length.</b> For each variant, there is executed a modal analysis and its results are drawn up into the Campbell diagram. On the basis of this diagram, the safety of individual components is evaluated. The last part of the masters thesis concerns with the examination of the influence of <b>blades</b> <b>length</b> on the modal properties of the impeller...|$|R

The straight-bladed shortsword known as the xiphos (ξίφος) is depicted in works of art, and two types of single-edged cutting swords, the kopis and machaira, are shown in images and are mentioned in texts. An archaeological find of a well-preserved Macedonian xiphos revealed a sword with a <b>blade</b> <b>length</b> of 55cm and a weight of 300g.

40|$|Abstract: In this paper, Flap-wise, edge-wise and {{torsional}} {{natural frequencies}} of a variable <b>length</b> <b>blade</b> have been identified. Therefore designers can ensure that natural frequencies {{will not be}} close to the frequency of the main excitation forces in order to avoid resonance. The fixed portion and moveable portion of the variable <b>length</b> <b>blade</b> are approximated respectively by a hollow and a solid beam which can be slid in and out. Ten different configurations of the variable <b>length</b> <b>blade,</b> representing ten different positions of the moveable portion are investigated. A MATLAB program was developed to predict natural frequencies. Similarly three-dimensional models of the variable <b>length</b> <b>blade</b> have been developed in the finite element program Unigraphics NX 5. Concurrence between MATLAB and Unigraphics NX 5 results has been found for the frequency range of interest. This means that an effective method to compute natural frequencies of a variable <b>length</b> <b>blade</b> was developed...|$|R
