40|$|Juvenile {{delinquency}} is a noteworthy problem. This thesis {{addressed the}} association <b>between</b> <b>parenting</b> and juvenile delinquency {{by analyzing the}} concepts of parenting adopted in family research in relation to criminological concepts and measures of delinquent behavior. Four studies were conducted. The first study addressed a meta-analysis on parenting characteristics and styles in relation to delinquency. In this meta-analysis, previous manuscripts were systematically analyzed, computing mean effect sizes for each parenting dimension and investigating the influence of moderators. Concurrent and longitudinal studies analyzing the link <b>between</b> <b>parenting</b> and delinquency were examined. Furthermore, the meta-analysis examined whether {{the sex of the}} child moderates the relationship <b>between</b> <b>parenting</b> and delinquency. The second study investigated the long-term associations <b>between</b> <b>parenting</b> and delinquency. This study focused on parenting characteristics and styles in early adolescence in relation to delinquency in young adulthood, covering a period of about 10 years. In this chapter, we used datasets from the two longitudinal studies, the Pittsburgh Youth Study (PYS) and the Child-Rearing and Family in the Netherlands Study (CFNS). The third study focused on links <b>between</b> <b>parenting</b> styles and different trajectories of delinquents. Several delinquency trajectories were identified based on self-reported and official delinquency data collected in the PYS during adolescence on the youngest cohort. Furthermore, the links <b>between</b> <b>parenting</b> styles and these different types of delinquents were investigated. In the fourth study, using a subsample from the CFNS of 330 intact families, the relationship between fathers' and mothers' parenting styles and delinquency in adolescence and young adulthood was addressed. Both concurrent links as well as longitudinal links <b>between</b> <b>parenting</b> styles and delinquency were investigated. Separate analyses on fathers' and mothers' parenting as well as combinations of parenting styles of fathers and mothers were studied in relation to delinquency. In addition, sex-differences in the parenting-delinquency link were studied by analyzing interaction-effects <b>between</b> <b>parenting</b> and sex on delinquency...|$|R

Both sexes of the rock-haunting ringtail possum showed substantial long-term care of offspring.

Both sexes embrace young, whereas only females engage in bridge formation. The mother allows her young to move from branch to branch by using her body as a bridge. This has never been seen in another possum. Embracing {{is a way for}} the adults to know the stage of maturation of the offspring. A third feature of obligate monogamy shown by the Rock-haunting Ringtail Possum is the rearing of younger siblings by juveniles.|$|E

For example, where an individual accidentally creates a small fire in a flat, he is under a duty to take reasonable steps to extinguish it, or to summon help. A special duty also exists <b>between</b> <b>parents</b> and their children, and an omission of a parent to save their young child from drowning would result in criminal liability, as it is deemed a parent voluntarily undertakes to ensure the wellbeing of their child. Other duties may be inferred from contractual obligations, and so an individual employed to ensure individuals do not cross a railway line while there are trains running would be found criminally negligent where he abandoned his post.|$|E
25|$|The {{effects of}} the divorce extend past the {{separation}} of both parents. The remaining conflict <b>between</b> <b>parents,</b> financial problems, and the re-partnering or remarriage of parents can cause lasting stress. Studies conducted by Booth and Amato (2001) have shown {{that there is no}} correlation between post-divorce conflict and the child’s ability to adjust to their life circumstance. On the other hand, Hetherington (1999) completed research on this same topic and did find adverse effects in children. In regards to the financial standing of a family, divorce does have the potential to reduce the children’s style of living. Child support is often given to help cover basic needs such as schooling. If the parents’ finances are already scarce then their children {{may not be able to}} participate in extracurricular activities such as sports and music lessons, which can be detrimental to their social lives.|$|E
25|$|Conflicts between animals {{occur in}} many contexts, such as between {{potential}} mating partners, <b>between</b> <b>parents</b> and offspring, between siblings and between competitors for resources. Group-living animals may {{dispute over the}} direction of travel or the allocation of time to joint activities. Various factors limit the escalation of aggression, including communicative displays, conventions, and routines. In addition, following aggressive incidents, various forms of conflict resolution have been observed in mammalian species, particularly in gregarious primates. These can mitigate or repair possible adverse consequences, especially for the recipient of aggression who may become vulnerable to attacks by other members of a group. Conciliatory acts vary by species and may involve specific gestures or simply more proximity and interaction between the individuals involved. However, conflicts over food are rarely followed by post conflict reunions, {{even though they are}} the most frequent type in foraging primates.|$|E

However, {{there has been little}} investigation of the mechanisms that explain this association. The present study examines two such potential mechanisms, the child’s perception of cognitive competence {{and the quality of the}} student-teacher relationship, as potential mediators of the relation <b>between</b> <b>parent</b> involvement and a child’s academic performance. This study used a sample of 158 seven-year old participants, their mothers, and their teachers.

This finding was significant over and above the impact of the child’s intelligence. The child’s ethnicity was not a moderator of this relation.
