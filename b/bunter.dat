5|$|The {{metropolitan}} boroughs of the City of Salford and the City of Manchester border Trafford to {{the north}} and east respectively; the Cheshire East area of Cheshire lies to the south. The geology of South Trafford is Keuper marl with some Keuper waterstone and sandstone, whilst the geology of North Trafford is <b>Bunter</b> sandstone. The River Mersey runs east to west through the area, separating North Trafford from South Trafford; other rivers in Trafford include the Bollin, the River Irwell, Sinderland Brook, and Crofts Bank Brook. The Bridgewater Canal, opened in 1761 and completed in 1776, follows a course through Trafford roughly north to south and passes through Stretford, Sale, and Altrincham. The Manchester Ship Canal, opened in 1894, forms part of Trafford's northern and western boundaries with Salford.|$|E
25|$|The geology of {{the city}} is complex, with a {{combination}} of Triassic and Carboniferous geology; specifically <b>Bunter</b> and Keuper sandstone, and Upper and Middle Coal measures. There is also an area of dolerite intrusions.|$|E

50|$|A running theme at the {{beginning}} of each holiday season is <b>Bunters</b> persistent attempts to avoid spending vacations with his family and instead gatecrash the holiday arrangements of one or more of his schoolfellows; and his schoolfellows (generally unsuccessful) attempts to avoid <b>Bunters</b> company.|$|R
50|$|Billy <b>Bunters</b> main redeeming {{feature is}} the very genuine love and concern he has for his mother. This is seen in several stories, usually {{involving}} his mother suffering an illness, allowing a better side of <b>Bunters</b> character to be seen. (Magnets #1016, #1206 and #1532).|$|R
25|$|Charles Hamilton (1876–1961), {{according}} to the Guinness Book of Records the world's most prolific author, who as Frank Richards wrote the Greyfriars School stories featuring Billy <b>Bunter,</b> from 1926 until his death lived at Kingsgate in a small house called Rose Lawn looked after by his housekeeper Miss Edith Hood.|$|E
25|$|In this period, Vincent Lingiari, Billy <b>Bunter</b> Jampijinpa {{and others}} toured Australia, {{with the support}} of workers’ unions, to give talks, raise awareness, build support for their cause and have {{meetings}} with major lawyers and politicians. Frank Hardy recalled one fundraising meeting at which a donor gave $500 after hearing Vincent Lingiari speak. The donor – who said he had never before met an Aboriginal person – was a young Dr Fred Hollows, the eye surgeon and Communist activist.|$|E
25|$|The rocks {{underlying}} {{this area}} {{in the south of}} the Vale of York are Triassic <b>Bunter</b> sandstone but in this area they are largely overlain by later glacial drift deposits. The village is sited on the slightly raised Escrick moraine. This is one of the terminal moraines that was left in the Vale of York when the ice retreated {{at the end of the}} last ice age. The resultant soils vary from thick clay to sand and alluvium and their fertility is consequently very variable.|$|E

50|$|A list of {{the members}} of the Remove (Lower Fourth) form was {{published}} in Magnet #1659 Billy <b>Bunter's</b> Bargain (1939), and provided the boys' ages, heights, and weights. Billy <b>Bunter's</b> age is given as 15 years 1 month; his height as 4 ft 9ins; and his weight as 14 stone 12 1/2 lb.|$|R
60|$|I led {{him without}} any delay into Mrs. <b>Bunter's</b> private sitting-room. After she had dropped a tear over the late cannibal, given a hug to her Winston, {{and told him}} that he must grow his {{moustache}} again, the dear lady tucked her feet upon the sofa, and I got out of <b>Bunter's</b> way.|$|R
25|$|At {{some point}} during this time, both the {{magnesium}} limestone and the sandstone (now known as Bulwell Sandstone) on which Bulwell sits began to be quarried. The strong easily crafted durable rock, a dull yellow-orange magnesium limestone (not {{to be confused with}} the <b>Bunter</b> sandstone famously underlying Nottingham Castle), provided a perfect building material which was also easy to quarry. Many houses, schools, churches and - particularly - garden walls built using Bulwell Stone still stand to this day, extending for miles around Bulwell in all directions.|$|E
25|$|The area {{rests on}} <b>Bunter</b> upper mottled {{sandstone}} from the Triassic period. These sands were very {{useful in the}} manufacture of moulds, which were extensively used in the metal working industries in Birmingham. Much {{of the rest of the}} city centre lies on Keuper sandstone, which is better suited for foundry work. The conservation area sits on a flat-topped hill, orientated north-south. The land falls steeply west towards Icknield Street and southeast to the Birmingham and Fazeley Canal. It rises southeast from the canal to Great Charles Street Queensway. The highest point is located on Warstone Lane.|$|E
25|$|During {{his time}} with Gainsborough he worked with Marcel Varnel, Val Guest, Charles Hawtrey, Marriott Edgar as well as Moore Marriott and Graham Moffatt who acted as Hay's {{straight}} men {{in a number of}} his films, Moffatt portrayed an overweight, insolent schoolboy reminiscent of Billy <b>Bunter</b> who was cast as Albert Brown and Marriott, as that of a toothless old man cast as Harbottle, Harbottle was originally a character in Hay's St. Michael's sketches. Together, the trio appeared in six films together between 1936 and 1940, Windbag the Sailor, Oh, Mr. Porter!, Convict 99, Old Bones of the River, Ask a Policeman and Where's That Fire?.|$|E

50|$|More than 40 {{thousand}} years ago, the primitive {{inhabitants of the}} region used flint and bones of gigantic animals (mammoths, fleecy rhinoceroses, and bisons) as tools for land-tilling and bunting. The remnants of that epoch were found at the archaeological site by the village Velyka Burimka of the Chornobaivskyi Raion. In the village of Mezhirich, Kanivskyi Raion, a mammoth <b>bunters</b> settlement was discovered, dating back to 2000-1500 B.C. Its contemporary - a bison <b>bunters</b> settlement - {{was found in the}} village of Hordashivka of the Talnivskyi Raion.|$|R
25|$|The Nine Tailors {{was adapted}} for {{television}} {{as a series}} of four hour-long episodes in 1973, one of several adaptations of Lord Peter Wimsey novels starring Ian Carmichael as Lord Peter. In a significant plot difference, the original theft of the emeralds was introduced by showing a young Lieutenant Wimsey of the Rifle Brigade attending Henry Thorpe's wedding shortly before the War and unsuccessfully pursuing the fleeing Cranton. (In the books, Wimsey did not join the Army until after the outbreak of the War.) Deacon's escape from prison and the murder of the soldier Arthur Cobbleigh (renamed as Watkins) are also shown in the first episode. So are the circumstances under which <b>Bunter</b> becomes Lord Peter's valet.|$|E
25|$|The {{island of}} Heligoland is a {{geological}} oddity; {{the presence of}} the main island's characteristic red sedimentary rock {{in the middle of the}} German Bight is unusual. It is the only such formation of cliffs along the continental coast of the North Sea. The formation itself, called the <b>Bunter</b> sandstone or Buntsandstein, is from the early Triassic geologic age. It is older than the white chalk that underlies the island Düne, the same rock that forms the white cliffs of Dover in England and cliffs of Danish and German islands in the Baltic Sea. In fact, a small chalk rock close to Heligoland, called witt Kliff (white cliff), is known to have existed within sight of the island to the west until the early 18th century, when storm floods finally eroded it to below sea level.|$|E
25|$|He went on {{to perform}} in a wide repertoire. Among his stage work, he {{performed}} in André Birabeau's French comedy Head of the Family, Neil Simon's Come Blow Your Horn, Bernard Kops's Change for the Angel, Francis Swann's Out of the Frying Pan, Shakespeare's Julius Caesar, Coriolanus, and Twelfth Night, Oscar Wilde's The Importance of Being Earnest, The Striplings, The Move After Checkmate and others. At the same time, he appeared in hundreds of BBC radio broadcasts and early BBC soap-operas, such as Billy <b>Bunter</b> of Greyfriars School, Emergency - Ward 10, Probation Officer, and Two Living, One Dead. He appeared as the cabin boy John Drake in the television series Sir Francis Drake, a 26-part adventure series made by ITC starring Terence Morgan and Jean Kent. He made his film debut in 1958 with leading roles in two children's films, Blow Your Own Trumpet and Soapbox Derby, for The Children's Film Foundation in Britain.|$|E
50|$|In The Secret Seven {{series of}} 1934, the entire plotline is {{initiated}} by <b>Bunter’s</b> stupidity, which causes a road accident {{that results in}} a number of leading characters being hospitalised.|$|R
5000|$|Among <b>Bunters</b> few virtues is an {{occasional}} tendency to display courage {{for the sake}} of others. To his credit, he is invariably in a state of extreme terror himself on such occasions. This characteristic was first seen in Magnet #364 Surprising the School (1915) when he saved his schoolmasters niece, Cora Quelch, from an angry bull [...] and was afterwards repeated on a number of other occasions. Unfortunately, <b>Bunter’s</b> love of the limelight frequently leads him to spoil matters by boasting and exaggerating afterwards. Oddly enough, he also displays generosity, on the rare occasions when he is in possession of food or cash.|$|R
5000|$|Greene, William Frederick (Study No 4)- sidekick of Coker, only {{interested}} in the food and gifts bestowed by Horace Coker. Greene {{is something of a}} poet and, according to the Cassell novel, Billy <b>Bunter's</b> Treasure Hunt knows something about numismatics.|$|R
500|$|Partington's local drift geology is {{a mixture}} of {{alluvial}} deposits, fluvio-glacial gravel, and peat deposited about 10,000years ago, during the last ice age. The bedrock is Keuper sandstone in the south and <b>Bunter</b> sandstone in the north. The town's climate is generally temperate, like the rest of Greater Manchester. The mean highest and lowest temperatures ( [...] and [...] ) are slightly above the national average, while the annual rainfall (...) and average hours of sunshine (1394.5 hours) are respectively above and below the national averages.|$|E
500|$|The {{mentioned}} iron compounds {{have been}} used as pigments (compare ochre) since historical time and contribute as well to the color of various geological formations, e.g. the Bundsandstein (British <b>Bunter,</b> colored sandstein). [...] In the case of the Eisensandstein (a jurassic 'iron sandstone', e.g. from Donzdorf) in Germany and Bath stone in the UK, iron pigments contribute to the yellowish color of large amounts of historical buildings and sculptures. The proverbial red color of the surface of Mars is derived from an iron oxide-rich regolith.|$|E
500|$|Sale's local drift geology {{consists}} {{of sand and}} gravel deposited about 10,000years ago, during the last ice age. The bedrock is <b>Bunter</b> sandstone {{in the west and}} Triassic waterstone in the east. United Utilities obtains the town's drinking water from the Lake District. Sale's climate is generally temperate, like the rest of Greater Manchester. The mean highest and lowest temperatures ( [...] and [...] ) are slightly above the national average, while the annual rainfall (...) and average hours of sunshine (1394.5 hours) are respectively above and below the national averages.|$|E
50|$|In the classroom, <b>Bunter’s</b> {{academic}} {{abilities are}} scarce {{to the point}} of non-existent. He is the despair of his Form master, Mr Quelch. In this he is not helped by his extreme laziness and unwillingness to indulge in any academic work whatsoever.|$|R
5000|$|Surprisingly, Mantle {{was also}} one of the best <b>bunters</b> for basehits of all-time. He is in 10th place in number of bases-empty bunt singles for his career with 80, in only 148 at-bats. [...] There are no other power hitters in the rest of the top ten.|$|R
50|$|The band gained radio {{plays on}} BBC 6 Music, XFM, Radio Cornwall, Pirate FM, Atlantic FM and Totally Radio. They {{played at the}} Tapestry Goes West Festival three years running and the Lowender Peran festival for two years, and also {{performed}} at The Hall for Cornwall, The Acorn and <b>Bunters.</b>|$|R
500|$|At [...] (53.42056, 2.38778), [...] {{above sea}} level, Carrington Moss lies along the {{southern}} edge of the Lancashire Plain, an area of <b>Bunter</b> sandstones overlaid with marls laid down during the Late Triassic period. These rocks are themselves overlaid by a layer of boulder clay deposited during the last ice age, about 10,000years ago. The combination of the flat topography and the underlying clay resulted in extensive peat bogs developing along the Mersey Valley, and overflowing beyond the valley. Along with large parts of Chat Moss and Holcroft Moss, Carrington Moss began to form during the Flandrian period from 7100 to 5000 BP.|$|E
500|$|The {{topography}} of Trafford Park is either flat or gently undulating, about [...] {{above sea level}} at its highest point. The local bedrock is Triassic <b>Bunter</b> Sandstone, overlaid by sand and gravel deposited during the last ice age, around 10,000years ago. There are some areas of peat bog in {{the west of the}} park, in the area formerly known as Trafford Moss. In 1793, William Roscoe began work on reclaiming the bog, and by 1798 that work was sufficiently advanced for him to turn his attention to the task of reclaiming the much larger Chat Moss in nearby Salford, also owned by the Trafford family.|$|E
500|$|Geologically, Birmingham is {{dominated}} by the Birmingham Fault which runs diagonally through the city from the Lickey Hills in the south west, passing through Edgbaston and the Bull Ring, to Erdington and Sutton Coldfield in the north east. To the south and east of the fault the ground is largely softer Mercia Mudstone, interspersed with beds of <b>Bunter</b> pebbles and crossed by the valleys of the Rivers Tame, Rea and Cole and their tributaries. To the north and west of the fault, between [...] higher than the surrounding area and underlying much of the city centre, lies a long ridge of harder Keuper Sandstone. The bedrock underlying Birmingham was mostly laid down during the Permian and Triassic periods.|$|E
6000|$|Reluctance, shame, disgust, {{would have}} been visible on poor <b>Bunter's</b> countenance if the great part of {{it had not been}} swathed up in {{cotton-wool}} and bandages. His ebony eyebrows, more sinister than ever amongst all that lot of white linen, came together in a frown as he made a mighty effort to say: ...|$|R
50|$|<b>Bunter’s</b> {{personal}} {{habits are}} lazy and slovenly. He {{is always the}} last to rise from his {{bed in the morning}} and always chooses to remain in bed for a few extra minutes in preference to washing himself. His handkerchief is permanently filthy and his waistcoat usually displays prominent clues that reveal the ingredients of his breakfast that day.|$|R
50|$|Loder, however, is {{not ready}} to give up. He enlists <b>Bunter's</b> aid and uses the Fat Owl's gift for ventriloquism to trick Prout into leaving the school that afternoon. Loder then informs Wharton that the Remove has leave to go to Rookwood School and play the match. They duly win the game 3-2, with Vernon-Smith scoring the winning goal.|$|R
