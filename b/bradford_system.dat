50|$|The <b>Bradford</b> <b>system</b> (also {{known as}} the English Worsted Yarn Count System or {{spinning}} count or Bradford count) {{is a way to}} assess the quality of wool.|$|E
50|$|The Mid-Yorkshire Tramway Company of Shipley was {{purchased}} in 1904 and {{incorporated into the}} <b>Bradford</b> <b>system.</b> The last extension from Bingley Post Office to Crossflatts was opened in 1914.|$|E

50|$|The <b>Bradford</b> {{trolleybus}} <b>system</b> {{served the}} city of Bradford, Yorkshire, England {{for much of the}} 20th century. It {{was one of the first}} two trolleybus systems to be opened in the United Kingdom, along with the Leeds system.|$|R
50|$|In {{the last}} ten years, {{objective}} measurement of several fiber characteristics has become faster and more available {{and is likely to}} replace the <b>Bradford</b> count <b>system</b> in all commercial arenas. The spinning count, with all its lore, will not disappear overnight.|$|R
5000|$|Both systems {{commenced}} {{operations on}} 20 June 1911. [...] However, {{the public service}} on the <b>Bradford</b> <b>system</b> did not start until four days later. [...] The <b>Bradford</b> <b>system</b> lasted the longest of all the UK's urban trolleybus systems. Having {{been one of the}} first two such systems to open, it was also the last one to close, on 26 March 1972. Just before its closure, it also held the distinction of being the longest-lived surviving trolleybus system in the world, but with the Bradford closure that distinction passed to the Shanghai, China, trolleybus system, opened in 1914.|$|E
50|$|Wool crimp: The {{number of}} bends per unit length along the wool fibre {{approximately}} indicates spinning capacity of the wool. Fibres with a fine crimp have many bends and usually have a small diameter. Such fibre can be spun into fine yarns, with great lengths of yarn for a given weight of wool, and greater market value. Fine fibres may be utilised {{in the production of}} fine garments such as men's suits whereas the coarser fibres may be used for the production of carpet and other sturdy products. Crimp is measured in crimps per inch or crimps per centimetre. Average diameter or mean fibre diameter is measured in micrometres (microns). For generations, English wool-handlers categorized wool along the above lines estimating spinning capacity by eye and touch. This spread worldwide as the <b>Bradford</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E
40|$|The wool {{production}} and fleece analysis of 50 extremely plainbodied stud ewes are given. The ewes were {{typical of the}} sheep of the stud (including the stud rams) and were obtained from a breeder who had consistently bred for extreme plainness, so that this characteristic is successfully being transmitted to the progeny. Thirty-five four-toothed stud ewes, recorded in 1940, gave an average greasy fleece of 13 • 28 lb.; a clean scoured fleece of 7 • 47 lb. as bone dry, or 8 • 7 lb. at 16 per cent. Regain; a yield of 58 • 4 per cent as dry or 67 • 7 per cent. on the the Bradford system; an average staple length of 4 • 0 inches and a 60 's quality number with a coefficient of variability of 4 • 5 per cent., indicating a uniform group. The number of fibres per square inch of skin ranged from 31, 700 to 45, 000, {{with an average of}} 41, 600. The average fleece density was 2 • 51 per cent. Fifteen four-toothed stud ewes, recorded in 1941, gave an average greasy fleece weight of 12 • 17 lb. with 6 • 99 lb. of clean scoured wool as bone dry, or 8 • 1 lb. of clean wool at 16 per cent. Regain. The yield was 58 • 1 per cent. as dry or 67 • 3 per cent. on the <b>Bradford</b> <b>system.</b> The average staple length was 3 • 8 inches and the quality number a 60 's with a coefficient of variability of 4 • 3 per cent. showing a uniform group. The number of fibres growing per square inch of skin ranged from 30, 200 to 71, 600 with an average of 46, 700. The average fleece density was 2 • 54 per cent. It is concluded that the extremely plainbodied stud here described possesses a good stud standard of production in regard to the total wool, the length, and the fleece density. The view held by many sheepmen that extremely plainbodied sheep must necessarily have inferior fleeces, cannot be substantiated. Not only do these sheep produce profitable fleeces, but by virtue of their smooth skins and strong constitutions, they possess the practical advantages of the plain bodied type. The reliability of judging merino {{wool production}} in practice is discussed. It is contended that the judgment of fleece density and quantity of wool is difficult because of the grease factor and an increased need for fleece testing has been experienced. In the stud analysed there is a highly significant correlation between greasy fleece weights and scoured fleece weights and an insignificant correlation between greasy fleece weights and yield. In consequence, the breeder can, by selecting the highest greasy fleece weights, automatically improve upon the clean wool production. This recommendation does not hold where there is a definite relationship between greasy fleece weights and yields. The articles have been scanned in colour with a HP Scanjet 5590; 300 dpi.

2500|$|In past centuries Bradford's {{location}} in Bradfordale made communications difficult, except from the north. Nonetheless, Bradford is now well-served by transport <b>systems.</b> <b>Bradford</b> was first {{connected to the}} developing turnpike network in 1734, [...] when the first Yorkshire turnpike was built between Manchester and Leeds via Halifax and Bradford.|$|R

50|$|An {{expansion}} of the tramway network was prepared by laying more tracks. A comprehensive system could, however, not be developed until the leases of the Bradford Tramways and Omnibus Company and of the Bradford and Shelf Tramway Company expired. The Corporation obtained therefore statutory powers to terminate the Companies leases before their expiry date, and purchased them on 1st February 1902, after which date both tramway companies went into liquidation. Some of the steam engines and cars from the former tramway companies were hired until the electric system was fully operational. The horse trams on the Manningham Lane line were retired on 31 January 1902. In 1903 steam services on the former Bradford and Shelf Tramway lines ceased, and the <b>Bradford</b> tramway <b>system</b> became fully electrified.|$|R
50|$|The {{undertaking}} {{changed its}} name to Bradford City Transport in 1952. The <b>Bradford</b> trolleybus <b>system</b> covered 47 route miles and operated 200 vehicles at its peak. An increased diesel fuel duty in 1952, coupled with a decrease in electricity costs, meant that trolleybuses were more economical to operate than motor buses. By 1962 the position had been reversed, so that the Transport Committee voted to replace the trolleybuses by the more flexible motor bus. In March 1961 the trolleybuses on the City to Bradford Moor route were withdrawn, followed by those on the Eccleshill to St. Enoch's Road route in November 1962. In 1967 less than 100 trolleybuses remained in service, and No. 844, the last trolleybus to carry fare paying passengers in Bradford, and also the last in Britain, returned to Thornbury depot on Sunday, 26 March 1972, for the last time. Bradford City Transport was absorbed into West Yorkshire Passenger Transport Executive on 31 March 1974.|$|R
50|$|After the {{play-off}} final {{disappointment of}} the previous year, Sunderland returned to the top-flight in record breaking fashion, earning 105 points; then a new record under the 3 points for a win <b>system.</b> <b>Bradford</b> City, who had only narrowly avoided relegation in the previous two seasons, returned to the top-flight {{for the first time}} in over 80 years, as Paul Jewell enjoyed a highly successful first full season as manager. Watford beat out pre-season favourites Bolton Wanderers in the play-off final, earning them their second successive promotion and also earning manager Graham Taylor the joint record for most promotions earned by a single manager.|$|R
50|$|Born in Shipley, near Bradford, West Yorkshire, Simon Ainge is {{a product}} of <b>Bradford</b> City's youth <b>system,</b> winning a senior {{contract}} in March 2006. He broke into the first team the following season making his debut in a 2-1 defeat to Scunthorpe United on 17 October 2006 in the Football League Trophy. He made his first league appearance the following month before his first start was in a 4-0 FA Cup victory over Crewe Alexandra on 4 November 2006. He played four times during November 2006 winning praise from his manager Colin Todd, a former England international centre back. Ainge played a total of 11 games during the 2006-07 season but he was limited to just four games the following season, including three as substitute, and was instead given a trial at Scunthorpe United. He returned to Bradford before he joined Conference side Halifax Town in January 2008 in a loan deal {{for the rest of the}} season.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{was planned}} as an -interdisciplinary work, a {{possible}} exemplar of 'a peace study' (see Appendix 5). It offers {{an analysis of}} the situation of the Asian children of immigrant families, socially and racially disadvantaged in Britain, in the <b>Bradford</b> school <b>system</b> from the mid- 1970 's to 1980 *, and their relative success in terms of external examination assessment in comparison with their peers. This is seen against the backcloth of pioneering Local Authority policies to support their education and observations of practice in schools. The findings are generalised as models of what is perceived by the policy-makers and practitioners to be progress towards racial justice and peace. It is argued that the British school system has shown limited facility to offer equal opportunity of success to pupils in socially disadvantaged groups and that this is borne out in {{an analysis of the}} situation of the Asian pupils in the County Upper schools in Bradford (CB), less likely to be allocated to external examination-orientated groups or to gain success in these than their peers. There are indications that their potential may not be being realised. It is argued that while language support for the bilingual child is important, account should also be taken of a more general cultural dominance in the school system and stereotyped low expectations from teachers which may feed racial bias in institutions. The data show that the LEA policies, though benevolent in intention, demonstrate institutional racism in effect. With four case studies from observations in Bradford schools, models are developed for practice that has potential for power-sharing and greater equity of opportunity -for pupils, involving respect for cultural diversity and antiracist education strategies supporting and supported by community participation in schools. It is argued that white educationists need to listen to black clients, pupils and their parents, involving them in dialogue to ascertain their real needs, to implement appropriate policy. As there was a considerable lapse of time between the field work research and writing up of this thesis, and its final presentation, an addendum (with bibliography) reviews some of the research and literature in the fleld since 1980. This situates the field work historically. The issues raised and discussed {{in the context of the}} 1970 's are still far from being solved. The additional work stregthens, rather than changes my original conclusion that society is locked into a cycle of inequality. A counter-hegemony must emerge from 'grass-roots', community initiatives with a values-base linked not to self-seeking or confrontational power group politics but to a notion of the common good...|$|R
