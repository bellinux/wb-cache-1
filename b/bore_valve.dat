40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the results of}} experimental work and simulations of pressure surges resulting from fast closing valves and activation of an emergency release coupling (ERC) in ship-to-ship LNG transfer. The first part {{presents the results of}} an ambient water flow test with a fast closing 4 -inch full <b>bore</b> <b>valve</b> in combination with a 4 -inch flexible multi-composite hose. High amplitude pressure surges up to 4 times the working pressure occur upstream of the valve. Pressure surge amplitudes strongly depend on valve closing time and flow rate. The propagation speed in the upstream hose is lowered considerably due to the hose flexibility. Furthermore the temporarily deformation of the hose results in loss of energy and acoustic damping of the pressure surge amplitudes. The measurement results are compared to the results of modeling. Acoustic damping and propagation speed of sound show a non-linear behavior of the hose, due to a varying internal pressure, which is not captured in the present modeling techniques. The second part of the paper {{describes the}} results of a full scale flow test on an 8 -inch ERC (KLAW make) for LNG ship-to-ship transfer (Figure 1). The ERC in the test is located downstream of an 8 -inch 15 -meter long multi-composite flexible hose. The test is intended to investigate operational and mechanical integrity, spill rate and the impact of pressure transients and shock loads on the ERC including upstream hose and downstream piping...|$|E

The worm larvae preferred hosts with thick lamellose shells, such as those of the clitambonitids, especially Clitambonites schmidti. The boring organisms were size-selective; they preferred large adult specimens. The majority of the borings are oriented, and living hosts were preferred to dead shells.

50|$|The {{mechanical}} {{history of}} the class is very complex, and both Wilson Worsdell and Vincent Raven made changes to the class. All the Class C compounds were rebuilt as Class C1 simple. Many examples were later rebuilt with a superheater and others had the original Joy valve gear replaced with piston valves and Stephenson valve gear.

[...] Roy Lunn recalled: [...] "We wanted as much displacement - for power and torque - as possible {{within the confines of}} bore centers of the tooling.

40|$|In wind performance, skilled {{practitioners}} regularly report manipulating their {{vocal tract}} configuration {{to change the}} timbre, pitch and to produce other musical effects. With instruments such as the saxophone and didgeridoo, one might expect moderate coupling of the tract, <b>bore</b> and <b>valve.</b> In the recorder, one would not expect the tract to be strongly coupled due {{to the presence of}} the wind-way. However, some recorder players actively teach the involvement of the tract to elicit varied musical effects. To understand the acoustical contribution of the vocal tract in recorder performance, we measured the tract’s acoustic impedance spectrum during performance. We used a method developed earlier to study the vocal tract impedance spectra in saxophone and didgeridoo performance. This technique is fast, robust (noise levels in the mouth are high), and importantly, allows the measurement plane (inside the mouth) to be distant from the transducers. Placing the measurement head within an alto recorder mouthpiece enables us to “look into ” the vocal tract and make acoustic impedance measurements as the musician plays. In this manner, vocal tract impedances of two tongue configurations associated with differing timbre were measured on a virtuoso player, revealing differences in the range below 2 kHz...|$|R
50|$|Like all {{contemporary}} World Rally Cars, the car {{is heavily}} modified from the production version, with which it shares only the basic shape and {{some parts of the}} bodyshell. The car features four wheel drive, rather than the front wheel drive of the road car. The engine used in the 2007 Focus WRC is based on Ford's 2.0 Litre Duratec from other models in the Focus range as rallying rules do not permit the standard 2.5 Litre engine of the Focus ST or road going RS. As with most rally cars, the 2.0 Litre engine is heavily modified and performance was increased using a turbocharger. Also the 2009 Ford Focus WRC uses a Ford 1998cc Pipo built l4 Duratec WRC engine (Four Cylinders, 16 <b>Valves,</b> <b>Bore</b> 85 mm and Stroke 88 mm), Pi electronic engine Management system, Garrett Turbocharger (with required 34 mm inlet restrictor), air intercooler, and a catalytic converter.|$|R
50|$|Quadrajet carburetors have {{mechanical}} secondary {{throttle plates}} {{operated by a}} progressive linkage; the primaries open before the secondaries, and use on-demand air valve plates above the secondary throttle plates. The air valves are connected by a cam and linkage to the secondary fuel metering rods. As the airflow increases through the secondary <b>bores,</b> the air <b>valves</b> are pushed down, rotating a cam that lifts the secondary metering rods. The secondary rods are tapered {{in a similar fashion}} to the primary metering rods, effectively increasing the size of the fuel metering holes as the rods are lifted and delivering more fuel. Therefore, the position of the air valve will control both fuel and air flow through the secondary venturis, even if the secondary throttle plates are fully opened. Thus the Quadrajet acts like a vacuum-secondary carburetor and only delivers more fuel as it is needed.|$|R

50|$|The 379 cuin L V8 is {{the main}} variant of the Boss engine. The V8 shares design {{similarities}} with the modular engine family such as a deep-skirt block with cross-bolted main caps, crankshaft-driven gerotor oil pump, overhead cam valve train arrangement, and bellhousing bolt pattern. In particular, the 6.2-L features a two-valve per cylinder SOHC valve train with roller-rocker shafts and two spark plugs per cylinder, as well as dual-equal variable cam timing. Just as notable is that they use a much wider 4.53 in bore spacing (compared to the Modular's 3.937 in), allowing {{for the use of}} larger <b>bore</b> diameters and <b>valves.</b> The 6.2-L V8 has a bore diameter of 4.0150 in with a 3.740 in stroke.

5000|$|An {{alternative}} {{approach to the}} problem of eliminating the tetrode kink was introduced by Hivac in 1935. It was found by J.H Owen Harries that if the separation of the anode from the screen grid were varied, a critical separation could be found (about 3 cm) where the kink in the tetrode's anode characteristic disappeared, and the amplification of the valve became particularly distortion-free. Both fidelity and efficiency exceeded those of the available pentodes of the time. A range of tetrodes of this type were introduced, aimed at the domestic receiver market, some having 2V directly heated filaments, intended for low-power battery-operated sets, others with 4V or higher, indirectly heated cathodes for mains operation. Output powers ranged from 0.5W to 11.5W [...] Confusingly, several of these new <b>valves</b> <b>bore</b> the same type number as existing pentodes with almost identical characteristics.

2500|$|The word {{trombone}} {{derives from}} Italian tromba (trumpet) and -one (a suffix meaning [...] "large"), so the name means [...] "large trumpet". The trombone has a predominantly cylindrical <b>bore</b> like its <b>valved</b> counterpart the baritone and {{in contrast to}} its conical valved counterparts, the euphonium and the horn. The most frequently encountered trombones are the tenor trombone and bass trombone. The most common variant, the tenor, is a non-transposing instrument pitched in B, an octave below the B trumpet and an octave above the B tuba. The once common E alto trombone became less widely used as improvements in technique extended the upper range of the tenor, but it is now enjoying a resurgence due to its lighter sonority which is appreciated in many classical and early romantic works. Trombone music, along with music for euphonium and tuba, is typically written in concert pitch in either bass or tenor clef, although exceptions do occur, notably in almost all brass-band music where tenor trombone {{is presented as a}} B transposing instrument, written in treble clef.|$|R
40|$|University of Minnesota M. S. M. E. thesis. July 2016. Major: Mechanical Engineering. Advisor: William Northrop. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); vii, 46 pages. In recent years, {{there has been}} growing interest in alternative cycles to the standard 4 -stroke Otto engine for improving efficiency and lowering emissions of spark-ignition engines. One proposed concept is the 5 -stroke engine, which uses two cylinders, a combustion cylinder and an expansion cylinder with a transfer port between them. Excess pressure in the combustion cylinder can be further expanded by using a second expansion cylinder to harness additional work. The expansion cylinder runs on a two-stroke cycle, allowing the use of two combustion cylinders to one expansion cylinder in a three-cylinder configuration to increase efficiency. Previous work has investigated the performance of prototype 5 -stroke engines compared to 1 -D modeling results; none have conducted a thorough study on the interactions of various design parameters. In this paper, we explore {{the results of a}} 1 -D parametric modeling study to examine the effect of various parameters such as <b>bore,</b> stroke, <b>valve</b> lift profiles, and compression ratio on engine brake thermal efficiencies of a three cylinder 5 -stroke engine. Over the range of values examined our work indicates that an expansion cylinder bore to stoke ratio of 1. 4 and expansion ratio 17. 5 produces maximum brake thermal efficiency. The intake, transfer, and exhaust lift profiles have a strong effect on brake thermal efficiency with valve opening and closing points playing a key role. Additionally, reducing the offset between the combustion and expansion cylinder improves the timing of the transfer process leading to improved brake thermal efficiency. Lastly, the transfer volume between the combustion and expansion cylinder has minimal effect on the brake thermal efficiency...|$|R
50|$|The new boiler {{made the}} {{so-called}} Reko-01 (Reko {{is short for}} Rekolokomotive) into the most powerful German express train steam locomotive. In addition to a combustion chamber and the well-known IfS mixer-preheater, the 01.5's boiler was fitted with three full <b>bore</b> boiler safety <b>valves</b> (Ackermann valves, nominal width 60). The engines were given Trofimoff valves and, apart from 01 501 and 01 520, new welded cylinders. The new boiler came with a new, welded driver's cab with upholstered seats, side-pull regulator and other improvements to the working conditions of the locomotive crew, {{as well as an}} Indusi system. The latter was required for the border-crossing traffic to Bebra and Hamburg-Altona and services on the Dresden-Berlin line. Because the coupled wheelsets on many engines had to be replaced due to fractured spokes, eight examples were fitted with Boxpok wheels made of cast iron, like those already used in the Soviet Union and the United States. These did not prove themselves, however, due to manufacturing defects and were later swapped out for spoked wheels from retired 01s. In order to hide the ugly wheelsets, the Boxpok locomotives and several other vehicles were fitted with full skirts.|$|R

The focal point of the study is the extension and expansion of the available performance vocabulary for trombone, using a series of case studies, scores and existing research. The expansion of techniques can be particularly identified by studying some of the most prominent performers and composers as well as the changing role of the trombone in the context of ensemble performance and some of the most prominent works that changed the role of the trombone for its future use through to the twenty first century. Included in this study is an overview of the change of the trombone due to the improvement of manufacture and addition of the larger <b>bore</b> and thumb <b>valve</b> and how these developments affected technique. The work of performers and composers Arthur Pryor, Tommy Dorsey, Luciano Berio, Christian Lindberg and Jan Sandstrom is looked at in more detail to establish their role in the development of trombone techniques. Important developments in technique in this study include the use of voice, mutes, theatricals, electronics, microtones and early twentieth century developments such as technical virtuosity and the singing style legato. ...|$|R

50|$|Manifolds {{intended}} for use with sets where a regulator is provided for each cylinder {{are connected to the}} cylinder valves upstream of the cylinder valve seat, to a connecting port provided specifically for this purpose. Two styles of connection are available for this arrangement - face seal, and barrel seal. Face seal connections are similar to the DIN regulator connection seal, and consist of an o-ring in a groove machined into the end of the manifold tube, which is clamped against the face of the valve port by a threaded component. Face seals are simple and rugged, but rely on tight connection for a reliable seal, and do not allow any adjustment for cylinder centre distance. Barrel seals use one or two O-rings in grooves around the end of the manifold tube, which seal against the <b>bore</b> of the <b>valve</b> port. They are usually screwed into the valve port with handed thread, and locked with a lock-nut. They are generally slightly less rugged than face seal manifolds, and more vulnerable to thread damage during assembly, but allow a small amount of cylinder centre distance adjustment, and provide a reliable seal even if not completely tight. Manifolds of this type are commonly supplied in sets comprising a manifold and compatible left and right side cylinder valves with a choice of neck thread specification. The working components for all three valves in the set are usually identical.|$|R
