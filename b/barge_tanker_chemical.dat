Sneath. The site was limited in size but it became an extremely important and credible shipyard run by the Inglis family to exceptionally high standards. From this Yard there came many classic designs and creations of maritime beauty and success, along with the normal workmanlike dredgers, tugs, coasters, <b>barges,</b> <b>tankers</b> and whalers. After the death of Anthony Inglis in 1884 his son John Inglis took over the management of the family firm.|$|R

50|$|An {{additional}} {{assumption is}} {{that there would be}} sufficient pipeline infrastructure to deliver increased Canadian oil production to export markets. If this were a limiting factor, there could be impacts on Canadian crude oil prices, constraining future production growth. Another {{assumption is that}} US markets will continue to absorb increased Canadian exports. Rapid growth of tight oil production in the US, Canada's primary oil export market, has greatly reduced US reliance on imported crude. The potential for Canadian oil exports to alternative markets such as Asia is also uncertain. There are increasing political obstacles to building any new pipelines to deliver oil in Canada and the US. In November 2015, U.S. President Barack Obama rejected the proposal to build the Keystone XL pipeline from Alberta to Steele City, Nebraska. In the absence of new pipeline capacity, companies are increasingly shipping bitumen to US markets by railway, river <b>barge,</b> <b>tanker,</b> and other transportation methods.
