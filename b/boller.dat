25|$|The Jeff Tedford era {{began with}} a bang, as California {{defeated}} Baylor 70–22, {{and went on to}} finish 7–5, their first winning season since 1993. The 2002 team defeated three nationally ranked opponents on the road {{for the first time in}} school history including California's first win over conference foe Washington in 26 years, and won the annual Big Game against archrival Stanford for the first time in eight years. Another highlight of that year was the emergence of Kyle <b>Boller,</b> a senior quarterback who was a three-year starter under Holmoe, throwing for a total of 36 touchdowns and 38 interception. In his only year under Tedford, <b>Boller</b> threw for 28 touchdowns and 10 interceptions. In 2003 he was an NFL first round pick by the Baltimore Ravens.

The Panthers went into halftime with a 13–7 lead.|$|E
25|$|On {{the opening}} drive {{of the second}} half, the Ravens drove 73yards and regained the lead on a 17-yard run by Willis McGahee, his sixth rush of the 8-play drive. The Patriots {{answered}} on their next possession with an 11-play, 72-yard drive that included a dump-off pass to Maroney for 36yards. A 3-yard touchdown pass from Brady to Moss tied the game again at 17–17. In the first minute of the fourth quarter, Baltimore got the lead again, 24–17, as <b>Boller</b> completed a 1-yard touchdown pass to tight end Daniel Wilcox after an 8-play, 56-yard drive. The Patriots went 3-and-out on their next drive, and a 33-yard Yamon Figurs punt return coupled with a 5-yard Pierre Woods penalty gave the Ravens the ball at the Patriots' 26-yard line with less than 13minutes remaining in the game. After two McGahee runs for 1yard and a false start penalty gave the Ravens a 3rd and 14 situation, <b>Boller</b> was intercepted at the Patriots' 1-yard line by Sanders to hold the Ravens scoreless on the drive. Sanders' 42-yard return gave the Patriots the ball at their own 43-yard line, and another Maroney dump-off pass for 43yards brought the Patriots to the Ravens' 24-yard line. The Patriots then {{failed to make the}} first down, and Gostkowski kicked another field goal, this one from 38yards out, to cut the Ravens' lead to 24–20. The Patriots defense, which gave up almost 60 first half rushing yards to McGahee, held McGahee to 1yard on the Ravens' next drive and forced a 3-and-out. The Patriots' ensuing drive brought them to the Ravens' 31-yard line before a 10-yard Dan Koppen penalty and incompletion forced another punt. With less than 6minutes remaining, the Patriots defense again prevented the Ravens offense from completing a first down and got the ball back with 3:30 left in the game.|$|E

25|$|In {{the first}} Sunday night {{football}} {{game of the}} 2005 NFL regular season, the Colts came into town to face the Baltimore Ravens. This game was a game of mistakes by Baltimore, and taking advantage of miscues for Indianapolis. Baltimore QB Kyle <b>Boller</b> threw an interception for a touchdown before being injured, and his replacement, Anthony Wright ended up throwing two more interceptions. Baltimore kicker Matt Stover missed three field goals, and gave the Colts more opportunities to score. The Colts also had three takeaways, and the Ravens had none, however, the Colts punted seven times while Baltimore only punted four times. Indianapolis QB Peyton Manning finished the game 21 for 36, with 254 yards passing, and two touchdown passes. Ravens QB Anthony Wright finished the game 19 for 31, with 214 yards passing, one touchdown, and two interceptions.

25|$|For {{their third}} night game {{in as many}} weeks, the Patriots flew to M Bank Stadium to face the 4–7 Ravens. On the first drive of the game, a 42-yard Stallworth {{reception}} and three Ravens penalties helped set up a 1st and goal from the Ravens' 3-yard line. The Patriots next four plays gained a net of zero yards, and Gostkowksi kicked a 21-yard field goal to give the Patriots a 3–0 lead. After an exchange of punts, the Ravens took the lead with Kyle <b>Boller</b> completing a 4-yard touchdown pass to Derrick Mason after a 70-yard drive. In the second quarter, Baltimore increased its lead when kicker Matt Stover converted a 29-yard field goal to cap a 12-play, 55-yard drive. On the ensuing drive, the Patriots responded with a 9-play, 60-yard drive that included two more Stallworth receptions and two more Ravens penalties and ended in a 1-yard Evans touchdown run. Two possessions later, with 56seconds remaining the first half, Brady threw his fifth interception of the season, this one to safety Ed Reed, who proceeded to fumble on the return. Watson recovered the fumble and the Patriots went into halftime in a 10–10 tie.|$|E
25|$|Starting {{from their}} own 27-yard line, the Patriots got to midfield on the second play of their drive with a 23-yard Watson reception. An {{incompletion}} and 9-yard Faulk catch brought 3rd and 1, where Brady rushed for 2yards and the first down. After the two-minute warning, another 9-yard Faulk catch on 3rd and 10 gave the Patriots a 4th and 1 from the Ravens' 30-yard line with 1:48 remaining. Brady attempted another sneak and was stopped short of the first, but the play was nullified by a timeout called by Ravens defensive coordinator Rex Ryan just before the snap. Heath Evans lost a yard on the Patriots' next attempt, but a false start penalty by Russ Hochstein nullified the play {{and set up a}} 4th and 6. Brady scrambled for the first down and additionally, Ravens cornerback Samari Rolle was penalized for illegal contact to give the Patriots another 5yards, moving them to the Ravens' 18-yard line with 1:38 left on the clock. A 5-yard Faulk rush and two incompletions gave the Patriots another fourth down situation. Brady's throw to Watson in the end zone fell incomplete, but the Patriots again received a fresh set of downs after Ravens defensive back Jamaine Winborne was called for defensive holding. On 1st and goal from the Ravens' 8-yard line with 55seconds remaining, the Patriots took their first lead since the first quarter on a Gaffney touchdown reception that was upheld by official review. After the play, Ravens linebacker Bart Scott received two 15-yard unsportsmanlike conduct penalties after throwing an official's flag into the stands, and Reed was flagged for being offsides on the extra point, setting up a Patriots kickoff from the Ravens' 35-yard line. After a Gostkowski touchback on the kickoff, the Ravens completed two passes, bringing them to their own 45-yard line with 8seconds remaining. <b>Boller</b> threw a Hail Mary pass that was caught by wide receiver Mark Clayton at the Patriots' 3-yard line, but he was tackled shy of the end zone as time expired.|$|E
50|$|The {{sponsors}} {{were very}} pleased with the publicity generated that year so for the 1963 Indianapolis 500 Crosthwaite produced the innovative Harvey Aluminium Special <b>‘roller</b> skate car’ with the then pioneering smaller profile (12-inch diameter) and wide racing tyres (front 7 inches and rear 9 inches wide) and wheels. Because of the small size of the front wheels Crosthwaite had to work out a way to mount the front brakes inboard {{in order to get a}} reasonable size disc. It was the first time that this had been attempted. Mickey Thompson took five cars to Indianapolis. Two of the previous year's design with Chevrolet V8 engines and three <b>'roller</b> skate' cars. One of the new cars, the Harvey Titanium Special, featured a lightweight titanium chassis. Formula 1 World Champion Graham Hill test drove one of the cars but decided not to race because commitments in Europe meant he had insufficient time to practice. Al Miller II raced one of the modified 1962 cars to 9th place despite only qualifying in 31st position. Duane Carter qualified one of the roller skate cars 15th but was only placed 23rd after an engine failure on the 100th lap. The small tyre sizes and low car weights caused complaints amongst the old hands and owners, so for future races cars were restricted to minimum tyre sizes and minimum car weight.|$|R

5000|$|Marvel {{president}} Terry Stewart {{was seeking}} to diversify Marvel's output beyond superhero comics; noticing the popularity of Revolutionary Comics' Rock 'N' Roll Comics series, which featured unauthorized biographies of bands, Stewart {{felt that there was}} a market for comics based on musicians.

The concept was met with some skepticism internally; assistant editor Karl <b>Bollers</b> recalled that [...] "the superhero heads in the office heard that we were doing rock comics, there was a feeling of, 'Oh my god, this is terrible!'", showing concerns that the idea would either be too kitschy, or {{follow in the footsteps of}} Revolutionary, which had been sued twice by musicians over their portrayals in Rock 'N' Roll Comics.|$|R
40|$|The overall {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{illuminate}} meanings of living with severe chronic heart failure (CHF) in palliative advanced home care (PAHC) as disclosed through patients’, close relatives’ and nurses’ narratives. This thesis comprises four papers that illuminate the phenomenon from various perspectives and with different focus. In paper I four patients with severe CHF in PAHC were interviewed. In paper II three of their close relatives were interviewed. In paper III one {{man and his wife}} in PAHC were interviewed at 3 - 5 month intervals over a 4. 5 -years period. In paper IV 11 nurses in PAHC were interviewed. In all papers narrative interviews were conducted and the text was interpreted using a phenomenological-hermeneutic method. The result shows that meanings of living with severe CHF in PAHC is to be ‘knocking on death’s door’ yet surviving. This means never knowing what to expect of tomorrow as one suffers from a complex array of unpredictable, interwoven symptoms. The course of the illness forces sufferer to ride a symbolical <b>‘roller</b> coaster’, an ongoing oscillation between ‘ups and downs’. Being offered a safety belt in the <b>‘roller</b> coaster’ by the PAHC team means feelings of safety (I). Meanings of being a close relative of a person with severe CHF in PAHC is to be following the life- threatening ups and downs that the ill person goes through. It is like being a fellow passenger on the <b>‘roller</b> coaster’ ride that is their loved one’s disease, with burdensome responsibility for easing the ‘downs’ and supporting the ‘ups’. This means being on primary call, always on standby to mediate security and pleasure. In the deepest downs it is also to call for the back-up call i. e. the PAHC team (II). Meanings of living the ‘ups and downs’ over time is being captive in a roller-coaster ride, side by side, with the ‘ups and downs’ caused by the illness. Living close to death is inescapable when recurrent periods of deepest ‘downs’ force one to face that one’s life together is coming to an end. The relationship between the spouses is severely tested but seems to withstand the strain and meaning is found in togetherness in life. Sharing the safety belt on the <b>‘roller</b> coaster’, offered by the PAHC team, evokes feelings of security. However, the safety belt is adjusted to the man with severe CHF leaving the wife partly without comfort and at times uncertain, especially in the deepest ‘downs’ (III). Meanings of being a palliative nurse for patients with severe CHF in PAHC is being firmly rooted and guided by the values of palliative culture. Being a facilitator for the patient with CHF to live his/her everydaylife in the best way possible is difficult, challenging but overall positive. The nurses get into a tight corner when palliative culture values clash and do not correspond to nurses’ interpretation of what is good for the patient with severe CHF. There is a limit to nurses’ pliability to patients’ and close relatives’ will, as they are strongly convinced that resuscitation is not an option. Nurses have already made up their mind about that they do not perform heart- lung resuscitation (IV). The comprehensive understanding is that meanings of living with severe CHF in PAHC is being captive in a ‘roller-coaster’ life with varying periods between unpredictable improvement and deterioration of the body, for the rest of life. Living with the unpredictable, deteriorated body means to oscillate between enduring the suffering in ‘downs’ and enjoying life in ‘ups’ (I-III). Living with death so close over and over again i. e. being in a limit situation evokes feelings of uncertainty (I-IV) and confidence (I-III). Being positive dependent on PAHC facilitates a life as normal as possible in togetherness at home (I-IV). The comprehensive understanding of the four papers (I-IV) are discussed in the light of a theoretical framework from the German psychiatrist and philosopher Karl Jaspers thoughts about limit situation, the Danish philosopher K. E Lögstrup thoughts about the ethical demand, palliative theories and relevant empirical studies...|$|R
50|$|In {{the late}} 1950s an {{experimental}} Decca chain {{was set up}} in the United States, in the New York area, to be used for navigating the Vertol 107 helicopters of New York Airways.

Use of Decca was essential because its signals could be received down to sea level, were not subject to the line-of-sight limitations of VOR/DME and did not suffer the slant-range errors that create problems with VOR/DME close to the transmitters.
