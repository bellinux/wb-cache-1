5000|$|Within {{competitive}} markets, {{markets are}} often defined by their sub-sectors, {{such as the}} [...] "short-term" [...] or [...] "long-term" [...] market, the [...] "seasonal" [...] or [...] "summer" [...] market, or the [...] "broad" [...] or [...] "remainder" [...] market. For example, in otherwise competitive market economies, where {{a large majority of}} the commercial exchanges are competitively determined by long term contracts and therefore long term market clearing prices, a “remainder market” is one where prices are determined by the small part of the market that deals with the availability of whatever is not cleared via long term transactions. For example, in the sugar industry, about 94% to 95% of the market clearing price is determined by long term supply and purchase contracts. The <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>market,</b> and world sugar prices, are determined by the ad hoc demand for the 5% to 6% that is not sold via long-term contracts; prices in the “remainder market” fluctuate more widely and are determined by short term supply and demand conditions; quoted prices can be significantly higher or lower than the long-term market clearing price. Similarly, in the US real estate housing market, appraisal prices can be determined by both short term or long term characteristics depending on short-term supply and demand factors; this can result in large price variations for a property at one location.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{argues in}} favour of a reform of the European Union Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) that makes the system more {{responsive}} to unexpected price shocks. The paper proposed rules based mechanism for withdrawing and injecting allowances from the market based on price trends. Key points: Following the 2008 economic recession, the price of European Union Allowances (EUAs) unsurprisingly dropped, following a fall in demand. However the low price has persisted despite mild economic growth within Europe {{since the beginning of}} the crisis. Policy regulators are currently unable to respond to unforeseen changes in economic circumstances, technology advancement and complementary policies that generate downward price pressure. The decision by the European Commission to temporarily withdraw 900 million EUAs from the market will have little impact on the long term market price expectation. Other one-off measures would also leave the system vulnerable, addressing the symptoms but not the cause of structural weakness in the system. What is needed is a responsiveness mechanism that enables the European Commission to respond to unanticipated shocks. This ‘rules-based reserve management mechanism’ would have a double trigger system in place. A price trend ‘trigger’ to determine when intervention would be needed, and a volume ‘trigger’, that would determine the amount of EUAs to inject or withdraw. This would encourage self-adjusting behaviour from market participants, anticipating an intervention by looking at the price trend over the specified period, thus acting in their own interest to buy, sell or banking their EUAs in advance of an intervention. This behaviour would help regulate the supply-demand <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>market</b> which would effectively limit the need for an intervention to exceptional circumstances...|$|E

The paper analyses and proposes an answer to <b>the</b> question <b>of</b> how <b>the</b> Russian revolution is reflected in <b>the</b> work <b>of</b> John Maynard Keynes. <b>The</b> starting point <b>of</b> <b>the</b> analysis is an interesting yet not very well known episode <b>of</b> <b>the</b> economist’s life: a period when Keynes, then a British Treasury official, was entrusted with <b>the</b> task <b>of</b> creating a currency for Northern Russia. The ensuing design and architecture <b>of</b> <b>the</b> North Russian rouble virtually became an opportunity for Keynes to put into practice some of his general currency-related ideas, and the entire project influenced Keynes’s economic thought in two specific ways. First, the Russian experience can be traced in the economist’s reflections on two fundamentally different financial policies: the inflationary approach adopted by the Bolsheviks, and <b>the</b> anti-inflationary strategy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> British government. Keynes made use of his experience with the Russian hyperinflation in a multitude of his works, especially in the papers on inflation and its consequences.

40|$|In {{the past}} decades, the European and Romanian economies have been {{strongly}} affected by major changes which have influenced also the labor market: <b>the</b> alert pace <b>of</b> <b>the</b> international economic integration, <b>the</b> creation <b>of</b> work division {{in order to}} protect some economic sectors, the accelerated development and implementation <b>of</b> new technologies, <b>the</b> increase <b>of</b> <b>the</b> demographic aging trends. In <b>the</b> context <b>of</b> <b>the</b> amplified labor force crisis, the present paper will analyze some dysfunctions which have affected especially the regional labor market: the chronic unemployment, the mismatch between the demand and <b>the</b> offer <b>of</b> jobs and <b>the</b> localized consequences <b>of</b> <b>the</b> labor migration. The approach on these aspects was done in a vaster context intended to analyze <b>the</b> regional labor <b>market</b> <b>of</b> Galati and Braila, starting from the existent imbalances on these <b>markets.</b> <b>The</b> present paper starts from the premise that <b>the</b> proposal <b>of</b> some measurements which should lead to a <b>balancing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> regional working <b>market,</b> must take into account {{the way in which the}} direct actors involved are defining these obstacles and opportunities for professional (re) insertion. In order to highlight both the opinions and <b>the</b> perceptions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> participants on <b>the</b> labor <b>market,</b> <b>the</b> research had to take place on two levels: among the groups with a difficult position on <b>the</b> labor <b>market</b> and among <b>the</b> employers...|$|R

The study includes <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sales promotion instruments in commercial space, perceived by consumers and assessment of their impact on purchasing decisions. The study was carried out on <b>the</b> basis <b>of</b> a standardized authoring individual interview questionnaire on nationwide random-quota, registered trials, in 2007 – 2012, as a part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> study <b>of</b> consumer behaviour performed in <b>the</b> dairy <b>market</b> for KZSM (National Association <b>of</b> Dairy Cooperatives). <b>The</b> results confi rm that <b>the</b> effect <b>of</b> promotion activities is a high visibility by consumers and change of their purchasing decisions. The most important determinant of consumer purchasing behaviour are the price promotions.

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>marketing</b> {{practices}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> companies {{show that}} not all of them are observing ethical and moral standards and they manipulate the consumers. This paper has as main goal to examine the most usual unethical techniques, <b>the</b> present status <b>of</b> consumers’ power and how more power could work for a new marketing paradigm. There are many unethical marketing techniques which could be found in deceptive product recipes, packaging, promotion, prices and in other areas. Most consumers have no appropriate powers and tools to counteract the manipulation techniques and feel they have fewer rights than the marketers. <b>The</b> current state <b>of</b> empowerment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> consumer show that the European consumers are not in the best position in <b>the</b> <b>market</b> as <b>the</b> Consumer Empowerment Index proves. This matter of facts emphasizes a strong need for a better empowerment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> consumers. The consumer which has more power and wisely use it could improve <b>the</b> <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> power in <b>the</b> <b>market.</b> But <b>the</b> consumers should have a proactive buying behavior in order to get such results. These revolutionary consumers attack <b>the</b> structural roots <b>of</b> <b>the</b> social, economic and political problems which produces a new market ideology as a part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> new tier <b>of</b> transnational institutional ideology.

40|$|<b>The</b> purpose <b>of</b> {{this study}} is to explore the faculty-administrative consultative {{relationship}} at entrepreneurial community colleges and to examine <b>the</b> role <b>of</b> faculty governance in both ensuring quality and allowing the college to move nimbly to address <b>market</b> needs. In <b>the</b> current competitive environment, community college presidents, academic administrators and faculty would benefit from an exploration of faculty-administrative consultation regarding entrepreneurial academic activity. Key questions that guide this study include: How do community colleges <b>balance</b> <b>the</b> demands <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>market</b> with <b>the</b> deliberative nature <b>of</b> faculty governance? What elements are in place at community colleges that support or constrain an environment that can be characterized as both entrepreneurial and collegial? What are the conditions at community colleges that support or constrain faculty-administrative relationships and <b>the</b> governance <b>of</b> academic entrepreneurial activities?^ Qualitative case studies at three community colleges in the same state system highlight <b>the</b> complex influences <b>of</b> faculty governance and the faculty-administrative relationship in a variety of entrepreneurial contexts. While community colleges constitute a different sector of higher education than research universities, the researcher discovered that <b>the</b> five elements <b>of</b> collegial entrepreneurialism that emerged from Burton R. Clark 2 ̆ 7 s (2000) study of European universities in the mid- 1990 s were observed in somewhat different forms at the three community colleges in this study. No administrators expressed frustration with lengthy faculty debate that delayed a quick response to <b>the</b> <b>market.</b> However, even though all of these faculties have streamlined their curriculum review processes and are willing to accelerate faculty review when a quick response is required, {{there was no evidence that}} faculty at these colleges have in any way abdicated governance responsibilities to satisfy <b>the</b> <b>market.</b> Both faculty and administrators at these three colleges reported a cooperative faculty-administrative relationship in support of new initiatives, and a willingness to work out differences together when they arise. ...|$|R
