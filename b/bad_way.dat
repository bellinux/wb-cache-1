He learns that the man in the picture was extremely wealthy and lucky for a short period, before he died with a giant oversized penis. Mulder believes the woman in the picture is responsible for everything, and determines she is a jinniyah, or a female jinn. Mulder goes to the Stokes residence and asks Leslie to hand her over, presuming her to be kept in a box. It turns out, however, that she is not in the box, but back in the storage facility, where Mulder also finds pictures of the jinniyah next to Benito Mussolini in the 1930s and next to Richard Nixon in the 1960s, two men that had a lot of power and lost it in a <b>bad</b> <b>way.</b>|$|E

25|$|In {{front of}} 14,623, {{far short of}} a sell-out, Mayweather won via TKO in the 10th round, surpassing Rocky Marciano and setting {{the record for the}} longest active unbeaten streak in a {{professional}} career at 50–0. In the opening round, Mayweather, as per previous fights, started slow to work out McGregor's tactics. In his post-fight interview, he revealed {{it was part of the}} game plan to let McGregor punch himself out in the early rounds. McGregor won the first round on all three judges scorecards, the same case could have been made for the opening three rounds. McGregor was warned a few times through the fight for hitting behind the head, but no points were deducted by referee Robert Byrd. By the fourth round, McGregor began to tire and breathe heavily with his mouth open. Mayweather started to take control and landed with his right hands. For the next few rounds, McGregor came out throwing shots in the opening 30 seconds, but immediately tired, giving Mayweather enough time to carry on landing clean shots and winning the rounds. By round 9, McGregor had almost nothing left. Although he didn't look hurt, he was very fatigued and his face started showing redness. Two of the judges scored the round 10–8 for Mayweather. In round 10, McGregor staggered across the ring and was in a <b>bad</b> <b>way</b> against the ropes as Mayweather landed some hard shots. With McGregor barely on his feet after a few unanswered punches, the referee waived the fight off. The time of stoppage was 1 minute and 5 seconds of round 10.|$|E
500|$|On December 13, newly signed Mets closer Francisco Rodríguez {{added his}} sentiments to the fray. [...] "Of course we're {{going to be}} the frontrunner. Of course we're {{going to be the}} team to beat", Rodriguez told reporters. [...] "I don't want there to be a controversy. I don't want the other team to take it personally, or take it in a <b>bad</b> <b>way.</b> But I'm a really {{competitive}} guy. I like to win. If they ask me, 'Oh, which ballclub is going to win the National League East?' It's going to be the Mets. Easy question." ...|$|E

One, there are four other teams in our division who are going to make sure that doesn't happen, and two, has anyone ever heard of plagiarism? [...] That was pretty good, especially coming from him. He's a quiet guy, so it was probably shocking when he said it. Not shocking in a <b>bad</b> <b>way,</b> like 'Wow, I can't believe he said that.'

500|$|... "Little Girl in the Big Ten" [...] {{was written}} by {{producer}} Jon Vitti and directed by Lauren MacMullan. The idea for the episode was pitched by Vitti, who suggested an episode in which Lisa meets girls who {{thought she was a}} college student. It was first broadcast on the Fox network in the United States on May 12, 2002. Jean thought the idea was [...] "brilliant", and the subplot involving Bart in a [...] "germ-free" [...] plastic bubble was conceived by the writers wanting to make [...] "the most different subplot from an intellectual college plot" [...] they could think of. A scene in the episode shows Lisa talking to Bart on the branch of a tree in their garden. Bart says the line [...] "You can't believe what that sunset looks like to me", to which Lisa replies [...] "That's not a sunset, that's a bird on fire." [...] Originally, Lisa's line read [...] " [...] that's a plane on fire," [...] however, after the September 11 attacks, the line was considered offensive and was changed. [...] " [...] since we work so far ahead we usually do these things that are sort of timeless stories," [...] Jean said, [...] "but {{every once in a while}} there's something that turns out to be ironic in a <b>bad</b> <b>way,</b> then we have to change it." ...|$|E
500|$|By January 1956 {{the author}} Ian Fleming had {{published}} three novels—Casino Royale in 1953, Live and Let Die in 1954 and Moonraker in 1955. A fourth, Diamonds Are Forever, was being edited {{and prepared for}} production. That month Fleming travelled to his Goldeneye estate in Jamaica to write From Russia, with Love. He followed his usual practice, which he later outlined in Books and Bookmen magazine: [...] "I write for about three hours in the morning... and I do another hour's work between six and seven in the evening. I never correct anything and I {{never go back to}} see what I have written... By following my formula, you write 2,000 words a day." [...] He returned to London in March that year with a 228-page first-draft manuscript that he subsequently altered more heavily than any of his other works. One of the significant re-writes changed Bond's fate; Fleming had become disenchanted with his books and wrote to his friend, the American author Raymond Chandler: [...] "My muse is in a very <b>bad</b> <b>way...</b> I am getting fed up with Bond and it has been very difficult to make him go through his tawdry tricks." [...] Fleming re-wrote {{the end of the novel}} in April 1956 to make Klebb poison Bond, which allowed him to finish the series with the death of the character if he wanted. Fleming's first draft ended with Bond and Romanova enjoying a romance. By January 1957 Fleming had decided he would write another story, and began work on Dr. No in which Bond recovers from his poisoning and is sent to Jamaica.|$|E

2500|$|In 1825, Franc Serafin Metelko {{proposed}} {{his version}} of the alphabet called [...] "metelčica". However, it was banned in 1833 in favour of the bohoričica after the so-called Suit of the Letters (Črkarska pravda) (18301833), which was won by France Prešeren and Matija Čop. Another alphabet, [...] "dajnčica", was developed by Peter Dajnko in 1824, which did not catch on as much as metelčica; it was banned in 1838. The reason for their being banned is because they mixed Latin and Cyrillic characters, which was seen as a <b>bad</b> <b>way</b> to handle missing characters.|$|E

His playable involvement in the game was regarded as a transitional arc, being used to introduce the gameplay to players that are new to the franchise. Fahey also considered it a good introduction, as it lets the player become familiar with the basic elements in a manner that [...] "isn't a <b>bad</b> <b>way</b> at all of setting the scene for the game". However, Reiner emphasizes his role as a [...] "troubled boy", calling his story arc [...] "an amazing chain of events", particularly noting that the revelation of his nature as a Nobody creates a [...] "devilish yet remarkable plot twist" [...] which may impact the player in a way that he [...] "may not want Sora back". The introduction of Xion in trailers for Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days, created expectation, particularly based on the facts that her face could not be distinguished and that she wields a keyblade.

[...] She noted that Michael is the only suspect who has previously been involved with Kat, and that it was an emotional affair, rather than just a fling, so with Alfie being distant and Janine pushing Michael away, White said [...] "we don't reckon it would take much for these two to start seeing each other again." [...] She said that Michael has the means, unlike some of the others, as he got Janine to tear up their prenuptial agreement before they married, and the flat that Kat's lover obtained could be listed on the books of Janine's property management business, Butcher's Joints. However, White went on to say, [...] "something tells us Kat would find it very difficult to live with herself if she was sleeping with a man whose baby is in a <b>bad</b> <b>way.</b> It seems too cruel for a mother who went though the agony of thinking she'd lost her child, so we're not sure at could cause another mum that degree of heartache. Then again, that other woman is Kat's loathed enemy, Janine." [...] Shepherd said that Kat and Michael had [...] "nice chemistry" [...] and opined that Michael [...] "would have been very keen" [...] on a relationship with Kat, that [...] "the opportunity for Michael and Kat to team up has always been there, from the moment he arrived" [...] and that the writers are placed [...] "lots of little hints to insinuate that it could be Michael".
