40|$|In certain {{two-dimensional}} time-dependent flows, the <b>braiding</b> <b>of</b> periodic orbits {{provides a}} way to analyze chaos in the system through application of the Thurston-Nielsen classification theorem (TNCT). We expand upon earlier work that introduced {{the application of the}} TNCT to <b>braiding</b> <b>of</b> almost-cyclic sets, which are individual components of almost-invariant sets [Stremler, Ross, Grover, Kumar, Topological chaos and periodic <b>braiding</b> <b>of</b> almost-cyclic sets. Physical Review Letters 106 (2011), 114101]. In this context, almost-cyclic sets are periodic regions in the flow with high local residence time that act as stirrers or `ghost rods' around which the surrounding fluid appears to be stretched and folded. In the present work, we discuss the bifurcation of the almost-cyclic sets as a system parameter is varied, which results in a sequence <b>of</b> topologically distinct <b>braids.</b> We show that, for Stokes' flow in a lid-driven cavity, these various braids give good lower bounds on the topological entropy over the respective parameter regimes in which they exist. We make the case that a topological analysis based on spatiotemporal <b>braiding</b> <b>of</b> almost-cyclic sets can be used for analyzing chaos in fluid flows. Hence we further develop a connection between set-oriented statistical methods and topological methods, which promises to be an important analysis tool in the study of complex systems.

40|$|We {{develop the}} {{complete}} theory for non-Abelian <b>braiding</b> <b>of</b> Majorana Kramers' pairs (MKPs) in time-reversal (TR) invariant topological superconductors. By introducing an effective Hamiltonian approach {{to describe the}} <b>braiding</b> <b>of</b> MKPs, we show that the non-Abelian braiding is protected when the effective Hamiltonian exhibits a new TR like anti-unitary symmetry, which is satisfied if the system is free of dynamical noise. Importantly, even the dynamical noise may not cause error in braiding, unless the noise correlation function breaks a dynamical TR symmetry, which generalizes the TR symmetry protection of MKPs to dynamical regime. Moreover, the resulted error by noise is {{shown to be a}} higher order effect, compared with the decoherence of Majorana qubits without TR symmetry protection. These results show that the non-Abelian <b>braiding</b> <b>of</b> MKPs is observable and may have versatile applications to future quantum computation technologies.

40|$|A {{surprising}} {{image of}} the stock market arises if the price time series of all Dow Jones Industrial Average stock components are represented in one chart at once. The chart evolves into a <b>braid</b> representation <b>of</b> the stock market by taking into account only the crossing of stocks and fixing a convention defining overcrossings and undercrossings. The <b>braid</b> <b>of</b> stocks prices has a remarkable connection with the topological quantum computer. Using pairs of quasi-particles, called non-abelian anyons, having their trajectories braided in time, topological quantum computer can effectively simulate the stock market behavior encoded in the <b>braiding</b> <b>of</b> stocks. In a typically topological quantum computation process the trajectories of non-abelian anyons are manipulated according to the <b>braiding</b> <b>of</b> stocks and the outcome reflects the probability of the future state of stock market. The probability depends only on the Jones polynomial of the knot formed by plat closing the quantum computation. The Jones polynomial of the knotted stock market acts, making a parallel with the common financial literature, in a topological quantum computation as a counterpart of a classical technical indicator in trading the stock market. The type of knot stock market formed is an indicator of its future tendencies. Comment: 24 pages, 12 figure...|$|R
