5|$|Phallus hadriani is a {{saprobic}} species, {{and thus}} obtains nutrients by decomposing organic matter. In North America, {{it is commonly}} associated with tree stumps, or roots of stumps that are decomposing in the ground. In Great Britain, its distribution {{is more or less}} restricted to coastal dunes, while in Poland, it has been noted to avoid humid and humic forest soils, and live in symbiosis with xerophilous grasses and the <b>black</b> <b>locust</b> tree, Robinia pseudoacacia. The mushroom is one of three species protected by the Red Data Book of Latvia.|$|E
5|$|Although Calvatia craniiformis is {{generally}} considered a saprobic species, in controlled laboratory conditions, an ectomycorrhizae between the fungus and American sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua) was reported in a 1966 publication. A Chinese study showed that C.craniifromis would readily form mycorrhiza with poplar seedlings on unsterilized, but not on sterilized soil. Later research was unable to establish any similar association between C.craniiformis and Pinus ponderosa. Brain puffballs grow singly or in groups in fields and open woods, hardwood forests, and wet areas. In Asia, it has been recorded from China, India, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, and South Korea. The brain puffball has been recorded from Australia. In North America, its range includes the eastern and southern United States, and Mexico. In Michigan, {{it is one of}} the few macrofungi found regularly in <b>black</b> <b>locust</b> plantations. Fruit bodies serve as a food source for several species of flies.|$|E

25|$|In ring-porous species, such as ash, <b>black</b> <b>locust,</b> catalpa, chestnut, elm, hickory, mulberry, and oak, {{the larger}} vessels or pores (as cross {{sections}} of vessels are called) are localized {{in the part}} of the growth ring formed in spring, thus forming a region of more or less open and porous tissue. The rest of the ring, produced in summer, is made up of smaller vessels and a much greater proportion of wood fibers. These fibers are the elements which give strength and toughness to wood, while the vessels are a source of weakness.|$|E
25|$|The term {{heartwood}} derives {{solely from}} its position {{and not from}} any vital importance to the tree. This {{is evidenced by the}} fact that a tree can thrive with its heart completely decayed. Some species begin to form heartwood very early in life, so having only a thin layer of live sapwood, while in others the change comes slowly. Thin sapwood is characteristic of such species as chestnut, <b>black</b> <b>locust,</b> mulberry, osage-orange, and sassafras, while in maple, ash, hickory, hackberry, beech, and pine, thick sapwood is the rule. Others never form heartwood.|$|E

Higher altitude villages grow barley, peas, and vegetables, and have one species of willow (called Drokchang in Ladakhi).

Cultivated trees in lower villages include apricots, apples, mulberries, walnuts, balsam poplars, Afghan poplars, oleaster (Elaeagnus angustifolia), and several species of willow (difficult to identify, and local names vary). Elms and white poplars are found in the Nubra Valley, and one legendary specimen of white poplar grows in Alchi in the Indus Valley. <b>Black</b> <b>locust</b> (Robinia pseudoacacia), Himalayan cypress and horse chestnut have been introduced since the 1990s.|$|E
25|$|Nature Trek {{opened on}} July 1, 2017, in the {{southeast}} portion of the park near Wild Asia. It consists of twelve covered rope bridges connecting small porches {{on the sides of}} towers. There are also elevated tunnels and a large overlook, as well as several small challenges resembling American Ninja Warrior obstacles. On the ground is a play area with a sandbox, water sprinklers and structures, and branches. Nature Trek is partially wheelchair-accessible and contains ramps of varying difficulties. This attraction discourages visitors who are wearing certain types of footwear such as flip-flops; high-heels are prohibited. As part of a push for environmental sustainability, sone parts of Nature Trek are made of <b>black</b> <b>locust,</b> and the structures use existing trees within the forest.|$|E
25|$|As with coppicing, only {{species with}} {{vigorous}} epicormic growth {{may be made}} into pollards. In these species (which include many broadleaved trees but few conifers), removal of the main apical stems releases the growth of many dormant buds under the bark on {{the lower part of}} the tree. Trees without this growth will, of course, die without their leaves and branches. Some smaller tree species do not readily form pollards, because cutting the main stem stimulates growth from the base, effectively forming a coppice stool instead. Examples of trees that do well as pollards include broadleaves such as beeches (Fagus), oaks (Quercus), maples (Acer), <b>black</b> <b>locust</b> or false acacia (Robinia pseudoacacia), hornbeams (Carpinus), lindens and limes (Tilia), planes (Platanus), horse chestnuts (Aesculus), mulberries (Morus), redbud (Cercis canadensis), tree of heaven (Ailanthus altissima), willows (Salix), and a few conifers, such as yews (Taxus).|$|E

In soil sampled from deciduous tree and shrub nurseries, similar species composition of parasitic nematodes was found in stands of oaks (Quercus spp. - Fagaceae), <b>black</b> <b>locusts</b> (Robiniapseudo-acacia - Fabaceae) and maples (Acer spp. - Sapindaceae). In soils, especially the light and medium, from stands of coniferous and deciduous trees and shrubs, Aphelenchus avenae was often isolated. Bitylenchus dubius occurred in both types of nurseries, particularly in light soils. The largest faunistic similarities between nematodes isolated from places of growth of coniferous and deciduous plants were recorded in soils of loamy sand and sandy loam. The most abundant nematode species and the greatest similarity in species of plant parasitic nematodes were observed in soils with neutral pH or slightly acidic. Aphelenchus avenae was found in soil samples collected from both coniferous and deciduous plants, with no relation to soil acidity...|$|R

Moses had originally wanted to use sand for the new land, but thought that waste from the New York City Department of Sanitation would be cheaper to use, so the material of choise was switched to landfill. Work on placing the fill began in early 1935, but officials opposed the use of garbage to fill in the land. The landfill was placed among Rodman's Neck, Twin Island, and Hunter Island.

Two seawalls were built: one made of boulders on the east side of the fill facing Pelham Bay, and a smaller wall on the west side facing LeRoy's Bay, now a lagoon. The fill was then landscaped with flowers, shrubs, and various genera of trees, while the naturally planted chestnut, oak, hickory, <b>black</b> <b>locust,</b> and black cherry trees on either side of the fill were kept as is.|$|E
40|$|The neuropeptide [His(7) ]-corazonin induces <b>black</b> {{colouration}} in <b>locusts,</b> {{a feature}} typically occurring in gregarious animals. To date, {{the function of}} this neuropeptide in relation to phase transition has not been fully clarified. Unanswered questions on its involvement in behavioural and morphometrical phaseshifting and possible temperature-induced regulation still remain. In the African locust, Locusta migratoria migratorioides (Reiche and Fairmaire) (Orthoptera: Acrididae), the gregarious form possesses mainly a brown colouration with typical intense black pigmentation. To find a possible behavioural function, an albino L. migratoria mutant, deficient in [His(7) ]-corazonin and thus lacking the typical gregarious colour, was used. Between these two phenotypes, nonphase specific behavioural differences in a phase-dependent behavioural set-up were found. Additionally, a wild-type of the Okinawa strain was screened behaviourally and located {{in comparison to the}} other groups. Treatment of albinos with corazonin induced normal phenotype behaviour.
