The concept of parallelism remains, however, as well as the ability to measure the ratio of distances between collinear points. Giving a rigorous axiomatic introduction to affine geometry would be out of place here. Instead, we will remain quite informal, and just recall the basic facts about real affine spaces that are necessary to understand the rest of this chapter. The reader familiar with notions such as barycentric combinations, affine coordinate systems, and affine transformations may safely proceed to the next section. 1. 1. 1 Affine Spaces and <b>Barycentric</b> <b>Combination...</b>|$|E
40|$|A multi-color {{dithering}} {{algorithm is}} proposed, which converts a <b>barycentric</b> <b>combination</b> of color intensities into a multi-color nonoverlapping surface coverage. Multi-color dithering is a generalization of standard bi-level dithering. Combined with tetrahedral color separation, multi-color dithering {{makes it possible}} to print images made of a set of non-standard inks. In contrast to most previous color halftoning methods, multi-color dithering ensures by construction that the different selected basic colors are printed side by side. Multi-color dithering is applied to generate color images whose screen dots are made of artistic shapes (letters, symbols, ornaments, etc.). Two dither matrix postprocessing techniques are developed, one for enhancing the visibility of screen motives and one for the local equilibration of large dither matrices. The dither matrix equilibration process corrects disturbing local intensity variations by taking dot gain and the human visual system transfer funct [...] ...|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} constructing a suitable discrete-state approximation of an arbitrary non-linear dynamical system with continuous state space and discrete control actions that would allow close to optimal sequential control of that system by means of value or policy iteration on the approximated model. We propose a method for approximating the continuous dynamics {{by means of an}} embedded Markov decision process (MDP) model defined over an arbitrary set of discrete states sampled from the original continuous state space. The mathematical similarity between sets of <b>barycentric</b> coordinates (convex <b>combination)</b> and probability mass functions is exploited to compute the transition matrices and initial state distribution of the MDP. Barycentric coordinates are computed efficiently on a Delaunay triangulation of the set of discrete states, ensuring maximal accuracy of the approximation and the resulting control policy...|$|R
