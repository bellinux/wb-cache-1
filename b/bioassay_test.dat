40|$|ABSTRACT The aim of {{the present}} study was to examine the {{resistance}} of PermaNet® 2. 0 bed nets against repeated washing and environmental factors by using <b>bioassay</b> <b>tests.</b> After 5, 15 and 21 washings with detergents and by using <b>bioassay</b> <b>tests,</b> the resistance of 40 PermaNet® 2. 0 bed nets was compared with that of 40 bed nets conventionally treated with one K-O tablet. To examine the long-term resistance, 31 PermaNet® 2. 0 bed nets were also distributed among villagers, and were re-collected to perform <b>bioassay</b> <b>tests</b> after 1, 2 and 5 years. In the first phase of this study, the insecticidal effect of the conventionally-treated nets significantly decreased due to repeated washings (P < 0. 001); however, it was not significant regarding PermaNet® 2. 0 bed nets (P = 0. 92 in continuous exposure and P = 0. 12 in mortality tests). In the long-term phase of this study, the time required for knockdown of PermaNet® 2. 0 increased over the first 2 years and then decreased. In addition, the mortality rate decreased over the first 2 years and then increased. In conclusion, it seems that the technique used by the manufacturer for impregnation of PermaNet® 2. 0 bed nets has an acceptable efficiency in comparison with conventional techniques...|$|R
