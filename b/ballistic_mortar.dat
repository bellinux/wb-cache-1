40|$|The {{following}} paper researches into {{application of}} digital technology for explosives performance test, especially <b>ballistic</b> <b>mortar</b> test. The proposed approach provides a direct measurement of maximum throw angle of pendulum in <b>ballistic</b> <b>mortar</b> test. The measurement equipment for <b>ballistic</b> <b>mortar</b> (MEBM) is designed, produced, and {{applied in the}} defense industries in Vietnam. MEBM is developed and produced based on angle encoder, CPU S 7 200, TD 200. With the new proposed approach, the measurement process, signal transfer, digital signal processing, data computing, and display are fully automatic. It overcomes the disadvantages of old approach, such as indirect measurement of throw angle, where measurement error depending on marker record, rule, and subjectivity of measurer. The testing and triggering detonator is integrated in MEBM. Griffith Sciences, Griffith School of EngineeringFull Tex...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{the authors}} examine {{the use of}} the <b>ballistic</b> <b>mortar</b> as a means of {{measuring}} performance parameters of Ammonium Nitrate (AN) /fuel explosives. By the introduction of a steel confining sleeve into the firing chamber of the <b>ballistic</b> <b>mortar,</b> {{it was found that the}} degree of similarity of explosive decomposition in the mortar and the borehole was enhanced. In this modified form, the mortar provided accurate relative values of bubble energy rather than maximum available energy (i. e. strength). The significance of bubble energy in rock breakage processes is discussed. The firing of selected charge weights of AN/fuel compositions at constant diameter in the standard mortar, provided an indication of the lengths of detonation regimes which were then used as a criterion of sensitivity. The effects of various parameters on both the bubble energies and sensitivitiesf of AN/fuel compositions are discussed...|$|E
50|$|Prior to the Iraq War, American 120 mm mortar platoons reorganized {{from six}} M1064 mortar {{carriers}} and two M577 fire direction centers (FDC) to four M1064 and one FDC. The urban environment of Iraq {{made it difficult}} to utilize mortars. New technologies such as <b>mortar</b> <b>ballistic</b> computers and communication equipment and are being integrated. Modern era combat is becoming more reliant on direct fire support from mortar carrier machine guns.|$|R

They also conducted military to military training in Hurso and provided a security mission in the capital Addis Ababa.|$|R
50|$|In U.S. Army doctrine, mortar {{carriers}} are to provide close and immediate indirect fire support for maneuver units while allowing for rapid displacement and quick {{reaction to the}} tactical situation. The ability to relocate not only allows fire support to be provided where it is needed faster but also allows these units to avoid counter-battery fire.Prior to the Iraq War, American 120mm mortar platoons reorganized from six M1064 mortar carriers and two M577 fire direction centers (FDC) to four M1064 and one FDC.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results and lessons learned from trial usage of the Software Engineering Institute's (SEI) Software Process Framework (SPF). The SPF was used to check consistency of the Cleanroom Software Engineering (CSE) process against the SEI Capability Maturity Model (CMM) for Software. The trial usage was done for a STARS (Software Technology for Adaptable, Reliable Systems) supported software development project, Improved <b>Mortar</b> <b>Ballistic</b> Computer (IMBC), at the US Army's Picatinny Arsenal Life Cycle Software Engineering Center (LCSEC). The main conclusions reached are:. The SPF is a valuable tool for checking a software process for consistency against the recommendations made by the SEI CMM.. The SPF {{should be viewed as}} a valuable process definition aid to support refining existing processes and for defining new ones, that both satisfy an organizations process requirements and satisfy CMM Key Process Area (KPA) process assurance criteria..
