5|$|Before the 1900 season, Philadelphia stars Napoleon Lajoie and Ed Delahanty {{held out}} of {{renewing}} their {{contracts with the}} team. Other {{members of the team}} had grown disgruntled. Amid talk of a revival of the American Association, Flick and several other players <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> not returning to the team the next year. The Philadelphia Inquirer reported that Flick's father was in the chair business in Cleveland and that he might require Flick's help with the business. Flick agreed to a contract extension before the season started.|$|E
5|$|Roger Stevens {{was working}} for the BBC as a film editor in the 1980s, and one morning, as he was {{travelling}} to work by train, he bumped into a BBC co-worker and they <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> Doctor Who episodes. The BBC projectionist mentioned that he had nine episodes of Doctor Who that Stevens could buy for £25. In the summer of 1981, Stevens bought The Space Museum episode one, The Abominable Snowmen episode two, The Moonbase episode four, Invasion of the Dinosaurs episode one, and three episodes of Carnival of Monsters. Stevens then contacted Ian Levine {{to find out what was}} missing from the BBC archive; Levine confirmed that The Abominable Snowmen episode two and Invasion of the Dinosaurs episode one were currently missing.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{entering}} the Domain the crowd swelled to about 1,000 {{people and a}} series of speakers <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> various topics including civil rights, revolution and militarism. The demonstration angered a number of ex-servicemen and several minor scuffles had ensued. Afterwards a large group of soldiers (some of whom were in uniform) broke up a meeting of socialists at North Quay that evening before moving off towards the Russian Hall in Merivale Street, South Brisbane. The Russian Hall was the base of the Russian Workers Association and as the ex-servicemen approached, the occupants fired a number of shots from the building before the police arrived, dispersing the crowd.|$|E

25|$|As chance {{would have}} it, in July 1940 Hodgkin had been {{introduced}} to A.W. Whitaker of Nash and Thompson, best known for their work on powered gun turrets. They <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> the scanning problem, and Hodgkin described their current solution of moving the dipole {{at the center of}} the parabola up and down while moving the parabola itself right and left. Hodgkin was not convinced this was a good solution and was proven correct when Whitaker built their first version of such a system in November. They found that the two motions combined to cause enormous vibrations in the entire system. Lovell and Hodgkin considered the problem and came up with the idea of causing the parabolic reflector to rotate around the axis extending from the nose of the aircraft, tracing out circles. By smoothly increasing the angle of the reflector compared to the forward axis while the circular motion continued, the net effect was a spiral scanning pattern. Whitaker was able to rapidly build such a system, scanning out a cone-shaped area 45degrees on either side of the nose.|$|E
500|$|Hindley {{claimed that}} Brady <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> [...] "committing the perfect murder" [...] in July 1963, and often {{spoke to her}} about Meyer Levin's Compulsion, {{published}} as a novel in 1956 and adapted for the cinema in 1959. The story tells a fictionalised account of the Leopold and Loeb case, two young men from well-to-do families who attempt to commit the perfect murder of a 12-year-old boy, and escape the death penalty because of their age.|$|E
500|$|Following the {{convention}}, disgruntled Democrats <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> rejecting their party's nominee {{and holding}} another nominating convention. Brown became {{the leader of}} this group, styled the [...] "Honest Election League". Plans for the new convention were made at a meeting held August2, 1899, in Lexington, Kentucky. The nomination was made official at a convention held in that city on August 16. In addition to Brown, the Honest Election League nominated a full slate of candidates for the other state offices.|$|E

500|$|In the 1970s, Gittings {{continued}} her search for resources in libraries that addressed homosexuality in a positive, supportive way. In discussing her {{pursuit of the}} improvement of materials for gays and lesbians in libraries, she said, [...] "For years I would haunt libraries and secondhand book shops trying to find stories to read about my people, and then I became active in other arenas of the gay rights movement, but I always {{kept an eye on}} the emerging literature...It <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> homosexuals who were healthy and happy and wholesome and who had good lives...That rang the bells for me—libraries, gay books!" ...|$|E
500|$|By mid-1843 Dickens {{began to}} suffer from {{financial}} problems. Sales of Martin Chuzzlewit were slowing, and his wife, Catherine, was pregnant with the couple's fifth child. Matters worsened when Chapman & Hall, Martin Chuzzlewits publishers, <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> reducing his monthly income by £50 if sales dropped further. He began to write A Christmas Carol in October 1843. Michael Slater, Dickens's biographer, describes the book as being [...] "written at white heat"; it was completed in six weeks, with the final pages written in early December. He built {{much of the work}} in his head while taking night-time walks of 15 to 20 miles around London. Slater says that A Christmas Carol was ...|$|E
500|$|Mystical speculations {{about the}} {{precession}} of the equinoxes and the Sun's {{proximity to the}} center of the Milky Way appeared in Hamlet's Mill (1969) by Giorgio de Santillana and Hertha von Deschend. These were quoted and expanded upon by Terence and Dennis McKenna in The Invisible Landscape (1975). The significance of a future [...] "galactic alignment" [...] was noted in 1991 by astrologer Raymond Mardyks, who asserted that the winter solstice would align with the galactic plane in 1998/1999. He wrote that this event [...] "only occurs once each 26,000-year cycle and would be most definitely of utmost significance to the top flight ancient astrologers." [...] Astrologer Bruce Scofield noted, [...] "The Milky Way crossing of the winter solstice is something that has been neglected by Western astrologers, with a few exceptions. Charles Jayne made a very early reference to it, and in the 1970s Rob Hand mentioned it in his talks on precession but didn't elaborate on it. Ray Mardyks later made a point of it, and after that John [...] Jenkins, myself, and Daniel Giamario <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> it." ...|$|E

2500|$|The [...] "Month against Homophobia" [...] was a {{campaign}} by Belarusian LGBT activists from 17 April to 17 May 2009 in Minsk, Grodno and Luninets. It consisted of informational campaigns and events. The month {{was organized by}} Gayby.org, Gay.by, members of the League of Sexual Equality [...] "Lambda", and Amnesty International (Belarus). More than fifty media outlets reported about the month's events. Belarusian media <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> gay and lesbian people.|$|E
2500|$|At this time, Thérèse {{was often}} sick; {{she began to}} suffer from nervous tremors. The tremors started one night after her uncle took her for a walk and <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> Zélie. Assuming that she was cold, the family covered Therese with blankets, but the tremors continued; she clenched her teeth and could not speak. [...] The family called Dr. Notta, who could make no diagnosis. In 1882, Dr. Gayral {{diagnosed}} that Thérèse [...] "reacts to an emotional frustration with a neurotic attack".|$|E
2500|$|The {{neologism}} mansplaining {{showed up}} simultaneously in multiple places, so its origin {{is difficult to}} establish. In an essay titled Men Explain Things to Me, Solnit told an anecdote about a man at a party {{who said he had}} heard she had written some books. She <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> her most recent book at the time, on Eadweard Muybridge, whereupon the man cut her off and asked if she had [...] "heard about the very important Muybridge book that came out this year" [...] – not considering that it might be (as, in fact, it was) Solnit's book.|$|E

2500|$|Although {{they were}} supportive, {{his family was}} devastated by the news. Zamora decided to redouble his efforts to {{graduate}} from high school before he died, graduating in 1990. Five months later, he suffered a severe case of shingles that covered the entire right side of his body and face. With medication, the condition subsided, but the experience inspired Zamora to join a Miami-based HIV/AIDS resource center called Body Positive. [...] There he met others with HIV and AIDS, and educated himself about the disease, and on how to lead a positive life with it. Soon thereafter, he <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> his condition to others to attempt to raise awareness about the disease in his community.|$|E
2500|$|Afro-Cuban {{music was}} the conduit by which African American music was [...] "re-Africanized," [...] through the {{adoption}} of two-celled figures like clave and Afro-Cuban instruments like the conga drum, bongos, maracas and claves. According to John Storm Roberts, R became the vehicle {{for the return of}} Cuban elements into mass popular music. Ahmet Ertegun, producer for Atlantic Records, is reported to have said that [...] "Afro-Cuban rhythms added color and excitement to the basic drive of [...] R" [...] As Ned Sublette points out though: [...] "By the 1960s, with Cuba the object of a United States embargo that still remains in effect today, the island nation had been forgotten as a source of music. By the time people <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> rock and roll as having a history, Cuban music had vanished from North American consciousness." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{retirement}} {{he became}} active amongst ex-POWs seeking compensation for wartime imprisonment and <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> these experiences. [...] In 2001 he described these {{in an interview}} with the Imperial War Museum in London, where he stated that he had obtained cigarettes for Ernst and also gave the name of Ernst's sister Susanne. He also stated that he had exchanged uniforms with a bunkmate of Ernst and entered Birkenau in the company of Ernst. Avey got details about events inside Birkenau which he sent home to his mother and sister in code. His mother sent two letters regarding this to the War Office but never received a reply. He was interviewed on BBC Radio Derby in 2003. In 2005 the Daily Mirror reported that Avey claimed to have swapped uniforms with Ernst and entered Birkenau where he witnessed prisoners being sent to the gas chambers.|$|E

2500|$|During 1943, the RNPG {{gradually}} {{changed from}} providing false papers to information-gathering for France libre. Pierre de Bénouville said, [...] "Mitterrand created a true spy {{network in the}} POW camps which gave us information, often decisive, {{about what was going}} on behind the German borders." [...] On 10 July Mitterrand and Piatzook (a militant communist) interrupted a public meeting in the Salle Wagram in Paris. The meeting was about allowing French POWs to go home if they were replaced by young French men forced to go and work in Germany (in French this was called [...] "la relève"). When André Masson <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> [...] "la trahison des gaullistes" [...] (the Gaullist treason), Mitterrand stood up in the audience and shouted him down, saying Masson had no right to talk on behalf of POWs and calling la relève a [...] "con" [...] (i.e., something stupid). Mitterrand avoided arrest as Piatzook covered his escape.|$|E
2500|$|The motives behind Whitney's {{acceptance}} of a contract to manufacture muskets in 1798 were mostly monetary. By the late 1790s, Whitney {{was on the verge}} of bankruptcy and the cotton gin litigation had left him deeply in debt. His New Haven cotton gin factory had burned to the ground, and litigation sapped his remaining resources. The French Revolution had ignited new conflicts between Great Britain, France, and the United States. The new American government, realizing the need to prepare for war, began to rearm. The War Department issued contracts for the manufacture of 10,000 muskets. Whitney, who had never made a gun in his life, obtained a contract in January 1798 to deliver 10,000 to 15,000 muskets in 1800. He had not mentioned interchangeable parts at that time. [...] Ten months later, the Treasury Secretary, Oliver Wolcott, Jr., sent him a [...] "foreign pamphlet on arms manufacturing techniques," [...] possibly one of Honoré Blanc's reports, after which Whitney first <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> interchangeability.|$|E
2500|$|Waldock {{was educated}} at Uppingham School and from 1918 was at Hertford College, Oxford. As a cricketer, {{he was a}} left-handed middle-order batsman and a slow left-arm {{orthodox}} spin bowler. With county cricket resuming after the First World War in a fairly ad hoc manner in the 1919 season, Oxford University's first-class fixtures that year were largely against scratch teams of amateur cricketers, and Waldock was a regular player for the university side throughout. In the match against the MCC at Oxford, he made 85, and this would remain the highest score of his first-class career. The game just before the 1919 University Match was against a side raised by H. D. G. Leveson Gower at Eastbourne; Waldock took seven first-innings wickets for 46 runs and then scored 80 of a first-wicket partnership of 166 with Miles Howell. Waldock was awarded his cricket blue and was also elected secretary for the 1920 Oxford season; in its notes on the 1919 Oxford season, Wisden Cricketers' Almanack said that [...] "Waldock did so well... that people <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> him as the coming left-hand bat".|$|E
