5|$|Defense {{accounts}} contradicted {{the testimony}} of Behan, Claiborne and Allen, who all said that a man had fired a nickel-plated pistol first. Claiborne and Allen both said it was Holliday. Virgil, Wyatt and other witnesses testified that Holliday was carrying a shotgun. (Morgan remained bedridden throughout the trial and did not testify.) The prosecution's scenario would have required Holliday to fire with his pistol first, switch to the shotgun to shoot Tom McLaury, then switch <b>back</b> <b>again</b> <b>to</b> his pistol to continue firing.|$|E
5|$|Five {{weeks after}} Suharto's birth, his mother {{suffered}} {{a nervous breakdown}} and he {{was placed in the}} care of his paternal great-aunt, Kromodirjo. Kertosudiro and Sukirah divorced early in Suharto's life and both later remarried. At the age of three, Suharto was returned to his mother, who had married a local farmer whom Suharto helped in the rice paddies. In 1929, Suharto's father took him to live with his sister, who was married to an agricultural supervisor, Prawirowihardjo, in the town of Wuryantoro in a poor and low-yielding farming area near Wonogiri. Over the following two years, he was taken back to his mother in Kemusuk by his stepfather and then <b>back</b> <b>again</b> <b>to</b> Wuryantoro by his father.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{originally}} {{set to be}} released in early 2009 for Microsoft Windows, and later for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. The team partnered with Edge of Reality to develop the console versions of the game. However, its release date was pushed to the latter half of that year {{in order to have a}} simultaneous launch. BioWare announced that the game would be released on October 20, 2009, but pushed it <b>back</b> <b>again</b> <b>to</b> November 6, 2009, as the team wanted additional time to finalize some last-minute decisions. The PlayStation 3 version was at one point delayed to November 17, but did end up launching alongside the other versions. A Mac version of the game, developed by TransGaming, was released on December 21, 2009.|$|E

5|$|Fox Mulder's (David Duchovny) mind flashes back {{to being}} in the attic with his sister Samantha while their parents are arguing downstairs. Back in the present, Mulder awakens {{in a hotel room}} in Providence, Rhode Island, covered in blood. Mulder calls Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson), who arrives, finding him in shock. Mulder has a {{pounding}} headache and has no memory of what he has done in the past two days. Scully finds that two bullets have been fired from Mulder's gun and that he has keys belonging to a David and Amy Cassandra. Scully wants Mulder to check into a hospital, but he wants to find out if he was involved in a crime before doing so. The agents arrive at the Cassandra's house where the housekeeper tells them they are not at home. Mulder recognizes a house in many of Cassandra's paintings: a house that is near his parent's summer home in Rhode Island. When they arrive there, Mulder has striking pains in his head and flashes <b>back</b> <b>again</b> <b>to</b> when he was a child, seeing a younger version of The Smoking Man (Chris Owens) in his home. The agents enter the home, where they find the Cassandras dead from gunshot wounds.|$|E

25|$|In Italy, {{this was}} a time of great {{interest}} in aviation. In 1925, Francesco de Pinedo flew a seaplane from Italy to Australia to Japan and <b>back</b> <b>again</b> <b>to</b> Italy.

25|$|The AGC {{memory cycle}} {{occurred}} continuously during AGC operation. Instructions needing memory data had to access it during timing pulses 7-10.

25|$|In March 1944 Ladd {{took another}} {{physical}} and was re-classified 1A. He {{would have to}} be re-inducted into the army, but a deferment was given to enable Ladd to make Two Years Before the Mast (the release of which was postponed two years). He was meant to be re-inducted on 4 September 1944 but Paramount succeeded in getting this pushed <b>back</b> <b>again</b> <b>to</b> make Salty O'Rourke. He also found time to make a cameo a big screen version of Duffy's Tavern.|$|E
25|$|Uqba b. Al-Hajjaj's forces {{remained}} in French territory {{for about four}} years, carrying raids to Lyons, Burgundy, and Piedmont. Charles Martel invaded Septimania in two campaigns in 736 and 739, but was forced <b>back</b> <b>again</b> <b>to</b> Frankish territory under his control. Alessandro Santosuosso strongly argues that the second (Umayyad) expedition was probably more dangerous than the first. The second expedition's failure {{put an end to}} any serious Muslim expedition across the Pyrenees, although raids continued. Plans for further large-scale attempts were hindered by internal turmoil in the Umayyad lands which often made enemies out of their own kind.|$|E

On 11 April 2016, Jayasuriya was appointed <b>back</b> <b>again</b> <b>to</b> {{the post of}} chairman of selectors. This time, under his selection, many players got test, ODI and T20I caps and the team shuffled so many times due to many injuries to major players. During this period, Sri Lanka lost world No. 1 rankings in T20Is, lost many bilateral tours to New Zealand, England, India, Pakistan, South Africa. Despite them, Sri Lanka lost their first bilateral ODI series to Zimbabwe at home, Bangladesh drawn all formats in Sri Lanka, Sri Lanka quit very early from both 2016 World Twenty20, and 2017 ICC Champions Trophy.|$|E
25|$|HTC-Highroad's squad for the Tour de France was {{centered}} around Cavendish, <b>back</b> <b>again</b> <b>to</b> {{try to win}} the points classification green jersey after finishing second in those standings {{each of the past}} two years. Eisel, Renshaw, Bak, and Pate were named as leadout men, with Goss also present to perhaps try for the sprints that may be too difficult for Cavendish. Peter Velits and Tony Martin were named as possible general classification hopefuls, though Martin's true strength was the individual time trial, to be raced on the identical course to the one he won on earlier in the season at the Critérium du Dauphiné. Tour de France debutant van Garderen rounded out the squad.|$|E
25|$|Gillard and Akers left in February 1982 {{and were}} {{replaced}} by Jill Yates on keyboards and a returning Sinclair. April saw the release of Reverie, a four-track EP on Resonant Records. Around this time, due to the small population/market in Perth, the band started the long journey driving from Perth to Sydney, then Melbourne (and <b>back</b> <b>again)</b> <b>to</b> play shows, do some recording and to live for large periods of time, often in quite squalid conditions. By mid-year Sinclair had left again, and Martyn P. Casey joined the band on bass guitar in September 1982. For $150 a night, The Triffids' services as a support act were procured by The Reels, The Sunnyboys, The Church, Hunters & Collectors or Uncanny X-Men.|$|E

25|$|Estimated {{completion}} schedules slipped over time. When {{the bond}} issue {{to fund the}} construction was passed in 2005, the MTA said that the project would be done in 2012. This quick completion date {{was a part of}} the city's unsuccessful 2012 Summer Olympics bid; the Olympics were hosted in London instead. When construction began in 2007, the MTA stated that the new train line would open by the end of 2013. Later in 2007, the MTA gave a completion date of 2014. In its 2008 capital improvement budget proposal, the MTA pushed back completion of Phase 1 to 2015, and in 2009, the MTA pushed it <b>back</b> <b>again</b> <b>to</b> 2016. Some publications had predicted a December 2016 opening. Others reported that the subway would not open until 2017.|$|E
25|$|The {{first decade}} of the 20th century saw other {{developments}} at Earl's Court station. On 30 June 1900 The Middle Circle service was withdrawn east of Earl's Court which became the terminus of the service until 31 January 1905 when the service was cut <b>back</b> <b>again</b> <b>to</b> terminate at Addison Road. On 15 December 1906, the Great Northern, Piccadilly and Brompton Railway (GNP, now the Piccadilly line) opened between Hammersmith and Finsbury Park serving Earl's Court from platforms in deep tube tunnels constructed beneath the surface station. Unlike at Gloucester Road and South Kensington, other stations served by both the District and Piccadilly lines, a new building to house the lifts to the deep level platforms was not required. Instead space was provided within the existing station shed, near Earls Court Road, and the lifts descended directly to platform level without the need for intermediate stairs below ground.|$|E

Continuing southwest, the path reached the current site of Altoona and left the Little Juniata, heading south {{to what is now}} Hollidaysburg. There it followed the Beaverdam Branch Juniata River to the Frankstown Branch Juniata River at the modern village of Frankstown and {{the southern end of the}} path. Several paths met at the Native American village of Frankstown, including a Warriors Path that led south to Maryland, Virginia, and on to the Catawba and Cherokee peoples in North and South Carolina. The Kittanning Path was one of a few that led west from Frankstown to the Allegheny and Ohio Rivers.|$|E
