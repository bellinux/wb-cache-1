Dick, the {{response}} from critics was highly negative. Manhola Dargis wrote, [...] "Ms. Moore seems terribly unhappy to <b>be</b> <b>here,</b> <b>and</b> it's no wonder." [...] The actress has since described it as her worst film. Next was followed by Savage Grace (2007), the true story of Barbara Daly Baekeland—a high-society mother whose Oedipal relationship with her son ended in murder. Moore was fascinated by the role. Savage Grace had a limited release, and received predominantly negative reviews. Peter Bradshaw, however, called it a [...] "coldly brilliant and tremendously acted movie." ...|$|E

During an interview, Lee revealed that the music video for the song {{was one of the}} band's [...] "realest" [...] videos adding, [...] " [...] this is more a personal video. We've done a lot in the past that [...] very 'fantasy,' and this is sort of the real us. I just wanted to do something that really felt personal for a change. Obviously, I'm wearing crazy makeup, and that's not my everyday, but, you know, I want ... to connect with the fans again. We all do. We miss them. A lot of this record is about them, and that's why they're going to <b>be</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> be in it, too."

[...] Wurzelbacher answered, [...] "Oh no, no, no one's contacted me as far as if I was going to be on the debate or as far as my name being used. No. I have been contacted by them and asked to show up at a rally. But, other than that, no. I just happened to <b>be</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> Barack Obama happened to show up." ...|$|E

2500|$|His {{reputation}} grew {{with several}} exhibitions in Germany and Switzerland in 1920. He was provided with many subjects to paint {{as he came}} to know the farmers of the area, who were amazed by Kirchner's gramophone. Kirchner writes {{of the people of}} Davos: [...] "The people who live here are proud. The hard work, which is done with great love, the way they treat animals (you very seldom see an animal being mishandled) entitle them to be proud. In most cases, work here has reached the ideal standard of being done with love. You can see it in the movements of their hands. And that, in turn, ennobles the facial expression and imbues all personal contacts with a great delicacy. This is a country in which democracy has become reality. Here a man’s word still counts, and you need have no fears about sleeping with your doors open. I am so happy to be allowed to <b>be</b> <b>here,</b> <b>and</b> through hard work I should like to thank the people for the kindness they have shown me". Kirchner began writing critiques of his own art under the pseudonym of Louis de Marsalle in order to control public opinion of him and free himself of dependence upon the art critics of the day.|$|E
2500|$|Meanwhile, Republican Senator Orrin Hatch, {{along with}} Democratic Senators Patrick Leahy (D-VT) and Arlen Specter (R-PA), [...] {{had been working}} with John Ashcroft on a draft bill, called the Anti-Terrorism Act of 2001. On September 19, 2001 this first draft is {{introduced}} to Congress. Many {{of the most controversial}} aspects of the USA PATRIOT Act were first part of this draft and it was later to be introduced as the PATRIOT Act/USA Act [...] which in turn became the basis for the final USA PATRIOT Act. Among other things, the administration proposal discussed extending roving wiretaps from the sole domain of domestic agencies into the domain of foreign intelligence surveillance and proposed the expansion of the use of wiretaps from phonelines to Internet technology. It would have made it possible for more law enforcement agencies to disseminate wiretap information and would have expanded the scope of surveillance subpoenas to allow broader access to personal records [...] including [...] "books, records, papers, documents, and other items." [...] Both the bill introduced by Senator Graham and the proposed Anti-Terrorism Act draft were referred to the Select Committee on Intelligence. According to The Washington Post, EPIC's Jim Dempsey {{and a number of other}} representatives from other civil liberties groups were invited to discussions about the draft, but Dempsey's recollection was that [...] "They [...] were livid, [...] explicitly said, 'We don't think outsiders should <b>be</b> <b>here,</b> <b>and</b> we won't talk unless they leave the room.'" [...] Though a deal was brokered, this began causing tensions between parties negotiating the bill and previously amicable discussions started breaking down between Leahy and Ashcroft.|$|E
