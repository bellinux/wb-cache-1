5|$|Domestic cats, {{especially}} young kittens, {{are known for}} their love of play. This behavior mimics hunting and is important in helping kittens learn to stalk, capture, and kill prey. Cats also engage in play fighting, {{with each other and with}} humans. This <b>behavior</b> <b>may</b> be a way for cats to practice the skills needed for real combat, and might also reduce any fear they associate with launching attacks on other animals.|$|E
5|$|Z.sexpunctatus males exhibit ritualized agonistic {{behavior}} when encountering other {{males of}} the same species. This <b>behavior</b> <b>may</b> include many {{of the same}} elements as courtship, such as raising and spreading the first pair of legs and vibrating the abdomen. During agonistic display, males will also extend their pedipalps and fangs. Lethal attacks between males appear to be rare, however.|$|E
5|$|Female {{homosexual}} <b>behavior</b> <b>may</b> {{be present}} in every culture, although {{the concept of a}} lesbian as a woman who pairs exclusively with other women is not. Attitudes about female homosexual behavior are dependent upon women's roles in each society, and each culture's definition of sex. Women in the Middle East have been historically segregated from men. In the 7th and 8th centuries, some extraordinary women dressed in male attire when gender roles were less strict, but the sexual roles that accompanied European women were not associated with Islamic women. The Caliphal court in Baghdad featured women who dressed as men, including false facial hair, but they competed with other women for the attentions of men.|$|E

5|$|The Javan rhino is {{much less}} vocal than the Sumatran; very few Javan rhino vocalizations have ever been recorded. Adults have no known predators other than humans. The species, {{particularly}} in Vietnam, is skittish and retreats into dense forests whenever humans are near. Though a valuable trait from a survival standpoint, it has made the rhinos difficult to study. Nevertheless, when humans approach too closely, the Javan rhino becomes aggressive and will attack, stabbing with the incisors of its lower jaw while thrusting upward with its head. Its comparatively antisocial <b>behavior</b> <b>may</b> be a recent adaptation to population stresses; historical evidence suggests they, like other rhinos, were once more gregarious.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the advent}} of {{anatomical}} physical modernity cannot confidently be linked with palaeoneurological change, it does seem probable that hominid brains evolved through the same selection processes as other body parts. Genes that promoted a capacity for symbolism may have been selected for, suggesting that the foundations for symbolic culture may well be grounded in biology. However, behavior that was mediated by symbolism may have only come later, even though this physical capacity was already in place much earlier. Skoyles and Sagan, for example, argue that human brain expansion by increasing the prefrontal cortex would have created a brain capable of symbolizing its previously non-symbolic cognition, and that this process, slow to begin with, increasingly accelerated during the last 100,000 years. Symbolically mediated <b>behavior</b> <b>may</b> then feed back upon this process by creating a greater ability to manufacture symbolic artifacts and social networks. According to the research team in Jebel Irhoud, the discovery means that Homo sapiens — not members of a rival or ancestor species (Homo heidelbergensis, Homo naledi) — {{were the ones who}} left behind Middle Stone Age hand tools that have since been unearthed all over Africa.|$|E
5|$|In {{the absence}} of officially {{recognized}} diagnostic criteria, and beyond the ambit of the discourse on a broader set of criteria discussed above, the term attachment disorder has been increasingly used by some clinicians {{to refer to a}} broader set of children whose <b>behavior</b> <b>may</b> be affected by lack of a primary attachment figure, a seriously unhealthy attachment relationship with a primary caregiver, or a disrupted attachment relationship. Although there are no studies examining diagnostic accuracy, concern is expressed as to the potential for over-diagnosis based on broad checklists and 'snapshots'. This form of therapy, including diagnosis and accompanying parenting techniques, is scientifically unvalidated and is not considered to be part of mainstream psychology or, despite its name, to be based on attachment theory, with which it is considered incompatible. It has been described as potentially abusive and a pseudoscientific intervention, that has resulted in tragic outcomes for children.|$|E

5000|$|Children {{who have}} {{been the victim of}} child sexual abuse {{sometimes}} display overly sexualized <b>behavior,</b> which <b>may</b> be defined as expressed behavior that is non-normative for the culture.

Sexualized behavior is thought to constitute the best indication that a child has been sexually abused.|$|R

30|$|The {{present study}} {{also shows that}} {{aggression}} and bullying go beyond individual differences and attributes, being influenced by the social contexts in which they take place. More than assuming a straightforward group effect on individual <b>behavior,</b> these <b>behaviors</b> <b>may</b> become functional depending on the value and acceptance that groups ascribe to them. Several {{studies have shown that}} individual behavior is explained in part by group norms regarding these behaviors (Duffy & Nesdale, 2009; Potocnjak et al. 2011). The present study expands these findings by showing that group influence on these <b>behaviors</b> <b>may</b> be a reinforcing factor via its association with social status, but also by the value that groups ascribe to aggression and bullying by means of their beliefs.|$|R
40|$|Diseases and {{pathogens}} {{are receiving}} increasing recognition {{as sources of}} mortality in animal populations. Immune system strength is clearly important in fending off pathogen attack. Physical barriers to pathogen entry are also important. Various individual behaviors are efficacious in reducing contact with diseases and pests. This paper focuses on a fourth mode of defense: social barriers to transmission. Various social behaviors have pathogen transmission consequences. Selective pressures on these social <b>behaviors</b> <b>may</b> therefore exist. Effects on pathogen transmission of mating strategies, social avoidance, group size, group isolation, and other behaviors are explored. It is concluded {{that many of these}} <b>behaviors</b> <b>may</b> have been affected by selection pressures to reduce transmission of pathogens. 84 refs., 1 tab...|$|R

25|$|Impulsive {{behavior}} is common, including substance or alcohol abuse, eating disorders, unprotected sex or indiscriminate sex with multiple partners, reckless spending, and reckless driving. Impulsive <b>behavior</b> <b>may</b> also include leaving jobs or relationships, running away, and self-injury. People with BPD act impulsively {{because it gives}} them the feeling of immediate relief from their emotional pain. However, in the long term, people with BPD suffer increased pain from the shame and guilt that follow such actions. A cycle often begins in which people with BPD feel emotional pain, engage in impulsive behavior to relieve that pain, feel shame and guilt over their actions, feel emotional pain from the shame and guilt, and then experience stronger urges to engage in impulsive behavior to relieve the new pain. As time goes on, impulsive <b>behavior</b> <b>may</b> become an automatic response to emotional pain.|$|E
