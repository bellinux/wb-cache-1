5000|$|Charmeuse (...) is a {{lightweight}} fabric woven with a satin weave, {{in which the}} warp threads cross over four {{or more of the}} <b>backing</b> (<b>weft)</b> threads. These float threads give the front of the fabric a smooth finish—lustrous and reflective—whereas the back has a dull finish. It can be made of silk or a synthetic lookalike such as polyester. Silk charmeuse is more expensive and delicate but is softer and a better insulator. [...] Polyester charmeuse is cheaper and can often withstand machine washing, but it does not breathe as well as silk. Charmeuse differs from plain satin in that charmeuse has a different ratio of float (face) threads.|$|E

40|$|Numerous studies {{around the}} world {{emphasize}} the unconditional impact of compression therapy as prevention of varicose veins, of trophic ulcers healing and other problems. Therefore, {{the development of new}} knitted materials for prevention and rehabilitation of anatomical forms and functions of the human body is an important issue as for medicians as for textile researchers. The purpose of this research work is to study the structure parameters and the properties of compression hosiery for compliance with the standard requirements and for providing the necessary therapeutic effect. The compression stockings for women have been produced on circular knitting machine «Lonati» (Italy) with a special supply for elastomeric yarn. The single <b>backed</b> <b>weft</b> knitting have been chosen for stocking manufacturing. Researches of structures parameters and deformation characteristics of stretch fabric, as well as an influence of wet-heat treatments on the properties of compression hosiery have been carried out. The investigation of structure parameters and physical and mechanical properties of compression hosiery is establishing their conformity to the standard...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} aims {{to innovate}} a new fabric structure, {{which could be}} used as a bed cover based on double honeycomb fabric with self-stitching. The honeycomb air pockets were aimed at facing each other to form closed small air chambers which work to sequester the air. The double fabric increases fabric thickness. Thus, the opportunity to improve thermal comfort could be achieved. A number of samples were produced with different densities and counts of weft yarn. Thermal insulation and water vapour permeability were measured and compared with bed covers produced from reversible <b>weft</b> <b>backed</b> structure. Geometrical properties, abrasion resistance, and air permeability were also measured. The results showed that the innovated structure had higher values of thermal insulation than reversible <b>weft</b> <b>backed</b> structure at certain weft counts and densities...|$|R
5000|$|Selvedge denim {{refers to}} a unique type of {{selvedge}} that is made by passing one continuous cross-yarn (the <b>weft)</b> <b>back</b> and forth through the vertical warp beams. This is traditionally finished at both edges with a contrasting warp (most commonly red); that is why this type of denim is {{sometimes referred to as}} [...] "red selvedge." [...] This method of weaving the selvage is possible only when using a shuttle loom.|$|R
50|$|Tapestry {{is a form}} of textile art, {{traditionally}} woven on {{a vertical}} loom. Tapestry is weft-faced weaving, in which all the warp threads are hidden in the completed work, unlike cloth weaving where both the warp and the weft threads may be visible. In tapestry weaving, weft yarns are typically discontinuous; the artisan interlaces each coloured <b>weft</b> <b>back</b> and forth in its own small pattern area. It is a plain weft-faced weave having weft threads of different colours worked over portions of the warp to form the design.|$|R
5000|$|Lace wigs {{are quickly}} {{becoming}} one of the most sought after wigs among wig wearers. The illusion of hair growing from the scalp is the feature that makes this wig {{the best of the best}} when it comes to wearing fake hair. These wigs are made with a French or Swiss lace material base. They are made as a full lace or partial lace front with a stretch <b>weft</b> <b>back.</b> Each hair strand is individually stitched into a lace material which creates the natural look of hair at the base. This is where the term [...] "hand tied" [...] originates.|$|R
5000|$|In {{industry}} the selvage may be {{thicker than}} the rest of the fabric, and is where the main weft threads are reinforced with a tight <b>weft</b> <b>back</b> binding to prevent fraying. More simply, they [...] "finish" [...] the left and right-hand edges of fabric as it exits the loom, especially for the ubiquitous [...] "criss-cross" [...] simple or tabby weave, referred to in industry as taffeta weave. Selvages on machine-woven fabric often have little holes along their length, through the thick part, and can also have some fringe. The type or motion of selvage depends on the weaving technique or loom used. A water- or air-jet loom creates a fringed selvage that is the same weight as the rest of the cloth, as by the weft thread is drawn via a jet nozzle, which sends the weft threads through the shed with a pulse of water. The selvage is then created by a heat cutter which trims the thread at both ends close to the edge of the cloth, and then it is beaten into place. Thus it creates a firm selvage with the same thickness as the rest of the cloth.|$|R
