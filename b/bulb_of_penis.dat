Three healthy men participated in this study, which included ultrasound imaging of the mid-urethra, urethra-vesical junction, ano-rectal junction and <b>bulb</b> <b>of</b> the <b>penis.</b> Fine-wire electromyography electrodes were inserted into the puborectalis and bulbocavernosus muscles and a transurethral catheter electrode recorded striated urethral sphincter electromyography. A nasogastric sensor recorded intra-abdominal pressure. Tasks included submaximal and maximal voluntary contractions, and Valsalva. The relationship between each of the parameters measured from ultrasound images and electromyography or intra-abdominal pressure amplitudes was described with nonlinear regression. Strong, non-linear relationships were calculated for each predicted landmark/muscle pair for submaximal contractions (R 2 - 0. 87 - 0. 95). The relationships between mid-urethral displacement and striated urethral sphincter electromyography, and <b>bulb</b> <b>of</b> the <b>penis</b> displacement and bulbocavernosus electromyography were strong during maximal contractions (R 2 - 0. 74 - 0. 88). Increased intra-abdominal pressure prevented shortening of puborectalis, which resulted in weak relationships between electromyography and anorectal and urethravesical junction displacement during all tasks. Displacement of landmarks in transperineal ultrasound imaging provides meaningful measures of activation of individual pelvic floor muscles in men during voluntary contractions. This method may aid assessment of muscle function or feedback for training...|$|R
50|$|An {{injury to}} the urethra leaving Buck's fascia intact results in a {{collection}} of urine (extravasation) limited to the penis, deep to Buck's fascia. However, if the {{injury to the}} <b>bulb</b> <b>of</b> the <b>penis</b> results in urethral injury accompanying a tear of the Buck's fascia, then extravasated blood and urine would accumulate in the superficial perineal space, passing into the penis (outer to Buck's fascia) as well as the scrotum and lower anterior abdominal wall. Extravasation of urine involving a compromised Buck's fascia can be appreciated clinically by blood collecting in the superficial pouch, resulting in a 'butterfly'-shaped region around the penis.|$|R

50|$|The digital rectal {{examination}} (DRE; palpatio per anum, PPA) is {{a relatively}} simple procedure. The patient undresses, then is placed {{in a position where}} the anus is accessible (lying on the side, squatting on the examination table, bent over the examination table, or lying down with feet in stirrups).During this procedure, areas which can be palpated are: the <b>bulb</b> <b>of</b> the <b>penis,</b> the urogenital diaphragm, the anorectal ring, and other nearby anatomical landmarks. However, structures like the ureter (the two tubes that run from each kidney to the urinary bladder), and the urethra (which, in a male, is divided into three parts, and is inside the penis) cannot be palpated.|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: The {{prostate}} volume delineated on MRI {{is smaller}} than on CT. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine the influence of MRI- vs. CT-based prostate delineation using multiple observers on the dose to the target and organs at risk during external beam radiotherapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: CT and MRI scans of the pelvic region were made of 18 patients and matched three-dimensionally on the bony anatomy. Three observers delineated the prostate using both modalities. A fourth observer delineated the rectal wall and the <b>bulb</b> <b>of</b> the <b>penis.</b> The planning treatment volume (PTV) was generated from the delineated prostates with a margin of 10 mm in three-dimensions. A three-field treatment plan with a prescribed dose of 78 Gy to the International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements point was automatically generated from each PTV. Dose-volume histograms were calculated of all PTVs, rectal walls, and penile bulbs. The equivalent uniform dose was calculated for the rectal wall using a volume exponent (n = 0. 12). RESULTS: The equivalent uniform dose of the CT rectal wall in plans based on the CT-delineated prostate was, on average, 5. 1 Gy (SEM 0. 5) greater than in the plans based on the MRI-delineated prostate. For the MRI rectal wall, this difference was 3. 6 Gy (SEM 0. 4). Allowing for the same equivalent uniform dose to the CT rectal wall, the prescribed dose to the PTV could be raised from 78 to 85 Gy when using the MRI-delineated prostate for treatment planning. The mean dose to the <b>bulb</b> <b>of</b> the <b>penis</b> was 11. 6 Gy (SEM 1. 8) lower for plans based on the MRI-delineated prostate. The mean coverage (volume of the PTV receiving > or = 95 % of the prescribed dose) was 99. 9 % for both modalities. The interobserver coverage (coverage of the PTV by a treatment plan designed for the PTV delineated by another observer in the same modality) was 97 % for both modalities. The MRI rectum was significantly more ventrally localized than the CT rectum, probably because of the rounded tabletop and no knee support on the MRI scanner. CONCLUSIONS: The dose delivered to the rectal wall and <b>bulb</b> <b>of</b> the <b>penis</b> is significantly reduced with treatment plans based on the MRI-delineated prostate compared with the CT-delineated prostate, allowing a dose escalation of 2. 0 - 7. 0 Gy for the same rectal wall dose. The interobserver coverage was the same for CT and MRI delineation of the prostate. A statistically significant difference in position between the CT- and MRI-delineated rectum was observed, probably owing to a different tabletop and use of knee suppor...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} {{the impact of}} different tabletops {{with or without a}} knee support on the position of the rectum, prostate, and <b>bulb</b> <b>of</b> the penis; and to {{evaluate the}} effect of these patient-positioning devices on treatment planning. METHODS AND MATERIALS: For 10 male volunteers, five MRI scans were made in four different positions: on a flat tabletop with knee support, on a flat tabletop without knee support, on a rounded tabletop with knee support, and on a rounded tabletop without knee support. The fifth scan was in the same position as the first. With image registration, the position differences of the rectum, prostate, and <b>bulb</b> <b>of</b> the <b>penis</b> were measured at several points in a sagittal plane through the central axis of the prostate. A planning target volume was generated from the delineated prostates with a margin of 10 mm in three dimensions. A three-field treatment plan with a prescribed dose of 78 Gy to the International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements point was automatically generated from each planning target volume. Dose-volume histograms were calculated for all rectal walls. RESULTS: The shape of the tabletop did not affect the rectum and prostate position. Addition of a knee support shifted the anterior and posterior rectal walls dorsally. For the anterior rectal wall, the maximum dorsal shift was 9. 9 mm (standard error of the mean [SEM] 1. 7 mm) {{at the top of the}} prostate. For the posterior rectal wall, the maximum dorsal shift was 10. 2 mm (SEM 1. 5 mm) at the middle of the prostate. Therefore, the rectal filling was pushed caudally when a knee support was added. The knee support caused a rotation of the prostate around the left-right axis at the apex (i. e., a dorsal rotation) by 5. 6 degrees (SEM 0. 8 degrees) and shifts in the caudal and dorsal directions of 2. 6 mm (SEM 0. 4 cm) and 1. 4 mm (SEM 0. 6 mm), respectively. The position <b>of</b> the <b>bulb</b> <b>of</b> the <b>penis</b> was not influenced by the use of a knee support or rounded tabletop. The volume of the rectal wall receiving the same dose range (e. g., 40 - 75 Gy) was reduced by 3. 5 % (SEM 0. 9 %) when a knee support was added. No significant differences were observed between the first and fifth scan (flat tabletop with knee support) for all measured points, thereby excluding time trends. CONCLUSIONS: The rectum and prostate were significantly shifted dorsally by the use of a knee support. The rectum shifted more than the prostate, resulting in a dose benefit compared with irradiation without knee support. The shape of the tabletop did not influence the rectum or prostate positio...|$|R

40|$|Conceptually TME has its {{basis in}} embryology. The {{original}} hypothesis was that cancer spread will tend, initially at least, to remain within the embryologic lymphovascular hindgut "envelope" the mesorectum and mesocolon. The corollary to the perfect specimen and cure {{is the perfect}} preservation of the layers surrounding the mesorectum which, are formed by the autonomic nerves and plexuses. The first obstacle is that few realistic photographs, sketches or diagrams have been published and visualisation and lighting low down in the pelvis is always problematic. Even when they are understood and visualised the difficulties inherent in preserving these nerves are {{due to the fact}} that they are actually adherent to the mesorectum at certain points where the dissection becomes particularly challenging. The most important and most adherent areas are the so-called "lateral ligaments" - low down laterally and anterolaterally where the inferior hypogastric plexuses (virtually the pelvic sex-brain) tether the whole mesorectal package. When the specimen has been carefully released it lifts up in a somewhat spectacular fashion - hence the old idea that there are ligaments at these points. A lesser degree of adherence may be found at various other points and particular care is required anteriorly where the nerves are converging towards the <b>bulb</b> <b>of</b> the <b>penis</b> with a trapezoidal septum between them - Denonvillier’s "fascia"- which is in turn adherent to the anterior mesorectum and lower down in the prostate...|$|R
