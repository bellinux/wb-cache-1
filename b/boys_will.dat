These subjects are normally delivered by subject specialists. In addition, all <b>boys</b> <b>will</b> have Physical Education and Swimming lessons alongside two double Games lessons.

25|$|The first {{uniform of}} the corps was a grey tunic with green facings, and a peaked cap with cock's feathers; in 1863 this was changed for a green uniform with red facings, similar to that worn by the 60th Rifles, with the {{exception}} of a broad red stripe on the trousers. The trouser stripe was done away with in 1875, when also the cap and feathers gave place to the busby and glengarry, the latter in 1884 being exchanged for the regulation army helmet, and soon perhaps our <b>boys</b> <b>will</b> all be seen in scarlet like their brothers of the Staffordshire battalions. The annual balls did not become popular, the last taking place in 1864; bazaars were held 14–17 October 1863, and 24–27 October 1876; athletic displays had been given (the first in May 1865).|$|E

500|$|While the {{revisions}} to the play Blackrock were still being finalised, Enright started working with first-time director Steven Vidler to direct a film version, which would also be titled Blackrock. By December 1995, Vidler was working with Enright as an unofficial script editor, although they were having trouble finding financing for the film. Vidler said he considered directing the film Blackrock after having watched and been moved by the theatrical version, saying the play was [...] "absolutely {{what it was like}} [...] growing up in the Western Suburbs... It's about keeping bonded with your mates. Nothing else matters... It's about the unbelievable lengths <b>boys</b> <b>will</b> go to keep those bonds solid." [...] Leigh's mother Robyn campaigned to have production of the film halted, but her attempts failed after the film received government financial backing from the New South Wales Film and Television Office.|$|E
500|$|Davies' {{next project}} after Cucumber and Banana will be The Boys, a Channel 4 series about the HIV/AIDS crisis during the 1980s. The <b>Boys</b> <b>will</b> be a dramatised {{retrospective}} {{of the crisis}} which focuses on the men [...] "living in the bedsits" [...] during the 1980s as opposed to films such as Pride which focus on gay activists; Davies notes that the stories regarding {{the politics of the}} crisis and the virus itself has been told, but not those regarding the early victims of the virus itself. Davies describes The Boys as a way of [...] "coming to terms" [...] with his own actions during the 1980s, when the shock of the crisis prevented him from properly mourning the deaths of his close friends. After The Boys, Davies plans to write a series about sextortion that draws inspiration from real-life incidents of blackmail that resulted in suicide.|$|E

He concluded that he was unable to stop playing the song after he heard it. Bill Lamb of About.com said the song was [...] "brilliant". He continued, [...] "The song is sweet, funny, bratty, and edgy all at the same time. Taylor Swift remains one of our most gifted young lyricists." [...] Jonathan Keefe of Slant Magazine thought that [...] "Speak Now" [...] exemplified Swift's inability to [...] "write authoritatively about anything other than how great boys are or how much boys suck or how dreams about <b>boys</b> <b>will</b> take her somewhere better than where she is now." ...|$|E
