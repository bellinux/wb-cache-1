5|$|In the italic, the {{expansive}} ascenders of Tagliente's type were shortened and the curl {{to the right}} replaced with more conventional serifs. Monotype also cut italic capitals sloped to match the lower-case, whereas in the Renaissance italics were used with upright capital letters in the Roman inscriptional tradition. The bold (Monotype's invention, since Griffo and his contemporaries did not use <b>bold</b> <b>type)</b> is extremely solid, providing a very clear contrast to the regular styles, and Monotype also added lining (upper-case height) figures {{as well as the}} text figures (at lower-case height) used in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries.|$|E
5|$|Monotype later {{created a}} bold and bold italic (called a {{semi-bold}} in some digitisations) {{to match the}} roman and italic of the original release. (True <b>bold</b> <b>type</b> {{did not exist in}} Kis's time.) Released in 1967, Fleet Titling was a capitals-only alphabet intended to serve as a companion for titling use. It was created by Monotype's occasional collaborator John Peters, a Cambridge University Press designer who also worked as a private printer. Monotype used it for their logo and letterhead. More oddly, Monotype in the 1960s used Ehrhardt as a base for printing in the Initial Teaching Alphabet. This alphabet system, intended to be used to teach children to read, used alternative characters for different sounds spelled with the same letter, like t's and c's dropped below the baseline of the text.|$|E

50|$|With {{the arrival}} of printing, other typographic effects such as italic <b>type,</b> <b>bolded</b> <b>type,</b> or {{different}} sizes of type, were used to emphasize a section of text, and as printing in two colours is more expensive and time consuming, rubrication has tended to be reserved for sacred and liturgical books or luxury editions of other works.|$|R

However, extensions exist for adopting the conjoinment nodes described in Section 3.2 and for linking to the resource- and data-definition sections of eSML that are both based on respective pattern collections [56, 57]. The life-cycle definitions [25] are for the business processes and contained tasks.|$|R

25|$|Utah's laws {{in regard}} to alcohol, tobacco and {{gambling}} are strict. Utah is an alcoholic beverage control state. The Utah Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control regulates the sale of alcohol; wine and spirituous liquors may only be purchased at state liquor stores, and local laws may prohibit the sale of beer and other alcoholic beverages on Sundays. The state bans the sale of fruity alcoholic drinks at grocery stores and convenience stores. The law states that such drinks must now have new state-approved labels {{on the front of}} the products that contain capitalized letters in <b>bold</b> <b>type</b> telling consumers the drinks contain alcohol and at what percentage. The Utah Indoor Clean Air Act is a statewide smoking ban, that prohibits smoking in many public places.

500|$|The Green Book's motto, {{displayed}} on the front cover, urged black travelers to [...] "Carry your Green Book with you – You may need it". The 1949 edition included a quote from Mark Twain: [...] "Travel is fatal to prejudice", inverting Twain's original meaning; as Cotton Seiler puts it, [...] "here it was the visited, rather than the visitors, who would find themselves enriched by the encounter." [...] Green commented in 1940 that the Green Book had given black Americans [...] "something authentic to travel by and to make traveling better for the Negro." [...] Its principal goal was to provide accurate information on black-friendly accommodations to answer the constant question that faced black drivers: [...] "Where will you spend the night?" [...] As well as essential information on lodgings, service stations and garages, it provided details of leisure facilities open to African Americans, including beauty salons, restaurants, nightclubs and country clubs. The listings focused on four main categories– hotels, motels, tourist homes (private residences, usually owned by African Americans, which provided accommodation to travelers), and restaurants. They were arranged by state and subdivided by city, giving {{the name and address}} of each business. For an extra payment, businesses could have their listing displayed in <b>bold</b> <b>type</b> or have a star next to it to denote that they were [...] "recommended".|$|E
40|$|Traditionally kabuli chickpeas (Cicer arietinum) {{were not}} grown in Maharashtra state of India because the then {{available}} genotypes were late in maturity and susceptible to fusarium wilt (Kumar et al. 1985). Earliness and wilt resistance have been introgressed from desi types through systematic breeding efforts. The first ever early-maturing kabuli genotype ICCV 2 was released for cultivation in Andhra Pradesh state of India in 1989 and in Maharashtra in 1992 (Kumar et al. 2001) and notified by the Central Variety Release Committee (CVRC) of Government of India in 1992. Thereafter it became popular in Maharashtra and was grown {{in more than}} 50, 000 ha during 1999 / 2000. Better market price for kabuli chickpea {{was one of the}} major considerations for the growers of ICCV 2. However, during the last few years the price of ICCV 2 has been reduced in Indian market due to its relatively smaller seed, while the extra bold kabuli chickpeas are being sold at a much higher price.
