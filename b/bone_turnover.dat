5|$|About {{three-quarters of}} dietary calcium is from dairy {{products}} and grains, the rest being {{accounted for by}} vegetables, protein-rich foods, fruits, sugar, fats, and oil. Calcium supplementation is controversial, as the bioavailability of calcium {{is strongly dependent on}} the solubility of the salt involved: calcium citrate, malate, and lactate are highly bioavailable while the oxalate is much less so. The intestine absorbs about one-third of calcium eaten as the free ion, and plasma calcium level is then regulated by the kidneys. Parathyroid hormone and vitamin D promote the formation of bone by allowing and enhancing the deposition of calcium ions there, allowing rapid <b>bone</b> <b>turnover</b> without affecting bone mass or mineral content. When plasma calcium levels fall, cell surface receptors are activated and the secretion of parathyroid hormone occurs; it then proceeds to stimulate the entry of calcium into the plasma pool by taking it from targeted kidney, gut, and bone cells, with the bone-forming action of parathyroid hormone being antagonised by calcitonin, whose secretion increases with increasing plasma calcium levels.|$|E
5|$|The use of bone {{building}} drugs, like bisphosphonates and anti-RANKL drugs {{require special}} consideration with implants, {{because they have}} been associated with a disorder called Bisphosphonate-associated osteonecrosis of the jaw (BRONJ). The drugs change <b>bone</b> <b>turnover,</b> which is thought to put people at risk for death of bone when having minor oral surgery. At routine doses (for example, those used to treat routine osteoporosis) the effects of the drugs linger for months or years but the risk appears to be very low. Because of this duality, uncertainty exists in the dental community about how to best manage the risk of BRONJ when placing implants. A 2009 position paper by the American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons, discussed that the risk of BRONJ from low dose oral therapy (or slow release injectable) as between 0.01 and 0.06 percent for any procedure done on the jaws (implant, extraction, etc.). The risk is higher with intravenous therapy, procedures on the lower jaw, people with other medical issues, those on steroids, those on more potent bisphosphonates and people who have taken the drug for more than three years. The position paper recommends against placing implants in people who are taking high dose or high frequency intravenous therapy for cancer care. Otherwise, implants can generally be placed and the use of bisphosphonates does not appear to affect implant survival.|$|E

25|$|In large studies, women taking bisphosphonates for {{osteoporosis}} {{have had}} unusual fractures ("bisphosphonate fractures") in the femur (thigh bone) in the shaft (diaphysis or sub-trochanteric region) of the bone, {{rather than at}} the femoral neck, which is the most common site of fracture. However, these unusual fractures are extremely rare (12 in 14,195 women) compared to the common hip fractures (272 in 14,195 women), and the overall reduction in hip fractures caused by bisphosphonate far outweighed the unusual shaft fractures. There are concerns that long-term bisphosphonate use can result in over-suppression of <b>bone</b> <b>turnover.</b> It is hypothesized that micro-cracks in the bone are unable to heal and eventually unite and propagate, resulting in atypical fractures. Such fractures tend to heal poorly and often require some form of bone stimulation, for example bone grafting as a secondary procedure. This complication is not common, and the benefit of overall fracture reduction still holds. In cases where there is concern of such fractures occurring, teriparatide is potentially a good alternative because it does not cause as much damage as a bisphosphonate does by suppressing <b>bone</b> <b>turnover.</b>|$|E

25|$|The {{concept of}} chronic kidney disease-mineral bone {{disorder}} (CKD-MBD) currently describes a broader clinical syndrome that develops as a systemic disorder of mineral and bone metabolism due to CKD manifested by either {{one or a}} combination of: 1) abnormalities of calcium, phosphorus (phosphate), parathyroid hormone, or vitamin D metabolism; 2) abnormalities in <b>bone</b> <b>turnover,</b> mineralization, volume, linear growth, or strength (renal osteodystrophy); and 3) vascular or other soft-tissue calcification.

25|$|The {{three main}} {{mechanisms}} by which osteoporosis develops are an inadequate peak bone mass (the skeleton develops insufficient mass and strength during growth), excessive bone resorption, and inadequate formation of new bone during remodeling, likely due to MSC biasing away from the osteoblast and toward the marrow adipocyte lineage. An interplay of these three mechanisms underlies the development of fragile bone tissue. Hormonal factors strongly determine the rate of bone resorption; lack of estrogen (e.g. {{as a result of}} menopause) increases bone resorption, as well as decreasing the deposition of new bone that normally takes place in weight-bearing bones. The amount of estrogen needed to suppress this process is lower than that normally needed to stimulate the uterus and breast gland. The α-form of the estrogen receptor appears {{to be the most important}} in regulating <b>bone</b> <b>turnover.</b> In addition to estrogen, calcium metabolism plays a significant role in <b>bone</b> <b>turnover,</b> and deficiency of calcium and vitamin D leads to impaired bone deposition; in addition, the parathyroid glands react to low calcium levels by secreting parathyroid hormone (parathormone, PTH), which increases bone resorption to ensure sufficient calcium in the blood. The role of calcitonin, a hormone generated by the thyroid that increases bone deposition, is less clear and probably not as significant as that of PTH.|$|E
25|$|The {{activation}} of osteoclasts is regulated by various molecular signals, of which RANKL (receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand) {{is one of}} the best studied. This molecule is produced by osteoblasts and other cells (e.g. lymphocytes), and stimulates RANK (receptor activator of nuclear factor κB). Osteoprotegerin (OPG) binds RANKL before it has an opportunity to bind to RANK, and hence suppresses its ability to increase bone resorption. RANKL, RANK and OPG are closely related to tumor necrosis factor and its receptors. The role of the Wnt signaling pathway is recognized, but less well understood. Local production of eicosanoids and interleukins is thought to participate in the regulation of <b>bone</b> <b>turnover,</b> and excess or reduced production of these mediators may underlie the development of osteoporosis.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{clinical}} {{distinction of}} different types of renal bone disease is not easy and plasma intact parathyroid hormone remains the most widely used noninvasive test to predict bone histology. We studied the bone biopsy histology of 15 chronic hemodialysis patients and evaluated the usefulness of plasma intact parathyroid hormone in predicting the types of renal bone disease. The plasma intact parathyroid hormone of high <b>turnover</b> hyperparathyroid <b>bone</b> disease in hemodialysis patients was 316. 3 ± 162. 8 ng/L and that of non-high-turnover was 144. 1 ± 108. 9 ng/L (p= 0. 034). The plasma intact parathyroid hormone of low <b>turnover</b> <b>bone</b> disease in hemodialysis patients was 127. 0 ± 105. 7 ng/L and that of non-low-turnover was 290. 4 ± 161. 1 ng/L (p= 0. 033). The thresholds of plasma intact parathyroid hormone for distinguishing osteodystrophy and sensitivity, specificity of plasma intact parathyroid hormone were analyzed by using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. The area under receiver operating characteristic of plasma intact parathyroid hormone in diagnosing of hyperparathyroid bone disease and low <b>turnover</b> <b>bone</b> disease was 0. 84 and 0. 82, respectively. The optimal cutoff value of plasma intact parathyroid hormone for diagnosis of hyperparathyroid bone disease was 250 ng/L (sensitivity, 75 %; specificity, 71. 4 %), and that of low <b>turnover</b> <b>bone</b> disease was 100 ng/L (sensitivity, 60 %; specificity, 90 %).

25|$|In a {{systematic}} review {{of cases of}} bisphosphonate-associated ONJ up to 2006, {{it was concluded that}} the mandible is more commonly affected than the maxilla (2:1 ratio), and 60% of cases are preceded by a dental surgical procedure. According to Woo, Hellstein and Kalmar, oversuppression of <b>bone</b> <b>turnover</b> is probably the primary mechanism for the development of this form of ONJ, although there may be contributing co-morbid factors (as discussed elsewhere in this article). It is recommended that all sites of potential jaw infection should be eliminated before bisphosphonate therapy is initiated in these patients to reduce the necessity of subsequent dentoalveolar surgery. The degree of risk for osteonecrosis in patients taking oral bisphosphonates, such as alendronate (Fosamax), for osteoporosis is uncertain and warrants careful monitoring. Patients taking dexamethasone and other glucocorticoids are at increased risk.|$|E
25|$|Trabecular bone (or cancellous bone) is the sponge-like bone in {{the ends}} of long bones and vertebrae. Cortical bone is the hard outer shell of bones and the middle of long bones. Because osteoblasts and osteoclasts inhabit the surface of bones, trabecular bone is more active and is more subject to <b>bone</b> <b>turnover</b> and remodeling. Not only is bone density decreased, but the {{microarchitecture}} of bone is also disrupted. The weaker spicules of trabecular bone break ("microcracks"), and are replaced by weaker bone. Common osteoporotic fracture sites, the wrist, the hip and the spine, have a relatively high trabecular bone to cortical bone ratio. These areas rely on the trabecular bone for strength, so the intense remodeling causes these areas to degenerate most when the remodeling is imbalanced. Around the ages of 30–35, cancellous or trabecular bone loss begins. Women may lose as much as 50%, while men lose about 30%.|$|E
25|$|Since ONJ {{has been}} {{diagnosed}} in many patients {{who did not}} take bisphosphonates, it is thus logical to assume that bisphosphonates {{are not the only}} factor in ONJ. While the oversuppression of <b>bone</b> <b>turnover</b> seems {{to play a major role}} in aggravating the disease process, other factors can and do initiate the pathophysiological mechanisms responsible for ONJ. In non-bisphosphonate cases of ONJ, it is mainly the cancellous portion of the bone and its marrow content that are involved in the disease process. The first stage is an oedema of the bone marrow initiated by a bone infarct, which is itself modulated by numerous causes, leading to myelofibrosis as a result of hypoxia and gradual loss of mineral bone density characteristic of ischaemic osteoporosis. Further deterioration can be triggered by additional bone infarcts leading to anoxia and a localized areas of osteonecrosis within the osteoporotic cancellous bone. Secondary events such as dental infection, injection of local anaesthetics with vasoconstrictors, such as epinephrine, and trauma can add further complications to the disease process and chronic non-pus forming bone infection osteomyelitis can also be associated with ONJ.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: Experimental {{measurements}} of bone mineral density distributions (BMDDs) enable {{a determination of}} secondary mineralisation kinetics in bone, but the maximum degree of mineralisation and how this maximum is approached remain uncertain. We thus test computationally different hypotheses on late stages of bone mineralisation by simulating BMDDs in low turnover conditions. Materials and Methods: An established computational model of the BMDD that accounts for mineralisation and remodelling processes was extended to limit mineralisation to various maximum calcium capacities of bone. Simulated BMDDs obtained by reducing turnover rate from the reference trabecular BMDD under different assumptions on late stage mineralisation kinetics were compared with experimental BMDDs of low-turnover bone. Results: Simulations show that an abrupt stopping of mineralisation near a maximum calcium capacity induces a pile-up of minerals in the BMDD statistics that is not observed experimentally. With a smooth decrease of mineralisation rate, imposing low maximum calcium capacities helps to match peak location and width of simulated low turnover BMDDs with peak location and width of experimental BMDDs, but results in a distinctive asymmetric peak shape. No tuning of turnover rate and maximum calcium capacity was able to explain the differences found in experimental BMDDs between trabecular <b>bone</b> (high <b>turnover)</b> and femoral cortical <b>bone</b> (low <b>turnover).</b> Conclusions: Secondary mineralisation in human bone does not stop abruptly, but continues slowly up to a calcium content greater than 30 wt% Ca.

The model was applied to 39 previously reported Holocene skeletal populations from around the world, and the results were compared with weaning ages observed in ethnographic studies. CONCLUSIONS: There were no significant differences in the age at the end of weaning between the archaeological (2. 80 ± 1. 32 years) and ethnographic populations. By comparing archaeological populations, it appears that weaning ages did not differ with the type of subsistence practiced (i. e., hunting-gathering or not). Most of [Formula: see text]-enrichment (2. 44 ± 0. 90 ‰) was consistent with biologically valid values. The nitrogen isotope ratios of subadults after the weaning process were lower than those of adults in most of the archaeological populations (- 0. 48 ± 0. 61 ‰), and this depletion was greater in non-hunter-gatherer populations.
