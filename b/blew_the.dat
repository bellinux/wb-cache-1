5|$|Forty {{minutes after}} landing, Sigma 7 was hoisted aboard Kearsarge; five minutes later, Schirra <b>blew</b> <b>the</b> {{explosive}} hatch and climbed {{out to a}} waiting crowd. After doing this, examinations showed clear bruising on his hand from operating the heavy ejector switch, which he felt provided an important vindication for fellow pilot Gus Grissom's hatch expulsion accident during the Liberty Bell 7 mission. Grissom had maintained that the hatch blew without his input; {{the fact that he}} had no bruising was seen as evidence that he had not blown the hatch early and sunk his capsule, but that it was a mechanical malfunction.|$|E
5|$|In 1984, the NHC was {{separated}} from the Miami Weather Service Forecast Office, which meant the meteorologist in charge at Miami {{was no longer in}} a position above the hurricane center director.

In 1992, Hurricane Andrew <b>blew</b> <b>the</b> WSR-57 weather radar and the anemometer off the roof of NHC's/the Miami State Weather Forecast offices.

Quickly exiting through the open hatch and into the ocean, Grissom nearly drowned as water began filling his spacesuit.

40|$|Thesis (M. Com. (Accountancy)) [...] University of the Witwatersrand, Faculty of Commerce, Law and Management, School of Accountancy, 2014. This thesis {{presents}} {{empirical evidence}} {{of the factors that}} motivate trainee auditors to <b>blow</b> <b>the</b> whistle on wrongdoing in an audit firm. It investigates whether organisational justice (comprised of procedural, interactional and distributive justice) is positively correlated with <b>the</b> willingness to <b>blow</b> <b>the</b> whistle. It also investigates whether the type of justice (procedural, interactional and distributive justice) affects <b>the</b> decision to <b>blow</b> <b>the</b> whistle. Finally, it investigates whether professional performance, morality-proxied by a sense of religion-, seniority, age and gender affect this decision to <b>blow</b> <b>the</b> whistle. The results indicate that most trainee auditors‟ sense of organisational justice is positively correlated to their likelihood to <b>blow</b> <b>the</b> whistle. All three justice dimensions (procedural, interactional and distributive justice) are found to increase trainee auditors‟ propensity to <b>blow</b> <b>the</b> whistle. High interactional justice is found to be a greater motivation to <b>blow</b> <b>the</b> whistle than procedural and distributive justice. Low distributive justice is found to be least effective as an impediment to whistleblowing, whilst low procedural and interactional justice are more effective than low distributive justice in deterring whistleblowing. This research finds that age, gender, seniority and religion do not affect the trainee auditor‟s propensity to <b>blow</b> <b>the</b> whistle. Most recent performance ratings do not affect trainee auditors‟ decision to <b>blow</b> <b>the</b> whistle, except in the case of trainees who received a low performance rating when there was low interactional justice...|$|R
40|$|This article {{reports the}} {{findings}} from a study that investigates the relationship between ethical climates and police whistle-blowing on five forms of misconduct in the State of Georgia. The results indicate that a friendship or team climate generally explains willingness to <b>blow</b> <b>the</b> whistle, but not the actual frequency of <b>blowing</b> <b>the</b> whistle. Instead, supervisory status, a control variable investigated in previous studies, is the most consistent predictor of both willingness to <b>blow</b> <b>the</b> whistle and frequency of <b>blowing</b> <b>the</b> whistle. Contrary to popular belief, the results also generally indicate that police are more inclined than civilian employees to <b>blow</b> <b>the</b> whistle in Georgia – in other words, they are less inclined to maintain a code of silence.

5|$|Emerald {{was first}} {{commissioned}} in August 1795, under Captain Velters Cornewall Berkeley and in January 1797, she sailed for the Mediterranean. Spain had become allied to France and {{declared war on}} Britain in October 1796. Early in 1797, a Spanish fleet of 27 ships of the line was at Cartagena with orders to join the French fleet at Brest. A storm <b>blew</b> <b>the</b> Spanish fleet off course, enabling Admiral John Jervis' fleet of 15 ships of the line to intercept it off Cape St Vincent on 14 February.

5|$|On , 1896 the leaking Sissoi Veliky reached Algiers. The captain {{planned to}} stay there for at least 20 days to {{complete}} the most urgent repairs, but five days later a telegram from Saint Petersburg forced him to leave for Piraeus. There the crew managed to seal the seams between the armour plates and repair the electrical systems. In February 1897 Sissoi Veliky steamed for Crete and she had her first gunnery exercise ten miles off the shore of Souda Bay, Crete {{at the end of}} the month. The second exercise, held on , ended in disaster when the rear turret exploded after an hour of target practice. The explosion <b>blew</b> <b>the</b> roof of the turret over the mainmast so that it struck the base of the foremast, crushing one 37mm gun and a steam cutter. The explosion killed 16 men and wounded another 15; 6 of these later died of their wounds. The badly damaged Sissoi Veliky headed to Toulon for repairs.|$|E

Shortly thereafter, a lookout spotted a formation of Japanese aircraft approaching using the sun as cover. The Japanese aircraft, using clouds as cover, dove and released three bombs against Colhoun, two splashing nearby and one striking the after searchlight platform and a nearby boat. The bomb <b>blew</b> <b>the</b> after davits down and forward, blocking the after engine room hatches, and starting a fire from the diesel oil spilled by the boat.|$|E

5|$|Round {{the rims}} of deserts, where more {{precipitation}} occurred and conditions were more suitable, some groups took to cultivating crops. This {{may have happened}} when drought caused the death of herd animals, forcing herdsmen to turn to cultivation. With few inputs, {{they were at the}} mercy of the weather and may have lived at bare subsistence level. The land they cultivated reduced the area available to nomadic herders, causing disputes over land. The semi-arid fringes of the desert have fragile soils which are at risk of erosion when exposed, as happened in the American Dust Bowl in the 1930s. The grasses that held the soil in place were ploughed under, and a series of dry years caused crop failures, while enormous dust storms <b>blew</b> <b>the</b> topsoil away. Half a million Americans were forced to leave their land in this catastrophe.|$|E

5|$|The British instigated a new {{offensive}} on 25 September, at Loos, {{to coincide}} with French offensives in the Champagne and Artois regions. The King's were represented in the offensive by eight battalions, from standard infantry to pioneers. Some 150 tons of Chlorine gas was used {{on the first day}} of the battle, discharged via thousands of cylinders. Strong winds <b>blew</b> <b>the</b> gas backwards, hindering the advance of the 1st King's and other units having to also contend with partially uncut barbed wire. The advance of the 1/9th King's also stalled, though they took about 300 Germans prisoner. The battalion later assisted in the repulse of a German counter-attack on 8 October. More battalions arrived before the year ended, including the 17th, 18th, 19th, and 20th Liverpool Pals, which formed the 89th Brigade, 30th Division.|$|E

5|$|The {{first group}} {{was the only}} one to contain four teams: Argentina, Chile, France and Mexico. Two days after France's victory over Mexico, they faced group favourites Argentina. Injuries {{hindered}} France; goalkeeper Alex Thépot had to leave the field after 20minutes, and Laurent, after a fierce tackle by Luis Monti, spent most of the match limping. However, they held out for most of the match, only succumbing to an 81st-minute goal scored from a Monti free kick. The game featured an officiating controversy when referee Almeida Rêgo erroneously <b>blew</b> <b>the</b> final whistle six minutes early, with Frenchman Marcel Langiller clear on goal; play only resumed after protests from the French players. Though France had played twice in 48 hours, Chile had yet to play their first match. They faced Mexico the following day, gaining a comfortable 3–0 win.|$|E
5|$|The game {{remained}} tied through nine innings, forcing extra innings.

Ramón Ortiz relieved Julio and no further runs scored in the inning, but the Padres entered the bottom of the 13th with an 8–6 lead. The Padres brought in Trevor Hoffman to secure the game and a wild-card victory. However, Hoffman <b>blew</b> <b>the</b> save, allowing doubles to Matsui and Tulowitzki and a triple to Holliday which tied the game 8–8. Hoffman then intentionally walked Todd Helton leaving baserunners at first and third base. Carroll then hit a line drive to right fielder Brian Giles. Holliday tagged up at third and slid headfirst on a close play at home plate. Home plate umpire Tim McClelland ruled Holliday safe on the sacrifice fly, and the Rockies won the game 9–8.|$|E
5|$|There was a prehistoric burial site at {{the summit}} of Mount Pelier Hill and stones from it {{were used in the}} {{construction}} of the lodge.

Conolly had the roof replaced with an arched stone roof constructed in a similar fashion to that of a bridge.
