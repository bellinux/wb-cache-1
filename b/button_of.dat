5|$|Cloud, a single-player {{video game}} for Microsoft Windows, {{centers on a}} boy who dreams of flying through the sky while asleep in a {{hospital}} bed. The player assumes control of the sleeping boy's avatar—the projection of the boy into his dream world—and guides him through his dream {{of a small group}} of islands with a light gathering of clouds. The avatar's direction and speed are controlled with a mouse; movement is generally on a horizontal plane, but vertical flight can be attained by holding down the third <b>button</b> <b>of</b> the mouse. The player may interact with clouds only while flying horizontally.|$|E
5|$|The {{caterpillars}} of many butterflies attach {{themselves by}} a <b>button</b> <b>of</b> silk to {{the underside of}} a branch or stone or other projecting surface. They remain attached to the silk pad by a hook-like process called a cremaster. Most chrysalids hang head downward, but in the families Papilionidae, Pieridae, and Lycaenidae, the chrysalis is held in a more upright position by a silk girdle around {{the middle of the}} chrysalis.|$|E
5|$|The {{intention}} for {{the first}} few months of development was for the game to be an on-rails shooter similar to Sega's light gun game Virtua Cop; GoldenEyes gas plant location was modelled by Karl Hilton with a predetermined path in mind. Although GoldenEye is controlled with a pad rather than a light gun, Hollis credited Virtua Cop as an influence on the developers' adoption of features such as gun reloading, position-dependent hit reaction animations, penalties for killing innocent characters, and an alternative aiming system that is activated upon pressing the R <b>button</b> <b>of</b> the Nintendo 64 controller.|$|E

5|$|Dick <b>Button</b> <b>of</b> the United States {{successfully}} {{defended the}} Olympic title he won in St. Moritz for men's singles figure skating, {{in the process}} becoming the first skater to be unanimously ranked first by judges in every round of an Olympic competition. Finland's Lydia Wideman won the first gold medal awarded in women's cross-country skiing, with Mirja Hietamies and Siiri Rantanen completing an all-Finnish podium in the event. Finland won {{three of the four}} golds and eight of the twelve medals on offer in the sport. Hjalmar Andersen was the most successful athlete at the Games, winning three gold medals in speed skating. In two of the three events he won, the 5000m and 10000m, he set new Olympic records and won by the largest margins in those events' Olympic history: 11 seconds in the 5000m and nearly 25 seconds in the 10000m. Mirl Buchner of Germany also won three medals at the Games, with one silver and two bronzes won in alpine skiing. A total of 18 athletes won more than one medal at the Games. However, only four of them won more than one gold medal: Andersen; Andrea Mead Lawrence of the United States; and Lorenz Nieberl and Andreas Ostler of Germany.|$|E
5|$|Hamilton {{clinched}} {{his seventh}} pole {{position of the}} season with a time of 1:36.303. He was joined on the front row of the grid by Räikkönen, who qualified 0.342seconds behind Hamilton's time. Massa took third place, needing a good result to retain the possibility of a Championship victory. Alonso qualified in fourth ahead of Kovalainen, who took fifth after struggling for tyre grip during the final session. Webber was sixth fastest in the final session, but was demoted to 16th on the grid {{as a result of his}} penalty. Heidfeld originally qualified sixth, but was penalised three positions for impeding Red Bull driver David Coulthard in the first session. As a result, Toro Rosso driver Sebastian Vettel inherited sixth position, ahead of Trulli and Bourdais. Piquet took tenth position. Kubica's eleventh placing was his worst qualifying result to that point in the season, struggling with his car's set-up throughout his two sessions. Rubens Barrichello of Honda took 13th behind Timo Glock of Toyota, to reach the top 15 for the first time in ten races. Williams driver Nico Rosberg took 14th on the grid. Coulthard failed to move beyond the first session; the Red Bull driver qualified in 15th and blamed Heidfeld for his poor performance. Kazuki Nakajima of Williams, Jenson <b>Button</b> <b>of</b> Honda and the Force Indias of Adrian Sutil and Giancarlo Fisichella would line up on the back two rows of the grid.|$|E
5|$|Originally, the {{developers}} planned to only upgrade the graphics and tweak the gameplay. However, as development was {{getting closer to}} completion, Capcom started making more substantial changes in the game. For example, the inventory was expanded so that players could carry a standard item like Jill's lock picking, while defense items, which were initially {{not going to be}} separated from the main inventory, were introduced to make the game a bit easier than the original Resident Evil. The developers originally planned to make all enemies invisible but the idea was ultimately discarded because it would have made the remake very different from the original game. However, they designed the zombies so that they could come back to life {{a certain amount of time}} after they are killed. The developers also added new areas for the player to explore, changed most of the puzzle designs, and included a new control scheme called Type C where players move their characters by pressing the R <b>button</b> <b>of</b> the GameCube controller and steer them with the analog stick. Another addition is the subplot involving the character Lisa Trevor, which was cut from the original game. Instead of using adjectives to describe difficulty levels, Mikami deliberately decided to have unique questions so that the player would pick the hard one.|$|E

25|$|From 1826 to 1846, Tuscaloosa {{served as}} Alabama's capital. On January 30, 1846, the Alabama {{legislature}} announced it had voted {{to move the}} capital city from Tuscaloosa to Montgomery. The first legislative session in the new capital met in December 1847. A new capitol building was erected {{under the direction of}} Stephen Decatur <b>Button</b> <b>of</b> Philadelphia. The first structure burned down in 1849, but was rebuilt on the same site in 1851. This second capitol building in Montgomery remains to the present day. It was designed by Barachias Holt of Exeter, Maine.|$|E
25|$|The {{neckband}} of {{the hood}} usually has a loop of which original {{function is to}} hook onto the <b>button</b> <b>of</b> a cassock. Since many do not wear cassocks for graduation, the loop is sometimes hooked onto a shirt button instead. However, since the hood is rather heavy this {{has a tendency to}} pull the lightweight shirt upwards. The correct way to wear the hood is to allow the neckband to naturally hook itself onto the collar under the tie which secures the hood in place. Sometimes, the hood is worn too forward and down being hooked onto the jacket button or pinned which causes the hood to sit poorly and be more likely to slip down the shoulders like a shawl.|$|E

25|$|Waistcoats (called vests in American English) {{were almost}} always worn with suits {{prior to the}} 1940s. Due to {{rationing}} during World War II, their prevalence declined, but their popularity has gone {{in and out of}} fashion from the 1970s onwards. A pocket watch on a chain, one end of which is inserted through a middle buttonhole, is often worn with a waistcoat; otherwise, since World War I when they came to prominence of military necessity, men have worn wristwatches, which may be worn with any suit except the full evening dress (white tie). Although many examples of waistcoats worn with a double-breasted jacket can be found from the 1920s to the 1940s, that would be unusual today (one point of a double-breasted jacket being, it may be supposed, to eliminate the waistcoat). Traditionally, the bottom <b>button</b> <b>of</b> a waistcoat is left undone; like the vents in the rear of a jacket, this helps the body bend when sitting. Some waistcoats can have lapels, others do not.|$|E

Germany resumed its former prominence in bobsleigh, with wins in the four- and two-man events. Dick <b>Button</b> <b>of</b> the United States performed the first triple jump in international competition to claim his second consecutive men's figure skating Olympic title. The 1952 Games featured one demonstration sport, bandy, but only three Nordic countries competed in the tournament. Norway dominated the overall medal count with 16 medals, seven of them gold. The Games closed with the presentation of a flag that would be passed from one Winter Olympics host city to the next. The flag, which became known as the [...] "Oslo flag", has been displayed in the host city during each subsequent Winter Games.|$|E

The PlayStation button replaces the [...] "Analog" [...] <b>button</b> <b>of</b> the DualShock and DualShock 2 controllers.

500|$|Parker {{made several}} changes from the novel. He titled his script Angel Heart {{as he wanted}} to {{distance}} his film adaptation from the source material. While Falling Angel is set entirely in New York City, Parker had {{the second half of}} his script take place in New Orleans, based on the novel's perpetual allusions to voodoo and the occult. He discussed the story setting change to Hjortsberg, who approved of the decision and said that he had considered setting his novel in New Orleans. Angel Heart is set in the year 1955, whereas in the book, the events take place in 1959. Parker explained, [...] "1955 for me still belonged to the 1940s—and, because of the historical pause <b>button</b> <b>of</b> World War II, conceivably the 1930s—so quite simply, setting it in this year allowed me to give an older look to the film." ...|$|E
