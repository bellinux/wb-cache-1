In {{the greater part of}} manufactures, a journeyman may be pretty sure of employment almost every day in the year that he is able to work. A mason or <b>brick-layer,</b> on the contrary, can work neither in hard frost nor in foul weather, and his employment at all other times depends upon the occasional calls of his customers. He is liable, in consequence, to be frequently without any.

You see, everybody knows that if he had had a chance he would have shown the world some generalship that would have made all generalship before look like child's play and 'prentice work. But he never got a chance; he tried heaps of times to enlist as a private, but he had lost both thumbs and a couple of front teeth, and the recruiting sergeant wouldn't pass him. However, as I say, everybody knows, now, what he WOULD have been,--and so they flock by the million to get a glimpse of him whenever they hear he is going to be anywhere.

60|$|Bricklayers often tramp, in twos and threes, lying {{by night}} at their 'lodges,' which are {{scattered}} all over the country. Bricklaying is another of the occupations that can by no means be transacted in rural parts, without the assistance of spectators--of as many as can be convened. In thinly-peopled spots, I have known <b>brick-layers</b> on tramp, coming up with bricklayers at work, to be so sensible of the indispensability of lookers-on, that they themselves have sat up in that capacity, and have been unable to subside into the acceptance of a proffered share in the job, {{for two or three days}} together. Sometimes, the 'navvy,' on tramp, with an extra pair of half-boots over his shoulder, a bag, a bottle, and a can, will take a similar part in a job of excavation, and will look at it without engaging in it, until all his money is gone. The current of my uncommercial pursuits caused me only last summer to want a little body of workmen for a certain spell of work in a pleasant part of the country; and I was at one time honoured with the attendance of as many as seven-and-twenty, who were looking at six.|$|R

When your <b>brick-layers</b> are out of employ, do not build splendid new streets, but better the old ones; send your paviours and slaters to the poorest villages, and see that your poor are healthily lodged, before you try your hand on stately architecture.

40|$|Within Europe, {{harmonisation}} {{of standards}} for aggregates {{has resulted in}} a suite of new and modified aggregate test methods and a reappraisal of specification limits through the work of the European Committee for Standardisation (CEN) Technical Committee (TG) 154. The acceptance in many countries, particularly France and The Netherlands, that fines quality is more significant than fines quantity has led to the drafting of test methods to assess the harmfulness of fines. The methylene blue dye test, a quantitative test method for clay fines, and the Sand Equivalent test for fines content are currently draft European standards and their use is included in the new European Standard for aggregates for mortar being drafted by Sub-committee 1 of Technical Committee 154. Information gathered on fines content and fines quality has led to concerns that our European partners would demand onerous restrictions on harmful fines that would prejudice the use of what may be perfectly satisfactory materials traditionally used by <b>brick-layers</b> in the UK. This thesis describes research work conducted to relate the methylene blue value and fines content of building sand to the performance of mortar and to address criticisms of the methylene blue dye test for harmful fines in aggregates. A review of literature relating to mortar properties and the effects of the aggregate used has been undertaken. Attempts have been made to characterise the fines in natural building sands and relate their properties to the effects they have on mortar. A correlation has been established between clay content and durability performance. A novel test has been developed to measure the shrinkage potential of mortars cast on bricks of varying capillary suction. The clay and fines content of the sand used has been correlated to plastic shrinkage cracking in mortar. The role of air entrainment, substrate action and mortar type has been discussed in relation to durability performance and shrinkage potential. Combinations of materials have been described that give optimum durability performance for a minimum shrinkage potential. A method has been developed that can selectively alter the dye adsorption of clay minerals so that results of dye adsorption tests on clays are in proportion to their damaging effects in mortar. Aggregate has been recovered from hardened mortar and successfully tested for methylene blue dye adsorption. The method has been applied to a sample of mortar recovered from the site of a mortar failure...|$|R

He endeavours to get through, and succeeds in doing so, after much struggling as far as his shoulders; but finding that the soot is compressed hard all around him, by his exertions, that he can recede no farther; he then endeavours to move forward, but his attempts in this respect are quite abortive; for the covering of the horizontal part of the Flue being stone, the sharp angle of which bears hard on his shoulders, and the back part of his head prevents him from moving in the least either one way or the other. His face, already covered with a climbing cap, and being pressed hard in the soot beneath him, stops his breath. In this dreadful condition he strives violently to extricate himself, but his strength fails him; he cries and groans, and in a few minutes he is suffocated.

40|$|High-quality {{fine-grained}} ferroelectric glass-ceramic composites {{were successfully}} fabricated {{by using a}} modified hybrid processing. The properties of interfaces were investigated by using impedance spectroscopy (IS). In our measured impedance spectra, a polarization with an ideal Debye behavior was observed at intermediate frequency ranging between 1 kHz and 100 kHz. This polarization was attributed to the space charge accumulation at the grain-boundary interfaces, due {{to the presence of}} large dielectric constant difference between the fillers and the host. Basing on the IS results, a <b>brick-layer</b> microstructural model was proposed for the ferroelectric glass-ceramic composites. Our studies indicated that the new modified hybrid processing can be used to design composites with desired interfaces that have a homogeneous dielectric constant, so as to achieve high breakdown strength, thus leading to high electrical energy density storage devices.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that the already large {{dielectric}} constants of some electrolytes like BaTiO 3 can be enhanced further by adding metallic (e. g. Ni, Cu or Ag) nanoparticles. The enhancement can be quite large, a factor of more than 1000 is possible. The consequences for the properties will be discussed in the present paper applying a <b>brick-layer</b> model (BLM) for calculating dc-resistivities of thin layers and a modified one (PBLM) that includes percolation for calculating dielectric properties of these materials. The PBLM results in an at least qualitative description and understanding of the physical phenomena: This model gives an explanation for the steep increase of the dielectric constant below the percolation threshold and why this increase is connected to a dramatic decrease of the breakdown voltage as well as the ability of storing electrical energy. We conclude that metallic electrolyte composites like BaTiO 3 are not appropriate for energy storage. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Self-assembled {{cylindrical}} aggregates of amphiphilic carbocyanine dye molecules {{are interesting}} candidates for synthetic light-harvesting systems and electronic energy transport wires. To {{be able to}} optimize the properties of such systems, detailed information on the molecular structure {{as well as the}} static and dynamic optical properties is required. We report cryo-transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM) experiments on 3, 3 '-bis(3 -sulfopropyl) - 5, 5 ', 6, 6 '-tetrachloro- 1, 1 '-dioctylbenzimidacarbocyanine (C 8 S 3) aggregates that reveal a double-layer tubular structure. By combining these results with information from both isotropic and polarized spectral responses, a detailed molecular picture of these aggregates is obtained. The basis of our theoretical analysis of the spectroscopic data is the formation of the inner and outer cylinders by rolling cyanine sheets with a <b>brick-layer</b> structure onto cylindrical surfaces with diameters of 11 and 16 nm. This model very well reproduces the spectral properties of the excitonic transitions of the C 8 S 3 aggregates. The combination of experimental and theoretical techniques for the first time provides detailed insight into the molecular arrangement inside these aggregates. ...|$|E
40|$|We {{report on}} {{impedance}} measurements of nano- and microcrystalline composites of the Li ion conductor Li 2 O and the ionic insulator B 2 O 3 {{as well as}} their interpretation in the frame of percolation models. In the experimental part, besides the dc conductivity and its dependence on composition and temperature (i. e. its activation energy) also the ac conductivity and its dependence on composition, temperature and frequency (i. e. the conductivity exponent) are presented. Striking differences between the nanocrystalline and the corresponding microcrystalline composites were found. Deviations of the ac from the dc results {{can be explained by the}} fact that the experiments probe ion dynamics on different time and thus length scales. In the theoretical part, a continuum percolation model, a <b>brick-layer</b> type bond percolation approach and a Voronoi construction are alternatively used to model the dc behaviour. Based merely on the largely different volume fractions of the interfaces between ionic conductor and insulator grains in the nano- and microcrystalline composites, good overall agreement with the experimental dc results is obtained. The high critical insulator content above which the experimental con-ductivity vanishes in the nanocrystalline composites suggests the presence of an additional Li diffusion passageway of nanometer length in the interface between nanocrystalline insulator grains. * Corresponding authors...|$|E
