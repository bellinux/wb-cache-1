5|$|Double {{burden is}} a term used to {{describe}} the workload of people who work to earn money, <b>but</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> also responsible for significant amounts of unpaid domestic labor. This phenomenon is also known as The Second Shift as in Arlie Hochschild's book of the same name. In heterosexual couples where both partners have paid jobs, women often spend significantly more time than men on household chores and caring work, such as childrearing or caring for sick family members. This outcome is determined in large part by traditional gender roles that have been accepted by society over time. Labor market constraints also play a role in determining who does the bulk of unpaid work.|$|E
5|$|Tonsillectomy {{may be a}} {{reasonable}} preventive measure in those with frequent throat infections (more than three a year). However, the benefits are small and episodes typically lessen in time regardless of measures taken. Recurrent episodes of pharyngitis which test positive for GAS may also represent {{a person who is}} a chronic carrier of GAS who is getting recurrent viral infections. Treating people who have been exposed <b>but</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> without symptoms is not recommended. Treating people who are carriers of GAS is not recommended as the risk of spread and complications is low.|$|E
5|$|Under the Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA), {{students}} and their educational employers are exempted from paying Social Security taxes. The Treasury Department issued a regulation in 2004, declaring those who worked more than 40 hours a week were ineligible for such an exemption. The Mayo Foundation filed suit to challenge the regulation and for a refund of the taxes it had paid on its medical residents—recently graduated physicians who work more than full-time providing patient care, <b>but</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> still considered trainees by the medical profession. The District Court ruled for the Mayo Foundation and struck the regulation, but was reversed by the Court of Appeals.|$|E

5|$|Males {{are also}} {{affected}} by societal expectations, such as notions about masculinity and sexual prowess. Men from some traditional backgrounds may feel performance pressure {{that emphasizes the}} ability to have erections and sexual intercourse. Men who have strong sexual desire <b>but</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> not able to perform sexually may be {{at increased risk for}} depression, particularly when they believe strongly in traditional masculine gender norms with sexual function as core to the male identity. Men who strongly believe in these traditional roles may feel sexually inadequate, unmanly, insecure, and less satisfied with life. Since sexual dysfunction has this negative impact on self-esteem, treatment of erectile dysfunction can have a psychological benefit even though it does not help with physical sensation. SCI may necessitate reappraisal and rejection of assumptions about gender norms and sexual function in order to adjust healthily to the disability: those who are able to change the way they think about gender roles may have better life satisfaction and outcomes with rehabilitation. Counseling is helpful in this reassessment process.|$|E

25|$|Brain {{death may}} result in legal death, but still with the heart beating, and with {{mechanical}} ventilation, all other vital organs may be kept alive and functional for {{a certain period of}} time. Given long enough, patients who do not fully die, in the complete biological sense, <b>but</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> declared brain dead will usually, either after a shorter or longer interval, depending upon the patient's case and the type and extent of trauma and their age and prior health, start to build up toxins and wastes in the body, and the organs (especially sensitive ones like the brain, nerves, heart, blood vessels, lungs, liver, intestines, and kidneys) eventually can dysfunction, have coagulopathies or fluid and electrolyte and nutrient imbalances, or even fail- partially, or completely and irreversibly. Thus, the organs will usually only be sustainable and viable for acceptable use up until a certain length of time (most organs that are transplanted fortunately have widely used and agreed upon parameters, that are measurable and reliable, when determining their welfare and level of function). This will depend on how well the patient is maintained, any other comorbidities, the skill of the medical, nursing, and surgical teams, {{and the quality of the}} care and the facilities- and once removed, the time and the mode of transport and how smoothly the transplant procedure (and the care before, during, and after the operation), goes. Given optimal care and oversight, and with the person's (through a directive or driver's license) and/or guardian or next of kin or power of attorney's informed consent, certain cases can provide optimal opportunities for organ transplantation. A major point of contention is whether transplantation should be allowed at all if the patient is not yet fully (biologically) dead, and if brain death is acceptable, whether the person's whole brain needs to have died, or if the death of a part of the brain (i.e., the cerebrum- which makes us human in our intellectual, and indeed all, conscious capacities; or the brain stem- which controls vital organic functions needed for life, like breathing and precise heartbeat regulation) is enough for legal and ethical and moral purposes.|$|E

The rest of Buffland's society, as displayed at a party at Temple's house, is composed of [...] "a group of gossipy matrons, vacuous town belles, and silly swains".|$|E

500|$|Given little {{instruction}} from the studio, screenwriter Deborah Moggach spent {{over two years}} adapting Pride and Prejudice for film. She had sole discretion with the early script, and eventually wrote approximately ten drafts. Realising it held [...] "a perfect three-act structure", Moggach attempted to be as faithful to the original novel as possible, calling it [...] "so beautifully shaped as a story – the ultimate romance about two {{people who think they}} hate each other <b>but</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> really passionately in love. I felt, 'If it's not broken, don't fix it.'" [...] While she could not reproduce the novel's [...] "fiercely wonderful dialogue in its entirety", she attempted to keep much of it.|$|E
500|$|Mainly {{composed}} of 40- to 50-year-old {{people and a}} majority of women, the membership is almost the same as that which was attracted by Spiritism in Belgium in the 19th century. The followers have mostly modest social status, such as miners and artisans, and are generally people interested in spirituality, <b>but</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> at odds with the Catholic Church or display a skeptical attitude towards traditional medicine. Antoinists are also sometimes Jews, Muslims, Buddhists, adepts of reiki, yoga, or t'ai chi ch'uan, or former Catholics. An accurate depiction of Antoinists of Northern France was made by writer [...] in his 1928 novel Without Soul (Sans âme). In 1945, Debouxhtay described followers as [...] "very kind, very charitable and very obliging people".|$|E
500|$|Lee later lamented: [...] "Malaysia — to whom does it belong? To Malaysians. <b>But</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> Malaysians? I hope I am, Mr Speaker, Sir.

This is the doubt that hangs over many minds, and ... {{emotions}} are set in motion, and men pitted against men along these unspoken lines, you will {{have the kind of}} warfare that will split the nation from top to bottom and undo Malaysia." [...] At times, however, Lee worsened things by making racial comments of his own. Many of his speeches harped on the ethnic composition of Malaysia, reminding listeners that the non-Malays were now in the majority, with 61% of the population to the Malays' 39% asking at one point, [...] "Why should we go back to old Singapore and once again reduce the non-Malays in Malaya to a minority?" [...] Lee exacerbated deteriorating PAP-UMNO relations by constantly demanding that the federal government [...] "smack down their 'ultras'", whose ranks included prominent UMNO leaders such as Syed Jaafar Albar and Syed Nasir Ismail.|$|E

500|$|The Act {{gives the}} courts almost {{unlimited}} power {{to exercise their}} jurisdiction to form [...] "compromise" [...] agreements, with Section 1(1) allowing them to approve [...] "any arrangement...varying or revoking all {{or any of the}} trusts or enlarging the powers of the trustees of managing or administering any of the property subject to the trusts". [...] This power can be exercised for people in one of four categories: beneficiaries who are incapable of assenting to the change (infants or those who are otherwise incapable); individuals who may [...] "be entitled" [...] to be beneficiaries in the future, <b>but</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> not at present; unborn beneficiaries; or people who may be beneficiaries under protective trusts. The first three classes may only have a [...] "compromise" [...] agreement if the alterations are for their benefit, while potential beneficiaries under protective trusts have no such limit. The courts have chosen to interpret [...] "benefit" [...] widely, increasing their powers to alter trusts; in Re Holt's Settlement [...] 1 All ER 470, Megarry J said that [...] "the word benefit is... plainly not confined to financial benefit, but may extend to social or moral benefit". Under Section 1(3), the Act does not apply to trusts created by an Act of Parliament. The wide scope of the act was quantified in Re Steed's Will Trusts, where the Court of Appeal ruled that the word [...] "arrangement" [...] was [...] "deliberately used in the widest possible senses so as to cover any proposal which any person may put forward for varying or revoking the trusts", essentially allowing the courts the right to make any alteration whatsoever. Despite this, the Court of Appeal noted in Re T's Settlement Trusts [...] Ch 158 that the court would not permit a compromise agreement where it not only varied the terms of the trust but constituted the creation of an entirely new one.|$|E
