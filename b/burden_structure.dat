Mergers in most industries are subject only to antitrust review by the U. S. Department of Justice (DOJ). Telecommunications mergers, however, are also reviewed by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) under its flexible public interest standard. This system of dual review causes delay, redundancy, and a perversion of antitrust and telecommunications law. This Note examines the system of dual review {{through the lens of}} the AT 2 ̆ 6 T/T-Mobile merger, which was proposed and eventually abandoned in 2011. After outlining the historical development and statutory authority for dual review, the Note demonstrates how dual review altered the DOJ’s typical <b>burden</b> <b>structure</b> in its attempt to block the AT 2 ̆ 6 T/T-Mobile merger. Finally, the Note presents a proposal for reform to the FCC’s review, arguing for a significant limitation in scope and the imposition of a strict time limit...|$|E

We investigated cortical thickness in the medial temporal lobe (MTL), hippocampal volume, as well as relationships among metabolic risk factor <b>burden,</b> <b>structure</b> and memory performance. Path-analytic models were tested to explore the relations between MetS risk factor, structure and memory performance. Participants were 65 non-demented, middle-aged and older adults, 34 with and 31 without metabolic syndrome. We analyzed archival T 1 -weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) acquired at 3 T and Total Recall and Delayed Recall scores from the Brief Visuospatial Memory Test Revised (BVMT-R). Middle-aged adults with MetS showed less MTL thickness, particularly in entorhinal cortex; while older adults showed a trend for left hippocampal volume loss. Lower MTL thickness, particularly in entorhinal cortex, was associated with greater metabolic risk factor burden in middle-aged adults. In older adults, hippocampal volume was associated with Total Recall and Delayed Recall, while in middle-age entorhinal cortical thickness mediated the association between metabolic disease burden and episodic memory function. The differential findings in middle-aged and older adults with MetS contribute {{to an understanding of the}} relationships between metabolic syndrome, structural changes in the brain and increased risk for cognitive decline...|$|E

The strategy generally relied upon there being a double taxation treaty between a large jurisdiction with a high tax burden (that the company would otherwise be subject to), and a smaller jurisdiction with a low tax <b>burden.</b> By <b>structuring</b> the group ownership through the smaller jurisdiction, corporations could take advantage of the double taxation treaty, paying taxes at the much lower rate. Although some of these double tax treaties survive,, for example between Barbados and Japan, between Cyprus and Russia and Mauritius with India, which India sought to renegotiate in 2007, most major countries began repealing their double taxation treaties with micro-states in the 1970s, to prevent corporate tax leakage in this manner.|$|R

Database systems frequently establish the B+-tree style indices for fast access to data records. However, traditional B+-tree index could be a performance bottleneck because of its inflatable hierarchy. Many works focus on improving indexing techniques. In fact, the optimization of data organization inside index nodes is the most critical factor to improve retrieval quality.

In addition, the entire index’s space utilization is promoted to a higher level; thereby the index’s space requirement becomes smaller and easily resides in memory...|$|R
40|$|Structures {{constitute}} {{more than}} three-quarters of the U. S. tangible capital stock. Despite their relatively low rates of depreciation, struc-tures account {{for more than half of}} all gross fixed investment in most years. Tax policies potentially have a major impact on both the level and composition of investment in structures. Two aspects of the tax-ation of structures-the relative <b>burden</b> placed on <b>structures</b> as opposed to equipment investment and the nontaxation of owner-occupied hous-ing under the income tax-have attracted substantial attention in recent years. This paper explores these two aspects of the taxation of in-vestments in structures. The U. S. Department of the Treasury (1984), in its recent tax reform proposal, pointed to the extra tax <b>burdens</b> placed on <b>structures</b> relative to equipment as a major defect of the current Accelerated Cost Re-covery System (ACRS). The 1985 Economic Report of the President echoes this sentiment, concluding, “The effective tax rate [...] . is lower for equipment than for structures. Because different industries utilize different mixes of capital goods, differential taxation of assets results in differential taxation of capital income by industry. The average ef-fective Federal corporate tax rate on fixed investment varies widely by industry. ” The decisions of the Congress in 1984 and 1985 to scale back the depreciation benefits to structures but not to equipment is perhaps surprising in the light of these conclusions. The allegedly favorable treatment of owner-occupied housing has long been a target of academic critics of the tax system, although James R.

The greatest challenge for obtaining annotations remains getting users to perform {{the large amount of}} tedious man-ual work that is required. In this paper we introduce an approach for semi-automated labeling based on extraction of metadata from naturally occurring conversa-tions of groups of people discussing pictures among themselves. As the <b>burden</b> for <b>structuring</b> and extracting metadata is shifted from users to the system, new recognition challenges arise. We explore how multimodal language can help in 1) detecting a con-cise set of meaningful labels to be associated with each photo, 2) achieving robust recognition of these key semantic terms, and 3) facilitating label propagation via multimodal shortcuts. Analysis of the data of a preliminary pilot collection suggests that hand-written labels may be highly indicative of the semantics of each photo, as indicated by the correlation of handwritten terms with high frequency spoken ones. We point to initial directions explor-ing a multimodal fusion technique to recover robust spelling and pronunciation of these high-value terms from redundant speech and handwriting...|$|R

It aims to translate innovative and efficacious health programs into practices and to ensure their effective implementation. In the setting of residential aged care, to date, there has been little research on factors which enable or hinder the implementation of health promotion programs. Methods: By a qualitative study, the implementation of a physical activity program for the elderly in three Viennese residential care homes has been investigated. 12 semi-structured interviews with persons responsible for program implementation (executives and adopters) have been conducted. Results: The strategic anchoring of the program and therewith the strong adoption of leadership roles by executive staff proved as facilitating factors. The program was compatible with the role identity and expertise of the occupational group responsible for implementation. Furthermore, it offered opportunities for professional development and autonomy. As hindering proved the ongoing redeployment process in course of which the program implementation was perceived as an additional <b>burden.</b> Moreover, <b>structures</b> for exchange and cooperation were missing.

40|$|Both Title VII of the Civil Rights Act (CRA) of 1964 and the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA) {{prohibit}} employers {{from making}} an adverse employment decision “because of” certain improper criteria. The Supreme Court’s opinion in Gross v. FBL Financial Services, Inc. explored the plain meaning of “because of” {{to determine the}} threshold for causation required under the ADEA. Curiously, the Gross Court came to a different conclusion than the Justices who engaged in the same exploration of “because of” under Title VII in Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins. The Court’s underdeveloped plain meaning argument and failure to elevate its choice of statutory interpretation over the obvious and compelling alternatives call into question whether these portions of the opinion were determinative of the holding. The Gross Court’s skepticism of the motivating factor standard and mixed-motive burden-shifting scheme that developed under the Title VII analysis, though not as thoroughly explored in the Court’s opinion, provides a more intelligible rationale for the outcome in Gross. In maintaining {{that this was an}} exercise in scrutinizing the language of the statute instead of explaining the persuasive force of the practical considerations, the Court created confusion over whether the Price Waterhouse analysis might still apply to other statutes with “because of” or other similar causation language. Some of the confusion in the Court’s opinion also stems from the conflation of causation standards with burden schemes. While it makes sense that Gross addressed both causation and burdens, given that Price Waterhouse created the burden-shifting scheme in part to balance the plaintiff’s lower, motivating-factor causation burden, this Note will attempt to separate the ideas in an effort to show how the respective opinions grappled with the proper allocation of the burden of persuasion in discrimination cases, the difficult problem of dissecting the motivations for an employment decision, and the heightened evidentiary requirement, if any, under a burden-shifting scheme. After detailing the complex history of mixed-motive burden-shifting in discrimination cases that led to this particular brand of ambiguity over congressional intent and sampling the variety produced when lower courts have applied Gross to other statutes, this Note will make the case that the majority’s decision was driven by an understanding of the practical difficulties that mixed-motive burden-shifting has created, a skepticism about how well the doctrine accomplishes justice, and a legal conservatism that favors traditional causation and burden schemes. Further, the Note will argue that Gross is not, as the Court’s reasoning would suggest, about the level of causation burden that must be satisfied but rather about who bears that burden. Though Congress has codified the mixed-motive burden-shifting scheme in the language of Title VII through post-Price Waterhouse amendments, Gross reverts to the allocation that speaks to simplicity and judicial restraint by applying the traditional default causation standard: that the plaintiff bears the burden of persuasion by a preponderance of the evidence. Finally, the Note will make the case that while Gross appears to cast doubt on all Title VII burden-shifting precedents, the Court’s attention to practical applications and inclination toward traditional <b>burden</b> <b>structures</b> might be compatible with the shifting burden of production under McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, which provides a sufficient guard against the inequities of asymmetric information, maintains the least restrictive burden on employers, provides for the most intuitive jury instructions, and maintains the traditional burden of persuasion...|$|R

In sub-Saharan Africa, {{there are very few}} well-tested survey instruments measuring population attributes related to non-communicable diseases. To meet this need, we have developed and validated the first instrument evaluating knowledge, attitudes and practices pertaining to chronic kidney disease in a Swahili-speaking population. Between December 2013 and June 2014, we conducted a four-stage, mixed-methods study among adults from the general population of northern Tanzania. In stage 1, the survey instrument was constructed in English by a group of cross-cultural experts from multiple disciplines and through content analysis of focus group discussions to ensure local significance. Following translation, in stage 2, we piloted the survey through cognitive and structured interviews, and in stage 3, in order to obtain initial evidence of reliability and construct validity, we recruited and then administered the instrument to a random sample of 606 adults. In stage 4, we conducted analyses to establish test-retest reliability and known-groups validity which was informed by thematic analysis of the qualitative data in stages 1 and 2. The final version consisted of 25 items divided into three conceptual domains: knowledge, attitudes and practices. Each item demonstrated excellent test-retest reliability with established content and construct validity. We have developed a reliable and valid cross-cultural survey instrument designed to measure knowledge, attitudes and practices of chronic kidney disease in a Swahili-speaking population of Northern Tanzania.

40|$|Economic {{policy in}} Serbia {{as in other}} {{countries}} in the process of economic transition and consolidation of democracy emerges as a source of opportunistic and ideologically motiva-ted political manipulation. This manipulation was primarily by fiscal policy, motivated by opportunistic motives of policymakers.

Simultaneously, the size and structure of government expenditure was also determined by privatization revenues, which were partly channeled to the state bud-get. Fiscal manipulation therefore prevented formation of an efficient fiscal system and a transparent budget process which created an additional restriction on the macroeconomic policy in Serbia during the period of the global economic crisis when the need to stimulate economic activity required measures of fiscal stimulus.

40|$|One of {{the main}} {{concerns}} related to pandemic H 1 N 1 influenza 2009 is the overwhelming <b>burden</b> on medical <b>structures.</b> The aim of this work is to study the behaviour and attitudes of Nurses {{in relation to the}} spreading pandemic in order to develop public health strategies. During the spread of Pandemic, in winter 2009, an anonymous questionnaire online of thirty-four questions was available for participants. Data obtained were analyzed using descriptive, univariate and multivariate statistics. A total of 2313 nurses were interviewed. In univariate analysis 72. 6 % of 573 males (versus 63. 9 % of 1740 females) have been talk to a doctor (p< 0. 001). The female group appear less likely to get vaccinated (60. 3 % vs 51. 1 %, p< 0. 001). Multivariate analysis revealed that to be worried (OR= 2. 82 95 % CI: 2. 31 - 3. 46), female (OR= 0. 62 95 % CI: 0. 51 - 0. 77), age group 30 - 49 (OR= 0. 72 95 % CI: 0. 58 - 0. 90) were associated with the willingness of Get vaccinated. Prevention, as washing hands and vaccination, are crucial in pandemics events. Given the low rates of acceptance of pandemic vaccination among nurses, public health bodies should consider campaign education, in order to prevent nosocomial transmission, to protect patients and the continuity of the essential health-care infrastructure...|$|R
40|$|More {{than three}} {{quarters}} of the United States tangible capital stock represents structures. Tax policies potentially {{have a major impact on}} both the level and composition of investment in structures and equipment. This point is explicitly recognized in most discussions of the effects of capital income taxation. Two aspects of the taxation of structures [...] the relative <b>burden</b> placed on <b>structures</b> as opposed to equipment investment and the non-taxation of owner occupied housing under the income tax [...] have attracted substantial attention in recent years. This paper explores these two aspects of the taxation of structures investments. While the tax system may well have a potent impact on the level and composition of structures investment, this paper argues that conventional analyses of these effects are very misleading. We reach two main conclusions. First,under current tax law, certain types of structures investment are very highly tax favored. Structures can be transferred and therefore depreciated more than once, and structures may be readily financed with tax-favored debt. Overall, itis unlikely that a significant bias towards equipment and against structures exists under current law. Second, the conventional view that the tax system is biased in favor of homeownership is wrong. Because of the possibility of "tax arbitrage" between high bracket landlords and low bracket tenants, the tax system has long favored rental over ownership for most households. The 1981 reforms by reducing the top marginal tax rate reduced this bias somewhat. ...|$|R
40|$|The World Economic Forum (WEF) is {{a global}} {{governance}} actor that has in recent years taken an increased interest in issues pertaining to gender equality and women's empowerment. The paper critically investigates {{the work of the}} WEF in this area, suggesting that WEF-produced gender and development discourse is profoundly compatible with the politics and practices of neoliberalism-not least {{in the way in which}} it aligns gender equality and women's empowerment with national economic competitiveness. This is, furthermore, a distinctly postfeminist reading of gender that rests upon the production of neoliberal-compatible female subjectivities-such as "rational economic woman" or "Davos woman"-who emerge as those in society best able to deliver fair and sustainable economic growth (effectively rescuing global capitalism from the excesses of hypermasculine crisis capitalism). The framing of the case for gender equality and women's empowerment in these terms is powerful and may well be an effective way for gender advocates to present their demands. But by analyzing not only how the WEF has framed/represented gender issues but also what has been left out of this representation, the paper points to the way in which simplistic representations concerning the contribution that women make to economic competitiveness disguise the double <b>burdens</b> and gendered <b>structures</b> of socioeconomic inequality that are central to the widening and deepening of the market into all spheres of social life under conditions of roll-back neoliberalism. 頲 013 International Studies Association.

40|$|Background: A {{study was}} {{conducted}} {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} afoxolaner chewables to control flea populations in naturally infested dogs in private residences in Tampa FL, USA. Evaluations of on-animal and premises flea <b>burdens,</b> flea sex <b>structure</b> and fed-unfed premises flea populations were conducted to more accurately assess flea population dynamics in households. Methods: Thirty seven naturally flea infested dogs in 23 homes in Tampa, FL were enrolled in the study and treated with afoxolaner chewables. Chewables (NexGard ® Chewables; Merial) were administered according to label directions by study investigators on study day 0 and once again between study days 28 and 30. Flea infestations on pets were assessed using visual area thumb counts and premises flea infestations were assessed using intermittent-light flea traps on days 0, 7, 14, 21, and once between study days 28 – 30, 40 – 45, and 54 – 60. Results: Within 7 days of administration of afoxolaner chewable tablets, flea counts on dogs were reduced by 99. 3 %. By one month post-treatment, total flea counts on dogs were reduced by 99. 9 %, with 97. 3 % (36 / 37) of the dogs being flea free. Following the second dosing on study day 28 – 30, total on-dog flea burden was reduced by 100 % on days 40 – 45 and 54 – 60. On day 0, the traps collected a geometric mean of 18. 2 fleas. Subsequent reductions in emerging flea populations were 97. 7 and 100 % by days 28 – 30 and 54 – 60, respectively. There were 515 total fleas (Ctenocephalide...|$|R
