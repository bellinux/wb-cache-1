40|$|AbstractConcave beta {{sources of}} 106 Ru/ 106 Rh {{are used in}} {{radiotherapy}} to treat ophthalmic tumors. However, a problem that arises is the difficult determination of absorbed dose distributions around such sources {{mainly because of the}} small range of the electrons and the steep dose gradients. In this sense, numerical methods have been developed to calculate the dose distributions around the beta applicators. In this work a simple code in Fortran language is developed to estimate the dose rates along the central axis of 106 Ru/ 106 Rh curved plaques by numerical integration of the <b>beta</b> <b>point</b> <b>source</b> function and results are compared with other calculated data...|$|E
40|$|The Bremsstrahlung {{exposure}} rate from <b>beta</b> <b>point</b> <b>source,</b> probability of energy loss by beta during the Bremsstrahlung emission and the Bremsstrahlung activity of tissues have been calculated. The Bremsstrahlung yield for tissues {{in the wide}} energy range is also estimated from 0. 01 to 100 MeV using the tabulated values given for elements by Lucien pages. The estimated Bremsstrahlung activities of pure beta nuclides in all types of tissues are extremely large (102106 GBq). The patients receiving such nuclides would never receive that much activity because of prohibitive radiation toxicity (few 100 MBq). Thus the patients receiving these pure beta emitting nuclides {{do not have to}} be hospitalized for radiation precautions. Â© 2010 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|MOPEX (MOsaicking and <b>Point</b> <b>source</b> EXtraction) is {{a package}} {{developed}} at the Spitzer Science Center for astronomical image processing. We report on the <b>point</b> <b>source</b> extraction capabilities of MOPEX. <b>Point</b> <b>source</b> extraction is implemented as a two step process: <b>point</b> <b>source</b> detection and profile fitting. Non-linear matched filtering of input images can be performed optionally to increase the signal-to-noise ratio and improve detection of faint <b>point</b> <b>sources.</b> <b>Point</b> Response Function (PRF) fitting of <b>point</b> <b>sources</b> produces the final <b>point</b> <b>source</b> list which includes the fluxes and improved positions of the <b>point</b> <b>sources,</b> along with other parameters characterizing the fit. Passive and active deblending allows for successful fitting of confused <b>point</b> <b>sources.</b> Aperture photometry can also be computed for every extracted <b>point</b> <b>source</b> for an unlimited number of aperture sizes. PRF is estimated directly from the input images. Implementation of efficient methods of background and noise estimation, and modified Simplex algorithm contribute to the computational efficiency of MOPEX. The package is implemented as a loosely connected set of perl scripts, where each script runs a number of modules written in C/C++. Input parameter setting is done through namelists, ASCII configuration files. We present applications of <b>point</b> <b>source</b> extraction to the mosaic images taken at 24 and 70 micron with the Multiband Imaging Photometer (MIPS) {{as part of the}} Spitzer extragalactic First Look Survey and to a Digital Sky Survey image.

It includes most of the sources included in the standard WMAP 7 -year <b>point</b> <b>source</b> catalogues {{as well as a}} large number of new detections. Here we study the effects on the estimated CMB power spectrum when taking the newly detected <b>point</b> <b>sources</b> into consideration. We create <b>point</b> <b>source</b> masks for all the 2102 sources that we detected as well as a smaller one for the 665 sources detected in the Q, V and W bands. We also create WMAP 7 maps with <b>point</b> <b>sources</b> subtracted in order to compare with the spectrum obtained with source masks. The extended <b>point</b> <b>source</b> masks and <b>point</b> <b>source</b> cleaned WMAP 7 maps are made publicly available. Using the proper residual correction, we find that the CMB power spectrum obtained from the <b>point</b> <b>source</b> cleaned map without any source mask is fully consistent with the spectrum obtained from the masked map. We further find that the spectrum obtained masking all 2102 sources is consistent with the results obtained using the standard WMAP 7 -year <b>point</b> <b>source</b> mask (KQ 85 y 7).

40|$|The <b>point</b> <b>source</b> {{approximation}} {{is widely}} used for earthquake representation because it is computationally efficient for certain kinds of synthetic calculations. It {{is based on the}} assumption that the seismic wave-field generated by a realistic source will match up with that generated by the corresponding centroid <b>point</b> <b>source,</b> as long as the waves investigated have sufficiently long wavelengths and periods. It is important to know whether this approximation is valid, otherwise unknown errors can be introduced into results based using the this approximation. In order to get an idea of the validity of the <b>point</b> <b>source</b> approximation, we compare the wave-field generated by various distributions of <b>point</b> <b>sources</b> to that generated by the corresponding centroid <b>point</b> <b>source.</b> While the <b>point</b> <b>source</b> distributions used do not represent the full complexity of seismic sources, these tests are still useful to explore some of the effects of combining multiple <b>point</b> <b>sources</b> into a single centroid <b>point</b> <b>source,</b> which is what the <b>point</b> <b>source</b> approximation is based on. In the case of an event consisting of two <b>point</b> <b>sources,</b> the time difference between the two <b>point</b> <b>sources</b> before the misfit with the centroid becomes significant, is approximately 7 seconds. In reality, this may represent events with durations over half the length of the shortest period investigated, since it is unlikely that all energy is released at the two ends of an event. For the spatial dimensions, the misfit may become significant for an offset close to 40 kilometres, while at 50 kilometres, around one third of the shortest wavelength, the misfit is already very large. Realistic rupture times indicate that for sources with spatial offset closer to 20 kilometres, the misfit should be very small. Events consisting of more than two <b>point</b> <b>sources</b> may interact in a way to create patches of high misfit that could affect stations located at the same location as these patches...|$|R

40|$|Spatial data is {{increasingly}} important in emission inventories. Over the last 5 years, the Internet, public “right to know”, and environmental justice programs have greatly increased the visibility {{and use of}} emission inventory data. The increased visibility of inventory data in turn increases the need for accurate spatial inventory data.
