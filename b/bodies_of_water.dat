5|$|Waterspouts {{have similar}} {{characteristics}} as tornadoes, {{characterized by a}} spiraling funnel-shaped wind current that form over <b>bodies</b> <b>of</b> <b>water,</b> connecting to large cumulonimbus clouds. Waterspouts are generally classified as forms of tornadoes, or more specifically, non-supercelled tornadoes that develop over large <b>bodies</b> <b>of</b> <b>water.</b> These spiralling columns of air are frequently developed within tropical areas close to the equator, but are less common within areas of high latitude.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{its high}} salt concentration, the lake water is unusually dense, and most people can float more easily than in other <b>bodies</b> <b>of</b> <b>water,</b> {{particularly}} in Gunnison Bay, the saltier north arm of the lake.|$|E
50|$|A forebay is an {{artificial}} pool <b>of</b> <b>water</b> in front <b>of</b> a larger <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>water.</b> The larger <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> may be natural or man-made.|$|R
50|$|In hydrology, the inflow <b>of</b> a <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> is {{the source}} <b>of</b> the <b>water</b> in the <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>water.</b> It can also refer to the average volume <b>of</b> {{incoming}} <b>water</b> in unit time. It is contrasted with outflow.|$|R
50|$|A {{method and}} an {{apparatus}} for lifting a mass <b>of</b> <b>water</b> with a container {{from a larger}} <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>water,</b> in which method the container having at least one open opening is first located below the surface level <b>of</b> the larger <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> and the container is full <b>of</b> <b>water,</b> wherein the container is raised partially above the surface level <b>of</b> the <b>water</b> by elements attached to the container, and that {{the at least one}} open opening of the container is located below the surface level <b>of</b> the larger <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> during and after raising of the container thus lifting the mass <b>of</b> <b>water</b> located inside the raised portion of container above the surface level <b>of</b> the larger <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>water.</b>|$|R

5|$|A granite wall {{surrounds}} the temple, enclosing all its shrines and six of its seven <b>bodies</b> <b>of</b> <b>water.</b> The rajagopuram, the temple's gateway tower, is unfinished. A swastika shaped temple tank built in 800 AD by Kamban Araiyan {{during the reign}} of Dantivarman is outside the temple complex. The Vijayanagar and Nayak kings commissioned paintings {{on the walls of the}} shrine of Pudarikakshan, some of which are still present.|$|E
50|$|The open <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> in Skeleton Lake {{is about}} the largest open <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> in all the Muskoka Lakes. This makes it an {{excellent}} lake for such sports as sailing and windsurfing, though there can be rough water.|$|R
5000|$|A great pond {{is defined}} in Maine state statute as [...] "any inland <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> which in a natural state has a surface area in excess of 10 acres (40,000 m²) and any inland <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> artificially formed or {{increased}} which has a surface area in excess of 30 acres (120,000 m²) except {{for the purposes of}} this article, where the artificially formed or increased inland <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> is completely surrounded by land held by a single owner." ...|$|R
50|$|This {{attributed}} quote uses a <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> as {{a metaphor}} for a <b>body</b> <b>of</b> knowledge with the ironical idea of someone who gained so little from his education that he achieved the impossible of jumping into a <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> and climbing back out without getting wet.|$|R
5|$|Besides its prairie restorations and <b>bodies</b> <b>of</b> <b>water,</b> Silver Springs has {{areas of}} {{deciduous}} forests, and wetlands, {{both of which}} are populated with species of mammals, birds and insects. Bird life observed in the park includes: osprey, great horned owl, eastern screech owl and long-eared owl; bald eagle have been sighted further upstream along the Fox. Reptiles and amphibians are present in the park but are more elusive than other types of animal life.|$|E
5|$|Caprella mutica inhabit shallow {{protected}} marine <b>bodies</b> <b>of</b> <b>water.</b> They {{can often}} be found in dense colonies attached to submerged artificial structures, marine macroalgae, and other organisms. They are primarily omnivorous detritivores, but can adapt to other feeding methods depending on food availability. They are preyed upon by fish, crabs, and several other predators.|$|E
5|$|Capybaras are semiaquatic mammals found {{throughout}} almost all countries of South America except Chile. They live in densely forested areas near <b>bodies</b> <b>of</b> <b>water,</b> such as lakes, rivers, swamps, ponds, and marshes, {{as well as}} flooded savannah and along rivers in tropical forest. Capybara have flourished in cattle ranches. They roam in home ranges averaging 10 hectares (25 acres) in high-density populations.|$|E
50|$|P. varius {{alters the}} {{behavior}} of its definitive host, resulting in the host traveling to or near a <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>water.</b> The host is then manipulated into entering the <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> where the larvae can develop into an adult and exit its host.|$|R
50|$|This smaller lake {{is often}} {{confused}} with the similar named yet larger Marion Reservoir, which is north-west of Marion. Most locals refer to the larger <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> using the term 'Reservoir', and the smaller <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> using the term 'Lake' (this article).|$|R
5000|$|Fundy (the fishing boat) {{gets his}} name from the Bay <b>of</b> Fundy, the <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> that {{separates}} southern Nova Scotia from southern New Brunswick and eastern Maine, and is the <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> with the world's largest tides, that can exceed 16 m.|$|R
5|$|During the Late Archaic period, {{the climate}} became wetter again and by {{approximately}} 3000 BCE {{the rise of}} water tables allowed an increase in population. Cultural development also took place. Florida Indians formed into three similar but distinct cultures: Okeechobee, Caloosahatchee, and Glades, named for the <b>bodies</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> where they were centered.|$|E
5|$|Fish are {{captured}} by cornering them in shallow water, usually against the bank or under logs. They take advantage when <b>bodies</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> begin {{to dry up}} in the summer or early fall and gorge themselves on the resulting high concentrations of fish and tadpoles. They were surprisingly unsuccessful at seizing either live or dead fish under water.|$|E
5|$|Highway 141 is 54.3km long. It {{travels through}} Muskoka District and Parry Sound District, {{travelling}} through {{the communities of}} Humphrey, Rosseau, Bent River (off-route but nearby), Ullswater, Raymond and Utterson. The road passes several <b>bodies</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> including Lake Rosseau, Skeleton Lake, Longs Lake and others. Other lakes are accessible via Highway 141 including Three Mile Lake, Lake Joseph, Horse Lake and others.|$|E
50|$|A lake (from Latin lacus) is a terrain feature, a <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> that is {{localized}} to {{the bottom}} <b>of</b> basin. A <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> is considered a lake when it is inland, {{is not part of}} an ocean, and is larger and deeper than a pond.|$|R

5|$|Offshore {{wind power}} {{refers to the}} {{construction}} of wind farms in large <b>bodies</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> to generate electric power. These installations can utilize the more frequent and powerful winds that are available in these locations and have less aesthetic impact on the landscape than land based projects. However, the construction and the maintenance costs are considerably higher.|$|E
5|$|Pinellas County lies on a {{peninsula}} between Tampa Bay and the Gulf of Mexico, {{and much}} of the city of Tampa lies on a smaller peninsula jutting out into Tampa Bay. This proximity to large <b>bodies</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> both moderates temperatures and introduces large amounts of humidity into the atmosphere. In general, the local communities farthest from the coast have larger temperature ranges, both during a single day and throughout the seasons of the year.|$|E
25|$|As is {{the case}} in many land use, land {{ownership}} and territorial disputes, the name currently officially assigned to this <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> has considerable significance.

40|$|What is the TMDL Process? A Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) is {{a written}} plan {{specific}} to a pollutant and a <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> that incorporates water quality monitoring data, exceedence frequency, sample time flow conditions, and the sources {{that may be}} contributing to the water quality problem. Its purpose is to identify pollution sources and propose a plan that will help achieve water quality standards for the <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>water.</b> The Clean Water Act calls for the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to work with state agencies which in turn work with interested parties {{in an effort to}} develop TMDLs to clean up the polluted <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>water.</b> Water quality standards are set by states, territories and tribes. They identify the uses for each <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>water,</b> such as drinking water supply, contact recreation (swimming) and aquatic life support, and the water quality criteria to support that use...|$|R
