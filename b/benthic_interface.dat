Nutrient release by pearl oyster culture in the water column and nutrient fluxes at the sedimentewater interface were compared in two contrasted conditions (i. e. under the influence or not of pearl oyster farming) in the Ahe atoll (French Polynesia). Nitrogen flux intensity was higher in the water column than at the <b>benthic</b> <b>interface.</b> Nitrogen was released at a rate of 31. 36 mmol h À 1 m À 2 in the water column and 12. 05 mmol h À 1 m À 2 at the sedimentewater interface. Average phosphorus flux was 2. 85 mmol h À 1 m À 2 at the sedimentewater interface and 2. 16 mmol h À 1 m À 2 in the water column. In this deep lagoon, pearl oyster culture exerted more influence in the pelagic compartment than at the <b>benthic</b> <b>interface</b> where flux rate seemed not to be influenced by the presence of pearl oyster culture. These results demonstrate that it is essential to study these two interfaces in concert when assessing the impact of suspended shellfish farming on nutrient dynamics. Overall, the impact of pearl oyster culture may stimulate phytoplankton growth near cultivation areas through the rapid recycling of inorganic nutrients...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to measure the effects of invertebrates on the physical characteristics and microbial processes in hyporheic sediments. We investigated the impacts of an assemblage of three taxa (asellids, chironomid larvae, and tubificid worms) on sediment distribution, water fluxes, sediment organic carbon, biofilm (attached bacteria) characteristics, and O 2, dissolved organic carbon NO 3 −, NO 2 −, and NH 4 + concentrations in slow filtration sand–gravel columns. The results showed that invertebrates clearly modified the distribution of particles in the sediment column, probably because of the structures (tubes, macropores, and faecal pellets) produced by the three taxa in the sediment. Our assessment of water fluxes indicated that invertebrate activities led to an increase in the porosity of the sediment columns. In addition, aerobic (O 2 consumption) and anaerobic (denitrification and fermentative decomposition of organic matter) microbial processes occurring in the sediment were stimulated in the presence of invertebrates. Finally, the present study demonstrates that invertebrates can act as ecosystem engineers in heterogeneous sediments that are under the influence of an advective flux of water. The solute residence time increased in columns containing the faunal assemblage. Micro-organisms used more dissolved organic matter and nutrients in the presence of invertebrates because invertebrate activities increased the contact between the biofilm and water. We conclude that engineering by invertebrates in natural conditions modifies characteristics of the hyporheic zone and thereby enhances both the porosity of the sediment and the solute transport across the <b>benthic</b> <b>interface...</b>|$|E
40|$|Patches of benthic diatoms covered 23 to 73 % of the {{sediment}} area at water depths down to 30 m {{of a high}} Arctic fjord system (Young Sound, NE Greenland). Mapping of the in situ chlorophyll (chl a) fluorescence by a pulse amplitude modulated (PAM) fluorometer demonstrated the presence of diatom-covered sediment patches with a characteristic size scale of 5 to 8 m. The benthic diatoms were well adapted to the ambient irradiance as demonstrated by in situ measurements of the relative electron transport rate (ETR) versus irradiance. However, {{the characteristics of the}} PE (photosynthesis versus downwelling irradiance) relations changed within minutes after exposure to changed light conditions neutralizing any depth related light acclimation. This demonstrated that the diatoms efficiently optimized their photosynthetic apparatus to the current light conditions. Steady state O- 2 microprofiles measured in situ and in the laboratory showed a gradual increase in the O- 2 penetration depth and O- 2 concentration at {{the sediment}} surface with increasing irradiance. Net photosynthesis showed a compensation irradiance of 4. 5 mumol photons m(- 2) s(- 1) and a net photosynthetic capacity (P-max) of 85 O- 2 mmol m(- 2) d(- 1). No photoinhibition was observed at the maximum irradiance of 140 mumol photons m(- 2) s(- 1). Total exchange rates Of 02 and DIC mirrored each other and confirmed the depth distribution of benthic diatoms and the microsensors measurements. The compensation irradiance for the integrated benthic community (including macrofauna) decreased with water depth to a minimum of 12 mumol photons m(- 2) s(- 1) at 30 m water depth. The mean O- 2 /DIC exchange ratio across the <b>benthic</b> <b>interface</b> was approximately 1. 2 and was independent of water depth. Extrapolation of our productivity data to the outer fjord system by accounting for the in situ light regime showed that the primary production of the benthic diatoms was equivalent to that of benthic macroalgae. Benthic net photosynthesis was almost 7 times higher than the gross photosynthetic rates of the pelagic community for water depths < 30 m. However, integrated for the entire outer Young Sound, benthic net photosynthesis only accounted for similar to 70 % of the pelagic production as measured by the C- 14 -incubation technique...|$|E

Throughout the expedition, a suite of foraminiferal analyses were employed wherein planktic specimens revealed biostratigraphy, and an incredibly diverse benthic fauna (~ 260 species) was used to reveal palaeo- water depth, palaeobathymetric settings and variable conditions at the sediment-water <b>interface.</b> <b>Benthic</b> foraminiferal biofacies are particularly sensitive to changes in environmental conditions, have a rapid turnover and are ideal proxies for monitoring physical and chemical changes in marine environments. When this information is combined with lithostratigraphic and other microfossil data, a robust understanding of past environments can be reconstructed. Stretching from the Northern Carnarvon Basin up to the Roebuck Basin, several distinct biofacies were isolated at sites U 1461 -U 1464 that reveal an array of marine settings and events that span from the Miocene to the Pleistocene. These features include water depths ranging from shallow reefs (Larger Benthic Foraminifera) to bathyal depths (~ 1000 m), the appearance of key indicator species for both the Leeuwin Current and the West Pacific Warm Pool, and episodes of downslope sediment transport. Here we present the main isolated biofacies, their associated lithofacies and their implications for reconstructing fluctuating sea-level, thermohaline circulation and sediment transport in a changing marine landscape...|$|R
40|$|Artículo de publicación ISIDissolved oxygen (DO) {{consumption}} in the sediments of natural aquatic ecosystems occurs by mass flux across the water-sediment interface. This mass flux is determined as either the rate of oxygen {{consumption in}} the sediment or the rate of DO diffusion across the diffusive sublayer. The thickness of the diffusive sublayer {{is determined by the}} flow conditions in the turbulent water column. Consequently, feedback occurs between the biochemical consumption that occurs in the sediment and the flow that occurs in the water column. Together, these conditions define the DO flux across the water-sediment <b>interface.</b> <b>Benthic</b> chambers have been used to measure this flux in field and experimental conditions. However, these measurements do not account either {{for the fact that the}} flow inside a benthic chamber is not representative of field conditions or for the DO {{consumption in the}} water column. Thus, they can provide an inaccurate estimation of the sediment DO demanded in the field. This article aims to present and discuss an approach for analyzing a time series of DO depletion inside a benthic chamber. Based on this approach, the processes related to turbulent water transport in the column are separated from the processes that characterize biochemical consumption in the sediments and the water column. Under these conditions, the parameters related to biochemical consumption in the sediments can be used to compute the expected DO demanded of the sediments in field conditions. Sediment samples from a lagoon near the Universidad de Chile campus in Santiago, the capital city of Chile, were used to illustrate the application of the proposed method. In addition, dimensionless numbers were used to define the method's validity and limitations. Iniciacion Fondecyt 	 11100306 project Fondecyt Regular 	 114082...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{incorporates}} {{the results of}} studies into the distributions of the Cumacea whose members {{are one of the}} groups of animals living in shallow water sands off eastern Tasmania. My approach assumes that patterns of animal distribution exist. This may be regarded as an expression of belief. However, as MacArthur (1927) has pointed out most investigations of biological distributions reveal pattern at some scale. The approach is supported also by the work of Taylor, Woiwod and Perry (1978) who suggested that spatial randomness is highly improbable because the behavioural responses of living organisms mediate dispersive processes. 1. 1 Layout The text of this account is divided into two main sections. The first deals with the zoogeography of shallow water cumaceans in eastern Tasmania. The second section contains an account of cumacean spatial distribution at the <b>benthic</b> <b>interface</b> and, briefly, the place of these animals in the water column. 1. 2 Timing This project commenced in March, 1977. The formal cut-off point for literature survey was June, 1979. All literature quoted after that date results from browsing or the intermission of friendly gatekeepers. 1. 3 Statement of Intent During a period of eleven years as a working naturalist in Tasmania the geographic distribution of the Tasmanian marine fauna has been of interest. The concept of the Maugean marine province (Iredale and May, 1916) proved a useful working hypothesis if only because it provided a framework upon which to hang observed distributions. This descriptive approach was emphasized in a paper upon Tasmanian littoral biogeography (Dartnall, 1974). Other work which is referred to later in this text suggested that marine animal distributions along the east coast of Tasmania were interrupted by a discontinuity at the approximate latitude of Maria Is. (c. 42 o 31 'S). Vernacular evidence from other working zoologists offered nothing to refute this view. It was with some surprise, therefore, to read the work of King (1972) and to discover that the distribution of littoral algae did not support the concept of a Maugean marine province. Both King and myself have suggested that marine biogeographic regions should reflect oceanographic conditions and that investigation of Maugean distributions might continue profitably offshore. This thesis is the result of that suggestion. The pathways followed during this work are summarized in a flow diagram following the conclusions. Logical pathways are direct but labyrinthine logic plots its own web. The actual routes followed are indicated...|$|E
40|$|Stocks of {{the eastern}} oyster, Crassostrea virginica, have been declining in Chesapeake Bay since the late 19 th century, and current {{strategies}} involve restoring culture of Crassostrea virginica on-bottom and in devices suspended within the water column. Sub-tidal suspension culture of Crassostrea virginica in Chesapeake Bay occurs mostly in sheltered inlets and tidal creeks and, thereby, {{has the potential to}} influence shallow water biogeochemical processes. To assess the influence of Crassostrea virginica biodeposits and benthic microalgae on sediment nitrogen and phosphorus exchange, field studies with Crassostrea virginica held in aquaculture floats and laboratory experiments were conducted. Enhanced organic nitrogen deposition from Crassostrea virginica biodeposits led to gradual increases in surface sediment nitrogen and pore water ammonium concentrations; however, modifications to pore water concentrations were not always expressed at the sediment-water <b>interface.</b> <b>Benthic</b> microalgae often modulated the influence of biodeposits on sediment nitrogen exchange but, as observed in laboratory experiments, the supply of nitrogen from Crassostrea virginica biodeposits may exceed their biological demand. Organic carbon from biodeposits had varying influences on aerobic respiration but consistently stimulated anaerobic metabolism. Shifts in net phosphorus exchange were driven by this anaerobic remineralization and concentrations of iron and manganese oxy(hydr) oxides, with transitions in fluxes coinciding with changes in benthic photosynthesis and oxidation of surface sediments. Manganese and iron oxy(hydr) oxides from biodeposits supported incorporation of added phosphorus and prevented exchange at the sediment-water interface in the absence of iron-sulfide mineral formation. Differences in the response of shallow water sediments to Crassostrea virginica biodeposits were due to {{the quality and quantity of}} biodeposits supplied, as well as the spatial and temporal variability within these sediments. Initial conditions and corresponding reference sediments illustrated the potential for sediment biogeochemistry and nutrient exchange from tidal creek sediments to vary spatially and temporally on relatively small scales. Factors influencing variability within tidal creek sediments were related to shifts in riverine freshwater inputs, macroalgal blooms, nutrient concentrations in overlying waters, and bioirrigation from the clam, Macoma balthica...|$|R
40|$|The Avon-Heathcote is a small, microtidal, {{predominantly}} intertidal, weather-dominated estuary. It {{has experienced}} large alterations to its physical environment {{as a result}} of the establishment and growth of the adjacent Christchurch City, on what was previously a swampy, dune-bordered coastal plain. During the period 1850 - 1920 the tidal compartment decreased by 30 %, then returned rapidly to its original volume. It has since increased to about 30 % more than its pre-European volume. The inlet area progressively changed its configuration to accommodate these alterations in volume. An analysis of the energetics of waves and tidal currents shows that wave-induced shear stresses predominate in this estuary, particularly above the MTL, and are only exceeded by tidal current stresses in and adjacent to subtidal channels, where tidal velocities exceed 60 cm/s. Because of depth limitations the largest waves in this estuary normally have periods of 1. 4 s, amplitudes of 30 cm and lengths of 3. 5 m. Wave energy gradients are due to downfetch variations in wave frequency, not variations in wave size. The muddiest sediment occurs close to the entrances of the Avon and Heathcote rivers, and patterns of mud deposition are regulated both by rates of sediment supply and by wave energy. The sand fraction of active surface sediment can be divided into two groups – one consisting of a single population deposited solely from saltation, the other consisting of a mixture of this saltation population, and material deposited from suspension. Sand is only deposited from suspension near the two river entrances, or on intertidal flats below the MTL, where wave shear stresses are less than 2 dynes/cm² Shallow cores reveal that a record of the history of this estuary is preserved in its subsurface sediment. An abiologic, pre-estuarine/estuarine pre-European/estuarine post-European sequence is recognised beneath a 15 - 20 cm deep bioturbation interface. Above this <b>interface</b> <b>benthic</b> animals have produced a homogeneous mixed layer, depleted of suspendible fines, which is overlain by a thin and commonly quite different active layer. The active layer exists independently of trends in net erosion or deposition of sediment...|$|R
40|$|The early Eocene is {{characterized}} by long-term global warming culminating in the Early Eocene Climatic Optimum (EECO). During this time interval, of which previously only the PETM was intensively studied, the Peri-Tethys was characterized by its position between north-south and east-west trending seaways. The Aktulagay section in Kazakhstan provides an expanded record of the middle Ypresian (NP 11 - 13, ~ 54 - 50 Ma), covering {{the lower part of}} the EECO. It features a series of sapropel beds, observed throughout the Peri-Tethys. In order to unravel paleoenvironmental changes, we carried out quantitative faunal studies and isotopic investigations on excellently preserved foraminiferal assemblages. The period from 54 to 52 Ma {{is characterized}} by a diverse assemblage of deep outer neritic benthic foraminifera, with common Pulsiphonina prima and Paralabamina lunata. Coupled negative carbon and oxygen isotope excursions point to hyperthermals occurring during this time interval, but these are not evident from the faunal or sedimentological record. The initially (54 Ma) well-ventilated oligo- to mesotrophic sea floor conditions gradually change to more eutrophic and oxygen-limited. This gradual onset culminates in permanent stratification in the sapropel-bearing unit around 52 Ma, with the dominance of Anomalinoides acutus and Bulimina aksuatica. The absence of ostracods and abundance of hematitic concretions are consistent with this interpretation. Rising δ 13 Cendobenthic indicate migration of endobenthic species to the sediment-water <b>interface.</b> <b>Benthic</b> foraminiferal assemblages dominated by Epistominella minuta at ~ 51 - 50 Ma indicate a highly seasonal food supply and episodic disruption of stratification. Dinoflagellate blooms and Acarinina isotope values at 20. 25 m indicate lower salinity (lower δ 18 O) and higher productivity (higher δ 13 C), possibly due to riverine input. This coincides with the peak of the EECO, as indicated by its position close to the base of NP 13 and rising δ 13 Cforam values. Although it is tempting to link the observed patterns to climate change, we can currently not exclude that changing paleogeography and variable connections to the Tethys, Atlantic and the Arctic ocean largely determined the long-term period of dysoxia and anoxia during deposition of the sapropel beds at the Peri-Tethyan seafloor. These rapid, small biofacies shifts observed in the Aktulagay section may reflect a stepwise transition in long-term re-shaping of benthic foraminiferal communities. status: publishe...|$|R
