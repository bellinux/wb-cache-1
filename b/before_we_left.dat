He left {{his wife and}} child behind him in Khotan, Liu Darin making himself answerable for their maintenance. But I also paid Fong Shi three months' salary in advance, and that money he gave to his wife. Whenever I could find leisure he was to give me lessons in Chinese, and we began at once, even <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>left</b> Khotan...........|$|E
500|$|... "Empire State of Mind" [...] {{was created}} by singer-songwriter-producer Angela Hunte, a native of Brooklyn, along with writing partner Jane't [...] "Jnay" [...] Sewell-Ulepic. Hunte {{grew up in the}} same {{building}} where rapper and hip hop artist Jay-Z lived—560 State Street, an address which is mentioned in the song. The track's creation was inspired during an overseas trip Hunte and Sewell-Ulepic made to London in February 2009 when they were both feeling homesick. Hunte was ill during that summer, while Sewell-Ulepic's mother was ill. Hunte recalls, [...] "We said to ourselves, 'we complain so much about New York—about the busy streets, about the crowds and the pushing, about the subway system—but I would trade that for anything right now.' <b>Before</b> <b>we</b> <b>left</b> the hotel that night, we knew we would write a song about our city." [...] Although they wrote the song as a simple way to voice their feelings for their hometown, they sent it to the Roc Nation music label the following month in hope that Jay-Z would like it and record it. When they received negative reviews about the track they were convinced it would never be recorded. However, in the summer of the same year, EMI Music Publishing's (EMI) Jon [...] "Big Jon" [...] Platt heard the track at a barbecue {{and fell in love with}} it, believing that [...] "it would be perfect for Jay-Z".|$|E
2500|$|Landing a {{recording}} deal in 1991, the group released their debut album Forever My Lady that same year. Writer Ronin Ro maintained, “They no longer resembled gospel singers… Puffy also {{asked them to}} build their mystique by posing for photos with {{their backs to the}} camera, which he borrowed from Guy’s stage show.” The album’s seductive energy showcased DeVante’s songwriting, establishing a uniqueness in his production that mixed old-fashioned soul singing with New Jack Swing, creating a production of great boldness. It featured the number 1 R singles [...] "Forever My Lady," [...] "Stay," [...] and [...] "Come and Talk to Me." [...] Mr. Dalvin recalls how the album Forever My Lady was created, “The last version of the album that was released only took us a week to finish because we had already written the songs. It was about getting our sounds right because the vocals were already done. It was us going back in the studio recreating the beats and the melodies... Most of the songs were written <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>left</b> North Carolina. My brother was 16 and I was 14 when we wrote the songs..." [...] The album went on to sell over three million copies.|$|E
6000|$|My friend came in {{the other}} day, <b>before</b> <b>we</b> had <b>left</b> town, and looked round at the {{appointments}} of the room in their summer shrouds, and said, with a faint sigh, [...] "I see you have had the eternal-womanly with you, too." ...|$|R

"The charge {{must have}} torn a great {{hole in the}} ship's bottom, for I {{could see she was}} {{settling}} down in the water <b>before</b> <b>we</b> had <b>left</b> her five minutes, and in {{a quarter of an hour}} she gave a sudden lurch and sank. As I was in for it now, I knew the best thing was to put a good face on it, so I lent a hand at shifting the cargo and did my best to seem contented. We sailed off in company, and in the morning when I came on deck I found the two craft riding side by side in a land locked harbor.|$|R

We {{have been}} {{carrying}} out the work which you, as a wise and skilful commander, should have ordered <b>before</b> you <b>left.</b> <b>We</b> {{have taken advantage of}} the confusion of the enemy by the fire in their camp, and have made a sortie, and a successful one, as you see." ...|$|R
60|$|Jan. 1st, 1857.-This {{has been}} a day of {{thorough}} enjoyment. I have wandered in the forests of an island rarely seen by Europeans. <b>Before</b> daybreak <b>we</b> <b>left</b> our anchorage, and in an hour reached the village of Har, where we were to stay three or four days. The range of hills here receded so as to form a small bay, and they were broken up into peaks and hummocks with intervening flats and hollows. A broad beach of the whitest sand lined the inner part of the bay, backed by a mass of cocoa-nut palms, among which the huts were concealed, and surmounted by a dense and varied growth of timber. Canoes and boats of various sizes were drawn {{up on the beach}} and one or two idlers, with a few children and a dog, gazed at our prau as we came to an anchor.|$|R
60|$|The norther {{presently}} {{changed to}} the rainy south-wester, the builder of the Moroccan 'bars' and {{the scourge of}} the coast fringing North-west Africa, Rolling set in with the usual liveliness. Events were not eventful. The first midnight found us off Cape Trafalgar, and the second off St. Vincent. At 4 P.M. (December 12), we saw the light of Espíchel (Promóntorium Barbaricum), the last that shines upon the voyager bound Brazilwards. <b>Before</b> nightfall <b>we</b> had <b>left</b> Buzio lighthouse to starboard. We then ran up the northern passage {{in charge of a}} lagging pilot; and, as the lamps were lighting, we found ourselves comfortably berthed off that pretty toy, Belem Tower.|$|R

60|$|It {{was nearly}} midnight <b>before</b> <b>we</b> found an {{opportunity}} {{of going to}} bed, and even then <b>we</b> <b>left</b> Mrs. Jellyby among her papers drinking coffee and Miss Jellyby biting the feather of her pen.|$|R
60|$|Still, {{she did not}} please Ragnar, who {{whispered to}} me that she was sly and would bring {{mischief}} on all {{that had to do with}} her. I, who at the time was about twenty-one years of age, wondered if he had gone mad to talk thus of this beautiful creature. Then I remembered that just <b>before</b> <b>we</b> had <b>left</b> home I had caught Ragnar kissing the daughter of one of our thralls behind the shed in which the calves were kept. She was a brown girl, very well made, as her rough robe, fastened beneath her breast with a strap, showed plainly, and she had big dark eyes with a sleepy look in them. Also, I never saw anyone kiss quite so hard as she did; Ragnar himself was outpassed. I think that is why even the great lady, Iduna the Fair, did not please him. All the while he was thinking of the brown-eyed girl in the russet robe. Still, it is true that, brown-eyed girl or no, he read Iduna aright.|$|R
60|$|There was {{a church}} on one side, {{and on the}} other was a large stone house, the outline of which {{seemed to me to be}} familiar. I looked around me in the twilight, and then I saw that we had been led back to Dobrova, and that this house at the door of which we were waiting was the same house of the priest at which we had stopped in the morning. Here it was that my charming Sophie in her innocence had {{translated}} the unlucky message which had in some strange way led us to our ruin. To think that only a few hours <b>before</b> <b>we</b> had <b>left</b> this very spot with such high hopes and all fair prospects for our mission, and now the remnants of us waited as beaten and humiliated men for whatever lot a brutal enemy might ordain! But such is the fate of the soldier, my friends--kisses to-day, blows to-morrow. Tokay in a palace, ditch-water in a hovel, furs or rags, a full purse or an empty pocket, ever swaying from the best to the worst, with only his courage and his honour unchanging.|$|R

6000|$|... "As to the {{learning}} of which you speak, my lamb," [...] said the Moolah, in answer to some argument of Fardet's, [...] "I have myself studied at the University of El Azhar at Cairo, and I know that to which you allude. But {{the learning}} of the faithful is not as the learning of the unbeliever, {{and it is not}} fitting that we pry too deeply into the ways of Allah. Some stars have tails, O my sweet lamb, and some have not; but what does it profit us to know which are which? For God made them all, and they are very safe in His hands. Therefore, my friend, be not puffed up by the foolish learning of the West, and understand {{that there is only one}} wisdom, which consists in following the will of Allah as His chosen prophet has laid it down for us in this book. And now, my lambs, I see that you are ready to come into Islam, and it is time, for that bugle tells that we are about to march, and it was the order of the excellent Emir Abderrahman that your choice should be taken, one way or the other, <b>before</b> ever <b>we</b> <b>left</b> the wells." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{have a long}} voyage yet," [...] he said. [...] "We {{have not}} gone {{much more than a}} third of the {{circumference}} of the world and, <b>before</b> <b>we</b> reach England, strange things may happen yet. <b>We</b> <b>left</b> Plymouth with a noble fleet of six ships. Now there remains but one, and fifty-eight men. At the same rate we shall be reduced to a cock boat, and four men, <b>before</b> <b>we</b> reach England. So keep up your heart, there is plenty of time before us." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{never heard}} who the poor soul was, or why he took {{himself out of}} the world, if he really did so, or if he ever was in it; but I am sure that my passion for Pope, and my purpose of writing pastorals, must have been {{powerful}} indeed to carry me through dangers of that kind. I suspect that the strongest proof of their existence was the gloomy and ruinous look of the house, {{which was one of the}} oldest in the village, and the only one that was for rent there. We went into it because we must, and we were to leave it as soon as we could find a better. But <b>before</b> this happened <b>we</b> <b>left</b> Ashtabula, and I parted with one of the few possibilities I have enjoyed of seeing a ghost on his own ground, as it were.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I saw, you know, {{that night}} at Tishy's, just <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>left</b> England, your {{wonderful}} start. I {{got a look at}} your attitude, as it were, and your system." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Something that {{happened}} the day <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>left</b> Venice. You saw the Countess, {{during the last}} hours of her life. Won't you tell me whether she made any confession to you?' ...|$|E

6000|$|After two hours’ slow marching up the Fiumara eastwards, we saw {{in front}} of us a wall of rock; and, turning {{abruptly}} southwards, <b>we</b> <b>left</b> the bed, and ascended rising ground. Already it was night; an hour, however, elapsed <b>before</b> <b>we</b> saw, at a distance, the twinkling fires, and heard the watch-cries of our camp. It was ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, sir, I'm {{sure they}} have not passed since we got here. But they may {{possibly}} have seen the fog coming on and have ridden rapidly back, and passed <b>before</b> <b>we</b> came down, or they may have gone round by {{the mouth of the}} valley parallel to this, which <b>we</b> <b>left</b> to cross into this one." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's a pity <b>we</b> <b>left</b> {{so quick}} {{or they might}} have been married <b>before</b> <b>we</b> started. She's a good girl, Ephraim, and he is a fine man, for all that their ways {{are not the same as}} ours. They don't seem to take life so hard as we, and maybe they get more {{pleasure}} out of it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's what I don't know. You see, I didn't buy it new, but {{traded for}} her <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>left</b> home. It {{seems to me}} {{she ought to be}} a bargain at--at--ten dollars." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'The {{young fellow}} has begun well,' said Mick, with a scowl. 'You had better ride off, young sir, before {{the police are}} up. They had wind of the {{business}} <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>left</b> Kilwangan.' ...|$|E

You know <b>we</b> <b>left</b> a good eight hours <b>before</b> <b>we</b> were {{expected}} to leave, otherwise {{she would have been}} in time to lie in wait for us {{on the other side of}} the Cape, and"--he snapped his teeth like a wolf close to my face--"and she would have had us like--that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have few}} fears, {{with you and}} uncle Chainbearer so near me, Mordaunt," [...] was her smiling answer, [...] "It cannot be long <b>before</b> <b>we</b> hear from Frank, who is gone, as {{you must have been}} told, to Ravensnest, for {{authority}} and assistance. He left our huts at the same time <b>we</b> <b>left</b> them to come here, and must be on his return long before this." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>Before</b> <b>we</b> {{sat down}} to table I looked forth from an upstairs window. The day was {{beginning}} to decline; the links were utterly deserted; the despatch-box still lay untouched where <b>we</b> had <b>left</b> it hours before.|$|R
