Archaea such as Methanococcus also contain the A1Ao synthase, a form of the enzyme that contains additional proteins with little similarity in sequence to other bacterial and eukaryotic ATP synthase subunits. It is possible that, in some species, the A1Ao form of the enzyme is a specialized sodium-driven ATP synthase, but this might not <b>be</b> <b>true</b> <b>in</b> all cases.|$|E
5|$|As Prime Minister from 14 January 1991 to 22 August 1991 Pavlov {{initiated}} the 1991 Soviet monetary reform, {{commonly referred to}} as the Pavlov reform, in early 1991. Early on he told the media that the reform was initiated to halt the flow of Soviet roubles transported to the Soviet Union from abroad. Although ridiculed at the time, the statement was later proven to <b>be</b> <b>true.</b> <b>In</b> June the same year, Pavlov called for a transfer of power from the President of the Soviet Union to the Prime Minister and the Cabinet of Ministers. When that failed, he joined a plot to oust Gorbachev. In August, he participated in the 1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt, which tried to prevent the disintegration of the Soviet Union. Pavlov was arrested for his involvement in the coup and went on to work in the banking sector in post-Soviet Russia. He was succeeded as premier by Ivan Silayev.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the Culver Line extension, the BRT's fare was cut from 10 cents to 5 cents, and Coney Island became a much more {{affordable}} vacation area compared to in previous years. In 1923, these lines came {{under the control of the}} Brooklyn–Manhattan Transit Corporation (BMT), the BRT's successor company. Riders at the new station were promised trains that ran every three minutes during rush hours, but this quickly proved not to <b>be</b> <b>true.</b> <b>In</b> 1923, a reporter for the Brooklyn Standard Union observed that rush hour trains had headways of eight minutes on the Sea Beach Line and fifteen minutes on the West End Line, and that no direct Manhattan service was being run on either the Brighton or Culver Lines during rush hours.|$|E

5|$|An {{intelligence}} official told Seymour Hersh in 2015 that no fire-fight took place. In the earlier versions, Al-Kuwaiti {{is said to}} have opened fire on the first team of SEALs with an AK-47 from behind the guesthouse door, lightly injuring a SEAL with bullet fragments. A short firefight took place between al-Kuwaiti and the SEALs, in which al-Kuwaiti was killed. His wife Mariam was allegedly shot and wounded in the right shoulder. The courier's male relative Abrar was then said to have been shot and killed by the SEALs' second team {{on the first floor of}} the main house as shots had already been fired and the SEALs thought that he was armed with a loaded AK-47 (this was later confirmed to <b>be</b> <b>true</b> <b>in</b> the official report). A woman near him, later identified as Abrar's wife Bushra, was in this version also shot and killed. Bin Laden's young adult son {{is said to have}} encountered the SEALs on the staircase of the main house, and to have been shot and killed by the second team. An unnamed U.S. senior defense official stated that only one of the five people killed, Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti, was armed. The interior of the house was pitch dark, because CIA operatives had cut the power to the neighborhood. However, the SEALs wore night vision goggles.|$|E
5|$|Pain was {{too young}} to serve King William Rufus, but {{according}} to the later 12th-century writings of Walter Map he may have been a chamberlain—one of the officials in charge of the royal household—for William's brother, King Henry I (reigned 1100–1135). There is no contemporary evidence for Pain having held that office and nor is it likely, given Map's story, that Pain was involved with Henry's financial affairs; rather it appears that if indeed he was a chamberlain, he was a body servant. Map relates a story about Pain serving the king personally at night, providing Henry with wine if the king called for it. The story continues that Pain once drank the wine and was caught out by Henry when the king subsequently demanded his nightcap. Map finishes the story by saying that the king then ordered that Pain should be given wine every night while awaiting the king's pleasure. Although the story is unlikely to <b>be</b> <b>true</b> <b>in</b> all details, it suggests that Pain's service to the king was personal as well as judicial and governmental. Other evidence against Map's claim that Pain was a chamberlain is that he never attested a royal charter in that office.|$|E

However, the other female partner may perform chores that are considered masculine, like outside work and employment outside of the home. The partners’ behaviors do not support gender roles because all the roles performed are done by women.
