Feeling that his knowledge in fields such as physics, mathematics, chemistry, and biology was lacking, he continued attending classes at the University as a part-time student. In 1936 he traveled to England to begin advanced studies at the University of Cambridge, {{under the supervision of}} another Nobel Prize winner, Sir Frederick Gowland Hopkins, who had obtained that distinction in 1929 for his work in physiology and in revealing the critical role of vitamins in maintaining good health. Leloir's research in the <b>Biochemical</b> <b>Laboratory</b> of Cambridge centered around enzymes, more specifically the effects of cyanide and pyrophosphate on succinic dehydrogenase; from this moment Leloir began to specialize in researching carbohydrate metabolism.|$|E
500|$|Following a tip, Dunham and Scott {{are sent}} to a storage {{facility}} where they uncover a <b>biochemical</b> <b>laboratory,</b> which explodes when detonated by a suspect they are chasing. Scott {{is affected by the}} chemicals released in the explosion, and is placed into an artificial coma to slow the progression of the chemical reaction. While investigating a possible cure to Scott's condition, Dunham blackmails Peter Bishop (Jackson) to gain access to his father Dr. Walter Bishop (John Noble), whose top-secret work at Harvard in [...] "fringe science" [...] resulted in him being sent to a mental institution. Dunham manages to release Walter from the institution; however, he becomes enraged when he discovers his laboratory in Harvard has been shut down. Broyles reopens the laboratory, where Dunham transfers Scott's body. To identify the man from the storage facility, Walter synchronizes Dunham's brainwaves with the comatose Scott's so that she can read his mind. Walter claims that syncing brainwaves, and even reanimating the dead, can be accomplished up to six hours after death. With the help of Dunham's assistant, federal agent Astrid Farnsworth (Jasika Nicole), the experiment succeeds. Dunham identifies the man in Scott's memory, Morgan Steig, as a passenger on the plane. The team learns Steig's twin brother, Richard Steig, was an employee of Massive Dynamic, a company founded by William Bell, Walter's old lab partner.|$|E

50|$|After his doctorate, Abel worked {{mostly in}} {{clinical}} studies and took clinical courses, focusing on biochemistry and pharmacology. He traveled around Europe, mostly in Germany and central Europe, conducting research in biochemistry. During this time, Abel {{had a number}} of mentors that inspired his work and exposed him to a number of disciplines that eventually prompted him to work in biochemistry and pharmacology. Starting in 1884, Abel worked with doctors Ludwig von Frey in physiology and histology, Rudolf Boehm in pharmacology, Adolph Strümpell in pathology, and Johannes Wislicenus in organic and inorganic chemistry. All of this work was done in Leipzig until 1886, until Abel moved on to Strassburg, where he again worked in various fields: internal medicine with Adolph Kussmaul, and Friedrich Daniel von Recklinghausen in infectious disease and pathology. Eventually, Abel moved back to Strassburg where he worked more with Oswald Schmiedeberg among others. Schmeidberg, however, sparked his interest in pharmacological research.

40|$|Digital {{microfluidic}} biochips {{are small}} devices promising to replace {{much of the}} equipment found in <b>biochemical</b> <b>laboratories</b> today. A digital biochip is composed of a two-dimensional array of electrodes. A small drop of liquid (a droplet) can occupy one electrode. The droplets can be manipulated on the biochip using a technique called electrowetting-on-dielectric. Any biochemical application (or bioassay), can be captured {{as a series of}} basic microfluidic operations performed using the droplets on a digital biochip. The bioassays are modeled using a directed graph, where each node is an oper-ation. Apart from the operations themselves, the graph indicates the order in which they must be executed for the bioassay to be successful. Such a graph is called an application graph. In order for a digital microfluidic biochip to execute the application graph of a bioassay the graph must be synthesized into a schedule for the biochip microcontroller. The schedule tells the biochip when and where to move th...|$|R
40|$|Microfluidic biochips are an {{alternative}} to conventional <b>biochemical</b> <b>laboratories,</b> {{and are able to}} integrate on-chip all the necessary functions for biochemical analysis. The “digital ” biochips are manipulating liquids not as a continuous flow, but as discrete droplets on a two-dimensional array of electrodes. The main objective of this thesis is to develop top-down synthesis techniques for digital microfluidic biochips. So far, researchers have assumed that opera-tions are executing on virtual modules of rectangular shape, formed by grouping adjacent electrodes, and which have a fixed placement on the microfluidic array. However, operations can actually execute by routing the droplets on any se-quence of electrodes on the biochip. Thus, we have proposed a routing-based model of operation execution, and we have developed several associated synthe-sis approaches, which progressively relax the assumption that operations execute inside fixed rectangular modules. The proposed synthesis approaches consider that i) modules can dynamically move during their execution and ii) can have non-rectangular shapes. iii) W...|$|R
40|$|Microfluidic biochips {{integrate}} different biochemical analysis functionalities on-chip {{and offer}} several advantages over the conventional <b>biochemical</b> <b>laboratories.</b> In this thesis, {{we focus on}} the flow-based biochips. The basic building block of such a chip is a valve which can be fabricated at very high densities, e. g., 1 million valves per cm 2. By combining these valves, more complex units such as mixers, switches, multiplexers can be built up and the technology is therefore referred to as microfluidic Very Large Scale Integration (mVLSI). The manufacturing technology for the mVLSI biochips has advanced faster than Moore’s law. However, the design methodologies are still manual and bottom-up. Designers use drawing tools, e. g., AutoCAD, to manually design the chip. In order to run the experiments, applications are manually mapped onto the valves of the chips (analogous to exposure of gate-level details in electronic integrated circuits). Since mVLSI chips can easily have thousands of valves, the manual process can be very time-consuming, error-prone and result in inefficient designs and mappings...|$|R
