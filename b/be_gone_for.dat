5|$|As {{with earlier}} campaigns, {{recruiting}} enough men was a problem. Jefferson {{called for the}} western counties of Virginia to provide militia manpower for Clark's campaign, but county officials protested {{that they could not}} spare the men. Militiamen did not want to set out on a lengthy expedition—they would <b>be</b> <b>gone</b> <b>for</b> six months to a year—while their families and homes were threatened by Lord Cornwallis's army in the east, by Indian raids from the north, and by Loyalists at home. Because of this resistance, Jefferson called for volunteers rather than ordering the militia to accompany the expedition.|$|E
5|$|Bligh {{had landed}} in England on 14 March 1790 to public acclaim, and was quickly {{promoted}} to post-captain. In the following months {{he wrote his}} account of the mutiny, and on 22 October was honourably acquitted at court martial of responsibility for the Bounty's loss. Early in 1791 he was appointed to command a new breadfruit expedition, which left London on 3 August of that year, before any news of the capture of Heywood and the others had reached London. Bligh would <b>be</b> <b>gone</b> <b>for</b> more than two years, and would thus be absent from the court martial proceedings that awaited the returned mutineers.|$|E

25|$|Thus, in {{statements}} made by Swedish politicians, the Swedish sentiments against the Russian government have always been about fear of military invasion, which now seemed to <b>be</b> <b>gone</b> <b>for</b> the foreseeable future, and also about human rights and democracy issues. Only 31% of Swedes stated that they liked Russia in 2011, and 23% in 2012, and only 10% have confidence in Russian elections.|$|E
500|$|The {{couple were}} {{separated}} {{for long periods}} at a time, as Dash recalled that Aaliyah continuously shot films and would <b>be</b> <b>gone</b> <b>for</b> months often to come back shortly and continue her schedule. Dash was also committed to [...] "his own thing", which did not make matters any better. Despite this, they were understanding that {{the time they had}} together was special. Dash remembered they would [...] "be {{in a room full of}} people talking to each other and it felt like everyone was listening but it would be just us. It would be like we were the only ones in the room". Dash always felt their time together was essential and Aaliyah was the person he was interested in being with, which is why, as he claimed, they had begun speaking about engagement. The relationship was mentioned in the lyrics of Jay-Z's remix to her song [...] "Miss You", released after her death.|$|E
500|$|The Beagle however, would <b>be</b> <b>gone</b> <b>for</b> {{several years}} and was {{required}} to take chronometers ashore and in boat expeditions up rivers to determine the coordinates of specific reference points as instructed by the Admiralty. [...] It could not be guaranteed that any one chronometer would continue to function accurately, or even survive the journey at all. [...] Each chronometer was mounted on gimbals to keep it level in all sea conditions, and the whole assembly fixed inside a hinged wooden box for protection. [...] For additional protection, they were stored in sawdust in a special cabin in the Captain's quarters. [...] Only crew who needed to take measurements, or who maintained them, were allowed access, measures which indicate the importance attached to these instruments. [...] The Beagle voyage succeeded, for the first time, in establishing a linked chain of reference points around the globe of known longitude {{which could be used}} by subsequent voyages to calibrate their own chronometers.|$|E

500|$|Dave Golder of SFX {{also gave}} [...] "The God Complex" [...] {{three and a}} half out of five stars, {{questioning}} some logical aspects but noting that it was [...] "extremely witty, {{particularly when it comes to}} David Walliams's cowardly moleman Gibbis". He also did not believe Amy and Rory would <b>be</b> <b>gone</b> <b>for</b> long, especially as the Doctor had placed them in more perilous situations before. IGN's Matt Risely rated the episode 7 out of 10, calling it [...] "a notably wonky episode, both in terms of tone and plot development" [...] that came off as [...] "a confused, slightly ill-fitting hodgepodge of a tale". [...] While he praised Hurran's directing and the performances of Walliams and Karan, he felt the characters were sidelined near the end. Risely noted that [...] "things certainly chugged along with a witty, sparkling vibrancy at least early on", but the tone [...] "lost its way halfway through" [...] culminating in a [...] "hollow and rushed" [...] final scene where he left Amy and Rory.|$|E
500|$|On 19 September, with Karluk ice-bound {{and largely}} stationary, Stefansson {{announced}} that {{in view of}} the shortage of fresh meat and the likelihood of a long sojourn in the ice, he would lead a small hunting party that would search for caribou and other game {{in the area of the}} Colville River. He would take with him the two Inuit [...] "Jimmy" [...] and [...] "Jerry", the expedition secretary Burt McConnell, the photographer George Wilkins, and the anthropologist Diamond Jenness. Stefansson expected to <b>be</b> <b>gone</b> <b>for</b> about ten days; Bartlett was instructed by letter that, if the ship should move from its present position, he should [...] "send a party ashore, to erect one or more beacons giving information of the ship's whereabouts." [...] The next day the six men departed. On 23 September, following a blizzard, the ice floe in which Karluk was trapped began to move, and soon the ship was travelling at between [...] a day—but to the west, steadily further from Herschel Island and from Stefansson's party who, it soon became clear, would not be able to find their way back to the ship.|$|E

2500|$|A {{significant}} revision to the EEG {{came into}} effect on 1August 2014. [...] The prescribed feed-in tariffs will soon <b>be</b> <b>gone</b> <b>for</b> most technologies.

[...] Plant operators will market their production directly and will receive a market premium {{to make up the difference}} between the their bid price and the average monthly spot market price for electricity. [...] The EEG surcharge remains in place to cover this shortfall. [...] This new system is being rolled out in stages, starting with ground-mounted photovoltaics. [...] More legislative revisions are scheduled for introduction on 1January 2017.|$|E
