5000|$|Planned obsolescence, or <b>built-in</b> <b>obsolescence,</b> in {{industrial}} design and economics {{is a policy}} of planning or designing a product with an artificially limited useful life, so it will become obsolete (that is, unfashionable or no longer functional) after {{a certain period of}} time. The rationale behind the strategy is to generate long-term sales volume by reducing the time between repeat purchases (referred to as [...] "shortening the replacement cycle").|$|E
5000|$|Design life {{is related}} to but {{distinct}} from the concept of <b>built-in</b> <b>obsolescence.</b> The latter is the somewhat more nebulous notion that products are designed so as to become obsolete - {{at least in the}} eyes of the user - before the end of their design life. Two classic examples here are digital cameras, which become genuinely obsolete as a result of the very rapid rate of technological advances, although still in perfect working order; and non-digital cameras, which are perceived as obsolete after a year or so as they are no longer [...] "the latest design" [...] although actually capable of years of useful service.|$|E
5000|$|The European Union is also {{beginning}} {{to address this}} problem. The European Economic and Social Committee (EESC), an advisory body of the EU, announced in 2013 that it was studying [...] "a total ban on planned obsolescence". It said replacing products {{that are designed to}} stop working within two or three years of their purchase was a waste of energy and resources and generated pollution. The EESC organised a round table in Madrid in 2014 on 'Best practices in the domain of <b>built-in</b> <b>obsolescence</b> and collaborative consumption' which called for sustainable consumption to be enshrined as a consumer right in EU legislation. Carlos Trias Pinto, president of the EESC's Consultative Commission on Industrial Change supports [...] "the introduction of a labeling system which indicates the durability of a device, so the consumer has the possibility of choosing whether he/she prefers to buy a cheap product or a more expensive, more durable product".|$|E
5000|$|The {{inherent}} mechanical {{weak spot}} {{of the front}} loader design is the cantilevered mounting of the inner drum within the outer tub. The drum bearing has to support the entire weight of the drum, the laundry, and the dynamic loads created by the sloshing {{of the water and}} of the imbalance of the load during the spin cycle. The drum bearing eventually wears out, and usually requires extensive dismantling of the machine to replace, which often results in the machine being written off due to the failure of a relatively inexpensive component that is labor-intensive to renew. Some manufacturers have compounded this problem by [...] "overmolding" [...] the drum bearing into the outer tub to reduce manufacturing costs, but this makes the bearing impossible to renew without replacing the entire outer tub - which usually forces owners to scrap the entire machine - this may be viewed as an implementation of <b>built-in</b> <b>obsolescence.</b>|$|E
50|$|Perhaps {{the most}} perplexing repairs facing a home-owner are broken or damaged things. In today's era of <b>built-in</b> <b>obsolescence</b> for many products, {{it is often}} more {{convenient}} to replace something rather than attempt to repair it. A repairman is faced with the tasks of accurately identifying the problem, then finding the materials, supplies, tools and skills necessary to sufficiently effect the repair. Some things, such as broken windows, appliances or furniture can be carried to a repair shop, {{but there are many}} repairs that can be performed easily enough, such as patching holes in plaster and drywall, cleaning stains, repairing cracked windows and their screens, or replacing a broken electrical switch or outlet. Other repairs may have some urgency, such as a broken water pipes, broken doors, latches or windows, or a leaky roof or water tank, and this factor can certainly justify calling for professional help. A home handyman may become adept at dealing with such immediate repairs, to avoid further damage or loss, until a professional can be summoned.|$|E
5000|$|The {{business}} model of fast fashion {{is based on}} consumers’ desire for new clothing to wear. In order to fulfill consumer’s demand, fast fashion brands provide affordable prices and {{a wide range of}} clothing that reflects the latest trends. This ends up persuading consumers to buy more items which leads to the issue of overconsumption.Planned Obsolescence {{plays a key role in}} overconsumption. Based on the study of planned obsolescence in the Economist, Fashion is deeply committed to <b>built-in</b> <b>obsolescence.</b> Last year's skirts; for example, are designed to be replaced by this year's new models. In this case, fashion goods are purchased even when the old ones are still wearable. The quick response model and new supply chain practices of fast fashion even accelerate the speed of it. In recent years, the fashion cycle has steadily decreased as fast fashion retailers sell clothing that is expected to be disposed of after being worn only a few times. [...] This dramatically shortens the consumers’ buying cycle. The quick changing stocks and low price of fashion goods encourage consumers to visit the store and make purchases more frequently. As a result, excessive stock and untrendy clothes tends to end up in landfills.|$|E
50|$|The KT26 {{remained}} unchanged for decades while competitor brands changed their designs, materials and constructions and used <b>built-in</b> <b>obsolescence</b> and short {{product life cycle}} marketing. This enabled the KT26 to establish a consumer following but it also become dated {{in the minds of}} many retailers. Dunlop Footwear's marketing of the KT26 resulted in it becoming dependent on a few major discount department store retailers (DDS) of KMART, Target, Big W etc for retail of the KT26 at a time when the Internet dramatically eroded all retail stores' share of footwear sales and many footwear chains and shops closed. At the same time the DDS retailers were also producing and retailing their own 'home brand' sports shoes. To remain viable in the DDS market space, Dunlop Footwear's primary focus was cost reduction with no brand or promotional activities. Cost pressures saw the production of the KT26 moved offshore to China in the late 1990s and moved between Chinese factories for the next decade to find the cheapest per unit production price. As a result, the quality of the KT26 suffered and the famed fit / last shape varied depending on the factory at the time. Product returns and customer complaints accelerated the KT26's demise and during 2011, all major DDS retailers had dropped or were in the process of dropping the KT26 form their footwear offerings.|$|E

Energy used in the manufacture, employment and recycling of devices belongs to a system where waste is not merely accidental but integral to the operation of cognitive capitalism. Oil and gas, uranium and hydroelectricity all prey disproportionately on indigenous peoples, who are turned into economic externalities along with their lands.

In this paper, ‘sufficiency’ is proposed as a driver of business model innovation for sustainability. Sufficiency-driven business models seek to moderate overall resource consumption by curbing demand through education and consumer engagement, making products that last longer and avoiding <b>built-in</b> <b>obsolescence,</b> focusing on satisfying ‘needs’ rather than promoting ‘wants’ and fast-fashion, conscious sales and marketing techniques, new revenue models, or innovative technology solutions. This paper uses a case study approach to investigate how companies might use sufficiency as a driver for innovation and asserts {{that there can be}} a good business case for sufficiency. Business models of exemplar cases are analysed and insights are gained that will contribute to future research, policy makers and businesses interested in exploring sufficiency...|$|E

This research seeks to investigate and verify, by using a formal literature review methodology, the most visible aspects of technological development, within the Industry 4. 0 and IoT scenario, {{in relation to the}} theories of the so called “Planned Obsolescence”. This study covers a defined number of works on Design theories and practices on how to face the issue of <b>built-in</b> <b>obsolescence</b> of devices in the era of the Connected Devices.

40|$|The {{research}} {{focus is}} the collection, appropriation and re-purpose of ephemera and urban detritus as a contemporary visual art strategy. The technological/industrialized {{cultures of the}} 21 st century, which are predicated on <b>built-in</b> <b>obsolescence</b> and disposability, {{have led to a}} proliferation of urban detritus that has become operative in a range of cultural practices. The study examines why contemporary artists appropriate discarded materials and how the material is utilized in their practice. In particular the research determines the degree to which studio location, chance, and nuances of prevailing material culture influence the content and format of contemporary practice. To this end the study examines and contextualizes the strategies and methodologies inherent in my practice and those of relevant contemporary precedents who re-assign waste materials as a strategy to critique material culture and systems of value. Integral to this research is the exhibition I curated, Regimes of Value that included the works of twenty-eight contemporary Melbourne artists who strategically re-purpose discarded material. I identify the ‘collage’ processes of collection and codification, as methodologies implicit in my practice and that of a significant number of contemporary artists...|$|E
40|$|Waste is {{intrinsic}} to the fashion system. Fashion {{is predicated on}} <b>built-in</b> <b>obsolescence,</b> and as such outmoded garments are rapidly discarded to charity shops or landfill. However, the story of fashion {{is also one of}} abundance and extravagance in design ideas. Every season there are new design details – prints, embroidery, embellishments, shapes and textures. This excess of ideas is in itself another form of waste, albeit one that is culturally nourishing. The grave of a fashion garment may also be the grave of a season’s research and creativity. This paper compares the tangible waste of the industry with its intangible waste, namely fashion’s creativity and cultural excess. Fashion’s excess and abundance of trends and ideas makes any move to curb the environmental impact difficult. For all practitioners of fashion – whether designers or consumers – the waste and excess inherent in the fashion system is a difficult ethical terrain to negotiate. However, inverting the wasteful phases of the production cycle can help reframe waste from pollution to a source of nourishment for future practice. While creative excesses of designers may be ‘wasted’ after a season, fashion styles and tropes are recycled and reinvented, with the once passé styles and design ideas from previous years revalorized and returned into the fashion system. Similarly, material garments acquire new value through entering or re-entering the second hand or vintage markets. Design processes can utilise pre or post-consumer textile waste, or eliminate waste through design. In these processes, waste becomes the primary source of nourishment for future fashion cycles...|$|E
40|$|If {{targets to}} reduce {{greenhouse}} gas emissions and thereby tackle climate change are to be achieved, {{it will be necessary}} to reduce both embodied energy costs (e. g. in terms of producing and manufacturing the products and services that society consumes) and operational energy costs. Reducing the number of purchases that people regret could be a first step in changing the overall dynamic of consumption patterns. This research looks at some potentially adverse effects of consumption on well-being (e. g. negative emotions), applying social practice theory to give insights into why people make purchases that they feel negatively about. This paper draws from: (i) findings of a national survey of over 2000 respondents which found that 53 % of adults had reported regretting purchasing an electrical device at some point, and that 23 % regretted making such a purchase within the past year; and (ii) a series of walking interviews around people's homes that provide detailed insights into the nature and extent of regretted purchases of electrical goods (e. g. resentment at <b>built-in</b> <b>obsolescence,</b> frustration at the pace of technological change). By combining the qualitative and quantitative data, we develop a typology of regretted consumption and explore the underlying factors that lead to such purchases. The paper concludes with a discussion of the policy implications of this research. The research presented in this paper combines data collected as part of two projects. The Whole Systems Energy monitoring project was funded by the EPSRC (EP/K 039326 / 1) and the ‘Out of Sight, Out of Mind: The problem of invisibility for environmental policy’ was funded by the British Academy (SG 142500) ...|$|E
40|$|The study {{set out to}} {{understand}} and demonstrate the role the ICT sector could play as a critical enabler in the transition and progress towards an energy– efficient, low carbon economy. More specifically, the study of sustaining ICT for sustainability has twofold intent: (2) to investigate the direct footprint of ICT sector and explore {{how it can be}} tackled through adopting sustainable design–based solutions; and (2) to highlight the enabling potential of ICT sector to mitigate climate change and massively improve energy efficiency across the economy, identifying and quantifying the global ICT impacts and opportunities in the context of energy and carbon emissions savings. To achieve the aim of this study, a pertinent and extensive literature review covering theoretical, empirical, and critical scholarship was performed to investigate the phenomenon. The study draws on a variety of sources to survey the unsustainability of ICT sector pertaining to energy–intensive consumption and explore potential solutions through espousing environmental design practice, and also to examine the role of ICT in delivering energy–efficient solutions through its products and services. Validity was ensured through using quality academic and industry literature as well as relevant studies carried out by a range of eminent researchers, experts, and stakeholders (i. e. NGOs, research centers). Findings highlight the unsustainability of ICT sector regarding energy– intensive consumption and concomitant GHG emissions associated with its products and services. Of the whole lifecycle, the use phase of ICT is the most critical. Data centers and telecom networks devour energy. Planned obsolescence entrenched in software design shorten upgrade cycle, which makes software utilities a planet killer as to energy consumption. Alternative sustainable design–based solutions entail using renewable energy and most efficient energy required over ICT’s life cycle – de–carbonization strategy. Also, digitization is an effective strategy for ICT sector to slash energy use per unit. To reduce the footprint of data centers and telecom networks, design solutions vary from hardware and software to technological improvements. Designing out <b>built–in</b> <b>obsolescence</b> in software technology is a key factor in the energy equation. As for the enabling role of ICT, the findings are highly illuminating. The ICT sector must step up its efforts in reducing its direct footprint in order to claim a leadership role in an energy–efficient, low carbon economy. Although the ICT sector’s own emissions will increase because of global growing demand for its products and services, the real gains will come from its enabling potential to yield substantial energy efficiency improvements and emissions reductions across the economy. The sheer scale of the climate change challenge presents smart development mitigation opportunities for ICT sector to deliver environmentally sustainable solutions. The largest identified opportunities are: dematerialization; intelligent transport and logistics; intelligent buildings; smart power supply; and efficient industrial processes and systems. This study provides a novel approach into sustainable design in ICT, underlining unsustainable design practices in ICT sector. Review of the literature makes an advance on extant reviews by highlighting the synergic relationship between ICT design, sustainability, and the economy. + 46 704 35 21 3...|$|E
40|$|Cheap and {{efficient}} communication aids development. Urban centres have {{grown out of}} people's {{need to be able}} to communicate with each other. From this congregation and communication spring self-perpetuating economic activity and development. Rural areas have been left behind, but with better telecommunications and wider access to modern electronic information technology they will have a chance to catch up. Imagine a world-wide road network. The 'roads' have fast-moving traffic, safely carrying important 'packages' to their destination. Business is flourishing. Raw materials are ordered on time, manufacturing and service industries run efficiently and manufactured goods and other products are priced competitively and delivered to satisfied customers around the world. Every single individual, whether a farmer living at the end of a track (which disappears in the rainy season), or the sales manager of a big commercial enterprise close to the international airport, could be linked to this network. That, at least, is the theory but, in practice, it seems that there is a big diversion sign around many of the ACP States. If the diversion signs were removed, what impact would that have on rural development? The 'road network' is the internet and the fast-moving traffic are packets of information data. The major advantage of the internet over other means of communication is that people can 'speak' to each other, no matter who they are or how far apart they may be. Their communication is cheap, quick and two-way, unlike radio, TV and print, and the quantity and variety of information that can be instantly transferred is staggering. When two people speak by telephone, a part of the telephone system is entirely dedicated to the call, which means that when many people want to use the telephone system at the same time its capacity is quickly exhausted and no line is available. When two people use the same lines to communicate by internet, the information is broken down into small packets of data which then flow like a stream of traffic across the network. The packets of data, which get mixed up with everyone else's data, are routed through junctions. Even though a single communication may be broken into separate data packets which follow separate routes, the receiver gets the complete, reconstituted message. As long as senders and receivers have a computer, modem, appropriate software, a telephone line, and an understanding of how to use the equipment, they can exchange information. However, users also need to know how to make good use of all that the internet can offer. The internet offers access to information. The type of information required will obviously depend on the user. A farmers' cooperative may want to know what price could be obtained for their crops if they were exported rather than sold in the nearest market town. They may want to know what transport will be available to move the goods, how much that would cost and whether, therefore, the venture would be profitable. In any business transaction, the better informed the seller, the better the chance of a fair price. A fruit grower may want technical advice to help judge the perfect time for harvesting the crop (see box). Agricultural researchers may need information which relates to their work and which they know will be available only from a major university on the other side of the world. University students returning from higher degree studies overseas may need to maintain contact with their tutors or supervisors in order to complete research work or, indeed, the university professors may wish to learn from their ex-students. The internet also provides access to distance learning, through which formal qualifications can be obtained by pursuing home study courses backed up by materials and tutoring accessed via the internet. Surf or sink The internet should be thought of as the infrastructure for communication; by using that infrastructure in different ways, various services can be obtained. The most well-known are the World Wide Web, e-mail and usenet or news (see box). The World Wide Web is the main service to use to undertake a search for information yourself. E-mail is used to contact an information provider directly, rather like a telephone call or fax which is addressed to a specific person or organization. Usenet is rather like a notice board that anyone, anywhere, can look at and to which anyone can pin their own notice. It is a way of asking questions and receiving answers from people who are interested in the same subject. This would be similar to CTA's Question-and-Answer Service but anyone could read both questions and answers and make their own contribution. Many individuals can gain the benefit of such a service if the organization that has access to the internet then distributes the information to those who have not by means of printed information sheets or even via local radio. The value of information depends on the relevance, and therefore the value, of the question to which it is attempting to respond. If the question has been correctly addressed, a response is little more than a mechanical process, which is why computers are so good at it. If you post a question into an inappropriate usenet discussion group, for example, you could wait for ever for a sensible answer. Asking the right question, therefore, actually requires more skill, understanding and intelligence than supplying the answer. For example, the secretary of a farmers' organization may be asked by the members to find out about applying fertilizer to the season's crop of maize. The answer could come back as, 'N 50 kg/ha, P 25 kg P 2 O 5 /ha, K 50 kg K 2 O/ha', when in fact the information actually required is, 'Three weeks' time, 100 shillings a bag'. Computers are very good at supplying answers but very bad at guessing questions. In an attempt to find the question, the World Wide Web, for example, will provide so many answers, or so many options for finding answers, that the task may become so tedious that it is abandoned. With access to a telephone line, which is, in any case, necessary in order to access the internet, the secretary would have been better advised to telephone the local agricultural store and ask when the fertilizer will be in and what it will cost. As with any other form of communication it is important to know how to define what information you need and how to communicate that need. Then comes the problem of knowing how to use the information received. The better the first two tasks are done, the easier is the third. Precise, accurate and free of bias? Another point which is related to the importance of being precise when seeking information is the need for that information to be accurate. In this respect the internet has both advantages and disadvantages. On the one hand it allows the user to access information from many different places, some of which may be a great distance apart; this could permit a degree of comparison and potentially a lack of bias. On the other hand, all information has, at some stage or another, been made available through the activity of a human being and human beings wittingly, or unwittingly, often give inaccurate information. There may be a temptation to feel that because information has come via a medium of sophisticated modern technology, it must be valid. A conversation on the internet may be as informal as a conversation with a stranger in a bar or at the bus stop. Who would place great confidence in such a casual exchange of information? This is not to say that such information should be mistrusted, but that it should be subject to the same level of scrutiny and judgment as any other information source. It should be remembered that in addition to its undoubted advantages for accessing information that is worthwhile or even essential, the World Wide Web provides commercial suppliers, not all of them totally honest, with a wonderful, world-wide shop window. The same level of judgment needs to be applied to these suppliers' beguiling advertisements on the internet. There are disturbing stories, for example, of unscrupulous operators selling spurious AIDS cures via the internet. Inducements to buy additional computer software or more sophisticated hardware in order to use the internet ever more efficiently are likely to be more tempting. A cynical observer might suggest that these products have <b>built-in</b> <b>obsolescence,</b> for this is how the service providers make their money. Nevertheless, new products are constantly becoming available and to be able to identify a potential crop pest from the scanned image of its wing sent from a remote location in Africa to a London-based institution may be deemed a very cost-effective piece of technology. Cost before benefit Apart from the potential benefits and drawbacks of using the internet, there are technical challenges which, until now, have limited its use in many ACP States and which largely remain to be overcome. The most significant of these is the telephone system. Many ACP States have inadequate, obsolete telephone systems that cannot satisfy the demands of social communication, let alone commercial development. Although radio or satellite links can overcome shortcomings in land-based telephone systems, these also require investment and any commercial investor or service provider will need to be confident of a return on their investment. This confidence is in part dependent on economic and political stability. Furthermore, a population that needs basic education and better health care is unlikely to press for a better telecommunications network, even though the opportunity of being able to communicate cheaply {{and efficient}}ly may be the most effective means of stimulating economic development which may, in turn, provide the best hope of acquiring better health care and education. In addition to telephone access, users of electronic information technology must be able to purchase suitable computers, modem equipment and software. The setting up and use of these will almost certainly require, at least in the early stages, back-up services from the suppliers and training. The equipment must be robust enough to withstand less than ideal climatic conditions and must be housed in a reasonably dust-free, dry atmosphere. Security for any portable, expensive equipment is always a problem as is ensuring that the equipment is used only by those who know how to operate it properly and who will pass on its benefits to others. There will be an initial investment required in equipment and an ongoing cost in telephone charges and subscription costs to the service providers who provide access to the internet. Most organizations find that by using e-mail instead of the telephone they reduce the cost per call. This is especially the case if international telephone calls can be replaced by e-mail, which usually requires only a local call to the service provider. However, the tendency is for the volume of communication to grow and, while this is desirable if it indicates that a previously unsatisfied demand for communication links is now being met, it also has a cost implication. The internet and the electronic information services to which it gives access have already shown phenomenal growth rates and have brought prosperity and economic development to users and providers alike. The ACP States should not be left behind. Some are already on-line and the chance is there for others to catch up. The internet, like information itself, should be available for all who need it, but it could be that many of the ACP States will be left further and further behind in a world that is accelerating fast along the world's information superhighways.
