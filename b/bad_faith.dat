5|$|A partial ouster or {{time limit}} clause {{specifies}} a restricted period, after which no remedy will be available. Such clauses are generally effective, unless the public authority has acted in <b>bad</b> <b>faith.</b> Similarly, {{the existence of}} <b>bad</b> <b>faith</b> entitles applicants to challenge decisions of authorities despite the existence of statutory provisions declaring such decisions to be conclusive evidence of certain facts. In the absence of <b>bad</b> <b>faith,</b> the courts will enforce conclusive evidence clauses.|$|E

After a Left government came to power in May 1996, a vigilance case was registered against Karunakaran and six others on 21 March 1997. Following an inquiry, a charge sheet was submitted to the Court of the Inquiry Commissioner and Special Judge, Trivandrum, on 23 March 2001. The case dragged on, with Karunakaran filing writ petitions and appeals before the Kerala High Court and the Supreme Court of India, raising the plea of <b>bad</b> <b>faiths</b> (mala fides) and eventually obtaining a stay order from the Supreme Court of India in August 2007. The appeal remained pending before the Supreme Court of India until Karunakaran's death in December 2010.|$|R

5|$|Early in 1954, the U.S. Army accused McCarthy and {{his chief}} counsel, Roy Cohn, of {{improperly}} pressuring the Army to give favorable treatment to G.

McCarthy claimed that the accusation was made in <b>bad</b> <b>faith,</b> in retaliation for his questioning of Zwicker the previous year. The Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, usually chaired by McCarthy himself, was given the task of adjudicating these conflicting charges. Republican Senator Karl Mundt was appointed to chair the committee, and the Army–McCarthy hearings convened on April 22, 1954.|$|E
5|$|Following Jones' rejection, Garrard vetoed a {{bill that}} would have allowed the {{legislature}} to select the state's presidential and vice-presidential electors; despite the fact that the law ran contrary to the state constitution, Garrard's veto further strained his relations with the Senate. After the Senate rejected nominee William Trigg, the state's newspapers openly talked of an executive-legislative feud and claimed the Senate had its own favorite candidate for the position and would not accept anyone else. When the Senate rejected Willis Green in January 1804, Garrard declared that he would make no more nominations for the position. Accusations of <b>bad</b> <b>faith</b> were exchanged between the governor and the Senate, after which Garrard nominated John Adair, the popular Speaker of the House. The Senate finally confirmed this choice.|$|E
5|$|In Tan Liang Joo John, Justice Judith Prakash {{stated that}} this was not a closed list, and that the court is {{entitled}} to take into account all the circumstances of the case which in its view go towards showing <b>bad</b> <b>faith.</b> She also noted that English authorities impose another limit on the content of criticism – that the acts or words in question must neither impute improper motives to nor impugn the integrity, propriety and impartiality of judges or the courts. However, she declined to follow these authorities and averred that to impose such a limit would be unnecessary and potentially over-restrictive of legitimate criticism.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{considered}} the biblical motifs engendered in the up-to-date fiction pieces by the famous British science fiction writer C. S. Lewis. The paper explored a fiction piece {{with the title}} the Space Trilogy that contained spiritual motifs, being the medium for the novelist in uncovering the basics of spiritual life for the reader. The issues of faith, immortality, good, of the Divine Light and Providence being the main topics developed by the author in the fiction piece. The novelist by drawing up the fancy parallels demonstrated the essential aspects of human life on Earth, with the whole story filled with allegories referring to the biblical stories. Creation of the phantasmal world (for the purpose of explaining for people profundity of Christian values and showing their relevance)  appears to be inconceivable by itself. The reader  unintentionally immerse {{at the heart of}} a fascinating story created by Lewis. C. S. Lewis has brilliantly explained to his reader, what the morale is, what good and <b>bad</b> are, and <b>faith,</b> and humanist attitude, etc. One could hardly overestimate the value of the Lewis‟ oeuvre for the arts.  His fiction pieces are obviously up-to-date. It is important that his oeuvre still draw attention after all these years since his death, and even the young fellow researchers reserve for his oeuvre the top of the temple of fame in fiction. </p...|$|R

5|$|In cases falling {{under the}} second sub-heading, a public {{authority}} has satisfied all the factual and legal conditions required for exercising a statutory power conferred upon it, but nevertheless may have acted illegally {{by doing so}} in a manner contrary to administrative law rules. The grounds of review available under this heading include the authority acting in <b>bad</b> <b>faith,</b> acting {{on the basis of}} no evidence or insufficient evidence, making an error of material fact, failing to take into account relevant considerations or taking into account irrelevant ones, acting for an improper purpose, fettering one's discretion, and not fulfilling a person's substantive legitimate expectations.|$|E
5|$|The Court {{held that}} it can judicially review the {{exercise}} of prosecutorial power and declare a prosecution to be unconstitutional for breach of constitutional power, for example, if a prosecution is brought in <b>bad</b> <b>faith</b> for an ulterior motive and not to punish an accused person for an offence he or she committed. A prosecution {{can also be found}} to have infringed the accused person's constitutional rights. This may happen if law enforcement officers themselves commit crimes by using agents provocateur in a particularly egregious manner to entrap accused persons into committing crimes, and the Attorney-General elects to prosecute only the accused persons but not the officers, as this may infringe the accused persons' right to equality guaranteed by Article 12(1) of the Constitution.|$|E
5|$|Tarla Makaeff, {{who paid}} nearly $60,000 to Trump University in 2008, brought {{a class action}} lawsuit against Trump University on April 30, 2010, in U.S. District Court for Southern California.

5000|$|After {{about two}} months, Marriott left {{the group to}} pursue other endeavors and the {{remaining}} members pressed forward as a power trio. Meyer and Bates wrote a number of songs together {{over the course of}} the next two years including [...] "War is Here" [...] and [...] "Don't Take the Car You'll Kill Yourself". After the punk club Cuckoo's Nest (nightclub) closed down, there were limited clubs for the band to play in the Orange County area. Not too long after the closure of the Cuckoo's Nest, the club reopened as [...] "The Concert Factory" [...] and it was there that Uniform Choice played most of their early shows in late 1982. Bates played guitar and sang lead vocals in the beginning until the group landed on lead singer Elliott Colla, a former classmate of Meyer and Hanna's from Corona Del Mar High School. The band experimented with other singers before Colla. Newport Beach local Eric Whittick sang for a short while. And later in the tradition of X-Ray Spex, 14-year-old Jennifer Harper fronted the band for a short time along with second guitar player Eric [...] "Arab" [...] Groff (Love Canal). The band made its first studio demo in September 1982 (Orange Peel Sessions) with Colla heading up vocals. The recordings were engineered and produced by Tom Springston (Tom Tom) of Burnt Party Host and were recorded in Corona Del Mar, California. In 1983 the band experimented with an additional second lead bass player, Brent Turner. Turner only played several shows with the band and left the group to record the album When in Rome Do as the Vandals with The Vandals. Over the course of the first two years the group performed with other established punk acts such as Black Flag, SIN 34, Circle Jerks, Channel 3, Shattered <b>Faith,</b> <b>Bad</b> Religion, Circle One and Angry Samoans.|$|R
5|$|Derek Fisher succeeded Ewing as NBPA {{president}} in 2006. In early 2011, negotiations {{on a new}} CBA began. The league claimed that it was losing $300 million a year (22 out of 30 teams were losing money last season) and proposed to reduce 40% of players' salary (about $800 million) and institute a hard salary cap (at $45 million per team) {{as opposed to a}} soft cap (at $58 million) currently in use. The union disputed those figures and steadfastly opposed those changes. Hunter said that he was advising players to prepare for a lockout. In May 2011, the NBPA {{filed a complaint with the}} National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), accusing the league of negotiating in <b>bad</b> <b>faith</b> by failing to provide critical financial data to the union and repeatedly threatening to lock out players. The NBA quickly rejected the complaint, saying that the league complies fully with federal labor laws. The union also considered the option of decertification, which allows players to file an antitrust lawsuit against the NBA.|$|E
5|$|King William {{appears to}} have left the {{initiative}} for Stigand's deposition to the papacy, and did nothing to hinder Stigand's authority until the papal legates arrived in England to depose the archbishop and reform the English Church. Besides witnessing charters and consecrating Remigius, Stigand {{appears to have}} been a member of the royal council, and able to move freely about the country. But after the arrival of the legates, William did nothing to protect Stigand from deposition, and the archbishop later accused the king of acting with <b>bad</b> <b>faith.</b> Stigand may even have been surprised that the legates wished him deposed. It was probably the death of Ealdred in 1069 that moved the pope to send the legates, as that left only one archbishop in England; and he was not considered legitimate and unable to consecrate bishops. The historian George Garnett draws the parallel between the treatment of King Harold in Domesday Book, where he is essentially ignored as king, and Stigand's treatment after his deposition, where his time as archbishop is as much as possible treated as not occurring.|$|E
5|$|The {{subject-matter}} of {{a dispute}} must be justiciable before the High Court {{will hear the}} case. A decision by an executive authority will generally be considered non-justiciable if the decision requires the intricate balancing of various competing policy considerations, and judges are ill-equipped to decide the case because of their limited training, experience and access to materials; if a judicial pronouncement could embarrass another branch of government or tie its hands {{in the conduct of}} affairs traditionally falling within its purview; or if the decision involves the exercise of a prerogative power that the democratically elected branches are entrusted to take care of. Nonetheless, a dispute may prima facie involve a non-justiciable area but the courts may decide that there is a justiciable matter within it, or the courts may be able to isolate a pure question of law from what is seemingly a non-justiciable issue. Because of the principle that all powers have legal limits, the Attorney-General's exercise of prosecutorial discretion and the power to pardon or grant clemency to convicted persons exercised by the President on the Cabinet's advice are both justiciable in exceptional cases, for instance, where the powers have been exercised unconstitutionally or in <b>bad</b> <b>faith.</b>|$|E
