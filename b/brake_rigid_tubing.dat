40|$|SUMMARY We {{studied the}} effects of preload on {{transmural}} myocardial perfusion and coronary pressure-flow relationships in mongrel dogs. The left circumflex (LC) artery was cannulated and perfused through an external circuit of <b>rigid</b> <b>tubing</b> originating in the left subclavian artery and containing an electromagnetic flowmeter (EMF), a solenoid, and a short segment of soft tubing which could be occluded. The solenoid, triggered by the R-wave of the ECG, was adjusted so that perfusion occurred only during diastole. Autoregulation was abolished by maximal vasodilation with carbocro-men. In 16 dogs, overall radioactive microsphere flow in the perfused LC segment was 1. 67 ± 0. 17 (SKM) ml/min per g at normal preload and 1. 54 ± 0. 19 ml/min per g at elevated preload. The endocardial: epicardial flow ratio decreased from 0. 76 ± 0. 03 at normal preload to 0. 55 ± 0. 04 at elevated preload (P < 0. 01). EMF pressure-flow curves, determined by stepwise constriction of the perfusion circuit in the same dogs, showed a rightward shift with increased preload {{and an increase in}} PZF, the pressure at which inflow became zero (12 ± 0. 9 nun Hg at normal preload vs. 19 ± 1. 0 mm Hg at elevated preload, P < 0. 01).

In an attempt to shed some light into this issue, a novel artificial hydraulic model has been developed to empirically simulate fluid dynamics of the human conventional outflow pathway. Using non-biological materials, this model comprised of critical elements of the human aqueous outflow tract that include a microsyringe pump (simulating aqueous inflow/outflow), 35 -gauge needle (stimulating trabecular meshwork), one way valve (simulating Schlemm’s canal inner wall endothelia) and a distal fluid column (simulating episcleral venous pressure) interconnected in between by pressure transducers and <b>rigid</b> <b>tubings.</b> The model was able to replicate various components of the conventional outflow pathway under physiological and pathological conditions.

The present bachelor thesis describes the development of the motion control system for the REPA test rig. To provide {{a better understanding of the}} context a brief overview of CSP, PTC and REPA technologies is given. Subsequently, know-ing the requirements, the design of the test rig is presented. In the main part of the thesis the arrangement of the motion control, its integration in the Supervisory Control and Data Acqui-sition (SCADA) system, as well as the chosen hardware is discussed. Further on, the pro-grammed functions and the specifications of the motion control system are described. The development process led to a system enabling the test rig to reproduce a translational mo-tion in a 45 ° range and a rotational motion between - 120 ° and + 90 °. Whereby these motions are produced using cylinders, which are controlled by a hydraulic unit. To control the speed of the motion and enable the execution of 0. 25 ° steps in the rotation axis a Variable Speed Drive (VFD) and a servo motor with servo controller are driving two separated hydraulic pumps. The motion functions, implemented on a SIMATIC S 7 - 300 Programmable Logic Controller (PLC), enable the above described motions as well as a positioning at position set points. The correct function of the developed system is not yet verified. A discussion of the influence of the PLC cycle time and a comparison with an existing PTC system is carried out.

50|$|Hard line {{is used in}} {{broadcasting}} {{as well as many}} other forms of radio communication. It is a coaxial cable constructed using round copper, silver or gold tubing or a combination of such metals as a shield. Some lower-quality hard line may use aluminum shielding, aluminum however is easily oxidized and unlike silver oxide, aluminum oxide drastically loses effective conductivity. Therefore, all connections must be air and water tight. The center conductor may consist of solid copper, or copper-plated aluminum. Since skin effect is an issue with RF, copper plating provides sufficient surface for an effective conductor. Most varieties of hardline used for external chassis or when exposed to the elements have a PVC jacket; however, some internal applications may omit the insulation jacket. Hard line can be very thick, typically at least a half inch or 13 mm and up to several times that, and has low loss even at high power. These large-scale hard lines are almost always used in the connection between a transmitter on the ground and the antenna or aerial on a tower. Hard line may also be known by trademarked names such as Heliax (CommScope), or Cablewave (RFS/Cablewave). Larger varieties of hardline may have a center conductor that is constructed from either rigid or corrugated copper tubing. The dielectric in hard line may consist of polyethylene foam, air, or a pressurized gas such as nitrogen or desiccated air (dried air). In gas-charged lines, hard plastics such as nylon are used as spacers to separate the inner and outer conductors. The addition of these gases into the dielectric space reduces moisture contamination, provides a stable dielectric constant, and provides a reduced risk of internal arcing. Gas-filled hardlines are usually used on high-power RF transmitters such as television or radio broadcasting, military transmitters, and high-power amateur radio applications but may also be used on some critical lower-power applications such as those in the microwave bands. However, in the microwave region, waveguide is more often used than hard line for transmitter-to-antenna, or antenna-to-receiver applications. The various shields used in hardline also differ; some forms use <b>rigid</b> <b>tubing,</b> or pipe, others may use a corrugated tubing, which makes bending easier, as well as reduces kinking when the cable is bent to conform. Smaller varieties of hard line may be used internally in some high-frequency applications, in particular in equipment within the microwave range, to reduce interference between stages of the device.|$|R

40|$|Continuous {{multidisciplinary}} advancements in medicine, {{science and}} engineering {{have led to the}} rise of biomedical microfluidic devices for clinical diagnoses, laboratory research for modeling and screening of drugs or disease states, and implantable organs such as artificial kidneys. Blood is often the biological fluid of choice for these purposes. However, unique hemodynamic properties observed only in microscale channels complicate experimental repeatability and reliability. For vessels with 10 - 300 µm diameters, red blood cell properties such as deformability {{have a significant impact on}} hemorheology, and the blood can no longer be considered as a homogeneous fluid. The flowing blood segregates into a red blood cell rich core bounded by a cell-free layer composed almost entirely of plasma. Viscous forces dominate flow behavior, and shear rates at the wall are much higher than in arteries and veins. The overall viscosity becomes dependent on vessel diameter. These unique characteristics are interesting from a biophysics perspective, but the value of biomedical microfluidic technologies makes research in this regime even more critical. Accordingly, this work focuses on experimental comparison of the microfluidic flow properties of red blood cells with varying physical characteristics. Blood viscosity in microscale tubes was investigated experimentally for 6 blood types (goat, sheep, pig, llama, chicken and turkey) at a range of hematocrits (0 - 50 %). The selected blood types represented a small sample of the wide-ranging red blood cell characteristics found in mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians and fish. These red blood cells vary in size over an order of magnitude, represent shapes ranging from biconcave to ellipsoidal, and include both nucleated cell types found in birds, amphibians and reptiles and denucleated mammalian cells. Pressure drop experiments at physiologically relevant flow rates were carried out for <b>rigid</b> <b>tubing</b> diameters ranging from 73 µm - 161 µm. The resulting viscosities were normalized relative to the measurements made of the homologous plasma for each species. The viscosity of blood in this regime is much different than in larger vessels (> 500 µm) or in small capillaries (< 10 µm), but existing studies in this size range focus only on human blood. The results analyzed in the context of four primary variables: hematocrit, red blood cell size, red blood cell shape, and red blood cell deformability. The aggregation of the porcine blood complicated the data collection process, resulting in only a few usable data points. Examination of the role of hematocrit yielded results which aligned well with existing hemorheology research: viscosity increases with hematocrit. After applying an existing fitting equation the collected data, three primary trends were observed. First, the chicken blood had the highest viscosity at every hematocrit regardless of tubing diameter. Secondly, the viscosities of the goat and sheep blood were very similar at all hematocrits, and ultimately had the lowest viscosity of all samples at the highest measured hematocrit values. Finally, the turkey and llama blood generally had the lowest viscosity at low hematocrit, with a deflection point around 30 % hematocrit where viscosity began to increase much more sharply. The role of cell size was considered in the context of both mean cell volume and major cell axis relative to vessel diameter, to account for the elongated shape of the llama, chicken and turkey red blood cells. The results indicated that cell major axis is better correlated with viscosity than cell volume, suggesting the potential importance of cell shape. The red blood cells were then characterized as either oblate or prolate to further investigate the importance of shape. The results further supported the idea that overall blood viscosity in small vessels depends on both cell size and shape. However, as with the hematocrit analysis, the chicken blood was an outlier. The chicken red blood cells are quite similar to turkey red blood cells in both size and shape, yet the chicken blood was consistently far more viscous than turkey blood. A comparison with theoretical rigid particles suggested that the chicken red blood cells may be the least deformable of the sampled blood types. Two additional experiments were performed to assess the potential importance of deformability. Additional pressure drop measurements with chemically-hardened red blood cells demonstrated that the measurement system is quite sensitive to changes in cell deformability. Flow visualization in a microfluidic contraction indicated that the high viscosity of the chicken blood relative to the turkey blood could be attributed to differences in deformability. Blood viscosity is influenced by multiple cell characteristics, including size, shape and deformability. The role of these parameters is worthy of further investigation alongside ongoing research in the rheology of human blood. The impact of red blood cell deformability on viscosity in small vessels is particularly interesting. The described experimental apparatus is easily replicable and highly customizable, and may serve as a helpful tool to analyze blood parameters in biomedical microfluidic device research and development. The collected data sets are available to interested researchers, and can currently be obtained by direct request. Ultimately, an online database will be made available via the Liepmann lab website...|$|R

The instrument configuration resulting from NAG 54929 has remained basically intact. Cosine response measurements conducted by James Slusser s group at Fort Collins, Colorado, in support of the proposal for Aura ground validation mentioned in the final report for NAG 5 - 8929, indicated that there was significant light leakage to the detector through the sides of the nylon housing.

40|$|To {{minimize}} the injury of car occupants during a frontal crash {{not only the}} restraint system must be optimized, but also the crash pulse generated by the vehicle structure. It is clear that a low velocity crash with full overlap requires less structure stiffness than a high velocity offset crash. Ideally for each serious crash situation the whole available deformation length must be used and all the impact energy must be absorbed without deforming the passenger compartment. For compatibility {{it is necessary to}} have a stiffer structure in case of a heavy opponent and a softer structure in case of a lighter opponent. This paper discusses possibilities to design an adaptive vehicle structure that can change the stiffness real time for optimal energy absorption in different crash situations. Besides that all the energy is absorbed {{it is also important to}} manage the intensity during the crash time, because the resulting crash pulse has a large influence on the injury level. Especially at high crash velocities a stiff structure in the first phase of the crash followed by a softer part is effective but difficult to realize with traditional structures. Therefore a comparison between several energy absorbing methods is made and friction is found as the best controllable way for adaptable energy absorption. In a proposed new concept design the right amount of energy could be absorbed by means of friction generated by hydraulic <b>brakes</b> on two <b>rigid</b> backwards moving beams. In case of an offset or oblique crash a mounted cable system moves the missed beam backwards. With this new intelligent design with interactive control, an optimal vehicle deceleration pulse can be possible for each crash velocity independent on the struck car position, yielding the lowest levels of the occupant injury criteria, also in case of compatibility problems...|$|R
