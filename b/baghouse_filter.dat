40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study is}} to use <b>baghouse</b> <b>filter</b> waste as a binder mixed with cement and lignite fly ash to solidify sludge from chromium electroplating wastewater treatment. To save cost of solidification, reducing cement in binder and increasing sludge in the cube were focused on. Minimum percent cement in binder of 20 for solidification of chromium sludge was found when controlling lignite fly ash to <b>baghouse</b> <b>filter</b> waste at the ratio of 30 : 70, sludge to binder ratio of 0. 5, water to mixer ratio of 0. 3 and curing time of 7 days. Increase of sludge to binder ratio from 0. 5 to 0. 75 and 1 resulted in increase in the minimum percent cement in binder up to 30 percent in both ratios. With the minimum percent cement in binder, the calculated cement to sludge ratios for samples with sludge to binder ratios of 0. 5, 0. 75 and 1 were 0. 4, 0. 4 and 0. 3 respectively. Leaching chromium and compressive strength of the samples with these ratios could achieve the solidified waste standard by the Ministry of Industry. For solidification of chromium sludge at sludge to binder ratio of 1, the lowest cost binder ratio of cement to lignite fly ash and <b>baghouse</b> <b>filter</b> waste in this study was 30 : 21 : 49.

Based on this data, an assessment in respect to Hg oxidation, SO 2 /SO 3 conversion and Hg and SO 3 capture on the test rig's filter was performed. The air and the oxy-fuel experiments with different extents of recycle gas cleaning, revealed differences in the Hg and SO 3 formation and capture behavior: the Hg /Hg tot ratios in the flue gas are higher during oxy-fuel combustion compared to air-firing. This effect is even more pronounced at the filter outlet, after flue gas has passed through the filter ash. In some experiments, even a net oxidation of Hg 0 entering the filter to Hg was observed. The Hg capture by ash in the <b>baghouse</b> <b>filter</b> has been found to reduce the Hg emissions considerably. However, the Hg capture was altered by the different oxy-fuel recycle configurations, leading to decreased Hg capture efficiencies on the filter for one of the coals. A coal-specific trend of increased SO 2 /SO 3 conversion ratios with increased flue gas SO 2 levels was observed that could be related to the ash composition of the three different coals. This and the higher SO 2 concentrations in the flue gas lead to considerably higher SO 3 levels in oxy-fuel combustion with SO 2 recycling. During the experiments, also a considerable capture of SO 3 in the <b>baghouse</b> <b>filter</b> was observed (up to 80 % under air- and up to 66 % under oxy-fired conditions).

A comprehensive set of total (Hg tot), elemental (Hg 0), and oxidized (Hg 2 +) mercury concentrations was measured for various air and oxy-fuel combustion conditions. These data enable an evaluation of process parameters that influence the Hg emissions of an oxy-fuel combustion process. A theoretical mass balance between Hg fed to the process (fuel and Hg 0 injection) and Hg measured before the filter matched well, indicating that no mercury was captured by fly ash at high temperatures. The capture of Hg 0 and oxidized Hg 2 + by ash in a <b>baghouse</b> <b>filter</b> has been determined for all experiments. Measured Hg concentrations show an increase when switching from air to oxy-fuel operation for all investigated coals and oxy-fuel settings, even when no additional Hg 0 is injected to the oxidant gas.

However, wet scrubber sampling showed that substantial losses of volatilized fluorine occurred from the cupola during operation. The losses during synthetic fluorspar trials considerably exceeded those from natural fluorspar trials. Laboratory viscosity testing, using a high-temperature rotational viscometer, confirmed this finding and indicated that fluorspar volatility in slags is related to slag basicity.

Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) contained in PM from biomass burning have been identified as genotoxic and cytotoxic, and some tools already exist to quantify their contribution to PM. Optical fluorescence microscopy is proposed as a rapid and relatively economical method to allow the quantification of PAH in different particles emitted from biomass combustion. In this study samples were collected in the flue gas of biomass-combustion facilities with nominal output ranging from 40 kW to 17. 3 MW. The fly ash samples were collected with various flue gas treatment devices (multicyclone, <b>baghouse</b> <b>filter,</b> electrostatic precipitator); PM samples were fractionated from the flue gas with a DEKATI® DGI impactor.

40|$|International audienceBaghouse dust {{collectors}} {{are commonly used}} in industry for removing solid particles from dust-laden gas. <b>Baghouse</b> <b>filter</b> media need to be periodically cleaned in order to remove collected particles from the filter surface. Pulse-jet cleaning is {{the most commonly used}} method but the detachment forces involved always affect downstream particle emission adversely. Although it is possible to find information about the mechanisms and the factors that cause particle emission, no link has been made between the distribution of the dirty airflow via the filter elements and the increase in released downstream particles after the bag cleaning. Innovative instrumentation of a pulse-jet-cleaned pilot dust collector allowed measuring the variation in the individual airflows which pass through each filter bag during clogging and cleaning cycles. The way in which segmented pulse-jet cleaning influences total dirty airflow distribution amongst filter elements was investigated. The consequences on bag airflow resistance and downstream particle emission were studied. Filtration cycles can be related to a succession of segmented pulse-jet cleaning, leading to imbalanced bag airflow resistances, and clogging. This in turn leads to compensations between bag resistances as a function of dust-laden individual bag airflow values. Airflow resistance variations are caused by two complementary phenomena: permeation of high transitory airflows on the first bags cleaned and the re-suspension of detached particles after a pulse-jet cleaning. During a cleaning sequence, strong airflow increases on the first cleaned bags are mainly prejudicial to dust collector downstream particle concentration...|$|E

The higher SOx concentrations, particularly sulfur trioxide (SO 3) {{in combination with}} high concentration {{of water in the}} recycled flue gas, increase the sulfuric acid dew point temperature in oxy-fuel fired systems, thereby increasing allowable flue gas temperatures and reducing the thermal efficiency of a power plant. This paper presents results of experiments carried out at a 20 kW once-through combustion rig of the Institute of Combustion and Power Plant Technology (IFK) of the University of Stuttgart simulating different extents of oxy-fuel recycle gas cleaning by impurities injection to the oxidant gas of a once-through combustion reactor. Three Australian coals that have previously been tested under air and oxy-fuel conditions at the Aioi furnace of IHI in Japan were used in the experiments. The SOx emissions were measured, conversion ratios of sulfur dioxide (SO 2) to SO 3 were calculated, and results were compared with existing literature, finding good agreement. The experiments with different extents of recycle gas cleaning and therefore different SO 2 levels in the system, revealed differences in the SO 3 generation behavior: A coal-specific trend of increasing conversion ratios of SO 2 to SO 3 with increased flue gas SO 2 levels was observed that could be related to the ash composition of the three different coals. The capture of SOx in a <b>baghouse</b> <b>filter</b> was also evaluated. Acid dew point temperatures (ADPs) for the flue gas were calculated for the various firing conditions.

P$ sb{ rm s}$ was defined as the molar ratio of SiO$ sb{ rm (g) }$ flow, calculated from the quartz weight loss during an experiment, to the SiO$ sb{ rm (g) }$ flow predicted at equilibrium. S$ sb{ rm q}$ was the molar ratio of steam to SiO$ sb{ rm (g) }$ flow.

However, {{for most of the}} time the two furnaces were not able to operate simultaneously due to a constraint in the capacity of the <b>baghouse</b> used to <b>filter</b> the lead dust from the waste gas.|$|R
40|$|During the {{production}} of ferrochrome in electric arc furnaces, a dust is captured in <b>baghouse</b> <b>filters</b> {{as a means of}} air pollution control. This dust contains various metals such as chromium, zinc, iron, aluminium and magnesium. Due to the presence of hexavalent chromium in the dust, which is both toxic and carcinogenic, it requires disposal at a hazardous waste disposal site, entailing high cost. The possibility exists that these costs could be reduced if metals such as zinc can be recovered from the dust through, inter alia, leaching. Experiments were performed to determine suitable conditions for the leaching of zinc from such a baghouse dust. A two step leaching procedure was followed which prevented the formation of silica gel. The most favourable conditions for zinc extraction was with a sulphuric acid concentration of 336 g/l and an acid to dust ratio of 0, 56. Under these conditions zinc was selectively leached with regard to iron and aluminium. The percentage recovery for zinc was 71, 2 %, aluminium 1, 8 % and iron 0, 1 %. It was concluded that the second step (dilution) of leaching did not have a significant influence on the percentage extraction of metals from the dust. Consideration of the chemical treatment cost of waste streams produced led to the conclusion that zinc recovery from baghouse dust is not an economically feasible project viewed in isolation. However, compared to disposal at a hazardous waste disposal site such as Holfontein, approximately R 467 054, 00 per annum (based on a seven day week and baghouse dust production of 3 600 kg/day) can be saved.

40|$|The primary {{objective}} of the Advanced Emissions Control Development Program (AECDP) is to develop practical, cost-effective strategies for reducing the emissions of hazardous air pollutants (HAPs, or air toxics) from coal-fired boilers. The project goal is to effectively control air toxic emissions {{through the use of}} conventional flue gas cleanup equipment such as electrostatic precipitators (ESPs), fabric <b>filters</b> (<b>baghouses),</b> and wet flue gas desulfurization (WFGD) systems. Development work initially concentrated on the capture of trace metals, fine particulate, hydrogen chloride, and hydrogen fluoride. Recent work has focused almost exclusively on the control of mercury emissions...|$|R
50|$|Like {{the lead}} ISASMELT pilot plant, the lead ISASMELT {{demonstration}} plant suffered from constraints {{imposed by the}} waste gas handling system. In {{the case of the}} demonstration plant, the problem was caused by sticky fume that formed an insulating layer on the convection tube bundles of the waste heat boilers, significantly reducing the heat transfer rates and thus the ability of the boilers to reduce the waste gas temperature. As the plant used <b>baghouses</b> to <b>filter</b> lead fume from the waste gas, it was necessary to reduce the temperature of the gas below {{the point at which the}} bags would be damaged by high temperatures. The problem was solved by allowing cool air to mix with the hot waste gas to lower the temperature to a level at which the baghouse could operate. This reduced the ISASMELT plant’s capacity because it was again limited by the volume of gas that could be <b>filtered</b> by the <b>baghouse.</b>|$|R
50|$|The W. H. Sammis Power Plant is a {{coal-fired}} power plant in Stratton, Ohio, USA. The plant, operated by FirstEnergy, {{was the subject of}} a Clean Air Act case by the Environmental Protection Agency filed in 1999. Renovations and construction were designed and managed by Bechtel Power, one of the world's largest and most successful engineering firms. Block 7 includes one of the tallest chimneys in the world (305 m), which was built in 1970. The power plant includes a tunnel for State Route 7, a four-lane freeway. The tunnel goes under the <b>Baghouse</b> structure, which <b>filters</b> particulate and toxic gases from the exhaust before entering the smoke stack.|$|R
40|$|In 2004, the Department of Energy National Energy Technology Laboratory {{awarded the}} University of North Dakota a Phase II University Coal Research grant {{to explore the}} {{feasibility}} of using barrier filters coated with a catalyst to oxidize elemental mercury in coal combustion flue gas streams. Oxidized mercury is substantially easier to remove than elemental mercury. If successful, this technique {{has the potential to}} substantially reduce mercury control costs for those installations that already utilize <b>baghouse</b> barrier <b>filters</b> for particulate removal. Completed in 2004, Phase I of this project successfully met its objectives of screening and assessing the possible feasibility of using catalyst coated barrier filters for the oxidation of vapor phase elemental mercury in coal combustion generated flue gas streams. Completed in September 2007, Phase II of this project successfully met its three objectives. First, an effective coating method for a catalytic barrier filter was found. Second, the effects of a simulated flue gas on the catalysts in a bench-scale reactor were determined. Finally, the performance of the best catalyst was assessed using real flue gas generated by a 19 kW research combustor firing each of three separate coal types...|$|R
