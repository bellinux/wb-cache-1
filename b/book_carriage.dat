5000|$|Rolt {{bought into}} a motor garage {{partnership}} {{next to the}} Phoenix public house in Hartley Wintney in Hampshire (their breakdown vehicle was an adapted 1911 Rolls-Royce Silver Ghost) and together with the landlord of the Phoenix, Tim Carson, and others, formed the Vintage Sports-Car Club in 1934. He also founded and helped create the Prescott hill climb. His 1950 <b>book</b> Horseless <b>Carriage</b> contains a diatribe against the emergence of mass production in the English car industry, claiming that [...] "mass production methods must develop towards the ultimate end automatic procreation of machines by machines, although by doing so, they involve either the supersession of men by machines or a continual expansion of production". His preference for traditional craftsmanship helps to explain his subsequent career.|$|R

50|$|In 1825 the Erie Canal {{was built}} linking Albany to Buffalo on Lake Erie. Locks 1 and 2 {{were located in}} North Albany. The canal led to the {{establishment}} of the Albany Lumber District, the future lumber district at this time being owned by the Patroon Stephen Van Rensselaer and his brother William, and consisting of mostly vegetable gardens that paid {{little in the way of}} rent. The Patroon was soon approached about building slips off the canal for the use of the lumber industry in return for a more ample amount of rent. For about a quarter century in the middle of the 19th century the Albany lumber district was considered the largest white pine wholesale market, and by the 1870s Albany was the largest lumber district in the United States by value, though by that time it had recently been outstripped in feet sold by Chicago. Also due to the canal's influence factories began to locate in North Albany producing a varied collection of goods including <b>books,</b> stoves, <b>carriages,</b> and machine tools. Large numbers of Irish who built the Erie Canal and continued to work in the factories of North Albany lent to the area the name of Limerick.|$|R
50|$|Lumley {{stayed in}} California until 1858 {{when he and}} younger brother Selim (1814-1884) moved up to Victoria for the Fraser Canyon Gold Rush. In Victoria, Lumley and Selim {{established}} Franklin & Company, Auctioneers and Land Agents, {{at the foot of}} Yates Street. Because they were English citizens, they were appointed by Governor James Douglas as the first government auctioneers for British Columbia. Franklin & Company took out full page adds in the daily newspaper, The British Colonist, to advertise items up for auction which usually included properties in the area, furniture, cattle, <b>books,</b> photographs and <b>carriages.</b> In addition, the Franklins bought up properties around Victoria for their own ownership, including a cattle sale yard on Fort Street. One of Lumley's properties in the Seattle, Washington area became the subject of a US Supreme Court ruling in 1896: Hanford vs. Davies.|$|R

Pardon to William Broun of Norton by Welbeck of suit of the King’s peace for felonies, treasons and other offences under the following circumstances: Robert Veel, {{keeper of the}} rolls of the King’s Bench, and John Wynchecombe, appointed by the king to take carts for the carriage of the rolls, being directed on Saturday before the feast of St Katherine last by Walter Clopton, Chief Justice, and other justices to carry the said rolls from York to Nottingham, where upon by reason of excessive rainfall affecting the roads, they could not without additional horses reach Nottingham, where upon {{by virtue of their}} commission and the justices order they took at Norton aforesaid two horses of John Levet and John Turnour of Norton, to be paid for in due course.
