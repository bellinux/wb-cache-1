5|$|Six of {{the bills}} {{that had been the}} subject of the double {{dissolution}} were introduced in Parliament a third time and, as expected, were again rejected <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate.</b> Section 57 of the Constitution provides that, after a double dissolution election, if bills that had been rejected twice <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> in the previous parliament were again passed by the House and again rejected <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate,</b> they could then be put to a joint sitting of both houses. On 30 July, Whitlam gained Kerr's agreement for a joint sitting, which was set for 6–7 August 1974. The joint sitting, the only one in Australia's history under Section 57, passed all six bills, including the enabling legislation for Medibank.|$|E

5|$|Justice John McKinley's {{death in}} 1852 led to repeated, fruitless {{attempts}} by the president to fill the vacancy. The Senate took no action on the nomination of New Orleans attorney Edward A. Bradford. Fillmore's second choice, George Edmund Badger, asked that his name be withdrawn. Senator-elect Judah P. Benjamin declined to serve. The nomination of William C.

5|$|After Actium and {{the defeat}} of Antony and Cleopatra, Octavian was in a {{position}} to rule the entire Republic under an unofficial principate—but he had to achieve this through incremental power gains.

Marching into Rome, Octavian and Marcus Agrippa were elected as dual consuls <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate.</b>|$|E
5|$|Another {{treaty that}} fared badly was the Johnson-Clarendon convention, {{negotiated}} in {{settlement of the}} Alabama Claims, for damages to American shipping from British-built Confederate raiders.

5|$|Macrinus {{and his son}} Diadumenianus were {{declared}} hostes, {{enemies of}} the state, <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> immediately after news had arrived of their deaths {{and as part of}} an official declaration of support for the usurper Elagabalus, who was recognized in the Senate as the new Emperor. The declaration of hostes led to two actions being taken against the images of the former Emperors. First, their portraits were destroyed and their names were stricken from inscriptions and papyrii. The second action, taken by the Roman soldiers who had rebelled against Macrinus in favour of Elagabalus, was to destroy all of the works and possessions of Macrinus. The damnatio memoriae against Macrinus is among the earliest of such sanctions enacted <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate.</b> Many of the marble busts of Macrinus that exist were defaced and mutilated {{as a response to the}} damnatio memoriae and many of the coins depicting Macrinus and Diadumenianus were also destroyed. These actions against Macrinus are evidence of his unpopularity in Rome.|$|E
