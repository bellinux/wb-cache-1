5|$|Throughout history, the Earth's {{atmosphere}} and biogeochemical cycles {{have been in}} a dynamic equilibrium with planetary ecosystems. The history is characterized by periods of significant transformation followed <b>by</b> <b>millions</b> of years of stability. The evolution of the earliest organisms, likely anaerobic methanogen microbes, started the process by converting atmospheric hydrogen into methane (4H2 + CO2 → CH4 + 2H2O). Anoxygenic photosynthesis reduced hydrogen concentrations and increased atmospheric methane, by converting hydrogen sulfide into water or other sulfur compounds (for example, 2H2S + CO2 + hv → CH2O + H2O + 2S). Early forms of fermentation also increased levels of atmospheric methane. The transition to an oxygen-dominant atmosphere (the Great Oxidation) did not begin until approximately 2.4–2.3billion years ago, but photosynthetic processes started 0.3 to 1billion years prior.|$|E

5|$|In Turkey and Persia, {{nationalist}} {{work had}} begun by 1909, {{under the leadership}} of Sardar Ajit Singh and Sufi Amba Prasad. Reports from 1910 indicate that Germany was already contemplating efforts to threaten India through Turkey, Persia, and Afghanistan. Germany had built close diplomatic and economic relationships with Turkey and Persia from the late 19th century. Von Oppenheim had mapped Turkey and Persia while working as a secret agent. The Kaiser toured Constantinople, Damascus, and Jerusalem in 1898 to bolster the Turkish relationship and to portray solidarity with Islam, a religion professed <b>by</b> <b>millions</b> of subjects of the British Empire in India and elsewhere. Referring to the Kaiser as Haji Wilhelm, the Intelligence Bureau for the East spread propaganda throughout the region, fostering rumours that the Kaiser had converted to Islam following a secret trip to Mecca and portraying him as a saviour of Islam.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the major}} focuses of Dunderdale's premiership has been the {{development}} of {{the first phase of the}} Lower Churchill Project—Muskrat Falls. Several weeks before becoming premier, Dunderdale along with Williams and Premier Dexter of Nova Scotia, signed a partnership agreement to develop the multibillion-dollar hydro development. During her first official meeting with Prime Minister Stephen Harper on February 1, 2011, Dunderdale asked for his government's support with a loan guarantee for Muskrat Falls. The loan guarantee would reduce the cost of the project <b>by</b> <b>millions,</b> resulting in lower electricity rates for consumers. Dunderdale's first throne speech as premier was read out by Lieutenant Governor Crosbie on March 21, 2011, and there was significant focus placed on the Lower Churchill development. During a campaign stop in St. John's during the 2011 federal election Dunderdale endorsed Harper and his Conservative Party while Harper committed to the loan guarantee. On August 19, 2011, Canada's Natural Resources Minister Joe Oliver announced a Memorandum of Agreement for the loan guarantee. While Oliver stated the loan guarantee would be in place by the end of November 2011, it was not until November 30, 2012 that the loan guarantee was finalized. In a simultaneous news conference held in St. John's and Halifax on December 17, 2012, Dunderdale and Emera Inc. announced they had both officially sanctioned the Muskrat Falls hydro development.|$|E

5|$|Prince Sadruddin's {{determination}} not {{to discriminate}} between European and Third World refugees helped prepare the UNHCR {{for a change in}} the landscape of internationally displaced persons. During the 1950s, between 200,000 and 300,000 refugees of European origin required assistance. By the 1970s the European refugee problems were mostly solved, but had been replaced <b>by</b> <b>millions</b> of displaced persons in the Third World. He had widened the UNHCR mandate well beyond its original focus on Eastern Europe, extending the organisation's reach to refugees from the Palestinian territory, Vietnam, Angola and Algeria. As the scale and complexity of refugee issues continued to increase, the UNHCR and the international community at large was better positioned to adapt. By the end of 1977 when he chose to step down from the position, he had become the longest-serving UN High Commissioner for Refugees. He continued to serve in various capacities dealing with humanitarian situations on behalf of the UN.|$|E
