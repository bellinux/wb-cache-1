5|$|That summer, Victoria and Albert spent a rainy {{holiday in}} the west of Scotland at Loch Laggan, but heard from their doctor, Sir James Clark, that his son had enjoyed dry, sunny days farther east at <b>Balmoral</b> Castle. The tenant of <b>Balmoral,</b> Sir Robert Gordon, died {{suddenly}} in early October, and Albert began negotiations {{to take over the}} lease from the owner, the Earl Fife. In May the following year, Albert leased <b>Balmoral,</b> which he had never visited, and in September 1848 he, his wife and the older children went there for the first time. They came to relish the privacy it afforded.|$|E
5|$|In 1954, Queen Elizabeth ordered Highland {{cattle to}} be kept at <b>Balmoral</b> Castle where they are still kept today.|$|E
50|$|<b>Balmoral's</b> iconic timber fire station, {{designed}} by Atkinson and Conrad, was {{opened on the}} 15th March, 1927.|$|R
50|$|The Prince Edward Island Highlanders were allied to the Black Watch (Royal Highland Regiment) {{and were}} kitted as Black Watch except for badges. Officers wore grey <b>Balmorals</b> in Service Dress and Battle Dress.|$|R
50|$|The toorie is {{generally}} made of yarn and is traditionally red on both <b>Balmorals</b> and Glengarries (although specific units have used other colours). It {{has evolved into}} the smaller pom-pom found on older-style golf caps and the button atop baseball caps.|$|R
5|$|At {{first light}} a {{clearing}} patrol from D Company, 3 RAR swept {{the area with}} tanks and APCs in support, killing and capturing a number of attackers that had been pinned down in old B-52 bomb craters {{to the north of}} <b>Balmoral.</b> The daylight revealed that the North Vietnamese had once again been soundly defeated leaving 42 dead and seven prisoners, while Australian losses were one killed and eight wounded. Quantities of weapons, clothing, ammunition and equipment were also recovered by the Australians. Phillips was subsequently awarded the Military Cross for his leadership during the battle. Many of the North Vietnamese dead were teenagers of 16 or 17 years, evidence that the PAVN had begun drafting 15-year-old boys into its combat units; as had happened after the earlier fighting, their bodies were collected by a bulldozer and buried in a mass grave. Later, a large number of shell scrapes were discovered to the north-east of <b>Balmoral</b> during an aerial reconnaissance by a Sioux light observation helicopter, and they were thought likely to have been used by the North Vietnamese as an assembly area before being engaged by artillery firing defensive fire tasks early in the battle. The successful defence of <b>Balmoral</b> and the high ratio of North Vietnamese killed had confirmed the judgement of MacDonald and Dunstan and validated the decision to adopt an aggressive defence with strong static positions and forceful patrolling. The failed assault proved to be the final attempt to remove 1 ATF from AO Surfers, and there were no further attacks by the North Vietnamese against either Coral or <b>Balmoral.</b>|$|E
5|$|When {{the monarch}} {{is not in}} residence, the Union Flag is flown at Buckingham Palace, Windsor Castle and Sandringham House, whereas in Scotland the Royal Standard of Scotland is flown at Holyrood Palace and <b>Balmoral</b> Castle.|$|E
5|$|After {{rounding}} Widmouth Head, {{the path}} passes 'The Coastguard Cottages' in Hele Bay {{and enters the}} seaside resort of Ilfracombe, with its small harbour, surrounded by cliffs. A seasonal foot passenger ferry service runs from the harbour to Lundy Island, and the <b>Balmoral,</b> the Waverley and pleasure boats ply to Porthcawl near Swansea. From Ilfracombe to Bideford the Tarka Trail coincides with the South West Coast Path.|$|E
50|$|The track has a one-mile (1.6 km) dirt oval. Its grandstands {{are capable}} of seating at least 71,000 spectators. There is {{stabling}} on the backstretch for over 900 horses. In its heyday, <b>Balmoral's</b> stalls were regularly at or near capacity.|$|R
2500|$|Oxfords (also {{referred}} as [...] "Balmorals"): the vamp has a V-shaped slit {{to which the}} laces are attached; also known as [...] "closed lacing". The word [...] "Oxford" [...] is sometimes used by American clothing companies to market shoes that are not <b>Balmorals,</b> such as Blüchers.|$|R
50|$|<b>Balmoral's</b> Drama Program rivalled {{many others}} on the North Shore, second only to Sentinel Secondary School. It was headed up by Ms. A Reale with the some {{assistance}} from Tim Cadney. The program put on around 5-7 different shows each year including spring and fall festivals.|$|R
5|$|Discovery {{returned}} to Britain in September 1904. The expedition {{had caught the}} public imagination, and Scott became a popular hero. He was awarded a cluster of honours and medals, including many from overseas, and was promoted {{to the rank of}} captain. He was invited to <b>Balmoral</b> Castle, where King Edward VII promoted him a Commander of the Royal Victorian Order (CVO).|$|E
5|$|Following the battalion's move up {{the railway}} line in July, Blackader was {{transferred}} to a new post at Balmoral; {{as well as the}} railway station, he was made responsible for a civilian concentration camp outside the town. These camps were frequently crowded, unhealthy, and badly supplied; few reports have survived on the <b>Balmoral</b> camp, however, and {{it is not clear how}} efficient or otherwise Blackader's administration was.|$|E
5|$|Other residences include Clarence House and Kensington Palace. The palaces {{belong to}} the Crown; they are held in trust for future rulers, and cannot be sold by the monarch. Sandringham House in Norfolk and <b>Balmoral</b> Castle in Aberdeenshire are privately owned by the Queen.|$|E
5000|$|Oxfords (also {{referred}} as [...] "Balmorals"): the vamp has a V-shaped slit {{to which the}} laces are attached; also known as [...] "closed lacing". The word [...] "Oxford" [...] is sometimes used by American clothing companies to market shoes that are not <b>Balmorals,</b> such as Blüchers.|$|R
50|$|Felsch {{spent the}} next 15 years touring the country with various amateur and semi-pro teams, {{including}} Scobey, Montana Outlaws in 1925 and 1926; Regina, Saskatchewan in 1927 (Regina <b>Balmorals</b> of the Southern Saskatchewan Baseball League), in Virden, Manitoba of the Winnipeg Senior League; and finally in Plentywood, Montana in 1928.|$|R
50|$|When the Canadian Forces unified on 1 February 1968, {{the rifle}} green beret was adopted as the CF standard. The RCAC {{successfully}} fought {{to retain its}} distinctive black beret, and the Canadian Airborne Regiment wore the maroon beret until the unit was disbanded. Scottish and Irish infantry regiments wear Tam o' Shanters, glengarries, <b>balmorals</b> or caubeens instead of berets.|$|R
5|$|The Royal Banner of Scotland is used officially at the Scottish royal residences of the Palace of Holyroodhouse, Edinburgh, and <b>Balmoral</b> Castle, Aberdeenshire, {{when the}} Queen {{is not in}} residence. The Royal Standard of the United Kingdom used in Scotland is flown when the Sovereign is present.|$|E
5|$|As an Alderman, Morton {{joined the}} new Liberal Party of Australia, {{becoming}} {{a member of}} the <b>Balmoral</b> local branch and a federal councillor. Morton soon joined the NSW Branch under party Leader Vernon Treatt and stood for the New South Wales Legislative Assembly seat of Mosman at the state election on 3 May 1947. At the election he succeeded in defeating the conservative Independent member, The Reverend Donald Macdonald, with 55.56% of the vote.|$|E
5|$|In contrast, for the North Vietnamese {{the battle}} was {{just one part of}} the May Offensive, {{although}} they later claimed to have killed 800 Australians during a single attack—a fact which may have indicated the importance they placed on it at the time. They had reacted quickly and proficiently to mount a battalion attack on the first night in an attempt to push the Australians off their line of communications; however, while the attacks on Coral and <b>Balmoral</b> had been well co-ordinated, the North Vietnamese and Viet Cong had repeatedly surrendered the element of surprise with preparatory fire and poor light discipline alerting the defenders on each occasion. Meanwhile, rigid command-and-control arrangements and a lack of radio communications had forced the North Vietnamese to operate on fixed schedules, preventing them from taking the initiative or responding rapidly to changing situations. Such inflexibility had resulted in predictability, with the communist commanders ultimately committing their forces to a frontal assault on Coral on the first night, and mounting very similar attacks against <b>Balmoral</b> on the nights of 26 and 28 May, both of which ended in costly failures.|$|E
60|$|From our drag we had {{a superb}} view as they came up the straight. The six horses were so close {{together}} that a carpet could have covered them, but half way up the yellow of the Mapleton stable showed to the front. Before they reached us, however, Desborough's bolt was shot, and the Colonel's horse, coming away with a rush, passed the post a good six lengths before its rival, the Duke of <b>Balmoral's</b> Iris making a bad third.|$|R

50|$|Oxfords (British), or <b>Balmorals</b> (American), lace up and tie to {{keep them}} on the wearer's foot, and have a closed lacing, where the pieces of leather joined by the laces are sewn {{together}} at the bottom. Many Oxfords have an additional piece of leather sewn over the toe section, known as a toe cap. Oxfords are the standard shoe to wear with most suits. White Buck shoes are {{a variant of the}} oxford that are made of buckskin, and considered the companion to seersucker and other summer suit fabrics.|$|R
5|$|Next, Tatanka {{defeated}} The Berzerker by pinfall. This {{match was}} originally scheduled {{as part of}} the pay-per-view. Due to time constraints it was cut from the PPV lineup in post-production. The match, however, later aired on WWF Prime Time Wrestling. On the Silver Vision home video release in the UK, this match was placed after the WWF World Heavyweight Championship match. Up next, Rowdy Roddy Piper joined the <b>Balmoral</b> Highlanders in playing Scotland the Brave on the bagpipes.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after her}} sister Marie {{was married to}} Crown Prince Ferdinand of Romania, a search was made for a {{suitable}} husband for Victoria. Her visit to her grandmother Queen Victoria at <b>Balmoral</b> Castle {{in the autumn of}} 1891 coincided with a visit by her cousin Prince Ernest Louis of Hesse, heir to the grand ducal throne of Hesse. Both were artistic and fun loving, got along well and even shared a birthday. The Queen, observing this, was very keen for her two grandchildren to marry.|$|E
5|$|The Royal Collection, which {{includes}} thousands of historic {{works of art}} and the Crown Jewels, is not owned by the Queen personally but is held in trust, as are her official residences, such as Buckingham Palace and Windsor Castle, and the Duchy of Lancaster, a property portfolio valued at £472million in 2015. Sandringham House and <b>Balmoral</b> Castle are personally owned by the Queen. The British Crown Estate – with holdings of £12billion in 2016 – is held in trust and cannot be sold or owned by Elizabeth in a personal capacity.|$|E
5000|$|Though {{called a}} castle, <b>Balmoral's</b> primary {{function}} {{is that of}} a country house. It is a [...] "typical and rather ordinary" [...] country house from the Victorian period. The tower and [...] "pepper pot turrets" [...] are characteristic features of the residence's Scottish Baronial style. The seven story tower is an architectural feature borrowed from medieval defensive tower houses. The [...] "pepper pot turrets" [...] were influenced by the style of 16th century French châteaus. Other features of the Scottish Baronial style are the crow-stepped gables, dormer windows, and battlemented porte-cochère.|$|R
50|$|The Glengarry {{worn by the}} Argylls {{is unique}} in having red and white dicing; other Scottish and Highland units {{generally}} have a black square alternating with red in the centre row. This pattern of dicing was worn by the 93rd Sutherland Highlanders on Kilmarnock bonnets and <b>balmorals</b> from their inception in 1803 to their amalgamation with the Argyllshire Highlanders in 1881, and on glengarries by the Imperial Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders from 1881 to 2006. Affiliate regiments in the Commonwealth also wear this unique pattern of glengarry, including the Calgary Highlanders. Regimental pipers in all Argyll-affiliated units wear plain black glengarries without dicing.|$|R
50|$|Barker {{began his}} career in his late teens {{reporting}} for the Evening News. Two well-received pieces, one on school life {{and the other on}} the 1936 Crystal Palace fire, earned him a weekly column as the paper's amateur drama critic at the age of 19, making him the youngest dramatic critic working on Fleet Street. During World War II he served as private and later a sergeant in the Gordon Highlanders where he helped run the theatrical entertainment group, the <b>Balmorals.</b> After the war he rejoined the Evening News, becoming a feature writer in 1946, the deputy drama critic later that same year, and the chief critic in 1958.|$|R
5|$|The Royal Family {{used the}} line from 1853 to travel to <b>Balmoral</b> Castle; in September 1866 the British Royal Train used Ballater station nearly a month before public {{services}} reached the station. At first Queen Victoria visited once a year, this becoming twice a year after Albert died in 1861. The number of visits returned to one a year after Edward VII became king in 1901. From 8 October 1865 a daily 'Messenger Train' ran when the Royal Family was at <b>Balmoral.</b> First class accommodation was available on these trains; accompanying servants were charged third class fares. In the late 1850s and early 1860s the Great North and the Scottish North Eastern Railway (SNER) were in conflict over the joint station in Aberdeen. Frustrated with lack of progress, the SNER proposed a new line that crossed the Deeside Railway. Whilst in discussions with the SNER about a link from this new line to the Deeside, a lease for the Deeside Railway was offered to the Great North, which was rapidly accepted. The Deeside board accepted the lease by a majority vote on 13 May 1862, and it was approved by Parliament on 30 July 1866. The Aboyne & Braemar remained independent, although services were operated by the Great North.|$|E
5|$|The devotion that Beatrice showed to {{her mother}} was {{acknowledged}} in the Queen's letters and journals, but her constant need for Beatrice grew stronger. The Queen suffered another bereavement in 1883, when her highland servant, John Brown, died at <b>Balmoral.</b> Once again, the Queen plunged into public mourning and relied on Beatrice for support. Unlike her siblings, Beatrice had not shown dislike for Brown, and the two had often been seen in each other's company; indeed, they had worked together {{to carry out the}} Queen's wishes.|$|E
5|$|Weston-super-Mare is {{a tourist}} destination, with its long sandy beach, Helicopter Museum, Weston-super-Mare Museum, Grand Pier, SeaQuarium {{aquarium}} and seasonal Wheel of Weston. A 2009 survey by Visit England placed the Grand Pier {{in the top}} ten free attractions in England. However, as of 2014, the pier charges for admission. On the Beach Lawns was a miniature railway operated by steam and diesel locomotives, which closed in 2012. The Paddle Steamer Waverley and MV <b>Balmoral</b> offer day trips from Knightstone Island to various destinations along the Bristol Channel and Severn estuary.|$|E
5000|$|The {{building}} which housed <b>Balmoral's</b> Furniture Company {{was formerly}} [...] "Wee Joe's Picture House", {{dating from the}} 1930s. Taking its name from [...] "Wee" [...] Joe McKibben, one of three owners of the cinema (which was nicknamed the [...] "Wee Shank"), it was said locally that it cost a jam jar {{to get in on}} account of the fact that patrons could go to McKibben's other place of business, a grocery shop, and swap an empty jam jar for a ticket to the cinema. The edifice was demolished after the bombing. Although a youth on the Shankill had seen the green car and person who planted the device, the bombers were never apprehended nor was anyone ever charged in connection with the attack. The McGurk's Bar bombing was the catalyst that sparked a series of tit-for-tat bombings and shootings by loyalist and republican paramilitaries that would help make the 1970s the bloodiest decade in the 30-year history of the Troubles.|$|R
60|$|Touchwood is {{that kind}} of good fellow. He is by turns insolent, quarrelsome, repulsively haughty to {{innocent}} people who approach him with respect, neglectful of his friends, angry in face of legitimate demands, procrastinating in the fulfilment of such demands, prompted to rude words and harsh looks by a moody disgust with his fellow-men in general--and yet, as everybody will assure you, the soul of honour, a steadfast friend, a defender of the oppressed, an affectionate-hearted creature. Pity that, after a certain experience of his moods, his intimacy becomes insupportable! A man who uses his <b>balmorals</b> to tread on your toes with much frequency and an unmistakeable emphasis may prove a fast friend in adversity, but meanwhile your adversity has not arrived and your toes are tender. The daily sneer or growl at your remarks is not to be made amends for by a possible eulogy or defence of your understanding against depredators who may not present themselves, and on an occasion which may never arise. I cannot submit to a chronic state of blue and green bruise as a form of insurance against an accident.|$|R
50|$|Finucane {{was born}} into a Roman Catholic family on Falls Road, Belfast. He was the eldest child, with six {{brothers}} and one sister. At the start of the Troubles, His family was forced out of their home. He graduated from Trinity College, Dublin in 1973. One of his brothers, John, a Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) member, was killed in a car crash in the Falls Road, Belfast, in 1972. Another brother, Dermot, successfully contested attempts to extradite him to Northern Ireland from the Republic of Ireland for his part in the killing of a prison officer; he was one of 38 IRA prisoners who escaped from HMP Maze in 1983. A third brother Seamus was the fiancé of Mairead Farrell, one of the IRA trio shot dead by the Special Air Service (SAS) in Gibraltar in March 1988. Seamus was the leader of an IRA unit in west Belfast before his arrest in 1976 with Bobby Sands and seven other IRA men, during an attempt to destroy <b>Balmoral's</b> furniture store in south Belfast. He was sentenced to 14 years' imprisonment. Finucane's wife, Geraldine, whom he met at Trinity College, is the daughter of middle-class Protestants; together they had three children.|$|R
