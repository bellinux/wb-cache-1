5|$|On July 23, {{the workers}} of the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad in Scranton {{proposed}} that their wages <b>be</b> <b>restored</b> <b>to</b> that prior to the recently imposed 10% reduction. On July 24 at 12:00 P.M., 1,000 employees of the Lackawanna Iron and Coal Company, unaffiliated with the railroad, peacefully walked out due to their own wage reduction. The railroad workers struck at 6:00 P.M. that same day.|$|E
5|$|The Deutsches Technikmuseum in Berlin has the {{wreckage}} of two complete aircraft that were recovered from separate crash sites near Murmansk in 1990 and 1994. These wrecks were purchased from New Zealand collector Tim Wallis, who originally planned for the remains to <b>be</b> <b>restored</b> <b>to</b> airworthy, in 1996.|$|E

50|$|The mill <b>was</b> not <b>restored</b> <b>to</b> {{working order}} and its {{condition}} deteriorated over time. In 1975, it <b>was</b> <b>restored</b> {{so that it}} could turn in the wind. A pair of millstones <b>were</b> <b>restored</b> <b>to</b> working order at a later date. In 1990, the cement rendering <b>was</b> <b>restored</b> <b>to</b> the mill, covering the north, west and south of the tower, as it was when the mill stood in Delft. The mill <b>was</b> <b>restored</b> in 2011-12, with a new stage, cap and sails.|$|R
5|$|A plug-in hybrid {{electric}} vehicle (PHEV or PHV), also known as a plug-in hybrid, is a hybrid {{electric vehicle}} with rechargeable batteries that can <b>be</b> <b>restored</b> <b>to</b> full charge by connecting a plug to an external electric power source. A plug-in hybrid shares the characteristics of both a conventional {{hybrid electric vehicle}} and an all-electric vehicle: it uses a gasoline engine and an electric motor for propulsion, but a PHEV has a larger battery pack that can be recharged, allowing operation in all-electric mode until the battery is depleted.|$|E
5|$|Computers may be {{impacted}} by volcanic ash, with their functionality and usability decreasing during ashfall, {{but it is}} unlikely they will completely fail. The most vulnerable components are the mechanical components, such as cooling fans, cd drives, keyboard, mice and touch pads. These components can become jammed with fine grained ash causing them to cease working; however, most can <b>be</b> <b>restored</b> <b>to</b> working order by cleaning with compressed air. Moist ash may cause electrical short circuits within desktop computers; however, will not affect laptop computers.|$|E
5|$|In 1642 {{civil war}} broke out between the {{supporters}} of King Charles I and those of Parliament. Gravesend was controlled by Parliament, who placed it {{under the command of}} a military governor who oversaw both this fort and Tilbury, and was used to control traffic entering London and to search for spies. Charles II regained the throne in 1660 and was petitioned by several royalists who claimed that they should <b>be</b> <b>restored</b> <b>to</b> the command of the blockhouse; William Leonard was ultimately successful. The defences were repaired and may have been occasionally used by the King as a banqueting hall.|$|E

5|$|In 1973, Congress {{repealed}} termination {{and restored}} federal {{recognition of the}} Menominee tribe. The Menominee Restoration Act was signed by Richard Nixon; it repealed the Menominee Indian Termination Act, reopened the tribal rolls, re-established the trust status and provided for the reformation of tribal government. The tribe was the first terminated tribe to <b>be</b> <b>restored</b> <b>to</b> trust and recognition status. The Restoration Act signaled {{the end of the}} termination era.|$|E
5|$|In March 1553 Suleiman urged Isabella {{to return}} to Hungary. Péter Petrovics rose against Ferdinand, and an {{assembly}} of the Székely people declared their loyalty to John Sigismund. However, both uprisings were crushed {{before the end of}} September. Deciding in April 1554 that Hungary should <b>be</b> <b>restored</b> <b>to</b> John Sigismund, Suleiman allowed Péter Petrovics to take control of two fortresses in Banat. Henry II of France, engaged in war against the Habsburgs, also urged Isabella {{to return to}} Hungary, promising one of his daughters in marriage to John Sigismund.|$|E
5|$|In {{the final}} stages of development, {{hitherto}} unknown information contained within undamaged DNA would be enough to bring others back from the dead including their memories and personality. This would be done by taking a small sample from someone's body and preserving it at the time when the level of the brain's efficiency and knowledge is highest. On the day of death, a cell would be taken from the sample for the cloning to take place, and the memories and personality would <b>be</b> <b>restored</b> <b>to</b> their peak level.|$|E

5|$|Initially, {{the riot}} {{appeared}} to increase {{public support for}} radical reform of the present degrading prison system. Some of that goodwill will have been eroded by the antics of the rioters {{in the last two}} weeks, and may be further eroded once details emerge during the forthcoming criminal prosecutions. But this must not deflect Home Office ministers from the road down which they had belatedly begun to travel. A change in prison conditions is crucial if good order is to <b>be</b> <b>restored</b> <b>to</b> the system.|$|E
5|$|The USS Atherton was {{transferred}} to Japan and served {{as part of the}} Japanese Maritime Self Defense Force until 1975 when she was returned to the United States. She was given to the Philippines in 1978 and served with the Philippine Navy as recently as 2016. Interest has been expressed in returning Atherton to the United States so she can <b>be</b> <b>restored</b> <b>to</b> her World War II appearance and be opened to the public.|$|E
5|$|The {{death of}} Zaharia left his princedom with no successor. As a result, his mother handed the {{fortress}} over to Venetian Albania, {{a stretch of}} possessions of the Republic of Venice. Skanderbeg urged the Venetian legates that Dagnum (along with Sati, Gladri and Dushmani which had been taken by Venice) should <b>be</b> <b>restored</b> <b>to</b> the League since it guarded an important trade route, but Venice refused and, consequently, Skanderbeg prepared for war against the Republic itself.|$|E

5|$|When {{added to}} glass, thorium dioxide helps {{increase}} its refractive index and decrease dispersion. Such glass finds application in high-quality lenses for cameras and scientific instruments. The radiation from these lenses can darken them {{and turn them}} yellow {{over a period of}} years and degrade film, but the health risks are minimal. Yellowed lenses may <b>be</b> <b>restored</b> <b>to</b> their original colourless state by lengthy exposure to intense ultraviolet radiation. Thorium dioxide has since been replaced by rare-earth oxides in this application, as they provide similar effects and are not radioactive.|$|E
5|$|According to Caltrain, the {{electrification}} {{project will}} bring multiple {{benefits to the}} corridor. Firstly, electric trains can accelerate and decelerate more quickly than the existing diesel locomotives, resulting in faster and more frequent service. They will also replace Caltrain's current diesel locomotives and passenger cars, {{a significant portion of}} which are nearing the end of their lives. Additionally, electric trainsets are quieter and produce less air pollution that diesel locomotives, and the use of electric trains will lower Caltrain's fuel costs while increasing passenger revenue, due to an expected increase in ridership. Once complete, Caltrain expects to annually reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 176,000 metric tons and increase daily ridership by 21% by 2040. Daily service may <b>be</b> <b>restored</b> <b>to</b> Atherton and Broadway stations. Caltrain plans to complete the project by the end of 2021.|$|E
5|$|After John's loss of Normandy, Maulay went to England and {{was given}} the manor of Upavon in Wiltshire. His grant of the manor was at the king's pleasure, because the manor, which had been held by a noble who {{forfeited}} his land in England by staying in Normandy after its loss, would need to <b>be</b> <b>restored</b> <b>to</b> its rightful holder if John recovered Normandy. He served as an envoy to Rome in 1213 and in 1214 was in command of royal forces at La Rochelle in France. In 1214 he married Isabella, the daughter and heiress of Robert of Thornham. Robert had died in 1211, so through his wife, Maulay acquired the Barony of Mulgrave in Yorkshire. Maulay paid the king 7000 marks as a fine {{for the right to}} marry Isabella, one of the highest fines paid for the right to marry under John. According to the medieval chronicler Ralph of Coggeshall, Maulay was the murderer of John's nephew Arthur of Brittany.|$|E

5|$|After {{the court}} adjourned, St-Calais was held as a {{prisoner}} at Wilton Abbey until his followers in Durham relinquished the castle. Once the castle was back under the king's control, St-Calais was released, and left for Normandy, and no more was heard of his appeal to Rome. Pope Urban II did write to the king in 1089 requesting that St-Calais <b>be</b> <b>restored</b> <b>to</b> his see, but nothing came of it. In Normandy, St-Calais quickly became one of Duke Robert's principal advisors and his chief administrator. On 14 November 1091 he regained the favour of William Rufus, and was restored to his see. Duke Robert had persuaded the king to allow Bishop William's return, perhaps in recognition of a service St-Calais performed for the king by brokering {{the end of a}} siege in Normandy that the king's forces were about to lose. The end of the siege prevented the loss of the castle.|$|E
5|$|At Easter, 1151, Theobald {{took over}} the {{management}} of the chapter's estates, as the new prior, Walter Parvus, was not up to the task. At first, there were no disputes, but soon the monks felt that Theobald was cheating them and imposing too rigorous a definition of poverty, and asked that the stewardship of the estates <b>be</b> <b>restored</b> <b>to</b> Parvus. Theobald refused and the monks attempted to appeal to the papacy. Their envoys, however, were caught by agents of the archbishop and the appeal went nowhere. Theobald then deposed Parvus and appointed a new prior. Theobald's relations with the monks after this point seem to have been without incident.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} of the fall of Constantinople, the only {{remaining}} territory of the Byzantine Empire was the Despotate of the Morea (Peloponnese), which was ruled by brothers of the last Emperor, Thomas Palaiologos and Demetrios Palaiologos. The Despotate continued on as an independent state by paying an annual tribute to the Ottomans. Incompetent rule, failure to pay the annual tribute and a revolt against the Ottomans finally led to Mehmed II's invasion of Morea in May 1460. Demetrios asked the Ottomans to invade and drive Thomas out. Thomas fled. The Ottomans moved through the Morea and conquered virtually the entire Despotate by the summer. Demetrios thought the Morea would <b>be</b> <b>restored</b> <b>to</b> him to rule, but it was incorporated into the Ottoman fold.|$|E
