40|$|While {{providing}} nursing care, in exceptional {{cases it}} is necessary to use restrictive measures to calm down a patient by applying physical restraints. However, since these are methods that seriously interfere with the patient´s personal liberty, {{it is necessary}} to observe certain principles {{in such a way that}} the methods minimize the risk of various complications, which may be both mental and physical, but also legal. Therefore, the indication for the use of these measures is especially the patient´s behavior that involves significant imminent danger or harm to the patient and others. The aim of our study was to determine what is the most frequent indication for putting the patient to a net <b>bed</b> <b>enclosure</b> in traumatological and psychiatric wards, to find out whether nurses have at their disposal the standards developed in relation to restraints, to find out what nurses regard as advantages and disadvantages in placing patients into net bed enclosures, to identify how nurses see the public´s attitude to the issue of the use of bed net enclosures and to determine the public opinion on the use of net bed enclosures. It can be seen from the results that over several years the approach to this issue of both the public and the medical management has changed and there is a readiness to use physical restraints or net bed enclosures properly and in accordance with human rights and human dignity. This thesis may be used as a theoretical basis for training students of non-medical disciplines or in training nurses on the issue related to the restraints. Furthermore, it could be used as a guide for the public to get the notion how the restraints and net bed enclosures are being used, how much attention is being paid to human dignity and personal liberty. This thesis also provides an overview of how the issue has evolved over time and what level it has reached at present. The issue of net bed enclosures and restraints in general is very "sensitive". Over the past ten years this issue has undergone many changes, has aroused indignation, but also understanding. Forms of restraints will certainly be the subject of a lot of negative or positive discussions in the future. It is important that nurses consider the patients, in which restraints have been applied, as their partners, that they meet all their needs and do their best to provide comfort taking into consideration their individualities...|$|E

50|$|Most tanning <b>beds</b> are {{horizontal}} <b>enclosures</b> with a {{bench and}} canopy (lid) that house long, low-pressure fluorescent bulbs (100-200 watt) under an acrylic surface. The tanner is surrounded by bulbs when the canopy is closed. Modern tanning beds emit mostly UVA (the sun emits around 95% UVA and 5% UVB). One review of studies found that the UVB irradiance of beds was on average lower than the summer sun at latitudes 37°S to 35°N, but that UVA irradiance was on average much higher.|$|R
40|$|Portable power {{generators}} are used very commonly in shops, offices and homes today {{in order to}} supply power during power shutdowns. These generators emit very high levels of noise, in addition to noxious air emissions. Exposure to noise causes detrimental effects on neuro-endocrine, cardiovascular, respiratory and digestive systems. Chronic exposure to noise causes fatigue and interferes with concentration, thus reducing work efficiency. Experimental studies on the assessment and control of indoor and near-field noise levels due to the operation of a portable power generator were undertaken at the Centre for Environmental Studies (CES), Anna University. Noise control was studied employing anti-vibration mounts (made up of rubber, coir, polyurethane foam, thermocole, wool–felt and sand <b>bed)</b> and <b>enclosures</b> (made up of cardboard, thermocole and a sandwich of cardboard and thermocole). The sand beds of 32 mm thickness (containing sand particle size 0. 5 mm) with an air gap of 5 cm between sandwich enclosure walls, among anti-vibration mounts and enclosures, respectively, {{were found to be}} most effective in controlling noise due to the generator operation...|$|R

The lion cubs were presented to the school of veterinary medicine with a complaint of weight loss and stunted growth despite having a normal appetite and seizures. Definitive diagnosis was made based on gross pathology after attempting various symptomatic treatments. This article therefore is meant to discourage the use of blankets as <b>bedding</b> in holding <b>enclosures</b> for warmth and comfort post-weaning in captive lion cubs and indeed wild cats in general as they tend to eat bedding that has been soiled with food...|$|R
40|$|Verocytotoxogenic E. coli O 157 (VTEC O 157) and Campylobacter jejuni/coli are {{zoonotic}} pathogens {{of public}} health importance, which are commonly carried and shed by cattle. Control at farm level needed isto limit shedding and {{contamination of the environment}} and the human food chain. On- farm risk factors for shedding of both bacteria were identified. Cross-sectional studies revealed that VTEC O 157 shedding was associated with low frequency of assessing the wetness of bedding, animals housed in large groups and wet <b>bedding</b> in <b>enclosures.</b> For Campylobacter indoor housing, presence of milking cows, less frequent emptying and cleaning of water troughs and drinking private water supply water increased the risk of shedding. A longitudinal study observed that groups of VTEC O 157 and Campylobacter shedding animals were only intermittently positive and that indoor housing increased the risk of shedding both organisms, where frequent cleaning of water troughs and drinking water from public water supplies were associated with reduced shedding of Campylobacter. A randomised controlled trial (RCT) was conducted {{to assess the impact of}} removal of risk factors on VTEC O 157. Dry bedding, stable rearing groups, a closed herd policy and no contact with cattle from other herds significantly reduced VTEC O 157 on farms over a period of 4. 5 months. When these results were collated with the risk factor studies, a 5 -point zoonotic control plan was generated: frequent emptying and cleaning of water troughs, dry <b>bedding</b> in <b>enclosures,</b> maintain stable rearing groups, apply a closed herd policy and avoid direct contact between cattle from different herds. To encourage uptake of the zoonotic control plan, the likelihood of implementation on farms was investigated. A total of 1. 5 years after the end of the RCT, ineffective measures were continued by 55 % of farmers, where only 19 % adopted new effective practices due to evidence of effect. Implementation of all practices had financial costs, but ineffective practices provided no disease-controlling benefits, but a perception of improved animal welfare. This observation showed that some farmers were willing to adopt practices without financial gains, if other benefits were perceived. To investigate motivators for implementation, theories from social sciences, behavioural economics and human medicine were combined with the knowledge of livestock farming. This generated a theoretical conceptual framework: a “pathway to disease control”-model, which was validated using field data. The “pathway to disease control”-model was used to identify and explain motivational factors for implementation of zoonotic control on English and Welsh cattle farms. In general, attitudes towards zoonotic control were positive, but intent to control was inhibited in approximately half the farmers by non-supportive social norms and/or a lack of belief in self-efficacy. The remaining farmers showed a gradual intent to control, but had not implemented any structured control program due to external barriers including lack of knowledge and cultural and economic pressure from both society and industry. The farmers with no intent to adopt control measures identified their private veterinarian as the preferred motivator, whereas consumer-demand and financial rewards or penalties were significantly more likely to be preferred by farmers who intended to control...|$|R
40|$|Incursion of the urchin Centrostephanus rodgersii into Tasmania, Australia, and its {{establishment}} at high densities {{raises questions}} about its potential interactions with another large herbivore on subtidal rocky reefs, the commercially fished abalone Haliotis rubra. Surveys on the southeast coast of Australia show a negative relationship between densities of C. rodgersii and H. rubra at several spatial scales, suggesting negative interactions. In intact algal <b>beds,</b> we used <b>enclosures</b> to estimate the effects and relative magnitude of intra- and interspecific competition on the body condition, gonad development and survival of C. rodgersii and H. rubra. An increased density of conspecifics led to declines in the dry gonad weight of C. rodgersii and in the dry foot and stomach content weights of H. rubra. The effects of interspecific competition were asymmetrical. Manipulations of H. rubra densities had no detectable effect on C. rodgersii. In contrast, in enclosures with added C. rodgersii, H. rubra showed reduced total and dry weights of stomach contents and increased mortality relative to controls without urchins. The effects of C. rodgersii on H. rubra could be linked to differences in feeding habits and morphology. C. rodgersii is a generalist herbivore, which, even at low densities, reduced the cover and standing biomass of total, brown and red algae relative to controls without urchins. In contrast, H. rubra is a specialist herbivore, which, even at high densities, {{had little effect on}} the cover and standing biomass of algae relative to the effect of C. rodgersii. This study suggests that the invader C. rodgersii is the superior competitor in interactions with H. rubra, and that its presence, even at low densities, affects the abalone fishery...|$|R
40|$|Asian catfish Clarias macrocephalus is an esteemed food fish {{especially}} in Southeast Asia {{due to its}} tender and delicious meat. This commodity constitutes a valuable fishery for small-scale fishers {{in the region and}} has a great potential for aquaculture. The important considerations in the grow-out culture of catfish are reliable water supply, soil with good compaction properties for dike construction, supply of fingerlings, feeds, labor, pond supplies and technology assistance. The farm must also be accessible by road, near to market facilities and has a peaceful environment. Rearing catfish in ponds is the most popular and commonly practiced. The pen culture is a system fully enclosed by nets on all sides but utilizes the dug-out pond, dam or lake <b>bed</b> as bottom <b>enclosure.</b> Tanks in abandoned old hatcheries with freshwater source can be used for catfish culture. In the cage culture system the stock is fully enclosed by nylon nets on all sides and bottom similar to an inverted mosquito net installed in suitable areas like reservoirs, dams, lakes and dug-out ponds. The rice-fish (catfish) culture is also practiced where the rice pond canals are utilized to retain water at 1 - 2 m depth to provide shelter to the fish while the rice plot maintains 10 - 20 cm water depth. For the stock, select fingerlings that are active, healthy and uniform in size. Handling of fish stock is important to avoid mortality due to stress during harvest, sorting, counting and transport. Furthermore, stocking of fish is recommended during the cooler part of the day. Catfish fingerlings stocking density is about 5 to 20 pcs/m 2 depending on the water supply and support facilities of the farm. The catfish, C. macrocephalus, requires a substantial amount of dietary protein for growth. For this species a formulated diet with crude protein (CP) of 34 %, moist diet (trash fish or blanched chicken entrails plus rice bran or cooked broken rice), and a combination of pellet feeds (50 %) and moist diet (50 %) have been tested and acceptable for the grow-out culture. Economic evaluation based on a grow-out culture in pond with an area of 1, 000 m 2 showed that feeds and fingerlings are the major variable costs. The net income, return on investments and payback period, respectively range from PhP 22, 972 -PhP 35, 741, 80 - 122 % and 0. 8 - 1. 2 years when using pellet, moist feed or a combination of these feeds. Feeding using formulated diet has an advantage of convenience, quality and quantity over moist diet which has issues such as inconsistent supply, storage requirement and fouling the rearing water...|$|R
