40|$|For {{straight}} or {{spiral bevel}} gears of nominal spherical involute design, the resultant total force vector transmitted by the gear mesh, {{in the absence of}} friction, lies in the plane of tooth contact. This force vector can be characterized by three scalar components, two orthogonal force components lying in the plane of contact and the resultant moment taken about the nominal center of the zone of contact. Equations for these three generalized force components are derived.

50|$|A C-start {{is a type}} of a {{very quick}} startle or escape reflex that is {{employed}} by fish and amphibians (including larval frogs and toads). There are two sequential stages in the C-start: first, the head rotates about the center of mass towards the direction of future escape, and the body of the animal exhibits a curvature that resembles a letter C; then, at the second stage, the animal is propelled forward. The duration of these stages varies from species to species from about 10 to 20 ms for the first stage, and from 20 to 30 ms for the second. In fish this forward propulsion does not require contraction of the antagonistic muscle, but results from the <b>body</b> <b>stiffness</b> and the hydrodynamic resistance of the tail. When an antagonistic muscular contraction does occur during stage 2, the fish rotates in the opposite direction, producing a counter-turn, and a directional change.|$|E

A simpler MacPherson strut design, replaces the class leading and highly refined double wishbone front suspension, in use since the second generation Accord. The rear suspension retains the independent multi-link suspension. The costlier design is now available only on the top-tier Acura RLX. The new front suspension helps shave weight and free up room in the engine compartment. In addition to the safety concerns of Honda's Advanced Compatibility Engineering, there is focus on <b>body</b> <b>stiffness</b> and dynamic handling response by improving structural rigidity around the front strut tower and lower control arm. All but the LX trim feature a strut bar. All trims receive upgraded shocks front and rear.

5000|$|Mechanography (also {{referred}} to as jumping mechanography or Muscle Mechanography) is a medical diagnostic measurement method for motion analysis and assessment of muscle function and muscle power by means of physical parameters. The method is based on measuring the variation of the ground reaction forces over the time for motion patterns close to typical every day movements (e.g. chair rise or jumps). From these ground reaction forces centre of gravity related physical parameters like relative maximum forces, velocity, power output, kinetic energy, potential energy, height of jump or whole <b>body</b> <b>stiffness</b> are calculated. If the ground reaction forces are measured separately for left and right leg in addition body imbalances during the motions can be analysed.

50|$|Suspension tuning {{involves}} {{modifying the}} springs, shock absorbers, swaybars, {{and other related}} components of a vehicle. Shorter springs offer greater stiffness and a lower center of gravity at the possible cost of unwanted changes of suspension geometry. Stiffer shock absorbers improve the dynamic weight shifting during cornering and normally have shorter internals {{to stop them from}} bottoming out when shorter springs are used. Stiffer sway bars reduce body roll during cornering, thus improving the grip that the tires have on the surface by reducing suspension geometry changes caused by roll; this also improves handling response due to faster weight shifting (similar to stiffer springs.) The danger with overly stiff swaybars is the lifing of the inner wheel, which changes traction of that end at a discontinuous rate. By increasing the roll resistance of on end, weight transfer is concentrated at that end, causing it to slip more than the other. This effect is used to control the over/under steer characteristic as well as to reduce roll. Other components that are sometimes added are strut bars, which improve the <b>body</b> <b>stiffness</b> and help better maintain the proper suspension geometry during cornering. On some cars certain braces, anti-roll bars, etc., can be retrofitted to base model cars from sports models.|$|E
