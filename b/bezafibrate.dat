50|$|Efaproxiral (INN) is an {{analogue}} of the cholesterol drug <b>bezafibrate</b> {{developed for}} the treatment of depression, traumatic brain injury, ischemia, stroke, myocardial infarction, diabetes, hypoxia, sickle cell disease, hypercholesterolemia and as a radio sensitiser. The chemical is a propanoic acid in the class of amphipathic carboxylic acids. Most propanoic acid produced is consumed as a preservative for both animal feed and food for human consumption. One use for efaproxiral is to increase the efficacy of certain chemotherapy drugs which have reduced efficacy against hypoxic tumours, and can thus be made more effective by increased offloading of oxygen into the tumour tissues. No benefit was seen for efaproxiral in phase III clinical trials. The increased oxygenation of tissues could theoretically also produce enhanced exercise capacity in feline, rat and canine models for approximately 100 min. immediately after a high dosage 45 min. intravenous infusion. This has led World Anti-Doping Agency to categorise efaproxiral under a prohibited method to artificially enhance the uptake, transport or delivery of oxygen. There is no existing evidence that efaproxiral can effectively enhance performance in humans. Efaproxiral can be absorbed via transdermal, rectal, inhalation and gastrointestinal routes, though not at plasma concentrations great enough to alter the oxygen-haemoglobin dissociation curve. Efaproxiral is explicitly excluded from the 2012 World Anti-Doping Agency list of Prohibited Substances and is explicitly included in the Prohibited Methods section M1 as a forbidden procedure to alter the oxygen-haemoglobin dissociation curve in order to allosterically modify haemoglobin.|$|E

40|$|The triglyceride-lowering {{effect of}} <b>bezafibrate</b> in humans has been {{attributed}} to peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) α activation based on results from rodent studies. However, the <b>bezafibrate</b> dosages used in conventional rodent experiments are typically higher than those in clinical use (≥ 50 versus ≤ 10 mg/kg/day), and thus it remains unclear whether such data can be translated to humans. Furthermore, because <b>bezafibrate</b> is a pan-PPAR activator, the actual contribution of PPARα to its triglyceride-lowering properties remains undetermined. To address these issues, <b>bezafibrate</b> at clinically relevant doses (10 mg/kg/day; low) was administered to wild-type and Ppara-null mice, and its effects were compared with those from conventionally used doses (100 mg/kg/day; high). Pharmacokinetic analyses showed that maximum plasma concentration and area under the concentration-time curve in bezafibrate-treated mice were similar to those in humans at low doses, but not at high doses. Low-dose <b>bezafibrate</b> decreased serum/liver triglycerides in a PPARα-independent manner by attenuation of hepatic lipogenesis and triglyceride secretion. It is noteworthy that instead of PPAR activation, down-regulation of sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) - 1 c was observed in mice undergoing low-dose treatment. High-dose <b>bezafibrate</b> decreased serum/liver triglycerides by enhancement of hepatic fatty acid uptake and β-oxidation via PPARα activation, as expected. In conclusion, clinically relevant doses of <b>bezafibrate</b> exert a triglyceride-lowering effect by suppression of the SREBP- 1 c-regulated pathway in mice and not by PPARα activation. Our results may provide novel information about the pharmacological mechanism of <b>bezafibrate</b> action and new insights into the treatment of disorders involving SREBP- 1 c...|$|E

Therefore, we proposed to investigate a possible preventive effect of <b>bezafibrate</b> on the development of colon cancer in patients with coronary artery disease during a 6 -year follow-up. Methods Our population included 3011 patients without any cancer diagnosis who were enrolled in the randomized, double blind <b>Bezafibrate</b> Infarction Prevention (BIP) Study. The patients received either 400 mg of <b>bezafibrate</b> retard (1506 patients) or placebo (1505 patients) once a day. Cancer incidence data were obtained by matching a subject's identification numbers with the National Cancer Registry. Each matched record was checked for correct identification. Results Development of new cancer (all types) was recorded in 177 patients: in 79 (5. 25 %) patients from the <b>bezafibrate</b> group vs. 98 (6. 51 %) from the placebo group. Development of colon cancer was recorded in 25 patients: in 8 (0. 53 %) patients from the <b>bezafibrate</b> group vs. 17 (1. 13 %) from the placebo group, (Fisher's exact test: one side p = 0. 05; two side p = 0. 07).

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Combined {{hyperlipidaemia}} is {{a common}} and highly atherogenic lipid phenotype with multiple lipoprotein abnormalities {{that are difficult to}} normalise with single-drug therapy. The ATOMIX multicentre, controlled clinical trial compared the efficacy and safety of atorvastatin and <b>bezafibrate</b> in patients with diet-resistant combined hyperlipidaemia. PATIENTS AND STUDY DESIGN: Following a 6 -week placebo run-in period, 138 patients received atorvastatin 10 mg or <b>bezafibrate</b> 400 mg once daily in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. To meet predefined low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) target levels, atorvastatin dosages were increased to 20 mg or 40 mg once daily after 8 and 16 weeks, respectively. RESULTS: After 52 weeks, atorvastatin achieved greater reductions in LDL-C than <b>bezafibrate</b> (percentage decrease 35 vs 5; p < 0. 0001), while <b>bezafibrate</b> achieved greater reductions in triglyceride than atorvastatin (percentage decrease 33 vs 21; p < 0. 05) and greater increases in high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) [percentage increase 28 vs 17; p < 0. 01]. Target LDL-C levels (according to global risk) were attained in 62 % of atorvastatin recipients and 6 % of <b>bezafibrate</b> recipients, and triglyceride levels < 200 mg/dL were achieved in 52 % and 60 % of patients, respectively.

Recently, induction of mitochondrial biogenesis, by transgenic overexpression of PGC 1 -alpha [peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) -gamma coactivator 1 -alpha], was reported to delay progression of early-onset cytochrome-c-oxidase (COX) deficiency in skeletal muscle of two mouse models: a muscle-specific knock-out of COX 10 (COX 10 -mKO) and a constitutive knock-out of Surf 1 (Surf 1 -KO). A pan-PPAR agonist, <b>bezafibrate,</b> could similarly delay myopathy progression in COX 10 -mKOs, but not in SURF 1 -KOs. We asked whether <b>bezafibrate</b> affected disease progression in late-onset adult-type mitochondrial myopathy mice. These ‘Deletor mice ’ express a dominant patient mutation in Twinkle-helicase, leading to accumulation of multiple mtDNA deletions and subsequent progressive respiratory chain (RC) deficiency with COX-negative muscle fibers at 12 months of age. The primary and secondary molecular findings in Deletor mice mimic closely those in patients with Twinkle myopathy.

Results: The effect of <b>bezafibrate</b> on cardiac function was evaluated by echocardiography in TazKD mice with or without beta-adrenergic stress. Adrenergic stress by chronic isoproterenol infusion exacerbates the cardiac phenotype in TazKD mice, significantly depressing LV systolic function by 4. 5 months of age. <b>Bezafibrate</b> intake over 2 months substantially ameliorates the development of LV systolic dysfunction in isoproterenol-stressed TazKD mice. Without beta-adrenergic stress, TazKD mice develop dilated cardiomyopathy by 7 months of age. Prolonged treatment with suprapharmacological dose of <b>bezafibrate</b> (0. 5 % in rodent diet) over a 4 -month period effectively prevented LV dilation in mice isoproterenol treatment. <b>Bezafibrate</b> increased mitochondrial biogenesis, however also promoted oxidative stress in cardiomyocytes.

This pattern of response was not due to differential inductions of VLCAD messenger RNA, as shown by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, but reflected variable increases in measured VLCAD residual enzyme activity in response to <b>bezafibrate.</b> Genotype cross-analysis allowed the identification of alleles carrying missense mutations, which could account for these different pharmacological profiles and, on this basis, led to the characterization of 9 mild and 11 severe missense mutations. Altogether, the responses to <b>bezafibrate</b> reflected the severity of the metabolic blockage in various genotypes, which appeared to be correlated with the phenotype, thus providing a new approach for analysis of genetic heterogeneity. Finally, this study emphasizes the potential of <b>bezafibrate,</b> a widely prescribed hypolipidemic drug, for the correction of VLCAD deficiency and exemplifies the integration of molecular information in a therapeutic strategy...|$|E
40|$|Very-long-chain acyl-coenzyme A {{dehydrogenase}} (VLCAD) deficiency is an inborn mitochondrial fatty-acid beta-oxidation (FAO) defect {{associated with}} a broad mutational spectrum, with phenotypes ranging from fatal cardiopathy in infancy to adolescent-onset myopathy, and {{for which there is}} no established treatment. Recent data suggest that <b>bezafibrate</b> could improve the FAO capacities in beta-oxidation-deficient cells, by enhancing the residual level of mutant enzyme activity via gene-expression stimulation. Since VLCAD-deficient patients frequently harbor missense mutations with unpredictable effects on enzyme activity, we investigated the response to <b>bezafibrate</b> as a function of genotype in 33 VLCAD-deficient fibroblasts representing 45 different mutations. Treatment with <b>bezafibrate</b> (400 microM for 48 h) resulted in a marked increase in FAO capacities, often leading to restoration of normal values, for 21 genotypes that mainly corresponded to patients with the myopathic phenotype. In contrast, <b>bezafibrate</b> induced no changes in FAO for 11 genotypes corresponding to severe neonatal or infantile phenotypes.

40|$|Multienzyme 2 -oxoglutarate complex (2 -OGDH) {{together}} with branched chain α-ketoacid dehydrogenase (BCKDH) and pyruvate dehydrogenase {{belong to the}} family of mitochondrial 2 -oxoacid dehydrogenases. Hypolipidemic drugs, <b>bezafibrate</b> and fenofibrate, up-regulate liver BCKDH. The present study has been undertaken to determine the effect of low doses of <b>bezafibrate</b> and fenofibrate on liver 2 -OGDH. Fibrates were administrated to rats fed low-protein diet at 5, 10 or 20 mg/kg. In rats treated with increasing doses of <b>bezafibrate</b> 2 -OGDH activity increased by 7, 35 and 42 %, while in rats administered with fenofibrate by 8, 18, and 56 % (p< 0. 05 for <b>bezafibrate</b> 10 and 20, and fenofibrate 20 mg/kg). Changes in 2 -OGDH activity did not correspond with changes in mRNA levels of the complex enzymes. Moreover, mRNA levels of PPARα remained unaltered. It is conceivable that stimulation of 2 -OGDH activity by low doses of fibrates is the result of post-transcriptional events and may {{have a significant effect on}} liver metabolism...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Objective: Combined {{hyperlipidaemia}} is {{a common}} and highly atherogenic lipid phenotype with multiple lipoprotein abnormalities {{that are difficult to}} normalise with single-drug therapy. The ATOMIX multicentre, controlled clinical trial compared the efficacy and safety of atorvastatin and <b>bezafibrate</b> in patients with diet-resistant combined hyperlipidaemia. Patients and study design: Following a 6 -week placebo run-in period, 138 patients received atorvastatin 10 mg or <b>bezafibrate</b> 400 mg once daily in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. To meet predefined low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) target levels, atorvastatin dosages were increased to 20 mg or 40 mg once daily after 8 and 16 weeks, respectively. Results: After 52 weeks, atorvastatin achieved greater reductions in LDL-C than <b>bezafibrate</b> (percentage decrease 35 vs 5; p < 0. 0001), while <b>bezafibrate</b> achieved greater reductions in triglyceride than atorvastatin (percentage decrease 33 vs 21; p < 0. 05) and greater increases in high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) [percentage increase 28 vs 17; p < 0. 01].
