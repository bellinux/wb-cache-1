60|$|But {{the most}} forlorn {{creature}} out {{that day was}} a small errand girl, with a bonnet-box on each arm, and both hands struggling to hold a <b>big</b> <b>broken</b> umbrella. A pair of worn-out boots let in the wet upon her tired feet; a thin cotton dress and an old shawl poorly protected her from the storm; and a faded hood covered her head.|$|E
60|$|All {{day that}} hill of houses over London had been domed and sealed up with cold cloud. Yet {{three men and}} two girls had at last found even the gray and chilly garden more {{tolerable}} than the black and cheerless interior. When the wind came it split the sky and shouldered the cloudland left and right, unbarring great clear furnaces of evening gold. The burst of light released and the burst of air blowing seemed to come almost simultaneously; and the wind especially caught everything in a throttling violence. The bright short grass lay all one way like brushed hair. Every shrub in the garden tugged at its roots like a dog at the collar, and strained every leaping leaf after the hunting and exterminating element. Now and again a twig would snap and fly like a bolt from an arbalist. The three men stood stiffly and aslant against the wind, as if leaning against a wall. The two ladies disappeared into the house; rather, to speak truly, they were blown into the house. Their two frocks, blue and white, looked like two <b>big</b> <b>broken</b> flowers, driving and drifting upon the gale. Nor is such a poetic fancy inappropriate, for there was something oddly romantic about this inrush of air and light after a long, leaden and unlifting day. Grass and garden trees seemed glittering with something at once good and unnatural, like a fire from fairyland. It seemed like a strange sunrise at {{the wrong end of}} the day.|$|E
50|$|The Grave of Castellana {{is a huge}} natural pantheon {{thanks to}} its natural {{skylight}} surrounded by a circle of holm-oaks through which a ribbon of clear sky is visible. From the ceiling a big sunbeams filters down into the darkness and it moves differently according {{to the time of}} the day and the season. Within the Grave, the sunlight creates magical effects, firstly draws a huge white screen on the descending walls, secondly it gives life to a far stalagmite group, called the Cyclopes because they look like sea giants rising out from the chaos of a stormy sea. Finally it reaches the irregular and dark bottom of the chasm. The southern walls, the <b>big</b> <b>broken</b> curtains and the green moss-grown columns stay always in the darkness. Beyond these columns there is the majestic architectural structures that the nature build up in the darkness by the passing of time.The Grave is the first huge cave of the cave karst system and the only one communicating with the outside. Its history dates back to ninety-one hundred millions of years ago in the upper Cretaceous. At that time Apulia was submerged by an old sea where lived large colonies of molluscs and sea vegetables. For millions of years generations of these life forms-plants and marine molluscs succeeded each other and died, so their empty shells and their carcasses were piled up on the seabed, forming a giant deposit of mud and sand, that with a continuous growth was compressed forming limestone layers for a total thickness of several kilometres. Starting since 66 millions of years ago, the gradual raising of the land brought the region to its current aspect. However, the new emerged land was too rigid and for this reason it was cut in a multitude of fractures. The eluvial water of large rainfall infiltrated into the subsurface soil and rock and created massive groundwater aquifer. The physical and chemical effect of water running underground, dissolved gradually the limestone and enlarged the fractures. Over geological eras cracks expanded to till become galleries and then cavern which became bigger and bigger. In certain cases a large number of cracks intersected and so there were several frequent collapses, while the thickness of the rock, that separated the cave from the outside, was so reduced that the vault fell down. This happened in the Grave of Castellana and thus the first sunbeam could come {{in the darkness of the}} cave.|$|E

40|$|O brunimento é uma das etapas de beneficiamento do arroz que tem grande importância sobre o rendimento de engenho. Neste trabalho, analisaram-se relações granulométricas de frações de grãos na massa de arroz e seus efeitos sobre o rendimento de engenho, durante o processo de brunimento. As amostras usadas foram 78 g de arroz descascado, tendo essas partido de amostras originais de 100 g. Foram testadas cinco relações de composição de amostras a serem brunidas, variando as quantidades de grãos quebrados e de quirera que acompanhavam a massa de grãos inteiros, que foram: 1) somente grãos inteiros; 2) 6, 16 g de quebrados e 1, 04 g de quirera, {{conforme}} amostra original; 3) 3, 60 g de quebrados e 3, 60 g de quirera adicionados aos inteiros; 4) 7, 20 g de quebrados adicionados aos inteiros, e 5) 7, 20 g de quirera adicionada aos inteiros. Os procedimentos foram executados com uso de engenho de provas e com classificação manual. O rendimento de engenho foi significativamente superior, após a operação de brunimento de arroz, quando existem, na massa a ser brunida, grãos quebrados e quirera, variando entre 3, 60 g a 7, 20 g e 1, 04 g a 7, 20 g, respectivamente, comparada ao brunimento da massa composta por 100 % de grãos inteiros. Milling yield using {{five different}} rates of broken and head rice was tested. The samples were {{arranged to have}} different amounts of big and small broken kernels in the mass of grains. The size of each fraction of broken grains was established according to the Brazilian Rules of Rice Classification. The paddy sample had 100 g and the brown rice sample had 78 g. The brown rice was milled by adding different proportions of broken kernels to make five treatments as follows: 1) only whole kernels; 2) 6. 16 g of <b>big</b> <b>broken</b> kernels and 1. 04 g of small broken kernels were used as they appear in the original lot; 3) 3. 6 g of <b>big</b> <b>broken</b> kernels and 3. 6 g of small broken kernels {{were added to the}} whole kernels; 4) 7. 2 g of <b>big</b> <b>broken</b> kernels were added to the whole kernels and 5) 7. 2 g of small broken kernels were added to the whole kernels. A laboratory mill was used. The classification was made manually. The percentages of broken kernels varied from 3. 6 % to 7. 2 % in the fraction of <b>big</b> <b>broken</b> kernels and from 1. 04 % to 7. 2 % in the fraction of small broken kernels, respectively. The results showed that, in the milling process using broken kernels in the mass, the head rice yield was significantly higher than when 100 % of head kernels were milled...|$|E
