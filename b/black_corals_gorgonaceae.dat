50|$|Though <b>black</b> <b>coral's</b> living {{tissue is}} brilliantly colored, it takes {{its name from}} the {{distinctive}} black or dark brown color of its skeleton. Also unique to <b>black</b> <b>coral</b> are the tiny spines that cover the surface of the skeleton, the origin of the nickname little thorn coral. In the Hawaiian language, <b>black</b> <b>coral</b> is called ‘ēkaha kū moana and is the official state gem of Hawaii. <b>Black</b> <b>coral</b> is listed in Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES).|$|R

40|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{distribution}} of <b>black</b> <b>corals</b> in the northwestern Gulf of Mexico. Of thirty-nine species of <b>black</b> <b>coral</b> documented in the Western Atlantic, thirty have been previously documented by various studies in the Gulf of Mexico. This study proposes potential range extensions for four <b>black</b> <b>coral</b> species, including Stichopathes gracilis, Stichopathes semiglabra, Tanacetipathes paula, and Tanacetipathes spinescens, to include the Gulf of Mexico. The validation of in situ identifications of <b>black</b> <b>coral</b> species is evaluated, and recommendations for species identifications and species groupings are made. <b>Black</b> <b>coral</b> associated fauna are documented, supporting known associations and documenting potentially new associations and species. Habitat suitability models for the distribution of <b>black</b> <b>coral</b> species at selected banks in the northwestern Gulf of Mexico were generated. Presence-only models made using the MaxEnt modeling program were compared to presence-absence models made using Boosted Regression Tree modeling techniques. Presence-absence models were documented to have greater predictive accuracy than the presence-only models, which showed evidence of model overfitting. The model was projected to five similar salt-dome features in the region, highlighting extensive habitat for multiple <b>black</b> <b>coral</b> species in these unexplored habitats. This study presents habitat suitability maps as a testable hypothesis for <b>black</b> <b>coral</b> distribution in the mesophotic zone of this region...|$|R
5000|$|Where {{there is}} <b>Black</b> <b>Coral</b> {{it is likely}} that one will be able to spot a Triacanthidae. [...] They feed off of <b>Black</b> <b>Coral.</b> This is why the Triacanthidae is mostly found around Northern Australia and Indonesia. Most fish are unable to feed off of <b>Black</b> <b>Coral</b> however their sharp and heavy teeth enable them to break the {{membrane}} of the Coral and access the rich nutrients that most fish cannot get to. [...] This particular species of fish has been greatly decline due to harvesting of <b>Black</b> <b>Coral.</b> The graph below shows how the number of Triacanthidae began greatly decreasing in 1990 when harvesting <b>Black</b> <b>Coral</b> for sale first gained popularity. [...] The species was dying rapidly until just recently in 2006 when a law banned the harvesting of <b>Black</b> <b>Coral.</b> The graph below shows then number of fish estimated for each year on the x-axis.|$|R
40|$|For over 40 yr, the <b>black</b> <b>coral</b> {{fishery in}} Hawai'i has been managed successfully. However, three new {{developments}} now threaten sustainability of the resource. First, harvesting pressure on increasingly smaller colonies of both species of commercial <b>black</b> <b>coral</b> (Antipathes dichotoma Pallas and Antipathes grandis Verrill) has increased. Since 1976, {{the biomass of}} <b>black</b> <b>coral</b> in the overall bed off Maui, Hawai'i, has decreased by about 25 %. Second, at depths between 80 and 110 m off Maui an alien species, Carijoa riisei (Duchassaing & Michelotti), has overgrown {{large areas of the}} substratum as well as many adult colonies of both species of commercial <b>black</b> <b>coral.</b> This invasion may be contributing to a decrease in the recruitment of both species of <b>black</b> <b>coral</b> at shallower depths. Third, increasing sales of <b>black</b> <b>coral</b> jewelry in recent years is also placing more demand on the resource. Taken together, these trends suggest a need for more stringent regulations, including a larger size (height) limit, a reduction in the maximum sustained yield, and possible reassessment of the economics of the fishery. Adoption of these or other measures would help to extend and ensure continued sustainability of the <b>black</b> <b>coral</b> fishery in Hawai'i and long-term conservation of the resource...|$|R

40|$|Although <b>black</b> <b>corals</b> {{are among}} the most common azooxanthellate corals in {{tropical}} reefs, data about their ecology are very scarce.

40|$|Doubtful Sound {{and other}} New Zealand fjords are {{unique in that}} they provide {{suitable}} habitat for a <b>black</b> <b>coral</b> species (Antipathes fiordensis) at depths as shallow as 4. m. Research suggests the upper depth limit at which <b>black</b> <b>corals</b> can survive in Doubtful Sound is controlled by gradients in salinity (as opposed to light levels) within buoyant low-salinity layers (LSL). The thickness of the LSL in Doubtful Sound varies along the fjord and fluctuates {{as a function of}} rain, wind and freshwater tailrace discharge from the Manapouri Hydroelectric Power Station. A pattern-oriented survivorship model was developed to predict mortality and upper-depth distribution of <b>black</b> <b>corals</b> in Doubtful Sound in response to changes in the LSL. Model parameters were estimated using observed patterns of <b>black</b> <b>coral</b> distribution and time-series salinity measurements over a range of depths. Predicted upper depth limits in Doubtful Sound and a reference fjord (Milford Sound) were validated against field observations of <b>black</b> <b>coral</b> depth distributions on the adjacent rock walls. The model accurately forecasted depths of corals in mid to outer regions of Doubtful Sound, but underestimated upper depth limits in the inner region of both fjords. The discrepancies in inner fjord locations suggest that other factors, such as sedimentation, are also limiting establishment of long-lived corals in some locations. Data from hydrodynamic simulations of the LSL in Doubtful Sound were fed into the survivorship model to investigate <b>black</b> <b>coral</b> distributions under varying rain, wind and tailrace discharge scenarios. Results indicate that weather, rather than tailrace discharge, drives long-term patterns in the vertical distribution of <b>black</b> <b>corals</b> in Doubtful Sound. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract In 2001 Carijoa riisei, an octocoral {{native to}} the {{tropical}} Western Atlantic, was discovered overgrowing <b>black</b> <b>corals</b> in the Au’au Channel in Hawaii. In this paper data from a 2001 survey are reanalyzed and combined with new data from 2003 and 2004 to assess the ecological impact in greater detail. C. riisei differ-entially affected reproductively mature <b>black</b> <b>coral</b> col-onies with maximum impact between 80 and 105 m. The pattern of C. riisei overgrowth on <b>black</b> <b>corals</b> and C. riisei on the substrata appears to be bounded by high irradiance in shallow water and cold temperature in deep water. Evidence suggests that the C. riisei settlement on <b>black</b> <b>corals</b> is facilitated by other epifauna. Once established, C. riisei spreads vegetatively and smothers the coral. The success of the C. riisei invasion appears to be unaided by anthropogenic disturbance and is at least partially attributable to Hawaii’s depauperate shallow-water (< 100 m) octocoral fauna...|$|R
