The published article is copyrighted by Informa Healthcare {{and can be found}} at: [URL] hydrostatic pressure (HHP) is the most-widely adopted novel non-thermal technology for the commercial pasteurization of foods. However, HHP-induced inactivation of <b>bacterial</b> <b>spores</b> remains a challenge due their resistance to the treatment limits of currently available industrial HHP units (i. e., ~ 650 MPa and 50 °C). Several reports have demonstrated that high pressure can modulate the germination machinery of <b>bacterial</b> <b>spores</b> rendering them susceptible to subsequent inactivation treatments. Unfortunately, high pressure-induced germination is a unique phenomenon for spores of the genus Bacillus but not Clostridium. Alternative strategies to inactivate <b>bacterial</b> <b>spores</b> at commercially available pressure and temperature levels include the germination step by inclusion of known germinants into the food formulation to increase the lethality of HHP treatments on <b>bacterial</b> <b>spores.</b> The aim of this review is to provide an overview of the molecular basis involved in pressure-triggered germination of <b>bacterial</b> <b>spores</b> and of novel strategies to inactivate <b>bacterial</b> <b>spores</b> with HHP treatments...|$|R

40|$|AbstractRecently, global {{public health}} {{organizations}} such as Doctors without Borders (MSF), the World Health Organization (WHO), Public Health Canada, National Institutes of Health (NIH), and the U. S. government developed and deployed Field Decontamination Kits (FDKs), a novel, lightweight, compact, reusable decontamination technology to sterilize Ebola-contaminated medical devices at remote clinical sites lacking infra-structure in crisis-stricken regions of West Africa (medical waste materials are placed in bags and burned). The basis for effectuating sterilization with FDKs is chlorine dioxide (ClO 2) produced from a patented invention developed {{by researchers at the}} US Army – Natick Soldier RD&E Center (NSRDEC) and commercialized as a dry mixed-chemical for <b>bacterial</b> <b>spore</b> decontamination. In fact, the NSRDEC research scientists developed an ensemble of ClO 2 technologies designed for different applications in decontaminating fresh produce; food contact and handling surfaces; personal protective equipment; textiles used in clothing, uniforms, tents, and shelters; graywater recycling; airplanes; surgical instruments; and hard surfaces in latrines, laundries, and deployable medical facilities.

We present herein the unique attributes of NSRDEC’s novel decontamination technologies and a Case Study of the development of FDKs that were deployed in West Africa by international public health organizations to sterilize Ebola-contaminated medical equipment.

40|$|Most {{organic and}} many {{inorganic}} materials absorb strongly in specific wavelength ranges {{in the deep}} UV between about 220 nm and 300 nm. Excitation within these absorption bands results in native fluorescence emission.

40|$|<b>Bacterial</b> <b>spore</b> {{formation}} {{is a complex}} process of fundamental relevance to biology and human disease. The spore coat structure is complex and poorly understood, and the roles {{of many of the}} protein components remain unclear. We describe a new family of spore coat proteins, the <b>bacterial</b> <b>spore</b> kinases (BSKs), and the first crystal structure of a BSK, YtaA (CotI) from Bacillus subtilis. BSKs are widely distributed in spore-forming Bacillus and Clostridium species, and have a dynamic evolutionary history. Sequence and structure analyses indicate that the BSKs are CAKs, a prevalent group of small molecule kinases in bacteria that is distantly related to the eukaryotic protein kinases. YtaA has substantial structural similarity to CAKs, but also displays distinctive features that broaden our understanding of the CAK group. Evolutionary constraint analysis of the protein surfaces indicates that members of the BSK family have distinct clade-conserved patterns in the substrate binding region, and probably bind and phosphorylate distinct targets. Several classes of BSKs have apparently independently lost catalytic activity to become pseudokinases, indicating that the family also has a major noncatalytic function.

40|$|Bacterial spores, or endospores, are {{produced}} by certain genera of bacteria under stress and {{are considered to be}} one of the most resilient forms of life on Earth. Detection of endospores is vital in areas ranging from bioburden reduction to homeland security. Rapid <b>bacterial</b> <b>spore</b> detection is achieved by targeting dipicolinic acid (DPA), a chemical marker unique to endospores. An improvement on the current <b>bacterial</b> <b>spore</b> detection assay based on sensitized lanthanide luminescence is presented through the implementation of a dipicolinate-specific Tb^(3 +) receptor site. The use of a chelating ligand such as DO 2 A (1, 4, 7, 10 -tetraazacyclododecane- 1, 7 -bisacetate) can increase both the sensitivity and selectivity of the assay. The luminescent series of Ln(DO 2 A) (DPA) - complexes (Ln = Sm, Eu, Tb and Dy) is fully characterized in terms of structure, photophysics and stability, and the Tb(DO 2 A) ^+ binary complex in particular is investigated as a sensing complex for bacterial spores. The ‘ligand enhancement’ observed in all cases improves dipicolinate binding affinity by approximately one order of magnitude over the lanthanide ion alone. Binding of the DO 2 A ligand also appears to generate a ‘gadolinium break’ effect, creating a discrepancy in binding affinity in the lanthanide series and rendering the terbium complex the most effective dipicolinate receptor site of all investigated. We have also extended the application of this receptor site design technology to the targeted detection of other aromatic analytes of biological relevance, such as salicylates and catecholamines. Our work indicates that construction of effective receptor site complexes is not governed by net electrostatic considerations, and that local charge variations from the ligand-induced perturbation of lanthanide electron density may play a significant role. This work sets the stage for the development of the next-generation terbium(macrocycle) complex for <b>bacterial</b> <b>spore</b> detection, with the aim of constructing a solid-state endospore microsensor for applications ranging from sterilization validation to life detection in extreme environments...|$|E

50|$|Around 1970, {{researchers}} renewed {{their efforts}} in studying <b>bacterial</b> <b>spores</b> {{after it was}} discovered that using moderate pressures was more effective than using higher pressures.

When subjected to moderate pressures, <b>bacterial</b> <b>spores</b> germinate, and the resulting spores are easily killed using pressure, heat, or ionizing radiation. If the amount of initial pressure is increased, conditions are not ideal for germination, so the original spores must be killed instead. However, using moderate pressure does not always work, as some <b>bacterial</b> <b>spores</b> are more resistant to germination under pressure and a small portion of them will survive. A preservation method using both pressure and another treatment (such as heat) to kill spores has not yet been reliably achieved.
