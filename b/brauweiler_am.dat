50|$|Brauweiler Abbey (German: Abtei <b>Brauweiler)</b> <b>is</b> {{a former}} Benedictine monastery located at Brauweiler, now in Pulheim near Cologne, North Rhine-Westphalia, in Germany.|$|R
50|$|<b>Brauweiler</b> <b>is</b> {{a part of}} Pulheim, west of Cologne, North Rhine-Westphalia in Germany. The former Benedictine abbey, Brauweiler Abbey, founded 1024, is {{used today}} by the Rhein Department for the Care of Historic Monuments.|$|R
50|$|The {{building}} has distinct {{references to the}} Church of St. Maria im Kapitol in Cologne, founded by Richeza's sister Ida. Both crypts are laid out identically, the two bays in <b>Brauweiler,</b> however, <b>were</b> shorter. In the upper church, there <b>are</b> clear references. <b>Brauweiler</b> <b>is</b> seen as {{a copy of the}} Cologne Cathedral, probably thanks to the influence of Richeza's brother Hermann II, who in 1040 consecrated Stavelot Abbey.|$|R

50|$|<b>Brauweiler</b> <b>is</b> an Ortsgemeinde - a {{municipality}} {{belonging to}} a Verbandsgemeinde, a kind of collective municipality - in the Bad Kreuznach district in Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany.

50|$|A Life of Wolfhelm {{written a}} {{generation}} later, by Konrad, a monk of <b>Brauweiler,</b> <b>was</b> a hagiographical work. It {{is known that}} Wolfhelm taught at the Cologne's cathedral school, {{before moving to the}} Abbey in 1065. It is not known whether the encounter related by Manegold really took place.|$|R

50|$|Many prehistoric archaeological finds {{from various}} epochs {{bear witness to}} very early {{settlers}} within what <b>are</b> now <b>Brauweiler’s</b> municipal limits. The oldest finds come from the New Stone Age (3500-1800 BC). The village originally belonged to the greater municipal area of Simmern under Dhaun, a lordly estate held by Saint Maximin’s Abbey, an Imperial monastery, and in which the Waldgraves of Dhaun exercised Vogtei rights. In the Late Middle Ages, <b>Brauweiler</b> <b>was</b> subject to the Sponheim lordship of Koppenstein. The village’s boundary alignment within the Amt of Koppenstein often led to disagreements with the Waldgraves and Rhinegraves, who had their seat at Dhaun, because territorial and judicial rights were not altogether clearly defined. The Rhinegraves’ position, for instance, <b>was</b> that the <b>Brauweiler</b> municipality outside its estate fences had neither its own municipal area nor any rights, but rather {{that it should be}} used together, for its water and grazing, with the inhabitants of Simmern. The Waldgrave and Rhinegrave of Dhaun also claimed fishing, hunting and forestry rights there. All this was argued at the Palatine arbitration tribunal, and it ruled that these rights belonged to the Counts of Sponheim. Brauweiler remained until the end of feudal times a part of the Amt of Koppenstein, which was subject to the Badish Oberamt of Kirchberg. Ecclesiastically, <b>Brauweiler</b> <b>was</b> always subject to the parish of Simmern and Dhaun. After the German lands on the Rhine’s left bank were occupied by French Revolutionary troops and administrative reform on the French Revolutionary model had been begun in 1798, <b>Brauweiler</b> <b>was</b> assigned to the Mairie (“Mayoralty”) of Monzingen. In the time that followed, Monzingen remained Brauweiler’s Amt seat. Since the Amt was dissolved in 1970, however, <b>Brauweiler</b> has <b>been</b> part of the Verbandsgemeinde of Kirn-Land.|$|R

50|$|Richeza {{responded to}} Anno II's ambitions with the formal {{renunciation}} of her possessions in Brauweiler to the monastery of Moselle, while reserving the lifelong {{use of the}} lands. <b>Brauweiler</b> <b>was</b> the center of Ezzonen memory and she wanted it protected regardless of the economic position of the family. Then Richeza went to Saalfeld, where she found similar arrangements {{in favor of the}} Diocese of Würzburg. Anno II protested against these regulations unsuccessfully. At the end Richeza only maintained direct rule over the towns of Saalfeld and Coburg, but retained the right to use until her death seven other locations in the Rhineland with their additional incomes, and 100 silver pounds per year by the Archdiocese of Köln. Richeza died on 21 March 1063 in Saalfeld.|$|R

50|$|Her grave {{was opened}} {{multiple}} times after the {{transfer to the}} Köln Cathedral. The last opening was in 1959 and revealed her bones. According to witnesses, Richeza had a small and graceful stature. Her collarbone showed traces of a fracture. Richeza's relics were located in St. Nicholas church in <b>Brauweiler</b> and <b>were</b> moved to the Klotter parish church in 2002.|$|R
50|$|Clockwise {{from the}} north, <b>Brauweiler’s</b> {{neighbours}} <b>are</b> the municipality of Kellenbach, the municipality of Simmertal, the municipality of Horbach, the municipality of Simmertal (again), the municipality of Hochstetten-Dhaun and the municipality of Heinzenberg. Brauweiler’s municipal area comes within several metres of Hennweiler’s, {{but does not}} actually border on it, while Simmertal’s crescent-shaped municipal area means that it borders on Brauweiler’s in two places, one each side of Horbach.|$|R
5000|$|Langefeld was {{unemployed}} {{until age}} 34, {{when she began}} to teach domestic economy in an establishment of the city of Neuss. From 1935 onwards, she worked as a guard in a so-called Arbeitsanstalt (working institution) in <b>Brauweiler,</b> which <b>was,</b> in fact, a prison for prostitutes, unemployed and homeless women, and other so called [...] "antisocial" [...] women, who were then later imprisoned in concentration camps. From 1937 on, Langefeld {{was a member of the}} Nazi party.|$|R
50|$|It is also {{possible}} that both abbesses did building work on Essen Minster since there are signs of a long term building project. In this case the reference in the <b>Brauweiler</b> Chronicle would <b>be</b> interpreted to indicate that Theophanu completed a construction project begun by Mathilde.|$|R
50|$|In {{the final}} {{the leaders of}} the {{northern}} division met. Grün-Weiß Brauweiler defeated FC Rumeln-Kaldenhausen 4-3 on penalties. Previously the regular time had ended goalless. In the extra time Rumeln-Kaldenhausen had taken an early lead, but Brauweiler had equalized late in the game. It <b>was</b> <b>Brauweiler's</b> only championship.|$|R
50|$|FFC <b>Brauweiler</b> Pulheim 2000 <b>was</b> a German women's {{football}} club based in Pulheim, North Rhine-Westphalia. It was founded when the women's section of Grün-Weiß Brauweiler in 2000 established its own club. The team played its {{last season in}} the Regionalliga, the German third division. Afterwards the clubs disbanded to join 1. FC Köln.|$|R
50|$|Collector {{substations}} {{also exist}} where multiple thermal or hydroelectric power plants of comparable output power are in proximity. Examples for such substations <b>are</b> <b>Brauweiler</b> in Germany and Hradec in the Czech Republic, where power is collected from nearby lignite-fired power plants. If no transformers {{are required for}} increasing the voltage to transmission level, the substation is a switching station.|$|R
50|$|Richeza {{was buried}} in Köln's church of St. Maria ad Gradus and not, as she had wished, in <b>Brauweiler.</b> This <b>was</b> {{prompted}} by Archbishop Anno II, who appealed to an oral agreement with Richeza. The Klotten estate donated her funeral arrangements to St. Maria ad Gradus, whose relationship with Richeza, Hermann II and Anno II is unclear. Possibly St. Maria ad Gradus was an unfinished work of Richeza's brother and completed by Anno II, who wanted to secure part of the Ezzonen patrimony in this way. The Brauweiler Abbey claimed {{the validity of the}} 1051 charter and demanded the remains of the Polish Queen.|$|R
50|$|For most teams, the 1996/97 {{season was}} {{dominated}} by thoughts of qualification for the new single-division Bundesliga. Duisburg were successful in the Northern Group and going into the last game, the team had two points advantage in leading position over Grün-Weiß <b>Brauweiler</b> who <b>were</b> indeed their opponents in this last game, played at Duisburg. However, Brauweiler proved better at subduing their nerves and came away 5-4 winners. In the semi-finals, the team were able to turn a 2-1 defeat from the first leg against FSV Frankfurt into victory with a 3-1 win in the second leg. On 8 June, Duisburg faced Brauweiler again in the final and 5,000 spectators in Homberg witnessed a dramatic game. After 90 minutes the game was scoreless. Shortly after the beginning of extra time, Grings put her team in front but three minutes before the final whistle, Patricia Menge equalized. The decision {{had to go to}} a penalty shootout. With the situation 4:3 for Brauweiler Daniela Arndt missed her kick. Claudia Klein then scored for Brauweiler, thus making her team the German champions.|$|R
