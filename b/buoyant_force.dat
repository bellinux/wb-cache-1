5|$|All {{these facts}} are {{consequences}} of the thermal wind relation. The balance of forces acting on an atmospheric air parcel in the vertical direction is primarily between the gravitational force acting on {{the mass of the}} parcel and the buoyancy force, or the difference in pressure between the top and bottom surfaces of the parcel. Any imbalance between these forces results in the acceleration of the parcel in the imbalance direction: upward if the <b>buoyant</b> <b>force</b> exceeds the weight, and downward if the weight exceeds the buoyancy force. The balance in the vertical direction is referred to as hydrostatic. Beyond the tropics, the dominant forces act in the horizontal direction, and the primary struggle is between the Coriolis force and the pressure gradient force. Balance between these two forces is referred to as geostrophic. Given both hydrostatic and geostrophic balance, one can derive the thermal wind relation: the vertical gradient of the horizontal wind is proportional to the horizontal temperature gradient. If two air masses, one cold and dense to the North and the other hot and less dense to the South, are separated by a vertical boundary and that boundary should be removed, the difference in densities will result in the cold air mass slipping under the hotter and less dense air mass. The Coriolis effect will then cause poleward-moving mass to deviate to the East, while equatorward-moving mass will deviate toward the west. The general trend in the atmosphere is for temperatures to decrease in the poleward direction. As a result, winds develop an eastward component and that component grows with altitude. Therefore, the strong eastward moving jet streams are in part a simple consequence {{of the fact that the}} Equator is warmer than the North and South poles.|$|E

However, {{in the case of}} a basketball, the <b>buoyant</b> <b>force</b> can amount to about 1.5% of the ball's weight. Since buoyancy is directed upwards, it will act to increase the range and height of the ball.|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} gravity on the free flow electrophoretic process was investigated. The {{demonstrated}} effects were then compared with predictions made by mathematical models. Results show that the carrier buffer flow was affected by gravity induced thermal convection and that {{the movement of the}} separating particle streams was affected by gravity induced <b>buoyant</b> <b>forces.</b> It was determined that if gravity induced <b>buoyant</b> <b>forces</b> were included in the mathematical models, then effective predictions of electrophoresis chamber separation performance were possible. The results of tests performed using various methods of electrophoresis using supportive media show that the mobility and the ability to separate were essentially independent of concentration, providing promise of being able to perform electrophoresis with higher inlet concentrations in space...|$|R
40|$|The heating, {{holding and}} cooling {{section of the}} high {{temperature}} region (T 2 ̆ 6 gt; 100 °C) of coiled UHT-sterilisers were simulated three-dimensionally {{to assess the impact}} of centrifugal and <b>buoyant</b> <b>forces</b> on viscous power-law food products. For a wide range of curvature (De= 0 – 500), heat transfer, lethality development and thiamine concentration were analysed. Curvature and pseudoplasticity substantially increase heat transfer and render the axial velocity profile more uniform. As a result, processing times in heater, holder and cooler can be shorter, thus greatly improving thiamine retention. Significant lethality accumulated in the heating section, but the cooling section contributed very little to product sterility. <b>Buoyant</b> <b>forces</b> were shown to be of minor importance in coiled steriliser flow at the current process conditions...|$|R

500|$|The {{story of}} the golden crown {{does not appear in}} the known works of Archimedes. Moreover, the {{practicality}} of the method it describes has been called into question, due to the extreme accuracy with which one would have to measure the water displacement. Archimedes may have instead sought a solution that applied the principle known in hydrostatics as Archimedes' principle, which he describes in his treatise On Floating Bodies. This principle states that a body immersed in a fluid experiences a <b>buoyant</b> <b>force</b> equal to the weight of the fluid it displaces. Using this principle, it would have been possible to compare the density of the crown to that of pure gold by balancing the crown on a scale with a pure gold reference sample of the same weight, then immersing the apparatus in water. The difference in density between the two samples would cause the scale to tip accordingly. Galileo considered it [...] "probable that this method is the same that Archimedes followed, since, besides being very accurate, it is based on demonstrations found by Archimedes himself." [...] In a 12th-century text titled Mappae clavicula there are instructions on how to perform the weighings in the water in order to calculate the percentage of silver used, and thus solve the problem. The Latin poem Carmen de ponderibus et mensuris of the 4th or 5th century describes the use of a hydrostatic balance {{to solve the problem of}} the crown, and attributes the method to Archimedes.|$|E

40|$|For {{many years}} {{modeling}} of double-mode pulsation of classical pulsators was a challenging problem. Inclusion of turbulent convection into pulsation hydrocodes finally led to stable double-mode models. However, {{it was never}} analysed, which factor of turbulent convection is crucial. We show that the double-mode behaviour displayed in the computed models results from incorrect assumptions adopted {{in some of the}} pulsation hydrocodes, namely from the neglect of <b>buoyant</b> <b>forces</b> in convectively stable layers. This leads to significant turbulent energies and consequently to strong eddy-viscous damping in deep, convectively stable layers of the model. Resulting differential reduction of fundamental and first overtone amplitudes favours the occurrence of double-mode pulsation. Once <b>buoyant</b> <b>forces</b> in convectively stable regions are taken into account (as they should), no stable double-mode behaviour is found. The problem of modeling double-mode behaviour of classical pulsators remains open. Comment: 31 pages, 6 figures; accepted for publication in Acta Astronomic...|$|R

Melting at the waterline is an important second order calving process as it undercuts the subaerial ice, leading to collapse.

It is doubtful, however, whether the English amateurs will prove the same draw in Brisbane as the English professional team of 1925." [...] In the same article, Tainton also commented that [...] "Professionalism, of course, is not unknown to Brisbane Soccer. The now defunct Norman Park Club once tried the experiment of payment for players. The scale was 10/- [...] for a win and 5/- for a defeat, but financial difficulties soon ended an innovation many years before its time. Professional football and club solvency cannot go hand in hand with out finance — and that means big 'gates.'
