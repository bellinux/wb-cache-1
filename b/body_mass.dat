5|$|The gray {{mouse lemur}} is {{considered}} overall sexually monomorphic, but seasonally fluctuating sexual dimorphism {{in terms of}} <b>body</b> <b>mass</b> has been recorded. While the <b>body</b> <b>mass</b> of both sexes fluctuates over the year {{as a function of}} food availability, being highest in the rainy season, the differing behavioral repertoires of the sexes lead to sex-specific patterns in this fluctuation. For example, male <b>body</b> <b>mass</b> increases prior to the mating season due to a substantial increase in testes volume that likely enhances the males' success in sperm competition.|$|E
5|$|In the holotype specimen, a female, {{the head}} and body length was 310mm (12.2in), the tail length was 210mm (8.3in), the {{hindfoot}} length was 66.8mm (2.63in), the ear length was 17.5mm (0.69in), and the <b>body</b> <b>mass</b> was 675g (24oz). In another specimen, a male which was captured and released, {{the head and}} body length was about 330mm (13in), the tail length was about 175mm (6.9in), and the <b>body</b> <b>mass</b> was 600g (21oz). Based on these limited data, S.durrelli may be slightly smaller than the brown-tailed mongoose.|$|E
5|$|Balaenids are {{the right}} whales. These animals have very large heads, which can make {{up as much as}} 40% of their <b>body</b> <b>mass,</b> and much of the head is the mouth. This allows them to take in large amounts of water into their mouths, letting them feed more effectively.|$|E

5|$|From {{the data}} he {{collected}} and documented, Aristotle inferred {{quite a number}} of rules relating the life-history features of the live-bearing tetrapods (terrestrial placental mammals) that he studied. Among these correct predictions are the following. Brood size decreases with (adult) <b>body</b> <b>mass,</b> so that an elephant has fewer young (usually just one) per brood than a mouse. Lifespan increases with gestation period, and also with <b>body</b> <b>mass,</b> so that elephants live longer than mice, have a longer period of gestation, and are heavier. As a final example, fecundity decreases with lifespan, so long-lived kinds like elephants have fewer young in total than short-lived kinds like mice.|$|E
5|$|In the {{developing}} world, birth control increases economic growth due to there being fewer dependent children {{and thus more}} women participating in the workforce. Women's earnings, assets, <b>body</b> <b>mass</b> index, and their children's schooling and <b>body</b> <b>mass</b> index all improve with greater access to birth control. Family planning via the use of modern birth control {{is one of the}} most cost-effective health interventions. For every dollar spent, the United Nations estimates that two to six dollars are saved. These cost savings are related to preventing unplanned pregnancies and decreasing the spread of sexually transmitted illnesses. While all methods are beneficial financially, the use of copper IUDs resulted in the greatest savings.|$|E

5|$|Lemurs {{have low}} basal {{metabolic}} rates (BMR), which helps them to conserve energy {{during the dry}} season, when water and food are scarce. They can optimize their energy use by lowering their metabolic rate to 20% below the values predicted for mammals of similar <b>body</b> <b>mass.</b> The red-tailed sportive lemur (Lepilemur ruficaudatus), for instance, reportedly {{has one of the}} lowest metabolic rates among mammals. Its low metabolic rate may be linked to its generally folivorous diet and relatively small <b>body</b> <b>mass.</b> Lemurs exhibit behavioral adaptations to complement this trait, including sunning behaviors, hunched sitting, group huddling, and nest sharing, in order to reduce heat loss and conserve energy. Dwarf lemurs and mouse lemurs exhibit seasonal cycles of dormancy to conserve energy. Before dry season, they will accumulate fat in white adipose tissue located {{at the base of the}} tail and hind legs, doubling their weight. At the end of the dry season, their <b>body</b> <b>mass</b> may fall to half of what it was prior to the dry season. Lemurs that do not experience states of dormancy are also able to shut down aspects of their metabolism for energy conservation.|$|E

40|$|While {{metabolic}} theory predicts {{variance in}} population density within communities depending on population average <b>body</b> <b>masses,</b> the ecological stoichiometry concept relates density variation across communities to varying resource stoichiometry. Using a data set including biomass densities of 4959 populations of soil invertebrates across 48 forest sites we combined these two frameworks. We analyzed how the scaling of biomass densities with population-averaged <b>body</b> <b>masses</b> systematically interacts with stoichiometric variables. Simplified analyses employing either only <b>body</b> <b>masses</b> or only resource stoichiometry are highly context sensitive and yield variable and often misleading results. Our findings provide {{strong evidence that}} analyses of ecological state variables should integrate allometric and stoichiometric variables to explain deviations from predicted allometric scaling and avoid erroneous conclusions. In consequence, our study provides an important step towards unifying two prominent ecological theories, metabolic theory and ecological stoichiometry...|$|R

5|$|A small, reddish-brown carnivore, Salanoia durrelli is {{characterized}} by broad feet with prominent pads, reddish- underparts, and broad, robust teeth, among other differences from the brown-tailed mongoose. In the only two weighed specimens, <b>body</b> <b>mass</b> was 600g and 675g (21 and 24oz). It is a marsh-dwelling animal that may feed on crustaceans and mollusks. The Lac Alaotra area is a threatened ecosystem, and S.durrelli may also be endangered by competition with introduced species.|$|E
5|$|Although Cuban iguanas {{typically}} remain {{still for}} long periods of time and have a slow lumbering gait due to their <b>body</b> <b>mass,</b> they are capable of quick bursts of speed for short distances. Younger animals are more arboreal and will seek refuge in trees, which they can climb with great agility. The animal is a capable swimmer and will take to nearby water if threatened. When cornered they can bite and lash their tails in defense.|$|E
5|$|Decompression {{sickness}} and arterial gas embolism in recreational diving {{are associated with}} certain demographic, environmental, and dive style factors. A statistical study published in 2005 tested potential risk factors: age, gender, <b>body</b> <b>mass</b> index, smoking, asthma, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, previous decompression illness, years since certification, dives in the last year, number of diving days, number of dives in a repetitive series, last dive depth, nitrox use, and drysuit use. No significant associations with risk of decompression sickness or arterial gas embolism were found for asthma, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, smoking, or <b>body</b> <b>mass</b> index. Increased depth, previous DCI, larger number of consecutive days diving, and being male were associated with higher risk for decompression {{sickness and}} arterial gas embolism. Nitrox and drysuit use, greater frequency of diving in the past year, increasing age, and years since certification were associated with lower risk, possibly as indicators of more extensive training and experience.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Weight of a macro body is its {{acceleration}} due to gravity, in gravitational units, {{towards another}} larger macro body. During variations in its temperature, a macro <b>body</b> changes its <b>mass</b> (matter content). Since mass {{is a factor}} in both the equations, to determine the gravitational attraction and the acceleration of a body, body’s acceleration due to gravity does not change by variation in <b>body’s</b> <b>mass.</b> However, “Hypothesis on Matter ” advocates a mechanism, which causes additional changes in the gravitational attraction over and above the changes caused by changes in a <b>body’s</b> <b>mass.</b> Thus, it is logical to find that a macro body weighs less, when hot compared to its weight in cooler state...|$|R

25|$|A {{macroscopic}} {{body that}} is stationary (i.e. a reference frame has been chosen to correspond to the body's center of momentum) may have various kinds of internal energy at the molecular or atomic level, which may be regarded as kinetic energy, due to molecular translation, rotation, and vibration, electron translation and spin, and nuclear spin. These all contribute to the <b>body's</b> <b>mass,</b> as provided by the special theory of relativity. When discussing movements of a macroscopic body, the kinetic energy referred to is usually that of the macroscopic movement only. However all internal energies of all types contribute to <b>body's</b> <b>mass,</b> inertia, and total energy.|$|R

5|$|The most {{significant}} {{adverse effects of}} long-term weightlessness are muscle atrophy and deterioration of the skeleton, or spaceflight osteopenia. Other significant effects include fluid redistribution, a slowing of the cardiovascular system, decreased production of red blood cells, balance disorders, and a weakening of the immune system. Lesser symptoms include loss of <b>body</b> <b>mass,</b> nasal congestion, sleep disturbance, excess flatulence, and puffiness of the face.
