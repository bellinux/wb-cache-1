40|$|The paper {{presents}} an experimental analysis of tracking {{the path of}} the cracks and crack growth in strengthened or repair reinforced concrete short corbels <b>bonded</b> by carbon <b>fiber</b> <b>fabrics</b> under static and dynamic loads. The reinforced short concrete corbel is a used precast element, for industrial buildings and structures. In fact, their functioning interestingly unconventional is compared to classical beam type elements. Then the effects of bending and shearing are combined in this case. The horizontal reinforced steel is localized to resist to tensile strength induced in bending top and a transversal strength-absorbing contribution. The introduction of carbon fiber composite in the field of Civil Engineering allows to strengthen or repair reinforced concrete structures using adhesive. So the carbon fiber material has many advantages as its low weight, flexibility, easier handling and also interesting physicochemical properties. However maintenance of civil engineering works is to protect them by ensuring better sealing or limiting corrosion. Then strengthening is to repair structures by using bonding technique to compensate their rigidity loss and limit the cracking. This allows to improve their performance and durability. Bonding of composite material in tensile zone of corbel retrieves most tensile stress and allows the structure to extend their load-bearing capacity. The local behavior of the structure is measured by means of the extensometer technique based on electrical strain gauges. This technique allowed to measure strains of steel, carbon <b>fiber</b> <b>fabrics</b> and concrete. The results of this investigation showed that strengthened reinforced concrete corbel <b>bonded</b> by carbon <b>fiber</b> <b>fabrics</b> can improve the ultimate load to twice and stiffens less than a third. The ultimate load, strain and displacement of the specimen are compared to reference experimental model of monotonic and cyclic applied loads. The success of strengthening depends strongly on surface preparation conditions. The cracking mechanisms and collapse modes under static and dynamic loadings are presented. The strengthened reinforced concrete short corbel behavior can be presented in three areas: overall elastic area, crack propagation area and opening of diagonal crack area...|$|R

30|$|Composite or {{laminated}} fabrics offer two advantages. First, they {{eliminate the}} labor involved in sequential upholstering of fabric layers, and second, they prevent exposure of underlying cushioning materials by ‘crack-opening’. When the multi-layered barrier fabric {{is exposed to}} flames, the heat is taken away by the outer coating or layer of the composite fabric, leaving the underlying substrate to which the coating or outer layer is laminated intact and preventing the involvement of underlying cushioning materials in the fire. For example, when a glass <b>fiber</b> <b>fabric</b> coated with polyvinyl chloride is exposed to flames, the polymer does not shrink away from the underlying glass <b>fiber</b> <b>fabric.</b> Instead, it softens and flows into the interstices of the glass <b>fiber</b> <b>fabric.</b> Laminated/coated fabrics eliminate the air space between the layers of barrier fabric and maintain the aesthetics of the exterior fabric while still providing better fire performance ([Schumann & Hartzell 1989]; [Decabromodiphenylether 2005]).|$|R

Reinforced concrete structures deteriorate with use and over a period of time, due to several factors such as physical and chemical aging, corrosion, service loads exceeding design loads and inadequate durability. One of the large number of strengthening techniques used for rehabilitation of concrete structures is the method of using thin glass and carbon <b>fiber</b> <b>fabrics,</b> which are <b>bonded</b> externally to the surface of concrete. The study is focused on investigating the feasibility of using fabrics with vertical glass fibers as tools for shear strengthening and carbon <b>fiber</b> <b>fabrics</b> for flexural strengthening of concrete beams. The experimental study involved testing of two unreinforced control beams and seven other beams with different composite <b>fiber</b> <b>fabric</b> configurations, in four-point bending to failure. An analytical model for predicting the behavior of fiber wrapped beams, based on strain compatibility and equilibrium, is also included in the study. The composite fiber wraps proved to be effective in enhancing the flexural capacity of the concrete beams, however the vertical glass shear reinforcement failed to upgrade the shear capacity of the concrete beams...|$|R

Different weight fractions (0 to 2. 0 wt%) of continuous nanofiber layers were sandwiched with carbon <b>fiber</b> <b>fabric</b> preform to prepare polymer matrix hybrid nanocomposites by a compression molding technique. It {{was found that}} layers with 1. 1 wt% content of semi-aligned nanofibers significantly enhance the bending strength by 175 % and the modulus by 200 %. The greater interfacial adhesion of the high surface area of the nanofibers significantly increases the interlaminar shear strength by 190 %. The improvement in the mechanical properties of the polymer composites {{is due to the}} modification of the matrix properties, crack deflection and debonding. The high surface area and voids that form around the carbon nanofibers can absorb higher fracture energy. However, nanofiber content greater than 1. 1 wt% at the interlaminar region of the composites has negative effects on the overall mechanical properties of the hybrid composites. The thick nanofiber layers are believed to be acting as micron size carbon fibers, which results in a downward trend in the bending properties. The present strategy for the preparation of high performance carbon fiber hybrid polymer composites utilizing electrospun continuous carbon nanofibers at the interlaminar region provides a promising approach for improving the properties of composites for different application...|$|R

In the throughair process, hot air is passed through the fibrous web to heat and melt polymer fibers. Molten polymer subsequently flows to the point of contact between any two fibers to produce a bond. Two different modelling strategies are adapted to produce a comprehensive understanding of the through-air bonding process. In macroscale modelling, a CFD model is developed treating the whole web as a porous media in order to investigate the effect of process parameters. Results reveal that the time required to heat and melt the fibers decreases with the increasing porosity of the web and the velocity of hot air.

METHODS: Clinical crowns of single-rooted maxillary premolars were cut off at the cemento-enamel junction. Canals were prepared with Gates Glidden drills up to size 4. No additional post-space preparations were made. Roots were embedded in acrylic and canal entrances were standardized (depth 2 mm, diameter 1. 75 mm). Three groups of 14 samples were treated as follows: (1) custom-made glass FRC post (EverStick Post); fibers 5 mm deep in the canal, (2) similar post-system as (1) with incorporation of {{a new type of}} glass <b>fiber</b> <b>fabric,</b> (3) no <b>fiber</b> reinforcement (control). Posts were cemented with resin cement (Panavia F). Resin composite crowns (Filtek Z 250) were made using an anatomically formed mold. Static load until fracture was applied using a universal loading device with a cylindrical bar (diameter 2 mm) with a crosshead speed of 5 mm/minute (loading angle: 30 degrees to the tooth long-axis).
