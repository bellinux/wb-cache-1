5|$|Some plants, {{notably the}} grasses, use indigestible silica (and many plants use other {{relatively}} indigestible {{materials such as}} lignin) to defend themselves against vertebrate and invertebrate herbivores. Plants take up silicon from the soil and deposit it in their tissues {{in the form of}} solid silica phytoliths. These mechanically reduce the digestibility of plant tissue, causing rapid wear to vertebrate teeth and insect mandibles, and are effective against herbivores above and <b>below</b> <b>ground.</b> The mechanism may offer future sustainable pest control strategies.|$|E
5|$|The {{primitive}} early mines of Cornwall and Devon {{probably were}} operated by local extended families, with the men, {{women and children}} all working. Men and boys probably worked both above the surface and <b>below</b> <b>ground,</b> and women and girls worked only above ground; there is no archaeological evidence for women and children working underground in Bronze Age Britain, although some mines from the period contain tunnels so small that only children or very short adults could have worked in them.|$|E
5|$|The {{sale of the}} {{building}} land at North End to conservationists to form the Hampstead Heath extension in 1904, meant {{a reduction in the}} number of residents who might use the station there. Work continued <b>below</b> <b>ground</b> at a reduced pace, and the platform tunnels and some passenger circulation tunnels were excavated, but North End station was abandoned in 1906 before the lift and stair shafts were dug and before a surface building was constructed.|$|E

30|$|There are {{two primary}} types of {{aquifers}} in the site. This {{first one is}} an unconfined aquifer, which is primarily the pore water in the third stratum. The water table depth is commonly 0.60 to 2.3  m <b>below</b> the <b>ground.</b> The second one is the confined aquifer. There is a weak confined aquifer in the fifth stratum, which is consisted of clay with large amount of lime concretions. Its water head is around 12.0 to 12.5  m <b>below</b> the <b>ground,</b> and it fluctuates between 0.5  m and 1.0  m annually. Another confined aquifer is deposited in the limestone bedrock.

5|$|The {{street level}} {{interchange}} between the GNP and CLR involving {{two sets of}} lifts was considered a weakness in the network. A <b>below</b> <b>ground</b> subway connection was considered in 1907.

5|$|The {{subway station}} at Porter is, at 105 feet <b>below</b> <b>ground</b> level, the deepest in the MBTA system. Porter's unusual depth {{is due to}} the MBTA's {{decision}} to build the station in bedrock rather than soft clay, saving time and money in the construction process. Passengers reach Red Line platforms via a series of escalators, stairs totalling 199 steps, or a set of elevators. The longest single span of the escalators is 143feet, the longest in the MBTA system. In 2005, a man was killed when his sweatshirt tangled {{in the bottom of the}} escalator.|$|E
5|$|The {{tower was}} terraced {{into the side}} of a mound, so the {{northern}} side of the basement is partially <b>below</b> <b>ground</b> level. As was typical of most keeps, the bottom floor was an undercroft used for storage. One of the rooms contained a well. Although the layout has remained the same since the tower's construction, the interior of the basement dates mostly from the 18thcentury when the floor was lowered and the pre-existing timber vaults were replaced with brick counterparts. The basement is lit through small slits.|$|E

5|$|Apart from Bank, {{which was}} {{completely}} <b>below</b> <b>ground,</b> all stations had buildings designed by Harry Bell Measures. They were single-storey structures {{to allow for}} future commercial development above and had elevations faced in beige terracotta. Each station had lifts manufactured by the Sprague Electric Company in New York. The lifts were provided {{in a variety of}} sizes and configurations to suit the passenger flow at each station. Generally they operated in sets of two or three in a shared shaft. Station tunnel walls were finished in plain white ceramic tiles and lit by electric arc lamps. The electricity to run the trains and the stations was supplied from the power station at Wood Lane at 5,000V AC which was converted at sub-stations along the route to 550V DC to power the trains via a third rail system.|$|E
5|$|Banksia violacea {{is one of}} a {{small number}} of Banksia species that has both lignotuberous and non-lignotuberous populations. In both cases, plants are adapted to release their aerial seed bank {{following}} a bushfire, ensuring seedlings are established on clear and relatively fertile ground; however the possession of a lignotuber makes plants much less reliant on fire regime for population maintenance and regeneration, as maternal plants are not killed by bushfire, but resprout from <b>below</b> <b>ground</b> level. Lignotuberous plants generally occur among the north-eastern populations, in the vicinity of Woodanilling. An investigation into the biogeography of these plants failed to find any vegetative, climatic or other environmental factors associated with the possession of a lignotuber.|$|E
5|$|Encompassing , the Seeley G. Mudd Chemistry Building stood {{three stories}} tall.

Other offices {{on the first floor}} were lit via skylights. The stairwells in Mudd were designed with the purpose of discouraging students from passing through lab spaces to get {{from one side of the}} building to the other. In spite of this, Michael J. Crosbie reported in Architecture in 1986 that students had taken to passing through the building as a shortcut instead of going around it. Furnishings and carpeting in the building were deep blue and rust-colored.|$|E

5|$|In November 1891, notice {{was given}} {{of a private}} bill that would be {{presented}} to Parliament {{for the construction of}} the Baker Street and Waterloo Railway (BS, now the Bakerloo line). The railway was planned to run entirely underground from Marylebone to Elephant & Castle via Baker Street and Waterloo. The route was approved in 1900. Construction commenced in August 1898 under the direction of Sir Benjamin Baker, W.R. Galbraith and R.F. Church. The works were carried out by Perry & Company of Tregedar Works, Bow. Oxford Circus was altered <b>below</b> <b>ground</b> following a Board of Trade inspection; at the end of 1905, the first test trains began running. The official opening of the BS by Sir Edwin Cornwall took place on 10 March 1906. The first section of the BS was between Baker Street and Lambeth North, then known as Kennington Road.|$|E
5|$|In total, 36% of all {{materials}} and labour costs were spent in Wales, with approximately 1,000tonnes (157,500 stone) of Welsh slate used. The environmental {{features of the}} building have allowed energy savings of between 30% and 50% compared to buildings without these features. The features include 27 pipes that were drilled 100m <b>below</b> <b>ground,</b> so that during cold spells, water is pumped through the pipes and heated to 14°C by geothermal energy. The hot water is then pumped {{back up to the}} slate floor to warm the building to a constant temperature. In warm spells, the same system helps to keep the building cool. A biomass boiler was installed to use wood chips from recycled waste wood to heat the building, and rainwater is collected from the roof to flush the toilets in the building.|$|E
5|$|Located at the {{junction}} of two earlier tube railway schemes, the station was opened in 1906 by the Great Northern, Piccadilly and Brompton Railway (GNP). The station entrances and <b>below</b> <b>ground</b> circulation were largely reconstructed for the introduction of escalators {{and the opening of}} Central line platforms in 1933, making the station the only interchange between the lines. Before 1994, Holborn was the northern terminus of the short and little-frequented Piccadilly line branch to Aldwych and two platforms originally used for this service are disused. One of the disused platforms has been used for location filming when a London Underground station platform is needed.|$|E
