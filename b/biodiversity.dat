5|$|Bulgaria {{is one of}} the {{countries}} with highest <b>biodiversity</b> in Europe.|$|E
5|$|Habitat {{destruction}} {{represents a}} threat to <b>biodiversity</b> in Croatia, as developed and agricultural land is expanded into previous natural habitats, while habitat fragmentation occurs as roads are created or expanded. A further threat to <b>biodiversity</b> is the introduction of invasive species, with Caulerpa racemosa and C. taxifolia identified as especially problematic ones. The invasive algae are monitored and regularly removed to protect the benthic habitat. Agricultural monocultures have also been identified as {{a threat to}} <b>biodiversity.</b>|$|E
5|$|There is less <b>biodiversity</b> {{within the}} mined area; in particular, the {{reclaimed}} and reforested areas have less <b>biodiversity</b> than the areas which have undergone a natural succession.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of the wetland nature of the Levels, the area {{contains}} a rich <b>biodiversity</b> of national and international importance. It supports a vast variety of plant and bird species and is an important feeding ground for birds and includes 32Sites of Special Scientific Interest, of which 12 are also Special Protection Areas. The area has been extensively studied for its <b>biodiversity</b> and heritage, and has a growing tourism industry.|$|E

5|$|Malaysia {{signed the}} Rio Convention on Biological Diversity on 12 June 1993, {{and became a}} party to the {{convention}} on 24 June 1994. It has subsequently produced a National <b>Biodiversity</b> Strategy and Action Plan, which was received by the convention on 16 April 1998. The country is megadiverse with a high number of species and high levels of endemism. It is estimated to contain 20percent of the world's animal species. High levels of endemism are found on the diverse forests of Borneo's mountains, as species are isolated from each other by lowland forest. There are about 210 mammal species in the country. Over 620 species of birds have been recorded in Peninsular Malaysia, with many endemic to the mountains there. A high number of endemic bird species are also found in Malaysian Borneo. 250 reptile species have been recorded in the country, with about 150 species of snakes and 80 species of lizards. There are about 150 species of frogs, and thousands of insect species. Malaysia's exclusive economic zone is 1.5 times larger than its land area, and some of its waters are in the Coral Triangle, a <b>biodiversity</b> hotspot. The waters around Sipadan island are the most biodiverse in the world. Bordering East Malaysia, the Sulu Sea is a <b>biodiversity</b> hotspot, with around 600 coral species and 1200 fish species. The unique <b>biodiversity</b> of Malaysian Caves always attracts lovers of ecotourism from all over the world.|$|E

5|$|The International Association for Plant Taxonomy (IAPT) {{promotes}} {{an understanding}} of plant <b>biodiversity,</b> facilitates international communication of research between botanists, and oversees matters of uniformity and stability in plant names.

Its current president, since 2017, is Patrick S.

5|$|The semi-natural, unfertilized {{pastures}} {{formed by}} traditional agricultural methods in Europe were managed by grazing and mowing. Because the ecological {{impact of this}} land management strategy {{is similar to the}} impact of such natural disturbances as a wildfire, this agricultural system shares many beneficial characteristics with a natural habitat, including the promotion of <b>biodiversity.</b> This strategy is declining in Europe today due to the intensification of agriculture. The mechanized and chemical methods used are causing <b>biodiversity</b> to decline.|$|E

5|$|The <b>biodiversity</b> {{of local}} oceanic fauna {{is not well}} understood.

25|$|Reconciliation ecologists believe {{increasing}} <b>biodiversity</b> within human dominated landscapes {{will help}} to save global <b>biodiversity.</b> This is sometimes preferable to traditional conservation {{because it does not}} impair human use of the landscape and therefore may be more acceptable to stakeholders. However, not only will it encourage <b>biodiversity</b> in the areas where it takes place, but many scholars cite other benefits of including <b>biodiversity</b> in human landscapes on both global conservation activities and human well-being.|$|E
25|$|Thus, {{the moral}} value of one-celled organisms, {{as well as}} some multi-cellular organisms, and natural {{entities}} like a river, is only in the benefit they provide to sentient beings. Similarly, utilitarianism places no direct intrinsic value on <b>biodiversity,</b> although the benefits that <b>biodiversity</b> bring to sentient beings may mean that, on utilitarianism, <b>biodiversity</b> ought to be maintained in general.|$|E
25|$|Many anti-GMO activists {{argue that}} the use of GM crops {{decreases}} <b>biodiversity</b> amongst plants. Livestock <b>biodiversity</b> is also threatened by the modernization of agriculture and the focus on more productive major breeds. Therefore, efforts have been made by governments and non-governmental organizations to conserve livestock <b>biodiversity</b> through strategies such as Cryoconservation of animal genetic resources.|$|E
25|$|Urban ecology can be {{included}} {{under the umbrella}} of reconciliation ecology and it tackles <b>biodiversity</b> in cities, the most extreme of human-dominated landscapes. Cities occupy less than 3% of global surface area, but are responsible for a majority of carbon emissions, residential water use, and wood use. Cities also have unique climatic conditions such as the urban heat island effect, which can greatly affect <b>biodiversity.</b> There is a growing trend among city managers to take <b>biodiversity</b> into account when planning city development, especially in rapidly growing cities. Cities often have surprisingly high plant <b>biodiversity</b> due to their normally high degree of habitat heterogeneity and high numbers of gardens and green spaces cultivated to include a large variety of species. However, these species are often not native, and {{a large part of the}} total urban <b>biodiversity</b> is usually made up of exotic species.|$|E
