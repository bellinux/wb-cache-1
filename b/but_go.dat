25|$|Alwar is {{the first}} major city when {{travelling}} from Delhi en route to Rajasthan. Its heritage is a major draw for tourists. The fort of Alwar, known as Bala fort, is about 595 meters high. It was constructed in the tenth century, making it the oldest building in the city. Despite {{being one of the}} princely states of Rajputana, the rulers here had left no stone unturned in building many forts. Seeing the fort of Baala, there is an impression that sometimes {{it would have been a}} very inaccessible fort, where there would have been many turrets, a large gate, a temple and a residential area. There is a state museum in the City Palace, where there is a rare collection of miniature paintings. Near the corner are Mousi's umbrella, Vinay Palace, Vijay Mandir Palace and Moti Dungri. In other tourist spots, the lake is situated in Silasedh Lake and Jaisamand Lake. Sariska, which is at a distance of 36 kilometers, after rain, for its green trees and greenery of bushes, is seen differently. In its beautiful valley, visions are visible with blue cow, chital, wild pig, other animals. Sariska is counted in old Tiger-projects. Due to poaching sighting tigers has unfortunately become rare. Do not be discouraged <b>but</b> <b>go</b> Sariska, which is still full of beautiful natural scenery and colorful birds. Historical significance of the nearby Biratnagar or Barrath, is due to the stupa and established inscription made by Emperor Ashoka the Great. According to legendary belief, Pandavas spent some time in their ignorance here. There is a large number of religious devotees on the Pandupole-Bhardhari Loktirtha. You can also experience unlimited peace by traveling here. Alwar is also famous for its famous sweet kalakand (Mauva of Alwar), this milk made from milk is not only nearby but also famous. The items made of paper-potter are also very much appreciated here.|$|E

500|$|Othnielosaurus (previously {{under the}} names Laosaurus, Nanosaurus, and Othnielia) has {{typically}} {{been regarded as}} a hypsilophodont ornithopod, {{a member of a}} nebulous and poorly defined group of small, running herbivorous dinosaurs. This was challenged by Robert Bakker et al. in 1990. In their description of the new taxon Drinker nisti, they split Othnielia into two species (O. rex and O. consors) and placed [...] "othnieliids" [...] as more basal than hypsilophodontids. With recent analyses suggesting a paraphyletic Hypsilophodontidae, the general idea of [...] "othnielids" [...] as basal to other hypsilophodonts has been supported, although Drinker has been controversial because virtually nothing new has been published on it since its description. Other basal ornithopods have sometimes been linked to Othnielosaurus, particularly Hexinlusaurus, considered by at least one author to be a species of [...] "Othnielia", O. multidens. New studies concur with the hypothesis that Othnielosaurus is more basal than other traditional hypsilophodonts, <b>but</b> <b>go</b> even farther and remove the genus from Ornithopoda and the larger group Cerapoda, which also includes Ceratopsians and pachycephalosaurs.|$|E
500|$|AM2 {{developed}} what Sega {{hoped would}} be the Dreamcast's killer app, Shenmue, a [...] "revenge epic {{in the tradition of}} Chinese cinema." [...] The action-adventure title involved the quest of protagonist Ryo Hazuki to avenge his father's murder, but its main selling point was its rendition of the Japanese city of Yokosuka, which included a level of detail considered unprecedented for a video game. Incorporating a simulated day/night cycle with variable weather, non-player characters with regular schedules, and the ability to pick up and examine detailed objects (also introducing the Quick-time event in its modern form), Shenmue went over budget and was rumored to have cost Sega over $50 million. Originally planned as the first installment in an 11-part saga, Shenmue was eventually downsized to a trilogy—and only one sequel was ever released.s development |publisher=Polygon |date=March 19, 2014 |accessdate=December 17, 2014 |quote=Yu Suzuki: The biggest challenge we encountered was project management.

It's the ultimate Dreamcast fanboy's pilgrimage, and as I took my first steps down Dobuita Street and recognized locations I'd walked past countless times before—Kurita's Military Store, Mary's Embroidery Store and the parking lot where Ryo honed his fighting skills—I couldn't help <b>but</b> <b>go</b> a little dewy eyed."

In addition to the mixed reception for Shenmue, IGN's Travis Fahs stated that [...] "the [...] era wasn't as kind to [...] as earlier years"—citing (among others) F355 Challenge as an [...] "acclaimed" [...] arcade title that [...] "didn't do much at home", and Genki's port of Virtua Fighter 3 as inferior to the arcade version, [...] "which was already a couple years old and never as popular as its predecessors."s view, buyers of modern coin-op conversions have the right to expect more from their investments than unenhanced facsimiles. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006102942/http://www.edge-online.com/review/virtua-fighter-3tb-review/ |archivedate=October 6, 2014 }} The Virtua Fighter series would experience a [...] "tremendous comeback" [...] with the universally acclaimed Virtua Fighter 4—which saw a console release exclusively on PS2.|$|E
