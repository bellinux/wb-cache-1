Males had higher rates than females for all measures of drinking in the past month: any alcohol use (57.5% vs. 45%), <b>binge</b> drinking (30.8% vs. 15.1%), and heavy alcohol use (10.5% vs. 3.3%), and males were twice as likely as females to have met the criteria for alcohol dependence or abuse in the past year (10.5% vs. 5.1%).|$|E

5|$|Certain {{physical}} and mental illnesses and the pharmaceutical substances used to treat them can increase risk of obesity. Medical illnesses that increase obesity risk include several rare genetic syndromes (listed above) {{as well as some}} congenital or acquired conditions: hypothyroidism, Cushing's syndrome, growth hormone deficiency, and the eating disorders: <b>binge</b> eating disorder and night eating syndrome. However, obesity is not regarded as a psychiatric disorder, and therefore is not listed in the DSM-IVR as a psychiatric illness. The risk of overweight and obesity is higher in patients with psychiatric disorders than in persons without psychiatric disorders.|$|E
40|$|Fructose {{accounts}} for 10 % of daily calories in the American diet. Fructose, but not glucose, given intracerebroventricularly stimulates homeostatic feeding mechanisms within the hypothalamus; however, {{little is known}} about how fructose affects hedonic feeding centers. Repeated ingestion of sucrose, a disaccharide of fructose and glucose, increases neuronal activity in hedonic centers, the nucleus accumbens (NAc) shell and core, but not the hypothalamus. Rats given glucose in the intermittent access model (IAM) display signatures of hedonic feeding including <b>bingeing</b> and altered DA receptor (R) numbers within the NAc. Here we examined whether substituting fructose for glucose in this IAM produces <b>bingeing</b> behavior, alters DA Rs and activates hedonic and homeostatic feeding centers. Following long-term (21 -day) exposure to the IAM, rats given 8 - 12 % fructose solutions displayed fructose <b>bingeing</b> but unaltered DA D 1 R or D 2 R number. Fructose <b>bingeing</b> rats, as compared to chow <b>bingeing</b> controls, exhibited reduced NAc shell neuron activation, as determined by c-Fos-immunoreactivity (Fos-IR). This activation was negatively correlated with orexin (Orx) neuron activation in the lateral hypothalamus/perifornical area (LH/PeF), a brain region linking homeostatic to hedonic feeding centers. Following short-term (2 -day) access to the IAM, rats exhibited <b>bingeing</b> but unchanged Fos-IR, suggesting only long-term fructose <b>bingeing</b> increases Orx release. In long-term fructose <b>bingeing</b> rats, pretreatment with the Ox 1 R antagonist SB- 334867 (30 mg/kg; i. p.) equally reduced fructose <b>bingeing</b> and chow intake, resulting in a 50 % reduction in calories. Similarly, in control rats, SB- 334867 reduced chow/caloric intake by 60 %. Thus, in the IAM, Ox 1 Rs appear to regulate feeding based on caloric content rather than palatability. Overall, our results, in combination with the literature, suggest individual monosaccharides activate distinct neuronal circuits to promote feeding behavior. Specifically, long-term fructose <b>bingeing</b> activates a hyperphagic circuit composed in part of NAc shell and LH/PeF Orx neurons...|$|R
40|$|AbstractDaily {{intermittent}} {{access to}} sugar solutions results in intense bouts of sugar intake (i. e. <b>bingeing)</b> in rats. <b>Bingeing</b> on sucrose, a disaccharide of glucose and fructose, {{has been associated}} with a “primed” mesolimbic dopamine (DA) pathway. Recent studies suggest glucose and fructose engage brain reward and energy-sensing mechanisms in opposing ways and may drive sucrose intake through unique neuronal circuits. Here, we examined in male Sprague–Dawley rats whether or not (1) intermittent access to isocaloric solutions of sucrose, glucose or fructose results in distinctive sugar-bingeing profiles and (2) previous sugar <b>bingeing</b> alters cocaine locomotor activation and/or reward, as determined by conditioned place preference (CPP). To encourage <b>bingeing,</b> rats were given 24 -h access to water and 12 -h-intermittent access to chow plus an intermittent bottle that contained water (control) or 8 % solutions of sucrose, glucose or fructose for 9 days, followed by ad libitum chow diet and a 10 -day cocaine (15 mg/kg; i. p.) CPP paradigm. By day 4 of the sugar-bingeing diet, sugar <b>bingeing</b> in the fructose group surpassed the glucose group, with the sucrose group being intermediate. All three sugar groups had similar chow and water intake throughout the diet. In contrast, controls exhibited chow <b>bingeing</b> by day 5 without altering water intake. Similar magnitudes of cocaine CPP were observed in rats with a history of sucrose, fructose or chow (control) <b>bingeing.</b> Notably, the glucose-bingeing rats did not demonstrate a significant cocaine CPP despite showing similar cocaine-induced locomotor activity as the other diet groups. Overall, these results show that fructose and glucose, the monosaccharide components of sucrose, produce divergent degrees of <b>bingeing</b> and cocaine reward...|$|R

5|$|It is {{considered}} that overeating {{and lack of}} muscle tone is {{the main cause of}} a beer belly, rather than beer consumption. A 2004 study, however, found a link between <b>binge</b> drinking and a beer belly. But with most overconsumption, it is more a problem of improper exercise and overconsumption of carbohydrates than the product itself. Several diet books quote beer as having an undesirably high glycemic index of 110, the same as maltose; however, the maltose in beer undergoes metabolism by yeast during fermentation so that beer consists mostly of water, hop oils and only trace amounts of sugars, including maltose.|$|E

40|$|Disordered eating {{attitudes and}} {{behaviors}} are prevalent among college age women (Drewnowski, Yee, Kurth, 2 ̆ 6 Krahn, 1994), but the impact of specific domains of eating pathology on young women’s lives has not been adequately studied. This study examined the relationships among domains of eating disordered symptomatology and measures of general psychopathology {{and quality of life}} in a nonclinical sample of female college students. One-hundred and six women representing the range of eating disorder pathology, from asymptomatic to subthreshold eating disorders, were selected based on a survey sent to freshman women. Results indicated that disordered eating attitudes (i. e., body dissatisfaction, overconcern with eating, weight, and shape, and preoccupation with eating, weight, and shape), dietary restriction, and <b>bingeing</b> were all associated with increased general psychopathology and decreased quality of life. Specifically, disordered eating attitudes, dietary restriction, and <b>bingeing</b> predicted increased negative affect and anxiety, and decreased general satisfaction. In addition, disordered eating attitudes and <b>bingeing</b> predicted decreased interpersonal competence. <b>Bingeing</b> was the only predictor of increased substance use. An examination of the unique prediction of each domain of disordered eating revealed that <b>bingeing</b> predicted increased substance use above and beyond dietary restriction and disordered eating attitudes, and disordered eating attitudes predicted increased negative affect and anxiety and decreased general satisfaction over and above dietary restriction and <b>bingeing.</b> These relationships between eating disordered symptomatology and general psychopathology/quality of life were generally linear {{with the exception of the}} relationship between dietary restriction and general satisfaction. When controlling for disordered eating attitudes and <b>bingeing,</b> this relationship was nonlinear such that at below average levels of dietary restriction, increased restriction was associated with increased general satisfaction, but at above average levels of dietary restriction, increased restriction was associated with decreased general satisfaction. Findings stress the importance of intervening with women experiencing subthreshold disordered eating {{attitudes and behaviors}} to minimize the negative impact of such eating disorder pathology on the lives of young women...|$|R

The extent to which Body Mass Index (BMI) and these body change strategies predicted each other over an 8 -month period was evaluated. The role of pressure from parents and peers to lose weight, increase weight, or increase muscles was also evaluated. After controlling for the Time 1 level of each variable, only <b>bingeing,</b> and use of food supplements were predicted by other Time 1 body change variables. <b>Bingeing</b> at Time 1, and a combination of all of the other variables predicted <b>bingeing</b> at Time 2; use of food supplements and <b>bingeing</b> at Time 1 predicted the use of food supplements at Time 2. Perceived pressure from parents and peers to lose weight at Time 1 predicted strategies to lose weight at Time 2; perceived pressure from parents and peers to increase weight at Time 1 predicted strategies to increase weight at Time 2; and perceived pressure to lose weight, increase weight, and increase muscles at Time 1 predicted the use of food supplements at Time 2. These results indicate that extreme body change strategies are predicted by the adoption of more normative body change strategies at an earlier point in time, and that a range of body change strategies among adolescent males are affected by perceived pressures from parents and peers...|$|R

5|$|Drinking {{more than}} one drink a day for women or two drinks for men {{increases}} the risk of heart disease, high blood pressure, atrial fibrillation, and stroke. Risk is greater in younger people due to <b>binge</b> drinking which may result in violence or accidents. About 3.3 million deaths (5.9% of all deaths) are believed to be due to alcohol each year. Alcoholism reduces a person's life expectancy by around ten years and alcohol use is the third leading cause of early death in the United States. No professional medical association recommends that people who are nondrinkers should start drinking wine. Long-term alcohol abuse can cause a number of physical symptoms, including cirrhosis of the liver, pancreatitis, epilepsy, polyneuropathy, alcoholic dementia, heart disease, nutritional deficiencies, peptic ulcers and sexual dysfunction, and can eventually be fatal. Other physical effects include an increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease, malabsorption, alcoholic liver disease, and cancer. Damage to the central nervous system and peripheral nervous system can occur from sustained alcohol consumption. A wide range of immunologic defects can result and there may be a generalized skeletal fragility, in addition to a recognized tendency to accidental injury, resulting a propensity to bone fractures.|$|E
40|$|Animal {{models of}} <b>bingeing</b> have {{typically}} used stress to induce <b>bingeing.</b> A recent model, limited-access to high-fat diet (HFD), {{has shown that}} caloric restriction and stress {{were not required to}} induce <b>bingeing</b> in rats. This study replicated this model in mice, explored the fat content within the model, and investigated locomotor activation associated with binge-eating. Adult mice were maintained on a restricted feeding (RF) schedule of 2 h/d of access to chow or ad lib access to chow, and then provided limited access to 45 % HFD or 84 % HFD for 30 min 3 d/ week for 6 total snack sessions. Circadian activity was monitored for RF animals offered 84 % HFD, and after 6 snack sessions were complete, allowed continuous access to the 45 % HFD or the 84 % HFD for two weeks to explore rebound feeding. <b>Bingeing,</b> defined by increasing intakes across days, was reported for mice offered 45 % HFD regardless of deprivation state (RF or ad lib), while mice offered 84 % HFD only exhibited <b>bingeing</b> when they were restricted. Comparison of male and female mice maintained RF, offered 45 % HFD snack, showed that females had higher intake (kcals/g-bw) while ad lib fed mice exhibited no sex differences. Circadian recordings for female RF mice offered 84 % HFD showed shifts in activity from the first hour of dark cycle to the hour preceding the snack and supported that offering the HFD produced alterations in food-associated arousal. During rebound, female RF mice given 84 % HFD showed the highest intakes in week 1, and then exhibited a marked decline in week 2. The week 1 intake for RF animals were to regain lost body weight and that homeostatic-like intake in week 2 allowed normal body weight maintenance. Results of this investigation support human data that females are more susceptible to binge-type eating disorder, shows that limited access to palatable foods for females under caloric restriction induces changes in circadian activity, and reveals that using mice in this model requires more investigation to optimize binge-behavior. Diet comparisons also suggest that homeostatic and reward mechanisms may have an additive effect on <b>bingeing...</b>|$|R

40|$|Traditional {{cognitive}} {{models of}} binge-eating behaviour in bulimia nervosa (BN) have long emphasised {{the importance of}} weight/shape concern and calorific restriction. However, the traditional cognitive framework continues to neglect the role of negative emotions, despite {{a growing body of}} alternative contemporary research suggesting binge-eating behaviour may develop as a mechanism for dealing with stress and negative emotionality. The current study investigated the unique contributions of emotional experience and emotion dysregulation to binge-eating behaviour in females with varying self-reported eating disorder (ED) characteristics. 79 females completed questionnaires measuring ED characteristics (EDE-Q), emotional experience (AIM and TAS- 20), and emotion regulation difficulties (DERS and ERQ). 36 participants (11 meeting clinical criteria for BN and 5 for BED) had <b>binged</b> at least once in the past 28 days and 43 (none of whom met clinical ED criteria) had not <b>binged.</b> Results showed that those who <b>binged</b> at least once in the past 28 days (regardless of BN) had more difficulties identifying and describing their feelings, experienced emotions with higher intensity and had more difficulties regulating their emotions than females who had not <b>binged.</b> Deficits in emotional introspection, description and regulation predicted binge-eating behaviour. Overall, whilst a traditional framework (weight/shape concern and calorific restriction) did explain some of the variance in binge-eating behaviour in the current sample, the model significantly improved once emotional regulation was added. These results suggest emotionality should not be neglected as a predictor of binge-eating, with important implications for treatment in disorders like BN...|$|R
