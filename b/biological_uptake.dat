The nitrogen content in collected sediment samples varied from 4. 17 % to 6. 78 % (dry weight) and calculated nitrogen sedimentation rates ranged from 273 to 2868 g N/ha d. High ammonium removals were observed together with high concentrations of chlorophyll-a in the pond effluent. Moreover, chlorophyll-a {{had a very good}} correlation with the corresponding increment of VSS (algal biomass) and suspended organic nitrogen (<b>biological</b> nitrogen <b>uptake)</b> in the maturation pond effluents. Therefore, when ammonium removal reached its maximum, total nitrogen removal was very poor as most of the ammonia taken up by algae was washed out in the pond effluent in the form of suspended solids.

40|$|Marine {{productivity}} is often higher downstream than upstream of islands. This so-called island mass effect was tested and quantified {{with respect to}} <b>biological</b> carbon <b>uptake</b> and air–sea exchange of carbon dioxide (CO 2) at the Crozet Plateau between November 2004 and January 2005 during two CROZEX cruises. The remote plateau is situated at 45. 5 – 47. 0 °S 49. 0 – 53. 0 °E, south of the Subantarctic Front (SAF) in the Polar Frontal Zone (PFZ). Surface waters upstream (south) of the plateau had high nutrient and low chlorophyll (HNLC) concentrations. The fugacity of carbon dioxide (fCO 2) in surface water was just below the atmospheric value and oceanic CO 2 uptake was small (0. 2 ± 0. 1 mol m− 2) throughout CROZEX. The mixed-layer concentration of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) decreased by 15 μmol kg− 1 from November to January in these HNLC waters, indicating significant <b>biological</b> carbon <b>uptake.</b> Extensive phytoplankton blooms occurred downstream (north) of the plateau in austral spring. These reduced surface water fCO 2 by 30 – 70 μatm and DIC by 30 – 60 μmol kg− 1 and created an important oceanic sink for atmospheric CO 2 of 0. 6 – 0. 8 ± 0. 4 mol m− 2, corresponding to a total uptake of 1. 3 ± 0. 8 Tg C (1 Tg= 1012 g). The reduction of DIC in the upper 100 m was much larger downstream (2 – 3 mol m− 2) than upstream (1 mol m− 2) of the plateau in January, further confirming {{the existence of the}} island mass effect for the Crozet Archipelago. An additional finding is the sizeable DIC deficit in the HNLC waters upstream (south) of the plateau, suggesting that some HNLC waters of the PFZ are more productive than commonly thought.

The precipitation of carbonate minerals such as ikaite (CaCO 3 · 6 H 2 O) in sea ice brine has the net effect of decreasing DIC and TA and increasing the fCO 2 in the brine.

40|$|A {{sequencing}} {{batch reactor}} (SBR) {{was used for}} the treatment of abattoir wastewater to produce effluent with desirable nitrogen and phosphorus levels for irrigation. The SBR cycle consisted of an anaerobic phase with wastewater feeding, a relatively short aerobic period (allowing full ammonium oxidation), a second anoxic period with feeding, followed by settling and decanting. This design of operation allowed biological nitrification and denitrification via nitrite, and therefore with reduced demand for aeration and COD for nitrogen removal. The design also allowed ammonium, rather than oxidized nitrogen, being the primary nitrogen species in the effluent. Biological phosphorus removal was also achieved, with an effluent level desirable for irrigation. A high-level of nitrite accumulation (40 mg N/L) in the reactor caused inhibition to the <b>biological</b> P <b>uptake.</b> This problem was solved through process optimization.

However, it is still debated which routes CPPs employ to gain access to intracellular compartments.

To elucidate uptake mechanisms of CPPs, here we have used a bioluminescence based assay to measure cytosolic delivery kinetics of luciferin-CPP conjugates in the presence of endocytosis inhibitors. The results suggest that these conjugates are delivered into cytosol mainly via macropinocytosis; clathrin-mediated endocytosis and caveolae/lipid raft dependent endocytosis are involved in a smaller extent. Furthermore, we demonstrate how the involved endocytic routes and internalization kinetic profiles can depend on conjugate concentration in case of certain peptides, but not in case of others.

Deep water comes to the surface south of the Polar Front, before downwelling further north as Antarctic Intermediate Water (AAIW) and Subantarctic Mode Water (SAMW) and close to Antarctica as Antarctic Bottom Water. Sabine etal. (2004) have estimated that AAIW and SAMW had stored 20 Pg C of anthropogenic carbon by 1994 or 5 % of the carbon emitted by human activities.

Key processes affecting the Southern Ocean CO 2 (carbon dioxide) sink are discussed below, notably iron limitation of phytoplankton growth and the role of sea ice. Low iron concentrations limit phytoplankton growth in large parts of the Southern Ocean. Downstream of islands and steep topography iron supply from sediments fuels strong seasonal phytoplankton blooms, thus creating important CO 2 sinks. Wintertime upwelling and entrainment of Circumpolar Deep Water promote high CO 2 levels below Weddell Gyre sea ice, with the ice cover preventing outgassing. Strong <b>biological</b> carbon <b>uptake</b> and possibly calcium carbonate dissolution rapidly reduce surface water CO 2 levels during and upon ice melt, thus creating a sizeable summertime CO 2 sink.

40|$|Although {{relationships}} among soybean (Glycine max [L. ] Merr) seed yield, nitrogen (N) <b>uptake,</b> <b>biological</b> N 2 fixation (BNF), {{and response to}} N fertilization have received considerable coverage in the scientific literature, a comprehensive summary and interpretation of these interactions with specific emphasis on high yield environments is lacking. Six hundred and thirty-seven data sets (site–year–treatment combinations) were analyzed from field studies that had examined these variables and had been published in refereed journals from 1966 to 2006. A mean linear increase of 0. 013 Mg soybean seed yield per kg increase in N accumulation in above-ground biomass was evident in these data. The lower (maximum N accumulation) and upper (maximum N dilution) boundaries for this relationship had slopes of 0. 0064 and 0. 0188 Mg grain kg− 1 N, respectively. On an average, 50 – 60...|$|R
