5|$|Mercedes {{is shocked}} {{when the driver}} of the car gets out and is {{revealed}} as Doctor Browning, who has escaped from prison. He holds Mercedes hostage and forces her into the car, driving off and leaving Clare's corpse in the road. He takes her to the empty McQueen house and attempts to kill her, but Cindy and Lindsey arrive in time and knock him unconscious. Doctor Browning awakens and attempts to attack the women so Mercedes strikes Doctor Browning over the head with a shovel, killing him. The three women panic and put Doctor Browning's corpse into bin liners, stashing it in the attic of the McQueen home. When they discover that the attic is going to have new insulation a few weeks later, the three women scramble to dispose of the corpse and enlist the help of Freddie Roscoe (Charlie Clapham) to hide the body. Mercedes, Cindy and Lindsey place Doctor Browning's body in his car and push it off a cliff, making it appear that Doctor Browning had committed suicide after escaping prison. Cindy panics and alerts the police to the car crash scene. Police officer Sam Lomax (Lizzie Roper) discovers that Mercedes, Cindy and Lindsey were involved in Doctor Browning's murder and brings them in for questioning. When they all confess, she releases them, explaining that she has had to make some decisions to get rid of <b>bad</b> <b>people,</b> and the three women are set free, and Sam disposes of the evidence.|$|E
25|$|Scrooge has a nasty {{temper and}} rarely hesitates to use cartoon {{violence}} {{against those who}} provoke his ire (often his nephew Donald, but also bill and tax collectors as well as door-to-door salesmen); however, {{he seems to be}} against the use of lethal force. On occasion, he has even saved the lives of enemies who had threatened his own life but were in danger of losing their own. According to Scrooge's own explanation, this is to save himself from feelings of guilt over their deaths; he generally awaits no gratitude from them. Scrooge has also opined that only in fairy tales do <b>bad</b> <b>people</b> turn good, and that he is old enough to not believe in fairy tales. Scrooge believes in keeping his word—never breaking a promise once given. In Italian-produced stories of the 1950s to 1970s, however, particularly those written by Guido Martina, Scrooge often acts differently from in American or Danish comics productions.|$|E

25|$|Every year humans add 25 {{billion tons}} of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, and over half of it comes from their {{domestic}} activity. Attenborough introduces the Carbons, a fictional family occupying an average Western suburban house near a city. Their electrical requirements are supplied via fossil fuels. As Attenborough points out, the Carbons are not <b>bad</b> <b>people,</b> but as Westerners, they {{have one of the}} most energy-hungry lifestyles on the planet. They are a two-car household, and each vehicle emits 10 tons of CO2 {{over the course of a}} year. The power used to run the Carbons' home and all its comforts translates into a similar amount. Much of the family's plentiful food supply will have crossed continents by the time it reaches their kitchen, and will have added a tenth to their annual emissions. Yet more are produced by their refuse: buried in a landfill, it heats up as it decomposes and releases greenhouse gases. Mr Carbon's business trips by air contribute to the fastest growing source of CO2. The combined total of the Carbons' yearly air pollution is 45 tons.|$|E

To executive producers Mark Verheiden and Greg Beeman, making Ethan the villain in [...] "Suspect" [...] was the ultimate [...] "red herring" [...] for audiences. Sheriff Ethan was originally going to take a nurse hostage, but the ending was rewritten to leave Ethan as more of a sympathetic character.

500|$|The {{disabling}} of the LinkNYC tablets' browsers had stoked {{fears about}} further {{restrictions on the}} Links. The Independent, a British newspaper, surveyed some homeless New Yorkers and found that while most of these homeless citizens used the kiosks for legitimate reasons (usually not to browse NSFW content), many of the interviewees were scared that LinkNYC may eventually charge money {{to use the internet}} via the Links, or that the kiosks may be demolished altogether. The Guardian, another British newspaper, came to a similar conclusion; one of the LinkNYC users they interviewed said that the Links are [...] "very helpful, but of course <b>bad</b> <b>people</b> messed it up for everyone.” In a press release, LinkNYC refuted fears that service would be paywalled or eliminated, though it did state that several improvements, including dimming the kiosks and lowering maximum volumes, were being implemented to reduce the kiosks' effect on the surrounding communities.|$|E
500|$|Conference {{notes and}} draft {{decisions}} illustrate {{the division of}} opinions before the decision was issued. Justices Douglas, Black, Burton, and Minton were predisposed to overturn Plessy. Fred M. Vinson noted that Congress had not issued desegregation legislation; Stanley F. Reed discussed incomplete cultural assimilation and states' rights and was inclined {{to the view that}} segregation worked to the benefit of the African-American community; Tom C. Clark wrote that [...] "we had led the states on to think segregation is OK and we should let them work it out." [...] Felix Frankfurter and Robert H. Jackson disapproved of segregation, but were also opposed to judicial activism and expressed concerns about the proposed decision's enforceability. Chief Justice Vinson had been a key stumbling block. After Vinson died in September 1953, President Dwight D. Eisenhower appointed Earl Warren as Chief Justice. Warren had supported the integration of Mexican-American students in California school systems following Mendez v. Westminster. However, Eisenhower invited Earl Warren to a White House dinner, where the president told him: [...] "These [...] are not <b>bad</b> <b>people.</b> All they are concerned about is to see that their sweet little girls are not required to sit in school alongside some big overgrown Negroes." [...] Nevertheless, the Justice Department sided with the African American plaintiffs.|$|E
500|$|Itoi {{wrote the}} game's ending while {{overseas}} in Saipan before Mother 3 was cancelled.

Itoi attributed the change in tone to his own growth and the character composition of the new development team. He {{said that he had}} not been changed by fans. Itoi always planned for the two brothers to fight each other, though he did not write the ending until after production had already begun, a process he compared with Hayao Miyazaki's. Itoi processed each line individually as he wrote the final scene, and later reflected on its moral content that <b>bad</b> <b>people</b> sometimes need even more help than the good people. He said that the one line that makes him most emotional is, [...] "You must be tired." [...] Itoi felt that the ending's renewal theme reflected his worldview of appreciating our time on Earth in light of the planet's inevitable end.

500|$|As Hannah Arendt pointed out, however, (following the {{utilitarian}} John Stuart Mill on this point): a bad conscience {{does not}} necessarily signify a bad character; in fact only those who affirm a commitment to applying moral standards will be troubled with remorse, guilt or shame by a bad conscience and their need to regain integrity and wholeness of the self. Representing our soul or true self by analogy as our house, Arendt wrote that [...] "conscience is the anticipation of the fellow who awaits you if and when you come home." [...] Arendt believed {{that people who are}} unfamiliar with the process of silent critical reflection about what they say and do will not mind contradicting themselves by an immoral act or crime, since they can [...] "count on its being forgotten the next moment;" [...] <b>bad</b> <b>people</b> are not full of regrets. Arendt also wrote eloquently on the problem of languages distinguishing the word consciousness from conscience. One reason, she held, was that conscience, as we understand it in moral or legal matters, is supposedly always present within us, just like consciousness: [...] "and this conscience is also supposed to tell us what to do and what to repent; before it became the lumen naturale or Kant's practical reason, it was the voice of God." ...|$|E
500|$|After Pol Pot and his {{supporters}} seized control of KCP in 1973, KCP/VCP relations deteriorated sharply. North Vietnamese formations that were active in Kampuchea {{during the civil war}} were thereafter regularly attacked by their allies. By 1976 while it appeared that Kampuchea/Vietnam relations were normalizing, private suspicions within the respective leaderships grew. Lê Duẩn, Tôn Đức Thắng, Trường Chinh and Phạm Văn Đồng sent messages congratulating the ascension of Pol Pot, Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea as Premier, President of the Presidium and President of the Assembly of the People's Representative, respectively. In turn, KCP sent a congratulatory message to the PRGRSV on its seventh anniversary. On 21 September 1976 a Vietnamese women's delegation visited Kampuchea and the KCP sent public greetings to the 4th National Congress. The Vietnamese leadership hoped that pro-Vietnamese elements would develop within the KCP. When Kampuchean radio announced Pol Pot's resignation, Lê Duẩn and the Vietnamese leadership took it seriously. During a meeting with the Soviet ambassador, Lê Duẩn told him that Pol Pot and Ieng Sary had been removed from the KCP leadership. The change was welcome to Vietnam, since the two were a [...] "pro-Chinese sect conducting a crude and severe policy." [...] Lê Duẩn added that [...] "these were <b>bad</b> <b>people</b> [...] ", but that Nuon Chea was [...] "our man and is my personal friend." [...] However, all-out confrontation was not planned and Lê Duẩn still believed that state-to-state relations could improve. He further noted that Kampuchea would eventually become like Laos, a socialist state and value its relationship with Vietnam and the Soviet Union.|$|E
500|$|... "Breakout" [...] {{was written}} by Ted Bruner, in {{collaboration}} with Trey Vittetoe and Gina Schock of the Go-Go's. It was first recorded by American pop singer Katy Perry, for her second album One of the Boys (2008), though it was never included for the album and was passed on to Cyrus, on whose version Perry sings backing vocals. Like most songs on Breakout, Cyrus wrote [...] "7 Things" [...] while traveling on the Best of Both Worlds Tour, reflecting on her numerous emotions about an ex-boyfriend. She claimed her {{use of the word}} [...] "hate" [...] demonstrated how furious she was, at the time. Originally, [...] "7 Things" [...] was more [...] "soft and nice" [...] but Cyrus says she [...] "went nuts" [...] during the recording process and gave the song a harder sound. She decided to record a cover version of Cyndi Lauper's [...] "Girls Just Want to Have Fun" [...] from the album She's So Unusual (1983), after speaking with Lauper at the 50th Grammy Awards. The two singers were conversing about music, when Lauper stated, [...] "Well, don't be scared of anything. People waste their lives being scared. Lasso the moon. But don't do it because someone tells you it's the right idea." [...] Cyrus believed Lauper's saying encompassed the direction she wanted to take Breakout, ergo she covered [...] "Girls Just Want to Have Fun". However, she desired for the cover to be completely different from other covers of [...] "Girls Just Want to Have Fun" [...] she heard. She described the process as [...] "almost [...] to relearn the song." [...] About the finished product, Cyrus said, [...] "When you listen to the song, it's, like, you're not even sure what it is. It's something completely new." [...] "Full Circle" [...] was co-written by Cyrus, Scott Cutler, and Anne Preven about Cyrus' relationship with Nick Jonas of the Jonas Brothers. [...] "It's about two people. They're always gonna come back together no matter what anyone says, the <b>bad</b> <b>people</b> that try to keep you apart", Cyrus said of the song's concept.|$|E
