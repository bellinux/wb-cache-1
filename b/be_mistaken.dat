5|$|The red wattlebird is hard {{to confuse}} with any other species, though in poor {{visibility}} might <b>be</b> <b>mistaken</b> for the spiny-cheeked honeyeater, or little or western wattlebirds.|$|E
5|$|The related black-headed sugar ant (Camponotus nigriceps) has {{a similar}} {{appearance}} and may <b>be</b> <b>mistaken</b> for a banded sugar ant. Black-headed sugar ants are lighter in colour than banded sugar ants and the orange-brown band is absent from their gaster.|$|E
6000|$|... "Bien!" [...] {{he said at}} last. [...] "It is evident! I had an idea--but clearly I <b>was</b> <b>mistaken.</b> Yes, {{altogether}} I <b>was</b> <b>mistaken.</b> Yet it <b>is</b> strange. But no matter!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is just possible, Mr. Armadale, {{that the}} cabman, {{positive}} as he is, may have <b>been</b> <b>mistaken.</b> I strongly recommend {{you to take}} it for granted that he <b>is</b> <b>mistaken,</b> and to drop it there." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yet I {{may have}} <b>been</b> <b>mistaken.</b> I thought I knew {{the agents of}} yours who killed him. Yet you made me swear--as the price of my brothers' lives--that I <b>was</b> <b>mistaken.</b> Perhaps I <b>was</b> more <b>mistaken</b> than we thought. Perhaps my little Demetrius was not slain at all. Perhaps this man's tale is true." ...|$|R
5|$|Children {{may have}} {{behaviors}} that are easily mistaken for epileptic seizures but are not. These include breath-holding spells, bed wetting, night terrors, tics and shudder attacks. Gastroesophageal reflux may cause arching of the back and twisting of the {{head to the side}} in infants, which may <b>be</b> <b>mistaken</b> for tonic-clonic seizures.|$|E
5|$|Guepinia helvelloides has {{a rather}} unusual appearance, {{and is not}} likely to <b>be</b> <b>mistaken</b> for other fungi. However, the red {{chanterelle}} species Cantharellus cinnabarinus is superficially similar; unlike G.helvelloides, however, it does not have a rubbery and gelatinous texture, and its undersurface is wrinkled, not smooth.|$|E
5|$|Mycena nargan {{has a very}} {{distinct}} appearance, and {{is unlikely}} to <b>be</b> <b>mistaken</b> for other Mycenas. However, one noted unintentional misidentification occurred when the M.nargan on the cover photograph of Bruce A. Fuhrer's 2005 book A Field Guide to Australian Fungi was labelled as Mycena nivalis, a species with a white cap.|$|E
60|$|The French <b>were</b> <b>mistaken,</b> because really Spinola was so weak {{that had}} they marched on into Montferrat the Spaniards must have raised the siege; the Duke of Savoy <b>was</b> <b>mistaken,</b> because the plague had so {{weakened}} the French that they durst not have stayed to winter in Piedmont; and Spinola <b>was</b> <b>mistaken,</b> for though he was very slow, if he had stayed before the town one fortnight longer, Thoiras the governor must have surrendered, being brought to the last extremity.|$|R
50|$|After {{the attacks}} of September 11, 2001, Sikhs in the West have <b>been</b> <b>mistaken</b> for Muslims and {{subjected}} to hate crimes. Balbir Singh Sodhi, a Sikh living in Mesa, Arizona, {{was shot to death}} on September 16, 2001 when he <b>was</b> <b>mistaken</b> for a Muslim.|$|R
60|$|I {{must have}} <b>been</b> <b>mistaken.</b> My friend <b>was</b> {{not a man}} of family; {{there was not a}} woman within forty miles of the river camp; he never was so passionately devoted to {{children}} as to import a luxury so expensive. I must have <b>been</b> <b>mistaken.</b>|$|R
5|$|News of Stillman's defeat, the Indian Creek massacre, {{and other}} smaller attacks {{triggered}} panic among the white population. Many settlers fled to Chicago, then a small town, which became overcrowded with hungry refugees. Many Potawatomis also fled towards Chicago, {{not wanting to}} {{get caught in the}} conflict nor <b>be</b> <b>mistaken</b> for hostiles. Throughout the region, settlers hurriedly organized militia units and built small forts.|$|E
5|$|Novices may mistake {{juvenile}} death caps for edible puffballs or mature specimens {{for other}} edible Amanita species, such as A.lanei, so some authorities recommend avoiding the collecting of Amanita species {{for the table}} altogether. The white form of A.phalloides may <b>be</b> <b>mistaken</b> for edible species of Agaricus, especially the young fruitbodies whose unexpanded caps conceal the telltale white gills; all mature species of Agaricus have dark-colored gills.|$|E
5|$|Other {{members of}} the genus Pholiota may <b>be</b> <b>mistaken</b> for Pholiota flammans, {{especially}} Pholiota squarrosa which commonly forms large tufts {{at the base of}} deciduous as well as coniferous trees. P.squarrosa tends to be a less intense yellow color than P.flammans. P.adiposa is also similar, but prefers to grow on dead hardwoods; unlike P.flammans, it has gelatinous scales on the stem as well as the cap.|$|E

50|$|A cowpuncher <b>is</b> <b>mistaken</b> for {{a notorious}} gunman.|$|R
5|$|S.occidentalis {{may also}} <b>be</b> <b>mistaken</b> for Microstoma floccosum, which {{occurs in the}} same habitat. M.floccosum, however, has taller cups and is covered with stiff white hairs. Another cup-fungus, Scutellinia scutellata, is {{disc-shaped}} without a stem, and is fringed with black hairs around its rim.|$|E
5|$|United Nations Security {{officers}} are generally responsible for security within the UN Headquarters. They {{are equipped with}} weapons and handcuffs and may <b>be</b> <b>mistaken</b> for NYPD officers, due to similarity in uniforms. The NYPD's 17th Precinct patrols the area around and near the complex, but does not have jurisdiction inside the UN headquarters themselves since the headquarters are considered international property.|$|E
5|$|A {{particular}} viewpoint {{is called}} a naya or a partial viewpoint. According to Vijay Jain, Nayavada does not deny the attributes, qualities, modes and other aspects; but qualifies them to be from a particular perspective. A naya reveals {{only a part of}} the totality, and should not <b>be</b> <b>mistaken</b> for the whole. A synthesis of different viewpoints is said to be achieved by the doctrine of conditional predications (syādvāda).|$|E
50|$|This list, however, <b>was</b> <b>mistaken</b> {{in several}} respects.|$|R
50|$|During a European train journey, a nobleman's butler Josef (Paul Lukas) <b>is</b> <b>mistaken</b> for his {{employer}} Prince Alfred von Rommer (Nils Asther) by a beautiful woman, Marie (Elissa Landi), {{and he does}} nothing to disillusion her. In due course, the Prince himself arrives and <b>is</b> <b>mistaken</b> for his servant.|$|R
6000|$|... "Buy!" [...] echoed Goree. [...] "From me?" [...] Then {{he laughed}} harshly. [...] "I reckon you <b>are</b> <b>mistaken</b> about that. I reckon you <b>are</b> <b>mistaken</b> about that. I sold out to you, as you {{yourself}} expressed it, 'lock, stock and barrel.' There isn't even a ramrod left to sell." ...|$|R
5|$|California condors {{have the}} largest {{wingspan}} of any North American bird. They are surpassed in both body length and weight only by the trumpeter swan and the introduced mute swan. The American white pelican and whooping crane also have longer bodies than the condor. Condors are so large that they can <b>be</b> <b>mistaken</b> for a small, distant airplane, which possibly occurs more often than they are mistaken for other species of bird.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the end of}} hostilities, Loving {{returned}} to the Philippines and resumed command of the Philippine Constabulary Band for three years before retiring a second time, moving with his wife, Edith, to Oakland, California. In Oakland, Loving found success in real estate speculation. Because attitudes in Oakland at the time made African American ownership of property in some portions of the city problematic, Loving would dress in a chauffeur's uniform and drive Edith, who had a light complexion and could <b>be</b> <b>mistaken</b> for Caucasian, to view property.|$|E
5|$|Immature American {{white and}} scarlet ibises are very {{difficult}} to tell apart, although scarlet ibises tend to have darker legs and bare skin around the face. An immature American white ibis could <b>be</b> <b>mistaken</b> for an immature glossy ibis, but the latter is wholly dark brown and lacks the white belly and rump. The adult is distinguishable from the wood stork, which is much larger and its wings have more black on them.|$|E
50|$|A night {{watchman}} <b>is</b> <b>mistaken</b> for a wealthy financier.|$|R
5000|$|Some episodes rely on Danny being {{mistaken for}} other people, usually by some bizarre coincidence. In [...] "Element of Risk", he <b>is</b> <b>mistaken</b> for a {{criminal}} mastermind named Lomax, played by Shane Rimmer. In [...] "Anyone Can Play", he <b>is</b> <b>mistaken</b> at a Brighton casino for a Russian spy paymaster.|$|R
50|$|Several of his roles have <b>been</b> <b>mistaken</b> for Kirk Thornton.|$|R
5|$|In 1997, the Russian {{government}} announced {{that all of}} its remaining smallpox samples would be moved to the Vector Institute in Koltsovo. With {{the breakup of the}} Soviet Union and unemployment of many of the weapons program's scientists, U.S. government officials have expressed concern that smallpox and the expertise to weaponize it may have become available to other governments or terrorist groups who might wish to use virus as means of biological warfare. Specific allegations made against Iraq in this respect, however, proved to <b>be</b> <b>mistaken.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{political}} {{circles in}} The Netherlands, the announcement caused widespread irritation about his plan. Christian Democrat senator Hans Hillen remarked that Wilders' words could endanger Dutch interests. Former NATO general secretary Jaap de Hoop Scheffer advised Wilders {{not to make}} a speech, arguing that the international public does not know who is in the Dutch cabinet and who is in parliament and thus Wilders' speech could <b>be</b> <b>mistaken</b> as an official statement of the Dutch government. Also Christian Democrat party leader and acting Dutch Minister of Foreign Affairs Maxime Verhagen issued a warning.|$|E
5|$|Morchella populiphila is a {{distinct}} morel because of its cap attachment and its habitat, and {{it is unlikely to}} <b>be</b> <b>mistaken</b> for other species. Verpa bohemica is somewhat similar in appearance, but its cap hangs free from attachment to the stipe. The other North American half-free morel, Morchella punctipes, is very similar in appearance to M.populiphila, and they cannot be reliably distinguished on morphology alone. The distribution of M.punctipes extends from the Great Plains eastward. The widespread European species Morchella semilibera is morphologically indistinguishable from M.populiphila, in both macroscopic and microscopic characteristics.|$|E

40|$|By {{incorporating}} David Lewis’ {{conditional analysis}} (LCA), Vihvelin’s LCA-PROP inherits {{some of its}} problems. I have three issues with LCA that apply equally to LCA-PROP. 1. As far as I can understand what an x-complete cause is, the analysis <b>is</b> <b>mistaken</b> in claiming that a disposition’s stimulus and its causal basis would jointly be an x-complete cause of its manifestation. 2. The analysis <b>is</b> <b>mistaken</b> if it assumes that dispositions necessarily have distinct causal bases. 3. The analysis <b>is</b> <b>mistaken</b> in assuming that the causal basis of a disposition must be an intrinsic property of the disposed object...|$|R
