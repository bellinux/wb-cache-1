2500|$|Erickson was an irrepressible {{practical}} joker, {{and it was}} {{not uncommon}} for him to slip indirect suggestions into all kinds of situations, including in his own books, papers, lectures and seminars. For example, a student arrived at one of the five-day intensive seminars he held in his home office {{near the end of his}} life. When Erickson asked why she had come, she replied frankly: [...] "My teacher told me that I should come to see you before you died." [...] Erickson smiled and said: [...] "You tell him that dying is the last thing I intend to do." [...] The group laughed at the pun. Then Erickson said, with a twinkle in his eye, [...] "Do you want to know how to avoid dying? Always wake up every morning. And do you want to know how to ensure that you will wake up every morning?", he continued, [...] "Drink lots of liquids <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> sleep!" ...|$|E
60|$|Cel. That's much as your pillow is laid, <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> sleep.|$|E
60|$|MENDOZA. Just {{allow me}} to read a few lines <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> sleep. I should really like your opinion of them.|$|E
6000|$|... "Was {{your father}} in your {{thoughts}} <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> sleep?" [...] pursued Mr. Hawbury. [...] "Was there any description of him--any portrait {{of him at}} home--in your mind?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "True," [...] replied Lord Glenvarloch; [...] "but <b>you</b> knew <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> sleep {{how little}} I could assist {{you in your}} difficulties, and you seemed disposed, notwithstanding, to put some {{confidence}} in me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Young lady," [...] he said, [...] "what {{sort of a}} {{life did}} <b>you</b> lead <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> Messrs. Rubicon & Moore's? I always {{understood}} that your people were very poor, and only respectably connected." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Because we can't help it. It's the doctor's orders. He thinks it's {{the best}} thing you can do, just <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> bed." ...|$|E
60|$|SURFACE. Hold[!] see--whether {{it is or}} not <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the Door--I have a {{particular}} Message for you if it should be my Brother.|$|E
6000|$|... "My friend, Augustus Scarborough, is {{particularly}} {{anxious to see}} you <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> his father. The old man is in very failing health, you know." ...|$|E
6000|$|He rose abruptly, {{interrupting}} her. [...] "I'll <b>go</b> <b>to</b> Wilding now," [...] he cried, {{his voice}} resolute. [...] "He shall cancel this bargain {{he had no}} right to make. He shall take up his quarrel with me where it stood <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> him." ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{caught at}} her hands and looked upon her with face grown older and graver as he bitterly wailed: [...] "Why couldn't we have met <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> him? <b>You</b> must not <b>go</b> with him now, for you are mine at heart, you belong to me." ...|$|R
6000|$|At {{this moment}} {{there was a}} tap at the door, and, bidden to enter, Mr. Clifford {{presented}} himself with a sealed paper, for the gentleman in evening dress. [...] "Your secretary, sir, brought this, which he said must be given <b>you</b> <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> the ambassador." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Here's your room," [...] said Rosie, {{setting down}} the candle on the table, [...] "and now I'm {{going to give}} you a good spanking <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> bed." ...|$|E
6000|$|Babbitt was up, hat in hand, growling, [...] "Well, if that's {{what you}} call being at peace, for heaven's sake just warn me <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> war, will you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Get your {{wet clothes}} off {{and take some}} quinine <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> sleep," [...] Grahame advised; and when Walthew left him he watched the men heave the warp tight.|$|E
6000|$|... "We welcome Your Majesty," [...] said one. [...] "We {{have known}} you many years ago, <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> {{live at the}} Emerald City, {{and we have seen}} you fight the terrible Kalidahs and conquer them, so we know you are the King of all Beasts." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Then I {{wonder you}} didn't come <b>to</b> me <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> her. If my {{daughter}} marries to please me, I shall give her money, no doubt. How much is neither here nor there. If she marries to please herself, without considering me, I shan't {{give her a}} farthing.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, {{but your}} very {{presence}} alters everything!" [...] she cried. [...] "It makes everything possible--everything. My brother, too, is mad with excitement. He hoped {{that you might}} have been at the Clarion Hall to-night, <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> Downing Street. <b>You</b> have seen Mr. Foley and talked with him?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Wal, young woman, <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> ridin' off alone {{you want}} to get your eyes {{corrected}} to Western distance. Now, what'd you call them black things off there on the slope?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh yes, generally," [...] said Sir Hugo. [...] "But now I {{mean you}} to go at once to a new tutor, to break the change for you <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> Eton." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh! {{but please}} don't go till you {{have told me}} what it is; I'm so frightened," [...] said Alice; [...] "do stay and {{tell me about it}} <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> papa." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Some {{words you}} spoke {{yesterday}} recalled to me something you said {{nearly four years}} ago. Do you remember when we sat {{next to each other}} in the twilight, the day <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> India? We were talking about superstitions then, and you told me that you had only one, and said what it was--you remember?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes; {{solely because}} you married {{him on the}} day I was free {{to ask you to}} marry me. My wife died four-and-twenty hours <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> church with Downe. The fixing of my journey at that {{particular}} moment was because of her funeral; but once away I knew I should have no inducement to come back, and took my steps accordingly.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, do you {{remember}} coming down in a gig to Dr. Swishtail's <b>to</b> see me, <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> India, and giving me half a guinea and {{a pat on the}} head? I always had an idea that you were at least seven feet high, and was quite astonished at your return from India to find you no taller than myself." ...|$|R
60|$|Mar. I see, my lord, you're come to {{take your}} leave; And were it not to give the court suspicion, I would oblige you, sir, <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>go,</b> <b>To</b> lead me to the king.|$|E
6000|$|... "Who {{said there}} WAS? What {{do you talk}} to me like that for, Huck Finn? You wait till I say a thing's got sense in it <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> accusing me of saying it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, {{but not on}} the cock. Cock them <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> bed. It {{is paying}} you a great compliment, captain, to lend you these. Were you one of the awkward squad you should not have them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Shucks, Johnny Chuck! You are slow! Why, it was {{all over}} Green Meadows last night how Reddy Fox had been shot by Farmer Brown's boy!" [...] jeered Peter Rabbit. [...] "That's no news. And here you've waked me up to tell me {{something}} I knew <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> bed last night! Serves Reddy Fox right. Hope he'll be lame for a week," [...] added Peter Rabbit.|$|R
6000|$|Miss Baker {{opened the}} battle. [...] "George," [...] said she, [...] "Caroline {{has made me}} promise to speak <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> up <b>to</b> town. Won't you sit down?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What do you here, Lord of Memphis? Why {{are you not}} in {{the cell}} where Pharaoh bound you? Oh! I remember--the footstool-bearer, Merytra, your paid spy, let you out, did she not? Why is she not here with Kaku the Sorcerer, who {{fashioned}} the enchanted image that did Pharaoh to death? Is it because she stays to doctor those false lips of hers that were cut last night <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> ask yonder Kaku to interpret a certain dream which came to you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, dear Maggie, {{at least}} you {{will go to the}} dance at Park House to-morrow, and have some music and brightness, <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> pay these dull dutiful visits. Ah! here come aunty and the tea." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ha!" [...] cried I, [...] "if it is {{anything}} {{in the nature of}} a problem which you desire to see solved, I should strongly recommend you to come to my friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the official police." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Because your lordship {{smells of}} it after supper, when I embrace you <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> bed," [...] said the young lady, who, indeed, was as pert {{as her father}} said, and looked as {{beautiful}} a little gipsy as eyes ever gazed on.|$|E
6000|$|... "You'll stay a {{long time}} with me <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> away <b>to</b> sea again, won't you, dear papa?" [...] asked the child earnestly, after she had given up the futile effort to {{strangle}} him.|$|R
6000|$|... "While I {{think of}} it, Sir Everard," [...] the latter said, as they drew near their destination. [...] "I should be glad {{of a short}} {{conversation}} with <b>you</b> <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> down <b>to</b> Dominey." ...|$|R
60|$|Surely {{you don't}} think the large head of Robert bad. Why, it is exquisite.... I can't read over, and send this scratch {{that you may}} pardon me <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> (not <b>to</b> lose the post).|$|R
