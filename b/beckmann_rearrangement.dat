40|$|Benzylideneacetone {{has been}} {{subjected}} to the Schmidt reaction in sulphuric acid under various conditions, and the only amide isolated was N-methylcinnamamide. Benzylideneacetons p-methoxy-, p-nitro- and m-nitro-benzylideneacetones were subjected to the Schmidt reaction in hydrochloric acid and in polyphosphoric acid. In hydrochloric acid each ketone gave a good yield of the N-methylcinnamamide. In polyphosphoric acid the nitrobenzylideneacetones gave a mixture of the N-styrylacetamide and the N-methylcinnamamide, benzylideneacetone gave mainly N-methylcinnamamide, only a trace of N-styrylacetamide being isolated in some runs of shortened duration, and the N-methylcinnamamide was the only amide isolated from p-methoxybenzyl-ideneacetone. The formation of aniline and p-anisidine during the reactions of benzylideneacetone and p-methoxybenzylidene-acetone in polyphosphoric acid has been explained. A mechanism has been proposed to explain the exclusive production of the N-methylcinnamamides in hydrochloric acid, and the novel variation of the amide ratio with solvent observed in the reactions with the nitrobenzylideneacetones. The <b>Beckmann</b> <b>rearrangements</b> of the alpha-oximes of benzylideneacetone, p-nitro- and m-nitro-benzylideneacetones have been re-examined. Methyl vinyl ketone, methyl isopropenyl ketone and mesityl oxide were subjected to Schmidt reaction conditions in hydrochloric acid. Ammonia was isolated from each reaction and, in addition methyl vinyl ketone gave diacetyl, methyl isopropenyl ketone gave methyl ethyl ketone, and mesityl oxide gave methylamine and acetone. Addition of hydrazoic acid to the olefinic bond of the ketones yielded azidoketones, decomposition of which in acids gave ammonia in each case, diacetyl and ethylenediamine from the azide of methyl vinyl ketone, shown to be 1 -azidobutan- 3 -one, and methylamine from the azide of mesityl oxide. A mechanism for the decomposition of 1 -azidobutan- 3 -one has been proposed...|$|R

2500|$|The alcohol (3a) and the ketone (3b) can be {{purified}} {{from the}} alcohol/ketone mixture under different reaction conditions. [...] Pure cyclododecanol (3a) {{can be produced}} from the hydrogenation of the mixture {{in the presence of}} a copper-chromium catalyst at 30 MPa and 160 ˚C. Pure cyclododecanone (3b) can be produced through the dehydrogenation of the mixture over copper or copper-chromium catalysts on an active support at a temperature range of 230–245 ˚C and atmospheric pressure. Pure cyclododecanone can then be converted into cyclododecanone oxime, which yields laurolactam after <b>Beckmann</b> <b>rearrangement.</b> Laurolactam is the precursor to several plastics, such as polyamide 12, which is also known as nylon 12.|$|E
40|$|Huperzine A is {{a natural}} product, {{originally}} isolated from the Chinese club moss Huperzia serrata, which is currently undergoing clinical trials in the U. S. and has already been approved in China {{for the treatment of}} Alzheimer's disease (AD). This sesquiterpene alkaloid of the Lycopodium family is an eXGellent selective and reversible inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), which is an established target in the palliative treatment of AD. Huperzine A has been the target of several syntheses and a number of analogues have also been prepared. However, all of the synthetic approaches to date have been essentially linear and thus not ideal for analogue preparation. This thesis describes the completed development of the first formal convergent synthesis of (Ã‚Â±) -huperzine A, starting from commercially available cyclohex- 2 -enone and aminopicoline. A key step in the synthesis is an intramolecular Heck cyclisation, which gives the core tricycle of the natural product Optimisation of the intramolecular Heck reaction allowed for it to be carried out on a multi-gram scale and in 72 % yield. Once completed, th~ converg~nt synthesis could now be used in the preparation ofnovel huperzine A analogues, which would be tested for AChE inhibitory activity and also for broad range CNS activity. Initial analogue work described in this thesis has proved promising, with a nitrogen atom having been successfully incorporated into the tricyclic core at two different positions via <b>Beckmann</b> <b>rearrangements.</b> This thesis also describes the resolution of a key intermedi~te in the newly-developed racemic synthesis, thus allowing for the synthesis of enantiomerically-pure huperzine A or related analogues.

D. theses „Rearrangement {{reactions}} in ionic liquid media” {{are devoted to}} the subject that has gained great actuality and large popularity today - ionic liquids. The research about three different by reaction mechanisms organic transformations – Fries, <b>Beckmann</b> and Claisen <b>rearrangement</b> {{reactions in}} ionic liquid media is discussed in the thesis. The novelty of the research is connected with the replacement of organic solvents with environmentally friendly materials – ionic liquids in the mentioned rearrangement reactions. As ionic liquids are considered a “designer made solvents“, {{it is possible to}} select the most appropriate ionic liquids for the corresponding reactions. The impact {{of the structure of the}} cation and the anion in ionic liquids, as well as the type of Lewis acid on the selected rearrangement reaction rates and the distributions of products are analyzed in the Ph. D. theses. The impact of the polarity, as well as the type of cation, hydrophobicity, the hydrogen bonding formation ability, the type of anion and the catalyst are evaluated on the three rearrangement reactions...|$|R
2500|$|The second {{protective}} {{group in}} 26 (acetal, acid hydrolysis) was reconverted to the ketone in 27. The monooxime 28 (at the more hindered ketone group) was synthesised from the dioxime by selective hydrolysis (nitrous acid / acetic acid [...] ). The new nitrogen atom {{is also the}} second nitrogen atom required for the AD building block. Both the cyclopentene ring and the cyclohexenone ring were oxidized next in an ozonolysis (ozone) forming triketone 29, an aldol condensation of the 1,5-dicarbonyl unit (pyrrolidine acetate) formed cyclohexene 30 with tosylation of the oxime group, a second oxidation with periodic acid cleaves the cyclohexene ring and diazomethane esterifies the resulting carboxylic acid group in 31. A <b>Beckmann</b> <b>rearrangement</b> (methanol, sodium polystyrene sulfonate 2 hrs, 170°C) took place next to lactam 32 (not isolated) which reacted further to the tetracycle 33 called alpha-corrnorsterone in an amine-carbonyl condensation - aldol condensation cascade. This compound resisted [...] ring-opening of the lactam group due to incorrect stereochemistry of the propionic ester side-chain. The alpha compound was therefore converted its epimer 34 by first equilibrating in excess base followed by reacidifiying and diazomethane treatment. This epimer was then converted to the 35 by the simultaneous action of methanol and thiophenol. This ensured the differentiation of what will become the imidazole tail. [...] The [...] Ozonolysis gave aldehyde 36 with ammonia converting the thioester into an amide group and aldehyde reduction (sodium borohydride) followed by mesylation and bromination (lithium bromide) gave the bromide 37 with conversion of the amide group into a nitrile group as the completed AD section.|$|E

50|$|After a short {{synthesis}} {{to obtain}} the desired spiro-5.4 system, Nobel Laureaute E.J.

50|$|The {{hydrolysis}} of oximes proceeds easily by heating in {{the presence}} of various inorganic acids, and the oximes decompose into the corresponding ketones or aldehydes, and hydroxylamines. The reduction of oximes by sodium metal, sodium amalgam, hydrogenation, or reaction with hydride reagents produces amines. Typically the reduction of aldoximes gives both primary amines and secondary amines; however, reaction conditions can be altered (such as the addition of potassium hydroxide in a 1/30 molar ratio) to yield solely primary amines. In general, oximes can be changed to the corresponding amide derivatives by treatment with various acids. This reaction is called <b>Beckmann</b> <b>rearrangement.</b> In this reaction, a hydroxyl group is exchanged with the group that is in the anti position of the hydroxyl group. The amide derivatives that are obtained by <b>Beckmann</b> <b>rearrangement</b> can be transformed into a carboxylic acid by means of hydrolysis (base or acid catalyzed). And an amine by hoffman degradation of the amide {{in the presence}} of alkali hypoclorites at 80 degrees Celsius, the degradation is itself prone to side reactions, namely the formation of biurets or cyanate polymers., To avoid this side-reaction, strict temperature control is necessary; the reaction must be conducted at sufficient temperature to isomerise the cyanate to the isocyante.Also, good solvation is also crucial to be successful. <b>Beckmann</b> <b>rearrangement</b> is used for the industrial synthesis of caprolactam (see applications below).|$|E
