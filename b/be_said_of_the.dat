5|$|Little can <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{evolutionary}} {{history of the}} genus, mainly because remains of other Neogene New World vultures are usually younger or even more fragmentary. The teratorns held sway over the ecological niche of the extant group especially in North America. The Kern vulture seems to slightly precede the main bout of the Great American Interchange, and it is notable that the living diversity of New World vultures seems to have originated in Central America. The Kern vulture would therefore represent a northwards divergence possibly sister to the S. fisheri – S. papa lineage. The fossil record, though scant, supports {{the theory that the}} ancestral king vultures and South American condors separated at least some 5 mya.|$|E

25|$|Although Sweden {{kept the}} Poles and the Danes at a distance, {{this could not}} <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Russians. In the Great Northern War (1700–1721), Czar Peter the Great utterly {{destroyed}} Sweden's pretensions to being a regional superpower. In the 1721 Treaty of Nystad, Estonia and Livonia, which had again been completely devastated after {{more than twenty years}} of war, were claimed by Russia. Curonia continued to be ruled by its dukes for another three-quarters of a century, but in 1795, that region also became a Russian possession as part of the Third Partition of Poland.|$|E
25|$|Aside {{from the}} civil rights infringement, the Charter has faced legal {{challenges}} because the restricted education opportunities have hindered not only unilingual but bilingual anglophones' employment. Although the Charter made French the official language of government and civil administration, the same cannot <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> private sector. Despite nearly 30 years of the Charter, {{it has never been}} applied as rigorously as intended because to do so would violate civil liberties. English is still often made a requirement by employers in Montreal, including many French-Canadian owned ones, and, to a lesser extent, in Gatineau and Quebec City, with the workforce in Montreal remaining largely bilingual despite the Charter.|$|E
25|$|At {{first the}} Sa'dis {{appeared}} to be fanatical religious zealots who were intolerant of non-Muslims. They imposed heavy taxes on the local Jewish community. As they consolidated their authority in the country, however, they gradually evinced greater toleration toward the Jewish minority. Like their Wattasid predecessors, the Sa'di sultans now employed Jews as physicians, diplomatic emissaries, and interpreters. Beginning in 1603, Abraham bin Wach and later Judah Levi served as ministers of the treasury. Members of the Jewish aristocratic Cabessa and Palache families were recruited by the sultan's court as agents and negotiators with European merchants who entered the country. Whereas the authorities increasingly proved to be friendly toward the Jews, the same could hardly <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Muslim masses {{as well as local}} urban and rural chieftains and governors.|$|E

500|$|From a {{technical}} and tactical point of view, the D-1 project provided the Red Army (RKKA) corps artillery with a modern 152mm howitzer, which combined both good mobility and firepower. When {{compared with a}} typical contemporary howitzer of similar caliber, the D-1 had shorter range, but was much lighter. For example, the German 15 cm sFH 18 had a range of 13,325 meters - about one kilometer longer {{than that of the}} D-1 - but also weighed almost two tons more (5,510 kilograms in traveling position). The same can <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> US 155-mm howitzer M1 (14,600 meters, 5,800 kilograms) or the 149mm howitzer manufactured by the Italian Ansaldo (14,250 meters, 5,500 kilograms). A German howitzer with characteristics {{similar to those of the}} D-1 [...] the 15 cm sFH 36 [...] did not reach mass production. Compared with older pieces such as the French Schneider model 1917 (11,200 meters, 4,300kg), the D-1 had the advantage in both weight and range.|$|E
500|$|An {{anonymous}} {{review in}} the Imperial Review in November 1805 stated, [...] "something should <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> language. This undoubtedly is not its chief excellence. The style, in many places, is trailing, flat, and uninteresting,—deficient both in strength and animation. The author seldoms avails himself of any artificial ornaments [...] Though we feel ourselves compelled to make these observations, it is hardly necessary to add, that upon the whole we think very highly of this performance." [...] The review continues by comparing Madoc to Paradise Lost: [...] "were the style adorned by a little artificial colouring, and enriched with all the allowable decorations of poetry, Madoc would hardly yield to Paradise Lost. As it stands, it is certainly the second heroic production in the English language. Its leading characteristics are not fire and sublimity, but tenderness and humanity. Milton astonishes the head—Southey touches the heart. The first we may admire—the last we can love." ...|$|E

500|$|The band {{traveled}} to 47 {{of the lower}} 48 states in a unique 1955 Greyhound Scenicruiser, identified as #472. [...] Each member had his own private space on the bus, a factor they credited {{to the success of}} their intense touring period. Band legend is that they would have {{traveled to}} all of the lower 48 {{had it not been for}} a cancelled concert in Maine that was never rebooked. Quist has stated that they put about two million miles on the vehicle. [...] The bus was sold in an estate sale following the Montana Band plane crash, and later obtained by a collector in Great Falls, Montana who refurbished it and states that, , it still ran. [...] The same could not <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bus during the band's touring years, when breakdowns and maintenance issues were frequent, possibly because of the Montana altitude, irregular driving habits of band personnel, or simply the mileage the bus accumulated.|$|E
500|$|The {{anonymous}} {{narrator is}} at first sceptical, then believing, finally flirtatious with the reader: {{he concludes that}} [...] "there is really {{a great deal to}} <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Willie Hughes theory of Shakespeare's sonnets." [...] By the end fact and fiction have melded together. Arthur Ransome wrote that Wilde [...] "read something of himself into Shakespeare's sonnets" [...] and became fascinated with the [...] "Willie Hughes theory" [...] despite the lack of biographical evidence for the historical William Hughes' existence. Instead of writing a short but serious essay on the question, Wilde tossed the theory amongst the three characters of the story, allowing it to unfold as background to the plot. The story thus is an early masterpiece of Wilde's combing many elements that interested him, conversation, literature and the idea that to shed oneself of an idea one must first convince another of its truth. Ransome concludes that Wilde succeeds precisely because the literary criticism is unveiled with such a deft touch.|$|E
500|$|In 1921 Wilkinson {{attended}} the Red International of Labour Unions Congress and the Second Congress of Communist Women in Moscow, {{where she met}} several Russian communist leaders, including the Defence Minister Leon Trotsky, and Nadezhda Krupskaya, the educationist who was Lenin's wife; Wilkinson considered Krupskaya's speech the best at the Congress. The main outcome of the gathering was {{the foundation of the}} Red International of Labour Unions, often known as the [...] "Profintern". The aim of this organisation was to seek revolutionary change through industrial action, leading to the overthrow of world capitalism. At home, although she failed to persuade her union, NUDAW, to affiliate to the Profintern, Wilkinson continued to promote Russian achievements, especially its emancipation of women workers. In November 1922, at a meeting celebrating the fifth anniversary of the Russian Revolution, Wilkinson said that the Russian people could look forward with hope, and asked whether the same could <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> people condemned to live their lives in the slums of Manchester. However, Wilkinson found herself increasingly at odds with communists in Manchester, over the party's industrial and wider international strategies.|$|E

500|$|A {{pneumatic}} value {{failure in}} the preceding race, the United States Grand Prix, had forced Häkkinen to retire from the Grand Prix. With two races of the season remaining and an eight-point deficit after losing {{the lead in the}} Drivers' Championship, Häkkinen remained confident about his title chances: [...] "I know that what happened to me in the last Grand Prix, when I had to retire, can happen to anyone, It could happen to Michael. So I am very optimistic. I have come here prepared and thinking about these two races together. Not one, two." [...] Michael Schumacher emphasised the pressure of leading the championship going into Japan: [...] "It hasn't been a relaxing time at all and I still haven't completely got over the jetlag from the States. But I'm prepared to sacrifice this and a lot more to bring the title back to Maranello. And the same can <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> entire team."

Perhaps no more can <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> influence of Baconthorpe than that, given that he was a [...] "subtle and eclectic scholar who did not hesitate to disagree with Aquinas on many important issues", it might be [...] "that acquaintance with his works may have helped John to avoid any slavish adherence to Thomistic doctrines".|$|E
