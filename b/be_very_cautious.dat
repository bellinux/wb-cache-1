25|$|Outliers {{can occur}} by chance in any distribution, {{but they often}} {{indicate}} either measurement error or that the population has a heavy-tailed distribution. In the former case one wishes to discard them or use statistics that are robust to outliers, while {{in the latter case}} they indicate that the distribution has high skewness and that one should <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>cautious</b> in using tools or intuitions that assume a normal distribution. A frequent cause of outliers is a mixture of two distributions, which may be two distinct sub-populations, or may indicate 'correct trial' versus 'measurement error'; this is modeled by a mixture model.|$|E

2500|$|To {{judge the}} success of the Libby Prison escape solely by the number of men who crossed Federal lines would be a mistake. [...] Richmond was deeply {{affected}} by the break, and Libby Prison itself was thrown into chaos, much to the satisfaction and raised morale of the remaining prisoners. [...] Lieutenant Colonel Cavada recorded some of the more humorous effects of the escape inside the prison. [...] On one occasion, the entire camp was roused {{in the middle of the}} night for a roll call because a sentry thought he saw something down in a sewer. [...] It turned out to be his own shadow. [...] Even the Confederate warden, Major Thomas P. Turner, was visibly shaken.

2500|$|An {{economist}} at Simon Fraser University in Vancouver, British Columbia who makes ties between same-sex parenting and childhood instability {{by looking at}} couples from unstable homes and comparing them {{to those who have}} been raised consistently by two heterosexual parents. Allen takes a 2010 study by Michael Rosenfeld - who testified for the plaintiffs, and re-examines it by adding in the outliers. [...] "We re-examine Rosenfeld's (2010) study on the association between child outcomes and same-sex family structure. Using the same data set, we replicate and generalize Rosenfeld's findings and show that the implications of his study are different when using either alternative comparison groups or alternative sample restrictions. Compared with traditional married households, we find that children being raised by same-sex couples are 35 percent less likely to make normal progress through school; this difference is statistically significant at the one percent level," [...] states the brief for Allen's report. Signed onto an amicus brief with both Price and Regnerus urging the Supreme Court to uphold California’s Proposition 8. Allen was the defense's final witness and testified on March 6, 2014 that the state [...] "should <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>cautious</b> in making such a fundamental change to such a fundamental institution when there really isn’t any evidence on the child outcomes." [...] Allen argued that although U.S. psychology and sociology organizations have expressed consensus opinions that children of same-sex couples suffer no measurable disadvantages, conflicting results and limited data show that there's no such certainty on the matter. While maintaining he has no bias, he admitted that his religious views lead him to believe that homosexual acts are grounds for being sent to Hell.|$|E
