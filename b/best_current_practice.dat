5000|$|The HTTP/2 {{protocol}} also faced {{criticism for}} not supporting opportunistic encryption, a measure against passive monitoring {{similar to the}} STARTTLS mechanism {{that has long been}} available in other internet protocols like SMTP.

RFC7258/BCP188 mandates that passive monitoring to be considered as an attack, and protocols designed by IETF should take steps to protect against passive monitoring (for example, through the use of opportunistic encryption). A number of specifications for opportunistic encryption of HTTP/2 have been provided, of which draft-ietf-httpbis-http2-encryption-01 is an official work item of the working group.|$|E

The Distributed Mobility Management (DMM) Working Group is investigating the impact of decentralized mobility management to existing protocol solutions, while taking into account well defined requirements, which are to be met by a future solution. This document discusses DMM using a functional framework. Functional Entities to support DMM as well as reference points between these Functional Entities are introduced and described.

40|$|The goal of {{this work}} was to apply {{lightweight}} formal methods {{to the study of}} the security of the JavaScript language. Previous work has shown that lightweight formal methods present a new approach to the study of security in the context of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). The current work has attempted to codify <b>best</b> <b>current</b> <b>practices</b> in the form of a security model for JavaScript. Such a model is a necessary component in analyzing browser actions for vulnerabilities, but it is not sufficient. It is also required to capture actual browser event traces and incorporate these into the model. The work described herein demonstrates that it is (a) possible to construct a model for JavaScript security that captures important properties of <b>current</b> <b>best</b> <b>practices</b> within browsers; and (b) that an event translator has been written that captures the dynamic properties of browser site traversal in such a way that model analysis is tractable, and yields important information about the satisfaction or refutation of the static security rules...|$|R
50|$|One {{consequence}} of the new unacceptability of open relays was an inconvenience for some end users and certain internet service providers. To allow customers to use their e-mail addresses at Internet locations other than the company's systems (such as at school or work), many mail sites explicitly allowed open relaying so that customers could send e-mail via the ISP from any location. Once open relay became unacceptable because of abuse (and unusable because of blocking of open relays), ISPs and other sites had to adopt new protocols to allow remote users to send mail. These include smart hosts, SMTP-AUTH, POP before SMTP, {{and the use of}} virtual private networks (VPNs).
