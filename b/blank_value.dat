Arsenic analysis, its toxicity, and its fate in the environment have been broadly studied, still its <b>blank</b> <b>values,</b> adsorption to sampling materials and pre-concentration of water samples as well as stabilization of arsenic compounds in water samples under field conditions have been very little investigated.

Adsorption of arsenic compounds on different laboratory materials (80 %) and low transformation of arsenic compounds. Thus, concentrations as low as I ng As l(- 1) can be determined.

40|$|Objectives: Dust is {{generally}} sampled on a filter using air pumps, but passive sampling {{could be a}} cost-effective alternative. One promising passive sampler is the University of North Carolina passive aerosol sampler (UNC sampler). The {{aim of this study}} is to characterize and compare the UNC sampler’s performance with PM 10 and PM 2. 5 impactors in a working environment. Methods: Area sampling was carried out at different mining locations using UNC samplers in parallel with PM 2. 5 and PM 10 impactors. Two different collection surfaces, polycarbonate (PC) and carbon tabs (CT), were employed for the UNC sampling. Sampling was carried out for 4 – 25 hours. Results: The UNC samplers underestimated the concentrations compared to PM 10 and PM 2. 5 impactor data. At the location with the highest aerosol concentration, the time-averaged mean of PC showed 24 % and CT 35 % of the impactor result for PM 2. 5. For PM 10, it was 39 % with PC and 58 % with CT. Sample <b>blank</b> <b>values</b> differed between PC and CT. For PM 2. 5, PC <b>blank</b> <b>values</b> were ~ 7 times higher than those of CT, but only 1. 8 times higher for PM 10. The blank variations were larger for PC than for CT. Conclusions: Particle mass concentrations appear to be underestimated by the UNC sampler compared to impactors, more so for PM 2. 5 than for PM 10. CT may be preferred as a collection surface because the <b>blank</b> <b>values</b> were lower and less variable than for PC. Future validations in the working environment should include respirable dust sampling...|$|R

All the parameters regarding the sampler characteristics (<b>blank</b> <b>value,</b> desorption efficiency, storage before and after exposure, sampler integrity) {{were found to be}} consistent with the requirements of this protocol apart from the <b>blank</b> <b>value</b> which must be evaluated and subtracted at each sampling. The nominal uptake rate determined in laboratory conditions was 81. 5 ± 0. 3 cm³. min- 1. However, the uptake rate depends on the mass uptake, temperature and on the combination of temperature and humidity while it was found independent of the wind velocity and direction. Based on laboratory experiments, an empirical model has been established. Using this model, the agreement between the radial sampler and the reference methods was improved compared to the radial sampler results using the nominal uptake rate. This improvement was observed with the results of an international intercomparison of diffusive samplers and with the routine measurements at 5 European monitoring stations showing different meteorological and emission conditions. In this study, it was shown that by using the model equation of uptake rate, the data quality objective of 30 % for the expanded uncertainty is easily attained. Therefore, the ozone Radial sampler is an appropriate indicative method for monitoring ambient ozone. JRC. F. 8 -Sustainable Transpor...|$|E

As analytical techniques for OTC have improved in the past, problems with <b>blank</b> <b>values</b> and adsorption to container walls have been revealed. In this study, OTC adsorption to different materials was studied, and different {{methods such as}} derivatization, complexation, extraction, UV-light treatment, nitric acid baths, glowing at high temperatures, and rinsing with detergents and distilled water were tested to reduce OTC <b>blank</b> <b>values</b> from chemicals, solutions, and containers of different materials. Rinsing with detergents and distilled water was effective for decontaminating containers of different materials. Glowing at high temperatures was specifically suitable for glassware and chemicals with high melting points. UV-light treatment was suitable only for solutions. However, OTC underwent disproportionation, and tin became methylated under high temperatures and UV-light treatment. Methods combining sodium tetraethylborate and organic solvent extraction had the best decontamination effects among all methods but were not economical. Sodium borohydride provided another alternative but was less effective. However, use of sodium tetraethylborate and sodium borohydride was restricted to aqueous solution and in certain pH ranges. No material was found without adsorption of all OTC in this study. Tributyltin and dibutyltin adsorbed strongly in the Teflons, polyethylene, and silanized glass.

30|$|Each {{measurement}} {{is controlled}} by software especially written for this device. The software, written in Visual Basic, leads the user through a standard setup sequence, during which various study descriptions (e.g. isotope used) are entered and a sampling time sequence is set up. Besides its control and display features, it offers a variable integration time (VIT) smoothing the time-activity curve (TAC) as the count rate gets low. The VIT function calculates the relative uncertainty of N consecutive measurements based on their statistical fluctuation. The calculation is carried out by fitting a linear function to the log values after the peak (linear regression). The result is then compared to the coefficient of variation for each measurement defined as the reciprocal square root of its mean. If the outcome is smaller than the coefficient of variation, the software displays the last calculated value. As the statistical fluctuations increase with lower count rate, the number of consecutive measurement values is increased by steps of 2 up starting from N[*]=[*] 4 to a maximum value of N[*]=[*] 20. Hence, <b>blank</b> <b>value</b> and detection capability depend on the integration time chosen by the program during a measurement and the isotope used for investigation. The latter reason originates from the different positron emission probabilities. The software includes half-life correction, <b>blank</b> <b>value</b> correction and accounts for the time delay of the radioactive blood from the animal to the detector. Simultaneously with data acquisition, the arterial time-activity curve is visualized {{on the computer screen}} as well as saved to a csv file. Although the counts recorded can be used directly to derive the TAC, these features of the software make the whole system much more practicable and efficient.|$|E

The experiments were performed on 24 participants of the Austrian moderate altitude study (AMAS 2000) in Obertauern (Austria, 1. 700 m above sea level) and 24 individuals living in Berlin. The following test series showed no correlation between evaporation and skin temperature. A solid consideration of the mean value concerning the evaporation is, due to large inter-individual differences in <b>blank</b> <b>value</b> as well as measured values after the light exposure, not sufficient. A closer examination of the evaporation suggests the fragmentation into 3 different groups showing a mild (group 1, 52 %), moderate (group 2, 29 %) and intensive response (group 3, 19 %). The mild group (group 1) showed virtually no change while the intensive group (group 3) had a high <b>blank</b> <b>value</b> as well as a strong increase after the light exposure. Isolated peaks of the evaporation were measured in few of the 24 subjects from Berlin after extending the measuring period to 62 min. The cause and a possible relation to the VIP-light exposure remains indistinct but could be conceivable. The feed-forward learning theory meaning an active scanning process of the environment by the organism could be an explanation. What is remarkable is a 2 °C temperature increase 40 min after the VIP-light exposure above the exposed skin surface in 79 % of the 24 subjects from Berlin. A possible explanation could be an increased cell and immune activity.
