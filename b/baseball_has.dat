5|$|<b>Baseball</b> <b>has</b> certain {{attributes}} that set it {{apart from the}} other popular team sports in the countries where it has a following. All of these sports use a clock; in all of them, play is less individual and more collective; and in none {{of them is the}} variation between playing fields nearly as substantial or important. The comparison between cricket and baseball demonstrates that many of baseball's distinctive elements are shared in various ways with its cousin sports.|$|E
5|$|Major League Baseball is {{the highest}} level of play in North American {{professional}} baseball, and is the organization that operates the National League and the American League. In 2000, the two leagues were officially disbanded as separate legal entities, and all of their rights and functions were consolidated in the commissioner's office. Since that time, Major League <b>Baseball</b> <b>has</b> operated as a single league, and constitutes one of the major professional sports leagues of the United States. It is composed of 30 teams.|$|E

5|$|<b>Baseball</b> <b>has</b> also {{inspired}} {{the creation of}} new cultural forms. Baseball cards were introduced in the late 19th century as trade cards. A typical example would feature an image of a baseball player on one side and advertising for a business on the other. In the early 1900s they were produced widely as promotional items by tobacco and confectionery companies. The 1930s saw the popularization of the modern style of baseball card, with a player photograph accompanied on the rear by statistics and biographical data. Baseball cards—many of which are now prized collectibles—are the source of the much broader trading card industry, involving similar products for different sports and non-sports-related fields.|$|E
5|$|<b>Baseball</b> <b>has</b> had a broad {{impact on}} popular culture, {{both in the}} United States and elsewhere. Dozens of English-language idioms have been derived from baseball; in particular, the game {{is the source of}} a number of widely used sexual euphemisms. The first {{networked}} radio broadcasts in North America were of the 1922 World Series: famed sportswriter Grantland Rice announced play-by-play from New York City's Polo Grounds on WJZ–Newark, New Jersey, which was connected by wire to WGY–Schenectady, New York, and WBZ–Springfield, Massachusetts. The baseball cap has become a ubiquitous fashion item not only in the United States and Japan, but also in countries where the sport itself is not particularly popular, such as the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|In clock-limited sports, games {{often end}} with a team that holds the lead killing the clock rather than {{competing}} aggressively against the opposing team. In contrast, <b>baseball</b> <b>has</b> no clock; a team cannot win without getting the last batter out and rallies are not constrained by time. At almost any turn in any baseball game, the most advantageous strategy is some form of aggressive strategy. In contrast, again, the clock comes into play even {{in the case of}} multi-day Test and first-class cricket: the possibility of a draw often encourages a team that is batting last and well behind to bat defensively, giving up any faint chance at a win to avoid a loss. Baseball offers no such reward for conservative batting.|$|E

5|$|Players on {{the batting}} team take turns hitting against the pitcher of the fielding team, which tries to prevent runs by getting hitters out {{in any of}} several ways. A player on the batting team who reaches a base safely can later attempt to advance to {{subsequent}} bases during teammates' turns batting, such as on a hit or by other means. The teams switch between batting and fielding whenever the fielding team records three outs. One turn batting for both teams, beginning with the visiting team, constitutes an inning. A game is composed of nine innings, and {{the team with the}} greater number of runs {{at the end of the}} game wins. If scores are tied at the end of nine innings, extra innings are usually played. <b>Baseball</b> <b>has</b> no game clock, although most games end in the ninth inning.|$|E
5|$|A varsity {{baseball}} team is an established part {{of physical education}} departments at most high schools and colleges in the United States. In 2008, {{nearly half a million}} high schoolers and over 35,000 collegians played on their schools' {{baseball team}}s. The number of Americans participating in <b>baseball</b> <b>has</b> declined since the late 1980s, falling well behind the number of soccer participants. By early in the 20th century, intercollegiate baseball was Japan's leading sport. Today, high school baseball in particular is immensely popular there. The final rounds of the two annual tournaments—the National High School Baseball Invitational Tournament in the spring, and the even more important National High School Baseball Championship in the summer—are broadcast around the country. The tournaments are known, respectively, as Spring Koshien and Summer Koshien after the 55,000-capacity stadium where they are played. In Cuba, baseball is a mandatory part of the state system of physical education, which begins at age six. Talented children as young as seven are sent to special district schools for more intensive training—the first step on a ladder whose acme is the national baseball team.|$|E
5|$|American {{football}} is by several measures {{the most popular}} spectator sport; the National Football League (NFL) has the highest average attendance of any sports league in the world, and the Super Bowl is watched by millions globally. <b>Baseball</b> <b>has</b> been regarded as the U.S. national sport since the late 19th century, with Major League Baseball (MLB) being the top league. Basketball and ice hockey are the country's next two leading professional team sports, with the top leagues being the National Basketball Association (NBA) and the National Hockey League (NHL). These four major sports, when played professionally, each occupy a season at different, but overlapping, times of the year. College football and basketball attract large audiences. In soccer, the country hosted the 1994 FIFA World Cup, the men's national soccer team qualified for ten World Cups and the women's team has won the FIFA Women's World Cup three times; Major League Soccer is the sport's highest league in the United States (featuring 19 American and 3 Canadian teams).|$|E

5|$|In 1955 Pierce again {{started the}} All-Star Game, {{going into the}} All-Star break {{with a record of}} just 5–6 in spite of his 2.11 ERA; in his last two starts before the break, he {{suffered}} back-to-back 1–0 losses to Early Wynn and Bob Lemon of the Indians. In the All-Star Game he allowed only one baserunner through three innings (a leadoff single by Red Schoendienst, who was thrown out on a steal attempt); he staked the AL to a 4–0 lead, but the National League came back for a 6–5 win in 10 innings after scoring five runs off Whitey Ford in the seventh and eighth innings. Pierce ended the season with the league lead in ERA (although his record was just 15–10), with his mark of 1.97 being the lowest by a major league pitcher between Hal Newhouser in 1946 (1.94) and Sandy Koufax in 1963 (1.88); he led the major leagues by nearly two thirds of a run, with Ford having the next best mark at 2.63. Total <b>Baseball</b> <b>has</b> rated Pierce as the best pitcher in the major leagues in 1955, after having placed him among the AL's top five pitchers each year from 1951 to 1953.|$|E
