40|$|The paper {{reviews the}} V/STOL {{aircraft}} designs pursued by industry from 1971 to 1978, {{with emphasis on}} the 1975 - 1978 period. Consideration is given to those designs pertaining to vertical-attitude and horizontal-attitude V/STOL types. These are divided into such concepts as tilting jet <b>engine,</b> lift/cruise <b>engine,</b> <b>lift</b> <b>engine,</b> lift/cruise fan, ejector augmentor, tilt rotor, stowed rotor, and rotor wing...|$|R

5000|$|In 2011, Suzuki {{launched}} the Alto Eco variant, that features the R06A <b>engine</b> <b>lifted</b> from the Suzuki MR Wagon and an idling stop function. It {{is capable of}} reaching the fuel economy of 30.2 km/L (71MPG) based on Japan's JC08 Mode test cycle (32 km/L under 10-15 test cycle). This is [...]2 km/L higher than the Daihatsu Mira e:S.|$|R
2500|$|Around {{the same}} time, {{the company was}} {{contracted}} to strengthen the engine foundations of the transport [...] In order to achieve this, the engine-room superstructure {{had to be removed}} and the <b>engines</b> <b>lifted</b> out of the way. Using a combination of steam jacks, screw jacks and chain blocks, this task was completed by the company's riggers in the space of seven hours.|$|R
25|$|In all, eight {{different}} engines {{were used in}} the back of T51s in championship races, with 2.2- and 1.5-litre Climax engines in addition to the standard 2.5: Scuderia Centro Sud and others used 2.5 and 1.5-litre engines from Maserati; the British Racing Partnership team used F2 powerplants from Borgward; Scuderia Eugenio Castellotti used their own Ferrari-derived 2.5-litre units; and one car used a Ferrari 2-litre <b>engine</b> <b>lifted</b> from a 625LM.|$|R

50|$|Rocket engines can {{certainly}} {{be used to}} increase and decrease {{the speed of the}} spacecraft. However, rocket thrust takes propellant, propellant has mass, and even a small increment Δv (delta-v) in velocity translates to a far larger requirement for propellant needed to escape Earth's gravity well. This is because not only must the primary-stage <b>engines</b> <b>lift</b> the extra propellant, they must also lift more propellant still, to lift that additional propellant. Thus the liftoff mass requirement increases exponentially with an increase in the required delta-v of the spacecraft.|$|R
5000|$|S&S was {{the first}} {{motorcycle}} engine manufacturer to produce pre-certified United States Environmental Protection Agency compliant <b>engines,</b> <b>lifting</b> the burden and cost of performing the complicated EPA testing procedures from the companies and enthusiasts who buy S&S engines. The company also produces TÜV certified engines, and has even succeeded in complying with California's unique emissions requirements. [...] S&S is the only motorcycle {{company in the world}} to manufacture Knucklehead, Shovelhead, Panhead, Evolution-style engines and Twin-cam style engines. S&S manufactures the largest (143 cu. in.) engine to fit a stock Harley-Davidson frame.|$|R

25|$|The {{suggested}} minimum noise take-off {{technique for}} the HS.141 {{was to use}} full power from the <b>lift</b> <b>engines</b> in a vertical climb to 250ft(76m) then reducing power to 83% to continue this climb to 1,000ft (300m). At this height the aircraft would transition into forward flight using vectored thrust from the <b>lift</b> <b>engines</b> and then accelerate and climb to 2,000ft (600m) using increasing thrust from the cruise engines. By this stage the aircraft would have reached an airspeed of 168knots (310km/h) and would be fully supported by its wings alone, the <b>lift</b> <b>engines</b> being shut down and covered by hinged doors.|$|R
60|$|After {{the passing}} of the centre the {{barometer}} began to rise. Equally rapid was the fall of the wind. When it {{was no more than a}} howling gale, the <b>engine</b> <b>lifted</b> up in the air, parted its bed-plates with a last convulsive effort of its forty horsepower, and lay down on its side. A wash of water from the bilge sizzled over it and the steam arose in clouds. The engineer wailed his dismay, but Grief glanced over the wreck affectionately and went into the cabin to swab the grease off his chest and arms with bunches of cotton waste.|$|R
50|$|Built of {{aluminum}} alloy trusses, the LLRVs were {{powered by a}} General Electric CF700-2V turbofan engine with a thrust of 4,200 lbf (19 kN), mounted vertically in a gimbal. The <b>engine</b> <b>lifted</b> the vehicle to the test altitude and was then throttled back to support five-sixths of the vehicle's weight, simulating the reduced gravity of the Moon. Two hydrogen peroxide lift rockets with thrust that could be varied from 100 to 500 lbf (440 to 2,200 N) handled the vehicle's rate of descent and horizontal movement. Sixteen smaller hydrogen peroxide thrusters, mounted in pairs, gave the pilot control in pitch, yaw and roll.|$|R

25|$|Since the Rolls-Royce RB162 <b>lift</b> <b>engines</b> {{specified}} for the Mirage IIIV {{were not}} expected to be available before 1963, Dassault modified the first Mirage III prototype to serve as an interim VTOL testbed. Eight Rolls-Royce RB108 <b>lift</b> <b>engines</b> were installed, each with an average maximum takeoff thrust of 9.83kN (2,210lbf). The Mirage III's SNECMA Atar G.2 propulsion engine was replaced with an unreheated (non-afterburning) Bristol Siddeley Orpheus BOr 3 with a thrust of 21.57kN (4,850lbf).

5000|$|The Langlaagte Stamp mill or battery as {{they were}} called in the gold rush era of Johannesburg, {{is one of the}} few that have survived from the Robinson Mine in Langlaagte. Located at Main Street in Johannesburg, the 10 stamp mill went into {{operation}} at the Robinson Mine in Langlaagte in September 1886, in the earliest stamp mills on the Witwatersrand. Stamp mills were invented in Europe in the 1600s to crush ore to extract minerals, especially gold.
