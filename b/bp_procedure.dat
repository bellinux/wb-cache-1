The Person-Based Approach can help intervention developers to improve their interventions to ensure more successful implementation. This study {{provides an example of}} using the Person-Based Approach to refine a digital intervention for hypertension (HOME BP). METHODS: Our Person-Based Approach involved conducting qualitative focus groups with practice staff to explore their perceptions of HOME BP and to identify any potential barriers to implementation of the HOME <b>BP</b> <b>procedures.</b> We took an iterative approach moving between data collection, analysis and modifications to the HOME BP intervention, followed by further data collection. The data was analysed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: Many aspects of HOME BP appeared to be acceptable, persuasive and feasible to implement. Practitioners perceived benefits in using HOME BP, including that it could empower patients to self-manage their health, potentially overcome clinical inertia around prescribing medication and save both the patient and practitioner time. However, practitioners also had some concerns. Some practitioners were concerned about the accuracy of patients' home blood pressure readings, or the potential for home monitoring to cause patients anxiety and therefore increase consultations. Some GPs lacked confidence in choosing multiple medication changes, or had concerns about unanticipated drug interactions. A few nurses were concerned that the model of patient support they were asked to provide was not consistent with their perceived role. Modifications were made to the intervention based on this feedback, which appeared to help overcome practitioners' concerns and improve the acceptability and feasibility of the intervention.

40|$|A {{method that}} allows us to give a {{different}} treatment to any neuron inside feedforward neural networks is presented. The algorithm has been implemented with two very different learning methods: a standard Back-propagation (<b>BP)</b> <b>procedure</b> and an evolutionary algorithm. First, we have demonstrated that the EA training method converges faster and gives more accurate results than BP. Then we have made a full analysis of the effects of turning off different combinations of neurons after the training phase. We demonstrate that EA is much more robust than BP for all the cases under study. Even in the case when two hidden neurons are lost, EA training is still able to give good average results. This difference implies that we must be very careful when pruning or redundancy effects are being studied since the network performance when losing neurons strongly depends on the training method. Moreover, the influence of the individual inputs will also depend on the training algorithm. Since EA keeps a good classification performance when units are lost, this method could {{be a good way to}} simulate biological learning systems since they must be robust against deficient neuron performance. Although biological systems are much more complex than the simulations shown in this article, we propose that a smart training strategy such as the one shown here could be considered as a first protection against the losing of a certain number of neurons...|$|E
40|$|Global {{assessment}} of the spatiotemporal variability in terrestrial total water storage anomalies (TWSA) in response to hydrologic extremes is critical for water resources management. Using TWSA derived from the gravity recovery and climate experiment (GRACE) satellites, this study systematically assessed the skill of the TWSA-climatology (TC) approach and breakpoint (BP) detection method for identifying large-scale hydrologic extremes. The TC approach calculates standardized anomalies by using the {{mean and standard deviation}} of the GRACE TWSA corresponding to each month. In the BP detection method, the empirical mode decomposition (EMD) is first applied to identify the mean return period of TWSA extremes, and then a statistical procedure is used to identify the actual occurrence times of abrupt changes (i. e., BPs) in TWSA. Both detection methods were demonstrated on basin-averaged TWSA time series for the world’s 35 largest river basins. A nonlinear event coincidence analysis measure was applied to cross-examine abrupt changes detected by these methods with those detected by the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI). Results show that our EMD-assisted <b>BP</b> <b>procedure</b> is a promising tool for identifying hydrologic extremes using GRACE TWSA data. Abrupt changes detected by the BP method coincide well with those of the SPI anomalies and with documented hydrologic extreme events. Event timings obtained by the TC method were ambiguous for a number of river basins studied, probably because the GRACE data length is too short to derive long-term climatology at this time. The BP approach demonstrates a robust wet-dry anomaly detection capability, which will be important for applications with the upcoming GRACE Follow-On mission...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Next Generation Sequencing {{technologies}} {{are able to}} provide high genome coverages at a relatively low cost. However, due to limited reads' length (from 30 bp up to 200 bp), specific bioinformatics problems have become {{even more difficult to}} solve. De novo assembly with short reads, for example, is more complicated at least for two reasons: first, the overall amount of "noisy" data to cope with increased and, second, as the reads' length decreases the number of unsolvable repeats grows. Our work's aim is to go {{at the root of the}} problem by providing a pre-processing tool capable to produce (in-silico) longer and highly accurate sequences from a collection of Next Generation Sequencing reads. Results In this paper a seed-and-extend local assembler is presented. The kernel algorithm is a loop that, starting from a read used as seed, keeps extending it using heuristics whose main goal is to produce a collection of error-free and longer sequences. In particular, GapFiller carefully detects reliable overlaps and operates clustering similar reads in order to reconstruct the missing part between the two ends of the same insert. Our tool's output has been validated on 24 experiments using both simulated and real paired reads datasets. The output sequences are declared correct when the seed-mate is found. In the experiments performed, GapFiller was able to extend high percentages of the processed seeds and find their mates, with a false positives rate that turned out to be nearly negligible. Conclusions GapFiller, starting from a sufficiently high short reads coverage, is able to produce high coverages of accurate longer sequences (from 300 bp up to 3500 <b>bp).</b> The <b>procedure</b> to perform safe extensions, together with the mate-found check, turned out to be a powerful criterion to guarantee contigs' correctness.

The reacted oxidant corresponds to the drug content. Different variables affecting the reaction between drugs and dichromate were studied and optimized.

Optimal temperature and time for coupling were established at 50 and 60  °C with coupling time ranging from 15 to 20  min.

40|$|Background This paper {{describes}} {{current state}} of evaluation of automatic BP devices in Slovenia and internationally. Conclusions In the last decades, non-invasive automatic blood pressure (BP) measurement devices are used with increasing regularity over manual devices. Advantages of automatic (mainly oscillometric) devices over manual mercury-in-glass and aneroid devices are smaller reading error, better reliability and repeatability and lesser environmental hazard. They suffer from larger sensitivity to physiological parameters like arm circumference, arrhythmias and vessel properties. In practice, their main problem is their built-in calculative algorithm which estimates/calculates blood pressure level from pressure pulses in the cuff. Namely, the algorithms are proprietary and hidden, which makes reliable evaluation of devices practically impossible. Evaluation of BP devices is well researched and regulated by recommendations, standards and legislation. Like {{in the majority of}} countries, the national legislation of the Republic of Slovenia prescribes the procedures for evaluation of manual and automatic <b>BP</b> measurement devices. <b>Procedures</b> include tests in the field of physical quantity of pressure, which are not always applicable to measurement of physiological parameter of blood pressure. While procedures and tests are adequate for the manual BP devices, they are insufficient for the reliable evaluation of the automatic devices. The measuring accuracy of the automatic device is not assessed. The users (patients and physicians) have to trust the accuracy statements (given by the producers or independent institutions) and believe that the device will perform equally reliable despite of all extraneous mechanical and electromagnetic stress factors from environment over its entire life expectancy...|$|R
40|$|Using the {{computer}} program GeneMark, the open reading frames (ORFs) previously assigned within the one megabase sequence data of the genome of the cyanobacterium, Synechocystis sp. strain PCC 6803 (Kaneko et al., DNA Res. 2 : 153 - 166, 1995), were re-examined. Matrices required by GeneMark for its statistical calculation were generated and modified by running a script termed GeneMark-Genesis that performed recursive application of GeneMark against the Synechocystis data and evaluated the probability scores for optimization. Based on the matrices thus generated, 752 of the 818 previously assigned ORFs (92 %) were supported by GeneMark as likely coding sequences, of which 26 were predicted to start at more internal positions than previously assigned. In addition, 50 ORFs were newly identified as likely coding sequences, most of them being shorter than 300 <b>bp.</b> Thus, the <b>procedure</b> was proven to be very powerful to locate likely coding regions within the genomic sequence data of Synechocystis without having prior information concerning their similarity to the genes of other organisms. However, GeneMark did not predict 66 previously assigned ORFs as likely genes: 14 of them showed significant degrees of similarity to known genes and 10 others were found within IS-like elements. It seems that these genes, many of which appear to be of exogenous origin, escaped detection by GeneMark {{as in the case}} of "class 3 (horizontally transferred) genes " of E. coli, which in turn suggests that genes of different phylogenetic origins might also be detected as such by modifying the matrices.

40|$|Serial {{analysis}} of gene expression (SAGE) {{is a widely}} used technique for large-scale transcriptome analysis in mammalian systems. Recently, a modified version called LongSAGE (S. Saha, A. B. Sparks, C. Rago, V. Akmaev, C. J. Wang, B. Vogelstein, K. W. Kinzler [2002] Nat Biotechnol 20 : 508 - 512) was reported by increasing tag length up to 21 <b>bp.</b> Although the <b>procedures</b> for these two methods are similar, a detailed protocol for LongSAGE library construction has not been reported yet, and several technical difficulties associated with concatemer cloning and purification have not been solved. In this study, we report a substantially improved LongSAGE method called Robust-LongSAGE, which has four major improvements {{when compared with the}} previously reported protocols. First, a small amount of mRNA (50 ng) was enough for a library construction. Second, enhancement of cDNA adapter and ditag formation was achieved through an extended ligation period (overnight). Third, only 20 ditag polymerase chain reactions were needed to obtain a complete library (up to 90 % reduction compared with the original protocols). Fourth, concatemers were partially digested with NlaIII before cloning into vector (pZEro- 1), greatly improving cloning efficiency. The significant contribution of Robust-LongSAGE is that it solved the major technical difficulties, such as low cloning efficiency and small insert sizes associated with existing SAGE and LongSAGE protocols. Using this protocol, one can generate two to three libraries, each containing over 4. 5 million tags, within a month. We recently have constructed five libraries from rice (Oryza sativa), one from maize (Zea mays), and one from the rice blast fungus (Magnaporthe grisea) ...|$|R
40|$|C 4 b-binding protein (C 4 BP) is a multimeric plasma protein, which {{regulates the}} {{classical}} pathway of the C system. C 4 BP {{functions as a}} cofactor to factor I in the degradation of C 4 b and accelerates the decay rate of the C 4 b 2 a complex. We now demonstrate that C 4 b contains a binding site for C 4 BP, which is localized on the alpha'-chain of C 4 b. SDS-PAGE of C C 4 and C 4 b both under reducing and nonreducing conditions {{was followed by a}} radiolabeled C 4 <b>BP</b> ligand blotting <b>procedure.</b> It was demonstrated that the C 4 BP binding site on C 4 b is localized on the alpha'-chain. In addition, we found C 4 BP binding to the alpha-chain of C 4, which suggests that the binding site for C 4 BP becomes available after reduction of the C 4 molecule. Direct binding of C 4 BP to the alpha- and alpha'-chains of C 4 and C 4 b was demonstrated in a radio-labeled C 4 BP binding assay with the reduced and alkylated isolated chains. mAb against the alpha'-chain of C 4 b were prepared, characterized, and evaluated for their ability to block the binding of 125 I-C 4 BP to C 4 b. Two mAb specific for the alpha'-chain of C 4 b were found that completely abolished C 4 BP binding to intact C 4 b. Other mAb recognizing both the alpha- and alpha'-chain of C 4 and C 4 b demonstrated only minor inhibitory effect on the binding of C 4 BP to C 4 b. In conclusion, we have localized the C 4 BP binding site on the alpha'-chain of C 4 b and have demonstrated that this binding can be inhibited by mAb specific for the alpha'-chai...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: The primary {{objective}} was to compare the effectiveness in pain relief of intracorpus spongiosum block (ICSB) versus intraurethral topical anesthesia (TA) using 2 % lignocaine jelly for performing visual internal urethrotomy (VIU) for short segment anterior urethral strictures. Materials and Methods: It was a randomized, parallel group controlled trial. Participants are adult patients with a single anterior urethral stricture up to 2 cm in length. Patients were allocated to two intervention groups with thirty patients in each group. For anesthesia of the urethra, Group 1 patients received ICSB whereas Group 2 patients received intraurethral TA using 2 % lignocaine jelly before VIU. Patient discomfort was assessed with visual analog scale (VAS) during the procedure and 1 h postprocedure. The {{increase in pulse rate}} and the change in systolic blood pressure (<b>BP)</b> during the <b>procedure</b> were recorded. The procedure was considered successful if there was absence of symptoms or signs of recurrent stricture and ability to pass freely 18 Fr catheter during urethral calibration at last follow-up. Results: From March 2014 to June 2015, sixty patients were randomized into two groups of thirty patients each. The mean (±standard deviation) intraoperative VAS score was 2. 8 ± 1. 1 in Group 1, which was significantly less (P < 0. 05) than the 5. 6 ± 1. 7 score in Group 2. The mean 1 h postoperative VAS score was also significantly lower in Group 1 patients (1. 0 ± 1. 0) than in Group 2 patients (3. 2 ± 1. 5). The change in pulse rate was significantly greater in Group 2 (21. 3 ± 10. 1 beats/min) than in Group 1 (10. 6 ± 4. 6 beats/min, P < 0. 05). The change in systolic BP was also significantly higher in Group 2 (16. 3 ± 8. 6 mmHg) than in Group 1 (9. 1 ± 4. 4 mmHg, P < 0. 05). The stricture-free rate at 6 -month after VIU in Group 1 and Group 2 patients were 88. 5 % and 89. 6 %, respectively. Conclusions: ICSB has better pain control with similar complication and recurrence rate than intraurethral lignocaine jelly alone in VIU...|$|R
