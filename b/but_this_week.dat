500|$|Reviews of {{the episode}} were mostly mixed, calling the storyline [...] "a {{loudspeaker}} for political views." [...] Kevin McFarland of The A.V. Club wrote {{of the episode}}, [...] "I {{had a hard time}} listening to the characters spout out opinions, since none of them really made sense as character views and felt distinctly like the writers just wanted a place to dump their liberalisms – I don't want to only call out Seth MacFarlane because he didn't write this episode, but considering the little bit I know about the show's writer's room, it's pretty safe to assume he has final say on this sort of thing, especially given his 9/11 experience." [...] He also compared the A-story to the television series South Park, noting, [...] "It's very clear that South Park benefits from the short turnaround time between production and air, because it allows that show to comment very quickly on current events, and stay timely. Family Guy seems to do the exact opposite, waiting an extraordinarily long time to weigh in on a serious issue it doesn’t satirize for comedy." [...] He ended his review by commenting, [...] "After last week's bright spot, I knew we were headed back down for another helping of the usual misery, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>week</b> offered neither a surprise nor an all-out failure, just expected, bland mediocrity." [...] He graded the episode as a C. In a much more positive review, Terren R. Moore of Ology, writing, [...] "It's just funny, and it's got a lot of ways of achieving that funniness, and it's definitely true that the show isn't always in its best form, but [...] "Thanksgiving" [...] shows that Family Guy refuses to be dead yet." [...] He also praised the episode for giving each character their own part in the episode, adding, [...] "while most of the story revolves around Joe, Kevin, and Peter, the three kids and Brian also get time in as well." [...] Moore also stated his enjoyment of the cultural references in the episode, stating, [...] "It's all good fun, and the cutaways are also top notch, including Peter's First Holiday and The Cowardly Lion as Lindsay Lohan's gynecologist. I nearly fell out when Peter described his probably-black coworker {{who turned out to be}} a white guy, which I should have seen coming because it's very Family Guy, but still managed to get a laugh out of me." [...] He gave the episode a nine out of ten.|$|E

Now, if Dick gets well enough to work again he'll be able to earn enough to pay the {{interest}} on it; and if he doesn't I know Captain Jim'll manage someway that Leslie won't have to. He said as much to me. 'I'm getting old, Cornelia,' he said, 'and I've no chick or child of my own. Leslie won't take a gift from a living man, but mebbe she will from a dead one.' So {{it will be all}} right as far as THAT goes. I wish everything else might be settled as satisfactorily. As for that wretch of a Dick, he's been awful these last few days. The devil was in him, believe ME! Leslie and I couldn't get on with our work for the tricks he'd play. He chased all her ducks one day around the yard till most of them died. And not one thing would he do for us. Sometimes, you know, he'll make himself quite handy, bringing in pails of water and wood. <b>But</b> <b>this</b> <b>week</b> if we sent him to the well he'd try to climb down into it. I thought once, 'If you'd only shoot down there head-first everything would be nicely settled.'" ...|$|E

5000|$|IGN writer Eric Goldman {{gave the}} episode an 8 out of 10, and pinpointed the episode's theme as [...] "insecurity". Paste Magazine writer Bonnie Stiernberg criticized the episode, saying: [...] "It’s not that 'Dark Shadows' wasn’t a good episode—it was. <b>But</b> <b>this</b> <b>week’s</b> theme {{felt a little}} heavy-handed; nearly every character’s storyline was {{dominated}} by it in an obvious manner." ...|$|R
5000|$|The story <b>this</b> <b>week</b> is a {{good one}} and it isn’t just a case of the week, it’s also tied {{directly}} into the mythology of the series. Actually, every case of the week is tied to the mythology <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>week’s</b> story is directly connected to the shady people that the Fringe team is searching for. By the end of the episode, the mystery becomes extremely compelling and finally Fringe hits that special place of TV series addiction reserved for shows like LOST and Battlestar Galactica. — Stephen Lackey, Mania.com ...|$|R
5000|$|Shannon Vestal from Buzzsugar gave a good {{review to}} the episode saying that finally, {{after years of}} waiting, Katherine is dead.

Maybe now with Katherine gone, we can move on to new, more exciting things, hopefully!" ...|$|E
5000|$|Michael Adams of 411mania {{rated the}} episode with 9/10 {{saying that it}} was great and praised Philip Baker Hall's character, Walt, who [...] "stole" [...] the episode. [...] "Call him Walt, call him Mr.Kleezak, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>week,</b> call him Character of the Week! In an episode where {{everyone}} had their moments and lots of funny stuff was happening, he was hands down the funniest part of the episode.

[...] "I'll find them eventually and strangle them, because that's not how you do business," [...] Ramsey said, noting that two people on his own staff have accounts with PerkStreet.|$|E
5000|$|Steve Marsi of TV Fanatic {{rated the}} episode with 4.5/5 {{saying that it}} was not his {{favorite}} but it was still very strong and heavy on emotion. [...] "The show's propensity for shocking twists in the final moments is something fans know well, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>week's</b> concluding sequence probably left even more jaws on the floor than usual. What had been a slow-building, somewhat melodramatic episode suddenly changed course with not one, but two huge developments heading into next week." ...|$|R

5000|$|Christine Horton of Den of Geek wrote, [...] "This tried-and-test formula {{can be an}} {{interesting}} hook, if handled well. <b>But</b> <b>this</b> <b>week's</b> plot involving mobsters, revenge and trials for a fair maiden's hand {{was just a little}} underwhelming on all fronts. The two-bit gangster {{at the heart of the}} story was a walking cliché (anyone else expecting him to tell one of his goons to 'fuhgeddaboudit'?), the identity of the killer was obvious from the opening minutes, the revenge angle turned out to be tenuous, and, frankly, we weren't seeing anything new about which to get excited." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "I {{hesitate}} to brand any single episode of a complicated series as Best Episode Ever, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>week</b> comes darned close. In a season marked by outstanding writing, this hour of Fringe brilliantly resolved several ongoing storylines, {{while at the}} same time bringing to the fore some long-simmering conflicts which will enrich the next half-season. All while keeping the pace and the emotional tension at a rolling boil. For me, television just does not get better than this kind of science fiction, balancing the gee-whiz Big Idea with the small and intimate moments between characters that make them real and vital."

5000|$|Radley Balko, a Washington Post journalist, in March 2014 {{wrote that}} the [...] "biggest barrier to {{lawsuits}} against police officers is the doctrine of qualified immunity. It isn’t enough {{to show that a}} cop violated your rights. To even get in front of a jury, you must also show that the rights the officer violated were “well established” {{at the time of the}} incident. The tactics Reichert used in Huff’s case are fairly common, so Huff surviving qualified immunity was far from a sure thing. <b>But</b> <b>this</b> <b>week,</b> the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit rejected Reichert’s qualified immunity claim and will allow Huff's suit to go forward." ...|$|E
5000|$|Nick Hogan of TV Overmind {{gave the}} episode a 4 star rating out of 5, writing [...] "As {{we get to}} the end of the season, we have to wonder about whether there will be a 4th season of Gotham. I don’t think that their story is over, and it only gets better as it goes along. Wacky, insane Gotham is the best Gotham." [...] Amanda Bell of EW gave the episode a [...] "B" [...] and wrote, [...] "Last week, we were officially {{introduced}} to the Riddler, a.k.a. the new Ed Nygma, endless font of wacky wordplay. <b>But</b> <b>this</b> <b>week,</b> Gothams newest supervillain is completely MIA while the rest of the puzzle pieces come into play." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "The Good Soldier" [...] {{received}} positive reviews. The A.V. Club's Kevin McFarland {{gave the}} episode a [...] "B" [...] grade and wrote, [...] "Episodes like 'The Good Soldier' fall into my least favorite type of case structure on Grimm: episodic crime plots that don't reveal or advance {{anything about the}} central characters. Last week's episode spotlighted Hank and showed him getting {{back in the game}} while working on a case. <b>But</b> <b>this</b> <b>week's</b> plot didn't involve the Airstream until the final 10 minutes, instead featuring a didactic missive against military contractors given immunity from prosecution in American war zones. However, rarely has an episode of Grimm culminated in such an outright cool fight sequence that didn't involve the main characters. So as far as episodes like this go, 'The Good Soldier' is probably my favorite." ...|$|R
5000|$|Darren Orf of EW stated: [...] "Gothams {{first season}} ends {{much as it}} lived—with confusion, poorly plotted scenes and by {{turning a blind eye}} to {{everything}} that makes Batman great. To say 'All Happy Families Are Alike' is a letdown would be to expect too much from this finale to begin with. <b>But</b> after <b>this</b> <b>week's</b> episode finally cuts to black and the credits roll, it’s hard not to feel like the entire first year was a missed opportunity." ...|$|R
500|$|The episode {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from television critics. Eric Goldman of IGN gave the episode an 8 out of 10, indicating {{that it was}} [...] "great". While calling Veronica [...] "not likable at all" [...] in the episode, he praised {{the second half of}} the episode, particularly the final sequence involving a drugged Veronica. He wrote, [...] "Veronica Mars seems to slowly be getting back on track. There are still some problems to be sure, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>week's</b> episode was a good one, and most notably, built towards some very strong scenes in the second half." [...] Price Peterson, writing for TV.com, was also positive towards the episode, writing [...] "This was good! I liked all of the scenes of Piz sleeping on the floor. And as much as it freaks me out to see Veronica in harm's way (I shouldn't be watching TV, apparently), I appreciated the forward momentum in this plotline."

Before the match both Máximo and Mr. Niebla tried to persuade KeMonito to join their side and team up with the comedic Peste con Amour duo. Initially KeMonito refused, but when Shocker accidentally dropkicked KeMonotio during the match the blue mascot got angry and walked off turning his back on Shocker. In the end Shocker, Toscano and La Máscara won the match, two falls to one.|$|E
5000|$|Samantha Highfill of EW stated: [...] "There {{are many}} {{different}} types of Supernatural episodes. Last week was an example of a more innovative, format-bending hour. <b>But</b> <b>this</b> <b>week</b> was another Supernatural essential: The classic case of the week (that beautifully ties into the greater story arc). Here's how these seem to go: There's a murder. Sam and Dean get on the case. Sam and Dean hit a bump... until there's a second murder. Then and only then do they really get involved. Then they usually find themselves in a highly dangerous situation — oftentimes tied up — and they come out victorious. It might sound like it gets boring, but when done well, it really doesn't. And this show does it well." ...|$|E

The fourth match of the night saw Los Hijos del Averno (Averno, Ephesto and Mephisto) defeat the team of Blue Panther, Rush and El Sagrado in three falls. Blue Panther almost won the final fall as he had Mephisto in a pinning predicament but Averno threw a glass of beer in Panther's face, allowing his team mate to pick up the deciding fall.|$|E
5000|$|Alan Sepinwall of HitFix wrote, [...] "'Potage' did {{a strong}} job of {{continuing}} to explore the themes of the series (what it means to kill someone, the emotional toll it takes, etc.), {{and the relationship between}} Lecter and Will, and it continued the story of Garrett Jacob Hobbs through the story of his daughter Abigail. Though we've had a standalone killer in last week's mushroom man, it's important for the series to depict the lingering aftermath of these horrific crimes." [...] Laura Akers of Den of Geek wrote, [...] "But the question that Hannibal has been asking approaches the problem from a slightly different angle: 'Is Abigail Hobbs capable of doing this terrible thing?' The show has clearly established the guilt of her father, a serial killer who took the lives of eight girls who resembled his daughter. <b>But</b> <b>this</b> <b>week's</b> Potage focuses on the possibility that Abigail was not just his victim, but his accomplice." ...|$|R
