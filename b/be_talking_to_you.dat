6000|$|... 'No; I do {{not believe}} the woman's statement. If I did, I should not <b>be</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> now. The woman has {{probably}} lied, and is probably a tool in the hands of others for raising money, as you have already suggested. But, according to your own showing there has been much in your life to authorise the statement. I do not know what does or does not constitute a marriage there.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Quite true, Mahatma. If it {{were here}} I could not <b>be</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> could I? As {{a matter of}} fact, I have no body now. It is--oh, never mind where. Still, {{you can see the}} grey tufts, can't you? Well, I only hope that those shot hurt that fat boy half as much as they did me. No, I don't mean that I hope it now, I used to hope it." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I don't {{know you}} and you don't know me. That is why I {{want to tell you}} about it. I must tell somebody, and if I told anybody I knew, they'd tell it all over Halifax. It is dreadful to <b>be</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> like this. Beatrix would have three fits, one after the other, if she saw me. But Beatrix is a slave to conventionality. I glory in {{discarding}} it at times. You don't mind, do you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, {{and nearly}} drowned. I fell in while running from those terrible warriors, and I've been {{standing}} in this damp hole ever since, {{with my head}} just above the water. It's lucky the well was no deeper, for had my head been under water, instead of above it--hoo, hoo, hoo, keek, eek!--under instead of over, you know--why, then I wouldn't <b>be</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> now! Ha, hoo, hee!" [...] And the well dismally echoed: [...] "Ha, hoo, hee!" [...] which you must imagine was a laugh half merry and half sad.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Will you--' began Lawford, and stopped. 'What I {{wanted to}} say was,' he jerked on, 'it is sheer horrible {{hypocrisy}} to <b>be</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> like this--though you will never have the faintest {{idea of what it}} has meant and done for me. I mean... And yet, and yet, I do feel when just for the least moment I forget what I am, and that isn't very often, when I forget what I have become and what I must go back to--I feel that I haven't any business to be talking with you at all. [...] "Quits!" [...] And here I am, an outcast from decent society. Ah, you don't know--' ...|$|E

The sun was shining, the little birds was singing, and there wasn't a thing, east, west, north, or south, that looked like work. If I had been asked my address at that moment, on oath, I wouldn't have hesitated a second. I should have answered, [...] "No. 1, Easy Street." [...] You see, Jerry Moore was one of these slow, simple fellers, and you could tell in a moment what a lot he thought of Gentleman. Gentleman, you see, had a way with him. Not haughty, he wasn't. More affable, I should call it. He sort of made you feel that all men are born equal, but that it was awful good of him to <b>be</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> and that he wouldn't do it for everybody. It went down proper with Jerry Moore. Jerry would sit and listen to him giving his views on things by the hour.

5000|$|Julian Assange states: [...] "There is no killer answer yet. Jacob Appelbaum (@ioerror) has {{a clever}} response, asking {{people who say}} this to then hand him their phone {{unlocked}} and pull down their pants. My version of that is to say, 'well, if you're so boring then we shouldn't <b>be</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> and neither should anyone else', but philosophically, the real answer is this: Mass surveillance is a mass structural change. When society goes bad, it's {{going to take you}} with it, even if you are the blandest person on earth." ...|$|E
