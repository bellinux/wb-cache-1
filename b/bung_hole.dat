2500|$|One tale of Barada recounted {{that while}} {{working with a}} lazy {{railroad}} crew in Nebraska, Barada became upset. [...] He grabbed the drop hammer and threw it across the Missouri River, {{at which point the}} earth where the hammer fell buckled. [...] The hammer fall created Nebraska's Missouri River breaks. [...] Barada was still angry and slammed his fist down on a pile. [...] It was driven so far into the soil that it pierced a water table. [...] Legend says that all of Nebraska would have flooded from this <b>bung</b> <b>hole</b> if Antoine Barada hadn't plugged it by sitting over it. Antonine was also purportedly involved in the Underground Railroad. [...] Known as the [...] "Lifeguard of the Missouri", Barada supposedly saved many slaves from drowning by personally carrying them across the Missouri River from the state of Missouri into Nebraska.|$|E
50|$|The word comes {{ultimately}} {{from the}} Latin oculus, “eye”, {{which was used}} in a figurative sense by the Romans for the <b>bung</b> <b>hole</b> of a barrel. This was taken into French in the medieval period as oeil, from which a verb ouiller was created, to fill a barrel up to the <b>bung</b> <b>hole.</b> In turn, a noun ouillage was created, which was the immediate source of the word's modern form, first recorded in Norman English about 1300, at first {{in the sense of}} the amount of liquid needed to fill a barrel up to the <b>bung</b> <b>hole.</b>|$|E

5000|$|The {{two common}} sub-types of drums are the open {{top and the}} welded top (with 2 in NPS <b>bung</b> <b>holes).</b> The latter are almost universally called [...] "barrels" [...] in {{preference}} to drums in the United States. They cannot efficaciously either dispense or be filled with powdered goods, though they might store them very well, so are not used for such goods, being reserved for liquids transport and storage. Plastic drums are manufactured using injection blow moulding technology and have either a separate lid (similar to those on fiber drums) or a welded type top with the <b>bung</b> <b>holes</b> molded in. Metal drums are manufactured with cold-rolled steel sheets, welded themselves into long pipe-like sections then forged on a stamping press into drum bodies. A rolled seam is then made for the drum bottom, or bottom and top both.|$|R
60|$|I opine, {{that it is}} plainly {{traceable}} to {{the first}} arrival of the Greenland whaling ships in London, {{more than two centuries}} ago. Because those whalemen did not then, and do not now, try out their oil at sea as the Southern ships have always done; but cutting up the fresh blubber in small bits, thrust it through the <b>bung</b> <b>holes</b> of large casks, and carry it home in that manner; the shortness of the season in those Icy Seas, and the sudden and violent storms to which they are exposed, forbidding any other course. The consequence is, that upon breaking into the hold, and unloading one of these whale cemeteries, in the Greenland dock, a savor is given forth somewhat similar to that arising from excavating an old city graveyard, for the foundations of a Lying-in Hospital.|$|R
50|$|The open-top sub-type {{is sealed}} by a {{mechanical}} ring clamp (concave inwards) that exerts sufficient pressure to hold many non-volatile liquids {{and make an}} airtight seal against a gasket, as it exerts force inward and downward when tightened by a normal three-quarter inch wrench or ratchet wrench. Tops exist with <b>bung</b> <b>holes</b> as above, and these hybrid drums with lid {{can be used to}} ship many non-volatile liquids as well as industrial powders. Many drums are used to ship and store powdered products as well as liquids, such as plastic beads for injection moulding, extrusion, and purified industrial grade powders like cleansers (e.g., fertilizers, and powdered aluminum). If used to transport dangerous goods across international boundaries, they may need to have UN certification. In general, drum usage is limited to wholesale distribution of bulk products, which are then further processed or sub-divided in a factory.|$|R

50|$|James Pond has {{to solve}} puzzles {{to defeat the}} enemy and the {{gameplay}} revolves around finding objects to perform specific tasks, such as keys to rescue captured lobsters, or sponges to <b>bung</b> up the <b>holes</b> in leaking oil tankers. James must also fire bubbles at his enemies to trap them, before popping them to finish them off.|$|R
50|$|Bungholes {{can be made}} on {{the bottom}} of small boats. The hole would have a small piece of cork (<b>Bung)</b> in the <b>hole</b> while in use by the owner; when it was not in use the owner would remove the bung so if {{unwanted}} visitors decided to take the boat they would sink. Used mostly in the Renaissance and Middle Ages.|$|R
60|$|So {{far as the}} wasps' nest went, {{they found}} their task {{exceptionally}} easy--astonishingly easy. Except {{that it was a}} longer labour, it was no graver affair than any common wasps' nest might have been. Danger there was, no doubt, danger to life, but it never so much as thrust its head out of that portentous hillside. They stuffed in the sulphur and nitre, they <b>bunged</b> the <b>holes</b> soundly, and fired their trains. Then with a common impulse all the party but Cossar turned and ran athwart the long shadows of the pines, and, finding Cossar had stayed behind, came to a halt together in a knot, a hundred yards away, convenient to a ditch that offered cover. Just {{for a minute or two}} the moonlit night, all black and white, was heavy with a suffocated buzz, that rose and mingled to a roar, a deep abundant note, and culminated and died, and then almost incredibly the night was still.|$|R
5000|$|When the old {{keystone}} is very loose, {{get ready}} to swap it for the new one. It may be easier to have one person remove the old keystone and another insert the new one. Hold the new keystone just {{to one side of}} the <b>bung</b> <b>hole.</b>|$|E
50|$|Dressing was the {{preparation}} and shaping of the staves from the butt. According {{to the size}} of the cask, the staves are cut and dressed, the outer face with a backing knife and the inner with a hollowing knife. The stave containing the <b>bung</b> <b>hole</b> was made a little wider than the others. Work on the staves was done on a showing-horse; this ‘animal’ was to be found in the equipment of a number of woodcrafts.|$|E
5000|$|Wine barrels {{typically}} {{come in two}} hoop configurations. An American barrel features 6 hoops, {{from top}} to center: head- or chime hoop, quarter hoop and bilge hoop (times two), while a French barrel features 8, including a so-called French hoop, located between the quarter- and bilge hoops (see [...] "wine barrel parts" [...] illustration).The opening {{at the center of}} a barrel is called <b>bung</b> <b>hole</b> and the stopper used to seal it bung. The latter is generally made of white silicone.|$|E
50|$|Sherry is {{traditionally}} drunk from a copita (also {{referred to as}} a catavino, a special tulip-shaped sherry glass. Sampling wine directly from a sherry butt may be performed with characteristic flourish by a venenciador, named after the special cup (the venencia) traditionally made of silver and fastened to a long whale whisker handle. The cup, narrow enough to pass though the <b>bung</b> <b>hole,</b> withdraws a measure of sherry which is then ceremoniously poured from head height into a copita held in the other hand.|$|E

(The ancient building {{known as the}} [...] "Three Tuns Inn" [...] {{on the west side}} of Barnstaple High Street is in 2015 now the Pizza Express restaurant). Above is a plumed helm placed on a fasces, part of an antique trophy of arms. He was the younger brother of Henry Incledon (1671-1736) of Buckland House, Braunton, whose arms are shown on the front (south) parapet, a son-in-law of the merchant John Davie (d.1710), whose arms are also shown on the front parapet. Robert's first wife was Mary Lethbridge (d.1709), daughter of Christopher Lethbridge (d.1713) of Westaway House, Pilton, (whose [...] "big and sumptuous" [...] mural monument survives in Pilton Church,) whose arms are also shown on the front (south) parapet.|$|E

50|$|The {{exact method}} {{and timing of}} topping up a wine barrel is {{determined}} by the individual wineries and can depend on the type of wine or grape variety that is being produced. A barrel can be topped off anywhere from once a week to every month and a half. The position of the barrel can affect the speed and degree of evaporation and the need for topping up. If the barrel is sitting with its <b>bung</b> <b>hole</b> on top, aeration and evaporation occurs more quickly. If the barrel is turned to the side in the bung over position, the bung is kept moist with the wine and aeration occurs at a slower pace. The wine that is replaced during the topping up is usually the same wine taken from another smaller container (such as a carboy) with the barrel filled to the very top to where the reinsertion of the bung causes some spillage.|$|E
