40|$|Abstract: In the paper, the {{stability}} of a plunge pool bottom under the impact of an impinging jet is theoretically analyzed, {{with reference to the}} mean characteristics of the flow field: pressure and velocity. In cases when the mean components are relevant in respect to the fluctuating ones, this analysis is exhausting. In other cases, a separate evaluation of the fluctuation effects in lining design is treated by means of experimental evidence. The mean dynamic pressure at the bottom depends strongly on the impingement angle, which assumes a relevant role in the design of floor protections. In plunge pools, which are confined upstream by the presence of the drop structure, the impingement angle is theoretically determined by mass balance and momentum conservation, resulting independent of the jet entrance angle at the plunge pool water surface. The theoretical results are compared with literature, experimental evidence, and numerical simulations. This highlights the capability of the proposed theoretical framework to correctly interpret the physical phenomena and to produce suitable engineering approaches in plunge pool <b>bottom</b> <b>lining</b> design...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Social {{reporting}} {{is crucial for}} organisations claiming to practice corporate social responsibility. Reporting is essential for engaging with stakeholders, and establishing a dialogue that leads to mutual learning and action. We contend tha t two approaches to social reporting are “competing ” for acceptance: stand alone social reports based on the Social and Ethical Accounting, Auditing and Reporting standards (ISEA, 2001) and Triple Bottom Line Reporting (Elkington, 1997). The triple bottom line refers to the organization’s economic, environmental and social impacts, and therefore social reporting and triple <b>bottom</b> <b>lining</b> are clearly not mutually exclusive. However, this paper argues that social and ethical accounting, auditing and reportin g (SEAAR) as it is being practiced {{by a number of}} companies is not simply a complement to triple bottom line reporting, but tends to be qualitatively different, being process driven, externally verified and requiring active, ongoing engagement with stakeholder groups. This paper differentiates between social reporting and triple bottom line reporting. Using information and case studies from New Zealand, we contrast the limited use of social reporting in the corporate sector with its more extensive use in the not-for-profit sector. Finally, we outline how social reporting and TBLR are likely to move forward in parallel in New Zealand. The tentative conclusion {{of this study is that}} social auditing will continue to be favoured by ‘valuesdriven’ organisations (both private and not-for-profit) and TBLR will continue to be favoured by mainstream companies...|$|E
40|$|The {{theme for}} the papers in the issue is “Hydrology and the Environment”. There {{is a mix of}} review papers and re-search papers. Climate change and water are very {{important}} subjects in these times. Hydrology is the science of water, and the environment has water as one of the three principal earthly components, the other two being the air and the earth. Hence, hydrology and the environment would be a good fo-cus at this time. One paper addresses the issues caused by sea level rise, as seen and predicted by climate change experts [1 - 3]. Miti-gation and adaptation are options to consider, but the author advises against inaction.

40|$|Uncontrolled {{leachate}} {{emissions are}} one of the key factors in the environmental impact of municipal solid waste (MSW) landfills. The concentration of ammonium, given the anaerobic conditions in traditional landfills, can remain significantly high for a very long period of time, as degradation does not take place and volatilisation is not significant (the pH is not high enough to considerably shift the equilibrium towards un-ionised ammonia). Recent years have witnessed a continuous enhancement of landfill technology in order to minimize uncontrolled emissions into the environment; <b>bottom</b> <b>lining</b> systems have been improved and more attention has been devoted {{to the study of the}} attenuation of the different chemicals in leachate in case of migration through the mineral barrier. Different natural materials have been considered for use as components of landfill liners in the last years and tested in order to evaluate the performance of the different alternatives. Among those materials, bentonite is often used, coupled with other materials in two different ways: in addition to in situ soil or in geocomposite clay liner (GCL). A lab-scale test was carried out in order to further investigate the influence of bentonite on the attenuation of ammonium in leachate passing through a landfill liner. Two different tests were conducted: a standardized batch test with pulverized bentonite and a batch test with compacted bentonite. The latter was proposed in order to better simulate the real conditions in a landfill liner. The two tests produced values for the partition coefficient K-d higher than the average measured for other natural materials usually utilized as components of landfill liners. Moreover, the two tests showed similar results, thus providing a further validation of the suitability of the standard batch test with pulverized bentonite. A thorough knowledge of attenuation processes of ammonium in landfill liners is the basis for the application of risk analysis models for the evaluation of the failure of bottom liners or their components...|$|E

40|$|Auckland Council (AC) is {{responsible}} for the development and operation of a stormwater network across the region to avert risks to citizens and the environment. Within this stormwater network, aquatic vegetation (including plants, unicellular and filamentous algae) can have both a positive and negative role in stormwater management and water quality treatment. The situations where management is needed to control aquatic vegetation are not always clear, and an inability to identify effective, feasible and economical control options may constrain management initiatives. AC (Infrastructure and Technical Services, Stormwater) commissioned this technical report to provide information for decision- making on aquatic vegetation management with in stormwater systems that are likely to experience vegetation-related issues. Information was collated from a comprehensive literature review, augmented by knowledge held by the authors. This review identified a wide range of management practices that could be potentially employed. It also demonstrated complexities and uncertainties relating to these options that makes the identification of a best management practice difficult. Hence, the focus of this report was to enable users to screen for potential options, and use reference material provided on each option to confirm the best practice to employ for each situation. The report identifies factors to define whether there is an aquatic vegetation problem (Section 3. 0), and emphasises the need for agreed management goals for control (e. g. reduction, mitigation, containment, eradication). Resources to screen which management option(s) to employ are provided (Section 4. 0), relating to the target aquatic vegetation, likely applicability of options to the system being managed, indicative cost, and ease of implementation. Initial screening allows users to shortlist potential control options for further reference (Section 5. 0). Thirty-five control options are described (Section 5. 0) in sufficient detail to consider applicability to individual sites and species. These options are grouped under categories of biological, chemical or physical control. Biological control options involve the use of organisms to predate, infect or control vegetation growth (e. g. classical biological control) or manipulate conditions to control algal growth (e. g. pest fish removal, microbial products). Chemical control options involve the use of pesticides and chemicals (e. g. glyphosate, diquat), or the use of flocculants and nutrient inactivation products that are used to reduce nutrient loading, thereby decreasing algal growth. Physical control options involve removing vegetation or algal biomass (e. g. mechanical or manual harvesting), or setting up barriers to their growth (e. g. shading, <b>bottom</b> <b>lining,</b> sediment capping). Preventative management options are usually the most cost effective, and these are also briefly described (Section 6. 0). For example, the use of hygiene or quarantine protocols can reduce weed introductions or spread. Catchment- based practices to reduce sediment and nutrient sources to stormwater are likely to assist in the avoidance of algal and possibly aquatic plant problems. Nutrient removal may be a co-benefit where harvesting of submerged weed biomass is undertaken in stormwater systems. It should also be considered that removal of substantial amounts of submerged vegetation may result in a sudden and difficult-to-reverse s witch to a turbid, phytoplankton dominated state. Another possible solution is the conversion of systems that experience aquatic vegetation issues, to systems that are less likely to experience issues. The focus of this report is on systems that receive significant stormwater inputs, i. e. constructed bodies, including ponds, amenity lakes, wetlands, and highly-modified receiving bodies. However, some information will have application to other natural water bodies...|$|E
40|$|Pollution control {{represents}} one of the main problems of public interest in all industrialised countries. Since the 1970 s, when the engineering of waste containment began, the overall objective of Environmental Geotechnics was to limit contaminant discharge to groundwater and subsoil. Since the 1990 s design engineers and environmental agencies have shown a growing interest in the use of geosynthetic clay liners (GCLs) as an alternative to compacted clays in cover systems or in <b>bottom</b> <b>lining</b> of waste containment facilities because they have very low hydraulic conductivity to water and relatively low cost. GCLs contain a thin layer of sodium bentonite with a dry thickness between 5 and 10 mm, sandwiched between two geotextiles or glued to a geomembrane, GM. The excellent hydraulic performances of GCLs have to be attributed to bentonite characteristics and, since these last are greatly influenced by the chemical composition of the environment surrounding the barrier and by the state parameters, the performances of GCLs can be altered, and then worsened, by a simple variation of the chemical or physical boundary conditions. Aimed at solving this last issue, clay liners and GCLs have undergone great change during the last two decades, with new material being introduced (i. e. polymers) and new design methods being adopted (i. e. membrane behaviour investigation, contaminant diffusion estimation). The research project developed during the Ph. D. has been focused on bentonite barriers. The term "bentonite barriers" includes bentonite or bentonite-based barriers which find application both in urban waste landfill, hazardous or radioactive wastes final disposal and in hydrocarbon containment. The developed theoretical and experimental study has had the aim of evaluating the possible improvement of containment performance of the bentonite barriers, towards standard and non standard liquids, acting on their state parameters, chemical composition, and boundary conditions at installation. The contents of the thesis are reported below: Chapter 1 - Bentonite barriers. This chapter is an introduction to the topic of the research activity: the improvement of contaminant containment performances of the bentonite barrier. Chapter 1 gives a phenomenological and physical description of the mineralogical, chemical and physical properties of sodium and calcium bentonite. Moreover, the main features and issues concerning Geosynthetic Clay Liners, and bentonite barriers in general, are introduced. Chapter 2 - Containment performances of natural and polymer-modified bentonite barriers subjected to physical pre-treatments. The role of physical pre-treatments, such as pre-hydration, pre-consolidation and salt removal, applied to sodium and polymer modified bentonites, has been analyzed in the Paper reported in chapter 2, titled: "THE ROLE OF PHYSICAL PRETREATMENTS ON THE HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY OF NATURAL AND POLYMER MODIFIED SODIUM BENTONITES". Moreover, the effect of {{the presence or absence of}} needling across the bentonite layer has been studied. All these variables have been shown to influence the hydraulic performances of bentonite through hydraulic conductivity change in both short and long term conditions. Physical pre-treatments and polymer addiction, in fact, influence the swelling behaviour of bentonite and its response to the cation exchange phenomenon. Chapter 3 - Osmotic and swelling properties of bentonite barriers. In the Paper included in this chapter, titled "COUPLED CHEMICAL-HYDRAULIC-MECHANICAL BEHAVIOUR OF BENTONITES", a theoretical approach has been proposed in order to derive constitutive equations which describe the coupled chemical-hydraulic-mechanical behaviour of bentonite barriers, with the aim to assess their long term performance. The phenomenological parameters that govern the transport of electrolyte solutions through bentonites, i. e. the hydraulic conductivity, the reflection coefficient, which is also called the chemico-osmotic efficiency coefficient, and the osmotic effective diffusion coefficient, have been measured through laboratory tests on a natural sodium bentonite The obtained results have been interpreted by assuming that the microscopic deviations of the pore solution state variables from their average values are negligible. In this way, it is possible to interpret the macroscopic behaviour on the basis of the physical and chemical properties of the bentonite mineralogical components. At the end of the chapter two further chemico-osmotic tests are described aimed at analysing (1) the osmotic behaviour of calcium bentonite and (2) the effects induced on osmotic behaviour by stress-strain properties. Moreover, the osmotic results are confronted with data from literature. Finally, the design of a new osmotic apparatus to measure both the swelling pressure and the reflection coefficient is proposed. Chapter 4 - Hydrocarbon containment performances of natural and polymer-modified bentonite barriers. Background information on hydrocarbon behaviour in soils is reported in the first part of this chapter. In particular, the effects of capillary forces on the distribution of immiscible fluids in porous media and the theoretical aspects, regarding the formation of tactoids induced by the low dielectric constant that characterizes the most of hydrocarbon species, are studied. An experimental study is presented in the Paper titled "HYDRAULIC PERFORMANCE OF GCLS WITH DIESEL OIL AND POLYMER TREATMENT PROPOSAL", which is aimed at evaluating the hydraulic performance of a needle-punched GCL using both standard liquids (i. e. de-ionized water) and diesel oil in order to estimate the change in hydraulic conductivity and swelling ability upon contact or permeation with hydrocarbons. Moreover, the hydraulic conductivity to diesel oil of GCL samples saturated at different initial gravimetric water contents was investigated with the aim to analyse the effect of initial water saturation on hydrocarbon containment performances. Finally, the swelling and hydraulic performances to diesel oil of an innovative material, obtained by mixing sodium bentonite with a polymer, were measured. Chapter 5 - Containment performances of a bentonite-based barrier constituted of municipal solid waste bottom ashes. The research described in the Paper included in this chapter, titled "REUSE OF MSWI BOTTOM ASH MIXED WITH NATURAL SODIUM BENTONITE AS LANDFILL COVER MATERIAL" has the aim of evaluating the reuse of incinerator slag, mixed with sodium bentonite, for landfill capping system components. A chemical, hydraulic and mechanical characterization was performed on pure bottom ash (BA) samples from an incinerator in the North of Italy and on the BA-bentonite mixture. This study qualifies the BA-bentonite mixture as a suitable material for landfill cover in Italy. Moreover, owing to the low release of toxic compounds from BA, the proposed cover system does not affect the leachate quality in the landfill. Chapter 6 - Finite difference modelling of diffusive flux of Calcium through a bentonite barrier in in-situ conditions. The evidence of the strong degradation induced in the hydraulic performances of sodium bentonite barriers by the cation exchange phenomenon has been highlighted in the previous chapters. This experimental result underlines the need to study the transitional development of the cation exchange phenomenon with the aim to compare that to the period in which landfill barrier performances have to be guaranteed in in-situ conditions. The mathematical study developed in this chapter is focused on the evaluation of the role of the diffusive component of Calcium flux in the cation exchange phenomenon which can develop in a sodium bentonite barrier, placed in an environment inexorably rich in chemical compounds containing soluble Calcium (i. e. the natural soil, the aquifer, the drainage layer saturated with waste leachate or raining water...|$|E
40|$|Geotechnical {{engineers}} and hydrologists have dedicated {{most of their}} efforts devoted to problems concerning environmental protection and human health since the 1970 's, by studying the interaction between soils and polluting substances. Such remarkable impetus of studies emerged mainly from the need to manage the disposal of radioactive materials produced by nuclear stations with solutions which {{would be able to}} guarantee an adequate level of safety in the long term (Daniel, 1993). Scientific community was soon called on to study industrial waste landfills and pollution of the sub-soil deriving from materials produced by chemical and petro-chemical industries: in particular, the main problem to solve was that of designing adequate pollutant barrier systems in order to limit contaminant discharge to groundwater and related migration in the subsoil (Benson, 2000). Initially, such barriers were made up by mineral type materials (drainage layers in sand and gravel, compacted clay liners, soil-bentonite and cement-bentonite cutoff-walls), since their properties for long-term use were considered sufficiently durable. Clay liners and clay caps were used respectively in order to provide isolation of waste leachate from the subsoil (in the case of liners), or to guarantee long-term control of percolation into the waste and control leachate generation (in the case of covers). The design of pollutant barrier systems has been innovatively modified since the mid- 1980 's with the introduction of the so-called Geosynthetic Clay Liners (GCLs), which are defined as factory-manufactured hydraulic or gas barriers consisting of a layer of bentonite or other very low permeability material supported by geotextiles and/or geomembranes, mechanically held together by needling, stitching or chemical adhesives (Koerner and Koerner, 2010). The hydraulic resistance of conventional GCLs (i. e. which are not comprised of a geomembrane component) is attributed to the bentonite component of the GCL, which swells in the presence of water to form a tight sealing layer (Shackelford, 2007). GCLs have been utilized greatly as the lower portion of geomembrane/GCL composites in both landfill liners and final covers (e. g. Bouazza, 2002; Koerner, 2005); they have also been used in other containment applications and by themselves as single barrier systems when modified with a geofilm or polymer coating within the cover geotextiles. In most applications they have served as replacement materials for the more traditional compacted clay liners (CCLs) in cover systems or in <b>bottom</b> <b>lining</b> of waste containment facilities, since they present very low hydraulic conductivity to water and relatively low cost (Bouazza, 2002). GCLs have undergone great change since the 1990 's. Engineers had to explore new theoretical problems, such as the study of solute diffusion phenomena in soils and chemical osmosis in bentonites, since hydraulic performances of GCLs are greatly affected by the chemical composition of the environment surrounding the barrier (e. g. they can be worsen by a simple variation of the chemical and physical boundary conditions), and depend on the swelling and osmotic behaviour which bentonite, characterized by a high content in montmorillonite, may exhibit. Moreover, new specific design methodologies have been developed, whose distinctive features derive from the specific nature of the objective to reach, of the materials employed, of the boundary conditions and of the reference regulations; an important example of such new methodologies is represented by risk analysis. The research project developed during the PhD has been focused on bentonite barriers which are designed both in urban waste landfill, hazardous or radioactive wastes final disposal. The theoretical and experimental study has had the aim of studying the mechanical and chemico-osmotic behaviour of bentonite in contact with standard (i. e. de-ionized water, DW) and non standard liquids (i. e. sodium chloride solutions), acting on its state parameters, chemical composition, and boundary conditions at installation. The whole laboratory activity, comprising oedometer and chemico-osmotic tests, was carried out at "Politecnico di Torino", in the Disaster Planning Laboratory (DIPLAB) of the Department of Structural, Geotechnical and Building Engineering (DISEG). The contents of the 3 -year PhD research are reported in this thesis and are resumed in the short summary reported below: Chapter 1 - Bentonite barriers This chapter is aimed at introducing the main topics concerning the mineralogical, chemical and physical description of sodium bentonite; swelling and osmotic phenomena are also presented. Particular attention is devoted to the engineering properties which can be evaluated in order to characterize bentonite, in particular of Geosynthetic Clay Liners, for geoenvironmental applications: in this regard the most important characteristics of sodium bentonite which was employed for the PhD research activity are resumed. A propaedeutic study on mechanical behaviour of bentonites, referring in particular to the swelling phenomenon, is also described. Finally the main aspects and issues concerning practical application and proper use of Geosynthetic Clay Liners and Clay membrane barriers in general are introduced. Chapter 2 - Theoretical models for mechanical and osmotic behaviour of sodium bentonites The electric interaction between montmorillonite particles, which represent the main mineralogical component of bentonite, and the ions in pore solution determines macroscopic phenomena which cannot be modelled {{on the basis of the}} classical theories used to describe the movement of water and solutes through porous media. This chapter is focused on the theoretical approaches which can be adopted in order to model transport properties of bentonites and the related aspects of their mechanical behaviour. The phenomenological and physical theoretical approaches are complementary and represent a very useful tool for experimental data interpretation, in order to reduce the number of tests to be performed and simulate GCLs behaviour in applications, even in the long-term, under boundary conditions different from those adopted in laboratory. Chapter 3 - Mechanical and swelling behaviour of bentonites In the Paper included in this chapter, titled "MECHANICAL AND SWELLING BEHAVIOUR OF SODIUM BENTONITES IN EQUILIBRIUM WITH LOW MOLARITY NaCl SOLUTIONS UNDER OEDOMETRIC CONDITIONS", a theoretical and experimental study on mechanical and swelling behaviour of tested sodium bentonite is presented. Several oedometer tests (i. e. with a conventional apparatus and a new testing device) were performed on sodium bentonite specimens in equilibrium with NaCl 0. 01 M concentrated solutions in order to measure a phenomenological parameter, i. e. the swelling pressure, at different void ratios. The obtained experimental results have been interpreted on the basis of the theoretical model, by assuming that the microscopic deviations of the pore solution state variables from their average values are negligible: in such a way, it was possible to interpret the macroscopic behaviour on the basis of the physical and chemical properties of the bentonite mineralogical components, and, thus, characterize the microstructure of the material. In the last part of the chapter other oedometer tests are presented, with the aim of analysing the effect of different salt concentrations of the equilibrium solution on the mechanical and swelling behaviour of sodium bentonite. Chapter 4 - Chemico-osmotic behaviour of bentonites Membrane behaviour represents a potential benefit in engineered clay-based barriers for geoenvironmental applications, especially if such barriers consist of sodium bentonite. A theoretical and experimental study on membrane behaviour of tested sodium bentonite is presented in the Paper included in this chapter, titled "INFLUENCE OF SPECIMEN POROSITY AND SODIUM CHLORIDE PORE SOLUTION CONCENTRATION ON CHEMICO-OSMOTIC BEHAVIOUR OF SODIUM BENTONITES". The effects of porosity on two natural sodium bentonite specimens submitted to multiple-stage chemico-osmotic tests were investigated, by evaluating two phenomenological parameters that affect transport properties of bentonite, i. e. the chemico-osmotic reflection coefficient and the osmotic effective diffusion coefficient. The experimental results were compared to literature data and interpreted on the basis of the proposed theoretical approach, under the hypothesis that the microscopic deviations of the state variables from their average values are negligible. Even in this case, it was possible to interpret the macroscopic behaviour on the basis of the physical and chemical properties of the bentonite mineralogical components. In the last paragraph of the chapter, two further chemico-osmotic tests, by means of a new testing apparatus, are presented: experimental data are interpreted through the proposed theoretical framework and compared with previous results...|$|E
