5|$|The 11 snake species {{occurring}} in Puerto Rico are generally considered non-venomous, although research {{has concluded that}} at least one species, the Puerto Rican racer (Alsophis portoricensis), secretes venom. These species belong to 3 families and 4 genera: Typhlopidae (Typhlops genus), <b>Boidae</b> (Epicrates) and Colubridae (Alsophis and Arrhyton). The largest snake in Puerto Rico is the endemic Puerto Rican boa (Epicrates inornatus) with a maximum length of 12ft (3.7m). The diet of snakes in Puerto Rico consists of reptiles (Ameiva, Anolis, geckos), coquís and other frogs, and, to a lesser extent, mice, birds and bats (exclusively by the Puerto Rican Boa).|$|E
5|$|The La Colonia Formation {{is exposed}} over the {{southern}} {{slope of the}} North Patagonian Massif. Most vertebrate fossils, including Carnotaurus, come from the formation's middle section (called the middle facies association). This part likely represents the deposits of an environment of estuaries, tidal flats or coastal plains. The climate would have been seasonal with both dry and humid periods. The most common vertebrates collected include ceratodontid lungfish, turtles, crocodiles, plesiosaurs, dinosaurs, lizards, snakes and mammals. Some of the snakes {{that have been found}} belong to the families <b>Boidae</b> and Madtsoidae, such as Alamitophis argentinus. Turtles are represented by at least five taxa, four from Chelidae (Pleurodira) and one from Meiolaniidae (Cryptodira). Among the marine reptiles is the plesiosaur Sulcusuchus erraini of the family Polycotylidae. Mammals are represented with Reigitherium bunodontum, which was considered the first record of a South American docodont, and Argentodites coloniensis, possibly of Multituberculata. In 2011, the discovery of a new enantiornithine bird from the La Colonia Formation was announced.|$|E

Teorētiskajā un empīriskajā daļā autore analizē TV vadītāja kā intervētāja lomu dažādu stilu un žanru intervijās. Kā pētāmais objekts tika izvēlēts Jāņa Dombura raidījums,,Kas notiek Latvijā?” Empīriskās pētniecības metode: nesistemātiskā novērošanas metode ar gadījuma TV intervijām. Pētnieciskais darbs ar video materiāliem balstoties uz Maršala Maklūena, Frenka Vebstera, Džona Fiskes un citu pētnieku teorijām. Darba pirmajā daļā autore analizē dažāda tipa intervijas, lai pierādītu, ka tās tiek izmantotas TV raidījuma struktūras realizācijā pilnībā, vai fragmentāri, balstoties uz Andrū <b>Boida</b> interviju tipoloģijas sistēmu, Krisa Frosta interviju realizācijas tehniku. Darba otrajā daļā autore analizē TV vadītāja vizualizācijas aspektus TV kadra kontekstā, lai izprastu TV sejas estētisko un loģisko kodu parādību, gan balstoties uz Maršala Makluena, Vasilija Sesemanna, Frenka Vebstera un Džona Fiskes teorijām. The author {{used the}} non-systematic case study with video {{materials}} to prove two hypotheses 1) The observing of TV interview parameters allow {{to use them}} in a fragmentary way or wholly in structure of the programme. 2) The image of a TV host meets the logical and aesthetical codes, keeping {{the parameters of the}} demanded image – with dominates of logical codes. In the theoretical and empirical part the author is analyzing the role of a TV interviewer in different types, genres and styles of interview. Actualizing the question of a great importance, how to combine different knowledge to improve the programme. The author has chosen the popular journalist in Latvia Janis Domburs who is the host of the public debate TV programme ‘Kas notiek Latvijā?” The empirical research method: non-systematic case study observing method with casual TV interviews. The research has been made analyzing video materials that were being based on theories of such researchers as Marshall McLuhan, Frank Webster, John Fiske and others. In the first theoretical part the author is analyzing different types of interviews to prove that they are being used in producing the structure of the TV programme fragmentary or wholly, basing on the theory of systematic typology by Andrew Boyd and Chris Frost in the context of interview realization techniques. In the second theoretical part the author is analyzing the aspects of a TV host visualization parameters in the context of TV screen and being on air, as well as the phenomenon of aesthetical and logical codes. Theoretical position is based on such researchers as Marshall McLuhan, Vasily Sesemann, Frank Webster adding the theoretical view of Jonh Fiske and his typology of different images...|$|R

25|$|There are {{numerous}} {{debates in the}} systematics within the group. For instance, many sources classify <b>Boidae</b> and Pythonidae as one family, while some keep the Elapidae and Hydrophiidae (sea snakes) separate for practical reasons despite their extremely close relation.|$|E
25|$|Boa constrictors {{can sense}} heat via cells in their lips, though {{they lack the}} labial pits {{surrounding}} these receptors seen in {{many members of the}} <b>Boidae</b> family. Boa constrictors also have two lungs, a smaller (nonfunctional) left and an enlarged (functional) right lung to better fit their elongated shape, unlike many colubrid snakes, which have completely lost the left lung.|$|E
25|$|The boa {{constrictor}} (Boa constrictor), {{also called the}} red-tailed boa or the common boa, is a species of large, heavy-bodied snake that is frequently kept and bred in captivity. The {{boa constrictor}} {{is a member of}} the family <b>Boidae,</b> found in tropical North, Central, and South America, as well as some islands in the Caribbean. A staple of private collections and public displays, its color pattern is highly variable yet distinctive. Ten subspecies are currently recognized, although some of these are controversial. This article focuses on the species Boa constrictor as a whole, and on the nominate subspecies B. c. constrictor.|$|E
25|$|The Honda Group is {{the richest}} {{fossiliferous}} stratigraphic unit of Colombia, {{and one of}} the most important for the Miocene worldwide. At the La Venta site, numerous fossils of various orders have been and are found still. The site marks a unique ecosystem showing a broad range of biodiversity. La Venta is also an important site as it represents the youngest uniquely South American faunal assemblage before the Great American Biotic Interchange; the result of the uplift of the Isthmus of Panama, of which the initial phase has been dated at around 12 Ma. This led to a drastic alteration of the South American former island continental fauna. The Sparassodonta formed the dominant carnivorous mammal group in South America during most of the Cenozoic. In South America, the carnivorous adaptive zone in terrestrial ecosystems was shared with other mammals, terror birds (Phorusrhacoidea), large crocodiles (Sebecidae), large snakes (Madsoiidae and <b>Boidae),</b> and even occasionally frogs. The diversity of fossil freshwater fishes and crocodilians at La Venta is the richest assemblage of South America. Fossilised trunks of Goupioxylon sp. have been identified in the Honda Group.|$|E

2500|$|Pythons are oviparous, that is, {{they lay}} eggs. This sets {{them apart from}} the family <b>Boidae</b> (boas), most of which bear live young (ovoviviparous). After they lay their eggs, females {{typically}} incubate them until they hatch. This is achieved by causing the muscles to [...] "shiver", which raises {{the temperature of the}} body to a certain degree, and thus that of the eggs. Keeping the eggs at a constant temperature is essential for healthy embryo development. During the incubation period, females will not eat and only leave to bask to raise their body temperature.|$|E
50|$|The Rubber Boa (Charina bottae) is a {{snake in}} the family <b>Boidae</b> and genus Charina.
