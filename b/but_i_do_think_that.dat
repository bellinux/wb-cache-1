She later explained [...] "I have never commended apartheid, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> the existence of a ‘Chinatown’ or ‘Little Tokyo’ is a good thing." ...|$|E
2500|$|In late 2010, Hopkins {{suggested}} that African American fighters who possessed {{what he described}} as a [...] "slick" [...] inner-city style of fighting would be successful against Filipino boxer Manny Pacquiao. [...] "Maybe I'm biased because I'm black, but I think that this is what is said at people's homes and around the dinner table among black boxing fans and fighters. Most of them won't say it [...] because they're not being real and they don't have the balls to say it. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> a fighter like the Ray Leonards or anyone like that would beat a guy [...] if they come with their game. Listen, this ain't a racial thing, but then again, maybe it is. But the style that is embedded in most of us black fighters, that style could be a problem to any other style of fighting." ...|$|E
2500|$|Reflecting on {{his first}} six novels and his rapid writing {{turnover}} later in his career, DeLillo remarked, [...] "I wasn't learning {{to slow down and}} examine what I was doing more closely. I don't have regrets about that work, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> if I had been a bit less hasty in starting each new book, I might have produced somewhat better work in the 1970s. My first novel took so long and was such an effort that once I was free of it I almost became carefree in a sense and moved right through the decade, stopping, in a way, only at Ratner's Star (1976), which was an enormous challenge for me, and probably a bigger challenge for the reader. But I slowed down in the 1980s and '90s." [...] DeLillo has also acknowledged some of the weaknesses of his 1970s works, reflecting in 2007: [...] "I knew I wasn’t doing utterly serious work, let me put it that way." ...|$|E

2500|$|Chomsky {{was always}} {{critical}} of the Soviet Union and he does now accept that Mao's regime in China was responsible for 'a huge death toll, {{in the tens of}} millions'. However, back in 1960s, Chomsky was considerably less {{critical of the}} communist movements in Asia, noting what he considered to be grassroots elements within both Chinese and Vietnamese communism. In December 1967, during a forum in New York, Chomsky responded to criticisms of the Chinese revolution as follows, [...] "I don't feel that they deserve a blanket condemnation at all. There are many things to object to in any society. But take China, modern China; one also finds many things that are really quite admirable." [...] Chomsky continued: [...] "There are even better examples than China. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> China is an important example of a new society in which very interesting positive things happened at the local level, in which {{a good deal of the}} collectivization and communization was really based on mass participation and took place after a level of understanding had been reached in the peasantry that led to this next step." [...] He said of Vietnam: [...] "Although there appears to be a high degree of democratic participation at the village and regional levels, still major planning is highly centralized in the hands of the state authorities." ...|$|E
2500|$|Carlo Santos of Anime News Network {{felt that}} the dead baby trope and pushover protagonists were {{overused}} by Tatsumi to elicit emotion. He also criticized the choice to flip the art. Santos concludes that [...] "although the stories hammer the same point over and over again, and seemingly with the same character each time, their brutal honesty and stark settings will be a refreshing change for readers who wonder {{whatever happened to the}} diversity of the [...] artform." [...] Tim O'Neil of PopMatters noted the dark and misanthropic themes in the stories, but said that Tatsumi distinguishes himself with the longer stories, especially [...] "Who Are You", because of their [...] "narrative lyricism" [...] and [...] "subjectivity". Grant Goodman of Comics Village felt that Tatsumi's characters were portrayed through his art rather than dialogue, saying of his stories: [...] "I cannot call any of them particularly excellent, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> Tatsumi's style is refreshing and a welcome alternative to the style of current manga best-sellers." [...] Ng Suat Tong of the Hooded Utilitarian criticized the art, describing it as [...] "crude, inexperienced and laid down with the kind of haste which begets mistakes" [...] as well as the predictable misogyny in the stories and their linear structure, especially disliking [...] "Telescope". Daryl Surat of the Anime World Order podcast {{felt that the}} stories in the manga were a product of postwar Japan and difficult to identify with in a modern context, adding that the although the stories are similar, they are more concentrated due to their short length. In a starred review, Publishers Weekly compared the tone of the stories as [...] "between contemporary short fiction and EC Comics' old 'shock' comics", noting the theme of social maladjustment and complimenting Tatsumi's [...] "evocative settings" [...] and the flow of his stories. Andrew D. Arnold of Time complimented the naturalism of the stories and art, but disliked the misogyny present in the men's relationships, concluding that the collection [...] "feels as fresh and revelatory as when the works of Japanese cinema first began arriving in the U.S." [...] R.C. Baker of The Village Voice said that the manga's expressive art helped speak for its silent characters and that the subject matter distinguished itself from modern Japanese popular culture: [...] "A fearless spelunker of the id, Tatsumi delves beneath the button-down uniformity of Japan's legions of office drones." [...] Tom Rosin of Manga Life was reminded of kitchen sink films by the stories and called Tatsumi a [...] "master of the short story", saying that the manga [...] "is so unlike the Japanese comics we're accustomed to now, and such a strong example of his early work I find it slightly terrifying that this book only contains selections of his best comics from 1969!" [...] David Cozy of the Asahi Herald Tribune felt that manga was distinguished from literature with the eight-page limit—which forced Tatsumi to distill his stories and was appropriate for representing his [...] "characters' constricted lives"—as well as with the identifiable [...] "everyman" [...] in his art.|$|E
