40|$|Abstract. Background: Senescent {{changes in}} <b>brain</b> {{microvascular}} <b>circulation</b> may cause or contribute to age-related cognitive decline. Such changes are promoted partly by aging, {{but also by}} chronic hypertension, a leading treatable cause of cognitive decline. Objectives: We aimed to non-invasively detect in vivo the senescent changes in <b>brain</b> microvascular <b>circulation</b> associated with age and hypertension, and inquired whether decrements driven by aging would be exacerbated by chronic hypertension. Methods: In this longitudinal study, absolute near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) was used to quantify in vivo cerebral blood volume (CBV) and assess the hemodynamic response to a hypercapnic respiratory challenge in normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) and spontaneous-hypertensive (SHR) rats. The impact of age and hypertension were evaluated by repeating these measurements on the same animals at 4 - and 16 -months of age. Results: CBV decreased markedly with age in both strains, from 4. 5 ± 0. 2 to 2. 6 ± 0. 1 ml/ 100 g tissue, on average. Chronic hypertension, however, did not significantly exacerbate this age-related decrease in CBV (− 48. 1 ± 3. 7 % in WKYs versus − 53. 3 ± 5. 4 % in SHRs). In contrast, vasoreactivity was already impaired in the young hypertensive rats (VMR 0. 017 ± 0. 014 in young SHRs versus 0. 042 ± 0. 005 in young WKYs) and further worsened by middle-age (VMR 0. 011 ± 0. 017 middle-aged SHRs).

40|$|Collective Action to Support the Reintegration of Return Migrants {{in their}} Country of Origin (MIREM) Chinese {{migration}} to France {{is not a}} new phenomenon; however, France has seen rapid growth of migration from China in the past decade. Among the increasingly diverse migratory flow, a prominent group is Chinese students. As in many European countries, more and more Chinese students are now studying in France, at universities, grandes écoles and language schools etc… There is limited research focusing on this group of migrants. Therefore, this paper will analyse the circular migration of Chinese students between China and France by focusing on the return migration from elite French business schools. It illustrates the importance of prior experiences and pre-acquisition of academic and professional capital on their choice to migrate to France. At the same time, this paper investigates how family ties with China and institutional agents (private and public sectors) and the multiple-layers of forces (national and supranational) behind Chinese student return migration. This paper argues that the strong family relations and contacts, career strategy and prospects for returnees and confidence in the Chinese economy are significant return factors. Returnees’ academic, professional and social experiences in France are also important in their decision. In addition, it shows how these talents are integrated in the skilled labour market and how they maintain connections with France.
