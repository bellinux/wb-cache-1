25|$|Algorithms {{can also}} be {{assessed}} according to their bit complexity, i.e., how many bits of accuracy are needed to store intermediate values occurring in the computation. For example, the Gaussian elimination (or LU decomposition) method is of order O(n3), but the bit length of intermediate values can become exponentially long. The Bareiss Algorithm, on the other hand, is an exact-division method based on Sylvester's identity is also of order n3, but the bit complexity is roughly the <b>bit</b> <b>size</b> of the original entries in the matrix times n.|$|E
25|$|An {{adjustable}} wood bit, {{also known}} as an expansive wood bit, has a small center pilot bit with an adjustable, sliding cutting edge mounted above it, usually containing a single sharp point at the outside, with a set screw to lock the cutter in position. When the cutting edge is centered on the bit, the hole drilled will be small, and when the cutting edge is slid outwards, a larger hole is drilled. This allows a single drill bit to drill {{a wide variety of}} holes, and can take the place of a large, heavy set of different size bits, as well as providing uncommon bit sizes. A ruler or vernier scale is usually provided to allow precise adjustment of the <b>bit</b> <b>size.</b>|$|E
50|$|Some {{microcontrollers}} use a Harvard architecture: separate memory buses {{for instructions}} and data, allowing accesses {{to take place}} concurrently. Where a Harvard architecture is used, instruction words for the processor may be a different <b>bit</b> <b>size</b> than the length of internal memory and registers; for example: 12-bit instructions used with 8-bit data registers.|$|E
50|$|In the U.S., {{fractional}} {{inch and}} gauge drill <b>bit</b> <b>sizes</b> are in common use. In nearly all other countries, metric drill <b>bit</b> <b>sizes</b> are most common, and all others are anachronisms or {{are reserved for}} dealing with designs from the US. The British Standards on replacing gauge <b>size</b> drill <b>bits</b> with metric <b>sizes</b> in the UK {{was first published in}} 1959.|$|R
50|$|In smaller <b>sizes,</b> <b>bits</b> are {{available}} in smaller diameter increments. This reflects both the smaller drilled hole diameter tolerance possible on smaller holes and the wishes of designers to have drill <b>bit</b> <b>sizes</b> available within at most 10% of an arbitrary hole size.|$|R
5000|$|In practice, [...] {{is usually}} eight <b>bits</b> in <b>size</b> and [...] is usually 16 <b>bits</b> in <b>size</b> (as are their {{unsigned}} counterparts). This {{holds true for}} platforms as diverse as 1990s SunOS 4 Unix, Microsoft MS-DOS, modern Linux, and Microchip MCC18 for embedded 8-bit PIC microcontrollers.

50|$|If one {{counts in}} Gray code of a <b>bit</b> <b>size</b> {{equal to the}} number of disks in a {{particular}} Tower of Hanoi, begins at zero, and counts up, then the bit changed each move corresponds to the disk to move, where the least-significant bit is the smallest disk, and the most-significant bit is the largest.|$|E
50|$|E.g. with a UDH {{containing}} a single part, 05 00 03 CC 01 01the UDH {{is a total}} of (number of octets x <b>bit</b> <b>size</b> of octets) 6 x 8 = 48 bits long. Therefore, a single bit of padding has to be prepended to the message. The UDH is therefore (bits for UDH / bits per septet) = (48 + 1)/7 = 7 septets in length.|$|E
50|$|Drill bits come in {{standard}} sizes, {{described in the}} drill <b>bit</b> <b>sizes</b> article. A comprehensive drill <b>bit</b> and tap <b>size</b> chart lists metric and imperial <b>sized</b> drill <b>bits</b> alongside the required screw tap sizes. There are also certain specialized drill bits that can create holes with a non-circular cross-section.|$|R

50|$|Drill <b>bit</b> <b>sizes</b> {{are written}} {{down on paper}} and etched onto bits as {{irreducible}} fractions. So, instead of 78/64 inch, or 1 14/64 inch, the size is noted as 1 7/32 inch.|$|R
5000|$|Applying {{the nominal}} size across domains {{requires}} {{understanding of the}} size systems in both areas; for example, someone wishing to select a drill bit to clear a [...] "-inch screw" [...] may consult tables to show the proper drill <b>bit</b> <b>size.</b> Someone wishing to calculate the load capacity of a steel beam would have to consult tables to translate the nominal size of the beam into usable dimensions.|$|E
50|$|CyaSSL+ {{includes}} NTRU {{public key}} encryption. The addition of NTRU in CyaSSL+ {{was a result}} of the partnership between yaSSL and Security Innovation. NTRU works well in mobile and embedded environments due to the reduced <b>bit</b> <b>size</b> needed to provide the same security as other public key systems. In addition, it's not known to be vulnerable to quantum attacks. Several cipher suites utilizing NTRU are available with CyaSSL+ including AES-256, RC4, and HC-128.|$|E
50|$|However, {{there is}} a big {{difference}} in cost. In the UK a cam hammer typically costs £12 or more, while a rotary/pneumatic costs £35 or more. In the US a typical hammer drill costs between $70 and $120, and a rotary hammer between $150 and $500 (depending on <b>bit</b> <b>size).</b> For DIY use or to drill holes less than 13 mm (1/2 inch) in size, the hammer drill is most commonly used.|$|E

30|$|In addition, the {{oblivious}} transfer step {{at the end}} requires one message of 256 <b>bits</b> <b>size</b> (when using AES- 256 [29]). Thus, the total sending need for a single smart meter is 7.53 KiB (rounded to two decimal places).|$|R
50|$|Metric drill <b>bit</b> <b>sizes</b> {{define the}} {{diameter}} of the bit in terms of standard metric lengths. Standards organizations define sets of sizes that are conventionally manufactured and stocked. For example, British Standard BS 328 defines sizes from 0.2 mm to 25.0 mm.|$|R
50|$|The {{reason for}} this {{transition}} {{is the need to}} continue the trend of increasing storage densities, with perpendicularly oriented media offering a more stable solution for a decreasing <b>bit</b> <b>size.</b> Orienting the magnetization perpendicular to the disk surface has major implications for the disk's deposited structure and the choice of magnetic materials, as well as for some of the other components of the hard-disk drive (such as the head and the electronic channel).|$|E
5000|$|G.726 is an ITU-T ADPCM speech codec {{standard}} {{covering the}} transmission of voice at rates of 16, 24, 32, and 40 kbit/s. It was introduced to supersede both G.721, which covered ADPCM at 32 kbit/s, and G.723, which described ADPCM for 24 and 40 kbit/s. G.726 also introduced a new 16 kbit/s rate. The four bit rates associated with G.726 are often referred to by the <b>bit</b> <b>size</b> of a sample, which are 2, 3, 4, and 5-bits respectively.|$|E

30|$|For the {{homomorphic}} encryption approach, {{the smart}} meter sends its homomorphically encrypted load profile forecast {{to each of}} the |U| utilities.

50|$|Note that aging {{differs from}} LRU {{in the sense}} that aging can only keep track of the {{references}} in the latest 16/32 (depending on the <b>bit</b> <b>size</b> of the processor's integers) time intervals. Consequently, two pages may have referenced counters of 00000000, even though one page was referenced 9 intervals ago and the other 1000 intervals ago. Generally speaking, knowing the usage within the past 16 intervals is sufficient for making a good decision as to which page to swap out. Thus, aging can offer near-optimal performance for a moderate price.|$|E
5000|$|In the 1980s, a {{class of}} mass storage device called the {{magneto-optical}} drive became commercially available which used essentially the same technique for writing data to a disk.
