25|$|Many Humanists adopt {{principles}} of the Golden Rule. Some believe that universal moral standards are required for the proper functioning of society. However, they <b>believe</b> <b>such</b> necessary universality {{can and should be}} achieved by developing a richer notion of morality through reason, experience and scientific inquiry rather than through faith in a supernatural realm or source.|$|E

25|$|Longevity myths are traditions about {{long-lived}} people (generally supercentenarians), {{either as}} {{individuals or groups}} of people, and practices that have been believed to confer longevity, but for which scientific evidence {{does not support the}} ages claimed or the reasons for the claims. While literal interpretations of such myths may appear to indicate extraordinarily long lifespans, many scholars <b>believe</b> <b>such</b> figures {{may be the result of}} incorrect translation of numbering systems through various languages coupled by the cultural and or symbolic significance of certain numbers.|$|E
25|$|As a 501(c)(3) {{non-profit}} organization, Brookings describes {{itself as}} independent and non-partisan. A 2005 academic study by UCLA concluded it was centrist {{in that it}} was referenced as an authority almost equally by both conservative and liberal politicians in congressional records from 1993 to 2002. The New York Times has referred to the organization as liberal, liberal-centrist, centrist, and conservative. The Washington Post has described Brookings as centrist and liberal. The Los Angeles Times has described Brookings as liberal-leaning and centrist before opining that it did not <b>believe</b> <b>such</b> labels mattered.|$|E
25|$|Kierkegaard {{primarily}} discusses subjectivity {{with regard}} to religious matters. As already noted, he argues that doubt {{is an element of}} faith and {{that it is impossible to}} gain any objective certainty about religious doctrines such as the existence of God or the life of Christ. The most one could hope for would be the conclusion that it is probable that the Christian doctrines are true, but if a person were to <b>believe</b> <b>such</b> doctrines only to the degree they seemed likely to be true, he or she would not be genuinely religious at all. Faith consists in a subjective relation of absolute commitment to these doctrines.|$|E

500|$|Klein {{told his}} uncle, a {{well-known}} physician. The uncle nearly hit {{him and asked}} how Klein could <b>believe</b> <b>such</b> nonsense: [...] "I {{and others in the}} building in Síp Street must have lost our minds under the pressure." [...] It was the same with other relatives and friends—middle-aged men with property and family did not believe it; the younger ones did and wanted to act. In October that year, when the time came for Klein to board a train, he ran instead.|$|E
500|$|... "Both turret {{guns were}} being fired simultaneously, and evidently {{one did not}} to go off. It may seem hard to <b>believe</b> <b>such</b> a thing could happen and not be noticed, but from my own {{experience}} I understand it. The men in the turret often stopped their ears, and perhaps their eyes, {{at the moment of}} firing, and then instantly worked the run-in levers, and did not notice how much the guns had recoiled. This no doubt occurred. Both guns were at once reloaded, and the rammer's indicator, working by machinery, set fast and failed to show how far the new charge had gone." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{film was}} criticised {{for the use}} of some [...] "sexist dialogues" [...] in the first half which were playing to a certain [...] "new generation" [...] audience. Sowmya Rajendran of Sify criticised the same and stated about one of such scenes in the film, [...] "it is such banter, which we often dismiss with a laugh, that helps {{perpetuate}} rape culture." [...] When asked about this, the director replied, [...] "I firmly <b>believe</b> <b>such</b> conversations are part of our lives. I don't want to elaborate, but it also throws an insight into each character featured in the sequences. Yes, frankly, I was a bit worried how the family audience would react to those scenes. But then I read out that part of the script to a select group of women and they nodded their heads in approval." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Quran {{identifies}} {{a number}} of men as [...] "Prophets of Islam" [...] ( [...] ; pl. anbiyaa' أنبياء).

Besides Muhammad, this includes prophets such as Ibrahim (Abraham), Musa (Moses) and Isa (Jesus).|$|E
2500|$|In a bid {{to secure}} its own improvement, Schöneberg also wanted a {{connection}} to Berlin. [...] The elevated railway company did not <b>believe</b> <b>such</b> a line would be profitable, so the city built the first locally financed underground in Germany. It was opened on 1 December 1910. Just a few months earlier, work began on a fourth line to link Wilmersdorf in the south-west to the growing Berlin U-Bahn.|$|E

2500|$|Before EC {{was used}} in the general {{population}} or defined as [...] "emergency contraception," [...] it was used, beginning in the 1960s and 70s, specifically for women who had been sexually assaulted. Pregnancy rates among rape victims of child-bearing age are around 5%; in the U.S., about half of rape victims who become pregnant have abortions. Although EC is commonly used as an option for victims of sexual assault, some researchers <b>believe</b> <b>such</b> use is a public health measure that is not sufficiently widespread.|$|E

"while {{we believe}} colleges and {{universities}} may want to cooperate in providing data to publications {{for the purposes of}} rankings, we <b>believe</b> <b>such</b> data provision should be limited to data which is collected in accord with clear, shared professional standards (not the idiosyncratic standards of any single publication), and to data which is required to be reported to state or federal officials or which the institution believes (in accord with good accountability) should routinely be made available to any member of the public who seeks it." ...|$|E
2500|$|During {{the public}} {{interest}} in Modern Spiritualism, Darwin attended a séance at Erasmus's house in January 1874, but as the room grew stuffy Darwin went upstairs to lie down, missing the show, with sparks, sounds and the table rising above their heads. While Galton thought it a [...] "good séance", Darwin later wrote [...] "The Lord have mercy on us all, {{if we have to}} <b>believe</b> <b>such</b> rubbish" [...] and told Emma that it was [...] "all imposture" [...] and [...] "it would take an enormous weight of evidence" [...] to convince him otherwise. At a second séance Huxley and George found that Williams was nothing but a cheat, to Darwin's relief.|$|E

2500|$|Like Sonnet 27, {{this poem}} {{focuses on the}} indistinguishable of day and night. However, in the former poem, day and night are both {{occasions}} of work or toil, whereas Sonnet 28 employs them as occasions of torture. Although day and night are oppositional they have now become allies and, in consent, shake hands to torture the poet. Because of his absence from the beloved, the poet's [...] "personified days and nights" [...] wreak their vengeance upon him. The poet in turn attempts to placate his torturers by assuring them that they, unlike himself, are always {{in the presence of}} the beloved. Conversely, [...] "day and night refuse to <b>believe</b> <b>such</b> sophistry, and their torture goes on." ...|$|E
2500|$|Controversy {{has also}} been created by {{discrimination}} against women in public spaces. Women of the Wall have fought for the right of women to pray in their fashion at the Western Wall, including wearing prayer shawls, singing and conducting priestly blessings by daughters of the priestly caste. Women have also been {{denied the right to}} sing at some public events, such as memorial services and in the Knesset. The controversy focuses on whether [...] "forbidding women to sing is an insulting act of unacceptable discrimination, or a gesture of sensitivity and consideration to Orthodox Jewish men who believe that listening to a woman’s singing voice is, for them, a violation of religious law. [...] " [...] Some <b>believe</b> <b>such</b> policies endorse religious fundamentalism and silence women or restrict their freedom in the public arena.|$|E
2500|$|The Federal Communications Commission Open Internet Order {{is a set}} of {{regulations}} that move towards the establishment of the internet neutrality concept. Some opponents of net neutrality <b>believe</b> <b>such</b> internet regulation would inhibit innovation by preventing providers from capitalizing on their broadband investments and reinvesting that money into higher quality services for consumers. Supporters of net neutrality argue that the presence of content restrictions by network providers represents a threat to individual expression and the rights of the First Amendment. Open Internet strikes a balance between these two camps by creating a compromised set {{of regulations}} that treats all internet traffic in [...] "roughly the same way". In Verizon v. FCC, the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit vacated portions of the order that the court determined could only be applied to common carriers.|$|E
50|$|The early {{ideas of}} a {{universal}} language with complete conceptual classification by categories is still debated on various levels.
