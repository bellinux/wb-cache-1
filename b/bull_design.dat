50|$|The <b>Bull</b> <b>design</b> by {{sculptor}} Colin Grehan is {{a prominent}} piece of public art. Situated in the Market {{square of the}} town the 16 tonne limestone statue of a bull being held back by two handlers commemorates the historic bull markets {{that took place in}} the area.|$|E
5000|$|After {{moving to}} the Ferrari team, {{prior to the start}} of the [...] season Vettel said that he will no longer change helmet designs so often and after {{choosing}} a new design, having had a Red <b>Bull</b> <b>design</b> since he was 12, will try to stick to one design for the year, which was also enforced by a FIA rule banning 'significant' helmet changes in-season. His new helmet design is white with the German national flag running from front to back from the middle to the viewer's left hand side and his permanent Formula One start number 5 on the top.|$|E

50|$|A {{cousin of}} Bull’s grandfather, also named Henrik <b>Bull,</b> <b>designed</b> several of Oslo’s {{landmark}} civic buildings {{at the end}} of the 19th century. This earlier Henrik Bull was nephew of the famed violinist Ole Bull, who began the utopian community of Oleana in Pennsylvania in 1853.|$|R
50|$|In the 1950s and the 1960s, Henrik <b>Bull</b> <b>designed</b> several {{prefabricated}} or kit cabins. He {{built the}} very first A-Frame ski cabin in the United States with his friend John Flender in Stowe, Vermont in 1953. The essence of a good cabin, according to Bull, is {{that it should be}} simple and economical, but also fun, different and exciting.|$|R
5000|$|After {{switching}} to Red Bull in 2009, Vettel started regularly {{using a variety}} of new helmet designs. Some designs were small changes to his original Red <b>Bull</b> <b>design,</b> while others are completely original designs, such as the one he used at the 2010 Japanese Grand Prix: Vettel had a special white-red helmet design, with black kanji and hiragana for [...] "gives you wings". Several of his helmet designs also featured his team members. At the 2012 Italian Grand Prix, Vettel celebrated his 50th helmet design with a 'rusty' matte look and 50 tallies, indicating his 50 helmet designs in Formula One. By the end of the 2013 Formula One season, Vettel had used 76 different helmets throughout his career. [...] "I have a quirk" [...] he admits.|$|E
50|$|<b>Bull</b> <b>designed</b> {{three of}} the most {{important}} new buildings in Kristiania around 1900. The National Theatre (1891-1899) is {{regarded as one of the}} most successful buildings in Norway from the historicism period. The Historical Museum (1902) was based on deceased architect Karl August Henriksen's draft from 1890. The Government Building (1904) was based on a draft by architect Stener Lenschow from 1887/1891.|$|R
50|$|<b>Bull's</b> <b>designs</b> {{ranged from}} churches, villas and train {{stations}} to interiors and storehouses. Among his works {{are the two}} train stations in Oslo; Oslo Vestbanestasjon and Østbanen, and altogether about sixty train stations throughout the country. He designed railway stations of the Krøder Line, including the Krøderen Station (1872) and for the Kongsvinger Line at Åbogen (1865), Matrand (1865) and Magnor (1865).|$|R
50|$|Dr. Gerald <b>Bull</b> <b>designs</b> a supergun codenamed Project Babylon for Iraq. He {{believes}} that it is for launching Arab satellites into space {{and that it could}} serve no military purpose because it could fire only once before being located, targeted and destroyed. He comes to discover the true reason only shortly before being assassinated by his paymasters posing as Israeli agents.|$|R
50|$|Two {{exhibitions}} followed: Trends {{in young}} French photography (Tendances de la jeune photographie française) at the French National Library (Bibliothèque Nationale de France) and <b>Design</b> and <b>bulls</b> (<b>Design</b> et Taureaux) at the Asko-Roche Bobois space in Paris. For <b>Design</b> and <b>bulls,</b> {{which had its}} inaugural showing in October 1967, Pierre Berdoy took a series of pictures around the Ball Chair, created two years earlier by the Finnish designer Eero Aarnio.|$|R
5000|$|Phalaris {{commanded}} {{that the}} <b>bull</b> be <b>designed</b> {{in such a}} way that its smoke rose in spicy clouds of incense. The head of the <b>bull</b> was <b>designed</b> with a complex system of tubes and stops so that the prisoner's screams were converted into sounds like the bellowing of an infuriated bull. According to legend, when the bull was reopened, the victim's scorched bones [...] "shone like jewels and were made into bracelets." ...|$|R
60|$|This was {{the first}} move of the {{complicated}} operations by which Sir Redvers <b>Buller</b> <b>designed</b> to seize {{the passage of the}} Tugela at Potgieter's Ferry: Warren (seven battalions, comprising Coke's and Woodgate's Brigades and five batteries) from Estcourt to Frere. When I got back to Chieveley all was bustle in the camp. Orders to march at dawn had arrived. At last the long pause was finished; waiting was over; action had begun.|$|R
5000|$|Around one square {{kilometer}} remained {{when the}} City of Oslo bought {{the property in}} 1896 to secure space for further urban development. The municipal government decided around 1900 to make a park for recreation and sports. Frogner Stadium was opened near {{the road and the}} area near the buildings was opened to the public in 1904. Norwegian architect Henrik <b>Bull</b> <b>designed</b> the grounds and some of the buildings erected in Frogner Park for the 1914 Jubilee Exhibition.|$|R

5000|$|Sunset Magazine {{published}} articles on Bull, twice putting his projects {{on the cover}} of their magazine, giving him numerous design awards, and enlisting him as a competition judge. In 1962, he was chosen to design the Sunset Magazine Discovery House: a [...] "dream house" [...] limited to 2000 sq ft. <b>Bull</b> <b>designed</b> the home as a series of four skylit pavilions built around an enclosed courtyard. It was the first home built in the newly established town of El Dorado Hills.|$|R
40|$|A {{solution}} to the existence problem of G-designs with given subdesigns is known when G is a triangle with p= 0, 1, or 2 disjoint pendent edges: for p= 0, it is due to Doyen and Wilson, the first to pose such a problem for Steiner triple systems; for p= 1 and p= 2, the corresponding designs are kite systems and <b>bull</b> <b>designs,</b> respectively. Here, a complete {{solution to}} the problem is given in the remaining case where G is a 3 -sun, i. e. a graph on six vertices consisting of a triangle with three pendent edges which form a 1 -factor...|$|R
50|$|For {{his brother}} Ole <b>Bull,</b> he <b>designed</b> new {{farmhouse}} {{in the summer}} resort at Valestrandfossen in Osterøy (1865) and probably also his newer oriental-styled villa on Lysøen in Os, outside Bergen ca. 1872.|$|R
50|$|Starting in 1975, <b>Bull</b> <b>designed</b> a new gun {{based on}} the common US 155/39 M109 howitzer, {{extending}} it slightly to 45 calibre through modifications that {{could be applied to}} existing weapons, calling the resulting weapon the GC-45 howitzer. Bull also purchased the base bleed technology being developed in Sweden, which allowed for further improvements in range. With ERFB round the GC-45 could routinely place rounds into 10 m circles at ranges up to 30 km, extending this to 38 km with some loss in accuracy. The gun offered ranges far in excess of even the longest-ranged heavy artillery in a gun only slightly larger than common medium-weight guns.|$|R
5000|$|In 2017, another bronze sculpture, Fearless Girl, was {{installed}} {{across from the}} <b>bull.</b> <b>Designed</b> by sculptor Kristen Visbal, the work was hailed for its feminist message.The 'Fearless Girl' statue, which was commissioned by State Street Global Advisors {{as a way to}} call attention to the gender pay gap and a lack of women on corporate financial sector boards, {{was installed}} on March 7, 2017. The statue depicts a defiant little girl [...] posing as an affront to and staring down of the 'Charging Bull'. [...] The statue was initially scheduled to be removed April 2, 2017 but was later extended to remain in place through February 2018.|$|R

50|$|In 1891 the half-acre plot at Torggata 9 {{was bought}} by a company, which {{constructed}} two buildings which were designed in the New Renaissance style by architect Harald Olsen. Along Torggata was a four story building which contained business locations; inside was a courtyard with an area for shows and concerts with seats for 1600 people. In the summer of 1903, the inner building was leased to Fahlstrøms Theater. Architect <b>Bull</b> <b>designed</b> a fan-shaped baldachin in glass over the door along Torggata, together with a glass roof over the theater building. The theater was used for 8 seasons before it went into bankruptcy, and presented its last performance in August 1911. Two days later, a cinema opened in the same building. After a few years this {{was taken over by}} a Swedish company and renamed to Admiral Palads.|$|R
5|$|Several teams made {{modifications}} to their cars {{in preparation for}} the event. McLaren, Red Bull, and Williams all revised their front wings. McLaren's revision was designed to separate airflow into two separate channels, with both directing airflow around the outside of the car's front tyres. Red <b>Bull's</b> <b>design,</b> used in the Friday practice sessions, had two vertical slots to the rear of its endplate along with another to avoid creating a vortex when it operated with the planes and endplate. A previous design, debuted at the British Grand Prix, was used both in qualifying and in the race. In addition, the team used a revised diffuser to allow for better management of airflow {{to the top of the}} diffuser's side section. Williams's design debuted for the first time and was designed to make the tyre act like a diffuser which took air in to improve its efficiency.|$|R
5000|$|Mexican {{firework}} production {{include a}} number of explosive objects such as “rocas” (rocks, a kind of powerful firecracker), “vampiros” (vampires), “patas de mula” (mule hoofs) and “bombas” (large rockets) as well as frames with pyrotechnics called “castillos” (castles), “toritos” (little bulls), “canastillas” (little baskets) and Judas figures [...] [...] Castillos are generally large wooden frames covered with brilliant flares, which can cost between 20,000 to 250,000 pesos depending on size and complexity. These are most often made to honor patron saints or Mexico’s patriot heroes. Toritos are smaller frames {{in the shape of}} a <b>bull,</b> <b>designed</b> to be worn or carried by a person as they are lit, chasing passers-by in the street during festivals. A version of the torito is designed to released candy when set off, which as the effect of having children run toward it, instead of running away. Toritos run about 800 pesos in the market.|$|R
5|$|Most urban {{apartment}} buildings and villas {{continued to be}} built in the classical tradition, with plastered brick walls. The repertoire of historic styles was expanded in Homansbyen, Oslo's first residential development of detached villas, planned by Georg Andreas <b>Bull.</b> He <b>designed</b> most of the early villas built from 1858 until 1862 in a variety of styles, ranging from medieval to classicist and exotic.|$|R

40|$|Bull Nose {{livestock}} trailer, {{manufactured by}} American Trailer, Inc. {{is one of}} a line of highway transport vehicles manufactured by American Trailers, Inc. The slant side front end is a streamlining feature based on a NASA Research Program which investigated the aerodynamic characteristics of trailer/tractor combinations and suggested ways of reducing air resistance. Application of NASA's aerodynamic research technology to the <b>bull</b> nose <b>design</b> resulted in a 10 percent reduction in air drag, which translates into annual fuel savings of several hundred dollars...|$|R
5000|$|Scuderia Toro Rosso {{became an}} {{independent}} constructor in 2010, after having their chassis {{supplied by the}} Red <b>Bull</b> Technologies <b>design</b> studio for {{the first years of}} racing. This had allowed the team to purchase customer chassis, despite the concept being banned by the FIA. This loophole was closed for 2010, meaning that the STR5 2010 car will be the first car Toro Rosso have built on their own, having spent most of [...] expanding their base of operations in Faenza, Italy to accommodate production facilities.|$|R
50|$|Bennington's early {{railroad}} {{service was}} limited to the village of North Bennington, about 5 mi north of the downtown. In 1854 a branch line was run from North Bennington to serve the town center, and a wood frame depot was erected by the Bennington and Rutland. In 1897, its depot in decline, the railroad commissioned local architect William C. <b>Bull</b> to <b>design</b> a replacement. The present building was completed the following year. Its design bears significant resemblance to the station designed by H.H. Richardson for Wellesley, Massachusetts (now demolished), and is the state's only instance of a Richardsonian railroad station.|$|R

5000|$|The Taurus Judge {{is based}} on the Taurus [...]45 Colt {{revolver}} and is adequate for its designed rounds. It was not designed for higher pressures generated by cartridges such as [...]44 Magnum or [...]454 Casull; to prevent use of such rounds, the firing chambers of the Judge cylinder are choked to prevent chambering rounds larger in diameter than [...]410 shotshells and longer than [...]45 Colt cartridges. Later Taurus introduced the Raging Judge Magnum based on their Raging <b>Bull</b> model <b>designed</b> for magnum cartridges; the Raging Judge Magnum safely chambers [...]454 Casull as well as [...]45 Colt cartridges.|$|R
40|$|The {{elevation}} {{axis drive}} {{unit of the}} DSN 64 -m antennas is arranged so that its output pinion can self-align to the <b>bull</b> gear.
