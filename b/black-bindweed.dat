50|$|Fallopia {{convolvulus}} (<b>black-bindweed</b> or wild buckwheat) is {{a fast-growing}} annual flowering {{plant in the}} family Polygonaceae native throughout Europe, Asia and northern Africa. It is an arable plant.|$|E
50|$|While it superficially {{resemble}} bindweeds in {{the genus}} Convolvulus {{there are many}} notable differences; it has ocrea (stipule-sheath at nodes), which Convolvulus does not; and Convolvulus has conspicuous trumpet-shaped flowers while <b>Black-bindweed</b> has flowers that are unobtrusive and only about 4 mm long.|$|E
50|$|<b>Black-bindweed</b> is a {{herbaceous}} vine {{growing to}} 1 - 1.5 m long, with stems that twine clockwise round other plant stems. The alternate triangular leaves are 1.5-6 cm long and 0.7-3 cm broad with a 6-15 (-50) mm petiole; the basal lobes {{of the leaves}} are pointed at the petiole. The flowers are small, and greenish-pink to greenish white, clustered on short racemes. These clusters give way to small triangular achenes, with one seed in each achene.|$|E
5000|$|Nut {{shells and}} seeds: Remains of nut shells and seeds were {{recovered}} from almost all sites where, at times, they formed entire layers. Together with roasting hearths {{they form a}} recurring feature at Duvensee. In addition to hazelnuts, {{there is also evidence}} for the processing of other plants as well. Burned seeds of Nuphar lutea (yellow water-lilly) and genus Typha (bulrush) were recovered from the hearth of Wp6, whilst Wp5 yielded a substantial amount of Polygonum convolvulus (<b>black-bindweed)</b> seed.|$|E
