5|$|At 07:50, Cota led {{the charge}} off of Dog Green, between WN-68 and WN-70, by forcing gaps in the wire with a <b>Bangalore</b> <b>torpedo</b> and wire cutters. Twenty minutes later, the 5th Rangers joined the advance, and blew more openings. The command party {{established}} themselves {{at the top of}} the bluff, and elements of G/116 and H/116 joined them, having earlier moved laterally along the beach, and now the narrow front had widened to the east. Before 09:00, small parties from F/116 and B/116 reached the crests just east of Dog White. The right flank of this penetration was covered by the survivors of the 2nd Rangers’ A and B companies, who had independently fought their way to the top between 08:00 and 08:30. They took WN-70 (already heavily damaged by naval shells), and joined the 5th Rangers for the move inland. By 09:00 more than 600 American troops, in groups ranging from company sized to just a few men, had reached the top of the bluff opposite Dog White and were advancing inland.|$|E

25|$|Bangalore {{was hit by}} {{a plague}} {{epidemic}} in 1898 that claimed nearly 3,500 lives. The crisis caused by the outbreak catalysed the city's sanitation process. Telephone lines were laid to help co-ordinate anti-plague operations. Regulations for building new houses with proper sanitation facilities came into effect. A health officer was appointed and the city divided into four wards for better co-ordination. Victoria Hospital was inaugurated in 1900 by Lord Curzon, the then Governor-General of British India. New extensions in Malleswaram and Basavanagudi were developed in the north and south of the pētē. In 1903, motor vehicles came to be introduced in Bangalore. In 1906, Bangalore {{became one of the first}} cities in India to have electricity from hydro power, powered by the hydroelectric plant situated in Shivanasamudra. The Indian Institute of Science was established in 1909, which subsequently played a major role in developing the city as a science research hub. In 1912, the <b>Bangalore</b> <b>torpedo,</b> a defensive explosive weapon widely used in World War I and World War II, was devised in Bangalore by British army officer Captain McClintock of the Madras Sappers and Miners.|$|E

25|$|By August Wilson had two elite {{divisions}} {{under his}} command, 63rd (Royal Naval) Division and 9th (Scottish) Division, but resisted pressure from Haig to conduct another attack until after 1 September. Wilson {{was aware that}} the greater success of French attacks on the Somme was largely owed to more concentrated artillery fire, and that British attacks at High Wood and Guillemont (late July) were less successful. It was decided to use a short hurricane bombardment rather than a gas attack, and Wilson’s men experimented (in vain) with a flamethrower (in May he had been impressed by an explosive device, a sort of prototype <b>Bangalore</b> <b>torpedo,</b> to clear wire). Wilson was displeased at the poor state of air support but impressed by the early artillery sound-ranging device which he was shown. With Haig convinced {{he was going to}} “smash the Bosh on the Somme” in September, GHQ now postponed Wilson’s attack until October, and now wanted the whole of Vimy Ridge taken, which would mean a joint attack with XVII Corps. Some of Wilson’s artillery was moved down to the Somme. Wilson continued to work on air-artillery coordination and mining, but rejected a proposal to dig jumping-off trenches into No Mans Land, as this would give away the attack.|$|E
500|$|The assault troops rose {{early on}} 3 January 1941, ate a meal and drank a tot of rum. The leading {{companies}} began {{moving to the}} start line at 0416. The artillery opened fire at 0530. On crossing the start line the 2/1st Infantry Battalion, {{under the command of}} Lieutenant Colonel Kenneth Eather, came under Italian mortar and artillery fire. The lead platoons advanced accompanied by sappers of the 2/1st Field Company carrying Bangalore torpedoes— pipes packed with ammonal—as Italian artillery fire began to land, mainly behind them. An Italian shell exploded among a leading platoon and detonated a <b>Bangalore</b> <b>torpedo,</b> resulting in four killed and nine wounded. The torpedoes were slid under the barbed wire at [...] intervals. A whistle was blown as a signal to detonate the torpedoes but could not be heard over the din of the barrage. Colonel Eather became anxious and ordered the engineering party nearest him to detonate their torpedo. This the other teams heard, and they followed suit.|$|E
2500|$|Several {{months after}} the United States entered World War II, Ferguson joined the U.S. Army in 1942, and was {{commissioned}} as a second lieutenant after attending officers' candidate school. [...] On June 6, 1944, he led a platoon in the anti-tank company, 116th Infantry Regiment of the 29th Infantry Division in the Allies' D-Day landings on Omaha Beach in Nazi-occupied Normandy, France. [...] After landing in the second wave of the amphibious assault, Ferguson and his platoon, {{as well as the}} survivors from the first wave, were pinned down on the beach by heavy rifle, machine gun and artillery fire from the German defenders, and their advance was blocked by extensive barbed wire and other enemy obstacles. [...] Ferguson rose under fire, cleared a passage through the enemy obstacles with a <b>Bangalore</b> <b>torpedo,</b> and was gravely wounded while leading his men in a direct frontal assault against the enemy. [...] Ferguson was awarded the U.S. Army's Distinguished Service Cross, the nation's second highest medal for gallantry, for [...] "extraordinary heroism" [...] in combat on June 6, 1944.|$|E
50|$|Tanks {{and light}} armored {{vehicles}} can generally flatten unmined wire obstacles, although the wire can become {{entangled in the}} tracks and immobilize the vehicle. This can also occur to wheeled vehicles once the wire becomes wrapped around the axle. Wire obstacles can also be breached by intense artillery shelling or <b>Bangalore</b> <b>torpedoes.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{night before}} the attack, {{battalion}} scouts from 1/14th Londons (the London Scottish), the right-hand battalion, found that the wire in their front had not been adequately cut by the British bombardment. With the help of two men from 2/1st Field Co, the London Scottish successfully exploded two <b>Bangalore</b> <b>torpedoes</b> to clear lanes through the wire.|$|R
50|$|The AVRE was {{designed}} after the Canadian failure at Dieppe. It could be fitted with numerous other attachments, such as mine ploughs, fascine bundles, carpet rollers, explosive placers, <b>Bangalore</b> <b>torpedoes</b> for clearing barbed wire obstacles, hand-emplaced demolition charges, amongst others. After the Second World War, the Churchill AVRE was re-armed with a breech-loaded low velocity 165mm demolition gun firing HESH shells.|$|R

With the aid of two tanks borrowed from the Jerusalem Brigade, they captured the Police Academy. After receiving reinforcements, they moved up to attack Ammunition Hill.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Bangalore</b> <b>torpedo</b> {{was first}} devised by Captain McClintock, of the British Indian Army unit the Madras Sappers and Miners at Bangalore, India, in 1912. He invented it {{as a means}} of {{exploding}} booby traps and barricades left over from the Boer War and the Russo-Japanese War. The <b>Bangalore</b> <b>torpedo</b> could be exploded over a mine without a sapper having to approach closer than about 3 m.|$|E

50|$|The Combat Engineers were {{organized}} in companies which were subsequently collected in battalions. The basic combat element was the platoon {{made up of}} two destruction teams (equipped with rifles, hand grenades, smoke sticks and <b>bangalore</b> <b>torpedoes</b> to open corridors and special charges to destroy fortifications) and two support teams (equipped with heavy machine guns and light mortars). This platoon was considered able to successfully strike a fortification {{with three or four}} active positions.|$|R
50|$|During {{an armed}} {{conflict}} {{there are several}} methods of countering land mines. These include using armoured vehicles to negate the effects of anti-personnel land mines. Land mines can also be cleared either by hand, or by using specialised equipment such as tanks equipped with flails. Explosives {{can also be used}} to clear mine fields, either by artillery bombardment, or with specialised charges such as <b>Bangalore</b> <b>torpedoes,</b> the Antipersonnel Obstacle Breaching System and the Python Minefield Breaching System.|$|R
