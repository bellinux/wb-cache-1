5|$|In 1974, {{a decade}} of work <b>began</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{construction}} of the Thames Barrier across the Thames at Woolwich {{to deal with this}} threat. While the barrier is expected to function as designed until roughly 2070, concepts for its future enlargement or redesign are already being discussed.|$|E

5|$|Responding to {{increased}} visitation and traffic congestion, the National Park Service implemented a voluntary, summer-only, in-park shuttle system in June 2000. In 2004, reconstruction <b>began</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> aging and inadequate road {{system in the}} park.|$|E

5|$|Three {{months after}} San Francisco {{approved}} the project, construction <b>began</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> South Tower with a groundbreaking ceremony on November 10, 2005. The South Tower was the second-tallest tower {{under construction in}} San Francisco.|$|E
5|$|A {{substantial}} amount of rebuilding followed. In 1733, work <b>began</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> royal residence of Christiansborg Palace which was completed in 1745. In 1749, development of the prestigious district of Frederiksstaden was initiated. Designed by Nicolai Eigtved in the Rococo style, its centre contained the mansions which now form Amalienborg Palace. Major extensions to the naval base of Holmen were undertaken while the city's cultural importance was enhanced with the Royal Theatre and the Royal Academy of Fine Arts.|$|E
5|$|A {{week after}} the {{non-stop}} protests in Ottawa ended, non-stop protests <b>began</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> evening of 26 April {{in front of the}} Consulate of the United States in Toronto, urging Barack Obama to call for an immediate permanent ceasefire. Protesters sat down on University Avenue, occupying {{a large portion of the}} street. On the third day of the non-stop protest (29 April), fifteen arrests were made while one woman was injured after a brief scuffle with police. This incident was the first one to happen among these protests in Canada. The protests later shifted to Queen's Park with a diminished number of protesters.|$|E

50|$|Nanomonestotse traces {{its roots}} {{back to the}} early 1900s and a Native American woman named Marion Young, who is {{credited}} with passing the ideals of peace on to her descendants. Nanomonestotse Preparation <b>begins</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> third Monday of October. Nanomonestotse Celebration <b>begins</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> following Friday.|$|R
5000|$|The term [...] "morning" [...] {{means that}} <b>the</b> {{observance}} <b>begins</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> evening before. In traditional Christianity, {{the celebration of}} liturgical feasts <b>begins</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> evening before the holy day because the Early Church continued the Jewish practice of beginning the day at sunset rather than midnight.|$|R
5|$|After the {{enormous}} response to Myst, work quickly <b>began</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> next Myst game. Cyan moved from their cramped garage {{to a new}} office and hired additional programmers, designers, and artists. The game was to ship in late 1996, but the release was pushed back a year. Development costs were between $5 and $10 million, many times Mysts budget. After the release of Riven, Robyn Miller left the company to pursue other projects, while Rand stayed behind {{to work on a}} Myst franchise.|$|E
5|$|As 1943 {{gave way}} to 1944, many {{problems}} remained. Tests <b>began</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> machinery at K-25 in April 1944 without a barrier. Attention turned to a new process developed by Kellex. Finally, in July 1944, Kellex barriers began to be installed in K-25. K-25 commenced operation in February 1945, and as cascade after cascade came online, {{the quality of the}} product increased. By April 1945, K-25 had attained a 1.1% enrichment. Uranium partially enriched in K-25 was fed into the calutrons at Y-12 to complete the enrichment process.|$|E
5|$|As {{in other}} dromaeosaurs, Velociraptor tails had long bony {{projections}} (prezygapophyses) {{on the upper}} surfaces of the vertebrae, as well as ossified tendons underneath. The prezygapophyses <b>began</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> tenth tail (caudal) vertebra and extended forward to brace four to ten additional vertebrae, depending on position in the tail. These were once thought to fully stiffen the tail, forcing the entire tail {{to act as a}} single rod-like unit. However, at least one specimen has preserved a series of intact tail vertebrae curved sideways into an S-shape, suggesting that there was considerably more horizontal flexibility than once thought.|$|E

50|$|Glen Lough {{is about}} 5 km east of Creeslough. It {{measures}} about 3 km long and 0.5 km wide and lies {{just north of}} Lough Beagh and Glenveagh National Park. <b>The</b> Derryveagh Mountains <b>begin</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> lake's western side and <b>the</b> Glendowan Mountains <b>begin</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> lake's southern end.|$|R

5|$|Burr {{was quickly}} called to Canada's Naval Services Headquarters {{to discuss how}} to apply {{diffused}} lighting camouflage. Simple tests in the laboratory served as proof of concept. In January 1941, sea trials <b>began</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> new corvette HMCS Cobalt. She was fitted with ordinary light projectors—neither designed for robustness, nor waterproofed—on temporary supports {{on one side of}} the hull; brightness was controlled manually. The trial was sufficiently promising for a better prototype to be developed.|$|E
5|$|Construction <b>began</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{southern}} {{portion of}} SR75 in mid-1974. In January 1976, {{the part of}} SR75 between I-805 and Otay Mesa Road was opened to traffic. On April 6, the next portion of the freeway opened. However, there were concerns about what to call the freeway, citing confusion with the northern portion of SR75. The entire cost {{of the project was}} $6.3million. SR117 was extended east to SR125, replacing the southerly segment of SR75, by the Legislature in 1976; this took effect at the beginning of 1977. Estimates for completing the freeway ran from $13.8million to $28.5million.|$|E
5|$|Construction on I-270 {{began in}} 1965. The first portion cost about $2.7million. It opened in 1968, {{connecting}} I-70 to Vasquez Boulevard. Two years later, another two-mile (3.2km) segment connected the portion already {{in service to}} I-80S. I-80S became I-76 in 1976. Construction <b>began</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> section between I-76 and I-25 in April 1993 and was finished in September 1999, costing $11.4million. The mileposts were already established when construction took place, so the route was not assigned new mileposts. Completion of this portion largely decreased traffic problems in the area.|$|E

5|$|Damage to the {{crossing}} {{resulted in the}} closure of the QEW until a temporary bridge was erected. To remedy what was becoming a major delay and hazard, the Department of Highways began planning a high-level bridge to cross the shipping channel. To provide better access to the new structure as well as the proposed Chedoke Expressway, construction <b>began</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Freeman Diversion, bypassing the old trumpet interchange and creating a new three-level stack. Work on both proceeded over the next six years.|$|E
5|$|Demonstrations <b>began</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{evening of}} 5 July with a protest in the Grand Bazaar, a {{prominent}} tourist site, and crowd reportedly gathering at the People's Square area. The demonstration began peacefully, and official and eyewitness accounts {{reported that it}} involved about 1,000 Uyghurs; the WUC said approximately 10,000 protesters took part.|$|E
5|$|Despite this, {{construction}} <b>began</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> east–west expressway in 1991 under a 50/50 cost-sharing agreement {{while the}} City of Hamilton attempted {{to sue the}} provincial government for the reinstatement of funding for the north–south portion. In April 1992, work began on overpasses at Upper Paradise Road and Upper Sherman Avenue.|$|E
5000|$|According to Diack Johnstone [...] "this seems {{generally}} {{to be regarded}} as the exact inversion of <b>the</b> trill, <b>beginning</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> note below the principal note. However, several authorities table <b>the</b> beat as <b>beginning</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> principal note, and it is impossible to tell from the music which interpretation is intended.".|$|R

5|$|Development of Virtue's Last Reward <b>began</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Nintendo DS, {{but this}} changed early in {{production}} following {{the announcement of}} the Nintendo 3DS and PlayStation Vita. The development team at Chunsoft wanted to utilize the three-dimensional (3D) features of the newer systems, and changed production of the game to the Nintendo 3DS and PlayStation Vita. As neither system had been released yet, the team was under the assumption that the 3D features would require 3D character models. Uchikoshi later remarked that designing 3D character models proved to be a challenge for Chunsoft due to company's inexperience with 3D effects.|$|E
5|$|Dunstan became {{patron saint}} of English goldsmiths and {{silversmith}}s because {{he worked as a}} silversmith making church plate. His Feast Day is 19 May, which is why before the Restoration the date year on London Assay Office hallmarks ran from 19 May one year to 18 May the next, not the calendar year. This was changed at the restoration of Charles II in 1660 so that the hallmarking year <b>began</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> King's birthday, 29 May.|$|E
5|$|Following {{passage of}} the act, a series of test strikes {{depicting}} Martha Washington were carried out to test a variety of gold-colored metallic compositions. Although the act provided for creation of the new coin, it also allowed for resumption of striking the Anthony design until production <b>began</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> gold-colored dollar. Nearing depletion of Treasury stores, on May 20, 1999, the U.S. Mint announced that production of the Susan B. Anthony dollar would resume. In total, 41,368,000 Susan B. Anthony dollars were struck for circulation dated 1999. The design was officially retired in 2000, when the Sacagawea dollar entered production.|$|E
