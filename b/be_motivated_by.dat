5|$|Earnings {{management}} {{involves the}} manipulation of company earnings towards a pre-determined target. This target can <b>be</b> <b>motivated</b> <b>by</b> a preference for more stable earnings, in which case management {{is said to be}} carrying out income smoothing. Opportunistic income smoothing can in turn signal lower risk and increase a firm's market value. Other possible motivations for earnings management include the need to maintain the levels of certain accounting ratios due to debt covenants, and the pressure to maintain increasing earnings and to beat analyst targets.|$|E
5|$|In fluid dynamics, Couette flow is {{the flow}} of a viscous fluid {{in the space between}} two surfaces, one of which is moving {{tangentially}} relative to the other. The configuration often takes the form of two parallel plates or the gap between two concentric cylinders. The flow is driven by virtue of viscous drag force acting on the fluid, but may additionally <b>be</b> <b>motivated</b> <b>by</b> an applied pressure gradient in the flow direction. The Couette configuration models certain practical problems, like flow in lightly loaded journal bearings, and is often employed in viscometry and to demonstrate approximations of reversibility. This type of flow is named in honor of Maurice Couette, a Professor of Physics at the French University of Angers in the late 19th century.|$|E

5|$|In the infancy of the hacker {{subculture}} and {{the computer}} underground, criminal convictions were rare because there was an informal code of ethics {{that was followed by}} white hat hackers. Proponents of hacking claim to <b>be</b> <b>motivated</b> <b>by</b> artistic and political ends, but are often unconcerned about the use of criminal means to achieve them. White hat hackers break past computer security for non-malicious reasons and do no damage, akin to breaking into a house and looking around. They enjoy learning and working with computer systems, and by this experience gain a deeper understanding of electronic security. As the computer industry matured, individuals with malicious intentions (black hats) would emerge to exploit computer systems for their own personal profit.|$|E
5|$|The term {{greenwashing}} {{was first}} used by environmentalist Jay Westerveld when objecting to hotelier's practice of placing notices in hotel rooms which asked their guests to reuse towels to “save the environment”. Westerveld noted {{that there was little}} else to suggest that the hoteliers were interested in reducing their environmental impacts, and that their interest in washing fewer towels seemed to <b>be</b> <b>motivated</b> <b>by</b> a concern to save costs rather than the environment. Since then greenwashing has become a central feature of debates about marketing communications and sustainability, with “awards” for greenwashing established and numerous campaigns, law and advices developed in an attempt to reduce or curb it.|$|E
5|$|Western jackdaws {{practice}} active food sharing– {{where the}} initiative {{for the transfer}} lies with the donor– {{with a number of}} individuals, regardless of sex or kinship. They also share more of a preferred food than a less preferred food. The active giving of food by most birds is found mainly in the context of parental care and courtship. Western jackdaws show much higher levels of active giving than has been documented for other species, including chimpanzees. The function of this behaviour is not fully understood, though it {{has been found to be}} detached from nutrition and compatible with hypotheses of mutualism, reciprocity and harassment avoidance. It has also been proposed that food sharing may <b>be</b> <b>motivated</b> <b>by</b> prestige enhancement.|$|E

5|$|When Borah went to Washington for the Senate's regular {{session in}} December 1907, he was {{immediately}} {{a figure of}} note, {{not only for the}} dramatic events in Idaho, but for keeping his Western habits, including wearing a ten-gallon hat. It was then the custom that junior senators wait perhaps a year before giving their maiden speech, but at Roosevelt's request, in April 1908, Borah spoke in defense of the president's dismissal of over a hundred African American soldiers in the Brownsville Affair, their cause pressed by the fiery Ohio senator, Joseph B. Foraker. The soldiers were supposed to have shot up a Texas town, and Borah stated that their alleged actions were as wrongful as the murder of Steunenberg. The accusations were later deemed to <b>be</b> <b>motivated</b> <b>by</b> racism, and in 1972, long after the deaths of Roosevelt, Borah, and most of the soldiers, the dismissals were reversed.|$|E
