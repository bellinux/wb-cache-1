5|$|<b>Bristle</b> {{toothbrush}}: According to a Library of Congress website, the Chinese {{have used}} the <b>bristle</b> toothbrush since 1498, {{during the reign of}} the Hongzhi Emperor (r. 1487–1505) of the Ming Dynasty (1368–1644); it also adds that the toothbrush was not mass-produced until 1780, when they were sold by a William Addis of Clerkenwell, London, England. In accordance with the Library of Congress website, scholar John Bowman also writes that the <b>bristle</b> toothbrush using pig bristles was invented in China during the 1490s. While Bonnie L. Kendall agrees with this, she noted that a predecessor existed in ancient Egypt {{in the form of a}} twig that was frayed at the end.|$|E
5|$|The living {{members of}} the Diplopoda are divided into sixteen orders in two {{subclass}}es. The basal subclass Penicillata contains a single order, Polyxenida (<b>bristle</b> millipedes). All other millipedes belong to the subclass Chilognatha consisting of two infraclasses: Pentazonia, containing the short-bodied pill millipedes, and Helminthomorpha (worm-like millipedes), containing {{the great majority of}} the species.|$|E
5|$|The wool {{quality of}} a Herdwick has unique qualities {{relating}} to durability. Thick <b>bristle</b> type fibres will often protrude from garments forming a protective barrier layer in blizzards—most likely the same qualities that protect the sheep in similar conditions. They {{have been known to}} survive under a blanket of snow for three days while eating their own wool.|$|E

50|$|New-world tarantulas (those {{found in}} North and South America) are {{equipped}} with urticating hairs (technically <b>bristles)</b> on their abdomen, and will almost always throw these barbed <b>bristles</b> as a first line of defense. These <b>bristles</b> will irritate sensitive areas {{of the body and}} especially seem to target curious animals who may sniff these <b>bristles</b> into the mucous membranes of the nose. Some species have more effective urticating <b>bristles</b> than others. The Goliath Birdeater is one species known for its particularly irritating urticating <b>bristles.</b> Urticating <b>bristles</b> can penetrate the cornea so eye protection should be worn when handling such tarantulas.|$|R
5|$|There {{are also}} {{a number of small}} items of {{uncertain}} function, described as toiletry pieces. Some are picks, others perhaps scrapers, and three have empty sockets at one end, which probably contained organic material such as <b>bristle,</b> to make a brush. The size of these would be appropriate for cleaning the teeth or applying cosmetics, among other possibilities.|$|E
5|$|Operation Pig <b>Bristle</b> was {{an unusual}} {{transport}} task conducted by the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) in May 1946. The operation was ordered by the Australian Government {{in response to a}} national shortage of paint brushes, which was hindering house-building efforts. No. 38 Squadron of the RAAF was given the task of transporting 25 tonnes of pig bristles from Chongqing in China to Hong Kong, from where the bristles were shipped to Australia. The squadron completed this task over a two-week period.|$|E
5|$|Another 2016 {{study used}} laser-stimulated {{fluorescence}} imaging {{to analyze the}} internal structure of the bristles. The highly cornified bristles are arranged in tight clusters of three to six individual bristles, with each <b>bristle</b> being filled with pulp. The authors considered the bristles as being homologous to the quills of Tianyulong, the elongated broad filamentous feathers (EBFFs) of Beipiaosaurus, and possibly the feathers of birds as well. Similar bristles are found in extant birds such as the horned screamer; these structures differ from feathers in {{that they do not}} develop from a follicle, but both arise from discrete cell populations. A darkened soft-tissue structure was also found near the jugal horn; this may represent a keratinous sheath or a skin flap.|$|E
50|$|For terms see Morphology of Diptera.The Lonchopteridae are minute, slender flies {{with long}} wings which are {{pointed at the}} apex.The head is rounded, with the outer {{vertical}} <b>bristles,</b> inner vertical <b>bristles,</b> ocellar <b>bristles,</b> interfrontal <b>bristles,</b> and <b>bristles</b> along {{the margin of the}} broad mouth very well developed. The mesonotum and scutellum and legs have well developed <b>bristles.</b> The radial vein R has three branches (R1, R2+3, R4+5). The median vein M is furcate (M1, M2). The anal vein A merges with the cubital vein Cu (female)or terminates freely (male).|$|R
50|$|Natural <b>bristles</b> {{are made}} from real hair as opposed to plastic. Many prefer to use natural <b>bristles,</b> since they could be less {{abrasive}} to the skin. Although natural <b>bristles</b> are more preferred in the cosmetic industry, the <b>bristles</b> themselves can cause allergic reactions because of the animal fur/hair. Natural <b>bristles</b> may be easier to control the product when blending out or even packing on a product. Natural <b>bristles</b> do have hair cuticles {{which is why it}} is easier for the brush to pick up more product and blending it out.|$|R

5|$|Li Shizhen (1518–93) – one of {{the most}} renowned pharmacologists and {{physicians}} in Chinese history – belonged to the late Ming period. His Bencao Gangmu is a medical text with 1,892 entries, each entry with its own name called a gang. The mu in the title refers to the synonyms of each name. Inoculation, although it can be traced to earlier Chinese folk medicine, was detailed in Chinese texts by the sixteenth century. Throughout the Ming dynasty, around fifty texts were published on the treatment of smallpox. In regards to oral hygiene, the ancient Egyptians had a primitive toothbrush of a twig frayed at the end, but the Chinese were the first to invent the modern <b>bristle</b> toothbrush in 1498, although it used stiff pig hair.|$|E
5|$|Millipedes show a {{diversity}} of mating styles and structures. In the basal order Polyxenida (<b>bristle</b> millipedes), mating is indirect: males deposit spermatophores onto webs they secrete with special glands, and the spermatophores are subsequently picked up by females. In all other millipede groups, males possess one or two pairs of modified legs called gonopods which are used to transfer sperm to the female during copulation. The location of the gonopods differs between groups: in males of the Pentazonia they are located {{at the rear of}} the body and known as telopods and may also function in grasping females, while in the Helminthomorpha – the vast majority of species – they are located on the seventh body segment. A few species are parthenogenetic, having few, if any, males.|$|E
5|$|Most millipedes are slow-moving detritivores, eating {{decaying}} {{leaves and}} other dead plant matter. Some eat fungi or suck plant fluids, {{and a small}} minority are predatory. Millipedes are generally harmless to humans, although some can become household or garden pests, especially in greenhouses where they can cause severe damage to emergent seedlings. Most millipedes defend themselves {{with a variety of}} chemicals secreted from pores along the body, although the tiny <b>bristle</b> millipedes are covered with tufts of detachable bristles. Reproduction in most species is carried out by modified male legs called gonopods, which transfer packets of sperm to females.|$|E

5|$|The hilltops {{are covered}} in {{heathland}} of gorse, heather, bracken and thorn with plantations of conifer. The {{western side of the}} Quantocks are steep scarp slopes of pasture, woods and parkland. Deep stream-cut combes to the north-east contain extensive oak-woods with small flower-rich bogs above them. The areas where there is limited drainage are dominated by heather (Calluna vulgaris), with significant populations of cross-leaved heath (Erica tetralix), purple moor-grass (Molinia caerulea), bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus) and wavy hair-grass (Deschampsia flexuosa). Drier areas are covered with bell heather (Erica cinerea), western gorse (Ulex gallii) and <b>bristle</b> bent (Agrostis curtisii), while bracken (Pteridium aquilinum) is common on well-drained deeper soils. The springs and streams provide a specialist environment that supports bog pimpernel (Anagallis tenella). The woodland is generally birch/sessile oak woodland, valley alder woodland and ash/wych elm woodland, which support a rich lichen flora. Alfoxton Wood is one of only three British locations where the lichen Tomasellia lectea is present.|$|E
5|$|The larvae are {{generally}} whitish grubs, roughly oval and bluntly-pointed at both ends. They have fifteen segments and spiracles in each segment for breathing. They have no legs but {{are able to}} move {{within the confines of}} the cell, helped by tubercles on their sides. They have short horns on the head, jaws for chewing their food and an appendage on either side of the mouth tipped with a <b>bristle.</b> There is a gland under the mouth that secretes a viscous liquid which solidifies into the silk they use to produce their cocoons. The pupa can be seen through the semi-transparent cocoon and over the course of a few days, the insect undergoes metamorphosis into the form of the adult bee. When ready to emerge, it splits its skin dorsally and climbs out of the exuviae as a winged adult and breaks out of the cell.|$|E
25|$|The {{characteristics}} and arrangement of hairlike bristles {{are used to}} tell the difference between members of this family. All blow flies have bristles located on the meron. Having two notopleural bristles and a hindmost posthumeral <b>bristle</b> located lateral to presutural <b>bristle</b> are characteristics to look for when identifying this family.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Bristles</b> are {{distinguished}} as [...] (split, bushy ends) or unflagged; {{these are}} {{also known as}} [...] or unflocked <b>bristles.</b> In cleaning applications, flagged <b>bristles</b> are suited for dry cleaning (due to picking up dust better than unflagged), and unflagged suited for wet cleaning (due to flagged ends becoming dirty and matted when wet). In painting, flagged <b>bristles</b> yield more even application.|$|R

50|$|Brushes are {{a set of}} <b>bristles</b> {{connected}} to a handle so that the <b>bristles</b> make a rounded fan shape. They are often used in jazz or blues music, but also in other genres such as rock, country and pop. The <b>bristles</b> can be made of metal or plastic; the handles are commonly made of wood or aluminum, and are often coated with rubber. Some brushes are telescoping so that the <b>bristles</b> can be pulled inside a hollow handle and the fan made by the <b>bristles</b> can be of variable length, width and density. Retracting the <b>bristles</b> also protects the brush {{when it is not}} being used. The non-bristled end of the brush may end in a loop or a ball.|$|R
25|$|Modern {{toothbrush}} {{originated in}} China. The first <b>bristle</b> toothbrush resembling the modern one {{was found in}} China. Used during the Tang Dynasty (619–907), it consisted of hog bristles. The bristles were sourced from hogs living in Siberia and northern China because the colder temperatures provided firmer bristles. They were attached to a handle manufactured from bamboo or bone, forming a toothbrush. In 1223, Japanese Zen master Dōgen Kigen recorded on Shōbōgenzō that he saw monks in China clean their teeth with brushes made of horsetail hairs attached to an oxbone handle. The <b>bristle</b> toothbrush spread to Europe, brought from China to Europe by travellers. It was adopted in Europe during the 17th century. The earliest identified {{use of the word}} toothbrush in English was in the autobiography of Anthony Wood who wrote in 1690 that he had bought a toothbrush from J. Barret. Europeans found the hog <b>bristle</b> toothbrushes imported from China too firm and preferred softer <b>bristle</b> toothbrushes made from horsehair. Mass produced toothbrushes made with horse or boar <b>bristle</b> continued to be imported to England from China until the mid 20th century.|$|E
