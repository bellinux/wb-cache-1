50|$|Assuming {{there is}} no {{intracardiac}} shunt, the pulmonary blood flow equals the systemic <b>blood</b> flow. Measurement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> arterial and venous oxygen content <b>of</b> <b>blood</b> involves <b>the</b> sampling <b>of</b> <b>blood</b> from <b>the</b> pulmonary artery (low oxygen content) and from the pulmonary vein (high oxygen content). In practice, sampling <b>of</b> peripheral arterial <b>blood</b> is a surrogate for pulmonary venous <b>blood.</b> Determination <b>of</b> <b>the</b> oxygen consumption <b>of</b> <b>the</b> peripheral tissues is more complex.|$|R

5|$|In 2003 the BBC {{announced}} {{the return of}} Doctor Who, {{as a series of}} webcasts to air on bbc.com. Richard E. Grant was announced as the Ninth Doctor. A webcast, written by Paul Cornell, entitled Scream of the Shalka was completed, and aired on bbc.com. This was followed by an online short story entitled The Feast of the Stone. Work was already well underway on the third webcast, entitled <b>Blood</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Robots. This was to be written by Simon Clark. However, before production began, it was announced that Doctor Who would be returning to television, with Russell T. Davies as Producer. <b>Blood</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Robots was never made. <b>Blood</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Robots synopsis:- A blend of adventure, drama and humour. The Doctor arrives to find a world full of intelligent, sensitive robots that have been abandoned by their human owners, who are too squeamish to 'kill' them when they're obsolete. Now ruthless salvage squads are hunting the robots in order to make room for human settlers forced to migrate from their dangerously over-crowded home planet.|$|E

5|$|A vampire is a {{being from}} {{folklore}} that subsists by feeding {{on the life}} essence (generally {{in the form of}} <b>blood)</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> living. In European folklore, vampires were undead beings that often visited loved ones and caused mischief or deaths in the neighbourhoods they inhabited when they were alive. They wore shrouds and were often described as bloated and of ruddy or dark countenance, markedly different from today's gaunt, pale vampire which dates from the early 19th century.|$|E

5|$|According to a later {{episode of}} Devi Mahatmya, Durga created Matrikas from herself {{and with their}} help {{slaughtered}} the demon army of Shumbha-Nisumha.

Thus, the Devi Mahatmya identifies Chamunda with Kali.|$|E
5|$|In January 1937 Heydrich {{directed}} the SD to secretly begin collecting and analysing {{public opinion and}} report back their findings. He then had the Gestapo carry out house searches, arrests, and interrogations, thus in effect exercising control over public opinion. In February 1938 when the Austrian Chancellor Kurt Schuschnigg resisted Hitler's proposed merger with Germany, Heydrich intensified the pressure on Austria by organising Nazi demonstrations and distributing propaganda in Vienna stressing the common Germanic <b>blood</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two countries. In the Anschluss on 12 March, Hitler declared the unification of Austria with Nazi Germany.|$|E
5|$|The red-billed chough {{has a long}} {{association}} with Cornwall, and appears on the Cornish coat of arms. According to Cornish legend King Arthur did not die after his last battle but rather his soul migrated {{into the body of}} a red-billed chough, the red colour of its bill and legs being derived from the <b>blood</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> last battle and hence killing this bird was unlucky. Legend also holds that after the last Cornish chough departs from Cornwall, then the return of the chough, as happened in 2001, will mark the return of King Arthur.|$|E

5|$|As unrest grew the 64th {{took place}} in an {{incident}} which lays a claim to the first <b>blood</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> American War of Independence being shed in Salem, Massachusetts. On 26 February 1775 a supply of weapons and ammunition {{was known to be}} in Salem. The 64th, under their commander Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Leslie, were ordered to seize the weapons. American patriots in Salem were forewarned and tried to prevent the 64th from carrying out their orders. In the scuffle that ensued a local Salem man, Joseph Whicher, was slightly injured by a British bayonet. Negotiations prevented any further bloodshed and the 64th withdrew to Boston, their mission a failure.|$|E
5|$|Complement, an {{important}} component for serology, was first isolated from the <b>blood</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> guinea pig. Guinea pigs have an unusual insulin mutation, and are a suitable species for the generation of anti-insulin antibodies. Present at a level 10 times that found in other mammals, the insulin in guinea pigs may be important in growth regulation, a role usually played by growth hormone. Additionally, guinea pigs {{have been identified as}} model organisms for the study of juvenile diabetes and, because of the frequency of pregnancy toxemia, of pre-eclampsia in human females. Their placental structure {{is similar to that of}} humans, and their gestation period can be divided into trimesters that resemble the stages of fetal development in humans.|$|E

5|$|Finally, {{there is}} no attempt by the artist to soften the subject's {{brutality}} through technical skill. Method and subject are indivisible. Goya's procedure is determined less by the mandates of traditional virtuosity than by his intrinsically morbid theme. The brushwork could not be described as pleasing, and the colors are restricted to earth tones and black, punctuated by bright flashes of white and the red <b>blood</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> victims. The quality of the pigment itself foreshadows Goya's later works: a granular solution producing a matte, sandy finish. Few would admire the work for painterly flourishes, such is its horrific force and its lack of theatricality.|$|E
5|$|Increased Sabbat {{activity}} {{coincides with}} {{the disappearance of the}} Malkavian chief, Alistair Grout. At Grout's mansion, the fledgling sees Nines leaving and discovers Grout's remains in the mansion with vampire hunter Grunfeld Bach, who denies involvement in Grout's death. Learning about Nines' presence at the mansion, LaCroix tells the other chiefs to approve Nines' execution. The fledgling is sent to the Museum of Natural History to recover the sarcophagus, but finds that it has been stolen. Jack later suggests to the fledgling that LaCroix wants the sarcophagus to drink the <b>blood</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ancient within, gaining its power.|$|E
5|$|Matsya Purana tells a {{different}} story of Chamunda's origins. She with other matrikas was created by Shiva to help him kill the demon Andhakasura, who has an ability - like Raktabija - to generate from his dripping blood. Chamunda with the other matrikas drinks the <b>blood</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> demon ultimately helping Shiva kill him. Ratnakara, in his text Haravijaya, also describes this feat of Chamunda, but solely credits Chamunda, not the other matrikas of sipping the blood of Andhaka. Having drunk the blood, Chamunda's complexion changed to blood-red. The text further says that Chamunda does a dance of destruction, playing a musical instrument whose shaft is Mount Meru, the spring is the cosmic snake Shesha and gourd is the crescent moon. She plays the instrument during the deluge that drowns the world.|$|E
