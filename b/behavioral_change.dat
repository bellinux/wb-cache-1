25|$|According to {{the social}} {{learning}} theory (more recently expanded as social cognitive theory), behavioural change is determined by environmental, personal, and behavioural elements. Each factor affects each of the others. For example, in congruence {{with the principles of}} self-efficacy, an individual's thoughts affect their behaviour and an individual's characteristics elicit certain responses from the social environment. Likewise, an individual's environment affects the development of personal characteristics as well as the person's behavior, and an individual's behaviour may change their environment as well as the way the individual thinks or feels. Social learning theory focuses on the reciprocal interactions between these factors, which are hypothesised to determine <b>behavioral</b> <b>change.</b>|$|E
25|$|In Pakistan, {{the concept}} of Community-led total {{sanitation}} (CLTS) was first introduced as a pilot project in Mardan District in the North West Frontier Province in 2003 by UNICEF together with a local NGO IRSP (Integrated Regional Support Program). A main objective of the concept is to create open defecation free villages through <b>behavioral</b> <b>change</b> in the whole community, rather than to construct sanitation facilities for individual households. Since then, CLTS has spread rapidly {{in the whole country}} and became a main feature of the National Sanitation Policy, which provides financial rewards for defined outcomes. Development agencies began to link their funding and incentives to theopen defecation free status. For example, the Khushal Pakistan Fund has allocated about US$200 million (12 billion Pakistani rupees) to community infrastructure projects in open defecation free communities.|$|E
25|$|Critical to {{behavior}} analytic interventions {{is the concept}} of a systematic behavioral case formulation with a functional behavioral assessment or analysis at the core. This approach should apply a behavior analytic theory of change (see <b>Behavioral</b> <b>change</b> theories). This formulation should include a thorough functional assessment, a skills assessment, a sequential analysis (behavior chain analysis), an ecological assessment, a look at existing evidenced-based behavioral models for the problem behavior (such as Fordyce's model of chronic pain) and then a treatment plan based on how environmental factors influence behavior. Some argue that behavior analytic case formulation can be improved with an assessment of rules and rule-governed behavior. Some of the interventions that result from this type of conceptualization involve training specific communication skills to replace the problem behaviors as well as specific setting, antecedent, behavior, and consequence strategies.|$|E

25|$|Though not {{the first}} {{methodology}} {{in the practice of}} individual verbal psychotherapy, Freud's psychoanalytic system came to dominate the field from early in the twentieth century, forming the basis for many later variants. While these systems have adopted different theories and techniques, all have followed Freud by attempting to achieve psychic and <b>behavioral</b> <b>change</b> through having patients talk about their difficulties. Psychoanalysis is not as influential as it once was in Europe and the United States, though {{in some parts of the}} world, notably Latin America, its influence in the later 20th century expanded substantially. Psychoanalysis also remains influential within many contemporary schools of psychotherapy and has led to innovative therapeutic work in schools and with families and groups. There is a body of research findings which support the efficacy of psychodynamic therapies in treating a wide range of psychological disorders.|$|E
25|$|The {{vital role}} of miRNAs in gene {{expression}} is significant to addiction, specifically alcoholism. Chronic alcohol abuse results in persistent changes in brain function mediated {{in part by}} alterations in gene expression. miRNA global regulation of many downstream genes deems significant regarding the reorganization or synaptic connections or long term neuroadaptions involving the <b>behavioral</b> <b>change</b> from alcohol consumption to withdrawal and/or dependence. Up to 35 different miRNAs {{have been found to}} be altered in the alcoholic post-mortem brain, all of which target genes that include the regulation of the cell cycle, apoptosis, cell adhesion, nervous system development and cell signaling. Altered miRNA levels were found in the medial prefrontal cortex of alcohol-dependent mice, suggesting the role of miRNA in orchestrating translational imbalances and the creation of differentially expressed proteins within an area of the brain where complex cognitive behavior and decision making likely originate.|$|E
25|$|Health psychologists {{promote health}} through <b>behavioral</b> <b>change,</b> as {{mentioned}} above; however, {{they attempt to}} prevent illness in other ways as well. Health psychologists try to help people to lead a healthy life by developing and running programmes which can help people {{to make changes in}} their lives such as stopping smoking, reducing the amount of alcohol they consume, eating more healthily, and exercising regularly. Campaigns informed by health psychology have targeted tobacco use. Those least able to afford tobacco products consume them most. Tobacco provides individuals with a way of controlling aversive emotional states accompanying daily experiences of stress that characterize the lives of deprived and vulnerable individuals. Practitioners emphasize education and effective communication as a part of illness prevention because many people do not recognize, or minimize, the risk of illness present in their lives. Moreover, many individuals are often unable to apply their knowledge of health practices owing to everyday pressures and stresses. A common example of population-based attempts to motivate the smoking public to reduce its dependence on cigarettes is anti-smoking campaigns.|$|E

ObjectiveThe {{aim of this study}} was to analyze <b>behavioral</b> <b>changes</b> and its relation to disease characteristics, disability, and cognitive impairments in patients with MS. MethodThis is a single-center cross-sectional study. A detailed neuropsychological examination, including the Frontal Systems Behavior Scale (FrSBe), the Beck depression inventory (BDI), and the Wuerzburg Fatigue Inventory for Multiple Sclerosis (WEIMuS) test, was performed. FrSBe results were correlated with disease characteristics, disability, and cognitive assessments. Results 66 patients were enrolled (mean age: 43. 4 [*]years; disease duration: 9. 3 [*]years; Expanded Disability Status Scale: 3. 0). Up to one third of patients showed <b>behavioral</b> <b>changes</b> in at least one domain or the total score of the FrSBe. Patients were mildly affected with regard to cognitive functioning. Consistent correlation was found between <b>behavioral</b> <b>changes</b> and fatigue (WEIMuS) and depressive symptoms (BDI), but not with disease characteristics, disability, or cognitive functions. There was an increase of <b>behavioral</b> <b>changes</b> on all FrSBe scales in the current status compared to the retrospectively rated status before disease onset. Self- and family ratings with regard to current <b>behavioral</b> <b>changes</b> were similar. ConclusionBehavioral changes {{are common in}} otherwise mildly affected MS patients with up to one third being affected. In this patient cohort, <b>behavioral</b> <b>changes</b> occur largely independent of disease characteristics, physical disability, and cognitive functioning but correlate with both fatigue and depressive symptoms.

25|$|Another {{common cause}} of {{psychotic}} symptoms is substance intoxication. These acute symptoms may resolve {{after a period of}} observation or limited psychopharmacological treatment. However the underlying issues, such as substance dependence or abuse, is difficult to treat in the emergency room, as it is a long term condition. Both acute alcohol intoxication as well as other forms of substance abuse can require psychiatric interventions. Acting as a depressant of the central nervous system, the early effects of alcohol are usually desired for and characterized by increased talkativeness, giddiness, and a loosening of social inhibitions. Besides considerations of impaired concentration, verbal and motor performance, insight, judgment and short term memory loss which could result in <b>behavioral</b> <b>change</b> causing injury or death, levels of alcohol below 60 milligrams per deciliter of blood are usually considered non-lethal. However, individuals at 200 milligrams per deciliter of blood are considered grossly intoxicated and concentration levels at 400 milligrams per deciliter of blood are lethal, causing complete anesthesia of the respiratory system. Beyond the dangerous behavioral changes that occur after the consumption of certain amounts of alcohol, idiosyncratic intoxication could occur in some individuals even after the consumption of relatively small amounts of alcohol. Episodes of this impairment usually consist of confusion, disorientation, delusions and visual hallucinations, increased aggressiveness, rage, agitation and violence. Chronic alcoholics may also suffer from alcoholic hallucinosis, wherein the cessation of prolonged drinking may trigger auditory hallucinations. Such episodes can last for a few hours or an entire week. Antipsychotics are often used to treat these symptoms.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Owing to {{improvements}} in animal welfare, {{such as in}} nutrition, preventive medicine, and diagnostic tools, older dogs have become increasingly more prevalent than before. Unfortunately, there is {{an increasing number of}} dogs presenting <b>behavioral</b> <b>changes</b> correlated with this growth in the geriatric population. However, many of these owners consider these signs as normal for old age. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of clinical signs related with <b>behavioral</b> <b>changes</b> in the canine geriatric population admitted to the Veterinary Hospital of the Veterinary Medicine and Animal Science College of Universidade Estadual Paulista. The owners of 800 old dogs completed a questionnaire about disorientation, changes in social interaction, loss of training (house soiling), changes in the wake-sleep cycle, physical activity, memory, learning, consciousness, and perception. The results showed that the prevalence of <b>behavioral</b> <b>changes</b> in the canine geriatric population was 90. 7 % of dogs that presented {{at least one of these}} <b>behavioral</b> <b>changes,</b> and 22. 3 % with at least six changes, and with changes in physical activity (58. 5 %) and loss of acquired training (30. 2 %) being the highest percentage groups that were reported by the owners. We concluded that the prevalence of <b>behavioral</b> <b>changes</b> related with aging in the canine geriatric population was high, and that it was important to include questions about <b>behavioral</b> <b>changes</b> during regular veterinary clinical appointments to identify these clinical signs earlier and investigate the possible causes of the cognitive impairment, including neurological diseases, such as Canine Cognitive Dysfunction Syndrome...|$|R

Kaskutas noted two studies which both found that 70% of those who attended twelve-step groups at least weekly were abstaining from alcohol consumption at follow ups two and sixteen years later. Those who attended less than once per week showed about the same success rate as those who didn’t attend meetings. Kaskutas also found AA to function consistently with known <b>behavioral</b> <b>change</b> theories and substantial empirical support for specific mechanisms through which AA facilitates change.|$|E

2500|$|The {{government}} has made {{a concerted effort to}} promote good health-related behaviors. In most rural areas, a network of National Patriotic Health Campaign Committee (NPHCC) workers, the All-China Women's Federation representatives, the Communist Youth League of China, local epidemic prevention stations, and schools have led health education campaigns encouraging a wide array of hygienic behaviors. That work, combined with a high literacy rate (even in poor areas), has led to widespread knowledge of many basic health behaviors, such as the importance of drinking boiled water. However, actual <b>behavioral</b> <b>change</b> has been slow to follow, especially in poor areas where fuel may be scarce and understanding of the link between raw water or unwashed hands and diarrhea is tenuous. Thus, the problem is more one of the effectiveness of health messages than of their dissemination: In the late 1990s, health education in most rural areas provided little concrete information to link hygienic behavior to improved health, and most provinces still lacked specialized health education training. As a result, significant disparities exist between poorer and wealthier rural counties, both among and within provinces in China. While a number of wealthier and middle-income rural counties have experienced tremendous health-related benefits as a result of improvements in water supply and sanitation, poorer counties with more limited resources have yet to receive similar benefits.

2500|$|When Cameron first {{appeared}} in the pilot episode, she behaved with more human mannerisms, but these faded in subsequent episodes. It has been confirmed by Friedman that this <b>behavioral</b> <b>change</b> {{was the result of a}} conscious decision; however the explanations he has given of the logistics behind this decision have varied. At the Television Critics Association press tour, he stated that within the story, Cameron had been prepared for the events of the pilot. Once the characters [...] "jumped forward in time though, she was as adrift as everyone else". In an interview with IGN, Friedman stated that as he wrote the second episode, he became interested in exploring the [...] "calmer, odder part of" [...] Cameron, reflected in a scene in the pilot in which Cameron asks questions of John [...] "in a very programmed way". He continued to say that Cameron's behavior may appear inconsistent to a viewer, but that this inconsistency may be operative in the completion of her tasks. In any case, the character's robotic interactions with humans were manipulated for humor, but Friedman did express a wish to avoid [...] "cheap jokes" [...] in favor of more seriously exploring Cameron's existence as a cyborg. Summer Glau in an interview said about Cameron's changing behavior: [...] "We were experimenting with Cameron quite a bit, and we wanted her to be able to seem human. We wanted especially John to be fooled by her, so that he would let her into his life. And so in the pilot, I do act very human. And then as I go through the series, it appears that I’ve taken steps back and that I am acting more like a Terminator would. We did that for several different reasons, but I know for me it's fun because I get to take more time for her development, her human development.
