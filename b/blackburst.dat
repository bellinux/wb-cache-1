5000|$|V5 - In 2000 Squier made an {{exclusive}} run of six string Stagemasters for Mars Music. They came in HH configuration only and {{were available in}} three colors: Blueburst, Redburst, and <b>Blackburst.</b> Notable difference is the regular headstock that is not reversed {{like all the other}} Stagemasters. These came with a bolt on 24 fret neck, Licensed Floyd Rose tremolo bridge with a locking nut, black hardware, one vol/one tone knob, and a 3-way knife switch. These are known as the [...] "Mars Stagemasters". The 2nd generation 24-fret Solid Body Stagemaster featured many upgrades and was [...] "designed to compete with guitars costing 4 to 5 times as much." [...] One upgrade was wax potted pickups stock with the guitar. Another upgrade was rear-mounted electronics allowing for a guitar without pickguards. The Deluxe model featured neck-through three-piece maple necks, while the standard models featured a bolt-on one-piece neck with no scarf joint with the contoured heel. The reverse headstocks on the Stagemasters allow for completely straight string pull. Another nice feature is the inclusion of a brass bridge sustain block on the licensed Floyd Rose bridge, unusual quality in a budget-priced guitar. In 2002 the Stagemaster was renamed to Showmaster due to a trademark claim from Kramer, who made a guitar called the Stagemaster in the mid-late 1980's. V3 and V4 model Stagemaster guitars are known to exist labelled as [...] "Showmaster".|$|E

40|$|Obtaining collision-free CSMA MAC {{protocols}} and the QoS guarantees {{is possible}} by associating priorities represented by messages preceding the frames. The first {{approach is to}} use the <b>BlackBurst</b> technique (Sobrinho and Krishnakumar, 1996), (Pal et al., 2002). The idea is to let contending nodes send first jamming signals (called <b>BlackBurst</b> (BB) messages) of length according to the priority. The node that has the longest signal (i. e. the highest priority) wins the competition and then sends its frame. The drawback of this technique is that if we have a great priority number, the jamming signals will be very long and give important time delays. The second approach is to adapt the MAC protocol of the wired CAN bus (Bosch GmbH, 1991) (the priority of the frame is expressed by the ID field which precedes the data field) to the wireless context (You et al., 2003), (Pereira et al., 2007). We call this protocol CANlike. In this study, we are interested in the collision-free CSMA MAC protocols and thus we consider these two aphal- 00668745...|$|E

Collision-free Medium Access Control (MAC) protocols based on Carrier Sense Multiple Access (CSMA) are interesting solutions in considering real-time traffic in a wireless context. The goal {{of this paper is}} to precisely make an exhaustive presentation (which we think to be understandable and pedagogical) of the main collision-free CSMA MAC protocols for single-hop Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs), considering priorities associated to the frames. The priorities are represented by either the <b>BlackBurst</b> technique or an adaptation of the wired CAN bus protocol to the wireless context that we call CANlike.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{a broad range}} of work done in the field of Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs). It proposes several novel schemes which performance are analyzed. The thesis first proposes an Automatic Repeat reQuest (ARQ) scheme named as Selective Repeat / Multi-Copy (SR/MC). The purpose of the proposed SR/MC ARQ scheme is to transmit Internet Protocol (IP) packets efficiently in WLANs. At first the proposed scheme fragments an IP packet and transmits the fragments in Selective Repeat (SR) mode until the last fragment is transmitted after that, if erroneous fragments are still left, it goes in Multi Copy (MC) mode. In MC mode multiple copies of erroneous fragments are transmitted cyclically. A numerical performance analysis of the proposed SR/MC ARQ scheme is done and all its parameters are optimized. Using the simulation results of the Physical layer the optimized values are then used to study the performance of the scheme in terms of throughput both in an Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) channel and a flat Rayleigh fading channel. The numerical results show that the proposed SR/MC ARQ scheme gives an improvement of 8 dB when compared to the Selective Repeat + Stutter Scheme 2 (SR+ST 2) scheme, under flat Rayleigh fading channel using BCH(63, 51, 2) for the throughput of 0. 9. The measurement results also show similar performance. The proposed SR/MC ARQ scheme was implemented and applied for patent by the author; it was used for Wireless Network Interface Card (WNIC), a proprietary WLAN, of Uniden Corporation, Tokyo, Japan. Next a novel Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol, named as Channel Sharing Protocol (CSP), is proposed. The proposed CSP uses tokens in the wireless medium to give fair access of the medium to a large number of users. The scheme uses a p-persistence algorithm to avoid collision. Simulations were performed to optimize the different parameters of the proposed CSP and to study its performance. A numerical study was also done for performance evaluation. There is a difference between the numerical and the simulation results due to the assumptions made during the numerical performance evaluation. Both the numerical and the simulation results show that the proposed CSP outperforms the Carrier Sense Multiple Access/Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA) MAC protocol of the IEEE 802. 11 WLANs. A detailed design of the proposed CSP for implementation in WNIC was done and it was applied for patent by the author. Today the WLANs focus mainly on the non real time data communication while the market is looking towards real time traffic. Bearing this in mind the IEEE 802. 11, a WLAN standard, is working on MAC enhancements focusing on Quality of Service (QoS). Several QoS solutions for the IEEE 802. 11 existed when the work presented in this thesis was started. These solutions are <b>Blackburst,</b> priority queuing, the Distributed Coordination Function (DCF) and the Point Coordination Function (PCF). The work presented in this thesis was started at the preliminary stages of the IEEE 802. 11 e standardization. The purpose of the work was to give a first idea of an acceptable solution. In this thesis the four solutions are presented and a qualitative analysis is done. IEEE 802. 11 e has accepted priority queuing, chosen as the best solution in the thesis, as one of the solutions for QoS. Security in a wireless medium, a medium accessible to all, is a major issue. The WLAN currently in use, IEEE 802. 11, has been found to have several security flaws. Even before the security flaws were publicly known the IEEE 802. 11 standardization committee had started working on security enhancements. The work presented in this thesis was done during the preliminary stage of the IEEE 802. 11 i, security enhancements of IEEE 802. 11 MAC, standardization (then IEEE 802. 11 e). Some of the ideas were presented to the IEEE 802. 11 standardization committee. The work started with proposing requirements for various environments where the WLANs were envisioned to be used. The environments studied in this thesis are enterprise, academic and public. The security requirements for these environments are proposed in this thesis. Security solutions for each environment are also proposed herein. A qualitative analysis of the proposed solutions is also given in this thesis. A common problem in all the solutions was access control; so as to solve this problem an access control protocol is proposed. Finally the security issues for the future wireless communications systems are examined. The standard reflects some of the ideas presented in the thesis. The access control protocol proposed in the thesis, applied for patent by the author, is very similar to the now standardized IEEE 802. 11 f, Inter Access Point Protocol (IAPP). System design and planning of the network for the IEEE 802. 11 WLANs in different environments is a major issue. The IEEE 802. 11 standard gives several options for optimum system design while the standard makes use of the unlicensed band. The unlicensed band can be used by any wireless system fulfilling the regulatory requirements; these systems will cause interference with the IEEE 802. 11 WLANs at the same time IEEE 802. 11 has limited the number of non-overlapping channels. A study on systems design and deployment of the WLAN network is required. In this thesis the issues related to the IEEE 802. 11 system design and results of several deployment related critical issues like coverage, cell/frequency planning, interference, and data rate are examined. This work was used for system design and deployment of the ORiNOCO WLANs of Lucent Technologies. An automatic rate control scheme used by the ORiNOCO product was applied for patent by the author.
