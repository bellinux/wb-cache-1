5000|$|A new Submariner-Date, model 116613 (not to be {{confused}} with model 16613), based on the [...] "supercase" [...] used in the GMT II, was presented at the 2008 Basel show. The first Submariner-Date models offered were a yellow gold with <b>blue</b> <b>face</b> and bezel and a new white gold with <b>blue</b> <b>face</b> and bezel. The stainless steel case model was presented at the 2010 Basel show. Its reference is 116610.|$|R
50|$|Holly, after {{attempting}} to investigate on her own, is tricked {{into a car}} by <b>Blue</b> <b>Face</b> and Older Guy. Healy fights with Older Guy, while <b>Blue</b> <b>Face</b> tries to kill Amelia from inside his car, only to be stopped by Holly, who warns Amelia and then escapes with her. While chasing them down, <b>Blue</b> <b>Face</b> is seriously injured in a hit-and-run. As he lies dying {{in the middle of}} the road, he reveals to Healy that their boss has dispatched a hit man named John Boy to kill Amelia, March and his family to prevent further witnesses. Healy discreetly strangles <b>Blue</b> <b>Face</b> to death to protect March and Holly, and lies to Holly that he died of his injuries. After a brief investigation, the two are greeted by Amelia's mother, Judith Kuttner (Kim Basinger), a high-ranking official in the United States Department of Justice, who claims her daughter is delusional and paranoid and points them towards the Las Vegas mob trying to expand into the Los Angeles pornography scene.|$|R

30|$|In {{interactions}} involving exploitation or parasitism, one organisms benefit at {{the expense}} of the other, increasing its fitness (bigger dark <b>blue</b> <b>faces)</b> and reducing that of the other (small light <b>blue</b> <b>face).</b> In altruistic interaction the reverse hold. The altruist reduces its fitness and the other increases it. Interactions where altruists punish individuals not complying with social norms, both the altruist and the other reduce their fitness. In synergistic business both actors win, increasing their fitness, not necessarily by the same amount (Jaffe 2014 a).|$|R

5000|$|Painted by Bay Area artist Dwain Zerio (1950-1995), both front {{covers of}} each Automatic Man album feature a simple luminously painted <b>blue</b> alienlike <b>face</b> staring out from space. This 'alien' face {{was meant to}} be {{representative}} of a human without a body, with just the spiritual energy or 'aura' providing the visual shape. The debut album is blue on blue, while the follow-up Visitors features the <b>blue</b> <b>face</b> on a shocking pink and magenta background. The inside liner art of the first album includes the <b>blue</b> <b>face</b> with Egyptian wings, floating above a pyramid, rising Atlantis-like out of a raging ocean with a maelstrom in the background. The artwork for the [...] "My Pearl" [...] single featured a woman's face suspended over a misty crevasse crowned with wings and a self-consuming serpentine rainbow.|$|R

40|$|Barnette’s {{conjecture}} is {{the statement}} that every 3 -connected cubic planar bipartite graph is Hamiltonian. Goodey showed that the conjecture holds when all faces of the graph have either 4 or 6 sides. We generalize Goodey’s result by showing that when the faces of such a graph are 3 -colored, with adjacent faces having different colors, if {{two of the three}} color classes contain only faces with either 4 or 6 sides, then the conjecture holds. More generally, we consider 3 -connected cubic planar graphs that are not necessarily bipartite, and show that if the faces of such a graph are 2 -colored, with every vertex incident to one <b>blue</b> <b>face</b> and two red faces, and all red faces have either 4 or 6 sides, while the <b>blue</b> <b>faces</b> are arbitrary, provided that <b>blue</b> <b>faces</b> with either 3 or 5 sides are adjacent to a red face with 4 sides (but without any assumption on <b>blue</b> <b>faces</b> with 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, [...] . sides), then the graph is Hamiltonian. The approach is to consider the reduced graph obtained by contracting each <b>blue</b> <b>face</b> to a single vertex, so that the reduced graph has faces corresponding to the original red faces and with either 2 or 3 sides, and to show that such a reduced graph always contains a proper quasi spanning tree of faces. In general, for a reduced graph with arbitrary faces, we give a polynomial time algorithm based on spanning tree parity to decide if the reduced graph has a spanning tree of faces having 2 or 3 sides, while to decide if the reduced graph has a spanning tree of faces with 4 sides or of arbitrary faces is NP-complete for reduced graphs of even degree. As a corollary, we show that whether a reduced graph has a noncrossing Euler tour has a polynomial time algorithm if all vertices have degree 4 or 6, but is NP-complete if all vertices have degree 8. Finally, we show that if Barnette’s conjecture is false, then the question of whether a graph in the class of the conjecture is Hamiltonian is NP-complete. ...|$|R
25|$|Measuring 19–21cm (8in) in length, {{this small}} vibrant and brightly {{coloured}} parrot is sexually dimorphic. The male has a scarlet chest, a cobalt <b>blue</b> <b>face,</b> and bright green upperparts. The lower breast and underparts are yellow, and the wing coverts are pale blue. The tail is green, {{the eyes are}} brown and the bill is blackish, and legs are brown-grey. The female likewise has a <b>blue</b> <b>face,</b> although the coloration is less extensive, green upperparts and green breast, with yellow underparts. Immature birds are duller versions of their respective adult forms. Males begin to get red plumage on their chest from around {{two or three months}} of age, though do not complete their red chest until fifteen to eighteen months old.|$|R
