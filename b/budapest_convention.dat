50|$|The Convention on Cybercrime, {{also known}} as the <b>Budapest</b> <b>Convention</b> on Cybercrime or the <b>Budapest</b> <b>Convention,</b> is the first {{international}} treaty seeking to address Internet and computer crime by harmonizing national laws, improving investigative techniques, and increasing cooperation among nations. It was drawn up by the Council of Europe in Strasbourg, France, with the active participation of the Council of Europe's observer states Canada, Japan, South Africa and the United States.|$|E
50|$|After {{their victory}} in the war, the Russians then imposed the Treaty of San Stefano on the Ottomans, which, in part, reneged on pledges made in the <b>Budapest</b> <b>Convention</b> and {{declared}} that Bosnia-Herzegovina would be jointly occupied by Russian and Austrian troops.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Budapest</b> <b>Convention</b> was one {{of several}} secret {{agreements}} with which Russia sought to secure the support or at least the neutrality of Austria. In addition to Agreement of Reichstadt 1876 there was a supplementary convention to this treaty in March 1877.|$|E
50|$|The mid-1870s {{witnessed}} {{a series of}} violent rebellions against Ottoman rule in the Balkans, and equally violent and repressive responses from the Turks. The Russian Tsar, Alexander II, wanting to intervene against the Ottomans, sought and obtained an agreement with Austria-Hungary. In the <b>Budapest</b> <b>Conventions</b> of 1877, the two powers agreed that Russia would annex Bessarabia, and Austria-Hungary would observe a benevolent neutrality toward Russia in the pending war with the Turks. As compensation for this support, Russia agreed to Austria-Hungary's annexation of Bosnia-Herzegovina.|$|R

That treaty was overturned by the 1878 Treaty of Berlin, which allowed sole Austrian occupation of Bosnia-Herzegovina, but did not specify a final disposition of the provinces. That omission was addressed in the Three Emperors' League agreement of 1881, when both Germany and Russia endorsed Austria's right to annex Bosnia-Herzegovina. However, by 1897, under a new Tsar, the Russian Imperial government had again withdrawn its support for Austrian annexation of Bosnia-Herzegovina. The Russian foreign minister, Count Michael Muraviev, stated that an Austrian annexation of Bosnia-Herzegovina would raise [...] "an extensive question requiring special scrutiny".|$|R

The Russian foreign minister, Count Michael Muraviev, stated that an Austrian annexation of Bosnia-Herzegovina would raise [...] "an extensive question requiring special scrutiny". In 1908, the Russian foreign minister, Alexander Izvolsky again, and for the third time, offered Russian support for the annexation of Bosnia and Herzegovina by Austria-Hungary, in exchange for Austrian support {{for the opening of}} the Bosporus Strait and the Dardanelles to Russian warships. Austria's foreign minister, Alois von Aehrenthal, pursued this offer vigorously, resulting in the quid pro quo understanding with Izvolsky, reached on 16 September 1908 at the Buchlau Conference. However, Izvolsky made this agreement with Aehrenthal, without the knowledge of Tsar Nicholas II or his government in St. Petersburg, nor any of the other foreign powers including Britain, France and Serbia.|$|R
50|$|However, {{the main}} {{provision}} {{was the creation}} of a large Bulgarian state reaching from the Aegean Sea in the south to Lake Ohrid in the west. This development was met with dismay in Austria and Britain. The size of the new principality was interpreted as being in violation of the <b>Budapest</b> <b>convention.</b>|$|E
50|$|The later <b>Budapest</b> <b>Convention</b> of 1877 {{confirmed}} the main points, {{but when the}} war concluded with the Treaty of San Stefano in 1878, {{the terms of the}} treaty were quite different leading to Austrian insistence on convening a revision at the Congress of Berlin later that year. These events laid the background for the subsequent Bulgarian Crisis of 1885-1888, and ultimately World War I.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Budapest</b> <b>Convention</b> (Budapester Vertrag) was {{a secret}} {{agreement}} between Austria-Hungary and Russia in 1877 to agree on policies and the division of powers in Southeast Europe in the eventuality of war between Russia and the Ottoman Empire. The so-called Eastern Question (Orientalische Frage), {{the division of the}} declining Ottoman Empire in the Balkans (Southeast Europe), was a priority of the European great powers in the nineteenth century. For Russia, obtaining assurances of Austro-Hungarian neutrality was also a priority.|$|E
40|$|The {{thirty years}} from 1848 to 1878 {{witnessed}} several events which significantly affected {{the history of}} the Habsburg empire. This period saw the Habsburgs deprived of their hegemony in Germany and dispossessed of their Italian provinces. The demonstrable weakness of the Austrian state resulted in a major change in its form of government in 1867, with the result that the Hungarian half of the realm achieved a large voice in determining the country's foreign policy. One result of the Magyars' enhanced influence on foreign policy was the appointment of Count Gyula Andrassy as foreign minister in late 1871. Andrassy brought to office a distinctly Magyar point of view about the Dual Monarchy's proper foreign policy: he was anti-Russian and pro-Turkish, favored the maintenance of the status quo in the Balkans, and was resolved to protect the Dual Monarchy's prestige as a Great Power {{in order to maintain the}} Magyars' privileged position within Austria-Hungary. He regarded Russia as the greatest danger to his countrymen's favorable status. Initially Andrassy sought to combat the Russian menace by forming an alliance with Germany or Great Britain against Russia; however, when he was unable to do that, he chose to cooperate with Russia in an effort to moderate any ambitious schemes which St. Petersburg might envision. Andrassy's tactics succeeded admirably until the Balkan crisis of 1875 - 1878 when the Russians' sympathies for their fellow Slavs put increasing pressure on St. Petersburg to take action in the Balkans. Andrassy was able to retain the initiative in Balkan diplomacy until late 1876. Then, when it became apparent that Russia was on the verge of war against Turkey and that Austria-Hungary would not resort to military actions to prevent that conflict. He negotiated the <b>Budapest</b> <b>Conventions,</b> which safeguarded Austria-Hungary's Balkan interests by limiting Russia's gains in southeastern Europe and by ensuring that the Dual Monarchy acquired Bosnia-Hercegovina. However, at the end of the Russo-Turkish War, St. Petersburg did not honor its pledges to Vienna. The Treaty of San Stefano, imposed by Russia on Turkey, posed a real threat to Austria-Hungary's continued existence as a Great Power since it deprived the Dual Monarchy of Bosnia-Hercegovina and established a large Bulgarian state which would have dominated the Balkans. Andrassy recognized the danger which the Treaty of San Stefano posed to the Dual Monarchy and strove to negate that treaty. Ultimately it was set aside by the Congress of Berlin, and the territorial changes resulting from the Russo-Turkish War were adjusted in a manner favorable to Austria-Hungary. While the Dual Monarchy did make gains as a result of the Congress of Berlin, those advantages cannot be attributed primarily to Andrassy's policy. They were due far more to the facts that British and Austro-Hungarian Balkan interests largely coincided and that Russia retreated before the threat of British military action than to anything done by Andrassy who, because of his country's weakness and irresolution, saw himself forced to play a passive and impotent role by the end of the Balkan crisis...|$|R
2500|$|With an {{interest}} in esoteric spirituality, Colby was a contributor to Stanton's The Woman's Bible (1895). Colby lectured extensively in almost {{every state in the}} U.S. as well as in England, Ireland and Scotland, and also gave lectures at Budapest and other places in Europe. She took part in most of the great suffrage campaigns which were carried on in the different states in the effort to secure the franchise by vote of the electors. She made her home in Oregon for a time, taking part in several of the suffrage campaigns of that state. In 1899, she attended the Great International Council of Women held in London. While there Colby made the acquaintance of many distinguished suffrage workers. She served as a delegate to the International Moral Education Congress (London, 1908) and, in the same year, to the International Women Suffrage Alliance (Amsterdam). From the time of the discontinuance of the Tribune in 1909 until 1912, considerable time was spent in England in helping the English suffragists in their struggle for justice and in making acquaintance with many prominent English reformers. Of her experiences in England she published, from time to time, her accounts in the Washington Herald. Among other writings she prepared a book entitled [...] "The History of London" [...] (unpublished), which was preserved by her sister, Dr. Mary B. White of Palo Alto, California. From 1911 through 1913, she served as a delegate to the International Races Congress (London, 1911); International Woman Suffrage <b>Convention</b> (<b>Budapest,</b> 1913); and the International Peace Conference (The Hague, 1913). During the winters of 1913-15, Colby lectured in Washington on topics such as: ...|$|R
5000|$|Ottoman {{brutality}} in the Serbian-Ottoman War and {{the violent}} {{suppression of the}} Herzegovina Uprising fomented political pressure within Russia, which saw itself as the protector of the Serbs, to act against the Ottoman Empire. MacKenzie says, [...] "sympathy for the Serbian Christians existed in Court circles, among nationalist diplomats, and in the lower classes, and was actively expressed through the Slav committees." [...] Eventually Russia sought and obtained Austria-Hungary's pledge of benevolent neutrality in the coming war in return for ceding Bosnia Herzegovina to Austria-Hungary in the <b>Budapest</b> <b>Convention</b> of 1877.|$|E
50|$|The {{negotiations}} {{took place}} in a private and almost informal setting. It is significant that the results of the meeting were not written down, so that the Austrian and Russian view of what was agreed on differed significantly. There was neither a signed formal convention nor even a signed protocol. The minutes were dictated separately by both Andrassy and by Gorchakov suggesting that neither side really trusted the other side. The extent of agreed Austrian annexation in Bosnia and Herzegovina has remained controversial. It was these inconsistencies that necessitated further discussions at the Constantinople Conference and the subsequent <b>Budapest</b> <b>Convention,</b> though these largely confirmed or amended the Reichstadt discussions.|$|E
50|$|Turkey's {{rejection}} {{of the terms of}} the Constantinople Conference (1876-1877) led to the Russo-Turkish War of 1877-1878. This concluded with the Treaty of San Stefano and the subsequent Treaty of Berlin in 1878 which established an independent Bulgarian principality. The original treaty signed by Russia and Turkey at San Stefano created a greater pro-Russian Bulgaria out of the defeated Ottoman lands. This appeared to contravene earlier secret Russian undertakings both in Reichstadt on July 8, 1876 and later in Budapest between Count Andrassy and the Russian Envoy, Eugene Novikov, (<b>Budapest</b> <b>Convention,</b> 15 January, 18 March 1877). These treaties agreed that in the eventuality of war and a Russian victory that they would not create any large Slavic states. Russia had also traded Austrian neutrality for Bosnia-Herzegovina.|$|E
50|$|The Messaging Anti-Abuse Working Group (MAAWG) and the London Action Plan (LAP) {{were both}} {{mentioned}} as strong multistakeholder global initiatives {{that are working}} actively on prevention measures for harmful activities on the web. The <b>Budapest</b> <b>Convention</b> on Cyber-Crime was also {{said to be a}} strong starting point and groundwork for international cooperation efforts. The IETF is heavily involved in work related to securing networks and in implementing the proper infrastructure. Computer Emergency Response Teams (CERTs) on the national level have been very helpful in both prevention efforts and in mitigating the effects of harmful attacks after the fact. Many emphasized the need {{to strike a balance between}} keeping the Internet both open and secure. Efforts to secure networks should not stifle innovation by fragmenting network flows of information.|$|E
50|$|Security, openness, and privacy: This session looked at: (i) {{issues related}} to social media, (ii) the nature and {{characteristics}} of Internet networks, technologies, and standards, and (iii) international cooperation and collaboration on security, privacy and openness. The point was made by many speakers that new actors had entered the media system so that the traditional means of regulating the media were no longer applicable. Media now included search engines {{as well as social}} networks. However, a representative from a social network company said {{it was a mistake to}} think the Internet was an unregulated space, when many laws and regulations existed. Online companies had to respect and work with regulators and different authorities on a daily basis. A UNESCO commission report on policy approaches that shaped freedom of expression on the Internet had found that with increased access to information in cyberspace, censorship and filtering was done not only by government, but also by private companies. The <b>Budapest</b> <b>Convention</b> was mentioned as one of the tools that addressed cybercrime standards and norms. It had the force of law and could potentially be applied worldwide and had been drafted with the participation of non-European countries. In closing the paramount importance of making the Internet safe for children and youngsters was noted.|$|E

Attention is focused primarily on the impact on computer investigation and the acquisition of evidence in criminal proceedings. The article also analyzes some relevant Italian Court decisions, {{in which we can}} find an uncertain and fluctuating trend as regards elements and principles of computer forensics. Although the Italian law has now implemented several articles of the Criminal Procedure Code, the principles of computer forensics, {{it will be necessary to}} verify how these principles will be implemented in practice...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} study we have {{analyzed}} {{one of the most}} important, {{but at the same time}} conflicting, the carrier’s obligations arise under the contract of carriage, that is the compliance of the itinerary while traveling goods to their destination, safely without delay. Using content analysis, through a descriptive documentary research and jurisprudence analysis, this study aims at identifying both the content of the obligation of complying the itinerary established in the contract or the usages that derive from, and particular aspects of this obligation which modifies the original terms of the carriage contract. Also, the paper discusses the texts of the New Civil Code and the <b>Budapest</b> <b>Convention</b> on the carriage contract on inland waterways. To what extent the carrier is entitled to invoke the exemption causes of liability? What are these causes? The paper is in the interest of legal practitioners that confront with the compliance issue of the carrier’s obligations and attracting the liability of the carrier for all damages of the goods, during and after the route deviation from the itinerary in given situation...|$|E
40|$|The {{title of}} this thesis is Espionage Delinquency Committed by Diplomatic Agent (Case Study of Illegal Interception Committed by Australia Ambassador towards Officials Government of Indonesia). The legal issue of this thesis {{is the fact that}} {{diplomatic}} agent often involves criminal offences in the receiving state; one of them is espionage act. Then the purpose of this thesis is to find out the legal consequences of espionage delinquency committed by diplomatic agent related to the case of Illegal Interception Committed by Australia Ambassador towards Officials Government of Indonesia. The method of this research is literature research. Automatically, the kind of this research is normative law research which is a research focused on positive law norms. The positive law norms include Vienna Convention 1961, Vienna Convention 1969, Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts Convention, <b>Budapest</b> <b>Convention</b> 2001 on Cybercrime, bilateral agreement between Republic of Indonesia and Australia on The Framework for Security Cooperation and other regulations which related to the research object. In addition to positive law norms, this research also uses other resources as supporting data. It is obtained from the result of interview with resource person, books, article on journals and newspaper. Based on the Vienna Convention 1961 Article 3 and Article 41 verses (1) and (3), the agent diplomatic has basic obligations to perform his function in receiving state. These basic obligations are not to interfere {{in the internal affairs of}} receiving state and to respect the laws and regulations of the receiving State. If the agent diplomatic involves espionage act, it indicates that the agent diplomatic has violated the provisions of Vienna Convention 1961 Article 3 and Article 41 verses (1) and (3). In the case of Indonesia and Australia, the illegal interception which committed by the Australia Ambassador has violated the provisions of Agreement between The Republic of Indonesia and Australia on The Framework for Security Cooperation Article 2 verse (2). Certainly, these violation have some legal consequences because the injured state, in this case is Republic of Indonesia, will take some measures to ensure reparation and cessation of espionage act. The result of this research are the receiving state can declare persona non grata to diplomatic agent who committing espionage act, but in certain case, the receiving state can request the sending state to waive the immunity and inviolability of diplomatic agent. In the case of Indonesia and Australia, the Indonesia government takes some responses, these are: sending protest note to Australia ambassador, recalling Indonesia ambassador in Canberra and reviewing bilateral treaty and cooperation between Indonesia and Australia, which it can be qualified as countermeasure...|$|E
