5|$|Scientists {{are unsure}} {{of the purpose of}} whale songs. Only males sing, {{suggesting}} one purpose is to attract females. However, many of the whales observed to approach a singer are other males, often resulting in conflict. Singing may, therefore, <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>challenge</b> to other males. Some scientists have hypothesized the song may serve an echolocative function. During the feeding season, humpbacks make unrelated vocalizations for herding fish into their bubble nets.|$|E
5|$|Acid2 {{was first}} {{proposed}} by Håkon Wium Lie, {{chief technical officer}} of Opera Software and creator of the widely used Cascading Style Sheets web standard. In a 16 March 2005 article on CNET, Lie expressed dismay that Microsoft Internet Explorer did not properly support web standards and hence was not completely interoperable with other browsers. He announced that Acid2 would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>challenge</b> to Microsoft to design Internet Explorer 7, then in development, to achieve {{a greater degree of}} standards compliance than previous versions of Internet Explorer. The original Acid1 test had forced browser makers to fix their applications or face embarrassment; Lie hoped that Acid2 would do the same.|$|E
5|$|Coastal {{scenes were}} filmed at Bass Rock and near Trancas, while other scenes were filmed near Signal Hill. The film's climax was filmed {{around the area}} of the Union Station train depot. The large gas tank, which stood over 300 feet tall, was made {{available}} to the cast and crew by the Southern California Gas Company. Filming at this location proved to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>challenge,</b> as the cast and crew had trouble communicating with each other, with Clarke attempting to direct the film crew while on top of the large structure.|$|E

5|$|Development of Virtue's Last Reward {{began on}} the Nintendo DS, but this changed early in {{production}} following {{the announcement of the}} Nintendo 3DS and PlayStation Vita. The development team at Chunsoft wanted to utilize the three-dimensional (3D) features of the newer systems, and changed production of the game to the Nintendo 3DS and PlayStation Vita. As neither system had been released yet, the team was under the assumption that the 3D features would require 3D character models. Uchikoshi later remarked that designing 3D character models proved to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>challenge</b> for Chunsoft due to company's inexperience with 3D effects.|$|E
5|$|In the 1970s, {{politicians}} on {{both sides}} of the river began to seek funding to build a new road bridge across the river. The rail bridge, while still adequate for rail traffic, it proved to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>challenge</b> for drivers. The western terminus of the bridge featured a curve which was navigated easily by wagons and early automobiles, but was dangerous for semi trucks. Governor Terry Branstad was convinced a new bridge was needed after riding in a railcar to view the underside of the road deck. The new, four-lane Keokuk–Hamilton bridge opened on November 23, 1985, nearly eight months ahead of schedule and under budget.|$|E
5|$|The farther forward (closer {{to front}} wheel) {{the center of}} mass of the {{combined}} bike and rider, the less the front wheel has to move laterally {{in order to maintain}} balance. Conversely, the farther back (closer to the rear wheel) the center of mass is located, the more front wheel lateral movement or bike forward motion is required to regain balance. This can be noticeable on long-wheelbase recumbents, choppers, and wheelie bikes. It can also <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>challenge</b> for touring bikes that carry a heavy load of gear over or even behind the rear wheel. Mass over the rear wheel can be more easily controlled if it is lower than mass over the front wheel.|$|E

5|$|The {{zoning plan}} for the station was passed in 1998 and demands for {{accessibility}} were laid down in 2003, causing a contrast between these goals and the curved platforms. This would particularly <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>challenge</b> for the Class 70 trains, which would have a wide gap. Part of the dispute centered on the Vollsveien Bridge, {{whether or not it}} had a heritage status and whether or not its demolition would allow for a straight station. Minister of Transport and Communication Torild Skogsholm stated that she laid the blame on director of the National Rail Administration, Steinar Killi. Her successor, Liv Signe Navarsete, announced in July 2006 that the construction would continue following the curved design, though minor functional changes would be made.|$|E
