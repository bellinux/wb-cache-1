5|$|Food {{preservation}} methods were {{basically the same}} as had been used since antiquity, and did not change much until the invention of canning in the early 19th century. The most common and simplest method was to expose foodstuffs to heat or wind to remove moisture, thereby prolonging the durability if not the flavor of almost any type of food from cereals to meats; the drying of food worked by drastically reducing the activity of various water-dependent microorganisms that cause decay. In warm climates this was mostly achieved by leaving food out in the sun, and in the cooler northern climates by exposure to strong winds (especially common for the preparation of stockfish), or in warm ovens, cellars, attics, and at times even in living quarters. Subjecting food {{to a number of}} chemical processes such as smoking, salting, <b>brining,</b> conserving or fermenting also made it keep longer. Most of these methods had the advantage of shorter preparation times and of introducing new flavors. Smoking or salting meat of livestock butchered in autumn was a common household strategy to avoid having to feed more animals than necessary during the lean winter months. Butter tended to be heavily salted (5–10%) in order not to spoil. Vegetables, eggs or fish were also often pickled in tightly packed jars, containing brine and acidic liquids (lemon juice, verjuice or vinegar). Another method was to seal the food by cooking it in sugar or honey or fat, in which it was then stored. Microbial modification was also encouraged, however, by a number of methods; grains, fruit and grapes were turned into alcoholic drinks thus killing any pathogens, and milk was fermented and curdled into a multitude of cheeses or buttermilk.|$|E
25|$|Turkeys {{are usually}} baked or roasted in an oven for several hours, often while the cook prepares the {{remainder}} of the meal. Sometimes, a turkey is brined before roasting to enhance flavor and moisture content. This is necessary because the dark meat requires a higher temperature to denature all of the myoglobin pigment than the white meat (which is very low in myoglobin), so that fully cooking the dark meat tends to dry out the breast. <b>Brining</b> makes it possible to fully cook the dark meat without drying the breast meat. Turkeys are sometimes decorated with turkey frills prior to serving.|$|E
25|$|The most {{frequently}} used meat is pork, followed by beef, lamb, chicken, rabbit, duck and goose; for immediate consumption it is often grilled, or dusted with breadcrumbs and sauteed, in a dish similar to schnitzel. For bigger gatherings, oven roasts are prepared. The need for meat preservation no longer presents the urgency that it did during the Soviet occupation or previous times of trouble, but many favorite techniques survive, include <b>brining,</b> salting, drying and smoking. There are many varieties of smoked pork, including ham and a soft sausage with a large-grained filling; these are served as a main course or thinly sliced in sandwiches.|$|E

Recovery was higher with the calcium <b>brine</b> when the connate and injected <b>brines</b> were identical. The highest recovery {{was achieved by}} initially saturating the core with calcium <b>brine,</b> injecting Na <b>brine</b> until residual oil saturation was achieved, then injecting calcium <b>brine.</b> Tang and Morrow (1997) investigated the effects of connate and injection <b>brine</b> salinity, aging time and temperature on water flooding and imbibition with 3 different crude oils and 3 different <b>brines.</b> They concluded that in water floods with constant connate <b>brine</b> salinity and variable injected <b>brine</b> salinity, diluting injected <b>brine</b> 100 times produced ~ 5  % incremental oil recovery. In water floods with variable connate <b>brine</b> salinity and constant injected <b>brine</b> salinity, decreasing connate <b>brine</b> salinity dramatically improved recovery—about 40  % incremental oil recovery was achieved by diluted the connate <b>brine</b> 100 times.|$|R
40|$|The {{technological}} process of smoked mackerel (Scomber scombrus) manufacture {{was described in}} detail {{with a focus on}} quality of muscle. The smoked mackerel <b>brined</b> in 6 %, 12 % and 15 % of <b>brine</b> was monitored by texture profile analysis (TPA) using a cylindrical probe P 75 and spherical probe P 1 S. Textural properties of muscle, such as hardness, cohesiveness, springiness and chewiness were evaluated. With increasing concentrations of <b>brine</b> muscle hardness and chewiness significantly decreases. In texture measuring, using a cylindrical probe P 75, in 6 % of <b>brine</b> approximately 10. 4 % higher hardness can be achieved, about 1 % higher chewiness and about approximately 5 % lower springiness expect, than when <b>brined</b> in 12 % of <b>brine.</b> When <b>brined</b> in 15 % of <b>brine</b> about 6. 7 % lower hardness, about approximately 11. 2 % lower chewiness and about 6. 5 % lower springiness expect, than when <b>brined</b> in 12 % of <b>brine.</b> When using a spherical probe P 1 S is at <b>brined</b> in 6 % of <b>brine</b> about approximately 6. 5 % higher hardness and about approximately 11 % lower chewiness that <b>brined</b> in 12 % of <b>brine.</b> When <b>brined</b> in 15 % of <b>brine</b> about approximately 13 % lower springiness and approximately 21. 7 % lower chewiness expect, than when <b>brined</b> in 12 % of <b>brine.</b> To a lesser extent springiness was influenced, cohesiveness with increasing concentrations of salt in <b>brine</b> was unchanged. Texture measurements were supplemented by microbiological analysis of the total count of microorganisms (TCM). This analysis confirmed that with increasing concentrations of salt <b>brine</b> the count of microorganisms decreases (on 103 using 6 % of <b>brine</b> and on 102 using 12 % and 15 % of <b>brine)</b> as a result of reduced water activity (aw) ...|$|R
30|$|The {{derivative}} of oil recovery versus injection <b>brine</b> salinity is also plotted in Fig.  15. The maximum slope of oil recovery curve {{happens in a}} specific value of injection <b>brine</b> salinity for various <b>brine</b> salinity threshold ranges. For model# 1, model# 2, and model# 3, this point appears at the injection <b>brine</b> salinity equal to 3400  ppm, 5000  ppm, and 1200  ppm, respectively. This figure also shows that the narrow <b>brine</b> salinity threshold range is less sensitive to injection <b>brine</b> salinity compared to a wide <b>brine</b> salinity threshold range. Therefore, both the <b>brine</b> salinity range and the injection <b>brine</b> salinity have important effects on LSW flooding performance.|$|R

After a day or two, the buckle is released and a plastic belt imprinted numerous times with the Parmigiano-Reggiano name, the plant's number, and month and year of production is put around the cheese and the metal form is buckled tight again. The imprints take hold on the rind of the cheese in about a day and the wheel is then put into a brine bath to absorb salt for 20–25 days. After <b>brining,</b> the wheels are then transferred to the aging rooms in the plant for 12 months. Each cheese is placed on wooden shelves that can be 24 cheeses high by 90 cheeses long or 2160 total wheels per aisle. Each cheese and the shelf underneath it is then cleaned manually or robotically every seven days. The cheese is also turned at this time.|$|E

40|$|<b>Brine</b> {{discharge}} {{is one of}} {{the largest}} sources of wastewater from industrial processes. Because of the environmental impacts arising from improper treatment of <b>brine</b> discharge and more rigorous regulations of pollution control, industries have started to focus on waste minimization and improving the process of wastewater treatment. Several approaches have been proposed to provide a strategy for <b>brine</b> handling by recovering both <b>brine</b> and water or to remove pollutant components so it complies with environmental regulations when discharged. One of the most promising alternatives to <b>brine</b> disposal is reusing the <b>brine,</b> which results in reduction of pollution, minimizing waste volume and salt recovery. The <b>brine</b> may also contain valuable components that could be recovered for profitable use. Also, water recovery from <b>brine</b> effluent is generally performed to save water. In the case of rejected <b>brine</b> from desalination plants, water recovery from higher <b>brine</b> concentrations has huge potential for salt production. This paper gives an overview of different types of <b>brine</b> effluents, their sources and characteristics.

50|$|<b>Brine</b> pools {{are large}} areas of <b>brine</b> on the seabed. These pools are bodies of water that have a {{salinity}} that is {{three to five times}} greater than that of the surrounding ocean. For deep sea <b>brine</b> pools the source of the salt is the dissolution of large salt deposits through salt tectonics. The <b>brine</b> often contains high concentrations of methane, providing energy to chemosynthetic extremophiles that live in this specialized biome. <b>Brine</b> pools are also known to exist on the Antarctic continental shelf where the source of <b>brine</b> is salt excluded during formation of sea ice. Deep sea and Antarctic <b>brine</b> pools can be toxic to marine animals. <b>Brine</b> pools are sometimes called seafloor lakes because the dense <b>brine</b> creates a halocline which does not easily mix with overlying seawater. The high salinity raises the density of the <b>brine,</b> which creates a distinct surface and shoreline for the pool.|$|R
