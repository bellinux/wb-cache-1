500|$|In June 2011, Beatty {{confirmed}} {{his intention to}} make a sequel to Dick Tracy, {{but he refused to}} discuss details. He said: [...] "I'm gonna make another one [...] I think it's dumb talking about movies <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> them. I just don't do it. It gives you the perfect excuse to avoid making them." [...] When asked when the sequel would get made, he replied: [...] "I take so long to get around to making a movie that I don’t know when it starts." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 13 August 2010, Bardot {{lashed out}} at {{director}} Kyle Newman regarding his plan to make a biographical film on her life. She told him, [...] "Wait until I'm dead <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> a movie about my life!" [...] otherwise [...] "sparks will fly".|$|E
60|$|MRS HUSHABYE. To-morrow morning, dear, <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> up. I {{hate the}} smell of powder.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't think you'd {{better take}} the time. It's a long, hard ride {{from here to}} the station. It will be deep night <b>before</b> <b>you</b> can <b>make</b> it--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, you see, Pony," [...] said Jim Leonard, [...] "what a {{good thing}} it was that I thought about {{provisioning}} <b>you</b> <b>before</b> <b>you</b> started. What <b>makes</b> <b>you</b> look so?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, but don't {{you think}} you had better speak to him <b>before</b> <b>you</b> quite <b>make</b> up your mind? He is your son, you know; and an {{uncommon}} clever fellow too. He'll {{know how to say}} all this much better than I do." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 2. You are {{expected}} to have obtained and read [...] "Orders and Regulations for Field Officers" [...] <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> this application.|$|E
6000|$|... 'That's {{what you}} said before. You'd better enquire a bit <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> rash statements. Otherwise, there's no knowing what may happen. Perhaps Mr Dacre has given me leave.' ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{other man}} also laughed. [...] "You ride {{straight}} home, Harry, <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> it worse," [...] said he. [...] "One might figure that you'd mixed things up enough already." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There are {{not many}} things I'm good at--that is, useful ones," [...] he said. [...] "You {{have to be able}} to talk sensibly, anyway, <b>before</b> <b>you</b> can <b>make</b> your mark at politics, and some of them don't do it under twenty years." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{dare say}} that is quite right. I know it is like your father, and indeed I shall be quite content however you decide. Only might it not be well {{to see how it}} strikes John, <b>before</b> <b>you</b> {{absolutely}} <b>make</b> it over to him?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not at all, not at all," [...] said Oldbuck, {{resuming}} {{the subject}} of his disquisition--"the human mind is to be treated like a skein of ravelled silk, where you must cautiously secure one free end <b>before</b> <b>you</b> can <b>make</b> any progress in disentangling it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, at least, <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> up your mind, Monsieur de Laval,' said she, 'I should {{certainly}} {{take a look}} at this lady-in-waiting of mine, whom you refuse with such indignation.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Doctor," [...] {{interrupted}} Miss Dora, {{raising her}} forefinger, [...] "you were {{just on the}} point of saying, 'and has shed its milk mind.' Now I am going away <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> me angry again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Looks {{like good}} organization,” Clay remarked. “It’s useful {{to know what}} you mean to do <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> a start. Have the boys tried to run off those who are working at the outside mills?” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{think that}} I need not detain you any longer, citizen, St. Just," [...] he said quietly; [...] "you can get {{three or four}} hours' rest yet <b>before</b> <b>you</b> need <b>make</b> a start, and I still have a great many things to see to. I wish you good-night, citizen." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't understand. The {{only thing}} I {{see is that}} you're not logical. It's obvious now that you must, if possible, find the ore; and yet you object to letting me help. If you give up the search and return to Toronto, {{it may be a}} very long time <b>before</b> <b>you</b> can <b>make</b> another trip." ...|$|R
50|$|Report {{any damage}} to whoever {{maintains}} the bothy. Take out all rubbish which you can't burn. Avoid burying rubbish; this pollutes the environment. Please {{do not leave}} perishable food as this attracts vermin. Guard against fire risk and ensure the fire is out <b>before</b> <b>you</b> leave. <b>Make</b> sure {{the doors and windows}} are properly closed when you leave.|$|R
6000|$|... "You're wrong, Ballindine," [...] {{said the}} Parson; [...] "for you'll drive him {{up into the}} big plantation, and you'll be all day <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> him break; and ten to one they'll chop him in the cover." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Are {{you going}} to call me down?" [...] he roared. [...] "Mean to teach me my job? If this crowd's a sample of white men, give me Chinamen or niggers! Get on <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> me sick, you slouching hogs!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Young man," [...] said Molloy, sternly, [...] "if {{it takes}} the death of dozens o' stout kind-hearted men to force you to make up half your mind, how many d'ee want to die <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> up the whole of it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Through straits {{of storm}} and peril, Through firths unsailed <b>before,</b> Why <b>make</b> <b>you</b> for the sterile, The dark Kimmerian shore? ...|$|R
60|$|FAITH. 1. I say, then, {{in answer}} to what Mr. Envy hath spoken, I never said aught but this, That what rule, or laws, or custom, or people, were flat against the Word of God, are {{diametrically}} opposite to Christianity. If I have said amiss in this, convince me of my error, and I am ready here <b>before</b> <b>you</b> to <b>make</b> my recantation.|$|R
6000|$|... "I will go <b>before</b> <b>thee,</b> and <b>make</b> {{the crooked}} places straight; I will break in pieces {{the gates of}} brass, and cut in sunder the bars of iron; and I will give thee the treasures of darkness, and hidden riches of secret places, that thou mayest know that I the Lord, which call thee by thy name, am the God of Israel.|$|R
6000|$|... "Listen to me first, <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> up your mind. If {{you took}} this step, {{of course you}} would do so with the fixed {{intention}} of paying the money yourself,--without any further reliance on Sowerby or on any one else." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Two of {{you go for}} Captain Esmond, boys," [...] he said. [...] "It will be {{some time}} <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> the outpost, and I want the rest of you. There is {{something}} we have to do in the meanwhile. The police make mistakes now and then, and it is, I think, our business as well as Captain Esmond's." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So {{you don't}} {{want to marry}} this Miles {{because he is not}} handsome. You'd better think again <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> up your mind. He is respectable, well off, and fond of you, it seems. Why not try it, Kitty? You need some one {{to take care of you}} sadly," [...] David said, when her story had been told.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, never," [...] Elma cried, {{rising from}} her seat and moving towards the door in an agony of shame. [...] "I couldn't. I daren't. It would be wrong. It would be cruel. But, mother, don't speak to me of it. Don't mention it again. Even <b>before</b> <b>you</b> it <b>makes</b> me more wretched and ashamed than I can say to allude to it." ...|$|R
5000|$|Shen Wei {{has stated}} that his number one goal when making art is [...] "inspire other human beings". He has proclaimed, [...] "When you're an artist and you're {{creating}} new works {{you have to have}} passion because <b>you</b> want to <b>make</b> it the best that you can. <b>You</b> want to <b>make</b> it as clear as you can and you want to do things you've never done <b>before.</b> <b>You</b> want to <b>make</b> things that have never existed <b>before,</b> <b>you</b> want to <b>make</b> new things; <b>you</b> don't want to repeat yourself. At the same time you want people to feel these things are new, make them communicate, become part of the culture and to inspire other human beings - this is my number one goal when I make new work. That's the pressure." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Pray, sir, <b>before</b> <b>you</b> fully <b>make</b> up your mind, had you {{not better}} look round {{the rest of}} my family?' says Madam. 'Dinah is a fine tall girl, and not very black; Cleopatra is promised to Ajax the blacksmith, to be sure; but then we could break the marriage, you know. If with an apothecary, why not with a blacksmith? Martha's husband has run away, and----' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Hear, hear!" [...] shouted Dick Barnes--a {{man with}} a huge black beard, who the reader may perhaps {{remember}} {{was the first to}} [...] "raise the oil." [...] "It'll be long <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> another joke like that, Gurney. Come, now, give us a song, Gurney, do; there's the cap'n's darter standin' by the foremast, a-waitin' to hear ye. Give us `Long, long ago.'" ...|$|E
6000|$|BROADBENT [irrepressible]. Never fear. You're all {{descended from}} the ancient kings: I know that. [Complacently] I'm not so tactless as you think, my boy. [Earnest again] I expect to find Miss Reilly a perfect lady; and I {{strongly}} advise you to come and have another look at her <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> up your mind about her. By the way, have you a photograph of her? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Pray do {{not think}} that I am here to receive your decision, even if it be already made. I only came to inform you that your stepmother, Mrs. Starbottle, will be in town to-morrow, and will pass a few days at the hotel. If it is your wish to see her <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> up your mind, she will be glad to meet you. She does not, however, wish to do any thing to {{influence}} your judgment." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'There's {{some chance}} yet {{of running a}} {{temporary}} dam across that water. Shove in anything--tubs and bullock-carts if you haven't enough bricks. Make them work now if they never worked <b>before.</b> Hi! <b>you</b> gangers, <b>make</b> them work.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'To {{fall back}} on, indeed! and down on, too. At all events, you rich {{might help to}} make Christians of them, and men of them. For I'm {{beginning}} to fancy strangely, {{in spite of all}} the preachers say, that, <b>before</b> ever <b>you</b> can <b>make</b> them Christians, <b>you</b> must <b>make</b> them men and women.' ...|$|R
40|$|It is very {{important}} to have an assistant help collect the sample {{to reduce the risk of}} crosscontamination. <b>Before</b> <b>you</b> begin, <b>make</b> sure that <b>you</b> identify who will sample the surface and who will assist. The assistant will handle all of the sampling supplies and never touch the surface to be sampled. The sampler will touch the supplies only as the assistant hands them over.
