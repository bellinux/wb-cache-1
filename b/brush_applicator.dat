5000|$|In the 1990s, new {{polymers}} began literally encapsulating (crystallizing) {{soil particles}} into dry residues on contact, {{in a process}} now regarded by the industry as a growing, up-and-coming technology; working like [...] "tiny sponges", the deep-cleaning compound crystals dissolve and absorb dirt prior to its removal from the carpet. Cleaning solution is applied by rotary machine, [...] "CRB" [...] counter rotating brush, <b>brush</b> <b>applicator,</b> or compression sprayer. Dry residue is vacuumable immediately, either separately or from a built-in unit of the cleaning system machine. According to ICS Cleaning Specialist, evidence suggests encapsulation improves carpet appearance, compared to other systems; and it is favorable in terms of high-traffic needs, operator training, equipment expense, and lack of wet residue. Encapsulation carpet cleaning also keeps carpets cleaner {{for longer periods of}} time compared to other methods. [...] Encapsulation also avoids the drying time of carpet shampoos, making the carpet immediately available for use.|$|E
5000|$|In the 1990s, new {{polymers}} began literally encapsulating (crystallizing) {{soil particles}} into dry residues on contact. In the conventional cleaning process surfactant molecules attach themselves to oily soil particles, suspending them (emulsification) {{so that they}} can be easily rinsed away. Surfactant (detergent) molecules and emulsified soils which escape being rinsed away, remain in the fibre and continue to attract soiling, causing the condition of the carpet to degenerate; often re-soiling faster than before it was subjected to the cleaning process. Encapsulators are speciality detergent polymers which become part of the detergent system. As drying occurs (20-30 min. drytime), after cleaning, these encapsulators bind the detergent molecules and residual soils in a brittle, crystalline structure. Detergent and soil particles can no longer attract other soils and are easily removed by dry vacuuming. In addition to binding the detergent and soil residues the encapsulation chemistry coats the clean fibre with the same brittle film. This reduces the fibre’s affinity for oily and particulate soils. As this brittle film"breaks away" [...] and more soil is removed, the appearance of the fibre improves as opposed to soiling more rapidly. Products which also employ fluorochemical technology, display dramatically extended anti re-soiling time periods.Cleaning solution is applied by rotary machine, <b>brush</b> <b>applicator,</b> or compression sprayer.

Ink is normally applied to the left hand index finger, especially to the cuticle where {{it is almost impossible}} to remove quickly. Ink may be applied in a variety of ways, depending on circumstance and preference. The most common methods are via dipping bottles with sponge inserts, bottles with a <b>brush</b> <b>applicators,</b> spray bottles, and marker pens. With all methods the finger should be left to dry for 15-30 seconds and exposed to light before being cleaned to ensure the mark remains visible for the desired length of time.|$|R

The suspensions were applied with a <b>brush</b> or film <b>applicator</b> on a vacuum panel (mobile vacuum panel RSP 1 with plastic sintered plates (hydrophilic, PE), GMW, Germany). Subsequently, the samples were dried in a dry stack for at least 12  h and used for further analysis.|$|R
40|$|In our {{everyday}} lives we come into intimate contact with surfaces covered with bacteria (i. e. doorknobs, desktops, children’s toys, etc.). Attachment of a polycationic species with proven bacteriocidal activity onto the target surface may render it antiseptic and therefore unable to transmit bacterial infections. Prior endeavors in our laboratory have been directed toward the preparation of antibacterial/antifungal porous surfaces (i. e. cotton cloth, wood, cork, silk and wool). These {{have resulted in the}} discovery and development of a general methodology for the synthesis of porous carbohydrate and protein-based surfaces that exhibit antibacterial and antifungal characteristics which are permanent (i. e. are not removed from the surface by physical means such as washing) and are continuing in their action (i. e. are not consumed by their action against bacteria and/or fungi). In the current proposal we continue to develop this technology toward applications such as wound dressings focusing on maximization of its action and toward control of a variety of organisms. Our work, in collaboration with Johnson 2 ̆ 6 Johnson Wound Management Division, initially involved the modification of alginate wound dressings. During the course of the work we have since geared our efforts to the synthesis of a new type of antibacterial/antifungal surface based on chitosan. The newly synthesized material has been tested (in collaboration with a biologist, Dr. Karin Melkonian, LIU, C. W. Post) and it has proven to kill fungi and bacteria on contact. We continue our efforts towards developing this new chitosan material into a smooth surface so that it may be used as a wound dressing. This project has involved synthetic work as well as molecular identification and characterization techniques. Collaborative efforts {{play a major role in}} our new technology. Our organic team works with a biological team and a variety of private companies that are interested in using our technology. To date, we have licensed out a part of our technology for the use of fabrics (woven and non woven) and are working on yet another agreement with a cosmetic applicator company on manufacturing antibacterial/antifungal <b>brushes,</b> <b>applicators,</b> and wigs. We are continuing our work towards the production of antimicrobial wound dressings. It is our hope that our technology may aid a variety of people in a variety of ways...|$|R

A wide array of detailing products and techniques is used, based on the vehicle's surface type and condition, or the detailer's preference. Products include, but are not limited to: detergents and acid free degreasers (to break down dirt and soil), detail clay (to remove embedded contaminates), waxes and polishes (to resurface and then improve reflectivity), as well as a variety of <b>applicators,</b> <b>brushes,</b> and drying towels.|$|R
5000|$|Foil {{highlighting}} is {{the process}} of using foil to separate strands of hair which will be lightened from strands of hair which will remain its natural color. The process is done by applying lightener to the hair that has been woven and separated using an <b>applicator</b> <b>brush.</b> The foil is then folded to protect the hair and surrounding area during the [...] "processing" [...] time. This is the amount of time required to achieve the desired results. In highlighting hair, hydrogen peroxide mixed with pigment is used to change the color of the strand. This process is also used in applying [...] "lowlights" [...] to the hair. In this process, hair dyes are used to create strands of hair that are darker than the natural color.|$|R

40|$|Knapsack {{sprayers}} are {{the most}} commonly used equipment for pesticide application to crops in developing countries. Applicators usually spray the area ahead of themselves, which means that they then wale into the spray mist and treated foliage. Dr Awadhwal, a project engineer with IRRI has now developed low-cost attachments for knapsack sprayers which minimize operator exposure to pesticides. The devices he has developed include a closed chemical transfer system, a spinning brush very low volume (VLV) pesticide applicator, and a rear-mounted mini-boom. The closed chemical transfer system minimizes operator contact with pesticides, reducing hand contamination to 20 - 40 % of that of the usual transfer methods. Handling frequency is also reduced. The spinning <b>brush</b> VLV pesticide <b>applicator</b> and rear-mounted mini-boom both reduce pesticide exposure by keeping the spray behind the operator. All devices are lightweight and cost between US$ 10 and $ 20.

40|$|Synopsis [...] A PRESSED POWDER is {{essentially}} a dry powder compressed in cake form {{to be applied to}} the body, face, or eyes with a puff, <b>brush,</b> or foam <b>applicator.</b> The parameters of RAW MATERIAL SELECTION and their uses in pressed powders are studied, and prop-erties imparted to the face and eyes are briefly indicated. Representative FORMULATIONS, and MANUFACTURING and PRESSING TECHNIQUES encompassing modern compact face powder, blusher. eyeliner, eyebrow, eyeshadow, and rouge are detailed. This paper briefly covers quality control, equipment requirements, manufacturing problems, fashions, and trends in pressed powder developments. INTROI) UCTION It was not until after World War I that the first pressed powder appeared on the market. The compact was a sixnple face powder molded into a pressed form by the addition of about 20 % of plaster of Paris. The resultant product was very rough in texture and difficult to use. It required a lot of rubbing in order to remove sufficient powder for application (1, 2). Later improvements included the use of various gum binding agents. Most compacts, however, turned out either too hard or too soft. The next major advance in pressed powder technology occurred in the early 1930 's when a facsimile of modern compact powder was prepared using petrolatum, ammonia, starch, and stearic acid as the binding agents (3). The first patents for cake make-up (4 - 6) wer...|$|R
