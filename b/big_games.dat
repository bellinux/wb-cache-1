5|$|During {{his time}} as an All-Star, McGrady was {{frequently}} criticized for not having led any team beyond {{the first round of}} the playoffs. Some analysts have defended McGrady, feeling that he was the victim of bad rosters and unfortunate circumstances. His effort level, leadership, and toughness were also questioned at times. In response to these criticisms, former Rockets coach Jeff Van Gundy described McGrady as a poor practice player but praised his coachability, unselfishness, and ability to perform well in <b>big</b> <b>games.</b>|$|E

5|$|During {{the early}} 1950s, Richards {{preferred}} to arrange his rotation so that Pierce started only every fifth or sixth day, holding him back against weaker teams but using him more often for <b>big</b> <b>games</b> against the powerful Yankees and Indians. Catcher Sherm Lollar later observed that {{although it was}} essentially a compliment to Pierce's ability, he might have picked up more victories and won 20 games sooner in his career had he faced each opponent more equally. With a 1–0 two-hitter at Washington on August 3, in which the White Sox won on an unearned run {{in the ninth inning}} with a hit batter, error and sacrifice fly, Pierce began a streak of 39⅔ consecutive scoreless innings – the longest such streak in the AL between 1926, when Ted Lyons had a 41-inning streak for the White Sox, and 1968; it remains the fifth longest ever by a left-hander, and the longest by an AL southpaw since 1905. The streak ended when he allowed two unearned runs against the Browns in the sixth inning on August 19; two additional earned runs in the tenth inning ended his streak, dating to July 29, of 49⅔ innings without an earned run, and gave him a 4–3 loss. He led the league in strikeouts (186) and was second in ERA (2.72), and on September 27 started for the White Sox in the final game in Browns history, winning 2–1 in 11 innings at St. Louis. His seven shutouts that season were the second most by an AL left-hander since 1916, matched only by Hal Newhouser's 1945 total of eight.|$|E

25|$|In {{addressing}} {{the future of}} the medium, many researchers have argued for the improvement of the gaming industry to appeal to a more general gender-neutral audience and others have suggested that the appeal should be directed to females in particular. One of the earliest attempts to broaden the market to include females could be seen in Sega's use of the increased number of female protagonists in fighting games. Other examples of this include games like Mass Effect 3, Remember Me, and the Last of Us, which include a female option for the main character. The decision to use strong female characters in important roles, however, is often met with skepticism by marketers concerned with sales. Examination of IGN's <b>Big</b> <b>Games</b> at E3 2012 and <b>Big</b> <b>Games</b> at E3 2013 shows growth of the female protagonist in video games, rising 4% from 2012 to 2013. Other efforts outside of making games with female characters have also started to occur. One example is that Women in Games International has teamed up with the Girl Scouts of Greater Los Angeles {{in order to create a}} video game patch which the two organizations hope will encourage Girl Scouts to develop an interest in science, technology, engineering, and math. Activism and specifically female-targeted LAN parties in Scandinavia have helped boost female game playing.|$|E
25|$|If the bowler bowls {{without some}} part of the front foot landing either {{grounded}} or in the air behind the popping crease. If the front foot of a bowler lands behind the crease and slides beyond, then it is not a No ball. If the foot lands outside the crease, it is a No ball. It is legal for a spin bowler, for example, to land with his toe spikes grounded wholly in front of the crease but to have his heel in the air behind that line. The bowler must satisfy the umpire that {{some part of}} the foot lands initially behind -or on- the line, and in <b>big</b> <b>games</b> this question is now subject to minute examination by television replay. Recent practice has been to allow the bowler the benefit of any residual doubt in this judgement.|$|E
40|$|Aim of study: Game {{species are}} {{considered}} a scarce natural resource and therefore {{they are subject to}} economic analysis. Current studies on factors affecting <b>big</b> <b>game</b> trends have mostly emphasized the impact of ecological supply variables. This study intends to expand this analysis by considering two important supply and demand economic parameters. Area of study: We use <b>big</b> <b>game</b> hunting in Spain from 1972 until 2007 as a case study since it has {{an important role in the}} European hunting activity.   Material and Methods: Different linear models were fitted to explain <b>big</b> <b>game</b> harvest as a function of two parameters not previously used: hunting grounds areas and <b>big</b> <b>game</b> firearm hunting licenses. Main results: Our main results show that up to 1989 the decrease in the area of open access territories significantly explains the increase in <b>big</b> <b>game</b> harvests, and that afterwards, once the hunting property rights were strengthen in most of the Spanish territory, the number of <b>big</b> <b>game</b> firearm licenses best explain <b>big</b> <b>game</b> harvests increments. Research highlights : This work shows an upward trend in Spanish harvests of <b>big</b> <b>game,</b> which can be attributed in part to (1) a shift to the right of <b>big</b> <b>game</b> demand, measured by an increase in <b>big</b> <b>game</b> firearm licenses, and (2) a change in the nature of <b>big</b> <b>game</b> supply (from a backward to an ordinary upward supply curve) due to the strengthening of hunting property rights of Spanish hunting grounds.

Some people are wary of the club's relation {{to the world of}} media and show business (players are regularly invited as TV show guests). The critiques can also be explained by the historic Paris vs provinces divide and some form of acrimony {{in the rest of the}} country for everything that comes from the capital.

According to commentator Brian Conacher, Team Canada had adjusted its game to not play [...] "dump and chase" [...] but instead retain possession in the offensive zone.

500|$|Wenger {{has been}} able to {{implement}} his entertaining vision of football, particularly at Arsenal. His team's 5–1 win against Portsmouth in March 2004 was likened to [...] "the magnificently fluid Ajax of the early 70s", and greeted with a standing ovation by the opposition supporters, as the Arsenal players left the field. Wenger's style of play, however, been criticised for inefficiency and a lack of variation to go with technique. He is not renowned for making game-changing substitutions, nor has his tactics helped his teams overcome flexible opponents. His ideals are noticeably different from the pragmatic approach of his rivals, though he has assembled teams to produce disciplined performances, markedly the 2005 FA Cup Final against Manchester United. Defeats in the <b>big</b> <b>games</b> during 2013–14 led to Wenger compromising his attack-minded principles in favour of keeping it tight. The team's approach has been less predictable than when it was built around Fàbregas, with the initial predictability allowing Sir Alex Ferguson to devise a template to beat Arsenal, which involved [...] "good players who can intercept".|$|E

History has indicated that wherever he went, the team was competitive. The more that was on the line in <b>big</b> <b>games,</b> the better Joe played." [...] He was an offensive centre in Calgary and power play specialist, able to withstand the physical punishment required {{to stand in front of}} the net and battle defencemen for the puck. He led the NHL in power play goals in 1987–88 with 31 and finished in the top ten on four other occasions. [...] Wayne Gretzky, who also played box lacrosse in his youth, argued that the skills Nieuwendyk learned dodging opposing players in that sport aided his development as a hockey player. Nieuwendyk was regarded as a top faceoff man, a skill that Team Canada relied on during the Olympics. He was a checking-line centre at the 2002 Olympics, relied on for his defensive and faceoff abilities.|$|E

500|$|Arsenal {{opened the}} 2013–14 {{season with a}} home defeat to Aston Villa, which {{prompted}} boos from the supporters. The club's transfer inactivity over the summer was criticised, but Wenger assessed: [...] "We could have won the game today with {{the players on the}} pitch, I'm convinced of that." [...] In the final week of the transfer window, he re-signed Flamini and sanctioned the club record signing of Mesut Özil from Real Madrid, totalling £42.5 million. Wenger was instrumental in the latter deal; he phoned and spoke to the German in his native language, convincing him that a move to England would enhance his career. Arsenal's form thereafter improved and Aaron Ramsey's goalscoring spree elevated the team to first position by the New Year. Poor performances in the <b>big</b> <b>games,</b> however, blighted Arsenal's title credentials, with a 6–0 loss to Chelsea at Stamford Bridge being described as [...] "a good hiding [...] you don't prepare all week to experience that." [...] The defeat marked Wenger's 1,000th match in charge of Arsenal. Arsenal consolidated fourth position in the league, and Wenger guided his team to FA Cup success, as they came from two goals down to beat Hull City in the final, and clinch Arsenal their first trophy in nine years. At the end of the season, Wenger signed another three-year extension to his Arsenal contract. He strengthened the squad by signing Alexis Sánchez from Barcelona in July 2014, and during the course of 2014–15, promoted Francis Coquelin and Héctor Bellerín into the first team. Wenger won his sixth FA Cup in May 2015, which placed him alongside George Ramsay as the most successful manager in the competition's history.
