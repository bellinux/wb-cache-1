5|$|Forests make {{up about}} , or 48 percent, of the province's land area. The forests consist of pines (Jack Pine, Red Pine, Eastern White Pine), spruces (White Spruce, Black Spruce), <b>Balsam</b> <b>Fir,</b> Tamarack (larch), poplars (Trembling Aspen, Balsam Poplar), birches (White Birch, Swamp Birch) and small pockets of Eastern White Cedar.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the animals}} in the spruce-fir forest have ranges that extend into the <b>balsam</b> <b>fir</b> forest higher up. Warblers are abundant; more than ten species exist in this forest type. Other common birds include brown-capped chickadees, spruce grouse, and yellow-capped woodpeckers. Mammals include the red {{squirrel}} and the pine marten.|$|E
5|$|The {{tradition}} {{of having a}} National Christmas Tree in Washington, D.C. began in 1923 when a 48-foot <b>Balsam</b> <b>Fir</b> from Vermont {{was placed in the}} Ellipse outside the White House. On Christmas Eve, President Calvin Coolidge lit the 2,500 red, white and green electric bulbs on the tree.|$|E
5000|$|Swamp - swamp forest types never {{completely}} dry out, so <b>balsam</b> <b>firs</b> have constant access to water. The ground {{is covered in}} sphagnum and other mosses. In swamps, <b>balsam</b> <b>firs</b> grow densely and slowly, and are slender.|$|R

50|$|Conifers can include: Jack pines (Pinus banksiana); Black and White spruces (Picea mariana and Picea glauca); <b>Balsam</b> <b>firs</b> (Abies balsamea), and EasternRed junipers (Juniperus virginiana).|$|R
5|$|Coniferous trees such {{as black}} spruce, white spruce, and <b>balsam</b> <b>fir</b> {{dominate}} the native vegetation. The largest deciduous tree is white birch; species of lesser stature include alder, cherry and mountain ash. Of introduced tree species, sycamore maple is most abundant and Norway maple is common. Blue spruce, common horsechestnut, European beech and littleleaf linden {{are among the}} other non-native species grown.|$|E
5|$|As {{elevation}} {{continues to}} increase, only the hardiest trees {{remain in the}} forest, which is composed almost exclusively of <b>balsam</b> <b>fir.</b> Most of the understory plants and animals from the upper spruce-fir zone, however, {{can be found in}} this forest. Moisture causes nutrients to be stripped from the soil and brought to lower elevations, and decomposition takes place at a rate that is too slow to replenish them.|$|E
5|$|In 1906, Charles Horton Peck {{described}} the variety magna from material collected in North Elba, New York. Peck {{explained that the}} variety differed from the typical species in several ways: var. magna grew among fallen leaves under <b>balsam</b> <b>fir</b> trees, or among mosses on the ground, not on buried wood; it lacked a stem, and was instead broad and rounded underneath; its hymenium was more yellow-brown then the nominate variety; and, its spore were slightly longer.|$|E
5000|$|Hardwood slope - ground rot {{is common}} in this well drained area and leaf litter covers the forest floor. <b>Balsam</b> <b>firs</b> grow fast, tall and large along with big {{hardwood}} trees such as yellow birch, sugar maple and beech.|$|R
50|$|The Great Appalachian Storm of November 1950 took a heavy toll on {{the summit}} <b>balsam</b> <b>firs.</b> Blowdown was {{extensive}} in both the bog and non-bog areas. The trees that remained standing died more rapidly due to the exposure. It has since recovered, but the bog has become vulnerable {{to the effects of}} acid rain in the meantime, possibly changing its growth patterns.|$|R

Ancient Plinnee maintained, that {{originally}} {{it must be}} a juice, exuding from <b>balsam</b> <b>firs</b> and pines; Borhavo, that, like camphor, it is the crystalized oil of aromatic ferns; Berzilli, that it is the concreted scum of the lake Cephioris; and Vondendo, against scores of antagonists, stoutly held it a sort of bituminous gold, trickling from antediluvian smugglers' caves, nigh the sea." ...|$|R
5|$|Southern Labrador {{is mostly}} taiga. It is {{characterized}} by low winter temperatures, a longer growing season, and more precipitation than the tundra. Soils are typically lacking important nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus. The taiga is dominated by coniferous trees, notably <b>balsam</b> <b>fir</b> and black spruce, though the deciduous white birch, trembling aspen and mountain ash are also present. The most common animals are the moose, American black bear, Canada lynx, red fox, pine marten, short-tailed weasel, and American mink. Beavers, muskrats, and river otters thrive in the many rivers, streams, and wetlands. Willow ptarmigan, common raven, and blackpoll warbler inhabit the forests of southern Labrador while golden eagles, rough-legged hawks and peregrine falcons nest on steep cliffs.|$|E
25|$|The {{forests of}} Anticosti Island are typical boreal forest, with common {{species such as}} white spruce, <b>balsam</b> <b>fir,</b> and black spruce. It is {{distinguished}} by some minor stands of American white birch and trembling aspen. <b>Balsam</b> <b>fir</b> is slowly being replaced with white spruce because of intensive grazing done by deer and by periodic outbreaks of hemlock looper and spruce budworm. About {{a quarter of the}} island is covered by peat lands.|$|E
25|$|Quebec, {{along with}} New England {{and the other}} provinces of Atlantic Canada, is a primary {{producer}} of <b>Balsam</b> <b>Fir</b> trees for use as Christmas trees; the <b>Balsam</b> <b>Fir</b> {{is one of the}} most popular species of Christmas tree in North America. Quebec Christmas tree production in 1997 totaled nearly 1.9 million trees, 80 percent of which were exported for sale in the United States and Mexico. The remaining 20 percent of the 97 crop in Quebec was sold locally.|$|E
50|$|Forest covers 93% of the territory. It {{is located}} at the {{northern}} treeline leafyes Quebec. There are 30 species of different trees. The park is part of habitat ranges from maple to yellow birch (Acer saccharum and Betula papyrifera), which occupies the illuminated slopes and well-drained soils. The <b>Balsam</b> <b>firs</b> (Abies balsamea) and the pine (Pinus sp) and spruces (Picea sp) occupy the rocky cliffs and wetlands.

50|$|At {{this point}} hikers leave {{the trail and}} its public easement. Permission is {{required}} from the Furlow Lodge caretaker to climb {{from there to the}} summit of Graham since it is private property. The Old Tappan Road curves around the side of Turner Hollow, descending 100 feet (30 m) before ascending again after a fork where an older portion of the Turner Hollow Road descends on the left to Drury Hollow. The road ahead continues the gentle ascent until 3400 ft, where it climbs more sharply up a series of switchbacks, passing some of the <b>balsam</b> <b>firs</b> on the slope at higher elevations.|$|R

In 2012, Whitchurch–Stouffville's forest cover was 28.9%.|$|E
25|$|The best-selling {{species in}} the North American market are Scots pine, Douglas-fir, noble fir, <b>balsam</b> <b>fir,</b> Fraser fir, Virginia pine, and eastern white pine, {{although}} other types of trees are also grown and sold. In Alabama, for example, types of trees grown for use as Christmas trees include eastern white pine, redcedar, Virginia pine, Leyland cypress, and Arizona cypress.|$|E
25|$|This {{results in}} the boreal forest at higher {{elevations}} on the mountain having a notably higher proportion of paper birch and red spruce to <b>balsam</b> <b>fir</b> compared to Slide and other major Catskill peaks. These pioneering species are often found in areas regenerating themselves (red spruce is also found as an associate to hemlocks at lower elevations near Stony Clove Notch, reflecting the extensive tanbarking there).|$|E
40|$|The use {{of remote}} sensing to discriminate, measure, and map forest damage is evaluated. TM spectal coverage, a helicopter-mounted radiometer, and {{ground-based}} surveys were utilized {{to examine the}} responses of the spruces and firs of Camels Hump Mountain, Vermont to stresses, such as pollution and trace metals. The basic spectral properties of vegetation are described. Forest damage at the site was estimated as 11. 8 - 76. 0 percent for the spruces and 19 - 43. 8 percent for the <b>balsam</b> <b>firs.</b> Shifts in the spectra of the conifers in particular in the near IR region are analyzed, and variations in the mesophyll cell anatomy and pigment content of the spruces and firs are investigated. The relations between canopy moisture and damage is studied. The TM data are compared to aircraft data and found to be well correlated...|$|R

50|$|This {{plant is}} a climax species, {{occurring}} in mature forests and tolerant of shade. It is a dominant herb {{in a number}} of ecosystems, such as the forests of the Appalachian Mountains. It occurs there in the understory of red spruce (Picea rubens) and <b>balsam</b> or Fraser <b>fir</b> (Abies balsamea or A. fraseri).|$|R
25|$|Nearly 60 {{percent of}} the park is covered with {{northern}} hardwood forest. Above 2600 feet (790 m) conditions are too poor for hardwoods to thrive, and these trees become mixed with or replaced by <b>balsam</b> <b>fir</b> and red spruce. Above 3500 feet (1000 m) black spruce replace red. Higher still only trees short enough to be covered in snow during the winter can survive.|$|E
25|$|Riding Mountain National Park is {{also well}} known for its wildflowers and wide range of unique vegetation, most of which is not seen {{anywhere}} else in the prairie regions of Canada. There are 669 species of plants in the park. Vegetation common to the region includes aspen poplar, balsam poplar, white birch or paper birch, white spruce, <b>balsam</b> <b>fir,</b> jack pine, black spruce, tamarack, American elm, Manitoba maple, and bur oak.|$|E
25|$|The native {{trees of}} the Paudash Lake area include the silver, red, sugar, mountain, and striped maple; the jack, red, and white pine; the largetooth and {{trembling}} aspen; the yellow and white birch; black, white, and possibly red spruce; the bur and red oak; the white, black, and red ash; the pin, black, and choke cherry, and the <b>balsam</b> <b>fir,</b> eastern tsuga (hemlock), tamarack (larch), balsam poplar, white cedar (Thuja occidentalis), American beech, ironwood (Ostrya virginiana), and speckled alder.|$|E

40|$|Inverting {{previously}} developed explicit expressions for {{a vertical}} architecture, bidirectional reflectances measured over corn viewing from the solar quadrant at azimuths near the principal plane {{are used to}} determine the spectral reflectances of plant elements. The leaf reflectance values extracted in three visible bands at viewing zenith angles of 70 deg, 60 deg, and 45 deg agree closely with laboratory-measured reflectances of corn leaves. At viewing zenith angle of 30 deg, the inversion breaks down, inasmuch as the inferred plant element reflectances are too high. Satisfactory results are also achieved when the same approach is applied to bidirectional reflectances measured over potted <b>balsam</b> <b>firs,</b> but when applied to soybeans reflectances, the procedure yields unreasonably high leaf reflectances. The failure in this case is attributed to the nonvertical architecture of the soybean canopy; however, for this canopy, inversion based on horizontal architecture is possible. The bidirectional reflectances measured from the solar quadrant, at viewing angles appreciably far from 'hot spot' viewing, approximately equal in magnitude half of the leaf reflectance. The 0. 5 ratio is predicted by a previous analysis of opaque horizontal Lambertian facets, as the asymptotic value for a dense canopy at any viewing angle. For soybeans, this ratio applies very closely at 15 deg viewing zenith angle. The results suggest that inversion based on simple architecture, applying explicit expressions, might be of value, either in itself or as a preliminary step before inversion applying complex models...|$|R
5000|$|Red {{ring rot}} {{is common in}} North America. The {{pathogen}} Phellinus pini is widely spread in the temperate zone in the Northern Hemisphere.

25|$|Canaan Valley and {{surrounding}} areas were strongly {{impacted by the}} southward advance of glaciers some 15,000 years ago. Although the glaciers themselves did not extend into the area, this climatic change resulted in a very cool, moist environment that was forest-unfriendly. Later, as the ice receded, many cold-adapted plant species remained behind and survived due to the high elevation. Soon, however, this tundra-like vegetation was largely crowded out by the growth of an extraordinarily dense climax red spruce forest, intermixed with <b>balsam</b> <b>fir</b> and hardwoods.|$|E

40|$|DISTRIBUTION AND HOSTS: Native {{to central}} Europe, the balsam woolly adelgid is now {{distributed}} throughout {{eastern and western}} North America. It attacks all true firs, Abies spp., including <b>balsam</b> and Fraser <b>fir.</b> DESCRIPTION OF DAMAGE: Introduced from Europe around 1900, the balsam woolly adelgid is considered a serious pest of forest, seed production, landscape, and Christmas trees. It generally concentrates either on the outer portions of tree crowns or on the main stem and large branches. Stem infestations are usually more serious, causing greater levels of damage and mortality. Abnormal drooping of the current shoots and gouting of the outer twigs characterize crown infestations. The crown becomes increasingly thin and dieback may occur. Persistent crown infestation can kill a tree {{over a number of}} years. Stem attacks are characterized by the conspicuous presence of white woolly masses that, under heavy attack, give the lower bole a whitewashed appearance. The wood responds to adelgid feeding in an "allergic " manne...|$|R
