25|$|The term {{black powder}} was coined {{in the late}} 19th century, {{primarily}} in the United States, to distinguish prior gunpowder formulations from the new smokeless powders and semi-smokeless powders. Semi-smokeless powders featured <b>bulk</b> <b>volume</b> properties that approximated black powder, but had significantly reduced amounts of smoke and combustion products. Smokeless powder has different burning properties (pressure vs. time) and can generate higher pressures and work per gram. This can rupture older weapons designed for black powder. Smokeless powders ranged in color from brownish tan to yellow to white. Most of the bulk semi-smokeless powders ceased to be manufactured in the 1920s.|$|E
25|$|In {{industrial}} practice, {{the iron}} catalyst is obtained from finely ground iron powder, {{which is usually}} obtained by reduction of high purity magnetite (Fe3O4). The pulverized iron metal is burnt (oxidized) to give magnetite of a defined particle size. The magnetite particles are then partially reduced, removing some of the oxygen in the process. The resulting catalyst particles consist of a core of magnetite, encased in a shell of wüstite (FeO), {{which in turn is}} surrounded by an outer shell of iron metal. The catalyst maintains most of its <b>bulk</b> <b>volume</b> during the reduction, resulting in a highly porous high surface area material, which enhances its effectiveness as a catalyst. Other minor components of the catalyst include calcium and aluminium oxides, which support the iron catalyst and help it maintain its surface area. These oxides of Ca, Al, K, and Si are unreactive to reduction by the hydrogen.|$|E
25|$|Many {{potential}} uses of MOFs exist beyond hydrogen storage, such as gas purification, gas separation, {{gas storage}} (other than hydrogen), and heterogeneous catalysis. MOFs are promising for gas purification because of strong chemisorption {{that takes place}} between electron-rich, odor-generating molecules (such as amines, phosphines, oxygenates, alcohols, water, or sulfur-containing molecules) and the framework, allowing the desired gas {{to pass through the}} MOF. Gas separation can be performed with MOFs because they can allow certain molecules to pass through their pores based on size and kinetic diameter. This is particularly important for separating out carbon dioxide. Regarding gas storage, MOFs can store molecules such as carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, methane, and oxygen due to their high adsorption enthalpies (similar to hydrogen). In principle, these same MOFs could also be used for catalysis because of their shape and size selectivity and their accessible <b>bulk</b> <b>volume.</b> Also, because of their very porous architecture, mass transport in the pores is not hindered. MOF Technologies Limited a company based in Belfast, United Kingdom are the largest manufacturing company for MOFs.|$|E

30|$|The {{positive}} {{coefficients for}} these two factors indicate that countries with {{a higher standard of}} living and more inhabitants relate to a larger dry <b>bulk</b> SSS <b>volume,</b> which might be expected. More interestingly, the third factor included in the model indicates that the dry <b>bulk</b> SSS <b>volume</b> decreases for countries with a larger length of railway. This could be {{explained by the fact that}} rail transportation might be able to act as a substitute for dry bulk SSS, but only if sufficient rail infrastructure is available. The fact that all of the three factors regarding the number of SSS ports are excluded from the model indicates that these factors are less relevant in determining the dry <b>bulk</b> SSS <b>volume</b> of a country. Last of all, the values in the VIF column in Table 6 indicate that there is some concern for multicollinearity in the multivariate linear regression model for the dry <b>bulk</b> SSS <b>volume,</b> due to correlation between railway length and number of inhabitants. However, the VIF values are still well below a commonly used threshold value of 5 (above which multicollinearity can be considered high).|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} an experimental investigation of two-phase flow properties of porous rock samples having different scales ranging from micro-CT imaging to conventional core plug scales. Advances in micro-CT imaging of porous materials provide {{the opportunity to}} extract representative networks from the images. This improves the predictive capability of porescale network models to predict multiphase flow properties. However, all these predictions need to be validated with laboratory data. Micro-CT imaging is currently limited to small sample sizes, having <b>bulk</b> <b>volumes</b> {{of the order of}} 0. 1 cm³. Conventional core plugs, however, have sizes several orders of magnitude larger than that (<b>bulk</b> <b>volumes</b> of 10 cm³ or larger). The aim of this thesis is to investigate the scale effect on laboratory data and to provide reliable experimental data which can be used to test the predictive value of microCT based network models. Berea and Bentheim sandstones and Mount Gambier carbonate were used in the experiments. The core samples were thoroughly cleaned in order to obtain strongly, uniform water-wet conditions. Simple well-characterized fluid systems were chosen in the experiments: Air-brine fluid-system for drainage capillary pressure, resistivity index and spontaneous imbibition experiments while oil-brine fluid-system for wettability and relative permeability measurements. Drainage capillary pressure, resistivity index, relative permeability and spontaneous imbibition measurements were made on the cores having <b>bulk</b> <b>volumes</b> ranging from 0. 1 to 12 cm³. Previous studies have shown that experiments at this scale are still lacking. The wettability was tried to keep strongly water-wet for all experiments. The experimental results show that the measurements of drainage capillary pressure, and resistivity index and spontaneous imbibition on small core samples, having similar scales as micro-CT imaging can be made accurately in the laboratory. The measurement of relative permeability remains challenging. This thesis concludes that commonly used homogeneous rock types (Berea and Bentheim sandstones and Mt. Gambier carbonate) can be considered to be sufficiently homogeneous from the pore to core scale based on the two-phase flow properties examined in this study. Hence, laboratory data taken from these rocks using conventional core plugs can be used to calibrate micro-CT based network models for multiphase flow properties...|$|R

50|$|The {{eruption}} volume has {{not been}} well constrained, from 70 to 160 km3. Machida et al.,(1990) roughly estimated the proximal volume(include ignimbrite and Plinian fall) no more than 20 km3, and the volume of distal B-Tm ashfall attains more than 50 km3. A low total <b>bulk</b> <b>volume</b> estimate is 70 km3. Horn and Schmincke (2000) used an exponential method for minimum area/thickness and maximum area/thickness to obtain {{the volume of the}} Plinian ashfall as 82 ± 17 km3, and used the area-thickness method for ignimbrite to obtain 14.9 ± 2.6 km3. The total <b>bulk</b> <b>volume</b> estimate was 96 ± 19 km3. Liu et al.,(1998) also used same method with Horn and Schimincke to calculate the volume of Plinian ashfall, and obtained the similar value of 83 km3. However, Liu used a different area-thickness value for ignimbrite. Liu assumed a distribution of ignimbrite within 40 km of the caldera, and an average ignimbrite thickness of 7.47m, yielding a volume of ignimbrite of 37.5 km3. The total <b>bulk</b> <b>volume</b> from this is 120 km3. Guo et al.,(2001) used the exponential method estimate that volume of ashfall is 135.2 ± 7.8 km3. But Guo assumed the geometry of ignimbrite is a cone, and the volume of ignimbrite could be 20.1 km3. Guo also calculated the volume of valley-ignimbrite, because in a valley the thickness of ignimbrite could be 80 m. Then, the total <b>bulk</b> <b>volume</b> is 161.6 ± 7.8 km3.
