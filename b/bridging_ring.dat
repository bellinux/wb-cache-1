40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{presented}} in four parts. Part I describes the synthesis of the hydrocarbon 3 : 4 - 5 : 6 -dibenzocyclohepta- 3 : 5 -diene {{and the introduction of}} a carboxylic acid group into the diphenyl nucleus. Onexamination, no evidence of the existence of optical isomerism of the acid could be found. The ultraviolet absorption spectrum of the hydrocarbon, in ethanol solution, showed an inflection at 280 mu, which had hitherto not been recorded. The synthesis of 2 : 2 '-bisbromoethyldiphenyl is described. Condensations of this compound with piperidine gave an unbridged product instead of the expected diphenyl, bridged across the 2 : 2 '-positions with a chain of five atoms to form altogether a nine-membered <b>bridging</b> <b>ring.</b> Treatment of 2 : 2 '-bisbromoethyldiphenyl with diethyl malonate in the presence of sodium ethoxide resulted in loss of the elements of hydrogen bromide and formation of 2 : 2 '-divinyldiphenyl. 2 -Carbomethoxy- 2 '-carbomethoxymethyldiphenyl was synthesized and treated with finely divided sodium in xylene. Instead of the expected acyloin-type condensation, a condensation of the Dieckmann type took place, resulting in a diphenyl containing a six-membered <b>bridging</b> <b>ring.</b> Part II is devoted to the synthesis and reactions of 4 : 5 - 4 ': 5 '-tetramethyldiphenyl. This compound was prepared with the intention of introducing two chloromethyl groups in the 2 : 2 '-positions, and forming a <b>bridging</b> <b>ring</b> by suitable condensations. Only one chloromethyl group could be introduced in the diphenyl nucleus. Part III contains an account of the preparation of di-B-naphthol and the attempts to resolve it. Its dimenthoxyacetic ester was prepared but its dihydrogen succinate and dihydrogen phthalate could not be made. Part IV describes the synthesis of N-benzoyl- 2 '-bromo- 4 ': 6 '-dimethyldiphenylamine- 3 -carboxylic acid, although complete and final proof of its preparation was unobtainable. The treatment of 2 '-chloro-N-benzoyl- 6 -methyl-diphenylamine- 2 -carboxylic acid with lithium aluminium hydride is also described. <p...|$|E

40|$|A {{transition}} piece has responsibility to transmit forces from one member to another member. But when doing it, the {{transition piece}} must be stiff enough. Studying what parameter {{of the transition}} piece is contributing to the stiffness the most, will give economic advantages. Studies on the stiffness when introducing a transition piece on a hybrid tower {{will be carried out}} with an analytical procedure through Finite element method, with the software Abaqus. A linear perturbation, with a frequency step where extraction of the eigenfrequency value will be obtained. The value will reflect the stiffness of the structure, because it has a linear relation between each other. Higher eigenfrequency means higher stiffness and vice versa. The first model (Case A) is model of a fixed tubular tower. The frequency of case A is desired because itâ€™s stiff at the bottom. Therefore a comparison has been made when introducing the transition piece. The eigenfrequency of the tubular tower (Case A) is 0, 36765 Hz. And The eigenfrequency of the structure (Case D) is 0, 21964 Hz, which make a stiffness reduction of 40, 3 % when introducing the transition piece. 60, 6 % of the total reduction is due to the <b>bridging</b> <b>ring.</b> The most efficient change on the <b>bridging</b> <b>ring</b> that will obtain a higher stiffness on the entire structure is to increase mid-plates layers...|$|E

By comparing the structures, it was determined that the specificity of the relative inhibitors for ADAMTS- 5 was not driven by a specific interaction, such as zinc chelation, hydrogen bonding, or charge interactions, but rather by subtle and indirect factors, such as water <b>bridging,</b> <b>ring</b> rigidity, pocket size, and shape, as well as protein conformation flexibility...|$|E
40|$|In only a {{few cases}} can a {{reasonably}} valid comparison be made between the optical stabilities of unbridged biphenyls and those bridged with a 7 -membered <b>bridging</b> <b>ring.</b> An attempt was made in this work to prepare bridged and unbridged biphenyl compounds with similar interfering groups and to compare their optical stabilities. Quaternary salts derived from various 2, 2 '-bisbromomethylbiphenyls were chosen since by condensation of the latter with suitable amines analogous bridged and unbridged biphenyls can be produced, with the further advantage that the resolving groups are not directly attached to the biphenyl nucleus. 2 -Bromomethyl- 1 -(o-bromomethylphenyl) naphthalene was synthesised and 2, 7 -dihydronaphtho(2 ', 1 ' : 3, 4) - 5, 6 -benzasepinium- 1 -spiro- 1 '''-piperidinium iodide and 2, 2,-'bis(N-pyridinium-methyl) - 5, 6 -benzbiphenyl dibromide were obtained. Attempts to prepare more of the dipyridyl salt or to obtain salts with other tertiary bases were not successful. 2, 2 '-Dimethyl- 4, 4 '-dinitrobiphenyl was synthesised. However on side-chain bromination it gave a mixture of mono-and dibromo-compunds of very similar solubilities. 2, 2,-Bisbromomethylbiphenyl was condensed with N-methylephedrine, pyridine, trimethylamine and dimethylamine. No unstable optical activity was detected in the resulting quaternary salts. The salts were subjected to Hofmann degradation conditions. The bis-ephedrinium hydroxide gave the expected 2, 2 '-bis(dimethylaminomethyl) biphenyl in appreciable yields only when carbon dioxide was excluded; the diamine was accompanied by: (-) -N-methylephedrine, 9 -dimethylamino- 9,lQ-dihydro-phenanthrene and the 2, 7 -dibydro-l, 1 -dimethyl- 3, 4 : 5, 6 -dibenz-azepiniua cation. 9 -Dimethylamino- 9, 10 -dihydrophenanthrene was also isolated from the products of Hofmann degradation of 2, 2 '-bis (trimethylammoniomethyl) biphenyl and of 2, 7 -dihydro- 1, 1 -dimethyl- 5, 4 : 5, 6 -dibenzazepinium hydroxides.

40|$|The general aim of {{the work}} was to explore the design and {{synthesis}} of new ligands which could have potential to mimic the action of neurotransmitters at the dopaminergic or serotonergic receptor sites. The {{first part of the}} project involved studies on the design and development of medium-ring cyclophane-based potential prodrugs which could be ultimately converted to an endogenous ligand, dopamine. A photochemical route to the m-cyclophane lactams was improved and extended. New chloroacetamides and derivatives were prepared for photochemical investigation. Photolysis of (40) gave rise to a new m-cyclophane analogue (64) in good yield whose structure was confirmed by X-ray crystallography. In addition, a range of other m-cyclophanes (65), (66) and (67) were obtained from the photolysis of chloroacetamides (42), (44) and (46) respectively. Photolysis of other new chloroacetamide derivatives (52), (53), (54), (57), (58), (59), (60), (61) and (63), however, did not result in the formation of m-cyclophane lactams. Benzazepinone analogues or nonheterocyclic products were obtained instead. Mechanistic pathways for the products were indicated. The usefulness of the photochemical approach to medium ring heterocycles was further extended. Photolysis of N-chloroacetamide derivatives, 3 -chloroacetyl- 7, 8 -dimethoxy- 4, 5 -dihydro-lH- 3 -bezazepin- 2 (3 H) -one (86) in aqueous acetonitrile gave 11 a-hydroxy- 8, 9 -dimethoxy- 5, 6, 11,lla-tetrahydrooxazolo[2, 3 -b][3]benzazepin- 2 -(2 H) -one (87) in good yield. This representative of a new heterocyclic system could be converted into the 11 a-ethoxy derivative (88) by recrystallization from ethanol. The structure of (88) was confirmed by X-ray crystallography. Work was also conducted to develop methods to modify the bridging chain of the m-cyclophane derivatives as part of the potential prodrug studies. Further to this effort, some new chemistry associated with approaches to fused indole systems from the m-cyclophane precursors was uncovered. Reaction of cyclophane lactams (8) and (64) with N-bromosuccinimide {{in the presence of a}} catalytic amount of azobisisobutyronitrile led to new seven membered ring fused indolic derivatives (104 - 112) via C-N intramolecular cyclisation. The reaction, however, did not proceed with N-protected lactam functionality in the <b>bridging</b> <b>ring.</b> Alternative C-C cyclisation in (8) by using boron tribromide gave the previously reported imine (102) which, in turn, was used to prepare the new tricyclic chloroacetamide derivatives (119), (120) and (121) for photochemical investigation. Ultraviolet irradiation of the silylated eneamide (121) afforded a benzopyran chloroacetamide derivative (122) in low yield. The second part of this project was involved with the design and development of non-natural ligands for serotonergic sites and was carried out under a scientific exchange program at the Universite of Orleans (France). A new series of 3, 4 -dihydro- 3 -amino- 2 H-benzopyran derivatives with various C 5 -substituents, (146), (143), (145), (137), (158), (159), (160), (141) and (178) were successfully prepared. The substituents were introduced via palladium-mediated cross-coupling reactions. The effect of these different groups in the 5 -position on the interactions with 5 HT 1 A-and 5 HT 7 -subtype receptors was evaluated. In vitro studies, carried out by the pharmaceutical company SERVIER indicated that these derivatives are very active agonists while the ketones (145) and (160) are more potent than the lead compounds at the serotonergic receptor sites. In an extension of this work,an azido derivative, (69) was also synthesised for future photo-affinity labelling of the above receptors...|$|E
