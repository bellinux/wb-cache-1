25|$|The Artois Hound {{does not}} require a large amount of grooming. The Artois' smooth {{short-haired}} coat is easy to look after. Owners will simply want to make sure the coat is brushed on a consistent basis. These dogs should only be given baths when they need it. A wipe down with a damp towel should suffice for the bathing aspect, (although you should bathe it with mild soap only if or when necessary; you should also dry shampoo it occasionally), however a rubber, wire, or hard <b>bristled</b> <b>brush</b> would work best for the brushing aspect.The shedding patterns of these dogs are not known. Be sure to check the ears carefully for signs of infection. The nails of the D'Artois should also be trimmed, (particularly to avoid nail-born infections).|$|E
50|$|A new 2-3 inch {{diameter}} soft <b>bristled</b> <b>brush</b> is a {{good choice}} for the application of wax. “Chip” brushes are easy to find in hardware stores, and are a good choice because of their natural bristles and relative inexpensiveness.|$|E
5000|$|Rough stucco is used {{to imitate}} stonework. It is worked with a hand float covered with rough felt (a stiff <b>bristled</b> <b>brush</b> can also be used), which forms a sand surface on the plaster. Lines are ruled before the stuff is set to {{represent}} the joints of stonework.|$|E

50|$|The <b>bristle</b> <b>brush</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} widely used types of brushes mainly because it can be used for any type of coat. As a general rule, longer and widely spaced {{bristles}} are suitable for dogs with longer coats and shorter and tightly-packed ones are better to use on dogs with short hair. Typically, the <b>bristle</b> <b>brush</b> is used on dogs with long coats to finish the coat and to bring out the natural lustre and shine of the coat. It is commonly used in daily grooming as it removes surface dust and dirt.|$|R
5000|$|Brush: For liquid foundation, a {{brush with}} a {{synthetic}} bristle is recommended as the brush won’t soak {{up too much}} of the liquid. Alternatively, a natural bristle which is more porous works best for powder foundations such as mineral makeup. A densely <b>bristled</b> <b>brush</b> is best for foundation as it is less likely to leave tell-tale streaky brush marks. As with all tools used to apply makeup to the face, brushes should be soft and gentle, as anything too stiff will scratch and irritate the skin.|$|E
50|$|Dust {{and dirt}} can {{accumulate}} feathers {{and can be}} cleaned manually. The preferred methods are gentle brushing with a soft <b>bristled</b> <b>brush</b> or pinpoint vacuuming through a screen. These methods will leave the feathers in good condition in their natural alignment. However, solvents {{may be needed to}} clean feathers if dust is held in place by grease, which can leach out of skins. Distilled water may be used if dry methods fail, but more stubborn dust may need to be cleaned with non-denatured 70% ethanol. However, solvents may strip natural oils in feathers and leave them brittle.|$|E
50|$|To this {{is added}} filler {{that has been}} {{previously}} warmed, and the pigment required to color the mixture; the whole is then well stirred and strained to remove any lumps. Many patent wash-able distempers under fancy names {{are now on the}} market in the form of paste or powder, which simply require to be mixed with water to be ready for use. If applied to woodwork distemper is apt to flake off. The one-knot brush for cornices and other moldings and the two-knot and brassbound brushes for flat surfaces are usually employed for distempering and whitewashing. A granular surface is produced by stippling or dabbing the surface with a stiff <b>bristled</b> <b>brush</b> specially made for this purpose.|$|E

30|$|Macroinvertebrate {{communities}} were characterized using richness and abundance data derived from semi-quantitative and qualitative samples from these communities (Moulton et al. 2000). Macroinvertebrate sampling methodology was adopted from pre-fire sampling that collected samples within riffle habitats using a 0.09 m 2 Surber sampling frame and hand scraping channel substrate materials within the stream {{with a stiff}} <b>bristled</b> <b>brush</b> (Rinne and Medina 1988). Samples were taken at each of five sites per stream within riffle habitats of similar substrate, depth, and velocity. Samples were preserved in 70 % ethanol. The pre-fire samples were collected {{in the beginning of}} August in 1985, 1986, 1987, and 1988. Post-fire samples were collected in late June and early July of 2002 and 2011. A maximum of 600 individual macroinvertebrates from each sample were identified and enumerated down to the lowest possible taxonomic level and classified into Operational Taxonomic Units based on Cuffney et al. (2007). Functional feeding groups were classified by the methods of Cummins and Merritt (2008).|$|E

40|$|Background: Oral {{health is}} an {{integral}} part of general health. Poor oral health can have adverse effect on general health hence a good oral health is very essential, which in turn is achieved by good oral hygiene. Even though, the concept of good oral hygiene evolved 5000 years back, it is only in the beginning of 19 th century it gained more importance. (1) Dental caries and periodontal disease are the most commonly occurring diseases affecting mankind. Dental plaque is a very important factor in the causation of both the diseases. (2) Aims & Objectives: To evaluate efficacy of four different types of toothbrushes, with difference in duration of brushing along with different bristle hardness in removal of microbial plaque. Material & Methods: In a randomized controlled trial, four groups with 40 subjects used manual toothbrushes with either hard, medium, soft and ultra-soft bristles. On baseline examination, clinical parameter plaque index (Sillness & Loe, 1964) was recorded. Selected subjects were refrained from all kinds of oral hygiene measures for 24 hrs before clinical appointment. On the day of clinical appointment scores of pre and post brushing were recorded in each patient when brushing time was set for 1 minute and same procedure was repeated after a wash off period of 3 days and similar recordings were made with brushing time of 11 / 2 minute. Primary outcome was measured with differences in the plaque index (Sillness & Loe, 1964) compared to baseline. Results: Significant reduction in mean value of plaque score was observed on comparing pre-brushing and post-brushing data in all the subjects irrespective of bristle hardness in both 1 minute and 11 / 2 minute groups. On increasing time duration from 1 minute to 11 / 2 minute intergroup comparison revealed that significant correlation exist in mean plaque score reduction in subjects using medium <b>bristle</b> <b>brush,</b> soft <b>bristle</b> <b>brush,</b> ultra-soft <b>bristle</b> <b>brush.</b> However, no significant reduction in plaque score was observed on increasing duration from 1 minute to 11 / 2 minute in subjects using hard <b>bristle</b> <b>brush.</b> Conclusion: Manual toothbrushes with hard bristles better remove plaque, but may also cause more soft tissue trauma compared to <b>brushes</b> with softer <b>bristles...</b>|$|R

50|$|The {{wire brush}} is {{primarily}} an abrasive implement, used for cleaning rust and removing paint. It {{is also used}} to clean surfaces and to create a better conductive area for attaching electrical connections, such as those between car battery posts and their connectors, should they accumulate a build-up of grime and dirt. When cleaning stainless steel, it is advisable to use a stainless steel <b>bristle</b> wire <b>brush,</b> as a plain carbon steel brush can contaminate the stainless steel and cause rust spots to appear. Brass <b>bristle</b> <b>brushes</b> are used on softer surfaces or in potentially flammable environments where non-sparking tools are required. Wire brushes are also used to clean the teeth of large animals, such as crocodiles and pigs. They are also used widely in surface engineering to clean the castings to paint the castings.|$|R
50|$|Dog brushes come {{in various}} {{sizes and shapes}} {{can be made from}} metal, plastic and wood. Although there are many types of dog brushes, they are not very popular amongst the {{professional}} dog groomers as most of them prefer using teasels. Dog brushes are perfect for breeds that have long and fragile hair, especially if the coat is getting properly taken care of. Common dog <b>brushes</b> are the <b>bristle</b> <b>brush,</b> wire pin brush, and the slicker brush.|$|R
50|$|One way to {{distribute}} the hair's natural oils through the hair is by brushing with a natural <b>bristle</b> <b>brush.</b> The natural <b>bristles</b> effectively move the oil from the scalp through to the hair's mid-lengths and ends, nourishing these parts of the hair. Brushing the scalp also stimulates the sebaceous gland, which in turn produces more sebum. When sebum and sweat combine on the scalp surface, they help to create the acid mantle, which is the skin's own protective layer.|$|R
50|$|Synthetic {{materials}} such as nylon are also used to make bristles in items such as brooms and sweepers. Bristles are often used to make brushes for cleaning purposes, as they are strongly abrasive; common examples include the toothbrush and toilet <b>brush.</b> The <b>bristle</b> <b>brush</b> and the scrub brush are common household cleaning tools, often used to remove dirt or grease from pots and pans. Bristles are also used on brushes other than for cleaning, notably paintbrushes.|$|R

50|$|A hard {{shaving soap}} is {{used with a}} shaving brush to create lather for shaving. For soap {{in the form of}} a puck or bar, the brush is first soaked in water and then swirled vigorously over the surface of the soap, causing moist soap to coat the <b>brush's</b> <b>bristles.</b> The <b>brush</b> is then {{transferred}} either to a separate bowl or to the shaver's face to be lathered.|$|R
50|$|After {{returning}} to New York from a Fulbright Fellowship {{in his native}} Ecuador in the early 1990s, Bastidas began using a restricted color palette of black and white, alluding to black-and-white photography. His medium- and large-scale paintings featured contrasting zones {{of high and low}} detail. By making thousands of marks with a size No. 1 hog's <b>bristle</b> <b>brush</b> on linen primed with rabbit-skin glue, Bastidas achieved a high level of image definition. He also works in digital photography, which informs his subject matter without rendering a photo-realistic effect.|$|R
50|$|Some fluxes for {{electronics}} {{are designed}} to be stable and inactive when cool and {{do not need to be}} cleaned off, though they still can be if desired, while other fluxes are acidic and must be removed after soldering to prevent corrosion of the circuits. For PCB assembly and rework, either an alcohol or acetone is commonly used with cotton swabs or <b>bristle</b> <b>brushes</b> to remove flux residue after soldering. A heavy rag is usually used to remove flux from a plumbing joint before it cools and hardens. A fiberglass brush can also be used.|$|R
25|$|Medical hand-washing is for {{a minimum}} of 15 seconds, using generous amounts of soap and water or gel to lather and rub each part of the hands. Hands should be rubbed {{together}} with digits interlocking. If there is debris under fingernails, a <b>bristle</b> <b>brush</b> may be used to remove it. Since germs may remain in the water on the hands, it is important to rinse well and wipe dry with a clean towel. After drying, the paper towel should be used to turn off the water (and open any exit door if necessary). This avoids re-contaminating the hands from those surfaces.|$|R

50|$|If the {{aetiology}} of abrasion {{is due to}} habitual behaviours, the discontinuation {{and change}} of habit is critical {{in the prevention of}} further tooth loss. The correct brushing technique is pivotal and involves a gentle scrub technique with small horizontal movements with an extra-soft/soft <b>bristle</b> <b>brush.</b> Excessive lateral force can be corrected by holding the toothbrush in a pen grasp or by using the non-dominant hand to brush. If abrasion is the result of an ill-fitting dental appliance, this should be corrected or replaced by a dental practitioner and should not be attempted in a home setting.|$|R
