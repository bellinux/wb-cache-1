40|$|Gap {{asymmetry}} in differential capacitors is {{the primary}} source of the zero <b>bias</b> <b>output</b> of force-balanced micro accelerometers. It is also used to evaluate the applicability of differential structures in MEMS manufacturing. Therefore, determining the asymmetry level has considerable significance for the design of MEMS devices. This paper proposes an experimental-theoretical method for predicting gap asymmetry in differential sensing capacitors of micro accelerometers. The method involves three processes: first, bi-directional measurement, which can sharply reduce the influence of the feedback circuit on <b>bias</b> <b>output,</b> is proposed. Experiments are then carried out on a centrifuge to obtain the input and output data of an accelerometer. Second, the analytical input-output relationship of the accelerometer with gap asymmetry and circuit error is theoretically derived. Finally, the prediction methodology combines the measurement results and analytical derivation to identify the asymmetric error of 30 accelerometers fabricated by DRIE. Results indicate that the level of asymmetry induced by fabrication uncertainty is about ± 5 × 10 − 2 , and that the absolute error is about ± 0. 2 µm under a 4 µm gap...|$|E

In Experiment 1, repetition blindness (RB) was found for rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) letter sequences, whether the visual targets were specified by category membership (vowels) or as 1 of 2 prespecified letters (e. g., A or O). In Experiment 2, RB was found to a similar degree even when the 1 st critical item was displayed for twice as long as the other list items, although overall performance was considerably improved.

40|$|This paper re-examines {{the impact}} of {{deregulation}} and technological change on U. S. motor carrier costs for the period 1976 - 1987. A truncated, third-order translog cost function, developed by Stevenson (1980) allows us to decompose technological change into three components: input <b>bias,</b> <b>output</b> bias, and characteristics bias. We examine the source of these biases and use the model to test the Schumpeter hypothesis, which asserts that large firms innovate {{at a faster rate}} than small firms. We show that technological change has been labor-saving and purchased capital-using, and that these input biases were induced by changes in output level. The increase in the capital cost share and the decrease in fuel cost share are attributed to deregulation. Over time, the LTL sector of the motor carrier industry has become more capital intensive, resulting in even higher entry barriers. The output bias of technological change on the representative firm is not significant and our results do not support the Schumpeter hypothesis in the LTL sector of the motor carrier industry. Technological change has increased the economies of larger shipment size over time, but has not significantly altered {{the impact of}} average load, average length of haul, or insurance per ton-mile on costs over time. Also we find that deregulation, through its negative impact on technological change, has resulted in higher industry costs. ...|$|E

30|$|Ordered probit and logit {{modeling}} {{structures were}} applied to establish the kind of relationship that does exist among important road attributes and user-perceived service levels. These analytical tools are probably the best choices particularly when the response variable is a categorical variable ordered in a meaningful way. For instance, the user-perceived scores (output variable) collected in this study varies from 1 (excellent service quality, ‘A’) to 6 (very poor service quality, ‘F’) in a very meaningful way at a discrete interval of 1. Unlike interval scales, ordinal scales have two unique features: a clear ordering of the categories such as ‘A’ is superior to ‘B,’ and ‘B’ is superior to ‘C’ and unobservable absolute distances among the categories. Hence, when standard multinomial discrete-outcome modeling techniques such as multinomial probit and logit approaches are used to model the categorical data set by considering them as nominal, it often results in inaccurate and <b>biased</b> <b>outputs.</b> On the contrary, treating ordered categorical variables as ordinal is advantageous in terms of parsimoniousness, simpler interpretations, superior detection power, better flexibility, and more similarity to the ordinary regression modeling.|$|R

The Malmquist index can be decomposed into several components: technical change (further broken down into technical change magnitude, input <b>bias,</b> and <b>output</b> <b>bias),</b> technical efficiency change, scale efficiency change, and output-mix effect. A translog output distance function is chosen to represent the production technology, and each component of the Malmquist index is computed using the estimated parameters. This parametric approach allows us to statistically test hypotheses regarding different components of the Malmquist index {{and the nature of}} production technology. The empirical application to Chinese agriculture shows that productivity grows at 2 percent per year on average from 1978 through 2010.

Unfortunately, most of the existing approaches for collecting needed information produce <b>biased</b> <b>outputs.</b> Indeed, either overoptimistic or pessimistic estimates of future opportunities are produced.

Several reasons behind the difficulties in assessing resource limitation are discussed. Secondly, the concept of problem mapping through a network of contradictions is introduced. The methodology of mapping technological barriers is described. Some specificities from the practice of contradiction mapping are presented and discussed. The third part studies how problem-contradiction mapping can be applied for the efficient assessment of technology barriers.
