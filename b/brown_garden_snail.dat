40|$|AbstractTerrestrial {{gastropods}} {{have become}} important economic pests attacking various vegetations in Egypt. According to this study, the molluscicidal activity of methomyl, urea, and copper hydroxide against the <b>brown</b> <b>garden</b> <b>snail</b> Eobania vermiculata {{and the small}} white garden snail, Theba pisana was investigated. The obtained results indicated that copper hydroxide was the most toxic compound against E. vermiculata followed by methomyl and urea after 72 h of evaluation where LC 50 values were 3. 31 %, 3. 75 % and 40. 88 %, respectively. Methomyl was also the most toxic compound when it was tested against T. pisana followed by copper hydroxide followed by urea. The LC 50 values were 3. 76 %, 4. 63 % and 40. 13 %, with respect. The <b>brown</b> <b>garden</b> <b>snail</b> was more susceptible to copper hydroxide and methomyl than the second one. There {{was no difference in}} the susceptibility of the two tested snails to urea. The toxicity of the compounds was enhanced as increasing the exposure time.

40|$|Abstract: Size, {{density and}} {{distribution}} of the <b>brown</b> <b>garden</b> <b>snail</b> (Cantareus aspersus) were observed relative to cover at a coastal reserve on the North Island, New Zealand. Cover variables depended on vegetation height and available debris (rubbish, wood, cow dung). Air temperature, ground temperature, and relative humidity were recorded continuously during the field survey for the various cover types. Live snails used debris disproportionately as resting habitat, where relative humidity and temperature were the least variable. Desiccation rates were obtained by dehydrating snails of three size-classes and calculating desiccation rates {{as a function of}} water loss over time under controlled conditions in the laboratory. Results suggest that the shell aperture:size ratio is an important factor regarding desiccation stress in C. aspersus, especially in young and small-sized snails. __________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________...|$|E

40|$|The {{courtship}} {{behavior of}} the <b>brown</b> <b>garden</b> <b>snail,</b> Cantareus aspersus, includes a bizarre component where one snail attempts to pierce its mating partner with a sharp, calcareous dart that is covered with mucus. In vitro, the mucus causes conformational changes to the reproductive tract causing sperm to be stored rather than digested. In addition, successful dart shooters have an increased relative paternity compared to unsuccessful shooters. I have tested whether this increased paternity {{is caused by the}} mucus delivered on the dart or by the mechanical action of the dart. Mating trials were conducted using dartless and glandless snails, where a future mother was mated to two different potential fathers, receiving an injection of mucus with one mating, and an injection of saline with the second mating. The fathers accompanied by the mucus injection sired significantly more offspring than the fathers accompanied by the saline injection. I conclude that the mucus carried on the dart is responsible for increased paternity levels in Cantareus aspersus...|$|E
40|$|Snails and slugs, {{ubiquitous}} orchid pests, can inflict a {{great deal}} of damage to virtually every part of an orchid. They wait for the cover of night to wreak their havoc. Snails and slugs, left unchecked, can infest a collection and kill your orchids fairly quickly. If you grow orchids outdoors or in a greenhouse, these pests are likely {{to be found in the}} vicinity of your growing area. Indoor growers may introduce them with a new plant, which can harbor snails, slugs or their eggs unseen in the growing medium. Snails and slugs eat mostly flowers, roots and tender new growths, although, if those are unavailable, they will consume any plant part. Because they do their damage primarily under the cover of darkness, they can be difficult to detect and eradicate. There are many different types of slugs and snails that will eat orchids; some of the more common are the orchid or bush snails (Zonitoides arboreus), the <b>brown</b> <b>garden</b> <b>snail</b> (Helix aspersa), the field slug (Deroceras reticulatum) and the marsh slug (Deroceras laeve).

40|$|Several taxa of pulmonate {{land snails}} exhibit a {{conspicuous}} mating behaviour, {{the shooting of}} so-called love darts. During mating, such land snail species stab a mating partner with a mucus-coated dart. It has previously been shown that the sperm donor physiologically influences the sperm recipient via the mucus covering the dart and thereby decreases the number of sperm digested by the recipient. However, the generality of this effect of the dart's mucus is unclear, because almost all the previous studies {{on the effect of}} the mucus used the <b>brown</b> <b>garden</b> <b>snail</b> Cornu aspersum from the family Helicidae. Therefore, the relationship between the acquisition of the mucus effect on the recipient and the evolution of the dart itself, and its mucus, is still open to debate. To test the commonality of the physiological effect of the dart mucus, we examined this in Euhadra peliomphala, a species from the Bradybaenidae family, and compared our findings with the results of previous work using C. aspersum. Our experiments showed that in E. peliomphala, the dart mucus had a physiological effect and lowered the accessibility of the gametolytic organ, as found in C. aspersum. This indicates that in various dart-bearing species the mucus from the dart glands targets the same organ and that the inhibition of sperm digestion has {{played a crucial role in}} the evolution of the dart and its mucus...|$|E
40|$|Laboratory bioassays {{were carried}} out for {{evaluating}} the efficacy of certain plant materials including Nicotine, Thymol, Menthol, Caffeine and Camphor as molluscicides against the <b>brown</b> <b>garden</b> <b>snail,</b> Eobania vermiculata using the topical application method. The obtained results proved that Nicotine and Thymol were the most promising from the molluscicidal point of view with LD 50 204. 02 and 551. 20 g/snail for the two materials, respectively. The effects of sublethal doses (LD 25 and LD 50) of the most potent materials, Thymol and Nicotine, on the oxygen consumption of E. vermiculata snails after 1, 7 and 15 days post treatment were evaluated. Results indicated that only snails treated with LD 50 Thymol showed significant decrease in their oxygen uptake; while all the other treatments stimulated {{significant increase in the}} oxygen consumption along the three periods of estimation. This stimulation was most pronounced with the low sublethal doses of the both examined botanical molluscicides. The succession of time post exposure did not enable the treated snails to eliminate the adverse effects of the applied materials. Depending on the results of the current investigation, we can conclude that the both examined botanical materials, Thymol and Nicotine, are effective in killing the agricultural pest E. vermiculata but further studies are needed to evaluate the efficacy of these materials as safe and economic molluscicides in the field...|$|E
40|$|International audienceDispersal {{decisions}} are often condition-dependent, {{influenced by the}} interaction of individual phenotype and environmental conditions. Terrestrial Gastropods are simultaneous hermaphrodites, a reproductive system rarely studied {{in the context of}} dispersal. Moreover, the energetic cost of their movement is one of the highest among animals. Despite these features, which make them valuable models to understand the trade-offs between dispersal and other life-history traits, their dispersal strategies have been barely explored. We studied the movements of subadults and adults of the <b>brown</b> <b>garden</b> <b>snail</b> Cornu aspersum in a semi-natural 4 -patch network, for 2 months in 2011 (a dry year) and 1 month in 2012 (a wet year). We assessed the effects of life-history stage (subadult/adult) and weather conditions on dispersal propensity and dispersal speed. Snails were more mobile under humid and warm weather, but nearly all individuals left patches when the relative humidity was close to 100 % in 2012. Because such humidity levels are potentially lethal to C. aspersum, we argue these extreme emigration rates might be an emergency escape response to harmful conditions. Despite a theoretically higher cost of movement, we found that subadults emigrated more, and dispersed faster and further, than adults. Thus, and contrary to what was expected, direct costs of movement do not play the main role in shaping dispersal in C. aspersum. Observed differences between subadults and adults in dispersal behaviour are discussed in the context of intraspecific competition, inbreeding avoidance and relative costs of male and female reproduction...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The use of snails as {{biocontrol}} agents {{against other}} snails and against aquatic weeds is reviewed, evaluating their success and their impacts on non-target organisms. The predatory snail Euglandina rosea (and other species), although widely used against Achatina fulica (the giant African land snail) on Pacific and Indian Ocean islands, {{has not been}} shown to control A. fulica but has seriously impacted endemic island species. The facultative predator Rumina decollata, used in California against Helix aspersa (<b>brown</b> <b>garden</b> <b>snail),</b> is widely considered to be environmentally benign. However, evidence of its effectiveness is weak and it will also consume native snails. Ampullariid and thiarid freshwater snails {{have been used as}} competitors (and incidental predators) of snail vectors of human schistosomes, the parasites causing schistosomiasis (bilharzia). Successful control has been reported but impacts on native biotas have been essentially ignored. Ampullariids have been used in attempts to control aquatic weeds, sometimes successfully, but again with little consideration of impacts on native biota. Most snails have generalist feeding habits. Thus they are inappropriate biocontrol agents because of their potential non-target effects. Rarely has adequate pre-release testing of snails been undertaken and post-release monitoring of non-target impacts has always been incidental. The use of non-native snails for biocontrol purposes is poorly regulated; many introductions are unofficial and sometimes illegal. Use of snails as biocontrol agents, if implemented, must be based on adequate pre-release testing, post-release monitoring and genuine concern for preservation of native biodiversity. 1...|$|E
40|$|Although animal {{courtship}} {{behaviors are}} generally understood {{within the context}} of sexual selection, the relevance of many sexual behaviors to sexual selection, and vice versa, remains unexplained. For example, the adaptive function of the ‘‘love dart’’ used in the precopulatory behavior of hermaphroditic land snails is only now becoming apparent. Contrary to previous as-sumptions, dart shooting is unlikely to function as a stimulus for copulation. In searching for a more ultimate explanation of the dart’s function, we tested whether variation in dart shooting influences reproductive fitness in Helix aspersa. Individual mother snails were mated sequentially to two potential fathers. Dart shooting was closely observed and quantified for all pairings, and percentages of offspring sired by each potential father were determined using allozymes. The results indicate that snails that shoot darts effectively have significantly greater paternal reproductive success than snails that shoot poorly. In contrast, there was no significant effect of mating order on either dart shooting or paternal reproductive success.

40|$|Synopsis Sexual {{selection}} and sexual conflict {{have been shown}} to play key roles in the evolution of species with separate sexes. Experimental evidence is accumulating that this is also true for simultaneous hermaphrodites. For example, many species of land snails forcefully stab their mating partners with love darts. In the <b>brown</b> <b>garden</b> <b>snail</b> (Helix aspersa, now called Cantareus asperses), this dart increases sperm storage and paternity, probably via the transfer of an allohormone that inhibits sperm digestion. A recent interspecies comparison of dart-possessing land snails revealed coevolution between darts and spermatophore-receiving organs that is consistent with counteradaptation against an allohormonal manipulation. The great pond snail (Lymnaea stagnalis) seems to use a seminal product to manipulate its partner and mates in the male role when enough seminal fluid is available in the prostate gland. Receipt of semen not only initiates egg laying in virgin animals, but also feminizes the mating partner later in life. These increases in the female function {{have been shown to}} go at the expense of growth and seminal fluid production of the sperm recipient. Although in Helix, and probably also Lymnaea, the sperm donor benefits from the induced changes through increased fertilization success, the sperm recipient may experience injury, imposed reallocation of resources, and altered sperm storage. These findings support the existence of sexual conflict in simultaneously hermaphroditic snails, and its importance for the evolution of mating behaviors and reproductive morphologies is discussed...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe extreme {{fragmentation}} of natural habitats due to urbanisation {{can influence the}} evolution of dispersal strategies in species persisting in cities. The <b>brown</b> <b>garden</b> <b>snail</b> Cornu aspersum is an anthropophilic species, capable of maintaining its populations in highly fragmented habitats despite a high cost of movement. In this species, we studied the variation of dispersal-related behaviours and traits along an urbanisation gradient characterised at two biologically relevant spatial scales (10 and 50 m), {{in order to identify}} the effects of habitat fragmentation on movement. The olfactory perceptual range was low, between 1 and 2. 5 m, meaning that snails should perceive a large range of landscapes as fragmented. In line with previous results, subadults were more prone to explore than adults in the least urbanised populations. The boundary-crossing behaviour of subadults was not affected by urbanisation, while exploration propensity of adult snails increased with urbanisation at the 50 m (long-distance dispersal) scale, to reach subadult levels in more urban sites. Foot mass (a correlate of movement speed) and perceptual range were not affected by urbanisation. These results are interpreted in relation to the different levels of competition snails are likely to experience in different environments, the high risk of local extinction in urban fragmented landscapes, and the available opportunities for reproduction. They indicate that benefits of dispersal still need to be considered even in situations where movement costs are extremely important. The maintenance of relatively high mobility and its extension to the adult stage in response to anthropogenic changes may thus {{play a major role in}} the success of Cornu aspersum in urban habitats...|$|E

One {{area of interest}} is peptides and proteins produced by invertebrates {{as part of their}} defence system, including the contents of mollusc mucus. Mucus produced by the African giant land snail, Achatina fulica has been reported to contain two proteins with broad-spectrum antibacterial activity. Mucus from the <b>brown</b> <b>garden</b> <b>snail,</b> Helix aspersa, appears to have skin regeneration properties. This study sought to investigate the antimicrobial properties of H. aspersa mucus. Mucus was collected from H. aspersa snails, diluted in phosphatebuffered saline (PBS), with the supernatant tested against a wide range of organisms in a disc-diffusion antimicrobial assay. This was followed with comparative experiments involving A. fulica, including bacteriophage assays. Mucus from both species of snail was passed through a series of protein size separation columns {{in order to determine the}} approximate size of the antimicrobial substance. Electrophoresis was also carried out on the H. aspersa mucus. Results indicated that H. aspersa mucus had a strong antibacterial effect against several strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and a weak effect against Staphylococcus aureus. Mucus from A. fulica also inhibited the growth of S. aureus, but the broad spectrum of activity reported by other workers was not observed. Antimicrobial activity was not caused by bacteriophage. Size separation experiments indicated that the antimicrobial substance(s) in H. aspersa were between 30 and 100 kDa. Electrophoresis revealed two proteins in this region (30 – 40 kDa and 50 – 60 kDa). These do not correspond with antimicrobial proteins previously reported in A. fulica.
