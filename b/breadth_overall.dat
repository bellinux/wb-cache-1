The potentially declining and expanding species (_B. fervidus_ and _B. impatiens_) possessed the narrowest and widest diet breadths respectively. In addition to possessing specialist tendencies, _B. fervidus_ had little niche overlap with other {{species in the}} community (i. e. it visited plants other species were not visiting). Although _B. impatiens_ had the widest diet breadth and was also the most abundant species (50 % total collections), diet <b>breadth,</b> <b>overall,</b> {{was not associated with}} abundance (Spearman&#x 2019;s rho = 0. 37, p = 0. 46). However, we found that species abundance was positively correlated with abundance of most preferred host plant (Spearman&#x 2019;s rho = 0. 97, p = 0. 0012). The results {{of this study indicate that}} resource limitation may put _B. fervidus_ at risk of decline when preferred host plants are reduced or lost, whereas _B. impatiens_ may be resistant to extirpation due to its &#x 201 c;super-generalist&#x 201 d; tendencies. |$|E

Therefore, from a clinical point of view, it is advisable to also focus on the child-parent interaction while preventing or treating NSSI in adolescents and young adults...|$|R
40|$|AbstractEmergence of SIV and HIV {{specific}} CD 8 T cells {{has been}} shown to correlate with control of in vivo replication. Poor correlation between IFN-γ ELISPOT responses and in vivo control of the virus has triggered the development of more relevant assays to assess functional HIV- 1 specific CD 8 T-cell responses for the evaluation and prioritization of new HIV- 1 vaccine candidates. We previously established a viral inhibition assay (VIA) that measures the ability of vaccine-induced CD 8 T-cell responses to inhibit viral replication in autologous CD 4 T cells. In this assay, viral replication is determined by measuring p 24 in the culture supernatant. Here we describe the development of a novel VIA, referred to as IMC LucR VIA that exploits replication-competent HIV- 1 infectious molecular clones (IMCs) in which the complete proviral genome is strain-specific and which express the Renilla luciferase (LucR) gene to determine viral growth and inhibition. The introduction of the luciferase readout does provide significant improvement of the read out time. In addition to switching to the LucR read out, changes made to the overall protocol resulted in the miniaturization of the assay from a 48 to a 96 -well plate format, which preserved sample and allowed for the introduction of replicates. The overall assay time was reduced from 13 to 8 days. The assay has a high degree of specificity, and the previously observed non-specific background inhibition in cells from HIV- 1 negative volunteers has been reduced dramatically. Importantly, we observed an increase in positive responses, indicating an improvement in sensitivity compared to the original VIA. Currently, {{only a limited number of}} “whole-genome” IMC-LucR viruses are available and our efforts will focus on expanding the panel to better evaluate anti-viral <b>breadth.</b> <b>Overall,</b> we believe the IMC LucR VIA provides a platform to assess functional CD 8 T-cell responses in large-scale clinical trial testing, which will enhance the ability to select the most promising HIV- 1 vaccine candidates capable of controlling HIV- 1 replication in vivo...|$|E

The Abs first acquired autologous neutralization, then gradually matured to achieve breadth. One Ab neutralized > 47 % of HIV- 1 strains with only ∼ 11 % somatic hypermutation and no insertions or deletions. By sequencing autologous env, we determined key residues that triggered the lineage and participated in Ab-Env coevolution. Next-generation sequencing of the Ab repertoire showed an early expansive diversification of the lineage followed by independent maturation of individual limbs, several of them developing notable <b>breadth</b> and potency. <b>Overall,</b> the findings are encouraging from a vaccine standpoint and suggest immunization strategies mimicking the evolution of the entire high-mannose patch and promoting maturation of multiple diverse Ab pathways...|$|R

40|$|As biology {{education}} is being redesigned toward an interdisciplinary focus and as pedagogical trends move toward active-learning strategies and investigative experiences, a {{restructuring of the}} course content for the Introductory Biology course is necessary. The introductory course in biology has typically been a survey of all the biosciences. If {{the total number of}} topics covered is reduced, is the students’ overall knowledge of biology also reduced? Our introductory course has been substantially modified away from surveying the biological sciences and toward providing a deep understanding of a particular biological topic, as well as focusing on developing students’ analytical and communication skills. Because of this shift to a topic-driven approach for the introductory course, we were interested in assessing our graduating students’ overall knowledge of the various biological disciplines. Using the Major Field Test - Biology (Educational Testing Service (ETS), Princeton, NJ), we compared the test performance of graduating students who had a traditional lecture-based introductory course to those who had a topic-driven active-learning introductory course. Our results suggest that eliminating the traditional survey of biology and, instead, focusing on quantitative and writing skills at the introductory level do not affect our graduating students’ <b>overall</b> <b>breadth</b> of knowledge of the various biosciences...|$|R

Here, we interrogated the in vivo relevance of this cell population by investigating whether the breadth of expandable memory responses is associated with the magnitude of residual viremia in individuals achieving durable suppression of HIV infection. HIV-specific memory CD 8 T cells were expanded by using autologous epitopic and variant peptides. Viral load was measured by an ultrasensitive single-copy PCR assay. Following expansion, controllers showed a greater increase in the <b>overall</b> <b>breadth</b> of Gag responses than did untreated progressors (P 0. 01) as well as treated progressors (P 0. 0003). Nef- and Env-specific memory cells expanded poorly for all groups, and their expanded breadths were indistinguishable among groups (P 0. 9 for Nef as determined by a Kruskal-Wallis test; P 0. 6 for Env as determined by a Kruskal-Wallis test). More importantly, we show that the breadth of expandable, previously unde-tectable Gag-specific responses was inversely correlated with residual viral load (r 0. 6; P 0. 009). Together, these data re-veal a direct link between the abundance of Gag-specific expandable memory responses and prolongedmaintenance of low-level viremia.

40|$|The {{characterization}} of the cross-reactive, or heterologous, neutralizing antibody responses developed during human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1) infection and the identification of factors associated with their generation {{are relevant to the}} development of an HIV vaccine. We report that in healthy HIV-positive, antiretroviral-naïve subjects, the breadth of plasma heterologous neutralizing antibody responses correlates with the time since infection, plasma viremia levels, and the binding avidity of anti-Env antibodies. Anti-CD 4 -binding site antibodies are responsible for the exceptionally broad cross-neutralizing antibody responses recorded only in rare plasma samples. However, in most cases examined, antibodies to the variable regions and to the CD 4 -binding site of Env modestly contributed in defining the <b>overall</b> <b>breadth</b> of these responses. Plasmas with broad cross-neutralizing antibody responses were identified that targeted the gp 120 subunit, but their precise epitopes mapped outside the variable regions and the CD 4 -binding site. Finally, although several plasmas were identified with cross-neutralizing antibody responses that were not directed against gp 120, only one plasma with a moderate breadth of heterologous neutralizing antibody responses contained cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies against the 4 E 10 epitope, which is within the gp 41 transmembrane subunit. Overall, our study indicates that more than one pathway leads to the development of broad cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies during HIV infection and that the virus continuously escapes their action...|$|R

This study of 48 Vietnamese adults with secondary dengue virus infections defined the breadth and magnitude of peripheral T-cell {{responses to}} 260 overlapping peptide antigens derived from a dengue virus serotype 2 (DV 2) isolate. Forty-seven different peptides evoked significant gamma interferon enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assay responses in 39 patients; of these, 34 peptides contained potentially novel T-cell epitopes. NS 3 and particularly NS 3200 - 324 were important T-cell targets. The breadth and magnitude of ELISPOT responses to DV 2 peptides were independent of the infecting dengue virus serotype, suggesting that cross-reactive T cells dominate the acute response during secondary infection. Acute ELISPOT responses were weakly correlated with the extent of hemoconcentration in individual patients {{but not with the}} nadir of thrombocytopenia or overall clinical disease grade. NS 3556 - 564 and Env 414 - 422 were identified as novel HLA-A* 24 and B* 07 -restricted CD 8 + T-cell epitopes, respectively. Acute T-cell responses to natural variants of Env 414 - 422 and NS 3556 - 564 were largely cross-reactive and peaked during disease convalescence. The results highlight the importance of NS 3 and cross-reactive T cells during acute secondary infection but suggest that the <b>overall</b> <b>breadth</b> and magnitude of the T-cell response is not significantly related to clinical disease grade.

40|$|Graduation date: 2003 This study {{examined}} the dynamics of student, teaching assistant (TA), and faculty learning in relationship to implementation of a genetic technologies project in a university introductory biology course. Research focused on the types of learning that occurred and the various factors impacting that learning. Study participants included 25 undergraduate non-science majors, five graduate TAs, and two faculty, including the researcher participant. Qualitative methodologies were employed to address the exploratory nature of the research questions, and included {{a wide variety of}} data collection techniques. Variables related to learning were identified and categorized to develop a hypothesis of learning in the studied course. Students, TAs, and faculty demonstrated developing diverse and remarkably similar cognitive outcomes, learning strategies, and changes within the affective domain. Differences existed in the temporal displacement of learning, as well as breadth and depth of skills and understandings. Similar internal and external factors also impacted student, TA, and faculty learning. Interactions among the three subject groups were frequent, related to common topics of interest and corrections of curricular inadequacies, and were initiated by members of each group. Emerging categories of data were developed into a hypothesis of learning which incorporated (1) the combination of pre-existing subject and situational conditions with (2) characteristics of innovation, and (3) the resulting learning community. Shifting what was being learned and how it was being taught created opportunities for conflict and uncertainty. Through resolution of these concerns, distinctions between course teachers and learners became blurred. This study suggests that all participants, with their widely varying backgrounds, interests, and abilities, contributed to development of the learning community when both content and instruction were being altered. Factors such as large class size, lectures, and TA teaching appeared to add to the diversity of learning contexts of the course and positively impacted the <b>breadth</b> of <b>overall</b> learning outcomes. This study suggests that an incredible diversity of learning can occur in a small subset of subjects over a brief period of time. This complexity of learning sounds a cautionary note that innovation may not be effectively assessed through the measure of a few discrete aspects of learning...|$|R

The analysis of the stomach contents {{was based on the}} volumetric frequency (VF%) and frequency of occurrence (FO%), combined with the feeding index (FI). Nine different dietary items were identified: detritus, plant fragments, zooplankton, arthropods, chlorophytes, bacillariophytes, cyanobacteria, dinophytes, and unidentified material. Detritus was the principal component of the diet during both seasons, with all the other items representing only complementary or accidental portions of the diets of both species. Niche <b>breadth</b> was low <b>overall,</b> but slightly greater in H. plecostomus in comparison with H. emarginatus.  Niche overlap was accentuated in both seasons, which indicates that seasonality is not a major factor influencing the characteristics of the niches of these species, possibly because of the marked abundance of detritus in the study area, specifically in the impounded sector. The two species can be characterized as detritivores, which share dietary resources with no clear evidence of any negative effects of interspecific competition on the coexistence of the two populations.   Keywords: feeding ecology, niche breadth, Araguarí river, Amazonia.   DOI: [URL]...|$|R

Understanding approaches taken by existing successful exchanges can help new exchange efforts determine goals and plan implementations. The goal {{of this study was}} to explore characteristics of use and users of a successful regional HIE. Design We used a mixed-method analysis, consisting of cross-sectional audit log data, semi-structured interviews, and direct observation in a sample of emergency departments and ambulatory safety net clinics actively using HIE. For each site, we measured overall usage trends, user logon statistics, and data types accessed by users. We also assessed reasons for use and outcomes of use. Results Overall, users accessed HIE for 6. 8 % of all encounters, with higher rates of access for repeat visits, for patients with comorbidities, for patients known to have data in the exchange, and at sites providing HIE access to both nurses and physicians. Discharge summaries and test reports were the most frequently accessed data in the exchange. Providers consistently noted retrieving additional history, preventing repeat tests, comparing new results to retrieved results, and avoiding hospitalizations as a consequence of HIE access. Conclusion HIE use in emergency departments and ambulatory clinics was focused on patients where missing information was believed to be present in the exchange and was related to factors including the roles of people with access, the setting, and other site-specific issues that impacted the <b>overall</b> <b>breadth</b> of routine system use.

40|$|AbstractHigh-performance {{stretchable}} electronics have {{to utilize}} high-quality inorganic electronic {{materials such as}} silicon, oxide or nitride dielectrics, and metals. These inorganic materials usually crack or yield at very small intrinsic strains, for example, 1 %, whereas bio-integrated electronics are expected to at least match the stretchability of bio-tissues (20 %) and deployable structure health monitoring networks are expected to expand from wafer scale (several centimeters) to cover macroscopic structures (several meters). To minimize strains in inorganic materials under large deformation, metallic and ceramic films can be patterned into serpentine-shaped ribbons. When the ribbon is stretched, some sections of the ribbon can rotate and/or buckle to accommodate the applied displacement, leaving much smaller intrinsic strain in the materials compared to the applied strain. The choice of {{the shape of the}} serpentine depends on systematic studies of the geometric variables. This paper investigates the effect of serpentine shapes on their stretchability and compliance through theoretical, numerical, and experimental means. Our closed-form curved beam solutions, FEM results, and experimental measurements have found good agreement with one another. Our results conclude that in general, the narrower ribbon, the larger arc radius and arc angle, and the longer arm length will yield lower intrinsic strain and effective stiffness. When the arm length approaches infinite, the stretchability can be enhanced by several orders. A few unexpected behaviors are found at arc angles that are close to straight bars. With additional practical constraints such as minimum ribbon width and finite <b>overall</b> <b>breadth,</b> the optimal serpentine shape can be accurately determined using our closed-form analytical solution...|$|R

Samples were conducted in the Cuiabá River and Chacororé pond, in the upper Pantanal region, Mato Grosso State, Brazil, during one hydrological cycle (March 2000 to February 2001), (designed spatial-seasonal units). Mean niche <b>breadth</b> values were <b>overall</b> low for the fish assemblage (0. 2 - 0. 3). Differences between periods were not statistically significant. Feeding overlap values ranged between 0 and 0. 4, whereas the mean was always inferior to 0. 05 in all spatial-temporal units, and differences between periods were not statistically significant. The highest and lowest mean values were both observed in the pond; the former during the drought period and the latter during the flood period. All feeding overlap mean values {{were significantly higher than}} the values expected at random in the null model, using both "scrambled-zeros" (RA 3) and "conserved-zeros" (RA 4) algorithms. Thus, the foraging patterns show evidences of food sharing. The variance generated in the null model had a pattern similar to the niche overlap pattern: observed variance was higher than expected by chance in all spatial-temporal units, suggesting that the fish fauna is structured in trophic guilds. The patterns of food resource use and the different trophic guilds identified, suggest that species probably have different roles in this ecosystem. Our results suggest that food sharing allows coexistence of different fish species...|$|R

Among canids, competition {{may be reduced}} by partitioning resources such as food, time, and habitat, but the mechanisms of coexistence remain poorly understood, particularly among fox species. We described the food habits of two foxes that live sympatrically across northern and central Asia, the corsac fox (Vulpes corsac) and red fox (V. vulpes), by analyzing scats collected during a field study in Mongolia. We analyzed 829 corsac and 995 red fox scats collected from April 2005 to August 2007 and tested {{the extent to which}} food partitioning occurred. The diets of both species consisted mainly of insects followed by rodents, but also included birds, reptiles, large mammal remains (carrion), plant material (including fruits and seeds), and garbage. Despite high overlap in the proportion of food items consumed, differences existed between species in overall diet with corsacs more frequently consuming beetles, but proportionally fewer crickets and large mammal remains than red foxes. We detected interspecific differences during the pup rearing and dispersal seasons, when prey was abundant, but not during the breeding season, when prey was scarce and diet overlap highest. Each species' diet also differed seasonally and exhibited moderate <b>overall</b> <b>breadth.</b> Corsacs consumed proportionally more beetles and rodents during pup rearing and crickets during dispersal relative to other seasons, whereas red foxes consumed proportionally more crickets during pup rearing and dispersal and more rodents and large mammals during pup rearing and breeding relative to other seasons. Our results suggest that partitioning of food resources during most of the year facilitates coexistence, and that the potential for competition is highest during winter months. © 2009 Deutsche Gesellschaft für Säugetierkunde...|$|R
40|$|The {{restricted}} neutralization {{breadth of}} vaccine-elicited antibodies {{is a major}} limitation of current human immunodeficiency virus- 1 (HIV- 1) candidate vaccines. In order to permit the efficient identification of vaccines with enhanced capacity for eliciting cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) and to assess the <b>overall</b> <b>breadth</b> and potency of vaccine-elicited NAb reactivity, we assembled a panel of 109 molecularly cloned HIV- 1 Env pseudoviruses representing {{a broad range of}} genetic and geographic diversity. Viral isolates from all major circulating genetic subtypes were included, as were viruses derived shortly after transmission and during the early and chronic stages of infection. We assembled a panel of genetically diverse HIV- 1 -positive (HIV- 1 +) plasma pools to assess the neutralization sensitivities of the entire virus panel. When the viruses were rank ordered according to the average sensitivity to neutralization by the HIV- 1 + plasmas, a continuum of average sensitivity was observed. Clustering analysis of the patterns of sensitivity defined four subgroups of viruses: those having very high (tier 1 A), above-average (tier 1 B), moderate (tier 2), or low (tier 3) sensitivity to antibody-mediated neutralization. We also investigated potential associations between characteristics of the viral isolates (clade, stage of infection, and source of virus) and sensitivity to NAb. In particular, higher levels of NAb activity were observed when the virus and plasma pool were matched in clade. These data provide the first systematic assessment of the overall neutralization sensitivities of a genetically and geographically diverse panel of circulating HIV- 1 strains. These reference viruses can facilitate the systematic characterization of NAb responses elicited by candidate vaccine immunogens...|$|R
40|$|In HIV-infected persons, certain HLA class I alleles are {{associated}} with effective control of viremia, while others {{are associated}} with rapid disease progression. Among the most divergent clinical outcomes are the relatively good prognosis in HLA-B* 5801 expressing persons and poor prognosis with HLA-B* 5802. These two alleles differ by only three amino acids in regions involved in HLA-peptide recognition. This study evaluated a cohort of over 1000 persons with chronic HIV clade C virus infection to determine whether clinical outcome differences associated with B* 5801 (n = 93) and B* 5802 (n = 259) expression {{are associated with}} differences in HIV- 1 -specific CD 8 (+) T cell responses. The <b>overall</b> <b>breadth</b> and magnitude of HIV- 1 -specific CD 8 (+) T cell responses were lower in persons expressing B* 5802, and epitope presentation by B* 5802 contributed significantly less to the overall response as compared to B* 5801 -restricted CD 8 (+) T cells. Moreover, viral load in B* 5802 -positive persons was higher and CD 4 cell counts lower when this allele contributed to the overall CD 8 (+) T cell response, which was detected exclusively through a single epitope in Env. In addition, persons heterozygous for B* 5802 compared to persons homozygous for other HLA-B alleles had significantly higher viral loads. Viral sequencing revealed strong selection pressure mediated through B* 5801 -restricted responses but not through B* 5802. These data indicate that minor differences in HLA sequence can {{have a major impact}} on epitope recognition, and that selective targeting of Env through HLA-B* 5802 is at least ineffectual if not actively adverse in the containment of viremia. These results provide experimental evidence that not all epitope-specific responses contribute to immune containment, a better understanding of which is essential to shed light on mechanisms involved in HIV disease progression...|$|R
40|$|An {{important}} feature of a potential vaccine against HIV is the production of broadly neutralising antibodies (BrNAbs) capable of potentially blocking infectivity of a diverse array of HIV strains. BrNAbs naturally arise in some HIV infected individuals {{after several years of}} infection and their serum IgG can neutralise various HIV strains across different subtypes. We previously showed that vaccination of cows with HIV gp 140 AD 8 trimers resulted in a high titre of serum IgG against HIV envelope (Env) that had strong BrNAb activity. These polyclonal BrNAbs concentrated into the colostrum during the late stage of pregnancy and can be harvested in vast quantities immediately after calving. In this study, we investigated the effect of prolonged HIV gp 140 vaccination on bovine colostrum IgG HIV Env-binding and BrNAb activity over subsequent pregnancies. Repeated immunisation led to a maintained high titre of HIV Env specific IgG in the colostrum batches, but this did not increase through repeated cycles. Colostrum IgG from all batches also strongly competed with sCD 4 binding to gp 140 Env trimer and with human-derived monoclonal VRC 01 and b 12 BrNAbs that bind the CD 4 binding site (CD 4 bs). Furthermore, competition neutralisation assays using RSC 3 Env gp 120 protein core and a derivative CD 4 bs mutant, RSC 3 Δ 371 I/P 363 N, showed that CD 4 bs neutralising antibodies contribute to the neutralising activity of all batches of purified bovine colostrum IgG. This result indicates that the high IgG titre/avidity of anti-CD 4 bs antibodies with BrNAb activity was achieved {{during the first year of}} vaccination and was sustained throughout the years of repeated vaccinations in the cow tested. Although IgG of subsequent colostrum batches may have a higher avidity towards the CD 4 bs, the <b>overall</b> <b>breadth</b> in neutralisation was not enhanced. This implies that the boosting vaccinations over 4 years elicited a polyclonal antibody response that maintained the proportion of both neutralising and non-neutralising CD 4 bs antibodies...|$|R
40|$|Earnings {{management}} {{is an area}} in which managers are able to exercise discretion over financial reporting to achieve various objectives. Researchers have been investigating the pervasiveness of earnings management and incentives that induce earnings management. However, the evidence is mixed and studies of using Australian data are scarce. This thesis is an empirical investigation of earnings management in the Australian context addressing if and why Australian firms engage in earnings management. Based on a sample covering all ASX listed firms during the period of 2000 to 2006, this study examines the <b>overall</b> <b>breadth</b> and scope of earnings management behaviour in a broad context across Australian industry sectors and individual firms’ characteristics. The result suggests that Australian firms engage in earnings management. The level of earnings management practices in some specific industries and the association of these practices with firms’ characteristics may help the assessment and improvement of the overall quality of financial reporting. Based on a sub-sample, this study also examines whether the practices of earnings {{management is}} induced by executive compensation incentives. It extends prior research by using more relevant, recent, and large-scale compensation data to capture the dynamic relations between earnings management and different forms of executive pay. Such dynamic relations may be of interest to compensation committees in designing compensation structures that balance the incentives to improve firms’ performances with the incentive to earnings manipulation. This study also examines whether earnings management is induced by benchmark beating incentives. It extends prior research by examining under what circumstance managers are more likely to beat benchmarks. The results suggest that managers beat two earnings benchmarks: reporting profits and sustaining prior year’s earnings. More importantly, managers are more likely to exercise positive discretionary accruals to inflate earnings to beat ex post benchmarks when the true earnings are below relevant benchmarks. This will be of interest to regulators as an effective way to detect earnings management may be pronounced when the ex ante condition under which firms seek to manipulate earnings is identified...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} bias voltage and the {{presence}} of easily-ionized elements (EIEs) on the spatial distribution of excited-state atoms and ions of Cu, Ag, Cs and Ca in furnace atomization plasma emission spectrometry is presented. The dc bias of the centre electrode significantly affects the spatial distribution of He I, Cu I, Ag I, Cs I, and Ca II emission in the absence of EIEs. A reasonably uniform distribution of excited-state analyte atoms over the central cross-section of the tube occurs when the centre electrode is self-biased during the course of an atomization transient. A depleted area of Cs I emission around the centre electrode coupled with enhanced Ca II emission in the same region reveals that ionization of analytes is most pronounced in this region. With positive dc bias, concentric rings of enhanced emission occur between the centre electrode and the tube wall for analyte atoms and the He I plasma gas, although the <b>overall</b> <b>breadth</b> of analyte emission distribution is decreased. With NaCl, NaNO 3 and CsCl serving as EIEs, analyte emission from Ag I, Cu I and Ca II in the region between the centre electrode and the tube wall is strongly suppressed with self-bias. The degree of the suppression depends on the extent of vapour cloud overlap between analyte and EIE. In general, equimolar amounts of NaNO 3 and CsCl suppress analyte emission similarly and both produce a greater suppression than NaCl. Equal amounts of Fe, added as an interfering matrix, produces a suppression of analyte emission similar to that of EIEs, suggesting that the primary cause of suppression is the loss of energy from the plasma (as photons) due to excitation and ionization of matrix vapour. Control of the dc bias enhances the radial distribution of excited analyte atoms in the presence of EIEs and Fe, but only at low (2 ̆ 2642 5 g) interferent loadings.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{characterization}} of HIV- 1 -specific T cell responses in people infected with locally circulating HIV- 1 strain will facilitate {{the development of}} HIV- 1 vaccine. Sixty intravenous drug users infected with HIV- 1 circulating recombinant form 07 _BC (CRF 07 _BC), which has been spreading rapidly in western China from north to south, were recruited from Xinjiang, China to assess the HIV- 1 -specific T cell responses at single peptide level with overlapping peptides (OLP) covering the whole concensus clades B and C proteome. Results The median of the total magnitude and total number of OLPs recognized by CTL responses were 10925 SFC/million PBMC and 25 OLPs, respectively, when tested by clade C peptides, which {{was significantly higher than}} when tested by clade B peptides. The immunodominant regions, which cover 14 % (58 / 413) of the HIV- 1 proteome, are widely distributed throughout the HIV- 1 proteome except in Tat, Vpu and Pol-PR, with Gag, Pol-RT, Pol-Int and Nef being most frequently targeted. The subdominant epitopes are mostly located in p 24, Nef, integrase, Vpr and Vif. Of the responses directed to clade C OLPs, 61. 75 % (972 / 1574) can be observed when tested with corresponding clade B OLPs. However, Pol-PR and Vpu tend to be targeted in the clade B sequence rather than the clade C sequence, which is in line with the recombinant pattern of CRF 07 _BC. Stronger and broader CTL responses in subjects with CD 4 cell counts ranging from 200 to 400 /mm 3 were observed when compared to those with less than 200 /mm 3 or more than 400 /mm 3, though there have been no significant correlations identified between the accumulative CTL responses or <b>overall</b> <b>breadth</b> and CD 4 cell count or plasma viral load. Conclusion This is the first study conducted to comprehensively address T cell responses in Chinese subjects infected with HIV- 1 CRF 07 _BC in which subtle differences in cross-reactivity were observed, though similar patterns of overall immune responses were demonstrated with clade B infected populations. The immunodominant regions identified in this population can facilitate future HIV- 1 vaccine development in China. </p...|$|R
40|$|Spatial and {{temporal}} variations {{in patterns of}} niche breadth and feeding overlap were investigated for the fish fauna in the Pantanal region, aiming to determine the factors that account for species coexistence. Samples were conducted in the Cuiabá River and Chacororé pond, in the upper Pantanal region, Mato Grosso State, Brazil, during one hydrological cycle (March 2000 to February 2001), (designed spatial-seasonal units). Mean niche <b>breadth</b> values were <b>overall</b> low for the fish assemblage (0. 2 - 0. 3). Differences between periods were not statistically significant. Feeding overlap values ranged between 0 and 0. 4, whereas the mean was always inferior to 0. 05 in all spatial-temporal units, and differences between periods were not statistically significant. The highest and lowest mean values were both observed in the pond; the former during the drought period and the latter during the flood period. All feeding overlap mean values {{were significantly higher than}} the values expected at random in the null model, using both "scrambled-zeros" (RA 3) and "conserved-zeros" (RA 4) algorithms. Thus, the foraging patterns show evidences of food sharing. The variance generated in the null model had a pattern similar to the niche overlap pattern: observed variance was higher than expected by chance in all spatial-temporal units, suggesting that the fish fauna is structured in trophic guilds. The patterns of food resource use and the different trophic guilds identified, suggest that species probably have different roles in this ecosystem. Our results suggest that food sharing allows coexistence of different fish species. Foram investigadas variações espaço-temporais nos padrões de amplitude de nicho e sobreposição alimentar da ictiofauna de uma região do Pantanal, com o objetivo de determinar os fatores responsáveis pela coexistência das espécies. Os peixes foram coletados no rio Cuiabá e na lagoa Chacororé, na região superior do Pantanal de Mato Grosso, Brasil, durante um ciclo hidrológico (março de 2000 a fevereiro de 2001) (designada unidade espaço-temporal). De modo geral, a ictiofauna apresentou baixos valores de amplitude de nicho trófico, sendo que as médias variaram entre 0, 2 e 0, 3 e não apresentaram diferenças significativas. Os valores de sobreposição alimentar foram igualmente baixos, entre 0 e 0, 4 e as medianas em cada unidade espaço-temporal foram inferiores a 0, 05, sendo que as diferenças não foram significativas. Os maiores e menores valores médios foram observados na lagoa, durante a seca e cheia, respectivamente, sendo essas diferenças significativas. Os valores médios de sobreposição alimentar foram significativamente maiores do que os esperados ao acaso no modelo nulo, usando tanto a opção de zeros embaralhados (RA 3) quanto a de zeros retidos (RA 4). Assim, os padrões de forrageamento das espécies mostraram evidência de compartilhamento de recursos alimentares. A variância acompanhou o mesmo padrão da sobreposição de nicho, sendo aquela observada sempre maior que a esperada ao acaso, indicando que a ictiofauna, de modo geral, é estruturada em guildas. Assim, os resultados desse estudo sugerem que o compartilhamento de recursos alimentares permite a coexistência das diferentes espécies...|$|R
