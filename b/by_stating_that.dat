When asked about his role in authorizing the arms deals, he first stated that he had; later, he appeared to contradict himself <b>by</b> <b>stating</b> <b>that</b> he had no recollection of doing so.

5|$|A {{conservative}} Washington D.C. think tank, and a Republican {{member of}} Congress, among others, {{have claimed that}} Gore has a conflict-of-interest for advocating for taxpayer subsidies of green-energy technologies {{in which he has}} a personal investment. Additionally, he has been criticized for his above-average energy consumption in using private jets, and in owning multiple, very large homes, one of which was reported in 2007 as using high amounts of electricity. Gore's spokesperson responded <b>by</b> <b>stating</b> <b>that</b> the Gores use renewable energy which is more expensive than regular energy and that the Tennessee house in question has been retrofitted to make it more energy-efficient.|$|E
5|$|Claiming the General Assembly's {{decision}} was invalid, Taylor sued to prevent Beckham from exercising {{the authority of}} the governor's office. Beckham countersued Taylor for possession of the state capitol and governor's mansion. The suits were consolidated and heard in Jefferson County circuit court, which claimed it had no authority to interfere with the method of deciding contested elections prescribed by the state constitution, an outcome that favored Beckham. The Kentucky Court of Appeals upheld the circuit court's decision on appeal and rejected Taylor's claim that he had been deprived of property without due process <b>by</b> <b>stating</b> <b>that</b> an elective office was not property and thus not protected by the Fourteenth Amendment.|$|E

The remainder were given away. Some sites believe this may violate Nintendo's enforcement of the Wii's $249 retail price, and may prevent the store from receiving future products from Nintendo.

5|$|The {{scene in}} which Veronica rebuffs Logan for {{sleeping}} with Madison over winter break {{was the subject of}} a continuing debate in the writers' room about Veronica's character.

Arne Wam responded <b>by</b> <b>stating</b> <b>that</b> NSB wanted to liquidate the company. NSB therefore offered to purchase all shares in the company at par value, despite the company not having any net assets.|$|E

Servatius challenged Eichmann's kidnapping and {{the basis for the}} Israeli law under which he had been indicted. He argued that if the trial were to continue, it should transfer its jurisdiction to West Germany. The prosecution countered <b>by</b> <b>stating</b> <b>that</b> the United Nations had endorsed Israel's actions, and that both West Germany and Argentina had agreed that the charges against him were legitimate. The defence motion was subsequently dismissed.|$|E
5|$|As a spouse, surgeon, and mother, Meredith has cited {{a number}} times {{that she did}} not want to be like either of her parents: her father had {{followed}} her mother around pathetically before leaving to be happy, while her mother valued her career over her family. Meredith is frequently conflicted trying to balance between the two, and fears her family are hindering her medical aspirations, as much as she fears becoming like her mother whenever she's tempted to choose surgery over family. Meredith and Cristina have a huge rift when Cristina confirms Meredith's fears <b>by</b> <b>stating</b> <b>that</b> Meredith's skills have fallen behind Cristina's due to her familial obligations taking her away from OR time.|$|E

Seeing a suspicious gust of wind, Daenerys rides out alone. As Daario prepares to follow her, Drogon flies over the khalasar, with Daenerys riding on his back. Daenerys proceeds to rally the Dothraki <b>by</b> <b>stating</b> <b>that</b> she chooses them all to be her bloodriders, rather than the traditional three chosen by Khals. She then asks if they will cross the sea with her and help her retake the Seven Kingdoms, which they unanimously agree to do.|$|E

As the squad left for the finals in Argentina, they were given an enthusiastic send-off as they were paraded around a packed Hampden Park. Thousands more fans lined the route to Prestwick Airport as the team set off for South America. Scotland's first game was against Peru in Córdoba. Two spectacular goals by Teófilo Cubillas meant that {{the result was a}} 3–1 loss. The second game was a very disappointing 1–1 draw against Iran. The disconsolate mood of the nation was reflected by footage of Ally MacLeod in the dugout with his head in his hands.|$|E

The upheaval at the club {{was not limited to}} change in the management team, with a number of first team players being linked to moves away from Carrow Road, including Robert Snodgrass, Gary Hooper and John Ruddy.

A plan to hold a reenactment of the battle itself (as well as a reenactment of the subsequent French victory of 1760 at the Battle of Sainte-Foy) was cancelled due to threats of public disorder. Leaders of separatist parties described the event as {{a slap in the}} face for Quebecers of French ancestry and as an insult for the francophone majority. Some sovereigntist groups threatened or made indirect threats <b>by</b> <b>stating</b> <b>that</b> if the event took place, there could be violence.

5|$|The Bhagavata Purana, the Vishnu Purana and the Devi Bhagavata Purana enlist and {{describe}} 28 hells; however, they end the description <b>by</b> <b>stating</b> <b>that</b> {{there are hundreds}} and thousands of hells.

The Devi Bhagavata Purana agrees with the Bhagavata Purana in most of names; however, a few names are slightly different. Taptasurmi, Ayahpana, Raksogana-bhojana, Avata-nirodhana, Paryavartana are replaced by Taptamurti, Apahpana, Raksogana-sambhoja, Avatarodha, Paryavartanataka respectively.

5|$|The Singapore-based Indian Movie News {{stated in}} 1957 that when Ganesan heard of Vasan's {{attempt to make}} a film {{adaptation}} on Kattabomman, he personally requested that he abandon the project; Vasan assented, and lent Ganesan important research materials on Kattabomman. Film historian Randor Guy contradicted this in his 1997 book Starlight, Starbright: The Early Tamil Cinema <b>by</b> <b>stating</b> <b>that</b> writers like Kothamangalam Subbu and Veppathur Kittoo were employed by Vasan to conduct extensive research on Kattabomman's life, but the only eligible choice to portray Kattabomman was Ganesan, who by then had become popular after Parasakthi (1952). Guy noted that Ganesan was hesitant to take up the role under Vasan's direction as he was earlier rejected by him for the role of a bodyguard in Chandralekha (1948), leading to Vasan dropping the project. But later on, Ganesan acted in Irumbu Thirai (1960), which was produced and directed by Vasan, and Motor Sundaram Pillai (1966), which was produced by him.|$|E

When Bonnie, Lois and Cleveland's new girlfriend come to dance at The Drunken Clam, they state {{that they would}} like to make the bar their place to hang out, after Peter grabs Joe's gun and kills himself. It turns out that this was only Peter's imagination as he snaps out of it when Joe starts talking to him; Peter answers that he was having a Scrubs fantasy moment. Quagmire responds to Peter's moment <b>by</b> <b>stating</b> <b>that</b> Scrubs is the best show people are not watching. Cleveland replies that he hates shows that leave the story for a gag or joke, referring to the numerous cutaways Scrubs and Family Guy contain. While in the hospital Peter realizes that Mr. Pewterschmidt and Dr. Hartman have a similar voice, then Mr. Pewterschmidt comes into the room and they both start talking about how their voices sound alike; this is a reference to the show's creator Seth MacFarlane as he voices both characters.|$|E
