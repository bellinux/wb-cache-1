50|$|Liquidity {{is a prime}} {{concern in}} a <b>banking</b> <b>environment</b> and a {{shortage}} of liquidity has often been a trigger for bank failures. Holding assets in a highly liquid form tends to reduce the income from that asset (cash, for example, is the most liquid asset of all but pays no interest) so banks will try to reduce liquid assets as far as possible. However, a bank without sufficient liquidity {{to meet the demands}} of their depositors risks experiencing a bank run. The result is that most banks now try to forecast their liquidity requirements and maintain emergency standby credit lines at other banks. Banking regulators also view liquidity as a major concern.|$|E

While the transactions themselves are widely considered to be safe, iDEAL transactions could technically be regarded as cash payments between customers and suppliers, to which the bank is no party and offers no insurance. This means that iDEAL payments cannot be reversed when, for example, a webshop fails to deliver. If a user suspects fraud, their only option to get paid money back, is to make a case with their bank, in which the burden of proof lies with the customer and results are unsure. For purchases from untrusted suppliers, other methods of payment can have benefits.|$|E

50|$|In either event, {{within the}} United States {{mortgage}} system, virtually all loans are sold into the securities markets, {{and the cost}} of operating a financial business is real. The political climate of the United States is such that it encourages the continuous expansion of home ownership opportunity, and {{the most efficient way to}} do that is through direct lending in the neighborhoods, person to person. In this capacity, the brokerage community exceeds beyond all others, and originates the vast majority of the home loans in the United States without predetermined minimum lending criteria or standards as in a retail <b>banking</b> <b>environment.</b> For this reason, mortgage brokers will tend to spend much more time securing or attempting to secure financing for borrowers for which there will not be any compensation in the event they do not succeed and many times will cause a loss to the business. Retail banks avoid this possibility through other forms of revenue from the same potential borrowers they turn down through the offering of other services and associated fees.|$|E
5000|$|The Alternative Bank Switzerland (ABS) is the {{everyday}} banking {{for those who}} want to know what is happening with their money and how it can make even good work declares the bank. It was founded in 1990 by several organisations, a union, various charities, among them Greenpeace Switzerland and World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF), and also initiated by the Erklärung von Bern (EvB, renamed [...] "Public Eye" [...] in 2016) association. Since 1990 the ABS has evolved from an alternative operation with a few people to a hierarchically structured company with departments and supervisors. The bank had also to say goodbye to some ideals, so it could not support people that make no money, just because they have a ‹good ethological opinion›. As some years ago, some cooperatively organized enterprises got in bankruptcy after the founding, it was sobering for the bank's staff. ABS survived this turmoil without saying goodbye to their core values. Regardless, the ABS shares in today's <b>banking</b> <b>environment</b> continuously gained value, so sustainability is expressed also in sustainable growth.|$|E
