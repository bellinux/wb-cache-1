5|$|Health care {{delivery}} in Nigeria is a concurrent {{responsibility of the}} three tiers of government in the country, and the private sector. Nigeria has been reorganising its health system since the <b>Bamako</b> Initiative of 1987, which formally promoted community-based methods of increasing accessibility of drugs and health care services to the population, in part by implementing user fees. The new strategy dramatically increased accessibility through community-based healthcare reform, resulting in more efficient and equitable provision of services.|$|E

50|$|In early 2012, the National Movement for the Liberation of Azawad {{and other}} militant groups {{opposed to the}} {{government}} of Mali swept through the region, entering Timbuktu without a fight after making a deal with local Arab militias. On 6 April 2012, the region was declared independent from Mali as part of the new country of Azawad. However, Mali refused to acknowledge the Azawadi Declaration of Independence, and the international community continues to recognise <b>Bamako's</b> claim to the region.|$|R
5|$|The colony {{supported}} mostly rain-fed agriculture, {{with limited}} irrigation {{for its first}} 30 years. The only cash crops were nuts gathered close to the railroad between Kayes and <b>Bamako.</b> However, following successful tests of growing Egyptian cotton in West Africa during World War I, Émile Bélime began to campaign {{for the construction of}} a large irrigation system along the Niger river. Starting in 1921, significant irrigation projects around Koulikoro and later at Baguinéda-Camp and the Ségou Cercle began to bring water. The French believed this project could rival the major cotton growing centers of Egypt and the United States.|$|E
5|$|In August 1990 the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) {{despatched}} {{a peacekeeping}} force, ECOMOG, to Liberia.

By the time ECOMOG arrived, Prince Johnson's INPFL and Taylor's NPFL were fighting on the outside bounds of the port. A series of peacemaking conferences in regional capitals followed. There were meetings in <b>Bamako</b> in November 1990, Lome in January 1991, and Yamoussoukro in June–October 1991. The first seven peace conferences, including the Yamoussoukro I-IV processes and the Carter Center negotiation leading to the Cotonou Accords, failed {{due to lack of}} agreement between the warring factions. The NPFL launched an assault on Monrovia in 1992, which they named 'Operation Octopus.' The civil war lasted until the Abuja Accords of August 1996.|$|E

40|$|The Sahel is {{a crisis}} polygon. Following the French {{intervention}} in Mali in 2013, this vast and sparsely inhabited region has seen the gradual resurgence and the realignment of jihadist armed groups that have extended their operational range further south – across northwest African borders, where they interfere in and interact with already existing conflicts – and increased the challenges for regional stability. Growing levels of insecurity and banditry, partly triggered also by <b>Bamako’s</b> playing realignment and repositioning games among local groups, are ultimately beneficial to jihadists. By sitting on the fence, jihadists can appear as an effective alternative source of assistance, protection and dispute resolution – both political and economic – to disempowered segments of the population...|$|R

5000|$|Under the old constitution, all {{labor unions}} had {{to belong to}} one confederation, the National Union of Malian Workers (UNTM). When the {{leadership}} of the UNTM broke from the government in 1990, the opposition grew. In part this was a reaction to the stalling of Traoré's [...] "Multiparisme" [...] program, announced in October 1989 but then shelved. These groups were driven by paycuts and layoffs in the government sector, and the Malian government acceding to pressure from international donors to privatise large swathes of the economy that had remained in public hands even after Keita's overthrow in 1968. Students, even children, played an increasing role in <b>Bamako's</b> protest marches, and homes and businesses of those associated with the regime were ransacked by crowds.|$|R
50|$|The Communications & Advocacy Program aims {{to bring}} health {{education}} to the masses and incite relevant and productive discussions about health topics that directly affect communities. Mali Health employs a number of media to generate these discussions. Health Radio (included in Sustainia's 2014 list of 100 of the most sustainable solutions to community development) mobilizes community members around health and promotes health education and prevention. The show is broadcast by local announcers on <b>Bamako’s</b> most popular radio station, which serves one million listeners weekly. The show provides independent coverage of community health challenges and success stories on issues including malaria prevention, prenatal care, and illegal dumping in public spaces. Mali Health also organizes public events to capture community attention and engage local residents in conversations about the most pressing health concerns they face.|$|R

Foreign observers, however, endorsed the election as free and fair. Results reported from 28 out of 49 areas showed Touré with 72% of the vote, while Keïta had 15%. On 2 May results accounting for 51% of registered voters (including many who did not vote) showed Touré still holding a large lead with 58.3% of the vote against 25% for Keïta.|$|R
2500|$|France's Communications Director and Chief Spokesperson at the Central Administration Bernard Valero said: [...] "France condemns the {{deliberate}} {{destruction of the}} tombs of Muslim saints {{in the city of}} Timbuktu by an Islamist extremist group which controls this city. We appeal for an end to this violence and this intolerance. The systematic violation of these places of reverence and prayer, which for centuries {{have been part of the}} soul of this famed sub-Saharan city, constitutes an intolerable act." [...] The Russia Foreign Ministry condemned the action as [...] "barbarian. Such acts can only arouse indignation." [...] The United States' State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland also added that [...] "the United States strongly condemns the destruction of the UNESCO world heritage sites in Timbuktu by Islamic militants. We call on all parties to protect Mali's heritage." [...] Namibian President Hifikepunye Pohamba said at the General debate of the sixty-seventh session of the United Nations General Assembly that he rejected the attempt to secede, as well as the wanton destructions of the sites. Prime Minister Cheick Modibo Diarra also called for an immediate international intervention to restore <b>Bamako's</b> writ; he was supported by Niger. It was also affirmed at the same forum by Ivory Coast, who had a similar external intervention during the 2010–2011 Ivorian crisis, and former imperial overlord France's Francois Hollande who supported an African intervention.|$|R
40|$|This is an author's peer-reviewed final manuscript, as {{accepted}} by the publisher. The published article is copyrighted by Elsevier {{and can be found}} at: [URL] land acquisitions are transforming long-standing human-land relations in West Africa. In particular, high rates of urban population growth lead to the transfer of land from non-market customary tenure systems to market-based, formal land tenure regimes on the edges of cities. The literature suggests that the conversion process from inalienable land to private property is highly contested, locally specific, and historically contingent. However, little is known about how this process affects a community. In the Kati cercle on <b>Bamako’s</b> peri-urban eastern edge with exponential growth in land registration, this village case study examines: (1) how residents secure livelihoods, and (2) how the advent of a land market affects livelihood strategies. Interviews conducted in 2011 in the village of Soro complement data collected in 1996 and 1987. The longitudinal data show increases in population as well as indicators of relatively stable livelihood strategies. Since 2001 only men in the chieftancy lineage and families close to it have sold land, and that land was of least value to them using the subsistence logic of grain production. Those authorizing land sales at the local level are also the immediate beneficiaries. Land privatization reduces access to resources for those with secondary land rights recognized through social relations in a customary tenure system. This study concludes that public policy in areas undergoing land conversion [...] especially peri-urban areas [...] should consider the impact of social differentiation in communities and how new land values will change land use and access...|$|R
