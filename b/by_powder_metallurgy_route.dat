In {{order to understand the}} effect of matrix, reinforcement and secondary processing techniques on the microstructure development and mechanical properties of AlMCs produced <b>by</b> <b>powder</b> <b>metallurgy</b> <b>routes,</b> Al alloy composites reinforced with three types of reinforcements by different secondary processing techniques have been produced and examined. Fabrication of Al or 6061 Al alloy based composites reinforced with nano-sized SiC particles (~ 500 nm), micro-sized (After cold rolling, the evolution in microstructure, texture and strength has been analysed. A typical near β fibre texture with highest intensities near Copper and Brass orientations has been developed for 6061 Al/NQX and 6061 Al/Nb composites. For 6061 Al/SiC composites, a randomized texture with very small grains has achieved due to the presence of the non-deformable SiC particles. Mechanical property tests including microhardness, three-point bending tests and tensile tests have been carried out on cold rolled samples and the results exhibit some level of improvement when compared with as-extruded samples due to work hardening. Finally, the work moves on to the general discussion based on the previous result chapters. The microstructural development related to reinforcement, matrix and interfacial areas during extrusion and cold rolling has been summarised and the correlation between microstructure and mechanical properties has been discussed.
