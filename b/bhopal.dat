5|$|Bhopal: A Prayer for Rain is a 2014 {{historical}} drama film set {{amidst the}} <b>Bhopal</b> disaster {{that had occurred}} in India on 2–3 December 1984. It is directed by Ravi Kumar and features Martin Sheen, Mischa Barton, Kal Penn, Rajpal Yadav, Tannishtha Chatterjee, and Fagun Thakrar in important roles. Benjamin Wallfisch composed the film's music. Kumar got {{the idea of making}} a film based on the <b>Bhopal</b> disaster after he read a book based on it. Shot over a period of 18 months, it was originally slated for a late 2010 release. However, the lack of responses from distributors kept on delaying the release.|$|E
5|$|Mountbatten {{stressed}} {{that he would}} act as the trustee of the princes' commitment, as he would be serving as India's head of state well into 1948. He engaged in a personal dialogue with reluctant princes, such as the Nawab of <b>Bhopal,</b> who he asked through a confidential letter to sign the Instrument of Accession making <b>Bhopal</b> part of India, which Mountbatten would keep locked up in his safe. It would be handed to the States Department on 15 August only if the Nawab did not change his mind before then, which {{he was free to}} do. The Nawab agreed, and did not renege over the deal.|$|E
5|$|In 1984, a {{few months}} before the disaster, Dilip (Rajpal Yadav), a {{rickshaw}} driver, loses his pay source as his rickshaw breaks down while transporting an employee to the Union Carbide pesticide plant in <b>Bhopal.</b> Dilip lives in the slums around the plant with his wife, a son and his sister. He gets a job in the plant as a labourer, and is happy since his daily wage is restored.|$|E
5|$|The {{rulers of}} the princely states were not uniformly {{enthusiastic}} about integrating their domains into independent India. Some, such as the rulers of Bikaner and Jawhar, were motivated to join India out of ideological and patriotic considerations, but others insisted {{that they had the}} right to join either India or Pakistan, to remain independent, or form a union of their own. <b>Bhopal,</b> Travancore and Hyderabad announced that they did not intend to join either dominion. Hyderabad went as far as to appoint trade representatives in European countries and commencing negotiations with the Portuguese to lease or buy Goa to give it access to the sea, and Travancore pointed to the strategic importance to western countries of its thorium reserves while asking for recognition. Some states proposed a subcontinent-wide confederation of princely states, as a third entity in addition to India and Pakistan. <b>Bhopal</b> attempted to build an alliance between the princely states and the Muslim League to counter the pressure being put on rulers by the Congress.|$|E
5|$|Mountbatten {{believed}} that securing the states' accession to India {{was crucial to}} reaching a negotiated settlement with the Congress for the transfer of power. As a relative of the British King, he was trusted {{by most of the}} princes and was a personal friend of many, especially the Nawab of <b>Bhopal,</b> Hamidullah Khan. The princes also {{believed that}} he would {{be in a position to}} ensure that independent India adhered to any terms that might be agreed upon, because Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and Patel had asked him to become the first Governor General of the Dominion of India.|$|E
5|$|On 2 December 2016, Jet Airways flight 9W7083 from <b>Bhopal</b> to Mumbai {{was held}} up by {{a large group of}} {{passengers}} headed for a marriage in Mumbai. There were allegations from other passengers that the wedding party was politically connected and attempted to coerce the cabin crew to disembark passengers, so that additional members of their party could be accommodated. The airline claimed it was a technical glitch in their booking system which led to overbooking.|$|E
5|$|The club accepts {{sponsorship}} {{but does}} not allow sponsors' logos to be displayed on the team's shirts. The club's main sponsor in its inaugural 2005–06 season was the <b>Bhopal</b> Medical Appeal and in the 2006–07 season it was the Williams BMW Group. Between 2011–2016, F.C. United were sponsored by mxData, a Manchester-based mobile app development company. In October 2014, F.C. United became the first football club in the United Kingdom to be accredited as a living wage employer by the Living Wage Foundation.|$|E
5|$|Although the Merger Agreements were principally {{intended}} for smaller, non-viable states, {{they were also}} applied to a few larger states. Kutch in western India, and Tripura and Manipur in Northeast India, all of which lay along international borders, {{were also asked to}} sign Merger Agreements, despite being larger states, following which they became Chief Commissioners' Provinces. <b>Bhopal,</b> whose ruler was proud of the efficiency of his administration and feared that it would lose its identity if merged with the Maratha states that were its neighbours, also became a directly administered Chief Commissioner's Province, as did Bilaspur, much of which was likely to be flooded on completion of the Bhakra dam.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} factors contributed to the {{collapse}} of this initial resistance and to nearly all non-Muslim majority princely states agreeing to accede to India. An important factor was the lack of unity among the princes. The smaller states did not trust the larger states to protect their interests, and many Hindu rulers did not trust Muslim princes, in particular Hamidullah Khan, the Nawab of <b>Bhopal</b> and a leading proponent of independence, whom they viewed as an agent for Pakistan. Others, believing integration to be inevitable, sought to build bridges with the Congress, hoping thereby to gain a say in shaping the final settlement. The resultant inability to present a united front or agree on a common position significantly reduced their bargaining power in negotiations with the Congress. The decision by the Muslim League {{to stay out of the}} Constituent Assembly was also fatal to the princes' plan to build an alliance with it to counter the Congress, and attempts to boycott the Constituent Assembly altogether failed on 28 April 1947, when the states of Baroda, Bikaner, Cochin, Gwalior, Jaipur, Jodhpur, Patiala and Rewa took their seats in the Assembly.|$|E
5|$|An annual {{gathering}} of followers, called ijtema, is summoned at {{headquarters of the}} respective countries. A typical ijtema continues {{for three days and}} ends with an exceptionally long prayer. These gatherings are considered moments of intense blessings by Tabligh Jamaat members and are known to attract members in excess of 2million in some countries. The oldest ijtema of the World started in <b>Bhopal,</b> capital city of Madhya Pradesh, India. It attracts people from all over World. Almost 2 million people gather for this annual gathering. The largest of such annual gatherings is held in Bangladesh. The Bengali gathering, called Bishwa Ijtema (World Gathering), converges followers from around the World in Tongi near Dhaka, Bangladesh, with an attendance exceeding 3million people. The second largest Tabligh Jamaat gathering takes place in Raiwind, Pakistan which was attended by approximately 1.5million people in 2004. In 2011 Pakistan divided the Ijtema into two parts and total 1 million People attended each of the two Ijtema.|$|E
5|$|The {{script was}} jointly written by Kumar and David Brooks Miller. In order {{to present the}} correct {{technical}} and medical facts in the film, Kumar analysed documents of the court proceedings, forensic evidences and interviewed several survivors of the tragedy and also the staff members of the Union Carbide plant. <b>Bhopal</b> Group for Information and Action and many activists fighting {{for the rights of}} the victim of the disaster wanted to stop the film's screening, called it an insult to the victims, blamed the filmmakers of distorting the facts related to the disaster, diverting attention from Dow Chemical Company which acquired Union Carbide in 2001 and for portraying Anderson as a person who wanted to help the people but was unable to do so. Sheen denied these allegations and said that he did not sympathise for Anderson. Kumar also denied these allegations and said that the organisations had seen an older script. He added that making the film was a life-changing experience for him. A Prayer for Rain was added to the film's title because had it rained on the night of 2—3 December 1984, fewer people would have died.|$|E

25|$|The {{court of}} <b>Bhopal</b> {{appointed}} Khan's younger son, Sultan Mohammad, as his successor. Sultan Mohammad Khan was 7 or 8-year-old at the time.
