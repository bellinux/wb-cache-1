25|$|In practice, {{it would}} be quite {{difficult}} to physiologically measure an individual's three cone responses to various physical color stimuli. Instead, a psychophysical approach is taken. Three specific <b>benchmark</b> <b>test</b> lights are typically used; let us call them S, M, and L. To calibrate human perceptual space, scientists allowed human subjects to try to match any physical color by turning dials to create specific combinations of intensities (I'S, I'M, I'L) for the S, M, and L lights, resp., until a match was found. This needed only to be done for physical colors that are spectral, since a linear combination of spectral colors will be matched by the same linear combination of their (I'S, I'M, I'L) matches. Note that in practice, often at least one of S, M, L would have to be added with some intensity to the physical test color, and that combination matched by a linear combination of the remaining 2 lights. Across different individuals (without color blindness), the matchings turned out to be nearly identical.|$|E

40|$|The recent {{popularity}} of <b>benchmark</b> <b>testing</b> has become {{closely tied to}} formative assessment. Formative assessment has traditionally focused on {{a process in which}} evidence elicited from classroom assessments is used to provide feedback to students and inform instructional correctives (McMillan, 2007 : 2010, Popham, 2008). However, accountability demands have led to widespread implementation of benchmark, interim, periodic, or quarterly testing at the school or district level that is often labeled “formative. ” Indeed, some in the testing industry believe that <b>benchmark</b> <b>testing</b> is formative assessment. For example, the definition of <b>benchmark</b> <b>testing</b> by the Regional Education Laboratory Mid-Atlantic is that “a benchmark assessment is a formative assessment” (Brown 2 ̆ 6 Coughlin, 2007, p. 2). However, as pointed out by Goertz, Olah, and Riggan (2009), research on the effectiveness of formative assessment has defined it as a practice that is “embedded within classroom instruction” (p 1). There is very little research that examines how <b>benchmark</b> <b>testing</b> data are used as formative assessment as defined by the classroom assessment literature (Goertz, et al.; Perie, Marion, 2 ̆ 6 Gong, 2009). The {{purpose of this study was}} to explore the extent to which teachers’ described using <b>benchmark</b> <b>testing</b> data in formative ways, to identify factors that support teachers; use of test results to enhance instruction and improve student learning, as well as to identify barriers hat may limit usage...|$|R
