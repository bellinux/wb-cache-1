5|$|David C. Parker in 2004 {{argued that}} {{manuscript}} was written later the 6th century, <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> {{small number of}} square letters, and the handwriting is not typical for the 6th century. Some letters were compressed (Μ, Δ, Ε), the bar over the letter Τ is short and the letter Υ is written in several ways. According to Parker the manuscript should be dated to the 7th century.|$|E
5|$|Since 1998, the mallard {{has been}} rated {{as a species}} of least concern on the IUCN Red List of Endangered Species. This is <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> large range–more than 20,000km2 (7700mi2)–and because its {{population}} is increasing, rather than declining by 30% over ten years or three generations and thus is not warranted a vulnerable rating. Also, the population size of the mallard is very large.|$|E
5|$|DMSO {{is widely}} used as an {{alternative}} to water <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> lower dielectric constant than water, and is less polar and so dissolves non-polar, hydrophobic substances more easily. It has a measurable pKa range of about 1 to 30. Acetonitrile is less basic than DMSO, and, so, in general, acids are weaker and bases are stronger in this solvent. Some pKa values at 25°C for acetonitrile (ACN) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) are shown in the following tables. Values for water are included for comparison.|$|E

5|$|Classification of Cryolophosaurus is {{difficult}} <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> mix of primitive and advanced characteristics. The femur has traits of early theropods, while the skull resembles much later {{species of the}} clade Tetanurae, like China's Sinraptor and Yangchuanosaurus. This led Paul Sereno et al. (1994) to place Cryolophosaurus in the taxon Allosauridae. Originally, Hammer and colleagues suspected that Cryolophosaurus might be a ceratosaur or even an early abelisaur, with some traits convergent with those of more advanced tetanurans, but ultimately concluded that it was itself the earliest known member of the tetanuran group. While a subsequent study by Hammer (along with Smith and Currie) again recovered Cryolophosaurus as a tetanuran, a later (2007) study by the same authors {{found that it was}} more closely related to Dilophosaurus and Dracovenator. Sterling Nesbitt et al. (2009), using the characters of Tawa found Cryolophosaurus to be a neither dilophosaurid nor averostran neotheropod but instead the sister group of a clade composed of dilophosaurids and averostrans. However, in 2012, Matthew Carrano found that Cryolophosaurus was a tetanuran, related to Sinosaurus, but unrelated to Dilophosaurus.|$|E
5|$|Sodium is a {{chemical}} element with symbolNa (from Latin natrium) and atomic number11. It is a soft, silvery-white, highly reactive metal. Sodium is an alkali metal, being in group 1 of the periodic table, <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> single electron in its outer shell that it readily donates, creating a positively charged ion—the Na+ cation. Its only stable isotope is 23Na. The free metal {{does not occur}} in nature, but must be prepared from compounds. Sodium is the sixth most abundant element in the Earth's crust, and exists in numerous minerals such as feldspars, sodalite and rock salt (NaCl). Many salts of sodium are highly water-soluble: sodium ions have been leached {{by the action of}} water from the Earth's minerals over eons, and thus sodium and chlorine are the most common dissolved elements by weight in the oceans.|$|E
5|$|The lightest {{mendelevium}} isotopes (245Md to 247Md) {{are mostly}} produced through bombardment of bismuth targets with heavy argon ions, while slightly heavier ones (248Md to 253Md) {{are produced by}} bombarding plutonium and americium targets with lighter ions of carbon and nitrogen. The most important and most stable isotopes {{are in the range}} from 254Md to 258Md and are produced through bombardment of einsteinium isotopes with alpha particles: einsteinium-253, -254, and -255 can all be used. 259Md is produced as a daughter of 259No, and 260Md can be produced in a transfer reaction between einsteinium-254 and oxygen-18. Typically, the most commonly used isotope 256Md is produced by bombarding either einsteinium-253 or -254 with alpha particles: einsteinium-254 is preferred when available <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> longer half-life and therefore {{can be used as a}} target for longer. Using available microgram quantities of einsteinium, femtogram quantities of mendelevium-256 may be produced.|$|E

5|$|Astatine's {{alpha decay}} {{energies}} {{follow the same}} trend as for other heavy elements. Lighter astatine isotopes have quite high energies of alpha decay, which become lower as the nuclei become heavier. Astatine-211 has a significantly higher energy than the previous isotope, <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> nucleus with 126 neutrons, and 126 is a magic number corresponding to a filled neutron shell. Despite having a similar half-life to the previous isotope (8.1hours for astatine-210 and 7.2hours for astatine-211), the alpha decay probability is much higher for the latter: 41.81% against only 0.18%. The two following isotopes release even more energy, with astatine-213 releasing the most energy. For this reason, it is the shortest-lived astatine isotope. Even though heavier astatine isotopes release less energy, no long-lived astatine isotope exists, because of the increasing role of beta decay (electron emission). This decay mode {{is especially important for}} astatine; as early as 1950 it was postulated that all isotopes of the element undergo beta decay. Beta decay modes have been found for all astatine isotopes except astatine-213, -214, -215, and -216m. Astatine-210 and lighter isotopes exhibit beta plus decay (positron emission), astatine-216 and heavier isotopes exhibit beta (minus) decay, and astatine-212 decays via both modes, while astatine-211 undergoes electron capture.|$|E
5|$|Since 1998, {{the black}} stork has been rated {{as a species}} ofleast concernon theIUCN Red Listof Endangered Species. This is <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> large range—more than 20,000km2(7,700mi2)—and because its {{population}} is thought not to have declined by 30% over ten years or three generations and thus is not a rapid enough decline to warrant a vulnerable rating. Even so, {{the state of the}} population overall is unclear, and although it is widespread, it is not abundant anywhere. Black stork numbers have declined for many years in western Europe, and the species has already been extirpated from Scandinavia. The population in India—a major wintering ground—is declining. Previously a regular winter visitor to the Mai Po Marshes, it is now seldom seen there, and appears to be in decline in China overall. Its habitat is changing rapidly in much of eastern Europe and Asia. Various conservation measures have been taken, including Wetlands International's Conservation Action Plan for African black storks, which focuses on improving the wintering conditions of the birds which breed in Europe. It is protected by the Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds (AEWA) and the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES).|$|E

25|$|LiH, {{especially}} lithium-7 deuteride, {{is a good}} moderator {{for nuclear}} reactors, because deuterium has a lower neutron absorption cross-section than aneutronic hydrogen, decreasing neutron absorption in a reactor. Lithium-7 is preferred for a moderator <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> lower neutron cross-section and also forms less tritium under neutron bombardment.|$|E
