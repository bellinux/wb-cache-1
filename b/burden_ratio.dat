30|$|The {{performance}} of drilling and blasting (rock fragmentation) {{is measured by}} fragmented space and particle size distribution of fragmented material. The particle size distribution {{is a function of}} the blast design and the specific explosive charge of each hole (Ouchterlony et al. 2017). Blasting design parameters (such as bench height, burden, spacing, explosive charge, etc.) affect the rock fragmentation size. Particle size of blasted material (1) increases if the burden to hole diameter ratio increases, (2) decreases if the spacing to <b>burden</b> <b>ratio</b> increases, (3) increases if stemming length to <b>burden</b> <b>ratio</b> increases, (4) decreases with the increase in explosive charge, and (5) decreases if bench height to <b>burden</b> <b>ratio</b> increases (Singh et al. 2016). The effect of drilling and blasting geometry on particle size distribution can be estimated by using mathematical modelling (Kecojevic and Komljenovic 2007).|$|E

As a result, the following points were elucidated: 1) Among the current living generations, the lifetime net <b>burden</b> <b>ratio</b> of the 0 -year-old generation is about 25 percentage points {{higher than that of}} the current 90 -year-old generation; 2) The lifetime net <b>burden</b> <b>ratio</b> of the future generations is about 31 percentage points higher than that of the 0 -year-old generation; 3) The net burden of the current generations would have to be increased in order to narrow the generational gap between the current generations and the future generations, which would inevitably lead to an expansion of the intragenerational gap of the current generations; and 4) In order to prevent conflict of interest between the current generations, in particular the younger generations and future generations, and at the same time, narrow the intergenerational gap, it is desirable to increase the income of the current generations, in particular that of the younger generations, by achieving a high economic growth rate and implementing macroeconomic policy management that would inhibit increase in the risk premium included in the interest rate...|$|E

40|$|Debt <b>burden</b> <b>ratio</b> as {{measured}} on the aggregate level {{does not give}} an adequate assessment of {{the ability of the}} household sector to repay its debt. The low level of financial deepening in Poland is primarily reflected in a low percentage of households that have been granted a loan. Therefore, the average debt burden for households, which have any debt outstandings could be much higher than the one measured on the aggregate level. If the debt is concentrated among groups of households with lower incomes, it can threat the financial stability in case of FX or interest rate shocks. Using the data from Polish Households Budget Survey we first define three different measures of debt burden and calculate its dispersion in time and distribution among income groups. We find that (1) the total debt service burden and loan service burden ratios are on lower levels than in other European countries and recently have not risen substantially, (2) the mortgage debt service <b>burden</b> <b>ratio</b> has been rapidly increasing {{in the last four years}} especially in lower income groups of households reaching in 2004 the 3 / 4 of the level noted in EU- 15. In comparison with EU it seems that the level of indebtedness of house- holds in Poland is on a secure level. However, we notice that the secure level of debt <b>burden</b> <b>ratio</b> is on a lower level in emerging market countries than in wealthier countries because of the higher share of basic living costs in total consumption expenditure. Therefore, the increasing levels of mortgage debt service ratios in lower-income groups could pose a potential threat to the financial stability in case of FX or interest rate shock. ...|$|E

Given {{the high degree}} of autocorrelation in ratings, we use estimators that yield consistent parameters in the presence of such correlation. The results show that rating changes for emerging market economies have been dominated by variables different from those suggested by the literature. We also conclude that some deterioration in the ratings was warranted during the recent crisis episodes in view of the behavior of economic fundamentals, but that the agencies overreacted for several key countries. We find evidence of a structural break: since the Asian crisis period, ratings have been influenced by reserves in relation to short-term debt.

30|$|The core {{issue of}} local {{government}} debt risk is the long-term and sustainable negative effect of fiscal deficit which manifests as local government debt. This therefore cannot form effective and sufficient fiscal income in the future, leading to the inability to maintain properly the performance of government function, ultimately making the fiscal operation unsustainable. The above shows that the rapid growth {{of local government}} debt and debt <b>burden</b> <b>ratio</b> beyond the warning line in some areas both indicate the presence of local government debt risks. It is necessary to be aware that if the local government debt risk explodes, it will not affect just one city or fiscal province, but under the special system relationship in China, it will also trigger a systemic fiscal, financial, and economic crisis throughout the country. From the perspective of lending, the expansion of local government debt comes from the soft constraint relationship in credit between local government and financial institutions (Liu 2013; Xie and Bai 2013); the local government debt risk will inevitably spread to the financial system. In addition, the single state structure of China also determines that the central government will become the “final paymaster” of local fiscal burden (Huang and Xu 2011; Miao and Fu 2015); the debt risk of local government will eventually evolve into the central fiscal risks. The study of Fu et al. (2013) also elaborated that local government debt risk in China will possibly trigger an economic crisis. Therefore, strengthening the prevention of local government debt risk is not only the key to running local fiscal sustainability, but also the important premise to ensure the systemic safety of the economy. However, the most important key is finding the origin of local government debt risk.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to assess the {{direction}} and magnitude of the relationship between levels of marital satisfaction and two main housing variables [...] the housing <b>burden</b> <b>ratio</b> and the amount of home equity. The influence that these variables have on levels of marital satisfaction was mediated and moderated by how satisfied couples were with their homes and their finances, as well as their perceived experience of economic pressure. The results ultimately provide insights that can improve both couple well-being and financial/housing situations by pinpointing factors that account for the variance in marital satisfaction. This study used existing data from the National Survey of Families and Households (NSFH). Although NSFH was collected in three longitudinal waves, this study used the second wave from 1992 as it contained the most complete information pertaining to research hypotheses. Approximately 5, 000 participants were included. Descriptive statistics and multiple regression analyses were used. One moderator and three mediating models were tested. Most of the sample (82 %) owned homes. Approximately one third of those homeowners had entirely paid off their mortgage balances. Participants were mostly White, and were 46 years old on average. Only married participants were included in this study. Median annual income per household was $ 47, 400 and the average housing cost burden was. 139. Results indicated that the relationship between housing burden and marital satisfaction was partially mediated by economic pressure. A full mediation model existed between percent equity, economic pressure, and marital satisfaction, but no other equity variables.

Global production of pharmacologically active compounds exceeds 100   000 tons annually, a proportion of which enters aquatic environments through patient use, improper medicine disposal, and production. These compounds are designed to have mode-of-action (MoA) effects on specific biological pathways, with potential to impact nontarget species. Here, we used MoA and trait-based approaches to quantify uptake and biological effects of fluoxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, in filter and deposit feeding marine worms (Hediste diversicolor). Worms exposed to 10 μg L(- 1), accumulated fluoxetine with a body burden over 270 times greater than exposure concentrations, resulting in ∼ 10 % increased coelomic fluid serotonin, a pharmacological effect. Observed effects included weight loss (up to 2 % at 500 μg L(- 1)), decreased feeding rate (68 % at 500 μg L(- 1)), and altered metabolism (oxygen consumption, ammonia excretion, and O/N from 10 μg L(- 1)). Bioconcentration of fluoxetine was dependent on route of uptake, with filter feeding worms experiencing up to 130 times greater body <b>burden</b> <b>ratios</b> and increased magnitudes of effects than deposit feeders, a trait-based sensitivity likely as a consequence of fluoxetine partitioning to sediment. This study highlights how novel approaches such as MoA and trait-based methods can supplement environmental risk assessments of pharmaceuticals.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Currently, the JAK 2 V 617 F allele {{quantification}} in Ph- MPN {{is performed}} on genomic DNA. However, compared to DNA, mRNA analysis may offer some advantages such as: 1) higher sensitivity; 2) inclusion of platelet mRNA; 3) mRNA transcriptional functionality. Therefore, we developed an absolute allele-specific RQ-PCR method to quantify JAK 2 WT, V 617 F and ABL (as housekeeping gene) transcript levels aiming to: 1) verify specificity and sensitivity of this assay; 2) evaluate whether gene expression levels correlate with disease phenotype and may mark disease progression (i. e. ET toward PV). METHODS: To construct reference curves, including five 10 -fold serial dilutions, two plasmid standards were manufactured to contain 150 bp of either JAK 2 WT and JAK 2 V 617 F cDNA sequence. To perform an allelic discrimination we used primers described by Merker et al (JMD, 2010) : reverse primers are complementary to the WT or the mutant cDNA sequence, respectively. Assay sensitivity {{was determined by}} serial 10 -fold dilutions of the K 562 (JAK 2 WT) and HEL (V 671 F homo) cell lines which were included in each experiment as negative and positive controls. RESULTS: We tested cDNA synthesized from peripheral blood buffy coat specimens of 48 MPN patients (16 PV; 25 ET, 7 PMF), 13 patients with secondary polycythemia (SP) and 23 healthy donors (CTRL). Respect to the qualitative PCR method (Baxter el al, Lancet 2005) our RQ-PCR assay shows a 100 % concordance rate in identifying {{the presence of the}} JAK 2 V 617 F. V 617 F mutation was detected in 16 / 16 PV (100 %), 19 / 25 ET (76 %) and 5 / 7 (71 %) PMF samples. The mean expression of JAK 2 WT allele, as absolute averaged copies+SEM was: healthy donors 12127 + 2181; SP 12244 + 2489; PV 4955 + 1642, WT ET 10876 + 1781; V 617 F ET 5693 + 830 and V 617 F PMF 3004 + 1442. Statistically significant differences were detected between CTRL and PV (p < 0. 005) and CTRL and V 617 F ET (p < 0. 005). The mean expression of V 617 F allele was PV 27107 + 12699, ET 6524 + 1877 and PMF 29464 + 14587. A significant difference was found comparing PV and ET (p < 0. 005) and ET and PMF (p < 0. 005). Respect to the allele burden quantitative assay (IPSOGEN), the mutational burden (V 617 F/(V 617 F+WT) ratio detected by our assay is significantly higher (59 % vs 36 % burden in RQ-PCR and IPSOGEN, respectively; p < 0. 005). Three ET patients progressed to PV phase. The sequential analysis of the mutational <b>burden</b> <b>ratio</b> at diagnosis and during disease progression showed an increase in one patient’s sample at both DNA and mRNA level. By contrast, in the remaining 2 cases the ratio remained constant at the DNA level, but significantly increased when the mRNA was analysed. CONCLUSION: Present data demonstrated that our method is as specific but more sensitive than the allele burden determination. In addition, the complementary determination of mRNA transcript levels may help in elucidate the pathogenetic mechanisms of the Ph- MPN diseases...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{evaluates the}} current status of global {{modeling}} of the organic aerosol (OA) in the troposphere and analyzes the differences between models as well as between models and observations. Thirty-one global chemistry/transport and general circulation models have participated in this intercomparison, in the framework of AeroCom phase II. The simulation of OA varies greatly between models in terms of the magnitude of primary emissions, secondary OA (SOA) formation, the number of OA species used (2 to 62), the complexity of OA parameterizations (gas-particle partitioning, chemical aging, multiphase chemistry, aerosol microphysics), and the OA physical, chemical and optical properties. The diversity of the global OA simulation results has increased since earlier AeroCom experiments, mainly due to the increasing complexity of the SOA parameterization in models, and the implementation of new, highly uncertain, OA sources. Diversity of over an order of magnitude exists in the modeled vertical distribution of OA that deserves a dedicated future study. Furthermore, although the OA / OC ratio depends on OA sources and atmospheric processing and is important for model evaluation against OA and OC observations, it is resolved only by few global models. The median global primary OA (POA) source strength is 56 Tg a − 1 (range 34 – 144 Tg a − 1) and the median secondary OA source strength (natural and anthropogenic) is 19 Tg a − 1 (range 13 – 121 Tg a − 1). Among the models that take into account the semi-volatile SOA nature, the median source is calculated to be 51 Tg a − 1 (range 16 – 121 Tg a − 1), much larger than the median value of the models that calculate SOA in a more simplistic way (19 Tg a − 1; range 13 – 20 Tg a − 1, with one model at 37 Tg a − 1). The median atmospheric burden of OA is 1. 4 Tg (24 models in the range of 0. 6 – 2. 0 Tg and 4 between 2. 4 – 3. 8 Tg) with a median OA lifetime of 5. 4 days (range 3. 8 – 9. 6 days). In models that reported both OA and sulfate burdens, the median value of the OA / sulfate <b>burden</b> <b>ratio</b> of is calculated to be 0. 77; 13 models calculate a ratio lower than 1, and 9 models higher than 1. For 26 models that reported OA deposition fluxes, the median wet removal is 70 Tg a − 1 (range 28 – 209 Tg a − 1), which is on average 85 % of the total OA deposition. Fine aerosol organic carbon (OC) and OA observations from continuous monitoring networks and individual field campaigns have been used for model evaluation. At urban locations the model-observation comparison indicates missing knowledge on anthropogenic OA sources, both strength and seasonality. The combined model/measurements analysis suggests the existence of increased OA levels during summer due to biogenic SOA formation over large areas of the USA that can be of the same order of magnitude as the POA, even at urban locations, and contribute to the measured urban seasonal pattern. Global models are able to simulate the high secondary character of OA observed in the atmosphere as a result of SOA formation and of POA aging, although, the amount of OA present in the atmosphere remains largely underestimated, with a mean normalized bias (MNB) equal to − 0. 62 (− 0. 51) based on the comparison against OC (OA) urban data of all models at surface, − 0. 15 (+ 0. 51) when compared with remote measurements, and − 0. 30 for marine locations with OC data. The correlations overall are low when comparing with OC (OA) measurements: 0. 47 (0. 52) for urban stations, 0. 39 (0. 37) for remote, and 0. 25 for marine stations with OC data. The combination of high (negative) MNB and higher correlation at urban stations when compared with the low MNB and lower correlation at remote sites suggests that the knowledge about the processes, on top of the sources, are important at the remote stations. There is no clear change in model skill with increasing model complexity with regard to OC or OA mass concentration. However, the complexity is needed in models in order to separate between anthropogenic and natural OA and accurately calculate the impact of OA on climate...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} issue of the fiscal burden of {{population}} aging in Canada over the period from 2004 to 2026 by introducing a new methodological tool and using an approach that (a) is comprehensive with respect to government revenues and expenditures, (b) uses a fine disaggregation of government revenues and expenditures, and (c) integrates demographic, economic, and fiscal developments. The results indicate that the concerns about the ability of the existing fiscal system to withstand the pressures of population aging are unfounded. They indicate that, {{in the absence of an}} economic collapse, the existing fiscal structure will be able to handle the fiscal pressures of population aging. Instead of letting a nonexistent problem drive the course of fiscal policy in Canada, it would be more profitable to focus on avenues for making the fiscal structure a more effective tool for economic growth and human development.
