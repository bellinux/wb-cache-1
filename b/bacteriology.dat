5|$|Ferdinand Cohn {{is said to}} be {{a founder}} of <b>bacteriology,</b> {{studying}} bacteria from 1870. Cohn was the first to classify bacteria based on their morphology.|$|E
5|$|In <b>bacteriology,</b> NAD, {{sometimes}} referred to factor V, is used a supplement to culture media for some fastidious bacteria.|$|E
5|$|Classification {{seeks to}} {{describe}} the diversity of bacterial species by naming and grouping organisms based on similarities. Bacteria can be classified {{on the basis of}} cell structure, cellular metabolism or on differences in cell components, such as DNA, fatty acids, pigments, antigens and quinones. While these schemes allowed the identification and classification of bacterial strains, it was unclear whether these differences represented variation between distinct species or between strains of the same species. This uncertainty was {{due to the lack of}} distinctive structures in most bacteria, as well as lateral gene transfer between unrelated species. Due to lateral gene transfer, some closely related bacteria can have very different morphologies and metabolisms. To overcome this uncertainty, modern bacterial classification emphasises molecular systematics, using genetic techniques such as guanine cytosine ratio determination, genome-genome hybridisation, as well as sequencing genes that have not undergone extensive lateral gene transfer, such as the rRNA gene. Classification of bacteria is determined by publication in the International Journal of Systematic <b>Bacteriology,</b> and Bergey's Manual of Systematic <b>Bacteriology.</b> The International Committee on Systematic <b>Bacteriology</b> (ICSB) maintains international rules for the naming of bacteria and taxonomic categories and for the ranking of them in the International Code of Nomenclature of Bacteria.|$|E
5|$|Like biochemistry, the {{overlapping}} disciplines of <b>bacteriology</b> and virology (later combined as microbiology), situated {{between science and}} medicine, developed rapidly in the early 20th century. Félix d'Herelle's isolation of bacteriophage during World War I initiated {{a long line of}} research focused on phage viruses and the bacteria they infect.|$|E
5|$|The only {{memorial}} {{created by}} the Commission that {{was not in the}} form of a monument or cemetery was the Opththalmic Institute at Giza, Egypt—complete with library, and <b>bacteriology</b> and pathology departments—as its memorial to men of the Egyptian Labour Corps and Camel Transport Corps. Its erection was agreed with local political pressure.|$|E
5|$|Advances in <b>bacteriology</b> in the 20th century {{increased}} {{the sophistication of}} possible bio-agents in war. Biological sabotage—in the form of anthrax and glanders—was undertaken {{on behalf of the}} Imperial German government during World War I, with indifferent results. In World War II, Britain weaponised tularemia, anthrax, brucellosis, and botulism toxins, but never used them.|$|E
5|$|From the University of Maryland, Faber {{earned a}} B.S. in 1926, a M.S. in 1928, and a Ph.D. in <b>bacteriology</b> in 1937. In 1945, he was {{appointed}} {{the head of his}} alma mater's Department of Microbiology, a position he held for 18 years. During World War II, Faber joined the United States Army and served from 1942 to 1946, attaining the rank of major. He spent three years working at the Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington, D.C.|$|E
5|$|Significant discoveries {{relating}} to nitrogen assimilation and metabolism, including ammonification, nitrification and nitrogen fixation (the uptake of atmospheric nitrogen by symbiotic soil microorganisms) {{had to wait}} for advances in chemistry and <b>bacteriology</b> in the late 19th century and this was followed in the early 20th century by the elucidation of protein and amino-acid synthesis and their role in plant metabolism. With this knowledge it was then possible to outline the global nitrogen cycle.|$|E
5|$|Up {{through the}} 19th century, {{the scope of}} biology was largely divided between medicine, which {{investigated}} questions of form and function (i.e., physiology), and natural history, which was concerned with the diversity of life and interactions among different forms of life and between life and non-life. By 1900, much of these domains overlapped, while natural history (and its counterpart natural philosophy) had largely given way to more specialized scientific disciplines—cytology, <b>bacteriology,</b> morphology, embryology, geography, and geology.|$|E
5|$|By the mid-1850s the {{miasma theory}} of disease was largely {{superseded}} by the germ theory of disease, creating extensive interest in microorganisms and {{their interactions with}} other forms of life. By the 1880s, <b>bacteriology</b> was becoming a coherent discipline, especially through the work of Robert Koch, who introduced methods for growing pure cultures on agar gels containing specific nutrients in Petri dishes. The long-held idea that living organisms could easily originate from nonliving matter (spontaneous generation) was attacked {{in a series of}} experiments carried out by Louis Pasteur, while debates over vitalism vs. mechanism (a perennial issue since the time of Aristotle and the Greek atomists) continued apace.|$|E
5|$|Michael Woodruff {{was born}} on 3 April 1911 in Mill Hill, London, England. In 1913, his father, Harold Woodruff, a {{professor}} of veterinary medicine at the Royal Veterinary College in London, moved the family to Australia so he could take up the post of Professor of Veterinary Pathology and Director of the Veterinary Institute at the University of Melbourne. The elder Woodruff later became the Professor of <b>Bacteriology.</b> The family's new life in Australia was interrupted by World War I, which prompted Harold to enlist in the armed services. He became {{an officer in the}} Australian Army Veterinary Corps and was sent to Egypt.|$|E
5|$|He {{was awarded}} the Beit Memorial Fellowship by the Lister Institute in 1926; this gave him enough money for him to resign his curator {{position}} and he began full-time research on bacteriophages. He injected mice with bacteriophage and observed their immunological reactions and believed bacteriophages to be viruses. For this work he received a Ph.D. from the University of London in 1928 {{under the direction of}} Professor J. D. Ledingham and was invited to write a chapter on bacteriophages for the Medical Research Council's System of <b>Bacteriology.</b> He was also given an invitation to deliver a paper at the Royal Society of Medicine in 1927 on the link between O-agglutinins and bacteriophage. Burnet began attending the Fabian Society functions and befriended some communists, although he refrained from joining them in overt left-wing activism. He also spent his free time enjoying theatre, engaging in amateur archaeology and cycling through continental Europe.|$|E
5|$|While in London, Burnet became {{engaged to}} fellow Australian Edith Linda Marston Druce. She was a {{secondary}} school teacher and {{daughter of a}} barrister's clerk and the pair had met in 1923 and had a few dates but did not keep in touch. Druce sought out Burnet while on a holiday in London and they quickly agreed to marriage although she {{had to return to}} Australia. They married in 1928 after he had completed his Ph.D. and returned to Australia, and had a son and two daughters. At the time, there was a vacancy for the Chair of <b>Bacteriology</b> at the University of London, and Ledingham was lobbying his colleagues to offer Burnet the post, but Burnet returned to Australia, partly because of Druce.|$|E
5|$|At the time, the Hall Institute was in {{the early}} stages of rapid expansion. The new {{director}} of the Institute, Charles Kellaway, wanted to increase the activities of the organisation to not only support hospital operations but have separate research groups in physiology, microbiology and biochemistry that would also do independent studies. He also hoped to raise the standards to make the Institute comparable to the world-class operations in Europe and America. Kellaway took a liking to Burnet and saw him as the best young talent in the Institute with the ability to help raise it to world leading standards. However, he thought that Burnet would need experience working in a laboratory in England before he could lead his own research group on <b>bacteriology</b> in Australia. Burnet left Australia for England in 1925 and served as ship's surgeon during his journey in exchange for a free fare. On arrival, he took a paid position assisting the curator of the National Collection of Type Cultures at the Lister Institute in London. Burnet prepared or maintained bacteria cultures for other researchers in the morning and was free to do his own experiments in the afternoon. During the latter half of 1926, he experimented to see if Salmonella typhimurium was affected by bacteriophage.|$|E
5|$|Fraser's {{experiences}} {{as an intern}} convinced her that she would prefer medical research to actual practice with patients. When she completed her New York internship in 1926, she moved to Philadelphia, after a brief visit home to Toronto to visit {{her mother and her}} brother Donald. In Pennsylvania, Fraser began her post-doctorate training under the direction of Muriel McPhedran at the Phipps Institute for the Study, Treatment and Prevention of Tuberculosis in January 1927, specialising in <b>bacteriology</b> The experiences in her internships were markedly different in that in New York, she lived at the hospital and the staff was predominantly made up of women. In Philadelphia, she lived in her own apartment in the town and often had to struggle to be accepted as a doctor and be able to see patients. In March, 1927, Fraser was offered a position in the Connaught Laboratories, a research facility dedicated to developing vaccines, where her brother worked. Accepting the position to begin {{at the end of her}} internship in October meant that she would not be joining Williams in England. Williams had hoped that Fraser would join her, where they might be able to live together, but recognized with the choice of going back to Toronto, that would not be possible.|$|E
5|$|While {{teaching}} <b>bacteriology</b> at Maryland, Faber {{also held}} coaching duties. He {{served as the}} head coach for the Maryland lacrosse team from 1928 to 1963. During his tenure, Faber's lacrosse teams compiled a 249–57 record and secured eight outright or shared USILA national championships and nine Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) championships. From 1930 onward, Faber shared coaching duties with Albert Heagy, with the former running the offense and the latter the defense. In 1936, Faber led Maryland to capture the first Wingate Memorial Trophy, the national championship bestowed by the USILA. The following year, they shared the title with Princeton. In the inaugural North-South Senior All-Star Game in 1940, Faber coached the South team, which lost to the North team coached by Princeton's William F. Logan, 6–5. He also coached all-star teams in 1946 and 1956. In 1955 and 1956, Faber led Maryland to back-to-back 11–0 seasons, with the only close matches coming against period powerhouse Navy, in 1955, and the highly successful Mount Washington Lacrosse Club, 12–11 in 1956. In 1959, Maryland finished with a 10–1 mark as USILA co-champions alongside Army and Johns Hopkins, and Faber was named the USILA Coach of the Year.|$|E

25|$|After {{graduating from}} Aberystwyth, Roose studied {{medicine}} {{for a short}} period at King's College London. Although accounts of Roose often refer to him as a doctor of <b>bacteriology,</b> he never qualified as a doctor.|$|E
25|$|Texas A's College of Veterinary Medicine conducts {{research}} in genetics, physiology and pharmacology, animal husbandry, virology, <b>bacteriology,</b> {{and a number}} of other disciplines. Also, clinical research is performed by clinicians in the college veterinary hospitals.|$|E
25|$|In 1951, the Department of Health and Laboratories {{promoted}} Brown {{to associate}} biochemist. Brown and Hazen, in continuing their research, discovered two additional antibiotics—phalmycin and capacidin. The two {{continued to work}} closely together in making additional minor contributions {{to the field of}} <b>bacteriology</b> until their retirement.|$|E
25|$|In 1957, Joshua Lederberg {{founded the}} Department of Medical Genetics at the University of Wisconsin–Madison. He has held visiting {{professorship}} in <b>Bacteriology</b> at the University of California, Berkeley (1950) and University of Melbourne (1957). Also in 1957, {{he was elected}} to the National Academy of Sciences.|$|E
25|$|Israel Jacob Kligler (24 April 1888 – 23 September 1944) was a microbiologist. A Zionist and humanist, he {{was born}} in the Austro-Hungarian Empire, educated in the United States and spent most of his career in Mandatory Palestine, but died before the {{creation}} of the State of Israel. He {{was one of the first}} four professors of the Hebrew University and the founder of Department of Hygiene and <b>Bacteriology</b> of the university, which he headed until his death in 1944. Kligler was one of the pioneers of modern medical research in Mandatory Palestine, studying as varied a field as <b>Bacteriology,</b> Parasitology, Virology, Nutrition, Epidemiology and Public Health. He developed the Kligler Iron Agar medium for the isolation and identification of intestinal bacteria, which is still in use today.|$|E
25|$|Zworykin {{married for}} a second time in 1951. His wife was Katherine Polevitzky (1888-1985), a Russian-born {{professor}} of <b>bacteriology</b> at the University of Pennsylvania. It was the second marriage for both. The ceremony was in Burlington, New Jersey. A photographic record of his marriage and worldwide tour can be viewed online.|$|E
25|$|Kligler {{started his}} {{education}} in New York City {{public schools and}} in 1911 he received his Bachelor of Science degree with distinction from the City College of New York. He continued his studies in <b>Bacteriology,</b> Pathology and Biochemistry at Columbia University:M.A (1914), Ph.D. (1915). The focus of his Ph.D. thesis was oral bacteria with special attention to dental carries.|$|E
25|$|By 1900 {{the germ}} theory and {{advances}} in <b>bacteriology</b> {{brought a new}} level of sophistication to the techniques for possible use of bio-agents in war. Biological sabotage—in the form of anthrax and glanders—was undertaken on behalf of the Imperial German government during World War I (1914–1918), with indifferent results. The Geneva Protocol of 1925 prohibited the use of chemical weapons and biological weapons.|$|E
25|$|An {{official}} {{publication of the}} International Committee on Systematics of Prokaryotes (ICSP) and of the International Union of Microbiological Societies (<b>Bacteriology</b> and Applied Microbiology Division), the journal is the single official international forum for the publication of new species names for prokaryotes. In addition to research papers, the journal also publishes the minutes of meetings of the ICSP and its various subcommittees.|$|E
25|$|Flewett studied {{medicine}} at Queens University Belfast, where he graduated with honours in 1945. He {{worked at the}} Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast and, from 1946 to 1948, was a demonstrator in <b>bacteriology</b> and pathology at Queen’s University. His scientific interest in viruses began with his membership of the scientific staff of the National Institute for Medical Research at Mill Hill, where he spent three years between 1948 and 1951 researching common cold viruses and exploring the effect of influenza viruses on cells in culture. This led to his first use of electron microscopy, in which he became a leading authority. In 1951 he moved as lecturer in <b>bacteriology</b> to Leeds University, where {{he was involved in}} the 1953 smallpox outbreak. This experience proved invaluable twenty-five years later when a laboratory-associated case of smallpox at the Medical School of the University of Birmingham, UK, led to the death of Janet Parker. In 1951 he married June Evelyn Hall who bore him two daughters.|$|E
25|$|During {{these years}} he {{travelled}} widely as a World Health Organization consultant to most {{countries in which}} childhood diarrhoea is a major problem. He established The WHO Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Rotaviruses, (known as The WHO Lab), at his laboratory which was supported by The World Health Organisation from 1980 {{until his retirement in}} 1987. This laboratory was formerly a small tuberculosis <b>bacteriology</b> laboratory.|$|E
25|$|In 1900 {{the name}} of the {{institution}} was altered to the Bacteriological Institute, with control moved from the agricultural department to the Home Secretary's department. Diagnostic work on human diseases by the institute was approved to the Board of Health. This included specimen examination for typhoid, diphtheria, and tuberculosis, diagnosis by <b>bacteriology,</b> and microscopy for tumours. Pound was appointed Government Bacteriologist and his staff consisted of three assistants.|$|E
25|$|That MHS outlived the National Board of Health {{and emerged}} in the 1890s reinvigorated is a {{testament}} to Hamilton's skills as a political negotiator as well as a bureaucrat. Under his tenure, MHS gained authorities to establish a national quarantine on sea and land (interstate), formal recognition of merit-based requirements for a Commissioned Corps of medical officers, and a new laboratory devoted to <b>bacteriology,</b> the newest public health science of the day.|$|E
25|$|Later {{that year}} Sherrington {{traveled}} to Rudolf Virchow in Berlin {{to inspect the}} cholera specimens he procured in Spain. Virchow later on sent Sherrington to Robert Koch for a six weeks' course in technique. Sherrington ended up staying with Koch for a year to do research in <b>bacteriology.</b> Under these two, Sherrington parted with a good foundation in physiology, morphology, histology, and pathology. During this period he may have also studied with Waldeyer and Zuntz.|$|E
25|$|Scientists in Paris {{played a}} leading role in many of major {{scientific}} developments of the period, particularly in <b>bacteriology</b> and physics. Louis Pasteur (1822-1895) was a pioneer in vaccination, microbacterial fermentation and pasteurization. He developed the first vaccines against anthrax (1881) and rabies (1885), and the process for stopping bacterial growth in milk and wine. He founded the Pasteur Institute in 1888 to carry on his work, and his tomb is located at the Institute.|$|E
25|$|In February 1912, he {{was hired}} as a {{professor}} at the <b>bacteriology</b> department of the University of Iași medical faculty. The department lacked a physical space and a laboratory, and for nearly thirteen years had been staffed by substitute professors. Working in a room in Corneliu Șumuleanu's chemistry department, he offered a popular course attended by doctors as well as students. In 1913, during the Second Balkan War, he was sent to the front in Bulgaria {{in order to deal with}} a cholera epidemic. Decorated with the Military Virtue Medal in gold, he returned in 1914 and began to set up a <b>bacteriology</b> laboratory. He trained the first assistants and rented and furnished a house. Although the initial 10,000 lei and the additional 3000 lei per year received from the Education Ministry were woefully inadequate, he supplemented these with personal funds, private donations and substantial grants from the health department of the Interior Ministry, managing to set up a suitable laboratory for a country that had entered World War I by 1916. His textbook of epidemiology and vaccination, coauthored with Constantin Ionescu-Mihăești and Mihai Ciucă, had come out in 1915.|$|E
25|$|Fleming served {{throughout}} World War I as {{a captain}} in the Royal Army Medical Corps, and was Mentioned in Dispatches. He {{and many of his}} colleagues worked in battlefield hospitals at the Western Front in France. In 1918 he returned to St Mary's Hospital, where he was elected Professor of <b>Bacteriology</b> of the University of London in 1928. In 1951 he was elected the Rector of the University of Edinburgh for a term of three years.|$|E
25|$|After {{taking some}} {{language}} courses and chemistry at Harvard, Brown {{returned to the}} University of Chicago for additional graduate work in organic chemistry and <b>bacteriology.</b> After successfully completing her research project and the required course work in 1926, she submitted her Ph.D thesis. However, due to some complications in scheduling her oral examinations and the depletion of her savings, Brown {{was forced to leave}} Chicago without her Ph.D to find a job at the Division of Laboratories and Research in Albany, New York.|$|E
25|$|In 1893, Reed {{joined the}} faculty of the George Washington University School of Medicine and the newly opened Army Medical School in Washington, D.C., where he held the {{professorship}} of <b>Bacteriology</b> and Clinical Microscopy. In addition to his teaching responsibilities, he actively pursued medical research projects and served as the curator of the Army Medical Museum, which later became the National Museum of Health and Medicine (NMHM). These positions also allowed Reed to break free from the fringes of the medical world.|$|E
