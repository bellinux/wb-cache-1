Traditionally, lead-based bearing overlays dominate the commercial automotive market {{and it has been}} proven that an excellent combination of properties can be attained through their use. However, lead is a toxic metal and a cumulative poison in humans. According to the European Union End-of-Life Vehicle (ELV) Directive proposed in 1997, vehicles that registered in'all the member states after 1 st July 2003 should contain no lead, mercury, cadmium and hexavalent chromium. In this study, a new sulphate-gluconate electrolyte was used to produce multilayer SnCo coatings, aimed at a lead-free overlay for future market use. Tin-cobalt compositionally modulated alloy (CMA) coatings produced from sulphategluconate electrolytes have been previously examined as a potential replacement for lead-free bearing overlays [1]. However, some obstacles may exist which limit their potential use on an industrial scale. For example, long electroplating times are required to produce a thick coating which is very undesirable from an industrial viewpoint, and also the possible elemental interdiffusion occurring in the coating system under engine operating temperatures could rapidly deteriorate the coating properties. In addition, there is an increasing demand from automotive industry to further improve <b>bearing</b> <b>overlay</b> properties, for example for high performance and high compression ratio engines [...] . cont'd...|$|E

This paper {{was presented at the}} 8 th International Styrian Noise, Vibration & Harshness Congress: The European Automotive Noise Conference. [URL] over-riding objective in modern engine development is fuel efficiency. This has led to a host of pursued measures, including down-sizing (a lower number of cylinders), high output power-to-weight ratio, variable valve activation or cylinder de-activation (CDA) as well as a gradual trend towards mild or micro-hybrid technology. Furthermore, The main aim is to combine a suitable combination of the aforementioned methods with various driving conditions in order to reduce thermal and frictional losses as well as meeting the ever stringent emission directives as outlined in the NEDC. Another imperative is to ensure good NVH refinement which can be adversely affected by application of the above trends, such as light weight constructions and exacerbated power torque variations with CDA. The highlighted issues affect all the load bearing conjunctions in an engine. In particular, increased load fluctuations with CDA can also affect the whirl stability of big-end bearings. Therefore, the current paper concentrates on the issues that affect the big-end bearing thermo-frictional characteristics and dynamic stability in NEDC cycle. The predictive approach, which is critical in a multi-variate problem of this kind, includes determination of regime of lubrication under fluctuating loads and rictional characteristics contributed by both elastohydrodynamics of the <b>bearing</b> <b>overlay</b> as well as boundary friction as the result of asperity interactions. Predictive results include applied dynamics, contact kinematics, frictional power loss, maximum lubricant temperature and minimum film thickness variations during the NEDC. The difference between the CDA mode and the normal mode (all active cylinders). These show that the general benefits accrued through fuel efficiency do not necessarily conform to improved big end bearing frictional efficiency...|$|E
40|$|Master {{thesis is}} done {{defining}} hydrogeological {{features of the}} aquifere Grdovski Orman and vulnerability assessment of his pollution based on filtration characteristics of the water <b>bearing</b> and <b>overlay</b> sediments. Also, it was performed determination the groundwater quality. The definition of the hydrogeological features was done {{on the basis of}} the data obtained by making several exploitation wells and pollution vulnerability assessment by hydrogeological data and filtration characteristics aquifer’s overlay sediments. The aquifer Grdovski Orman is aquifer with free level, set in collector area of quaternary alluvial sediments built of different granulated sand and gravel which are characterized by intergranular porosity. Water bearing environment extends to a depth of 44 to 50 m and it is not a single continuous aquifer layer here it is presented in aquifers whose number ranges from 1 - 4. Under water bearing environment have insulating environment built from poorly compressed clayed sands and clays with a small percentage of gravel different granulated. Groundwater level in wells is depth which ranges from 2. 97 - 3. 75 m. Projected capacity of the wells ranges from 15 to 40 l/s. Recharging of the aquifer is mostly done by waters of the Bregalnica which is in direct hydraulic connection, and in one part is recharged by water derived from atmospheric precipitation and from surrounding aquifers located at higher hypsometric level. According to data obtained by testing of the exploitation and exploration- exploitation wells medium filtration coefficient of the aquifers is 95 m/day. Overlay sediments represent two-layered porous setting built of two lithological units with different granulometric and filtration characteristics. The first one is built of sand and gravel with a mean filtration coefficient Kf = 52 m / day), and the second is made of sand with minor presence of gravel and dust and has a lower mean filtration coefficient, Kf = 0. 42 m/day. By chemical analyses were analyzed primary compounds of cations: Na, Ca, Mg and anions Cl, HCO 3, SO 4, NO 3 and NH 4, as well as a number of chemical elements that belong to the microcompunds group. According to the mineralization the waters belong to the group of slightly mineralized waters, and after Alekin classification they belong to the hydrocarbon class, calcite group, second type of waters. Based on the hydrogeological and filtration characteristics water <b>bearing</b> and <b>overlay</b> sediments aquifer Grdovski Orman is found that groundwater of this aquifer are within a geological environment that is highly vulnerable to pollution. Preservation of groundwater quality aquifer Grdovski Orman proposed a number of measures for protection...|$|R
40|$|Lead (Pb) {{containing}} alloys such {{as white}} metals and Cu-Pb-Sn (lining) with Pb-based overlay plating have been extensively used as materials for {{internal combustion engine}} bearings during the last several decades. However, owing to environmental and health concerns, the use of Pb containing materials in automotive engine components is being restricted. In view of this, attempts {{are under way to}} develop and replace Pb-containing materials with Pb–free bearing materials. The tribological characteristics of these recently developed Pb-free bearing materials have, however, not been fully investigated and only a limited results about their tribological performance are available in open literature. This thesis therefore focuses on investigating the tribological performance of some recently developed Pb-free engine bearing materials. Although engine bearings are designed to operate in full film lubrication conditions yet they also operate in mixed and boundary lubrication regimes where the material properties do affect their tribological performance. There is thus a need to study the tribological behaviour of these new Pb-free bearing materials in mixed and boundary lubrication conditions vis a vis that of conventional Pb-containing <b>bearing</b> linings and <b>overlays.</b> This work has therefore aimed at investigating the tribological characteristics such as friction and wear, seizure behaviour, interaction with different oil formulations and embeddability behaviour of some selected Pb-free engine bearing materials. Friction and wear properties of Pb-free bearing materials Al-Sn based lining without overlay, bronze lining coated with Polyamide-Imide (PAI) based overlay containing MoS 2 and graphite, bronze lining coated with Al-Sn based and PAI based overlay containing MoS 2 and graphite, bronze lining coated with Sn-based overlay, and bismuth (Bi) containing bronze lining coated with Sn-based overlay have been studied using a block-on-ring test configuration under unidirectional sliding conditions in mixed and boundary lubrication regimes. The conventional Pb-containing bearing material was also studied as a reference material. Al-Sn based material showed considerably higher friction compared to the other bearing materials. The bearing material with PAI based overlay containing MoS 2 and graphite showed superior friction and wear properties compared to all other materials. Sn-based overlay coated materials resulted in comparable friction and wear properties to that of Pbbased overlay. Wear mechanism in Al-Sn based material is mainly adhesive and abrasive in case of Sn based overlay. Seizure behaviour of the bearing materials were also studied using the block-on-ring test configuration in dry as well as lubricated conditions using pure base oil and a fully formulated engine oil. The PAI based overlay containing MoS 2 and graphite showed no sign of seizure even at the highest test load in dry as well as lubricated conditions. Al-Sn based lining without overlay seizes at relatively lower load in dry condition compared to the other bearing materials. Adhesion or wear debris smearing onto the counter surface is the main causes of seizure in dry condition. In lubricated condition, seizure occurred at relatively higher load and the conventional Pb-containing material was found to have better seizure performance compared to the Al-Sn based and Sn-based overlay plated materials. Tribological compatibility of Pb-free bearing materials with different oil formulations was studied using a ball-on-bearing specimen test configuration in boundary lubrication under reciprocating sliding conditions. Four different bearing materials were investigated using different lubricants with and without oil additives. In general, the bearing materials lubricated with pure PAO base oil showed higher friction compared to those lubricated with oils containing additives. Lubricants containing additives improved wear properties of the bearing materials except in the case of Al-Sn based lining without overlay. It was also observed that the anti-wear additive level did not significantly influence the wear performance of <b>bearing</b> <b>overlays.</b> The embeddability behaviour of Pb-free bearing materials was studied using a fully formulated engine oil contaminated with SiC particles. Pb-free bearing materials with Snbased overlay, Bi-based overlay, PAI-based overlay containing MoS 2 and composite overlay containing PAI, Al, PTFE were investigated. Tests at different rotational speeds (i. e. different oil film thickness) and a constant load were carried out using a journal bearing test rig. It was found that material removal from bearing and shaft surfaces due to abrasive wear is influenced by the lubricant film thickness. The steel counter surface showed lower wear in tests using Sn based overlay and a PAI, Al and PTFE containing composite overlay compared to Bi-based overlay and PAI-based overlay containing MoS 2. ...|$|R
40|$|Traditional bearing {{materials}} contain different amounts of lead (Pb) {{because of its}} friction reducing properties. However, {{in view of the}} negative health and environmental impact of Pb, there is growing emphasis on restricting the usage of Pb in engine bearings. Owing to this, new {{bearing materials}} that provide at least comparable tribological performance to that of Pb containing alloys are being developed and some new Pb-free materials are being already used in engine bearing applications. It is, however, still unclear how these newengine bearing materials would perform in mixed and boundary lubricated conditions. In this study, a block-on-ring test setup was employed to investigate the tribological performance of several bimetal and multi-layer Pb-free bearing materials with different compositions of <b>bearing</b> lining and <b>overlay</b> plating. Pb-containing <b>bearing</b> material was also studied as a reference material. Friction and wear properties of these bearing materials wereinvestigated and their wear mechanisms under lubricated conditions have been analysed. Bearing material with overlay of Polyamide-Imide with graphite and MoS 2 exhibited better friction and wear properties than Pb-based and Al-Sn based materials. Pb-containg bearing material shows higher wear and Al-Sn based material has shown higher friction. Godkänd; 2014; 20140619 (andbra...|$|R
40|$|Improving vehicle {{efficiency}} and complying to stricter exhaust emission legislations {{are some of}} the driving factors to advancement in technology of engine components. The main bearings in an internal combustion engine contribute significant amount of friction. These bearings support engine loads and allow free rotation of the crankshaft. The bearings consist of a steel backing, a lining material and an optional overlay. The overlays help to minimize friction and enhance seizure resistance during adverse operating conditions. The aim of the thesis is to study the friction and wear performance of five multi-layered <b>bearings</b> with various <b>overlays.</b> A bi-metal <b>bearing</b> is used as the reference for comparison. Additionally, influence of two shaft surface textures are also studied comparing to the standard shaft surface finish. A modified twin-disc test rig is used to evaluate tribological performance of the bearing system. Forced misalignment tests were also performed to simulate edge contact conditions, which occur in an engine due to shaft deflection, asymmetrical loading and other factors. The bearing surface profiles were measured using an optical interferometer. The test setup showed good repeatability and consistent results. Relative friction and wear performance are compared and the bearings are ranked accordingly. One bearing type with a polymer and MoS 2 overlay showed the best overall performance. This bearing combined with a plateau textured shaft further lowered the friction coefficient by 3 % in boundary and mixed lubrication regime...|$|R
