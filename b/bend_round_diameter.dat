40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{aerodynamic}} noise generated by a <b>round</b> bar <b>bended</b> into a circular arc shape in uniform air flow. The <b>bend</b> <b>round</b> bar has a curvature R and attack angle α. In the experiment, we investigated the effects of R or α on the aerodynamic sound generated by <b>bend</b> <b>round</b> bars. The results of the frequency analyses of the aerodynamic sounds show that the aeolian tones are generated by the <b>bend</b> <b>round</b> bar, when α is large, but that when α is small, although the aeolian tones are reduced, the broad band noise of lower frequencies are increased. In order to decrease aeolian tones, we find the appropriate attack angle α...|$|R

Thus the other holes were bored, and the other nails put in, and at length the ladder was completed.|$|R

The receiver was fitted into an Avro Anson and operated {{by a member of}} the Y Service. The flight was nearly cancelled when Eckersley withdrew his assertion that the beams would <b>bend</b> <b>round</b> the earth enough to be received. R. V. Jones saved the flight by pointing out that Churchill himself had ordered it, and he would make sure that the Prime Minister would get to know who cancelled it.|$|R

60|$|MONDAY, 3d NOVEMBER, 1760, at half-past 6 in {{the morning}} Friedrich is on march for this great enterprise.

Northward all of it at first; but {{at a certain point}} ahead (at crossing of the Eilenburg-Torgau Road, namely), the March is to divide itself in two. Half of the force is to strike off rightward there with Ziethen, and to issue {{on the south side of}} Siptitz Hill; other half, under Friedrich himself, to continue northward, long miles farther, and then at last <b>bending</b> <b>round,</b> issue--simultaneously with Ziethen, if possible--upon Siptitz Hill from the north side.

50|$|The {{crew were}} not told any specifics, and were simply ordered {{to search for}} radio signals around 30 MHz having Lorenz {{characteristics}} and, if they found any, to determine their bearing. The flight took off and eventually flew into the beam from Kleve, on 31.5 MHz. It subsequently located the cross beam from Stollberg (its origin was unknown prior to this flight). The radio operator and navigator were able to plot {{the path of the}} beams and discovered that they crossed right over the Rolls-Royce engine factory at Derby, at that time the only factory producing the Merlin engine. It was subsequently realised that the argument over whether the beams would <b>bend</b> <b>round</b> the earth was entirely academic, as the transmitters were, more or less, in the line-of-sight to a bomber flying at high altitude.|$|R

[...] In Dresden, and the patch of hill-country to the southeastward of it by Elbe side, which is instep or glacis of the Pirna rock-country, seventy square miles or so, there rules Daun; and this--with its heights of Gahmig, valuable as a defence for Dresden against Austria, but not otherwise of considerable value--was all that Daun this year, or pretty much in any coming year, could realize of conquest in Saxony.|$|R

South of the Strait of Magellan, there are large outlying masses of apparently the same great tableland, extending at intervals along the eastern coast of Tierra del Fuego: at two places here, 110 miles a part, this plain was found to be 950 and 970 feet in height.|$|R
