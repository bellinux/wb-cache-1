50|$|Léon Lhoist was a Belgian businessman. In 1889 Hippolyte Dumont, his father-in-law, {{established}} the Carrières et Fours à Chaux Dumont-Wautier, at Hermalle in Belgium. In 1924, Léon Lhoist founded the Etablissements Léon Lhoist, a lime and dolime (dolomitic lime, or <b>burnt</b> <b>dolomite)</b> producer, at Jemelle, Belgium. In 1926, Lhoist {{established the}} Carrières et Fours à Chaux de Dugny, in France.|$|E
40|$|A {{possible}} {{new process}} for the partial desalination of seawater is to use bentonite clay or attapulgite as an adsorbent. The ion exchange property of these clays, which {{is a result of}} the characteristic t-o-t layer structure, enables the use of these materials as adsorbents. This technique has the opportunity to be used as a pre-treatment as current commercial seawater desalination processes are very expensive. The clay was characterized using XRD, XRF and SEM analyses. To ensure maximum adsorption of all possible elements onto the clay, <b>burnt</b> <b>dolomite</b> (CaO. MgO) was added to the solution to raise the pH. It was found that adsorption of Ca, Mg, K and Na onto bentonite clay and attapulgite follow pseudo-second order kinetics and the Langmuir isotherm model. With the increase in the pH higher adsorption capacities were obtained. FTIR analyses show that the OH - functional group is responsible for the metal adsorption[URL]...|$|E
5000|$|Fluxes (<b>burnt</b> lime or <b>dolomite)</b> are {{fed into}} the vessel to form slag, to {{maintain}} basicity above 3 and absorb impurities during the steelmaking process. During [...] "blowing", churning of metal and fluxes in the vessel forms an emulsion, that facilitates the refining process. Near {{the end of the}} blowing cycle, which takes about 20 minutes, the temperature is measured and samples are taken. A typical chemistry of the blown metal is 0.3-0.9% C, 0.05-0.1% Mn, 0.001-0.003% Si, 0.01-0.03% S and 0.005-0.03% P.|$|R
50|$|Basic oxygen {{steelmaking}} (BOS, BOP, BOF, and OSM), {{also known}} as Linz-Donawitz-steelmaking or the oxygen converter process is a method of primary steelmaking in which carbon-rich molten pig iron is made into steel. Blowing oxygen through molten pig iron lowers the carbon content of the alloy and changes it into low-carbon steel. The process is known as basic because fluxes of <b>burnt</b> lime or <b>dolomite,</b> which are chemical bases, are added to promote the removal of impurities and protect {{the lining of the}} converter.|$|R
40|$|The {{management}} phosphates in freshwater {{has significant}} importance to regulate eutrophication. Phosphate excess leads to highly undesirable changes in ecosystems st ructure. The increasing of water body trophicity {{can result in}} water quality deterioration. This paper presents the testing results of reactive materials used for phosphorus removal from wastewater at sewage treatment plant. Twelve materi als of different origin available in Belarus were tested as potential reactive material s for phosphates removal. They are natural materials, industrial by-products and manufactured sorbents. Based on chemical composition the available and inexpensive materials rich in Al, Fe, Mg and Ca were selected. Relationship between purification degree of phosphates and specific material consumption (mg/mg PO[4]{ 3 –}) was investigated to choose potential reactive materials for phosphorus. Four materials (wa-ter conditioning sludge (WCS), dead-catalyst of petroleum hydrocarbon cracking (DCC), electric arc furnace slug (EAF-slug), dolomite burnt at 700 °C) have been chosen for detailed sorption tests. WCS, DCC, EAF-slug and <b>burnt</b> <b>dolomite</b> have the apparent sorption capacities of: 13. 6; 21. 2; 35. 3; 70. 8 mg PO[4]{ 3 -}/g respectively. Results {{have shown that the}} raw natura l materials (chalk, clay, dolomite and tripoli powder) and wastewater electric coagulation treatment sludge are of low efficiency. Results for experiments with synthetic solutions of phosphates are in correlation with results for actual wastewaters...|$|E
