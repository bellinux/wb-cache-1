500|$|In a few {{accounts}} of Brannan's {{dealings with the}} LDS church {{it is said that}} Brigham Young sent the apostle Amasa Lyman to collect the tithing money that Brannan had withheld from the church's institution. When Lyman arrived Brannan was unable to account for the tithes that Brigham Young and other Mormons claimed were given to him or that he owed from his own personal income. He reportedly told them, [...] "You go <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>tell</b> Brigham Young that I'll give up the Lord's money when he sends me a receipt signed by the Lord", although historians, such as Will Bagley have found this is likely just legend. In another account, Lyman was sent to gather $10,000 of owed tithing from Brannan (or more if he was willing). After a couple of visits all of Brannan's debts to the Mormon church were considered to be paid in full.|$|E
2500|$|In Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States (1935), the Court also voted {{unanimously}} to declare the National Industrial Recovery Act (NIRA) unconstitutional {{on the grounds that}} it gave the president [...] "unfettered discretion" [...] to make whatever laws he thought were needed for economic recovery. Economics author John Steele Gordon writes that the National Recovery Administration (NRA) was [...] "the first iteration of Roosevelt's New Deal ... essentially a government-run cartel to fix prices and divide markets ... This was the most radical shift in the relation between government and the private economy in American history." [...] Speaking to aides of Roosevelt, Justice Louis Brandeis remarked that, [...] "This is the end of this business of centralization, and I want you to go <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>tell</b> the president that we're not going to let this government centralize everything." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the Washington, D.C., office, Giles and O'Keefe {{ask about}} how to account for Giles' {{anticipated}} prostitution income on tax forms. Giles asks, [...] "is there a way I can make up two years of tax returns?" [...] The ACORN employee replies, [...] "no you can't make it up", but tells Giles that she could form a business and state that she provides a service. The employee says, [...] "you can have a business. She's {{not going to put}} down that she's doing prostitution", and [...] "you don't have to sit <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>tell</b> people what it is you do." [...] Giles later tells an ACORN employee that she will be giving the money earned from prostitution to O'Keefe. The employee says, [...] "when the police ask you – you don't know where it's coming from." ...|$|E

2500|$|Chesterton's {{fence is}} the {{principle}} that reforms should not be made until the reasoning behind the existing state of affairs is understood. The quotation is from Chesterton’s 1929 book The Thing: Why I am a Catholic, in the chapter, [...] "The Drift from Domesticity": [...] "In the matter of reforming things, as distinct from deforming them, there is one plain and simple principle; a principle which will probably be called a paradox. There exists {{in such a case}} a certain institution or law; let us say, for the sake of simplicity, a fence or gate erected across a road. The more modern type of reformer goes gaily up to it and says, “I don’t see the use of this; let us clear it away." [...] To which the more intelligent type of reformer will do well to answer: [...] "If you don’t see the use of it, I certainly won’t let you clear it away. Go away and think. Then, when you can come <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>tell</b> me that you do see the use of it, I may allow you to destroy it." ...|$|E
2500|$|At 6:30am on 27 August Joffre sent Lanrezac {{an urgent}} message {{reminding}} {{him of his}} promise to counterattack. This angered Lanrezac, who spent the day—both on the telephone to GQG and in conversation with Lt-Col Alexandre of GQG, who had visited him at his HQ at Marle twice—arguing against the order, and he again demanded to be permitted to fall back {{when he learned that}} the BEF intended to retreat again on 28 August. After a tense discussion Lanrezac agreed to attack from Guise rather than first retreat further to Laon, and as soon as his forces were on open ground where they could use their artillery—which Lanrezac had told Joffre was the key factor—and to take no account of what the British on his left were doing. At 8:10pm on 27 August Joffre ordered him to relieve the British by attacking west rather than northwest. Lanrezac objected strenuously, reluctant to undertake a 90-degree turn in the face of enemy forces. Lanrezac sent Lt-Col Alexandre back with the words “before trying to teach me my business, sir, go <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>tell</b> your little strategists to learn their own.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Stonewall Jackson {{wanted to}} press his {{advantage}} before Hooker and his army could regain their bearings and plan a counterattack, which might still succeed {{because of the}} sheer disparity in numbers. He rode out onto the Plank Road that night to determine the feasibility of a night attack {{by the light of}} the full moon, traveling beyond the farthest advance of his men. When one of his staff officers warned him about the dangerous position, Jackson replied, [...] "The danger is all over. The enemy is routed. Go <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>tell</b> A.P. Hill to press right on." [...] As he and his staff started to return, they were incorrectly identified as Union cavalry by men of the 18th North Carolina Infantry, who hit Jackson with friendly fire. Jackson's three bullet wounds were not in themselves life-threatening, but his left arm was broken and had to be amputated. While recovering, he contracted pneumonia and died on May 10. His death was a devastating loss for the Confederacy. Some historians and participants—particularly those of the postbellum Lost Cause movement—attribute the Confederate defeat at Gettysburg two months later to Jackson's absence.|$|E

2500|$|In {{response}} to Moral Majority founder Jerry Falwell's {{opposition to the}} nomination of Sandra Day O'Connor to the Supreme Court, of which Falwell had said, [...] "Every good Christian should be concerned", Goldwater retorted: [...] "Every good Christian ought to kick Falwell right in the ass." [...] (According to John Dean, Goldwater actually suggested that good Christians ought to kick Falwell in the [...] "nuts", but the news media [...] "changed the anatomical reference.") Goldwater also had harsh words for his one-time political protegé, President Reagan, particularly after the Iran–Contra Affair became public in 1986. Journalist Robert MacNeil, a friend of Goldwater's from the 1964 Presidential campaign, recalled interviewing him in his office shortly afterward. [...] "He {{was sitting in his}} office with his hands on his cane... and he said to me, 'Well, aren't you going to ask me about the Iran arms sales?' It had just been announced that the Reagan administration had sold arms to Iran. And I said, 'Well, if I asked you, what would you say?' He said, 'I'd say it's the god-damned stupidest foreign policy blunder this country's ever made!'", though aside from the Iran–Contra scandal, Goldwater thought nonetheless that Reagan was a good president. In 1988 during that year's [...] presidential campaign, he pointedly told vice-presidential nominee Dan Quayle at a campaign event in Arizona [...] "I want you to go <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>tell</b> George Bush to start talking about the issues." ...|$|E
