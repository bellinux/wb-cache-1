5|$|Commercial {{operations}} are remunerated activities which {{fall within the}} ICAO definition of CAT. Some are, however, closely aligned to, and considered part of, the GA sector. Public transport {{operations are}} non-scheduled, on-demand services flying between points specified by the customer, providing a more flexible service than airline travel. Air taxi operations offer charter services for third parties, and business or corporate aviation uses company-owned aircraft to transport employees and clients. Aircraft used in these operations include <b>business</b> jets, <b>helicopters,</b> and twin piston-engine aeroplanes carrying between six and ten people. An example {{of this type of}} operation is the transport by helicopter of spectators to the British Formula One grand prix at Silverstone. This involves so many flights that, according to Cranfield Aviation Services, on race day the heliport is temporarily the world's busiest airport. Aerial work is a small but important component of the commercial GA sector, characterised in its simplest form as remunerated non-transport activities, such as surveying, crop spraying, and emergency services work (air ambulance and police).|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} unlimitedThis thesis discusses the economic effects of noise abatement regulations on the helicopter industry.

This thesis proposes that if noise abatement, regulations are imposed on the helicopter industry without lue consideration for future technological improements, helicopter manufacturers, operators of <b>helicopter</b> <b>businesses,</b> and consumers of helicopter services would be adversely affected.

Another key market for the AW609 has been the expansion of offshore oil and gas extraction operations, which requires aircraft capable of the traversing the increasing distances involved. In 2001, Bell estimated a market for 1,000 aircraft. Bell/Agusta stated in 2007 that they intend for the BA609 to compete with corporate <b>business</b> jets and <b>helicopters,</b> and that the BA609 would {{be of interest to}} any operator that has a mixed fleet of fixed wing and rotary wing aircraft. In 2004, Lt. Gen. Michael Hough, USMC deputy commandant for aviation, requested that Bell conduct studies into arming the BA609, potentially to act as an escort for V-22s. However, AgustaWestland's deal with Bell for taking over the BA609 program precludes the aircraft from carrying arms.|$|R
40|$|The European {{aerospace}} industry is {{world leader in}} large civil aircraft, <b>business</b> jets and <b>helicopters,</b> aero-engines and defence electronics. The sector in Europe is dominated by {{a small number of}} large firms highly concentrated in the UK, France and Germany. It is a mature market focusing on incremental product and process improvements. With the exception of the commercial aircraft segment, the market is dominated by institutional customers such as governments and the military. A special role for innovation is played by the large system integrators such as Airbus, Boeing and for example Thales that orchestrate the supply chain. Furthermore, with long development times and product life-cycles of 50 - 70 years, up-front capital investments and development costs are very high leading to a problematic cash flow profile of manufacturers.
