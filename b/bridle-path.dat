60|$|Now, {{seeing that}} I was not wanted, I took my cudgel {{and started down}} the <b>bridle-path</b> towards the common footbridge, when {{suddenly}} my mother called me back.|$|E
60|$|But at last, the Saints be praised! I found a real <b>bridle-path,</b> {{signs of}} civilisation, {{ploughed}} fields; and I came {{in sight of}} Marchena perched on a hill-top, surrounded by its walls. When I arrived {{the sun was setting}} finely behind the town.|$|E
60|$|A {{week had}} passed, and Mrs. Charmond had left Hintock House. Middleton Abbey, {{the place of}} her sojourn, was about twenty miles distant by road, {{eighteen}} by <b>bridle-paths</b> and footways.|$|R
60|$|I mounted {{and rode}} amain, {{not by the}} way that I had come, but westward; not by road, but by <b>bridle-paths,</b> through meadow-land and forest, up hill and down, like a man entranced, not knowing whither I went nor caring.|$|R
60|$|The party halted as he spoke, {{while the}} perplexed guide stroked his rather long nose and looked seriously {{at the two}} roads, or <b>bridle-paths,</b> into which their road had {{resolved}} itself, and each of which led into very divergent parts of the heathclad hills.|$|R
60|$|She flung up {{her tail}} like a {{sounding}} whale and buried us in a fifteen- foot deep <b>bridle-path</b> buttressed with the exposed roots of enormous beeches. The wheels leaped from root to rounded boulder, {{and it was}} very dark {{in the shadow of the}} foliage.|$|E
6000|$|... "There is {{only one}} thing possible," [...] {{declared}} Lilian. [...] "No one could trust a Canario with so urgent a message. We must start at once ourselves. We need not {{go all the way}} round by Oratava. There is a <b>bridle-path</b> across the hills." ...|$|E
6000|$|Making {{way from}} the {{kindling}} surges, I rode on a <b>bridle-path</b> [...] Much wondering to see upon all hands, of wattles and woodwork made, [...] Your bell-mounted churches, and guardless the sacred cairn and the rath, [...] And a small and a feeble populace stooping with mattock and spade.|$|E
6000|$|... "Herman Mordaunt rode in advance, with Jason; and {{he led the}} party, by pretty <b>bridle-paths,</b> {{along the}} heights for nearly two miles, {{occasionally}} opening a gate, without dismounting, until he reached a point that overlooked Lilacsbush, which was soon seen, distant from us {{less than half a}} mile.|$|R
60|$|ONE DAY, {{taking a}} pensive {{afternoon}} stroll {{along one of}} the many <b>bridle-paths</b> which wind among the shady groves in the neighbourhood of Taloo, I was startled by a sunny apparition. It was that of a beautiful young Englishwoman, charmingly dressed, and mounted upon a spirited little white pony. Switching a green branch, she came cantering toward me.|$|R
60|$|From dawn {{until noon}} on Sunday bands of Indians {{arrived at the}} Village of Peace. Hundreds of canoes glided down the swift stream and bumped their prows into the pebbly beach. Groups of mounted warriors rode out of the forests into the clearing; squaws with papooses, maidens {{carrying}} wicker baskets, and children playing with rude toys, came trooping along the <b>bridle-paths.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{marked a}} fitting place even as I rode here this evening. If {{you cross the}} river and take the <b>bridle-path</b> through the fields which leads to Josselin you come midway upon a mighty oak {{standing}} {{at the corner of}} a fair and level meadow. There let us meet at midday to-morrow." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Samson {{wants me}} to cut a new <b>bridle-path</b> through from the larches {{at the top of}} the hill down to Crutchley Bottom; but I don't think I'll have it done. Tell Jacob to let us have the nags; I'll ride the gray pony. And ask your mother if she'll ride with us." ...|$|E
60|$|The keenest {{thought is}} not always conscious. It was without {{definite}} intention that {{when he came to}} the <b>bridle-path</b> Harold turned his horse's head and rode down to the churchyard. As he pushed open the door of the church he half expected to see Stephen; and there was a vague possibility that Leonard Everard might be with her.|$|E
60|$|Soon I {{was out of}} {{the village}} and {{ascending}} the steep road towards the Pass of Cisa that leads over the Apennines to Pontremoli. This way had Hannibal come when he penetrated into Etruria some two thousand years ago. I quitted the road and took to <b>bridle-paths</b> under the shoulder of the mighty Mount Prinzera. Thus I pushed on and upward through grey-green of olive and deep enamelled green of fig-trees, and came at last into a narrow gorge between two great mountains, a place of ferns and moisture where all was shadow and the air felt chill.|$|R
60|$|As {{that lady}} truthfully says, {{a man is}} never so happy as when {{he is talking about}} himself. From Otis Yeere's lips Mrs. Hauksbee, before long, learned {{everything}} that she wished to know about the subject of her experiment: learned what manner of life he had led in what she vaguely called 'those awful cholera districts'; learned, too, but this knowledge came later, what manner of life he had purposed to lead and what dreams he had dreamed in the year of grace '77, before the reality had knocked the heart out of him. Very pleasant are the shady <b>bridle-paths</b> round Prospect Hill for the telling of such confidences.|$|R
50|$|Until Soviet {{times and}} the {{construction}} of the Pamir Highway from Osh to Khorog in the 1920s the routes to Kashgaria and the Pamirs were mere <b>bridle-paths</b> over the mountains, crossing them by lofty passes. For instance, the passes of Kara-kazyk, 4,389 m (14,400 ft) and Tenghiz-bai 3,413 m (11,200 ft), both passable all the year round, lead from Marghelan to Karateghin and the Pamirs, while Kashgar is reached via Osh and Gulcha, and then over the passes of Terek-davan, 3,720 m (12,205 ft); (open all the year round), Taldyk, 3,505 m (11,500 ft), Archat, 3,536 m (11,600 ft), and Shart-davan, 4,267 m (14,000 ft). Other passes leading out of the valley are the Jiptyk, 3,798 m (12,460 ft), S. of Kokand; the Isfairam, 3,657 m (12,000 ft), leading to the glen of the Surkhab, and the Kavuk, 3,962 m (13,000 ft), across the Alai Mountains.|$|R
6000|$|It {{was agreed}} {{that she should}} look over a stile {{at the top of}} her father's garden, and that he should ride along a <b>bridle-path</b> outside, to receive her answer. 'Margery,' said the gentleman in conclusion, 'now that you have {{discovered}} me under ghastly conditions, are you going to reveal them, and make me an object for the gossip of the curious?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have told}} thee, Ensign, {{it is by}} virtue of much {{training}} given to the beast. Certain am I, that neither whip nor spur would compel the animal to pass the bounds of discretion. Often have I travelled this <b>bridle-path,</b> without fear as in truth without danger, when sight {{was a sense of}} as little use as that of smelling." ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{walked a}} dozen paces down the <b>bridle-path</b> that joined {{the road at}} this place, and pointed out {{the way that he}} should go, past Ditchingham church. As I did so I noticed that while I spoke the {{stranger}} was watching my face keenly and, as it seemed to me, with an inward fear which he strove to master and could not. When I had finished again he raised his bonnet and thanked me, saying, ...|$|E
60|$|At Campobello {{there were}} not more than half enough young men, {{and there was not}} enough flirtation to affect the {{prevailing}} social mood of the place: an unfevered, expectationless tranquillity, in which to-day is like yesterday, and to-morrow cannot be different. It is a quiet of light reading, and slowly, brokenly murmured, contented gossip for the ladies, of old newspapers and old stories and luxuriously meditated cigars for the men, with occasional combinations for a steam-launch cruise among the eddies and islands of the nearer waters, or a voyage further off in the Bay of Fundy to the Grand Menan, and a return for the late dinner which marks the high civilisation of Campobello, and then an evening of more reading and gossip and cigars, while the night wind whistles outside, and the brawl and crash of the balls among the tenpins comes softened from the distant alleys. There are pleasant walks, which people seldom take, in many directions, and there are drives and <b>bridle-paths</b> all through the dense, sad, Northern woods which still savagely clothe the greater part of the island to its further shores, where there are shelves and plateaus of rock incomparable for picnicking.|$|R
5000|$|Munich is a densely-built {{city but}} still offers {{numerous}} public parks. The Englischer Garten, {{close to the}} city centre and covering an area of [...] (larger than Central Park in New York), {{is one of the}} world's largest urban public parks. It contains a famous nudist area, numerous bicycle and jogging tracks as well as <b>bridle-paths.</b> It is considered the [...] "green lung" [...] of Munich and one of the city's best-loved features. It was designed and laid out by Benjamin Thompson, Count of Rumford, for both pleasure and as a work area for the city's vagrants and homeless. Nowadays it is entirely a park, its southern half being dominated by wide and extremely well-kept open areas, hills, monuments and beach-like stretches (along the streams Eisbach and Schwabinger Bach), which can get very crowded in the summertime. In contrast, its less-frequented northern part is much more quiet, idyllic and natural-seeming, at times more resembling a natural preserve than an urban public park: it has lots of old trees, thick undergrowth, winding streams, hidden meadows and is pervaded by numerous romantic pathways. Multiple Biergartens can be found in both parts of the Englischer Garten, the most well known being located at the Chinese Pagoda.|$|R
6000|$|... “On June 30th I reconnoitred {{the country}} about Santiago and made my plan of attack. From a high hill, from which the city was in plain view, I could see the San Juan Hill and {{the country about}} El Caney. The roads were very poor and, indeed, little better than <b>bridle-paths</b> until the San Juan River and El Caney were reached. The {{position}} of El Caney, to the northeast of Santiago, was of great importance to the enemy, as holding the Guantanamo road, as well as furnishing shelter for a strong outpost that {{might be used to}} assail the right flank of any force operating against San Juan Hill. In view of this, I decided to begin the attack next day at El Caney with one division, while sending two divisions on the direct road to Santiago, passing by the El Pozo house, and as a diversion to direct a small force against Aguadores, from Siboney along the railroad by the sea, with a view of attracting the attention of the Spaniards in the latter direction, and of preventing them from attacking our left flank.... But we were in a sickly climate; our supplies had to be brought forward by a narrow wagon-road which the rain might at any time render impassable; fear was entertained that a storm might drive the vessels containing our stores to sea, thus separating us from our base of supplies, and, lastly, it was reported that General Pando, with eight thousand reinforcements for the enemy, was en route for Manzanillo, and might be expected in a few days. Under these conditions I determined to give battle without delay.|$|R
60|$|It {{was about}} the hour when birds seek shade and leave but few among their fellows to sing, that at a stone's throw from {{the foot of the}} hill I came to where a faint <b>bridle-path</b> diverged. And since it was smooth with moss, and Rosinante haply tired of pebbles; since any but the direct road seems ever the more delectable, I too turned aside, and broke into the woods through which this path meandered.|$|E
60|$|He {{had left}} his bed of {{sickness}} that morning, had saddled his horse in the gray dawn with his own hands, and had ridden away into the misty twilight of the forest without the knowledge of anyone excepting the porter, who, winking and blinking in the bewilderment of his broken slumber, had opened the gates to the sick man, hardly knowing what he was doing, until he beheld his master far away, clattering down the steep <b>bridle-path.</b>|$|E
60|$|In {{a lonely}} hamlet {{a few miles}} from the town--so lonely that what are called lonely villages were teeming by comparison--there lived a man of curious repute as a {{forecaster}} or weather-prophet. The way to his house was crooked and miry--even difficult in the present unpropitious season. One evening when it was raining so heavily that ivy and laurel resounded like distant musketry, and an out-door man could be excused for shrouding himself to his ears and eyes, such a shrouded figure on foot might have been perceived travelling in the direction of the hazel-copse which dripped over the prophet's cot. The turnpike-road became a lane, the lane a cart-track, the cart-track a <b>bridle-path,</b> the <b>bridle-path</b> a foot-way, the foot-way overgrown. The solitary walker slipped here and there, and stumbled over the natural springes formed by the brambles, till at length he reached the house, which, with its garden, was surrounded with a high, dense hedge. The cottage, comparatively a large one, had been built of mud by the occupier's own hands, and thatched also by himself. Here he had always lived, and here it was assumed he would die.|$|E
6000|$|It was no {{more than}} natural that such a chase should {{occasion}} some animation in a place as retired and ordinarily as dull as Porto Ferrajo. Several of the young idlers of the garrison obtained horses and galloped up among the hills to watch the result; the mountains being pretty well intersected by <b>bridle-paths,</b> though totally without regular roads. They who remained in the town, as a matter of course, were not disposed to let so favorable a subject for discourse die away immediately, for want of a disposition to gossip on it. Little else was talked of that day than the menaced attack of the republican frigate, and the escape of the lugger. Some, indeed, still doubted, for every question has its two sides, and there was just enough of dissent to render the discussions lively and the arguments ingenious. Among the disputants, Vito Viti acted a prominent part. Having committed himself so openly by his [...] "vivas" [...] and his public remarks in the port, he felt it due to his own character to justify all he had said, and Raoul Yvard could not have desired a warmer advocate than he had in the podestà. The worthy magistrate exaggerated the vice-governatore's knowledge of English, by way of leaving no deficiency in the necessary proofs of the lugger's national character. Nay, he {{even went so far as}} to affirm that he had comprehended a portion of the documents exhibited by the [...] "Signor Smees" [...] himself; and as to [...] "ze Ving-y-Ving," [...] any one acquainted in the least with the geography of the British Channel would understand that she was precisely the sort of craft that the semi-Gallic inhabitants of Guernsey and Jersey would be apt to send forth to cruise against the out-and-out Gallic inhabitants of the adjacent main.|$|R
60|$|Suddenly all London {{had burst}} into a passion of straw hats; and where one lately saw only the {{variance}} from silken cylinders to {{the different types of}} derbies and fedoras, there was now the glisten of every shape of panama, tuscan, and chip head-gear, with a prevalence of the low, flat-topped hard-brimmed things that mocked with the rigidity of sheet-iron the conception of straw as a light and yielding material. Men with as yet only one foot in the grave can easily remember when the American picked himself out in the London crowd by his summer hat, but now, in his belated conformity to an extinct ideal, his head is apt {{to be one of the}} few cylindered or derbied heads in the swarming processions of Piccadilly or the paths in the Park. No shape of straw hat is peculiar to any class, but the slouching panama is for pecuniary reasons more the wear of rank and wealth. With a brim flared up in front and scooped down behind, it justifies its greater acceptance with youth; age and middle-age wear its weave and the tuscan braid in the fedora form; and now and then one saw the venerable convention of the cockaded footman's and coachman's silk hat mocked in straw. No concession more extreme could be made to the heat, and these strange cylinders, together with the linen liveries which accompanied them, accented the excesses in which the English are apt to indulge their common-sense when they decide to give way to it. They have apparently decided to give way to it in the dress of both sexes on the <b>bridle-paths</b> of the Park, where individual caprice is the sole law that obtains amid a general anarchy.|$|R
60|$|When {{he became}} an old story, {{and there was no}} {{competition}} for him among the brothers, my boy sometimes took him into the woods, and rode him in the wandering <b>bridle-paths,</b> with a thrilling sense of adventure. He did not like to be alone there, and he oftener had the company of a boy who was learning the trade in his father's printing-office. This boy was just between him and his elder brother in age, and he was the good comrade of both; all the family loved him, and made him one of them, and my boy was fond of him because they had some tastes in common that were not very common among the other boys. They liked the same books, and they both began to write historical romances. My boy's romance was founded on facts of the Conquest of Granada, which he had read of again and again in Washington Irving, with a passionate pity for the Moors, and yet with pride in the grave and noble Spaniards. He would have given almost anything to be a Spaniard, and he lived in a dream of some day sallying out upon the Vega before Granada, in silk and steel, with an Arabian charger under him that champed its bit. In the mean time he did what he could with the family pony, and he had long rides in the woods with the other boy, who used to get his father's horse when he was not using it on Sunday, and race with him through the dangling wild grape-vines and pawpaw thickets, and over the reedy levels of the river, their hearts both bounding with the same high hopes of a world that could never come true.|$|R
60|$|We {{remember}} Isaac last when, {{lost in the}} woods, weak {{from hunger}} and exposure, he had crawled into a thicket and had gone to sleep. He was awakened by a dog licking his face. He heard Indian voices. He got up and ran {{as fast as he}} could, but exhausted as he was he proved no match for his pursuers. They came up with him and seeing that he was unable to defend himself they grasped him by the arms and led him down a well-worn <b>bridle-path.</b>|$|E
6000|$|They {{turned away}} from the river, {{crossing}} the hills of a rolling country now open, now wooded, passing white farmhouses and red barns, and ancient, weather-beaten dwellings with hipped roofs and [...] "lean-tos" [...] which had been there in colonial days when the road was a <b>bridle-path.</b> Cows and horses stood gazing at them from warm paddocks, where the rich, black mud glistened, melted by the sun; chickens scratched and clucked in the barnyards or flew frantically across the road, sometimes within an ace of destruction. Janet flinched, but Ditmar would laugh, gleefully, boyishly.|$|E
60|$|That {{afternoon}} she started {{on her way}} on a mountain pony I had just bought for her, accompanied only by a negro maid. I couldn't let her go quite unattended through those lawless paths, beset by cottages of half savage Africans; so I followed at a distance, aided by a black groom, and tracked her road along the endless hill-sides up to {{a fork in the}} way where the narrow <b>bridle-path</b> divided into two, one of which bore away to leftward, leading, my guide told me, to the chapel of Notre Dame de Bon Secours.|$|E
6000|$|We had {{to hurry}} {{away from the}} strange place; for night was falling fast, or rather ready to fall, as always here, in a moment, without twilight, and we were scarce {{out of the forest}} before it was dark. [...] The wild game were already moving, and a deer crossed our line of march, close before one of the horses. However, we were not benighted; for the sun was hardly down ere the moon rose, bright and full; and we floundered home through the mud, to start again next morning into mud again. Through rich rolling land covered with cane; past large sugar-works, where crop-time and all its bustle was just beginning; along a tramway, which made an {{excellent}} horse-road, and then along one of the new roads, which are opening up the yet untouched riches of this island. In this district alone, thirty-six miles of good road and thirty bridges have been made, where formerly there were only two abominable <b>bridle-paths.</b> It was a solid pleasure to see good engineering round the hillsides; gullies, which but a year or two before were break-neck scrambles into fords often impassable after all, bridged with baulks of incorruptible timber, on piers sunk, to give a hold in that sea of hasty pudding, sixteen feet below the river-bed; and side supports sunk as far into the banks; a solid pleasure to congratulate the warden (who had joined us) on his triumphs, and to hear how he had sought for miles around in the hasty-pudding sea, ere he could find either gravel or stone for road metal, and had found it after all; or how in places, finding no stone at all, he had been forced to metal the way with burnt clay, which, as I can testify, is an excellent substitute; or how again he had coaxed and patted the too-comfortable natives into being well paid for doing the very road-making which, if they had any notion of their own interests, they would combine to do for themselves. And so we rode on chatting, ...|$|R
60|$|Crossing {{the open}} {{ground in front}} of the Mountain Fort, Bounce and Bertram entered the wood beyond, and traversed it with {{comparative}} ease, by means of a <b>bridle-path</b> which had been cut there by the fur-traders. A few minutes' gallop brought them {{to the other side of}} the wood, which was one of those narrow strips or clumps of forest which grow, more or less thickly, on the skirts of the Rocky Mountains, forming that fine picturesque region where the prairie and the forest meet and seem to contend for the mastery.|$|E
60|$|Tucker {{had ridden}} {{on to the}} Review ground, {{so that there was}} no {{necessity}} for him, as there had been for poor Jim, to re-enter the town before starting. The dairyman hastily untied his mare from the row of other horses, mounted, and descended to a <b>bridle-path</b> which would take him obliquely into the London road a mile or so ahead. The old man's route being along one side of an equilateral triangle, while Jim's was along two sides of the same, the former was at the point of intersection long before Hayward.|$|E
