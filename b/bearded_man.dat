5|$|The <b>Bearded</b> <b>Man</b> {{demands that}} Fassl kill Fain, beating him {{up when he}} doesn't comply. As she tends to Fassl, Fain first sees the <b>Bearded</b> <b>Man</b> in his place. While staking out Fain's house, the agents see the <b>Bearded</b> <b>Man</b> flee. Doggett pursues the <b>Bearded</b> <b>Man</b> while Reyes finds Fain alive. In the pursuit, Reyes falls through into a sewer, where she finds {{the remains of the}} Bearded Man's victims. After a {{struggle}} with the <b>Bearded</b> <b>Man</b> who is holding Doggett at knife point, Reyes shoots. The <b>Bearded</b> <b>Man</b> falls into the water and Doggett goes after him, only to pull up Fassl, much to his confusion. Reyes tries to remind him that it does not matter as long as the case is solved.|$|E

5|$|Skinner remembers having seen, on {{numerous}} occasions, a <b>bearded</b> <b>man</b> {{who showed up}} suspiciously and who is actually running the scheme. He saves Skinner and sacrifices {{one of his own}} men. The case is closed and Skinner is, once again, aggravated with the agents, ordering them to report exclusively to Assistant Director Alvin Kersh (James Pickens Jr.). The <b>bearded</b> <b>man</b> was actually Alex Krycek (Nicholas Lea), a rogue FBI agent who formerly worked for the Syndicate, who continues to control the potentially debilitating nanotechnology in Skinner's system.|$|E

60|$|Two <b>bearded</b> <b>men</b> {{were also}} much given to seek {{attachment}} to this crystal. They also seemed knit {{to each other}} in bosom-friendship--if we may venture to use such a term with reference to <b>bearded</b> <b>men.</b> One was amateurly musical, the other powerfully sympathetic. A pastor, of unusually stalwart proportions, with a gentle pretty wife and lovable family, also had a decided leaning to this crystal.|$|R

5|$|In the present, Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish) {{discusses}} Fassl's release—due to DNA evidence—with an outraged Doggett. Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{confirms that}} the test results conclusively disprove Fassl as the killer. Meanwhile, outside the courthouse, Fassl notices a mysterious <b>Bearded</b> <b>Man.</b> After being released, he stays in a room belonging to his lawyer, Jana Fain, where he clutches a Rosary beads and prays frantically. When the <b>Bearded</b> <b>Man</b> appears, Fassl begs for the man not to hurt her. While Fain is unharmed, Fassl learns that the housekeeper, Mrs. Dowdy, has gone missing. Fassl finds her body, cleans up the blood, and dismembers her remains to cover up what has happened.|$|E
5|$|Ardhanarishvara is {{referred}} to by the Greek author Stobaeus (c. 500 AD) while quoting Bardasanes (c. 154–222 AD), who learnt from an Indian embassy's visit to Syria {{during the reign of}} Elagabalus (Antoninus of Emesa) (218–22 AD). A terracotta androgynous bust, excavated at Taxila and dated to the Saka-Parthian era, pictures a <b>bearded</b> <b>man</b> with female breasts.|$|E
5|$|In a 2011 {{interview}} with the Jakarta Globe {{after the release of}} his controversial film ?, Bramantyo said that he had intended Sang Pencerah to use Dahlan's life to examine different aspects of Islam. He meant for the film to show Islam as being a peaceful and truthful religion. Pramono, writing for Tempo, notes that the film presents a different side of Dahlan, who is usually portrayed as an old, <b>bearded</b> <b>man</b> who, in his opinion, seems neither modernist nor progressive.|$|E

5|$|Ladislaus is {{a patron}} saint of Hungary, {{especially}} along the borders. In particular, soldiers and the Székely people venerate him. A late medieval legend says that Ladislaus appeared {{at the head of}} a Székely army fighting against and routing a plundering band of Tatars in 1345. He is also called upon during times of pestilence. He is often depicted as a mature, <b>bearded</b> <b>man</b> wearing a royal crown and holding a long sword or banner. He is also shown on his knees before a deer, or in the company of two angels.|$|E
5|$|Scully tells Doggett {{that while}} the DNA test disproves Fassl's culpability, it implicates a {{possible}} blood relative; Fassl, however, is an only child. Reyes proposes that the murders are being conducted by an entity rather than a person. Meanwhile, Fassl approaches Assistant District Attorney Damon Kaylor and begs to {{be sent back to}} prison. Kaylor refuses, but is killed by the <b>Bearded</b> <b>Man.</b> After hearing of Kaylor's disappearance, Reyes theorizes that Fassl's piety and his unwillingness to acknowledge his darker half has given him the unwanted ability to physically change into another, more violent person.|$|E
5|$|As the {{breakdown}} happens, the soldiers bind {{her on the}} chair but she laughs, kicks and spits on them. Midst the aggressive fighting, the white Madonna takes a speargun and shoots the black Madonna squarely on the chest. The black Madonna falls down and concurrently a soldier pulls the switch on the electric chair. They laugh loudly thinking Madonna to be burnt but as the smoke clears, they see that no remnants are to be found. They rush to inspect the chair closely and notice three letters (לאו) being burnt in the chair. They scratch their head and see {{a vision of a}} <b>bearded</b> <b>man</b> laughing at them. Madonna is shown running from the torture chamber and opens the door, as the video ends with the gun barrel sequence.|$|E

50|$|A {{series of}} humorous guidebooks created with Jonathan Routh {{in the late}} 1960s allowed {{extensive}} expression of Glashan's graffiti-like style, combining small figures (often <b>bearded</b> <b>men)</b> with scrawled text - but, even here, often with elaborate backdrops.|$|R
5|$|Drawings {{scratched}} on slate {{have been}} found of dragon-prowed ships, portraits {{of an old man}} and of a young, <b>bearded</b> <b>man</b> and of a four-legged animal. The drawings were found in the Viking levels but are Pictish in style and may either pre-date the arrival of the Norse or indicate a continuity of art and culture from one period to the next. Similarly, although the rectangular shape of the Norse-era buildings are quite unlike the earlier rounded Pictish style, the basement courses of the two periods are constructed in the same way. The Viking-style loom weights, spindle whorls and other vessels were found with stone discs and other objects of a Pictish design. A bronzegilt harness mounting made in Ireland in the 8th or 9th centuries has also been found and many items from this period are in the Shetland Museum. Jarlshof contains the most extensive remains of a Viking site visible anywhere in Britain.|$|E
5|$|The album's {{original}} cover art by Burton Silverman features a watercolour {{portrait of a}} long-haired, <b>bearded</b> <b>man</b> in shabby clothes. The idea for the cover came from a photograph Anderson's wife took of a homeless man on Thames Embankment, and Anderson later felt {{it would have been}} better to have used the photograph rather than commission the painting. Ian Anderson recalls posing for a photograph for the painting, though Silverman claims it was a self-portrait. The artwork was commissioned and purchased by Chrysalis Records head Terry Ellis. Artist Silverman claims the art was only licensed for use as an album cover, and not for merchandising; and approached the band seeking remuneration for its further use. Silverman and Anderson have different accounts of level of enmity involved in this. The original artwork for both the front and back covers are now privately owned by an unknown family, apparently having been stolen from a London hotel room.|$|E
