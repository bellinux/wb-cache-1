5|$|In 1922, Hunter <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> {{a series}} of trips to {{mainland}} Europe, where he visited Paris, Venice, Florence and the Riviera. Fergusson accompanied him {{on a number of}} these visits. Hunter's visits abroad produced a large number of paintings and his style changed noticeably in this period of European travel as he began using dabs of colour placed instinctively to portray underlying form.|$|E

It {{is a matter of}} debate to what extent this move was locally {{motivated}} and to what degree the Milošević-led Serbian government was involved. In any event, the SAO Krajina was declared, which consisted of any Croatian territory with a substantial Serb population. The Croatian government viewed this move as a rebellion.|$|E

5|$|The Normans <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> incursions into South Wales {{from the}} late 1060s onwards, pushing westwards from their bases in {{recently}} occupied England. Their advance was marked by the construction of castles, frequently on old Roman sites, {{and the creation of}} regional lordships. The reuse of Roman sites produced considerable savings in the manpower required to construct large earth fortifications.|$|E

Their advance {{was marked by}} the construction of castles {{and the creation of}} regional lordships.

5|$|After Justinian died in 565, his successor, Justin II {{refused to}} pay the large tribute to the Persians. Meanwhile, the Germanic Lombards invaded Italy; {{by the end of}} the century only a third of Italy was in Byzantine hands. Justin's successor, Tiberius II, {{choosing}} between his enemies, awarded subsidies to the Avars while taking military action against the Persians. Though Tiberius' general, Maurice, led an effective campaign on the eastern frontier, subsidies failed to restrain the Avars. They captured the Balkan fortress of Sirmium in 582, while the Slavs <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> inroads across the Danube.|$|E

He traveled to Turin to inspect a collection of Egyptian materials assembled by Bernardino Drovetti, which King Charles X had purchased, cataloguing it. In Turin and Rome, he realized the necessity of seeing Egyptian monuments first hand <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> plans for an expedition to Egypt collaborating with Tuscan scholars and the Archduke Leopold. In 1824, he became a correspondent of the Royal Institute of the Netherlands.|$|E
5|$|Arana's support {{began to}} be {{solicited}} by the landed elite, who felt threatened by Arévalo's reforms. Arana, who was not initially inclined {{to get involved with}} politics, <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> occasional statements against the government. In the 1948 parliamentary election, he backed a number of opposition candidates, all of whom were defeated. By 1949 the National Renovation Party and the PAR were both openly hostile to Arana, while a small fragment of the Popular Liberation Front split off to support him. The leftist parties decided to back Árbenz instead, as they believed that only a military officer could defeat Arana.|$|E
5|$|At {{the age of}} 14 in 1904, Kilner {{reached the}} Mitchell Main first team. Although {{selected}} regularly from 1905, Kilner was not particularly successful with the bat. He displayed aggression but often attempted difficult shots and consequently lost his wicket. His bowling was more effective but used infrequently. By 1909 his batting improved; he scored his first century for the team and <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> consistently good scores, attracting the attention of Yorkshire.|$|E

In his opening match of the season for the Tamil Nadu Under-19s, he scored 227 in his team’s 392/7 against Goa, and after making a duck in the first innings against Hyderabad, he hit 126 not out in the second innings. He then registered his third century in four innings, cracking 235 against Andhra Pradesh. His form tapered off and he only made 111 runs in his next six innings, but was nevertheless called up to the senior team to make his first-class debut.|$|E

On June 26, 1950, he was rewarded with his own 30-minute CBS early-evening talk-variety TV program, The Garry Moore Show, which was a shorter version of his radio show. Until September 1950, it was also simulcast on radio. During 1950 and 1951, he hosted prime-time variety hour summer replacements for Arthur Godfrey and his Friends. He appeared as a guest star on other programs including CBS's Faye Emerson's Wonderful Town.|$|E
5|$|Bone, {{both human}} and animal, was also sculpted; human bones may have been trophies, or relics of ancestors. The Maya valued Spondylus shells, and worked them to remove the white {{exterior}} and spines, to reveal the fine orange interior. Around the 10th century AD, metallurgy arrived in Mesoamerica from South America, and the Maya <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> small objects in gold, silver and copper. The Maya generally hammered sheet metal into objects such as beads, bells, and discs. In the last centuries before the Spanish Conquest, the Maya began to use the lost-wax method to cast small metal pieces.|$|E

It also began to gradually weaken as the low-level center became exposed and the storm became poorly organized. Convection also diminished, and on the afternoon of September24, Bonnie was downgraded to a tropical storm as it drifted over cooler waters. Bonnie continued to lose most of its deep convection during the day on September25 as it <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a turn back around to the south. That evening, Bonnie was downgraded to a tropical depression.|$|E
5|$|By 1982, the Old Strathcona Foundation was {{confident}} {{enough in the}} theatre’s prospects to purchase the building outright from Towne Cinema. By this time, the asking price for the building had dropped to $425,000, which {{was estimated to be}} $8000 below its real market value. The Foundation <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> major upgrades and repairs to the interior of the building. A fundraising drive in 1987 allowed 422 modern sized plush seats to be installed, lowering the theatre’s original seating capacity by almost 240. In 1989, a soundproofed cry room was installed with an independent sound system, allowing patrons with small children to come to films without worry.|$|E

While not officially greenlighted, he got a budget from Fox and <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> plans as to when and {{where it would be}} filmed. Carter then enlisted Daniel Sackheim as a producer on the film. Sackheim had previously produced the pilot episode of The X-Files and directed several episodes in the first two seasons. The X-Files marked his first contribution as producer to a feature film. Carter's choice for director was Rob Bowman, who had been the series' executive producer and a director before the production base was moved from Vancouver to Los Angeles.|$|E

This marked the start of prosecutions of Centre Democrats party members on charges of racism, as well as the decision by the other parties in Parliament and government to place a cordon sanitaire around the party.|$|E

5|$|Hunter focused {{for much}} of his life on landscapes and on still lifes, working in both pen and ink and oil on canvas.

In his earlier paintings, Hunter was influenced by Cézanne to produce domestic landscapes. Later, however, in common with {{the other members of the}} Scottish colourists movement, he was heavily influenced by contemporary French artists like Monet and Matisse, and his paintings <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> bolder and more energetic use of colour.|$|E
