Even a full-time job {{is no guarantee of}} economic security, with the high cost of everyday expenses and a federal minimum wage of just $ 6. 55 an hour – less than $ 14, 000 a year with full-time, year-round employment. The <b>Basic</b> Needs <b>Budgets</b> developed by the National Center for Children in Poverty (NCCP) show the cost of basic day-to-day necessities for families with children. Using examples from these bare-bones budgets, this brief examines the question of how much families need to get by and provides insight into the struggles that working families face. Examples are drawn from 12 localities and are based on families with two children; budgets for other family types and localities are available through NCCP's <b>Basic</b> Needs <b>Budget</b> Calculator. <b>Basic</b> Needs <b>Budgets</b> show that it takes an income of about 1. 5 to 3. 5 times the official poverty level ($ 22, 050 a year for a family of four), depending on locality, {{to cover the cost of}} a family's minimum day-to-day needs.

50|$|Schwarz then {{assessed}} the actual {{results of the}} public policies enacted by Congress, which culminated in a 1983 best-selling book, America’s Hidden Success: A Reassessment of Twenty Years of Public Policy. It described how the programs legislated under the New Frontier and the Great Society, (which by Reagan’s presidency had increasingly become viewed as failures), instead saved Americans from far more serious unemployment and inflationary disasters in the 1960s and 1970s, which would have otherwise been inevitable with the entry of the gargantuan baby-boom generation into the labor market and economy.Schwarz then turned to assessing the results of public policies enacted during the Reagan and later administrations, focusing on workers and the larger economy. The research ended in two books, The Forgotten Americans: 30 Million Working Poor in the Land of Opportunity in 1992 (co-authored with Thomas J. Volgy) and Illusions of Opportunity: The American Dream in Question (1997). The former book discovered that dramatically more Americans occupied low-wage jobs, with little mobility upward, than was generally understood by either government officials or the public. Current economic policies (such as the frozen minimum wage and reduced public assistance) and flawed economic measures (such as the increasingly outdated poverty line) greatly exacerbated the problem.The <b>basic</b> family <b>budgets</b> set forth in The Forgotten Americans, coupled with its analysis of the levels of hourly pay needed to meet those <b>basic</b> <b>budgets,</b> helped give rise to living-wage movements {{in a number of}} states and cities. It also helped press the federal government to consider altering its standard measure of the poverty line and spurred some states and cities to enact a higher local minimum wage. In Illusions of Opportunity Schwarz shows how to quantify the shortage of adequate jobs for workers and families in the American economy in a period spanning from the late 1960s to the mid-1990s.|$|R
