40|$|The {{sensitivity}} {{change for}} a commercial fused quartz Bourdon tube precision pressure gauge, due {{to a change in}} absolute pressure level, has been analytically computed and experimentally confirmed. The computed differential pressure error is 2. 5 % of full scale at a 100 atm absolute pressure level.

50|$|The Bourdon {{pressure}} gauge uses {{the principle that}} a flattened tube tends to straighten or regain its circular form in cross-section when pressurized. Although this change in cross-section may be hardly noticeable, and thus involving moderate stresses within the elastic range of easily workable materials, the strain of the material of the tube is magnified by forming the tube into a C shape or even a helix, such that the entire tube tends to straighten out or uncoil, elastically, as it is pressurized. Eugene Bourdon patented his gauge in France in 1849, and it was widely adopted because of its superior sensitivity, linearity, and accuracy; Edward Ashcroft purchased Bourdon's American patent rights in 1852 and became a major manufacturer of gauges. Also in 1849, Bernard Schaeffer in Magdeburg, Germany patented a successful diaphragm (see below) {{pressure gauge}}, which, together with the Bourdon gauge, revolutionized pressure measurement in industry. But in 1875 after Bourdon's patents expired, his company Schaeffer and Budenberg also manufactured <b>Bourdon</b> <b>tube</b> <b>gauges.</b>|$|R
50|$|Pressure gauges: If the {{pressure}} of aggressive fluids or gases has to be measured, the gauge has to be isolated from the flow. For critical applications a diaphragm sealing is used instead of a <b>bourdon</b> <b>tube</b> in the <b>gauge.</b> This gives more security that the aggressive media will not leak. The diaphragm is a self-contained sensor, transmitting the displacement to the measuring device.|$|R
50|$|<b>Bourdon</b> <b>tubes</b> measure <b>gauge</b> pressure, {{relative}} to ambient atmospheric pressure, {{as opposed to}} absolute pressure; vacuum is sensed as a reverse motion. Some aneroid barometers use <b>Bourdon</b> <b>tubes</b> closed at both ends (but most use diaphragms or capsules, see below). When the measured pressure is rapidly pulsing, such as when the gauge is near a reciprocating pump, an orifice restriction in the connecting pipe is frequently used to avoid unnecessary wear on the gears and provide an average reading; when the whole gauge is subject to mechanical vibration, the entire case including the pointer and indicator card can be filled with an oil or glycerin. Tapping {{on the face of}} the gauge is not recommended as it will tend to falsify actual readings initially presented by the <b>gauge.</b> The <b>Bourdon</b> <b>tube</b> is separate from the face of the gauge and thus has no effect on the actual reading of pressure. Typical high-quality modern gauges provide an accuracy of ±2% of span, and a special high-precision gauge can be as accurate as 0.1% of full scale.|$|R
40|$|The varus-ualgus {{instability}} {{of the knee}} joint is mainly due to ruptured or lax collateral ligaments. The purpose {{of this investigation was}} to study the influence of the uarus-valgus instability on the contact pressures of the femoro-tibial joint. Six fresh knee specimens of human cadavers were tested to measure the contact pressure on the tibia plateau of the knee joint at varus or valgus alignment under various loads and at full extension. Pressure transducers and <b>Bourdon</b> <b>tube</b> pressure <b>gauges</b> were used simultaneously for recording pressure. At neutral alignment of the knee with the menisci intact, the peak pressure increased linearly with forces up to 4 MPa. With increasing varus alignment, the peak contact pressure on the medial plateau not covered by the menisci increased up to a maximum of 7. 3 MPa at 5 " varus, and at 5 " valgus, the peak pressure on the lateral plateau was 7. 8 MPa. After total meniscectomy, the contact pressure increased up to a maximum of 7. 4 M P a at a force of 2700 N. With increasing varus alignment, the contact pressure on the medial plateau increased to 8. 1 MPa at 5 " varus and on the lateral plateau 9. 2 MPa at 5 " valgus. ...|$|R

50|$|In practice, a {{flattened}} thin-wall, closed-end tube is connected at the hollow {{end to a}} fixed pipe containing the fluid pressure to be measured. As the pressure increases, the closed end moves in an arc, and this motion is converted into the rotation of a (segment of a) gear by a connecting link that is usually adjustable. A small-diameter pinion gear is on the pointer shaft, so the motion is magnified further by the gear ratio. The positioning of the indicator card behind the pointer, the initial pointer shaft position, the linkage length and initial position, all provide means to calibrate the pointer to indicate the desired range of pressure for variations {{in the behavior of}} the <b>Bourdon</b> <b>tube</b> itself.

50|$|Mechanical or elastic gauges {{depend on}} a <b>Bourdon</b> <b>tube,</b> diaphragm, or capsule, usually made of metal, which will change shape in {{response}} to the pressure of the region in question. A variation on this idea is the capacitance manometer, in which the diaphragm makes up a part of a capacitor.

50|$|A {{pressure}} switch for sensing fluid pressure contains a capsule, bellows, <b>Bourdon</b> <b>tube,</b> diaphragm or piston element that deforms or displaces proportionally to the applied pressure.

Since pressure may be changing slowly and contacts should operate quickly, some kind of over-center mechanism such as a miniature snap-action switch is used to ensure quick operation of the contacts. One sensitive type of {{pressure switch}} uses mercury switches mounted on a Bourdon tube; the shifting weight of the mercury provides a useful over-center characteristic.|$|R
