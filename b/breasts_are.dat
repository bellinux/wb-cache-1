5|$|The forehead, lores, crown, mantle, and {{scapular}} {{area are}} a neutral grey colour. There is a brown {{spot on the}} nape. The top of the tail is brown, and the bottom is faintly striped brown. The bird's back and rump are striped brown-sepia, and the throat, breast, and belly are grey-white. Its lower belly and flanks are tawny. The iris is dark brown. Male specimens are distinguished by having less sharp brown spots on their napes, and {{the bottom of their}} <b>breasts</b> <b>are</b> mixed with a pale buff colour. The legs are brown on the back and whitish on the front. Young birds have a yellowish appearance with striped brown flanks.|$|E
5|$|Wings is {{also one}} of the first widely {{released}} films to show nudity. In the enlistment office are nude men undergoing physical exams, who can be seen from behind through a door which is opened and closed. Bow's <b>breasts</b> <b>are</b> revealed for a second during the Paris bedroom scene when military police barge in as she is changing her clothes. In the scene in which Rogers becomes drunk, the intoxication displayed on screen was genuine, as although 22 years of age, he had never tasted liquor before, and quickly became inebriated from drinking champagne. A boom was built with the camera mounted on an extension to shoot the Café de Paris scene.|$|E
5|$|In the Prapancasarasara-samgraha, Dhumavati is {{described}} as having a black complexion and wearing ornaments made of snakes. Her dress is made of rags taken from cremation grounds. She holds a spear and a skull-cup (kapala) in her two hands. The spear is sometimes replaced by a sword. Another description in the same text says Dhumavati is aged with a wrinkled, angry face and cloud-like complexion. Her nose, eyes, and throat resemble a crow's. She holds a broom, a winnowing fan, a torch, and a club. She is cruel and frowning. Her hair appears dishevelled and she wears the simple clothes of a beggar. Her <b>breasts</b> <b>are</b> dry. Her hair is grey, her teeth crooked and missing, and her clothes old and worn.|$|E

25|$|A {{large number}} of colloquial terms for <b>breasts</b> <b>are</b> used in English, ranging from fairly polite terms to vulgar or slang. Some vulgar slang {{expressions}} may {{be considered to be}} derogatory or sexist to women.|$|E
25|$|Bra-wearers {{who have}} {{difficulty}} calculating a correct cup size {{may be able}} to find a correct fit using a method adopted by plastic surgeons. Using a flexible tape measure, position the tape at the outside of the chest, under the arm, where the breast tissue begins. Measure across the fullest part of the breast, usually across the nipple, to where the breast tissue stops at the breast bone. This measuring approach assumes that the <b>breasts</b> <b>are</b> not so large or pendulous that they sag significantly, making measuring across the fullness of the breast impractical. Only women whose <b>breasts</b> <b>are</b> firm and spherical can measure without a bra.|$|E
25|$|During thelarche, the {{developing}} <b>breasts</b> <b>are</b> sometimes of unequal size, and usually the left breast is slightly larger. This condition of asymmetry is transitory and statistically normal in female {{physical and sexual}} development. Medical conditions can cause overdevelopment (e.g., virginal breast hypertrophy, macromastia) or underdevelopment (e.g., tuberous breast deformity, micromastia) in girls and women.|$|E

40|$|Carcinosarcoma of the breast, often {{referred}} to as metaplastic carcinoma of the <b>breast,</b> <b>is</b> a rare malignancy with two distinct cell lines described as a breast carcinoma of ductal type with a sarcoma-like component. Clinically, carcinosarcoma of the <b>breast</b> <b>is</b> an aggressive <b>breast</b> cancer. The prognosis for carcinosarcoma of the <b>breast</b> <b>is</b> less favorable compared to more common types of breast cancer such as infiltrating ductal or lobular carcinoma. Currently, the evaluation of breast carcinoma includes hormone receptor analysis of the tumor tissue, with those positive for estrogen or progesterone responding better to both hormonal and chemotherapy...|$|R
25|$|Fibroadenomas, are benign breast tumours {{characterized}} by an admixture of stromal and epithelial tissue. <b>Breasts</b> <b>are</b> made of lobules (milk producing glands) and ducts (tubes that carry the milk to the nipple). These are surrounded by glandular, fibrous and fatty tissues. Fibroadenomas develop from the lobules. The glandular tissue and ducts grow over the lobule to form a solid lump.|$|E
25|$|Plastic surgery can be {{performed}} to augment or {{reduce the size of}} breasts, or reconstruct the breast in cases of deformative disease, such as breast cancer. Breast augmentation and breast lift (mastopexy) procedures are done only for cosmetic reasons, whereas breast reduction is sometimes medically indicated. In cases where a woman's <b>breasts</b> <b>are</b> severely asymmetrical, surgery can {{be performed}} to either enlarge the smaller breast, reduce the size of the larger breast, or both.|$|E
25|$|Tropical {{species of}} pigeons can display a rich variety of colour, presumably to {{facilitate}} species recognition. The plumage of the seed-eating genera of Columbidae {{is more often}} dull brown or grey. Typically imperial pigeons have dark dorsum and wings, ranging from grey to iridescent green. Their <b>breasts</b> <b>are</b> paler, ranging in colour from grey through orange and pink to dark grey. Less conspicuous markings are found on birds isolated to islands. Most species display little or no sexual dimorphism.|$|E

25|$|Convalescence — Post-operative care {{is minimal}} after a mastopexy procedure; the lifted <b>breasts</b> <b>are</b> {{supported}} with a porous, soft elastic tape, which is removed at 7–10 days post-operative, {{and then is}} reapplied to the mastopexy incisions for an additional 1–2 weeks during convalescence. For comfortable healing of the wounds, the woman wears a surgical brassière, and avoids wearing an underwire brassière until the breast implants have settled into position. The mastopexy outcome is photographed at 2–3 months post-operative.|$|E
25|$|Because <b>breasts</b> <b>are</b> mostly fatty tissue, {{their shape}} can within limits be molded by clothing, such as {{foundation}} garments. Bras are commonly worn by about 90% of Western women, {{and are often}} worn for support. The social norm in most Western cultures is to cover breasts in public, though the extent of coverage varies depending on the social context. Some religions ascribe a special status to the female breast, either in formal teachings or through symbolism. Islam forbids women from exposing their breasts in public.|$|E
25|$|At menopause, breast atrophy occurs. The breasts can {{decrease}} in size when {{the levels of}} circulating estrogen decline. The adipose tissue and milk glands also begin to wither. The breasts can also become enlarged from adverse side effects of combined oral contraceptive pills. The size of the breasts can also increase and {{decrease in}} response to weight fluctuations. Physical changes to the <b>breasts</b> <b>are</b> often are recorded in the stretch marks of the skin envelope; they can serve as historical indicators of the increments and the decrements of the size and volume of a woman's breasts {{throughout the course of}} her life.|$|E

25|$|The breast {{reduction}} {{performed with}} the horizontal-scar technique features a horizontal incision along the inframammary fold (IMF) and a nipple-areola complex (NAC) pedicle. To elevate the NAC, the technique usually employs either an inferior pedicle or an inferior-lateral pedicle, and features no vertical incision (like the Anchor pattern). The horizontal-scar technique best applies to the woman whose oversized <b>breasts</b> <b>are</b> too large for a vertical-incision technique (e.g. the lollipop pattern); and it has two therapeutic advantages: no vertical incision-scar to the breast hemisphere, and better healing of the periareolar scar of the transposed NAC. The potential disadvantages are box-shaped breasts with thick (hypertrophied) incision scars, especially at the inframammary fold.|$|E
25|$|The breast {{reduction}} {{performed with}} the liposuction-only technique usually applies to the woman whose oversized breasts require the removal of a medium volume of internal tissue; and to the woman whose health precludes her being under the extended anaesthesia usual to surgical breast-reduction operations. The ideal lipectomy candidate is the woman whose low-density <b>breasts</b> <b>are</b> principally composed of adipose tissue, have a relatively elastic skin envelope, and manifest mild ptosis. The therapeutic advantages of the liposuction-only technique are the small incision-scars required {{for access to the}} breast interior, hence, a shorter post-operative healing period for the incision scars; the therapeutic disadvantage is limited breast-reduction volumes.|$|E
25|$|The {{cleavage}} {{area between}} the breasts is perhaps the epicentre and stimulation of interest. Breast and buttock cleavages, sharing a similarity between their appearances, {{are considered to be}} very sexual. British zoologist and ethologist Desmond Morris theorizes that cleavage is a sexual signal that imitates the image of the cleft between the buttocks. Swelling of the anterior is a sign of mating-readiness in ape species. Among humans the female genitalia is regressed and the upright posture reduces visibility of the buttocks, but the <b>breasts</b> <b>are</b> significantly enlarged. Theorists hypothesize that with these evolutionary changes, the measure of mating-readiness and attractiveness in females has shifted from swagging buttocks to the pendulous shape of breasts and cleavage.|$|E
