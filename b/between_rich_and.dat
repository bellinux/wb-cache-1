5|$|Social conditions, the {{standard}} of living and the self-confidence of the workers gradually improved due to industrialization between 1870–1916, but while {{the standard}} of living rose among the common people, the rift <b>between</b> <b>rich</b> <b>and</b> poor deepened markedly. The commoners' rising awareness of the socioeconomic and political questions interacted with the ideas of socialism, social liberalism and nationalism (Fennomania). The workers' responses and the corresponding counteracts of the dominating upper factions steepened the social relations in Finland.|$|E
5|$|After {{the war of}} independence, Lima {{became the}} capital of the Republic of Peru but {{economic}} stagnation and political turmoil brought its urban development to a halt. This hiatus ended in the 1850s, when increased public and private revenues from guano exports led to a rapid expansion of the city. In the next two decades, the State funded the construction of large size public buildings to replace colonial establishments; these included the Central Market, the General Slaughterhouse, the Mental Asylum, the Penitentiary, and the Dos de Mayo Hospital. There were also improvements in communications; a railroad line between Lima and Callao was completed in 1850 and an iron bridge across the Rímac River, the Balta Bridge, was opened in 1870. The city walls were torn down in 1872 as further urban growth was expected. However, the export-led economic expansion also widened the gap <b>between</b> <b>rich</b> <b>and</b> poor, fostering social unrest.|$|E
5|$|Many {{commentators}} {{suggested that}} the 2012 rise in tuition fees in England would put poorer students off applying to university. However, the gap <b>between</b> <b>rich</b> <b>and</b> poor students has slightly narrowed (from 30.5% in 2010 to 29.8% in 2013) since {{the introduction of the}} higher fees. This may be because universities have used tuition fees to invest in bursaries and outreach schemes. In 2016, The Guardian noted that the number of disadvantaged students applying to university had increased by 72% from 2006 to 2015, a bigger rise than in Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland. It wrote that most of the gap between richer and poorer students tends to open up between Key Stage 1 and Key Stage 4 (i.e. at secondary school), rather than when applying for university, and so the money raised from tuition fees should be spent there instead.|$|E

As it starts its journey northward, it quickly has a junction with State Route905 (SR905) before exiting the city of San Diego and entering Chula Vista. Within the past 20years the freeway has delineated the apparent divide <b>between</b> <b>rich</b> <b>and</b> poor {{in the city of}} Chula Vista; those on {{the eastern side of the}} freeway have been more affluent and have better schools compared to those on the western side. Just outside the city, I-805 meets County Route S17 (CRS17), also named Bonita Road, before coming to an interchange with SR54. The freeway then enters National City, where it intersects Sweetwater Road and Plaza Boulevard, before leaving the city and reentering the city of San Diego.|$|E
