5000|$|A biotransducer is the recognition-transduction {{component}} of a biosensor system. It consists of two intimately coupled parts; a bio-recognition layer and a physicochemical transducer, which acting together converts a biochemical signal to an electronic or optical signal.

However, oligonucleotide sequences, sub-cellular fragments such as organelles (e.g. mitochondria) and receptor carrying fragments (e.g. cell wall), single whole cells, small numbers of cells on synthetic scaffolds, or thin slices of animal or plant tissues, may also comprise the bio-recognition layer. It gives the biosensor selectivity and specificity. The physicochemical transducer is typically in intimate and controlled contact with the recognition layer.

To unravel the cellular and molecular functions of Limk, we have either knocked out or activated the Limk gene in Drosophila. At the neuromuscular junction, loss of Limk leads to enlarged terminals, while increasing the activity of Limk leads to stunted terminals with fewer synaptic boutons. In the antennal lobe, loss of Limk abolishes the ability of p 21 -activated kinase (Pak) to alter glomerular development.

In contrast, mutations of Thr 75 did not affect conditioned place preference or the acute locomotor response to cocaine, but DARPP- 32 Thr- 75 mutants showed no locomotor sensitization in response to repeated cocaine administration.

Ceramide-activated protein kinases, such as the kinase suppressor of Ras (KSR) and protein kinase Czeta (PKCzeta), are involved in the regulation of c-Raf, which promotes sequential activation of MEK- 1 and p 42 /p 44 MAPK in mammalian cells.
