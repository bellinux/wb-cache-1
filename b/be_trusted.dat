5|$|After 13,000 {{years the}} Grand Galactics finally return to Earth and are astounded {{to see how}} fast the planet has developed.

40|$|We employ {{experiments}} to illustrate one {{factor contributing to}} the lack of distrust in the recent corporate scandals: Trust rather than no <b>trust</b> <b>was</b> the default. Holding the expected returns from <b>trusting</b> constant, people <b>are</b> more <b>trusting</b> when the default <b>is</b> <b>trust</b> than when it <b>is</b> no <b>trust.</b> In a new game, the Distrust Game (DTG), where the default <b>is</b> full <b>trust,</b> <b>trust</b> levels <b>are</b> higher and trustworthiness levels lower than in the BDM-Trust Game (TG), where the default <b>is</b> no <b>trust.</b> Agents punish distrust more in the DTG than in the TG but principals do not anticipate this. ...|$|R

5|$|From the Goebbels Diaries, {{researchers}} {{learned that}} Riefenstahl had been friendly with Joseph Goebbels {{and his wife}} Magda, attending the opera with them and going to his parties. Riefenstahl maintained that Goebbels was upset when she rejected his advances and was jealous of her influence on Hitler, seeing her as an internal threat. She therefore insisted his diary entries could not <b>be</b> <b>trusted.</b> By later accounts, Goebbels thought highly of Riefenstahl's filmmaking but was angered with {{what he saw as}} her overspending on the Nazi-provided filmmaking budgets.|$|E

He tries to convince the naive Giselle that her beau cannot <b>be</b> <b>trusted,</b> but she ignores his warnings. Giselle's mother, Berthe, is very protective of her daughter, as Giselle has a weak heart that leaves her in delicate health. She discourages a relationship between Giselle and Loys, and disapproves of Giselle's fondness for dancing.|$|E
5|$|Historians (List of Historians {{till now}} not found, hence cannot <b>be</b> <b>trusted)</b> claim that Hyder was {{extremely}} tolerant towards the Christians.

The Second Anglo-Mysore War began in 1780 and led to Hyder's death on 7 December 1782, at Arcot. Afterwards the British recaptured the fort at Mangalore.|$|E

On May 7, 2010, Universal Pictures announced it had agreed to finance and distribute the film, which Roth and Strike Entertainment's Marc Abraham and Eric Newman would produce.

5|$|After seeing Nankiwi in the plane, a {{small group}} of Huaorani decided to make the trip to Palm Beach, and left the {{following}} morning, January 7. On the way, they encountered Nankiwi and the girl, returning unescorted. The girl's brother, Nampa, was furious at this, and to defuse the situation and divert attention from himself, Nankiwi claimed that the foreigners had attacked them on the beach, and in their haste to flee, they had been separated from their chaperone. Gikita, {{a senior member of the}} group whose experience with outsiders had taught him that they could not <b>be</b> <b>trusted,</b> recommended that they kill the foreigners. The return of the older woman and her account of the friendliness of the missionaries was not enough to dissuade them, and they soon continued toward the beach.|$|E

While his mother Catelyn wishes to return to Winterfell {{to be with her}} sons Bran and Rickon, Robb asks her to travel to Renly's court to negotiate an alliance. Catelyn tells Robb that his father would be proud of what Robb has accomplished, but warns him that Balon Greyjoy is not to <b>be</b> <b>trusted.</b>|$|E
5|$|Crude glyphs {{have been}} found on a few stone objects and some {{additional}} wooden items, {{but most of these}} are thought to be fakes created for the early tourism market. Several of the 26 wooden texts are suspect due to uncertain provenance (X, Y, and Z), poor quality craftsmanship (F, K, V, W, Y, and Z), or to having been carved with a steel blade (K, V, and Y), and thus, although they may prove to be genuine, should not <b>be</b> <b>trusted</b> in initial attempts at decipherment. Z resembles many early forgeries in not being boustrophedon, but it may be a palimpsest on an authentic but now illegible text.|$|E

In the 1970s, he was chairman of the anti-immigration United Country Party, a position he held until the party was absorbed by the New Britain Party in 1980. He campaigned for the politician Edmund Iremonger at the 1979 general election, as they agreed the French and Germans were not to <b>be</b> <b>trusted.</b> Iremonger and Moore gave up political campaigning after deciding they were Thatcherites. Moore campaigned on behalf of Douglas Denny (UKIP) for the Chichester constituency in 2001. A Conservative voter for many years, he was a supporter and patron of the eurosceptic UK Independence Party until his death.|$|E
5|$|Oswald {{seems to}} have been on good terms with the West Saxons: he stood as sponsor to the baptism of their king, Cynegils, and married Cynegils' daughter. Her name is {{reported}} by only one source, Reginald of Durham's 12th century Vita S. Oswaldi, which says that it was Kyneburga. Although Oswald had one known son, Æthelwald, it is uncertain whether this was a son from his marriage to Cynegils' daughter or from an earlier relationshipsince Æthelwald began ruling in Deira in 651, {{it has been argued that}} a son from this marriage would have been too young at the time to <b>be</b> <b>trusted</b> with this position, and therefore may have been older, the product of a relationship Oswald had during his exile.|$|E
5|$|Some of {{the ancient}} sources detail plots that Galerius made on Constantine's life in the months {{following}} Diocletian's abdication. They assert that Galerius assigned Constantine to lead an advance unit in a cavalry charge through a swamp on the middle Danube, made him enter into single combat with a lion, and attempted to kill him in hunts and wars. Constantine always emerged victorious: the lion emerged from the contest in a poorer condition than Constantine; Constantine returned to Nicomedia from the Danube with a Sarmatian captive to drop at Galerius' feet.

5|$|Captain John Hart appears {{through the}} Cardiff space-time Rift using a vortex {{manipulator}} and asks Jack Harkness {{for help in}} locating three radioactive cluster bombs, apparently scattered across Cardiff. Jack Harkness tells his team that John cannot <b>be</b> <b>trusted</b> but agrees to help him. True to Jack's word, Captain John is lying and seizes the containers, trying to kill Gwen Cooper (Eve Myles) using a paralyzing lip gloss, shooting Owen Harper (Burn Gorman), punching Toshiko Sato (Naoko Mori) and pushing Jack {{off the top of}} a building, thinking he's dead. However the containers, which are supposed to contain the location of a valuable diamond hidden by the lover he murdered, instead contain an explosive which latches on the DNA signature of her killer. As insurance against Torchwood leaving him to die, John handcuffs himself to Gwen and swallows the key. After superficially altering his DNA using that of the Torchwood staff, Jack and Owen are able to save John's life before banishing him. Spurned by his former lover, John leaves by means of his Vortex Manipulator.|$|E
5|$|Dax helps Worf save Kor, and {{afterwards}} takes {{possession of the}} sword because she thinks the two Klingons cannot <b>be</b> <b>trusted</b> with it. The three make camp and sleep through the night, but Dax is awoken by a scuffle between Kor and Worf. The fight between them stops momentarily after Toral and his men arrive. After Toral is subdued, Kor and Worf again attack each other. Jadzia shoots them both with her phaser set to stun and then forces Toral to deactivate the transport blocker so that the three can return to the Runabout. After they depart the planet, Kor and Worf realize that if the sword divided two men as honorable as they, it {{would do the same}} to the Klingon Empire, so they beam it into space, leaving it to drift until the Klingon Empire is ready for it.|$|E
5|$|Gaveston's {{return to}} grace was only temporary. On 26 February 1307, Edward I {{announced}} that the prince's favourite {{had to leave the}} realm shortly after 30 April that year. This time it seems the punishment was not intended for Gaveston, though, but for the Prince of Wales. According to Walter of Guisborough, the prince appeared before the King to request that his own county of Ponthieu be given to Gaveston. Edward I, enraged, tore out handfuls of his son's hair and threw him out of the royal chambers. Though Guisborough cannot necessarily <b>be</b> <b>trusted</b> on the details of the events, the story reflects the general exasperation the King felt with the prince's favouritism towards Gaveston, and the lavish gifts bestowed on the favourite. This extravagance was clearly seen on Gaveston's departure, when Prince Edward equipped him with horses, luxurious clothes, and £260 of money.|$|E
