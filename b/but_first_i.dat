After moving to France, she {{became one of the first}} women lectors at the American Cathedral in Paris, where she was on the regular rota for Scripture readings. As recently as 2012, she was doing readings on major feast days, including Christmas and Easter. [...] "It's a task I love", she once said. In describing her preparation for her readings, she once observed, [...] "You have to convey the deep meaning, you see, and it has to start with your own faith. <b>But</b> <b>first</b> <b>I</b> always pray. I pray before I start to prepare, as well. In fact, I would always say a prayer before shooting a scene, so this is not so different, in a way." [...] DeHavilland prefers to use the Revised English Bible for its poetic style. She raised her son Benjamin in the Episcopal Church and her daughter Gisèle in the Roman Catholic Church, the faith of each child's father.|$|E

2500|$|Melville owned an {{edition of}} Shakespeare's works by 1849, and his reading of it greatly {{influenced}} {{the style of}} his next book, Moby-Dick (1851). The critic F.O. Matthiessen found that the language of Shakespeare far surpasses other influences upon the book, in that it inspired Melville to discover his own full strength. On almost every page, debts to Shakespeare can be discovered. The [...] "mere sounds, full of Leviathanism, but signifying nothing" [...] {{at the end of}} [...] "Cetology" [...] (Ch.32) echo the famous phrase in Macbeth: [...] "Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury/ Signifying nothing." [...] Ahab's first extended speech to the crew, in the [...] "Quarter-Deck" [...] (Ch.36) is practically blank verse and so is Ahab's soliloquy at the beginning of [...] "Sunset" [...] (Ch.37):'I leave a white and turbid wake;/ Pale waters, paler cheeks, where'er I sail./ The envious billows sidelong swell to whelm/ My track; let them; <b>but</b> <b>first</b> <b>I</b> pass.' Through Shakespeare, Melville infused Moby-Dick with a power of expression he had not previously possessed. Reading Shakespeare had been [...] "a catalytic agent" [...] for Melville, one that transformed his writing from merely reporting to [...] "the expression of profound natural forces." [...] The extent to which Melville assimilated Shakespeare is evident in the description of Ahab, Matthiessen continues, which ends in language that seems Shakespearean yet is no imitation: 'Oh, Ahab! what shall be grand in thee, it must needs be plucked from the skies and dived for in the deep, and featured in the unbodied air!' The imaginative richness of the final phrase seems particularly Shakespearean, [...] "but its two key words appear only once each in the plays...and to neither of these usages is Melville indebted for his fresh combination." [...] Melville's diction depended upon no source, and his prose is not based on anybody else's verse but on an awareness of [...] "speech rhythm".|$|E
