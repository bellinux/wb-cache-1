40|$|Classically, the {{tendency}} towards spontaneous synchronization is strongest if the natural frequencies of the self-oscillators are {{as close as}} possible. We show that this wisdom fails in the deep quantum regime, where the uncertainty of amplitude narrows down {{to the level of}} single quanta. Under these circumstances identical self-oscillators cannot synchronize and detuning their frequencies can actually help synchronization. The effect can be understood in a simple picture: Interaction requires an exchange of energy. In the quantum regime, the possible quanta of energy are discrete. If the extractable energy of one oscillator does not exactly match the amount the second oscillator may absorb, interaction, and thereby synchronization is blocked. We demon- strate this effect, which we coin quantum synchronization blockade, in the minimal example of two Kerr-type self-oscillators and predict consequences for small oscillator networks, where synchronization between <b>blocked</b> <b>oscillators</b> can be mediated via a detuned oscillator. We also propose concrete implementations with super- conducting circuits and trapped ions. This paves the way for investigations of new quantum synchronization phenomena in oscillator networks both theoretically and experimentally. Comment: 8 pages, 7 figure...|$|R
500|$|Various other {{cellular}} automata {{are known}} to support replicators, patterns that make copies of themselves, with the same behavior as in the tree growth model for Rule 90. A new copy is placed {{to either side of}} the replicator pattern, as long as the space there is empty. However, if two replicators both attempt to copy themselves into the same position, then the space remains blank. In either case the replicators themselves vanish, leaving their copies to carry on the replication. A standard example of this behavior is the [...] "bowtie pasta" [...] pattern in the two-dimensional HighLife rule. This rule behaves in many ways like Conway's Game of Life, but such a small replicator does not exist in Life. Whenever an automaton supports replicators with the same growth pattern, one-dimensional arrays of replicators can be used to simulate Rule 90. Rule 90 (on finite rows of cells) can also be simulated by the <b>block</b> <b>oscillators</b> of the two-dimensional [...] cellular automaton B36/S125, also called [...] "2x2", and the behavior of Rule 90 can be used to characterize the possible periods of these oscillators.|$|R

5000|$|A <b>blocking</b> <b>oscillator</b> is {{a simple}} {{configuration}} of discrete electronic components which can produce a free-running signal, requiring only a resistor, a transformer, and one amplifying element.

The non-sinusoidal output is not suitable for use as a radio-frequency local oscillator, but it can serve as a timing generator, to power lights, LEDs, Elwire, or small neon indicators.

We derive lower and most importantly upper bounds for the entanglement,quantified by the von Neumann entropy, between a compact <b>block</b> of <b>oscillators</b> and its environment.

40|$|An novel {{class of}} locally excitatory, {{globally}} inhibitory oscillator networks is proposed. The model of each oscillator {{corresponds to a}} standard relaxation oscillator with two time scales. The network exhibits a mechanism of selective gating, whereby an oscillator jumping up to its active phase rapidly recruits the oscillators stimulated by the same pattern, while preventing others from jumping up. We show analytically that with the selective gating mechanism the network rapidly achieves both synchronization within <b>blocks</b> of <b>oscillators</b> that are stimulated by connected regions and desynchronization between different blocks. Computer simulations demonstrate the network's promising ability for segmenting multiple input patterns in real time.

40|$|We {{investigate}} entanglement between collective {{operators of}} two <b>blocks</b> of <b>oscillators</b> in an infinite linear harmonic chain. These operators {{are defined as}} averages over local operators (individual <b>oscillators)</b> in the <b>blocks.</b> On the one hand, this approach of "physical blocks" meets realistic experimental conditions, where measurement apparatuses do not interact with single oscillators but rather with {{a whole bunch of}} them, i. e., where in contrast to usually studied "mathematical blocks" not every possible measurement is allowed. On the other, this formalism naturally allows the generalization to blocks which may consist of several non-contiguous regions. We quantify entanglement between the collective operators by a measure based on the Peres-Horodecki criterion and show how it can be extracted and transferred to two qubits. Entanglement between two blocks is found even in the case where none of the <b>oscillators</b> from one <b>block</b> is entangled with an oscillator from the other, showing genuine bipartite entanglement between collective operators.

40|$|With the {{advancement}} of CMOS process and fabrication, {{it has been a}} trend to maximize digital design while minimize analog correspondents in mixed-signal system designs. So is the case for PLL. PLL has always been a traditional mixed-signal system limited by analog part performance. Around 2000, there emerged ADPLL of which all the <b>blocks</b> besides <b>oscillator</b> are implemented in digital circuits. There have been successful examples in application of Bluetooth, and it is moving to improve results for application of WiMax and ad-hoc frequency hopping communication link. Based on the theoretic and measurement results of existing materials, ADPLL has shown advantages such as fast time-to-market, low area, low cost and better system integration; but it also showed disadvantages in frequency resolution and phase noise, etc. Also this new topic still opens questions in many researching points important to PLL such as tracking behavior and quantization effect. In this thesis, a non-linear phase domain model for all digital phase-locked loop (ADPLL) was established and validated. Based on that, we analyzed that ADPLL phase noise prediction derived from traditional linear quantization model became inaccurate in non-linear cases because its probability density of quantization error did not meet the premise assumption of linear model. The phenomena of bandwidth expansion and in-band phase noise decreasing peculiar to integer-N ADPLL were demonstrated and explained by matlab and verilog behavior level simulation test bench. The expression of threshold quantization step was defined and derived as the method to distinguish whether an integer-N ADPLL was in non-linear cases or not, and the results conformed to those of matlab simulation. A simplified approximation model for non-linear integer-N ADPLL with noise sources was established to predict in-band phase noise, and the trends of the results conformed to those of matlab simulation.
