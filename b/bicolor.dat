5|$|Today, many flags used in Poland {{are based}} on the design of the {{national}} flag. This applies especially to flags defined by Polish law and used by the Polish military and other uniformed services, such as the naval ensign – a swallow-tailed horizontal <b>bicolor</b> of white and red defaced with the arms of Poland in the white stripe. Flags of some administrative subdivisions also resemble the national flag. Examples include the former flag of the Lower Silesian Voivodeship – a horizontal <b>bicolor</b> of white and red defaced with the arms of the voivodeship – or the flag of the Lesser Poland Voivodeship – a horizontal tricolor of white, yellow and red with the yellow stripe half as wide as any of the other two.|$|E

5|$|Variety borealis has a {{slightly}} darker color scheme than the main species. The coloration in general is darker; the cap can vary from a bright apple red to a dark brick red with maturity, to almost purple in some instances. The pore surface has a varying coloration of orange red to red and becoming a dull brown red with age. The bruising coloration is a blue green and the spore print is olive brown. The distribution of variety borealis is relatively small, ranging from Michigan to the upper New England states. The similar distribution and coloration to Boletus carminiporus has caused the two to be confused. New molecular evidence shows that borealis is not closely related to Baorangia <b>bicolor</b> var. <b>bicolor.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{flag of the}} Grand Duchy of Posen, a Polish-populated {{autonomous}} province of the Kingdom of Prussia created in 1815, was a red-and-white horizontal <b>bicolor.</b> Its colors {{were taken from the}} duchy's coat of arms which consisted of the Prussian Black Eagle with an inescutcheon of the Polish White Eagle. With Germany's increasingly anti-Polish policy and a rising identification of white and red as Polish national colors, the red-and-white flag of Posen was replaced in 1886 with a white-black-white horizontal triband. No other part of Poland during the time of Partitions used a flag that would incorporate Polish national colors.|$|E
5|$|The fulvous {{whistling}} duck or fulvous tree duck (Dendrocygna <b>bicolor)</b> is a whistling duck that breeds {{across the}} world's tropical regions in much of Mexico and South America, the West Indies, the southern US, sub-Saharan Africa and the Indian subcontinent. It has mainly reddish brown plumage, long legs and a long grey bill, and shows a distinctive white band across its black tail in flight. Like other members of its ancient lineage, it has a whistling call which is given in flight or on the ground. The preferred habitat is shallow lakes, paddy fields or other wetlands with plentiful vegetation.|$|E

5|$|An American Museum of Natural History {{expedition}} led by Sydney Anderson {{collected the}} first three specimens of Oecomys sydandersoni in 1964 and 1965. The material was mentioned in passing in {{a report on the}} chiggers of the region and tentatively identified as O.concolor in publications of the 1990s. During studies in the Noel Kempff Mercado National Park (NKMNP) from 1997 to 2006, Smithsonian zoologist Louise Emmons and coworkers obtained large series of Oecomys, including four species—Oecomys <b>bicolor,</b> Oecomys roberti, Oecomys trinitatis, and a fourth species they could not identify to species level. In 2009, Michael Carleton, Louise Emmons, and Guy Musser described the latter as a new species, Oecomys sydandersoni, referring to it the specimens collected in the 1960s and previously identified as O.concolor. They named the new species after Sydney Anderson in honor of his work on the Bolivian mammal fauna, including the first collection of O.sydandersoni.|$|E
5|$|Baorangia <b>bicolor,</b> {{also known}} as the two-colored bolete or red and yellow bolete after its {{two-tone}} coloring scheme of red and yellow, is an edible fungus in the genus Baorangia. It inhabits most of eastern North America, primarily east of the Rocky Mountains and in season during the summer and fall months but can be found across the globe in China and Nepal. Its fruit body, the mushroom, is classed as medium or large in size, which helps distinguish it from the many similar appearing species that have a smaller stature. A deep blue/indigo bruising of the pore surface and a less dramatic bruising coloration change in the stem {{over a period of several}} minutes are identifying characteristics that distinguish it from the similar poisonous species Boletus sensibilis. There are two variations of this species, variety borealis and variety subreticulatus, and several other similar species of fungi are not poisonous.|$|E
5|$|The swamp wallaby (Wallabia <b>bicolor)</b> {{feeds on}} the fallen fruit of P.lanceolata and disperses the seed through its scat (dung). A field study in Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park found that 88% of {{seeds in the}} scat were still viable {{although}} dormant. The red-necked wallaby (Macropus rufogriseus) feeds on drupes and is a likely seed dispersal agent. Animals can convey seed {{for one or two}} kilometres from where they have fed. Rodents such as the bush rat (Rattus fuscipes) and black rat (Rattus rattus) eat the drupes but chew the seed so that only fragments leave their digestive system. Foxes have been reported to eat the fruit, and kangaroos and large birds such as currawongs are thought to as well.|$|E

5|$|The {{whistling}} ducks, Dendrocygna, are {{a distinctive}} {{group of eight}} bird species within the duck, goose and swan family Anatidae, which are characterised by a hump-backed, long-necked appearance and the whistled flight calls that give them their English name. They were an early split from the main duck lineage, and were predominant in the Late Miocene before the subsequent extensive radiation of more modern forms in the Pliocene and later. The fulvous whistling duck forms a superspecies with the wandering whistling duck.

5|$|White-and-red flags {{were first}} waved during a {{patriotic}} demonstration on May 3, 1916 in Warsaw.

On August 1, 1919, almost a year after Poland regained independence in November 1918, the Sejm officially introduced a white-and-red <b>bicolor</b> as the Polish national flag. In order to avoid confusion with the white-and-red maritime signal flag used internationally by harbor pilots and tugboats, the same act of Sejm introduced {{a variant of the}} flag with the coat of arms in the white stripe for use as a civil ensign and by Polish diplomats and consuls abroad.|$|E
5|$|Some of the driest {{land in the}} Everglades is pineland (also called pine rockland) ecosystem, {{located in}} the highest part of the Everglades with little to no hydroperiod. Some floors, however, may have flooded {{solution}} holes or puddles {{for a few months}} at a time. The most significant feature of the pineland is the single species of South Florida slash pine (Pinus elliottii). Pineland communities require fire to maintain them, and the trees have several adaptations that simultaneously promote and resist fire. The sandy floor of the pine forest is covered with dry pine needles that are highly flammable. South Florida slash pines are insulated by their bark to protect them from heat. Fire eliminates competing vegetation on the forest floor, and opens pine cones to germinate seeds. A period without significant fire can turn pineland into a hardwood hammock as larger trees overtake the slash pines. The understory shrubs in pine rocklands are the fire-resistant saw palmetto (Serenoa repens), cabbage palm (Sabal palmetto), and West Indian lilac (Tetrazygia <b>bicolor).</b> The most diverse group of plants in the pine community are the herbs, of which there are two dozen species. These plants contain tubers and other mechanisms that allow them to sprout quickly after being charred.|$|E
