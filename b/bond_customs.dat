50|$|Under bonding cover, Euler Hermes assumes {{liability}} for the beneficiary towards third parties {{for the most}} varied types of security (e.g. for obligations as a contractor under construction and supply contracts). Bonding is a guarantee for contractors and an alternative to bank bonding to safeguard liquidity.

Euler Hermes provides {{a wide variety of}} surety bonds and guarantees which support customers in numerous industries for all sorts of obligations (e.g. contract performance <b>bonds,</b> <b>custom</b> <b>bonds,</b> infrastructure bonds, etc.).

50|$|After a storm, the Rich Harvest {{put into}} port, flying the yellow Q flag to notify HM Customs & Excise (now HM Revenue & Customs) {{officers}} that dutiable goods were aboard. Customs were unsure what to do. At first they merely {{sought to make}} the vessel secure, to prevent unlawful unloading. The next day, a higher authority ordered the vessel to leave port within 36 hours, {{but just as the}} vessel was about to leave, Customs changed their mind and refused to allow the vessel and its cargo to depart. The cargo was seized and taken to a <b>bonded</b> <b>Customs</b> warehouse. Some weeks later, Customs decided to return the goods, but demanded that they be exported immediately. The goods were loaded onto a different vessel, a former Trinity House support vessel called the Cornish Maiden.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{proof of concept}} that machine {{learning}} techniques {{can be used to}} predict the properties of CNOHF energetic molecules from their molecular structures. We focus on a small but diverse dataset consisting of 109 molecular structures spread across ten compound classes. Up until now, candidate molecules for energetic materials have been screened using predictions from expensive quantum simulations and thermochemical codes. We present a comprehensive comparison of machine learning models and several molecular featurization methods - sum over <b>bonds,</b> <b>custom</b> descriptors, Coulomb matrices, Bag of Bonds, and fingerprints. The best featurization was sum over bonds (bond counting), and the best model was kernel ridge regression. Despite having a small data set, we obtain acceptable errors and Pearson correlations for the prediction of detonation pressure, detonation velocity, explosive energy, heat of formation, density, and other properties out of sample. By including another dataset with 309 additional molecules in our training we show how the error can be pushed lower, although the convergence with number of molecules is slow. Our work paves the way for future applications of machine learning in this domain, including automated lead generation and interpreting machine learning models to obtain novel chemical insights.

50|$|The Hall {{was used}} as a meeting place and pickup centre for the workers.

Prior to 1943, workers were selected according to the Bull System, that is workers for each shift were chosen by the shipping bosses. After that time, they were selected by the Union on a rotational basis. Both systems required the men to present themselves for work on notice of the arrival of a ship. In Maryborough some companies required the wharfies to meet at the wharves. Others, such as local firms Hyne and Son and Wilson Hart are recorded as using the Hall as a pickup centre, which, as a sheltered building with seating was preferred by the wharfies to the open sheds on the wharves.|$|R
