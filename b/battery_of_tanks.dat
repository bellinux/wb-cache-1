A <b>battery</b> <b>of</b> <b>tank</b> destroyers and self-propelled guns were to provide supporting direct fire at the pillboxes. As the leading rifle platoon of C Company assaulted the first pillbox, flanking fire from a nearby pillbox gun emplacement took the platoon in crossfire.

2500|$|The French Army did {{not intend}} to create an {{independent}} tank force; the tank units would be part of the Artillery Arm, which was reflected in the organisational terminology. The basic units were officially called Groupes, but had the designation [...] "AS", for Artillerie Spéciale. Each group consisted <b>of</b> four <b>batteries,</b> each <b>battery</b> again <b>of</b> four <b>tanks.</b> This would have resulted in a total <b>of</b> sixteen <b>tanks</b> and indeed this was the official organic strength of an AS, but the fourth battery was normally a depot unit, intended to provide replacement vehicles and crews for the other three batteries. It had an official allotment <b>of</b> three <b>tanks</b> and the total matériel strength of an AS was thus fifteen. Actual operational strength varied wildly, due to frequent breakdowns. The personnel strength consisted of twelve officers — each commanding a <b>tank</b> <b>of</b> the three regular batteries — sixteen NCOs and 110 men of lower rank. [...] In practice often four <b>batteries</b> <b>of</b> three <b>tanks</b> were fielded, to allow for a greater tactical flexibility. The first Schneider CA units were formed from 17 November 1916 onwards. [...] Six AS were raised until the end of January 1917, three more in February and March each and again two in April and May each for a total of seventeen operational Groupes, numbered AS 1–17. [...] Three more had been created by 2 June 1917, AS 18, 19 and 20, but were almost immediately dissolved, their personnel retrained to form Saint Chamond units. Between 1 March and 1 May 1917 the AS were combined into five larger units, called Groupements, with a variable strength. In May 1918, three of the surviving four Groupements, I, II and IV, were each attached to three light tank Renault FT battalions to form larger Régiments de Artillerie Spéciale, the 501e, 502e and 504e RAS respectively.|$|R

On 22 June 2012, the Syrian Air Defence Force shot down a Turkish McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II reconnaissance jet. The jet's pilots were killed; both Turkish and Syrian forces searched for them before recovering their bodies in early July. The incident greatly escalated the tensions between Turkey and Syria.|$|R
2500|$|Three Groupements were {{committed}} to the offensive. [...] Two of these, named after their commanders Louis Bossut and Louis Léonard Chaubès, were attached to the 32nd and 5th Army Corps respectively and would engage on the first day. [...] Groupement Bossut consisted of five groupes: AS 2, 4, 5, 6 and 9, thus fielding eighty tanks, as the AS in {{this phase of the}} war operated at full strength with four <b>batteries</b> <b>of</b> four <b>tanks.</b> Groupement Chaubès, created on 8 March, included AS 3, 7 and 8, with about forty-eight tanks. [...] Each Groupement was reinforced by a supply and recovery unit or Section de Réparations et de Ravitaillement which besides two unarmed Saint-Chamonds and some Baby Holt tractors was equipped with two unarmed Schneider CA tanks, towing Troy trailers with fuel, bringing the total at 132 Schneider vehicles, at that date the largest tank force ever deployed. On 13 April the tank units concentrated behind the frontline. There they were joined by supporting infantry companies: five from the 154e R.I. of the 165e D.I. for Groupement Bossut and three of the 76e R.I. of the 125e D.I. for Groupement Chaubès.|$|R

In a heated telephone conversation with Montgomery, Gatehouse said that he concurred with Lumsden and that to advance through uncharted and uncleared minefields, covered by strong <b>batteries</b> <b>of</b> anti-tank guns, with the noise <b>of</b> <b>tank</b> tracks making surprise impossible, would be disastrous. Montgomery modified the scope of the attack from six armoured regiments to one: the Staffordshire Yeomanry.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study vas to {{determine}} the digestibility of dry matter (DM), crude protein (CP), and gross energy (GE) of three ingredients in capaz (Pimelodus grosskopfii). Ninety specimens of capaz were used. They weighted and sized about 114 ± 15 g and 23 ± 0. 5 cm respectively. In order to collect the feces a <b>battery</b> <b>of</b> three fiberglass <b>tanks</b> with a capacity of 200 L, and conical bottom (modified Guelph system) was used. The ADC of ingredients were calculated by indirect method using chromic oxide 0. 5 % as a marker. A semipurified diet was used as base. Three experimental diets were stu-died each with 30 % of the ingredient to be analyzed. The ADC for DM did not show significant differences (P_ 0. 05); it was observed in the values of the ADC of protein and energy for the different ingredients (P< 0. 05). The ADC of protein for fish meal was significantly higher (94. 5 %) compared with meat meal (59. 6 %). There {{was no significant difference between}} the blood meal and other ingredients (78. 5 %), in contrast, the ADC protein to energy showed some differences with meat meal.
