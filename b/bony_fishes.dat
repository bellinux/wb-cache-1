5|$|Fleshy lobe-fins {{supported}} on bones rather than ray-stiffened fins {{seem to have}} been an ancestral trait of all <b>bony</b> <b>fishes</b> (Osteichthyes). The lobe-finned ancestors of the tetrapods evolved them further, while the ancestors of the ray-finned fishes (Actinopterygii) evolved their fins in a different direction. The most primitive group of actinopterygians, the bichirs, still have fleshy frontal fins.|$|E
5|$|It is {{now clear}} that the common {{ancestor}} of the <b>bony</b> <b>fishes</b> (Osteichthyes) had a primitive air-breathing lung—later evolved into a swim bladder in most actinopterygians (ray-finned fishes). This suggests that crossopterygians evolved in warm shallow waters, using their simple lung when the oxygen level in the water became too low.|$|E
5|$|The whiskery shark is {{an active}} and highly {{specialized}} predator, feeding almost exclusively on octopuses. Other cephalopods, <b>bony</b> <b>fishes,</b> small rock lobsters, spoon worms, and seagrass have also been found amongst its stomach contents. A known parasite of this species is the tapeworm Calliobothrium pritchardae.|$|E
50|$|About 90% of the world's <b>fish</b> {{species are}} <b>bony</b> <b>fish.</b> In simple terms, a <b>bony</b> <b>fish</b> is one whose {{skeleton}} {{is made of}} bone. <b>Bony</b> <b>fish</b> also have a hard, bony plate covering their gills. This feature is called an operculum. <b>Bony</b> <b>fish</b> may also have distinct rays, or spines, in their fins.|$|R
50|$|Food: Small <b>bony</b> <b>fish</b> or invertebrates.|$|R
50|$|Early <b>bony</b> <b>fish</b> had simple lungs (a pouch {{on either}} side of the esophagus) which helped them breathe in low-oxygen water. In many <b>bony</b> <b>fish</b> these have evolved into swim bladders, which help the body create a neutral balance between sinking and floating. (The lungs of amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals were {{inherited}} from their <b>bony</b> <b>fish</b> ancestors.) They do not have fin spines, but instead support the fin with lepidotrichia (bone fin rays). They also have an operculum, which helps them breathe without having to swim.|$|R
5|$|There is {{evidence}} of a mass kill of <b>bony</b> <b>fishes</b> at a fossil site immediately above the K–Pg boundary layer on Seymour Island near Antarctica, apparently precipitated by the K–Pg extinction event, however, the marine and freshwater environments of fishes mitigated environmental effects of the extinction event.|$|E
5|$|A {{powerful}} and versatile deepwater predator, the short, robust jaws of the kitefin shark {{give it an}} enormously strong bite. It feeds mainly on <b>bony</b> <b>fishes</b> (including deepwater smelts, viperfishes, scaly dragonfishes, barracudinas, greeneyes, lanternfishes, bristlemouths, cod and other gadids, grenadiers, deepwater scorpionfishes, bonito, snake mackerels, deepwater cardinalfishes, and sea toads), but also takes {{a wide variety of}} other animals, including skates, smaller sharks (Galeus, Squalus, Etmopterus and Centrophorus), squid and octopus, crustaceans (amphipods, isopods, shrimp and lobsters), polychaete worms, and siphonophores. Like the related cookiecutter shark, the kitefin shark is also capable of excising chunks of flesh from animals larger than itself, including other sharks and whales. The presence of fast-swimming fishes in its diet suggests the kitefin shark may scavenge, or have some other means of capturing faster prey. In the Mediterranean, <b>bony</b> <b>fishes</b> are the most important food year-round, with the second-most important prey being sharks in the winter and spring, crustaceans in the summer, and cephalopods in the fall. Captured males {{are more likely to have}} full stomachs than females for unknown reasons.|$|E
5|$|In general, teleosts {{tend to be}} {{quicker and}} more {{flexible}} than more basal <b>bony</b> <b>fishes.</b> Their skeletal structure has evolved towards greater lightness. While teleost bones are well calcified, they are constructed from a scaffolding of struts, rather than the dense cancellous bones of holostean fish. In addition, the lower jaw of the teleost is reduced to just three bones; the dentary, the angular bone and the articular bone.|$|E
50|$|In <b>bony</b> <b>fish,</b> {{the gills}} {{lie in a}} branchial chamber covered by a bony operculum. The great {{majority}} of <b>bony</b> <b>fish</b> species have five pairs of gills, although a few have lost some {{over the course of}} evolution. The operculum can be important in adjusting the pressure of water inside of the pharynx to allow proper ventilation of the gills, so <b>bony</b> <b>fish</b> do not have to rely on ram ventilation (and hence near constant motion) to breathe. Valves inside the mouth keep the water from escaping.|$|R

5|$|Little {{is known}} of the smoothtooth blacktip shark's natural history; it likely inhabits shallow waters and feeds on small <b>bony</b> <b>fishes.</b> It is presumably {{viviparous}} like other members of its family. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) last assessed this species as Endangered. Although more specimens have since been discovered, the conservation status of this species remains precarious due to heavy fishing and habitat degradation within its range.|$|E
5|$|The {{peppered}} maskray {{prefers to}} pick prey {{from the surface}} of the substrate, as opposed to digging for them. Caridean shrimp are by far the most important food source. It also consumes polychaete worms and amphipods, and rarely penaeid prawns, molluscs, and small <b>bony</b> <b>fishes.</b> Compared to smaller rays, larger rays have a more varied diet that incorporates a greater proportion of polychaete worms.|$|E
5|$|The plain maskray {{generally}} hunts at {{the surface}} of the bottom substrate, rather than digging for prey. Its diet consists predominantly of caridean shrimp and polychaete worms. Small <b>bony</b> <b>fishes</b> are also eaten, along with the occasional penaeid prawn or amphipod. Larger rays consume a greater variety of prey and relatively more polychaete worms when compared to smaller rays. This species is parasitized by the tapeworm Acanthobothrium jonesi.|$|E

50|$|In a {{study of}} early jawed {{vertebrate}} relationships, Davis et al. (2012) found acanthodians to be split among the two major clades Osteichthyes (<b>bony</b> <b>fish)</b> and Chondrichthyes (cartilaginous fish). The well-known acanthodian Acanthodes was placed within Osteichthyes, {{despite the presence of}} many chondrichthyan characteristics in its braincase. However, a newly described Silurian placoderm, Entelognathus, which has jaw anatomy shared with <b>bony</b> <b>fish</b> and tetrapods, has led to revisions of this phylogeny: acanthodians are now considered to be a paraphyletic assemblage leading to cartilaginous <b>fish,</b> while <b>bony</b> <b>fish</b> evolved from placoderm ancestors.|$|R
50|$|In <b>bony</b> <b>fish,</b> {{the gills}} {{lie in a}} branchial chamber covered by a bony operculum. The great {{majority}} of <b>bony</b> <b>fish</b> species have five pairs of gills, although a few have lost some {{over the course of}} evolution. The operculum can be important in adjusting the pressure of water inside of the pharynx to allow proper ventilation of the gills, so that <b>bony</b> <b>fish</b> do not have to rely on ram ventilation (and hence near constant motion) to breathe. Valves inside the mouth keep the water from escaping.|$|R
5|$|The winghead shark usually hunts {{close to}} the sea floor. Its diet {{consists}} mainly of small <b>bony</b> <b>fishes,</b> followed by crustaceans and cephalopods. Known parasites of this species include the tapeworms Callitetrarhynchus blochii, Heteronybelinia heteromorphi, Otobothrium carcharidis, O. mugilis, Phoreiobothrium puriensis, and Phyllobothrium blochii, the nematodes Hysterothylacium ganeshi, Pseudanisakis sp., Raphidascaroides blochii, and Terranova sp., the copepod Caligus furcisetifer, and the protozoan Eimeria zygaenae.|$|E
5|$|A small, fast-swimming predator, the blacknose shark feeds {{primarily}} on small, <b>bony</b> <b>fishes,</b> including pinfish, croakers, porgies, anchovies, spiny boxfish, and porcupinefish, {{as well as}} on octopus and other cephalopods. When competing for bait, their speed allows them to snatch food from larger sharks such as the Caribbean reef shark (C. perezi). This species may form large schools that are sometimes associated with anchovies and mullet. Blacknose sharks demonstrate a high degree of philopatry: both juveniles and adults have been documented returning to the same local area year after year.|$|E
5|$|Common and gregarious, the hardnose shark is a {{predator}} of <b>bony</b> <b>fishes,</b> cephalopods, and crustaceans. This species is viviparous, {{with the growing}} embryos sustained to term via a placental connection to their mother. Females have a biennial reproductive cycle and bear litters {{of one or two}} pups after a twelve-month gestation period. The hardnose shark is fished for meat throughout its range and, given its low reproductive rate, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed it as Near Threatened.|$|E

5|$|In mammals {{there are}} two types of {{immunoglobulin}} light chain, which are called lambda (λ) and kappa (κ). A light chain has two successive domains: one constant domain and one variable domain. The approximate length of a light chain is 211 to 217 amino acids. Each antibody contains two light chains that are always identical; only one type of light chain, κ or λ, is present per antibody in mammals. Other types of light chains, such as the iota (ι) chain, are found in other vertebrates like sharks (Chondrichthyes) and <b>bony</b> <b>fishes</b> (Teleostei).|$|E
5|$|Inhabiting {{continental}} {{margins and}} oceanic waters at depths of , the {{bigeye sand tiger}} may make vertical and horizontal migratory movements. It feeds on <b>bony</b> <b>fishes</b> and squid, and its sizable eyes and dark coloration suggest that it may spend most of its time in the mesopelagic zone. Reproduction is probably viviparous with oophagous embryos like in other mackerel shark species. This shark is caught incidentally by commercial fisheries, though so infrequently that the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) cannot yet determine its conservation status.|$|E
5|$|The bowmouth {{guitarfish}} is {{a strong}} swimmer that propels itself with its tail like a shark. It is more active at night and is not known to be territorial. This species feeds mainly on demersal <b>bony</b> <b>fishes</b> such as croakers and crustaceans such as crabs and shrimp; bivalves and cephalopods are also consumed. Its bands of flattened teeth allow it to crush hard-shelled prey. Curiously, two bowmouth guitarfishes examined in a 2011 stable isotope study {{were found to have}} fed on pelagic rather than demersal animals, in contrast to previous observations.|$|E

5|$|The diet of the {{bramble shark}} {{includes}} smaller sharks, <b>bony</b> <b>fishes,</b> and crabs, which this slow-moving species may capture via suction. It is aplacental viviparous, with females producing litters of 15–52 pups. Harmless to humans, {{it is an}} occasional bycatch of commercial and recreational fishers, and {{may be used for}} fishmeal and liver oil. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) presently lacks enough information to assess the conservation status of this species. However, its population has declined substantially in the northeastern Atlantic since the 18th and 19th centuries, likely because of overfishing.|$|E
5|$|The {{reticulate}} whipray preys on {{a variety}} of benthic and neritic organisms, including crabs, shrimps, mantis shrimps, bivalves, gastropods, worms, jellyfish, and <b>bony</b> <b>fishes.</b> In the western Indian Ocean, about two-thirds of its diet consists of fishes, in particular ponyfish and anchovies, with shrimps and other crustaceans making up most of the remainder. By contrast, rays in Australian waters are apparently not piscivorous, and are known to consume penaeid prawns. Known parasites of this species include Anthrobothrium loculatum, Dendromonocotyle colorni, Halysiorhynchus macrocephalus, Monocotyle helicophallus, M. multiparous, and M. spiremae, Thaumatocotyle australensis, and Tylocephalum chiralensis.|$|E
5|$|The tiger {{catshark}} is {{a sluggish}} predator of a {{diverse array of}} benthic organisms. Its diet is dominated by <b>bony</b> <b>fishes</b> and crustaceans, and also includes cephalopods, polychaete worms, smaller sharks, and scavenged fish offal. It has been observed at the spawning grounds of the chokka squid (Loligo vulgaris reynaudi), feeding on squid that have descended to the bottom to mate and deposit eggs. Documented predators of this species include the broadnose sevengill shark (Notorynchus cepedianus) and the ragged tooth shark (Carcharias taurus).|$|E
