Although Bill was somewhat surprised at his companion not beginning work at the usual time he asked no questions, for his faith in George was so unbounded that everything he did was right in his eyes.|$|R

The {{novelty of}} the trip, the rude shanty, with its litter of shavings, and its boxes for chairs, <b>the</b> <b>bundles</b> of <b>hay</b> for beds, gave her {{something}} like the same pleasure a picnic might have done. It appealed to the primeval in her. She forgot her homesickness and her vague regrets, and her smiles filled her husband with content.|$|R
60|$|This really {{seemed the}} only {{possible}} explanation. Such an event would not have come as a surprise.

60|$|And, sure enough, poor Featherhead ran distracted {{with terror}} up and down, through <b>the</b> <b>bundles</b> of <b>hay,</b> between barrels, and over casks, {{but with the}} barking terrier ever at his heels, and the boys running, shouting, and cheering his pursuer on. He was glad at last to escape through a crack, though he left half of his fine brush behind him; for Master Wasp the terrier made a snap at it {{just as he was}} going, and cleaned all the hair off of it, so that it was bare as a rat's tail.|$|R

60|$|Here again (there {{really did}} {{seem to be a}} sort of {{fatality}} in this case) we reached no useful result. It was easy enough to find out the wholesale cutlers, who had manufactured the knife at Sheffield, by the mark on the blade. But they made tens of thousands of such knives, and disposed of them to retail dealers all over Great Britain--to say nothing of foreign parts. As to finding out the person who had engraved the imperfect inscription (without knowing where, or by whom, the knife had been purchased) we might as well have looked for the proverbial needle in <b>the</b> <b>bundle</b> of <b>hay.</b> Our last resource was to have the knife photographed, with the inscribed side uppermost, and to send copies to every police-station in the kingdom.|$|R
50|$|The signa militaria {{were the}} Roman {{military}} ensigns or standards. The most ancient standard {{employed by the}} Romans {{is said to have}} been a handful (manipulus) of straw fixed to the top of a spear or pole. Hence the company of soldiers belonging to it was called a maniple. <b>The</b> <b>bundle</b> of <b>hay</b> or fern was soon succeeded by the figures of animals, of which Pliny the Elder (H.N. x.16) enumerates five: the eagle, the wolf, the ox with the man's head, the horse, and the boar. In the second consulship of Gaius Marius (104 BC) the four quadrupeds were laid aside as standards, the eagle (Aquila) alone being retained. It was made of silver, or bronze, with outstretched wings, but was probably of a relatively small size, since a standard-bearer (signifer) under Julius Caesar is said in circumstances of danger to have wrenched the eagle from its staff and concealed it in the folds of his girdle.|$|R

60|$|Away to the right, an old {{man might}} be seen tying up the lid of a basket full of fish beside his cart, and {{dividing}} his attention between the basket and the horse, which latter, much to his surprise, was unwontedly restive that evening, and required an unusual number of cautions to remain still, and of threats as to the punishment that would follow continued disobedience, all of which afforded the most intense and unutterable delight to a very small precocious boy, who, standing concealed on the off side of the animal, tickled its ear with a straw every time it bent its head towards <b>the</b> <b>bundle</b> of <b>hay</b> which lay at its feet. No clown or pantaloon was there to inflict condign punishment, because none was needed. A brother carter standing by performed the part, extempore.
