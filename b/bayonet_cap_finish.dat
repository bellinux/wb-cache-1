5000|$|... #Caption: The double-contact <b>bayonet</b> <b>cap</b> on an {{incandescent}} bulb ...|$|R
50|$|<b>Bayonet</b> bases or <b>caps</b> {{are often}} {{abbreviated}} to BA, {{often with a}} number after. The number refers to {{the diameter of the}} base (e.g., BA22 is a 22 mm diameter <b>bayonet</b> <b>cap</b> lamp). BA15, a 15 mm base, can also be referred to as SBC standing for small <b>bayonet</b> <b>cap.</b> The lower-case letter s or d specifies whether the bulb has single or double contacts.|$|R
25|$|Various {{styles of}} <b>bayonet</b> <b>cap</b> and mounts {{are used for}} a variety of sizes and types of bulbs, {{including}} spots and halogens.|$|R
50|$|There {{are also}} {{adapters}} between screw sizes, and for adapting {{to or from}} <b>bayonet</b> <b>caps.</b> A socket extender makes the bulb stick out further, such as to accommodate a compact fluorescent lamp with a self-ballast that doesn't fit in a recessed lighting fixture.|$|R
50|$|Bayonet mount bulbs {{are used}} in most {{standard}} fittings and have been the dominant standard in most installations since the introduction of electric lighting in Ireland.Various styles of <b>bayonet</b> <b>cap</b> and mounts are used {{for a variety of}} sizes and types of bulbs, including spots and halogens.|$|R
50|$|An {{electric}} {{light is}} {{a device that}} produces visible light by the flow of electric current. It {{is the most common}} form of artificial lighting and is essential to modern society, providing interior lighting for buildings and exterior light for evening and nighttime activities. In technical usage, a replaceable component that produces light from electricity is called a lamp. Compact lamps are commonly called light bulbs; for example, the incandescent light bulb. Lamps usually have a base made of ceramic, metal, glass or plastic, which secures the lamp in the socket of a light fixture. The electrical connection to the socket may be made with a screw-thread base, two metal pins, two metal <b>caps</b> or a <b>bayonet</b> <b>cap.</b>|$|R
2500|$|A {{lampholder}} plug {{fits into}} the <b>bayonet</b> <b>cap</b> or Edison screw socket of a lampholder {{in place of a}} light bulb and enables an electrical appliance to be powered from a wall or ceiling light fitting. As mentioned in Early History above, they were first introduced in the late 1800s and in use to the 1960s in situations where wall sockets were scarce and sometimes non-existent in some rooms (bathrooms, cellars, attics, etc.). Also, as in some countries (such as Italy) electricity was supplied on a [...] "split tariff" [...] basis with electricity for lighting being charged at a lower rate than that for other purposes, lampholder plugs enabled the consumers to reduce their electricity costs and were thus in broad use.|$|R
50|$|The Bears fell hard in 1940, {{finishing}} last in {{the league}} with a 6-16 record. Returning to Jacksonville, the Red <b>Caps</b> <b>finished</b> second from last with an 8-10 record in league play. They fared no better in 1942 season, going 2-6 before dropping from the league in July.|$|R

50|$|However, {{due to a}} solid {{record in}} their real home games, the <b>Caps</b> <b>finished</b> the season with 44 wins and 40 losses. The Caps' record put them in third place in the Western Division, 7 games behind the Denver Rockets and 1 game behind the Dallas Chaparrals. In the 1970 ABA Playoffs the Caps faced the Denver Rockets in the Western Division semifinals and took the series to seven games before losing 143-119 in the finale in Denver.|$|R
50|$|Vancouver Whitecaps FC and Chicago Fire {{played to}} a 1-1 draw on February 23, 2013 {{in the final}} game for both teams at the Carolina Challenge Cup. The draw gave the Chicago Fire the win for the tournament. Mattocks scored his fifth of the {{pre-season}} on a penalty kick in the 68th minute. Miller was tackled in the box to get the Whitecaps the penalty kick opportunity. The <b>Caps</b> <b>finished</b> the Carolina Cup with a 1-1-1 record.|$|R
5000|$|Lewis Island {{was formed}} about 8400 {{years ago when}} sea levels rose {{at the start of}} the Holocene.The island’s {{structure}} consists of granite outcrop <b>finished</b> with a <b>capping</b> of calcarenite. Unlike the neighbouring islands, the island’s <b>cap</b> <b>finishes</b> in a peak at its southern end rather in lieu of a flat plateau. [...] The island rises from the seabed at 30 m over a distance of within 100 m on its west, south and east faces.|$|R
5000|$|The all-glass PF1 bulb was {{introduced}} in 1954. [...] Eliminating both the metal base, and the multiple manufacturing steps needed to attach it to the glass bulb, cut the cost substantially compared to the larger M series bulbs. The design required a fibre ring around the base to hold the contact wires {{against the side of}} the glass base. An adapter was available allowing the bulb to fit into flash guns that accepted the <b>bayonet</b> <b>capped</b> bulbs. The PF1 (along with the M2) had a faster ignition time (less delay between shutter contact and peak output), so it could be used with X synch below 1/30 of a second—while most bulbs require a shutter speed of 1/15 on X synch to keep the shutter open long enough for the bulb to ignite and burn. A smaller version, the AG-1 {{was introduced}} in 1958 which did not require the fibre ring. Though it was smaller and had reduced light output, it was cheaper to manufacture and rapidly supplanted the PF1.|$|R
50|$|The {{exposure}} meter uses a circular CdS cell 8.5 mm in diameter (coverage with 50 mm lens = 21°), {{and having a}} sensitivity of -0 (some estimates claim -1) - 20 Ev at 100 ASA (0.3-0.4 asb at f/1.4 to 200 000 asb; 0,06 to 32.000 cd/m2). Information from the {{exposure meter}} is displayed using a dual match needle system {{at the bottom of}} the viewfinder. An additional illuminator window at the top of the viewfinder illuminates the readout bar. The M5 exposure meter can be set from ISO 6/9° to ISO 3200/36°. The ASA/DIN film speed knob is designed to prevent inadvertent change. The meter's circuit is powered up by winding the camera, and shuts down when the shutter is released. The M5 exposure meter required the PX625 1.35 V mercuric oxide coin type cell which was banned because of its mercury content. The M5 continues to run on a number of alternatives including the WeincellTM MRB625. The battery compartment is located between the strap lugs. It is accessed by using a coin slot type threaded cap and is superior in design to that of the <b>bayonet</b> <b>caps</b> that surfaced as of the M6.|$|R
50|$|All {{teams from}} the 1949-50 season return. The York Victory A.C. is renamed the York Professionals. The Harrisburg Senators fold in mid-season; they are {{replaced}} by the Harrisburg <b>Caps,</b> who <b>finish</b> out the year.|$|R
50|$|The bayonet {{light bulb}} mount is the {{standard}} fitting in many {{former members of the}} British Empire including the United Kingdom, Australia, India, Ireland, and New Zealand, as well as parts of the Middle East and Africa (although not Canada, which primarily uses Edison screw sockets along with the United States and Mexico). The standard size is B22d-2, often referred to in the context of lighting as simply BC. Older installations in some other countries, including France and Greece use this base. First developed by St. George Lane Fox-Pitt in the UK and improved upon by the Brush Electric Company from the late 1870s onward, standard bulbs have two pins {{on opposite sides of the}} cap; however, some specialized bulbs have three pins (cap designation B22d-3) to prevent use in domestic light fittings. Examples of three-pin bulbs are found in mercury street lamps and fireglow bulbs in some older models of electric radiative heater. Older railway carriages in the UK also made use of a 3 pin bulb base to discourage theft. <b>Bayonet</b> <b>cap</b> bulbs are also very common worldwide in applications where vibration may loosen screw-mount bulbs, such as automotive lighting and other small , and in many flashlights. In many other countries the Edison screw (E) base is used for lighting.|$|R
50|$|The Capitals {{would make}} the playoffs {{for each of the}} next 14 years in a row. They became known for {{starting}} slow before catching fire in January and February. However, regular-season success did not carry into the playoffs. Despite a continuous march of stars like Gartner, Carpenter, Langway, Gustafsson, Mike Ridley, Dave Christian, Dino Ciccarelli, Larry Murphy and Kevin Hatcher, Washington was knocked out in either the first or second round eight years in a row. In 1985-86, for instance, the <b>Caps</b> <b>finished</b> with 107 points and won 50 games {{for the first time in}} franchise history, good enough for the third-best record in the NHL. They defeated the Islanders in the first round but were eliminated in the second round by the New York Rangers.|$|R

2500|$|Simpson {{lobbied for}} Thomson's {{appointment}} as vice-captain {{of the team}} to tour the West Indies. Thomson produced his fastest spell since his comeback in the second Test at Bridgetown, Barbados, when he knocked off Viv Richards' <b>cap</b> and <b>finished</b> with 6/77. However, his bowling fell away in the later Tests.|$|R
5000|$|Barry {{played the}} 1969-70 {{season with the}} ABA's Washington Caps. Barry {{did not like the}} move and refused to report to the team, at one point commenting, [...] "If I wanted to go to Washington, I'd run for president!" [...] He missed the first 32 games before the ABA forced him to join the team. The Caps played in the Western Division, making for a grueling travel schedule. The <b>Caps</b> <b>finished</b> 44-40, {{claiming}} third place in the Western Division. Appearing in only 52 games due to a knee injury, Barry finished the season with 1,442 points, second best in the ABA (27.7 points per game). The Denver Rockets defeated the Caps, 4 games to 3, in the Western Division semifinals. As the seventh and deciding game drew to a close, Barry was ejected for fighting with Rockets players.|$|R

25|$|On 30 March 1945, <b>Cap</b> Arcona <b>finished</b> {{her third}} and last trip between Gdynia and Copenhagen, {{carrying}} 9,000 soldiers and refugees. However, her turbines were completely worn out. They {{could only be}} partially repaired and her days of long-distance travel were over. She was decommissioned, returned to her owners Hamburg-Süd and ordered out of Copenhagen Harbour to Neustadt Bay.|$|R
5000|$|Changes for 1972 {{included}} a revised grille without the central divider of the 1970 and 1971 items, new surface-mounted sidemarker lights {{rather than the}} previous flush-mount units, a new instrument cluster featuring a large rectangular speedometer and several small round gauges; the AM/FM radio option returned. The Demon had new fender-mounted metal [...] "Demon" [...] badges without the small devil character on the 1971 decals. The [...] "Demon" [...] decal on {{the rear of the}} car was replaced by Dodge and Dart emblems on the lower right edge of the deck lid. Some Demons with the side and rear panel tape stripes retained the tape devil character. A new optional single hood scoop replaced 1971's dual scoops, and was coupled with a hood paint blackout that had been standard on the 1971 high-trim/high-value Demon Sizzler model. Cars equipped with the optional rally wheels now came with newly restyled center <b>caps</b> <b>finished</b> in a light argent (silver) paint. Demon production was substantially less than Duster's; this is reflected in higher collector car values for the Demon, especially V8 models.|$|R
50|$|Sunrisers Hyderabad captain David Warner won the Orange Cap for {{the leading}} run-scorer {{of the tournament}} with 641 runs. Bhuvneshwar Kumar, also of Sunrisers Hyderabad, was awarded the Purple <b>Cap</b> for <b>finishing</b> as the leading wicket-taker of the tournament with 26 wickets. Rising Pune Supergiant's Ben Stokes was named Most Valuable Player, also known as Man of the Series, while Basil Thampi of Gujarat Lions was named the Emerging Player of the Tournament.|$|R
50|$|On 8 May, Peats {{made his}} third {{appearance}} at hooker for the City Origin team. On 11 May, following the Parramatta Eels salary cap breach, Peats joined the Gold Coast Titans effective immediately {{on a contract}} {{to the end of}} 2017, after he was asked to leave to help get the Eels back under the salary <b>cap.</b> Peats <b>finished</b> his time with the Eels {{in the middle of the}} season, playing in 6 matches and scoring a try.|$|R
50|$|In 1970 O'Neil {{became the}} first player to play over 50 games for Wellington, he is {{currently}} the second most <b>capped</b> player, after <b>finishing</b> his career with 74 caps. O'Neil also played for the North Island in 1964 and 1965 and for Southern Zone from 1967 to 1969.|$|R
50|$|In all his six <b>caps</b> he <b>finished</b> on {{the losing}} side just once; 1-2 against Scotland in 1913. In a hard-fought and crowd-troubled match at Dalymount Park, his home ground, McConnell put in an {{energetic}} performance, and only the mis-firing forward-line denied the Irish a more favourable result. He {{was part of an}} Ireland squad which contained such notable footballers as Bill Lacey, Val Harris and Billy Gillespie however the outbreak of War and the suspension of international games meant that McConnell was not able to build on the success of 1914.|$|R
50|$|Perović {{played for}} the FR Yugoslavian U16 {{national}} team at the 2001 European Championship and won a gold medal.He began his senior national team career at the EuroBasket 2003 when Serbia and Montenegro finished with 6th place. Perović {{has also been a}} member of the senior men's Serbian national basketball team. With them he won the silver medal at the EuroBasket 2009. In the following year, he was member of team that finished 4th at the World Championship in Turkey. At the EuroBasket 2011 in Lithuania, where he was <b>capped,</b> Serbia <b>finished</b> 8th.|$|R
50|$|NC State <b>capped</b> a {{marvelous}} <b>finish,</b> finishing at 7-5, after starting the season 2-4. South Florida finished {{the game with}} 295 yards of total offense, including 118 rushing yards by Andre Hall. Overall, NC State's defense played magnificently. Stephen Tulloch was named the game's MVP by recording 15 tackles, three sacks, and one forced fumble.|$|R
50|$|On 25 June, Bosnia-Herzegovina {{recorded}} {{its first}} World Cup victory, beating Iran 3-1, {{with the goals}} scored by Edin Džeko, Miralem Pjanić and Avdija Vršajević. Due to Bosnia's early elimination from the tournament, coach Safet Sušić experimented with the starting XI for this game, returning to a two-man front line that featured throughout qualifiers, and giving young players (who took no part in qualifiers) World Cup game time {{with the likes of}} Anel Hadžić (3rd cap), Tino-Sven Sušić (4th cap), Sead Kolašinac (6th cap) and Muhamed Bešić (12th <b>cap).</b> Bosnia <b>finished</b> the tournament in Group stage placed third, with three points from three matches played.|$|R
50|$|He {{started his}} {{football}} career {{in his hometown}} Humbeek, playing for KFC Humbeek and was discovered at the early age of eighteen by a scout from RSC Anderlecht. For {{more than ten years}} he was their central defender and helped them win three European trophies, three national championships and four Belgian Cups. Between 1974 and 1986 he represented Belgium, gaining 24 <b>caps</b> and <b>finishing</b> fourth at the World Cup in Mexico in 1986. In 1983 Broos switched teams and started playing for Club Brugge. He played there for five seasons until season 1987-88. During this period he helped his team gain the Belgian Cup in 1986 and the championship in 1988. In 1988 Broos retired as a professional footballer.|$|R
