30|$|High {{dynamic stress}} (σ_d). During shallow mining, the coal-rock mass around roadways and coalfaces {{presents}} low original stress. However, {{due to the}} high energy released by far-field mine tremor, the dynamic stress converted from the tremor source to the coal mass show high instantaneous increment. Thus, the total stress may also exceed the critical stress level of dynamic failure. Therefore, coal masses develop sudden dynamic failure. In addition, researches (He 2013) prove that, coal rocks exhibit higher <b>burst</b> <b>tendency</b> under high loading rate than that under normal state. Moreover, the coal rocks that are originally identified as no <b>burst</b> <b>tendency</b> may also show burst failure given high loading rate or dynamic load. Here, the instantaneous dynamic disturbance of mine tremor plays a dominant role in the burst failure process. This is why the rockburst may also be observed in the shallow mining process or the coal rocks without <b>burst</b> <b>tendency</b> originally identified.|$|R

40|$|Blasting is an {{effective}} approach to pressure relief in coal mine roadway with rock <b>burst</b> <b>tendency.</b> To investigate the effect of blast impact on bolting support system and surrounding rock, dynamic response of bolting support roadway was numerically studied using FLAC 3 D. Firstly, the excavation and the bolting support of roadway were conducted to achieve the static equilibrium and then, with the built-in dynamic mode, blasting to pressure relief in the drill hole was performed in dynamics. The evolution of rock bolt axial force, grout shear stress and deformation of coal roadway were analyzed {{with regard to the}} time. The results show that, in the process of blasting impact, (1) the axial force of the first free bolt length (in the near end of roadway) increased by 6. 54 % in maximum; the shear stress of grout changed 43. 6 % in maximum. Hence, the near end of rock bolt and the bolt grout are weak points which may firstly fail under blast loading; (2) With the same distance to blasting position, the axial force of rock bolt is affected by its installation angle inclined to the blast borehole; and (3) the peak value of the axial force due to blasting impact can be reduced by adopting millisecond delay blasting approach. The maximum increment of axial force is reduced from 3. 94 % to 2. 86 % while using millisecond delay blast method. However, the influence of different delay time interval on the maximum increment of axial force is not significant.

40|$|Temporal {{analyses}} of the prompt gamma-ray and X-ray light curves of gamma-ray <b>bursts</b> reveal a <b>tendency</b> for the <b>burst</b> pulse time scales to increase with decreasing energy. For an ensemble of BATSE bursts, Fenimore et al. (1995) show that the energy dependence of burst peak durations can be represented by ∆t ∝ E −γ with γ ≃ 0. 4 – 0. 45. This power-law dependence {{has led to the}} suggestion that this effect is due to radiative processes, most notably synchrotron cooling of the non-thermal particles which produce the radiation.

40|$|We {{analyze the}} Swift/BAT sample of short gamma-ray bursts, using an {{objective}} Bayesian Block procedure to extract temporal descriptors of the bursts' initial pulse complexes (IPCs). The sample comprises 12 and 41 bursts {{with and without}} extended emission (EE) components, respectively. IPCs of non-EE bursts are dominated by single pulse structures, while EE bursts tend to have two or more pulse structures. The medians of characteristic timescales - durations, pulse structure widths, and peak intervals - for EE bursts are factors of ~ 2 - 3 longer than for non-EE bursts. A trend previously reported by Hakkila and colleagues unifying long and short bursts - the anti-correlation of pulse intensity and width - continues in the two short burst groups, with non-EE bursts extending to more intense, narrower pulses. In addition we find that preceding and succeeding pulse intensities are anti-correlated with pulse interval. We also examine the short burst X-ray afterglows as observed by the Swift/XRT. The median flux of the initial XRT detections for EE bursts (~ 6 x 10 ^- 10 erg cm^- 2 s^- 1) is ~> 20 x brighter than for non-EE bursts, and the median X-ray afterglow duration for EE bursts (~ 60, 000 s) is ~ 30 x longer than for non-EE <b>bursts.</b> The <b>tendency</b> for EE <b>bursts</b> toward longer prompt-emission timescales and higher initial X-ray afterglow fluxes implies larger energy injections powering the afterglows. The longer-lasting X-ray afterglows of EE bursts may suggest that a significant fraction explode into more dense environments than non-EE bursts, or that the sometimes-dominant EE component efficiently powers the afterglow. Combined, these results favor different progenitors for EE and non-EE short bursts. Comment: 30 pages, 11 figures, 3 tables; accepted to The Astrophysical Journa...|$|R
40|$|A {{fundamental}} principle of physiology is that cells are small {{in order to}} minimize diffusion distances for O 2 and intracellular metabolites. In skeletal muscle, it has long been recognized that aerobic fibers that are used for steady state locomotion tend to be smaller than anaerobic fibers that are used for <b>burst</b> movements. This <b>tendency</b> reflects the interaction between diffusion distances and aerobic ATP turnover rates, since maximal intracellular diffusion distances are ultimately limited by fiber size. The effect of diffusion distance on O 2 flux in muscle {{has been the subject of}} quantitative analyses for a century, but the influence of ATP diffusion from mitochondria to cellular ATPases on aerobic metabolism has received much less attention. The application of reaction–diffusion mathematical models to experimental measurements of aerobic metabolic processes has revealed that the extreme diffusion distances between mitochondria found in some muscle fibers do not necessarily limit the rates of aerobic processes per se, as long as the metabolic process is sufficiently slow. However, skeletal muscle fibers from a variety of animals appear to have intracellular diffusion distances and/or fiber sizes that put them on the brink of diffusion limitation. Thus, intracellular metabolite diffusion likely influences the evolution of muscle design and places limits on muscle function...|$|R

40|$|AbstractDuring {{the years}} 2000 – 2011 the radio {{instruments}} onboard Cassini, Wind and STEREO spacecraft have recorded {{a large amount}} of the Jovian decametric radio emission (DAM). In this paper we report on the analysis of the new type of Jovian periodic radio bursts recently revealed in the decametric frequency range. These bursts, which are non-Io component of DAM, are characterized by a strong periodic reoccurrence over several Jovian days with a period ≈ 1. 5 % longer than the rotation rate of the planet's magnetosphere (System III). The bursts are typically observed between 4 and 12 MHz and their occurrence probability {{has been found to be}} significantly higher in the sector of Jovian Central Meridian Longitude between 300 ° and 60 ° (via 360 °). The stereoscopic multispacecraft observations have shown that the radio sources of the periodic bursts radiate in a non-axisymmetric hollow cone-like pattern and sub-corotate with Jupiter remaining active during several planet's rotations. The occurrence of the periodic non-Io DAM bursts is strongly correlated with pulses of the solar wind ram pressure at Jupiter.

40|$|NOTE: Text or symbols not renderable {{in plain}} ASCII are {{indicated}} by [ [...] . ]. Abstract is included in. pdf document. Evaporation waves in superheated liquids are studied using a rapid-depressurization facility {{consisting of a}} vertical glass test cell situated beneath a large, low-pressure reservoir. The objective {{of this study is}} to learn more about the physical mechanisms of explosive boiling (of which an evaporation wave is a specific example), as well as properties of the flow it produces. The test cell is initially sealed from the reservoir by a foil diaphragm, and is partially filled with a volatile liquid (Refrigerant 12 or 114). An experiment is initiated by rupturing the diaphragm via a pneumatically driven cutter. The instrumentation consists of fast-response pressure measurements, high-speed motion pictures, and spark-illuminated still photographs. The liquid temperature is typically 20 °C; the liquid superheat is controlled by setting the reservoir pressure to values between vacuum and 1 atm. The pressures subsequent to depressurization are very much less than the critical pressure, and the initial temperatures are sufficiently low that, although the test liquid is highly superheated, the superheat limit is not approached. Evaporation waves in which bubble nucleation within the liquid column is suppressed entirely are considered almost exclusively. When the diaphragm is ruptured, the liquid pressure drops to virtually the reservoir value within a few milliseconds. Provided that the liquid superheat so obtained is sufficiently high, the free surface then erupts in a process known as explosive boiling, which is characterized by violent, fine-scale fragmentation of the superheated liquid and extremely rapid evaporation. The explosive boiling process proceeds as a "wavefront" into the liquid column, producing a highspeed, two-phase flow that travels upward into the low-pressure reservoir, emptying the test cell in a few hundred milliseconds. The speed of the wavefront varies between 0. 2 and 0. 6 m/s, depending on run conditions; the corresponding two-phase flow varies between about 5 and 35 m/s. In the highest superheat case for the more volatile liquid (Refrigerant 12), explosive boiling usually initiates by the rapid formation of nucleation sites at random spots on the liquid free surface and at the glass/free-surface contact line. Boiling spreads to the remaining surface within 160 [ [...] . ]. In the highest superheat case for the less volatile liquid (Refrigerant 114), nucleation begins only at the glass/free-surface contact line. Boiling then spreads radially inward toward the center. In the lower superheated cases for both liquids, nucleation begins at one or more sites on the glass/free-surface contact line, and propagates across the free surface. At the higher superheats, explosive boiling initiates within a few milliseconds from diaphragm burst, the same time scale as that of liquid depressurization. No distinction is made between the onset of nucleation and that of explosive boiling. However, if the reservoir pressure is raised above a certain approximate value, the onset of explosive boiling is delayed. During the delay period, relatively slow bubbling (initiated at one or more nucleation sites at the glass/free-surface contact line) occurs, and a cluster of bubbles forms in the vicinity of the initial site. The bubble cluster then "explodes," marking the transition to explosive boiling. The delay period increases significantly as the reservoir pressure is raised slightly further. Reservoir pressures corresponding to a delay period of order 100 ms define an approximate self-start threshold pressure, above which the transition to explosive boiling does not occur. Within about 10 ms of initiation, the wave reaches a quasi-steady condition in which the average wave speed, two-phase flow speed, and base and exit pressures are constant. However, the instantaneous propagation rate and the mechanisms that generate the mean flow are observed to be highly nonsteady. The wavefront appears to propagate by heterogeneous bubble nucleation at its leading edge, and any given region of the wavefront tends to propagate in surges associated with new nucleation and/or very fine-scale surface perturbations. Measurements of the instantaneous position of the upstream tip of the wavefront indicate that local velocity fluctuations are the same order as the mean velocity. The leading-edge bubble lifetimes and diameters are statistically distributed; mean values are of order 1 ms and 1 mm, respectively. The leading-edge bubbles are fragmented in violent "bursts" of aerosol. <b>Bursts</b> have a <b>tendency</b> to sweep over the leading-edge bubble layer in a wavelike manner: They are "large-scale structures" associated with the fragmentation of many bubbles. Fragmentation, rapid evaporation, flow acceleration, and pressure drop occur primarily within about 1 cm of the leading edge. Downstream of this region, the average speed and appearance of the flow are virtually constant. This developed flow is a highly nonuniform, two-phase spray containing streaklike structures. Its liquid phase is composed of drops (with a maximum diameter of about 100 [ [...] . ]), as well as clusters and chains of bubbles (with a diameter of a few hundred microns). A thin liquid layer begins climbing the wall upon wave initiation. Its speed is a few m/s-significantly slower than that of the two-phase flow through the center. Exit pressure measurements indicate that the flow chokes for sufficiently low reservoir pressure; at higher reservoir pressures the flow is unchoked. The self-start threshold is not a propagation threshold, as waves are observed to propagate at somewhat lower superheats if started artificially. This is accomplished in Refrigerant 114 by "jump-starting" the wave, using the more volatile Refrigerant 12. For sufficiently high reservoir pressures, an "absolute" threshold is reached at which the quasi-steady rapid evaporation processes break down. Possible mechanisms for explosive boiling are discussed in light of the present results. While neither of the two previous schools of thought (interfacial instability hypotheses and the secondary nucleation hypothesis) are alone adequate to explain the observed behavior, there is evidence that both may play a role. It is here proposed that the bursting phenomenon and bubble nucleation at the wavefront leading edge are mutually interactive processes-bursting occurring as the violent breakup of interstitial bubble liquid, and nucleation (and fine-scale perturbations) being caused by burst-generated aerosol striking the leading-edge surface. It is not understood what role interfacial instability may play in the bursting process. An evaporation wave is analogous to a premixed flame in that both are classified as "weak deflagration" waves in gasdynamic theory. It is shown that using several approximations that are valid for the type of evaporation waves studied, the conservation equations (jump conditions) can be reduced to a single, simple expression in terms of readily measured and inferred properties. ...|$|R
