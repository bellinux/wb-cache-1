5|$|As the 1880 presidential {{elections}} approached, many Democrats remained convinced Tilden had <b>been</b> <b>robbed</b> {{of the presidency}} in 1876. In the House, Tilden supporter Clarkson Nott Potter of New York sought {{an investigation into the}} 1876 election in Florida and Louisiana, hoping that evidence of Republican malfeasance would harm that party's candidate in 1880. The Democratic caucus, including Randall, unanimously endorsed the idea, and the committee convened in May 1878. Some in the caucus wished to investigate the entire election, but Randall and the more moderate members worked to limit the committee's reach to the two disputed states.|$|E
5|$|PahWongso {{continued}} {{to raise money}} for the Red Cross by selling fried peanuts. He also {{continued to}} operate his school in Blandongan, as well as the employment office, which trained young men and women for positions such as maids, gardeners, and bellhops, then placed them with employers. Several of PahWongso's students came from islands other than Java. De Nieuwsgier gave the story of one young man, from Bengkulu, who had come to Java to study, <b>been</b> <b>robbed</b> of all his possessions while in Jakarta, then been helped by PahWongso to find work.|$|E
60|$|On these grounds I do {{not blame}} the {{arrangement}} {{this day in}} question, as a preference given to the debt of individuals over the Company's debt. In my eye {{it is no more}} than the preference of a fiction over a chimera; but I blame the preference given to those fictitious private debts over the standing defence and the standing government. It is there the public <b>is</b> <b>robbed.</b> It <b>is</b> <b>robbed</b> in its army; it <b>is</b> <b>robbed</b> in its civil administration; it <b>is</b> <b>robbed</b> in its credit; it <b>is</b> <b>robbed</b> in its investment, which forms the commercial connection between that country and Europe. There is the robbery.|$|R

5|$|The {{following}} day, Visscher surrendered {{control of}} the military to Glan. Not long afterwards, news reached him that Yonko had not joined the insurgents but had <b>been</b> <b>robbed,</b> spending the night at his son's grave in Peterongan in depression. This revitalised Visscher, who retook command of the military on 4 May and ordered everyone to return to their homes. Several days afterwards, four regents– Suradiningrat from Tuban, Martapura from Grobogan, Suradimenggala from Kaliwungu, and Awangga from Kendal– arrived at Semarang, reporting that the 6,000 promised troops were on their way.|$|E
5|$|A large mound on {{the south}} side of the plaza was once the Temple of Jakawitz, a deity of the {{mountains}} and the patron of the Ajaw K'iche' lineage. Like the other structures of Q'umarkaj, all the stone facing has <b>been</b> <b>robbed,</b> leaving only a rubble and mud core. This structure was part of a complex that consisted of a patio enclosed by the temple on the northern side, a palace {{on the south}}ern side and a long building on the east. The Jakawitz complex has not been investigated archaeologically. Drawings by Rivera y Maestre suggest that the temple was a narrow building with four or five terraces.|$|E
5|$|She's Done it Again is a 1910 American silent short comedy {{written by}} Lloyd Lonergan and {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company in New Rochelle, New York. A thief named Sikes decides to rob a society woman who falsely claimed to have <b>been</b> <b>robbed</b> when she in fact pawned her jewelry. A gentleman thief strikes and robs her, but no one believes her. The thief is caught only by a clever detective. The film was the third release of the Thanhouser company and featured the leading players, Anna Rosemond and Frank H. Crane. The film was met with positive reviews, but is presumed to be lost.|$|E

5|$|The {{remains of}} Ahmose's pyramid in Abydos were {{discovered}} in 1899 and identified as his in 1902. Most of its outer casing stones had <b>been</b> <b>robbed</b> for use in other building projects over the years, and the mound of rubble upon which it was built has collapsed. However, two rows of intact casing stones were found by Arthur Mace, who estimated its steep slope as about 60 degrees, {{based on the evidence}} of the limestone casing (compare to the less acute 51 degrees of the Great Pyramid of Giza). Adjacent to the main pyramid temple and to its east, Harvey has identified two temples constructed by Ahmose's queen, Ahmose-Nefertary. One of these structures also bears bricks stamped with the name of Chief Treasurer Neferperet, the official responsible for re-opening the stone quarries at el-Ma'asara (Tura) in Ahmose's year 22. A third, larger temple (Temple C) is similar to the pyramid temple in form and scale, but its stamped bricks and details of decoration reinforce that it was a cult place for Ahmose-Nefertary.|$|E
5|$|Violet {{explains}} to Corky that Caesar and Johnnie hate each other, and that Gino and Johnnie {{will be coming}} {{to pick up the}} money from Caesar. The plan is as follows: When Caesar has finished counting the money, Violet will get him a drink to relax him before he showers. Corky will be next-door, waiting until she hears Caesar turn on the shower. When he does, Violet will drop the bottle of Scotch that is for Gino and tell Caesar that she is going to buy more. As she leaves the apartment, she will let Corky in, who will steal the money from a briefcase and leave. Violet will then return with the Scotch and tell Caesar that she just saw Johnnie leaving, but that Gino was not with him. Suspicious, Caesar will check the briefcase, find the money gone, and assume Johnnie has taken it. Corky and Violet think Caesar will be forced to skip town because Gino will assume he has <b>been</b> <b>robbed</b> by Caesar, not his son.|$|E
5|$|All Saints' {{originally}} {{consisted of}} a nave and chancel, to which a sanctuary was added in the first building phase. The church was extended on three occasions between the 10th and 14th centuries– a period of population growth– to include an aisled nave, a western tower and a northern chapel; its windows featured stained glass. The church was abandoned in the 15th century, presumably because the parish could no longer support two churches. It was demolished, and virtually all of its masonry removed, {{some of which may}} have been used in improvements to the church of St Nicholas. The settlement of Shuart remained as an area of local administration into the 17th century, but it is now regarded as a deserted medieval village. There were no visible remains of All Saints' Church by 1723, although land there remained as glebe belonging to the parish of St Nicholas. The site of All Saints' Church was excavated by archaeologists between 1978 and 1979. The main structure had <b>been</b> <b>robbed</b> of its materials leaving only the foundations, from which the archaeologists were able to interpret the history of the building's construction and its form. Among the foundations were discovered numerous stone carvings, floor tiles, remnants of stained glass, and several disturbed graves.|$|E

25|$|The most {{valuable}} goods that were buried with the tomb's occupant had long <b>been</b> <b>robbed</b> when archeologists excavated the tomb in 1977.

25|$|This mound {{contained}} a rectangular wooden chamber (3.5 by 5.5 m). Its main occupant {{was a man}} aged around 50. There were also remains of two women. It had <b>been</b> <b>robbed</b> in antiquity, but modern archeological finds nevertheless included weapons, gold and bronze attachments for garments, and some amber plaques that probably once adorned a kline (couch) imported from the Mediterranean. Twenty further burials were later placed in and on the same mound.|$|E
25|$|Immediately {{south of}} the wall, a large ditch was dug, with {{adjoining}} parallel mounds, one on either side.

In many places – for example Limestone Corner – the Vallum is better preserved than the wall, which has <b>been</b> <b>robbed</b> of much of its stone.|$|E

Much of the fabric of the palace complex would have <b>been</b> <b>robbed</b> piecemeal for building projects within the village and wider estate such as Clipstone Hall (founded prior to 1609). Clipstone passed into the ownership of William Bentinck, 2nd Duke of Portland in 1734 on his marriage to Lady Margaret Cavendish-Harley.|$|E
