5|$|Janet Burnett Grossman {{writes that}} girls {{appear to be}} commemorated about as {{frequently}} as <b>boys</b> <b>on</b> surviving Attic gravestones, although previous scholars suggested that boys were commemorated up to twice as often. If they survived, Athenian children were named in a ceremony (the dekate) ten days after birth. Other Athenian ceremonies celebrating childbirth (at five, seven, and forty days after birth) were also observed. Later rites of passage were apparently more common and elaborate for boys than for girls.|$|E

5|$|Carre's is a state-run {{selective}} grammar school. It {{converted to}} an Academy and reopened on 1 August 2011; it {{is governed by}} Carre's Grammar School Academy Trust and converted without sponsorship. As of 2015, the student body {{is made up of}} 815 pupils aged 11–18. The school admits <b>boys</b> <b>on</b> a selective basis for years 7–11 and has a co-educational Sixth Form; there are 60 girls on roll as of 2015. The majority of pupils come from White British backgrounds and very few pupils speak English as an additional language. The number of pupils supported through allowances, including those eligible for free school meals (2.3%), is below average, as is the number of students with learning disabilities. Pupils are allocated into houses based on their forms. The first house system at Carre's consisted of four sets: scarlet, maroon, green and blue. They became houses in 1933 as Carre, Bristol, Lafford and Welby, named respectively after its founder, the Earls of Bristol, an old name for Sleaford, and Richard Welby, who owned the Gedney lands purchased by Carre.|$|E

5|$|Eldred did {{not have}} a troop board of review, a review by the adult troop leaders to ensure eligibility. Instead, Eldred had a {{thorough}} National Board of Review consisting of West, Baden-Powell, Ernest Thompson Seton, Daniel Carter Beard, Arthur R. Forbush, and Wilbert E. Longfellow, who wrote in the Handbook for <b>Boys</b> <b>on</b> life-saving and swimming. At the time there had still not been a council-level system for Eagle Scouts boards of review. Largely due to delays caused by Baden-Powell's visit, the National Court of Honor did not convene until March 29, 1912. A press announcement was released on or about April 10, 1912, leading to a century of confusion wherein it was believed Eldred's Board of Review had been held in April. West informed Eldred of his Eagle award in a letter dated August 21, 1912. Another reason for the delays was that the Boy Scouts of America felt no one would ever earn the Eagle Scout award and at the time of Eldred's Board of Review, the Eagle Scout medal had not yet been designed. This letter also informed Eldred of the delay in the medal, caused {{by the fact that the}} design of the Eagle Scout medal had not been finalized. Eldred was presented Eagle Scout on Labor Day, September 2, 1912, becoming the first to earn Scouting's highest rank, just two years after the founding of the BSA itself.|$|E
