5|$|Levin {{began to}} have {{difficulty}} with his <b>balance</b> <b>as</b> early as 1988, although Alzheimer's disease was not diagnosed until the early 1990s. From September 1995 his Times column appeared once weekly instead of twice, and in January 1997 the editor, Peter Stothard, concluded, despite a great admiration for Levin, that the weekly column should cease. Levin retired, though he continued to write for the paper occasionally over the next year.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the writing, {{and also}} the filming stages of the series, the writers were advised by ex-MI5 {{officers}} who gave insight into how the characters operate and how their personal lives {{would be affected by}} it. Among the advisors were Nick Day, who worked in counter-terrorism in the Security Services, Viktor Abramkin, a UK-based former KGB officer, and Mike Baker, an ex-CIA agent. When including terrorists, the BBC often has the responsibility to portray people with as much <b>balance</b> <b>as</b> possible for both sides. The first series finale was heavily researched, as the episode was based on real life instances in which terrorists agreed to work with the authorities in Colombia. Meanwhile, a scene in which Tom and Patrick strip naked to ensure they are not bugged came from the producers' sources. The sources also advised the producers how to tail targets without being spotted.|$|E
5|$|Malaysia {{established}} {{diplomatic ties}} with North Vietnam on 31 March 1973 at the ambassadorial level after the Paris Peace Accords were signed that year. An {{agreement between the}} ambassadors of Malaysia and Vietnam was reached in 1975. The following year, Malaysia first opened its embassy in Hanoi, while Vietnam also opened its embassy in Kuala Lumpur on 29 May 1976. In {{the mid to late}} 1970s, bilateral ties were strained as Malaysia pressured Vietnam to embrace the ZOPFAN concept, which the latter interpreted as a version of the anti-communist containment policy. During a bilateral summit in August 1977, Malaysia's Prime Minister Hussein Onn made promises to provide economic and technical assistance to rebuild Vietnam's war-torn economy. When Vietnam invaded Cambodia in 1979, many Vietnamese sought refuge in Malaysia from that time onwards and into the 1980s, and caused economic and national security problems to Malaysia especially to its racial <b>balance</b> <b>as</b> most the Vietnamese refugees resemble the Chinese people. Bilateral ties normalised from 1988 onwards, when Vietnam announced plans to withdraw from Cambodia. In the early 1990s, government leaders of both countries held several diplomatic visits and summits, which produced many agreements that emphasised economic co-operation and development. Strengthening ties also saw the opening of a consulate office in Ho Chi Minh City in January 1991. Vietnam expressed its interest in joining ASEAN with Malaysia's support in 1994 as the countries continued to foster close economic ties. Vietnam joined ASEAN in 1995; its entry was warmly welcomed by Malaysia.|$|E

5|$|The NRRF {{arrived in}} Archangel on 5 June 1919 aboard the SS Porto and SS Stephen and almost {{immediately}} moved up the Dvina River to a camp at Osinova. There they began training for an offensive up the rail and river systems of the Dvina. This offensive was designed to push the Bolshevik forces of the Red Army back while the Allies withdrew without interference. A secondary aim was to leave the White Russian forces in a better military position, in the optimistic hope they could subsequently hold their own. Meanwhile, {{with the arrival of}} the NRRF, the survivors of the earlier NREF were subsequently evacuated. Activity during this period also included small-scale patrol and ambush operations around Troitska to the south in an attempt to keep the Bolsheviks off <b>balance,</b> <b>as</b> well as to provide the White Russian forces with the motivation to fight. Both sides had a small air arm, and the British established a makeshift airfield at Bakaritsa, near Archangel. Later in the campaign Sopwiths from France were used from a strip at Obozerskaya. The allies soon established air-superiority, shooting down a number of Bolshevik aircraft. At least one Australian—Ira Jones—is known to have served with the British Royal Air Force in North Russia.|$|E

25|$|Walrasi{{an auction}} or Walrasian tâtonnement is an auction {{in which the}} {{auctioneer}} takes bids from both buyers and sellers in a market of multiple goods. The auctioneer progressively either raises or drops the current proposed price depending on the bids of both buyers and sellers, the auction concluding when supply and demand exactly <b>balance.</b> <b>As</b> a high price tends to dampen demand while a low price tends to increase demand, in theory there is a particular price {{somewhere in the middle}} where supply and demand will match.|$|E
25|$|Greater {{changes in}} {{attitude}} toward the river were manifest in the Bow River Water Quality Council's reports over time. By 1994, the reports {{emphasized the importance of}} the Bow's ecological <b>balance</b> <b>as</b> a whole for maintaining its water quality and quantity. In the mid-1990s, the upper Bow River began being treated explicitly biocentrically. This was part of the larger pursuit of treating Banff National Park's ecosystems as something intrinsically valuable: maintaining these ecosystems was now prioritized over human enjoyment of the parks.|$|E

25|$|Who {{has held}} the waters in hand, {{measured}} the heavens, comprehended the earth, and weighed mountains in the balance? Who has counseled or instructed God? Nations are like a drop in a bucket, like dust in the <b>balance,</b> <b>as</b> nothing before God. Can one compare God to anything, to an idol that a woodworker carved? God sits above the earth, and its inhabitants are like grasshoppers. God brings princes to nothing, makes the judges of the earth like nothing; scarcely are they planted, but God blows upon them, and they wither and blow away.|$|E
25|$|Metabolic {{adaptation}} in tumours {{balances the}} cells' need for energy with equally important need for macromolecular building blocks and tighter control of redox <b>balance.</b> <b>As</b> a result, production of NADPH is greatly enhanced, which {{functions as a}} cofactor to provide reducing power in many enzymatic reactions for macromolecular biosynthesis {{and at the same}} time rescuing the cells from excessive ROS produced during rapid proliferation. Cells counterbalance the detrimental effects of ROS by producing antioxidant molecules, such as reduced glutathione (GSH) and thioredoxin (TRX), which rely on the reducing power of NADPH to maintain their activities.|$|E

Leicester was reoccupied by Fairfax on the 18th, and on the 20th, Leven's army, moving slowly southward, reached Mansfield. This move was undertaken largely for political reasons, i.e. to restore the Presbyterian <b>balance,</b> <b>as</b> against the victorious New Model. Fairfax's army was intended by its founders to be a specifically English army, and Cromwell for one, would have employed it against the Scots, almost as readily as against malignants.|$|E
