To avoid this, these sweeps include a timing circuit that generates {{free-running}} triggers so a trace is always visible. Once triggers arrive, the timer stops providing pseudo-triggers.

25|$|Many {{statements}} {{have been}} made concerning the relationship between transsaccadic memory and visual short-term memory. Researchers have noted several similar characteristics between the two systems, leading several to believe that transsaccadic memory is in fact visual short-term memory or a part of visual short-term memory. Transsaccadic memory has a limited capacity of three to four items, a slow decay rate and maskable characteristics. Basically, transsaccadic memory can hold three to four items for each saccade, and the retention of items decays or disappears from consciousness slowly after {{the presentation of the}} stimulus. However, once a mask stimulus, such as a <b>blank</b> <b>screen,</b> is presented immediately after the stimulus, the items retained prior to the mask can be replaced and/or eliminated faster by the mask. All of these factors are typical characteristics of visual short-term memory. The content stored in transsaccadic memory are less-image like, more abstract and are sparse representations of the objects, which is found to be similar to the type of representations in visual short-term memory. Transsaccadic memory is different from visual short-term memory in that it takes into account the changes of the target's location due to the eye moving to new saccades. The information retained between saccades do not take into account positional information very well. Nevertheless, relational and identity information are well retained. Prime and colleagues (2006) hypothesize, transsaccadic memory utilizes egocentric mechanisms, like selective attention, to reduce the visual search of the target and allow for spatial information between saccades to be retained and updated by incorporation of information across saccades.|$|E

50|$|This {{method was}} used in the first, 1995, experiment. A change is made in an image {{at the same time as}} the image is moved in an {{unpredictable}} direction, forcing a saccade.

However, it is unclear if small additions to an image will predict if people will be unable to notice larger changes in an image to the same position to their eye.|$|R

40|$|The study {{investigated}} brain responses to emotional and neutral adjectives within contexts of varying emotional valence. Participants {{were randomly assigned}} to 3 context groups where they viewed random sequences of emotional and neutral adjectives intermixed with: emotional pictures (emotional context), neutral pictures (neutral context) and <b>blank</b> <b>screens</b> (zero context). Within the emotional context group the P 3 potential was more pronounced in response to positive than either negative or neutral adjectives, and positive picture context impacted positive and negative adjectives differently. In the neutral context group the P 2 and P 3 potentials were greater in response to the positive adjectives as compared to the neutral ones. There was also a greater negativity of the N 400 potential in response to the neutral adjectives. Within the zero context group only the N 400 effect was visible. The seeming preference for positive words can be explained in terms of the specific positivity offset phenomenon...|$|R
