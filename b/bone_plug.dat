40|$|Abstract A {{prospective}} randomised {{study was}} carried out to evaluate the blood loss in 30 total knee arthropasty patients, who were divided randomly into two equal groups; one having new technique <b>bone</b> <b>plug</b> and bone wax, while the other used a <b>bone</b> <b>plug</b> only. The surgery {{was carried out}} by a single surgeon at one institution using the uniform approach and standard operation. The mean drainage of blood was lower in the <b>bone</b> <b>plug</b> and bone wax group. This differ-ence was statistically significant (p= 0. 001). There was a highly significant reduction in blood drainage in the <b>bone</b> <b>plug</b> and bone wax group when compared to the <b>bone</b> <b>plug</b> only group. This finding allows for the order of less blood before an operation, reduces the risks of transfusion and gives financial saving. This new technique of surgery may also be useful for patients in whom blood products are not acceptable. Chiang Mai Medical Journal 2007; 46 (4) : 147 - 152. Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is a com-mon orthopedic surgery that can result in considerable blood loss. (1, 2) Many techniques and procedures have been used to minimize intra-operative bleeding and blood transfusion, including application of a tourniquet,(3) mini-mally-invasive surgery,(4) diathermy coagula-tion, sealing of the intramedullary femoral canal,(5) positioning of the knee(6) and use of antifibrinolytic agents. (7) Although computer navigation has been developed to allow accurate intra-operative positioning of the components, without breach-ing the intra-medullary cavities(8) but providing an opportunity for reducing blood loss, it can prolong the operating time, as commonly occurs in computer-assisted surgery, and this may negate the benefit This study was carried out as a prospec-tive, randomized study to evaluate the new technique of <b>bone</b> <b>plug</b> and bone wax in com-parison to the standard conventional surgical technique, in terms of reducing blood loss during TKA.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Autologous {{osteochondral}} transplantation is {{a popular}} treatment for articular cartilage lesions in the knee joint. The donor defect is commonly left empty and remains a matter of concern. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In 20 knees of 10 goats, we created a standardised donor defect in the knee. In the control group the defects were left empty, whereas in two other groups a <b>bone</b> <b>plug</b> from the proximal tibia was press-fitted into the defect {{with or without a}} covering periosteal layer. RESULTS: Histological evaluation after 8 and 16 weeks showed that relatively rapid osteoclastic resorption of the <b>bone</b> <b>plug</b> occurred. Defects were mainly filled with fibrous tissue, and collapse of the adjacent bone and cartilage was visible, especially when the defects were left empty. Occasionally, some consolidation of the graft to the host bone could be detected, and in some samples periosteal chondrogenesis was present. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that transplantation of a tibial <b>bone</b> <b>plug</b> with covering periosteum to the donor defect in a cartilage transplantation procedure does not have any additional value in an attempt to minimise the damage at the donor site. The observed resorption of the <b>bone</b> <b>plug</b> and the collapse of the adjacent joint margin remain a matter of concern with this technique...|$|E
40|$|Background: Ligament {{reconstruction}} is {{a common}} procedure in orthopedic surgery. Although several popular techniques are currently in use, new methods are proposed for secure fixation of the tendon graft into the bone tunnel. Purposes: We sought to introduce our new technique of Bashti <b>bone</b> <b>plug</b> for fixation of soft tissue graft in anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction and to compare its biomechanical features with conventional absorbable interference screw technique in a bovine model. Methods: Twenty pairs of bovine knees were harvested after death. Soft tissue was removed and the Achilles tendon was harvested {{to be used as}} an ACL graft. It was secured into the bone tunnel on the tibial side via two different methods: Bashti <b>Bone</b> <b>Plug</b> technique and conventional screw method. Biomechanical strength was measured using 200 N and 300 N cyclic loading on the graft. Pull out strength was also tested until the graft fails. Results: No graft failure was observed after 200 N and 300 N cyclic loading in either fixation methods. When testing for pull out failure, 21 tendons (53 %) were torn and 19 tendons (48 %) slipped out. No fixation failure occurred, which did not reveal {{a significant difference between the}} <b>bone</b> <b>plug</b> or interference screw group (P= 0. 11). The mean pull out force until failure of the graft was 496 ± 66 N in the screw group and 503 ± 67 N in the <b>bone</b> <b>plug</b> group (P= 0. 76). Conclusions: Our suggested fixation technique of Bashti <b>bone</b> <b>plug</b> is a native, cheap, and feasible method that provides comparable biomechanical strength with interference screw when soft tissue fixation was attempted in bovine model...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose was}} to {{evaluate}} the load to failure of 2 coracoid fixation techniques after transfer of the coracoid to the anterior glenoid neck. Methods: Ten cadavers (mean age, 87 years; range, 74 to 96 years) underwent the Bristow conjoined tendon tenodesis technique as described by Boileau et al. (bioabsorbable interference screw fixation of a coracoid <b>bone</b> <b>plug)</b> in 1 shoulder and the Latarjet-Patte coracoid transfer popularized by Walch (fixation with 2 screws through a larger piece of the coracoid) in the opposite shoulder. The force on the conjoined tendon required to pull the coracoid off of the anterior glenoid was recorded, along with the mode of construct failure. Results: The median ultimate failure load was 110 N (range, 35 to 170 N) in the interference screw group and 202 N (range, 95 to 300 N) in the bicortical screw group (P. 002). The mode of failure of the interference screw technique was complete avulsion of the <b>bone</b> <b>plug</b> from the socket in 6 cases (60 %) and fracture of the <b>bone</b> <b>plug</b> in 4 (40 %). The mode of failure of the bone block technique was a vertical fracture through both screw holes in 7 cases (70 %), a horizontal fracture through the distal screw hole in 2 (20 %), and an intratendinous rupture of the conjoined tendon in 1 (10 %). Conclusions: Fixation of a coracoid bone block to the anterior glenoid neck with 2 bicortical metal screws is stronger than fixation of a coracoid <b>bone</b> <b>plug</b> with an absorbable interference screw. Clinical Relevance: These data may influence surgeons' decisions regarding coracoid fixation as well as postoperative rehabilitation after coracoid transfer...|$|E

40|$|Reconstruction of the {{posterior}} cruciate ligament (PCL) by a tibial press-fit fixation of the patellar tendon with an accessory <b>bone</b> <b>plug</b> is a promising approach because no foreign materials are required. Until today, there is no data about the biomechanical properties of such press-fit fixations. The {{aim of this study}} was to compare the biomechanical qualities of a <b>bone</b> <b>plug</b> tibial inlay technique with the commonly applied interference screw of patellar tendon PCL grafts. Twenty patellar tendons including a bone block were harvested from ten human cadavers. The grafts were implanted into twenty legs of adult German country pigs. In group P, the grafts were attached in a press-fit technique with accessory <b>bone</b> <b>plug.</b> In group S, the grafts were fixed with an interference screw. Each group consisted of 10 specimens. The constructs were biomechanically analyzed in cyclic loading between 60 and 250 N for 500 cycles recording elongation. Finally, ultimate failure load and failure mode were analyzed. Ultimate failure load was 598. 6 ± 36. 3 N in group P and 653. 7 ± 39. 8 N in group S (not significant, P> 0. 05). Elongation during cyclic loading between the 1 st and the 20 th cycle was 3. 4 ± 0. 9 mm for group P and 3. 1 ± 1 mm for group S. Between the 20 th and the 500 th cycle, elongation was 4. 2 ± 2. 3 mm in group P and 2. 5 ± 0. 9 mm in group S (not significant, P> 0. 05). This is the first study investigating the biomechanical properties of tibial press-fit fixation of the patellar tendon with accessory <b>bone</b> <b>plug</b> in {{posterior cruciate ligament}} reconstruction. The implant-free tibial inlay technique shows equal biomechanical characteristics compared to an interference screw fixation.

40|$|Background: The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare blood loss, declines in {{hemoglobin}} (HgB) and hematocrit (HcT) levels, and required homologous transfusions for patients who either had the femoral intramedullary defect left open or filled with an autologous <b>bone</b> <b>plug</b> during total knee arthroplasty (TKA).

Materials and Methods: A retrospective chart review was performed on 55 patients diagnosed with osteoarthritis (OA) who had undergone unilateral TKA. Twenty six patients had the femoral defect filled with an autologous <b>bone</b> <b>plug</b> and 29 did not. Lateral releases and patella replacements were not performed. Drained blood was reinfused when appropriate. Results: Mean blood loss and mean blood reinfused were similar for the plugged (loss: 960. 8 ± 417. 3 ml; reinfused: 466. 7 ± 435. 9 mL) and unplugged groups (loss: 1065. 9 ± 633. 5 ml, P = 0. 38; reinfused: 528. 4 ± 464. 8 ml, P = 0. 61). Preoperative HgB (14. 3 ± 1. 4 g/dL, P = 0. 93) and HcT levels (42. 2 ± 4. 6 %, P = 0. 85) were similar across plug conditions.

The defects were filled with an sBDAB block soaked in blood in the test group and with blood clot in the CSD control group. The skulls were collected at 0 h (n= 2) and 30, 90 and 180 days (n= 6 /group and period) postoperatively. The volume density and total volume of newly formed bone, sBDAB, blood vessels and connective tissue, vertical thickness of removed <b>bone</b> <b>plug,</b> sBDAB block and graft area were evaluated. The vertical thickness of the adapted sBDAB block was 3. 8 times higher than that of the removed <b>bone</b> <b>plug</b> and did not show significant difference between periods, filling in average 29. 8 % of the total graft region. The sBDAB block exhibited complete osseointegration with the borders of the defect at 90 days. At 90 and 180 days, the vertical thickness of the graft was 279 % in the average, and the total volume of bone augmentation was, respectively, 78. 8 % and 148. 5 % higher compared with the removed <b>bone</b> <b>plug.</b> The defects of the CDS control group showed limited osteogenesis and filling by connective tissue plus tegument. The sBDAB block can be used to promote repair of CSDs and bone augmentation in the craniomaxillofacial region, due to its good osteoconductive and slow resorptive properties.

40|$|The Rochester bone {{trephine}} is {{a useful}} instrument for performing small joint arthrodesis in the foot. The tech-nique involves harvesting a dowel graft from the iliac crest and then inserting the graft into a recipient bed across the small joints in the foot. Minimal surgical trauma and patient discomfort result from this technique. Three cases are presented to illustrate the usefulness and diversity of this system. The Rochester bone trephine provides an easy means of performing dowel-type, small-joint arthrodesis in the foot (Fig. 1). Two trephines are used. One tre-phine has an inside diameter of 7. 5 mm and is used to harvest bone graft from the anterior iliac crest. The second trephine has an outside diameter of 7. 5 mm and is used to prepare the recipient bed across the smaller joints of the foot for arthrodesis. The donor dowel graft is the same diameter as the recipient core site so that inherent stability is provided when the trephine bone graft is inserted into the recipient area. After locating the joint and plane of the small joint, the sleeve of the small bone trephine is centered over the joint. The cutting trephine is then placed down the sleeve to excise the joint to be arthrodesed. The de-generated articular surface between the hemicylinders of bone can be inspected and identified after the cylin-der of bone has been removed. The larger trephine is used to take bone graft from the anterior iliac crest through a 1 -cm stab incision (Fig. 2). The incision is made approximately 1 inch posterior and inferior to the anterior iliac crest. Three or four <b>bone</b> <b>plugs</b> are easily harvested.

This technique has not been subjected to biomechanical testing. We hypothesised that a wedged <b>bone</b> <b>plug</b> fixation technique provides equivalent tensile load to failure as titanium interference screw fixation. Methods In a controlled laboratory setting, anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction was performed in 36 bovine knees using bone-patella-bone autograft. In 20 knees tibial fixation relied upon a standard cuboid bone block and interference screw. In eight knees a wedge shaped bone block with an 11 mm by 10 mm base without a screw was used. In a further eight knees a similar wedge with a 13 mm by 10 mm base was used. Each specimen used a standard 10 mm tibial tunnel. The reconstructions were tested biomechanically in a physiological environment using an Instron machine to compare ultimate failure loads and modes of failure. Results Statistical analysis revealed {{no significant difference between}} wedge fixation and screw fixation (p = 0. 16), or between individual groups (interference screw versus 11 mm versus 13 mm wedge fixation) (P = 0. 35).

The autograft and the allograft were identically implanted by cementing <b>bone</b> <b>plugs</b> attached to the meniscal horns in anatomic transtibial tunnels and suturing the outer edge of the meniscus to the remnant of the original meniscus. A medial meniscal allograft did not consistently restore normal contact mechanics because the process of implantation and the degree of match between the original and allograft meniscus affected the immediate load-bearing performance of the transplant. However, the allograft did significantly reduce the contact pressure compared with the knee after men-‡Address correspondence and reprint requests to Maury L. Hull, PhD, Biomed...|$|R
25|$|Once diagnosed, {{the gap in}} the {{temporal}} bone can be repaired by surgical resurfacing of the affected <b>bone</b> or <b>plugging</b> of the superior semicircular canal. These techniques are performed by accessing the site of the dehiscence either via a middle fossa craniotomy or via a canal drilled through the transmastoid bone behind the affected ear. Bone cement has been the material most often used, in spite of its tendency to slippage and resorption, and a consequent high failure rate; recently, soft tissue grafts have been substituted.|$|R
40|$|Several {{experimental}} {{studies have shown}} that bone–tendon p 0310 graft healing in ACL reconstruction occurs in a period varying from 3 to 12 weeks. The quality and rate of healing depend on many variables, predominantly the type of graft. Soft tissue grafts such as hamstring tendon grafts heal within a bone tunnel by formation of a fibrous transitional layer between the tendon and bone, which contains penetrating Sharpey-like fibers. This newly formed bone– tendon interface matures with time and resembles the indirect-type insertion observed in tendons and ligaments. <b>Bone</b> <b>plug</b> tendon grafts, such as patellar tendon, heal within bone tunnel by incorporation of the <b>bone</b> <b>plug</b> to the surrounding bone and formation of an indirect-type insertion at the interface between bone and the intraosseous fibrous portion of the graft. Bone–bone healing occurs more rapidly than tendon—bone healing. Resistance to pullout force appears to be similar between the two types of grafts by 8 to 12 weeks after surgery. Therefore soft tissue grafts need high primary fixation strength and stiffness because of the consistent risk of failure due to pullout from the tunnel during the first 2 months. Mechanical stresses can affect maturation and differentiation of the bone–tendon graft junction depending on many factors such as bone density, fixation, placement and tensioning of the graft, gap size, and postoperative immobilization. Compression of the graft within the tunnel can enhance healing for both the <b>bone</b> <b>plug</b> and soft tissue. However, during the first 3 months after an ACL reconstruction, regardless of the type of graft used, the strength of the bone–tendon graft junction does not influence the mechanical behavior of the femur–ACL graft–tibia complex because the weak link of the ligament replacement rapidly shifts from the fixation site to the midsubstance of the graft. Therefore the application of excessive loads during this period, such as a too-aggressive rehabilitation and early return to sport activities, may cause a permanent elongation of the graft, thus compromising the result of the reconstruction. Many efforts have been made to improve the quality and rate of bone–tendon healing. Tissue engineering and gene transfer techniques have been applied to obtain a direct-type fibrocartilaginous insertion of the ACL graft, {{similar to that of the}} native ligament, and to accelerate the healing process of tendon grafts within bone tunnel. However, more investigations will be necessary in the near future to evaluate the possible employment of these biological techniques in the clinical practice...|$|E

40|$|Introduction : the {{objective}} of this review is to give a state of affairs of meniscal transplantation, with the accent on preservation and surgical techniques. Materials and methods : All articles were selected by performing a search on the literature by using relevant keywords. The most relevant articles were selected with close attention to the publication date. Results : When a meniscal tear is diagnosed, suture can be an option in the vascular zone, whereas the more frequently affected avascular zone heals poorly. A meniscectomy however is not without consequences, wherefore meniscal transplantation {{can be seen as a}} therapeutic option for pain reduction and improvement of function when the meniscus is lost. The meniscal scaffold, allograft and autograft can be currently withheld as possible grafts, where the meniscal scaffolds hold great promise as an alternative to the allograft. Various fixation techniques are therefore developed, where viable, deep frozen as well as cryo-preservated allografts seem to give the most promising short term results. The transplantation can be performed using an open as well as an arthroscopic technique, using soft tissue fixation, <b>bone</b> <b>plugs</b> or blocks. De primacy of one technique can't be proven. In general meniscal transplantation can be considered as an acceptable procedure. Discussion : Since the outcomes of different studies are difficult to compare, an attempt should be made to limit new studies to the comparison of one aspect. We can conclude that larger, more comparative randomised controlled long-term studies are necessary to resolve which techniques can give the best long-term results...|$|R
40|$|Avascular {{necrosis}} (AVN) of the femoral head is {{a debilitating}} {{disease of the}} bone that may result {{from a variety of}} aetiologies, and progresses to the death of the bone and collapse of the femoral head, and ultimately to deformation of the hip joint. In vitro models of AVN have been previously developed in live animals; however none of these models produce the mechanical failures that are observed in AVN femoral heads. The aim {{of this study was to}} produce a mechanical simulation model of AVN in vitro. To achieve this, a series of preliminary studies were carried out. First, femoral heads from AVN patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty were studied to understand the effects of the disease on the mechanical and structural properties of the bone. The findings were compared with mechanical and structural properties of bone from nonpathological control femoral heads, and the results demonstrated mean reductions in the mechanical properties of bone with AVN. Methods of reducing mechanical properties of bone were analysed to develop a mechanical simulation model of AVN in vitro. For this, chemical methods were analysed which either demineralised or dissolved the collagen matrix in the bone. The effects of treatment time were analysed on mechanical properties of bone, and it was found that demineralising <b>bone</b> <b>plugs</b> in hydrochloric acid was the most effective method of reducing the mechanical properties of bone. In order to develop a model of AVN, porcine bone sections were treated with hydrochloric acid and returned to the femoral heads to simulate lesions in AVN. The resultant change in the structural mechanical properties of the femoral heads were analysed to determine the most suitable method of simulating AVN in porcine bone, and to provide recommendations for achieving a mechanical bone model representing the structural and mechanical properties of AVN femoral heads...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjective: The initial {{attachment}} of transplanted chondrocytes to {{the surface}} of a cartilage defect is crucial for the success of chondrocyte transplantation. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the early interaction of chondrocytes with the deep or calcified zones of cartilage or the subchondral bone, joint surfaces to which transplanted chondrocytes might have to attach in vivo. Design: Freshly isolated (primary) or passaged (P 1) chondrocytes were seeded on the top of <b>bone</b> <b>plugs</b> having either a surface composed of mid-deep zone hyaline cartilage or calcified cartilage or bone only. The percent of cells that attached, the role of integrins in cell attachment, and gene expression after placement of the cells on the different surfaces were determined. Results: Both primary and passaged chondrocytes attached efficiently to all three surfaces (over 88 % of seeded cells). The chondrocytes showed a punctate distribution of β 1 -integrin and vinculin, which in areas co-localized with actin, suggesting that the cells formed focal adhesions. The primary chondrocytes had a different shape, appearance of focal contacts, and actin distribution when compared to passaged cells and these did not appear to be influenced by the type of surface to which the cells attached. Blocking either β 1 -integrin or αvβ 5 integrin partially inhibited (between 27 to 48 % and 26 to 37 % respectively) attachment of both primary and passaged chondrocytes to all surfaces. Blocking αvβ 3 had no effect on adhesion. There was expression of type II collagen and aggrecan core protein mRNA by 2 h. The different surfaces did not appear to affect the expression of these genes up to 24 h although gene levels were lower in passaged cells. Conclusions: Chondrocytes, either freshly isolated or passaged, have the potential to adhere to the different joint surfaces that could be exposed in a cartilage defect. Understanding how chondrocytes adhere and interact with damaged joint surfaces may help identify methods to enhance the retention of transplanted cells in the defect site and cartilage tissue formation...|$|R
