40|$|The zircon U-Pb and {{muscovite}} K-Ar {{age from}} the Bantimala, Barru and Biru <b>basement</b> <b>complexes</b> in the South Arm of Sulawesi, Indonesia provide new {{information regarding the}} timing of magmatism, metamorphism and sedimentation in this region and have implications for the origin and evolution of the study area. The study area is at the juncture between the southeast margin of Sundaland and Bird???s Head-Australia. The age of both the zircon U-Pb of detrital materials in the Bantimala Complex and the muscovite K-Ar of amphibolite in the Biru Complex fall in the late Early Cretaceous (between 109 - 115 Ma), which is a similar age range to previous data for both the sedimentary and metamorphic rocks. The youngest detrital zircon in the schist samples from the Barru Complex fall into the Triassic in age (between 243 - 247 Ma). These age data indicate that the protolith of all three <b>basement</b> <b>complexes</b> {{were involved in the}} subduction system and metamorphosed in the late Early Cretaceous, but there are several differences in their deposition environment under and out of the influence of the late Early Cretaceous magmatism in the Bantimala and Barru Complexes, respectively. Felsic igneous activities are confirmed in the Late Cretaceous and the Eocene by the zircon U-Pb age of igneous rocks intruding or included as detrital fragments in three <b>basement</b> <b>complexes.</b> These dates are similar to those reported from the Meratus Complex of South Kalimantan. The detrital zircon age distributions of the basement rocks in the South Arm of Sulawesi display predominant Mesozoic (Cretaceous and Triassic) and Paleozoic populations with a small population of Proterozoic ages supporting the hypothesis that the West Sulawesi block originated from the region of the circum Bird???s Head-Australian, namely the Inner Banda block. The absence of Jurassic zircon age population in the South Arm of Sulawesi suggests the division of the South Arm of Sulawesi from the Inner Banda block in early stage of rifting. Western Sulawesi is composed of several blocks separated from Inner Banda block with different histories, which is supported by the varieties of zircon population distribution in the basement rocks in the Western Sulawesi and also difference of general orientations of structural features between the Bantimala and Barru Complexes...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Variability of some {{physicochemical}} properties on Lithosequence in Funtua, Northwestern, Nigeria {{were studied}} {{to determine the}} extent of variation in physical and chemical properties within and between soils developed on <b>basement</b> <b>complexes,</b> loess over <b>basement</b> <b>complexes</b> and loess parent materials. Variability was more pronounced in chemical than in physical properties. Particle density (CV = 0. 23 %) and exchangeable sodium percentage (CV = 2. 23) were the least variable physicochemical properties. Physicochemical properties with highest variability are Si/C ratio (CV = 88. 29 %) and AP (CV = 149 %). Less variability (CV ≤ 15 %) irrespective of soils were recorded in particle density, bulk density and pH, and therefore required similar management for all the soils. Silt, AWHC, CEC, CEC clay and base saturation were consistently moderately variable (CV:> 15 ≤ 35 %). Silt/clay ratio, K, OC, TN, AP and AS were consistently highly variable CV> 35 %). Large proportion of properties of the soils were highly variable in all the soils with 10 (42 %) of physicochemical properties of soils on BC, 9 (38 %) on LBC and 13 (54 %) on LS. The highly variable status was attributed to difference in land use types, management and cultural practices occurring within the study area. Properties significantly influenced by Lithosequence include available water holding capacity, magnesium, potassium, CEC and TEA. They were significantly highest in soils on loess and contributed to variation in pattern of nutrient and exchangeable bases retention...|$|R
40|$|Historical {{notes on}} Galician geology, {{and on the}} work of the Leiden University {{petrology}} team in particular, are first provided. This is followed by an introduction to the geology of Galicia with emphasis on its crystalline basement and upper mantle inliers. Six lithotectonic units are distinguished: 1) the Variscan granitic rocks and migmatites. 2) the Palaeozoic supracrustal rocks and dismembered meta-ophiolites, 3) the blastomylonitic graben between Malpica and Tuy, 4) the Lalin and Forcarey Units, 5) the Ordenes basin and its mesocatazonal peripheral belt, 6) the predominantly mafic-ultramafic catazonal complex at Cabo Ortegal. The supracrustal history of western Galicia in late Precambrian and early Palaeozoic times, as inferred from neighbouring areas, is briefly outlined and is compared with the igneous, tectonic and metamorphic evolution of the upper mantle and lower crustal rocks contained in the polymetamorphic <b>basement</b> <b>complexes</b> (1 — 4), which have sustained high-pressure and high-temperature metamorphism under a flow-folding regime prior to the Variscan orogeny. Several models proposed {{for the development of the}} <b>basement</b> <b>complexes</b> in the northern Hesperian Massif are briefly discussed. It is considered most likely that an early Palaeozoic rift system caused by mantle plume diapirism, and accompanied by deepseated thermal metamorphism, lower crustal recycling, updoming of the crust and incipient sea floor spreading, was closely followed by Variscan low-pressure metamorphism, migmatization and granite emplacement under an intermittently compressive and dilatational tectonic regime. Finally, the probability of a Precambrian orogenic crust in western Galicia is briefly explored...|$|R

50|$|Dass {{is located}} on the <b>basement</b> <b>complex</b> rocks of North Central Highland. It is characterised by {{plutonic}} rocks that solidified at some depth within the earth’s crust, solidification of the rock was slowly made thereby, forming large crystals of rock or coarse grain. The granite, gabbros, migmatite, gneisses and diorite that are seen on the surface in the study area now are exposed to the surface by denudational activities and erosion. The Plutonic rocks in the area contain mostly acid rocks with the presence of silicate and aluminium, which most times make it lighter in colour. It contains mostly quartz and some fraction of mica. The geology of the area shows that the area is a <b>basement</b> <b>complex</b> with shallow water table at average depth of 7.41m (Nyanganji, 2011). The <b>basement</b> <b>complex</b> of the underlying rocks is highly pervious and permeable due to penetrating cracks, fault and fissures which allow water to percolate easily and fast into the rock mass. The rocks belong to Precambrian to early Palaeozoic era. The following minerals are found in the area; tin, quartz, feldspar, aquarium, zinc, iron, manganese and kaolin.|$|E

Subsequent fieldwork, metamorphic studies and radiometric dating has refined their chronology but supported their original hypothesis.|$|R

Most of such areas have a shortage of water. As the success ratio of drilling in hard rock terrain may be low, and the use of geophysics is often judged as too expensive, the study of lineaments from remote sensed imagery is an attractive alternative. High production areas in hard-rock aquifers are generally associated with conductive fracture zones. An effective method for defining the fracture zone is based on lineament indices, which are extracted from satellite imagery. Together with a detailed structural analysis and understanding of the tectonic evolution of a given area it provides a useful tool for hydrogeologists for studying groundwater in fractured rock and developing water resources.
