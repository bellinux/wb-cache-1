40|$|Recently {{considerable}} {{efforts have}} been dedicated to unconstrained face recognition, which requires to identify faces "in the wild" {{for a set of}} images and/or video frames captured without human intervention. Unlike traditional face recognition that compares one-to-one medium (either a single image or a video frame) only, we consider a problem of matching sets with heterogeneous contents of both images and videos. In this paper, we propose a novel Set-to-Set (<b>S</b> 2 <b>S)</b> <b>distance</b> measure to calculate the similarity between two sets with the aim to improve the accuracy of face recognition in real-world situations such as extreme poses or severe illumination conditions. Our <b>S</b> 2 <b>S</b> <b>distance</b> adopts the kNN-average pooling for the similarity scores computed on all the media in two sets, making the identification far less susceptible to the poor representations (outliers) than traditional feature-average pooling and score-average pooling. Furthermore, we show that various metrics can be embedded into our <b>S</b> 2 <b>S</b> <b>distance</b> framework, including both predefined and learned ones. This allows to choose the appropriate metric depending on the recognition task in order to achieve the best results. To evaluate the proposed <b>S</b> 2 <b>S</b> <b>distance,</b> we conduct extensive experiments on the challenging set-based IJB-A face dataset, which demonstrate that our algorithm achieves the stateof- the-art results and is clearly superior to the baselines including several deep learning based face recognition algorithms...|$|R

Peled, On the first eigenvalue of bipartite graphs, Electron. J. Combin. 15 (2008), # 144] that double nested graphs, also called bipartite chain graphs, play the same role within class of bipartite graphs. In this paper we study some structural and spectral features of double nested graphs. In studying the spectrum of double nested graphs we rather consider some weighted nonnegative matrices (of significantly less order) which preserve all positive eigenvalues of former ones. Moreover, their inverse matrices appear to be tridiagonal. Using this fact we provide several new bounds on the index (largest eigenvalue) of double nested graphs, and also deduce some bounds on eigenvector components for the index. We conclude the paper by examining the questions related to main versus non-main eigenvalues...|$|R

The Earth Mover <b>s</b> <b>Distance</b> can then be used for comparing point sets by determining how much work it would take to convert one of the point sets into the other by moving weight between the point sets. For evaluating how well this method and other methods agree with human perception of melodic similarity, we established a ground truth for the RISM A/II collection based on the opinions of human experts. The RISM A/II collection contains about half a million musical incipits. For 22 queries, we filtered the collection so that about 50 candidates per query were left, each of which we then presented to about 30 human experts (out of a group of 37 experts) for a final ranking. We present our filtering methods, the experiment design, the resulting ground truth, and a new measure (called Average Dynamic Recall) {{that can be used for}} comparing different similarity measures with the ground truth. ...|$|R
