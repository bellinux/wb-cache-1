40|$|In 1986, Chamonix {{dedicated}} {{a statue}} to Michel-Gabriel Paccard during the bicentennial celebrations {{of the first}} ascent of Mont Blanc. Paccard sits by himself grasping a wooden alpenstock, with a <b>barometer</b> <b>case</b> {{over his shoulder and}} hat and knapsack at his feet. The first version of the statue made from an epoxy resin suffered from Chamonix 2 Ì† 7 s severe winters and was replaced by a bronze cast in 1991. The statue sits on a granite plinth elevated above a very large base where Avenue Michel Croz crosses the River Arve. From this position, Paccard looks down the river toward Mont Blanc and over the shoulders of the statues of Balmat and Saussure that were erected a century earlier.

40|$|Monthly mean {{gravitational}} field parameters (denoted here as C(sub even)) that represent linear combinations of the primarily even degree zonal spherical harmonic coefficients of the Earth's {{gravitational field}} {{have been recovered}} using LAGEOS I data and are compared with those derived from gridded global surface pressure data of the National meteorological center (NMC) spanning 1983 - 1992. The effect of equilibrium ocean tides and surface water variations are also considered. Atmospheric pressure and surface water fluctuations are shown to be the dominant cause of observed annual C(sub even) variations. Closure with observations is seen at the 1 sigma level when atmospheric pressure, ocean tide and surface water effects are include. Equilibrium ocean tides are shown {{to be the main}} source of excitation at the semiannual period with closure at the 1 sigma level seen when both atmospheric pressure and ocean tide effects are included. The inverted <b>barometer</b> (IB) <b>case</b> is shown to give the best agreement with the observation series. The potential of the observed C(sub even) variations for monitoring mass variations in the polar regions of the Earth and the effect of the land-ocean mask in the IB calculation are discussed...|$|R
60|$|It must {{be borne}} {{in mind that}} the {{comparative}} results given below afford by no means a fair idea of the accuracy to be obtained by the boiling-point. Some of the differences in elevation are probably due to the <b>barometer.</b> In other <b>cases</b> I may have read off the scale wrong, for however simple it seems to read off an instrument, those practically acquainted with their use know well how some errors almost become chronic, how with a certain familiar instrument the chance of error is very great at one particular part of the scale, and how confusing it is to read off through steam alternately from several instruments whose scales are of different dimensions, are differently divided, and differently lettered; such causes of error are constitutional in individual observers. Again, these observations are selected without any reference to other considerations but what I have stated above; the worst have been put in with the best. Had I been dependent on the boiling-point for determining my elevations, I should have observed it oftener, or at stated periods whenever in camp, worked the greater elevations from the intermediate ones, as well as from Calcutta, and resorted to every system of interpolation. Even the following observations would be amended considerably were I to have deduced the elevation by observations of the boiling-point at my camp, and added the height of my camp, either from the boiling-point observations there, or by barometer, but I thought it better to select the most independent method of observation, and to make the level of the sea at Calcutta the only datum for a lower station.|$|R
40|$|A {{plurality}} of {{interpretations of the}} reasons behind the evolution ofthe Social Democratic parties exists. Underestimated though in this literature is {{the exploration of the}} influence that the close involvement of the Social Democratic parties with the European Integration process and the emerging European Polity i. e. the European Union has had in the ideological evolution of the Social Democratic parties. My thesis constitutes a mix research design were the combination of quantitative research (Party Manifesto Data) is combined with Qualitative Research (Case Studies). The analysis and quantitative evaluation of the manifestos that the Social Democratic parties have presented to the electorate, allows me to detect the evolution of the Social Democratic parties' ideology objectively and thus establish the ideological trends that exist across country and time, without facing any methodological differences due to data unavailability or data incompatibility. Variables which constitute core elements of Social Democracy party ideology are thus selected and the findings of our research graphically presented. The evolvement of the Social Democratic parties to the most pro European Union party family is established. The findings of the Party Manifesto data is then cross examined with the data provided by the Euro <b>barometer</b> surveys. Two <b>case</b> studies are under taken in order to establish that the results of our quantitative research are valid. The French PS and Greek PASOK are selected in order to represent the European Union's core and periphery as well as different economic development s~atus. As the European Integration has been embedded with neoliberal policies, the long march of the Social Democratic parties from the implementation of one state Keynesian economic policy to the search for a Social Democratic European polity has ended with the incorporation of the neoliberal paradigm within the Social Democracy ideology.
