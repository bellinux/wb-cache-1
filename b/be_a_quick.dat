5|$|In certain regions, {{presence}} or absence of certain scales may <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> way to distinguish non-venomous and venomous snakes, but used with care and knowledge of exceptions. For example, in Myanmar, the {{presence or}} absence of loreal scales can be used to distinguish between relatively harmless Colubrids and lethally venomous Elapids. The rule of hand for this region is that the absence of a loreal scale between the nasal scale and pre-ocular scale indicates that the snake is an Elapid and hence lethal. This rule-of-thumb cannot be used without care as it cannot be applied to vipers, which have a large number of small scales on the head. A careful check would also be needed to exclude known poisonous members of the Colubrid family such as Rhabdophis.|$|E

25|$|Arkansas held a very {{important}} position for the Rebels, maintaining control of the Mississippi River and surrounding Southern states. The bloody Battle of Wilson's Creek {{just across the border}} in Missouri shocked many Arkansans who thought the war would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> and decisive Southern victory. Battles early in the war took place in northwest Arkansas, including the Battle of Cane Hill, Battle of Pea Ridge, and Battle of Prairie Grove. Union General Samuel Curtis swept across the state to Helena in the Delta in 1862. Little Rock was captured the following year. The government shifted the state Confederate capital to Hot Springs, and then again to Washington from 1863–1865, {{for the remainder of the}} war. Throughout the state, guerrilla warfare ravaged the countryside and destroyed cities. Passion for the Confederate cause waned after implementation of programs such as the draft, high taxes, and martial law.|$|E

500|$|At a lull {{in-between}} projects, programmer Eric Johnson of Semi Secret Software {{found the}} open source code and ported {{the game to}} iPad in a weekend before notifying Wohlwend. At the time, Wohlwend {{did not have an}} iOS device to test the port, and had to purchase an iPad. Johnson's iPad version spurred Wohlwend to consider how Hundreds would work with multitouch and cooperative play, and Semi Secret's Adam Saltsman to consider a Hundreds collaborative iOS release. The project was intended to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> level expansion, but quickly surpassed its several month estimate. Wohlwend and Saltsman extended the game's mechanics with new circles and puzzles, and many of their implemented ideas were later removed. Wohlwend was happy with the final result and credited the game's [...] "emergent interaction" [...] qualities to Saltsman. They built on each other's level designs, though Wohlwend said that Saltsman made [...] "basically all the levels". The new team enjoyed working with each other.|$|E

Memer believes {{she is the only}} who knows how to get in, until she finds the Waylord there when she is nine years old. He offers to teach her to read, after swearing her to secrecy. Memer proves to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> learner. Four days after her seventeenth birthday, Memer makes the acquaintance of Orrec and Gry, the protagonists of Gifts. Orrec, famous as a poet and storyteller, has been invited to Ansul to perform: Memer invites him and Gry to stay at Galvamand. They tell the Waylord that though the Alds invited them to Ansul, they came to find Galvamand, for the ancient library rumored to have once existed there. Orrec questions Memer {{about the history of the}} city: she tells him that Galvamand used to be known as the Oracle house, and realizes she does not know why.|$|E
500|$|In 1942, Seaborg married Helen Griggs, the {{secretary}} of physicist Ernest Lawrence. Under wartime pressure, Seaborg had moved to Chicago while engaged to Griggs. When Seaborg returned to accompany Griggs for the journey back to Chicago, friends expected them to marry in Chicago. But, eager to be married, Seaborg and Griggs impulsively got off the train {{in the town of}} Caliente, Nevada, for what they thought would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> wedding. When they asked for City Hall, they found Caliente had none—they would have to travel [...] north to Pioche, the county seat. With no car, this was no easy feat, but one of Caliente's newest deputy sheriffs {{turned out to be a}} recent graduate of the Cal Berkeley chemistry department and was more than happy to do a favor for Seaborg. The deputy sheriff arranged for the wedding couple to ride up and back to Pioche in a mail truck. The witnesses at the Seaborg wedding were a clerk and a janitor. Glenn Seaborg and Helen Griggs Seaborg had seven children, of whom the first, Peter Glenn Seaborg, died in 1997 (his twin Paulette having died in infancy). The others were Lynne Seaborg Cobb, David Seaborg, Steve Seaborg, Eric Seaborg, and Dianne Seaborg.|$|E

Before a reopening date could be set, the operator would have to work with the land owner and their insurance company. Due to risk of rock and tree fall on much of the sloped land, the operator {{has not been able to}} assess the damage fully, but announced that [...] "it's not going to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> fix". Much of the damage is worse than initially thought, and the lift's 36-tonne haul rope will have to be replaced.
